25|$|I {{was very}} much {{surprised}} when Mill informed {{me that he had}} not read a line of Hegel, either in the original or in translation, and regarded the entire Hegelian philosophy as sterile and empty sophistry. I mentally confronted this with the opinion of the man at the Copenhagen University who knew the history of philosophy best, my teacher, Hans Brochner, who knew, so to speak, nothing of contemporary English and French philosophy, and did not think them worth studying. I came to the conclusion <b>that</b> <b>here</b> <b>was</b> a task for one who understood the thinkers of the two directions, who did not mutually understand one another. I thought that in philosophy, too, I knew what I wanted, and saw a road open in front of me.|$|E

500|$|Arthur Conan Doyle {{began writing}} while {{studying}} medicine at {{university in the}} late 1870s, and had his first short story, [...] "The Mystery of Sasassa Valley", published in September 1879. Eight years later, A Study in Scarlet, Doyle's first Sherlock Holmes story, was published by Ward Lock & Co. The novel was well received, but Doyle was paid little for it, and despite a sequel novel, The Sign of the Four, also being published by Ward Lock, he shifted his focus to short stories. In early 1891, the first editor of The Strand Magazine, Herbert Greenhough Smith, received two submissions from Doyle for the newly established magazine. He later described his reaction; [...] "I at once realised <b>that</b> <b>here</b> <b>was</b> the greatest short story writer since Edgar Allan Poe." [...] The first of these, [...] "A Scandal in Bohemia" [...] was published near the back of The Strand Magazine in July 1891. The stories proved popular, helping to boost the circulation of the magazine, and Doyle received 30 guineas for each short story in the initial run of twelve. These first twelve stories were published monthly from July 1891 until June 1892, [...] and then were collected together and published as a book, The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes on 14 October 1892 by George Newnes, the publisher of The Strand Magazine. The initial print run of the book was for 10,000 copies in the United Kingdom, and a further 4,500 copies in the United States, which were published by Harper Brothers the following day.|$|E

That's fucking rubbish. Kids don't need to be hearing that nonsense." [...] While Gallagher has stated he did not intend [...] "Live Forever" [...] as a direct retort to Nirvana or their music (being a professed fan of the band), he contrasted the lives of Cobain and his band at that point, saying, [...] "Seems to me <b>that</b> <b>here</b> <b>was</b> a guy who had everything, and was miserable about it. And we had fuck-all, and I still thought that getting up in the morning was the greatest fuckin' thing ever, 'cause you didn't know where you'd end up at night. And we didn't have a pot to piss in, but it was fucking great, man". Gallagher considers the line [...] "We see things they'll never see" [...] the most important line of the song, explaining that old friends tend to laugh at jokes and stories that [...] "no one else gets".|$|E

2500|$|Hosking's clients, {{led by the}} Abney Park Cemetery's {{founder and}} indefatigable company {{secretary}} George Collison II, worked with him to prepare a unique design for the Stoke Newington cemetery. Collison increasingly came {{to the view that}} Hosking's layout and architectural styles should meet a brief of being symbolic of the cemetery's founding ideals; to reflect the fact <b>that</b> <b>here</b> <b>was</b> to be the first nineteenth-century garden cemetery to be neither consecrated, nor set out by Act of Parliament, giving it both a non-denominational character and also permitting inclusion of spaces and designs for wider educational and public access purposes. Hosking's buildings must also respect the landscape, for here, unlike other cemeteries of its period, use of the land for interment was partly viewed as a convenient means to achieve other common purposes; all of the original founders were Congregationalists who shared an underlying motivation to preserve and encourage interest and appreciation in the landscape of Abney Park that [...] "spoke to them" [...] of the memory of Isaac Watts and Lady Mary Abney.

2500|$|On {{the night}} of 30–31 August 1939, Ribbentrop had an {{extremely}} heated exchange with the British Ambassador, Sir Nevile Henderson, who objected to Ribbentrop's demand, given at about midnight, that if a Polish plenipotentiary did not arrive in Berlin that night to discuss the German [...] "final offer", then {{the responsibility for the}} outbreak of war would not rest on the Reich. Henderson stated that the terms of the German [...] "final offer" [...] were very reasonable, but argued that Ribbentrop's time limit for Polish acceptance of the [...] "final offer" [...] was most unreasonable, and furthermore demanded to know why Ribbentrop insisted upon seeing a special Polish plenipotentiary and could not present the [...] "final offer" [...] to Ambassador Józef Lipski or provide a written copy of the [...] "final offer". The Henderson–Ribbentrop meeting became so tense that the two men almost came to blows. The American historian Gerhard Weinberg described the Henderson–Ribbentrop meeting in this way: When Joachim von Ribbentrop refused to give a copy of the German demands to the British Ambassador [...] at midnight of 30–31 August 1939, the two almost came to blows. Ambassador Henderson, who had long advocated concessions to Germany, recognized <b>that</b> <b>here</b> <b>was</b> a deliberately conceived alibi the German government had prepared for a war it was determined to start. No wonder Henderson was angry; von Ribbentrop on the other hand could see war ahead and went home beaming.|$|E
2500|$|Elsie's biggest success came in {{creating}} the title role in the English-language version of The Merry Widow in the London production. Edwardes took Elsie to see the original German version (Die Lustige Witwe) in Berlin. Elsie was at first reluctant {{to take on the}} demanding part, thinking her voice too light for the role, but Edwardes persuaded her to accept. [...] Edwardes brought her to see the famous designer, Lucile, for a style coaching. [...] Lucile later wrote, [...] "I realised <b>that</b> <b>here</b> <b>was</b> a girl who had both beauty and intelligence but who had never learnt how {{to make the best of}} herself. So shy and diffident was she in those days that a less astute producer than George Edwardes would in all probability have passed her over and left her in the chorus." [...] The production, with English lyrics by Adrian Ross, opened in June 1907 and ran for 778 performances at Daly's Theatre. Elsie created the role at Daly's and toured with it beginning in August 1908. The show was an enormous success for its creators and made Elsie a major star. One critic at the opening night praised [...] "the youthfulness, the dainty charm and grace, the prettiness and the exquisite dancing with which Miss Elsie invests the part.... I share the opinion of most of the first-nighters, who considered it could not have been in better hands, and could not have been better handled.... The night was a genuine triumph for Miss Elsie, and she well deserved all the calls she received." ...|$|E

2500|$|After the 1995 {{referendum}} very narrowly defeated {{a proposal}} on Quebec sovereignty, Chrétien started to champion what eventually become the Clarity Act {{as part of}} his [...] "Plan B". In August 1996, the lawyer Guy Bertrand won a ruling in a Quebec court declaring that the sovereignty question was not just a political matter between Quebec City and Ottawa, but also a legal matter which was subjected to the rulings of the courts. Following that ruling, Chrétien decided <b>that</b> <b>here</b> <b>was</b> a means of defeating the Quebec sovereignty movement, and in September 1996, ordered the Justice Minister Allan Rock to take this question of the precise legality of Quebec separating to the Supreme Court. Stéphane Dion advised Chrétien that if the federal government won the reference to the Supreme Court as expected, that the government should then draft a bill that stated what were the precise rules for Quebec to leave, telling the Prime Minister if the people of Quebec could be shown how difficult it would be to leave, then support for separatism would fall. Along the same lines, Dion started to send much publicised open letters to Quebec ministers questioning the assumptions behind the separatist case. The new policy of [...] "Plan B" [...] towards Quebec created much tension within the Cabinet with the [...] "soft federalist" [...] fraction led by Martin opposing the [...] "Plan B" [...] policy, especially the Clarity Act, and instead preferred a new Meech Lake-like constitutional deal while the [...] "hard federalist" [...] fraction led by Chrétien championed the new policy of confronting the Bouchard government and were against any concessions on the constitution. The [...] "hard federalist" [...] Chrétien fraction took to disparagingly referring to the [...] "soft federalist" [...] Martin fraction as [...] "the appeasers".|$|E
2500|$|Chrétien {{revealed}} {{himself to}} be a staunch [...] "hard federalist" [...] favoring a strong federal government {{at the expense of the}} provinces, much along the same lines as his predecessor Trudeau. However unlike Trudeau, Chrétien supported the Charlottetown Accord of August 1992, which proposed devolving federal powers to the provinces and once again recognized Quebec as a [...] "distinct society". At the urging of Pelletier, Chrétien met secretly with Trudeau at the Royal York Hotel in Toronto, where the two men argued about the meaning of [...] "distinct society" [...] for more than two hours. While the two did not resolve their differences, Trudeau promised to refrain from undermining Chrétien's authority in public. Trudeau denounced the Accord at the Maison Egg Roll in Montreal on October 1, 1992. Chrétien had major reservations about the Charlottetown accord, but as his opposition to Meech had done him much damage in Quebec, he was anxious not to be seen as an opponent of another set of constitutional amendments designed to secure Quebec's ratification of the 1982 constitution, especially as Charlottetown was very similar to the amendments that Chrétien had proposed to Meech Lake in 1990. Chrétien endorsed the Charlottetown accord on the rather negative grounds that the constitutional debate of the late 1980s-early 1990s were destroying Canada, saying it [...] "was bleeding the nation to death" [...] and that Charlottetown was the best way of ending that debate in order to move political debate back to the economic recession, which had begun in 1990. At a Liberal caucus meeting on September 8, 1992, Chrétien declared that [...] "if we had been the government we would not have made this deal", and that only reason to support Charlottetown was that to reject it would increase support for Quebec separatism. [...] The unity minister Joe Clark recalled that Chrétien did not champion the Charlottetown accord in the 1992 referendum with any great conviction or passion, stating: [...] "We were trying to bring everybody into the tent on it, and I made a practice taking proposals to the other party, particularly Chrétien...I just didn't think he was following the issue...I don't know what it was...But it left me with was the belief <b>that</b> <b>here</b> <b>was</b> a guy for whom the substance of things doesn't matter much." [...] During the 1992 referendum, Chrétien kept a low profile, and delivered only a few speeches in favor of Charlottetown.|$|E
