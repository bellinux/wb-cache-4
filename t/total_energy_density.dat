5|$|The {{flatness}} problem (also {{known as}} the oldness problem) is an observational problem associated with a Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric (FLRW). The universe may have positive, negative, or zero spatial curvature depending on its <b>total</b> <b>energy</b> <b>density.</b> Curvature is negative, if its density {{is less than the}} critical density; positive, if greater; and zero at the critical density, in which case space is said to be flat.|$|E
5|$|Independent {{lines of}} {{evidence}} from Type Ia supernovae and the CMB {{imply that the}} universe today is dominated by a mysterious form of energy known as dark energy, which apparently permeates all of space. The observations suggest 73% of the <b>total</b> <b>energy</b> <b>density</b> of today's universe is in this form. When the universe was very young, it was likely infused with dark energy, but with less space and everything closer together, gravity predominated, and it was slowly braking the expansion. But eventually, after numerous billion years of expansion, the growing abundance of dark energy caused {{the expansion of the}} universe to slowly begin to accelerate.|$|E
5|$|Estimates put {{the average}} energy {{density of the}} Universe at the {{equivalent}} of 5.9 protons per cubic meter, including dark energy, dark matter, and baryonic matter (ordinary matter composed of atoms). The atoms account for only 4.6% of the <b>total</b> <b>energy</b> <b>density,</b> or a density of one proton per four cubic meters. The density of the Universe, however, is clearly not uniform; it ranges from relatively high density in galaxies—including very high density in structures within galaxies, such as planets, stars, and black holes—to conditions in vast voids that have much lower density, {{at least in terms}} of visible matter. Unlike the matter and dark matter, the dark energy seems not to be concentrated in galaxies: although dark energy may account for a majority of the mass-energy in the Universe, dark energy's influence is 5 orders of magnitude smaller than the influence of gravity from matter and dark matter within the Milky Way.|$|E

40|$|A novel {{creep-fatigue}} life {{prediction model}} was deduced {{based on an}} expression of the strain <b>energy</b> <b>density</b> in this study. In order to obtain the expression of the strain <b>energy</b> <b>density,</b> the load-controlled creep-fatigue (CF) tests of P 92 steel at 873 K were carried out. Cyclic strain of P 92 steel under CF load was divided into elastic strain, applying and unloading plastic strain, creep strain, and anelastic strain. Analysis of cyclic strain indicates that the damage process of P 92 steel under CF load consists of three stages, similar to pure creep. According to the characteristics of the strains above, an expression was defined to describe the strain <b>energy</b> <b>density</b> for each cycle. The strain <b>energy</b> <b>density</b> at stable stage is inversely proportional to the <b>total</b> strain <b>energy</b> <b>density</b> dissipated by P 92 steel. However, the <b>total</b> strain <b>energy</b> <b>densities</b> under different test conditions are proportional to the fatigue life. Therefore, the expression of the strain <b>energy</b> <b>density</b> at stable stage was chosen to predict the fatigue life. The CF experimental data on P 92 steel were employed to verify the rationality of the novel model.

40|$|Recently, a {{significant}} amount of transverse wave energy has been estimated propagating along solar atmospheric magnetic fields. However, these estimates have been made with the classic bulk Alfvén wave model which assumes a homogeneous plasma. In this paper, the kinetic, magnetic, and <b>total</b> <b>energy</b> <b>densities</b> and the flux of energy are computed for transverse MHD waves in one-dimensional cylindrical flux tube models with a piecewise constant or continuous radial density profile. There are fundamental deviations from the properties for classic bulk Alfvén waves. (1) There is no local equipartition between kinetic and magnetic energy. (2) The flux of energy and the velocity of energy transfer have, in addition to a component parallel to the magnetic field, components in the planes normal to the magnetic field. (3) The <b>energy</b> <b>densities</b> and the flux of energy vary spatially, contrary to the case of classic bulk Alfvén waves. This last property has the important consequence that the energy flux computed with the well known expression for bulk Alfvén waves could overestimate the real flux by a factor in the range 10 - 50, depending on the flux tube equilibrium properties. status: publishe...|$|R
