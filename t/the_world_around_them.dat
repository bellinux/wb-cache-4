In literature, gods may appear to humans in a physical form, but in real life the Egyptians were limited to more indirect means of communication.|$|E
5|$|Legend of Mana, {{originally}} {{released in}} Japan as Seiken Densetsu: Legend of Mana, is a 1999 action role-playing game developed {{and published by}} Square (now Square Enix) for the PlayStation. It is the fourth game in the Mana series, following 1995's Seiken Densetsu 3. Set in a high fantasy universe, the game follows an unnamed hero as they restore the land of Fa'Diel by creating <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>around</b> <b>them</b> and completing a number of interrelated quests in order to restore the Tree of Mana.|$|E

40|$|The Permaculture Design Course is a three-credit {{course that}} offers {{students}} a foundation in permaculture history, ethics, principles, design process, and practical applications. The framework behind {{the theory and}} practice of permaculture is rooted in the observation of natural systems. By observing key ecological relationships, we can mimic and apply these beneficial relationships in the design of systems that serve humans while helping to restore <b>the</b> natural <b>world.</b> This course trains students as critical thinkers, observers, and analysts of <b>the</b> <b>world(s)</b> <b>around</b> <b>them,</b> and then goes on to provide students with the tools needed to design for inspired and positive change...|$|R
5|$|The trio {{explored}} <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>around</b> <b>them,</b> {{experiencing a}} second childhood with no wives, jobs, or responsibilities. They passed {{the time by}} speculating about their fellow townspeople and testing inventions. Regular subplots {{in the first decade}} of the show included: Sid and Ivy bickering over the management of the café, Mr Wainwright and Mrs Partridge having a secret love affair that everyone knows about, Wally trying to get away from Nora's watchful eye, Foggy's exaggerated war stories, and Compo's schemes to win the affections of Nora Batty.|$|E
5|$|From early on, {{children}} also assume that language {{is designed for}} communication. Infants treat communication as a cooperative process. Specifically, infants observe the principles of conventionality and contrast. According to conventionality, infants believe that for a particular meaning that they wish to convey, there is a term {{that everyone in the}} community would expect to be used. According to contrast, infants act according to the notion that differences in form mark differences in meaning. Children's attention to conventionality and contrast is demonstrated in their language use, even before the age of 2 years; they direct their early words towards adult targets, repair mispronunciations quickly if possible, ask for words to relate to <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>around</b> <b>them,</b> and maintain contrast in their own word use.|$|E
5|$|Sesame Street {{has been}} used to test the {{attention}} span of infants and toddlers. In 2004, children from three months to two years were shown Sesame Street clips and a group of computer-generated black and white patterns. Their attention spans, as determined by the duration of time they looked at the stimuli, significantly increased at six to twenty-four months, but only for the Sesame Street material. A study conducted in 2006 found that infants' attention span increased more when they were presented with video clips than with still images of the same stimuli, supporting the idea that movement helps young infants gain more information from <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>around</b> <b>them.</b> The evidence showed that attention span depended both on age and the on the type of stimuli children viewed. The time they looked at stimuli decreased for all types of stimuli from fourteen to twenty-six weeks, but the time they looked at it increased depending on the stimuli. When older infants (age fourteen weeks to twelve months) looked at Sesame Street materials and human faces, their attention increased compared to other types of stimuli.|$|E

40|$|Drawing {{primarily}} on the theoretical works of Sara Ahmed and Robin Bernstein, this paper explores how children’s complicity and victimhood in the wars within Caryl Churchill’s Far Away and Bertolt Brecht’s Mother Courage and Her Children become symbolic of humanity’s demise. The essay uses Far Away and Mother Courage as case studies to examine broader social scripts on childhood. The paper argues that the children in each play are characterized by social expectations that children {{are meant to be}} ignorant to <b>the</b> <b>worlds</b> <b>around</b> <b>them,</b> as well as embodiments of the hope that the future will be better than the present. Finally, this paper argues that social scripts of childhood ignorance and innocence place unrealistic expectations onto children that ultimately limit their agential choices...|$|R
25|$|A prayer {{group is}} a group of people that meet to pray together.

25|$|A few sociologists {{studying}} TCKs, however, {{argue that}} the commonality found in international TCKs is {{not the result of}} true commonality, but rather the researcher's bias projecting expectations upon the studied subculture.

25|$|The {{new style}} in English poetry during the 17th century {{was that of}} the metaphysical movement. The metaphysical poets were John Donne, George Herbert, Andrew Marvell and others.

The metaphysical poets were clearly trying to understand <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>around</b> <b>them</b> and the spirit behind it, instead of accepting dogma on the basis of faith.|$|E
5000|$|The Guardians of the Universe are one {{of several}} races that {{originated}} on the planet Maltus and {{were among the first}} intelligent life forms in the universe. At this time they were short greyish blue humanoids with black hair. They became scientists and thinkers, experimenting on <b>the</b> <b>worlds</b> <b>around</b> <b>them.</b> In a pivotal moment billions of years ago, a Maltusian named Krona used time-bending technology to observe the beginning of the universe. However, this experiment unleashed disaster upon all existence. Originally, the experiment splintered the universe into the multiverse and created the evil anti-matter universe. Following the retroactive destruction of the Multiverse, it was revealed that Krona flooded the beginning of the universe with entropy causing it [...] "to be born old".|$|R

Computer vision covers the core technology of automated image analysis which is used in many fields. Machine vision usually refers to a process of combining automated image analysis with other methods and technologies to provide automated inspection and robot guidance in industrial applications.|$|E
25|$|Suggested by Leon Festinger, {{cognitive}} dissonance occurs {{when an individual}} experiences some degree of discomfort resulting from an inconsistency between two cognitions: their views on <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>around</b> <b>them,</b> and their own personal feelings and actions. For example, a consumer may seek to reassure themselves regarding a purchase, feeling that another decision may have been preferable. Their feeling that another purchase would have been preferable is inconsistent with their action of purchasing the item. The difference between their feelings and beliefs causes dissonance, so they seek to reassure themselves.|$|E
25|$|For Marx and Engels, then, {{the ruling}} classes control the {{subordinate}} classes through {{domination of the}} ideas available in the culture. In this way the subordinate classes {{are said to be}} mediated by the effects of ideology, or “false consciousness” or a belief system that doesn’t allow them to see the oppression they are enduring for what it is. The problem with this idea, as many Marxists have noted, is that it doesn’t leave room for members of the subordinate classes to act on <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>around</b> <b>them</b> through alternate forms of mediation.|$|E
