2500|$|Paul, {{was asked}} a {{hypothetical}} question at a Tea Party debate by CNN host Wolf Blitzer about how society should respond if a healthy 30-year-old man who decided against buying health insurance suddenly requires intensive care for six months. Paul said it shouldn't be the government's responsibility. [...] "That's what freedom is all about, taking your own risks," [...] Paul said. Paul mentioned {{he does not}} believe society should let the aforementioned hypothetical man die but emphasized that churches and communities – rather than governments – should <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> in need.|$|E
6000|$|His {{face was}} like {{the face of the}} impenetrable sphinx; his deep bass voice droned placidly. Ovid's anger had passed by him like the passing of the summer air. [...] "Good-bye!" [...] he said; [...] "and <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> nasty nerves. I tell you again--they mean mischief." ...|$|E
60|$|Ten miles farther, {{he arrived}} at the first {{outlying}} station. The owner of this had not joined in the expedition, being a married man, and unwilling to leave his wife in such an exposed position. But upon Reuben's arrival he at once agreed to lend him two fresh horses, and to <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> which Reuben brought with him.|$|E

50|$|Calaveras {{still has}} its folk influences, {{but on the}} {{contrary}} to ´Toca y obliga´ where that was shown with {{the music of the}} bandoneon now it was the drums that <b>took</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> features with rhythms varying from chacarera and malambo to plain rock and roll, but still the milonga and tango were present in their compositions.|$|R

"Yes," [...] said Ethel; [...] "and {{then when}} papa {{told him that}} {{beautiful}} history of Dr. Spencer going to <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> poor emigrants in the fever, {{what do you think}} he said? 'Yes, Spencer was always doing extravagant things.' Fancy that to papa, who can hardly speak of it without having to wipe his spectacles, and who so longs to hear of Dr. Spencer." ...|$|E
60|$|NICHOLLS. Yes. She {{had a job}} as stenographer for a time. When she {{graduated}} from the business college course--I was already working at the Downs--and through my father's influence--you understand. (Gaynor nods curtly.) She was getting on finely, too, and liked the work. It's too bad--her mother's death, I mean--forcing her {{to give it up}} and come home to <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> kids.|$|E
60|$|Then {{came that}} day when my Lord Cornwallis led his red-coated men into James Town itself, and we found {{ourselves}} not only surrounded by these soldiers of the king, but literally over-run by them. So high and mighty was his majesty's officer that he quartered his soldiers here, there, or in the other place, at whatsoever house pleased his fancy, insisting that we Virginians who claimed we {{had the right to}} break off from the mother country, should <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> who had come to shoot us down.|$|E
50|$|Antoine Petit {{amassed a}} {{significant}} wealth then, {{because he had}} no child, spent a part to found places that accord medical treatment. He spent more than 100,000 French livres to Orléans city: he appointed four physicians and two surgeons for free health care for sick people and those in every kind of need, in a house he built in this purpose. On market days, they <b>took</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> from the country.|$|R
60|$|And I {{must say}} also that Mr. Burns' {{intolerable}} fussing with those potatoes was not calculated {{to make me}} forget the part which I had played. He looked upon it as a purely commercial transaction of a particularly foolish kind, and his devotion--if it was devotion and not mere cussedness as I came to regard it before long--inspired him with a zeal to minimise my loss as much as possible. Oh, yes! He <b>took</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> infamous potatoes with a vengeance, as the saying goes.|$|R

6000|$|... 130. Chairman. Do you not {{consider}} {{that it is}} rather prejudicial to art {{that there should be a}} Gallery notoriously containing no first-rate works of art, but second-rate or third-rate works?--No; I think it rather valuable as an expression of the means of education, that there should be early lessons in art--that there should be this sort of art selected especially for first studies, and also that there should be a recognition of the exceeding preciousness of some other art. I think that portions of it should be set aside as interesting, but not unreplaceable; but that other portions should be set aside as being things as to which the function of the nation was, chiefly, to <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> things, not for itself merely, but for all its descendants, and setting the example of taking care of them for ever.|$|E
60|$|Mr Sparkler's lordship was {{fortunately}} one {{of those}} shelves on which a gentleman {{is considered to be}} put away for life, unless there should be reasons for hoisting him up with the Barnacle crane to a more lucrative height. That patriotic servant accordingly stuck to his colours (the Standard of four Quarterings), and was a perfect Nelson in respect of nailing them to the mast. On the profits of his intrepidity, Mrs Sparkler and Mrs Merdle, inhabiting different floors of the genteel little temple of inconvenience to which the smell of the day before yesterday's soup and coach-horses was as constant as Death to man, arrayed themselves to fight it out in the lists of Society, sworn rivals. And Little Dorrit, seeing all these things as they developed themselves, could not but wonder, anxiously, into what back corner of the genteel establishment Fanny's children would be poked by-and-by, and who would <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> unborn little victims.|$|E
60|$|At {{last the}} {{preparations}} were complete and orders were issued for the advance to begin on the 8th of March. General Taylor had {{an army of}} not more than three thousand men. One battery, the siege guns and all the convalescent troops were sent on by water to Brazos Santiago, {{at the mouth of}} the Rio Grande. A guard was left back at Corpus Christi to look after public property and to <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> who were too sick to be removed. The remainder of the army, probably not more than twenty five hundred men, was divided into three brigades, with the cavalry independent. Colonel Twiggs, with seven companies of dragoons and a battery of light artillery, moved on the 8th. He was followed by the three infantry brigades, with a day's interval between the commands. Thus the rear brigade did not move from Corpus Christi until the 11th of March. In view of the immense bodies of men moved on the same day over narrow roads, through dense forests and across large streams, in our late war, it seems strange now that a body of less than three thousand men should have been broken into four columns, separated by a day's march.|$|E
50|$|After {{his release}} from prison, Okazaki entered the lumber {{business}} in Matsue City. He <b>took</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> who had been imprisoned for the war. A right-wing organization, Seinen Kodotai (Young Pro-emperor organization) formed with him as its leader. In December 1956, the National Union (of right wing organizations) was formed with him {{as the leader of}} the Shimane Branch. The group never had more than a small following. In 1961, Okazaki established the juridical educational organization, Shona Gakuen, and assumed the post of director. In 1968, he ran unsuccessfully for the Upper House in the Diet of Japan.|$|R
5000|$|One after another, he rescued wounded {{people from}} the zone of gunfire and {{returned}} again under bullets, demonstrating extraordinary heroism. According to Russian sources, he has rescued 12 people. As friend of him said, [...] "He was always a risky person, and <b>took</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> in hard situations." [...] The last person who Duncan attempted to save was an injured photo reporter of the New York Times newspaper, Otto Pohl, but a sniper from the TV center building shot Duncan in the head (according to a different source, Duncan was killed by [...] "a casual bullet").|$|R

6000|$|He {{was turned}} {{out of the}} house, {{together}} with Syddall, without being allowed to conclude his lamentation. His expulsion, however, led to some singular consequences. Resolving, according to his own story, to go down for the night where Mother Simpson {{would give him a}} lodging for old acquaintance' sake, he had just got clear of the avenue, and into the old wood, as it was called, though it was now used as a pasture-ground rather than woodland, when he suddenly lighted on a drove of Scotch cattle, which were lying there to repose themselves after the day's journey. At this Andrew was in no way surprised, it being the well-known custom of his countrymen, who <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> droves, to quarter themselves after night upon the best unenclosed grass-ground they can find, and depart before day-break to escape paying for their night's lodgings. But he was both surprised and startled, when a Highlander, springing up, accused him of disturbing the cattle, and refused him to pass forward till he had spoken to his master. The mountaineer conducted Andrew into a thicket, where he found three or four more of his countrymen. [...] "And," [...] said Andrew, [...] "I saw sune they were ower mony men for the drove; and from the questions they put to me, I judged they had other tow on their rock." ...|$|E

50|$|As {{awareness}} of identity theft and data breaches became more widespread, new {{laws and regulations}} were enacted, requiring companies that manage or store personally identifiable information to <b>take</b> proper <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> documents.

50|$|The term's {{applicability}} to {{the politicians}} originates from the Russian word khozyain (of a household), usually the oldest male entrusted with {{the welfare of}} the family.

5000|$|Bigby {{described}} Governor Edwin Washington Edwards, under whose administration Bigby {{served the}} bulk of his time as a representative, accordingly: [...] "Edwin and I have a philosophical difference over the role of government.

40|$|In 1996 Japan {{had a big}} {{outbreak}} of enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) O 157 :H 7, especially in Osaka prefecture where about 6000 patients (mainly schoolchildren) suffered from diarrhoea, haemorrhagic colitis and haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) due to EHEC infection via school lunch. Our survey <b>of</b> doctors who <b>took</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> patients showed that most patients had received antibiotics, especially fosfomycin which comprised 84 % of the prescribed treatment. Since the administration of antibiotics for EHEC infection is under discussion, we analysed the effect of fosfomycin on production/release of verotoxins (VTs). Addition of fosfomycin into EHEC culture in CAYE broth at 2 and 5 h after start of incubation caused marked increase of VT 1 release. This observation warns {{of the possibility of}} fosfomycin treatment making the disease worse...|$|R

40|$|The {{number of}} mobile devices and their users is {{increasing}} {{on day to}} day basis. Games and other multimedia contents on smart phones and tablets raised children's attention on a large scale. Primary schools could trigger the pupils’ interest by learning also through new, interesting, and playful methods. In the thesis, an application for mobile devices with Android operating system which enables exercises in spelling is presented. There are several possibilities of problem-solving; the most interesting includes the use of accelerometer where tilting of the device makes content to move on the screen. Besides spelling book, a website is also available for users to exercise and for teachers to make new exercises. Therefore, it is also <b>taken</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> who do not have an appropriate mobile device. Using text saving formats set in advance, teachers can create exercises which will trigger more attention of children. ...|$|R

60|$|The {{first day}} they were very active, pottering about with hammers and nails and red calico, to put up curtains, make their house {{habitable}} and pretty; resolved to settle down comfortably to their new life. For them an impossible task. To grapple effectually with even purely material problems requires more serenity of mind and more lofty courage than people generally imagine. No two beings {{could have been more}} unfitted for such a struggle. Society, not from any tenderness, but because of its strange needs, had <b>taken</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> two men, forbidding them all independent thought, all initiative, all departure from routine; and forbidding it under pain of death. They could only live on condition of being machines. And now, released from the fostering <b>care</b> <b>of</b> men with pens behind the ears, or of men with gold lace on the sleeves, they were like those lifelong prisoners who, liberated after many years, do not know what use to make of their freedom. They did not know what use to make of their faculties, being both, through want of practice, incapable of independent thought.|$|R
