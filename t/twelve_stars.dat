5|$|Lacaille gave <b>twelve</b> <b>stars</b> Bayer designations, {{labelling}} them Alpha {{through to}} Kappa, including two stars {{next to each}} other as Delta and another two stars near each other as Kappa. Within the constellation's borders, there are 39 stars brighter than or equal to apparent magnitude6.5. Beta, Gamma and Delta Apodis form a narrow triangle, with Alpha Apodis lying to the east. The five brightest stars are all red-tinged, which is unusual among constellations.|$|E
5|$|Keyser and de Houtman {{assigned}} <b>twelve</b> <b>stars</b> to the constellation. Bayer depicted Grus on his chart, {{but did not}} assign its stars Bayer designations. French explorer and astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille labelled them Alpha to Phi in 1756 {{with some}} omissions. In 1879, American astronomer Benjamin Gould added Kappa, Nu, Omicron and Xi, which had all been catalogued by Lacaille but not given Bayer designations. Lacaille considered them too faint, while Gould thought otherwise. Xi Gruis had originally been placed in Microscopium. Conversely, Gould dropped Lacaille's Sigma as {{he thought it was}} too dim.|$|E

25|$|The {{number of}} stars began at six and {{increased}} with {{the membership of}} the Community until 1986 when it reached twelve. After this it was decided not {{to increase the number of}} stars to reflect the new members joining in the 1990s. This kept it inline with the flag of Europe (used by its sister organisations) which displayed <b>twelve</b> <b>stars</b> representing perfection and unity.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{arguments}} by many Pentecostal,Protestant {{and a few}} {{churches that}} say that that Mother Mary isn't depicted as the 'Queen of Heaven and the world' in the Bible.The Catholic Church and many others point out the verses from the Book of Revelations in Chapter 12 which states clearly Mother Mary as a Queen, with a crown of <b>twelve</b> <b>stars</b> and the Moon under her feet and cloaked with the Sun.|$|E

25|$|Metaxa {{comes in}} nine major varieties: Three Stars, Five Stars, Five Stars Honey Shot, Seven Stars, <b>Twelve</b> <b>stars,</b> Grande Fine, Private Reserve, Angels Treasure and AEN. The number of stars {{represents}} {{the number of}} years the blend is matured. The three and 5 star are not as different, but the 5 star is notably drier, making the alcohol more pronounced. The seven and twelve star are more flavoursome and complex, while the Twelve-star G.O.R. is again more dry, in this case because there is no addition of wine. In either of the two latter varieties, the smell and taste of the barrel in which the brandy matured is noticeable. The house of Metaxa has recently launched a new product, the Metaxa Twelve Star containing distillates matured for 12 years adding Muscat wine from the island of Samos, unlike the Metaxa <b>Twelve</b> <b>Stars</b> Grand Olympian Reserve. Metaxa Private Reserve is the most oldest member of Metaxa family. Only 5.000 numbered decanters of Metaxa Private Reserve are on the market containing distillates aged for 30 years from Spyros Metaxas' family barrels.|$|E
25|$|Guadalajara's {{current crest}} was {{designed}} in 1923 and uses as its base, {{the crest of}} the city of Guadalajara, Jalisco. The crest was then complemented with a blue circle and the words Club Deportivo Guadalajara, five red stripes and six white stripes, eventual colours that were adopted by the team, and <b>twelve</b> <b>stars</b> representing each championship the team has won. The actual crest design is credited to brothers Everardo and Jose Espinosa, Angel Bolumar, and Antonio Villalvazo, all of whom were players or directors of the team during that time.|$|E
25|$|The Star of David is {{also used}} less {{prominently}} by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, in the temples and in architecture. It symbolizes God reaching down to man and man reaching up to God, the union of Heaven and earth. It may also symbolize the Tribes of Israel and friendship and their affinity towards the Jewish people. Additionally, it is sometimes used to symbolize the quorum of the twelve apostles, as in Revelation 12, wherein the Church of God is symbolized by a woman wearing a crown of <b>twelve</b> <b>stars.</b> It is also sometimes used to symbolize the Big Dipper, which points to the North Star, a symbol of Jesus Christ.|$|E

25|$|Votive offerings {{became a}} tradition. They are usually small silver objects (hearts, crucifixes, figures of praying people, images of cured eyes, legs, arms). Several times (1799, 1808, 1810) {{some of these}} objects were taken down and melted into liturgical objects. In 1844 there was a total of 785 offerings. Twelve years later, in 1856, the number had almost doubled to 1,438. From 1884 to 1927 a journal of new offerings was kept. During that time 2,539 new gifts were registered. Currently, there are about 8,000 silver votive objects in the chapel. The large {{crescent}} moon located right beneath Our Lady is also a votive offering. Its origins are unknown but it bears an inscription in Polish and a date of 1849. The crescent goes well with the silver cloth, adding additional parallels with the Woman of the Apocalypse, described in the Book of Revelation as a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of <b>twelve</b> <b>stars.</b>|$|E
500|$|In {{defining}} the constellation, Lacaille gave <b>twelve</b> <b>stars</b> Bayer designations of Alpha through to Lambda, with two close stars called Eta (one now {{known by its}} Henry Draper catalogue number), while Lambda was later dropped due to its dimness. The three brightest stars, Alpha, Beta and Gamma, make up the triangle. Readily identified by its orange hue, Alpha Trianguli Australis is a bright giant star of spectral type K2IIb-IIIa with an apparent magnitude of +1.91 that is the 42nd-brightest star in the night sky. It lies [...] away and has an absolute magnitude of −3.68 and is 5,500 times more luminous than our Sun. With a diameter 130 times that of our Sun, it would almost reach the orbit of Venus if placed at {{the centre of the}} Solar System. The proper name Atria is a contraction of its Bayer designation. Beta Trianguli Australis is a double star, the primary being a [...] F-type main-sequence star with a stellar classification of F1V, and an apparent magnitude of 2.85. Lying only [...] away, it has an absolute magnitude of 2.38. Its companion, almost 3 arcminutes away, is a 13th-magnitude star {{which may or may not}} be in orbit around Beta. The remaining member of the triangle is Gamma Trianguli Australis with an apparent magnitude of 2.87. It is an A-type main sequence star of spectral class A1V, which lies [...] away.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{symbol of}} Interlingua is a globe {{surrounded}} by <b>twelve</b> <b>stars</b> {{on a black}} or blue background, echoing the <b>twelve</b> <b>stars</b> of the Flag of Europe (because the source languages of Interlingua are purely European).

2500|$|Dispensational Premillennialists, and Amillennialists {{who believe}} in {{multiple}} valid interpretations will often identify the woman as the nation of Israel. There are several reasons given to support this interpretation. The woman {{is said to be}} clothed with the sun, the moon under her feet, and <b>twelve</b> <b>stars.</b> These symbols are drawn from Genesis 37:9–11, in which Joseph has a dream of the sun and moon symbolizing his father and mother, and stars representing his eleven brothers, which bow down to him. The Old Testament's prophets referred to Israel as a [...] "woman" [...] (Isaiah 54:5-6; Jeremiah 4:31; Micah 4:9-10).|$|E
