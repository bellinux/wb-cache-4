He hallucinates a mysterious person he believes {{is one of the}} three murderers of his parents.

5|$|After {{completing}} 100% Love (2011), Sukumar {{began working}} on a psychological thriller with Mahesh Babu in mind as the protagonist because he felt that Mahesh had universal appeal. An incident in which a bus driver talked about a young boy who said <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>parents</b> were murdered on his bus became the story's base. Mahesh met Sukumar {{on the set of}} Businessman (2012) in Goa, and listened to the script for 25 minutes. Although Sukumar could not describe the story well in the noisy restaurant, Mahesh agreed to appear in the film within half an hour. Sukumar worked on 1:Nenokkadine script for two months, and considered it his dream project.|$|E
5|$|Gunn made six full {{international}} appearances for Scotland, conceding 10 goals. He was {{a member}} of the squad for the 1990 FIFA World Cup, but played in none of Scotland's three matches at the tournament, as he was third-choice goalkeeper behind Jim Leighton and Andy Goram. He made his Scotland debut in a pre-tournament friendly match against Egypt, but was at fault for two Egyptian goals, resulting in a 3–1 defeat for Scotland. The embarrassment was made worse by the fact <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>parents</b> were watching. Gunn made four appearances for Scotland in 1994 FIFA World Cup qualification matches. His last cap was as a second-half substitute in a 3–1 friendly defeat by the Netherlands in May 1994.|$|E

It was filmed in London, Belfast, Bangkok and Indian cities including Hyderabad, Mumbai, Goa, Chennai and Bangalore.|$|E
6000|$|Tom did not see, {{but he did}} not say so. Not a {{word had}} been said about Mr. Rover and his interest-- Mr. Pelter ignored Tom's father entirely. And yet the youth knew <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>parent</b> had fifty {{thousand}} dollars or more tied up in that very company! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't Fred get {{half the}} thrashing?" [...] {{questioned}} Randy Rover, quizzically, for he could readily see <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>parent</b> {{was not as}} angry as his words seemed to imply. [...] "I don't like to be selfish, you know. He can have {{more than his share}} if he wants it." ...|$|R
60|$|The youth {{found his}} father at the rooms in the Outlook Hotel, he having promised to remain there until Sam returned, or Dick arrived. Mr. Rover looked much careworn, and Dick {{realized}} more than ever <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>parent</b> was in no physical or mental condition to transact business.|$|R
5|$|The {{scene at}} St Mungo's, the {{hospital}} where Harry and friends run into classmate Neville Longbottom and learn <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>parents</b> were tortured into insanity by Bellatrix Lestrange, was cut because it required {{the construction of a}} new set. The main purpose of the action of the scene was relocated to the Room of Requirement after one of Dumbledore's Army's lessons. Also, to speed up the film's climax, several events in the Ministry leading up to Harry's battle with Voldemort were removed, including the brain room. Mrs. Weasley's encounter with a boggart at Grimmauld Place, Ron, Hermione and Malfoy becoming prefects, the appearance of Mundungus Fletcher, and Firenze teaching Divination followed suit.|$|E
5|$|Verdi had {{a younger}} sister, Giuseppa, who died aged 17 in 1833. From {{the age of}} four, Verdi was given private lessons in Latin and Italian by the village schoolmaster, Baistrocchi, and at six he {{attended}} the local school. After learning to play the organ, he showed so much interest in music <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>parents</b> finally provided him with a spinet. Verdi's gift for music was already apparent by 1820–21 when he began his association with the local church, serving in the choir, acting as an altar boy for a while, and taking organ lessons. After Baistrocchi's death, Verdi, {{at the age of}} eight, became the official paid organist.|$|E
5|$|Accompanied by Brady, Hindley {{approached}} 12-year-old John Kilbride in {{the early}} evening of 23 November 1963, at a market in Ashton-under-Lyne and offered him a lift home on the pretext <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>parents</b> would be worried about him being out so late. With the added inducement of a bottle of sherry, Kilbride readily agreed to get into the Ford Anglia car that Hindley had hired. Brady told Kilbride that the sherry was at their home, and they would have to make a detour to collect it. On the way he suggested that they take another detour, to search for a glove he said that Hindley had lost on the moor. When they reached the moor Brady took the child with him while Hindley waited in the car. Brady sexually assaulted Kilbride and attempted to slit his throat with a six-inch serrated blade before fatally strangling him with a piece of string, possibly a shoelace.|$|E

5|$|Bamber {{visited the}} farm {{on the evening}} of Tuesday, 6 August. He told the court <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>parents</b> {{suggested}} to Sheila that evening that the boys be placed in day-time foster care with a local family. Bamber said Sheila did not seem bothered by the suggestion and had simply said she would rather stay in London. The boys had been in foster care before, although in London rather than near White House Farm, and it had not appeared to cause a problem for Sheila. Her psychiatrist, Dr. Ferguson, told the Court of Appeal in 2002 that any suggestion that the children be removed from her care would have provoked a strong reaction from Sheila, but that she might have welcomed daytime help.|$|E
5|$|Edgardo {{was visited}} {{by his father}} several times under the {{supervision}} of the rector of the Catechumens, Enrico Sarra, from mid-August to mid-September 1858. The wildly divergent accounts of what happened during these encounters grew into two rival narratives of the entire case. Momolo's version of events, favoured by the Jewish community and other backers, was that a family had been destroyed by the government's religious fanaticism, that helpless Edgardo had spent the journey to Rome crying for his parents, and that the boy wanted nothing more than to return home. The narrative favoured by the Church and its supporters, and propagated in the Catholic press throughout Europe, was one of divinely ordained, soul-stirring redemption, and a child endowed with spiritual strength far beyond his years—the neophyte Edgardo had faced a life of error followed by eternal damnation but now stood to share in Christian salvation, and was distraught <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>parents</b> would not convert with him.|$|E
5|$|In Hyderabad, Gautham accidentally spoils Sameera's {{birthday}} plans, infuriating her. Although he {{is convinced}} {{that he has made}} up an enemy to cope with being an orphan, a mysterious person tries to kill Sameera. Gautham saves her and proposes marriage, which she accepts. Sameera learns that the mysterious person is Antonio Rosarios, a Goa-based crime boss who wants to kill her because she tried to expose the presence of hydrogen cyanide in seeds sold by Rosarios' company, AG1. Gautham meets Rosarios in the lobby of Sameera's office building. Assuming that he is an illusion, he shoots Rosarios in his head. By the time Gautham realises Rosarios is real he is dead, and Gautham learns <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>parents</b> were murdered. He catches an aged taxi driver who was stalking him (one of the three men he imagined), and learns that two London-based Indians (one of whom was Rosarios) killed his parents; his father gave the taxi driver a bag to give to Gautham. In the bag is an old Rubik's Cube, a key and a British coin.|$|E
50|$|The series {{takes place}} in 18th century England. After Dick Turpin, {{the son of a}} farmer, returns to England after three years {{military}} service in the Mediterranean, he discovers <b>that</b> he and <b>his</b> <b>parents</b> have been cheated out of their farm and his inheritance by the unscrupulous Sir John Glutton, and <b>that</b> consequently <b>his</b> <b>parents</b> have died of starvation.

5|$|In {{his search}} for the lime, Scott discovers a strange, {{swirling}} cloud of dust that absorbs moisture. He follows it until he collapses {{in front of a}} lake bed. He has a brief hallucination where he engages in a spiritual conversation with a priest he knew on Earth. Meanwhile, the cloud moves up to him and condenses into water, waking him. Realizing what he's found, Scott shovels as much of the lime as possible into his bag and makes his way to the Gate. Greer, having set out to look for him, finds him along the way and helps carry the lime. Wallace sticks his arm into the wormhole to delay the countdown. The team returns with the lime successfully, which is used to repair the CO2 scrubbers. In the end, a recovering Scott tells Chloe <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>parents</b> and the priest died when he was young, and {{that the best way to}} deal with the grief is to keep moving forward. As everyone starts to breathe easier, a ship detaches itself from the Destiny.|$|E
5|$|Terry-Thomas {{was born}} Thomas Terry Hoar Stevens at 53 Lichfield Grove, Finchley, North London. He {{was the third}} of four {{children}} born to Ernest Frederick Stevens, managing director of a butcher's business at Smithfield Market and part-time amateur actor, and his wife Ellen Elizabeth Stevens (née Hoar). As a child, Terry-Thomas was {{often referred to as}} Tom, the diminutive used by his family. He led a generally happy childhood, but believed <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>parents</b> secretly desired a daughter in his place. By the time he reached adolescence, his parents' marriage had failed and both became alcoholics. In an attempt to bring them together, Terry-Thomas often entertained them by performing impromptu slapstick routines, reciting jokes and singing and dancing around the family home. The performances seldom worked, and his father became increasingly removed from his family. His parents had divorced by the 1920s.|$|E
5|$|After fans likened Naruto, Sasuke Uchiha and Sakura Haruno to {{the three}} main {{characters}} from Harry Potter fantasy books, Kishimoto noted that both trios began their careers in a classroom, though {{he added that the}} similarity was unintentional. During the series' publication, Kishimoto married and had children. This influenced how he viewed Naruto's character. Naruto met his parents, and learned of their sacrifices in order to help him to control the Fox inside him so that he could protect their world. As a result, Naruto appreciated his life more and learned <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>parents</b> loved him, something the author wanted the character to feel based on his own experience as a father. In the first chapters of the series, Kishimoto did not conceive the idea that Naruto would be the son of Minato Namikaze. However, as time passed on, the manga author made touches to Minato's face shown in the Hokage Mountain in Konoha to make them more similar to Naruto with an emphasis on their spiky hairs. However, in order to reduce too many similarities, Kushina Uzumaki's character was made to look like Naruto's face. Kishimoto's first editor, Kosuke Yahagi, praised the author for the way he handled Naruto's parents and his heritage.|$|E

5|$|Seetharamudu was a {{barrister}} {{who returned}} from London upon his father's death to manage his family businesses. He was a zamindar and {{was fond of}} cars. In one such instance, he sees a poor farmer called Ramalakshmi and decides to marry her. Asked by a mediator, she accepts the proposal, without meeting Seetharamudu, but asks him for six months' delay as she has to buy new clothes for the bridegroom, following the village's tradition. Seetharamudu learns about this and meets her as a reformed thief. With his help, Ramalakshmi could cultivate enough grain in three months and buy new clothes with that money. On the day of marriage, she is surprised to know that Seetharamudu is her chosen groom and they marry. On 14 February 1924 the couple goes out, but Chaitanya, suffering from fever then, fakes a stomach ache so <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>parents</b> return.

Now he aims to reunite them without letting them recollect their past as they cannot bear the pain of losing him.|$|E
5|$|The couple moved {{repeatedly}} {{over the}} following year – first to Laguna Beach, California, then to Santa Catalina Island, California, New York City, Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania and ultimately to Hubbard's first wife's home at South Colby, Washington. Polly Hubbard had filed for divorce {{on the grounds of}} desertion and non-support, and was not even aware that Hubbard was living with Northrup, let alone that he had married her. The arrival of Hubbard and Northrup three weeks after the divorce was filed scandalized Hubbard's family, who deeply disapproved of his treatment of Polly. Northrup had no idea of Hubbard's first marriage or why people were treating her so strangely until his son L. Ron Hubbard Jr. told her <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>parents</b> were still married. She attempted to flee on a ferry but Hubbard caught up with her and convinced her to stay, saying {{that he was in the}} process of getting a divorce and that an attorney had told him that the marriage with Northrup was legal. The couple moved to a rented trailer in North Hollywood in July 1947, where Hubbard spent much of his time writing stories for pulp magazines.|$|E
5|$|Vargas Llosa {{lived with}} his {{maternal}} family in Arequipa until a year after his parents' divorce, when his maternal grandfather was named honorary consul for Peru in Bolivia. With his mother and her family, Vargas Llosa then moved to Cochabamba, Bolivia, where he spent {{the early years of}} his childhood. His maternal family, the Llosas, were sustained by his grandfather, who managed a cotton farm. As a child, Vargas Llosa was led to believe that his father had died—his mother and her family did not want to explain <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>parents</b> had separated. During the government of Peruvian President José Bustamante y Rivero, Vargas Llosa's maternal grandfather obtained a diplomatic post in the northern Peruvian coastal city of Piura and the entire family returned to Peru. While in Piura, Vargas Llosa attended elementary school at the religious academy Colegio Salesiano. In 1946, at the age of ten, he moved to Lima and met his father for the first time. His parents re-established their relationship and lived in Magdalena del Mar, a middle-class Lima suburb, during his teenage years. While in Lima, he studied at the Colegio La Salle, a Christian middle school, from 1947 to 1949.|$|E
