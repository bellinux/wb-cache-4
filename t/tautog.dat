6000|$|Pray, pray, Judge Pyncheon, {{look at your}} watch, Now! What--not a glance! It {{is within}} ten minutes of the dinner hour! It surely cannot have slipped your memory that the dinner of to-day {{is to be the}} most important, in its consequences, of all the dinners you ever ate. Yes, {{precisely}} the most important; although, in the course of your somewhat eminent career, you have been placed high towards the head of the table, at splendid banquets, and have poured out your festive eloquence to ears yet echoing with Webster's mighty organ-tones. No public dinner this, however. It is merely a gathering of some dozen or so of friends from several districts of the State; men of distinguished character and influence, assembling, almost casually, at the house of a common friend, likewise distinguished, who will make them welcome to a little better than his ordinary fare. Nothing in the way of French cookery, but an excellent dinner, nevertheless. Real turtle, we understand, and salmon, <b>tautog,</b> canvas-backs, pig, English mutton, good roast beef, or dainties of that serious kind, fit for substantial country gentlemen, as these honorable persons mostly are. The delicacies of the season, in short, and flavored by a brand of old Madeira which has been the pride of many seasons. It is the Juno brand; a glorious wine, fragrant, and full of gentle might; a bottled-up happiness, put by for use; a golden liquid, worth more than liquid gold; so rare and admirable, that veteran wine-bibbers count it among their epochs to have tasted it! It drives away the heart-ache, and substitutes no head-ache! Could the Judge but quaff a glass, it might enable him to shake off the unaccountable lethargy which (for the ten intervening minutes, and five to boot, are already past) has made him such a laggard at this momentous dinner. It would all but revive a dead man! Would you like to sip it now, Judge Pyncheon? ...|$|E
60|$|Well; it is {{absolutely}} too late for dinner! Turtle, salmon, <b>tautog,</b> woodcock, boiled turkey, South-Down mutton, pig, roast-beef, have vanished, or exist only in fragments, with lukewarm potatoes, and gravies crusted over with cold fat. The Judge, had he done nothing else, would have achieved wonders with his knife and fork. It was he, you know, of whom {{it used to be}} said, in reference to his ogre-like appetite, that his Creator made him a great animal, but that the dinner-hour made him a great beast. Persons of his large sensual endowments must claim indulgence, at their feeding-time. But, for once, the Judge is entirely too late for dinner! Too late, we fear, even to join the party at their wine! The guests are warm and merry; they have given up the Judge; and, concluding that the Free-Soilers have him, they will fix upon another candidate. Were our friend now to stalk in among them, with that wide-open stare, at once wild and stolid, his ungenial presence would be apt to change their cheer. Neither would it be seemly in Judge Pyncheon, generally so scrupulous in his attire, to show himself at a dinner-table with that crimson stain upon his shirt-bosom. By the bye, how came it there? It is an ugly sight, at any rate; and the wisest way for the Judge is to button his coat closely over his breast, and, taking his horse and chaise from the livery stable, to make all speed to his own house. There, after a glass of brandy and water, and a mutton-chop, a beefsteak, a broiled fowl, or some such hasty little dinner and supper all in one, he had better spend the evening by the fireside. He must toast his slippers a long while, in order {{to get rid of the}} chilliness which the air of this vile old house has sent curdling through his veins.|$|E

40|$|We {{assessed}} the potential effects of entrainment and impingement at the Charles Poletti Power Project (hereafter, Poletti) on fish stocks of the New York-New Jersey (NY-NJ) Harbor Estuary and Long Island Sound by (1) estimating, for five fish stocks, the conditional mortality rate (CMR) for entrainment of eggs, larvae, and young-of-the-year (age- 0) {{fish and the}} CMR for impingement of age- 0 fish, and (2) for two of those stocks, using the CMR estimates to calculate the proportional reduction in biomass of spawners from an unfished stock under equilibrium conditions. Estimates of entrainment CMR for eggs and larvae were low and ranged from 0. 02 % for <b>tautogs</b> Tautoga onitis to 0. 11 % for Atlantic menhaden Brevoortia tyrannus, based on the spatial and temporal distribution of those life stages in the NY-NJ Harbor Estuary and Long Island Sound study area and the probabilities of entrainment generated by a particle tracking model, coupled with a three-dimensional estuarine circulation model that simulated the transport of ichthyoplankton. Estimates of entrainment CMR for age- 0 fish were low and ranged from 0. 00 % for <b>tautogs</b> and winter flounder Pscudopleuronectes americanus (none were collected in entrainment samples) to 0. 11 % for cunners Tautogolabrus adspersus, based on age- 0 numbers entrained and standing crop estimates. Impingement CNIRs ranged from 0. 00 % for windowpanes Scophthalmus aquosus (none were impinged) to 0. 80 % for <b>tautogs.</b> The proportional reduction in the biomass of spawners from an unfished stock would increase only 0. 09 % for winter flounder and 0. 01 % for Atlantic menhaden {{as a result of}} entrainment and impingement at Poletti.

50|$|Attack {{submarine}} training, independent ships exercises, inspections, and evaluations, all {{conducted in}} the Hawaiian Islands operating area, consumed <b>Tautogs</b> energies {{through the end of}} 1976. She did not deploy overseas again until the beginning of 1977, when she got underway for a goodwill visit to Mombasa, Kenya. Departing Pearl Harbor on 3 January 1977, she reached Mombasa on 24 January 1977 and remained there for a month while her crew saw the sights and she received visitors on board.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tautogs</b> first war patrol {{began on}} 26 December 1941 {{and took her}} to the Marshall Islands for {{reconnaissance}} work. After 26 days in the area gathering information, particularly of Kwajalein, she reported no enemy activity at Rongelop, Bat, Wotho, or Bikini. On 13 January 1942, she launched three torpedoes at a small minelayer, receiving a depth charging in return. Plagued by a fogging periscope, she returned to Pearl Harbor on 4 February and was routed to Mare Island for upkeep.|$|R
50|$|Popular among fishermen, <b>tautog</b> have a {{reputation}} for being a particularly tricky fish to catch. Part of this is because of their tendency to live among rocks and other structures that can cause a fisherman’s line to get snagged. The favorite baits for <b>tautog</b> include green crabs, Asian shore crabs, fiddler crabs, clams, shrimp, mussels, sandworms, and lobsters. <b>Tautog</b> fishing may also be difficult due to the tendency of fishermen try to set the hook as soon as they feel a hit, rather than wait for the <b>tautog</b> to swallow the bait. Rigs with minimal beads, swivels and hooks should be used to prevent entanglement with the rocks, reefs or wrecks that <b>tautog</b> frequent.|$|E
5000|$|Shortly {{after her}} {{arrival in the}} Marshalls, <b>Tautog</b> was ordered to Truk to {{intercept}} ships returning from the Battle of the Coral Sea, especially the Japanese aircraft carriers Zuikauku and Shōkaku (the latter codenamed [...] "Wounded Bear"); because Pearl Harbor underestimated Shōkakus speed, <b>Tautog</b> and two compatriots arrived too late and did not see Shōkaku depart, on 11 or 12 May. South of the harbor, <b>Tautog</b> launched two torpedoes at Goyo Maru, scoring one hit and suffering a circular run (typical of the erratic Mark XIV torpedo), forcing <b>Tautog</b> deep. (Goyo Maru beached herself.) Two days later, <b>Tautog</b> was alerted by ULTRA of four Japanese submarines in the vicinity, also returning from battle. She was caught by surprise by the first, and failed to attack. She detected and fired two torpeodes at the second. Although the Japanese boat was not in sight when <b>Tautog</b> surfaced, she was not officially credited with a sinking. Later in the morning, <b>Tautog</b> sighted another submarine with the designation [...] "I-28" [...] clearly discernible on its conning tower. Just as I-28 fired at <b>Tautog,</b> the American boat launched two torpedoes, then went to 150 ft to avoid. One torpedo missed, the second sent the Japanese boat to the bottom, making her the third sunk by Pacific Fleet submarines.|$|E
5000|$|Back in Pearl Harbor in November 1990, <b>Tautog</b> {{enjoyed the}} {{holidays}} and began preparing for her third arctic deployment. In April 1991 <b>Tautog</b> once again joined her sister ship, the USS Asprofor {{three weeks of}} Arctic under-ice operations, ending in a liberty port in San Francisco. After the exercise, <b>Tautog</b> performed an emergency main ballast tank blow from her test depth.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tautogs</b> {{assignment}} for her tenth war patrol {{took her to}} the cold waters of the northern Pacific near the Kuril Islands, from Paramushiro south to the main islands of Japan and the northeast coast of Hokkaidō. The submarine topped off with fuel at Midway and entered her patrol area on 5 March 1944. Her only casualty of the war occurred that day. While several members of her crew were doing emergency work on deck, a giant wave knocked them all off their feet and swept one man, newly assigned Motor Machinists Mate R. A. Laramee, overboard; a search for him proved fruitless.|$|R
5000|$|Often, bergall {{is mixed}} in with {{blackfish}} (<b>tautog),</b> living {{on or near the}} same structures. Much of the food eaten by those bergall living among blackfish are the leftovers from the blackfishes prey. They can be distinguished from the <b>tautog</b> by their pointed snouts. Bergall are generally smaller, so are usually thrown back by anglers who think they caught a [...] "short" [...] <b>tautog.</b> In past years, they have been important commercial fish, but now are considered pests. They can be confused with black sea bass and other grouper, as well as <b>tautog,</b> for their ability to change color.|$|E
50|$|In October 1986, <b>Tautog</b> began a non-refueling {{overhaul}} at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Bremerton, Washington. After extensive modifications and testing, <b>Tautog</b> {{returned to}} her homeport of Pearl Harbor, Hawaii on 30 May 1989.|$|E
50|$|On 21 March 1972, <b>Tautog</b> put to sea for {{a special}} operation. During that mission, she called briefly at Guam and at Subic Bay.

She conducted operations in the Hawaiian Islands for the remainder of 1972.|$|E
50|$|On 9 April 1942, <b>Tautog</b> headed westward toward Hawaii {{and started}} her next war patrol upon leaving Pearl Harbor 15 days later.

Around 10:00 on 26 April near Johnston Island, while en route to her station, <b>Tautog</b> sighted the periscope of an enemy submarine, apparently maneuvering to reach a favorable firing position. <b>Tautog</b> made a sharp turn and fired one stern torpedo, evidently exploding above the target, which sank Ro-30 (1,000 tons).|$|E
50|$|In October 1985, <b>Tautog</b> left Pearl Harbor for a Western Pacific and Indian Ocean deployment, visiting Guam; Singapore (for Christmas); Diego Garcia twice; Perth, Australia; the Philippines; and Chinhae, South Korea.

50|$|Assigned to {{training}} duty in February 1945, <b>Tautog</b> {{spent the rest}} of World War II in that role and supporting developmental work off Hawaii and the West Coast. She transferred to the Atlantic in November 1945, a few months after Japans surrender, and was decommissioned in December. In 1947 <b>Tautog</b> went to the Great Lakes, where she was employed as a stationary Naval Reserve training submarine at Milwaukee, Wisconsin, for nearly twelve years. USS <b>Tautog</b> was removed from service in September 1959. Sold some months later, she was scrapped at Manistee, Michigan, during the early 1960s.|$|E
5000|$|Following {{an intense}} period of {{training}} and operational exercises, <b>Tautog</b> again deployed on WESTPAC in March 1980. <b>Tautog</b> met every commitment placed on her {{during this period of}} international tension, and was awarded the Navy Expeditionary Medal for her performance. In September 1980, the ship was awarded the Battle Efficiency [...] "E", Anti Submarine Warfare [...] "A" [...] and Engineering [...] "E" [...] for excellence displayed during the previous year. Port visits to Diego Garcia; the Philippines; Perth, Australia; and Guam were enjoyed by all hands. <b>Tautog</b> also received a Meritorious Unit Commendation for service on or around 1 June 1980.|$|E
50|$|That night, <b>Tautog</b> {{was headed}} for Alors Strait when she sighted a ship (thought to be a freighter) coming west, {{accompanied}} by an escort. The targets suddenly turned toward <b>Tautog</b> and were recognized as an antisubmarine warfare team. The submarine went deep but still received a severe pounding. On 5 January 1943, <b>Tautog</b> sighted a sail off her port bow and promptly closed the ship. It {{turned out to be}} a native craft with a dozen Muslim sailors, four women, several babies, some chickens, and a goat on board. After he had examined the ships papers, Tautogs commanding officer allowed the vessel to resume its voyage. On 9 January at 08:38, <b>Tautog</b> (relying on ULTRA) sighted a Natori-class cruiser off Ambon Island, at a range of about 3000 yd. Three minutes later, the submarine fired her first torpedo. At 09:43, her crew heard a loud explosion, and sonar reported the cruisers screws had stopped. In the next few minutes, as the cruiser got underway at reduced speed, <b>Tautog</b> scored two more hits, while the cruiser opened fire on her periscope with 5 in guns, preventing her from tracking the target for another attack; the cruiser limped into Ambon.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Tautog</b> {{departed}} Mombasa on 24 February 1977 {{and started}} east toward Pearl Harbor. On the way, however, President of Uganda Idi Amin had precipitated a crisis by rounding up all Americans resident in Uganda {{in response to}} President of the United States Jimmy Carters condemnation of the murders of two of Amins Ugandan political opponents, and <b>Tautog</b> received orders to join a hastily organized task force built around the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier [...] {{and return to the}} East African coast. While the United States waited for Amin to make his mind up about whether or not to release the American hostages, <b>Tautog</b> cruised the coast of Kenya, which stands between landlocked Uganda and the Indian Ocean, with the Enterprise task force both as a show of American resolve to protect U.S. citizens in Uganda and as a scratch force to try for a hostage rescue if one became necessary. <b>Tautog</b> received a Meritorious Unit Commendation for service 1 November 1976 to 5 July 1977.|$|E
5000|$|On 30 August 1968, <b>Tautog</b> {{departed}} Pascagoula {{on her way}} to {{join the}} United States Pacific Fleet. She transited the Panama Canal on 8 September 1968 and arrived at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on 23 September 1968. There, she joined Submarine Squadron 12, serving as its flagship. Throughout 1969, <b>Tautog</b> completed her post-commissioning tests and sea trials, followed by her shakedown training cruise. She conducted the majority of these operations {{in the vicinity of the}} Hawaiian Islands, although in January and February 1969 she berthed in Puget Sound Naval Shipyard at Bremerton, Washington, for trials and repairs. She completed her shakedown training in September 1969 and, on 15 September 1969, began post-shakedown repairs and alterations which were protracted by the necessity of replacing her entire diesel generator. Tautogs repairs finally were completed on 19 February 1970, and she began normal operations out of Pearl Harbor, involving torpedo and sonar tracking exercises, culminating in <b>Tautog</b> earning the Battle Efficiency [...] "E" [...] in 1970 for outstanding performance. <b>Tautog</b> received a Navy Unit Commendation for service on or about 1 June 1969. According to Drew, 2008, <b>Tautog</b> monitored a test of new cruise missiles launched from an Echo II class Soviet submarine in the summer of 1969.|$|E
5000|$|On 20 June 1970, <b>Tautog</b> was {{patrolling the}} North Pacific Ocean {{near the city}} of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, on the Soviet Unions Kamchatka Peninsula, which was a major base for missile-armed {{submarines}} of the Soviet Navy. <b>Tautog</b> was attempting to trail the K-108, a Soviet Navy Echo II-class guided missile submarine nicknamed [...] "Black Lila". The Soviet submarine was [...] "close aboard" [...] with <b>Tautog,</b> unaware that <b>Tautog</b> was in the vicinity, and the two submarines were within feet of one another for a lengthy period. Unable to determine the depth of the K-108, as new depth-finding hydrophones had not yet been installed, the American submarine was at a disadvantage in such close quarters. At some points the hydrographic equipment aboard <b>Tautog</b> registered zero distance between the submarines. At another point [...] "Tautog's" [...] hydrophone operators assumed the K-108 had risen to near the surface, placing the Soviet submarine directly above <b>Tautog.</b> Then the operators determined the Soviet vessel was descending. The trace on the oscilloscope, that gave the American submariners at visual reference as to the distance of the K-108, disappeared. Just as the captain began to say the Soviet sub was coming close aboard again, K-108 slammed belly first into the top of the Tautog's sail, proof the Soviet vessel had been descending from directly above. The K-108's massive screws came into contact with the steel of the Tautog's sail and lost one screw. This was confirmed by hydrographic sound of a turbine running away aboard the Soviet sub, being no longer coupled to a propeller.Tautog suffered damage to her sail. As <b>Tautog</b> proceeded away from the site of the accident, her crew heard what they believed was K-108 breaking up and sinking. When <b>Tautog</b> arrived in Pearl Harbor, a large portion of one of K-108s screws was found embedded in her sail. Over thirty years later, {{after the collapse of the}} Soviet Union, it was revealed that K-108 had actually been able to return to Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky. The former captain of the K-108, Boris Bogdasaryan, was able to provide a concise narrative of the collision. The collision resulted in no casualties aboard either submarine.|$|E

Upon return to Pearl Harbor, {{preparations}} {{were made for}} the transit to Vallejo, California, where <b>Tautog</b> would undergo its second major overhaul and receive a new reactor core. In December 1977 <b>Tautog</b> entered Mare Island Naval Shipyard and the overhaul commenced.|$|E
50|$|In February 1995, <b>Tautog</b> {{departed}} Pearl Harbor for her eleventh WESTPAC deployment conducting {{joint operations}} with Japanese, Korean and British naval forces.
