5|$|A 1977 {{inventory}} revealed only 44 Poitou donkeys worldwide, {{and there}} were still fewer than 80 animals as of 1980. Conservation efforts were led by several public and private groups in France. In 1979, the Haras Nationaux, (the French national stud) and the Parc Naturel Regional du Marais Poitevin, working with private breeders, launched an effort to improve the genetics of the Poitou, develop new breeding techniques and collect <b>traditional</b> <b>knowledge</b> on the breed. In 1981, 18 large donkeys from Portugal were acquired for use in breeding Poitou donkeys. This preceded {{the creation of the}} Asinerie Nationale Experimentale, which opened in Charente-Maritime in Dampierre-sur-Boutonne in 1982, as an experimental breeding farm for Poitous. The Parc also works to preserve the Poitevin horse breed. In 1988, the Association pour la Sauvegarde du Baudet du Poitou (SABAUD) was formed as a breeder network that focuses on marketing and fundraising for the breed, and in 1989 became the financial support arm of the Asinerie Nationale Experimentale. The Association des Éleveurs des Races Équine, Mulassière et Asine, Baudet du Poitou is the registering body for the Poitou donkey. The early conservation efforts were sometimes sidetracked as some breeders sold crossbred Poitous as purebreds, which are worth up to ten times as much. Forged pedigrees and registration papers were sometimes used to legitimize these sales. However, by the 1990s, DNA testing and microchip technology began to be used to identify and track purebred animals.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background New {{quantitative}} methods {{to collect and}} analyze data have produced novel findings in ethnobiology. A common application of {{quantitative methods}} in ethnobiology is to assess the <b>traditional</b> ecological <b>knowledge</b> of individuals. Few studies have addressed reliability of indices of <b>traditional</b> ecological <b>knowledge</b> constructed with different quantitative methods. Methods We assessed the associations among eight indices of <b>traditional</b> ecological <b>knowledge</b> from data collected from 650 native Amazonians. We computed Spearman correlations, Chronbach's alpha, and principal components factor analysis for the eight indices. Results We found that indices derived from different raw data were weakly correlated (rho 0. 5; p Conclusion A {{possible explanation for the}} relatively low correlation between indices derived from different raw data, but relatively high internal consistency of the eight indices is that the methods capture different aspects of an individual's <b>traditional</b> ecological <b>knowledge.</b> To develop a reliable measure of <b>traditional</b> ecological <b>knowledge,</b> researchers should collect raw data using a variety of methods and then generate an aggregated measure that contains data from the various components of <b>traditional</b> ecological <b>knowledge.</b> Failure to do this will hinder cross-cultural comparisons. </p...|$|R

40|$|<b>Traditional</b> food <b>knowledge</b> (TFK) {{refers to}} a {{cultural}} tradition of sharing food, recipes and cooking skills and techniques and passing down that collective wisdom through generations. The value of this knowledge is hidden in a global food system offering an abundance of commercial convenience foods. This study defines TFK and explores its value to assert space for its recovery and renewal. Using Trevor Hancock’s research on healthy communities and models, such as the Mandala of Health (1985), <b>traditional</b> food <b>knowledge</b> will be analyzed for its potential to contribute to individual and community ecosystem health. The role of <b>traditional</b> food <b>knowledge</b> is examined with respect to promoting biocultural diversity and improving the capacity for food production among citizens. Food diversity {{is an important component}} of human nutrition and can be an indicator for a bioculturally diverse region. Studies on biocultural diversity recognize the close connection between cultural and biological diversity. Only recently have the losses in cultural heritage, such as <b>traditional</b> food <b>knowledge</b> garnered academic and policy attention. <b>Traditional</b> food <b>knowledge</b> can be one means of asserting cultural identity and can be a way to connect people to the natural world. Transmitting this knowledge is one important means of fostering sustainable livelihoods, ecosystem health and enhanced individual and community capacity. <b>Traditional</b> food <b>knowledge</b> can provide an individual with the capacity to prepare meals that are nutritious, safe and culturally relevant. This skill can support adaptation to altered food environments, such as is the case for immigrants and indigenous populations. The food system itself has rapidly changed with global industrialization, urbanization and cultural homogenization; and <b>traditional</b> food <b>knowledge</b> is no exception. The distinct expressions of taste and place are facing a continuity gap when <b>traditional</b> food <b>knowledge</b> is not passed forward, but rather sidelined as an abstract, historical concept. This study takes a qualitative case study approach exploring the concept of <b>traditional</b> food <b>knowledge.</b> The existing literature is compared to the lived experience of immigrants and their families in the Canadian suburban context, specifically in Mississauga, Ontario. This study explores the relevance and value of <b>traditional</b> food <b>knowledge</b> to Indonesian-Chinese New Canadians, their families and the wider community. 	Despite the colossal challenges posed by a global food industry, there are personal and community benefits to gaining or relearning <b>traditional</b> food <b>knowledge.</b> The community capacity increases with a greater number of skilled practitioners and educated consumers. Informal sharing of the cultural life skills engages people from various walks of life as they learn about, and from, each other. Governance that enables and sustains this type of community exchange will require changes to ensure equitable support for the opportunity for such informal learning and capacity building to occur among all citizens...|$|R
40|$|A chasm {{exists between}} science {{curriculum}} offered within K- 12 and post-secondary education systems, {{and the needs}} of national and international decision-makers with respect to the inclusion of Indigenous knowledges within processes aimed at protecting global biological diversity.

Yet, sustaining Indigenous knowledges as global wisdom will not be possible if young people lack opportunities to learn Indigenous <b>traditional</b> environmental <b>knowledge</b> {{as an integral part of}} their education experience. Métis <b>traditional</b> environmental <b>knowledge</b> can be a modality of science education that will engage learners in understanding relationships with the natural world and the importance of developing sustainable lifestyles within holistic lifelong learning. In advancing this contention, a series of interviews were conducted with Métis traditional land users from North West Saskatchewan. The interviews provided data in 17 thematic areas including: balance, economic, environment, harmony, health, Indigenous knowledge, political, social, spirituality, values, land, language, people, self, imagination, tradition, and learning. Results were used to respond to the four primary research questions: According to traditional land users in North West Saskatchewan, what is Métis <b>traditional</b> environmental <b>knowledge?</b> How does Métis <b>traditional</b> environmental <b>knowledge</b> in North West Saskatchewan align with established theories of Aboriginal epistemology and supporting principles? What evidence and arguments exist that support the development of Métis <b>traditional</b> environmental <b>knowledge</b> as a modality of science education? How can Métis <b>traditional</b> environmental <b>knowledge</b> be developed as a modality of science education? Findings support development of holistic education processes that comprise a broad scope of knowledge integral to understanding our environment. Métis <b>traditional</b> environmental <b>knowledge</b> requires learners engage in activities outside the classroom, participating in experiences that facilitate an understanding of holistic thinking in intellectual, physical, affective and spiritual domains. <b>Traditional</b> environmental <b>knowledge</b> and practices of Métis People can inspire learners in science education, improving their engagement, understanding and decision-making abilities concerning the natural environment...|$|R

Unlike the spread of Christianity within Indian country, in the United States, the Bahá‘í Faith has never been associated with a fortification of colonial occupation, Euro-American assimilation, or forced conversions of Native Americans. Indeed, in 1960 Hand of the Cause Rúhíyyih Khánum asked for forgiveness for the injustices her race had done and praised the great past of the native peoples. And in 1963 anthropologist Alice Beck Kehoe, a well known researcher of Native Americans, observed that the Bahá‘í Faith is considered by its members to be a universal faith, not tied to any one particular culture, religious background, language, or even country of origin.

25|$|From the {{earliest}} records {{regarding the use}} of medicinals to today, the toxicity of certain substances has been described in all Chinese materiae medicae. Since TCM has become more popular in the Western world, there are increasing concerns about the potential toxicity of many traditional Chinese medicinals including plants, animal parts and minerals. Traditional Chinese herbal remedies are conveniently available from grocery stores in most Chinese neighborhoods; some of these items may contain toxic ingredients, are imported into the U.S. illegally, and are associated with claims of therapeutic benefit without evidence. For most medicinals, efficacy and toxicity testing are based on <b>traditional</b> <b>knowledge</b> rather than laboratory analysis. The toxicity in some cases could be confirmed by modern research (i.e., in scorpion); in some cases it couldn't (i.e., in Curculigo). Traditional herbal medicines can contain extremely toxic chemicals and heavy metals, and naturally occurring toxins, which can cause illness, exacerbate pre-existing poor health or result in death. Botanical misidentification of plants can cause toxic reactions in humans. The description on some plants used in traditional Chinese medicine have changed, leading to unintended intoxication of the wrong plants. A concern is also contaminated herbal medicines with microorganisms and fungal toxins, including aflatoxin. Traditional herbal medicines are sometimes contaminated with toxic heavy metals, including lead, arsenic, mercury and cadmium, which inflict serious health risks to consumers. Also, adulteration of some herbal medicine preparations with conventional drugs which may cause serious adverse effects, such as corticosteroids, phenylbutazone, phenytoin, and glibenclamide, has been reported.|$|E
