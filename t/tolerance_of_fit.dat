40|$|Ecological {{psychology}} views goal-directed {{behavior as}} a process by which a cognitive operation, an intention, selects an affordance property of the environment to be a goal, and then assembles and sustains an effectivity, the means for attaining that goal. Under this formulation, goal-directed behaviors require the perceptual scaling of affordances to effectivities under intentions. In support of this theory, five experiments were conducted to study {{the perception of the}} affordance of passability for walkers and wheelchair-users through doorways. ^ First it is demonstrated that for perception of passability, geometrical scalars are not simply in reference to body size, rather they are functional in nature. Body dimensions which generally do not determine <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> <b>fit</b> are less tuned for. Tool-use is discussed to suggest that geometrical scaling can be by a non-body scalar. Second tuning is examined directly. Learning to use a tool (wheelchair), as the change of effectivities, allowed us to observe that tuning requires a complete perception-action cycle in the relevant environment. Third, a study of perceptual scaling for passability of doorways made of different material reveal that meaning is a scalar that can be mapped geometrically in concert with kinematic, and kinetic parameters. Finally, visual judgment and performance are compared directly. It is shown that participants 2 ̆ 7 judgments of what they can do (perceptual scaling) is mapped 1 : 1 with what they can actually do. That mapping of affordances to effectivities is extraordinarily constrained by the manner selected to attain that goal, that is, by an intention. In this process I examine kinematic parameters, which are manner parameters, as scalars. Conclusions are drawn from the above for psychology and for engineering. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{computational}} Grid, {{fault tolerance}} is an imperative {{issue to be}} considered during job scheduling. Due to {{the widespread use of}} resources, systems are highly prone to errors and failures. Hence fault tolerance {{plays a key role in}} grid to avoid the problem of unreliability. The two main techniques for implementing fault tolerance in grid environment are check pointing and replication. This paper proposes a real time approach to a replication technique named as FMFRS (Fault Tolerant most fitting resource scheduling algorithm) to improve the fault <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fittest</b> resource scheduling algorithm. The proposed method is to improve the fault tolerance by using fittest resource scheduling algorithm, by scheduling the job in coordination with job replication when the resource has low reliability and checking the parameters like Fault Tolerance capacity and Node’s Reliability. Based on the reliability index of the resource, the resource is identified as critical...|$|R
40|$|Copyright © 2006 IOP Publishing LimitedThis paper {{presents}} in {{a general}} form the most popular local minimization search solutions for geophysical inverse problems—the Tikhonov regularization solutions, the smoothest model solutions and the subspace solutions, from which the inter-relationships between these solutions are revealed. For the Tikhonov regularization solution, {{a variety of forms}} exist—the general iterative formula, the iterative linearized scheme, the Levenberg–Marquardt version, the conjugate gradient solver (CGS) and local-search quadratic approximation CGS. It is shown here that the first three solutions are equivalent and are just a specified form of the gradient solution. The local-search quadratic approximation CGS is shown to be a more general form from which these three solutions emerge. The smoothest model solution (Occam's inversion) is a subset of the Tikhonov regularization solutions, for which a practical algorithm generally comprises two parts: (1) determine the subset of the Tikhonov regularization solutions which satisfy the desired <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> data <b>fit,</b> (2) choose the solution which best fits the data in the subset. The solution procedure is actually an adaptive Tikhonov regularization solution. The subspace solution is mathematically no more than a dimension-decreased transform of model parameterization in the Tikhonov regularization solution or the smoothest model solution. The crucial step is to choose the basis vectors which span the whole model space in the parameterization transform. A simple form of the transform is developed which yields greater flexibility for geophysical inverse applications. Stewart A Greenhalgh, Zhou Bing and Alan Gree...|$|R
40|$|Product Sound Design is an {{elective}} {{course of the}} Master of Industrial Design Engineering at the Delft University of Technology. The educational goal of the course is to make students consciously aware of constructive parts {{in the design of}} appliances. The paper details the experience and the design of product sounds. The course runs during the second half year and the students are involved through project teams. Products have mostly moving parts with a certain mass that generate sounds. Clearance is the result <b>of</b> <b>tolerances</b> <b>of</b> two <b>fitted</b> parts and the quality of manufacturing these parts. Two types of sounds can be distinguished: intentional sounds and consequential sounds. In product sound design an integrative vision of perception and engineering is needed to be a successful designer/engineer of products. The content of the product sound design course has three main subjects to explain: product, product sound and product sound design. The first quarter consists of an intentional sound project and the consequential sound project takes place in the second quarter. The education format is two projects, one in each quarter, and supported by lectures. The project is finished with a presentation and report. Results for projects in the academic year 2010 - 2011 will be presented. Findings of these projects will be adapted in the next course. The experiences of course leaders and students are good, which is translated in relatively good marks. The product sound design course fills the gap that exists between sound experts and product designers. Industrial DesignIndustrial Design Engineerin...|$|R

Previous {{studies have shown}} that GMPase {{plays an important role in}} <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> plants to salt stress at vegetative stage. However, the function of GMPase in plant responses to salt stress at reproductive stage remains unclear. Studies have shown that heterologous expression of rice GMPase OsVTC 1 - 1 enhanced salt <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> tobacco seedlings, but the native role of OsVTC 1 - 1 in salt stress <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> rice is unknown. To illustrate the native function of GMPase in response of rice to salt stress, OsVTC 1 - 1 expression was suppressed using RNAi-mediated gene silencing. Suppressing OsVTC 1 - 1 expression obviously decreased salt <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> rice varieties at vegetative stage. Intriguingly, grain yield of OsVTC 1 - 1 RNAi rice was also significantly reduced under salt stress, indicating that OsVTC 1 - 1 plays an important role in salt <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> rice at both seedling and reproductive stages. OsVTC 1 - 1 RNAi rice accumulated more ROS under salt stress, and supplying exogenous ascorbic acid restored salt <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> OsVTC 1 - 1 RNAi lines, suggesting that OsVTC 1 - 1 is involved in salt <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> rice through the biosynthesis regulation of ascorbic acid. Altogether, results of present study showed that rice GMPase gene OsVTC 1 - 1 plays a critical role in salt <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> rice at both vegetative and reproductive stages through AsA scavenging of excess ROS...|$|R
40|$|Background: Physicians’ <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> {{uncertainty}} (TU) is a trait potentially {{associated with}} desirable outcomes, and emerging evidence suggests it may change over time. Past studies of TU, however, have been cross-sectional {{and have not}} measured <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> the different, specific types of uncertainty that physicians confront. We addressed these limitations in a longitudinal exploratory study of medical students. Methods: At the end of medical school (Doctor of Medicine degree) Years 1 and 4, a cohort of 26 students at a US medical school completed measures assessing <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> different types of uncertainty: 1) complexity (uncertainty arising from features of information that {{make it difficult to}} comprehend); 2) risk (uncertainty arising from the indeterminacy of future outcomes); and 3) ambiguity (uncertainty arising from limitations in the reliability, credibility, or adequacy of information). Change in uncertainty-specific TU was assessed using paired t-tests. Results: Between Years 1 and 4, there was a significant decrease in <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> ambiguity (t= 3. 22, p= 0. 004), but no change in students’ <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> complexity or risk. Conclusions: <b>Tolerance</b> <b>of</b> ambiguity – but not other types of uncertainty – decreases during medical school, suggesting that TU is a multidimensional, partially mutable state. Future studies should measure <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> different uncertainties and examine how TU might be improved...|$|R
40|$|This study explores {{patterns}} of language learning strategies {{and the degree}} <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> ambiguity of Korean Naval Academy midshipmen. The subjects, 377 midshipmen, were divided into three groups according to class, major, and proficiency, {{and the results were}} analyzed by group. The study also sought to find out relationships between motivation, attitude, language learning strategies, and <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> ambiguity. For the study, the Strategy Inventory Language Learning (SILL for ESL/EFL) developed by Oxford (1990 a) and the Second Language <b>Tolerance</b> <b>of</b> Ambiguity Scale by Ely (1995) were used, along with items about motivation and attitude toward language learning. It was found that the language learning strategy mean and <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> ambiguity mean were not high overall. The proficiency levels showed significant mean differences: the high proficiency level students showed a significantly higher mean use of language learning strategies and <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> ambiguity than did the low and mid proficiency level students. With respect to class levels, there were no significant mean differences relating to language learning strategies. The seniors' mean <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> ambiguity, however, was significantly higher than that of the other class levels. For major, {{there were no significant differences}} in the use of language learning strategies and <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> ambiguity. Correlations between <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> ambiguity and language learning strategies were significant and positive, although modest. The midshipmen's means of motivation and attitude were comparatively high. It was also found that while motivation showed a strong correlation with language learning strategies, attitude showed a strong correlation with <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> ambiguity. Through the analysis of six open questions, in addition, it confirmed that the Korean midshipmen generally did not use active strategies in learning English, although high proficiency level students used more than the mid or low proficiency ones.

40|$|Salt <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> higher {{plants is}} {{determined}} by {{a complex set of}} traits, the timing and rate of evolution of which are largely unknown. We compared the salt <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> cultivars of sugar beet and their ancestor, sea beet, in hydroponic studies and evaluated whether traditional domestication and more recent breeding have changed salt <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> the cultivars relative to their ancestor. Our comparison <b>of</b> salt <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> crop cultivars is based on values of the relative growth rate (RGR) of the entire plant at various salinity levels. We found considerable salt <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> the sea beet and slightly, but significantly, reduced salt <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> the sugar beet cultivars. This indicates that traditional domestication by selection for morphological traits such as leaf size, beet shape and size, enhanced productivity, sugar content and palatability slightly affected salt <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> sugar beet cultivars. Salt tolerance among four sugar beet cultivars, three of which have been claimed to be salt tolerant, did not differ. We analysed the components of RGR to understand the mechanism <b>of</b> salt <b>tolerance</b> at the whole-plant level. The growth rate reduction at higher salinity was linked with reduced leaf area at the whole-plant level (leaf area ratio) and at the individual leaf level (specific leaf area). The leaf weight fraction was not affected by increased salinity. On the other hand, succulence and leaf thickness and the net assimilation per unit of leaf area (unit leaf rate) increased in response to salt treatment, thus partially counteracting reduced capture of light by lower leaf area. This compensatory mechanism may form part <b>of</b> the salt <b>tolerance</b> mechanism <b>of</b> sea beet and the four studied sugar beet cultivars. Together, our results indicate that domestication of the halophytic ancestor sea beet slightly reduced salt tolerance and that breeding for improved salt <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> sugar beet cultivars has not been effective. ...|$|R
