50|$|Slab {{failure is}} the sliding and forward {{toppling}} of deep seated mass {{into the river}} channel. Failures are associated with steep, low height, fine grained cohesive banks and occur during low flow conditions.

50|$|A {{pressure}} ridge {{sometimes referred to}} as a tumulus (or tumuli in plural form) is created in an active lava flow. Formation occurs when the outer edges and surfaces of the lava flow begin to harden. If the advancing lava underneath becomes restricted it may push up on the hardened crust, tilting it outward. Inflation also takes place and is a process where the plastic layer of lava underneath expands as it cools and small crystals form. The end result is a raised mound of hardened lava rock, usually a relatively narrow but long ridge. Tension cracks form on the surface of {{pressure ridge}}s and run along the axis of elongated ridges, and at both edges of broader ridges, {{sometimes referred to as}} pressure plateaus. Sometimes, along the edges of a pressure ridge, the <b>tension</b> <b>crack</b> can be large enough to create a liftup cave. Other caves can form inside pressure ridges when the lava vacates leaving an inflationary cave.|$|E
40|$|Of {{the many}} {{different}} types of riverbank failure, the planar failure mechanism is perhaps the most common, being associated with steep, relatively low banks composed of cohesive sediments. To reliably analyze the stability of riverbanks against planar failures many parameters (including the failure plane angle and the depth of the <b>tension</b> <b>crack)</b> have to be determined. In this paper we introduce a new analytical method to estimate the failure plane angle. This is achieved by employing a combination of field and laboratory data to first derive a set of empirical curves to estimate the <b>tension</b> <b>crack</b> depth. The estimated <b>tension</b> <b>crack</b> depth is then used in a bank stability analysis, from which the failure plane angle can be evaluated. Based on observations from field and laboratory tests, we found that the new model provides a mean relative error (MRE) of 4 %, 23 %, and 27 % between calculated and observed values of failure plane angle, <b>tension</b> <b>crack</b> depth, and bank-top retreat, respectively. Based on a comparison of these errors with those derived from a range of existing equations, we show that this represents a considerable improvement relative to prior studies. The new model can therefore be used to determine the geometrical parameters of the failed blocks of riverbanks subject to planar failure. <br/...|$|E

In spite of efforts to reduce the slope gradient to 1 : 1.3 including removal of the observed <b>tension</b> <b>cracks</b> (Length: 40  m, Depth: 3  –  4  m) for stabilization of the slope, a large-scale <b>tension</b> <b>cracks</b> (Length: 90  m, Depth: above 7  m) reoccurred during the excavation. And additional <b>tension</b> <b>cracks</b> occurred in the slope by relaxation of rock masses.

Earthquake shaking can increase shear stresses in soils and thereby reduce the factor of safety. In addition, earthquake loading can influence the shape of failure surface, particularly when tension cracks are present. In cohesive materials, a <b>tension</b> <b>crack</b> often occurs at the crest of slopes {{and the depth of}} this crack can be influenced by earthquake loading as depth of <b>tension</b> <b>crack</b> can be related to the factor of safety. In this study, the effect was studied for non-circular failure surfaces using a simple genetic algorithm and the Morgenstern-Price method.

40|$|Rock slope {{stability}} analysis {{has been a}} challenging problem for civil and mining engineers. There are several modes of failure in which a rock slope can fail; a plane failure is one of them. In recent past, a generalised expression has been presented for the factor of safety of the rock slope against plane failure. The expression considers several parameters that govern {{the stability of the}} slope. These parameters are: inclination of the slope face, inclination of the joint or discontinuity plane, unit weight of the sliding rock mass, shear strength parameters of joint materials, depth of <b>tension</b> <b>crack,</b> depth of water in <b>tension</b> <b>crack,</b> surcharge and seismic loadings, and the stabilizing force and its inclination. Though the analytical expression can be used to calculate the factor of safety, practising engineers generally prefer the use of design charts.

A numerical example is illustrated to explain the calculation steps so that the developed design charts can be used conveniently...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{analysis}} of slope stability in unsaturated soils. The failure criterion (Mohr-Coulomb) is extended {{to take into account}} the effect of a second stress variable (i. e., matrix suction). Test results from the literature for unsaturated materials are used to illustrate and check the proposed concept. Bishop's Simplified Method of slope stability analysis is modified to include the new failure criterion for unsaturated materials. The new slope stability equations are incorporated into a slope stability program which had been previously developed at the University of Saskatchewan. A case history of a landslide that occurred in a compacted embankment of highly plastic clay is presented. Undisturbed block and tube samples from near the failure planes are used in a comprehensive testing program to determine the material properties. The testing program includes saturated triaxial tests, direct shear tests, consolidation tests, and suction tests. Hilf's Analysis is expanded and used to predict negative pore pressures. The stability of the embankment slope is checked under conditions of soil suction (as constructed) and hydrostatic water pressure (saturation). The stability is also checked for the case of a <b>tension</b> <b>crack</b> forming and the <b>tension</b> <b>crack</b> filling with water. The effect of a frost line below the surface is also checked. Finally the failed conditions are analysed. Conclusions reached concerning unsaturated materials and slope stability are presented...|$|E
40|$|Spall {{may be a}} {{significant}} secondary source of seismic waves from underground explosions. The proper representation of spall as a seismic source is important for forward and inverse modeling of explosions for yield estimation and discrimination studies. We present a new derivation of a widely used point force representation for spall, {{which is based on}} a horizontal <b>tension</b> <b>crack</b> model. The derivation clarifies the relationship between point force and moment tensor representations of the <b>tension</b> <b>crack.</b> For wavelengths long compared with spall depth, the two repre-sentations are equivalent, and the moment tensor time history is propor-tional to the doubly integrated time history of the point force. Numerical experiments verify that, for regional seismic phases, this equivalence is valid for all frequencies for which the point-source (long wavelength) approximation is valid. Further analysis shows that the moment tensor and point force representations retain their validity for nonplanar spall surfaces, provided that the average dip of the surface is small. The equivalency of the two representations implies that a singular inverse problem will result from attempts to infer simultaneously the spectra of both of these source terms from seismic waveforms. If the spall moment tensor alone is estimated by inversion of waveform data, the inferred numerical values of its components will depend inversely upon the source depth that is assumed in the inversion formalism...|$|E

The parameters which affect diagonal tension cracking have been defined by previous studies; however, much work needs be done in order to predict accurately the magnitude and influence on behavior of these parameters. The {{study was conducted in}} two phases; an analytical investigation of the amount of shear transferred across the face of a diagonal <b>tension</b> <b>crack</b> by the longitudinal steel and of the influence which the crack starting point has on tensile cracking, and an experimental investigation of the ratio of shearing stress to flexural stress at the root of a diagonal <b>tension</b> <b>crack.</b> The results of the analytical investigation confirm the importance of including the "dowel force" in any analysis of the behavior of reinforced concrete beams without web reinforcement when subjected to combined shear and bending moment.

This study included both beams of normal weight and lightweight structural concrete, and the results of the computations made in this study show about the same amount of accuracy for beams of both types of concrete.

40|$|A {{constitutive}} model applicable to brittle {{materials such as}} ceramics subjected to biaxial compressive loading is developed. The model is based on non-interacting sliding microcracks that are uniformly distributed in the material. <b>Tension</b> <b>cracks</b> nucleate and propagate {{from the tip of}} the sliding cracks in the direction of maximum applied compression when the stress-intensity factor reaches its critical value. For high strain rate deformation, the rate of crack growth is governed by a universal relation in dynamic fracture. The {{constitutive model}} provides strain components for plane deformation which consists of an elastic part and a part due to sliding and growth of the <b>tension</b> <b>cracks.</b> The failure of the material is linked to a critical density of damage and hence a critical length for the <b>tension</b> <b>cracks.</b> The constitutive model is used to study material behavior under uniaxial compressive constant strain rate loading. A critical strain rate beyond which the material would exhibit rate sensitivity is proposed. The model predicts the failure or peak strength to increase with increasing strain rate. For engineering ceramics, the rate sensitivity exponent is found to be a function of the relation between the rate of crack growth and the toughness of the material.

40|$|In this paper, an {{analytical}} expression is derived for the {{factor of safety}} of the rock slope incorporating most of the practically occurring destabilizing forces {{as well as the}} external stabilizing force through an anchoring system. The slope stability is analyzed as a two-dimensional problem, considering a slice of unit thickness through the slope and assuming negligible resistance to sliding at the lateral boundaries of the sliding block. A detailed parametric study is presented to investigate the effect of surcharge on the stability of the rock slope for practical ranges of governing parameters such as inclination of the slope face, inclination of the failure plane, depth of <b>tension</b> <b>crack,</b> depth of water in <b>tension</b> <b>crack,</b> shear strength parameters of the material at the failure plane, unit weight of rock, stabilizing force and its inclination, and seismic load. For the range of parameters considered in the present study, it is found that the factor of safety of the rock slope decreases with increase in surcharge; the rate of decrease being relatively higher for lower values of surcharge. It is also observed that for a specific surcharge, the factor of safety depends significantly on all other parameters, except for unit weight of rock and higher values of inclination of stabilizing force to the normal at the failure plane. For any combination of these variables, the surcharge plays a vital role in the stability. A perfectly stable slope at relatively low surcharge can become unsafe with the increase in surcharge. The deterioration in the stability can be quite rapid, depending on the combination of the factors under consideration.
