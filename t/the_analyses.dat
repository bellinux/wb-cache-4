5|$|Liu {{and colleagues}} {{conducted}} a separate phylogenetic analysis in 2017. They criticized {{the analysis of}} Rieppel and colleagues as having unnecessarily repeated several characters in their data, thus imbuing the repeated characters with undue weight in the analysis. In their own analysis, Liu and colleagues used the same source datasets, but deleted repeated characters, added two new characters from an analysis by Sean Modesto and Hans-Dieter Sues (2004), and removed poorly preserved or potentially chimeric taxa such as Cosesaurus, Kadimakara, Trachelosaurus, and Malerisaurus. Analyses based on parsimony-based and Bayesian methods found that Dinocephalosaurus {{was a member of}} the Tanystropheidae, being the sister group to a clade containing Tanystropheus, Macrocnemus, Langobardisaurus, and Tanytrachelos. <b>The</b> <b>analyses</b> also recovered a monophyletic Protorosauria, albeit to the exclusion of Prolacerta. The tree from the parsimony-based analysis is reproduced above, at right.|$|E
5|$|On {{the issue}} of {{geographic}} origin, linguists during the 20th century agreed that the Uto-Aztecan language family originated in the southwestern United States. Evidence from archaeology and ethnohistory supports a southward diffusion across the American continent thesis, specifically that speakers of early Nahuan languages migrated from Aridoamerica into central Mexico in several waves. But recently, the traditional assessment has been challenged by Jane H. Hill, who proposes instead that the Uto-Aztecan language family originated in central Mexico and spread northwards {{at a very early}} date. This hypothesis and <b>the</b> <b>analyses</b> of data that it rests upon have received serious criticism.|$|E

40|$|Background: In the paper, the {{influence}} of the selected parameters, which are population, travel time to work by car, employment rate and average gross earnings, to labour commuting flows in Slovenia is <b>analysed</b> for <b>the</b> period 2000 – 2009. Furthermore, the dynamics of <b>the</b> <b>analysed</b> parameters have been studied to be implemented in the local policy application. Objectives: The main goal of this research has been to study the stickiness and attractiveness of Slovenian municipalities regarding <b>the</b> <b>analysed</b> parameters to support local labour commuting policy. Methods/Approach: The influence of <b>the</b> <b>analysed</b> parameters to <b>the</b> labour commuting flows has been studied in the extended gravity model. The change of {{the influence}} of parameters on commuting flows has been studied separately for each year in <b>the</b> <b>analysed</b> period. Additionally, <b>the</b> calculation of the extended gravity model has been performed for <b>the</b> whole <b>analysed</b> period. Results: <b>The</b> results show that <b>the</b> <b>analysed</b> parameters more attracted than dispatched the inter-municipal labour commuting flows in Slovenia in the study period. The results of the study of the dynamics of <b>the</b> <b>analysed</b> parameters have been implemented in the case study at the local level. Conclusions: The results provide the important empirical contribution to physical planners at the state, regional and/or local level for creating development policies. The results show that some factors in the gravity model can be compensated with the change of the others and vice-versa...|$|R

The analytic cohort consisted of 291,988 men and 197,623 women aged 50–71 years. Diet was assessed with a self-administered food-frequency questionnaire at baseline in 1995–1996; 2,974 incident colorectal cancer cases were identified during five years of follow-up. The result was that total fiber intake {{was not associated with}} colorectal cancer.

25|$|Laser {{desorption}} electrospray ionization (LDESI) {{mass spectrometry}} is an ambient ionization technique applicable to {{plant and animal}} tissue imaging, live-cell imaging, and most recently to cell-by-cell imaging. This technique uses a mid-IR laser to ablate the sample which creates a cloud of neutral molecules. This cloud is then hit with the electrospray from above to cause ionization. The desorbed ions are then able to pass into the mass spectrometer for analysis. This method is also good for imaging in applications. <b>The</b> <b>analyses</b> can be desorbed through a pulsed laser irradiation without the need of a matrix. This method is best used with small organic molecules up to larger biomolecules as well.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>analyses</b> of Burstein and Sandage {{showed that}} {{lenticular}} galaxies typically have surface brightness {{much greater than}} other spiral classes. It is also thought that lenticular galaxies exhibit a larger bulge-to-disk ratio than spiral galaxies {{and this may be}} inconsistent with simple fading from a spiral. If S0s were formed by mergers of other spirals these observations would be fitting and it would also account for the increased frequency of globular clusters. It should be mentioned, however, that advanced models of the central bulge which include both a general Sersic profile and bar indicate a smaller bulge, and thus a lessened inconsistency. Mergers are also unable to account for the offset from the Tully–Fisher relation without assuming that the merged galaxies were quite different from those we see today.|$|E
