5|$|In 2012 Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) {{introduced}} a new Espanto Jr. {{as part of their}} Generacion 2012 group of wrestlers. In <b>the</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>and</b> months following the introduction of Generacion 2012, Hijo del Espanto (unclear if it was I or II) publicly stated that he and his brother were the rightful holders of the rights to the Espanto name, given to them by the only remaining, living member of the original Los Espantos, Espanto II. Hijo del Espanto demanded that Espanto Jr. changed his name, but neither the wrestler nor CMLL ever responded to the request.|$|E
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>and</b> {{months after}} {{conclusion}} of the Inquiry one possible explanation of the crash began to circulate among employees of ANA. This possibility began with one piece of evidence uncovered by the Inquiry during cross-examination of ANA's ground staff. It was reported that after sunrise {{the morning after the}} crash the one-gallon container used to check Amana's fuel filters was found empty and lying on its side on the apron a short distance from where Amana had been parked. The Inquiry attached no significance to this evidence and did not explore it further.|$|E
5|$|Across the {{affected}} areas, the Red Cross spent about $247,000 to provide food and blankets. In <b>the</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>and</b> {{months following the}} flooding, various international groups provided aid totaling nearly $11million. The United States donated $622,732 worth of assistance, mainly to help with logistical work and relief efforts. The United States military also worked to purify drinking water in Honduras. Canada donated $412,201 worth of assistance, including providing shelter in Honduras and rebuilding schools. The country of Brazil donated about $1.68million worth of food. The Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection department of the European Commission provided nearly $2.2million for relief efforts.

5|$|As the Sole Survivor {{gradually}} expands their influence, tape {{recordings and}} journal entries reveal that despite its popularity, Nuka-World was under threat from serious mismanagement in <b>the</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>and</b> {{months prior to}} the Great War. Gradually, John-Caleb Bradberton, the creator of Nuka-Cola and the architect of Nuka-World, is revealed to have redirected resources to fund Project Cobalt, a weapons development project for the United States military. This culminated in the creation of Nuka-Cola Quantum, a variation of Nuka-Cola made with radioactive isotopes. In exchange for his support, the military agreed to include Bradberton in LEAP-X, an attempt to artificially prolong life; however, Braxton, the general in charge of Project Cobalt, saw Bradberton's prediction of an imminent war as a lack of confidence in the military, and thus betrayed him. When the Sole Survivor accesses Bradberton's office, they discover a hidden elevator leading to a private Vault. Inside is Bradberton's still-living head attached to a life support machine, a punishment by Braxton for doubting the military. The player is given the choice of shutting off the power and euthanizing Bradberton at his request, or keeping him alive for the sake of Sierra Petrovita, a recurring character from Fallout 3 who idolises Bradberton.|$|E
5|$|Both Virginia Tech and Clemson endured {{questions}} about their coaching staffs in <b>the</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>and</b> {{months prior to the}} Gator Bowl. Virginia Tech head coach Frank Beamer was interviewed by North Carolina prior {{to the end of the}} regular season, and he debated whether or not to accept that school's head football coaching job. On November 27, one week before Tech's selection by the Gator Bowl, Beamer announced that he would not be departing for North Carolina or any other school. Beamer also was considered for the vacant head-coaching position with the NFL's Washington Redskins, but he also declined that position. Other Virginia Tech football coaches were targeted by teams to fill vacant head-coaching positions. Virginia Tech offensive coordinator Rickey Bustle was interviewed for a job at Toledo, but he declined the position. Virginia Tech defensive coordinator Bud Foster was interviewed for the head-coaching job at Virginia, but he likewise declined the job.|$|E
5|$|The {{events of}} the early morning of June 28, 1969 were not the first {{instances}} of homosexuals fighting back against police in New York City and elsewhere. Not only had the Mattachine Society been active in major cities such as Los Angeles and Chicago, but similarly marginalized people started the riot at Compton's Cafeteria in 1966, and another riot responded to a raid on Los Angeles' Black Cat Tavern in 1967. However, several circumstances were in place that made the Stonewall riots memorable. The location of the raid was a factor: it was {{across the street from}} The Village Voice offices, and the narrow crooked streets gave the rioters advantage over the police. Many of the participants and residents of Greenwich Village were involved in political organizations that were effectively able to mobilize a large and cohesive gay community in <b>the</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>and</b> months after the rebellion. The most significant facet of the Stonewall riots, however, was the commemoration of them in Christopher Street Liberation Day, which grew into the annual Gay Pride events around the world.|$|E

5|$|The {{relief efforts}} were {{hindered}} by {{the composition of}} the mud, which made it nearly impossible to move through without becoming stuck. By the time relief workers reached Armero twelve hours after the eruption, many of the victims with serious injuries were dead. The relief workers were horrified by the landscape of fallen trees, disfigured human bodies, and piles of debris from entire houses. This was the second-deadliest volcanic disaster of the 20th century, surpassed only by the 1902 eruption of Mount Pelée, and is the fourth-deadliest volcanic event recorded since 1500 AD. The event was a foreseeable catastrophe exacerbated by the populace's unawareness of the volcano's destructive history; geologists and other experts had warned authorities and media outlets about the danger over <b>the</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>and</b> {{days leading up to the}} eruption. Hazard maps for the vicinity were prepared, but poorly distributed. On the day of the eruption, several evacuation attempts were made, but a severe storm restricted communications. Many victims stayed in their houses as they had been instructed, believing that the eruption had ended. The noise from the storm may have prevented many from hearing the sounds from Ruiz until it was too late.|$|E

The fan {{reaction}} kept being positive for Volador Jr. in <b>the</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>and</b> months after his unmasking. On November 23, 2013 Volador Jr. began showing signs of a tecnico turn by shaking hands with his opponent Místico and later on tried to save him from an attack by Los Guerreros Laguneros, before walking out on his Los Invasores partners after the match. His turn was finalized on November 29, when Los Invasores attacked him following a torneo cibernetico elimination match between Los Invasores and representatives of CMLL. In January 2014, Volador Jr. and La Sombra both returned to Japan {{to take part in}} the Fantastica Mania 2014 tour. As part of the tour one show was headlined by the first direct singles match between Volador Jr. and La Sombra, after Volador Jr.'s tecnico turn. The match ended in a ten-minute time limit draw.|$|E

500|$|In <b>the</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>and</b> months {{following}} the assassination, Arghezi's articles blamed the push toward war on Serbian nationalism and the Balkans question at large: [...] "Until such time as when Europe shall incorporate and enslave the Balkans, they will endure as the nest where all of Europe's assassinations are being organized"; [...] "the Serbs have staged an attempt on Austria's existence, in dastardly manner." [...] Arghezi had set his mind on continued neutrality, arguing that it could turn Romania into an arbiter and broker of peace. A similar position was held by Karnabatt.|$|E
500|$|By 26days {{after the}} storm, {{more than half}} of the island had power restored, and the cell phone system was fixed. In <b>the</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>and</b> months after the passage of Sudal, water {{temperatures}} around Yap decreased from [...] to , due to significant upwelling. The drastic decrease caused unusual amounts of fog over the island, as well as significantly lower tides. By September 2004, rebuilding was still underway, and half of the schools, which had previously been used as shelters, reopened to students. Power and water lines were completely restored. The hospital remained damaged with a temporary roof, and although private businesses quickly re-opened, government buildings took longer to be rebuilt; this was due to the lengthy process of receiving aid from FEMA. Additionally, officials required a land survey to determine where structures were safe to be rebuilt.|$|E
500|$|In 2012 Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) {{introduced}} their Generacion 2012, ("Generation 2012"), {{essentially the}} 2012 [...] "graduating class" [...] from CMLL's wrestling school. The group included Oro Jr. Herodes Jr., Taurus, Genesis, Guerrero Negro Jr. and Akuma {{as well as}} Espanto Jr. who wore the distinctive black and white mask of the Los Espantos team. Espanto Jr. was later revealed to be {{the son of the}} original Espanto Jr., who had used the ring name from 1984 until 1994. In <b>the</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>and</b> months following the introduction of Generacion 2012 wrestler, [...] "Hijo del Espanto" [...] (Literally [...] "the Son of Espanto") publicly stated that he was the rightful holder of the rights to the Espanto name, given to him by the only remaining, living member of the original Los Espantos, Espanto II. Hijo del Espanto demanded that Espanto Jr. changed his name, but neither the wrestler nor CMLL ever responded to the request. CMLL never commented on the claim of El Hijo del Espanto, nor did they modify Espanto Jr.'s name or mask design. Previously El Hijo del Espanto had successfully prevented AAA from promoting a different team as [...] "Los Hijos del Espanto", who in fact were uncles of Espanto Jr., Sergio and César Andrade Salas. While the claim was successful in 2001, the Mexico City boxing and wrestling commission did not block CMLL's usage of the name [...] "Espanto Jr." [...] as CMLL continued to promote Espanto Jr. even after the claim by El Hijo del Espanto.|$|E

2500|$|Retrograde amnesia is most {{marked for}} events {{occurring}} in the weeks or months before treatment, with one study showing that although some people lose memories from years prior to treatment, recovery of such memories was [...] "virtually complete" [...] by seven months post-treatment, with the only enduring loss being memories in <b>the</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>and</b> {{months prior to the}} treatment. Anterograde memory loss is usually limited to the time of treatment itself or shortly afterwards. In <b>the</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>and</b> months following ECT these memory problems gradually improve, but some people have persistent losses, especially with bilateral ECT. One published review summarizing the results of questionnaires about subjective memory loss found that between 29% and 55% of respondents believed they experienced long-lasting or permanent memory changes. In 2000, American psychiatrist Sarah Lisanby and colleagues found that bilateral ECT left patients with more persistently impaired memory of public events as compared to RUL ECT.|$|E
