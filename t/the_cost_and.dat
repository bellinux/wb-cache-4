5|$|Since the FairTax {{would not}} tax used goods, the value would be {{determined}} by the supply and demand in relation to new goods. The price differential/margins between used and new goods would stay consistent, as <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>and</b> value of used goods are in direct relationship to <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>and</b> value of the new goods. Because the U.S. tax system has a hidden effect on prices, it is expected that moving to the FairTax would decrease production costs from the removal of business taxes and compliance costs, which is predicted to offset a portion of the FairTax effect on prices.|$|E
5|$|In 1989 the Walled Meadow {{was sold}} for {{redevelopment}} {{and the club}} moved to the brand new Portway Stadium, which {{is located on the}} West Portway Industrial Estate.

After much deliberation over <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>and</b> distance of travel involved in Southern League football, the club voluntarily stepped down the pyramid ladder to join the Wessex League in 1993–94.|$|E
5|$|Since the FairTax {{would not}} tax used goods, {{some critics have}} argued that this would create a {{differential}} between the price of new and used goods, which may take years to equalize. Such a differential would certainly influence the sale of new goods like vehicles and homes. Similarly, some supporters have claimed that this would create an incentive to buy used goods, creating environmental benefits of re-use and re-sale. Conversely, {{it is argued that}} like the income tax system that contains embedded tax cost (see Theories of retail pricing), used goods would contain the embedded FairTax cost. While the FairTax would not be applied to the retail sales of used goods, the inherent value of a used good includes the taxes paid when the good was sold at retail. The value is determined by the supply and demand in relation to new goods. The price differential / margins between used and new goods should stay consistent, as <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>and</b> value of used goods are in direct relationship to <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>and</b> value of the new goods.|$|E

The design of Bold Orion was simple, using parts developed for other missile systems to reduce <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>and</b> development time of the project. The initial Bold Orion configuration was a single-stage vehicle, using a Thiokol TX-20 Sergeant solid-fuel rocket. Following initial testing, the Bold Orion configuration was altered to become a two-stage vehicle, an Allegany Ballistics Laboratory Altair upper stage being added to the missile.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{summarise}} and provide analyses of the considerable body of research that investigates <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>and</b> benefits of vocational education and training (VET). It does so from three different perspectives; the government, business and the individual. This paper considers a broad array of <b>costs</b> <b>and</b> benefits accruing to each of these perspectives, broadly dividing them into two categories: financial (market) or non-financial (non-market). It also describes some of the challenges encountered in investigating <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>and</b> benefits and estimating the return on the investment in VET. Understanding <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>and</b> benefits associated with VET enables decisions about Investing in education and training. For government, analyses of the return on investment provide feedback on the performance of the system and programs and enable justification of, or changes to, existing funding levels.

5|$|Alternatively, where a {{suitable}} {{head of water}} is not available, pumped-storage hydroelectricity {{or other forms of}} grid energy storage such as compressed air energy storage and thermal energy storage can store energy developed by high-wind periods and release it when needed. The type of storage needed depends on the wind penetration level – low penetration requires daily storage, and high penetration requires both short and long term storage – as long as a month or more. Stored energy increases the economic value of wind energy since it can be shifted to displace higher cost generation during peak demand periods. The potential revenue from this arbitrage can offset <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>and</b> losses of storage. For example, in the UK, the 1.7 GW Dinorwig pumped-storage plant evens out electrical demand peaks, and allows base-load suppliers to run their plants more efficiently. Although pumped-storage power systems are only about 75% efficient, and have high installation costs, their low running costs and ability to reduce the required electrical base-load can save both fuel and total electrical generation costs.|$|E
5|$|Basilicata {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Castellammare {{shipyard}} on 9 August 1913, {{the same day as}} Campania. Both ships were built on the same slipway. They were launched {{less than a year later}} on 23 July 1914. Fitting-out work proceeded more slowly on Basilicata, and she was completed on 1 August 1917, four months after her sister ship. After completion, Basilicata was stationed in Italian Libya. On 13 August 1919, while moored in Tewfik at the southern end of the Suez Canal, one of Basilicatas boilers exploded, which sank the ship. Salvage operations began thereafter, and on 12 September 1920, the ship was refloated. The Regia Marina decided that repairing the ship was not worth <b>the</b> <b>cost,</b> <b>and</b> so on 1 July 1921 she was sold to ship breakers in Suez.|$|E
5|$|Impressed {{with the}} film's script, V. Srinivas Mohan became the visual effects {{supervisor}} in December2007.

Both Mohan and Shankar visited several visual effects companies, including the New Zealand-based Weta Digital and the United States-based Industrial Light & Magic, Cafe FX and Tippett Studio before partnering with Legacy Effects. The original Eros-Ayngaran visual effects budget was 700million, but after Sun Pictures took over production, it was significantly reduced to 200million. As a result, the visual effects team had to omit and alter some sequences, making Chitti wear sunglasses {{for most of the}} film to reduce <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>and</b> difficultly of animating his eyes.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the conceptual framework several additional factors enabled the GWA studies. One was the advent of biobanks, which are repositories of human genetic material that greatly reduced <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>and</b> difficulty of collecting sufficient numbers of biological specimens for study. Another was the International HapMap Project, which, from 2003 identified {{a majority of the}} common SNPs interrogated in a GWA study. The haploblock structure identified by HapMap project also allowed the focus on the subset of SNPs that would describe most of the variation. Also the development of the methods to genotype all these SNPs using genotyping arrays was an important prerequisite.|$|E
5|$|It {{is likely}} that the castle was built by one of the earls of Chester, partly because of <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>and</b> partly because Cheshire was a palatine county and the earl had {{authority}} over who was permitted to build castles. The earls were involved in the civil war of King Stephen’s reign {{in the middle of the}} 12th century commonly known as the Anarchy and the revolt against Henry II in 117374, both of which may have prompted castle building. Ranulf de Gernon, 4th Earl of Chester wanted control of the earldom of Carlisle but during the Anarchy it and much of northern England come under Scottish control. The construction of Buckton Castle may have been to safeguard Cheshire. These civil wars and rebellions would also have provided a context for the deliberate destruction of the castle. Alternatively the castle could have been built by William de Neville when he held the lordship of Longdendale under the earl of Chester between 1181 and 1186, though he may not have had the financial means to do so.|$|E

5|$|The {{bridge was}} closed to motor {{vehicles}} on 15 February 2010 for refurbishment and strengthening. It was originally expected to remain closed for approximately 18 months, but after {{the condition of the}} bridge was found to be worse than expected, it was closed for 22 months. All of the timber in the decking as well as the footway that had rotted away were replaced, with additional timber added for strengthening. Surfaces at the carriageway and pavement decking were replaced. New steel structures were added to strengthen the bridge. All the lightbulbs were changed to more energy-efficient ones. The tollbooths were refurbished. All twelve layers of paint were stripped down until the bare metal was exposed, which was repaired and treated before three new coats of paint were added. The whole project cost £7.2 million of which the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea provided 25% of <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>and</b> the other 75% was provided by Transport for London.|$|E
5|$|The county {{facilities}} in the bailey were expanded during these years, with improvements to the Grand Jury House and the Common Hall, but by the 1680s {{the role of the}} military garrison at York Castle was being called into question. Sir Christopher Musgrave produced a report for the Crown in 1682; he argued that it would cost at least £30,000 to turn the castle into a modern fortification, producing a proposal for the six bastions that such a star fort would require. This work was never carried out. Meanwhile, the garrison and the castle had become extremely unpopular with the people of York, who disliked both <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>and</b> the imposition of external authority.|$|E
5|$|The predilection of the Welsh for roasted cheese led to {{the dish}} of Welsh rarebit, or Welsh rabbit, {{seasoned}} melted cheese poured over toasted bread.

Welsh folk rarely ate rabbit due to <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>and</b> as land owners would not allow rabbit hunting, so the term is more likely a slur on the Welsh. The name evolved from rabbit to rarebit, possibly to remove the slur from Welsh cuisine or due to simple reinterpretation of the word to make menus more pleasant.|$|E
