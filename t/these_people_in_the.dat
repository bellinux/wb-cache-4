Wellesley Electric Light, however, serviced none of <b>these</b> <b>people.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> beginning, Wellesley Electric Light purchased {{all of its}} current from the Natick Gas & Electric Company in neighboring Natick, Massachusetts, and devoted its capabilities exclusively to street lighting. A report from the Massachusetts Commission gives the first record of service to private customers in Wellesley on July 1, 1904, almost twelve years after the foundation of Wellesley Electric Light.|$|E

Luna, Jansen, Whitehead, and Birdsell reprise their roles from {{earlier in the}} series. When asked whether the series still wanted to pursue stories about Inhumans such as James, Whedon said they are [...] "still in our world, so we still have some of <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mix ... but right now we’re on the Ghost Rider kick." [...] On having Johnson and Reyes join up with S.H.I.E.L.D., Whedon called it uneasy [...] "for everyone involved. Daisy {{has made it very}} clear that she doesn’t want to be with our team. There’s all that history and pain there. For Robbie, this is a guy who has never had a team, and probably doesn’t function well within one. We’ll see pretty quickly that it’s an uneasy alliance and it’s going to cause a lot of drama." ...|$|E

Kỳ further accused some of the HNC members of being communist sympathizers and cowards who wanted to stop the military from strengthening. He promised to explain the decision at a media conference and vowed that he and his colleagues would return to purely military roles in the near future. Thiệu added [...] "I do not see how our action has hurt the Hương government...Hương now has the full support of the Army and has no worries from the High National Council, which we have eliminated."

2500|$|In the 1900s, Aurel Stein {{discovered}} Prakrit documents written Kharoṣṭhī in Niya, {{and together}} with the founding legend of Khotan, Stein proposed that <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Tarim Basin were Indian immigrants from Taxila who conquered and colonized Khotan. [...] The use of Prakrit however may be {{a legacy of the}} influence of the Kushan Empire. [...] There were also Greek influences in early Khotan based on evidence such as Hellenistic artworks found at various sites in the Tarim Basin, for example, the Sampul tapestry found near Khotan, tapestries depicting the Greek god Hermes and the winged pegasus found at nearby Loulan, as well ceramics that may suggest influences from as far as the Hellenistic kingdom of the Ptolemaic Egypt. One suggestion is therefore that the early migrants to the region [...] may have been an ethnically mixed people from the city of Taxila led by a Greco-Saka or an Indo-Greek leader, and established Khotan using the administrative and social organizations of the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{automobile}} {{production line}} {{was created by}} Karl Benz in Germany in 1888. The widespread appearance of telephones occurred {{at the beginning of}} the 20th century, along with other modern means of communication, including radio. For the average American who had not eaten in a restaurant in his or her entire life, the fast food chains that appeared in the cities offered an alternative form of restaurant in which eating was very much a public activity. The concept of a [...] "greasy spoon" [...] was thus born with these restaurants, in which hygiene suffered in exchange for more inexpensive food. On the other hand, there was a growing interconnected world in which trips by car, bus, and rail became increasingly available. All these means of transport were improving at the time, and soon it was necessary to feed a growing population that was [...] "in permanent transit", frequently moving through different cities on business. George Pullman invented the sleeping car and the dining car in response to the needs of <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1870s. Similarly, the English immigrant Frederick Henry Harvey was the first to use [...] "dynamic mass movement" [...] in restoring the Fred Harvey Company, which catered to the patrons of a chain of hotels located near railway stations, as well as offering catering, services, and high quality products on the trains themselves.|$|E
