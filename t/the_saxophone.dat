5|$|The clarinet's {{place in}} the jazz {{ensemble}} was usurped by <b>the</b> <b>saxophone,</b> which projects a more powerful sound and uses a less complicated fingering system. The requirement for an increased speed of execution in modern jazz also did not favour the clarinet, but the clarinet did not entirely disappear. A few players such as Buddy DeFranco, Tony Scott, and Jimmy Giuffre emerged during the 1950s playing bebop or other styles. A little later, Eric Dolphy (on bass clarinet), Perry Robinson, John Carter, Theo Jörgensmann, and others used the clarinet in free jazz. The French composer and clarinetist Jean-Christian Michel initiated a jazz-classical cross-over on the clarinet with the drummer Kenny Clarke.|$|E
5|$|In 1922, {{while living}} in Watts, he joined Scouting. He {{attended}} Compton High School from 1925 through 1928, where he played <b>the</b> <b>saxophone</b> in a dance band. His passion for music carried over into his career; he helped write songs for his cartoons, including the theme for The Flintstones. Hanna became an Eagle Scout as a youth and remained active in Scouting throughout his life. As an adult, {{he served as a}} Scoutmaster and was recognized by the Boy Scouts of America with their Distinguished Eagle Scout Award in 1985. Despite his numerous career-related awards, Hanna was most proud of this Distinguished Eagle Scout Award. His interests also included sailing and singing in a barbershop quartet. Hanna studied both journalism and structural engineering at Compton City College, but had to drop out of college with the onset of the Great Depression.|$|E
5|$|Pebe {{moved the}} family to Nashville, Tennessee, in 1991 after {{securing}} a new publishing deal for her songwriting. Pebe frequently brought Kesha and her brothers along to recording studios and encouraged Kesha to sing when she noticed Kesha's vocal talent. Kesha attended Franklin High School and Brentwood High School, but claimed {{that she did not}} fit in, explaining that her unconventional style (e.g., homemade purple velvet pants and purple hair) did not endear her to other students. She played the trumpet and later <b>the</b> <b>saxophone</b> in the marching band in school, and described herself in an interview with NPR as being a diligent student. After attaining a near-perfect score on her SATs, she was offered a full scholarship at Barnard College, but instead chose to drop out before graduation to pursue her music career.|$|E

5|$|The Tic Code was in {{development}} {{for five years}} before finally being made. Principal photography took place on location in New York City in 1997, on a budget of US$2 million. The film was directed by Gary Winick, who took over after original director Norman René died during pre-production. It was written by Polly Draper, who also produced alongside Karen Tangorra, Midge Sanford, Sarah Pillsbury and Larry Meistrich. Draper based the screenplay on the experiences of her noted jazz musician husband Michael Wolff, who has Tourette syndrome. Wolff's involvement as co-producer ensured the cooperation of jazz club The Village Vanguard, which granted the production permission to use its name and exterior shots of the building. Herman Leonard loaned his collection of photographs of famous jazz musicians, and the Blue Note jazz club allowed its name to be used on fake fliers. Wolff also provided the film's piano score, to which Alex Foster also contributed by providing the soundtrack for scenes of Hines' playing <b>the</b> <b>saxophone.</b>|$|E
5|$|The video {{opens with}} Inna {{answering}} {{to a call}} she gets from Stan on her Lenovo smartphone, of which the ringtone is <b>the</b> <b>saxophone</b> riff featured in the song. Subsequently, both are presented standing {{close to each other}} in front of a red backdrop and a cactus. The next scene portrays Stan and some backup dancers hanging out in the dressing room of a club, with her eventually going downstairs to the full party hall and later meeting Inna there. Next, Yankee makes a cameo appearance in the clip, followed by both singers performing a synchronized choreography. The video ends in the same way it opens. Cut scenes portray Yankee, Stan and Inna singing and dancing to the song in front of yellow, green and blue backdrops, Inna performing to the club's crowd or Stan dancing on a runaway.|$|E
25|$|In the 20th and 21st centuries, <b>the</b> <b>saxophone</b> found {{increased}} {{popularity in}} symphony orchestras. In {{one or another}} size, the instrument has also been found as a useful accompaniment to genres such as opera and choral music. Many musical theatre scores include parts for a saxophone, sometimes doubling another woodwind or brass instrument. In this way, <b>the</b> <b>saxophone</b> serves as a middle point between other woodwinds and the brass section, helping to blend them.|$|E

50|$|Instruments with rolled toneholes {{have been}} {{manufactured}} by companies including Conn (between 1921 and 1947), Keilwerth, Kohlert and SML (Strasser-Marigaux-Lemaire). As of 2010, {{there are only}} two companies manufacturing rolled tone hole saxophones: Keilwerth and P.Mauriat. They each have their own ways of making their rolled tone holes. P.Mauriat’s tone holes are formed from <b>the</b> <b>saxophone’s</b> existing material. In other words, they are rolled from the instruments original tone hole. Keilwerth uses a rolled cap that is soldered onto <b>the</b> <b>saxophone’s</b> straight tone hole. Each process affects the sound differently.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> subcontrabass <b>{{saxophone}}</b> {{is a type}} of saxophone that Adolphe Sax patented {{and planned}} to build but never constructed. Sax called this imagined instrument saxophone bourdon (named after the lowest stop on the pipe organ). It is a transposing instrument pitched in B, one octave below <b>the</b> bass <b>saxophone,</b> two octaves below <b>the</b> tenor <b>saxophone,</b> and three octaves and a major second below its written pitch.|$|R

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>saxophone</b> first gained {{popularity}} {{in one of}} the uses it was designed for: military bands. Although the instrument was mostly ignored in Germany at first, French and Belgian military bands took full advantage of the instrument that Sax had designed. Most French and Belgian military bands incorporate at least a quartet of saxophones, comprising an E baritone, B tenor, E alto and B soprano. These four instruments have proved the most popular of all of Sax's creations, with the E contrabass and B bass usually considered impractically large and the E sopranino insufficiently powerful. British military bands tend to include at minimum two saxophonists, on the alto and tenor. Today, <b>the</b> <b>saxophone</b> is used in military bands all around the world.|$|E
25|$|At age fifteen, {{he began}} {{learning}} <b>the</b> <b>saxophone</b> {{in a band}} with Solomiral, an Antananarivo jazz fusion band, then informally with Toty Band and a more traditional music group from Southern Madagascar, Tsimihole. In 1992, he participated in his first Madajazzcar Festival, accompanied by an informal group created for the occasion.|$|E
50|$|Most modern bass {{clarinets}} are straight-bodied, {{with a small}} upturned silver-colored {{metal bell}} and a curved metal neck. Early examples varied in shape, some having a doubled body making them look similar to bassoons. The bass clarinet is fairly heavy and is supported either with a neck strap or with an adjustable peg attached to its body. While Adolphe Sax imitated its upturned metal bell in his design of <b>the</b> larger <b>saxophones,</b> <b>the</b> two instruments are fundamentally different. Bass clarinet bodies are most often made of grenadilla (African Blackwood) or (more commonly for student-instruments) plastic resin, while saxophones are typically made entirely of metal. (All-metal bass clarinets do exist, but are rare.) More significantly, all clarinets including the bass have a bore that is basically the same diameter along {{the body of the}} instrument. This cylindrical bore differs from <b>the</b> <b>saxophone's</b> conical one and gives the clarinet its characteristic tone, causing it to overblow at the twelfth compared with <b>the</b> <b>saxophone's</b> octave.|$|R
