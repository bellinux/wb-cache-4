5|$|All Type IXA {{submarines}} {{were ordered}} by the Kriegsmarine between 29 July 1936 and 21 November 1936 as part of Plan Z and the overall German plan of re-armament {{in violation of the}} Treaty of Versailles. The design of the IXA submarines was derived from the German Type IA submarine. All contracts for the construction of the submarines were awarded to DeSchiMAG AG Weser, Bremen. The first U-boat <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>laid</b> down in the Bremen ship yards was U-37, whose keel was laid down on 15 March 1937. The last U-boat <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>laid</b> down was , whose construction began on 15 September 1937. By November 1939, all eight submarines had been fully constructed and commissioned into the Kriegsmarine.|$|E

5|$|The damp {{conditions}} meant {{required a}} large amount of sawdust <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>laid</b> down to help the players keep their grip. Along with the rain, the humid conditions assisted the Australian bowlers, who were able to make the ball bounce at variable heights.|$|E
50|$|The Anglican Bath Abbey Cemetery, officially {{dedicated}} as the Cemetery of St Peter and St Paul (the patron saints that Bath Abbey <b>is</b> dedicated <b>to),</b> <b>was</b> <b>laid</b> out by noted cemetery {{designer and}} landscape architect John Claudius Loudon (1783-1843) in 1843 on a picturesque hillside site overlooking Bath, Somerset, England. The cemetery <b>was</b> <b>laid</b> out between 1843 and 1844.|$|R

5|$|The {{historical}} {{consensus is}} that responsibility or guilt for the war was not attached to the article. Rather, the clause was a prerequisite to allow a legal basis <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>laid</b> out for the reparation payments that were to be made. Historians have also highlighted the unintended damage created by the clause, which caused anger and resentment amongst the German population.|$|E
5|$|The {{player is}} {{supposed}} to find five Tarot cards in the game in order to solve a crucial puzzle. Each card triggers a cut-scene. When collected, they are arranged in a nine-pane grid to solve the puzzle. The difficulty level determines what clues are given and what order the cards need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>laid</b> out.|$|E
5|$|Work {{began on}} electrifying the former LCDR {{suburban}} routes in 1924. Herne Hill station was extensively remodelled {{as part of}} these works: the eastern island platform was lengthened; the original island platform was demolished and replaced by one further west, allowing two tracks <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>laid</b> between the island platforms; the western sidings were removed; and the upper floor was closed to passengers.|$|E
50|$|The first 40 km (approximately 25 miles) from Ulm <b>to</b> Biberach <b>are</b> <b>laid</b> {{out as a}} dual carriageway.|$|R
50|$|The {{rock goby}} reproduces in spring. It nests in rocky areas near the kelp forest, Up <b>to</b> 7000 eggs <b>are</b> <b>laid,</b> {{in a single}} layer, under rocks and shells. The eggs (up <b>to</b> 7000) <b>are</b> <b>laid</b> {{in a single layer}} (2.5 mm in height) and guarded aggressively by the male. The eggs hatch in about 19 days.|$|R

5|$|Construction {{began on}} Vladimir Monomakh on 22 February 1881 at the Baltic Shipyard in St. Petersburg, {{although}} the formal keel-laying ceremony was not held until 21 May. She was launched on 22 October 1882 and completed on 13 July 1883. The ship's total cost was 3,348,847 rubles. Although the second vessel <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>laid</b> {{down in the}} Dmitri Donskoy class, Vladimir Monomakh was completed first. Due to constant changes during construction, the design of both vessels diverged considerably {{by the time of}} completion. The ship was named after Vladimir II Monomakh, Grand Prince of Kiev.|$|E
5|$|In Japan, the two battleships of the 1903-4 Programme {{were the}} first <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>laid</b> down as all-big-gun designs, with eight 12-inch guns. However, the design had armor which was {{considered}} too thin, demanding a substantial redesign. The financial pressures of the Russo-Japanese War and the short supply of 12-inch guns {{which had to be}} imported from Britain meant these ships were completed with a mixed 10- and 12-inch armament. The 1903-4 design also retained traditional triple-expansion steam engines.|$|E
5|$|Mongolian {{belongs to}} the Mongolic languages. The {{delimitation}} of the Mongolian language within Mongolic is a much disputed theoretical problem, one whose resolution is impeded {{by the fact that}} existing data for the major varieties is not easily arrangeable according to a common set of linguistic criteria. Such data might account for the historical development of the Mongolian dialect continuum, as well as for its sociolinguistic qualities. Though phonological and lexical studies are comparatively well developed, the basis has yet <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>laid</b> for a comparative morphosyntactic study, for example between such highly diverse varieties as Khalkha and Khorchin.|$|E

5|$|The Monarch-class {{ships were}} ordered in May 1892 with Budapest and Wien {{to be built}} at the Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino {{shipyard}} in Trieste. Both ships were laid down on 16 February 1893, the first ships in the class <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>laid</b> down. Budapest was launched on 27 April 1896 by Countess Marie Széchényí-Andrássy, wife of the Governor of Fiume, and commissioned on 12 May 1898.|$|E
5|$|The Pipeline Authorization Act {{required}} the pipeline {{to be able}} to withstand the maximum earthquake ever recorded in the area it was built. When crossing the Denali Fault, Teflon-coated sliders were designed to allow the pipeline to move side-to-side in an earthquake. To protect against forward-and-backward shocks and to allow for thermal expansion, the pipeline wasn't designed as a straight line. Instead, it was intended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>laid</b> in an S-shape, and the bends would allow for expansion and movement without breaking.|$|E
5|$|The {{bodies of}} Warwick and Montagu {{were laid out}} 'on the morrow after' and 'openly shewed and naked' in St. Paul's, to prevent rumour {{starting}} that they had in fact survived the battle; Warkworth too said that the King personally directed this, and arranged for the corpses 'to {{be put in a}} cart... <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>laid</b> in the church of Paul's, on the pavement, that every man might see them; and so they lay for three or four days' before granting permission to their brother George for their burial at Bisham Priory.|$|E

5|$|The {{bodies of}} the two Neville {{brothers}} were brought back to London. They did not suffer the customary fate accorded to traitors—quartering and display at the city gates. Edward exhibited the brothers' naked corpses in St. Paul's Cathedral for three days to quell any rumours that they had survived, before allowing them <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>laid</b> {{to rest in the}} family vault at Bisham Abbey.|$|E
5|$|The {{foundation}} of Bartholdi's statue was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>laid</b> inside Fort Wood, a disused army base on Bedloe's Island constructed between 1807 and 1811. Since 1823, it had rarely been used, though during the Civil War, it {{had served as}} a recruiting station. The fortifications of the structure were in the shape of an eleven-point star. The statue's foundation and pedestal were aligned so that it would face southeast, greeting ships entering the harbor from the Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
5|$|The line winds {{south from}} Llanhilleth for miles (4.5km), past {{the village of}} Crumlin, to the next station at Newbridge, at {{the eastern end of}} Newbridge town centre. Newbridge station {{provides}} Park and Ride car park and bus interchange facilities. To enable the additional service between Ebbw Vale and Newport to begin dual track would need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>laid</b> and second platforms constructed at Llanhilleth and Newbridge stations, allowing trains to pass each other.|$|E

5|$|The {{ships were}} {{originally}} intended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>laid</b> down 1 September 1939, {{but they were}} delayed until November to allow improvements to the shipyards to be completed. A total of sixteen ships were planned in the August 1939 building program, but this was scaled back to four in July 1940 and two in October 1940 {{when it became clear}} just how unprepared the Soviets were for any large-scale naval construction program. Work on these ships ceased shortly after the German invasion.|$|E
5|$|In 1646, {{the council}} allowed the Barber Surgeons {{to build their}} hall {{just east of the}} site: this {{agreement}} was given on 15 March 1647. In 1648, the plot of land was leased to the barber surgeons on condition that they constructed their hall within two years and that part of the site was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>laid</b> out as a garden for medicinal herbs. A second hall built in 1730 disappeared under the railway viaduct in the 1840s. The most aged claimants were preferred for placements at the Hospital and on 22 March 1779, the Mayor and common council of Newcastle ordered that several candidates produce certificates to prove their respective ages, to be filed in the town-clerk's office.|$|E
5|$|In mid-2013, {{work had}} resumed {{in the tunnel}} segment between 99th Street and 105th Street, {{involving}} the addition of track and signals, mechanical and plumbing equipment, and upgrading the tunnels to meet modern fire code standards. , the station was 65% excavated. Rails for the line had arrived and were being stored in the station cavern; {{about one-third of the}} rails for the line had arrived by then, enough for tracks <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>laid</b> from 105th to 87th Streets. By spring 2014, the mezzanine was completed, and roof slabs were being installed; tracks and signal brackets were also installed north of the station. By April 2015, the station was 67% complete, and by April 2016, the station was 91% complete. The station was scheduled to be completed by June 2016, but this was later pushed back to fall 2016.|$|E
