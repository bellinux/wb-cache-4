40|$|Abstract. Computer-aided {{ergonomics}} design (CAED) is {{the combination}} of several academics knowledge, which includes computer engineering and technique, man-machine engineering and dynamics. In the paper, computer-aided ergonomics design <b>technique</b> <b>in</b> industrial product design is presented. Then, the structure of computer-aided ergonomics design <b>technique</b> <b>in</b> industrial product design is given {{and the application of}} the computer-aided ergonomics design is presented in the study. Simulation evaluation for design project in the front period can shorten the period and cost from design to manufacture and reduce the time of designer. The experimental results indicate that computer-aided ergonomics design <b>technique</b> <b>in</b> industrial product design proposed in the paper is feasible. Therefore, computer-aided ergonomics design <b>technique</b> <b>in</b> industrial product design has widely application space...|$|R
