5|$|In February 1907, {{with nearly}} 300 new stockholders, Harvey began {{construction}} {{on his next}} hotel, Oklahoma Row, also designed by A. O. Clarke. It was built {{to the west of}} Missouri Row with a wide lawn. It had a similar log, concrete stone, and tile construction. The dining room was on the north end. Each of the 40 rooms had fireplaces, as did <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> center hall. Every room featured electric lights, sewerage, and running spring water. The hotel also boasted a three-story concrete tower, one of the earliest multistory concrete constructions in the country. Oklahoma Row and other construction projects drained Harvey's funds. Harvey managed to raise enough money to finish Oklahoma Row, but due to his lack of funds, when that hotel finally opened there was no gala event, as there had been when Missouri Row was finished.|$|E
5|$|The 1828 {{construction}} {{features a}} central hall with three {{rooms on the}} east and west sides of roughly symmetrical construction with chimneys at the intersection of the front and middle rooms. The first floor chimneys were flanked by doors allowing access to the other rooms and storage on the other side. The layout and usage of the jail is not known for certain, but it is believed that the rooms to the west were used by the jailer and his family. The first room as a parlor, the middle as <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> the rear room as the kitchen. As part of the renovations in 1959, the Society changed the parlor to a research room, the dining room into a library and added a door to the stairway from the kitchen. The front research room and library retain the original fireplaces, pine floorboards and closets, but the connecting passage between the two rooms were changed to a bathroom. The east side of the jail {{is believed to have been}} used by the jailer for his occupational duties, with the front room as a public reception room and the middle room as his office. The rear room in the back may have been used for record or other storage. After leasing the property, the Society removed the partitions in the rooms that separated the rooms from each other.|$|E

25|$|Order of precedence: {{even without}} showy display, {{a group of}} people walking forward may be said to form a {{procession}} if their order and placement clearly visualize a hierarchy or symbiotic relationship. For instance, one's nearness to the king or others of high rank had important political connotations when the royal family walked to or from chapel services at the palace of Versailles. Similarly, precedence came into play when the grandest Edwardian parties progressed from the sitting room to <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> the stylized movement and hierarchy of marching military units clearly sets up a formal procession.|$|E
25|$|The demonstrators {{managed to}} voice their demands, but since the {{television}} station had already ceased its transmission due to the riot, it was not aired live. The building was abandoned about 02:30 by the police. After that, the mob entered the premises. Some of the intruders merely took pictures of themselves and the scene, while others destroyed <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> the main hall of the building. The historical television technology exhibition was also demolished: valuable vintage equipment was smashed and techno-historical objects like vintage props were stolen, as were some expensive plasma TV sets. Arson was also reported. All these acts were aired and/or verified by reports from state television officials, police and media coverage.|$|E

Police said he committed suicide by cutting the artery on his wrist and taking poison. A suicide note cited mental torture by the CBI. The CBI had alleged that Augustine had destroyed evidence and closed the case as a suicide, but the case diary revealed it was Augustine who pointed {{to the possibility of}} homicide. He had recorded that Abhaya could have seen something objectionable in <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> could have been silenced.

2500|$|Because of the {{provisions}} made for conversion to run on nuclear power, the Leonardo da Vinci had a somewhat unusual interior layout. [...] Space for a reactor was reserved amidship, {{in and around the}} ship's steam turbine power plant. [...] This made it necessary to locate <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>and</b> galleys one deck higher than usual, and separated from the ship's main working passage. [...] No passenger corridors passed through the area reserved for a reactor, which meant the forward and rear passenger-accessible sections on the lowest decks were entirely separated from each other.|$|R

25|$|The {{house has}} a classic Beaux-Arts plan, with the major public rooms on its ground floor – the central Elliptical Hall, Dining Room, and Living Room – all in one line, {{parallel}} to the Hudson River. North and South Foyers provide transitional space from the Hall to <b>the</b> <b>Dining</b> <b>Room</b> <b>and</b> Living Room. Five secondary spaces are located off the Elliptical Hall: the Lobby, Den, Gold Room, Grand Stair Hall, and Lavatory. The second floor rooms, comprising Mrs. Vanderbilt's suite of Bedroom, Boudoir and Bathroom (designed by Ogden Codman), Mr. Vanderbilt's Bedroom and Bathroom, Guest Bedrooms and Baths and the Linen Room, are disposed around the Second Floor Hall and the North and South Foyers. The third floor contains five additional guest bedrooms, and a Servants' Hall separated from the guests' rooms by a door at the main staircase. Supported by both concrete and steel, the Vanderbilt mansion was considered modern for its time. The mansion also included plumbing and forced hot air central heating and electric lighting which was powered by a hydroelectric plant built on the estate on the Crumb Elbow stream. The Vanderbilt estate had electric lighting before the surrounding area.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} half of the 17th century, the {{population}} of Paris nearly doubled, reaching 400,000 at the end of the reign of Louis XIII in 1643. To facilitate communication between the Right Bank and Left Bank, Louis XIII built five new bridges over the Seine, doubling the existing number. The nobility, government officials and the wealthy built elegant hôtels particuliers, or town residences, on the Right Bank in the new Faubourg Saint-Honoré, the Faubourg Saint-Jacques, and in the Marais near the Place des Vosges. The new residences featured two new and original specialized rooms: <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> the salon. One good example in its original form, the Hôtel de Sully (1625–1630), between the Place des Vosges and Rue Saint-Antoine, can be seen today. The old ferryboat between the Louvre and the Rue de Bac on the Left Bank (bac designates a flat boat ferry) was replaced by a wooden and then a stone bridge, the Pont Royal, finished by Louis XIV. Near the end of new bridge on the Left Bank, a new fashionable neighborhood, the Faubourg Saint-Germain, soon appeared. Under Louis XIII, two small islands in the Seine, the Île Notre-Dame and the Île-aux-vaches, which had been used for grazing cattle and storing firewood, were combined to form the Île Saint-Louis, which became the site of the splendid hôtels particuliers of Parisian financiers.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the house, {{there are}} {{numerous}} love quotes written by Oscar Wilde, William Shakespeare, Fyodor Dostoevsky, and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. In <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> kitchen, the furniture are in bright red and yellow colors, and logs stacked against each other fill up a wall. The walkway to the Head of Household room evokes a giant library. The Head of Household room is an exotic island oasis. The headboard is made from a surfboard, there are Hula girl table lamps, rattan carpet and Polynesian knickknacks. The boat bedroom features shelves and chests designed to resemble small rowboats with rowboat shaped beds. Two large beds made of actual unfinished tree branches with pink bedspreads fill another room. The living room features a giant green semi-circular sofa, and a stone wall fireplace. A red colored room connected directly {{to the living room}} by a short hallway, with no doors, has a pair of pullout couches rather than actual beds. New this season is a Spa room complete with a massage table, two-person sauna and lounge. The spa room would be featured in numerous subsequent seasons. Outside, there is a hot tub and pool, a billiards table and lounge area. The lounge area features a fire pit and heated lamps. Along with work-out equipment, there are lawn chairs to lay out in the sun. The outside also includes the washing machine and clothes dryer, both of which are covered overhead.|$|E

25|$|Whoever the {{architect}} was, {{the new south}} wing was intended to transform Brympton d'Evercy from a country manor to a grand house. Of ten bays, the two storied building housed on its ground floor the finest and most lavishly decorated rooms of the house. Known as the state apartments, they follow an arrangement common in houses built before circa 1720 where important guests were received and stayed. Basically they were a large bedroom suite or apartment, with all the rooms on an , connected by large double doors creating an enfilade. The first, largest and grandest room, known as the salon, was intended for the visiting dignitary to grant audience to the household, all of whom would be permitted access to this room. The following room was a large withdrawing room, slightly less grand; here the honoured guest would receive more privately than in the saloon. The next room followed the same pattern, each space becoming more intimate and private as the enfilade progressed. The final, and most private room, was the state bedroom: beyond this were two small closets for staff and private ablutions. This suite pattern of Baroque apartments exists in large houses all over England; in the very largest, such as Blenheim Palace, {{it was possible to}} have two such suites branching off from either side of the saloon. However Brympton d'Evercy was not a large or very grand house. Why Brympton d'Evercy needed a suite of state apartments has never been truly answered. It has often been said they were built for an intended visit of Queen Anne, but they were at the very least ten years old when she ascended the throne, and she certainly never visited the house. The state bed remained in situ until 1956, but was never slept in by a sovereign. Circa 1720 the fashion for state rooms became antiquated, and they were often transformed for more general and frequent use. This was true at Brympton d'Evercy: the saloon became the Drawing room, the following room became known as the Oak or small drawing room, the next room <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> only the state bedroom remained in solitary magnificence, slept in by honoured, but non-royal guests. At Brympton d'Evercy these {{were more likely to be}} talented cricketers than esteemed potentates.|$|E
