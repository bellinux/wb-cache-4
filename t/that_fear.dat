5|$|On Oa, the Guardians tell Sinestro that Parallax was one {{of their}} own until he desired to control the yellow essence of fear, only to become corrupted. Arguing that the way to fight fear is with fear itself, Sinestro {{requests}} that the Guardians forge a ring of the same yellow power, preparing to concede Earth's destruction to Parallax in order to protect Oa. Jordan appears and tries to convince the Guardians <b>that</b> <b>fear</b> will turn the users evil if its power is used, but they reject his pleas, and he returns to Earth to try to defeat Parallax on his own.|$|E
5|$|During World War I, Mary Dennett focused {{her efforts}} on the peace movement, but she {{returned}} to the birth control movement in 1918. She continued to lead the NBCL, and collaborated with Sanger's NYWPC. In 1919, Dennett published a widely distributed educational pamphlet, The Sex Side of Life, which treated sex as a natural and enjoyable act. However, in the same year, frustrated with the NBCL's chronic lack of funding, Dennett broke away and formed the Voluntary Parenthood League (VPL). Both Dennett and Sanger proposed legislative changes that would legalize birth control, but they took different approaches: Sanger endorsed contraception but only under a physician's supervision; Dennett pushed for unrestricted access to contraception.Engelman, pp. 113–115. Sanger, a proponent of diaphragms, was concerned that unrestricted access would result in ill-fitting diaphragms and would lead to medical quackery.McCann (1994), pp. 71–72 gives examples that show Sanger's fears were justified. Dennett was concerned that requiring women to get prescriptions from physicians would prevent poor women from receiving contraception, and she was concerned about a shortage of physicians trained in birth control. Both legislative initiatives failed, partly because some legislators felt <b>that</b> <b>fear</b> of pregnancy {{was the only thing that}} kept women chaste. In the early 1920s, Sanger's leadership position in the movement solidified because she gave frequent public lectures, and because she took steps to exclude Dennett from meetings and events.|$|E

40|$|Forty {{years on}} from the initial idea <b>that</b> <b>fears</b> could be learnt {{vicariously}} through observing other people's responses to a situation or stimulus, this review looks at the evidence for this theory as an explanatory model of clinical fear. First, we review early experimental evidence <b>that</b> <b>fears</b> can be learnt vicariously before turning to the evidence from both primate and human research <b>that</b> clinical <b>fears</b> can be acquired in this way. Finally, we review recent evidence from research on non-anxious children. Throughout the review we highlight problems and areas for future research. We conclude by exploring the likely underlying mechanisms in the vicarious learning of fear and the resulting clinical implications...|$|R

25|$|The feminist {{historian}} Deborah Willis {{asserts that}} the witch-hunts resulted from a societal fear of maternal power.

25|$|Emotional {{blackmail}} and FOG, terms {{coined by}} psychotherapist Susan Forward, are about controlling people in relationships {{and the theory}} <b>that</b> <b>fear,</b> obligation and guilt ("FOG") are the transactional dynamics at play between the controller and the person being controlled.

25|$|Christian IV's {{position}} was somewhat strengthened by his military successes in 1628, but more so by Wallenstein's {{fear of a}} Danish-Swedish alliance. Bagging <b>that</b> <b>fear,</b> Christian IV personally met with Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden in February 1629, at Ulvsbäck. Gustavus Adolphus proposed a joint invasion of the empire, either from Stralsund or from Glückstadt, yet under the premise that overall command was with him, and that the invasion force would consist of more Swedish than Danish forces. Christian IV refused.|$|E

25|$|Psychologists such as John B. Watson, Robert Plutchik, and Paul Ekman have {{suggested}} {{that there is only}} a small set of basic or innate emotions and <b>that</b> <b>fear</b> is one of them. This hypothesized set includes such emotions as acute stress reaction, anger, angst, anxiety, fright, horror, joy, panic, and sadness. Fear is closely related to, but should be distinguished from, the emotion anxiety, which occurs as the result of threats that are perceived to be uncontrollable or unavoidable. The fear response serves survival by generating appropriate behavioral responses, so it has been preserved throughout evolution.|$|E

25|$|<b>That</b> <b>fear</b> became {{reality as}} Paul Dee, Athletic Director for the University of Miami, {{announced}} that the Hurricanes would be moving to Dolphin Stadium for the 2008 season. Dee and university president Donna Shalala made the announcement during a press conference at the Hecht Athletic Center on August 21, 2007. The University agreed to a 25-year contract to play at then Dolphin Stadium. According to Miami City Manager Pete Hernandez, this put the Orange Bowl back in the forefront as a possible site for a new Marlins stadium. The hope that talks would resume soon on that possibility vanished after only a short while.|$|E
25|$|Galen's humoral {{theories}} were {{influential in}} Europe in the Middle Ages for centuries afterward. In this theory, stuttering {{was attributed to}} imbalances of the four bodily humors—yellow bile, blood, black bile, and phlegm. Hieronymus Mercurialis, writing in the sixteenth century, proposed methods to redress the imbalance including changes in diet, reduced libido (in men only), and purging. Believing <b>that</b> <b>fear</b> aggravated stuttering, he suggested techniques to overcome this. Humoral manipulation {{continued to be a}} dominant treatment for stuttering until the eighteenth century. Partly due to a perceived lack of intelligence because of his stutter, the man who became the Roman emperor Claudius was initially shunned from the public eye and excluded from public office.|$|E
25|$|The {{only way}} to officially leave Jehovah's Witnesses is to {{disassociate}} or be disfellowshipped, and both entail {{the same set of}} prohibitions and penalties, with no provision for continued normal association. Sociologist Andrew Holden has claimed <b>that</b> <b>fear</b> of family break-up or loss causes people who might otherwise freely leave the group to remain members. Jehovah's Witnesses state that disfellowshipping is a scripturally documented method to protect the congregation from the influence of those who practice serious wrongdoing. Critics contend that the judicial process itself, due to its private and nearly autonomous nature, directly contradicts the precedent found in the Bible and the organization's own teachings and can be used in an arbitrary manner if there is consensus among just a few to abuse their authority.|$|E

40|$|Are {{concerns}} about labor market competition a powerful source of anti-immigrant sentiment? Several prominent {{studies have examined}} survey data on voters and concluded <b>that</b> <b>fears</b> about {{the negative effects of}} immigration on wages and employment play a major role generating anti-immigrant attitudes. We examine new data from a targeted survey of U. S. employees in 12 different industries. In contrast with previous studies, the findings indicate <b>that</b> <b>fears</b> about labor market competition do not appear to have substantial effects on attitudes toward immigration, and preferences with regard to immigration policy, among this large and diverse set of voters...|$|R

25|$|Before the Italian Grand Prix, Häkkinen {{announced}} that he would be on a sabbatical for the 2002 season, citing the reason {{to spend more time with}} his family. His seat was taken by fellow countryman Kimi Räikkönen in 2002. Häkkinen later stated <b>that</b> <b>fear</b> after crashes during practice for the 1995 Australian Grand Prix and the 2001 Australian Grand Prix as well as a loss of a desire to compete for race victories were factors. He was forced into another retirement during the race due to a gearbox issue. He managed to race to his final victory of his career in the United States despite incurring a grid penalty, and ended the season with a fourth-place finish in Japan. Häkkinen finished the season 5th in the Drivers' Championship, with 37 points.|$|E
25|$|Religions {{are filled}} with {{different}} fears that humans have had throughout many centuries. The fears aren't just metaphysical (including the problems of life and death) but are also moral. Death {{is seen as a}} boundary to another world. That world would always be different depending on how each individual lived their lives. The origins of this intangible fear are not found in the present world. In a sense we can assume <b>that</b> <b>fear</b> was a big influence on things such as morality. This assumption, however, {{flies in the face of}} concepts such as moral absolutism and moral universalism – which would hold that our morals are rooted in either the divine or natural laws of the universe, and would not be generated by any human feeling, thought or emotion.|$|E
25|$|Sexual {{abstinence}} is {{the practice}} of refraining from some or all aspects of sexual activity for medical, psychological, legal, social, financial, philosophical, moral or religious reasons. For the last twenty years, abstinence rates among American adolescents have risen. The percentage {{of high school students}} in the US who reported that they have ever had sexual intercourse dropped from 54.1% in 1991 to 47.8% in 2007 and to 43% in 2011. A cross-sectional survey in 1998 found <b>that</b> <b>fear</b> of pregnancy was the most commonly cited reason for choosing abstinence, especially among girls, as well as boys who had caused a pregnancy in the past. Other reasons included a fear of sexually transmitted infections, a lack of desire, being afraid of getting caught, and the belief that sex was not appropriate for someone of their age.|$|E
