5|$|A {{study of}} short-finned pilot whales off the {{southwest}} coast of Tenerife in the Canary Islands has found <b>the</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pod maintained contact {{with each other}} through call repertoires unique to their pod. A later study found, when foraging at around 800 m deep, short-finned pilot whales make tonal calls. The number and length of the calls seem to decrease with depth despite being farther away from conspecifics at the surface. As such, the surrounding water pressure affects the energy of the calls, but it does not appear to affect the frequency levels.|$|E
5|$|Cameroon's {{legal system}} is {{largely based on}} French civil law with common law influences. Although {{nominally}} independent, the judiciary falls {{under the authority of}} the executive's Ministry of Justice. The president appoints judges at all levels. The judiciary is officially divided into tribunals, the court of appeal, and the supreme court. The National Assembly elects <b>the</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> nine-member High Court of Justice that judges high-ranking members of government in the event they are charged with high treason or harming national security.|$|E
5|$|Each of <b>the</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> close {{binary system}} raises tides {{on the other}} through {{gravitational}} interaction. However the bulges can be slightly misaligned {{with respect to the}} direction of gravitational attraction. Thus the force of gravity produces a torque component on the bulge, resulting in the transfer of angular momentum (tidal acceleration). This causes the system to steadily evolve, although it can approach a stable equilibrium. The effect can be more complex in cases where the axis of rotation is not perpendicular to the orbital plane.|$|E
