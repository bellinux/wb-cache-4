For instance when it revealed that Charlie Chaplin was born on 16 April 1889, I wanted to say ‘that was only four days before the man he played (in all but name) in The Great Dictator (ie Adolf Hitler). The book’s packed with great info, from the derivation of the phrase ‘letting the cat out of the bag’ to the name for the thin bits of a cricket bail.

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by {{executive}} producer Matt Selman and directed by Nancy Kruse. It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on January 27, 2002. The episode's setpiece was pitched by Selman, and originated from a discussion he had with current showrunner Al Jean, about [...] "how much crap there is at the movie theater before the movie actually begins." [...] The episode's plot was also pitched by Selman, who had wanted to do an [...] episode with a [...] "jaws-wired-shut plot" [...] for a while. It was not until long after the episode was completed that Selman learned that one can in fact talk [...] with one's jaw wired shut. He learned this from fellow Simpsons writer Brian Kelley, who had had his jaw wired shut once in high school. Kelley joined the writing staff during the writing stage of the episode, however {{he did not mention}} that one could talk, since {{he did not want to}} [...] "ruin" [...] the episode. However, he did say that one should eat a lot before since one will lose weight when their jaw is wired shut. These <b>trivias</b> were subsequently included in the episode.|$|R
