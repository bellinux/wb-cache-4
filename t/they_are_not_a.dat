Under the Employment Equity Act, Aboriginal people are a designated group along with women, visible minorities, and persons with disabilities. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> visible minority under the Employment Equity Act and {{in the view of}} Statistics Canada.|$|E
5|$|Fishers {{have also}} been {{captured}} and bred by zoos, but <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> common zoo species. Fishers are poor animals to exhibit because, in general, they hide from visitors all day. Some zoos have had difficulty keeping fishers alive since they are susceptible to many diseases in captivity. Yet {{there is at least}} one example of a fisher kept in captivity that lived to be ten years old, and one case of a fisher living to be approximately 14 years old, well beyond its natural lifespan of 7 years.|$|E
5|$|Mona Lisa {{fulfilled}} 15th- {{and early}} 16th century requirements for portraying {{a woman of}} virtue. Lisa is portrayed as a faithful wife through gesture—her right hand rests over her left. Leonardo also presented Lisa as fashionable and successful, perhaps more well-off than she was. Her dark garments and black veil were Spanish-influenced high fashion; <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> depiction of mourning for her first daughter, as some scholars have proposed. The portrait is strikingly large; its size is {{equal to that of}} commissions acquired by wealthier art patrons of the time. This extravagance has been explained as a sign of Francesco and Lisa's social aspiration.|$|E

5|$|Jacqui's father William Alexander (Richard Graham) {{arrives in}} the village and asks for a kidney transplant. Jacqui refuses and before {{learning}} that Theresa is also her half sister. He leaves shamed when they discover the kidney is needed for his other daughter Emily Alexander (Elizabeth Henstridge). William returns for the trial and she opens up to him. At the trial, Gilly and Jacqui remember the same events very differently. The jury find Gilly not guilty. Rhys tells Jacqui that he believes her and they agree to get married. However realising she is not over her ordeal Jacqui goes to stay with her dad in Spain. Upon her return she agrees to donate a kidney to Emily. When <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> correct match, Emily tells her they were only interested in her kidney. Jacqui and Rhys marry but their relationship is problematic because Jacqui {{does not want to be}} intimate. Jacqui cannot readjust to life in the village. She gets a job working in The Dog. After more arguments Rhys suggests they spend time apart. Jacqui then goes missing, but is later found safe. She goes to see a counsellor and she and Rhys begin to rebuild their relationship.|$|E
5|$|The Pipe rolls are {{the records}} of the audits of the sheriffs' accounts, usually {{conducted}} at Michaelmas by the Exchequer, or English treasury. Until the chancery records began in the reign of King John of England, they were the only continuous set of records kept by the English government. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> complete record of government and royal finances, however, as they do not record all sources of income, only the accounts of the sheriffs and a few other sources of income. Some of the payments that did not regularly fall under the Exchequer were occasionally recorded in a Pipe roll. Neither do the Pipe rolls record all payments made by the exchequer. They were not created as a budget, nor were they strictly speaking records of receipts, but rather they are records of the audit of the accounts rendered. Although the rolls use an accounting system, it is not one that would be familiar to modern accountants; for instance {{until the end of the}} 12th century, no record was made of the total amount taken in by the sheriff of each shire. In their early form, they record all debts owed to the Crown, whether from feudal dues or from other sources. Because many debts to the king were allowed to be paid off in installments, it is necessary to search more than one set of rolls for a complete history of a debt. If a debt was not paid off completely in one year, the remainder of the amount owed was transferred to the next year. They did not record the full amount of debts incurred in previous years, only what was paid that year and what was still owed. Besides the sheriffs, others who submitted accounts for the audit included some bailiffs of various honours, town officials, and the custodians of ecclesiastical and feudal estates.|$|E

25|$|Traditionally, mopane worms were {{harvested}} for subsistence.

25|$|While fibroids are common, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> typical {{cause for}} infertility, {{accounting}} for about 3% {{of reasons why}} a woman {{may not be able}} to have a child. The majority of women with uterine fibroids will have normal pregnancy outcomes.|$|E

25|$|Many {{bird species}} feed on gypsy moth larvae, but <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> major {{food in the}} diet of any common bird species.

25|$|Landlocked salmon (Salmo salar m. sebago) live in {{a number}} of lakes in eastern North America and in Northern Europe, for {{instance}} in lakes Sebago, Onega, Ladoga, Saimaa, Vänern, and Winnipesaukee. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> different species from the Atlantic salmon, but have independently evolved a non-migratory life cycle, which they maintain even when they could access the ocean.|$|E
25|$|The Sayams are an {{indigenous}} tribe of southern Thailand, {{who make their}} home on the Malay Peninsula. Although they now speak a Mon–Khmer language, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> Mon–Khmer people, but are a remnant of a much earlier migration into the region. The Mani are the only Negrito people living in Thailand. This was proven when the Thai and Australian governments conducted DNA tests on them.|$|E

25|$|Dhole packs may attack sloth bears, though <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> usual prey item. When attacking them, dholes try {{to prevent}} the bear from {{retreating}} into caves. In one case, a golden jackal (a species much smaller and less powerful than a sloth bear and not generally a pack hunter as is the dhole) was seen to aggressively displace an adult bear which passively loped away from the snapping canid, indicating the sloth bear does not regard other carnivores as competition.|$|E
25|$|The {{only way}} of getting around obtaining the {{permission}} of the wife or of the wives is if she or if they are unsound, if they have died, if they have completely and finally renounced the world, and if they have ceased to be a Hindu. Men who are unmarried can adopt as well as long as <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> minor. However, if a man were to adopt a daughter, the man must be twenty one years of age or older.|$|E
25|$|The series largely {{concerns}} the surreal and awkward adventures of Tim and Daisy as they navigate through life, decide {{on what they}} want to do with their lives, come to terms with affairs of the heart, and try to figure out new and largely unproductive ways of killing time. Tim and Daisy repeatedly stress that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> couple to everyone but Marsha, but despite (or because of) this, romantic tension develops between them, particularly during the second series.|$|E

25|$|The {{band was}} formed in 1999 in Huntington Beach, California with {{original}} members M. Shadows, Zacky Vengeance, The Rev and Matt Wendt.

Upon its formation, each member of the band also took on a pseudonym which were already nicknames of theirs from high school. Matt Wendt was later replaced by Justin 'Sane' Meacham who was previously the bassist for Suburban Legends.|$|E
