5|$|The {{molecule}} ritonavir, {{marketed as}} Norvir, was {{developed as a}} protease inhibitor and used to target HIV infection. However, {{it has been shown}} to inhibit proteasomes as well as free proteases; <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>specific,</b> the chymotrypsin-like activity of the proteasome is inhibited by ritonavir, while the trypsin-like activity is somewhat enhanced. Studies in animal models suggest that ritonavir may have inhibitory effects on the growth of glioma cells.|$|E
5|$|Cells {{exposed to}} {{ionizing}} radiation, ultraviolet light or chemicals {{are prone to}} acquire multiple sites of bulky DNA lesions and double-strand breaks. Moreover, DNA damaging agents can damage other biomolecules such as proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and RNA. The accumulation of damage, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>specific,</b> double-strand breaks or adducts stalling the replication forks, are among known stimulation signals for a global response to DNA damage. The global response to damage is an act directed toward the cells' own preservation and triggers multiple pathways of macromolecular repair, lesion bypass, tolerance, or apoptosis. The common features of global response are induction of multiple genes, cell cycle arrest, and inhibition of cell division.|$|E

5|$|Many of {{the known}} species are little studied. Some 600 species (a quarter of the total) are known from a single record from a single host. Over 94% of species are {{associated}} with mammalian hosts, and only about 3% of species can be considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>specific</b> parasites of birds. The fleas on birds {{are thought to have}} originated from mammalian fleas; at least sixteen separate groups of fleas switched to avian hosts during the evolutionary history of the Siphonaptera. Occurrences of fleas on reptiles is accidental, and fleas have been known to feed on the hemolymph (bloodlike body fluid) of ticks.|$|E

These loops are referred to as the complementarity determining regions (CDRs).|$|E
5|$|N. J. Higham {{has argued}} that because {{the date of the}} {{original}} information is unknown and the largest Northumbrian kingdoms are not included in the Tribal Hidage, it cannot be proved to be a tribute list of Mercian origin. He notes that Elmet, which was never a province of Mercia, is included in the list. He suggests that the Tribal Hidage may have been a tribute list drawn up by Edwin of Northumbria in the 620s, and that it probably originated before 685, after which no Northumbrian king exercised imperium over the Southumbrian kingdoms. According to Higham, the values assigned to each people are likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>specific</b> to the events of 625-626, representing the individual contracts made between Edwin and those who recognised his overlordship at that time. This explains the artificial and rounded nature of the figures that were arrived at: the figure of 100,000 hides for the West Saxons was probably the largest number Edwin knew. However, D. P. Kirby notes that the Northumbrian origin theory has not been generally accepted as convincing.|$|E

5|$|<b>To</b> <b>be</b> <b>specific,</b> MS {{involves}} {{the loss of}} oligodendrocytes, the cells responsible for creating and maintaining a fatty layer—known as the myelin sheath—which helps the neurons carry electrical signals (action potentials). This results in a thinning or complete loss of myelin and, as the disease advances, {{the breakdown of the}} axons of neurons. When the myelin is lost, a neuron can no longer effectively conduct electrical signals. A repair process, called remyelination, takes place in early phases of the disease, but the oligodendrocytes are unable to completely rebuild the cell's myelin sheath. Repeated attacks lead to successively less effective remyelinations, until a scar-like plaque is built up around the damaged axons. These scars are the origin of the symptoms and during an attack magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) often shows more than ten new plaques. This could indicate {{that there are a number}} of lesions below which the brain is capable of repairing itself without producing noticeable consequences. Another process involved in the creation of lesions is an abnormal increase in the number of astrocytes due to the destruction of nearby neurons. A number of lesion patterns have been described.|$|E
