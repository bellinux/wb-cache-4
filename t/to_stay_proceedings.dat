40|$|This article {{examines}} Gina Rinehart’s numerous attempts to suppress information and <b>stay</b> <b>proceedings</b> in the extraordinary litigation in the Rinehart family trust dispute. The Rinehart litigation, while only at its pre-trial stage, has delivered significant judgments {{on the new}} legislative powers to depart from the principle of open justice and the law relating <b>to</b> <b>stays</b> of <b>proceedings</b> (<b>stays</b> of a substantive claim and stays pending {{an appeal to the}} High Court). The new legislation is the Court Suppression and Non-publication Orders Act 2010 (NSW), which has national significance as it is the model statute that aims to be implemented in all Australian jurisdictions and is a Federal Bill. The Rinehart litigation proves that the principle of open justice continues to be fundamental under the model statute and that the media has an important role in ensuring its protection. Possible future questions under the statute could be about the meaning of ‘suppression’ and the operational differences in seeking review under the Federal and NSW model. The Rinehart litigation is significant as it has redefined the test for seeking a stay of orders pending proceedings in the High Court. It has also considered whether a claim can be <b>stayed</b> due <b>to</b> an agreement to use alternative dispute resolution mechanisms. Further, it signals that future legal developments may occur on the issue of whether trustee disputes are arbitrable. 19 page(s...|$|R
