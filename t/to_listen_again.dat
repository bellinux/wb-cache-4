60|$|So James and Rollo {{turned away}} from the window, and began <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
60|$|Mr Pinch {{was just}} then looking thoughtfully at the bars. But on his {{companion}} pausing in this place, he started, and said 'Oh! of course'--and composed himself <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
60|$|Half-an-hour {{later the}} porter left the inn, Springrove {{at the same}} time going to the door <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>again</b> an instant, then he walked round and in {{at the back of the}} house.|$|E
50|$|Following {{transmission}} the edition is then {{available on}} the Manx Radio website <b>to</b> be <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>again</b> for the following seven days.|$|R
5000|$|Kayla Tinson of Top Country {{gave the}} album four stars out of five, writing {{that it is}} [...] "aptly named, packed full of fun-inducing party songs you’ll want <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>again</b> and again." ...|$|R
6000|$|So is pain cheered, death comforted; {{the house}} Of sorrow smiles <b>to</b> <b>listen.</b> Once <b>again</b> - O thou, Orpheus and Heracles, the bard And the deliverer, touch the stops again! ...|$|R
60|$|And now {{the youth}} rode onwards for a long, long time, over hill and dale, over rocky places and morasses, and then Dapplegrim began <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>again,</b> {{and asked the}} youth if he heard {{anything}} now.|$|E
60|$|She slept very soundly {{for more}} than two hours. She was a little frightened when she awoke, to find that she had been sleeping, and she started up and climbed along upon a rock which was near by, until she gained a {{projecting}} elevation, and here she began <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Cap'n!" [...] said he, and at {{the word}} Captain Cephas {{was sitting on the}} side of his bunk, listening. He knew from his companion's attitude, plainly visible in the light of a lantern which hung on a hook at the other end of the room, that he had been awakened <b>to</b> <b>listen.</b> <b>Again</b> came the cry.|$|E
50|$|The {{broadcast}} generally {{ends with}} Howard Caine reviewing {{certain aspects of}} that particular night's show whilst Slow Train Blues fades in the background. The edition is then available on the Manx Radio website <b>to</b> be <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>again</b> for the following seven days.|$|R
60|$|<b>To</b> wait, <b>listening</b> <b>again,</b> in the {{darkness}} of that unknown region, was more than I had courage for. The moment I was down on the floor, I pulled the lantern out of my pocket and raised the shade.|$|R
5000|$|... "The album {{itself is}} one which I know I'll be revisiting <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>again,</b> and I {{think that will}} apply {{to a lot of}} people. Distorted, heavy, melodic but {{throughout}} allowing you relate what you're hearing to your own experiences, this album {{is more than just a}} moment in music, it's a moment in life which everyone should experience." ...|$|R
60|$|Jean miscalculated {{and found}} he had come upon the {{embankment}} somewhat {{to the left of}} the end, which fact, however, caused him no uneasiness. He lay there awhile <b>to</b> <b>listen.</b> <b>Again</b> he heard voices. After a time a shot pealed out. He did not see the flash, but he calculated that it had come from the north side of the cabins.|$|E
6000|$|Straight off I was {{building}} that great future of Nicky's in my imagination, {{and had already}} made a renowned general of him and hofmeister at the court, when I noticed that Satan {{was waiting for me}} to get ready <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>again.</b> I was ashamed of having exposed my cheap imaginings to him, and was expecting some sarcasms, but it did not happen. He proceeded with his subject: ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'If {{you make}} believe very much, it's quite nice,' said the small servant, 'but if you don't, you know, {{it seems as}} if it would bear a little more seasoning, certainly. Well, {{sometimes}} I used to come out after they'd gone to bed, and sometimes before, you know; and one or two nights before there was all that precious noise in the office--when the young man was took, I mean--I come upstairs while Mr Brass and Miss Sally was a-sittin' at the office fire; and I tell you the truth, that I come <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>again,</b> about the key of the safe.' ...|$|E

50|$|The show {{generally}} {{ends with}} Williams reviewing {{some aspects of}} the show whilst Crunchy Granola Suite plays in the background. The edition is then available on the Manx Radio website <b>to</b> be <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>again</b> for the following seven days. From 2017 Carnaby Street is now also repeated {{in the early hours of}} Monday mornings as part of Manx Radio's overnight service.|$|R
60|$|So down I sat and scribbled, {{while my}} {{sovereign}} lady quietly stitched by my side. And here I tell my reader that I write {{on such a}} subject under protest,--declaring again my conviction that, if my wife only believed in herself as firmly as I do, she would write so that nobody would ever want <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> me <b>again.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "What sign {{does the}} Council require, Son of Panda?" [...] asked Zikali quietly. [...] "Let them {{agree on one}} {{together}} and tell me now at once, for I who am old grow weary and would sleep. Then {{if it can be}} given I will give it; and if I cannot give it, I will get me back to my own house and show my face no more at Ulundi, who do not desire <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>again</b> to fools who babble like contending waters round a stone and yet never stir the stone because they run two ways at once." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was quite}} by {{accident}} that Peter Rabbit first heard of Miser the Trade Rat. You {{know how it}} is with Peter; he is forever using those big ears of his to learn interesting things. That is what ears are for; but there is a right way and a wrong way to use them, and I am afraid that Peter isn't always over-particular in this respect. I suspect, in fact I know, that Peter sometimes listens when he has no business to listen and knows he has no business <b>to</b> <b>listen.</b> <b>Again</b> he sometimes overhears things quite by accident when he cannot very well help hearing. It was in this way that he first heard of Miser the Trade Rat.|$|E
60|$|While we {{were thus}} engaged we were startled by a distant, but most strange and horrible, cry. It {{seemed to come}} from the sea, but was so far away that we could not clearly {{distinguish}} its precise direction. Rushing out of our bower, we hastened down to the beach and stayed <b>to</b> <b>listen.</b> <b>Again</b> it came, quite loud and distinct on the night air--a prolonged, hideous cry, something like the braying of an ass. The moon had risen, and we could see the islands in and beyond the lagoon quite plainly; but there was no object visible to account for such a cry. A strong gust of wind was blowing from the point whence the sound came, but this died away while we were gazing out to sea.|$|E
5000|$|... "These songs {{here have}} been my best friends during the {{important}} years of my life. When I took my old, scratched long playing records <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> them <b>again,</b> I noticed how great they are. Still great. I began sing songs by myself and I discovered that I longed to sing in Swedish again." ...|$|R
60|$|Nigel {{observed}} that the hermit had raised himself on one elbow and seemed <b>to</b> be <b>again</b> <b>listening</b> intently.|$|R
50|$|In 2008, Pulse {{became the}} first British student radio station <b>to</b> offer a <b>listen</b> <b>again</b> service {{available}} through the stations website. Programmes from the past five days are stored online through the Pulse Player at Houghton Street Factual.|$|R
60|$|He was too {{indolent}} in {{the happy}} languor {{of the moment}} to answer the question. It darted through his brain and passed out, leaving him free <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>again</b> to the beating of her heart; to that precious and delicate sound which filled the quiet immensity of the night. Glancing upwards he saw the motionless head of the woman looking down at him in a tender gleam of liquid white between the long eyelashes, whose shadow rested on the soft curve of her cheek; and under the caress of that look, the uneasy wonder and the obscure fear of that apparition, crouching and creeping in turns towards the fire that was its guide, were lost--were drowned in the quietude of all his senses, as pain is drowned in the flood of drowsy serenity that follows upon a dose of opium.|$|E
6000|$|This fine bird {{has long}} been {{introduced}} into this country, and as it breeds freely it promises to become quite common. I can see it any day; but these exiles, pinioned and imprisoned in parks, are not quite like the Magellanic geese I was intimate with in former years, in Patagonia and in the southern pampas of Buenos Ayres, where they wintered every year in incredible numbers, and were called [...] "bustards" [...] by the natives. To see them again, as I have seen them, by day and all day long in their thousands, and <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>again</b> by night to their wild cries, I would willingly give up, in exchange, all the invitations to dine which I shall receive, all the novels I shall read, all the plays I shall witness, {{in the next three}} years; and some other miserable pleasures might be thrown in. Listening to the birds when, during migration, on a still frosty night, they flew low, following the course of some river, flock succeeding flock all night long; or heard from a herdsman's hut on the pampas, when thousands of the birds had encamped for the night on the plain hard by, the effect of their many voices (like that of their appearance when seen flying) was singular, as well as beautiful, on account of the striking contrasts in the various sounds they uttered. On clear frosty nights they are most loquacious, and their voices may be heard by the hour, rising and falling, now few, and now many taking part in the endless confabulation--a talkee-talkee and concert in one; a chatter as of many magpies; the solemn deep, honk-honk, the long, grave note changing to a shuddering sound; and, most wonderful, the fine silvery whistle of the male, steady or tremulous, now long and now short, modulated a hundred ways--wilder and more beautiful than the night-cry of the widgeon, brighter than the voice of any shore bird, or any warbler, thrush or wren, or the sound of any wind instrument.|$|E

5000|$|Considering {{the abuse}} we've had lately, I'm {{surprised}} that the new album has done so well. I suppose it's basically that audiences like the band... we took so much trouble over that album, possibly too much, but when we finished we felt really proud. Immediately it got really bad reviews so I took it home <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>again</b> and thought [...] "Christ, are they right?" [...] But after hearing it {{a few weeks later}} I still like it. I think it's great. We'll stick by it. —Roger Taylor on the critical reaction to Queen II.|$|R
5000|$|The album {{received}} {{praise from}} Get Your Rock Out writer Michael Dodd who particularly singled out the song 'Willow', calling it [...] "a grippingly addictive highlight". Summing up the record {{he wrote that}} [...] "With High Priestess the group can boast a true treasure, an album that is just too fun <b>to</b> not <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>again</b> and again; a real force of awesome metal {{and one of the}} most addictive releases of 2014".|$|R
5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Michael G. Nastos states [...] "Nothing {{on the album}} screams as a standout, but there's an even-keeled consonance that is very enjoyable, and lingers {{to the point where}} you want <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>again</b> and again. That {{enduring}} quality makes this recording special, and set the bar high for what Adderley would produce through a long and fruitful career as a jazz master. This album is the seed for that field of flowers". The Penguin Guide to Jazz gave the album a three star rating saying [...] "the confidence and bro is already in place and seemingly unstoppable".|$|E
5000|$|Chapman {{started writing}} songs {{when she was}} {{immediately}} signed to Elektra Records. Koppelman started finding producers for the album with the demo tape of her single [...] "Talkin' Bout a Revolution". However, she was turned down due to the more mainstream impact of dance-pop and synthpop at the time. They then found David Kershenbaum, who recalled later: [...] "I'd been looking for something acoustic to do for some time [...] [...] [...] There was a sense in the industry of a slight boredom with everything out there and that people might be willing <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>again</b> to lyrics and to someone who made statements." ...|$|E
5000|$|Maaya Sakamoto {{songs were}} simply moved by her {{writings}} started around year 1996 {{with the release}} of [...] "Yakusoku wa Iranai" [...] (I don't need a Promise), a simply lovely song sung by a lovely person, composed by Yoko Kanno and written by her. There are many more songs written in most of Maaya Sakamoto songs by her. Her writings are mostly nice <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>again</b> and again. Her writings strengthen more onto hope and a nice peaceful life. There is a few quotes, from her writings which images what she generally wanted to tell to all of her listeners. She also has published a book which that concerns interior designs in collaboration with her husband.|$|E
5000|$|Schuller's A Trio Setting, in [...] "the {{classical}} fast-slow-scherzo-fast form" [...] {{shows the}} influence of Bartók but is described as [...] "original...varied, affecting and exciting by turns, and inventive" [...] worth <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>again.</b>|$|R
5000|$|John France, {{writing for}} Musicweb International, like Liang & Passarella noted the works use of folk-like themes, but {{considered}} {{that while the}} work was [...] "...a wee bitty full of ‘clichés.’" [...] it was nevertheless something he would <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>again.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Your Kingdom is Glorious, Francois’ first album, {{received}} positive review from CatholicMom.com. “Francois is {{not just}} a singer - she is a very capable songwriter as well... Your Kingdom is Glorious is an album I will <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>again</b> and again.” ...|$|R
