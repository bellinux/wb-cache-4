5|$|With {{no time to}} make {{a coordinated}} plan of attack for the whole army, Khalid decided to storm the East Gate himself. He, Qa'qa ibn Amr, and Mazur ibn Adi climbed the wall hand-by-hand {{from the side of the}} gate. This part of the wall was the strongest, no guard was {{stationed}} at the top. They secured ropes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>and</b> dropped them to 100 selected soldiers waiting at the base. Leaving a few men to assist the climbers, Khalid descended into the city, killing the guards at the inside of the East Gate. Khalid and Qa'qa flung the gate open and the remainder of Khalid's men entered the city. An intense battle ensued.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} source mentioning {{this specific}} site {{as a place}} of worship is from the 16th century. The previous sites used by Jews for mourning the destruction of the Temple, during periods when access to the city was prohibited to them, lay to the east, on the Mount of Olives and in the Kidron Valley below it. From the mid-19th century onwards, attempts to purchase rights <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>and</b> its immediate area were made by various Jews, but none was successful. With the rise of the Zionist movement in the early 20th century, the wall became a source of friction between the Jewish and Muslim communities, the latter being worried that the wall could be used to further Jewish claims to the Temple Mount and thus Jerusalem. During this period outbreaks of violence {{at the foot of the}} wall became commonplace, with a particularly deadly riot in 1929 in which 133 Jews were killed and 339 injured. After the 1948 Arab-Israeli War the Eastern portion of Jerusalem was occupied by Jordan. Under Jordanian control Jews were completely expelled from the Old City including the Jewish quarter, and Jews were barred from entering the Old City for 19 years, effectively banning Jewish prayer at the site of the Western Wall. This period ended on June 10, 1967, when Israel gained control of the site following the Six-Day War. Three days after establishing control over the Western Wall site the Moroccan Quarter was bulldozed by Israeli authorities to create space for what is now the Western Wall plaza.|$|E

25|$|Shortly {{after the}} war, the U.S. Navy {{auctioned}} off hundreds of ships it had requisitioned {{for the war}} effort, flooding the market and seriously depressing prices. The resulting slump in the U.S. shipping industry sent many long-established American shipyards and marine engineers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> <b>and</b> New York {{was one of the}} worst affected locations, with its maritime industry all but wiped out by the slump.

25|$|The script {{laid out}} quite {{specifically}} how characters were {{to move and}} behave, but the actors themselves chose how to bring these directions to life. For example, when Alec Hardy tells Ellie Miller that her husband is the murderer, the script called for Hardy to come round to Miller's {{side of the table}} and for Miller to vomit after the revelation. David Tennant was allowed to improvise how he came round the table and whether he sat or stood. Olivia Colman improvised the portrayal of nausea by rising, crouching, turning <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> <b>and</b> vomiting. Director James Strong knew that this put stress on his technical crew, who often had to guess what technical adjustments had to be made (such as lighting or the placement of microphones) in order to accommodate this unusual style of direction and acting. But he felt this spontaneity freed the cast and permitted them to deliver far more intense performances. A heavy reliance was also placed on getting the first take right, as Strong believed the first take was more spontaneous and more natural. Subsequently, most of what the viewer sees in Broadchurch series one are first takes.|$|E
25|$|The Hellfire Club {{was then}} {{able to claim}} Jean {{as one of their}} members. By using the {{combined}} telepathic powers of both Emma and the Stepford Cuckoos, they mentally tricked Jean into doing what they wanted by using images of Scott and Professor X. But the mental contact was interrupted by Scott's unusually strong physic/telepathic connection to Jean. The Stepford Cuckoos then tried to release the Phoenix Force so they could be hosts, and seemingly succeeded. Emma was shocked when she learned the true purpose was for the Inner Circle to control the vastly limitless power and energy of the Phoenix when she originally thought that they were trying to release the Phoenix back into space to prevent the world from destruction. Jean and Cyclops then left to fight the Phoenix, but not before Jean angrily pinned Emma <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>and</b> telekinetically bound Emma with iron pipes after seeing Emma passionately kiss Cyclops (leading her to suspect that Emma may have plotted to steal Cyclops from her). Jean was unable to subdue the Phoenix herself, prompting Cyclops to attack the cosmic entity, only to be struck down as Jean watched in horror. Before the Phoenix could kill Cyclops, Emma, freed by Wolverine, arrived and took the Phoenix Force into herself, seemingly dying in the process by shattering into several diamond fragments. Jean has rejoined the X-Men and her memories have since returned and appeared to have reconciled with Cyclops.|$|E
25|$|Noah tracks Sylar and Elle {{down at the}} Canfield {{household}} and watches them have sex through the scope of a sniper rifle. Afterwards, he opens fire, misses, and then breaks {{into the house and}} shoots at them with a Company handgun, hitting Elle in the left thigh and forcing them into a retreat. While looking for them, Noah receives a call from Sandra in which she informs him that Claire is hospitalized. Instead of immediately rushing to the hospital, Noah follows a trail of Elle's blood to a local grocery store. After luring him into a back room, Sylar jumps him from behind, but he is once again outmatched without his powers against Noah's fighting skills. Ultimately, after tossing the ultimate insult ("Poor Gabriel. You always wanted to be special. Now look at you; you're nobody."), he slits Sylar's throat with a box cutter. When he returns home, Claire is understandably angered with him for focusing on Sylar rather than rushing to the hospital. When Claire reveals that she had died in the hospital, Noah realizes something awful: if Claire's powers are back, then so are Sylar's. Indeed, Sylar and Elle, newly empowered, have made it to the Bennet {{household and}} are holding Sandra and Lyle hostage. Sylar telekinetically disarms Noah, pins him <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> <b>and</b> begins to strangle him with his powers. Claire desperately swears to go with Sylar in exchange for leaving her family alone, but Sylar is unsatisfied with that and begins to cut into Noah's neck, clearly intent on decapitating him. Fortunately, Hiro Nakamura arrives, teleports Sylar and Elle away, and then time-travels with Claire back to the day when his father first assigned Noah to protect her.|$|E

At 2:40 Churchill left the scene, at about the time the Royal Horse Artillery arrived with two 13-pounder field artillery pieces. When the firemen entered the property to douse the flames, they soon located Sokoloff's body, which was extracted.
