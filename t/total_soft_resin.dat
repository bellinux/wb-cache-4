40|$|Graduation date: 1975 The genetic {{variability}} in and association between 14 traits that affect maturity, yield, and chemical properties of its product. The plant characters measured were: vigor, flowering date, harvest date, yield, lateral length, nodes per lateral, cones per lateral, cones per vine, cone weight. Alpha-acid and beta-acid {{content of the}} cone, alpha:beta-acid ratio, <b>total</b> <b>soft</b> <b>resin,</b> and lupulin content of the cone {{were included in the}} chemical evaluation. Genetic variance, genetic coefficient of variation, broad sense heritability and expected gain were calculated for each of the traits. The degree of association between traits was determined on the basis of phenotypic, genotypic and environmental correlations. The phenotypic correlations were further analyzed by path coefficient analysis to determine the interrelationships of the traits. Highly significant differences among genotypes were shown for all characters measured. The genetic coefficients of variation, broad sense heritability, and expected gains indicated there was a large genetic potential for improvement of most traits studied. Vigor, flowering date, and harvest date appear to have the least genetic potential for improvement. Application of a five percent selection pressure should result in a 90 percent gain in number of cones per vine and yield, and a 70 percent gain in lateral length and cones per lateral. All agronomic characteristics other than cone weight were positively correlated with yield. Also, all possible combinations of harvest date, lateral length, nodes per lateral, cones per lateral, cones per vine, and yield had significant positive phenotypic correlations. With the exception of vigor, phenotypic correlations between agronomic characters and the quality traits, alpha-acid and betaacid content of the cone, were either significant in a positive direction or showed no relationship. Correlations between alpha-acid and beta-acid concentration tend to support the concept that the two compounds are genetically independent after their common biosynthetic pathways diverge. Path coefficient analyses of phenotypic correlation coefficients showed that lateral length and cones per vine have more of a direct and indirect effect on yield than does vigor, flowering date, harvest date, nodes per lateral, or cone weight. The results reported in this study are important to the hop breeder whose objective is to improve yield and quality. The results indicate: 1. There is a large genetic potential for improving most traits studied. 2. Associations between and among agronomic and quality traits show that selection can be practiced on either group separately without having a negative effect on the other. 3. Lateral length and cones per vine have a strong influence on yield. Improvement of these two traits provides a means for increasing yeild in early maturing cultivars...|$|E

These systems are composed of <b>soft</b> <b>resins</b> and contain multiple fluid sacs with semi-permeable membranes. The semi-permeability allows for fluid transport that then leads to pressure generation. This combination of fluid transport and pressure generation then leads to shape and volume change. Another biologically inherent shape changing mechanism is that of hygroscopic shape change. In this mechanism, plant cells react to changes in humidity. When the surrounding atmosphere has a high humidity, the plant cells swell, but when the surrounding atmosphere has a low humidity, the plant cells shrink. This volume change has been observed in pollen grains and pine cone scales.|$|R

METHODS: A total of 250 schizophrenic patients and 90 normal controls were recruited. The Cambridge Neurological Inventory (CNI) {{was used to assess}} the prevalence of neurological signs. The CNI consists of seven subscales. Three soft signs subscales (motor coordination, sensory integration, disinhibition) and four hard signs subscales (extrapyramidal signs, dyskinesia, catatonia, pyramidal signs). RESULTS: The findings showed that patients exhibited significantly more signs than normal controls in all subscales but pyramidal signs (p < 0. 00005). Significant differences were also found in <b>total</b> <b>soft</b> signs, <b>total</b> hard signs as well as total neurological signs (p < 0. 0005). In view of sensitivity and specificity, the three subscales of soft signs showed a relatively better sensitivity and specificity as compared with the remaining hard signs. Improvement in sensitivity and specificity was demonstrated when the subscales were collapsed into <b>total</b> <b>soft</b> signs, <b>total</b> hard signs and total neurological signs. A cut-off of 4 in <b>total</b> <b>soft</b> signs yields a sensitivity of 0. 63 and specificity of 0. 71; whereas a cut-off of 1 in total hard signs yields a sensitivity of 0. 78 and specificity of 0. 89.

The method of hand polishing described here uses a newly developed glass plate with a grooved surface that greatly aids in achievement of a flat polished surface.|$|R

The CNI is comprised of 7 subscales, including motor coordination, sensory integration, disinhibition, extrapyramidal signs, dyskinesia, catatonia, and pyramidal signs. The former 3 subscales were classified as soft signs, whereas the latter 4 subscales were classified as hard signs.

Because of the perceived tendency of resins to discolor, technical manuals instructed commercial painters to make white and light-colored house paints using raw linseed oil and/or stand oil with very small quantities of resins, if any, whereas the addition of resins in large quantities was strongly recommended for darker colored enamel paints.

After finding the relevant Green functions for the ring and pin, the frictionless contact between them is then formulated in terms of an integral equation with a Fourier series as the kernel. This integral equation is solved by neglecting the terms of high orders and transforming it into the Cauchy singular integral equation.

The present paper extends that base model by taking into account two important features of CDMA. First, we capture the impact of soft blocking by modeling the neighbor cell interference as a lognormally distributed random variable. Secondly, we model {{the impact of the}} outage by taking into account that in-progress sessions can be dropped with a probability that depends on the current load in the system. We then consider a system with elastic and rigid service classes and analyze the trade-off between the <b>total</b> (<b>soft</b> and hard) blocking probabilities {{on the one hand and}} the throughput and the session drop probabilities on the other...|$|R
