5|$|Albion's main club badge {{dates back}} to the late 1880s, when club {{secretary}} Tom Smith suggested that a <b>throstle</b> (song thrush) sitting on a crossbar be adopted for the badge. Since then, the club badge has always featured a <b>throstle,</b> usually on a blue and white striped shield, although the crossbar was replaced with a hawthorn branch at some point after the club's move to the Hawthorns. The <b>throstle</b> was chosen because the public house in which the team used to change kept a pet thrush in a cage. It also gave rise to Albion's early nickname, the Throstles. As late as the 1930s, a caged <b>throstle</b> was placed beside the touchline during matches and it was said that it only used to sing if Albion were winning. In 1979, an effigy of a <b>throstle</b> was erected above the half-time scoreboard of the Woodman corner at the Hawthorns, and was returned to the same area of the ground following redevelopment in the early 2000s.|$|E

5|$|Ladas {{was sent}} to Doncaster for the St Leger on 12 September {{in an attempt to}} win the Triple Crown. Ridden by Tommy Loates, Ladas started at odds of 10/11 (0.9/1) in a field of eight, with Matchbox (ridden by Watts) the second choice on 2/1 and the filly <b>Throstle</b> ignored on 50/1. As usual, Ladas was held up {{at the back of the}} field as, at first <b>Throstle,</b> then a horse named Legal Tender, then Matchbox made the running. Ladas moved {{steadily}} closer and turned into the straight in second, before overtaking Matchbox and going into a clear lead. In the final furlong, however, he was challenged by <b>Throstle,</b> and in the closing stages the latter pulled ahead to win by three quarters of a length. According to The Sportsman, the cheers of the crowd were replaced by those of the bookmakers as the outsider overhauled the favourite.|$|E

5|$|Albion's first regular shirt badge {{appeared}} in the late 1960s and early 1970s where it was blue. Although it featured the <b>throstle,</b> it {{did not include the}} blue and white striped shield of the club badge. A similar design was also used during the late 1980s and early 1990s. In the mid-1970s, a more abstract version of the <b>throstle</b> was used on the club's shirts, while in the late 1970s through to the mid-1980s, an embroidered WBA logo was displayed, a common abbreviation of the club's name in print. Not until the early 21st century did the full club badge appear on the team's shirts.|$|E
5|$|Trafford Park {{contained}} the hall, its grounds, and three farms: Park Farm, Moss Farm, and Waters Meeting Farm. From the original three entrance lodges to the park, at <b>Throstle</b> Nest, Barton-upon-Irwell and Old Trafford, only {{the latter has}} survived, having been relocated from its original position opposite what is today the White City retail park to become the entrance to Gorse Hill Park.|$|E
25|$|In {{conjunction}} with the jury of 24 sitting at the Barmote Courts, the deputy barmasters adjudicated in disputes and enforced compliance with the customs of the mines. Their duties extended to acting as the coroner {{in the case of}} fatal accidents, where a specially summoned jury of twelve or thirteen local miners decided the cause of death. In an 18th-century example the Brassington barmaster, Edward Ashton, followed the rules after a death in <b>Throstle</b> Nest mine.|$|E

25|$|The <b>throstle</b> and {{the later}} water frame pulled the rovings through {{a set of}} {{attenuating}} rollers. Spinning at differing speeds, these pulled the thread continuously while other parts twisted it as it wound onto the heavy spindles. This produced thread suitable for warp, but the multiple rollers required much more energy input and demanded that the device be driven by a water wheel. The early water frame, however, had only a single spindle. Combining ideas from these two system inspired the spinning mule.|$|E
25|$|Miss Jummy was a bay filly {{with a white}} star bred by her owner the 12th Duke of Hamilton. She was sired by Petrarch, a horse {{which won}} the 2000 Guineas and the St Leger Stakes in 1876. At stud Petrarch was {{particularly}} successful as a sire of fillies: his other daughters included Busybody (1000 Guineas and Oaks) and <b>Throstle</b> (St Leger). Her dam, Lady Portland, was not a successful racehorse but was descended from Alice Hawthorn, who won fifty-two races and became an influential broodmare.|$|E
25|$|Petrarch {{spent his}} early stud {{career at the}} Hampton Court Stud and was later moved to the Lanwades Stud. He sired three classic winning filies: Busybody and Miss Jummy both won the 1000 Guineas and Oaks, whilst <b>Throstle</b> ended the Triple Crown bid of Ladas by winning the 1894 St Leger. The best of his colts was The Bard who won sixteen races as a two-year-old {{and went on to}} finish second in the 1886 Epsom Derby. In 1893, Petrarch was sold and {{exported}} to France, where he died a few years later.|$|E

25|$|The {{spinning}} mule spins {{textile fibres}} into yarn by an intermittent process. In the draw stroke, the roving is pulled through rollers and twisted; {{on the return}} it is wrapped onto the spindle. Its rival, the <b>throstle</b> frame or ring frame uses a continuous process, where the roving is drawn, twisted and wrapped in one action. The mule {{was the most common}} spinning machine from 1790 until about 1900 and was still used for fine yarns until the early 1980s. In 1890, a typical cotton mill would have over 60 mules, each with 1,320 spindles, which would operate four times a minute for 56 hours a week.|$|E

500|$|The {{song thrush}} was {{described}} by German ornithologist Christian Ludwig Brehm in 1831, and still bears its original scientific name, Turdus philomelos. The generic name, Turdus, is the Latin for thrush, and the specific epithet refers to a character in Greek mythology, Philomela, who had her tongue cut out, but was changed into a singing bird. Her name {{is derived from the}} Ancient Greek Φιλο philo- (loving), and μέλος melos (song). The dialect names <b>throstle</b> and mavis both mean thrush, being related to the German drossel and French mauvis respectively. <b>Throstle</b> dates back to at least the fourteenth century and was used by Chaucer in the Parliament of Fowls. Mavis is derived via Middle English mavys and Old French mauvis from Middle Breton milhuyt meaning [...] "thrush." [...] Mavis (Μαβής) can also mean [...] "purple" [...] in Greek.|$|E

500|$|In the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown on 20 July, Ladas met Isinglass again, {{this time}} over ten furlongs on soft ground. Isinglass started {{favourite}} at 4/5 (0.8/1) with Ladas on 13/8 (1.6/1) {{and the other}} runners, who included Raeburn, Ravensbury and a filly named <b>Throstle</b> virtually ignored. The outsider Priestholme set off at an unsustainably fast pace, followed by Isinglass, with Watts restraining Ladas towards the rear. Priestholme dropped away in the straight, leaving Isinglass in the lead with Watts moving Ladas up to challenge. The two Derby winners dominated the race in the closing stages {{but in spite of}} a [...] "game pursuit", Ladas was unable to overhaul Isinglass, who won by a length {{with the rest of the}} field, headed by <b>Throstle,</b> well beaten. There were no excuses for Ladas: Watts admitted that he had been beaten by a better horse.|$|E

500|$|The main club badge {{should be}} {{distinguished}} from the badge displayed on the first team strip, as the two have rarely coincided. No badge appeared on the kit {{for most of the}} club's history, although the Stafford knot featured on the team jerseys for part of the 1880s. The West Bromwich town arms were worn on the players' shirts for the 1931, 1935 and 1954 FA Cup finals. The town's Latin motto, [...] "Labor omnia vincit," [...] translates as [...] "labour conquers all things" [...] or [...] "work conquers all".

500|$|The early Renaissance poem [...] "The Harmony of Birds" [...] had the thrusshe (mistle thrush) sing [...] "sanctus, sanctus", and {{distinguished}} {{it from the}} song thrush, the mauys or <b>throstle.</b> The song is also described in Thomas Hardy's [...] "Darkling Thrush" [...] and Edward Thomas's [...] "The Thrush". The loud call of this common and conspicuous bird also led to many old or local names, including [...] "screech", [...] "shrite" [...] and [...] "gawthrush". Other names, including [...] "stormcock" [...] referred to its willingness to sing in wind and rain. [...] "Holm thrush", [...] "hollin cock" [...] and [...] "holm cock" [...] are based on obsolete names for the holly tree, which may be defended by the thrush in winter for its berries.|$|E
500|$|Although {{known in}} their early days as [...] "the Throstles", the club's more popular {{nickname}} among supporters came to be the Baggies, a term which the club itself looked down upon for many years but later embraced. The phrase was first heard at the Hawthorns in the 1900s, but its exact origins are uncertain. One suggestion is that the name was bestowed on Albion supporters by their rivals at Aston Villa, {{because of the large}} baggy trousers that many Albion fans wore at work to protect themselves from molten iron in the factories and foundries of the Black Country. Club historian Tony Matthews however suggests that it derives from the [...] "bagmen", who carried the club's matchday takings in big leather bags from the turnstiles to the cash office on the halfway line. Other theories relate to the baggy shorts worn by various players during the club's early years. The official club mascots are named Baggie Bird and Albi; both are based on the <b>throstle</b> depicted on the club crest.|$|E
500|$|The first {{documented}} {{reference to}} industry in Radcliffe is after 1680, in the Radcliffe parish registers, which make increasing mention of occupations such as woollen webster (weaving), linen webster, and whitster (bleacher). These were cottage industries which worked alongside local agriculture. In 1780 Robert Peel {{built the first}} factory in the town, several hundred yards upstream from Radcliffe Bridge (at the end of Peel Street). With a weir and goit providing motive power for a water wheel, the factory was built for <b>throstle</b> spinning and the weaving of cotton—a relatively new introduction to Britain. The water wheel proved to be insufficient, and so around 1804 the goit was extended. [...] The weir (known as Rectory Weir) was made from timber. [...] Conditions were poor; the mill employed child labour bought from workhouses in Birmingham and London. Children were boarded on an upper floor of the building, and bound {{until they reached the}} age of 21. [...] They were unpaid, and were kept locked up each night. Shifts were typically 10–10.5hours in length, and children returning from a day shift would sleep in the same bed as children leaving for a night shift. Peel himself admitted that conditions at the mill were [...] "very bad". [...] In 1784 an outbreak of typhoid prompted Lord Grey de Wilton to inform the magistrates of the Salford Hundred; keen {{to prevent the spread of}} the disease to neighbouring towns and villages, they sent doctors to assess the situation. Their recommendations included leaving the windows of the mill open at night, fumigation of rooms with tobacco (as this was thought to discourage disease), regular cleaning of rooms and toilets and occasional bathing of children. [...] The report forced the magistrates, led by Thomas Butterworth Bayley, to abandon the practice of binding parish apprentices to any mill not adhering to these conditions. The report also prompted Peel to introduce an Act of Parliament to improve factory hygiene, which later became the Factory Act of 1802. [...] Over time, conditions at the mill improved; in the mid-1790s the physician John Aikin, a critic of the factory system, praised working conditions at the mill, and in 1823 inspections by local magistrates of conditions in mills across the county revealed that unlike many others, the factory at Radcliffe was adhering to all requirements of the Factory Acts.|$|E
