25|$|Mullayanagiri: Mullayanagiri {{is part of}} the Baba Budan Giri Hill Ranges here. It stands 1930 meters {{tall and}} is the tallest peak in Karnataka. Its height is famous mostly for {{watching}} sunsets from. It is 16km from Chikmagalur town. Driving to Mullayanagiri is worth taking a risk. On the way is Sitalayanagiri where the water in the Shiva temple neither increases nor decreases. The road to Mullayanagiri is very narrow with a views from steep cliffs. Driving to the peak is not possible and includes a trek up the hill from the halfway point. There is a temple on top of the hill. From the topmost point of the hill the Arabian Sea is visible on clear days. The small hillock in the temple compound is the highest point in Karnataka. The narrow road to the temple makes <b>two</b> <b>way</b> <b>traffic</b> impossible. It is a great trekking spot in Karnataka.|$|E

Siim Kallas stated that the project, which would be put into action over a few a long period rather than all at once, would create a [...] "symbolic area for the EU institutions" [...] giving [...] "body and soul to the European political project" [...] and providing the Commission with extra office space. The road would be reduced from four lanes to two, and be returned to <b>two</b> <b>way</b> <b>traffic</b> (rather than all west-bound) and the architects proposed a tram line to run down the centre. A series of high rise buildings would be built on either side with three taller 'flagship' high rises at the east end on the north side. Charles Picqué described the towers as [...] "iconic buildings that {{will be among the}} highest in Brussels" [...] and that [...] "building higher allows you to turn closed blocks into open spaces." [...] The tallest buildings will be up to 80 metres high, though most between 16 and 55, but the higher the building the further back it will be set from the road. The freed up space (some 180,000m²) would be given over to housing, shops, services and open spaces to give the area a more [...] "human" [...] feel. A sixth European School may also be built.

40|$|As the Nile River and its {{branched}} streams were formally assigned {{for irrigation}} and water supply, {{development of the}} waterway transport system becomes necessary. Improvements of the inland navigation system in Egypt to fulfill the required safety measures are being considered. Inland navigation is the safest, cheapest, tourist attractions and the most environment friendly means. The present study is carried out to illustrate the methodologies for designing the navigable channel dimensions for the first class navigation waterways in Egypt. The available data of the numbers, dimensions, status and types of ships used in different stretches are utilized to determine the representative ship dimensions such as draught, beam, and length relative to each type of inland waterway are assigned. The design ship dimensions are utilized to illustrate the suitable waterway width for the different first class navigation waterway in Egypt. Four design methodologies for the navigation channels are presented which produce suitable guidelines to be applied for the first class inland waterways in Egypt. The first two approaches were empirically developed to determine waterway width in each of one and <b>two</b> <b>way</b> <b>traffics</b> of straight channels. While the other two methods, are commonly used and applied for straight and curved waterways. These approaches were applied on the Nile River, Damietta branch, Rayah El-Behery and El-Nubaria Canal.

50|$|In the pre-automotive era of cities, {{traces of}} the concept of a {{hierarchy}} of streets in a network appear in Greek and subsequent Roman town plans. The main feature of their classification is their size. In Roman cities, such as Pompeii, major thoroughfares (e.g. the decumanus) had a width of 12.2 m, secondary streets (e.g. the cardo) 6 m and tertiary streets (e.g. vicinae) measured 4.5 meters. The first allowed for <b>two</b> <b>way</b> cart <b>traffic,</b> the second generally only one, while the third only loaded animals. Narrower streets that could only accommodate pedestrians were also present in both Greek and Roman cities. Thus the restriction on connections between major streets on particular modes (carts and chariots) was the effect of the width of the street itself and not the lack of linkage. This method is akin to the contemporary concept of filtered permeability.|$|R

40|$|International audienceEnergy {{efficiency}} in cellular networks {{is a major}} issue for current and future mobile networks. Several approaches have been proposed for this purpose: the component approach, the radio resource management (RRM) algorithms, the cell topology adaptation mechanisms, the hybrid network architectures, the cognitive radio approach and others. However, it is rare to find proposals where {{two or more of}} these approaches are combined in order to obtain a better energy efficiency. In this paper we combine the cell breathing technique, a cell topology adaptation mechanism, with a hybrid network approach composed of small and large cell layers. Our scenario includes the possibility of users being blocked by the femto-layer due to Closed-Subscriber Groups (CSG) access policies, a concept defined in 3 GPP standards but not very discussed so far in the literature. By adding the cell breathing to the macro layer, we have <b>two</b> <b>ways</b> of <b>traffic</b> redistribution in order to offload and deactivate a larger number of Macro-BSs achieving to take the most of benefits from the hybrid cellular infrastructure. The described proposal is compared with other related mechanisms found in the literature. Our results lead to interesting conclusions for shortterm practical implementations...|$|R

5000|$|Originally planned {{during the}} Canal Age {{at the behest}} of Philadelphia city fathers to compete with the Erie Canal trade with near-west {{settlements}} in the Northwest Territories and expected to be a canal in the late 1820s conception as the easternmost leg of the Pennsylvania Canal System, the branch was to be a continuation of the first funded river improvements and harder-to-construct engineering challenges farther west in less populated rural regions. The canal joining the Delaware and Susquehanna rivers in the initial planning was to run across the most populated expanse of Pennsylvania's Great Valley region (and so was delayed politically in part by local land concerns and the due-process needs of eminent domain). As a canal section, its planning was overtaken by the growth of railroad technology, which by the mid-1830s had demonstrated sufficient promise to adopt the new technology for the easternmost leg of the overall planned transportation system. Despite the relatively untried and unproven nature of the railroad technologies with the example of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad project in direct competition - legal capabilities, funding and construction was shifted to a railroad - it was expected to be far faster and cheaper to build above ground and make bridges than it was to dig a deep ditch and provide it with reliable water supplies to enable <b>two</b> <b>way</b> barge <b>traffic.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The main {{ridge of}} the Alps lays just crosses Austria. Therefore {{it is not}} {{surprising}} that most highways in Austria do have to pass through a lot of road tunnels. Among these tunnels, some of the world longest tunnels for vehicle traffic are found. For safety reasons today all long road tunnels are planed with two tubes. Two tubes allow one <b>way</b> <b>traffic</b> in each tube. In the case of one <b>way</b> <b>traffic</b> it is easier to deal with the dense smoke which can be produced by heavy fires. However due do the very high cost in many cases only one tube was finished first and therefore the tunnel has to be operated with two-way traffic. After some years the second tube was opened and the traffic was changed to one-way traffic. The layout of the ventilation system must be a way, so that both cases-one <b>way</b> <b>traffic</b> and <b>two</b> <b>way</b> traffic- can be handled in normal operation and in fire situations. The authors developed system to model the ventilation system in normal operation and in fire situations. The model is used for two different situations. On the one hand the necessary regulations for the ventilation system under normal conditions are calculated, on the other and simulations can be done to foresee the influence of many changes of traffic conditions or changes in the ventilation system. For many cases the velocities in all ducts of the tunnel and the pressure distribution can be calculated...|$|R

40|$|The {{transplantation}} {{of multiple}} abdominal viscera, including liver-duodenum-pancreas, liver-stomach-duodenum-pancreas and liver-intestine, is being performed {{with increasing frequency}} and success. These procedures and other variations are derived from a seldom used multivisceral operation in which all of the foregoing organs are transplanted en bloc. It is described herein how the full multivisceral transplantation and its less extensive derivatives {{are based on the}} same principles of procurement, preservation and postoperative management. With all of these multiple organ permutations and with intestinal transplantation alone, management is complicated by inclusion in the grafts of a large lymphoreticular component that is capable of causing graft versus host disease (GVHD). Because of a systematic error in therapeutic philosophy, past efforts have been directed at altering or damaging the lymphoreticular cells by pretreatment of the donor or of the organs with drugs, irradiation or other means. From recent observations, the alternative approach is suggested of keeping these lymphoid depots intact, which then become the site of <b>two</b> <b>way</b> cell <b>traffic</b> after transplantation. With the use of powerful immunosuppression, such as that provided with FK 506, the donor lymphoreticular cells can circulate in the recipient without causing clinical GVHD, and the lymphoreticular cells in the graft become those of the recipient (local chimerism) without causing rejection. Even with avoidance of rejection and GVHD, metabolic interrelations between the grafted organs, and also between the graft organs and retained recipient viscera can affect the fate of the individual transplanted organs or retained recipient organs. The best delineated of these metabolic influences are mediated by the endogenous splanchnic hepatotrophic factors, of which insulin has been the most completely studied. An understanding of these various immunologic and nonimmunologic factors combined with more potent immunosuppression that is now available is sure to stimulate efforts at transplantation of abdominal organs and particularly of the hollow viscera that have resisted such clinical efforts...|$|R
