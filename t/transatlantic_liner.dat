25|$|Until World War II, {{the port}} at Millbay Docks {{was used for}} <b>Transatlantic</b> <b>liner</b> shipping, {{as it had been}} since the 1870s. Many of the {{surviving}} crew of the RMS Titanic disaster disembarked at Millbay docks on their return to England in 1912.|$|E
25|$|The Swedish American Line was {{amongst the}} first {{companies}} to build liners with provisions for off-season cruising, {{as well as}} the first company to build a diesel-engined <b>transatlantic</b> <b>liner.</b> Increased operational costs and stronger competition from aeroplanes forced the company to abandon passenger traffic in 1975, but cargo operations continued until the 1980s.|$|E
25|$|She plied as a <b>transatlantic</b> <b>liner</b> between Marseille and New York {{from then}} until 1920, {{when she and}} Providence were reassigned to {{carrying}} emigrants to New York from Naples, Palermo and Marseille. After the Wall Street Crash of 1929 Messageries Maritimes withdrew Patria from the emigrant trade in 1930, although Providence continued to carry emigrants until 1932.|$|E

25|$|The brand-new Shalom begun {{her career}} {{with a series}} of short cruises out of Haifa, before embarking on her fully booked first {{crossing}} to New York on 17 April 1964. However, by the time she entered service the <b>transatlantic</b> <b>liner</b> trade was already in decline, with more passenger crossing the Atlantic by air than by sea since 1959. To make her better suited for cruise service, Shalom was rebuilt in the Netherlands in October 1964, increasing the number of first-class cabins.|$|E
25|$|The Sylvania {{started on}} her maiden voyage from Greenock to Montreal on 5 June 1957. On 26 June 1957 she joined her sisters on their {{northern}} hemisphere summer service from Liverpool to Montreal via Greenock and Québec. By {{the time she}} entered service the growth of passenger numbers in <b>transatlantic</b> <b>liner</b> service had ceased, while the amount of passenger transported by the jet airplane was growing. In 1958 the Saxonia made one crossing from Liverpool to New York via Cobh and Halifax. In April 1961 she was moved permanently to the Liverpool—New York service, replacing the RMS Britannic. At some point during her career with Cunard, the Sylvania also served on the Rotterdam—Southampton—Le Havre—Québec—Montreal -route and winter crossings between Liverpool and Halifax via Greenock.|$|E

During the 1930s he worked as an entertainer on board <b>transatlantic</b> <b>liners</b> on the routes between Europe and North America, which gave {{him the opportunity to}} get to know American music genres, especially jazz and swing.|$|R
25|$|Designer Marin-Marie gave an {{innovative}} line to Normandie, a silhouette which influenced ocean liners over the decades, including Queen Mary 2. The ambience of classic <b>transatlantic</b> <b>liners</b> like Normandie (and her chief rival, Queen Mary) {{was the source}} of inspiration for Disney Cruise Line's matching vessels, Disney Magic, Disney Wonder, Disney Dream, and Disney Fantasy.|$|R
50|$|Stonehouse is {{the site}} of Plymouth's {{international}} ferry port at Millbay with at least daily sailings to Roscoff in Brittany (except in winter) and frequent ferries to Santander in northern Spain. Until the 1950s, <b>transatlantic</b> <b>liners</b> would disembark passengers who wished to catch a fast train to London rather than spend another day on board going up the Channel.|$|R
2500|$|With the {{contribution}} made by this splendid vessel, the CGT ended the year 1928 with record earnings. For {{the first time}} the company's receipts exceeded a billion francs, and half of this derived from the New York service, which had transported more than 90,000 passengers. [...] Its popularity was such that by 1935, the ship had carried more first-class passengers than any other <b>transatlantic</b> <b>liner.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The Queen Elizabeth 2, often {{referred}} to simply as QE2, is a retired ocean liner built for the Cunard Line which was operated by Cunard as both a <b>transatlantic</b> <b>liner</b> and a cruise ship from 1969 to 2008. She was designed for the transatlantic service from her home port of Southampton, UK, to New York, and was named after the earlier Cunard liner [...] She served as the flagship of the line from 1969 until succeeded by [...] in 2004. Designed in Cunard's then headquarters and regional offices in Liverpool and Southampton respectively, and built in Clydebank, Scotland, QE2 was considered {{the last of the}} great transatlantic ocean liners until Queen Mary 2 entered service.|$|E
2500|$|In her {{original}} Swedish American Line livery the Kungsholms hull and superstructure were painted all-white, with funnels and masts painted yellow, and SAL's blue three crowns logo painted on both funnels. [...] In North German Lloyd service she received the traditional black hull of a <b>transatlantic</b> <b>liner,</b> with the funnels and cargo cranes {{in front of}} the ship painted orange. Following the merger into Hapag-Lloyd, her hull was repainted white with orange and blue decorative ribands, and the blue Hapag-Lloyd logo was added to her funnels. In Costa Cruises service the two ribands on the hull were replaced with a thinner black one, while the funnels were painted yellow with a blue top and the large blue [...] "C" [...] logo of Costa painted on both of them.|$|E
60|$|Carley relaxed. She drew a {{deep breath}} of relief. She had her first faint intimation that perhaps her {{extensive}} experience of motor cars, express trains, <b>transatlantic</b> <b>liners,</b> and even a little of airplanes, did not range over the whole of adventurous life. She was likely to meet something, entirely new and striking out here in the West.|$|R
25|$|Following the war, Queen Mary was {{refitted}} {{for passenger}} service {{and along with}} Queen Elizabeth commenced the two-ship transatlantic passenger service for which the two ships were initially built. The two ships dominated the transatlantic passenger transportation market until {{the dawn of the}} jet age in the late 1950s. By the mid-1960s, Queen Mary was ageing and, though still among the most popular <b>transatlantic</b> <b>liners,</b> was operating at a loss.|$|R
5000|$|During the 1920s, Lillet exports greatly {{increased}} in Europe and Africa. Besides, the brand became famous in France, especially thanks to advertising campaigns. At the same time, [...] "Lillet" [...] was served on <b>transatlantic</b> <b>liners,</b> {{part of the}} reason of its success with the high society in New York. Indeed, [...] "Lillet" [...] conquered New York high society and American bartenders, who used it for crafting fashionable cocktails.|$|R
2500|$|SS Patria was an [...] French {{ocean liner}} built in 1913 for Compagnie française de Navigation à vapeur Cyprien Fabre & Cie (Fabre Line), for {{whom she was}} first a <b>transatlantic</b> <b>liner</b> and then an {{emigrant}} ship. From 1932 Fabre Line leased her to Services Contractuels des Messageries Maritimes, who ran her between the south of France and the Levant. After the fall of France in June 1940 the British authorities in Mandatory Palestine seized her in the Port of Haifa and placed her under {{the management of the}} British-India Steam Navigation Company. In November 1940 the Zionist movement planted a bomb aboard which sank her with the loss of between 260 and 300 lives. Patria remained a wreck in Haifa port until she was scrapped in 1952.|$|E
2500|$|Before World War II, {{aircraft}} had {{not been}} a significant threat to ocean liners. Most pre-war aircraft were noisy, vulnerable to bad weather, few had the range needed for transoceanic flights, and all were expensive and had a small passenger capacity. The war accelerated development of large, long-ranged aircraft. Four-engined bombers, such as the Avro Lancaster and Boeing B-29 Superfortress, with their range and massive carrying capacity, were natural prototypes for post-war next-generation airliners. Jet engine technology also accelerated due to wartime development of jet aircraft. In 1953, the De Havilland Comet became the first commercial jet airliner; the Sud Aviation Caravelle, Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8 followed, and much long-distance travel was done by air. The Italian Line's [...] and , launched in 1962 and 1963, were two of the last ocean liners to be built primarily for liner service across the North Atlantic. Cunard's <b>transatlantic</b> <b>liner,</b> Queen Elizabeth 2, was also used as a cruise ship. By the early 1960s, 95% of passenger traffic across the Atlantic was by aircraft. Thus the reign of the ocean liners came to an end. By the early 1970s, many passenger ships continued their service in cruising.|$|E
2500|$|During the 1960s {{competition}} from other passenger liners - and from the jet aeroplane - increased on the Australian run, putting financial pressure on Shaw Savill's around the year service to Australia and New Zealand. In a surprising move, parent company Furness Withy transferred three [...] former Royal Mail Lines cargo/passenger ships to Shaw Savill in 1968/69, each with capacity for 464 passengers. In early 1970, Shaw Savill also acquired the Canadian Pacific Steamship Company's <b>transatlantic</b> <b>liner</b> RMS Empress of England. As SS Ocean Monarch, this unaltered ship promptly sailed for Australasia, to undertake two long cruises ex-Australia to Japan, timed to coincide with Expo'70. [...] Upon her return to Britain, Ocean Monarch commenced a major refit to make her more suitable for full-time cruising. [...] The now redundant cargo holds and associated handling gear were removed and the after part of the ship remodelled. This work enabling new public spaces and cabins to be built, which would increase passenger capacity to 1,372. Due to extended dockyard delays, Ocean Monarch was unable to resume service until October 1971. In the space of three years, Shaw Savill's passenger fleet had increased from two to six vessels, Southern Cross being the fleet's oldest.|$|E

2500|$|Although some mariners {{questioned}} the advisability of turbine propulsion for larger ships, King Edward's performance led the Allan Line to order turbine machinery from Parsons for new <b>transatlantic</b> <b>liners</b> Victorian and Virginian, both launched in 1904. [...] And {{within five years}} of King Edward's maiden voyage, the reliability and superiority of turbine power had been sufficiently well-established that the Cunard Line, supported by the British government, specified turbine propulsion for its great ocean liners Lusitania and Mauretania, vastly larger than King Edward.|$|R

He graduated to gambling on <b>transatlantic</b> <b>liners</b> and in European casinos, and eventually fell in with Arnold Rothstein, a loan shark, bookmaker, fence, Wall Street swindler, real estate speculator, and labor racketeer, who was best known for fixing the 1919 World Series.|$|R
60|$|Toward {{the end of}} {{the summer}} of 1917 it was very hot in New York, and hotter still aboard the <b>transatlantic</b> <b>liner</b> thrust between the piers. One glance at our cabins, at the crowded decks and dining-room, at the little writing-room above, where the ink had congealed in the ink-wells, sufficed to bring home to us that the days of luxurious sea travel, of a la carte restaurants, and Louis Seize {{bedrooms}} were gone--at least for a period. The prospect of a voyage of nearly two weeks was not enticing. The ship, to be sure, was far from being the best of those still running on a line which had gained a magic reputation of immunity from submarines; three years ago she carried only second and third class passengers! But most of us were in a hurry to get to the countries where war had already become a grim and terrible reality. In one way or another we had all enlisted.|$|E
