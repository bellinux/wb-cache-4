5|$|The Central American {{squirrel}} monkey is omnivorous. Its diet includes insects and insect larvae (especially grasshoppers and caterpillars), spiders, fruit, leaves, bark, flowers and nectar. It also eats small vertebrates, including bats, birds, lizards and tree frogs. It finds its food foraging through the lower and middle {{levels of the}} forest, typically between fifteen and <b>thirty</b> <b>feet</b> high. Two-thirds to three-quarters of each day is spent foraging for food. It has difficulty finding its desired food late in the wet season, when fewer arthropods are available.|$|E
5|$|Between 11 March (Commonwealth Day) and 10 August 2002, {{as part of}} the {{preparations}} for the upcoming Commonwealth Games and to celebrate Her Majesty the Queen's Golden Jubilee, a national Spirit of Friendship Festival was organised. On 9 July, {{a few weeks before the}} Games began, a sculpture outside the new national headquarters of the English Institute of Sport at SportCity was unveiled by the middle-distance runner, Steve Cram MBE. This sculpture, commissioned in late 2001, was created in a little over eight weeks by Altrincham-based artist, Colin Spofforth, who had submitted to Manchester City Council his idea for a heroic-sized sculpture of a sprinter as a means of celebrating the beauty, power and determination of the competing athletes. Reaching <b>thirty</b> <b>feet</b> high, weighing seven tonnes, and titled The Runner, this unique larger-than-life bronze statue of a male sprinter surmounting a bronze globe was, at the time, the United Kingdom's largest sporting sculpture. It depicts the very moment the runner leaves the blocks once the starter's gun has fired.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, most texts, {{following}} Owen's {{estimate of}} 1841, give a body length of <b>thirty</b> <b>feet</b> or nine metres for Megalosaurus. The {{lack of an}} articulated dorsal vertebral series {{makes it difficult to}} determine an exact size. David Bruce Norman in 1984 thought Megalosaurus was seven to eight metres long. Gregory S. Paul in 1988 estimated the weight tentatively at 1.1 tonnes, given a thighbone seventy-six centimetres long. The trend in the early twenty-first century to limit the material to the lectotype inspired even lower estimates, disregarding outliers of uncertain identity. Paul in 2010 stated Megalosaurus was six metres long and seven hundred kilogrammes heavy. However, the same year Benson claimed that Megalosaurus, though medium-sized, was still among the largest of Middle Jurassic theropods. Specimen BMNH 31806, a thighbone 803 millimetres long, would indicate a body weight of 943 kilogrammes, using the extrapolation method of J.F. Anderson — which method, optimised for mammals, tends to underestimate theropod masses by at least a third. Furthermore, thighbone specimen OUM J13561 has a length of about eighty-six centimetres.|$|E
50|$|Frederick City's {{first new}} bus order {{consisted}} of 1981 vintage TMC <b>thirty</b> <b>foot</b> buses served the original Red and Blue Routes numbered 200-203.

25|$|Although ground sloths were {{relatively}} easy to spot, this did not make hunting them easy. Big game hunters' weapons were useless if ground sloths were further than <b>thirty</b> <b>feet</b> away. Additionally, the ground sloths' already thick hide consisted of osteoderms, which made it exceptionally thick. It was difficult to take down a ground sloth with a spear-thrower; killing a ground sloth required extensive knowledge of the species. Ground sloths' size and claws were strong enough to tear apart tree branches, making it dangerous for hunters to approach these animals.|$|E
25|$|The annual {{snowfall}} {{is up to}} <b>thirty</b> <b>feet</b> (over nine meters).

Likewise, the Purcells and the neighbors could enjoy the home’s front garden, created in collaboration with landscape architect Harry Franklin Baker, including a reflecting pool with water plants and small fountain, and native plants and trees. The back porch overlooked the Lake of the Isles, where the Purcells could enjoy a secluded natural haven {{in the center of}} Minneapolis, in concordance with Prairie School ideals.|$|E
25|$|Johnson’s poke check {{could also}} be used to force {{turnovers}} and generate offensive rushes. Combining good breakaway speed with positional awareness, Johnson would charge an oncoming attacker, use his poke check to strip the player of the puck, bank it off the sideboards and race after it. While on the attack himself, he would often deliberately make as if he were dumping the puck in. Instead, when <b>thirty</b> <b>feet</b> from the opposing net, he would deliberately fire the puck along the boards so that it rimmed around behind the opponent’s goalie; however, rather than chase after it, he would subsequently cut across the slot and pick up the puck as it came out the other side.|$|E
25|$|Finally, the Siamese {{relied on}} a heavily {{fortified}} Ayutthaya city, strategically situated at the estuary of two rivers where high rising waters in the rainy season had kept it safe against enemies over the centuries. The Siamese had used their wealth to acquire several thousand muskets and artillery. Some of the cannon were <b>thirty</b> <b>feet</b> (9 m) long, and fired 100-lb. (45-kg.) balls. (When the Burmese finally captured Ayutthaya in 1767, they found over 10,000 brand new muskets and ammunition in the royal armoury, still left unused even after a 14-month siege.) As {{was the case in}} 1760, foreign mercenaries (including some Europeans and the Chinese) were hired for Ayutthaya's defence. At least one English ship was enlisted for her broadsides.|$|E

25|$|Leedsichthys fossils {{have been}} {{difficult}} to interpret because the skeletons were not completely made of bone. Large parts consisted of cartilage that did not fossilize. On several occasions the enigmatic large partial remains have been mistaken for stegosaurian dinosaur bones. As the vertebrae are among the parts that have not been preserved, it is hard to determine the total body length. Estimates have varied wildly. At {{the beginning of the twentieth}} century a length of nine metres (<b>thirty</b> <b>feet)</b> was seen as plausible, but by its end Leedsichthys was sometimes claimed to have been over thirty metres (hundred feet) long. Recent research has lowered this to about sixteen metres (fifty feet) for the largest individuals. Skull bones have been found indicating that Leedsichthys had a large head with bosses on the skull roof. Fossilised bony fin rays show large elongated pectoral fins and a tall vertical tail fin. The gill arches were lined by gill rakers, equipped by a unique system of delicate bone plates, that filtered plankton from the sea water, the main food source.|$|E
25|$|Lori Lee Kursa, 13, a Lawrence Cook Middle School student, {{had been}} {{reported}} missing by her mother on November 11, 1972 after disappearing while they shopped at a U-Save and was last seen on November 20 or 21 in Santa Rosa while visiting friends, having deliberately run away. She had been known to hitchhike occasionally. Her frozen remains were located on December 14 in a ravine approximately fifty feet off Calistoga Road, northeast of Rincon Valley in Santa Rosa. The killer had thrown the body at least <b>thirty</b> <b>feet</b> over an embankment. The cause of her death was a broken neck with compression and hemorrhage of the spinal cord. The victim had not been raped and likely died one to two weeks prior to discovery. A possible witness to her abduction later came forward stating that on an evening somewhere between December 3 and 9, while on Parkhurst Drive he saw two men push a girl fitting Kursa's description {{into the back of}} a van driven by a Caucasian man with an Afro-type hairstyle. The vehicle then sped north on Calistoga Road.|$|E
25|$|McKesson's Robot RX {{is another}} {{healthcare}} robotics product that helps pharmacies dispense thousands of medications daily {{with little or}} no errors. The robot can be ten feet wide and <b>thirty</b> <b>feet</b> long and can hold hundreds of different kinds of medications and thousands of doses. The pharmacy saves many resources like staff members that are otherwise unavailable in a resource scarce industry. It uses an electromechanical head coupled with a pneumatic system to capture each dose and deliver it to its either stocked or dispensed location. The head moves along a single axis while it rotates 180 degrees to pull the medications. During this process it uses barcode technology to verify its pulling the correct drug. It then delivers the drug to a patient specific bin on a conveyor belt. Once the bin is filled with all of the drugs that a particular patient needs and that the robot stocks, the bin is then released and returned out on the conveyor belt to a technician waiting to load it into a cart for delivery to the floor.|$|E
