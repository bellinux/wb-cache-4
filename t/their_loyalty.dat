5|$|Soon {{after the}} bills were introduced, Social Credit MLAs were {{subjected}} to a new loyalty pledge, this one shifting the target of <b>their</b> <b>loyalty</b> from the Social Credit Board to the cabinet. Six MLAs—including former cabinet ministers Chant, Cockroft, and Ross—refused to sign, and were ejected from caucus.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day the Spanish entered Tecpan Atitlan, the Tz'utujil capital, but found it deserted. The Tz'utujil leaders responded to Alvarado's messengers by surrendering to Pedro de Alvarado and swearing loyalty to Spain, {{at which point}} Alvarado considered them pacified and returned to Iximche; three days later, the lords of the Tz'utujil arrived there to pledge <b>their</b> <b>loyalty</b> and offer tribute to the conquistadors.|$|E

5|$|An {{elite and}} well trained force of bodyguards known as Garudas {{protected}} {{the members of}} the royal family at all times. These servants moved closely yet inconspicuously by the side of their master, <b>their</b> <b>loyalty</b> being so complete that they committed suicide after his death. Hero stones (virgal) erected in memory of these bodyguards are called Garuda pillars. The Garuda pillar at the Hoysaleswara temple in Halebidu was erected in honor of Kuvara Lakshma, a minister and bodyguard of King Veera Ballala II.|$|E
5|$|Following {{requests}} by Singaporeans, {{guidelines for}} the use of the flag were further broadened in 2006 to give residents a variety of opportunities to express <b>their</b> <b>loyalty</b> to Singapore during National Day celebrations such as the National Day Parade. MICA permitted them to display the flag on vehicles and on themselves or belongings with minimal restrictions, from the middle of July to the end of August for a trial period. The period was extended in 2007 to three months from July to September.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{now hold}} {{that there was}} likely no {{cross-pollination}} between the Revolt of the Lash and these subsequent revolts. The formerly mutinous Minas Geraes, {{under the command of}} João Cândido after the officers abandoned the ship, used a hidden-away gun (as the ship had otherwise been disarmed after the Revolt of the Lash) to fire on the marine infantry and demonstrate <b>their</b> <b>loyalty.</b> Even so, the government and navy, fueled by anger over their lost honor, used this opportunity to round up the remaining amnestied sailors and put them in prison.|$|E
40|$|Maxwell Boltzmann {{distribution}} with maximum entropy {{approach has}} been used to study the variation of political temperature and heat in a locality. We have observed that the political temperature rises without generating any political heat when political parties increase their attractiveness by intense publicity, but voters do not shift <b>their</b> <b>loyalties.</b> It has also been shown that political heat is generated and political entropy increases with political temperature remaining constant when parties do not change their attractiveness, but voters shift <b>their</b> <b>loyalties</b> (to more attractive parties) ...|$|R

5|$|In March 1553 Suleiman urged Isabella {{to return}} to Hungary. Péter Petrovics rose against Ferdinand, and an {{assembly}} of the Székely people declared <b>their</b> <b>loyalty</b> to John Sigismund. However, both uprisings were crushed {{before the end of}} September. Deciding in April 1554 that Hungary should be restored to John Sigismund, Suleiman allowed Péter Petrovics to take control of two fortresses in Banat. Henry II of France, engaged in war against the Habsburgs, also urged Isabella {{to return to}} Hungary, promising one of his daughters in marriage to John Sigismund.|$|E
5|$|Sultan Iskandar and {{his family}} members were not prosecuted for their past {{violations}} of the law on grounds that the royal immunity was still applicable when the incidences occurred. Nevertheless, shortly after the incident, Sultan Iskandar was prompted {{to take steps to}} rehabilitate his public image, which was more or less tarnished by the incident. In a public speech shortly after the episode, the Sultan was noted to have toned down somewhat on his hardline image and appeared to be somewhat more humble, appealing to Johoreans to maintain <b>their</b> <b>loyalty</b> to him.|$|E
5|$|The Flag of Scotland, {{also known}} as the Saint Andrew's Cross or more {{commonly}} The Saltire, is the national flag of Scotland. The Saltire is the correct flag for all individuals and corporate bodies to fly in order to demonstrate both <b>their</b> <b>loyalty</b> and Scottish nationality. It is also, where possible, flown from Scottish Government buildings every day from 8am until sunset, with certain exceptions; for example United Kingdom National Days.|$|E

50|$|When liberal leader Anastasio Somoza García {{took power}} in 1936, the Church {{abandoned}} <b>their</b> <b>loyalties</b> to the Conservatives and became {{dedicated to the}} Somoza regime. <b>Their</b> new <b>loyalties</b> stemmed {{from the fact that}} Somoza stated himself as an anti-Marxist and did not continue the persecution of the Church as liberals before him had, but also, that Somoza was responsible for Sandino’s death. A new constitution was born under the Somoza regime in 1950; it was a negotiation between previous anticlerical measures and traditional church privileges.|$|R
5|$|Tudur and Goronwy {{were two}} of three men who {{witnessed}} the Madog's charter, known as the Penmachno Document, in 1294 which granted lands in Ardudwy and Llansannan to Bleddyn Fychan. After the revolt failed, Tudur was among those lords from North Wales who pledged <b>their</b> <b>loyalty</b> to Edward in person in 1296, and again to Edward of Caernarfon when he was invested as Prince of Wales in 1301.|$|E
5|$|After the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan {{fell to the}} Spanish in 1521, the Kaqchikel Maya of Iximche sent envoys to Hernán Cortés {{to declare}} their {{allegiance}} to the new ruler of Mexico, and the K'iche' Maya of Q'umarkaj may also have sent a delegation. In 1522 Cortés sent Mexican allies to scout the Soconusco region of lowland Chiapas, where they met new delegations from Iximche and Q'umarkaj at Tuxpán; both of the powerful highland Maya kingdoms declared <b>their</b> <b>loyalty</b> to the King of Spain. But Cortés' allies in Soconusco soon informed him that the K'iche' and the Kaqchikel were not loyal, and were harassing Spain's allies in the region. Cortés despatched Pedro de Alvarado with 180 cavalry, 300 infantry, 4 cannons, and thousands of allied warriors from central Mexico; they arrived in Soconusco in 1523.|$|E
5|$|Both clubs {{received}} an allocation of approximately 20,000 tickets, {{out of a}} total capacity of 52,063. The remaining seats are accounted for by Hampden Park debenture holders, hospitality, sponsors, media and segregation areas. In excess of 1,000 unused debentures were distributed to each club. The allocation was enough to provide for the season ticket holders of each club, with Hearts having 10,000 and Hibs 7,500 approximately, although both clubs anticipated that there would be little or no need for a general public sale. Hearts decided to sell tickets using <b>their</b> <b>loyalty</b> points system, while Hibs connected their allocation to sales of season tickets and memberships. Due to high demand, Hearts tightened the criteria needed for a ticket during the sales process. Regular tickets cost £35 or £28 for adults and £10 for children under 15 years old.|$|E
50|$|During the Civil War, many skirmishes {{took place}} {{up and down}} the Cumberland River to control the {{movement}} of barges laden with supplies.

50|$|However, {{throughout}} the 1980s {{and until the}} Labour landslide victory of 1997, many voters in the area transferred <b>their</b> <b>loyalties</b> to the Conservative Party. The MP throughout that period was David Amess, who himself originated from east London (Plaistow), and now holds the safer seat of Southend West.|$|R
5|$|During their {{dealings}} with the Nausets over the release of John Billington, the Pilgrims learned of troubles that Massasoit was experiencing. Massasoit, Squanto, and several other Wampanoags had been captured by Corbitant, sachem of the Narragansett tribe. A party of ten men {{under the leadership of}} Myles Standish set out to find and execute Corbitant. While hunting for Corbitant, they learned that Squanto had escaped and Massasoit was back in power. Several Native Americans had been injured by Standish and his men and were offered medical attention in Plymouth. They had failed to capture Corbitant, but the show of force by Standish had garnered respect for the Pilgrims and, as a result, nine of the most powerful sachems in the area signed a treaty in September, including Massasoit and Corbitant, pledging <b>their</b> <b>loyalty</b> to King James.|$|E
5|$|In {{a sign of}} {{problems}} to come, three Spaniards passing through a region near the Peñol de Cerquín were attacked and killed. This area was considered pacified, and the attack deeply disturbed Montejo, since similar incidents during his conquest of Yucatán had been a prelude to general uprisings. He rushed {{to the scene of}} the attack with a strong force, and summoned all the native leaders to meet him, in an effort to forestall rebellion. He investigated the attack and meted out punishment to the most guilty, then continued with conciliatory policies towards the rest of the leaders, who reaffirmed <b>their</b> <b>loyalty.</b> Montejo let the leaders return to their people, then marched to Comayagua to reinforce Cáceres, before returning to Gracias a Dios.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the NHL's {{collective}} bargaining agreement (CBA) expiring in September, teams reassigned players on two-way or entry-level contracts to minor league affiliates. The Canucks assigned 27 players, including Christopher Tanev, Eddie Lack, Zack Kassian and 2012 second-round draft pick Alexandre Mallet to the Chicago Wolves, while first round pick Brendan Gaunce was sent to his junior team, the Belleville Bulls. When the CBA expired on September 15, the NHL enforced a lockout until a new agreement could be reached. Canucks management posted {{a message from the}} team to the fans stating that they would continue with community initiatives throughout the lockout, which they hoped would be resolved as soon as possible, and thanked fans for <b>their</b> <b>loyalty</b> and patience. They also reduced their employees work week to four days and instituted a 20% pay reduction.|$|E

50|$|African Americans grew {{stronger}} in <b>their</b> Democratic <b>loyalties</b> and in <b>their</b> numbers.

50|$|The Pontiac {{region of}} west Quebec, the lower north {{shore of the}} Gulf of St. Lawrence and {{the western part of}} the island of Montreal would remain in Canada on the basis that local populations are {{predominantly}} non-Francophone, and presumably therefore would be Canadian rather than Québécois in <b>their</b> <b>loyalties.</b>|$|R
5|$|Public {{opinion was}} sharply divided. Some {{communities}} supported the rebellion {{for a variety}} of reasons. Others, including Gonzales, declared <b>their</b> <b>loyalty</b> to Mexican President Antonio López de Santa Anna's centralist government. Local leaders began calling for a Consultation to determine whether a majority of settlers favored independence, a return to federalism, or the status quo. Although some leaders worried that Mexican officials would see this type of gathering as a step toward revolution, by the end of August most communities had agreed to send delegates to the Consultation, scheduled for October 15. In the interim, many communities formed militias to protect themselves from a potential attack by military forces.|$|E
5|$|Strafford's {{fall from}} power {{weakened}} Charles's influence in Ireland. The {{dissolution of the}} Irish army was unsuccessfully demanded three times by the English Commons during Strafford's imprisonment, until Charles was eventually forced through lack of money to disband the army {{at the end of}} Strafford's trial. Disputes concerning the transfer of land ownership from native Catholic to settler Protestant, particularly in relation to the plantation of Ulster, coupled with resentment at moves to ensure the Irish Parliament was subordinate to the Parliament of England, sowed the seeds of rebellion. When armed conflict arose between the Gaelic Irish and New English, in late October 1641, the Old English sided with the Gaelic Irish while simultaneously professing <b>their</b> <b>loyalty</b> to the king.|$|E
5|$|The Igu Aro festival (counting of the year) was a royal festival the eze Nri used to {{maintain}} his influence over the communities under his authority. Each of these communities sent representatives to pay tribute during the ceremony to show <b>their</b> <b>loyalty.</b> At the end the Eze Nri would give the representatives a yam medicine and a blessing of fertility for their communities. The festival {{was seen as a}} day of peace and certain activities were prohibited such as the planting of crops before the day of the ceremony, the splitting of wood and unnecessary noise. Igu Aro was a regular event that gave an opportunity for the eze to speak directly to all the communities under him.|$|E
