The Vick Foundation collected donations from communities in Atlanta and Virginia {{to be placed}} in the United In Caring Fund for Victims of the Virginia Tech Tragedy and a special fund at the United Way of Montgomery, Radford and Floyd counties, which serves the Virginia Tech area. The Vick Foundation said <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> used to provide help with funeral expenses, transportation for family members and other support services.|$|E
5|$|Hsu may in {{fact have}} been running {{multiple}} cons on a massive scale. As an example, a New York investment fund run by Woodstock Festival founder Joel Rosenman invested $40 million spread over 37 separate deals with a Hsu company. Hsu reportedly told Rosenman <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> used to manufacture apparel for well known luxury brands, yielding a 40% profit on each deal. When Rosenman's fund recently attempted to cash checks from Hsu's company in September 2007, there were insufficient funds. Federal charges of fraud have since been brought against Hsu.|$|E
5|$|On 2 June, and in {{response}} to a question from Fianna Fáil's James Browne about government spending on mental health, McEntee told the Dáil the government was committed to an annual increase in funding; Browne had noted that in 2014, €20 million had been allocated to mental health services rather than the promised €35 million, but McEntee said that €35 million had been ringfenced for 2016 and 2017. Along with Minister for Health Simon Harris, McEntee argued for the restoration of €12 million originally ringfenced for mental health spending that had been diverted to other areas. On 8 June, and as part of a €480m bailout package for health, the government announced that the mental health funding would be restored. Welcoming the decision, McEntee said <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> used for staff recruitment and to improve services for homeless people, as well as developing perinatal mental health services.|$|E

5|$|On October 29, 2013, Dunderdale held a {{major news}} conference {{regarding}} the fishery at The Rooms in St. John's. Along with cabinet ministers and industry officials, Dunderdale {{announced that the}} federal and provincial governments would be investing $400 million, over three years, into the fishery. The federal government portion of the money totalled $280 million while the provincial portion was $120 million. The money is compensation for the province eliminating minimum processing requirements for the European Union. Although the premier said that her government plans to work with industry officials on how <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> spent, she {{said it would be}} invested into such things as research and development, new marketing initiatives and infrastructure.|$|E
5|$|The two {{chambers}} {{announced that}} their negotiations had reached an impasse {{just days before}} the constitutionally mandated end of the session on April 15, but Bevin insisted he would not call a special legislative session for them to continue negotiations. Just before 3:00a.m. on April 14, negotiators announced they had reached a compromise that would cut public universities' budgets by 4.5 percent over the biennium instead of the 9 percent requested by Bevin and implement a performance-based funding model in 2017. <b>The</b> <b>money</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> reallocated to contribute over $1 billion toward the state pension system's liabilities, which exceeded $30 billion. Republicans agreed to fund a Democratic proposal for a scholarship program providing free community college tuition for qualified students, relented on their demands to stop state funding for Planned Parenthood, and spared the state's prevailing wage guidelines. Bevin signed the budget, but used his line-item veto to strip funding for the scholarship program {{in the first year of}} the biennium, saying the guidelines were poorly written and should be revised before implementing the program in 2017. Because of the constitutional prohibition against the legislative session extending past April 15, the General Assembly was unable to override the veto.|$|E

A Sharia court was convened in bin Laden's compound, and Azzam was found guilty of spreading allegations against Khadr, though no sentence was imposed.|$|E

A Johnson administration request for $45.8 million in initial funding was denied by the House Appropriations Committee in May. Although both administration and FBI officials expressed confidence that <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> restored, a House-Senate budget conference committee in August declined to include the funds in the fiscal 1966 budget.|$|E

The municipal government of Tel Aviv passed legislation in 2009 that was supposed to cover some 1,000 structures. In 2015 the German government and the city of Tel Aviv entered into an agreement under which Germany would contribute 2.8 million euros ($3.2 million) towards the preservation project over a ten-year period; some of <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> used {{for the establishment of a}} preservation center in Tel Aviv's Max-Liebling House to foster collaboration among architects, craftsmen and artists.|$|E

It was stated that <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> used for charity, such as resurrecting Romanian ski jumping. The demand was rejected by the organizers, who stated {{that they would have to}} disqualify the jumpers, as they would be regarded as professionals, rather than amateurs. Since 1997, the World Cup jumps in Holmenkollen have been part of the Nordic Tournament, which includes four successive jumps in four Norwegian, Swedish and Finnish ski jumps, inspired by the Four Hills Tournament.|$|E

His messianic style at these meetings often generated so much enthusiasm that motions were immediately approved to grant large sums {{in support of the}} lines. On the morrow the local politicians often had second and more sober thoughts and sought to control the process themselves, trying to dictate where and when <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> spent, and on what. Long drawn out campaigns ensued with businessmen and progressive farmers whose lots would be near the line advocating large unconditional grants, and those in more distant locations opposing the free bonuses of tax money. Generally the response of the settlers, anxious to expand opportunities for trade and travel, was generous. But, when strongly opposed, Laidlaw's combative and insulting responses could generate such opposition that townships delayed contributing money for years, or refused entirely.|$|E
25|$|Byron v. Rajneesh Foundation International was a 1985 {{lawsuit filed}} by Helen Byron in Portland, Oregon against Rajneesh Foundation International, the {{organization}} of Indian guru Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh (now known as Osho). Byron had been recruited to join the Rajneesh movement by her daughter, Barbara. She traveled to India to join her daughter and the organization. Byron provided over US$300,000 to the organization, {{and some of the}} money was used to buy an armored Rolls Royce for Rajneesh. Byron spoke to the legal leader of the organization, Ma Anand Sheela (Sheela Silverman), and requested that her money be returned, asserting that it was a loan. Sheela reportedly told her that <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> returned to her once the group moved to Oregon. Byron followed the organization to its location in Oregon, known as Rajneeshpuram, and requested through an attorney that her money be returned. In 1985, she filed a lawsuit against the organization in federal court, in the United States District Court for the District of Oregon.|$|E
25|$|Gates' {{position}} on highway construction {{came to be}} at odds with the more conservative wing of the party. The federal government offered matching funds to the state to build certain highways, but they feared taking <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> seen as a sign of going back on their promise to not let the federal government influence them. Gates insisted that it was {{in the best interest of}} the state to accept the money and build the highways, but legislature failed to act on his recommendation. Jenners had been behind the movement to stop the highway construction bill, and Gates retaliated by planning to block Jenners from winning the nomination to run for governor in 1948. The Constitution of Indiana prevented governors from serving consecutive terms, barring Gates from running for office again. However, he still controlled the state party and at the state convention in 1948, he was able to unite the three factions opposing Jenners to deny him the nomination. Jenners, who had a two-hundred vote lead in the first ballot, was outraged and never forgave Gates.|$|E
