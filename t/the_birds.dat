5|$|House sparrows {{sleep with}} the bill tucked {{underneath}} the scapular feathers. Outside of the reproductive season, they often roost communally in trees or shrubs. Much communal chirping occurs before and after <b>the</b> <b>birds</b> settle in the roost in the evening, as well as before <b>the</b> <b>birds</b> leave the roost in the morning. Some congregating sites separate from the roost may be visited by <b>the</b> <b>birds</b> prior to settling in for the night.|$|E
5|$|In larger lek groups {{there is}} less risk of predation. In a group there are more {{individuals}} to alert the group about an approaching predator. All <b>the</b> <b>birds</b> in the groups will be vigilant in looking for a predator because there is an advantage to seeing the predator first. There is also the risk that in a bigger group there will more false alarm signals. The common signal is vocalization, after which <b>the</b> <b>birds</b> will fly up into the trees. It was found <b>the</b> <b>birds</b> did not however give this signal {{when there was a}} snake.|$|E

25|$|In {{a common}} technique, a snare is tied {{near the base}} of <b>the</b> <b>bird's</b> throat, which allows <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> only to swallow small fish. When <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> captures and tries to swallow a large fish, the fish is caught in <b>the</b> <b>bird's</b> throat. When <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> returns to <b>the</b> {{fisherman}}'s raft, the fisherman helps <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> to remove <b>the</b> fish from its throat. The method is not as common today, since more efficient methods of catching fish have been developed, but is still practiced as a cultural tradition.|$|R
50|$|In <b>the</b> case of <b>birds,</b> <b>the</b> GPS unit {{must be very}} {{lightweight}} {{to avoid}} interfering with <b>the</b> <b>bird's</b> ability to fly or swim. The device is usually attached by gluing or, for short deployments, taping to <b>the</b> <b>bird.</b> <b>The</b> unit will then naturally fall off when <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> next moults.|$|R

5|$|The dusky woodswallow is {{medium-sized}} and swallow-like, with a {{dark brown}} hue, {{but there have been}} instances where the bird has appeared grey. <b>The</b> <b>birds</b> have a black patch in front of the eyes, and grey (sometimes also black) wings with white streaks on them. The dusky woodswallow has a black, white-tipped tail with a silver underwing. <b>The</b> <b>birds</b> have a blue-grey bill capped with black.|$|E
5|$|The usual {{call of the}} nelicourvi weaver is a high-pitched, very {{distinct}} chizz-chizz-chizz, {{which is}} more metallical and rasping when <b>the</b> <b>birds</b> are in feeding groups. Other calls that can be heard when <b>the</b> <b>birds</b> are at the nest include tsrrreee, tiang-tiang, and chet. The song, which is produced while being at the nest sounds like chiz-chizz-chswriissssiszz.|$|E
50|$|After <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> died in 1899, medical {{societies}} from New York City requested {{permission to}} make an autopsy on <b>the</b> <b>bird,</b> and Thursby agreed. The autopsy was conducted by physician Henry Holbrook Curtis and veterinarian Frank H. Miller. They discovered that <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> had an extraordinarily large brain and this was responsible for <b>the</b> <b>bird's</b> great abilities.|$|R

I know <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> better than you do, and I {{strongly}} caution you to beware of <b>the</b> <b>bird.</b> <b>The</b> <b>bird</b> is a bird of prey, and altogether an unclean <b>bird.</b> <b>The</b> <b>bird</b> wants a mate and doesn't much care how she finds one. And <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> wants money, and doesn't much care how she gets it. <b>The</b> <b>bird</b> is a decidedly bad bird, {{and not at all}} fit {{to take the place of}} domestic hen in a decent farmyard. In plain English, Johnny, you'll find some day, if you go over too often to Porchester Terrace, either that you are going to marry <b>the</b> <b>bird,</b> or else that you are employing your cousin Toogood for your defence in an action for breach of promise, brought against you by that venerable old <b>bird,</b> <b>the</b> <b>bird's</b> mamma." ...|$|R

5|$|Bald eagle nests {{are often}} very large {{in order to}} {{compensate}} for size of <b>the</b> <b>birds.</b> The largest recorded nest was found in Florida in 1963, and was measured at nearly 10 feet wide and 20 feet deep.|$|E
5|$|Bee-eaters have {{calls that}} are {{characteristic}} for each species. Most sound simple {{to the human}} ear, but show significant variability when studied in detail, carrying significant information for <b>the</b> <b>birds.</b>|$|E
5|$|Black currawongs {{are very}} common around picnic areas in Tasmania's {{two most popular}} National Parks, Freycinet and Cradle Mountain-Lake St Clair, and are often fed by {{tourists}} there. The National Parks Authority tolerated this practice until 1995, when they found <b>the</b> <b>birds</b> were becoming a nuisance and began discouraging people from feeding wildlife. However, the agile currawongs are adept at snatching fragments of food left by picnickers so <b>the</b> <b>birds</b> may only ultimately be discouraged by an (impractical) ban on food in National Parks. Birds also take other items such as soap or cutlery from campsites to examine.|$|E
40|$|On Thursday, 01 February 2007, Scott Raasch {{of rural}} Madison County {{called to say}} he had what he {{believed}} to be a Eurasian Tree Sparrow (Passer montanus) coming to a feeder at his house just east of Enola. <b>The</b> <b>bird</b> had been present for about a week, although he had just identified the species upon purchasing a new field guide. He reported that <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> was very wary and only stayed for a short time at <b>the</b> feeder. <b>The</b> <b>bird</b> was most often observed in the early morning or just before dusk. Dave Heidt and I arrived the following evening and were told we had just missed <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> by a few minutes. We saw a photo that Scott had taken of <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> earlier in <b>the</b> day and it was clearly an adult Eurasian Tree Sparrow. We waited until dusk without seeing <b>the</b> <b>bird.</b> Ellen Brogie, Dave Heidt, and I arrived before sunrise on 03 February, and after a wait of about an hour <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> appeared. Ellen was able to get several photographs of <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> during <b>the</b> few minutes it spent at the feeder. We waited for another hour or more without <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> reappearing. <b>The</b> <b>bird</b> was in <b>the</b> company of several House Sparrows (Passer domesticus) and had the general body structure and appearance of a male House Sparrow, but with very distinct differences. The most notable feature that stood out was the black auricular spot surrounded by white. <b>The</b> <b>bird</b> was noticeably smaller than a House Sparrow and nearby House Finches (Carpodacus mexicanus). <b>The</b> <b>bird</b> had a brown crown rather than gray of a male House Sparrow. <b>The</b> <b>bird</b> did not possess as much black on the throat as a House Sparrow and the white neck collar was also very distinctive. From <b>the</b> back, <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> appeared to be a small House Sparrow. Although Eurasian Tree Sparrow is known to hybridize with the House Sparrow (Leckie, 2001) <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> appeared phenotypically pure and showed no characteristics of hybridization discussed by Leckie...|$|R
25|$|Once the {{processing}} of <b>the</b> <b>bird’s</b> morphology has been completed {{the last piece of}} equipment used is a digital scale. This helps with determining the weight of <b>the</b> <b>bird.</b> This is <b>the</b> last step before releasing <b>the</b> <b>bird.</b>|$|R

5|$|Buffon {{attached}} much {{importance to}} the illustrations; Jacques de Sève illustrated the quadrupeds and François-Nicolas Martinet illustrated <b>the</b> <b>birds.</b> Nearly 2000 plates adorn the work, representing animals with care given both to aesthetics and anatomical accuracy, with dreamlike and mythological settings.|$|E

5|$|Dusky woodswallows {{adhere to}} {{seasonal}} migration and movements. <b>The</b> <b>birds</b> are a nomadic species, {{and tend to}} move quite spontaneously. However, one certain change of habitat occurs for the south-eastern birds, who migrate northward for Autumn.|$|E
5000|$|After a short fanfare {{the curtain}} rises {{revealing}} a mill in Andalusia. The miller {{is trying to}} teach a pet blackbird to tell the time. He tells <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> to chirp twice, but instead it chirps three times. Annoyed, the miller scolds <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> and tells it to try again. <b>The</b> <b>bird</b> now chirps four times. The miller gets angry at <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> again and his wife offers it a grape. <b>The</b> <b>bird</b> takes <b>the</b> grape and chirps twice. The miller and his wife laugh over this and continue their work.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>bird</b> {{places a}} rock on the worm's hole, and paints a fake {{hole on the}} ground; but the worm dives into the fake hole. The worm pops his head out, says to <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> [...] "I fooled ya!", then goes in again. <b>The</b> <b>bird</b> {{attempts}} to dive into the painted hole, but crashes into the ground. The worm {{jumps out of the}} fake hole and dives into a lake. <b>The</b> <b>bird</b> [...] "lifts" [...] the water {{as though it were a}} rug, and sees <b>the</b> cat. <b>The</b> <b>bird</b> runs away, pursued by the cat.|$|R
50|$|Often, a {{cockatiel}} {{sold through}} a pet store {{will have a}} toy in its cage when on display. Purchasing the toy to which <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> has become familiar helps comfort <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> as it adapts to its new surroundings. During times when the owner is {{in the room with}} <b>the</b> <b>bird,</b> <b>the</b> cage door can be left open and, once <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> has become comfortable with the owner's presence, <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> may exit <b>the</b> cage to investigate the owner. Forcing a bird to leave a cage if it's not ready may cause the cockatiel to be less trusting of the owner.|$|R
5|$|Feeding {{is usually}} {{in small groups}} and the bird takes mainly insects. Breeding usually starts in March, with <b>the</b> <b>birds</b> {{building}} their nest high in an acacia tree. <b>The</b> <b>birds</b> usually lay five to six cream eggs with lilac blotches. The nest itself is globular in shape with a tubular entrance on top. It is possible that {{more than just the}} breeding pair visit the nest and that the young of previous years help in rearing the young.|$|E
5|$|Juvenile red-tailed black {{cockatoos}} resemble females until puberty, {{which occurs}} around {{four years of}} age, but have paler yellow barred underparts. As <b>the</b> <b>birds</b> reach maturity, males gradually replace their yellow tail feathers with red ones; the complete process takes around four years.|$|E
5|$|Killer {{whales in}} many areas may prey on {{cormorants}} and gulls. A captive killer whale at MarineLand discovered it could regurgitate fish onto the surface, attracting sea gulls, and then eat <b>the</b> <b>birds.</b> Four others then learned to copy the behaviour.|$|E
50|$|Now {{alone on}} Swamplandia!, Ava meets <b>the</b> <b>Bird</b> Man and hires {{him to take}} her in his pole boat to find her sister. Ava and <b>the</b> <b>Bird</b> Man travel into the remote wilderness. Eventually, Ava becomes {{convinced}} that <b>the</b> <b>Bird</b> Man has no special powers {{and that he is}} taking advantage of her. When they encounter a group of drunken fishermen, Ava screams to get their attention, and <b>the</b> <b>Bird</b> Man silences her. Later, <b>the</b> <b>Bird</b> Man rapes <b>the</b> thirteen-year-old Ava. Ava flees <b>the</b> <b>Bird</b> Man and escapes by diving into a pond where she wrestles her way out of an alligator attack. She surfaces and strikes out across the dense sawgrass marshes still miles from home.|$|R

5000|$|The worm {{approaches}} the cat, and asks {{him if he}} wants to eat. The cat says that he does; and the worm shows him a plan of action: <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> chases <b>the</b> worm to his hole, the worm hides in it, then the cat will catch <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> and eat it. The worm tells the cat that he'll see him in the morning. The worm pulls down a rolling screen in order to bring in the next morning. The plan goes well until the cat fails to eat <b>the</b> <b>bird.</b> <b>The</b> cat then chases <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> around <b>the</b> tree, and after some time, <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> hops out of the hollow and hits the still-running cat with the club. The cat says [...] "Ouch!" [...] and then goes swearing (that dialogue is muted). The worm, not having seen all of this, thinks that cat has eaten <b>the</b> <b>bird,</b> and then walks away. Then, he sees <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> and runs away, ...|$|R
5|$|Ruffs were {{formerly}} trapped {{for food}} in England in large numbers; on one occasion, 2,400 were served at Archbishop Neville's enthronement banquet in 1465. <b>The</b> <b>birds</b> were netted while lekking, sometimes being fattened with bread, milk and seed in holding pens before {{preparation for the}} table.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>birds</b> aggressively {{defend their}} nests and {{surrounding}} areas against other birds and animals. When a predator is persistent, mockingbirds from neighboring territories may be summoned by distinct calls {{to join the}} defense. Other birds may gather to watch as the mockingbirds harass the intruder. In addition to harassing domestic cats and dogs that they consider a threat, mockingbirds will at times target humans. <b>The</b> <b>birds</b> are unafraid and will attack much larger birds, even hawks. One incident in Tulsa, Oklahoma involving a postal carrier resulted {{in the distribution of}} a warning letter to residents.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>birds</b> of Thailand {{represent}} {{nearly one}} thousand species, of which approximately 45 are rare or accidental. At least seven bird species previously found in Thailand {{have since been}} extirpated, and approximately fifty of the country's species are globally threatened.|$|E
5000|$|Percy's {{example is}} {{of a boy}} on a hunting trip who sees a bird and asks what it is. The African-American {{accompanying}} him and his father calls <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> a blue dollar, which excites the boy until his father corrects him and tells him <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> is actually a blue darter. The term blue darter may describe what <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> does and what color it is, says Percy, but blue dollar in some mystical way gets at what <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> actually is. When the boy saw <b>the</b> <b>bird,</b> he formed a subjective impression of it—what Percy calls <b>the</b> <b>bird's</b> [...] "apprehended nature" [...] (72)--and in some sense the mistaken name blue dollar gets right {{at the heart of}} that apprehended nature.|$|R

Following this the hunter came in front of the king and demanded <b>the</b> <b>bird.</b> He also says, [...] "whole of my today's time is wasted behind this bird. I and my family has to fulfill our hunger by this bird." [...] On the other hand <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> demanded <b>the</b> king to save it from the hunter.|$|R
