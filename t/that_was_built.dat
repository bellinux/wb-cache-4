5|$|For the {{interior}} scenes used {{to depict the}} first moments of the Impala being hit, the actors were required {{to sit in the}} car in front of a blue screen; this allowed for the truck's headlights to later be added in with visual effects.

The passenger-side window was then shattered, though the actors were protected by a sheet of Lexan that had been placed very close to the window; at the same time, cannons beneath the frame blew out pieces of rubber glass to give the appearance that the window had exploded onto them.|$|E
