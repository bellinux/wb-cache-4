25|$|Development {{of speed}} {{cushions}} has {{focused primarily on}} the European context. Consumer vehicles in Europe are typically smaller than American vehicles. This is to accommodate smaller demand for passengers and to better suit narrower road widths. European vehicles typically have a narrower <b>track</b> <b>width</b> than American vehicles, meaning their left and right wheels are closer together. Emergency vehicles still feature a wide <b>track</b> <b>width,</b> {{and the difference between}} them makes speed cushions more applicable.|$|E
25|$|The full tape width is 3.8mm. For mono {{recording}} the <b>track</b> <b>width</b> is 1.5mm. In stereo mode each channel has width of 0.6mm with a 0.3mm separation to avoid crosstalk.|$|E
25|$|A blank 40‑track disk {{formatted}} {{and written}} on an 80‑track drive {{can be taken}} to its native drive without problems, and a disk formatted on a 40‑track drive can be used on an 80‑track drive. Disks written on a 40‑track drive and then updated on an 80 track drive become unreadable on any 40‑track drives due to <b>track</b> <b>width</b> incompatibility.|$|E

2500|$|Some O-scale modelers {{choose to}} model prototypes at other than {{standard}} gauge and follow wide gauge (also known as broad-gauge) or narrow-gauge railroads. There is no standard for wide- or narrow-gauge model track, and modelers wishing to portray such railway track either build their own, or more commonly accept {{the shortcomings of}} appropriately wider or narrower gauge model track. , [...] and [...] are the more popular <b>track</b> <b>widths</b> used by indoor enthusiasts modeling narrow gauge. Differences in regional scales give different prototype gauges to these different model <b>track</b> <b>widths.</b>|$|R
50|$|Another {{cause of}} {{incompatibility}} between tape decks {{was the lack}} of standardisation of <b>track</b> <b>widths</b> and the use of alternate (rather than adjacent) stereo tracks by many manufacturers (which limited compatibility with mono equipment).|$|R
25|$|The third {{generation}} Mini was unveiled by BMW in November 2013, with sales {{starting in the}} first half of 2014. The new car is 98 mm longer, 44 mm wider, and 7 mm taller than the outgoing model, with a 28 mm longer wheelbase and an increase in <b>track</b> <b>width</b> (+42 mm front and +34 mm rear). The increase in size results in a larger interior and a boot volume increase to 211 litres.|$|E
25|$|Daihatsu, Honda, Mitsubishi, and Suzuki all {{manufacture}} kei cars, while Nissan sells badge-engineered Mitsubishi and Suzuki models, Mazda offers badge-engineered Suzuki models, and Toyota and Subaru offer badge-engineered Daihatsu models. German brand Smart {{offered a}} kei {{version of its}} Fortwo called the Smart K in Japan at Yanase dealerships from 2001 to 2004 with specially developed rear fenders, reduced tire dimensions and <b>track</b> <b>width,</b> to conform to kei car standards, though ultimately the model sold the fewest examples of a kei car when it was marketed.|$|E
25|$|In this quasi-legendary era, horse or chariot races {{would have}} been held at the Circus site. The <b>track</b> <b>width</b> may have been {{determined}} by the distance between Murcia's and Consus' shrines at the southeastern end, and its length by the distance between these two shrines and Hercules' Ara Maxima, supposedly older than Rome itself and sited behind the Circus' starting place. In later developments, the altar of Consus, {{as one of the}} Circus's patron deities, was incorporated into the fabric of the south-eastern turning post. When Murcia's stream was partly built over, to form a dividing barrier (the spina or euripus) between the turning posts, her shrine was either retained or rebuilt. In the Late Imperial period, both the southeastern turn and the circus itself were sometimes known as Vallis Murcia.|$|E
5000|$|This time, the 2,473 cc six {{cylinder}} engine had {{its maximum}} output raised to [...] at 4,100 rpm. [...] Wheelbase, <b>track</b> <b>widths,</b> length and width were all slightly increased, while a flatter roof made the car some 6 cm lower.|$|R

40|$|Wear {{characteristics}} of aged and unaged composite restorative materials were compared using single-pass sliding. There were differences in wear <b>track</b> <b>widths,</b> tangential forces, and surface failure classifications between aged and unaged composites.

25|$|The Armstrong gun—mainly the 12 pounder—was used {{extensively}} in the 1863 conflict in New Zealand between British troops and Maori in the Waikato. A well preserved 12-pounder which {{was used in the}} battle of Rangiriri is at the Te Awamutu museum. The barrel can traverse 6 degrees left or right without moving the gun carriage. The wheels are wooden with a 75mm wide steel band. The wheel diameter is 1.7 m. The <b>track</b> <b>width</b> is 1.8 m. Barrel width at the muzzle is 140mm. Such was the confidence of the army in the accuracy of the gun that at the battle of Hairini Ridge the artillery was fired {{over the heads of the}} advancing infantry as they stormed the ridge. The infantry took cover in a slight depression in the ground in front of the Maori trenches and then stormed the trenches when the shelling stopped.|$|E
500|$|Accuracy of {{coupling}} factor {{depends on the}} dimensional tolerances for the spacing of the two coupled lines. For planar printed technologies this {{comes down to the}} resolution of the printing process which determines the minimum <b>track</b> <b>width</b> that can be produced and also puts a limit on how close the lines can be placed to each other. [...] This becomes a problem when very tight coupling is required and [...] couplers often use a different design. [...] However, tightly coupled lines can be produced in air stripline which also permits manufacture by printed planar technology. [...] In this design the two lines are printed {{on opposite sides of the}} dielectric rather than side by side. [...] The coupling of the two lines across their width is much greater than the coupling when they are edge-on to each other.Matthaei et al., pp.585–588, 776–778 ...|$|E
500|$|In April 1941, {{production}} of the Panzer IV Ausf.F started. It featured [...] single-plate armor on the turret and hull, {{as opposed to the}} appliqué armor added to the Ausf.E, and a further increase in side armor to [...] The main engine exhaust muffler was shortened and a compact auxiliary generator muffler was mounted to its left. The weight of the vehicle was now , which required a corresponding modification of <b>track</b> <b>width</b> from [...] to reduce ground pressure. The wider tracks also facilitated the fitting of track shoe [...] "ice sprags", and the rear idler wheel and front sprocket were modified. The designation Ausf.F was changed in the meantime to Ausf.F1, after the distinct new model, the Ausf.F2, appeared. A total of 471 Ausf.F (later temporarily called F1) tanks were produced from April 1941 to March 1942.|$|E
40|$|Wear of microfilled composites, {{a visible}} light-cured composite, and a {{conventional}} composite {{were characterized by}} two-body abrasion and single-pass sliding. There were differences in abrasion rates among the materials. Tangential forces, wear <b>track</b> <b>widths,</b> and surface failure modes were different among materials. Wear characteristics are combinations of these properties...|$|R
50|$|In {{controlled}} traffic farming {{systems for}} vegetable cropping, <b>track</b> <b>widths</b> vary between 1.83 m (the 72” imperial standard) to customised systems of perhaps 3.2 m or more. Road transport with these wide systems can be difficult but their use in the Netherlands and Denmark is increasing and growers accept the constraints because of the advantages that the systems bring.|$|R
50|$|The game {{is known}} as being very {{difficult}} to complete, the <b>tracks</b> <b>width</b> remains constant at 3 lanes of racing, and any slight contact with an opposing race car will result in either a spin, or a spectacular flip in the air.

50|$|A warning <b>track's</b> <b>width</b> is not {{specified}} in the rules. It is generally designed to give about three steps of warning to the highest-level players using the field. Typical widths run from about six feet for Little League fields to about 10-15 feet (3 - 4.5 m) for college- or professional-level play. A warning track this wide also lets groundskeepers avoid driving maintenance vehicles on the grass.|$|R
5000|$|Furthermore, {{there have}} been several calls for an {{additional}} light rail scheme based upon the current railway lines running through the town. Lately, connecting this light rail project with Gråkallbanen to form a tram-train system have been suggested but the different <b>track</b> <b>widths</b> (Gråkallbanen uses [...] and the NSB lines [...] ) might be a problem. A connecting PRT system in town have also been suggested.|$|R
50|$|CART renewed the 500-mile oval race in 1997 at {{the newly}} built California Speedway in Fontana, California. The new track was built just 4 mi from the {{previous}} Ontario circuit. The event was held under the moniker Marlboro 500, and served as the CART season finale. This event was held through 2002. The race became known for closed-course record speeds, and fast and competitive racing, owing much to the <b>track's</b> <b>width.</b>|$|R
2500|$|After the First World War {{there were}} several {{attempts}} to introduce a model railway about {{half the size of}} 0 scale that would be more suitable for smaller home layouts and cheaper to manufacture. H0 was created to meet these aims. For this new scale, a <b>track</b> <b>width</b> of 16.5mm was designed to represent prototypical standard gauge track, and a model scale of 1:87 was chosen. By as early as 1922 the firm Bing in Nuremberg, Germany, had been marketing a [...] "tabletop railway" [...] for several years. This came on a raised, quasi-ballasted track with a gauge of 16.5mm, which was described at that time either as 00 or H0. The trains initially had a clockwork drive, but from 1924 were driven electrically. Accessory manufacturers, such as Kibri, marketed buildings in the corresponding scale.|$|E
2500|$|The Mark E Tourer was {{eventually}} {{put on the}} market in December 1957 alongside the Mark D. In production, the Mark E was notably different from its prototype with a shorter wheelbase and wider track to correct the stability issues.

40|$|In Broward County, Florida, {{the number}} of loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) nests has shown an {{increasing}} trend since 1981. A means of assessing population structure to determine if this increase may {{be a result of}} younger first-time nesting turtles would be a valuable management tool. The significant direct correlation between crawl width and clutch size found in this study, coupled with the established direct relation of carapace length and clutch size suggest that crawl <b>track</b> <b>widths</b> may be an indicator of the turtle body sizes, and therefore, the relative age of the nesting sea turtles. The raw data from 10 years of nesting loggerhead sea turtles, provided by the Broward County Sea Turtle Conservation Program, was analyzed by linear regression analysis and percent frequency using the turtle 2 ̆ 7 s crawl <b>track</b> <b>widths,</b> clutch sizes and date each nest was deposited.
