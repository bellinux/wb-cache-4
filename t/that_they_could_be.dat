5|$|As The World Ends with You {{focuses on}} the {{character}} of Neku Sakuraba, {{in order to create a}} believable story the developers put a lot of focus on his development, such as how he would feel, what thoughts lie behind his actions, how he interacted with other characters, and how the people around him feel about him. The developers included aspects and daily concerns, hoping <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> things that players would have to deal with their personal lives and therefore would let them relate with Neku.|$|E
5|$|In response, Assistant to the Solicitor General Matthew D. Roberts argued {{on behalf}} of the United States that patient care and not {{educational}} curricula occupies the vast majority of residents' time. He also argued that although the 1939 FICA Amendment had originally specifically exempted interns, residents who had not yet obtained their unrestricted medical license, that exemption was removed in 1965 to allow doctors to begin paying into Social Security earlier so <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> eligible for certain benefits.|$|E

5|$|Initially, Nakashima, Francois Sammer (a Czech {{architect}} {{who had worked}} for Le Corbusier in Russia) and Chandulal (a devotee who had trained as an engineer), built a full-scale model of the dormitory in order to test the feasibility of the design, and then used it as a laboratory to further refine the construction methods. Nakashima's duties included doing very explicit detail drawings showing, for example, the design of the concrete formwork. Devotees even donated brass utensils so <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> melted down to make door handles and hinges.|$|E
5|$|McCormick {{increasingly}} {{resented the}} favours FitzRoy gave to assist Darwin with collecting. On 16 February, FitzRoy landed a small party including himself and Darwin on St. Paul's rocks, finding the seabirds so tame <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> killed easily, while an exasperated McCormick was left circling the islets {{in a second}} small boat. That evening novices were greeted by a pseudo-Neptune, {{and in the morning}} they crossed the equator with the traditional line-crossing ceremony.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, pre-dreadnoughts {{continued}} in active service and saw significant combat use even when obsolete. Dreadnoughts and battlecruisers were believed vital for the decisive naval battles {{which at the}} time all nations expected, hence they were jealously guarded against the risk of damage by mines or submarine attack, and kept close to home as much as possible. The obsolescence and consequent expendability of the pre-dreadnoughts meant <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> deployed into more dangerous situations and more far-flung areas.|$|E

This edition also offered a transposed version of the Christmas 1723 laudes so <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> fitted in performances of the D major version of the Magnificat.

5|$|Regardless, {{research}} {{has continued to}} illuminate {{the complexity of the}} lemur mind, with emphasis on the cognitive abilities of the ring-tailed lemur. As early as the mid-1970s, studies had demonstrated <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> trained through operant conditioning using standard schedules of reinforcement. The species {{has been shown to be}} capable of learning pattern, brightness and object discrimination, skills common among vertebrates. The ring-tailed lemur has also been shown to learn a variety of complex tasks often equaling, if not exceeding, the performance of simians.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Hornets {{were very}} similar to the {{standard}} USNavy variants, but incorporated a number of minor modifications. These included the addition of an Instrument Landing System/Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range (ILS/VOR) system, a high-frequency radio, a different ejection seat harness and the deletion of all equipment used only to launch the aircraft from catapults. In addition, two of the Australian aircraft were fitted with flight-test instrumentation so <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> used as part of trials.|$|E

5|$|The Iazyges and Carpi raided Roman {{territory}} in 293, and Diocletian {{responded to this}} by declaring war. From 294 to 295 Diocletian waged war upon them, and won. As {{a result of the}} war, some of the Capri were transported into Roman territory, so <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> controlled. From 296 to 298, Galerius successfully campaigned against the Iazyges. In 358 it is recorded that the Iazyges were at war with Rome. Later on, in 375, Emperor Valentinian had a stroke in Brigetio, while meeting with envoys from the Iazyges.|$|E
5|$|The bill {{then passed}} {{to a third}} reading in the House of Lords, where {{it took a few}} minor amendments, but escaped any {{significant}} opposition barring a brief dispute over the status of Cadet units; it was eventually agreed <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> supported by the associations provided that no funding was to be provided from money voted by Parliament. This amendment was accepted by the Government, and the bill passed smoothly to royal assent.|$|E
5|$|The {{dedicated}} but easily angered Djajakusuma {{was influenced}} by Usmar Ismail's realist views, although he focused more on traditional aspects of life. His theatrical performances attempted to modernise traditional forms so <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> better received in a modern world. He is credited with revitalising the Betawi theatre form lenong and received numerous awards for his filmmaking, including a lifetime achievement award at the Indonesian Film Festival.|$|E

5|$|The {{guns were}} {{controlled}} from a Battery Commander's Post on the roof, from where commands {{to the gun}} detachments could be relayed via voice pipes. Three depression range finders were installed on the roof by the late 1890s to aid the guns' targeting. A well-trained crew could fire each gun once every two minutes. Rather than firing all the guns at once, the guns were positioned so <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> fired in sequence as an enemy ship passed by. When combined with the fire from Shornemead and Cliffe Forts on the Kent shore, this would ensure that constant fire could be maintained from three different sides.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Wiesenthal {{dedicated}} most of {{his life}} to tracking down and gathering information on fugitive Nazi war criminals so <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> brought to trial. In 1947 he co-founded the Jewish Historical Documentation Centre in Linz, Austria, where he and others gathered information for future war crime trials and aided refugees in their search for lost relatives. He opened the Documentation Centre of the Association of Jewish Victims of the Nazi Regime in Vienna in 1961 and continued to try to locate missing Nazi war criminals. He played a small role in locating Adolf Eichmann, who was captured in Buenos Aires in 1960, and worked closely with the Austrian justice ministry to prepare a dossier on Franz Stangl, who was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1971.|$|E
5|$|All four Galilean moons {{are bright}} enough <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> sighted from Earth without a telescope, {{if they were}} farther away from Jupiter. (They are, however, easily visible with even low-powered binoculars.) They have {{apparent}} magnitudes between 4.6 and 5.6 when Jupiter is in opposition with the Sun, and are about one unit of magnitude dimmer when Jupiter is in conjunction. The main difficulty in observing the moons from Earth is their proximity to Jupiter since they are obscured by its brightness. The maximum angular separations of the moons are between 2 and 10 minutes of arc from Jupiter, which {{is close to the}} limit of human visual acuity. Ganymede and Callisto, at their maximum separation, are the likeliest targets for potential naked-eye observation.|$|E

5|$|Before 2000, MMA had {{a number}} of {{different}} rule sets, with each one differing in ruling on downward elbow strikes (12-6 elbows). In UFC 1, the first UFC event where there were very few rules, Kevin Rosier used 12-6 elbows on Zane Frazier. In 2000, the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts were drawn up {{to try to make the}} sport more mainstream. The meeting consisted of representatives of a number of major MMA organisations including Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), Pride Fighting Championships and International Fighting Championships (IFC) as well as doctors and referees in New Jersey, United States. In the meeting, doctors raised concerns about 12-6 elbows after seeing an IFC match where 12-6 elbows were used to the back of a fighter's head. One doctor argued <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> life-threatening, and refused to sanction any set of rules that didn't prohibit them.|$|E
5|$|Campania {{was built}} by the Castellammare shipyard, where her keel was laid on 9 August 1913, {{the same day as}} Basilicata. The ships were small enough <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> built on the same slipway. They were {{launched}} {{less than a year later}} on 23 July 1914. After Fitting-out work was completed, Campannia was commissioned on 18 May 1917, four months before her sister ship. Designed as a colonial cruiser in the mold of the cruiser , Campania spent the first several years of her career in Italy's African colonies, including Italian Libya. On 1 July 1921, the ship was reclassified as a gunboat and two of her 152mm guns were removed during reconstruction work that lasted until 1922. Starting in 1932 she served as a school ship for naval cadets. She was capable of carrying 100cadets, along with their officers, petty officers, and support staff. She remained in this role until she was stricken from the naval register on 11 March 1937 and sold for scrapping.|$|E
5|$|For BABS, {{the only}} change was {{to change the}} broadcast's {{transmissions}} {{to a series of}} short pulses rather than a continuous signal. These pulses were sent out when triggered by the AI radar's signals and were powerful enough <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> picked up by the Mk. IV receiver within a few miles. On reception, the Mk. IV would receive either the dots or dashes, and the operator would see an alternating series of blips centred in the display, popping out and then disappearing as the BABS antennas switched. The duration of the blip indicated whether the aircraft was to the left or right, and became a continuous blip on the centreline. This technique was known as AI beam approach (AIBA).|$|E
