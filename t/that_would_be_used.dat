5|$|Beatrice Alice Hicks (January 2, 1919– October 21, 1979) was an American {{engineer}}, {{the first}} woman engineer to be hired by Western Electric, and both co-founder and {{first president of the}} Society of Women Engineers. Despite entering the field at a time where engineering was seen as an inappropriate career for a woman, Hicks held a variety of leadership positions and eventually became the owner of an engineering firm. During her time there, Hicks developed a gas density switch <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> in the U.S. space program, including the Apollo moon landing missions.|$|E

5|$|Sound Transit {{awarded the}} {{construction}} contract for Mount Baker {{station and the}} Beacon Hill Tunnel to Japanese general contractors Obayashi Corporation in June 2004 for $280 million, the costliest component of the Central Link project. Construction began in September 2005 with the permanent closure of Stevens Street and utility relocation to clear the station site. By the following April, Obayashi completed erection of columns <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> to support the elevated guideway and station. Mount Baker station was declared substantially complete in June 2009, excluding work on the elevators and escalators.|$|E
5|$|The Bold Orion missile was {{developed}} {{as part of}} Weapons System 199, initiated by the United States Air Force (USAF) {{in response to the}} U.S. Navy's Polaris program, with funding authorised by the United States Congress in 1957. The purpose of WS-199 was the development of technology <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> in new strategic weapons for the USAF's Strategic Air Command, not to deliver operational weapons; a primary emphasis was on proving the feasibility of an air-launched ballistic missile.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept for}} the Fuchikoma came from one climactic {{scene of the}} film: the battle between Motoko Kusanagi and the big spider-like tank in the museum of paleontology. Based on this tank design, mecha creators Shōji Kawamori and Atsushi Takeuchi made a smaller version, {{designed}} for one person, <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> by the police.

5|$|To {{attack the}} forts, the British and French {{assembled}} a fleet centered on four French and six British ships of the line, led by British Rear Admiral Edmund Lyons and the French Vice Admiral Armand Joseph Bruat. The British contributed a further seventeen frigates and sloops, ten gunboats, and six bomb vessels, along with ten transport vessels. The French squadron included three corvettes, four avisos, twelve gunboats, and five bomb vessels. The transports carried {{a force of}} 8,000 men from French and British army regiments <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> to besiege the forts.|$|E
5|$|Apart from {{attempts}} to control {{the spread of the}} Aedes mosquito there are ongoing efforts to develop antiviral drugs <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> to treat attacks of dengue fever and prevent severe complications. Discovery {{of the structure of the}} viral proteins may aid the development of effective drugs. There are several plausible targets. The first approach is inhibition of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (coded by NS5), which copies the viral genetic material, with nucleoside analogs. Secondly, it may be possible to develop specific inhibitors of the viral protease (coded by NS3), which splices viral proteins. Finally, it may be possible to develop entry inhibitors, which stop the virus entering cells, or inhibitors of the 5′ capping process, which is required for viral replication.|$|E
5|$|Each {{soldier in}} the first two waves had been issued a total of 200 rounds of {{ammunition}} for his rifle, along with rations for one day, and miscellaneous equipment including a gas mask. The third wave had received the same amount of ammunition, but was also issued entrenching equipment <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> to construct positions to defend the initial gains against the inevitable Ottoman counterattack. In support, each battalion had four Vickers medium machine-guns, which had been issued with 3,500 rounds, and contributed a platoon whose job would be to throw the 1,200 grenades that the brigade had been allocated for the attack. A small section of engineers was also allocated to undertake demolitions.|$|E

5|$|Following the crew's post-sleep activities, {{they went}} to work {{performing}} the rendezvous operations that included burning the orbiter's engines to refine the approach to the Hubble telescope. Following some delays due to communications issues, Altman and Johnson ("Ray-J") guided the orbiter within fifty feet of the telescope. McArthur successfully grappled Hubble at 17:14 UTC, and at 18:12 the telescope was safely berthed in the payload bay of Atlantis. Later in the day, Grunsfeld and Feustel (Drew), along with Good ("Bueno") and Massimino ("Mass") worked on preparing for the next day's spacewalk, gathering tools and checking out the suits and equipment <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> during the EVA.|$|E
5|$|I {{saw them}} as the {{ultimate}} all-American band. To me, they reflected the American character in general—an almost childish innocent aggression.... I thought, 'The Great Seal of the President of the United States' would be perfect for the Ramones, with the eagle holding arrows—to symbolize strength and the aggression <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> against whomever dares to attack us—and an olive branch, offered to {{those who want to}} be friendly. But we decided to change it a little bit. Instead of the olive branch, we had an apple tree branch, since the Ramones were American as apple pie. And since Johnny was such a baseball fanatic, we had the eagle hold a baseball bat instead of the 's arrows.|$|E
5|$|In these epochs, she was {{not merely}} {{applying}} ideas and methods of earlier mathematicians; rather, she was crafting new systems of mathematical definitions <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> by future mathematicians. In particular, she developed a completely new theory of ideals in rings, generalizing earlier work of Richard Dedekind. She is also renowned for developing ascending chain conditions, a simple finiteness condition that yielded powerful results in her hands. Such conditions and the theory of ideals enabled Noether to generalize many older results and to treat old problems from a new perspective, such as elimination theory and the algebraic varieties that had been studied by her father.|$|E

5|$|No.1 Long Range Flight {{undertook}} {{intensive training}} in the lead-up to the race. This involved making regular long range return flights between Laverton and Ceylon, Singapore and Christchurch via various air bases in Australia. These exercises were used to establish fuel consumption rates and practice the refuelling and navigation practices <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> in the race. As part of this training the flight broke many Australian and New Zealand air speed records, setting the fastest time for crossing the Tasman Sea during a flight between RAAF Base Amberley and Christchurch on 16August. An aeronautical engineer was attached to No.1 Long Range Flight from the Department of Air to calculate the optimum route for the Canberras to take. On 2September Cuming and Raw visited the Government Aircraft Factories facility at Fishermans Bend in Melbourne to thank the workers who were building Canberra bombers for the RAAF.|$|E
5|$|Reports {{of severe}} and even fatal {{hepatotoxicity}} {{related to the}} use of methoxyflurane began to appear in 1966. These reports prompted anesthesiologists to subject this agent to intense and systematic scrutiny. A study published in 1973 by Cousins and Mazze demonstrated that compared with halothane, methoxyflurane produces dose-dependent and deleterious abnormalities in renal function. The authors showed that subclinical nephrotoxicity occurred following methoxyflurane at minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) for 2.5 to 3hours (2.5 to 3MAC hours), while overt toxicity was present in all patients at dosages greater than five MAC hours. This landmark study provided a model <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> for the assessment of the nephrotoxicity of volatile anesthetics for the next two decades.|$|E
5|$|Scotland {{is known}} for its {{dramatically}} placed castles and towers, which have become an accepted part of a romantic landscape. Castles, tower houses, peel towers and royal palaces of the period all contributed {{to the development of the}} unique style known as the Scots baronial <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> for estate houses in Scotland in the sixteenth century, and which would be revived and used extensively from the nineteenth century, including the royal residence at Balmoral and then exported across the world. The Reformation in the mid-sixteenth century would lead to the rejection of many features of Medieval churches, resulting in the widespread destruction of Medieval church furnishings, ornaments and decoration, and would usher in new architectural forms. However, they would be revived from the 1850s to the 1890s, when large Gothic revival churches were built in considerable numbers for all the major denominations.|$|E

50|$|The {{part of the}} {{declaration}} considered the most troubling was the very last to be mentioned: 'rejecting coercion {{as an instrument of}} policy'. The implication is that not even the Commonwealth itself has any right to enforce its other core values, as <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>using</b> coercion. This apparent conflict was resolved by the Harare Declaration and the Millbrook Commonwealth Action Programme, which clearly mandates the Commonwealth to concern itself with its members' internal situations.|$|R

5|$|The Arizona Jewish Historical Society {{undertook}} a $4 million campaign in 2007 {{to raise the}} funds needed to restore the original synagogue building and other related structures to create the Cutler-Plotkin Jewish Heritage Center. The plan was for the Center to include a museum and other public spaces <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> to show {{the connection between the}} history of the Jewish community as part of Arizona's history. A $150,000 grant had been received in May of that year from the Arizona State Heritage Fund. By August 2008 much of the work of the first phase – the restoration of the sanctuary and annex – had been completed, and $2.1 million of the $2.6 million required for the work had been raised.|$|E
5|$|The {{first thing}} {{he had to do}} was {{determine}} the characteristics of the aircraft <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>used.</b> There were only two Allied aircraft large enough: the British Avro Lancaster and the US Boeing B-29 Superfortress. The United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) wanted to use the B-29 if at all possible, even though it required substantial modification. Ramsey supervised the test drop program, which began at Dahlgren, Virginia, in August 1943, before moving to Muroc Dry Lake, California, in March 1944. Mock ups of Thin Man and Fat Man bombs were dropped and tracked by an SCR-584 ground based radar set of the kind that Ramsey had helped develop at the Radiation laboratory. Numerous problems were discovered with the bombs and the aircraft modifications, and corrected.|$|E
5|$|The state {{forecast}} continued revenue {{declines in}} 2010 {{that would result}} in a $1.7 billion budget shortfall if the state budget grew at its normal rate. Daniels submitted a two-year $27.5 billion spending plan to the General Assembly which would result in a $500 million surplus <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> to rebuild the state reserve funds to $1 billion. He proposed a wide range of budget austerity measures, including employee furloughing, spending reductions, freezing state hiring, freezing state employee wages, and a host of administrative changes for state agencies. The state had already been gradually reducing its workforce by similar freezes, and by 2011, Indiana had the fewest state employees per capita than any other state—a figure Daniels touted to say Indiana had the nation's smallest government.|$|E
