5|$|The gharial is {{featured}} in the folk tales of India. In one story, a gharial and a monkey become friends when <b>the</b> <b>monkey</b> gives the gharial fruit. The gharial's wife demands that her husband bring home <b>the</b> <b>monkey</b> to eat, believing that the fruit made the monkey's heart sweet. The gharial complies at first and attempts to lure <b>the</b> <b>monkey</b> to his home, but soon comes clean about the plan. Their friendship ends after that. Similar stories exist in Native American legends, and in the African American folktale of an alligator and Br'er Rabbit.|$|E

5|$|Based on {{similarities}} in their skull and teeth, {{it was later}} thought that monkey lemurs (Hadropithecus and Archaeolemur) were a sister group to the living indriids and the recently extinct sloth lemurs (family Palaeopropithecidae). However, there was some debate over whether <b>the</b> <b>monkey</b> lemurs or the sloth lemurs were {{more closely related to}} today's indriids. <b>The</b> <b>monkey</b> lemurs had skulls that more closely resembled the indriids, but their teeth were very specialized and unlike those of the indriids. The sloth lemurs, on the other hand, had teeth like the indriids, but very specialized skulls. The matter was settled with the discovery of new skeletons of Babakotia and Mesopropithecus, two genera of sloth lemur, both of which had indriid-like skulls and teeth. More recently, postcranial remains of Hadropithecus found in the early 2000s prompted the suggestion that <b>the</b> <b>monkey</b> lemurs were more closely related to the lemurids. However, DNA sequencing has reaffirmed the sister group status of <b>the</b> <b>monkey</b> lemurs to indriids and sloth lemurs.|$|E

5|$|Chris sets up {{a camera}} in his room to capture the creature. When he reviews the tape he finds no {{evidence}} of the Evil Monkey, and goes ahead with his plans on capturing him. The family is taken aback when Chris proves it is real by capturing <b>the</b> <b>monkey,</b> and showing it to them, but he turns {{out not to be}} evil after all. <b>The</b> <b>monkey</b> then explains himself to the Griffins for being here. He reveals that he got home from work one day and caught his wife cheating on him with another monkey. He went through a deep depression after the divorce, which costed him his job, and all his money was gone, meaning that he lost his house, so he moved into Chris's closet just until he finally got back on his feet, and has lived there for 9 years. He also reveals that the face he makes at Chris was what he makes when thinking, and he was really trying to talk with Chris this whole time (pointing at him was his only way of trying to start a conversation with him). In addition, the trembling was due to a copper deficiency. <b>The</b> <b>monkey</b> apologizes to Chris for unintentionally terrorizing him and wishes to start over. Chris is at first unconvinced, but when <b>the</b> <b>monkey</b> helps him write a book report, he is surprised to receive a passing grade, and the two become great friends.|$|E

5|$|The Nintendo 64 version {{features}} two game types: Deathmatch or Team Deathmatch, {{where the}} objective is to kill as many opposing players as possible; and Frag Tag, in which one random player is transformed into a monkey with no attacks and very little health. The monkey's task is to go to a specific point to return to their normal form and transform another random player into <b>the</b> <b>monkey.</b> Players gain points by killing <b>the</b> <b>monkey</b> and lose points if they die as <b>the</b> <b>monkey.</b> The Microsoft Windows version features three game types: Rok Match, which is the same as Deathmatch; Arena, where two players or teams must battle against each other in an arena setting. The winning player or team will have to face a new opponent. If the player or team loses, they will have to get in line and wait for their next turn to fight again; and Capture the Flag, where the goal is to capture opposing flags and return it to a team's base.|$|E

The first game's nonlinear design was discarded, and the team implemented a Chuck Jones-inspired visual style, alongside numerous puzzles based on time travel. Bernard and the Edison family were retained. The sequel, entitled Day of the Tentacle, was released in 1993.|$|E
