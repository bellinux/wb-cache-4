5|$|Boston College, {{in their}} first {{possession}} of the second half, fared even worse than Virginia Tech did. Two incomplete passes and a 5-yard delay of game penalty forced Boston College into a three-and-out possession {{that resulted in a}} punt. On its second possession, Virginia Tech had a three-and-out drive, <b>thanks</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>to</b> an 11-yard sack of Sean Glennon by Boston College's Kevin Atkins.|$|E
5|$|The Hokies {{lived up}} to their favored status in the first half, running up a 21-3 lead before halftime, <b>thanks</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>to</b> a well-executed pass by wide {{receiver}} Eddie Royal on a trick play. Royal also performed well during punt and kick returns, putting Virginia Tech in good field position throughout the half.|$|E

5|$|The 1950 {{season was}} another strong one for Cleveland. The team {{finished}} {{the regular season}} with a 10–2 record, tied with the New York Giants for {{first place in the}} American Conference. This set up a playoff with the Giants to secure a spot in the championship game against the Los Angeles Rams. Cleveland won 8–3, <b>thanks</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>to</b> Gillom's punts. His kicks repeatedly gave the Giants poor field position and pinned them near their own end zone. The Browns {{went on to win the}} championship against the Rams on a last-minute Lou Groza field goal. Gillom finished second in the league in punting average, with 43.2 yards.|$|E
5|$|The Browns won another {{championship}} in 1954, <b>thanks</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>to</b> a strong regular-season performance from Lavelli. Lavelli {{led the team}} in receiving that year and made the Pro Bowl after the Browns beat the Lions for their second NFL title. A third NFL championship followed in 1955. In the championship game against the Rams, Lavelli caught a touchdown {{in the second quarter}} and scored a second time on a 50-yard pass just {{before the end of the}} first half. The Browns won 38–14.|$|E
5|$|The SG-1000's launch did {{not prove}} to be successful. The three launch games, {{all of which were}} ported from Sega's VIC dual-arcade board, lacked the name {{recognition}} of Famicom launch games Donkey Kong, Donkey Kong Jr., and Popeye. However, the situation was quickly turned around. <b>Thanks</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>to</b> the SG-1000's steadier stream of releases (21 SG-1000 games by the end of 1983, as compared to only 9 Famicom games), and in part to a recall on Famicom units necessitated by a faulty circuit, the SG-1000 chalked up 160,000 units in sales in 1983, far exceeding Sega's projection of 50,000 units.|$|E

5|$|Under the {{presidency}} of Giorgio Ascarelli, the club {{changed its name to}} Associazione Calcio Napoli on 23 August 1926. After a poor start, with a sole point in an entire championship, Napoli was readmitted to Serie A's forerunner, the Divizione Nazionale, by the Italian Football Federation ("FIGC"), and began to improve <b>thanks</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>to</b> Paraguayan-born Attila Sallustro, who was the first fully fledged hero to the fans. He was a capable goal-scorer and eventually set the all-time goal-scoring record for Napoli, which was later bested by players like Diego Maradona and Marek Hamšík.|$|E
5|$|As America's {{involvement}} in World War II intensified, Motley joined the U.S. Navy in 1944 {{and was sent}} to the Great Lakes Naval Training Station. There he played for the Great Lakes Navy Bluejackets, a military team coached by Paul Brown, who was serving in the Navy during an extended leave from his job as head coach of The Ohio State University's football team. Motley played fullback and linebacker at Great Lakes, and was {{an important component of the}} team's offense and defense. The highlight of his time at Great Lakes was a 39–7 victory over Notre Dame in 1945. Motley was eligible for discharge before the game – it was the final match of the season and the last military game of World War II – but he stayed on to play. Motley put up an impressive performance, <b>thanks</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>to</b> Brown's experimentation with a new play: a delayed handoff later called the draw play.|$|E
5|$|Gossip {{was also}} a noted writer. His {{treatise}} The Chess-Player's Manual—A Complete Guide to Chess, a 900-page tome published in 1874 {{after several years of}} work, was harshly received by the critics, largely because he had included a number of informal skittles games that he had (atypically) won against stronger players. As a result, Gossip developed a lifelong enmity toward chess critics, whom he often attacked ferociously in his books. However, his 1879 book Theory of the Chess Openings was well received. Wilhelm Steinitz, the first World Chess Champion, wrote that the 1888 edition of The Chess-Player's Manual {{was one of the best}} available books on the game. <b>Thanks</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>to</b> a 122-page appendix by S. Lipschütz, it became one of the standard opening works of the time.|$|E

5|$|In England, Stephen's reign {{started off}} well, with lavish gatherings {{of the royal}} court that saw the King give out grants of land and favours to his supporters. Stephen {{received}} the support of Pope Innocent II, <b>thanks</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>to</b> the testimony of Louis VI and Theobald. Troubles rapidly began to emerge. Matilda's uncle, David I of Scotland, invaded the north of England on the news of Henry's death, taking Carlisle, Newcastle and other key strongholds. Stephen rapidly marched north with an army and met David at Durham, where a temporary compromise was agreed. South Wales rose in rebellion, and by 1137 Stephen was forced to abandon attempts to suppress the revolt. Stephen put down two revolts in the south-west led by Baldwin de Redvers and Robert of Bampton; Baldwin was released after his capture and travelled to Normandy, where he became a vocal critic of the King.|$|E
5|$|Nancy never lacks money, and {{in later}} {{volumes of the}} series often travels to faraway locations, such as France in The Mystery of the 99 Steps (1966), Nairobi in The Spider Sapphire Mystery (1968), Austria in Captive Witness (1981), Japan in The Runaway Bride (1994), Costa Rica in Scarlet Macaw Scandal (2004), and Alaska in Curse of The Arctic Star (2013). Nancy is also able to travel freely about the United States, <b>thanks</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>to</b> her car, which is a blue {{roadster}} in the original series and a blue convertible in the later books. Despite the trouble and presumed expense to which she goes to solve mysteries, Nancy never accepts monetary compensation; however, by implication, her expenses are often paid by a client of her father's, {{as part of the}} costs of solving one of his cases.|$|E
5|$|Riley {{began his}} career writing verses as a sign maker and {{submitting}} poetry to newspapers. <b>Thanks</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>to</b> an endorsement from poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, he eventually earned successive jobs at Indiana newspaper publishers during the latter 1870s. Riley gradually rose in prominence during the 1880s through his poetry reading tours. He traveled a touring circuit first in the Midwest, and then nationally, holding shows and making joint appearances on stage with other famous talents. Riley was an alcoholic, never married or had children, and created a scandal in 1888 when he became too drunk to perform. He became more popular {{in spite of the}} bad press he received, and as a result extricated himself from poorly negotiated contracts that limited his earnings; he quickly became very wealthy.|$|E

5|$|The {{historical}} {{period that}} {{came to be known as}} the McCarthy era began well before Joseph McCarthy's own involvement in it. Many factors contributed to McCarthyism, some of them extending back to the years of the First Red Scare (1917–20), inspired by Communism's emergence as a recognized political force. <b>Thanks</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>to</b> its success in organizing labor unions and its early opposition to fascism, the Communist Party of the United States increased its membership through the 1930s, reaching a peak of about 75,000 members in 1940–41. While the United States was engaged in World War II and allied with the Soviet Union, the issue of anti-communism was largely muted. With the end of World War II, the Cold War began almost immediately, as the Soviet Union installed Communist puppet régimes across Central and Eastern Europe, while the United States backed anti-communist forces in Greece and China.|$|E
5|$|The symphony had {{established}} itself {{by the end}} of the 18th century as the most prestigious of instrumental genres. While the genre had been developed with considerable intensity throughout that century and appeared in a wide range of occasions, it was generally used as an opening or closing work; in between would be works that included vocal and instrumental soloists. Because of its lack of written text for focus, it was seen as a vehicle for entertainment rather than for social, moral or intellectual ideas. As the symphony grew in size and artistic significance, <b>thanks</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>to</b> efforts in the form by Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven, it also amassed greater prestige. A concurrent change in attitude toward instrumental music in general also took place, and the lack of text, once seen as a handicap, became considered a virtue.|$|E

Without fighter escort, all 15 TBD Devastators of VT-8 were shot down {{without being able to}} inflict any damage. Ensign George H. Gay, Jr. was the only survivor of the 30 aircrew of VT-8. VT-6 lost 10 of its 14 Devastators, and 10 of Yorktowns VT-3's 12 Devastators were shot down with no hits to show for their effort, <b>thanks</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>to</b> the abysmal performance of their unimproved Mark 13 torpedoes.

5|$|With the {{development}} of the rail network, Roskilde became an important hub for traffic with Copenhagen. In the 1870s and 1880s, the harbour was extended attracting industrial firms to the area. By the end of the century, there were tobacco factories, iron foundries and machine shops. At the beginning of the 20th century, Roskilde first prospered as a satellite community for Copenhagen but then, as ships increased in size, suffered {{from the fact that the}} harbour was too small and Roskilde Fjord too shallow for navigation. Industries began to move out of the harbour area but were still the largest source of employment, <b>thanks</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>to</b> the spirits factory (De Danske Spritfabrikker) and the slaughterhouse (Roskilde Andelssvineslagteri).|$|E
5|$|Although lemur {{taxonomy}} had developed, it was {{not until}} the 1950s and 1960s that the in-situ (or on-site) study of lemur behavior and ecology began to blossom. Jean-Jacques Petter and Arlette Petter-Rousseaux toured Madagascar in 1956 and 1957, surveying many of its lemur species and making important observations about their social groupings and reproduction. In 1960, the year of Madagascar's independence, David Attenborough introduced lemurs to the West with a commercial film. Under the guidance of John Buettner-Janusch, who founded the Duke Lemur Center in 1966, Alison Jolly traveled to Madagascar in 1962 to study the diet and social behavior of the ring-tailed lemur and Verreaux's sifaka at Berenty Private Reserve. The Petters and Jolly spawned a new era of interest in lemur ecology and behavior and were shortly followed by anthropologists such as Alison Richard, Robert Sussman, Ian Tattersall, and many others. Following the political turmoil of the mid-1970s and Madagascar's revolution, field studies resumed in the 1980s, <b>thanks</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>to</b> the renewed involvement of the Duke Lemur Center under the direction of Elwyn L. Simons and the conservation efforts of Patricia Wright. In the decades that followed, huge strides have been made in lemur studies and many new species have been discovered.|$|E
5|$|An early Italian humanist {{who came}} to Poland in the mid-15th century was Filippo Buonaccorsi. Many Italian artists came to Poland with Bona Sforza of Milan, when she married King Sigismund I the Old in 1518. This was {{supported}} by temporarily strengthened monarchies in both areas, {{as well as by}} newly established universities. The Polish Renaissance lasted from the late 15th to the late 16th century and was the Golden Age of Polish culture. Ruled by the Jagiellon dynasty, the Kingdom of Poland (from 1569 known as the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth) actively participated in the broad European Renaissance. The multi-national Polish state experienced a substantial period of cultural growth <b>thanks</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>to</b> a century without major wars – aside from conflicts in the sparsely populated eastern and southern borderlands. The Reformation spread peacefully throughout the country (giving rise to the Polish Brethren), while living conditions improved, cities grew, and exports of agricultural products enriched the population, especially the nobility (szlachta) who gained dominance in the new political system of Golden Liberty. The Polish Renaissance architecture has three periods of development.|$|E
