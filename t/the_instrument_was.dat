5|$|The Hammond organ's {{technology}} {{derives from}} the Telharmonium, an instrument created in 1897 by Thaddeus Cahill. The telharmonium used revolving electric alternators which generated tones that could be transmitted over wires. <b>The</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>was</b> bulky, because the alternators had to {{be large enough to}} generate high voltage for a loud enough signal. The Hammond organ solved this problem by using an amplifier.|$|E
5|$|The {{first model}} to be commercially {{manufactured}} was the Mk I in 1963. An updated version, the Mk II, was released {{the following year}} which featured the full set of sounds selectable by banks and stations. <b>The</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>was</b> expensive, costing £1,000, {{at a time when}} a typical house cost £2,000–£3,000.|$|E
5|$|Gregg Allman became {{interested}} in the Hammond after Mike Finnigan had introduced him to Jimmy Smith's music, and started to write material with it. His brother Duane specifically requested he play the instrument when forming the Allman Brothers Band, and he was presented with a brand new B-3 and Leslie 122RV upon joining. Allman recalls <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>was</b> cumbersome to transport, particularly on flights of stairs, which often required the whole band's assistance. Author Frank Moriarty considers Allman's Hammond playing a vital ingredient of the band's sound.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>instrument</b> {{insertion}} device (1) {{consists of two}} seal structures that have a tricuspid valve (2) and a lipseal valve (3) respectively, forming respective passageways (6, 8) through which <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>is</b> inserted. <b>The</b> passageway (6) moves from closed state to open state as <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>is</b> inserted and automatically moves from open state to close state as <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>is</b> removed. <b>The</b> passageway (8) moves from open state to closed state as <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>is</b> inserted and automatically move from closed state to open state as <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>is</b> removed...|$|R

40|$|A Mach-Zehnder Interferometer {{has been}} {{designed}} and constructed for use {{in conjunction with the}} GALCIT Transonic Wind Tunnel. <b>The</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>is</b> to be utilized in making detailed density measurements of supersonic air streams. The design of <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>is</b> such that, contrary to general wind tunnel practice, both light beams of the interferometer traverse the test section of the wind tunnel in an effort to minimize boundary layer corrections. A detailed description of <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>is</b> presented, as well as a “cook-book” adjustment procedure. A discussion of the limitations of <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>is</b> included...|$|R
5|$|The French TOURNESOL {{instrument}} {{consisted of}} four proportional counters and two optical detectors. The proportional counters detected photons between 2keV and 20MeV in a 6° by 6° field of view. The visible detectors {{had a field}} of view of 5° by 5°. <b>The</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>was</b> designed to look for optical counterparts of high-energy burst sources, as well as performing spectral analysis of the high-energy events.|$|E
5|$|The Rhodes Mk III EK-10 was a {{combination}} electric piano and synthesizer instrument, introduced in 1980 before CBS bought ARP Instruments in 1981. It used analog oscillators and filters alongside the existing electromechanical elements. The overall effect {{was that of a}} Rhodes piano and a synthesizer being played simultaneously. <b>The</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>was</b> unreliable with a problematic production, particularly when a shipment of 150 units to Japan caused interference with local television reception. Compared to the new polyphonic synthesizers being marketed at the same time, it was limited in scope and sound, and very few units were sold.|$|E
5|$|After {{unearthing}} {{an ancient}} crossbow device from a house's garden in Haichow, Jiangsu, Shen {{discovered that the}} cross-wire grid sighting device, marked in graduated measurements on the stock, {{could be used to}} calculate the height of a distant mountain {{in the same way that}} mathematicians could apply right-angle triangles to measure height. Needham asserts Shen had discovered the survey device known as Jacob's staff, which was not described elsewhere until the Provençal Jewish mathematician Levi ben Gerson (1288–1344) wrote of it in 1321. Shen wrote that while viewing the whole of a mountain, the distance on <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>was</b> long, but while viewing a small part of the mountainside the distance was short due to the device's cross piece that had to be pushed further away from the observer's eye, with the graduation starting on the further end. He wrote that if one placed an arrow on the device and looked past its end, the degree of the mountain could be measured and thus its height could be calculated.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>is</b> {{minimally}} documented, {{and nearly}} became extinct, {{and thus is}} little known in modern Norwegian folk music. <b>The</b> <b>instrument</b> {{appears to have been}} mainly prevalent in Norway, where at least 160 <b>instrument</b> have <b>been</b> attested, 100 of them photographically. The core areas are Hedmark, eastern Trøndelag and Oppland, and Agder. <b>The</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>is</b> not known outside of Scandinavia, though within that region several variants of <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>are</b> found.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>is</b> {{played as}} a bagpipe {{in the south}} and west of Libya, but played by mouth without a bag in the east. [...] <b>The</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>is</b> played at feasts, weddings, and funerals.|$|R
50|$|The benta {{is a large}} one-string bamboo zither {{native to}} Jamaica. <b>The</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>is</b> an idiochord, in that the string of <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>is</b> made from <b>the</b> same piece of bamboo as composes <b>the</b> body. <b>The</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>is</b> played by two men sitting astride it at either end, one {{striking}} the string and the other changing the pitch of the string by using a gourd like a guitar slide.|$|R
5|$|In 1844, {{an organ}} by Gray & Davison of London was {{installed}} in the cathedral, replacing an instrument with parts dating back to 1626. The organ was rebuilt and enlarged by Whiteley Bros of Chester in 1876, to include harmonic flutes and reeds by Cavaillé-Coll. It was later moved to its present position {{at the front of}} the north transept. In 1910 William Hill and Son of London extensively rebuilt and revoiced the organ, replacing the Cavaillé-Coll reeds with new pipes of their own. The choir division of the organ was enlarged and moved behind the choirstalls on the south side. <b>The</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>was</b> again overhauled by Rushworth and Dreaper of Liverpool in 1969, when a new mechanism and some new pipework made to a design by the organist, Roger Fisher, was installed. Since 1991 the organ has been in the care of David Wells of Liverpool.|$|E
5|$|Jacob's staff: The Song Dynasty (960–1279) {{scholar and}} {{politician}} Shen Kuo (1031–1095), an antiquarian who pursued studies of archaeological finds, unearthed an ancient crossbow-like mechanism from a garden in Jiangsu which had on its stock a graduated sighting scale in minute measurements. He wrote that while viewing {{the whole of}} a mountain, the distance on <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>was</b> long, but while viewing {{a small part of}} the mountainside the distance was short due to the device's cross piece that had to be pushed further away from the observer's eye, with the graduation starting on the further end. He wrote that if one placed an arrow on the device and looked past its end, the degree of the mountain could be measured and thus its height could be calculated. Shen wrote that this was similar to mathematicians who used right-angled triangles to measure height. Joseph Needham writes that what Shen had discovered was Jacob's staff, a surveying tool which was not known in Europe until the medieval French Jewish mathematician Levi ben Gerson (1288–1344) described it in 1321.|$|E
5|$|Many of Sorabji's {{works are}} {{written for the}} piano or have an {{important}} piano part. His writing for <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>was</b> influenced by that of composers such as Liszt, Alkan and Godowsky, {{and he has been}} described as a composer-pianist in their tradition, partly because he was one of the 20th century's most prolific piano composers. It exhibits particularly the influence of Godowsky, specifically in its polyphony and its use of polyrhythms and polydynamics. This necessitated the regular use of systems of more than two staves in Sorabji's keyboard parts, reaching its peak on page 124 of the manuscript of his Third Organ Symphony (1949–53), which uses 11 staves, as well as frequent calls for use of the sostenuto pedal.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>is</b> {{straightforward}} to complete, has an easy scoring algorithm (addition of the responses), {{and has two}} simple interpretation methods (i.e. {{severity categories}} and gender and age specific percentiles). Given this, the objectivity of <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>is</b> supposed to be high.|$|R
5000|$|The {{strength}} of <b>the</b> <b>instruments</b> can <b>be</b> directly assessed because both the endogenous covariates and <b>the</b> <b>instruments</b> <b>are</b> observable. [...] A common {{rule of thumb}} for models with one endogenous regressor is: the F-statistic against the null that <b>the</b> excluded <b>instruments</b> <b>are</b> irrelevant in <b>the</b> first-stage regression should be larger than 10.|$|R
50|$|Once {{the tripod}} is {{positioned}} and secure, <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>is</b> placed on <b>the</b> head. The mounting screw is pushed up under <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> to engage <b>the</b> <b>instrument's</b> base and screwed tight when <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>is</b> in <b>the</b> correct position. The flat {{surface of the}} tripod head is called the foot plate and is used to support the adjustable feet of <b>the</b> <b>instrument.</b>|$|R
5|$|On {{leaving the}} Conservatoire in 1853, Saint-Saëns {{accepted}} {{the post of}} organist at the ancient Parisian church of Saint-Merri near the Hôtel de Ville. The parish was substantial, with 26,000 parishioners; in a typical year {{there were more than}} two hundred weddings, the organist's fees from which, together with fees for funerals and his modest basic stipend, gave Saint-Saëns a comfortable income. The organ, the work of François-Henri Clicquot, had been badly damaged {{in the aftermath of the}} French Revolution and imperfectly restored. <b>The</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>was</b> adequate for church services but not for the ambitious recitals that many high-profile Parisian churches offered. With enough spare time to pursue his career as a pianist and composer, Saint-Saëns composed what became his opus 2, the Symphony in E (1853). This work, with military fanfares and augmented brass and percussion sections, caught the mood of the times in the wake of the popular rise to power of Napoleon III and the restoration of the French Empire. The work brought the composer another first prize from the Société Sainte-Cécile.|$|E
5|$|The two-octave {{diatonic}} accordion (gorodo), popular across Madagascar, {{is believed}} to have been imported by French colonists after 1896. In the 20th century, <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>was</b> commonly performed during tromba spirit possession ceremonies in a style called renitra. In the 1970s, the renitra was incorporated for the performance of electrified salegy music. This accordion style was also integrated into the performance of tsapika, while also inspiring the style used by the guitarists in these bands. Although today the sound of the accordion is most often replicated by a synthesizer in salegy or tsapika bands due to the expense and rarity of the instrument, accordions continue to hold a privileged place in the performance of tromba ceremonial music. Artists like half-brothers Lego and Rossy have gained success as accordion players. Régis Gizavo brought the contemporary style of renitra to the world music scene, winning several international awards for his accordion performance.|$|E
