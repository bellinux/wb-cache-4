40|$|The article {{addresses}} in {{a complex}} way the problem of cooperation between <b>the</b> <b>on-board</b> electric power sources of an aircraft with its <b>on-board</b> electric network. <b>The</b> authors paid special attention to conditions related to correct switching of <b>the</b> <b>on-board</b> electric power sources. Structural protection of the electric power sources against harmful impact of loads, and of the loads against incorrectly operating sources, as well as certain methods to counteract such phenomena, are discussed.

Their correct operation determines correct operation of <b>the</b> <b>on-board</b> electrical power network.
