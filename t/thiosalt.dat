30|$|Sulfur and sulfur-oxygen {{species are}} highly reactive, and speciation, decomposition, and {{oxidation}} of these compounds will occur. This makes {{the chemistry of}} such solutions quite complex and, therefore, difficult to accurately analyze (Moses et al. 1984; Takano and Watanuki 1998; Safizadeh and Larachi 2014). Chemical techniques such as titration, gravimetric analysis, and colorimetric techniques {{have been used for}} the analysis of <b>thiosalts</b> including, thiosulfate, trithionate, tetrathionate, and pentathionate either individually or in a mixture (Miranda-Trevino et al. 2013; O’Reilly et al. 2001). Thiosulfate can be determined by titrimetric methods where iodine or iodate is usually used as the titrant (Ciesielski et al. 2001) and in mixtures with other sulfur species such as sulfide and sulfite using formaldehyde to mask sulfite (Harris 2010). Total <b>thiosalts</b> have been determined by acidimetric titration carried out at the methyl orange or at the phenolphthalein end-point (Makhija and Hitchen 1978). The method has been described to distinguish between non-oxidizable sulfate and the oxidizable <b>thiosalts.</b> Samples containing as low as 0.1  mg of <b>thiosalts</b> can be analyzed easily and accurately.|$|R

However, {{it is clear}} from the discussion above that the type of sulfur compound can vary significantly within the reservoir and topsides processing facilities depending on the temperature, pressure, and pH. These same compounds can act as growth promoters or inhibitors of bacterial growth and corrosion. Therefore, a more complete understanding of how sulfur partitions and chemically reacts is required to better manage reservoir souring and topsides damage/safety concerns.|$|R
40|$|Polysulfides of {{the general}} form ⁻SSπS⁻ occur {{naturally}} in sulfur rich waters and can be formed by the reaction of sulfide with elemental sulfur to yield water soluble polysulfides.

Polysulfides are unstable and readily undergo changes in speciation, analysis is challenging and complicated by lack of standards. A series of polysulfides were synthesized to be used as standards. They were stabilized by methylation to form dimethylpolysulfanes and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with UV detection, and matrix assisted laser desorption MS (MALDI-MS). The various dimethylpolysulfanes were fractionated using semi-preparatory HPLC; the fractions containing individual dimethylpolysulfanes were analyzed for sulfur content by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrophotometry (ICP-OES).

40|$|The {{presence}} of thiosalts in mining wastewaters is an environmental issue {{due to the}} resulting pH depression as these species degrade with time. Despite research in the area, reaction kinetics of <b>thiosalt</b> species under different pH and temperature conditions are not fully understood, especially in conditions common in receiving ponds. As a result, {{it is difficult to}} design ponds or develop treatment technologies to treat these compounds. Several studies have dealt with the reaction kinetics of major <b>thiosalt</b> species (thiosulfate, trithionate, tetrathionate) under various pH and temperature conditions. However, further research is required to better understand the fundamental behaviors of <b>thiosalt</b> species and identify probable reaction paths in temperatures below 30 °C, pH range between 2 and 9 and in the {{presence of}} reagents. [...] The overall objectives of this work have been to study the behavior of thiosalts in mining wastewaters and develop a model of their behavior under the conditions studied that includes pH and temperature as independent variables. The study is divided in four parts: the first part is a summary of relevant information in terms of generation and kinetics of thiosalts, analytical methods for measuring their concentrations, and treatment of <b>thiosalt</b> wastes. Despite extensive research in the area, generation and kinetic information of <b>thiosalt</b> species under different pH and temperature conditions is not fully understood, especially under the range of conditions likely to be encountered in receiving ponds. [...] The second part of the study analyzes the behavior of thiosulfate, trithionate and tetrathionate and provides with mathematical models for their behavior as pure species under the specified conditions. The third part of the study consists of the analysis of the <b>thiosalt</b> behavior in mixtures following a decoupling approach; this analysis provided with additional information for the proposal of global reaction pathways for the species. Finally, the last chapter provides preliminary results from kinetic experiments with selected reagents, results from equilibrium simulations and an analysis of future work required to improve the understanding of <b>thiosalt</b> reactions, improve treatment efficiency and reduce the environmental impact of acid mine drainage...|$|E

40|$|<b>Thiosalt</b> {{species are}} unstable, {{partially}} oxidized sulfur oxyanions formed in sulfur-rich environments but also during the flotation and milling of sulfidic minerals especially those containing pyrite (FeS₂) and pyrrhotite (Fe₍₁₋ₓ₎S, x = 0 to 0. 2). Detecting and quantifying the major <b>thiosalt</b> {{species such as}} sulfate (SO₄²⁻), thiosulfate (S₂O₃²⁻), trithionate (S₃O₆²⁻), tetrathionate (S₄O₆²⁻) and higher polythionates (SₓO₆²⁻, where 3 ≤ x ≤ 10) in the milling process and in the treated tailings {{is important to understand}} how thiosalts are generated and provides insight into potential treatment. As these species are unstable, a fast and reliable analytical technique is required for their analysis. Three capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) methods using indirect UV-vis detection were developed for the simultaneous separation and determination of five <b>thiosalt</b> anions: SO₄²⁻, S₂O₃²⁻, S₃O₆²⁻, S₄O₆²⁻ and S₅O₆²⁻. Both univariate and multivariate experimental design approaches were used to optimize the most critical factors (background electrolyte (BGE) and instrumental conditions) to achieve fast separation and quantitative analysis of the <b>thiosalt</b> species. The mathematically predicted responses for the multivariate experiments were in good agreement with the experimental results. Limits of detection (LODs) (S/N = 3) for the methods were between 0. 09 and 0. 34 μg/mL without a sample stacking technique and nearly four-fold increase in LODs with the application of field-amplified sample stacking. As direct analysis of thiosalts by mass spectrometry (MS) is limited by their low m/z values and detection in negative mode electrospray ionization (ESI), which is typically less sensitive than positive ESI, imidazolium-based (IP-L-Imid and IP-T-Imid) and phosphonium-based (IP-T-Phos) tricationic ion-pairing reagents were used to form stable high mass ions non-covalent + 1 ion-pairs with these species for ESI-MS analysis and the association constants (Kassoc) determined for these ion-pairs. Kassoc values were between 6. 85 × 10 ² M⁻¹ and 3. 56 × 10 ⁵ M⁻¹ with the linear IP-L-Imid; 1. 89 × 10 ³ M⁻¹ and 1. 05 × 10 ⁵ M⁻¹ with the trigonal IP-T-Imid ion-pairs; and 7. 51 × 10 ² M⁻¹ and 4. 91 × 10 ⁴ M⁻¹ with the trigonal IP-T-Phos ion-pairs.

Unsupported Ni/MoS 2 and Ni/WS 2 HDS {{catalysts}} {{were prepared}} by in situ activation of hexamethylenediammonium thiometallates promoted with Ni. The method involved an aqueous solution reaction of ammonium thiomolybdate (ATM) or ammonium thiotungstate (ATT) with Ni(NO 3) (2) center dot 6 H(2) O and hexamethylenediamine. Ni-promoted precursors were then in situ activated during the hydrodesulfurization (HDS) of dibenzothiophene (DBT) producing Ni/MoS 2 and Ni/WS 2 catalysts. Solids were analyzed after the in situ activation by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and for textural properties {{by using the}} BET and BJH methods. Catalysts with relatively high surface area and type IV N- 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were obtained. The use of the hexamethylenediammonium precursor led to a significant nickel promotion of MoS 2 and WS 2 catalysts.

For Ni/WS 2, compared to tetraalkylammonium <b>thiosalts,</b> the lower amount of carbon in excess formed during the decomposition of the hexamethylenediammonium precursor coupled with a lower crystallization rate of WS 2 favors a correct nickel accommodation on the WS 2 edges...|$|R
30|$|Intermediate sulfur {{species in}} {{produced}} fluids {{indicate that there}} are microbial and chemical reactions occurring as the reservoir fluids flow from injection to production wells. The reactivity of these compounds is complex and depends upon temperature, pH, {{as well as the}} presence of other sulfur species, metals, and microorganisms. The possible origins of these compounds have been studied under different temperature and pH conditions (Takano et al. 1994; Zhang and Millero 1993; Chen and Morris 1972; Xu et al. 2000; Gieg et al. 2011; Orphan et al. 2000; Tang et al. 2009; Muyzer and Stams 2008; Barrett and Clark 1987; Moura et al. 1997; Dalsgaard and Bak 1994). The incomplete redox reactions involving H 2 S, sulfur dioxide, or sulfate are likely causes of the generation of sulfur oxyanions. Partial reoxidation of H 2 S to sulfur may occur in low-temperature aerobic environments, where molecular oxygen presents, and in high-temperature anaerobic environments, excess sulfate acts as the oxidant. Intermediate sulfur species can also be reduced to sulfide due to the SRB activity. Some sulfate reducers can reduce sulfur compounds such as <b>thiosalts,</b> sulfite, and sulfur (Muyzer and Stams 2008; Barrett and Clark 1987; Moura et al. 1997; Dalsgaard and Bak 1994). Thermophilic sulfur reducers and thiosulfate reducers have been isolated from produced water at temperatures ranging from 60 to 90  °C (Gieg et al. 2011; Orphan et al. 2000). A mesophilic SRB has been detected in oil fields at temperature of 30  °C and pH 7, and reduced sulfate, sulfite, and thiosulfate in the presence of lactate (Gieg et al. 2011).|$|R
30|$|The {{injection}} of sulfate-containing seawater {{for maintaining the}} pressure of oil reservoirs can promote the growth of sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) and archaea near the injection wells, leading to the reduction of sulfate to sulfide (Holubnyak et al. 2011; Khatib and Salanitro 1997; Stemler 2012; Voordouw et al. 2007; Kaster et al. 2007; Machel 2001; Hubert 2010). Subsequent biologically and chemically mediated reactions result {{in the formation of}} elemental sulfur as well as other reduced sulfur compounds. The analysis of produced water samples has shown the presence of other sulfur species such as <b>thiosalts,</b> sulfite, and polysulfides along with sulfide (Witter and Jones 1998; Boulegue et al. 1981). The average oxidation state of these sulfur species is between that of sulfate-sulfur (+[*] 6) and sulfidic-sulfur (−[*] 2), and therefore, they are usually referred to as intermediate sulfur species (Fig.  1). These intermediate sulfur species have implications in both chemical and microbial processes and could impact the treatment approaches for soured reservoirs (Hissner et al. 1999; O’Reilly et al. 2001; Tang et al. 2009; Warren et al. 2008; Reid and Warren 2016). The reduced forms of sulfur appear in various oxidation–reduction (redox) reactions and can react with each other in the aqueous solution influencing the souring/scaling process. The level and types of sulfur species (i.e., sulfur speciation) is a function of reservoir temperature, pressure, pH, and composition, therefore, as conditions change within flowlines and unit operations, these compounds could degrade to corrosion causing and health and safety problematic compounds, and impact effectiveness of the produced water and other treatment systems (Miranda-Trevino et al. 2013; Miranda-Trevino 2013; Witter and Jones 1998). The distribution of sulfur compounds is also important to determine souring mitigation measures to either prevent the formation of sulfide or lowering the amount of sulfide already presents.|$|R
40|$|Thiosalts are sulphur {{compounds}} {{generated in the}} processing of sulphide ores, which concentrate in the mining wastewater. The most common <b>thiosalt</b> species are thiosulphate, trithionate, and tetrathionate. While thiosalts are not typically toxic, thiosalts can decompose resulting in pH depression. Current industry practice of periodic checking of the water quality downstream, to assess aquatic risk clearly points {{to the lack of}} a comprehensive risk based approach in managing thiosalts. Assessing the aquatic risk to organisms requires predicting <b>thiosalt</b> natural degradation in pond/stream conditions and toxicity data of <b>thiosalt</b> species. Due to the complex reaction pathways and pH dependence of the various <b>thiosalt</b> degradation reactions, assessing the risk to the environment is challenging. A novel methodology is developed for an aquatic community ‘No Observed Effect Concentration’ (NOEC) based on the limited toxicity data that is available for thiosalts. To analyze the indirect effect of thiosalts on pH, a new exposure model is developed to estimate the residual concentration of thiosalts and pH in the water body. The developed exposure assessment model is based on the understanding of the relationship between acid producing (oxidation) and acid consuming (disproportionation) pathways of thiosalts and their reaction kinetics. The results from this model are incorporated into the thiosalts risk assessment and a case study is used to illustrate the model. In this study, the exposure model predicts that trithionate and tetrathionate will degrade to sulphate ions, hydrogen sulphite ions, sulphite ions and elemental sulfur. The concentration of thiosulfate, trithionate and tetrathionate, initially at 25 mg/L, 40 mg/L and 6 mg/L respectively, decreased {{over the course of the}} study. Over the duration of 77 hours, thiosulfate degraded completely, while the estimated residual trithionate and tetrathionate concentrations were 13 mg/L and 5. 77 mg/L, respectively. The pH of the undiluted effluent was estimated to decrease from pH 9. 2 to pH 5. 6 within an hour of the effluent discharge and decreased further to pH 4 over a period of the next 3 days.

These results indicate that both basal and edge planes of the layered sulfides are rearranged by the exfoliation treatment, but that other processes must also be involved.

40|$|In this study, {{we report}} a facile {{approach}} to prepare dense arrays of MoS 2 nanoribbons by combining procedures of micromolding in capillaries (MIMIC) and thermolysis of <b>thiosalts</b> ((NH 4) 2 MoS 4) as the printing ink. The obtained MoS 2 nanoribbons had a thickness reaching {{as low as}} 3. 9 nm, a width ranging from 157 to 465 nm, and a length up to 2 cm. MoS 2 nanoribbons with an extremely high aspect ratio (length/width) of ∼ 7. 4 × 108 were achieved. The MoS 2 pattern can be printed on versatile substrates, such as SiO 2 /Si, sapphire, Au film, FTO/glass, and graphene-coated glass. The degree of crystallinity of the as-prepared MoS 2 was discovered to be adjustable by varying the temperature through postannealing. The high-temperature thermolysis (1000 °C) results in high-quality conductive samples, and field-effect transistors based on the patterned MoS 2 nanoribbons were demonstrated and characterized, where the carrier mobility was {{comparable to that of}} thin-film MoS 2. In contrast, the low-temperature-treated samples (170 °C) result in a unique nanocrystalline MoSx structure (x ≈ 2. 5), where the abundant and exposed edge sites were obtained from highly dense arrays of nanoribbon structures by this MIMIC patterning method. The patterned MoSx was revealed to have superior electrocatalytic efficiency (an overpotential of ∼ 211 mV at 10 mA/cm 2 and a Tafel slope of 43 mV/dec) in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) when compared to the thin-film MoS 2.

40|$|Process water {{discharged}} from mine sites may contain elevated concentrations of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), which both are nutrients for phytoplankton and macrophytes. Thus, discharge of nutrient rich mine water {{can result in}} algal blooms, eutrophication, oxygen deficiency and changed species composition in the recipients. This thesis {{is focused on the}} speciation and transformation processes of N and P in streams and lakes receiving mine effluents from the Kiruna and Boliden mine sites. The thesis also aimed at evaluating N removal capacity of these aquatic systems. Research methods in the thesis included collection of field data, laboratory and field experiments and computer simulations. The question of limiting nutrient for production of phytoplankton and macrophytes in these mine water recipients was investigated. For this reason, total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP) and TN:TP ratios in water, sediment and macrophytes were analysed and evaluated. Depending on the ammonium concentration in the effluent at the Boliden site, TN:TP-ratios of the water column shifted from being > 22, indicating P-deficiency for phytoplankton, to between 9 - 22, indicating a transition from N to P deficiency (co-limitation). However, water column TN:TP ratios at the Kiruna site always indicated P deficiency. On the other hand, the TN:TP ratios of macrophytes revealed that both sites may vary from N to P limitation. These aspects have implications for assessing the environmental influence of nutrient-rich mine effluents. A downstream decrease in inorganic N (NH 4 + and NO 3 -) as well as lower concentrations during summer was observed in the receiving streams and lakes. To identify and quantify the major N transformation and removal processes responsible for these changes, a dynamic biogeochemical model was developed, calibrated and validated using hydrological and water chemistry data for the clarification pond Nya Sjön (Boliden). The model calculates concentrations of six N species and simulates the rate of 16 N transformation processes occurring in the water column and sediment as well as water-sediment and water-atmosphere interactions. The calibrated model rendered coefficients of determination (R 2) of 0. 93, 0. 79 and 0. 86 for the inorganic nitrogen species ammonium, nitrate and organic nitrogen, respectively. When applying the model in the downstream Lake Bruträsket, the corresponding R 2 values were 0. 86, 0. 76 and 0. 54. Model simulations in the two systems suggested that nitrification controlled the reaction rate of the coupled nitrification-denitrification process and that approximately 60 – 65 % of permanent removal occurred though denitrification, followed by burial in the sediment (~ 30 - 35 %) (May - October). A stable nitrogen isotope (15 N) was employed to trace N cycling in the various plant parts of common reed (P. australis) growing in the littoral zone of Lake Bruträsket. Isotope enrichment data indicated a significantly more effective assimilation of N in the roots. Maximum tracer uptake rates of 0. 25 µg g- 1 min- 1 (NO 3 -) and 1. 4 µg g- 1 min- 1 (NH 4 +) are similar to model simulated rates of macrophyte N uptake. Simulation results and results from the tracer study indicated that direct N removal through N uptake in macrophytes and phytoplankton may be of minor importance relative to nitrification and denitrification. A sediment incubation experiment using lake water and sediment from Lake Bruträsket (Boliden) resulted in a sedimentary flux of soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) of 1. 1 mg SRP m- 2 d- 1. Field measurements suggested that oxidation of organic matter and inorganic mining related chemicals (e. g. NH 4 + and <b>thiosalts)</b> may result in increased internal SRP flux. These findings point to a possible interaction between the cycles of N (oxygen consumption) and P (flux from sediment) that may be important for nutrient regulation in mine water recipients. Sediment proxy data (δ 13 C, δ 15 N, C/N ratios) was used to reconstruct historical changes in organic matter (OM) accumulation in lakes receiving nutrient-rich mine waters in the Boliden and Kiruna mine sites. Sediment accumulation rates increased upwards in all cores, which correlates with an increase in suspended load in the mining effluents discharging to the systems. Similarδ 15 N values in dissolved inorganic N (DIN) and surface sediments most likely reflect biological assimilation of DIN and subsequent settling of phytoplankton and macrophyte organic detritus. The improved knowledge on N and P dynamics in mine water recipients can be used in selection of mine water management strategies that may lead to reduced N discharge.

More insights into the nanocomposite structure were provided by introducing the concept of average curvature of Mo(W) S 2 and establishing a new structure model. The defects of cross and mixed stacks, steps along c-axis, expansion of (002) interplanar spacing and mixing structure of Mo(W) /Ni sulfides were investigated using advanced electron microscopy. All these defects in Mo(W) sulfides are closely correlated with increasing active sites of unsupported Ni-Mo-W sulfide catalyst...|$|E
30|$|<b>Thiosalt</b> {{species have}} also been {{analyzed}} using spectroscopic analyses such as infra-red (IR) and ultraviolet (UV) (Bandekar et al. 1995; Rozan et al. 2000). The detection limits of these methods are typically in the range 10 − 4 to 10 − 2 M which are {{higher than those of}} other instruments. Thiosalts have relatively strong UV absorbance and, therefore, more selective direct detection at 214  nm is used (Padarauskas et al. 2000). Thiosulfate, trithionate, tetrathionate, and pentathionate have been detected using indirect UV–Vis detection (Pappoe and Bottaro 2014). Fully ionized pyromellitate ion (PMA) with a high molar absorptivity was used as the chromophoric probe. The method was rapid, sensitive, and selective with limits of detection between 0.02 and 0.12  µg/ml. Total dissolved sulfide in natural waters has also been determined using direct ultraviolet detection of bisulfide ion (Guenther et al. 2001).|$|E
40|$|Hydrodesulfurization (HDS) {{catalysts}} {{supported on}} SBA- 15 (6 and 9 nm) were prepared by thermal decomposition of (alkyl) ammonium thiomolybdate and ammonium thiotungstate using Co(Ni) acetate or Co(Ni) thiocarbamate (cobalt dimethyldithiocarbamate and nickel diethyldithiocarbamate) as the promoter atom sources. Prior to the catalytic test, the activations of the catalysts {{were carried out}} either under H 2 /N 2 gas flow at 773 K (ex-situ activation) or during the catalytic tests (in-situ activation). The nature of the <b>thiosalt</b> precursor, the impregnation method {{as well as the}} activation mode show a strong influence on the MoS 2 morphology, which is of great importance for the HDS catalytic activity. Despite the high MoS 2 stacking, the ex-situ activated catalysts derived from ammonium thiomolybdate (ATM) at high Mo-loading exhibit higher HDS activity compared to a commercial-Al 2 O 3 -supported HDS catalyst. One important result of the studies is that the MoS 2 stacking is not a prerequisite for a good HDS performance and also not a sign for the deactivation or lower HDS activity. The presence of large amounts of coordinatively unsaturated sites (CUS) could be responsible for the high HDS activity. The experiments clearly show that the ex-situ activation is not beneficial for the preparation of HDS active phases when a carbon-containing Mo source like tetramethyl-ammonium thiomolybdate (TMATM) is employed. During the activation process MoS 2 particles with an unfavorable morphology are generated and big needle-like aggregates and closed shell structures are seen in the HRTEM pictures. The in-situ activation is found to be beneficial for the preparation of NiMo/SBA- 15 catalysts with high activity. For CoMo/SBA- 15 catalysts, the in-situ activation also results in an enhanced synergetic effect of Co by using TMATM. In this case, the improved HDS performance could be associated with the positive carbon effect. In contrast, the nature of the <b>thiosalt</b> precursor and the activation mode have only a negligible influence on the catalytic selectivity. MoO 3 supported on SBA- 15 was prepared by impregnation of SBA- 15 with ammonium heptamolybdate followed by calcination at 773 K for 3 h in air. Interestingly, the presence of the hexagonal MoO 3 modification was unequivocally identified by evaluation of the EXAFS data. In addition, the catalytic behavior of the hex-MoO 3 /SBA- 15 in the propene oxidation reaction was investigated in the temperature range from 293 K to 773 K. The stabilized hex-MoO 3 -SBA- 15 is shown to be capable of directly oxidizing propene to acrylic acid without the addition of further metal atoms as promoters. Intriguingly, the stabilized structure of hexagonal MoO 3 supported on SBA- 15 possesses an open channel structure {{similar to that of the}} highly active Mo 5 O 14 or MoVNbTe catalysts. Hence, structural complexity of molybdenum oxides is sufficient to improve functional molybdenum sites for the activation of oxygen and alkene followed by selective oxidation of the alkene. keine dt. -spr.

40|$|During {{mining and}} milling of sulphude-rich ores, {{sulphide}} is inherently generating intermediary sulphur compounds, collectively known as thiosalts. These partly oxidized sulphur species composes {{a threat to}} effective mine waste water treatment systems due to their natural oxidizing capability to eventually produce sulphuric acid. The acid can reduce the overall alkalinity within the treatment system and/or in recipients of nearby local aquatic systems. Mine corporations {{are in the process}} of identifying effective treatment systems with the potential to reduce late acidification specifically. Since their operations are affecting local environments, the acidification issue has attracted its attention to media and governmental organizations. In a case of 2007 at Boliden Mineral AB, it was estimated that 840 tonnes of potential sulphuric acid was released from the Gillervattnet tailings dam, and had cause late acidification in local aquatic systems near the Boliden Concentrator (where sulphur-rich ore is processed). Investigations concluded that thiosalts were able to continue oxidize even after its treatment process and hence, generate additional acidity in the effluent. As Boliden is in progress of commissioning its new tailings dam, Hötjärnsmagasinet, it is of great concern that an effective water treatment system is applied so that regulated standards are fulfilled in the final effluent. This study has investigated the chemical treatment process at Boliden Mineral AB, in which applies Fenton reagents of hydrogen peroxide and ferrous sulphate to oxidize thiosalts into stable sulphate. Another investigation was made on the microbial treatment that oxidizes thiosalts by means of bacteria. A “best-case scenario” of a potential <b>thiosalt</b> generation by adjusting alkalinity at discharge point at the Boliden Concentrator was set up by statistical tools. Today, the ore is normally monitored at about pH 12 at discharge point. Alkalinity in the process waters is necessarily reduced to pH 8 - 9 before the Fenton, which causes an alkalinity drop in the tailings pond. However, if alkalinity was reduced at discharge point, the overall <b>thiosalt</b> generation would possibly be reduced as well. A split-plot experimental design was conducted to investigate whether the salt production would decrease with lower alkalinity. One “hard-to-change” factor, temperature, and two “easy-to-change” factors, pH and pulp concentration, were used in the design. The split-plot experiment concluded that the alkalinity, or pH, and the interaction effect between pH and temperature had a significant effect on the hydrogen consumption logOH delta. The forecast provided two estimated linear models, one forecasting the theoretical amount of thiosalts, and one forecasting the measured amount by means of defining a pOH delta drop. These linear models became the major finding of this study. The models were able to conclude the overall reagents and energy costs for chemical and microbial treatment at the Boliden plant. According to results, Boliden Mineral AB would save approximately 36 MESK annually by reducing alkalinity to approximately two pH units (from pH 11. 3 to pH 9). In case a microbial treatment process was installed, the costs difference to Fenton with same delta drop would reduce operative costs to about 27 MSEK annually.  Validerat; 20111028 (anonymous...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} temperature, initial pH, and the {{concentrations}} of ammonium, phosphate, and heavy metals on the oxidation of thiosalts by an authentic strain of Thiobacillus thiooxidans (ATCC 8085) and by a mixed culture isolated from a base metal-processing mill effluent pond were studied. The optimum temperature was 30 °C and the optimum initial pH was 3. 75 for both cultures using thiosulfate and for the mixed culture using tetrathionate. T. thiooxidans ATCC 8085 did not oxidize tetrathionate. For a <b>thiosalt</b> concentration of 2, 000 ppm (2, 000 mg/liter), maximal rates of destruction occurred at concentrations of ammonium ion above 2 mg/liter and {{in the presence of}} 1 mg of phosphate per liter. Under optimal conditions, the rate of thiosulfate oxidation by the pure culture was 55 ± 3 mg/liter per h; the mixed culture oxidized thiosulfate at the rate of 40 ± 1 mg/liter per h and tetrathionate at the rate of 50 ± 2 mg/liter per h. Metal ions caused normal inhibition kinetics in the oxidation of thiosulfate by T. thiooxidans ATCC 8085. Ki values were calculated for cadmium (16 mg/liter), copper (0. 46 mg/liter), lead (2 mg/liter), silver (3. 1 mg/liter), and zinc (33 mg/liter). Only a slight additive effect was apparent in the presence of all of these metal ions. The mixed culture of thiosalt-oxidizing bacteria was less sensitive to heavy metal inhibition; the order of inhibition of thiosulfate oxidation was Cd < Zn < Pb < Ag < Cu, and that of tetrathionate oxidation was Zn < Cd < Pb < Ag < Cu...|$|E
30|$|CE can be {{used for}} separation, detection, and {{quantification}} of <b>thiosalt</b> species (Buchberger and Haddad 1992; Corr and Anacleto 1996; Daunoravicius and Padarauskas 2002; Haddad et al. 1999; Padarauskas et al. 2000; Motellier and Descostes 2001; O’Reilly et al. 2003; Saeed 2017). CE is a technique for separation of ions based on their size to charge ratio and an attractive alternative to the traditional methods due to its high separation efficiency, low running costs, tolerances for sample matrices with high ionic strength, and the generation of a low amount of waste (O’Reilly et al. 2001). CE is also a rapid method and minimizes sulfur speciation during separation, making it suitable for the analysis of unstable sulfur-containing species. Separation of sulfide, thiosulfate, sulfite, and sulfate has been generally achieved with co-electric-osmotic flow (EOF) through the addition of an EOF modifier to the background electrolyte (BGE). In this separation mode, sulfide migrates faster than the other ions and thiosulfate has the slowest migration rate. However, increasing the EOF modifier in the BGE reduces sulfide mobility due to the formation of ion-pairs between sulfide and EOF modifier and can change the separation selectivity (Petre and Larachi 2006). Using the anodic oxidation procedure, thiosulfate is completely converted to sulfate, and for this reason, the change in sulfate concentration should also be monitored. Sulfate, however, has no UV absorbance. Indirect UV detection in CE is, therefore, used to detect non-absorbing ions. Due to high UV absorbance, polythionates cannot be detected with indirect CE method and only were sulfate, sulfite, and thiosulfate detected (Padarauskas et al. 2000). In addition, there is a challenge in separating chloride from thiosulfate in saline water samples, implying the necessity of using direct CE method (Saeed 2017).|$|E
