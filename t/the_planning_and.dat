In 1963, the RLA purchased the land from the Westminster Memorial Church, Fifth Baptist Church, and homeowners. The United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare wished to purchase the site for its new headquarters, but the RLA declined to sell the property. (The federal government does not pay taxes on land and structures it owns, and the RLA wanted a private owner who would add to the tax base.) The RLA attempted to sell the land on January 29, 1965, but there were no buyers.|$|E

5000|$|A counterplan must 'compete' with <b>the</b> affirmative <b>plan</b> {{in order}} to be {{considered}} a reason to reject the affirmative. Although competition is a difficult and controversial theoretical concept, it is most often defined as the following: The counterplan must be superior (and not equal) to both <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> <b>and</b> any possible combination of <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> <b>and</b> counterplan. A <b>plan</b> <b>and</b> counterplan that are labelled mutually exclusive are structurally competitive in totality, meaning that <b>the</b> two <b>plan</b> actions are contradictory and could not logically coexist. Tests of competition in terms of potential combinations of <b>plan</b> <b>and</b> counterplan are called permutations, or perms in debate slang. The most common form of permutation and the immediate test of competition is the [...] "Do Both" [...] permutation, testing the total combination of <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> <b>and</b> counterplan in comparison to the counterplan alone.|$|R

5|$|Advanced {{technology}} {{was required for}} <b>the</b> <b>planning</b> <b>and</b> construction of large reservoirs and canals. When constructing reservoirs, the gaps between low ridges in the dry zone plains were used for damming water courses. Two different techniques were used in construction; one method involved making an embankment using natural rock formations across a valley and the other involved diverting water courses through constructed canals to reservoirs. All the reservoirs and canals in an area were interconnected by an intricate network, so that excess water from one will flow into the other. The locations of these constructions indicate that the ancient engineers were aware of geological formations in the sites as well, and made effective use of them. Underground conduits have also been constructed to supply water to and from artificial ponds, {{such as in the}} Kuttam Pokuna and the ponds at Sigiriya.|$|E

40|$|The {{intent of}} this study was to {{describe}} <b>the</b> resource reallocation/retrenchment <b>plans</b> collected from <b>the</b> universities in the Big Eight Conference. ^ The review of related literature included (1) a discussion of advantages and disadvantages that differing types of postsecondary institutions have in coping with decline, (2) traditional management methods used to respond to the problems of decline, and (3) the use of resource reallocation as an alternative response to the problems of decline. ^ The information for this study was gathered from plans sent by administrators of the eight universities, and by a structured telephone interview with the eight participants. ^ Based upon the findings {{of this study}}, it was found: (1) The majority of resource reallocation plans contained primary areas and statements that were contained in a previously developed comparison <b>plan.</b> (2) <b>The</b> majority of <b>plans</b> contained primary <b>and</b> secondary statements of both a general and specific nature. (3) The primary areas were of greater concern than the secondary areas in the related literature and outside resource reallocation <b>plans.</b> (4) <b>The</b> majority of <b>plans</b> <b>and</b> processes were formal. (5) <b>The</b> majority of <b>plans</b> <b>and</b> processes were initiated and developed by officials within the universities. (6) <b>The</b> <b>plans</b> <b>and</b> processes were to assist in establishing academic program priorities. (7) The interviews revealed that it had not been necessary to utilize financial exigency plans at half of the universities. (8) Five of <b>the</b> eight <b>plans</b> <b>and</b> processes were not expected to affect the university budget, but may affect college budgets.
