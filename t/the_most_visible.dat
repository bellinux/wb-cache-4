5|$|Construction {{projects}} such as these constituted only <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>visible</b> part of Domitian's religious policy, which also concerned itself with the fulfilment of religious law and public morals. In 85, he nominated himself perpetual censor, the office that held the task of supervising Roman morals and conduct. Once again, Domitian acquitted himself of this task dutifully, and with care.

5|$|Furthermore, despite {{changes to}} the {{campaign}} finance laws, there was no perceptible decrease in campaigning activity. One reason was a compensatory expansion of advertising by way of internet search engines such as Facebook and other social media which were relatively inexpensive. Helsingin Sanomat called election workers in all electoral districts, excluding the Åland Islands, to ask for their assessments of the electoral campaigns. They reported that while the NCP's campaign was <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>visible,</b> the Centre Party and the Social Democrats also had high-profile campaigns with some variations across districts. The NCP were also said to be spending more {{of their own money}} than in the past.|$|E

His soldiers were known as Caroleans, trained to be skilled and preferring to attack rather than defend. Savaging and looting were strictly forbidden.

5|$|The {{painting}} portrays this scene, although {{as usual}} with Matejko's work, it sacrifices some historical reality for more dramatic presentation.

5|$|On {{the outer}} {{fringes of the}} few small gay {{communities}} were people who challenged gender expectations. They were effeminate men and masculine women, or people assigned male at birth who dressed and lived as women and people assigned female at birth who dressed and lived as men, respectively, either part or full-time. Contemporary nomenclature classified them as transvestites, and they were <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>visible</b> representatives of sexual minorities. They belied the carefully crafted image portrayed by the Mattachine Society and DOB that asserted homosexuals were respectable, normal people. The Mattachine and DOB considered the trials of being arrested for wearing clothing of the opposite gender as a parallel to the struggles of homophile organizations: similar but distinctly separate. Gay and transgender people staged a small riot at the Cooper Do-nuts cafe in Los Angeles in 1959 in response to police harassment.|$|E
