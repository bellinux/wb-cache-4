25|$|Such a {{phenomenon}} was observed, but not photographed, in the Owens Valley of California. Early {{in the morning}} with no wind, thin clouds were observed to form above the valley. The distinction was that they were created alternately and moved in opposite directions away from a central location on the valley floor, suggesting the existence of an inaudible free convection whistle. The reason for including this type of whistle is that we <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> it is necessary for a forced jet flow to encounter a solid material to create a whistle. Perhaps it would be more correct to generalize the concept to a particular impedance mismatch rather than a solid object. The Hartmann whistle and the jet screech fits into this generalization. The concept also applies to any fluid motion as opposed to a strictly forced flow.|$|E

Objective: This study explored differences between the nursing students in Madagascar and Japan. Subjects and Methods: This is a prospective analytical study of 63 nursing students— 32 Japanese and 31 Malagasy. Questionnaires were distributed to students in Madagascar and Japan in 2010 and collected for statistical analysis. Results: Malagasy students <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> nursing plays a psychological role, and they have positive view for this function. In contrast, Japanese students <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> nursing is physical work and they make a point of its outcome and the need for social and economic guarantees. Conclusion: The nursing students in Madagascar and Japan expressed different views and goals. While several factors may be involved in these differences, their distinct medical situations are most likely the major contributor...|$|R

Michael Frede has done much to set these texts in their proper context, but his work has not gotten the appreciation it deserves.

This {{may turn out to be}} correct, but Frede’s interpretation, as I think it should be understood, is more plausible and interesting than is usually thought. Frede has made it possible to see the skeptics in the Clitomachian-Pyrrhonian tradition as taking some of the first steps in working out the philosophical view that epistemic justification is a matter of whether a belief is the sustained outcome of a correct cognitive process and that correctness here need not and perhaps should not be understood in terms of modal reliability...|$|R
40|$|The {{diffusive}} {{motion of}} overdamped Browninan particles in tilted piecewise linear potentials is considered. It is {{shown that the}} enhancement of diffusion coefficient by an external static force is quite sensitive to the symmetry of periodic potential. The factor of randomness {{as a function of}} the tilting force exhibits a plateau-like behaviour in the region of low temperatures. Various aspects of the dynamics and, in particular, diffusion of Brownian particles in external periodic potentials have been a subject of growing interest in the last few years [1]-[3]. In the case of thermal equilibrium, the overdamped force-free thermal diffusion of non-interacting Brownian particles is always reduced when an additional periodic potential is applied to the system [4]. Therefore one <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> a qualitatively similar behaviour is valid at least for some time-independent non-equilibrium systems.
