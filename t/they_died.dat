5|$|A large alcove {{close by}} in the garden, entered through a portal of grey Sussex marble, formed an amphitheatre that {{contained}} an effigy representing Truth crushing a mask, again probably the work of Roubiliac.

5|$|Adapids {{were most}} {{commonly}} found in Europe, although the oldest specimens (Adapoides from middle Eocene China) indicate that they most likely evolved in Asia and immigrated. <b>They</b> <b>died</b> out in Europe during the Grande Coupure, part of a significant extinction event {{at the end of}} the Eocene.|$|E

5|$|Several bestowals of {{the award}} have met with criticism. The posthumous award for M. G.

5|$|Before Tiberius, {{the heirs}} of Augustus were {{the sons of}} Marcus Agrippa, Gaius and Lucius Caesar, whom he adopted and made heir. They {{advanced}} through their careers at the same pace {{and were going to}} rule together; however, <b>they</b> <b>died</b> young, forcing Augustus to draw another line of succession. In AD 4, Augustus adopted Tiberius on condition that Tiberius adopt Germanicus. This made Tiberius the heir of Augustus, and Germanicus the heir of Tiberius. Like the sons of Agrippa, it was the intention of Augustus that Germanicus and Drusus would rule together.|$|E
5|$|Bupropion is {{considered}} moderately dangerous in overdose. For significant overdoses, seizures {{have been reported}} in about a third of all cases; other serious effects include hallucinations, loss of consciousness, and abnormal heart rhythms. When bupropion was one of several kinds of pills taken in an overdose, fever, muscle rigidity, muscle damage, hypertension or hypotension, stupor, coma, and respiratory failure have been reported. While most people recover, some people have died, and before <b>they</b> <b>died</b> suffered multiple uncontrolled seizures and heart attacks.|$|E

The women beg Esther to conceal their condition from Judah so that he may remember them as they were before, so she tells him that <b>they</b> <b>died.</b> This false revelation changes Juda's mind, and he decides to seek vengeance on Messala by competing against him in the chariot race.|$|E
5|$|Many Gobioolithus minor {{specimens}} contain embryonic {{remains of}} the enantiornithine genus Gobipipus. The embryos have well-ossified skeletons, implying that they were at a late stage in development when <b>they</b> <b>died.</b> Their wings and shoulders are especially well-developed. Only the modern megapodes and the little tern exhibit a comparable degree of embryonic ossification in the arm and shoulder bones. It is likely that Gobipipus hatchlings, like megapodes and little terns, {{would be able to}} fly very soon after hatching.|$|E
