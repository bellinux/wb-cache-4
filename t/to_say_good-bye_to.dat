25|$|For {{the last}} few months of his life Leigh Fermor {{suffered}} from a cancerous tumour, and in early June 2011 he underwent a tracheotomy in Greece. As death was close, according to local Greek friends, he expressed a wish to visit England <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>good-bye</b> <b>to</b> his friends, and then return to die in Kardamyli, though it is also stated that he actually wished to die in England and be buried next to his wife.|$|E

Emma tells Hook she loves him, with both ready to take their relationship further. Henry prepares <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>good-bye</b> <b>to</b> Violet, believing she and her father, Sir Morgan, will return to Camelot. However, Violet reveals that while {{she was born in}} Camelot, her father is from Connecticut, but fell into a portal to Camelot at one point; thus they will remain in the Real World. Happy to hear this, Henry shares a kiss with Violet.|$|E

500|$|Madonna has {{performed}} the song only on her 1990 Blond Ambition World Tour, {{where it was}} the closing song of the set list. The staging of the performances {{was inspired by the}} 1971 science fiction film, A Clockwork Orange. The shows featured an introductory verse from [...] "Family Affair" [...] by Sly and the Family Stone. Madonna wore an all-black ensemble involving a cage vest, the longline bra, skintight shorts, knee-pads and a bowler hat. Her getup was a nod to actress Liza Minnelli in the film Cabaret. The performance started with her dancers appearing on the stage, with chairs on their back. Madonna appeared in their middle and started doing push-ups on the stage. She started singing [...] "Family Affair", then midway through the song, changed to [...] "Keep It Together". During the intermediate music, Madonna and her dancers performed an intricate choreography with the chairs. At the end, all the musicians, dancers and collaborators came <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>good-bye</b> <b>to</b> Madonna. The singer was left alone on stage to finish with a powerful repeat of her line [...] "Keep people together forever and ever".|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1750s Elizabeth's health started to decline. She began {{to suffer a}} series of dizzy spells and refused to take the {{prescribed}} medicines. She forbade the word [...] "death" [...] in her presence. Knowing she was dying, Elizabeth used her last remaining strength to make her confession, to recite with her confessor the prayer for the dying and <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>good-bye</b> <b>to</b> those few people who wished {{to be with her}} including Peter and Catherine and Counts Alexei and Kirill Razumovsky. Finally on 5 January 1762 the Empress died. She was buried in the Peter and Paul Cathedral in Saint Petersburg on 3 February 1762 after six weeks lying in state.|$|E
2500|$|Gordon {{had fallen}} in love with Jane Bridges, a girl, aged 17 who was able to tell the story 60 years {{afterwards}} to his biographers. Gordon did not declare his love until he came <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>good-bye</b> <b>to</b> her before leaving for Australia on 7 August 1853. [...] "With characteristic recklessness he offered to sacrifice the passage he had taken to Australia, and all his father's plans for giving him a fresh start in life, if she would tell him not to go, or promise to be his wife, or even give him some hope." [...] This she could not do, though she liked the shy handsome boy and remembered him with affection to the end of a long life. It was the one romance of Gordon's life.|$|E

Officer Luciana's final harpoon pierces the books, destroying and scattering many of the pages, as the hot-air mobile home heads towards the horizon.|$|R
60|$|She {{could give}} me no {{explanation}} whatever of her sudden dismissal. Sir Percival had ordered {{that she should have}} a month's wages, in place of a month's warning, and go.

Kilroy stopped at the steps of a house on Álvaro Obregón <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>good-bye</b> <b>to</b> the girl from Miss Tanline. He then waited for Bill to walk towards him. Bill then ran to a nearby alley to urinate while Kilroy waited for him. By the time Bill came out and caught up {{to the other two}} near García's, Kilroy had vanished. [...] "Hey, Mark, stop fucking around", Bill said, but Kilroy was nowhere to be found. His friends searched for him for hours, even after the establishments had closed and the streets had cleared at around 4:30a.m. CT. They then crossed the border thinking Kilroy may have crossed to Brownsville and was perhaps waiting near their parked car. His friends did not find him near their car and waited a few minutes in Brownsville before heading to South Padre Island. They thought that Kilroy probably left to the hotel with someone else. They woke up the next day at the hotel and Kilroy's whereabouts were still unknown. His friends then contacted the police to report him missing.|$|E
2500|$|The Sacrifice is {{the story}} of Gilthas, the weak son of Tanis Half-Elven and Laurana. [...] It begins with two elves meeting with Dalamar the Dark, a black-robed mage, gaining his help to trap Gilthas in Qualinesti that he might become a puppet ruler of the elves. [...] The scene goes to Gilthas, the {{protected}} and weak youth, who is rebellious against his parents. [...] He receives a letter from a Qualinesti Senator, Rashas, to meet him in an inn, and Gilthas runs off to do so. Tanis goes after him and discovers signs that make him believe that Gilthas was ambushed, though it is in fact not true. [...] Dalamar appears to him and Tanis is knocked out. [...] Gilthas's fate is revealed; he was met by Rashas, who rode a griffin, and taken to Qualinost, capital of the elves. [...] There, he is taken to a room where the elven Queen Alhana Starbreeze resides against her will. [...] Rashas goes to make preparation for Gilthas's coronation, and Gilthas is forced to stay in the city. [...] Dalamar reveals to Tanis that Gilthas is to be made king of the Qualinesti, and they begin to make plans. [...] Gilthas is told he will be crowned the next day. [...] Dalamar reveals to Tanis that what has transpired has destroyed the chance for a massive alliance as was planned, thanks to Rashas. [...] Alhana's servant Samar comes to rescue them, but Rashas arrives in time to stop it. [...] Samar is arrested, and Gilthas and Alhana are separated. [...] Gilthas tells Rashas he will not swear the oath to become King, but Rashas threatens to kill Alhana if he doesn't; Gilthas agrees. [...] Tanis and Dalamar, aided by magic, go to try to stop the coronation, and when Tanis commands Gilthas to take off the medallion that allows him to be King, Gilthas refuses and swears to become Speaker. [...] Dalamar and Tanis rescue Alhana, and after Dalamar escapes the pair of them are exiled from Qualinesti. [...] Tanis is sent to the border where he meets Dalamar and discovers Alhana has already gone on with Samar. [...] Gilthas appears <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>good-bye</b> <b>to</b> his father, and after he does so returns to Qualinesti. [...] Tanis and Dalamar then depart.|$|E

She later recalled, [...] "I can look back to one period of my life when I {{scarcely}} knew whether the sun rose or the sun set; when for days {{there seemed to be}} no one in the world but myself."

[...] He decided to stay in England and pursued a career in research, clinical ophthalmology and teaching. After spending one year as a Senior House Officer at Birmingham & Midland Eye Hospital, Hayreh returned to the Institute of Ophthalmology, University of London, in 1965, this time as Lecturer in Clinical Ophthalmology. His research at this time dealt mostly with the in vivo blood supply of the optic nerve head and glaucoma.|$|R

5000|$|However, this is {{cut short}} {{by the death of}} Abraham by Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) in the seventh-season premiere. Due {{to the fact that they}} had to hide the death from Abraham's {{perspective}} in the sixth-season finale, Greg Nicotero had to work around a way for Abraham <b>to</b> <b>say</b> farewell <b>to</b> Sasha in the following episode. Michael suggested a peace sign, which is used between Abraham and Sasha several times in the sixth season. Cudlitz described it further and said, [...] "For those paying attention, the peace sign is something that was between me and Sasha throughout the series. It was an unspoken, very loaded peace sign.

We had already established in the finale of last year that eye contact was not broken. He got knocked down, he came back up.

Did he intend, she asked ironically, to wait for the very eve of the entry into Madrid? Thus by a judicious exercise of tact and asperity we re-established the atmospheric equilibrium of the room long before I left them a little before midnight, now tenderly reconciled, to walk down to the harbour and hail the Tremolino by the usual soft whistle {{from the edge of the}} quay.

We recognize that many of you have been on the site for up to 10 years, and would like to thank you for your support and for allowing us {{to be a part of}} your lives. We hope you are able to take the time to reflect on the people who you may have met through Bolt2 and maintain these friendships after the site is down.Much like pulling off a band-aid, the closure will be short and hopefully not too painful.

Teddy was not nearly so animated as he had been in his pre-khaki days; there was a quiet exaltation in his manner rather than a lively excitement. He knew now what he was in for.
