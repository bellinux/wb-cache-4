5|$|There is a {{scientific}} consensus linking human activities <b>to</b> <b>global</b> <b>warming</b> due to industrial carbon dioxide emissions.

5|$|Key {{says that}} he {{believes}} {{that global warming is}} a real phenomenon, and that the Government needs to implement measures to reduce human contribution <b>to</b> <b>global</b> <b>warming.</b> Key has committed the National Party to working towards reducing greenhouse emissions in New Zealand by 50% within the next fifty years. Commentators note that as recently as 2005, Key made statements indicating that he was sceptical of the effects and impact of climate change.|$|E

5|$|The russet sparrow {{appears to}} be {{abundant}} in most habitats across most of its very large range, and in the some areas it {{is among the most}} common birds. In Southeast Asia, its range has contracted at lower elevations due <b>to</b> <b>global</b> <b>warming,</b> but it has also moved higher at high elevations and it remains common. Although its global population has not been quantified, it is assessed for the IUCN Red List as least concern for global extinction.|$|E
5|$|There are {{concerns}} raised about possible contribution from urban heat islands <b>to</b> <b>global</b> <b>warming.</b> Research on China indicates that urban heat island effect contributes to climate warming by about 30%. On the other hand, one 1999 comparison between {{urban and rural}} areas proposed that the urban heat island effects have little influence on global mean temperature trends. Many studies reveal increases in the severity of the effect with the progress of climate change.|$|E
5|$|Briarcliff College was a women's {{college in}} Briarcliff Manor, New York. The school was founded as Mrs. Dow's School for Girlsin 1903 at the Briarcliff Lodge. After Walter W. Law donated land and a {{building}} for the college, it operated at its location at 235 Elm Road in Briarcliff until 1977; closing due to low enrollment and financial problems. Pace University subsequently operated {{it as part of}} its Pleasantville campus from 1977 to 2015. In an effort to consolidate its campuses, Pace University sold the campus in 2017 to the Research Center on Natural Conservation, a host of conferences relating <b>to</b> <b>global</b> <b>warming</b> and conservation.|$|E

A review of scientific data shows that <b>global</b> <b>warming</b> causes ocean levels to rise and that RMI may need to be evacuated. The current diplomatic efforts <b>to</b> decrease <b>global</b> <b>warming</b> offer few assurances to RMI. In fact, the countries that have obligated themselves <b>to</b> reduce <b>global</b> <b>warming</b> are actually increasing emissions of gases that cause <b>global</b> <b>warming...</b>|$|R

5|$|Environmental {{issues have}} been on the {{national}} agenda since 1970. Environmental controversies include debates on oil and nuclear energy, dealing with air and water pollution, the economic costs of protecting wildlife, logging and deforestation, and international responses <b>to</b> <b>global</b> <b>warming.</b> Many federal and state agencies are involved. The most prominent is the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), created by presidential order in 1970. The idea of wilderness has shaped the management of public lands since 1964, with the Wilderness Act. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 is intended to protect threatened and endangered species and their habitats, which are monitored by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.|$|E
5|$|Other threats include illegal {{collection}} for pet trade, which concerns mainly the southern crested newt, {{and the northern}} crested newt in its eastern range. The possibility of hybridisation, especially in the crested newts, means that native species can be genetically polluted through the introduction of close species, {{as it is the}} case with the Italian crested newt introduced in the range of the northern crested newt. Warmer and wetter winters due <b>to</b> <b>global</b> <b>warming</b> may increase newt mortality by disturbing their hibernation and forcing them to expend more energy. Finally, the genus is potentially susceptible to the highly pathogenic fungus Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans, introduced to Europe from Asia.|$|E
5|$|Severe {{landslides}} {{and floods}} {{are projected to}} become increasingly common in such states as Assam. Ecological disasters, such as a 1998 coral bleaching event that killed off more than 70% of corals in the reef ecosystems off Lakshadweep and the Andamans and was brought on by elevated ocean temperatures tied <b>to</b> <b>global</b> <b>warming,</b> are also projected to become increasingly common. Meghalaya and other northeastern states are also concerned that rising sea levels will submerge much of Bangladesh and spawn a refugee crisis. If severe climate changes occurs, Bangladesh and parts of India that border it may lose vast tracts of coastal land.|$|E

5|$|The film {{includes}} segments {{intended to}} refute {{critics who say}} {{that global warming is}} unproven or that warming will be insignificant. For example, Gore discusses the possibility of the collapse of a major ice sheet in Greenland or in West Antarctica, either of which could raise global sea levels by approximately 20 feet (6m), flooding coastal areas and producing 100 million refugees. Melt water from Greenland, because of its lower salinity, could then halt the currents that keep northern Europe warm and quickly trigger dramatic local cooling there.
