He went into further detail on Front Row, in which he was asked if this was a shift in his beliefs: [...] "A shift in me in the sense I heard my father talk to me when I was in the garden one day. But I'm absolutely certain that what I heard was my memories of my father. An engram, or something in my head...This is not about God, but somewhere around <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>where</b> gods come from." ...|$|E
2500|$|The trash-to-steam {{incinerator}} {{was another}} proposed industry, also objected to by Camden residents. Once again, Primas [...] "...was motivated by fiscal more than social concerns," [...] and he faced heavy opposition from Concerned Citizens of North Camden (CCNC) and from Michael Doyle, {{who was so}} opposed to the plant that he appeared on CBS's 60 Minutes, saying [...] "Camden has the biggest concentration of people in all the county, and yet <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>where</b> they're going to send in this sewage.....everytime you flush, you send to Camden, to Camden, to Camden". Despite this opposition, which eventually culminated in protests, [...] "the county proceeded to present the city of Camden with a check for $1 million in March 1989, {{in exchange for the}} eighteen acres of city-owned land where the new facility was to be built.....The $112 million plant finally fired up {{for the first time in}} March 1991".|$|E

60|$|Ho-o-u-mi {{is a small}} valley, {{separated}} from Typee by a low ridge, and thither we started when we had knocked our indomitable and insatiable riding-animals into submission. As it was, Warren's mount, after a mile run, selected the most dangerous part of the trail for an exhibition that kept us all on the anxious seat for fully five minutes. We rode by the mouth of Typee valley and gazed down upon the beach from which Melville escaped. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>where</b> the whale-boat lay on its oars close in to the surf; and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>where</b> Karakoee, the taboo Kanaka, stood {{in the water and}} trafficked for the sailor's life. <b>There,</b> surely, <b>was</b> <b>where</b> Melville gave Fayaway the parting embrace ere he dashed for the boat. And <b>there</b> <b>was</b> the point of land from which Mehevi and Mow-mow and their following swam off to intercept the boat, only to have their wrists gashed by sheath-knives when they laid hold of the gunwale, though it was reserved for Mow-mow to receive the boat-hook full in the throat from Melville's hands.|$|R

6000|$|... "You'll {{know the}} island at a glance," [...] said he. [...] "Approaching it from this side, it {{looks exactly like}} a long loaf of bread with a hump in the middle.

60|$|The Merry Little Breezes told Peter that Johnny Chuck {{was still}} on the Green Meadows, hunting for a new home, so Peter made up his mind that just as soon as Johnny got settled, Peter would hunt him up and call.

60|$|I {{only meant}} {{to write about}} the churches, but I keep {{wandering}} from the subject. I could say that the Church of the Annunciation is a wilderness of beautiful columns, of statues, gilded moldings, and pictures almost countless, but that would give no one an entirely perfect idea of the thing, and so where is the use? One family built the whole edifice, and have got money left. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>where</b> the mystery lies. We had an idea at first that only a mint could have survived the expense.|$|E

In the Mountains of the Moon, in the Central Africa of the night, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>where</b> all Niles have their hidden heads.

Oh, the restless hours I have spent since I last saw you, in yon {{beautiful}} grove. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>where</b> I trifled with your feelings {{for the express purpose}} of trying your attachment for me. I now find you are devoted; but ah! I trust you live not unguarded by the powers of Heaven. Though oft did I refuse to join my hand with thine, and as oft did I cruelly mock thy entreaties with borrowed shapes: yes, I feared to answer thee by terms, in words sincere and undissembled. O! could I pursue, and you have leisure to hear the annals of my woes, the evening star would shut Heaven's gates upon the impending day before my tale would be finished, and this night would find me soliciting your forgiveness." ...|$|E
60|$|We {{only had}} one brief little season of heaven and heaven's sweet ecstasy and peace during all this long and diligent and acrimonious {{reproduction}} of the other place. This was while a gorgeous procession of people marched around and around, in the third act, and sang the Wedding Chorus. To my untutored ear that was music--almost divine music. While my seared soul was steeped in the healing balm of those gracious sounds, {{it seemed to me}} that I could almost resuffer the torments which had gone before, in order to be so healed again. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>where</b> the deep ingenuity of the operatic idea is betrayed.

I found a restaurant tent just opened up by an outfit that had drifted in on {{the tail of the}} boom. They had knocked together a box house, where they lived and did the cooking, and served the meals in a tent pitched against the side. That tent was joyful with placards on it calculated to redeem the world-worn pilgrim from the sinfulness of boarding houses and pick-me- up hotels. 'Try Mother's Home-Made Biscuits,' 'What's the Matter with Our Apple Dumplings and Hard Sauce?' 'Hot Cakes and Maple Syrup Like You Ate When a Boy,' 'Our Fried Chicken Never Was Heard to Crow'-- there was literature doomed to please the digestions of man!
