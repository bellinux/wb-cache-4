500|$|... "Watch Over Me" [...] was {{released}} {{as the final}} single on 24 June 2006. All proceeds from the single were passed on to Australian charity Youngcare. Fanning also toured with Kasey Chambers, again giving proceeds to the charity. Fanning said that [...] "the aim of this show and the single release is {{to raise money for}} Youngcare but also to raise awareness of the terrible situation <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>young</b> people face", referring to children forced to live in aged facilities. [...] "Watch Over Me" [...] spent eight weeks on the ARIA Singles Chart, where it peaked at number 16. The song was performed by Fanning, Chambers, and Clare Bowditch at the 2006 ARIA Awards.|$|E
500|$|Adopting {{the color}} of their {{favorite}} charioteers was a way fans showed their loyalty to that particular racer or faction. Many of the young men in the fan clubs, or factions, adopted extravagant clothing and hairstyles, such as billowing sleeves, [...] "Hunnic" [...] hair-styles, and [...] "Persian" [...] facial hair. There is evidence <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>young</b> men were the faction members most prone to violence and extreme factional rivalry. Some scholars have tried to argue that the factional rivalry and violence was a result of opposing religious or political views, but more likely the young men simply identified strongly with their faction for group solidarity. The factional violence was probably engaged in similarly to the violence of modern football or soccer fans. The games themselves were the usual focus of the factional violence, even when it was taken to the streets. Although fans who went to the hippodrome cheered on their favorite charioteers, their loyalty appears to be to the color for which the charioteer drove more than for the individual driver. Charioteers could change faction allegiance and race for different colors during their careers, but the fans didn't change their allegiance to their color.|$|E
25|$|A {{possible}} second {{species of}} Struthiomimus is {{known from the}} early Maastrichtian (Edmontonian age) Horseshoe Canyon Formation. Because dinosaur fauna show rapid turnover, it is likely <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>younger</b> Struthiomimus specimens represent a species distinct from S. altus, though no new name {{has been given to}} them.|$|R
50|$|In 1866 Daubigny visited England, {{eventually}} returning {{because of}} the Franco-Prussian war in 1870. In London he met Claude Monet, and together they left for the Netherlands. Back in Auvers, he met Paul Cézanne, another important Impressionist. It is assumed <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>younger</b> painters were influenced by Daubigny.|$|R
5000|$|In John Updike's novel Bech at Bay, for the protagonist, [...] "It embarrassed him <b>that</b> for <b>these</b> <b>young</b> Czechs American writing, its square {{dance of}} lame old names, should appear such a lively gavotte, prancing {{carefree}} into the future." ...|$|R
2500|$|Likewise, {{women were}} {{considered}} to be particularly attracted to both wakashū and onnagata, and it was assumed <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>young</b> men would reciprocate that interest. Therefore, both the typical practitioners of nanshoku and the young men they desired would be considered bisexual in modern terminology. Men who were purely homosexual might be called [...] "woman-haters" [...] (onna-girai); this term, however, carried the connotation of aggressive distaste of women in all social contexts, rather than simply a preference for male sexual partners.|$|E
2500|$|There is also {{controversy}} about the indicators of good {{psychological and social}} development when resilience is studied across different cultures and contexts. The American Psychological Association's Task Force on Resilience and Strength in Black Children and Adolescents, for example, notes {{that there may be}} special skills <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>young</b> people and families have that help them cope, including the ability to resist racial prejudice. Researchers of indigenous health have shown the impact of culture, history, community values, and geographical settings on resilience in indigenous communities. People who cope may also show [...] "hidden resilience" [...] when they don't conform with society’s expectations for how someone is supposed to behave (in some contexts, aggression may be required to cope, or less emotional engagement may be protective in situations of abuse). Recently there has also been evidence that resilience can indicate a capacity to resist a sharp decline in other harm even though a person temporarily appears to get worse.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the primary}} goals of the OI in its first years was not only to promote the {{organizing}} model but to reinvigorate the labor movement. [...] An essential element in achieving this goal was the recruitment of non-union people into the labor movement. OI staff {{came to believe that}} labor organizers were often too old, too discouraged, and too committed to the existing political goals of their unions (which focused on contract servicing rather than organizing) to be effective. [...] Additionally, many of these veteran staff were experienced only in older methods of union organizing, and did not have the skills or inclination to effectively combat new anti-union strategies and tactics utilized by employers. Bensinger and his immediate successors made a significant effort to recruit activists from the environmental, civil rights, and other progressive movements; activists who had experience in militant and disruptive direct action which caught the eye of the press and the public. OI staff believed <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>young</b> activists would bring a new level of commitment and energy to the labor movement.|$|E

2500|$|Kitt {{was active}} in {{numerous}} social causes in the 1950s and 1960s. In 1966, she established the Kittsville Youth Foundation, a chartered and non-profit organization for underprivileged youths in the Watts area of Los Angeles. She was also involved {{with a group of}} youths in the area of Anacostia in Washington, D.C., who called themselves [...] "Rebels with a Cause." [...] Kitt supported the groups' efforts to clean up streets and establish recreation areas {{in an effort to keep}} them out of trouble by testifying with them before the House General Subcommittee on Education of the Committee on Education and Labor. In her testimony, in May 1967, Kitt stated that the Rebels' [...] "achievements and accomplishments should certainly make the adult 'do-gooders' realize <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>young</b> men and women have performed in 1 short year - with limited finances - that which was not achieved by the same people who might object to turning over some of the duties of planning, rehabilitation, and prevention of juvenile delinquents and juvenile delinquency to those who understand it and are living it". She added that [...] "the Rebels could act as a model for all urban areas throughout the United States with similar problems". [...] "Rebels with a Cause" [...] subsequently received the needed funding.|$|E

5000|$|In October 2011, Laura Moreno and Jessi Quintero were arrested, {{accused of}} perjury and {{covering}} a crime.

5000|$|Several {{surviving}} Nevada crewmen, who at {{time were}} {{young men of}} 18 and 19 years old, credit Hill with saving their lives by ordering them during the action to take protective cover behind the ship's gun turrets. (Presumably the veteran Hill recognized <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>younger</b> sailors, being completely mentally unprepared for a sudden full-scale sneak attack, {{would have been at}} great risk of becoming [...] "cannon fodder", prompting his order for them to take cover.) These former sailors mention that Hill, who was 47 {{years old at the time}} of the attack and had 30 years of naval service, had a level of respect on par with the captain of the Nevada himself.|$|R
