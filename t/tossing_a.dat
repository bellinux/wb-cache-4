5|$|Although Herodotus {{presents}} the revolt {{as a consequence}} of Aristagoras and Histiaeus's personal motives, it is clear that Ionia must have been ripe for rebellion anyway. The primary grievance was the tyrants installed by the Persians. While Greek states had in the past often been ruled by tyrants, this was a form of government on the decline. Moreover, past tyrants had tended (and needed) to be strong and able leaders, whereas the rulers appointed by the Persians were simply the representatives of the Persians. Backed by Persian military might, these tyrants did not need the support of the population, and could thus rule absolutely. Aristagoras's actions have thus been likened to <b>tossing</b> <b>a</b> flame into a kindling box; they incited rebellion across Ionia, and tyrannies were everywhere abolished, and democracies established in their place.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} Bond novels, such as Casino Royale, {{gambling}} is a theme, {{with not only}} golf {{as part of the}} novel, but opening with the canasta game as well. Raymond Benson identified times in the novel when Bond's investigation of Goldfinger was a gamble too and cites Bond <b>tossing</b> <b>a</b> coin to decide on his tactics in relation to his quarry. Once more (as with Live and Let Die and Dr. No) it is Bond the British agent who has to sort out what turns out to be an American problem and this can be seen as Fleming's reaction to the lack of US support over the Suez Crisis in 1956 as well as Bond's warning to Goldfinger not to underestimate the English.|$|E
5|$|Mickal {{showed his}} {{versatility}} {{in the first}} game of the 1933 season against Rice, <b>tossing</b> <b>a</b> 40-yard pass on the first play from scrimmage to end Pete Burge and booting punts of 76 and 61 yards. In week four against Arkansas Mickal completed touchdown passes of 48 and 57 yards and ran for a 15-yard touchdown, as he was responsible for every score in the 20–0 win over the eventual Southwest Conference champion Razorbacks. He scored the only touchdown of LSU's final game of the season, against Tennessee, with a goal line dive into the end zone. He also kicked the extra point for the 7–0 victory, and completed the season having successfully made every extra point he attempted. The Tigers finished undefeated with three ties in their first season as members of the Southeastern Conference (SEC). After the season, Mickal was named to the United Press (UP) All-SEC second team as a halfback.|$|E

5|$|The {{expedition}} sailed in {{the spring}} of 499 BC but quickly descended into a debacle The force laid siege to the Naxians for four months, but eventually the Persians and Aristagoras both ran out of money. The force therefore sailed despondently back to the mainland. Aristagoras found himself in dire straits and fully expected to be stripped of his position by Artaphernes. In a desperate attempt to save himself, Aristagoras chose to incite his own subjects, the Milesians, to revolt against their Persian masters, thereby beginning the Ionian Revolt. Although Herodotus presents the revolt as a consequence of Aristagoras's personal motives, it is clear that Ionia must have been ripe for rebellion anyway, the primary grievance being the tyrants installed by the Persians. Aristagoras's actions have thus been likened to <b>tossing</b> <b>a</b> flame into a kindling box; they incited rebellion across Ionia (and Aeolis and Doris), and tyrannies were everywhere abolished, and democracies established in their place.|$|E
5|$|The Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus), {{also called}} the white {{scavenger}} vulture or pharaoh's chicken, is a small Old World vulture and {{the only member of}} the genus Neophron. It is widely distributed; the Egyptian vulture is found from southwestern Europe and northern Africa to India. The contrasting underwing pattern and wedge-shaped tail make it distinctive in flight as it soars in thermals during the warmer parts of the day. Egyptian vultures feed mainly on carrion but are opportunistic and will prey on small mammals, birds, and reptiles. They also feed on the eggs of other birds, breaking larger ones by <b>tossing</b> <b>a</b> large pebble onto them. The use of tools is rare in birds and apart from the use of a pebble as a hammer, Egyptian vultures also use twigs to roll up wool for use in their nest. Egyptian vultures that breed in the temperate regions migrate south in winter while tropical populations are relatively sedentary. Populations of this species have declined in the 20th century and some island populations are endangered by hunting, accidental poisoning, and collision with power lines.|$|E

25|$|Consider <b>tossing</b> <b>a</b> coin with known, not {{necessarily}} fair, probabilities of coming up heads or tails; {{this can be}} modelled as a Bernoulli process.|$|E
25|$|Monte Carlo simulation: Drawing a {{large number}} of {{pseudo-random}} uniform variables from the interval , and assigning values {{less than or equal to}} 0.50 as heads and greater than 0.50 as tails, is a Monte Carlo simulation of the behavior of repeatedly <b>tossing</b> <b>a</b> coin.|$|E
25|$|There are two clear {{limitations}} {{to the classical}} definition. Firstly, it is applicable only to situations {{in which there is}} only a 'finite' number of possible outcomes. But some important random experiments, such as <b>tossing</b> <b>a</b> coin until it rises heads, give rise to an infinite set of outcomes. And secondly, you need to determine in advance that all the possible outcomes are equally likely without relying on the notion of probability to avoid circularity—for instance, by symmetry considerations.|$|E

25|$|They tested {{this concept}} under three {{different}} conditions. The first was person focused, where {{the person who}} tossed the coin mentioned that she was <b>tossing</b> <b>a</b> lot of heads or tails. Second was a coin focus, where the person who tossed the coin mentioned that the coin was {{coming up with a}} lot of heads or tails. Finally there was a control condition in which there was nothing said by the person tossing the coin. The participants were also assigned to different groups, one in which the person flipping the coin changed and the other where the person remained the same.|$|E
25|$|In other areas, {{such as in}} a vote, {{there may}} be a method to break the tie. Having an odd number of voters is one solution—after the {{election}} of the Doge of Venice by a committee of 40 was deadlocked in a tie, the number of electors was increased to 41—but may not always be successful, for example, if a member is absent or abstains. In many cases one member of an assembly may by convention not normally vote, but will exercise a casting vote in case of deadlock. Sometimes some method of random choice, such as <b>tossing</b> <b>a</b> coin, may be resorted to even in a formal vote.|$|E
25|$|The 1984 team {{got off to}} a 9-0 start {{highlighted}} by Jack Morris <b>tossing</b> <b>a</b> nationally televised no-hitter against Chicago in the fourth game of the season. They stayed hot for most of the year, posting a 35-5 record over their first forty games and cruising to a franchise-record 104 victories. The Tigers led the division from opening day {{until the end of the}} regular season and finished a staggering 15 games ahead of the second-place Toronto Blue Jays. Closer Willie Hernández, acquired from the 1983 NL champion Philadelphia Phillies in the offseason, won both the AL Cy Young and AL Most Valuable Player awards, a rarity for a relief pitcher.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the team's overall performance, {{the first half of}} the season provided several memorable moments for the players themselves. Highlights included Johnson earning his 300th career victory, becoming the twenty-fourth pitcher in Major League history to do so, as well as struggling starter Jonathan Sánchez <b>tossing</b> <b>a</b> no-hitter against the San Diego Padres on July 10, the first Giants no-hitter since 1976. 2009's pitching staff will go down as one of the strongest starting rotations in Giants history– the Giants sent two of their starting pitchers to the All-Star Game, including that year's starter, Tim Lincecum. He went on to win the 2009 NL Cy Young Award, finishing at 15–7. Lincecum became the only pitcher to capture the Cy Young Award in each of his first two full Major League seasons.|$|E
25|$|University of Utah quarterback Alex Smith and Bush {{were both}} finalists for the 2004 Heisman Trophy, {{making it the}} first time a high school had two finalists at the same ceremony. In 2004, Bush {{finished}} fifth in the Heisman voting and was named the team's MVP. He earned consensus All-American honors and was a finalist for the Walter Camp Player of the Year Award. He finished second on the team with 143 carries for 908 yards (6.3 avg) and six touchdowns, adding 509 yards and seven scores on 43 receptions (11.8 avg). Bush returned 21 kickoffs for 537 yards (25.6 avg) and 24 punts for 376 yards (15.7 avg) and a pair of touchdowns. He became the first Trojan since Marcus Allen to lead the Pac-10 in all-purpose yardage, totaling 2,330 yards. He also threw for one touchdown, <b>tossing</b> <b>a</b> 52-yard scoring strike.|$|E
25|$|However, Favre {{dominated}} the 49ers {{defense in the}} second half, completing 16 of 21 passes for 226 yards and leading his team to four scoring drives. First, he led the Packers 72 yards in 12 plays, completing two passes for 21 yards to Bill Schroeder and a 22-yarder to Freeman {{en route to a}} 26-yard field goal by Ryan Longwell. After a San Francisco punt, Favre led his team to the end zone in just three plays, <b>tossing</b> <b>a</b> 12-yard completion to fullback William Henderson, following it up with a 51-yard strike to Corey Bradford, and then finishing the drive with a 19-yard touchdown pass to Bubba Franks with 3:26 left in the third quarter, giving the Packers a 15–7 lead after the 49ers defense tackled Donald Driver short of the end zone on a two-point conversion attempt.|$|E

A few other homes in this area also sustained significant structural damage. It then quickly weakened back to EF2 intensity as it completely destroyed the canopy of a service station, snapped large trees, tore the entire roof off of a restaurant, and severely damaged a large Procter & Gamble plant in Albany. Multiple anchored double-wide trailers were completely destroyed at the Marine Corp Logistics Base, and concrete light poles were snapped. Several semi-trailers were tossed and piled atop each other, and multiple other large metal industrial buildings sustained heavy damage in this area as well. A house also had much of its roof ripped off.|$|E
25|$|Following {{his victory}} over Konnan Cibernético began {{targeting}} {{the other members}} of La Legión, especially longtime member El Zorro and Vampiro who had recently sided with them. When El Mesias was forced out of the ring due to a shoulder injury Cibernético had to fight the odds by himself. At Triplemanía XVIII Cibernético teamed up with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) worker Abyss to fight El Zorro and Vampiro in a hardcore match. The match saw the interference of La Legión members Chessman, Christopher Daniels, Alex Koslov, Nosawa and Hernandez throughout the match. Near the end of the match Vampiro got into an argument with Konnan resulting in Konnan <b>tossing</b> <b>a</b> handful of white powder into Vampiro's face. Blinded, Vampiro became a victim of Cibernético's Garra Cibernetica for the pin fall. After the match La Legión attacked the two tecnicos again, but were fought off, then beaten down by Cibernético, with assist from La Hermandad 187 (Nicho el Millonario and Joe Líder).|$|E
25|$|While New Super Mario Bros. Wii is a 2D platformer, {{some of the}} {{characters}} and objects are 3D polygonal renderings on 2D backgrounds, resulting in a 2.5D effect (also seen in New Super Mario Bros.) that visually simulates 3D computer graphics. Players can play as either Mario, his brother Luigi or two Toad characters: one blue and one yellow (with the first player always as Mario). Controls {{are similar to those}} of New Super Mario Bros., albeit with the added abilities of spinning in mid-air by shaking the Wii Remote; and picking up, carrying, and throwing other players. The game does not feature online multiplayer. In multiplayer mode, there can be up to four players simultaneously. If players lose a life, but have at least one life in reserve, they will re-emerge encased inside a bubble, and can resume play once another player frees them by touching the bubble or <b>tossing</b> <b>a</b> fire ball, ice ball or Koopa shell (the player can shake the Wii Remote to move their bubble closer to an active player, but they cannot free themselves). If players lose a life and do not have any more lives, they must use a Continue and start over from their last save point with five lives left. Players can also encase themselves inside the bubble by pressing the A button while a more skilled player traverses a difficult segment. If every character in a co-op session enters a bubble at the same time (whether through death or by pressing the A button), they will lose the level and must restart.|$|E
