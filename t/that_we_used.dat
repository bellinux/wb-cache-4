25|$|I had {{my editor}} count shots. There are 139 dance {{shots in the}} film. 111 are Natalie Portman untouched. 28 are her dance double Sarah Lane. If you do the math, that's 80% Natalie Portman. What about duration? The shots that feature the double are wide shots and rarely play for longer than one second. There are two {{complicated}} longer dance sequences <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>used</b> face replacement. Even so, if we were judging by time, over 90% would be Natalie Portman. And to be clear, Natalie did dance on pointe in pointe shoes. If {{you look at the}} final shot of the opening prologue, which lasts 85 seconds, and was danced completely by Natalie, she exits the scene on pointe. That is completely her without any digital magic. I am responding to this to put this to rest and to defend my actor. Natalie sweated long and hard to deliver a great physical and emotional performance. And I don't want anyone to think that's not her they are watching. It is.|$|E
500|$|One thing I {{remember}} {{having had a}} really depressing effect on me was the first Ramones album. When I heard it , I mean {{it was a great}} record... but I hated it because I knew we'd been doing this sort of stuff for years. There was even a chord progression on that album <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>used...</b> and I thought, [...] "Fuck. We're going to be labeled as influenced by the Ramones", when nothing could have been further from the truth.|$|E

[...] Said Eitan, [...] "From {{the operational}} point of view I can say <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>used</b> the mini-RPVs, long before the war, to identify and locate all the Syrian missile batteries. We then used superior electronic devices which enabled us to [...] "blind" [...] or neutralize the missile sites' ground-to-air radar. We rendered them ineffective to take reliable fixes on our aircraft aloft. But in advance of direct aerial attacks, we used long-range artillery".|$|E

I couldn't grumble about <b>that.</b> <b>We</b> <b>used</b> to get on very well, and he would listen to the {{instructions}} I gave him. Then he became world famous!" [...] The respect was mutual: though Greaves described the Chelsea title-winning side as [...] "almost certainly one of the least talented teams ever to win the title", he made an exception for McNichol, [...] "the ball player of the team". In all competitions, he made 202 appearances for Chelsea and scored 66 goals.|$|E

He also wanted some sort of clear, [...] conflict that influenced all things on some level but didn't simply overpower everything. We decided on Order vs. Chaos as it's far less black and white than Good vs. Evil... after all, agents of Order or Chaos could potentially use any means at their disposal to bring about the rise of their cause, meaning that either side has its share of goodies and baddies." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Party" [...] was {{directed}} by Beyoncé and Alan Ferguson. As reported by Rap-Up, Beyoncé filmed the clip in the Oakdale Mobile Home Park in South Brunswick Township, New Jersey, on August 2, 2011. The video shoot called for multiple flashy fashions, a red muscle car, and colorfully dressed dancers. Solange Knowles, Beyoncé's younger sister, and Kelly Rowland, former Destiny's Child member, both made cameos. Rowland elaborated a bit about {{her role in the}} video in an interview with NeonLimelight: [...] "I'm just doing a cameo. We just had a really good time [...] While filming the video, we noticed that we were doing certain stuff <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>used</b> to do as kids. We kinda felt a little goofy for a second, so we stopped. But we just had a good time.". Model Shaun Ross also makes a cameo in the video.|$|E

500|$|The ninth {{season of}} the show was {{produced}} by Reveille Productions and Deedle-Dee Productions, both in association with Universal Television. The show {{is based on the}} British comedy series of the same name, which was created by Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant for the BBC. In addition, the two are executive producers on the show. On May 11, 2012, NBC renewed The Office for a ninth season. Series developer Greg Daniels returned as showrunner this season. Daniels stated that the season would feature more big season arcs, saying [...] "I'll tell you that the last couple of years, I don't think we did any big arc-type things in the way <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>used</b> to in the beginning, I think the thing we're going to do is bring back a lot of arcs."

500|$|Lead {{designer}} Cliff Bleszinski credits {{much of the}} game's {{success to}} its community. As {{he said in the}} November 2001 issue of Maximum PC, [...] "Unreal Tournament would not have sold nearly two million copies if it did not have support from the community... We ship the very same tools <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>used</b> to build the game, and folks use these tools to realize their own visions of first-person action." [...] Like Unreal, Unreal Tournament is designed to be easily programmable and highly modularized. Through its scripting environment UnrealScript and level editor UnrealEd, developers are able to modify easily most parts of the game to both manipulate default game behavior and to supplement the game with their own mods. These range from slight changes on some aspects of gameplay (such as map voting) to total conversions. One modification, ChaosUT, became popular enough that it was included with the 'Game of the Year' edition of the game, while [...] was released as a stand-alone retail product.|$|E
500|$|Insane Clown Posse {{is known}} for their {{elaborate}} concert performances. In Marley Brant's Tales from the Rock 'n' Roll Highway, Bruce described a typical performance: [...] "We toss out, kick out, and shoot out into the crowd about three to four hundred two-liters of Faygo at every show...We bring with us monsters, dancing clowns, girls, trampolines, and pure and absolute madness to the stage...Shaggy and I know that without all that crazy shit going on around us, we'd just be two more idiots walking back and forth, rapping on stage...ICP's motto has always been 'Fuck keepin' it real: we just keep it entertaining.'" [...] Performances feature backdrops including, among other settings, a game show set and a cemetery. Bruce stated, [...] "We always have a different set, not only for Hallowicked but every tour we go out on. We've been around so long that we get to dig up the many cool sets <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>used</b> {{back in the day}} and then get to use them again on a national level. Something we might've done once in '94 at St. Andrew's Hall, we can go back again and now do it nationwide-style".|$|E

This is his first writing credit for the series since the seventh season entry, [...] "Goodbye, Michael", and his first directing credited since season seven's [...] "PDA". This also marks the third time he has both written and directed an episode, after the first season episode [...] "Basketball" [...] and the fourth season opener, [...] "Fun Run". Daniels later revealed that [...] "New Guys" [...] would be the inception of big season arcs.

Jerkins, who produced the track, later claimed that both singers [...] "didn’t get along" [...] during production and that he and Dexter Simmons remixed the track seven times to keep everything even.
