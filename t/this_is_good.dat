5|$|One type of {{piezoelectric}} transducer is the Langevin type, {{named after a}} transducer used by Paul Langevin in early sonar research. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> for longitudinal modes of vibration. It {{can also be used}} on resonators with other modes of vibration if the motion can be mechanically converted into a longitudinal motion. The transducer consists of a layer of piezoelectric material sandwiched transversally into a coupling rod or resonator.|$|E
25|$|Another {{technique}} is image replacement. This practice involves overlaying text {{with an image}} containing the same text written in the desired font. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> for aesthetic purposes, but prevents text selection, increases bandwidth use, is bad for search engine optimization, and makes the text inaccessible for users with disabilities.|$|E
25|$|Front and hind hooves are {{identical}} in the foal, but differ visibly {{in the adult}} horse. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> evidence of medium-term plasticity of the whole hoof shape, {{as a result of}} variation in its use. Slow changes in hoof shape occur under any consistent change in the horse's movement pattern and under a wide variety of pathological conditions. They can be seen now as a clear example of a complex adaptive system, a frequent feature of living beings and structures.|$|E

25|$|The {{process of}} {{compressing}} gas into a diving cylinder removes {{moisture from the}} gas. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> for corrosion prevention in the cylinder but means that the diver inhales very dry gas. The dry gas extracts moisture from the diver's lungs while underwater contributing to dehydration, which is also {{thought to be a}} predisposing risk factor of decompression sickness. It is also uncomfortable, causing a dry mouth and throat and making the diver thirsty. This problem is reduced in rebreathers because the soda lime reaction, which removes carbon dioxide, also puts moisture back into the breathing gas. In hot climates, open circuit diving can accelerate heat exhaustion because of dehydration. Another concern with regard to moisture content is the tendency of moisture to condense as the gas is decompressed while passing through the regulator; this coupled with the extreme reduction in temperature, also due to the decompression can cause the moisture to solidify as ice. This icing up in a regulator can cause moving parts to seize and the regulator to fail or free flow.|$|E
500|$|The {{band members}} {{began to have}} doubts about the record's sound. [...] During this time, Cobain admitted, [...] "The first time I played it at home, I knew there was {{something}} wrong. [...] The whole first week I wasn't really interested in listening to it at all, and that usually doesn't happen. [...] I got no emotion from it, I was just numb." [...] The group concluded that the bass and lyrics were inaudible and approached Albini to remix the album. [...] The producer declined; as he recalled, [...] " [...] wanted to make a record that he could slam down on the table and say, 'Listen, I know <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>good,</b> and I know your concerns about it are meaningless, so go with it.' [...] And I don't think he felt he had that yet... My problem was that I feared a slippery slope." [...] The band attempted to fix its concerns with the record during the mastering process with Bob Ludwig at his studio in Portland, Maine. [...] Novoselic was pleased with the results, but Cobain still did not feel the sound was perfect.|$|E
2500|$|As many sprinters are now 20 years old, TOCs are {{beginning}} to replace them. For example, London Midland have decided to replace their ageing Class 150 fleet with Class 172s from 2010. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> news for the passenger as most Sprinters lack air conditioning [...] and have {{a top speed of}} only 75mph. They can be noisy inside, as opening windows are needed for ventilation and there are no pressure doors {{at the end of each}} carriage, next to the external doors.|$|E

2500|$|Cardinal Walter Kasper {{said that}} [...] "a battle is going on" [...] in the Synod Fathers' deliberations, but British Cardinal Vincent Nichols {{challenged}} that metaphor. [...] Nichols {{said that it}} was wrong to look at it as [...] "a battle between contesting sides. Battles have winners and losers. And often ‘collateral damage’ is the most tragic consequence of hostilities." [...] He instead called it [...] "a time of prayerful discernment." [...] Argentine Cardinal Luis Villalba, a friend of Pope Francis', believed that [...] "There are different accents, perspectives, and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>good.</b> These might change, but doctrine will remain the same." ...|$|E
2500|$|For {{several months}} prior to her death, {{she was unable to}} take an active part in convent life.

2500|$|Dennis Harvey of Variety gave a {{positive}} review, writing, [...] "Though {{not quite as}} inspired or consistent as the similarly self-mocking likes of The Cabin in the Woods, Tucker & Dale vs. Evil or the first two Scream pics, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> fun that should delight genre fans." [...] Justin Lowe of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, [...] "Genre enthusiasts will {{get a kick out}} of Todd Strauss-Schulson's creative homage to classic slasher movies, which respects familiar horror conventions while introducing a sly contemporary perspective." [...] Laura Kern of Film Comment called the film a [...] "sharp, wickedly funny, and unexpectedly heartfelt homage" [...] to slasher films, adding, [...] "It's a gimmicky premise, perhaps, but a highly effective one. No mere meta-exercise, the film innovatively blends the worlds of the 1986 teens of Camp Bloodbath with the modern-day ones." ...|$|E

2500|$|Traditionally, {{the strings}} were {{wrapped around the}} goose feet, {{but there has been}} a device that has been invented, which is a block of wood {{attached}} to the goose feet, with pins similar to those used to tune the guzheng protruding out at the sides, so one can string and tune the qin using a tuning wrench. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> for those who lack the physical strength to pull and add tension to the strings when wrapping the ends to the goose feet. However, the tuning device looks rather unsightly and thus many qin players prefer the traditional manner of tuning; many also feel that the strings should be firmly wrapped to the goose feet in order that the sound may be [...] "grounded" [...] into the qin and some feel that the device which covers the phoenix pond sound hole has a negative effect on the sound volume and quality.|$|E
2500|$|Her {{enthusiasm for}} Nikolai Gogol's work became {{reflected}} in both her husband's compositions {{and those of}} his friends. On the day of their betrothal, she and Rimsky-Korsakov read Gogol's short story [...] "May Night" [...] together. Afterwards, {{she told him that}} he should write an opera based on it. A week or two later she wrote him, I've been reading yet another of Gogol's stories today, [...] "The Fair at Sorochyntsi." [...] <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>good,</b> too, and would even be suitable for an opera, but not for you; in any case, it's not like 'May Night.' As for that, it's so stuck in my head that nothing will drive it out. Either she or her sister Alexandra then suggested [...] "The Fair at Sorochyntsi" [...] to Mussorgsky. He did not act on it at the time, but a couple of years later, he reconsidered.|$|E
2500|$|... and Kenney's 1992 book {{refers to}} the VS line as [...] "minicomputers" [...] throughout. Although some argue that the {{high-end}} VSes and their successors should qualify as mainframes, Wang avoided this term. In his autobiography, An Wang, rather than calling the VS 300 a mainframe, said that it [...] "verges on mainframe performance". He went on to draw distinction between the [...] "mainframes" [...] {{at the high end}} of IBM's line ("just as Detroit would rather sell large cars ... so IBM would rather sell mainframes")—in which IBM had a virtual monopoly—with the [...] "mid-sized systems" [...] in which IBM had not achieved dominance: [...] "The minicomputer market is still healthy. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> for the customer and good for minicomputer makers." [...] Wang Laboratories positioned the VS line as minicomputers, and reflected this in its marketing collateral and press releases. Later models, the small VS5000 series, launched in approximately 1988, were user-installable, the smallest being physically similar in size to PCs of the era. The largest supported an increasingly substantial number of users.|$|E
