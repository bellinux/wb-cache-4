40|$|<b>Thermal</b> <b>testing</b> {{method that}} {{is a kind of}} {{non-destructive}} testing, is applied to search for the non-adhesive area in the bonded structure. In the non-destructive testing, there is a few method such as the methods using the radiation, the ultrasonic and the character of electrical conduction {{with the exception of the}} <b>thermal</b> <b>testing</b> method. Especially, in the <b>thermal</b> <b>testing</b> method, it is possible to detect flaws in area, and it is easy to search existence of corrosion. Therefore, in this study this method is employed to search delamination in the bonded structure. The difference of temperature occurs on the upper material surface over the adhesive area and the non-adhesive area, because there is the non-adhesive area in the bond layer. Employing this difference of temperature, the non-adhesive area can be detected by the <b>thermal</b> <b>testing</b> method. However, it is difficult to measure the width of non-adhesive area by <b>thermal</b> <b>testing</b> method.

50|$|The Solar Tower Atmospheric Cherenkov Effect Experiment (STACEE), is a {{gamma ray}} {{detector}} located near Albuquerque, New Mexico.

50|$|A dish Stirling or dish {{engine system}} {{consists}} of a stand-alone parabolic reflector that concentrates light onto a receiver positioned at the reflector's focal point. The reflector tracks the Sun along two axes. The working fluid in the receiver is heated to 250 - 700 C and then used by a Stirling engine to generate power. Parabolic-dish systems provide high solar-to-electric efficiency (between 31% and 32%), and their modular nature provides scalability. The Stirling Energy Systems (SES), United Sun Systems (USS) and Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) dishes at UNLV, and Australian National University's Big Dish in Canberra, Australia are representative of this technology.

40|$|AbstractLaser heating {{technology}} {{is a type of}} potential and attractive space heat flux simulation technology, which is characterized by high heating rate, controlled spatial intensity distribution and rapid response. However, the controlled plant is nonlinear, time-varying and uncertainty when implementing the laser-based heat flux simulation. In this paper, a novel intelligent adaptive controller based on proportion–integration–differentiation (PID) type fuzzy logic is proposed to improve the performance of laser-based ground <b>thermal</b> <b>test.</b> The temperature range of thermal cycles is more than 200 K in many instances. In order to improve the adaptability of controller, output scaling factors are real time adjusted while the <b>thermal</b> <b>test</b> is underway. The initial values of scaling factors are optimized using a stochastic hybrid particle swarm optimization (H-PSO) algorithm. A validating system has been established in the laboratory. The performance of the proposed controller is evaluated through extensive experiments under different operating conditions (reference and load disturbance). The results show that the proposed adaptive controller performs remarkably better compared to the conventional PID (PID) controller and the conventional PID type fuzzy (F-PID) controller considering performance indicators of overshoot, settling time and steady state error for laser-based ground <b>thermal</b> <b>test.</b> It is a reliable tool for effective temperature control of laser-based ground <b>thermal</b> <b>test...</b>|$|E
