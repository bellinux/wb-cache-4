40|$|We {{consider}} a quantum relay {{which is used}} by two parties to perform several continuous-variable protocols: Entanglement swapping, distillation, quantum teleportation, and quantum key distribution. The <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> these <b>protocols</b> is extended to a non-Markovian model of decoherence characterized by correlated Gaussian noise. Even if bipartite entanglement is completely lost at the relay, we show that the various protocols can progressively be reactivated by the separable noise-correlations of the environment. In fact, above a critical amount, these correlations are able to restore the distribution of quadripartite entanglement, which can be localized into an exploitable bipartite form {{by the action of}} the relay. Our findings are confirmed by a proof-of-principle experiment and show the potential advantages of non-Markovian effects in a quantum network architecture. Comment: Main Text (7 pages, 6 Figures).

Using GUI-based applications is an alternative way to improve the understanding of the complex algorithms involved in routing protocols, because graphics, images and animations can be easily transformed into knowledge. With a visual didactic approach, students can understand how routing protocols really work in a more intuitive and friendly way than using traditional approaches. In this paper, we focused on the teaching and learning of EIGRP, an advanced distance-vector routing protocol developed by Cisco Systems, using visual educational tools. To do so, we present well-known computational tools (Packet Tracer, Dynamips/GNS 3 and OPNET IT Guru) and a new application that we developed (Easy-EIGRP), and discuss how they can be used to strengthen the teaching and learning of EIGRP...|$|R

Agent interaction, as a key aspect in multi-agent systems and automated negotiation, has lead {{to a number of}} proposed agent communication languages and protocols. In contrast to a language, a rational agent can reason about a protocol to strategically plan possible courses of action in a bid to achieve its goals. Existing techniques for specifying protocols have resulted in faulty and ambiguous interaction protocols, leading to contradictory beliefs between agents. There remains a need for formally specifying and validating sharable interaction protocols with desirable properties.

40|$|Coin {{flipping}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} fundamental tasks in cryptographic protocol design. Informally, a coin flipping protocol should guarantee both (1) Completeness: an honest execution <b>of</b> the <b>protocol</b> by both parties results in a fair coin toss, and (2) Security: a cheating party cannot increase the probability of its desired outcome by any significant amount. Since its introduction by Blum [B 82], coin flipping has occupied a central place in the <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> cryptographic <b>protocols.</b> In this paper, we explore what are the implications of the existence of secure coin flipping protocols for complexity theory. As exposited recently by Impagliazzo [I 09], surprisingly little is known about this question. Previous work has shown that if we interpret the Security property <b>of</b> coin flipping <b>protocols</b> very strongly, namely that nothing beyond a negligible bias by cheating parties is allowed, then one-way functions must exist [IL 89]. However, for even a slight weakening of this security property (for example that cheating parties cannot bias the outcome by any additive constant ɛ> 0), the only complexitytheoretic implication that was known was that PSPACE � BPP. We put forward a new attack to establish our main result, which shows that, informally speaking, the existence of any (weak) coin flipping protocol that prevents a cheating adversary from biasing the output by more than 1 4 − ɛ implies that NP � BPP. Furthermore, for constant-round protocols, we show that the existence of any (weak) coin flipping protocol that allows an honest party to maintain any noticeable chance of prevailing against a cheating party implies the existence of (infinitely often) one-way functions...|$|R

Researchers have recognized these shortcomings and devised mechanisms in which mobile devices act as WLAN access points to simulate WLAN infrastructure-based operation. In this paper, we complement these approaches by instrumenting commercial WLAN APs that do not employ L 2 security to serve as link layer packet relays without requiring the mobile nodes to authenticate with the WLAN hot-spot.

Some of our results bear a close relation to certain important issues in the <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> formal languages. 1 Background of the problem Consider the following problem in the <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> cryptographic <b>protocols.</b> A seller, S, possesses a number of secrets. S has published a list of descriptions of the secrets and is offering them for sale at a price {{that is the same}} for each of the secrets. A buyer B wants to buy one of the secrets.

These two seemingly contradictory requirements, S disclosing the secret B wants but no other secrets and S not knowing which secret he disclosed, can be fulfilled using cryptographic protocols based on one-way functions. The first solution suggested in [1] is very complicated. The solution in [7] is simple but requires several buyers. Recently a simple solution in the original set-up of one buyer has been given in [4]. The protocol for secret selling of secrets can also be used as a building block for more complicated protocols, [2].

A major task <b>of</b> this <b>theory</b> is the design <b>of</b> <b>protocols</b> that will maximize the social welfare of the agents. An ideal mechanism will optimize social welfare and will be strategy-proof, i. e. the dominant strategy of each agent will be {{to participate in the}} mechanism and to reveal his true goal and worth, as well as budget-balanced, i. e., the mechanism should not impose any payments from the center/organizer to the agents. Indeed, the Clarke’s mechanism, which is central to information economics and to games with incomplete information satisfies these properties. However, we show that the Clarke’s mechanism employs the use of procedures for optimizing social welfare, which are NP-hard. Hence, these procedures should be replaced by heuristics. We present a set of natural properties (axioms) of such heuristics that, when satisfied, enable to obtain the desired strategy-proofness and budget balance properties.

40|$|Abstract. We {{argue that}} a general <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> trust in {{networks}} of humans and computers must be build on both a <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> behavioral trust and a <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> computational trust. This argument is motivated by increased participation of people in social networking, crowdsourcing, human computation, and socio-economic protocols, e. g., protocols modeled by trust and gift-exchange games [3, 10, 11], norms-establishing contracts [1], and scams [6, 35, 33]. User participation in these protocols relies primarily on trust, since on-line verification <b>of</b> <b>protocol</b> compliance is often impractical; e. g., verification can lead to undecidable problems, co-NP complete test procedures, and user inconvenience. Trust is captured by participant preferences (i. e., risk and betrayal aversion) and beliefs in the trustworthiness <b>of</b> other <b>protocol</b> participants [11, 10]. Both preferences and beliefs can be enhanced whenever protocol non-compliance leads to punishment of untrustworthy participants [11, 23]; i. e., it seems natural that betrayal aversion can be decreased and belief in trustworthines...|$|R

A distributed control algorithm is investigated, while each agent exchanges information with neighboring agents and performs behaviors based on communication interactions. The objective of each agent is to converge to a common state considering different dynamic load characteristics, and distributed frequency control strategy is developed to enable the agents to provide active power support. Then, the distributed proportional integral controllers with the state feedback are designed considering the consensus protocol with topology. The <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> distributed consensus <b>protocol</b> isfurther developed to prove the stability of the proposed control algorithm.
