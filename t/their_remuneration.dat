Crucially, Taylor himself prominently acknowledged that if each employee's compensation was linked to their output, their productivity would go up. Thus his compensation plans usually included piece rates. In contrast, some later adopters of time and motion studies ignored this aspect and tried to get large productivity gains while passing little or no compensation gains to the workforce, which contributed to resentment against the system.|$|E

The results of the paper suggest that the small change in inequality between 1986 and 1992 was the result of mild forces that compensated each other. In contrast, between 1992 and 1998 nearly all factors had some role in increasing inequality to unprecedented levels. The increase in the returns to education, changes in endowments of unobservable factors and <b>their</b> <b>remunerations,</b> and the fall in hours of work by low-income people are particularly important to explain the growth in inequality in the nineties.

40|$|DescriptionThe {{subprime}} crisis {{has shown that}} the sophisticated risk management models used by banks and insurance companies had serious flaws. Some people even suggest that these models are completely useless. Others claim that the crisis was just an unpredictable accident that was largely amplified by the lack of expertise and even naivety of many investors. This book takes the middle view. It shows that these models have been designed for "tranquil times", when financial markets behave smoothly and efficiently. However, we are living in more and more "turbulent times": large risks materialize much more often than predicted by "normal" models, financial models periodically go through bubbles and crashes. Moreover, financial risks result from the decisions of economic actors who can have incentives to take excessive risks, especially when <b>their</b> <b>remunerations</b> are ill designed. The book provides a clear account of the fundamental hypotheses underlying the most popular models of risk management and show that these hypotheses are flawed. However it shows that simple models can still be useful, provided they are well understood and used with caution...|$|R

40|$|The {{originality}} of {{the study}} is that performances of CEOs are estimated by determining how efficiently they convert <b>their</b> own <b>remuneration</b> and other key company input resources into a key performance output. Accounting-based data, with the Du Pont analysis as conceptual framework, were applied as the other company input and output determinants. The main purpose was to determine whether there is a difference in remuneration of CEOs who are efficient and inefficient, as estimated by data envelopment analysis. A sample of 167 Johannesburg Stock Exchange-listed companies, divided into large, medium and small, from the industrial and resource sectors is empirically investigated. According to the Student t test, the study found that there is no statistically significant difference between the remuneration of efficient and inefficient CEOs of large and small companies, but for medium-sized companies, the inefficient CEOs are statistically significantly higher remunerated. A possible reason for this contradiction is, inter alia, that market-based performance determinants were not taken into account, which could lead to a different conclusion. The practical implication is that an accounting-based model is developed for company boards, which should consider using accounting-based data more frequently to benchmark <b>their</b> CEOs’ <b>remuneration,</b> since not only are these data readily available to make comparisons with peers, but it can be influenced more easily by a CEO {{as in the case of}} market-based determinants.

60|$|As far as I could learn, the {{servants}} of the post-office are less liberally paid in the States than with us, excepting as regards two classes.

The other class is that of postmasters at second- rate towns.

60|$|The {{dependence}} of wages {{on the number}} of the competitors for employment is so far from hard of comprehension, or unintelligible to the laboring-classes, that by great bodies of them it is already recognized and habitually acted on. It is familiar to all trades-unions: every successful combination to keep up wages owes its success to contrivances for restricting the number of competitors; all skilled trades are anxious to keep down their own numbers, and many impose, or endeavor to impose, as a condition upon employers, that they shall not take more than a prescribed number of apprentices. There is, of course, a great difference between limiting their numbers by excluding other people, and doing the same thing by a restraint imposed on themselves; but the one as much as the other shows a clear perception of the relation between their numbers and <b>their</b> <b>remuneration.</b> The principle is understood in its application to any one employment, but not to the general mass of employment. For this there are several reasons: first, the operation of causes is more easily and distinctly seen in the more circumscribed field; secondly, skilled artisans are a more intelligent class than ordinary manual laborers; and the habit of concert, and of passing in review their general condition as a trade, keeps up a better understanding of their collective interests; thirdly and lastly, they are the most provident, because they are the best off, and have the most to preserve.|$|E
