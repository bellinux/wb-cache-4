25|$|The unusual {{length of}} Thackeray's cricket career (for a Cambridge University cricketer) {{may have been}} <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> {{apparent}} change in direction. Thackeray graduated as a Bachelor of Arts in 1840, and the following year as a Bachelor of Medicine, having been in receipt {{of one of the}} Tancred scholarships endowed at Gonville and Caius for aspiring medical doctors. He did not practise as a doctor, however, and in 1844 he was ordained as a Church of England deacon, becoming a priest in 1845. He was a curate at a church in Stockport from 1844 to 1846 (which explains his appearance for Manchester Cricket Club in 1845) and then from 1847 to his death in 1892 he was vicar of Shopland in Essex and curate at nearby Great Wakering.|$|E
25|$|Zindler's {{reports on}} KTRK also {{included}} international stories, many involving trips to various third-world countries; segments in which local business owners (known as Marvin's Angels) provided services {{to a less}} fortunate person in dire financial or physical health; and stories focused on the elderly, including nursing home abuse reports {{that are similar to}} his trademark restaurant reports. On his Friday reports, Zindler had also reported birthday and wedding anniversary greetings on air, usually involving those celebrating their 100th birthday or at least a 50th wedding anniversary. The station has stated that over 100,000 requests for help from Zindler were received yearly. In choosing stories, Zindler focused on two factors - neediness and chance of success. While low income was a key factor, being selected for a story had more <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> injustice than with income.|$|E
500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1958, Hoyland {{prompted}} controversy by offering the island to the American TV quiz show Bid 'n' Buy as a prize. After an outcry {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic, the show's producers settled for offering a car instead. In December 1960, he sold Stroma to James Simpson, an islander whose family had moved to farm on the mainland near the Castle of Mey in 1943. Simpson had not originally intended to buy the island but happened to be talking about it with a lawyer: [...] "I said, 'I see Stroma was sold last week, and it's not sold this week. Is it on the market?' 'Yes,' he said, 'Stroma's for sale.' I said, [...] "What kind of money?" [...] So he told me what kind of money, and there and then, the lawyer wrote that I, James Simpson, offered to buy the island of Stroma at a certain figure, and I signed my name at the end of it." [...] His wife was not enthusiastic about the purchase: [...] "Lena nearly flew at me for being so stupid. She says, 'Stroma? What on earth are you going <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> island?'". He was successful in his bid and used the island to graze his animals, repopulating it with around 200 sheep and 30 cattle.|$|E

2500|$|In 2005, Type O Negative left Roadrunner Records. Steele {{had never}} been happy with the {{conditions}} of the recording contract and had described it as [...] "a millstone around my neck". Steele alleged that Type O Negative's split from Roadrunner Records, aside from a poor offer, had <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> unauthorized release of a [...] "best of" [...] compilation. Steele remained on friendly terms with the staff at Roadrunner Records and in October 2005 he appeared on the Roadrunner United album to help celebrate the label's 25th anniversary.|$|E
2500|$|In all {{the above}} {{examples}} {{the case of}} the subject of the infinitive is governed by the case requirements of the main verb and [...] "the infinitive is appended as a third argument" [...] (Concerning the second and third examples, in modern linguistic terms we have <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> object control construction). As fas as the two first are concerned, traditionally this construction is sometimes called (in Latin terminology) dativus cum infinitivo or genitivus cum infinitivo (dative with the infinitive or genitive with the infinitive respectively) and {{is considered to be a}} case attraction, the dative or genitive being used instead of a predicate in the accusative: see also below.|$|E

Few will care that they died in a vicious assault {{that had nothing to do}} with stereotyping, Stand Your Ground self-defense, weak gun laws, insufficient federal civil-rights legislation, or any of the other causes of interracial violence falsely advanced by the attorney general—but quite a lot <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> urban culture that for unspoken reasons has spawned an epidemic of disproportionate violent crime on the part of young African-American males." ...|$|E

2500|$|Wolfe {{displays}} a pronounced, almost pathological, dislike {{for the company}} of women. Although some readers interpret this attitude as simple misogyny, various details in the stories, particularly the early ones, suggest it has more <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> unfortunate encounter in early life with a femme fatale. It is not women themselves that he dislikes: rather, it is what he perceives as their frailties, especially a tendency to hysterics — to which he thinks every woman is prone. [...] "In the all-male Wolfe household that is an apparent bulwark of men's-club solidarity, Wolfe's misogyny is part pose, part protection, but above all, a shrewd tool of detective strategy," [...] wrote critic Molly Haskell. [...] "Archie does the romancing while Wolfe prods and offends, winnowing out the traitorous and brattish women and allowing the cream, the really great women, {{to rise to the}} top. ... We deduce from the glow of those special women who do earn the detective's good will just how discriminating and interested an observer of womankind the author is." [...] These women include Clara Fox (The Rubber Band), Lily Rowan (introduced in Some Buried Caesar), Phoebe Gunther (The Silent Speaker) and Julie Jaquette (Death of a Doxy).|$|E
