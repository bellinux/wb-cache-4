Mothers {{can recognize}} their babies by smell, and newborns also recognize their mothers {{in the same way}} before the development of other senses. It is also <b>the</b> <b>most</b> mysterious <b>sense</b> among all, but people are often unaware of what our nose tells us. Although our nose does not work as precise as other animals, it is still possible to utilize our sense of smell for gathering information of our surrounding and registering memorable events.

25|$|SGML {{specified}} a syntax {{for including}} the markup in documents, {{as well as}} one for separately describing what tags were allowed, and where (the Document Type Definition (DTD) or schema). This allowed authors to create and use any markup they wished, selecting tags that made <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>sense</b> to them and were named in their own natural languages. Thus, SGML is properly a meta-language, and many particular markup languages are derived from it. From the late '80s on, most substantial new markup languages have been based on SGML system, including for example TEI and DocBook. SGML was promulgated as an International Standard by International Organization for Standardization, ISO 8879, in 1986.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, Transit New Zealand {{noted that}} its 10-year plan, {{at that time}} being {{consulted}} on, would include funding for another study into a second harbour crossing. This study was declared to include the possibility of landing a future tunnel underneath the Tank Farm, with a connecting tunnel to south of Victoria Park. Costs are estimated at NZ$3 billion. Some commentators like Brian Rudman have noted {{that it would make}} <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>sense</b> to keep the new crossing for public transport only, possibly to connect with a rail tunnel to Britomart Transport Centre. This statement was largely supported by North Shore City mayor George Wood, who noted that public transport provision on the new crossing (including the possibility for light rail or heavy rail to connect to Britomart) had been part of North Shore City Council's plans for many years.|$|E

500|$|Many of {{the lyrics}} discuss love, forgiveness, and regret with, {{according}} to Larson, [...] "a sense that beyond tectonic heartbreak there is an anaemic acceptance that is kind of beautiful if you don't get too sad about it." [...] Several critics felt the lyrics were coloured by Yorke's recent separation from his partner of almost 25 years, Rachel Owen, noting that the backmasked vocals of [...] "Daydreaming", when reversed, resemble the words [...] "half of my life". Spencer Kornhaber of the Atlantic was hesitant to describe A Moon Shaped Pool as Yorke's [...] "breakup album", but wrote that it [...] "makes <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>sense</b> when heard as a document of a wrenching chapter for one human being." [...] Other themes include climate change on [...] "The Numbers" [...] and the dangers of authority and groupthink on [...] "Burn the Witch".|$|E
500|$|Case {{said she}} was unconcerned about the storyline because the writers had a plan to explain Sharon's behavior. New head writer Josh Griffith told TV Guide that the {{character}} would reach a [...] "total mental breakdown", which would {{take her to the}} edge and beyond before being rebuilt. Griffith said the breakdown would help her find salvation, with a [...] "stronger, more together, more evolved Sharon" [...] emerging. Sharon breaks down at the main house of the Newman ranch, burning it down while under the influence of alcohol. Griffith stated that the damage Sharon has done to the Newman family is [...] "physical, professional and emotional". After seeing a doctor, Sharon is diagnosed with bipolar disorder and begins treatment; however, she is alarmed after discovering she must take prescribed medication, possibly {{for the rest of her}} life. Case was happy with the outcome of the storyline, as were viewers of the show. In January 2013, she told Soap Opera Uncensored, [...] "When Sharon battled her emotional problems, that also took a lot of work but in a different way. Playing someone who is bipolar is very exhausting but it worked out perfectly and explained all of Sharon’s past behavior. I applaud Josh for making that decision because I think it makes <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>sense</b> considering her history." [...] The actress in addition was pleased that she didn't have to continue justifying Sharon's questionable actions.|$|E

Opting to release the EP instead [...] "made <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>sense</b> as far as where we were and what we wanted to do". To support its release, the group appeared on a number of Warped Tour dates, as well as touring with Amber Pacific. Gaskarth revealed the band was aiming to enter the recording studio in the winter.

2500|$|Kierkegaard's magnum opus Either/Or was {{published}} 20 February 1843; {{it was mostly}} written during Kierkegaard's stay in Berlin, where he took notes on Schelling's Philosophy of Revelation. Either/Or includes essays of literary and music criticism {{and a set of}} romantic-like-aphorisms, as part of his larger theme of examining the reflective and philosophical structure of faith. Edited by [...] "Victor Eremita", the book contained the papers of an unknown [...] "A" [...] and [...] "B" [...] which the pseudonymous author claimed to have discovered in a secret drawer of his secretary. Eremita had a hard time putting the papers of [...] "A" [...] in order because they were not straightforward. [...] "B"'s papers were arranged in an orderly fashion. Both of these characters are trying to become religious individuals. Each approached the idea of first love from an esthetic and an ethical point of view.
