5|$|Barkley's message {{sparked a}} great public {{debate about the}} nature of role models. He argued, I think the media demands that athletes be role models because there's some jealousy involved. It's as if they say, this is a young black kid playing a game for a living and making all this money, so we're going to make it tough on him. And what they're really doing is telling kids <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> someone they can't become, because not many people can be like we are. Kids can't be like Michael Jordan.|$|E

5|$|Later that night, Hancock is shot {{twice in}} the chest and wounded when he foils a liquor store robbery. After being hospitalized, Mary enters and {{explains}} that as each pair of immortals pair up, they begin to lose their powers and live out the remainder of their lives as ordinary humans, growing old and eventually dying. She then begins to point out various scars that Hancock has acquired over the centuries, the result of his normally heroic nature. She also explains that Hancock was savagely attacked in an alley 80 years prior, which caused his amnesia. In each instance, Mary chose to leave him in order for him to regain his powers and recover from his injuries. However, upon discovering he had no memory, Mary couldn't handle it and left. The conversation is interrupted when the hospital is raided by Red Parker, and two men that Hancock had humiliated during his incarceration. Mary is caught in the cross-fire and is mortally wounded. Hancock is able to stop and kill the two men but suffers additional injuries in the process. When Red attempts to finish Hancock off, Ray comes to the rescue and kills the bank robber with a fire axe. With Mary dying, Hancock flees the hospital so their parting will allow her to heal with her own powers. He makes several clumsy leaps away from the hospital, each of longer distance and duration as his powers slowly return, until he finally is able to fly off into the night. He later takes up residence in New York City. Ray is seen walking with Mary and their son discussing historical events such as the reign of Attila the Hun in a jovial manner. In gratitude to Ray, Hancock has painted Ray's All-Heart logo on the moon and calls the spokesperson <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> view the worldwide advertisement.|$|E

Ian eventually forgives Michelle but Martin still refuses to speak to her. Michelle attempts to find work in schools, without any luck. Stacey invites Michelle to a family meal but Martin says Michelle is only pretending to care about her family, and tells her {{that she is not}} the big sister he used <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>to.</b> Michelle starts community service and hears that Tim wants a divorce, and she tries to avoid the issue. Eventually, Martin and Michelle start to talk again but he is still angry that she has behaved like a teenager.

The nation continued <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> him for intellecual leadership, but, in his later years, lacking hope himself, he could not stimulate others or use to advantage the powers conferred upon him. In politics he remained a constitutional Liberal of the old type, and, for him, the people were the middle classes in opposition to the lower, which he saw to have been the supporters of tyranny in all ages, while he considered radicalism to mean a return via anarchy to absolutism. However, though he conducted political propaganda campaigns in the press in his early days, Herculano never exercised much influence in politics.|$|E

Black Zero is a gentically altered human clone of Superman (just as Kon-El was from 1993 to 2003) that has successfully grown to adulthood after Superman dies {{at the hands}} of Doomsday. For a time, he acts as the new Superman, even calling himself Superman 2. He exhibits both Superman's abilities as well as Superboy's tactile telekinesis.

25|$|Then {{came the}} rematch with Bowe on November 6, 1993. In what is {{considered}} by many sporting historians {{as one of the most}} bizarre moments in boxing's history, during round seven the crowd got off their feet and many people started to run for cover and yell. Holyfield took his eyes off Bowe for one moment and then told Bowe <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the skies. What they saw was a man in a parachute flying dangerously close to them. The man almost entered the ring, but his parachute had gotten entangled in the lights and he landed on the ropes and apron of the ring, and he was then pulled into the crowd, where he was beaten by members of Bowe's entourage. Bowe's pregnant wife, Judy, fainted and had to be taken to the hospital from the arena. Twenty minutes later, calm was restored and Holyfield went on to recover his world heavyweight titles with a close 12 round majority decision. The man who parachuted down to the middle of the ring became known as The Fan Man and the fight itself became known as the Fan Man Fight. His victory over Bowe that year helped Holyfield being named as ABC's Wide World of Sports Athlete of the Year for 1993.|$|E

[...] Lecrae never met his father, who ended up becoming a drug addict. In the song [...] "Good, Bad, Ugly", Lecrae reveals that when he was almost eight, a female baby sitter sexually molested him, an incident which Lecrae believes distorted his view of sexuality, influencing his later promiscuous lifestyle. Experiencing abuse and neglect during his childhood, Lecrae used his ability to rap as a source of significance. According to Lecrae, his grandmother would not allow him to watch rap music videos on television, but he would sneak in late at night. It was in these videos that Lecrae found individuals <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>to.</b> Lecrae states that [...] "there were no Martin Luther Kings or Malcolm Xs, they had all passed away so I had Tupac."

Lecrae remembers taking a BB gun and standing in the street pointing it to a car, frightening the female driver, simply for fun. At 11 years old, he started writing music for a rhythm and blues group formed by some neighbors. His first track, written for a neighborhood crush, emulated the style of Tupac, Outkast, and A Tribe Called Quest. At the age of 16, he started taking drugs, fighting, was arrested in high school for stealing, and eventually ended up on a gang list.

Johns also explained that the episode might also see {{the introduction of the}} second Blue Beetle Ted Kord. He admitted that his choice in which comic book character to introduce was based solely on his personal preference, as he is a fan of Blue Beetle and Booster Gold and has a history of writing for those characters. These introductions will come at a time when Clark needs to have interactions with the characters to [...] "propel him forward". He noted that the two characters embody what Clark needs to learn: being in the public eye and fully accepting his alien heritage. Johns pointed out that Booster Gold is all about being in the spotlight, while Clark is not. At the same time, Blue Beetle is trying to understand the alien technology he has been given. Johns also stated that Booster's introduction will serve to show Clark that society needs a hero <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>to.</b>|$|E
