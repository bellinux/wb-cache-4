In fact, global warming is the evolution, the natural evolution, of that early eugenics program." [...] Voris said, [...] "Hitler adopted the American eugenic ideals and implemented them throughout his Nazi regime. Hitler did not originate the idea of eugenics and creating a superior Aryan race. It was indeed an American concept. He saw this happening in America, and went 'Ah-ha' and grabbed it and incorporated it into his whole Nazi philosophy." [...] Voris held that governments accepting the concept of global warming might limit availability of energy, cutting off those who [...] "exceed what Washington says is your limit [...] you can either be charged an exorbitant fine or perhaps have your energy supply limited or even cut off. ...If you think the government interfering in private lives to this extent based on junk science and the hysteria surrounding it just isn't possible... <b>think</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> tens of thousands of citizens who were sterilized against their will by the government in state after state after state. ...And remember the only thing that brought the eugenics movement to an end was the horror of the Nazi death camps.

She was probably better known to Jack Goring than to myself. All I was sure of was that she had been known to both of us. Jack and I had first met at Cambridge.

Jack had never been a 'lady's man' precisely; but, as he used to say, comparing himself with me, 'he had a heart.' The annals of our Cambridge days were searched in vain. I tried the country house in which he and I had spent a good many of our vacations. Suddenly I remembered the reading-party in Devonshire--but no, she was dark. Once Jack and I had a romantic adventure in Glencoe in which a lady and her daughter were concerned. We tried {{to make the most of}} it; but in our hearts we knew, after we had seen her by the morning light, that the daughter was not beautiful. Then there was the French girl at Algiers. Jack had kept me hanging on in Algiers a week longer than we meant to stay. The pose of the head, the hands clasped behind it, a trick so irritatingly familiar to me--was that the French girl? No, the lady I was struggling to identify was certainly English. I'm sure you're asleep.|$|E

With Brown, it's substance over style; he's a career politician, who has spent his life working to help people.

50|$|Carsten {{asks her}} to <b>think</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> moment when Tyrell {{was murdered by}} Batty, {{highlighting}} several unexplained discrepancies in the movie. His claim is that Batty did not ever plan to have his lifespan extended. That was only an excuse, {{to allow him to}} get close to Tyrell. Batty came back to Earth to kill Eldon Tyrell, and for no other reason. And not just to kill Tyrell, but to kill him in a very specific way - by crushing his eyes. Carsten opens the eyelids of each of the duplicates, revealing that there are no eyes in any of them. The eyes, the windows of the soul, were also the key to transferring a gestalt between multiple replicants without error; and Batty destroyed Tyrell's. Batty's goal was to get revenge on Tyrell for consigning him to a life of slavery in the colonies, but he was aided by the UN, who had realised that Tyrell had discovered the key to eternal life.|$|E
50|$|Lucretius {{identifies}} the supernatural {{with the notion}} that the deities created our world or interfere with its operations in some way. He argues against fear of such deities by demonstrating, through observations and arguments, that the operations of the world can be accounted for in terms of natural phenomena. These phenomena are the regular, but purposeless motions and interactions of tiny atoms in empty space. Meanwhile, he argues against the fear of death by stating that death is the dissipation of a being's material mind. Lucretius uses the analogy of a vessel, stating that the physical body is the vessel that holds both the mind (mens) and spirit (anima) of a human being. Neither the mind nor spirit can survive independent of the body. Thus Lucretius states that once the vessel (the body) shatters (dies) its contents (mind and spirit) can no longer exist. So, as a simple ceasing-to-be, death can be neither good nor bad for this being. Being completely devoid of sensation and thought, a dead person cannot miss being alive. According to Lucretius, fear of death is a projection of terrors experienced in life, of pain that only a living (intact) mind can feel. Lucretius also puts forward the 'symmetry argument' against the fear of death. In it, he says that people who fear the prospect of eternal non-existence after death should <b>think</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> eternity of non-existence before their birth, which probably did not cause them much suffering.|$|E

While the daughter happily eats the ramen, the mother is horrified, as she <b>thinks</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> days when ramen was eaten exclusively to ward off hunger. The idea of eating it in prosperous times mortifies the mother, a theme that is found in poems and music from this period, which were recited on the radio.|$|R

40|$|Try to <b>think</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{time that}} your parents were your age and imagine the tech-nological {{developments}} {{that have taken}} place since then. Sometimes {{it is hard to imagine}} that only 2 decades ago personal computers, mobile phones, compact disks (CD) players, and digital video disks (DVD) players did not exist. What made these technological developments possible? One of the major contributing factors is micro-electronics. The first breakthrough from electronics to microelectronics was the in-vention of the transistor in 1947 at Bell laboratories. Transistors provided a better, cheaper alternative to mechanical relays, which were the standard electronic compo-nent for switching and modulating electronic signals. With improving semiconduc-tor technology, transistors became progressively smaller, cheaper, and better. A sec-ond breakthrough was the introduction of the integrated circuit in 1959, by which numerous transistors and other electronic components together with the necessary wiring were organized on a thin silicon disk or wafer. In 1965, only 4 years after the introduction of the integrated circuit, Gordon Moore predicted an exponential growth of the number of transistors in an integrated circuit (Moore’s Law).
