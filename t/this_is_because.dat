5|$|<b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> land {{birds in}} high {{northern}} latitudes, where food becomes scarce in winter, leave for areas further south (including the Southern Hemisphere) to overwinter, {{and because the}} continental landmass is much larger in the Northern Hemisphere. In contrast, among (pelagic) seabirds, species of the Southern Hemisphere {{are more likely to}} migrate. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> there is a large area of ocean in the Southern Hemisphere, and more islands suitable for seabirds to nest.|$|E
5|$|Cats may bite humans when provoked, during play or when aggressive. Complications from cat bites can develop. A cat bite {{differs from}} the bites of other pets. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> the teeth of a cat are sharp and pointed causing deep punctures. Skin usually closes rapidly over the bite and traps {{microorganisms}} that cause infection.|$|E
5|$|Deserts, both hot and cold, {{play a part}} in moderating the Earth's temperature. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> {{they reflect}} more of the {{incoming}} light and their albedo is higher than that of forests or the sea.|$|E

5|$|Even though Opera Mini {{is based}} on the same {{rendering}} engine as Opera for personal computers, it does not pass the Acid2 test. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> Opera Mini intentionally reformats web pages to try to make them more suitable for devices with small screens.|$|E
5|$|For the Internet, the {{physical}} medium and {{data link protocol}} can vary several times as packets traverse the globe. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> the Internet places no constraints on what physical medium or data link protocol is used. This leads {{to the adoption of}} media and protocols that best suit the local network situation. In practice, most intercontinental communication will use the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) protocol (or a modern equivalent) on top of optic fiber. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> for most intercontinental communication the Internet shares the same infrastructure as the public switched telephone network.|$|E
5|$|In the Laud Troy Book, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> Achilles {{almost killed}} Troilus in the {{previous}} fight but the Trojan was rescued.

5|$|Ionization of acids is less in an acidic solvent than in water. For example, {{hydrogen}} chloride is a weak acid when dissolved in acetic acid. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> acetic acid {{is a much}} weaker base than water.|$|E
5|$|Isotopes of hafnium and {{lutetium}} (along with ytterbium) {{are also}} used in isotope geochemistry and geochronological applications. It is often used as a tracer of isotopic evolution of Earth’s mantle through time. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> 176Lu decays to 176Hf with a half-life of approximately 37 billion years.|$|E
5|$|Manasa is an {{especially}} important deity in Bengal for the mercantile castes. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> Chando of the Manasamangal {{was the first to}} initiate her worship, and Behula, the heroine of the Manasamangal was a daughter of the Saha clan (a powerful trading community).|$|E

5000|$|On 6 December, the Swiss bank PostFinance {{announced}} that it had frozen the assets of Assange that it holds, totalling €31,000. In a statement on its website, it stated that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> Assange [...] "provided false information regarding his place of residence" [...] when opening the account. WikiLeaks released a statement saying <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> Assange, [...] "as a homeless refugee attempting to gain residency in Switzerland, had used his lawyer's address in Geneva for the bank's correspondence".|$|R

5|$|Most of the Sinhalese {{letters are}} curlicues; {{straight}} lines are almost completely {{absent from the}} alphabet. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> Sinhala used to be written on dried palm leaves, which would split along the veins on writing straight lines. This was undesirable, and therefore, the round shapes were preferred.|$|E
5|$|Most weekend SLE trains {{also run}} local {{westbound}} in the morning, then express in the afternoon, stopping only at Guilford and Westbrook between Old Saybrook and State Street. Eastbound service is reversed. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> Branford, Madison, and Clinton only have platforms on the eastbound track, and thus switching {{is needed to}} platform a westbound train.|$|E

5|$|The blast {{furnaces}} {{used in the}} Imperial Smelting Process ("ISP") were developed from the standard lead blast furnace, but are fully sealed. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> the zinc produced by these furnaces is recovered as metal from the vapor phase, {{and the presence of}} oxygen in the off-gas would result in the formation of zinc oxide.|$|E
5|$|The {{cast for}} Planet B {{comes from the}} Radio Drama Company, a {{repertory}} radio company. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> they cost nothing to use and the budget for the show is small. The cast of the Radio Drama Company changes around every six months, which means that cast of Planet B changes every series.|$|E
5|$|The duality {{represents}} a major advance {{in our understanding}} of string theory and quantum gravity. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> it provides a non-perturbative formulation of string theory with certain boundary conditions and because it is the most successful realization of the holographic principle, an idea in quantum gravity originally proposed by Gerard 't Hooft and promoted by Leonard Susskind.|$|E

5|$|The {{reliability}} of William Branham's primary source biographical material {{should be viewed}} with caution. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> Branham's autobiographical stories were often embellished, and sometimes contradictory. Other sources, written by his associates or followers, are apologetic and hagiographical in nature.|$|E
5|$|The {{standard}} connectors {{were designed}} to be more robust than many past connectors. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> USB is hot-pluggable, and the connectors would be used more frequently, and perhaps with less care, than previous connectors.|$|E
