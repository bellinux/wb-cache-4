5|$|The {{case against}} Martin falters as {{evidence}} disappears and witnesses fail to identify {{him in a}} line-up. Black is approached by Pepper, Martin's self-appointed lawyer, who extends Black an invitation to join his legal practice. Martin later claims in court to have killed Bletcher. Elsewhere, another Millennium Group member, Mike Atkins (Robin Gammell), receives {{a telephone call from}} someone pretending <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>Black.</b> Meanwhile, Black suspects that the occult-oriented murder may have been committed to draw the Group, and Black, into the open again.|$|E
5|$|The next day, June 25, Black Hawk's party {{encountered}} a militia battalion commanded by Major John Dement. In the Second Battle of Kellogg's Grove, Black Hawk's warriors drove the militiamen inside their fort and commenced a two-hour siege. After losing nine warriors and killing five militiamen, Black Hawk broke off the siege {{and returned to}} his main camp at Lake Koshkonong. This would prove <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>Black</b> Hawk's last military success in the war. With his band running low on food, he decided to take them back across the Mississippi.|$|E
5|$|During a total solar eclipse, the Moon's shadow covers {{only a small}} {{fraction}} of the Earth. The Earth continues to receive at least 92 percent of the amount of sunlight it receives without an eclipse–more if the penumbra of the Moon's shadow partly misses the Earth. Seen from the Moon, the Earth during a total solar eclipse is mostly brilliantly illuminated, with only a small dark patch showing the Moon's shadow. The brilliantly-lit Earth reflects a lot of light to the Moon. If the corona of the eclipsed Sun were not present, the Moon, illuminated by earthlight, would be easily visible from Earth. This would be essentially the same as the earthshine which can frequently be seen when the Moon's phase is a narrow crescent. In reality, the corona, though much less brilliant than the Sun's photosphere, is much brighter than the Moon illuminated by earthlight. Therefore, by contrast, the Moon during a total solar eclipse appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>black,</b> with the corona surrounding it.|$|E

5|$|In 2007, Raimi {{expressed}} interest in portraying the transformation of Dr. Curt Connors into his villainous alter-ego, the Lizard, a villain which had been teased since Spider-Man 2; the character's actor Dylan Baker and producer Grant Curtis were also enthusiastic about the idea. By December 2009, John Malkovich was in negotiations to play Vulture and Anne Hathaway would play Felicia Hardy, though {{she would not have}} transformed into the Black Cat as in the comics but a new superpowered figure, the Vulturess. According to sources online, an early draft of the film would have had the Vulture buying out the Daily Bugle, forcing Spider-Man to kill him. Felicia Hardy, Vulture's daughter in this version of the script, would have had an affair with Peter Parker in order to shatter his engagement with Mary Jane. These rumors were never confirmed. Raimi stated years later during an interview in 2013, however, that Hathaway was going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>Black</b> Cat if Spider-Man 4 had been made.|$|E
5|$|The photo {{originated}} from a washed-out colour {{photograph of a}} dress posted on the social networking service Tumblr.

Although the actual colour of the dress was eventually confirmed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>black</b> and blue, the image prompted discussions surrounding the matter across various platforms, with users discussing their opinions on the colour and why they perceived the dress as being a certain colour. At the same time, members {{of the scientific community}} began to investigate the photo for fresh insights into human colour vision.|$|E
5|$|Black {{believes}} Prine is not {{driven by}} malice; he and Watts use {{the resources of}} the Millennium Group to find his home, discovering the dense writings across his floors. They learn that Prine believes a third world war is imminent, and took the children as he believes one of them is destined to bring peace during this time, wishing to protect this child when he learns which one it is destined <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> <b>Black</b> seeks aid from another Group member, Lara Means (Kristen Cloke), who is able to observe Prine's behavioural tells for clues when interviewing him. This, coupled with analysis of soil from his clothing, points to the children being held in an aluminium quarry. The investigators rush to the quarry, where Prine's accomplice engages them in a firefight. However, the advancing tornado forces them to take cover; it kills Prine and lifts the roof from the entombing bunker. It subsides as quickly as it arrived, and the children emerge safely from the wreckage; Black senses that Cayce's daughter may be the prophesied peacemaker. It turns out that the tornado destroyed the school where the children would have been if they weren't abducted, and that Prine had saved their lives.|$|E

5|$|In 2008, Raimi {{expressed}} interest in portraying the transformation of Dr. Curt Connors into his villainous alter-ego, the Lizard; the character's actor Dylan Baker and producer Grant Curtis were also enthusiastic about the idea. Raimi also discussed his desire to upgrade Bruce Campbell from a cameo appearance to a significant role, later revealed to be Quentin Beck / Mysterio. It was reported in December 2009 that John Malkovich was in negotiations to play Vulture and that Anne Hathaway would play Felicia Hardy, though {{she would not have}} transformed into the Black Cat as in the comics. Instead, Raimi's Felicia was expected to become a new superpowered figure called the Vulturess. However, several years later, in 2013, Raimi stated that Hathaway was going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>Black</b> Cat if Spider-Man 4 had been made.

25|$|Still, Kock {{managed to}} sign a {{contract}} on August 8 which granted him a 10 year lease of Île-à-Vache, {{with the right to}} an extension of a further 10 years. The rent was 3.5 Gourde (about $0.35) per hectare. He had to start operations within six months and a number of employee supervisors had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>black.</b> They would be immediately naturalized as Haitians upon arrival. Kock was to provide a percentage of all the wood that he chopped on the island, as a kind of tax. The contract also guaranteed that he would protect the Haitian state, and that he would not have to pay import duties on the supplies that he imported.|$|E
25|$|All Home Office {{police forces}} {{have access to}} air support, often {{in the form of}} helicopters. Some forces also have small fixed wing aircraft. Police Helicopters are {{required}} by the CAA to be marked in a standard 'high conspicuosity' paint scheme, to make them more visible and avoid the possibility of air proximity hazards with other low flying aircraft. This paint scheme, also used by UK military training helicopters, requires them <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>black</b> on the sides and underneath, and yellow on top. When seen from the ground, these helicopters are black but this is to make them more visible against the sky as a safety feature (and yellow against the ground when seen from above). One of the most common helicopters used by the police is the Eurocopter EC135.|$|E

When the study of Japanese dogs was formalized in the early and mid-20th century, these three strains were {{combined}} into one overall breed, the Shiba Inu. The first Japanese breed standard for the Shiba, the Nippo Standard, was published in 1934. In December 1936, the Shiba Inu was recognized as a Natural Monument of Japan through the Cultural Properties Act, {{largely due to the}} efforts of Nippo (Nihon Ken Hozonkai), the Association for the Preservation of the Japanese Dog.|$|E
25|$|What {{already has}} been {{observed}} directly in many systems are the lower non-relativistic velocities of matter orbiting further out from what are presumed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>black</b> holes. Direct Doppler measures of water masers surrounding the nuclei of nearby galaxies have revealed a very fast Keplerian motion, only possible with {{a high concentration of}} matter in the center. Currently, the only known objects that can pack enough matter in such a small space are black holes, or things that will evolve into black holes within astrophysically short timescales. For active galaxies farther away, the width of broad spectral lines can be used to probe the gas orbiting near the event horizon. The technique of reverberation mapping uses variability of these lines to measure the mass and perhaps the spin of the black hole that powers active galaxies.|$|E
25|$|By August 4, 1778, Proctor's Regiment counted only 220 men, so a {{few weeks}} later he applied to the Pennsylvania Council to enlist men from other states and it was granted. The {{regiment}} was finally accepted into the Continental Army on September 3. Until this time, the unit belonged to Pennsylvania even though it served with the Continental Army. There were frequent clashes between President Joseph Reed and Proctor over the matter of supplies. At this time Proctor demanded new uniforms which were supposed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>black</b> for the artillery, but he insisted on letting his officers wear blue coats. Reed complained to Washington and it was determined that Proctor officers must conform to the new uniform policy in the following year. Reed remarked that Proctor only recognized the authority of Pennsylvania when he needed a favor. On May 18, 1779 Congress finally commissioned Proctor as colonel in the Continental Army.|$|E
