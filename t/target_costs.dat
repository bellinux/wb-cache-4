50|$|<b>Target</b> <b>costing</b> is an {{approach}} to determine a product’s life-cycle cost which should be sufficient to develop specified functionality and quality, while ensuring its desired profit. It involves setting a <b>target</b> <b>cost</b> by subtracting a desired profit margin from a competitive market price. A <b>target</b> <b>cost</b> is {{the maximum amount of}} cost that can be incurred on a product, however, the firm can still earn the required profit margin from that product at a particular selling price. <b>Target</b> <b>costing</b> decomposes the <b>target</b> <b>cost</b> from product level to component level. Through this decomposition, <b>target</b> <b>costing</b> spread the competitive pressure faced by the company to product’s designers and suppliers. <b>Target</b> <b>costing</b> consists of cost planning in the design phase of production as well as cost control throughout the resulting product life cycle. The cardinal rule of <b>target</b> <b>costing</b> is to never exceed the <b>target</b> <b>cost.</b> However, the focus of <b>target</b> <b>costing</b> is not to minimize costs, but to achieve a desired level of cost reduction determined by <b>target</b> <b>costing</b> process.|$|R
40|$|The <b>target</b> <b>costing</b> {{process at}} most firms {{can be broken}} into three major steps. The first {{consists}} of market-driven costing, the second of product-level <b>target</b> <b>costing,</b> and the third of component-level <b>target</b> <b>costing.</b> To identify {{the factors that influence}} the <b>target</b> <b>costing</b> process at firms, an exploratory comparative analysis of the <b>target</b> <b>costing</b> processes at six Japanese manufacturing firms is undertaken. From this analysis, five factors are identified that play a role in influencing the <b>target</b> <b>costing</b> process by altering the levels of the benefits that the firms can derive from <b>target</b> <b>costing.</b> The factors that help shape market-driven costing include the intensity of competition {{and the nature of the}} customer. The factors that help define the benefits associated with product-level <b>target</b> <b>costing</b> include the firm’s product strategy and the characteristics of the product. Finally, the firm’s supplier-base strategy influences the benefits associated with component-level <b>target</b> <b>costing.</b> It is argued that it is these five factors that primarily determine the magnitude of the benefits that the firm will generate from the application of <b>target</b> <b>costing.</b> As the benefits increase, the amount of energy the firm is willing to expend on the <b>target</b> <b>costing</b> process is expected to increase concomitantly.

50|$|Supplier-Base {{strategy}} {{is the main}} factor that determines component-level target costing because it is known to {{play a key role}} in the details a firm has about its supplier capabilities. There are three characteristics that make up the supplier-base strategy, including the degree of horizontal integration, power over suppliers and nature of supplier relations. Horizontal integration captures the fraction of product costs sourced externally. Cost pressures on suppliers can drive target costing if the buying power of firms is high enough. In turn, this may lead to better benefits. More cooperative supplier relations have been shown to increase mutual benefits in terms of <b>target</b> <b>costs</b> particularly at a component level.|$|E

I find {{that there is a}} relatively moderate adoption rate of <b>target</b> <b>costing</b> (33. 3 per cent) in the PTE sector in New Zealand. More than half of these PTEs, which adopted <b>target</b> <b>costing</b> (referred as TC PTEs), have only a basic level of <b>target</b> <b>costing</b> implementation. This dissertation also identifies factors that contribute to a more complete implementation of <b>target</b> <b>costing</b> in PTEs, by empirically examining the association between eight identified factors and the completeness of <b>target</b> <b>costing</b> implementation. Five management techniques/tools (factors) {{have been found to be}} significantly associated with the completeness of <b>target</b> <b>costing</b> implementation: 1) top management support in the implementation of target costing; 2) cross-functional teams; 3) a structural reporting system; 4) performance rewards based on achievement of target costs; and 5) active participation of suppliers and other external stakeholders in the program development. This suggests PTEs with a higher level of <b>target</b> <b>cost</b> implementation are more likely to adopt these techniques/tools. This research also empirically examines the effect of the <b>target</b> <b>costing</b> adoption on cost reduction performance, quality level of services, and customer satisfaction level in the PTE context, as well as the impact of completeness of <b>target</b> <b>costing</b> implementation on these three aspects. The findings from this study suggest that the adoption of <b>target</b> <b>costing</b> has positive influences on cost reduction performance and quality level of services in PTEs. Moreover, the effectiveness of <b>target</b> <b>costing</b> in reducing cost also increases when the TC PTEs have a more complete <b>target</b> <b>costing</b> implementation...|$|R
40|$|<b>Target</b> <b>costing</b> is a cost {{management}} {{system designed to}} develop products {{with a level of}} profitability deemed adequate to justify their production. This paper examines whether production-related decisions made with <b>target</b> <b>costing</b> consistently add economic value to the firm. A traditional <b>target</b> <b>costing</b> model is compared to one that incorporates the cost of capital. An analysis of the two models reveals that the traditional <b>target</b> <b>costing</b> model systematically underestimates the marginal cost of invested funds and overestimates the marginal cost of cash-related production resources. A numerical example and graphical analysis demonstrate that a traditional <b>target</b> <b>costing</b> model can lead to accepting products that have a negative net present value, while rejecting products that have a positive net present value. Mathematical analysis of a traditional <b>target</b> <b>costing</b> model indicates that it is a systemic property of the model. <b>Target</b> <b>costing</b> Product cost Production-related decisions...|$|R

50|$|The {{first step}} is to set a product-level target cost. Since the {{allowable}} cost is simply obtained from external conditions without considering the design capabilities of the company as well as the realistic cost for manufacturing, it may not be always achievable in practice. Thus, it is necessary to adjust the unachievable allowable cost to an achievable target cost that the cost increase should be reduced with great effort. The second step is to discipline this target cost process, including monitoring the relationship between the target cost and the estimated product cost at any point during the design process, applying the cardinal rule so that the total <b>target</b> <b>costs</b> at the component-level does not exceed the target cost of the product, and allowing exceptions for products violating the cardinal rule. For a product exception to the cardinal rule, two analyses are often performed after the launch of the product. One involves reviewing the design process to find out why the target cost was unachieved. The other is an immediate effort to reduce the excessive cost to ensure that the period of violation is as short as possible. Once the target cost-reduction objective is identified, the product-level target costing comes to the final step, finding ways to achieve it. Engineering methods such as value engineering (VE), design for manufacture and assembly (DFMA), and quality function deployment (QFD) are commonly adopted in this step.|$|E

40|$|Cost {{estimation}} {{of new products}} has always been difficult as only few design, manufacturing and operational features will be known. In these situations, parametric or non-parametric methods are commonly used to estimate {{the cost of a}} product given the corresponding cost drivers. The parametric models use priori determined cost function where the parameters of the function are evaluated from historical data. Non-parametric methods, on the other hand, attempt to fit curves to the historic data without predetermined function. In both methods, it is assumed that the historic data used in the analysis is a true representation of the relation between the cost drivers and the corresponding costs. However, because of efficiency variations of the manufacturers and suppliers, changes in supplier selections, market fluctuations, and several other reasons, certain costs in the historic data may be too high whereas other costs may represent better deals for their corresponding cost drivers. Thus, it may be important to rank the historic data and identify benchmarks and estimate the <b>target</b> <b>costs</b> of the product based on these benchmarks.
