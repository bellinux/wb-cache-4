500|$|... "Stay Together for the Kids" [...] {{is written}} about divorce {{from the point}} of view of a {{helpless}} child. Its heavier sound was inspired by bands the group's members were listening to in the two weeks they wrote their fourth album, Take Off Your Pants and Jacket, such as Fugazi and Refused. Primarily written by guitarist Tom DeLonge, the song is biographical in nature. He and bassist Mark Hoppus were growing up when their parents divorced. For Hoppus, he was eight years old when he was sent to live with his father. [...] "The thing you realize as you get older is that parents don’t know what the hell they’re doing and neither will you when you get <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>parent.</b> You’ve just got to understand that people are human and they make mistakes," [...] he said. DeLonge remembered learning of his parents' divorce when he discovered scrape marks on the driveway of their home. [...] "Right then, I knew my dad had dragged out his furniture single-handedly," [...] he recalled. He spoke on the song's inspiration in 2001: ...|$|E

50|$|How <b>To</b> <b>Be</b> <b>A</b> Little Sod, <b>was</b> {{written in}} 1991 by author Simon Brett {{to show what}} a baby may think during his/her first year of development. The format <b>is</b> in <b>a</b> {{traditional}} diary style, listing selected days and events. The main character's name is never actually revealed in the story, the child <b>is</b> always referred <b>to</b> as 'baby.' We also do not find out the gender at any time, so readers can {{make up their own}} minds on these missing details. The book is written in the first person, referring as 'I' and shows the baby through their first year of life. The other characters include the mother, referred to as 'Her' and the father, known as 'Him.' There are also the two sets of grandparents, whose awkward get-togethers leave a chill in the air. The book covers a range of traditional development techniques, including the advancement to solid foods, learning to crawl and saying the first word. However, the book <b>is</b> not intended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>parents</b> guide. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> fictional book which uses realistic elements.|$|R

50|$|Despite the {{variation}} among the cultivars, authorities agree the citron <b>is</b> <b>an</b> old and original species.
