5|$|The current M-11 follows Remembrance Road, Wilson Avenue and 28th Street. The {{first two}} of these names were chosen to memorialize the roadway in honor of local people. Remembrance Road was {{dedicated}} in 1923 on the initiative of the {{local chapter of the}} Daughters of the American Revolution. They planted 231elms in a double row {{on each side of the}} highway and erected a boulder bearing a bronze plaque dedicated to the veterans of Kent County. Wilson Avenue was named for Samuel H. Wilson, a local realtor. He had developed a series of local residential subdivisions in the area up until his 1931 death, In 1942, the county road commission named Wilson Avenue in his honor <b>to</b> <b>comply</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> state law requiring roads that benefitted from state funds to have proper names.|$|E

25|$|For example, in {{industrial}} applications {{the weight of}} products coming off a production line may need <b>to</b> <b>comply</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> legally required value. By weighing some fraction of the products an average weight can be found, which will always be slightly different to the long-term average. By using standard deviations, a minimum and maximum value can be calculated that the averaged weight will be within some very high percentage of the time (99.9% or more). If it falls outside the range then the production process {{may need to be}} corrected. Statistical tests such as these are particularly important when the testing is relatively expensive. For example, if the product needs to be opened and drained and weighed, or if the product was otherwise used up by the test.|$|E
25|$|Another {{theme is}} {{confidentiality}} {{and this is}} an important principle in many nursing ethical codes. This is where information about the person is only shared with others after permission of the person, unless it is felt that the information must be shared <b>to</b> <b>comply</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> higher duty such as preserving life. Related to information giving is the debate relating to truth telling in interactions with the person in care. There is a balance between people having the information required to make an autonomous decision and, on the other hand, not being unnecessarily distressed by the truth. Generally the balance is in favour of truth telling due to respect for autonomy, but sometimes people will ask not to be told, or may lack the capacity to understand the implications. Finally, the role of empirical ethics has become prominent in recent years.|$|E
