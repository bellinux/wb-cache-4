Officially {{known as the}} 1.6L CamPro CFE, {{it is capable of}} producing power and <b>torque</b> <b>figures</b> of 138bhp (103kW) at 5,000 rpm and 205 N·m at 2,000–4,000 rpm respectively, comparable to a 2.0L naturally aspirated engine, while achieving better fuel efficiency and reduced greenhouse emissions.|$|E
25|$|The EL {{introduced}} {{only minor}} running {{changes to the}} Falcon's base model straight-six engine, {{when compared to the}} radical overhaul presented by the EF. The coil-pack ignition system introduced in the EF was rolled back to the distributor-style ignition from the ED Falcon due to reliability problems. A divided air induction pipe which led to the throttle was replaced with a single, wider pipe. Engine output remained unchanged at 157kilowatts (211hp) and 357newton metres (263ft·lbf). In October 1997, the V8 engine fitted to the XR8 sports model was upgraded from 170kilowatts (228hp) to 185 (248hp). <b>Torque</b> <b>figures</b> were also upped from 398newton metres (294ft·lbf) to 402 (296ft·lbf).|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{contributes}} {{to a better understanding}} of the design and analysis of a 12 S- 14 P three phase Outer Rotor Field Excitation Flux Switching Motor (OR-FEFSM) for direct-drive applications in Electric Vehicles (EV). Research work on the 12 S- 14 P inner-rotor FEFSM carried out by others have reported a maximum <b>torque</b> <b>figure</b> of 226. 12 Nm and a power output of 127. 61 kW. The research work carried out in this thesis focuses on the design and analysis a class of 12 S-nP three-phase Outer Rotor Field Excitation Flux Switching Motor (OR-FEFSM) configurations, where n is the number of poles of the motor. In particular, a total of five rotor pole configuration namely the 12 S- 10 P, 12 S- 14 P, 12 S- 16 P, 12 S- 20 P and 12 S- 22 P configuration were investigated. Performance analysis of the torque and power versus speed characteristics were carried out using the Finite Element Analysis (FEA) software developed by JMAG Designer, version 13. 0 which is able to calculate <b>torque</b> and power <b>figures</b> to six decimal places of accuracy. The optimum structure for ORFEFSM was identified by conducting an extensive search in 2 -D parameter space with constant diameter and stack length using the Deterministic Optimisation Method (DOM), which gives optimum output <b>torque</b> and power <b>figures</b> upon convergence. The simulation results obtained showed that 12 S- 14 P was the optimal rotor pole configuration where a <b>torque</b> <b>figure</b> of 221. 38 Nm and 186 kW power output was obtained, which is 5. 41 % greater than the targeted performance specifications.

40|$|Abstract. On the {{condition}} of line elastic and small deformation, more than 80 % failure of the drive shaft is due to fatigue damage. It relates to the alternating stress of the drive shaft under the combination effect of bending and twisting. When drive shaft is under the combination effect of bending and twisting for civil engineering, torsion shear stress is perpendicular to bending normal stress. They can’t be simply stacked. Combining with the belt conveyor tension device of the worm transmission, first, simplify the external force; do stress analysis in horizontal plane and vertical plane respectively. Then make corresponding bending moment figure and separately calculate the internal force, stress of each basic deformation and make comprehensive bending moment <b>figure</b> and <b>torque</b> <b>figure.</b> Then use the application of superposition principle, the fourth strength theory to calculate worm transmission’s strength.

40|$|The primary {{attitude}} control system on the International Space Station (ISS) {{is part of the}} United States On-orbit Segment (USOS) and uses Control Moment Gyroscopes (CMG). The secondary system is part of the Russian On orbit Segment (RSOS) and uses a combination of gyroscopes and thrusters. Historically, events with significant disturbances such as the airlock depressurizations associated with extra-vehicular activity (EVA) have been performed using the RSOS {{attitude control}} system. This avoids excessive propulsive "de-saturations" of the CMGs. However, transfer of attitude control is labor intensive and requires significant propellant. Predictions employing NASA's DSMC Analysis Code (DAC) of the disturbance torque to the ISS for depressurization of the Pirs airlock on the RSOS will be presented [1]. These predictions were performed to assess the feasibility of using USOS control during these events. The ISS Pirs airlock is vented using a device known as a "T-vent" as shown in the inset in figure 1. By orienting two equal streams of gas in opposite directions, this device is intended to have no propulsive effect. However, disturbance force and torque to the ISS do occur due to plume impingement. The disturbance torque resulting from the Pirs depressurization during EVAs is estimated by using a loosely coupled CFD/DSMC technique [2]. CFD is used to simulate the flow field in the nozzle and the near field plume. DSMC is used to simulate the remaining flow field using the CFD results to create an in flow boundary to the DSMC simulation. Due to the highly continuum nature of flow field near the T-vent, two loosely coupled DSMC domains are employed. An 88. 2 cubic meter inner domain contains the Pirs airlock and the T-vent. Inner domain results are used to create an in flow boundary for an outer domain containing the remaining portions of the ISS. Several orientations of the ISS solar arrays and radiators have been investigated to find cases that result in minimal disturbance <b>torque.</b> <b>Figure</b> 1 shows surface pressure contours on the ISS and a plane of number density contours for a particular case...|$|R
