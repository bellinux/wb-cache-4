5|$|A large {{percentage}} of the people killed by brain trauma do not die right away but rather days to weeks after the event; rather than improving after being hospitalized, some 40% of TBI patients deteriorate. Primary brain injury (<b>the</b> <b>damage</b> <b>that</b> occurs at the moment of trauma when tissues and blood vessels are stretched, compressed, and torn) is not adequate to explain this deterioration; rather, it is caused by secondary injury, a complex set of cellular processes and biochemical cascades that occur in the minutes to days following the trauma. These secondary processes can dramatically worsen the damage caused by primary injury and account for the greatest number of TBI deaths occurring in hospitals.|$|E
5|$|Deriving {{from the}} {{concepts}} of tabletop role-playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons, nearly all roguelikes give the player control of a character, which they may customize by selecting a class, race, and gender, and adjusting attributes points and skills. At {{the start of the}} game, the character is placed at the top-most level of a dungeon, with basic equipment such as a simple weapon, armor, torches, and food. Following along the role-playing concept of a dungeon crawl, the player moves the character through the dungeon, collecting treasure which can include new weapons, armors, magical devices, potions, scrolls, food, and in-game money, while having to fight monsters that roam the dungeon. Most combat is performed simply by attempting to move the character into the same space as the monster, which the game then calculates <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> <b>that</b> the character and monster deal. Other types of attacks, such as firing an arrow or performing an offensive magic spell, can often be performed as well.|$|E

5|$|During December 2011, GM {{conducted}} four crash {{tests of}} Volts with the reinforced steel and upgraded cooling system, resulting in no intrusion to the battery and no coolant leakage.

The NHTSA said “the preliminary results of the crash test indicate the remedy proposed by General Motors today should address the issue of battery intrusion” though its investigation remained open. General Motors declined to say how much the modifications would cost.|$|E
5|$|The American Smelting and Refining Company (ASARCO) funded Drinker to {{investigate}} the 1948 Donora smog, as the company {{had an interest in}} showing that its primary pollutants (sulfuric acid and sulfur dioxide) had not significantly contributed to the damage it caused. In the middle of 1953, Amdur and her husband developed a method of spraying a combination mist of sulfuric acid and sulfur dioxide into humid chambers containing guinea pigs {{to investigate}} <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> <b>that</b> it would cause to their lungs. Guinea pigs were used as they breathe more deeply through their mouths than smaller rodents which breathe through their noses. The Amdurs bought their own guinea pigs for the mini project, and spent a holiday weekend doing the investigation.|$|E
5|$|The Spartans {{were caught}} unawares by Pyrrhus' invasion. Areus {{had taken the}} {{majority}} of the Spartan army with him to Crete, where he was campaigning on behalf of Gortyn at the request of Ptolemaic Egypt. The result was that the settlement was lightly defended. Arriving at Sparta as night fell, Cleonymus advised Pyrrhus to attack the city immediately. However, the Epiriote declined to as he was fearful of <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> <b>that</b> would be wrought by Gallic troops if they entered the city at night and moreover expected the sparsely defended city to surrender in the morning.|$|E

5|$|While other spies such as Julius and Ethel Rosenberg and Klaus Fuchs {{were caught}} after the war, Koval {{apparently}} went unscrutinized for years. Among the reasons given for his maintained cover was that inter-service politics undermined efforts to perform proper security checks on employees. Another {{possibility is that}} the U.S. government chose scientific ability over clear records and political sympathies. In the 1950s, the FBI investigated his wartime activities and interviewed his former colleagues, leaving them {{with the impression that}} he might have been a spy.

Rejuvenation can be a means of life extension, but most life extension strategies do not involve rejuvenation.|$|E
