The fictional sisters live an old-fashioned life style and travel in a 1958 Morris Major between performances.

50|$|A typical toilet brush {{consists}} of a hard bristled end, usually with a rounded shape and a long handle. Today <b>toilet</b> <b>brushes</b> are commonly made of plastic, but were originally made of wood with pig bristles or from the hair of horses, oxen, squirrels and badgers. The brush is typically stored in a holder, {{but in some cases}} completely hidden in a tube.|$|E
50|$|Further {{development}} of the traditional <b>toilet</b> <b>brush</b> focus on the risk of germ incubation within the <b>brush</b> holder. A <b>toilet</b> <b>brush</b> has been patented which introduces a reservoir of anti-bacterial fluid, allowing the brush to be dipped and sanitized after each use.|$|R

50|$|In 1930 a British-based Addis Housewares Company {{created the}} first {{artificial}} Christmas tree made from brush bristles. The company used the same machinery that it used to manufacture <b>toilet</b> <b>brushes.</b> The trees were made from the same animal-hair bristles used in the brushes, save they were dyed green. For a time, the brush trees were immensely popular, with large numbers exported from Great Britain, where the trees also became popular. These brush trees offered advantages over the earlier feather trees. They could accept heavier ornamentation, and were not nearly as flammable.|$|E
5000|$|Protesters {{adopted the}} toilet brush as a satirical symbol of defiance, after a video was {{circulated}} depicting a hooded man having a toilet brush confiscated by police, and also organised a pillow fight in St. Pauli. The {{list of items}} confiscated by police in the 'danger zones' was described in a news report as [...] "rather lean and whimsical", including not only a truncheon, clubs, and a pocket knife but shawls and a plastic bucket. An unknown number of <b>toilet</b> <b>brushes</b> were noted but not taken from their owners.|$|E
50|$|Generally the <b>toilet</b> <b>brush</b> is {{used with}} toilet cleaner or bleach. The <b>toilet</b> <b>brush</b> {{can be used}} to clean the upper area of the toilet, around the bowl. However, it cannot be used to clean very far into the toilet's U-bend and should not be used to clean the toilet seat.|$|R

Helen is skinny but is considered unattractive in relation to Miracle.

30|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} whether German websites of companies promoting disinfectants to private users are communicating the principles of a responsible use correctly.

40|$|The {{epidemiology}} {{of hospital}} infections due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa was investigated by pyocin typing. The typing method, which determined the pyocin activity of clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa on 27 indicator strains, was 43. 7 % reproducible, but elimination of 9 indicator strains doubled the reproducibility and yielded more readable pyocin inhibition zones. Seventy-eight of 1, 084 isolates (7. 2 %) were untypable. In {{the second part}} of the study, P. aeruginosa was isolated from 110 patients (5. 4 % of all admissions) in a 3 -month period and typed with the revised method. Twenty pyocin types were identified, 10 of which were obtained from five or more patients. P. aeruginosa was isolated from 45 of 353 environmental samples, including water fountains, ice machines, bar soaps, and germicide solutions for <b>toilet</b> <b>brushes.</b> Twenty percent of the environmental samples were untypable but, among typable strains, the five most common environmental strains were the same as the strains most frequently isolated from patients. The organism was frequently isolated from noses (39 %), throats (39 %), and stools (29 %) of patients with P. aeruginosa infections or colonizations in urine, sputum, surgical wounds, or skin lesions. Six of eight patients had P. aeruginosa in their tracheostomy wounds. Autoinfections by strains already acquired on carrier sites may be significant...|$|E
40|$|Urine {{separation}} is a complementary function to the sewage system. Some {{people believe that}} it {{is the best way to}} close the cycle of nutrients between urban and rural areas. In order to study the experiences of the users of urine separating sewage systems an inquiry was made among such users in five different housing districts. Three districts were equipped with the DS-toilet from WM-Ekologen AB. The other two districts were equipped with the toilet Dubbletten from BB-Innovation & Co AB. In the inquiry the users were asked about odour, cleaning, design of the toilets and how they handled toilet paper after urination. Other questions treated the users opinion of urine separation toilets and the future of the system. A purpose of the inquiry was to find out how often the urine pipe got blocked, what the blockages consisted of and how hard they were to clear. The inquiry showed that urine separation toilets smelled just a little more then conventional ones. Some families had initially had large odour problems. This was often a result of faulty installation and when the installation was fixed, the odour had disappeared. However, a few families still found that the urine separating toilets smelled somewhat more than conventional ones. The difference was small and thus odour was not a large problem. Of the two studied urine separating toilets, one required more cleaning and one less than a conventional toilet. One problem was that faeces frequently got stuck onto the porcelain. The flushing of the urine bowl of the toilet did not function well on either of the toilets. This should not be difficult to improve, but product development is required. The users were asked to grade their confidence in a future expansion of urine separating sewage systems using grades from one to six. Grade one meant that the system did not have a future and grade six meant that it would become widespread. The average grades of the users in the different districts were between 4,l an 4, 6. The majority was also positive to having urine separating toilets in their homes, average grades were above 5, 4 in all districts except one, Palsternackan, where the average was 4, 9. The most serious problem with the urine separating toilets was the frequent blockages of the urine pipe on the toilet itself. Most of the blockages, 77 % of the ones studied, originated from hair or straws from <b>toilet</b> <b>brushes.</b> These blockages were easy to clear. However, there were also a few blockages that were impossible to clear with our equipment. These blockages consisted of a hard precipitation containing large proportions of phosphorus, calcium, magnesium and, where the urine pipe was of copper, also copper. The inquiry showed that after 4 000 estimated toilet usages only three households, out of 96, had not had any blockage of the urine pipe. In two districts the pipes of the urine sewage system were further investigated. Where the pipe had a diameter on ll 0 mm and a slope of 1 cm per meter, there was almost no sludge in the pipes and no sign of any future blockage problem. Pipes with a diameter of 50 mm and pipes with less slope than l % contained much sludge. The sludge was easy to flush away with water. We regret that it was not possible to make any observation of pipes with diameters between 50 and 110 mm having a l % slope...|$|E
