5|$|In 2002 the {{researchers}} Pelham, Mirenberg, and Jones explored Casler's first explanation, arguing {{that people have}} a basic desire {{to feel good about}} themselves and behave according to that desire. These automatic positive associations would influence feelings about almost anything associated with <b>the</b> <b>self.</b> Given the mere ownership effect, which states that people like things more if they own them, {{the researchers}} theorised that people would develop an affection for objects and concepts that are associated with <b>the</b> <b>self,</b> such as their name. They called this unconscious power implicit egotism. Uri Simonsohn suggested that implicit egotism only applies to cases where people are nearly indifferent between options, and therefore it would not apply to major decisions such as career choices. Low-stakes decisions such as choosing a charity would show an effect. Raymond Smeets theorised that if implicit egotism stems from a positive evaluation of <b>the</b> <b>self,</b> then people with low self-esteem would not gravitate towards choices associated with <b>the</b> <b>self,</b> but possibly away from them. A lab experiment confirmed this.|$|E

50|$|Self-schemas do not {{necessarily}} only involve individual traits. People self-categorize at different levels that range from more personal to more social. Self-schemas have three main categories which play a role: <b>the</b> personal <b>self,</b> <b>the</b> relational <b>self,</b> and <b>the</b> collective <b>self.</b> <b>The</b> personal <b>self</b> deals with individual level characteristics, <b>the</b> relational <b>self</b> deals with intimate relationship partners, and <b>the</b> collective <b>self</b> deals with group identities, relating to self-important social groups to which one belongs (e.g., one's family or university).

40|$|The self-system {{consists}} of three fundamental components: <b>the</b> individual <b>self,</b> <b>the</b> relational <b>self,</b> and <b>the</b> collective <b>self.</b> All selves are important and meaningful and all are associated with psychological and physical health benefits.

5|$|Kitayama and Karasawa {{concluded}} that the patterns in the findings from both experiments were most consistent with {{the hypothesis that the}} preference is due to an attachment to <b>the</b> <b>self.</b> These feelings leak out to stimuli that are closely associated with <b>the</b> <b>self,</b> not just names and birthdates, but also, implicitly, their constituent letters and numbers.

5|$|Bilinguals {{using two}} {{different}} alphabets should demonstrate a name-letter effect in both alphabets.

40|$|This is {{the first}} part of a two-part article that offers a {{theoretical}} and an empirical model of the everyday life information needs of urban teenagers. The qualitative methodology used to gather data {{for the development of the}} models included written surveys, audio journals, written activity logs, photographs, and semistructured group interviews. Twenty-seven inner-city teens aged 14 through 17 participated in the study. Data analysis took the form of iterative pattern coding using QSR NVivo 2 software (QSR International, 2002). The result-ing theoretical model includes seven areas of urban teen development: <b>the</b> social <b>self,</b> <b>the</b> emotional <b>self,</b> <b>the</b> reflective <b>self,</b> <b>the</b> physical <b>self,</b> <b>the</b> creative <b>self,</b> <b>the</b> cognitive <b>self,</b> and <b>the</b> sexual <b>self.</b> <b>The</b> researchers con-clude that the essence of teen everyday life information seeking (ELIS) is the gathering and processing of infor-mation to facilitate the teen-to-adulthood maturation process. ELIS is self-exploration and world exploration that helps teens understand themselves and the social and physical worlds in which they live. This study shows the necessity of tying youth information-seeking research to developmental theory in order to examine the reasons why adolescents engage in various infor-mation behaviors...|$|R
2500|$|Shame is a painful, social {{emotion that}} can be seen as {{resulting}} [...] "...from comparison of <b>the</b> <b>self's</b> action with <b>the</b> <b>self's</b> standards...". but which may equally stem from comparison of <b>the</b> <b>self's</b> state of being with the ideal social context's standard. Thus, shame may stem from volitional action or simply self-regard; no action by the shamed being is required: simply existing is enough. Both the comparison and standards are enabled by socialization. Though usually considered an emotion, shame may also variously be considered an affect, cognition, state, or condition.|$|R

5|$|In {{psychological}} assessments, the name-letter {{effect has}} been exploited to measure self-esteem. There {{are two types of}} self-esteem: explicit self-esteem (a person's deliberate and conscious evaluation of themselves) and implicit self-esteem.

40|$|Those {{learners}} {{who generally}} struggle {{to relate to}} their teachers and peers, also appear to struggle with their parents. This research study is thus {{an investigation into the}} influence of the parent-child relationship on the self-concept of the Southern Sotho child. A literature study was done and the major dimensions of the self-concept were identified, namely, <b>the</b> physical <b>self,</b> <b>the</b> academic <b>self,</b> <b>the</b> social <b>self,</b> <b>the</b> value <b>self,</b> <b>the</b> family <b>self</b> and <b>the</b> psychic <b>self.</b> A questionnaire was developed to measure the self-concept of the child. Another questionnaire was used to measure the parent-child relationship. The results of the empirical investigation indicated that the parent-child relationship does have an influence on the self-concept of the Southern Sotho child, although certain contradictions to other research findings emerged. Problematic aspects of the research were discussed and recommendations for further research were made. Educational StudiesM. Ed. (Guidance and Counseling...|$|R
