5000|$|There are {{a variety}} of common {{chelating}} agents with differing affinities for different metals, physical characteristics, and biological mechanism of action. For the most common forms of heavy metal intoxication [...] - [...] lead, arsenic, or mercury [...] - [...] a number of chelating agents are available. Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) has been recommended for the treatment of lead poisoning in children by poison control centers around the world. Other chelating agents, such as 2,3-dimercaptopropanesulfonic acid (DMPS) and alpha lipoic acid (ALA), are used in conventional and alternative medicine.

Calcium-disodium EDTA and DMSA are only approved for the removal of lead by the Food and Drug Administration while DMPS and TTFD are not approved by the FDA. These drugs bind to heavy metals in the body and prevent them from binding to other agents. They are then excreted from the body.

Material and Methods: A total of 139 participants were included in the study, i. e., occupationally exposed dental professionals, students of the 3 rd, 4 th and 6 th year of dental medicine, and occupationally unexposed dental patients. They were patch-tested with methacrylic monomers and formaldehyde. The results were subjected to statistical analysis (p < 0. 05). Results: From the allergic to formaldehyde students of the 3 rd and 4 th year of dental medicine, 46. 2 % were also sensitized to MMA. Among the group of patients, the incidence of cross-sensitization to formaldehyde and methacrylic monomers was as follows: to TEGDMA – 20. 6 %, to ethyleneglycol dimethacrylate – 20. 7 %, to 2 -HEMA – 20. 7 % and to <b>tetrahydrofurfuryl</b> methacrylate – 24. 1 %. Contact allergy to MMA was diagnosed among 22. 7 %, and to TEGDMA – among 27. 1 % of the students of the 3 rd and 4 th year of dental medicine.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Boston UniversityWhen tertrahydrofurfuryl alchohol {{is passed}} over alumina at {{temperatures}} between 300 and 360 degrees celcius a unique rearrangement occurs. Instead {{of a simple}} dehydration of the alcohol, a ring expansion is observed. The product is dihydropyran. If {{it is assumed that}} the first step involves the removal of the hydroxyl group from the <b>tetrahydrofurfuryl</b> alcohol by the alumina to give a carbonium ion, then shift of the heterocyclic oxygen atom followed by loss of a proton would give the six-membered ring product, dihydropyran. It is also possible that instead of the oxygen atom migrating the carbon atom at the 3 -position of the <b>tetrahydrofurfuryl</b> alcohol might shift to the external methylene carbon. Loss of a proton would also give dihydropyran. The path of the rearrangement can be followed if <b>tetrahydrofurfuryl</b> alcohol labeled with carbon- 14 in the external methylene group is utilized. If the heterocyclic oxygen shifts the resulting dihydropyran will be labeled at the 2 -position. On the other hand, if the 3 -carbon atom shifts the dihydropyran will be labeled at the 3 -position.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine whether the polymerisation shrinkage of Bis-GMA-based resins would be lower if alternative monomethacrylate co-monomers were used in place of conventional dimethacrylate co-monomers as viscosity modifiers. Conventional resins used were ethyleneglycol dimethacrylate and triethyleneglycol dimethacrylate; the alternative monofunctional co-monomers were <b>tetrahydrofurfuryl</b> methacrylate, hydroxypropyl methacrylate and isobornyl methacrylate. Model resins containing 54 % mol/mol of co-monomer in Bis-GMA and 1 % w/w of benzoyl peroxide as initiator were heat-cured at 70 degrees C for 8 h. Polymerisation shrinkage, degree of conversion and concentration of remaining methacrylate groups were calculated from density changes obtained gravimetrically.
