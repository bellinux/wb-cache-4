40|$|In this work, {{we study}} the energy <b>transfer</b> {{mechanism}} <b>from</b> ZnO nanocrystals (ZnO-nc) to Eu 3 + ions by fabricating thin-film samples of ZnO-nc and Eu 3 + ions {{embedded in a}} SiO 2 matrix using the low-cost sol-gel technique. The time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements from the samples were analyzed to understand the contribution of energy <b>transfer</b> <b>from</b> the various ZnO-nc emission centers to Eu 3 + ions. The decay time obtained from the TRPL measurements was {{used to calculate the}} energy <b>transfer</b> efficiencies <b>from</b> the ZnO-nc emission centers, and these results were compared with the energy <b>transfer</b> efficiencies calculated <b>from</b> steady-state photoluminescence emission results. The results in this work show that high <b>transfer</b> efficiencies <b>from</b> the excitonic and Zn defect emission centers is mostly due to the energy <b>transfer</b> <b>from</b> ZnO-nc to Eu 3 + ions which results in the radiative emission from the Eu 3 + ions at 614 nm, while the energy <b>transfer</b> <b>from</b> the oxygen defect emissions is most probably due to the energy <b>transfer</b> <b>from</b> ZnO-nc to the new defects created due to the incorporation of the Eu 3 + ions...|$|R
