5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata in six movements, {{an opening}} choral fugue, alternating arias and recitatives and closing chorale. He scored {{the work for}} four vocal soloists, a four-part choir and a festive Baroque instrumental ensemble of three trumpets and timpani, two oboes, strings and continuo. The oboes and strings play with <b>the</b> <b>voices</b> <b>in</b> motet style in the choral sections, while the trumpets add {{the style of a}} new time. The cantata is part of Bach's Picander cycle.|$|E
5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata in six movements, first alternating arias and recitative, then uniting <b>the</b> <b>voices</b> <b>in</b> recitative and aria, {{finally a}} chorale.

5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata in six movements. The {{text and}} tune of the hymn are {{retained in the}} outer choral movements, a chorale fantasia and a four-part closing chorale, which frame two sets of recitative and aria. Bach scored the work for four vocal soloists (soprano, alto, tenor, bass), a four-part choir, and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of four trombones (Tb), two oboes (Ob), two violins (Vl), viola (Va) and basso continuo. This {{is one of three}} Bach cantatas to use four different trombone parts (soprano, alto, tenor, and bass), the others being Ach Gott, vom Himmel sieh darein, BWV 2 and Ich hatte viel Bekümmernis, BWV 21. The instruments play colla parte with <b>the</b> <b>voices</b> <b>in</b> the outer movements in the style of Bach's motets.|$|E

5|$|In the {{following}} table of the movements, the scoring and keys follow the Neue Bach-Ausgabe for the version performed in 1724, which is in B minor, uses oboes d'amore in the first movement and brass playing colla parte with <b>the</b> <b>voices</b> <b>in</b> the last movement, a choir of cornett (Ct) and three trombones (Tb) (or trumpets (Tr)). According to the Bach scholar Alfred Dürr, the audition version of 1723 had no reinforcement by brass, matching the scoring of the other audition piece. The originally composed version, which was not performed until 1728, was in C minor, had oboes in the opening movement and no brass. The time signatures are taken from the book on all cantatas by the Bach scholar Alfred Dürr, using the symbol for common time (4/4). The continuo, played throughout, is not shown.|$|E
5|$|Just {{like the}} player's pilot, {{most of the}} other {{characters}} are low-key. The non-player character Admiral Aken Bosch, however, plays a crucial part in moving the story. As a prominent antagonist from the start, he sparks off a rebellion which escalates the scale of action, and brings in the other antagonist force, the Shivans, into the story. The storytelling took on a character-driven approach with expositions taking the form of cutscenes in which Bosch gives out monologues, revealing the purpose and driving forces behind his actions. A few established voice actors were brought in to give a polished touch to <b>the</b> <b>voices</b> <b>in</b> the game. Academy Award nominee Robert Loggia voiced the player's commanding officer, Admiral Petrarch, and Admiral Bosch was voiced by Ronny Cox. Kurtwood Smith and Stephen Baldwin participated in bit roles as well.|$|E

While the trumpets are independent, the strings and oboes mostly double <b>the</b> <b>voices</b> <b>in</b> the style of Bach's motets. The first trumpet even plays the fugue theme. The Bach scholar Alfred Dürr argues that the work is probably no new composition but the reworking of an older lost movement, which forms the basis of both this movement and the later second part of the Credo of this music to the Mass in B minor, [...] ( [...] almighty father, maker of Heaven and Earth).

Bach scored the work in eight movements for four vocal parts and a festive Baroque orchestra of three trumpets, timpani, two oboes, strings, an obbligato organ and basso continuo. The organ dominates the first movement Sinfonia which Bach derived from a Partita for violin. The full orchestra accompanies the first choral movement and plays with <b>the</b> <b>voices</b> <b>in</b> the closing chorale, while a sequence of three arias alternating with two recitatives is scored intimately.|$|E
500|$|The text of {{the first}} movement, [...] "" [...] (Jesus {{gathered}} the Twelve to Himself) is a quotation of two verses from the prescribed Gospel for the Sunday (...) [...] The movement is a scene with different actors, narrated by the Evangelist (tenor), in which Jesus (bass, as the [...] or voice of Christ) and his disciples (the chorus) interact. An [...] "ever-ascending" [...] instrumental [...] "evokes {{the image of the}} road of suffering embodied by going up to Jerusalem". The Evangelist begins the narration (...) [...] Jesus announces his future suffering in Jerusalem, [...] ("Behold, we go up to Jerusalem"). He sings, while the ritornello is played several times. After another repeat of the ritornello as an interlude, a choral fugue illustrates the reaction of the disciples, following verse 34 from the Gospel (...) : [...] ("However they understood nothing"). The voices are first accompanied only by the continuo, then doubled by the other instruments.

A revision occurred during the Köthen years, specifically in 1720.

As [...] in Leipzig, Bach {{performed the}} cantata again on his third Sunday in office on 13 June 1723, as the title page shows. For this performance, now of eleven movements beginning again in C minor, he also changed the instrumentation, adding for example four trombones to double <b>the</b> <b>voices</b> <b>in</b> the second stanza of the hymn.

500|$|During the revolution, {{there was}} an orgy of {{violence}} committed against the South Asian and Arab communities with thousands of women being raped by the Okello's followers, much looting and massacres of Arabs all over the island. The American diplomat Don Petterson described the killings of Arabs by the African majority {{as an act of}} genocide. Petterson wrote [...] "Genocide was not a term that in the vogue then, as it came to be later, but {{it is fair to say}} that in parts of Zanzibar, the killing of Arabs was genocide, pure and simple". Okello, an eccentric, power-crazed man with a taste for cruelty frequently went on the radio to urge his followers in thunderous Old Testament language to kill as many Arabs as possible, with the maximum of brutality. As a Pan-African nationalist who made his followers sing [...] "God Bless Africa" [...] whenever he marched through the streets, Okello appealed to the black majority, but at same time, as a militant Christian who claimed to hear the voice of God in his head, Okello's appeal on an island whose population was 95% Muslim was limited. It was only discontent with the Arabs that gave Okello any sort of mass support, and once the government was overthrown, most of the Muslim Africans gave their loyalty to the mainstream black politicians, and shunned the bloodthirsty Okello who presented himself as a messianic figure ordered by <b>the</b> <b>voices</b> <b>in</b> his head (which Okello said were messages from God) to liberate Africa for Jesus Christ. Okello claimed that Christ was an African and that Africa was God's special continent.|$|E
500|$|Rutter {{inserted}} {{an anonymous}} English poem from the 15th century, Of a Rose, a lovely Rose, {{as the second}} movement.

She {{is seen as a}} rose bush with five branches: the Annunciation, the Star of Behlehem, the three Kings, the fall of the devil's power, and heaven. The last stanza asks Mary to “shield us from the fiendes bond”. The eight stanzas, in four lines of which three rhyme, are set as variations of an old tune. The short refrain is first sung by the soprano alone, immediately repeated by soprano, alto and tenor, <b>the</b> <b>voices</b> <b>in</b> unison but for triads on [...] "lovely". It is repeated after the first stanza by soprano and tenor in unison. After the fourth stanza, it appears again, now in three different parts, and a last time before the final prayer, again slightly different. The first stanza ("... this rose began to spring ...") is sung by the bass, the second ("... out of her bosom ...") by the alto, the third ("... an angel from heaven's tower ...") by two sopranos and alto, the fourth ("... star shone over Bethlehem ...") by tenor and bass, the fifth ("... three kinges ...") by the bass, the sixth ("... sprang to hell ...") by four parts SATB, the seventh ("... sprang to heaven ...") by soprano and alto, the final prayer ("Pray we to her ...") by four parts again but mostly in unison.|$|E
