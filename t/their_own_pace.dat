5|$|In 1960, ACS began {{screening}} {{applicants for}} high intellectual potential, requiring a tested IQ above 120, achievement test results {{one and a}} half grade levels above national norms in reading and math, and intensive in-person evaluations. At the same time, the teachers began adapting the curriculum to meet the goals of a gifted program, allowing even more differentiation for each student, accommodating different learning styles, and incorporating enough flexibility for all students to progress at <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>pace.</b>|$|E
5|$|Defeating monsters earns the {{character}} experience points, and after earning enough points, {{the character}} will gain an experience level, improving their hit points, magic capability, and other attributes. Monsters may drop treasure to be looted. On the other hand, the character dies {{if they lose}} all their hit points. As most roguelikes feature the concept of permadeath, this represents {{the end of the}} game, and the player will need to restart the game with a newly made character. Roguelikes are nearly always turn-based, with the game only reacting when the player makes an action with the character. This allows players to evaluate a difficult situation, such as being cornered by several monsters, at <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>pace</b> and determine the best strategy.|$|E

5|$|The Albany Free School is {{the oldest}} independent, inner-city {{alternative}} school in the United States. Founded by Mary Leue in 1969 based on the English Summerhill School philosophy, the free school lets students learn at <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>pace.</b> It has no grades, tests, or firm schedule: students design their own daily plans for learning. The school is self-governed through a weekly, democratic all-school meeting run by students in Robert's Rules. Students and staff alike receive one equal vote apiece. Unlike Summerhill-style schools, the Albany Free School is a day school that serves predominantly working-class children. Nearly 80 percent of the school is eligible for reduced-price meals in the public schools. About 60 students {{between the ages of}} three and fourteen attend, and are staffed by six full-time teachers and a number of volunteers.|$|E
5|$|Augie March {{returned}} to the studio in 2004 to record a follow-up to Strange Bird. The band worked with two producers, Paul McKercher and Eric Drew Feldman, and recorded in Melbourne, San Francisco, and their own studio in Nagambie, Victoria. Donovan said it was more suited to the band's style; as they co-produced on all their albums, they took {{a great deal of}} interest in production. He said it also enabled them to work at <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>pace,</b> hence the four-year gap between releases. They released a DVD, Drones & Vapid Ditties, containing live performances and music videos, in mid-2004. The band's upcoming album, according to Triple J, was inspired by the streets of Melbourne. Upon completion of the initial recording sessions of Moo, You Bloody Choir, there was a six-month delay before release, as Augie March meticulously added finishing touches to it. In March 2006, the album was finally released.|$|E
5|$|Midtown Madness {{features}} 4 single-player modes: Blitz, Circuit, Checkpoint, and Cruise. In Blitz, {{the player}} must swing through 3 checkpoints {{and drive to}} the finish line within a time limit. The Circuit mode curtains off most of the city to resemble race tracks and pits the player against other cars. The Checkpoint mode combines the features of Blitz and Circuit has the player race against other cars to a destination—but also adds the complication of other traffic, such as police cars and pedestrians. In the Cruise mode, the player can simply explore the city at <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>pace.</b> All of these modes except Cruise are divided into missions; completing one unlocks the next. Environmental conditions that traverse all modes include weather (sunny, rainy, cloudy, and snowy), time of day (sunrise, afternoon, sunset, and night-time), and the density of pedestrians, traffic, and police vehicles. The heads-up display includes, alongside information about the race, a detailed map, but this display can be turned off.|$|E
50|$|Atrioventricular block (AV block) {{is a type}} {{of heart}} block in which the {{conduction}} between the atria and ventricles of the heart is impaired. Under normal conditions, the sinoatrial node (SA node) in the atria sets the pace for the heart, and these impulses travel down to the ventricles. In an AV block, this message does not reach the ventricles or is impaired along the way. The ventricles of the heart have <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>pacing</b> mechanisms, which can maintain a lowered heart rate in the absence of SA stimulation.|$|R
2500|$|Accordingly, the schoolroom was {{equipped}} with child-sized furnishings, [...] "practical life" [...] activities such as sweeping and washing tables, and teaching material that Montessori had developed herself. Children were given freedom to choose and carry out <b>their</b> <b>own</b> activities, at <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>paces</b> and following <b>their</b> <b>own</b> inclinations. In these conditions, Montessori {{made a number of}} observations which became the foundation of her work. First, she observed great concentration in the children and spontaneous repetition of chosen activities. She also observed a strong tendency in the children to order <b>their</b> <b>own</b> environment, straightening tables and shelves and ordering materials. As children chose some activities over others, Montessori refined the materials she offered to them. Over time, the children began to exhibit what she called [...] "spontaneous discipline".|$|R

5|$|The {{game has}} the player {{controlling}} the main character, Amaterasu, in a woodcut, watercolor style, cel-shaded environment, {{which looks like}} an animated Japanese ink-illustration (known as ink wash painting, sumi-e) with other styles of art. The gameplay style {{is a mix of}} action, platform, and puzzle gaming genres, and has been noted by many reviewers to have numerous similarities in overall gameplay style to The Legend of Zelda series, an inspiration that director Hideki Kamiya, a self-proclaimed Zelda-fan, has admitted has influenced his general game design. The main story is primarily linear, directed through by Amaterasu's guide Issun, though numerous side quests and optional activities allow for players to explore the game world and take the story at <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>pace.</b> By completing quests, side quests and small additional activities (such as making trees bloom into life or feeding wild animals), Amaterasu earns Praise, which can then be spent to increase various statistics of the character, such as the amount of health and number of ink wells for Celestial Brush techniques.|$|E

25|$|Self-pacing methods, {{such as the}} Montessori Method, use {{flexible}} grouping {{practices to}} allow children to advance at <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>pace.</b> Self-pacing can be beneficial for all children and is not targeted specifically at those identified as gifted or talented, but it can allow children to learn at a highly accelerated rate. Directed Studies are usually based on self-pacing.|$|E
25|$|Some Neo-Marxists {{believe that}} it would {{actually}} be best for periphery countries to cut all economic and political ties with the core countries. This would, in their opinion, allow the periphery countries to develop and industrialize at <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>pace</b> instead of being exploited and driven by core countries demands. Doing this would allow these countries to spend their money on industrializing and bettering themselves, rather than importing goods from core countries. It also would allow these countries to become more independent from the core countries, causing them to move to semi-peripheral status.|$|E
25|$|The {{first week}} of the second term of the {{academic}} year used to be dedicated to eLearning. During this week, lessons and materials would be disseminated online for students to study at <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>pace,</b> and students were not required to attend school. The programme was initiated in 1999 but scrapped in 2006. Since then, e-learning has been integrated into the school calendar. It is often used by teachers during holidays during term time, for instance on Staff Training Days during term time when students are not required to attend lessons; instead, teachers attend courses held in the campus.|$|E

25|$|The System offers {{courses of}} study for {{undergraduate}} and postgraduate diplomas and degrees {{to more than}} 50,000 students around the world. A designated constituent institution of the University of London, called the 'lead college', creates materials to allow students to study at <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>pace.</b> Examinations take place at testing centres {{around the world on}} specified dates. Hallmarks of the programme are its low cost in comparison to attendance in London, and the possibility of pursuing either full-time or part-time study. As stated in the University of London Statutes, International Programmes students are graded on the same standard as internal students to ensure a uniform credentialing process. A student who completes a course of study under the programme is awarded a University of London degree with a notation specifying which lead college provided the instruction.|$|E
25|$|One of Montessori's many accomplishments was the Montessori method. This is {{a method}} of {{education}} for young children that stresses {{the development of a}} child's own initiative and natural abilities, especially through practical play. This method allowed children to develop at <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>pace</b> and provided educators with a new understanding of child development. Montessori's book, The Montessori Method, presents the method in detail. Educators who followed this model set up special environments {{to meet the needs of}} students in three developmentally-meaningful age groups: 2–2.5 years, 2.5–6 years, and 6–12 years. The students learn through activities that involve exploration, manipulations, order, repetition, abstraction, and communication. Teachers encourage children in the first two age groups to use their senses to explore and manipulate materials in their immediate environment. Children in the last age group deal with abstract concepts based on their newly developed powers of reasoning, imagination, and creativity.|$|E
25|$|The Netflix {{model has}} also {{affected}} viewers' expectations. According to a 2013 Nielsen survey, more than 60% of Americans said they binge-watch shows and nearly {{eight out of}} 10 Americans have used technology to watch their favorite shows on their own schedule. Netflix has successfully continued to release its original content by making the whole season available at once, acknowledging changing viewer habits. This allows audiences to watch episodes {{at a time of}} their choosing rather than having to watch just one episode a week at a specific scheduled time; this effectively gives its subscribers freedom and control over when to watch the next episode at <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>pace.</b> Netflix has capitalized on these habits by automatically playing the next episode in the series, removing the 15-second wait times of content on other streaming services. The structure that allows convenient viewing of episodes, as well as the intent to provide content of quality comparable to some broadcast and cable television programs, in effect often results in the viewer being hooked into the program by the time the next episode starts.|$|E
50|$|Using {{specially}} designed dual-electroencephalogram recordings, Tognoli {{and her colleagues}} tested the brain activity of two people simultaneously performing continuous finger motion. Initially, two {{subjects were asked to}} rhythmically wag their fingers at <b>their</b> <b>own</b> preferential <b>pace,</b> but were prevented from seeing each other's hands. Then the barrier placed between them was then removed, so they could see each other while continuing to wag their fingers. When subjects were allowed to see one another's fingers moving, they sometimes adjusted <b>their</b> <b>own</b> movements and synchronized, and sometimes they did not, behaving independently.|$|R
50|$|In {{the third}} subsection, Marx {{discusses}} how mechanization influences {{the intensification of}} labor. Although {{the introduction of the}} Factory Acts limited the allowable length of the work day, it did nothing to halt the drive for more efficiency. Control over workers' tools is transferred to the machine, which prevents them from setting <b>their</b> <b>own</b> work <b>pace</b> and rhythm. As the machines are continuously adapted and streamlined, the effect is an ever-increasing intensification of the laborer's work activity.|$|R
50|$|Mapleton-Minto and Durham went {{on runs of}} <b>their</b> <b>own</b> to keep <b>pace</b> {{with the}} Winterhawks, and while {{they were able to}} defeat the 81's on the second-to-last game of the season, it was {{sandwiched}} around losses to Durham and the Ripley Wolves, which allowed Durham to finish in 1st place.|$|R
25|$|The game {{contains}} a central hub level, the Royal Train Station, and four additional levels that the player travels to through the Train Station. Each level was designed {{with a number}} of puzzles that allowed the player to approach in any order, while keeping the level size small and uncomplicated to prevent the player from becoming lost. Most of the puzzles have been designed with multiple solutions; Petty stated they wanted to cater to both the casual player, who may only want to find one of the solutions to progress in the game, and the more dedicated player, who would likely spend time to discover all of the intended solutions. This was furthered by allowing the player to freely roam through previously-completed areas to complete all the puzzles, including after completing the main story. The puzzles and challenges were designed {{to be able to be}} completed in short segments, giving the player more freedom to play it at <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>pace.</b> Petty wanted to make sure the player had time to contemplate the puzzles or explore the environment in a manner of older adventure games, though still assured that his environments felt alive and animated. The levels themselves are designed using a mix of the Great Depression and Victorian era designs, using virtual household items such as marbles and safety pins, an inspiration that came from interest in dioramas and miniature stages. The game itself presents cutscenes with dialog in the fashion of early silent films, where a text plaque is shown to show the dialog after it is acted out and scene takes place on a theater stage.|$|E
500|$|The {{house and}} grounds {{are open to}} the public and are run by SMBC.

Events and club meetings are held in the house and grounds throughout the year, and local schools often visit to experience life in a particular era. The house is licensed for wedding and civil partnership ceremonies, and has been used as a background for television series and films, including Prank Patrol, Cash in the Attic, Coronation Street, [...] "The Making of a Lady" [...] and The Last Vampyre.|$|E
500|$|The {{time zone}} used on board Mir was Moscow Time (...) [...] The windows were covered during night hours {{to give the}} {{impression}} of darkness because the station experienced 16 sunrises and sunsets a day. A typical day for the crew began with a wake-up at 08:00, followed by two hours of personal hygiene and breakfast. Work was conducted from 10:00 until 13:00, followed by an hour of exercise and an hour's lunch break. Three more hours of work and another hour of exercise followed lunch, and the crews began preparing for their evening meal at about 19:00. The cosmonauts were free to do as they wished in the evening, and largely worked to <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>pace</b> during the day.|$|E

40|$|Learning {{how to use}} a {{qualitative}} research method is a challenging task that is often made more difficult by contested definitions and descriptions of the method in question. How should novice researchers deal with methodological debates and disagreements within the research community when attempting to employ a contested research method for <b>their</b> <b>own</b> study? <b>Pace</b> explores this question using two qualitative methods as examples: grounded theory and autoethnography. This chapter considers why grounded theory and autoethnography qualify as contested concepts while unpacking their procedures and the controversies that surround them. Suggestions for negotiating debates about contested research methods are drawn from the experiences of research students and supervisors...|$|R
500|$|The {{music for}} Silver Star Story Complete {{consists}} of entirely new background themes by Noriyuki Iwadare. While Hiroshi Fujioka, Isao Mizoguchi, and Yoshiaki Kubodera collaborated with Iwadare on the Sega CD version, only Iwadare would {{return for the}} remake, composing nearly one hundred new songs. When creating the music for Silver Star Story Complete, Iwadare drew from his own experiences, admitting {{that he was trying}} to put a personal touch on his work and [...] "express [...] through [...] honest emotions". Music director Isao Mizoguchi claims that the music process was [...] "a little different" [...] than the companies' previous works, with the game's main themes being composed before they viewed the scenes that required them, making adjustments as they went along. [...] Each song was divided into four categories: town or village, dungeon, battle, or field; each with <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>pacing</b> and emotional direction. [...] Iwadare described the game's music as [...] "very well received" [...] according to fan feedback. The Japanese version features a new opening theme, [...] "Tsu·Ba·Sa" [...] (TSU・BA・SA, lit. Wings) performed by Kyōko Hikami. [...] An intermediary song, , also called [...] "The Boat Song", was added to the game to heighten the emotion of Alex and Luna's departure into the world, which was kept at Mizoguchi's insistence even as material was being cut for time.|$|R
