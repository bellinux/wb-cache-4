5|$|The spiral {{staircase}} {{to the second}} floor is original. The floor continues the two-room design, and the roof, largely a post-war replacement with only a few surviving medieval timbers, is intended to resemble the original medieval design. <b>The</b> <b>fireplace</b> <b>and</b> windows are original, as probably is the 14th-century wooden door to the floor. Both the wall between the two rooms, and its stone doorway, were built in the 18th century. The room contains a display {{on the history of the}} tower, and some of the original wooden foundations of the building.|$|E
5|$|According to legend, Sherwood's sons put {{her body}} near <b>the</b> <b>fireplace,</b> <b>and</b> a wind {{came down the}} chimney. Her body {{disappeared}} amid the embers, with the only clue being a cloven hoofprint. Sherwood lies in an unmarked grave under some trees in a field near the intersection of Pungo Ferry Road and Princess Anne Road in Virginia Beach. Stories about the Devil taking her body, unnatural storms, and loitering black cats quickly arose after her death, and local men killed every feline they could find; this widespread killing of cats might have caused the infestation of rats and mice recorded in Princess Anne County in 1743. Her home on Muddy Creek stood for over 200 years. After being burned {{several times in the}} 20th century by vandals, all that was left in 2002 were the brick chimneys, which were bulldozed in November 2002. All that remains are a few bricks and part of the foundation, which is overgrown. The property is now owned by the Federal Government as part of Back Bay National Wildlife Refuge.|$|E

25|$|Floo powder can be {{used with}} any {{fireplace}} connected to the Floo Network. To transport from one to another, the fire at the point of departure must first be lit. The traveler throws a handful of Floo powder into the flames, turning them emerald green, then steps into <b>the</b> <b>fireplace</b> <b>and</b> states the intended destination in a clear and purposeful voice. Floo powder can also be used for communication; a wizard or witch can kneel in front of <b>the</b> <b>fireplace</b> <b>and</b> stick their head into the fire, which will then appear in the fire of the destination fireplace, leaving the witch or wizard free to talk. It is also known that other body parts may be transported via Floo Powder, as Umbridge almost catches Sirius the second time he converses with Harry through the Floo network. Voices can also be transmitted through the Floo Network, as seen in the Prisoner of Azkaban by Snape, who summons Lupin through his office's fireplace while interrogating Harry about the Marauder's Map.|$|E
25|$|According to the {{memoirs of}} Drue Tartière, Dolores and Tudor Wilkinson were both heavily {{involved}} in the resistance.

25|$|Sala Azul (Blue Room), {{which is}} not {{actually}} blue, is covered in white and gold silk walls and drapery, with matching chairs and cushioned sofa over a parquet floor. Between 1863 and 1865, it was remodelled by Possidónio da Silva {{in order to provide}} a Royal sitting room in the tastes of Queen Maria Pia. Avant-garde for its time it included visual effects that proportioned the space, including two grand mirrors on opposite walls (one over <b>the</b> <b>fireplace</b> <b>and</b> the other between two windows) and a Romanesque arch opening that extends the gaze of the Blue Room into the neighbouring Gabinete de Carvalho annex.|$|E
25|$|A custom {{to use a}} {{domestic}} animal as a polaznik was kept in some regions until {{the first half of}} the 20th century. A sheep, ox, swine, or calf was led into the house on Christmas morning. In the west Serbian region of Rađevina, centered on the town of Krupanj, the head of household would place a sheep between himself and <b>the</b> <b>fireplace,</b> <b>and</b> pronounce the aforementioned words while striking the badnjak with a branch cut from it. In the region of Bihor, north-eastern Montenegro, a round loaf of bread with a hole in its center was prepared; four grooves were impressed into its surface along two mutually perpendicular diameters of the loaf. After an ox was led into the house, the loaf was put on his horn, and some grain was thrown on the ox. Yanking his head, the ox would throw off the loaf; having fallen down, the loaf would break into four pieces along the grooves. The pieces were picked up and distributed among the family members. This custom was preserved up to the 1950s even in some Muslim families of the region. Ethnologists consider that the animal polažajnik is more ancient than the human one.|$|E
25|$|Papak was {{the grand}} priest {{of the temple}} of Anahita in Istakhr {{and the father of}} Ardashir, the founder of the Sasanian house, with the {{beginning}} of whose reign religion sat on the Persian throne. Papak's religious credit might have helped him in taking the power from Gochihr, then Persian governor who had no interest in following the religion of fire. In a scratched picture, Papak and his son Shapur are shown on a wall in Takht-e Jamshid; in the picture, Papak and Shapur both wear the same helmet similar to that of Shapur I's in his coins; in the picture, Shapur is visualized in the dual place of shah-priest in a way that he squeezes the hilt of his sword by one hand and manipulates the fire in <b>the</b> <b>fireplace</b> <b>and</b> adds woods by the other hand; and Shapur, son of Papak, squeezes his sword by one hand and takes a ring having a ribbon which is the royal symbol by the other hand on horseback. In his coins, Ardashir, who replaces his brother Shapur as the ruler of Pars in 220, wears the same crown as Shapur's, from the front however, and the picture of his father Papak is drawn behind. Zoroastrianism was the believed and supported religion of the Sasanians until Ardashir's takeover. The current belief is that the priests of the fire temples became noticed and respected by Ardashir's uprising and the opponents were disturbed; but this narrative is the subject of controversy today. Although no remarkable authority of Zoroastrianism had a high rank in Ardashir's court, it seems that the first attempts to establish Zoroastrianism as a government religion was done during Ardashir's period; also the remaining Achaemenid, Hellenic and Parthian traditions were combined and used in that era.|$|E

500|$|... "Nunca Voy a Olvidarte" [...] {{was written}} by Mexican {{songwriter}} Roberto Belester for Bronco's album Salvaje y Tierno (1991). Belester composed songs for several well-known Mexican bands such as Los Yonic's and Los Bukis. The song tells of a protagonist who is leaving his lover and tells her that he {{is never going to}} forget her. In 1993, Mexican singer-songwriter Cristian Castro covered the song on his second studio album, Un Segundo en el Tiempo, which was produced by Alex Zepeda and released as the lead single from the album. According to Castro, he bought Salvaje y Tierno after hearing [...] "Que No Quede Huella" [...] on the radio and wanted to cover [...] "Nunca Voy a Olvidarte" [...] when he listened to it on the CD. [...] The music video for Castro's cover was produced by Jorge Guerrero Fox Garza and filmed in Cuernavaca which features shots of Castro alone in an old country house near <b>the</b> <b>fireplace</b> <b>and</b> outside on the field remembering a woman he loved.|$|E
500|$|Sophie {{learns that}} Howl has been {{transforming}} into a bird-like creature {{in order to}} interfere with the plans of both sides in the war, but each transformation makes it more difficult for him to return to human form. Sophie's mother — under Suliman's control — arrives and leaves behind a [...] "peeping bug." [...] The former witch promptly destroys the bug by tossing it into Calcifer, who then becomes sick and weak and unable to protect the castle. A few hours later the city is bombed by enemy aircraft. Suliman's henchmen invade the group's abode. After healing Calcifer, Howl tells Sophie that {{he is not going to}} leave because he wants to protect her. Deducing that Howl is trying to protect the castle and everyone inside it, Sophie moves everyone out, removes Calcifer from <b>the</b> <b>fireplace</b> <b>and</b> destroys the castle. The witch realizes that Howl has given his heart to Calcifer, and grabs the fire demon. A panicked Sophie pours water onto the witch, which douses Calcifer. The castle is split in two; Sophie falls down a chasm and is separated from Markl, the witch and Calcifer.|$|E
500|$|Many of the {{original}} features have been lost {{as a consequence of}} the many changes that have taken place over the centuries. [...] Additional features have been added to the interior by Raymond Richards, such as the doorcase around the entrance. [...] The Entrance Hall has retained its medieval shape and low ceiling. [...] It contains the coat of arms of the Richards family and items of weaponry, including a decorative suit of armour dating from the 19thcentury and moved here from Scarisbrick Hall. [...] To the west of the Entrance Hall is the Library. [...] This is in the shape of a double cube, measuring [...] by [...] [...] Its major item is a richly carved Tudor chimneypiece. [...] The bookcases were designed by A.W.N.Pugin. [...] Both of these items were moved here by Raymond Richards, the bookcases coming from Scarisbrick Hall. [...] The bookcases contain a comprehensive collection of books relating to Cheshire. [...] In a corner cabinet is a flint axe head dating from about 2000 BC. [...] This was discovered in the park nearby in 1912. [...] To the south of the Entrance Hall is the Long Hall. [...] This has retained <b>the</b> <b>fireplace</b> <b>and</b> ceiling introduced in the Tudor era. [...] The hall contains items of antique furniture, and paintings by David Wilkie, J. M. W. Turner and John Constable. [...] To the south of the Long Hall is the principal staircase, which was remodelled in 1920. [...] The area around the staircase contains a Waterford glass chandelier dating from about 1780, and a portrait of the first Earl of Harrington by Allan Ramsay. [...] From this area, a door leads into the chapel. [...] This is the third or fourth chapel in the house, and was dedicated to Thomas More when he was canonised in 1935. [...] Much of the woodwork in it dates from 1803. [...] Many of the ornaments in the chapel were brought here by Richards from a redundant church in Ipswich. [...] Two marble plaques in the chapel are by Thomas Thornycroft, a sculptor born in the nearby village. [...] Alongside the chapel is an ambulatory or baptistry which contains a font and items of stained glass, made by Morris & Co. and designed by Edward Burne-Jones. [...] These were obtained by Richards from All Saints Church, Birkenhead. They depict the Crucifixion, and Saints Agnes, George, Stephen and Alban. [...] The south door contains fragments of ancient glass from Plas Newydd, that were originally in a medieval church. [...] Adjacent to the chapel is a conservatory containing marble sculptures by John Warrington Wood.|$|E

2500|$|Despite the stampeding of prisoners, strong senior {{officers}} such as Colonel Harrison C. Hobart {{had the sense}} of mind to tie off the flow of escapees before dawn’s light.

2500|$|Proenneke's {{cabin is}} hand-made and is notable for its {{remarkable}} craftsmanship {{due to his}} skill as a carpenter and wood worker, {{and because of the}} films he made of the complete construction procedure. Most of the structure and the furnishings are made from materials in and about the site, from the gravel taken from the lake bed to create the cabin's base, to the trees he selected, cut down, and then hand-cut with interlocking joints to create the walls and roof rafter framing. The window openings were planned and cut to suit. <b>The</b> <b>fireplace</b> <b>and</b> flue were made from stones he dug from around the site and meticulously mortared in place to create the chimney and hearth. He used metal containers for food storage—one-gallon cans were cut into basin shapes and buried below the frost line. This ensured that fruits and perishables could be stored for prolonged periods in the cool earth yet still be accessible when the winter months froze the ground above them. Proenneke's friend, bush pilot and missionary Leon Reid [...] "Babe" [...] Alsworth, returned periodically to bring food and orders that Proenneke placed through him to Sears.|$|E
2500|$|Originally, {{at the end}} of the Diele {{near the}} back of the farmhouse, was the Flett, an open kitchen and dining area that took up the entire width of the house. The open fireplace, about 1.5 metres across, was located in the middle of the Flett and was ringed with fieldstones. It was not like a hearth in other regions. Many types of cooking were not {{possible}} in this environment (*). Pots had to be high enough, in effect cauldrons, and were hung over the fire with pothooks attached to a wooden frame (Rahmen) hanging over the fireplace, often decorated with horses heads. At night an iron grid was pulled over the fire to prevent sparks, a practice known by the English term curfew. Well-to-do families had a candle arch (Schwibbogen) of masonry instead of a wooden frame. Smoke escaped through an opening in the roof on the gable, the Uhlenloch (also Eulenloch, literally: [...] "owl hole"). The open fireplace meant that such buildings were considered as a particular fire risk by early fire insurance firms. The open fire also provided some heat to the stalls and living quarters of the Hallenhaus. In this way, hay stored in the loft could be dried out and protected from vermin by the smoke. When the farmer's family and farm hands gathered for meal times, the best places were between <b>the</b> <b>fireplace</b> <b>and</b> the rooms. Because there was no partition between Diele and loft, winter temperatures in the Flett never rose above 12°C.|$|E
2500|$|That night, Louis Martin and his daughters, Léonie, Céline and Thérèse, {{attended}} the midnight mass at the cathedral in Lisieux— [...] "but {{there was very}} little heart left in them. On 1 December, Léonie, covered in eczema and hiding her hair under a short mantilla, had returned to Les Buissonnets after just seven weeks of the Poor Clares regime in Alençon", and her sisters were helping her get over her sense of failure and humiliation. Back at Les Buissonnets as every year, Thérèse [...] "as was the custom for French children, had left her shoes on the hearth, empty in anticipation of gifts, not from Father Christmas but from the Child Jesus, who was imagined to travel through the air bearing toys and cakes." [...] While she and Celine were going up the stairs she heard her father, [...] "perhaps exhausted by the hour, or this reminder of the relentless emotional demands of his weepy youngest daughter", say with some irritation [...] "Therese is far too old for this now. Fortunately this will be the last year!" [...] Thérèse had begun to cry and Céline advised her not to go back downstairs immediately. Then, suddenly, Thérèse pulled herself together and wiped her tears. She ran down the stairs, knelt by <b>the</b> <b>fireplace</b> <b>and</b> unwrapped her surprises as jubilantly as ever. In her account, nine years later, of 1895 : [...] "In an instant Jesus, content with my good will, accomplished the work I {{had not been able to}} do in ten years." [...] After nine sad years she had [...] "recovered the strength of soul she had lost" [...] when her mother died and, she said, [...] "she was to retain it forever". She discovered the joy in self-forgetfulness and added, [...] "I felt, in a word, charity enter my heart, the need to forget myself to make others happy—Since this blessed night I was not defeated in any battle, but instead I went from victory to victory and began, so to speak, [...] "to run a giant's course" [...] (Psalms [...] ).|$|E
