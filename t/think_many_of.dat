500|$|Yuri on Ice has {{highlighted}} homophobia {{in figure}} skating and other areas; the seventh episode features a flashback {{in which a}} younger Victor performs in a costume based on those worn by openly-gay figure skater Johnny Weir, who was subject to homophobic comments throughout his career. Weir {{said in an interview}} with The Geekiary, [...] "I think all positive imagery of LGBT themes in sport are good. Unfortunately, the majority of people that rule the skating world are conservative and more business minded. I <b>think</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> them, while they may love and appreciate the art and the sport, are more interested in the business side of things or power trips. I don't know if Yuri on Ice will be able to change the perception of gay athletes to a 60 year old businessman, but I am of the school of thought that every little bit helps". The series finale features a scene in which Yuri K. and Victor skate together at an exhibition event; something which has not yet occurred in actual competition. Critics have noted that the series depicts two characters from countries with problems concerning LGBT rights.|$|E
2500|$|However, Buddhadasa {{was skeptical}} of his fame; when {{reflecting}} on the busloads of visitors to Suan Mokkh he would say, [...] "sometimes I <b>think</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> these people just stop here {{because they have to}} visit the bathroom." ...|$|E
40|$|Megacities {{are a new}} {{phenomenon}} in history. The fact that <b>many</b> <b>of</b> them are in emerging countries deepens the challenges of governing these spaces. Can these vast, complex entities, rife with inequalities and divisions, be governed effectively? Elli Thomas <b>thinks</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the conclusions made in Governing Megacities will be relevant for urban policymakers {{for a long time}} yet...|$|R

6000|$|... "Half a day's {{journey from}} here, Señor," [...] said he, [...] "is {{the village of}} Tacuzama, which we have never visited. I <b>think</b> <b>many</b> ounces <b>of</b> gold may be {{procured}} there. It is worth the trial." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I don't see why I shouldn't. Gentlemen's {{hearts are}} things {{very much to}} be doubted as far as I've seen 'em. I don't <b>think</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> 'em have 'em at all.' ...|$|E
60|$|Am not I cross? But these gray skies {{are mere}} poison to my thoughts, and I {{have been writing}} such letters, that I don't <b>think</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> my friends are likely {{to speak to me}} again.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't <b>think</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> us are industrious in {{that way}} now. After all, isn't it a pity {{that so many of}} the {{beautiful}} old handicrafts are dying out? No loom, for instance, could turn out some of the things your wife makes. They're matchless." ...|$|E
6000|$|The girl {{went through}} the show. [...] "More or less, I <b>think.</b> But <b>many</b> <b>of</b> them are things I dare say I may take for granted--things women can do {{for each other and}} that you wouldn't understand." ...|$|R
60|$|Austin rose {{up slowly}} {{with a little}} sign of comprehension. Two men had been buried while he was away, {{and he did not}} <b>think</b> that <b>many</b> <b>of</b> them would be left there to see the waters fall.|$|R
50|$|Unlike <b>many</b> <b>think</b> tanks, <b>many</b> <b>of</b> which receive public funds, the {{organisation}} is not registered as a charity but operates instead {{as a company}} limited by guarantee and its website states that {{the organisation}} relies on donations from the public. The company's abbreviated accounts for 2010 indicate that, at that time, it had total assets of £29,320.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{has been}} sharper than I bargained for," [...] James said, laughing, [...] "and was pretty near being the last, {{as well as}} the first. If it hadn't been for your taking us to the boats, I don't <b>think</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> us would have got back to Fort Henry to tell the tale." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That was {{a narrow}} escape indeed, Richards," [...] Captain Brookfield said. [...] "If you hadn't had your wits about you the Boers would {{certainly}} have got you. It was a first-rate hiding-place, but I don't <b>think</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> us {{would have thought of}} adopting it. Now, will someone else give us a yarn?" ...|$|E
60|$|And they little <b>think,</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> them, fine gentlemen {{and ladies}} that they are, what an {{important}} personage, {{and how much}} to be had in reverence, is the rough fellow in the pea-jacket, whom they see standing at the wheel, now cocking his eye aloft, and then peeping at the compass, or looking out to windward.|$|E
6000|$|PATTY. This {{will be a}} {{great year}} for females, ma'am. <b>Think</b> how <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the men that marched away {{strutting}} to the wars have come back limping. Who is to take off their wooden legs of an evening, Miss Susan? You, ma'am, or me? ...|$|R
5000|$|Thomas stated {{he likes}} MMA {{fighting}} because [...] "Struggle and fear tackled by athleticism, technical know-how and innate desires for self-preservation brings out a side in humanity that exists {{only in the}} deepest recesses of our being. MMA fighting has no peer {{when it comes to}} the demands the sport places on its participants both physically and psychologically. And I love watching that dynamic in action"". But he hates everything else about the MMA world; He <b>thinks</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the individuals in the industry are [...] "utterly detestable". He suspects that [...] "the majority of conversations has with members of the fight community are either extended lies or at least contain a lie". Therefore, he tries to keep his direct contact with MMA promotions to a minimum.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why," [...] said Wildrake, [...] "I {{have but}} sent a Puritan's hat upon a loyal errand. I laugh to <b>think</b> how <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the schoolboys thou talk'st of will be cheated into {{climbing}} the pollard next year, {{expecting to find}} the nest of some unknown bird in yonder unmeasured margin of felt." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Of course!” said Nettie. “Well, {{my father}} once peddled oranges on the trains; {{and they make}} quite a fuss over {{people who are on}} the stage in London, while I don’t <b>think</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> them could have done that last piece of yours half as cunningly. Anyway, I haven’t laughed as much since I’ve been in England. If you did it in New York you’d coin money.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I can't {{understand}} Maurice, much as I respect him. It {{is simply}} {{wasting my time}} and my brains to attempt to read him; he has great thoughts, and he makes them intelligible to people less stupid than me, and many writers whom I like and understand have taken their ideas from him; but I cannot understand him. And I <b>think</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> his men have his faults. At least I am so conceited as to think it is not all my fault.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{they got}} into one of our squares, and I don't <b>think</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> our fellows would have ever got away {{if it had not}} been that Buller's square came up to their assistance. Still, I don't suppose that will ever happen again. If the {{infantry}} stand firm and shoot straight they ought never to be broken, while that cavalry business was a thing nothing could guard against. The best horseman in the world may go down if a fellow shams dead and then suddenly stabs your horse." ...|$|E
50|$|Mayuri's {{greatest}} {{ability is}} his scientific intellect. He's able to <b>think</b> <b>many</b> steps ahead <b>of</b> his opponents and has created numerous inventions to aid him in battle. He {{is also a}} master of Kido and has {{a very high level}} of Reiatsu.|$|R
5000|$|If you'll indulge us {{just another}} moment, {{this is the}} end of our {{association}} with baseball. I <b>think</b> as <b>many</b> <b>of</b> you may know, the primary package goes to CBS. And to our friends at what's known in the industry as [...] "Black Rock", good luck in 1990and beyond. Al Michaels at the end of ABC's coverage of the 1989 World Series.|$|R
30|$|One of {{the major}} {{obstacles}} in cancer research {{is related to the}} concept that cancer is a problem <b>of</b> <b>many</b> diseases. This viewpoint has kept researchers from investigating the etiology of cancer because a search for numerous causes would be prohibitively complex. While the expression of various cancers coincides with the concept of numerous diseases, we <b>think</b> <b>many</b> types <b>of</b> prevalent cancers have a common etiology. The understanding of this common mechanism of cancer initiation can lead to cancer prevention.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I mean Lord Warburton and his friends--the {{radicals}} of {{the upper}} class. Of course I only know the way it strikes me. They talk about the changes, but I don't think they quite realise. You and I, you know, {{we know what it}} is to have lived under democratic institutions: I always thought them very comfortable, but I was used to them from the first. And then I ain't a lord; you're a lady, my dear, but I ain't a lord. Now over here I don't think it quite comes home to them. It's a matter of every day and every hour, and I don't <b>think</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> them would find it as pleasant as what they've got. Of course if they want to try, it's their own business; but I expect they won't try very hard." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{regret to}} say that Polly never could talk with or be near Trix without feeling irritated and combative. She tried to conquer this feeling, but she could n't, and when Trix put on airs, Polly felt an intense desire to box her ears. That eye-glass was her especial aversion, for Trix was no more near-sighted than herself, but pretended to be {{because it was the}} fashion, and at times used the {{innocent}} glass as a weapon with which to put down any one who presumed to set themselves up. The supercilious glance which accompanied her ironically polite speech roused Polly, who answered with sudden color and the kindling of the eyes that always betrayed a perturbed spirit, [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> us would enjoy that selfish sort of peace, while little children starve, and girls no older than us kill themselves because their dreadful poverty leaves them no choice but sin or death." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly, {{impossible}} for {{us who have}} no money to bribe them with, but easy enough if any one outside, with ample means, were to set about it. These overseers are, many of them, sons of Turkish mothers, and have no sympathy, save that caused by interest, with one parent more than another. Of course, they are brought up Christians, and taught to hold Moslems in abhorrence, but I <b>think</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> them, if they had their free choice, would cross to the mainland. Here they have no chance of ever being aught but what they are--overseers of slaves, or small prison officials. They are despised by these haughty knights, and hated by us, while were they to reach the mainland and adopt their mothers' religion, everything {{would be open to}} them. All followers of the Prophet have an equal chance, and one may be a soldier today, a bey tomorrow, and a pasha a year hence, if he be brave, or astute, or capable in any way beyond his fellows. Men like these warders would be sure to make their way.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mebbe," [...] he answered, {{and turned}} {{abruptly}} to Saxon. [...] "Say, we old Americans oughta stick together, don't you <b>think?</b> They ain't <b>many</b> <b>of</b> us left. The country's fillin' {{up with all}} kinds of foreigners." ...|$|R
6000|$|Clumsily, as one {{not used}} to it, the young man lifted his cap to Claire, showing {{straight}}, wiry, rope-colored hair, brushed straight back from a rather fine forehead. [...] "Gee, I was sorry to have to swear and holler like that, but it's all Adolph understands. Please don't <b>think</b> there's <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the folks around here like him. They say he's the meanest man in the county." ...|$|R
50|$|While <b>many</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> Africana Womanism {{as being}} {{similar to that}} of Black feminism, African feminism, womanism, and feminism, there are clear distinctions in agenda for the forms of women empowerment.|$|R
60|$|As for Confusion in the Church, I {{look upon}} {{this to be}} the {{greatest}} Objection that can be raised; but then it must be allow'd, that without Writing the Reformation (the Glory of our Religion) could never have been effected; and in respect to religious Controversies, tho' I own they are seldom attended with good Consequences, yet I must beg leave to observe, that as the Age we now live in, is more bright and shining in substantial Literature than any preceding Century, so the generality of Mankind are capable of judging with such an Exactness as to avoid a Bad; not but, I confess, I <b>think</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the Persons concern'd in the Controversy lately on foot, with relation to the Bishop of Bangor's Sermon, preach'd before His Majesty, deserve to be stigmatiz'd, as well for their indecent Heat, as for the Latitude taken with regard to the Holy Scriptures. And for the last Objection, I never knew that Writing was any ways destructive to Liberty, unless it was in a Pamphlet, [entitled King-Killing no Murder] which 'tis said occasion'd the Death of Oliver Cromwel.|$|E
60|$|It is now suggested--publicly in some quarters, privately in many quarters--that the House of Lords {{will not}} only use without scruple their veto in {{legislation}} but they propose to extend their prerogatives; {{they are going to}} lay their hands upon finance, and if they choose they will reject or amend the Budget. I have always thought it a great pity that Mr. Gladstone made a compromise with the House of Lords over the Franchise Bill of 1884. I regret, and I <b>think</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> my hon. friends in the House of Commons will regret, looking back upon the past, that the present Government did not advise a dissolution of Parliament upon the rejection of the Education Bill in 1906. A dissolution in those circumstances would not merely have involved the measure under discussion, but if the Government of that day had received the support of the electors at the poll their victory must have carried with it that settlement and reform of the relations between the two Houses of Parliament which is necessary to secure the effective authority of the House of Commons. That is the question which, behind and beyond all others, even the Budget, even Free Trade, even the land--that is the question which, as the Prime Minister has said, is the dominant issue of our time.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{will not}} go out and attack them," [...] Chris said to the lads who were running towards their horses. [...] "That would mean that though we might kill all of them, half of us would {{probably}} be shot. We will ambush them. Get the picket ropes loose and the bridles on ready for mounting, and then leave the horses {{in charge of the}} natives where we camped. They will be out of sight there. When you have done that take your places quietly among the rocks. Do you, Capper and Carmichael, put yourselves twenty or thirty yards apart; you are our best shots. When the Boers get within a thousand yards, which is as near as they will do if they keep the line they are going, open fire upon them and keep it up steadily, but not too fast. When they see that only two men are firing they will think that you are a couple of farmers whose place they have plundered, and who are determined to have their revenge. You are safe to hit some of them, and the others will decide upon wiping you out, and will probably leave their horses and crawl up in their usual style. When they get close it will be our turn. I don't <b>think</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> them are likely to get away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There may be {{more than}} you <b>think,</b> my lord. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> the ships will be very big, much bigger than those that trade with Rangoon; and some of them will carry as many as five hundred men." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{know not}} {{which of the}} three was the more astonished, for my mother had not heard of my adventures of the night. They never took their {{wondering}} eyes off me as I told my story, and my heart swelled with pride when my uncle said that we had carried ourselves well, {{and that he did}} not <b>think</b> that <b>many</b> <b>of</b> our age would have stood it as stoutly.|$|R
50|$|Basta is very superstitious, always wearing {{some kind}} of {{medallion}} or good-luck charm {{to protect him from}} a bad luck that he <b>thinks</b> exists everywhere. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> the characters, Dustfinger and Fenoglio particularly, take advantage of this to achieve their means.|$|R
