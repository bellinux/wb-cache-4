25|$|Ideas for {{a comedy}} series about older women {{emerged during the}} filming of a {{television}} special at NBC's Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California, in August 1984. Produced to introduce the network's 1984–85 season schedule, two actresses appearing on NBC shows, Selma Diamond of Night Court and Doris Roberts of Remington Steele, appeared in a skit promoting the upcoming show Miami Vice as Miami Nice, a parody about old people living in Miami. NBC senior vice president Warren Littlefield was among the executive producers in <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> <b>who</b> were amused by their performance, and he envisioned a series based on the geriatric humor the two were portraying.|$|E

25|$|In 1999 Deuteronomium {{entered the}} studio again and {{recorded}} new material. They first released a single called To Die and Gain. During that period they also changed their old extreme metal logo {{to a more}} simplified version. All {{of a sudden the}} band {{received a phone call from}} club Lutakko inquiring whether Deuteronomium could open for the rock metal band Sentenced – a well-known Finnish group – on February 6. It was Deuteronomium's biggest gig at that point of their career. According to Deuteronomium, they were well received by <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> <b>who</b> had come to see Sentenced although many were surprised that Deuternomium is a Christian band when the band told about their faith. The members of Sentenced were divided in two when they heard who their support act was. Others didn't even greet them while others came to talk to Deuteronomium members during the pauses.|$|E

[...] Kunal Guha of Yahoo.com gave the film 3 out of 5 stars, saying that, [...] "The biggest dilemma of remaking a movie is how much to retain and what to retain. If the new story takes violent shifts, you lose <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> <b>who</b> came to revisit the original. If you {{photocopy}} scene-by-scene, you risk failing to connect with <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> <b>who</b> is accustomed to present sensibilities.

500|$|The {{idea for}} [...] "Scary Monsters" [...] stemmed from {{an idea that}} became the episode's teaser. Fellow writer Vince Gilligan {{suggested}} making Tommy the episode's villain. Originally, the story featured Doggett and Reyes investigating the case with a new agent. Executive producer Frank Spotnitz suggested to Schnauz that the new FBI agent should be Leyla Harrison, played by Jolie Jenkins, who had {{first appeared in the}} Spotnitz-penned eighth season episode [...] "Alone". The writing staff used Leyla's character to comment {{on the state of the}} show and, most notably, the members of <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> <b>who</b> preferred Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) over Doggett.|$|E

500|$|By {{the end of}} 1938 Hordern's {{father had}} sold the family home and had bought a cottage in Holt, near Bath, Somerset. The {{arrangement}} was convenient for the young actor, who used the premises as a base while he appeared in shows with the Rapier Players. [...] One such piece was an adaption of [...] Stella Gibbons's Cold Comfort Farm, which starred Mabel Constanduros, who had adapted the book with Gibbons' permission. Hordern was cast in the supporting role of Seth, a part he described as being fun to perform. The modernised script was [...] "adored" [...] by the cast, according to Hordern, but loathed by <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> <b>who</b> {{expected it to be}} exactly like the book.|$|E
500|$|By 1983, Rollins' stage persona was {{increasingly}} alienating {{him from the}} rest of Black Flag. During a show in England, Rollins assaulted a member of <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> <b>who</b> attacked Ginn; Ginn later scolded Rollins, calling him a [...] "macho asshole". A legal dispute with Unicorn Records held up further Black Flag releases until 1984, and Ginn was slowing the band's tempo down so that they would remain innovative. In August 1983, guitarist Dez Cadena had left the band; a stalemate lingered between Dukowski and Ginn, who wanted Dukowski to leave, before Ginn fired Dukowski outright. 1984's heavy metal music-influenced My War featured Rollins screaming and wailing throughout many of the songs; the band's members also grew their hair to confuse the band's hardcore punk audience.|$|E
500|$|Films that stated a {{position}} about a social issue were usually labeled either [...] "propaganda films" [...] or [...] "preachment yarns". In contrast to Goldwyn and MGM's definitively Republican stance on social issue films, Warner Brothers, led by New Deal advocate Jack L. Warner, {{was the most}} prominent maker {{of these types of}} pictures and preferred they be called [...] "Americanism stories". Pre-Code historian Thomas Doherty has written that two recurring elements marked the so-called preachment yarns. [...] "The first is the exculpatory preface; the second is the Jazz Age prelude." [...] The preface was essentially a softened version of a disclaimer that intended to calm any in <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> <b>who</b> disagreed with the film's message. The Jazz Age prelude was almost singularly used to cast shame on the boisterous behavior of the 1920s.|$|E

500|$|The tour's set, {{described}} at {{the time}} as [...] "the largest touring set ever," [...] was designed to look like a giant spider. It was 60 feet (18.3m) high, 64 feet (19.5m) wide and included giant vacuumed tube legs that were lit from the inside with 20,000' (6,096m) of color-changing lights. A single set took 43 trucks to move and was estimated to weigh 360 tons. 16' x 20' (4.9m x 6m) video screens displayed video and images from the show to those in <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> <b>who</b> were further away from the stage. The system required to run the show included two separate sound systems, 260 speaker cabinets, 1,000 lights (with an output total of 600,000 watts) and three computers. Mark Ravitz, the set designer, had previously designed Bowie's 1974 Diamond Dogs Tour set.|$|E
500|$|The writing staff used Leyla's {{character}} {{to comment on}} the state of the show and, most notably, the members of <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> <b>who</b> preferred Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) over Doggett. Due to Harrison's extensive knowledge of the X-Files, the episode contains several references to previous episodes. Harrison suggests early on that Doggett and Reyes may be dealing with a person capable of channeling electricity, a reference to the third season entry [...] "D.P.O." [...] Doggett later suggests that the three of them may be experiencing some sort of hallucination, and cites the events in the sixth season episode [...] "Field Trip" [...] as an example. Furthermore, when Tommy shows Reyes his drawing, he tells her [...] "I made this", a potential reference to the tagline at the end of every Ten Thirteen Production.|$|E

500|$|The {{opening track}} on Justified, [...] "Señorita" [...] is a Spanish {{oriented}} song that features R influences; in it Timberlake sings {{about a girl}} with brown eyes. [...] "Like I Love You" [...] is a funk influenced song consisted of live drums, tiny guitar strum accompanied with the singer's breathy tenor. According to Ben Ratliff of Rolling Stone, [...] "it's minimalism influenced by Michael Jackson". The third track on the album, [...] "(Oh No) What You Got" [...] was described by Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine as a bit racy for <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> <b>who</b> expected a more boy-band-oriented record. Regarding the fourth song, Russell Bailie of The New Zealand Herald wrote that although the album [...] "manages to skirt teen-pop sugariness for the most part, though it does offer quality mush on numbers such as 'Take It From Here'." [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] is a funk and R song with an instrumentation that features beatboxing, synthesizers, Arabian-inspired riffs and Gregorian chants. Lyrically, the song is about a brokenhearted man who moves on from his past.|$|E
500|$|In early 1922, Lloyd {{moved in}} with her sister Daisy to save money. On 4 October, against her doctor's advice, she {{appeared}} at the Empire Music Hall in Edmonton, North London, where she sang [...] "I'm One of the Ruins That Cromwell Knocked About a Bit". [...] Her performance was weak, and she was unsteady on her feet, eventually falling over on stage. [...] Her erratic and brief performance proved hilarious for <b>the</b> <b>audience,</b> <b>who</b> thought that it was all part of the act. [...] A week later, while appearing at the Alhambra Theatre, she was taken ill on stage and was found later in her dressing room crippled with pain, complaining of stomach cramps. [...] She returned home later that evening, where she died of heart and kidney failure three days later, aged 52. [...] More than 50,000 people attended her funeral at Hampstead Cemetery on 12October 1922. [...] Lloyd was penniless {{at the time of her}} death and her estate, which was worth £7,334, helped to pay off debts that she and Dillon had incurred over the years.|$|E
500|$|Jim Harrison of SoundSpike {{affirmed that}} the Harajuku Lovers Tour lacked a strong musical setlist, and {{also felt that}} Stefani's stage {{presence}} was absent.

Baby. and suggested {{that she should have}} included songs by No Doubt for [...] "much-needed shots of adrenaline" [...] for <b>the</b> <b>audience,</b> <b>who</b> were, according to Harrison, [...] "figuratively sitting on their hands and literally yawning four songs into the set". Harrison felt that Stefani seemed truly [...] "lost on stage without a band", ultimately describing her performance as [...] " [...] energy", [...] "lukewarm" [...] and seemingly [...] "on autopilot". Furthermore, the SoundSpike writer thought that her performance was akin to that of fellow American recording artist Britney Spears, which was [...] "utterly unsuitable for both the song selection and her style". However, he did praise the rendition of [...] "Hollaback Girl", calling it [...] "great" [...] and [...] "Gwen being all Gwen can be", and called the breakdancing [...] "pretty cool".|$|E
