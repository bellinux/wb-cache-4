In an interview, he stated, [...] "When we were doing Return of the Jedi there was a rumor that George Lucas had nine films in his head, and he'd clearly just completed three of them." [...] McDiarmid added, [...] "Someone said that, 'Oh, I <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> might do next is go back in time, and show how Vader came to be.' It {{never occurred to me}} in a million years that I would be involved in that, because I thought, 'oh well, then he'll get a much younger actor [...]' That would be obvious." [...] However, [...] "I was the right age, ironically, for the first prequel when it was made. ... So I was in the very strange and rather wonderful paradox of playing myself when young at my own age, having played myself previously when 100-and-I-don't-know-what." ...|$|E

5000|$|Lin Shaohua: He {{declared}} that men should avoid housework, as {{pots and pans}} are fatal to men. [...] "They wear out a man’s thinking and spirit—that’s the reason why there are effeminate men," [...] and <b>thinks</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> said was totally right.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, indeed! But I {{must not}} tell you {{anything}} about my husband. You would never <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> is--not at all like Nofri!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think he's outside now. I can't <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> wants. Would you--would {{you mind}} being {{kind enough to}} go and send him away?" ...|$|E
6000|$|They all {{received}} this information in silence at first, {{for they were}} trying to <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> could mean. Finally Trot mustered up courage to ask: ...|$|E
6000|$|Oh, {{it drives}} me half crazy {{to think of}} the days I [...] Went slap for the Ghazi, my sword at my side, [...] When we rode Hell-for-leather [...] Both squadrons together, [...] That didn't care whether we lived or we died.

6000|$|... 'Nay, <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> is yourself. Or rather look here,' and he {{took out}} a part of a letter from Ethel, and laid it before her.|$|E
6000|$|... 'It's {{all very}} well to say that, but I have some heart. I love him. I could not see him starve. <b>Think</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> might be with £20,000 a-year!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He was a miser young, {{so you can}} <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> is now in his age," [...] said he. [...] "Well, he's {{had some}} good out of his money." ...|$|E
5000|$|A typical Hal Roach joke is as follows: [...] "He {{told me that}} I have a cult following, {{at least}} I <b>think</b> that's <b>what</b> <b>he</b> said".|$|R

60|$|But now Owen {{had made}} his accusation; and as it was not answered, he hardly knew how to proceed. He walked about the room, endeavouring to <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had better say next.|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, {{you can say}} I'm up-stairs; he must <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> likes. Not a {{word about}} the {{astronomy}} to any of them, whatever you do. I should be called a visionary, and all sorts.' ...|$|E

6000|$|For {{the moment}} Mr. Fotheringay could not <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> {{had done it}} for. His silence seemed to irritate Mr. Winch. [...] "You've been assaulting the police, young man, this time. That's what you done." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{tried to}} be sober, but the wild girl set her and Lemuel off {{laughing}} when she retorted, [...] "Guess he'll <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> {{did when he was}} brought up in court for highway robbery." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Not {{a word of}} him, Hugh," [...] she said. [...] "You don't {{know what}} that poor fellow is suffering. Our {{disappointment}} is nothing in comparison with his. <b>Think</b> of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> has lost." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, dearest? <b>Think</b> <b>what</b> motives <b>he</b> {{could have}} had; what other object than to place {{you in a}} painful position, and to cause trouble and vexation to us all. Did he not know that we were engaged?" ...|$|R
50|$|He {{taught me}} {{so many things}} I couldnt {{describe}} them. One of them is, not all words are needed to be said. They should only be thought.

6000|$|... "No, no!" [...] {{said the}} other, eagerly. [...] "That was what I meant, sir. I don't think as you do; but I {{believe that a}} man who helped to save the country has a right to <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> pleases about it." ...|$|E

60|$|Bessie. Leave that to me. Of course all his fancies are not mad. They aren't. (Pause.) Most {{people in}} this town would <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had set his mind on quite sensible. If he ever talks to you of it, don't {{contradict}} him. It would--it would be dangerous.|$|E
60|$|SHE. Oh, I don't {{care about}} the profanation; but <b>what</b> will Teddy <b>think?</b> <b>what</b> will <b>he</b> do? [Suddenly {{throwing}} his head away from her knee]. You don't seem to think a bit about Teddy. [She jumps up, more and more agitated].|$|R
6000|$|... "I mean, is it anybody's duty--yours or mine--to {{go to the}} man {{and find}} him out; <b>what</b> <b>he</b> really <b>thinks,</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> really feels? I don't mean, make an appeal to him. That would be unworthy of her. But perhaps he's holding back from a mistaken feeling of delicacy, of remorse; when if he {{could be made to}} see that it was his right, his privilege, to be {{everything}} to her now that a man could be to a woman, and infinitely more than any man could hope to be to a happy or fortunate woman--What do you think? He could be reparation, protection, safety, everything!" ...|$|R
