500|$|However Nicki Escudero of the Phoenix New Times {{said that}} {{although}} the song was good for what it is, it lacked substance. [...] "Now that Diddy-Dirty Money has had success with a superficial track about money, sex and cheating, here's hoping the group will release a deeper song about something more meaningful. Unfortunately, hope can only go so far." [...] Meanwhile, Michael Cragg from The Guardians music blog commented that the UK remix featuring Skepta salvages what would otherwise be a boring Diddy track. [...] "Thankfully, UK grime king, Skepta, has rescued the song by pushing Diddy to the periphery – his flow consists of going 'uh', 'Skepta' and spelling out 'D.I.D.D.Y.# – setting off a smorgasbord of sonic explosions, tightening <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>up</b> and making it sound a lot darker and more thrilling than a host of US producers could manage.

Aidan and Chris go out on another date, which marks the beginning of their relationship and Neighbours first ever gay couple. On 9 April 2012, Aidan and Chris shared their first on-screen kiss. The couple, who had not shown any sign of physical affection until that point, shared [...] "a rather passionate embrace" [...] during a house party. Morley told TV Week's Andrew Mercado that Chris and Aidan share the intimate moment as any other couple would do. Morley thought the kiss was just as awkward as any other kiss he had previously performed, but he and Mason spent a lot of time and effort into getting it right for their characters. Chris and Aidan's kiss marked the serial's first male gay kiss in its twenty-seven-year history. Bower had previously promised that it would not be [...] "sensationalist or token" [...] and the low-key scene earned praise from viewers on social networking sites.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} {{featured}} in a McDonald's advert that aired during the 2002 Winter Olympics. Mercer elaborated on the song's in an interview: [...] "That whole thing was just an ad agency that McDonald’s hired to do a “hip commercial,” or whatever. So the kid who offered <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>up</b> to us was a Shins fan." [...] Online message boards (many on Pitchfork.com) and fans of the Shins criticized the move as excessively commercialist. The band's hometown alt weekly ran an editorial titled [...] "McShins, New Corporate Suck-ass" [...] in reaction. The ad's aesthetics were criticized for straying from the company's typical upbeat themes, and fans of the band found its inclusion subversive, considering a set of the song's lyrics, which at times refer to [...] "the dirt in your fries." [...] The royalties Mercer earned from the commercial allowed him to purchase a home. In addition, the band used the money to finance a tour and relocate to Portland, Oregon, where they built a basement studio and recorded their second album, Chutes Too Narrow (2003). Mercer nevertheless [...] "recognized the detrimental capacity of linking music with advertising," [...] remarking, [...] "Imagine us playing [...] "New Slang," [...] {{and everyone in the}} audience going, 'That's the song from the McDonald's commercial — I'm loving it.'" ...|$|E
