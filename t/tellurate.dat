The development of multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS) techniques {{has led to the}} study of isotope variability in increasingly heavy elements due to the increase in precision and ionization potential compared to older isotope analytical techniques. Despite the increasing use of stable isotopes as geochemical tracers, those of the element tellurium have been relatively understudied. The three studies presented here provide the first analyses of tellurium isotope variability in tellurides and native tellurium, as well as <b>tellurates</b> and tellurites. The first study presents a methodology for the extraction and purification of Te from such minerals, as well as for their analysis using MC-ICP-MS. Importantly, this study established that processing and analytical techniques do not induce isotopic fractionation. Furthermore, with a δ 130 / 125 Te range of 1. 6 /, the preliminary isotope data from the methods development process suggested appreciable fractionation of Te, even at elevated temperatures. The second study presents data for 82 Te-rich minerals of various oxidation states and compares those empirical data to experimental data from thermodynamic calculations. The samples were unlocated beyond the general area of their collection. The overall range of fractionation for Te is 2. 85 / and seems to be dominated by mass-dependent processes. Redox reactions do not seem to induce large fractionations, which contradicts thermodynamic predictions, and suggests that disequilibrium processes may have occurred during changes in valence state. The final study of this dissertation is related to well-located tellurides and native tellurium from the epithermal Emperor gold telluride deposit, Fiji. Here, we report a range of Te isotope values of 1. 13 /. The preliminary dataset presented shows that samples hosted within the volcanic caldera have a more narrow range than those hosted in adjacent rock, suggesting that wall rock interaction during magmatic-hydrothermal fluid flow may be responsible for some amount of fractionation. Like other epithermal deposits, Te isotope values at Emperor are relatively tightly clustered, in contrast to those from the orogenic Kalgoorlie gold telluride deposit.

Electron microprobe analysis of timroseite provided PbO 35. 85, CuO 29. 57, TeO_ 3 27. 75, Cl 0. 04, H_ 2 O 1. 38 (structure), O≡Cl – 0. 01, total 94. 58 wt%; the empirical formula (based on O+Cl = 14) is Pb_(2. 07) Cu^(2 +) _(4. 80) Te^(6 +) _(2. 04) O_(12) (OH) _(1. 98) Cl_(0. 02). Electron microprobe analysis of paratimroseite provided PbO 36. 11, CuO 26. 27, TeO_ 3 29. 80, Cl 0. 04, H_ 2 O 3. 01 (structure), O≡Cl – 0. 01, total 95. 22 wt%; the empirical formula (based on O+Cl = 14) is Pb_(1. 94) Cu^(2 +) _(3. 96) Te^(6 +) _(2. 03) O_(12) (H_ 2 O) _(1. 99) Cl_(0. 01). The strongest powder X-ray diffraction lines for timroseite are [d_(obs) in Å (hkl) I]: 3. 693 (022) 43, 3. 578 (112) 44, 3. 008 (023) 84, 2. 950 (113) 88, 2. 732 (130) 100, 1. 785 (multiple) 33, 1. 475 (332) 36; and for paratimroseite 4. 771 (101) 76, 4. 463 (021) 32, 3. 544 (120) 44, 3. 029 (023, 122) 100, 2. 973 (113) 48, 2. 665 (131) 41, 2. 469 (114) 40, 2. 246 (221) 34. The crystal structures of timroseite (R_ 1 = 0. 029) and paratimroseite (R_ 1 = 0. 039) are very closely related. The structures are based upon edge- and corner-sharing sheets of Te and Cu polyhedra parallel to (001) and the sheets in both structures are identical in topology and virtually identical in geometry. In timroseite, the sheets are joined to one another along c by sharing the apical O atoms of Cu octahedra, as well as by sharing edges and corners with an additional CuO_ 5 square pyramid located between the sheets. The sheets in paratimroseite are joined only via Pb-O and H bonds...|$|R
