5000|$|The {{finished}} Jar with a Twist design {{will have}} a <b>tamper-proof</b> <b>seal</b> on both the top and {{the bottom of the}} jar. When you twist the jar’s bottom, no residue will be left behind from the product inside. That’s because the inner-piece and the cylinder meet to form an air- and-watertight seal—the same basic design principle used in the pistons of a car’s engine.|$|E
50|$|The {{safe passage}} of {{diplomatic}} baggage is {{guaranteed by the}} Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, and for reasons of state secrecy, the diplomatic bag does not go through normal airport baggage-checks and must not be opened, x-rayed, weighed, or otherwise investigated by customs, airline security staff, or anyone else for that matter. The bag is closed with a <b>tamper-proof</b> <b>seal</b> and has its own diplomatic passport. The Queen's Messenger and the messenger's personal luggage {{are not covered by}} special rules, however, so although the diplomatic bag, covered by the passport, is not checked, the messenger and the messenger's personal luggage go through normal security screening.|$|E

50|$|To prevent {{unauthorised}} {{access to an}} instrument <b>tamper-proof</b> <b>seals</b> are usually applied after calibration. The picture of the oscilloscope rack shows these, and prove that the instrument has not been removed since it was last calibrated as they will possible unauthorised to the adjusting elements of the instrument. There also are labels showing {{the date of the}} last calibration and when the calibration interval dictates when the next one is needed. Some organizations also assign unique identification to each instrument to standardize the record keeping and keep track of accessories that are integral to a specific calibration condition.|$|R

40|$|When heated {{from room}} {{temperature}} to 165 C, some shape memory metal alloys such as titanium-nickel alloys {{have the ability}} to return to a previously defined shape or size with dimensional changes up to 7 %. In contrast, the thermal expansion of most metals over this temperature range is about 0. 1 to 0. 2 %. The dimension change of shape memory alloys, which occurs during a martensite to austenite phase transition, can generate stresses as high as 700 MPa (100 kspi). These properties can be used to create a closure for radioactive materials packages that provides for easy robotic or manual operations and results in reproducible, <b>tamper-proof</b> <b>seals.</b> This paper describes some proposed closure methods with shape memory alloys for radioactive material packages. Properties of the shape memory alloys are first summarized, then some possible alternative sealing methods discussed, and, finally, results from an initial proof-of-concept experiment described...|$|R

5000|$|A {{grasshopper}} escapement is {{an essential}} part of a sculptural clock by Martin Burgess, known as Burgess Clock B. One of a pair based on the technology of the late regulator clock by John Harrison, it was completed by Charles Frodsham & Company at the request of its owner, Donald Saff. After successful testing there it was transferred to the Royal Observatory, Greenwich for a detailed assessment of its long-term performance. [...] This was overseen by the Worshipful Company of Clockmakers and the National Physical Laboratory, whose representatives attached <b>tamper-proof</b> <b>seals</b> to the case of the clock. Although the clock is electrically-wound, thus preventing any disturbance whatever of the clock during the assessment, it is otherwise entirely mechanical. At the end of a period of one-hundred days, the maximum error had not exceeded five-eighths of a second - no allowance for a steady drift of time (rate) having had to be applied. As a result, on the 18th of April 2015, the Guinness World Records organisation presented a World Record certificate [...] to Martin Burgess for having made the most accurate purely mechanical clock working in free air. The clock remains at the ROG and its performance continues to be monitored.|$|R
30|$|Patients were {{randomly}} assigned to receive intraoperative intravenous ascorbic acid 2 g in 250 ml 0.9 % saline or 250 ml 0.9 % saline placebo over 15 minutes following induction of anaesthesia. Block randomization was performed by an independent statistician. The randomization assignments were concealed in <b>sealed,</b> <b>tamper-proof</b> envelopes that were opened sequentially by an independent pharmacist. When an eligible subject was recruited, the pharmacist allocated the subject to the designated treatment group, maintaining blinding. Ascorbic acid and 0.9 % saline were prepared by the independent pharmacist and had an identical appearance. All staff and participants were blinded to treatment allocation.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} several fault {{attacks on the}} Ad-vanced Encryption Standard (AES). First, using optical/eddy current fault induction attacks as recently publicly presented by Skorobogatov, Anderson and Quisquater, Samyde [SA,QS], we present an implemen-tation independent fault attack on AES. This attack is able to deter-mine the complete 128 -bit secret key of a <b>sealed</b> <b>tamper-proof</b> smart-card by generating 128 faulty cipher texts. Second, we present several implementation-dependent fault attacks on AES. These attacks rely on the observation that due to the AES’s known timing analysis vulnera-bility (as pointed out by Koeune and Quisquater [KQ]), any implemen-tation of the AES must ensure a data independent timing behavior for the so called AES’s xtime operation. We present fault attacks on AES based on various timing analysis resistant implementations of the xtime-operation. Our strongest attack in this direction uses a very liberal fault model and requires only 256 faulty encryptions to determine a 128 -bit key...|$|R
