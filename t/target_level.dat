When at this <b>target</b> <b>level,</b> the LHC will have a significantly reduced luminosity, due to both fewer proton bunches in each beam and fewer protons per bunch. The reduced bunch frequency does allow the crossing angle to be reduced to zero however, as bunches are far enough spaced to prevent secondary collisions in the experimental beampipe.|$|E

The only significant aspect of the building to fall short of original expectations was the photovoltaics in the curtain wall. They had to be manufactured by the French company Saint-Gobain S.A. and shipped to Yellowknife preassembled since there were no workers there who could do that. One of the planned bands of cells had to be abandoned when the euro appreciated enough against the Canadian dollar during construction as to make its cost prohibitive.|$|E

500|$|The Department of Conservation {{has since}} 1993 carried out annual culls and muster of Kaimanawas {{to keep the}} herd {{population}} around a <b>target</b> <b>level</b> of 500 horses. The target will be reduced to 300 horses in stages starting in 2009. These horses are either taken directly to slaughter or are placed at holding farms for later slaughter or adoption by private homes. [...] A main reason for the strict population control {{is to protect the}} habitat in which they live. This habitat includes 16 plant species listed as endangered, which the Kaimanawa may endanger further through trampling and overgrazing. These plants include herbs, grasses, sedges, flowers and mistletoes; among these are Deschampsia caespitosa (a very rare tussock grass), Peraxilla tetrapetala (a vulnerable mistletoe) and Libertia peregrinans (a possibly locally extinct sand iris). The 2009 culling of the population removed 230 horses from the herd, the largest culling {{since the beginning of the}} program, with homes found for 85% of the horses removed. Conservation of these horses is an important matter to the public, and between 1990 and 2003 the New Zealand Minister for Conservation received more public comments on the Kaimanawa horse than on any other subject. In this period, more than 1,400 requests for information and letters were received, with public interest peaking in 1996 and 1997. This was due to a program of population reduction by shooting scheduled to begin implementation in 1996; due to public opposition the shooting was cancelled and a large scale muster and adoption program began in 1997. In 1997, around 1,069 horses were removed from the range and adopted, reducing the main herd to around 500, and reducing their range to around 25,000ha from around 70,000. Since 1993, a total of around 2,800 horses have been removed from the range. Only one injury resulting in the death of a horse is known to have occurred.|$|E

The current lack of transparency around lobbying activities {{and the absence of}} formal regulation mean that a hidden lobbying problem may prevail.

An analysis of 364 survey responses provides support for our expectations that both target specificity {{and the use of}} information sources to determine <b>target</b> <b>levels</b> vary with firms' environmental dynamism and task uncertainty, and with the intensity of financial incentives provided to subordinate managers.
