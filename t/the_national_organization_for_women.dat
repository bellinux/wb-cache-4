5|$|As the 1984 U.S. presidential {{election}} primary season neared its end and Walter Mondale became the likely Democratic nominee, {{the idea of}} picking a woman as his vice-presidential running mate gained considerable momentum. <b>The</b> <b>National</b> <b>Organization</b> <b>for</b> <b>Women</b> and the National Women's Political Caucus pushed the notion, as did several top Democratic figures such as Speaker Tip O'Neill. Women mentioned for the role included Ferraro and Mayor of San Francisco Dianne Feinstein, {{both of whom were}} on Mondale's five-person short list.|$|E

As part of this process, Rita Mae Brown and other lesbians who had been active in NOW were forced out. They staged a protest in 1970 at the Second Congress to Unite Women, and earned the support of many NOW members, finally gaining full acceptance in 1971.|$|E

5|$|In the U.S., <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Organization</b> <b>for</b> <b>Women</b> (NOW) {{began in}} 1966 to seek women's equality, {{including}} through the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), {{which did not}} pass, although some states enacted their own. Reproductive rights in the U.S. centred on the court decision in Roe v. Wade enunciating a woman's right to choose whether to carry a pregnancy to term. Western women gained more reliable birth control, allowing family planning and careers. The movement started in the 1910s in the U.S. under Margaret Sanger and elsewhere under Marie Stopes. In the final three decades of the 20th century, Western women knew a new freedom through birth control, which enabled women to plan their adult lives, often making way for both career and family.|$|E
5|$|Mayor Washington {{endorsed}} 18 incumbent aldermen and 5 challengers, including Shiller. Washington {{appeared at}} a joint rally with Shiller at which she announced her candidacy.

The Chicago Tribune endorsed Orbach. Shiller charged that Orbach catered to developers, displacing people {{in the wake of}} rehabilitation that priced housing {{out of the reach of}} many, and said she wanted community zoning boards, with their decisions binding on the alderman. Shiller charged that most of Orbach's campaign war chest was from developers and regular Democrats outside the ward.|$|E
