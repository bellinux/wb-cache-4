Significant disaffection had arisen within the Labor Party as to the leadership style and direction of Rudd.

He retained only Abraham Buford's regiment with him in Virginia. In February 1780, about 750 men sent by Washington under William Woodford arrived at Scott's camp in Petersburg, Virginia. Virginia authorities, fearing that the British force to the south under General Henry Clinton would turn north to Virginia, detained Scott and Woodford until {{it was clear that}} Clinton's object was Lincoln's position at Charleston, South Carolina.|$|E

In 1948 he commenced a two-year term as Deputy Chief of Staff and during this time he worked towards <b>the</b> <b>implementation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> compulsory military training scheme for the Territorial Force, which commenced in May 1950. He was dispatched to England in 1952 to attend the Imperial Defence College after which he led the New Zealand Joint Services Liaison Staff in London.

5|$|By November 1808, the Napoleonic Wars {{had lasted}} five years. Although the French had conquered large swathes of {{mainland}} Europe, {{they were unable}} to exert any significant influence at sea, where the British Royal Navy had been dominant since the Battle of Trafalgar in October 1805. A vital part of Royal Navy strategy was <b>the</b> <b>implementation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> close blockade of the major French seaports by squadrons of frigates and ships of the line, intended to intercept and capture any ships attempting to enter or leave French harbours. The greatest French Atlantic seaport, and consequently the most important target for the Royal Navy, was Brest, situated on the Northern Biscay coast. Watching Brest were a large number of warships, divided into the inshore squadron designed to watch the coast directly and formed principally of frigates and small fast vessels, and the offshore squadron formed from heavy ships of the line and tasked with intercepting French fleets and battle squadrons spotted by the inshore squadron.|$|E

5|$|Compared to neurotypical children, {{those with}} ADHD {{generally}} demonstrate greater impulsivity by being influenced by reward immediacy and quality more {{than by the}} frequency of reward and effort to obtain it. However, researchers have empirically shown that these impulsive behavior patterns can be changed through <b>the</b> <b>implementation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> simple self-control training procedure in which reinforcer immediacy competes with the frequency, quantity or saliency of the reward, and the delay is gradually increased. One study demonstrated that any verbal activity while waiting for reinforcement increases delay to gratification in participants with ADHD. In another study, 3 children diagnosed with ADHD and demonstrating impulsivity were trained to prefer reward rate and saliency more than immediacy through manipulation {{of the quality of}} the reinforcers and by systematically increasing the delay with a changing-criterion design. Post-assessment of the children illustrated that self-control can transfer to untrained dimensions of reinforcement; such as an increase in quality over immediacy preference due to direct training resulting in an increase in quantity over immediacy preference.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{both its}} {{effectiveness}} and safety, in 2009 the World Health Organization {{recommended that the}} rotavirus vaccine be offered to all children globally. Two commercial rotavirus vaccines exist and several more are in development. In Africa and Asia these vaccines reduced severe disease among infants and countries that have put in place national immunization programs have seen {{a decline in the}} rates and severity of disease. This vaccine may also prevent illness in non-vaccinated children by reducing the number of circulating infections. Since 2000, <b>the</b> <b>implementation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> rotavirus vaccination program in the United States has substantially decreased the number of cases of diarrhea by as much as 80 percent. The first dose of vaccine should be given to infants between 6 and 15 weeks of age. The oral cholera vaccine {{has been found to be}} 50–60% effective over 2years.|$|E
5|$|Lafayette was a {{firm believer}} in a {{constitutional}} monarchy. He believed that traditional and revolutionary ideals could be melded together by having a democratic National Assembly work with a monarch, as France had always had. His close relationships to Americans such as George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, who both happened to be Founding Fathers of the United States, gave Lafayette the ability to witness <b>the</b> <b>implementation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> democratic system in a country. His views on potential government structures for France were directly influenced by the American form of government, which was in turn influenced by the British form of government. For example, Lafayette believed in a bicameral legislature, as the United States had. The Jacobins, however, detested the idea of a monarchy in France; this led to it ultimately being voted against by the National Assembly. This idea only helped lead to his fall from favor, especially when Maximilien Robespierre took power.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> {{effective}} <b>implementation</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> {{integrated management}} system (IMS) is increasingly recognised as essential {{for all types}} of organisations facing today’s turbulent and competitive environment. Literature stresses that most companies could benefit from moving from the mere adoption of the International Standards Organisation (ISO) quality standards to <b>the</b> <b>implementation</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> IMS linking strategy and operations by means <b>of</b> <b>an</b> interrelated set <b>of</b> management tools. However, despite the wide range of investigated issues, scholarly literature still mainly focuses upon large organisations, and although much {{progress has been made in}} recent years, many questions on how an IMS could be implemented in small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) remain unanswered. In order to contribute to this research gap, this paper investigates the process characterising <b>the</b> effective <b>implementation</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> IMS in a leading SME and the main factors enabling the changeover from the adoption of ISO quality standards to <b>the</b> <b>implementation</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> IMS. <b>The</b> <b>implementation</b> process identified here is synthesised in a framework which can support the understanding and <b>the</b> <b>implementation</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> IMS in SMEs...|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>implementation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> uniform {{civil code}} for all {{citizens}} has not been achieved owing to widespread opposition from various religious groups and political parties. The Shah Bano case (1985–86) provoked a political firestorm in India when the Supreme Court ruled that Shah Bano, a Muslim {{woman who had been}} divorced by her husband in 1978 was entitled to receive alimony from her former husband under Indian law applicable for all Indian women. This decision evoked outrage in the Muslim community, which sought the application of the Muslim personal law and in response the Parliament passed the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986 overturning the Supreme Court's verdict. This act provoked further outrage, as jurists, critics and politicians alleged that the fundamental right of equality {{for all citizens}} irrespective of religion or gender was being jettisoned to preserve the interests of distinct religious communities. The verdict and the legislation remain a source of heated debate, with many citing the issue as a prime example of the poor implementation of Fundamental Rights.|$|E
5|$|The {{plan was}} first {{presented}} to the President of Serbia, Slobodan Milošević. Milošević found the plan wholly acceptable and promised he would ensure {{the leadership of the}} RSK eventually supported it. He endorsed the plan because it ensured the preservation of Serbian territorial gains of 1991, retained Croatian Serb administration of the areas where the peacekeepers would be deployed and allowed the JNA to shift its focus to Bosnia and Herzegovina. Vance then met Yugoslav defence minister JNA General Veljko Kadijević, who also endorsed the plan and was apparently urged by Milošević to do so. After the plan was accepted by Croatian President Franjo Tuđman, the Geneva Accord was signed by Tuđman, Milošević and Kadijević in Geneva, Switzerland, on 23 November 1991. The Accord was a precondition for the deployment of the UN peacekeeping force. It comprised four provisions; the end of the Croatian blockade of JNA barracks, the withdrawal of JNA personnel and equipment from Croatia, <b>the</b> <b>implementation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> ceasefire and the facilitation of the delivery of humanitarian aid.|$|E
