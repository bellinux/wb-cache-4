5|$|<b>The</b> <b>electrons</b> in an atom are {{attracted}} to the protons in the nucleus by the electromagnetic force. This force binds <b>the</b> <b>electrons</b> inside an electrostatic potential well surrounding the smaller nucleus, which means that an external source of energy is needed for the electron to escape.

5|$|The orbital angular {{momentum}} of electrons is quantized. Because the electron is charged, it produces an orbital magnetic moment that {{is proportional to the}} {{angular momentum}}. The net magnetic moment of an atom is equal to the vector sum of orbital and spin magnetic moments of all electrons and the nucleus. The magnetic moment of the nucleus is negligible compared with that of <b>the</b> <b>electrons.</b> The magnetic moments of <b>the</b> <b>electrons</b> that occupy the same orbital (so called, paired electrons) cancel each other out.|$|E
5|$|As <b>the</b> <b>electrons</b> {{pass through}} this complex, four protons are pumped from the matrix into the intermembrane space.

Finally, <b>the</b> <b>electrons</b> are transferred from the chain of iron–sulfur clusters to a ubiquinone molecule in the membrane. Reduction of ubiquinone also contributes to the generation of a proton gradient, as two protons are taken up from the matrix as it is reduced to ubiquinol (QH2).|$|E

5|$|In 1913 the {{physicist}} Niels Bohr proposed {{a model in}} which <b>the</b> <b>electrons</b> of an atom were assumed to orbit the nucleus but could only {{do so in a}} finite set of orbits, and could jump between these orbits only in discrete changes of energy corresponding to absorption or radiation of a photon.

For this reason, the ion temperature may be very different from (usually lower than) the electron temperature.
