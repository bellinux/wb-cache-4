5|$|In {{the wake}} of a world {{financial}} crisis, the King encouraged the formation of a National Government in 1931 led by MacDonald and Baldwin, and volunteered to reduce the civil list to help balance the budget. He was concerned by the rise to power in Germany of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party. In 1934, the King bluntly told the German ambassador Leopold von Hoesch that Germany was now the peril of the world, and that there was bound to be a war within ten years if she went on at the present rate; he warned the British ambassador in Berlin Eric Phipps <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>suspicious</b> of the Nazis.|$|E

25|$|In August 1863, {{he sought}} {{a job in}} the paymaster's {{department}} in the United States Department of War, but his application caused federal agents <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>suspicious</b> about his family's loyalties to the Union. On November 17, 1863, he was dismissed as postmaster for disloyalty.|$|E

25|$|During {{the months}} leading up to the February 26, 2012, shooting, Zimmerman called the police several times to report people he {{believed}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>suspicious.</b> On each of the calls, Zimmerman offered information about the race of the suspects only when specifically asked by the dispatcher to do so; his reports said that all were black males.|$|E
25|$|In {{accordance}} with his father's wishes, Luther enrolled {{in law school}} at the same university that year but dropped out almost immediately, believing that law represented uncertainty. Luther sought assurances about life and was drawn to theology and philosophy, expressing particular interest in Aristotle, William of Ockham, and Gabriel Biel. He was deeply influenced by two tutors, Bartholomaeus Arnoldi von Usingen and Jodocus Trutfetter, who taught him <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>suspicious</b> of even the greatest thinkers and to test everything himself by experience.|$|E
25|$|On 9 June 2014, Mayall died at {{his home}} in Barnes, Richmond-upon-Thames, London, at the age of 56. After being called to the house with a report of a sudden death at 13:19, the Metropolitan Police said that the death was not {{believed}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>suspicious.</b> His death was announced by his management team. Tributes were paid by comedy producer John Lloyd, comedian David Walliams, actor and writer Stephen Fry, surrealist and actor Noel Fielding, film director Edgar Wright, and many others.|$|E

25|$|Some {{believed}} his death <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>suspicious</b> and many theories circulated about his death. Early theories included {{a claim that}} he was murdered by a Confederate soldier from the war, or by Native Americans. In 1913 a man claimed to have carried out the murder of Meagher {{for the price of}} $8000, but then recanted. In the same vein, American journalist and novelist Timothy Egan, who published a biography of Meagher in 2016, claimed Meagher may have been murdered by Montana political enemies or powerful and still active vigilantes. On the frontier men were quick to kill rather than adjudicate.|$|E
25|$|On 23 April 2002, the {{discovery}} of a body in the River Thames prompted media speculation that the remains might be those of Dowler, but the body was identified the following day as that of 73-year-old Maisie Thomas, who went missing in March 2001, and whose death was not believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>suspicious.</b> In June 2002, despite further searches, the offer of a £100,000 reward by national tabloid newspaper The Sun and her parents continuing to send text messages to her mobile telephone in hope of a reply, Dowler remained missing. That month, police told her parents that she was probably dead.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Brother Mouzone captures Dante, {{and forces}} him to reveal Omar's hiding place. Dante gives in, in {{contrast}} with Brandon, who never cracked. Mouzone suggests an alliance against Stringer. Together, Omar and Mouzone ambush Stringer during a meeting with Andy Krawczyk and murder him. Brother Mouzone sets Dante free and returns to New York, while Omar is tasked with disposing of Mouzone's gun, {{as well as the}} shotgun that killed Stringer. Both weapons are later thrown into the harbor. Omar is shown <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>suspicious</b> of the severity of Dante's injuries and his release by Mouzone is the last time he is seen; it is implied that Omar left him for giving him up so easily.|$|E
5000|$|London Burkers, Bishop, May and Williams — These body snatchers {{also killed}} three boys, ages ten, 11 and 14 years old. The anatomist that they sold the cadavers <b>to</b> <b>was</b> <b>suspicious.</b> <b>To</b> delay their {{departure}} the anatomist {{said he needed}} to break a 50-pound note. He sent for the police who arrested the men. In Bishop's confession he stated, [...] "I have followed the course of obtaining a livelihood as a body snatcher for 12 years, and have obtained and sold, I think from 500 to 1,000 bodies.|$|R

25|$|Discussion of {{the racial}} {{elements}} of the case continued long after the trial's end. Some polls and some commentators have concluded that many blacks, while having their doubts as to Simpson's innocence, were more inclined <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>suspicious</b> of the credibility and fairness of {{the police and the}} courts, and thus more likely to question the evidence. The LAPD had a history of abusing African Americans in the city, which was emphasized in the Rodney King case. After the civil trial verdict against Simpson, most whites surveyed said they believed justice had been served. Most blacks (75%) disagreed with the verdict and believed that it was racially motivated. An NBC poll taken in 2004 reported that, although 77% of 1,186 people sampled thought Simpson was guilty, only 27% of blacks in the sample believed so, compared to 87% of whites. The Simpson case continues to be assessed through the lens of race. In 2016, FiveThirtyEight reported that most black people now think O.J. was guilty.|$|E
25|$|Sailors {{had lost}} their trust in their {{officers}}, who tended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>suspicious</b> of each other as well. Navy officers from the French Royal Navy of the Ancien Régime, the officiers rouges, openly despised the new social order {{brought about by the}} French First Republic, and were particularly frustrated by the lack of discipline generated by the philosophy of égalité, as highly detrimental to the organisation of the Navy. Nevertheless, some of these officers, the first of them Morard de Galles, were actually dedicated to the Republic and its egalitarian principles – all the more, in fact, since they hoped that the advent of the Republic would fill the authority void caused by the collapse of the monarchy. Others, such as Kerguelen or Lemarant-Boissauveur, had suffered humiliations from the naval establishment of the Ancien Régime, doubling the republican loyalty of their political convictions with personal resentment against the old order. Rear-admiral Landais would carry revolutionary fervour and suspicion to the point of denouncing Lelarge and Morard de Galles as suspect, and be considered as paranoid by Jeanbon Saint-André.|$|E
25|$|Only 24 words, out of 3,412, {{are found}} in all five branches, {{and most of these}} are words for {{recently}} introduced items, such as guns and cattle, or cultural or mythological terms which could easily be borrowed. Thus there is no good evidence for a Tasmanian language family. There is, however, slight evidence that the northern and western families may be distantly related (the western varieties are especially poorly attested). The only words found in all regions that are not obvious candidates for borrowing and which do not have serious problems with attestation are *pene- 'laugh', *taway 'go', *liya 'water', *wii 'wood', and perhaps *tina 'belly'. However, there are other local words for 'laugh', 'water', and 'belly', and the reflexes of *taway are so similar as <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>suspicious.</b> *Wii is therefore the most promising; it is found as wiya, wina, wikina (-na is a common ending) and wii, glossed as wood, tree, brush, or timber. Although {{there is no evidence that}} the Tasmanian languages were related to the languages of mainland Australia (and if they were, they would presumably be related to languages which had been lost to the wave of Pama–Nyungan expansion), the fact that there is no established Tasmanian family should be kept in mind when attempting to establish such connections.|$|E

[...] He could not associate with convicted mafiosi during his probation. [...] While the FBI suspected Vitale was a mafioso, {{he had never}} been convicted of a crime, and the FBI would have no reason <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>suspicious</b> of him associating with Massino since they were brothers-in-law. He returned to his job at King Caterers, and in 1996 became co-owner of Casablanca, a well-reviewed Maspeth Italian restaurant.|$|E
500|$|Lore then incapacitates Data, {{revealing}} {{that he plans}} to offer the ship's crew to the entity. When a signal transmission is detected from Data's quarters, Wesley Crusher (Wil Wheaton) arrives to investigate. [...] He finds Lore, now impersonating Data, who explains that he had to incapacitate his brother after being attacked. Wesley is doubtful, but pretends to accept the explanation. Soon after, the same crystalline entity that had attacked the colony approaches the ship. Lore, still pretending to be Data, enters the bridge as the object hovers before the Enterprise and explains that he incapacitated his brother by turning him off, causing Doctor Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>suspicious,</b> since Data had previously treated the existence of such a feature as a closely guarded secret. Lore then explains that he can communicate with the crystalline entity and suggests to Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) that he should show a demonstration of force by beaming an object toward the entity and then destroying it with the ship's phasers.|$|E
500|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 3 January 2008, Speight called emergency services after waking up to discover Natasha Collins's body in the bath at their St John's Wood flat, in north-west London. Speight told police that he and Collins had spent the previous evening [...] "partying", drinking wine and vodka, and taking cocaine and sleeping pills. Speight was questioned by police and was subsequently arrested on suspicion of murder and of supplying class A drugs, but was released on bail until {{the first week of}} February. Because of this, the BBC cancelled the Saturday repeat edition of SMart. An inquest, which opened on 8 January 2008, heard that the death was not thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>suspicious</b> but should be [...] "subject to further investigation". At that point, police were awaiting results of toxicology tests after a postmortem examination was inconclusive. The BBC cancelled repeat broadcasts of SMart and SMarteenies until further notice, and on 28 February Speight announced he was quitting SMart, because the [...] "tragic loss" [...] of Collins had left him unable to continue with the show. Speight denied any involvement with Collins's death, and on 19 March it was reported that the police were no longer considering Speight as a suspect.|$|E

500|$|In Present-day Boston, Emma Swan (Morrison) lives {{a lonely}} {{existence}} {{working as a}} bail bondsman and bounty hunter. She is approached by a ten-year-old boy, Henry (Jared S. Gilmore), who identifies himself as her son, whom she had given up for adoption as a teenager. Not wanting a relationship with him, Emma agrees to drive {{him back to his}} home in Storybrooke, Maine. Along the way, Henry shows her a large book of fairy tales he has, insisting that all of the stories in it are real. When they arrive in Storybrooke, Henry informs her that everyone in town is in reality a fairy tale character, exiled by the curse and with no memory of their real identities. This includes his therapist Archie Hopper (Raphael Sbarge), who is really Jiminy Cricket, and his teacher Mary Margaret Blanchard (Goodwin), who is really Snow White. Henry claims that time is frozen in Storybrooke and the people are unable to leave, but that the curse will be broken by Emma. A skeptical Emma returns Henry to his adopted mother, the town Mayor, Regina (Parrilla), who is really the Evil Queen. Emma attempts to leave but after having drunk apple cider given to her by the Mayor and nearly hitting a wolf she has a car accident where she is knocked out. She is arrested and taken to Storybrooke Jail. When Henry runs away again, Emma makes a deal with the Mayor and Sheriff Graham (Jamie Dornan): if they release her, she will find him. After exhausting all possibilities she speaks with Mary Margaret, who tells Emma to [...] "Check his castle." [...] After finding Henry at a wooden jungle gym (which bears a resemblance to Prince Charming's castle), they talk and Emma decides to stay in Storybrooke temporarily, especially after Regina warns her to leave town. This leads Emma <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>suspicious</b> of the mayor's motives.|$|E
