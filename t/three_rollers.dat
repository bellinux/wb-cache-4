50|$|The Garlstorf {{windmill}} is a Galerieholländer with a two-storey brick {{base and}} a four-storey, very narrow, slate-covered octagonal millhouse. It was erected in 1865 by the Benecke brothers from Kirchgellersen. The waisted {{shape of the}} octagonal tower was meant to reduce wind eddies around the sails and so ensure better use of the wind. The mill was initially operated by Herrmann Benecke, but then underwent several changes of ownership. It was bought in 1920 by the mill owner, Heinrich Bornemann, from Luhmühlen, who converted it in 1924 into a motor mill and in 1934 made the millhouse bigger. In 1964 the mill was operated with <b>three</b> <b>rollers</b> and a meal conveyor (Schrotgang). Thereafter it changed hands several times and was gradually closed down and converted into a residence. The internal mill machinery was removed. The present owner has carried out extensive restoration and equipped the mill with sails and a fantail again. Current state of the mill: The cap is covered with wooden shingles and equipped with an additional gallery. Like the four sails it is fixed. The cast iron shaft head (Wellenkopf), which has been drilled through, indicates that originally the mill had spring sails. The breastpiece (Bruststück) and the rods of the present sails are made of multilayered spars held together by steel clamps.|$|E
40|$|Pitching {{machine is}} widely used in venues ranging from {{professional}} baseball stadiums to batting centers. However, the throw performance of the pitching machines {{that have been developed}} so far for use during batting practice is not very high. Pitches such as the fastball, curveball and screwball are easily achieved by the pitching machine with <b>three</b> <b>rollers</b> which were developed by the authors. In this study, the moving behavior and contact stress state of the ball pitched with the <b>three</b> <b>rollers</b> type pitching machine is analyzed using dynamic finite element analysis software (ANSYS/LSDYNA). The effect of the seam of a baseball to the throw accuracy is analyzed numerically. In the analysis, the finite element models of a detailed baseball with a seam and a pitching machine with <b>three</b> <b>rollers</b> are used. Additionally, convex and concave rollers are made and those are analyzed. From the analytical results, it is understood that the convex roller is higher than other rollers in throw accuracy. The convex roller geometry is optimized, and the optimum conditions (shapes and material properties) of the convex roller are decided. Moreover, the validity of the condition is confirmed by the throw experiment. 全文公開 20091...|$|E
40|$|The {{most common}} {{commercial}} pitching machines are the “two rpllers” type {{and also the}} “arm” type. There machines tend to have certain limitations.

In this study, the hardware and software design of a new “intelligent” pitching machine which is able to pitch repeatably with selectable speed, direction and ball rotation, is presented. The machine had <b>three</b> <b>rollers</b> and the motion of each was independantly controlled by a heirarchical neural network.
