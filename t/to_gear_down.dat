25|$|A Fistful of Dollars was {{at first}} {{intended}} by Leone to reinvent the western genre in Italy. In his opinion, the American westerns of the mid- to late-1950s had become stagnant, overly preachy and not believable. Despite {{the fact that even}} Hollywood began <b>to</b> <b>gear</b> <b>down</b> production of such films, Leone knew that there was still a significant market in Europe for westerns. He observed that Italian audiences laughed at the stock conventions of both American westerns and the pastiche work of Italian directors working behind pseudonyms. His approach was to take the grammar of Italian film and to transpose it into a western setting.|$|E
50|$|The first Nemo {{applications}} for vehicles {{to be used}} on roads came in 1963-1964. Nemo was successfully tested in logging vehicle trailers. In addition to improved off-road performance the system had other benefits; a trailer with a driven front axle could be driven on the lorry platform for transition and set down when the place of loading was reached. When full laden, the Nemo {{could be used to}} assist on steep uphills: in case the driver had <b>to</b> <b>gear</b> <b>down,</b> he could switch on the hydraulic drive that was powered directly by the engine, and use clutch and change the gear without risk that the vehicle would stop going. Nemo systems were available for example for Sisu KB-117, M-162 and K-142 logging trucks.|$|E
40|$|In the article, the Great Conflict of 1980 is {{compared}} with the general strike and great lockout of 1909 and the 1945 metalworkers’ strike. Depending on how they are measured, each of them could lay {{claim to be the}} largest labour conflict in Swedish history. While the strikes of 1909 and 1945 ended up in union defeats, the outcome of the 1980 conflict was a severe setback for SAF. The 1909 LO strike and the 1980 SAF lockout both aimed at pressing a non-socialist government to intervene, but none of them was successful in this respect. During the months preceding the 1980 conflict, the centre-right government failed to present an economic-political package satisfying the labour market parties, in particular LO regarding tax adjustments acceptable for the low-income groups. The appearance for the first time of a united front of the LO and TCO public sector unions and bargaining cartels, the “Gang of Four”, complicated the bargaining round. The founding of the private sector white-collar bargaining cartel PTK seven years earlier also weakened the privileged position that the axis LO-SAF had had in the traditional Swedish model. Despite this, the overwhelming majority of strikers and locked out in the 1980 conflict was blue-collar workers in the LO-SAF area, although the participation of some public sector groups attracted great attention. A number of developments in the 1970 s formed the background to the great conflict: strong inflationary pressures due to two oil crisis and very high nominal wage increases {{in the midst of the}} decade, the first non-socialist government in Sweden for 44 years entering office in 1976 and the appointment of a new SAF president, the militant Curt Nicolin, in the same year. Nicolin set great hopes on the 1980 lockout as “an investment for the future” with the aim to change the bargaining climate for the coming decades. The great conflict of 1980 may be considered an attempt on the part of the employers to change the Swedish model of collective bargaining to radically gear down wage increases. The SAF proposals for a wage freeze (“the zero bid”) and a downsized public sector, presented as the only possible way of securing the standard of living, made up two conspicuous components of an employer strategy to change the rules of collective bargaining. After the 1980 failure, SAF adopted another concept – decentralized and individualized wage formation – <b>to</b> <b>gear</b> <b>down</b> wage increases...|$|E

50|$|Most {{electro-mechanical}} designs {{incorporate a}} lead screw and lead nut. Some use a ball screw and ball nut. In either case the screw may be connected to a motor or manual control knob either directly or {{through a series of}} gears. Gears are typically used to allow a smaller (and weaker) motor spinning at a higher rpm <b>to</b> be <b>geared</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> provide the torque necessary to spin the screw under a heavier load than the motor would otherwise be capable of driving directly. Effectively this sacrifices actuator speed in favor of increased actuator thrust. In some applications the use of worm gear is common as this allow a smaller built in dimension still allowing great travel length.|$|R

If Finger Lakes National Forest, which is managed as a unit of the Green Mountain National Forest, is included within it, GMNF is one of only two national forest northeast of the Pennsylvania-New Jersey barrier; the other being the White Mountain National Forest. Split into the southwest and central areas, GMNF has a total of eight wilderness areas.

50|$|Aspinall had {{to contend}} with violent clashes between Korean and Chinese ethnic groups who fought with knives and clubs off the shore. He {{requested}} riot <b>gear</b> <b>to</b> put <b>down</b> the violence. The incidents began when a Korean fishing boat rammed a Chinese one, ultimately causing it to sink in the storm. The governor had to separate Japanese, Chinese, and Korean vessels to keep the fishing companies running between the islands. At one point, Aspinall had to close the port of Pago Pago.|$|R
50|$|A {{sideslip}} {{may be used}} {{exclusively to}} remain lined up with a runway centerline while on approach in a crosswind or be employed in the final moments of a crosswind landing. To commence sideslipping, the pilot rolls the airplane toward the wind to maintain runway centerline position while maintaining heading on the centerline with the rudder. Sideslip causes one main landing <b>gear</b> <b>to</b> touch <b>down</b> first, followed by the second main gear. This allows the wheels to be constantly aligned with the track, thus avoiding any side load at touchdown.|$|R

5000|$|The 4.2-litre engine {{produced}} the same power as the 3.8-litre (...) and same top speed (150 mph), but increased torque approximately 10% from 240 to 283 lbft Nm. Acceleration remained {{pretty much the}} same and 0 to 60 mph times were around 6.4 seconds for both engines, but maximum power was now reached at 5,400rpm instead of 5,500rpm on the 3.8-litre. That all meant better throttle response for drivers that did not want <b>to</b> shift <b>down</b> <b>gears.</b> [...] The 4.2-litres block was completely redesigned, made longer to accommodate 5mm larger bores, and the crankshaft modified to use newer bearings. Other engine upgrades included a new alternator/generator and an electric cooling fan for the radiator.|$|R

5000|$|In {{more common}} applications, a modern, well {{designed}} and engineered fuel-injected, computer-controlled, multi-valve and optionally variable-valve timing-equipped gasoline engine using good fuel can achieve remarkable flexibility in automobile applications, with sufficient torque even at low engine speeds and a relatively flat power output from 1,500 to 6,500 RPM, allowing easy cruising and forgiving low-speed behaviour. However, achieving maximum power for strong acceleration or high road speed still requires high RPM. Though the literal power band covers {{most of the}} operating RPM range, particularly in first gear (as there is no lower <b>gear</b> <b>to</b> shift <b>down</b> to, and no [...] "flat spot" [...] in which the engine does not produce any power), the effective band changes in each gear, becoming the range limited at the upper end by either the limiter, or a point roughly located between peak power and the redline where power drops off, and {{at the lower end}} the engine's idling speed.|$|R
