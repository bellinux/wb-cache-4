5|$|A {{vote was}} held on 3 May 1965 in which the {{committee}} voted to strike against Coachella Valley grape growers. Although the strikers weren't able to negotiate a contract with <b>the</b> <b>growers,</b> they did succeed in winning higher wages. Following the success in Southern California, on 8 September 1965 the Agriculture Workers Organizing Committee voted to strike against grape growers in Delano, California, where the grape season starts in September. This strike became the first time Mexican workers, due to the decision of Cesar Chavez, did not break a strike of Filipinos; later, on 16 September 1965, Chavez's National Farm Workers Association joined the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee on the picket lines. These strikes occurred {{around the same time}} when younger Filipino Americans began a period of political self-reflection and awakening.|$|E
5|$|Land {{ownership}} was important. Most of <b>the</b> <b>growers</b> were tenant {{farmers and}} {{were given the}} right of part ownership of the land over time. Tax policies encouraging needed produce made distinctions between land use to determine tax levies. For example, the daily market availability of rose petals was important for perfumers, so cultivation of roses received a lower tax assessment. Salt production and the manufacture of salt pans were controlled by similar means. The making of ghee (clarified butter), which was sold as an oil for human consumption and as a fuel for lighting lamps, was profitable. Exports to China intensified and included cotton, spices, jewels, semi-precious stones, ivory, rhino horn, ebony, amber, coral, and aromatic products such as perfumes. Large vessels from China made frequent visits, some captained by the Chinese Admiral Zheng He, and brought Chinese products to the empire's 300 ports, large and small, on the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal. The ports of Mangalore, Honavar, Bhatkal, Barkur, Cochin, Cannanore, Machilipatnam, and Dharmadam were the most important.|$|E
5|$|These {{industrialization}} measures proved largely unsuccessful {{given that}} coca remained illegal in most nations outside Bolivia, thus depriving <b>the</b> <b>growers</b> {{of an international}} market. Campaigning against this, in 2012 Bolivia withdrew from the UN 1961 Convention which had called for global criminalisation of coca, and in 2013 successfully convinced the UN Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs to declassify coca as a narcotic. The U.S. State Department criticised Bolivia, asserting that it was regressing in its counter-narcotics efforts, and dramatically reduced aid to Bolivia to $34 million to fight the narcotics trade in 2007. Nevertheless, the number of cocaine seizures in Bolivia increased under Morales' government, as they sought to encourage coca growers to report and oppose cocaine producers and traffickers. However, high levels of police corruption surrounding the illicit trade in cocaine remained a continuing problem for Bolivia.|$|E

25|$|A modern {{outbreak}} of phylloxera {{was discovered in}} the valley in 1983 in a vineyard planted with AxR1 rootstock.

By the late 1990s nearly 75% of the affected vineyards had been replanted with phylloxera resistant rootstock. <b>The</b> <b>growers</b> in the region are currently channeling their energy to battle the Glassy-winged sharpshooter, a non-native pest that carries Pierce's disease.|$|E
40|$|Saving {{energy in}} {{greenhouses}} {{is an important}} issue for growers. Here, we present a method to minimize the total energy that is required to heat and cool a greenhouse. Using this method, <b>the</b> <b>grower</b> can define bounds for temperature, humidity, CO 2 concentration, and the maximum amount of CO 2 available. Given these settings, optimal control techniques can be used to minimize energy input. To do this, an existing greenhouse climate model for temperature and humidity was expanded to include a CO 2 balance. Heating, cooling, the amount of natural ventilation, and the injection of industrial CO 2 were used as control variables. Standard optimization settings were defined in order to compare <b>the</b> <b>grower's</b> strategy with <b>the</b> optimal solution. This optimization resulted in a theoretical 47 % reduction in heating, 15 % reduction in cooling, and 10 % reduction in CO 2 injection for the year 2012. The optimal control does not need to maintain a minimum pipe temperature, in contrast to current practice. When the minimum pipe temperature strategy of <b>the</b> <b>grower</b> was implemented, heating and CO 2 were reduced by 28 % and 10 % respectively. We also analyzed the effect of different bounds on optimal energy input. We found that as more freedom is given to the climate variables, the higher the potential energy savings. However, in practice <b>the</b> <b>grower</b> is in charge of defining the bounds. Thus, the potential energy savings critically depend on the choice of these bounds. This effect was analyzed by varying the bounds. However, because the effect can be demonstrated to <b>the</b> <b>grower,</b> <b>the</b> outcome has value to <b>the</b> <b>grower</b> with respect to decision making, an option that is not currently available in practice today. </p...|$|R

25|$|The {{union was}} poised to launch its next major {{campaign}} in the lettuce fields in 1970 when a deal between the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and <b>the</b> <b>growers</b> nearly destroyed it. Initially the Teamsters signed contracts with lettuce growers in the Salinas Valley, who wanted to avoid recognizing the UFW.

25|$|FLOC {{was founded}} in September 1967 by Baldemar Velásquez and his father. Velásquez had been deeply {{influenced}} by the ideas of César Chávez, Gandhi, and Martin Luther King, Jr. Initially, his goal was merely to organize the farmworkers {{so that they could}} cooperate with <b>the</b> <b>growers</b> to improve pay, housing, and education for the pickers. Sensing that the farmworkers would not take a 20-year-old student seriously, Velásquez relied on his father to gather the employees and get them to listen to him. He even sent volunteer organizers to Texas during the winter to talk to and organize the workers during their months away from work. But the effort largely failed, and in September 1968 Velásquez called a strike against 10 tomato growers in Ohio. Five growers signed contracts recognizing the union, agreeing to a minimum wage and limited health insurance, and promising not to discriminate against union members or union organizers. Within a few weeks, 21 other growers had agreed to contracts with FLOC as well. But in the following year, sustained anti-union opposition from <b>the</b> <b>growers</b> (backed by the American Farm Bureau Federation), the withdrawal of some growers from the tomato market, the refusal of some growers to honor their contracts, and the efforts of some growers to raise wages and improve working conditions (which led employees to abandon the union) caused Velásquez to rethink his organizing strategy.|$|E

40|$|The {{agricultural}} industry, {{because of}} seasonal nature of crops, {{is unique in}} its use of labor. The required labor force fluctuates not only {{from year to year}} but from week to week, and day to day. Not as many laborers are required to weed and cultivate as are needed to plant and harvest. Inclement weather reduces the need for workers. <b>The</b> <b>grower</b> in Indiana needs an efficient means for ensuring a supply of labor for each season. Each spring between fifteen and twenty thousand Mexican- Americans come to Indiana to plant, cultivate, and harvest its crops. Traditionally, the work force Indiana draws upon comes from Texas. It is composed largely of Mexican-American laborers who are unskilled, of a different cultural tradition, and who are often unable to communicate in English. The difficult task of locating and hiring the workers has been delegated by <b>the</b> <b>grower</b> to farm labor contractors, hereafter called crew leaders. Since <b>the</b> <b>grower</b> has traditionally relied on the crew leader for all his contracts with the work force he has developed no other efficient means of ensuring that sufficient numbers of workers will return each season. Crew leaders are given money to recruit workers from Texas in the early spring. In addition to the crew leader 2 ̆ 7 s salary <b>the</b> <b>grower</b> frequently provides him with a bonus for each worker he recruits. As a hiring inducement the crew leader loans money, provided by <b>the</b> <b>grower,</b> to pay debts accumulated by migrants during the past winter.
