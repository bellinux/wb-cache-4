Multigrid is a prime example: {{not only is it}} possible to make choices at the highest grid resolution, but a program can switch techniques as the problem is recursively attacked on coarser grid levels to take advantage of algorithms with different scaling behaviors. Additionally, users with different convergence criteria must experiment with parameters to yield a <b>tuned</b> <b>algorithm</b> that meets their accuracy requirements. Even after a <b>tuned</b> <b>algorithm</b> has been found, users often have to start all over when migrating from one machine to another. We present an algorithm and autotuning methodology that address these issues in a near-optimal and efficient manner. The freedom of independently <b>tuning</b> both the <b>algorithm</b> and the number of iterations at each recursion level results in an exponential search space of <b>tuned</b> <b>algorithms</b> that have different accuracies and performances. To search this space efficiently, our autotuner utilizes a novel dynamic programming method to build efficient <b>tuned</b> <b>algorithms</b> from the bottom up. The results are customized multigrid algorithms that invest targeted computational power to yield the accuracy required by the user. The techniques we describe allow the user to automatically generate tuned multigrid cycles of different shapes targeted to the user’s specific combination of problem, hardware, and accuracy requirements. These cycle shapes dictate the order in which grid coarsening and grid refinement are interleaved with both iterative methods, such as Jacobi or Successive Over-Relaxation, as well as direct methods, which tend to have superior performance for small problem sizes. The need to make choices between all of these methods brings the issue of variable accuracy to the forefront. Not only must the autotuning framework compare different possible multigrid cycle shapes against each other, but it also needs the ability to compare tuned cycles against both direct and (non-multigrid) iterative methods.

40|$|AbstractSatellite data product {{validation}} and algorithm {{development activities}} both require the substantial accumulation of high-quality in situ observations. Data were acquired from Ocean Colour Monitor (OCM) and in situ observations for <b>tuning</b> of Tassan’s <b>algorithm</b> (Tassan, 1994) {{to retrieve the}} suspended sediment concentration (SSC) in the coastal waters off southern Karnataka, India. Tassan’s algorithm has been modified regionally by adopting statistical/graphical criteria to characterize the spatial and seasonal distribution of SSC. A concurrent and collocated datasets (n= 120) of in situ SSC and OCM based remote sensing reflectance [Rrs(λ) in bands 490, 555 and 670 nm] were regressed. The linear fit yielded regionally tuned new coefficients which were replaced in place of Tassan’s global coefficients. The <b>tuned</b> <b>algorithm</b> was shown to retrieve SSC with range of 1. 1 – 37. 12 mg/l, which means {{it can be used}} for coastal waters. Since in situ samples were collected within the continental margin (average depth of ∼ 20 m), we retain the global SSC algorithm (Tassan, 1994) approach for deeper bathymetric values (> 50 m depth) where we have no in situ measurements. Comparative analysis indicated statistically significant relationship (R 2 = 0. 99; n= 45; p< 0. 05 at 95 % confidence level) between in situ SSC and regionally <b>tuned</b> <b>algorithm</b> based SSC, with bias of 0. 36 mg/l and root mean square (RMS) difference of 0. 73 mg/l. This result clearly demonstrated the improvement of SSC measurement from OCM using regionally <b>tuned</b> Tassan’s <b>algorithm</b> (RMS= 0. 73 mg/l) over the globally coefficient based Tassan’s algorithm (RMS= 16. 1 mg/l). The <b>tuned</b> regional <b>algorithm</b> was used to estimate SSC in 2004, 2005 and 2007 which shows the concentration varied from 1. 13 to 28. 1 mg/l in 2004, 1. 84 to 23. 12 mg/l in 2005 and 2 to 27. 85 mg/l in 2007. Graphical and statistical methods using analysis of variance (ANOVA) have shown significant seasonal variability and inter-station spatial variability in SSC. Peak concentrations were recorded in the post-monsoon followed by the pre-monsoon period. The wind, wave and current pattern associated with southwest monsoon possibly controls the seasonal distribution, while nearshore turbulence and littoral transport influence the spatial distribution.

In this dissertation, we argue that while the current architecture houses an effective design, it is not itself effective in enabling evolution.

We present some insights about architectural research that guided our work, as well as the goals we formulated for our architecture.

The tuning procedures are exemplified for both single-input-single-output as well as multivariable processes, described by first order and second order transfer functions with time delays.
