40|$|A great {{challenge}} regarding the ease-of-use of composites involves {{the development of}} 'self-adhesive' composites that no longer require a separate adhesive to bond to tooth enamel/dentin. OBJECTIVES: To characterize the interfacial ultra-structure of an experimental self-adhesive filling material bonded to enamel and dentin using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). METHODS: The experimental self-adhesive material was bonded to bur-cut human enamel and dentin, and to fractured (smear-free) dentin, strictly according to the manufacturers' instructions. The specimens were stored for 1 day in distilled water (37 °C) prior to further common specimen processing for TEM. RESULTS: The experimental self-adhesive filling material revealed a typical micro-hybrid filler distribution. At bur-cut enamel, a <b>tight</b> <b>interface</b> was formed, mostly exhibiting only tiny micro-tags without distinct surface demineralization. At bur-cut dentin, the experimental self-adhesive filling material interacted superficially, with the surface structure being more irregular because of the bur preparation. No clear resin tags were formed due to the obstruction of dentin tubules with smear plugs. At fractured dentin, {{the formation of a}} relatively thin hybrid layer of maximum a few hundreds of nanometer was disclosed without clear surface demineralization. Distinct resin tags were formed due to the absence of smear plugs. Silver-nitrate infiltration showed a pattern of spot-like appearance of nano-leakage. Ag deposition was observed more along the dentin-adhesive interface of bur-cut dentin, as compared to that of fractured dentin.

Objectives: to characterize using TEM the interaction of a self-adhesive flowable composite (Vertise Flow, Kerr) with enamel/dentin. Methods: The adhesive-free composite was applied to bur-cut (medium-grit: 100 µm) enamel, and to fractured (smear-free), 600 -grit SiC-paper ground, and bur-cut dentin, first in a thin layer (< 1 mm) using the bendable mini-brush with agitation for 15 sec, followed by 20 -sec light-curing, and application of a second increment (< 2 mm) and again 20 -sec light-curing. Non-demineralized/demineralized 70 - 90 nm sections were prepared following common TEM-specimen processing procedures, including fixation, gradual dehydration, embedding, and diamond-knife ultra-microtomy.

40|$|The low-shrinking {{composite}} {{composed of}} combined siloxane-oxirane technology (Filtek Silorane, 3 M ESPE) required {{the development of}} a specific two-step self-etch adhesive (Silorane System Adhesive), in particular because of the high hydrophobicity of the silorane composite. Objectives: to characterize using transmission TEM the interaction of this adhesive with enamel/dentin to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of adhesion. Methods: Non-demineralized/demineralized 70 - 90 nm sections were prepared following common TEM-specimen processing procedures. Results: Corresponding to the two-layered application of Silorane System Adhesive, including two separate light-curing steps, TEM revealed a typical two-fold build-up of the adhesive resin, resulting in a total adhesive layer thickness of about 20 µm. At bur-cut enamel, a <b>tight</b> <b>interface</b> was formed, mostly with only tiny micro-tags and without distinct dissolution of hydroxyapatite observable. Immersion of specimens in AgNO 3 did reveal traces of Ag along some part of the enamel-adhesive interface and/or between the two adhesive resin layers. At bur-cut dentin, a relatively thin hybrid layer of maximum a few hundreds of nanometer was formed without clear surface demineralization. No clear resin tags were formed. At fractured dentin, the interaction of Silorane System Adhesive appeared very superficial. Distinct resin tags were formed due to the absence of smear plugs. Silver-nitrate infiltration showed a varying pattern of both spot- and cluster-like appearance of nano-leakage. This nano-leakage appearance has been observed to vary widely with the region. Substantially more Ag-infiltration was observed along the dentin-adhesive interface of bur-cut dentin, as compared to that of fractured dentin. Conclusion: The nano-interaction of Silorane System Adhesive should be attributed to its relatively high pH of 2. 7. The obtained <b>tight</b> <b>interface</b> at both enamel and dentin indicates that the two-step self-etch adhesive effectively bridged the hydrophilic tooth substrate with the hydrophobic silorane composite. status: accepte...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe ArsAB ATPase confers {{metalloid}} {{resistance in}} Escherichia coli by pumping toxic anions {{out of the}} cells. This transport ATPase shares structural and perhaps mechanism features with ABC transporters. The ArsAB pump is composed of a membrane subunit that has two groups of six transmembrane segments, and the catalytic subunit, the ArsA ATPase. As {{is the case with}} many ABC transporters, ArsA has an internal repeat, each with an ATP binding domain, and is allosterically activated by substrates of the pump. The mechanism of allosteric activation of the ArsA ATPase has been elucidated at the molecular level. Binding of the activator produces a conformational change that forms a <b>tight</b> <b>interface</b> of the nucleotide binding domains. In the rate-limiting step in the overall reaction, the enzyme undergoes a slow conformational change. The allosteric activator accelerates catalysis by increasing the velocity of this rate-limiting step.

40|$|To {{ensure the}} safety of a CO 2 storage site and {{containment}} of CO 2 in the subsurface, the integrity of wellbore materials must be maintained. Field and laboratory studies have shown CO 2 -induced reactivity of wellbore cement, but these results have to be extrapolated to the extended time span of CO 2 storage. Geochemical modeling provides a tool for the prediction of cement alteration; however, large uncertainties in input parameters exist and signifi cant variation in subsurface conditionsis expected. This asks for a systematic investigation of the sensitivity of modeled cement alteration towards these factors. In this paper we report PHREEQC simulations of CO 2 diffusion into cement and subsequent chemical reactions. The sensitivity of cement alteration toward reaction rates, initial porosity, temperature/mineralogy and fl ow/no fl ow conditions were investigated. The base case model indicated that intact cement and <b>tight</b> <b>interfaces</b> between the reservoir and the cement would yield less than 1 % porosity change after 300 days of diffusion. For porosity increase or degradation to occur at the cement interface, leaching/fl ow along the wellbore was required. The sensitivity scenarios yield CO 2 penetration depths between 0. 3 cm and 1. 4 cm after 300 days of diffusion. The maximum was reached for the high porosity (fast diffusion) scenario that facilitates CO 2 transport through the cement matrix. The minimum CO 2 penetration was for enhanced calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) decalcifi cation, which increases calcite precipitation, CO 2 consumption, and hence decelerates CO 2 penetration. This is related to high temperatures (and more crystalline C-S-H) or to higher kinetic rate constants used...|$|R
30|$|In the GABAB receptor, {{the correct}} {{assembly}} of the heterodimer is ensured by the C-terminal tail: when expressed alone, GABAB 1 is retained in the ER due to a RSRR retention motif located in its C-terminal tail (Couve et al. 1998; Margeta-Mitrovic et al. 2000; Pagano et al. 2001). In the presence of GABAB 2, the retention motif is masked by a coiled-coil interaction between the subunits, thus ensuring that only correctly assembled heterodimers are trafficked to the cell surface (Margeta-Mitrovic et al. 2000; Pagano et al. 2001). However, functional GABAB receptors can assemble on the cell surface independently of the coiled-coil domains (Pagano et al. 2001). In addition to the coiled-coil domain interaction, the GABAB subunits form interactions between the VFT domains (Geng et al. 2013) and most likely also the 7 TM domains. Crystal structures of the GABAB VFT dimer show that in the resting state, they interact exclusively via a <b>tight</b> <b>interface</b> involving only one lobe, whereas in the active state a reorientation of the GABAB 1 VFT domain facilitates an additional, looser interaction between the second lobes (Geng et al. 2013).|$|E
40|$|T cell {{recognition}} typically involves {{both the}} engagement {{of a specific}} T cell receptor with a peptide/major histocompatibility complex (MHC) {{and a number of}} accessory interactions. One of the most important interactions is between the integrin lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA- 1) on the T cell and intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM- 1) on an antigen-presenting cell. By using fluorescence video microscopy and an ICAM- 1 fused to a green fluorescent protein, we find that the elevation of intracellular calcium in the T cell that is characteristic of activation is followed almost immediately by the rapid accumulation of ICAM- 1 on a B cell at a <b>tight</b> <b>interface</b> between the two cells. This increased density of ICAM- 1 correlates with the sustained elevation of intracellular calcium in the T cell, known to be critical for activation. The use of peptide/MHC complexes and ICAM- 1 on a supported lipid bilayer to stimulate T cells also indicates a major role for ICAM- 1 /LFA- 1 in T cell activation but, surprisingly, not for adhesion, as {{even in the absence of}} ICAM- 1 the morphological changes and adhesive characteristics of an activated T cell are seen in this system. We suggest that T cell antigen receptor-mediated recognition of a very small number of MHC/peptide complexes could trigger LFA- 1 /ICAM- 1 clustering and avidity regulation, thus amplifying and stabilizing the production of second messengers...|$|E

When compared to tradition biomaterial {{in the field}} such as PLA or PCL, elastomer like polyurethane offers advantages in its high elasticity and flexibility, which establish an intimate contact with surrounding bones.

In this study, a porous scaffold synthesized from segmented polyurethane is put under in vitro and in vivo tests to evaluate its potential in acting as a bone graft substitute for critical size bone defects. In vitro results indicate osteoblast-like cells are proliferating on the polyurethane scaffold during the 21 -days experiment. Cells express their normal morphology when seeded on polyurethane under fluorescent staining. Although cells show a relatively lower cell activity then that seeded on culture plate, they share a similar alkaline phosphatase activity profile with the controls during the experiment period.

40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Glycogen synthase (GS) is {{the rate}} {{limiting}} enzyme in the synthesis of glycogen. Eukaryotic GS catalyzes the transfer of glucose from UDP-glucose to the non-reducing ends of glycogen and its activity is negatively regulated by phosphorylation and allosterically activated by glucose- 6 -phosphate (G 6 P). A highly conserved cluster of six arginine residues on the C-terminal domain controls the responses toward these opposing signals. Previous studies had shown that tetrameric enzyme exists in three conformational states which are linked to specific structural changes in the regulatory helices that carry the cluster of arginines. These helices are found opposite and anti-parallel to one another {{at one of the}} subunit interfaces. The binding of G 6 P beneath the regulatory helices induces large scale conformational changes which open up the catalytic cleft for better substrate access. We solved the crystal structure of the enzyme in its inhibited state and found that the tetrameric and regulatory interfaces are more compacted compared to other states. The structural consequence of the <b>tighter</b> <b>interfaces</b> within the inhibited state of the tetramer is to lower the ability of glycogen chains to access to the catalytic cleft. Based on these observations, we developed a novel regulatory feature in yeast GS by substituting two of its conserved arginine residues on the regulatory helix with cysteines that permits its activity to be controlled by reversible oxidation/reduction of the cysteine residues which mimics the effects of reversible phosphorylation. In addition to defining the structural changes that give rise to the inhibited states, we also used X-ray crystallography to define the mechanism by which the enzyme discriminates between different UDP-sugar donors to be used as substrates in the catalytic mechanism of yeast GS. We found that only donor substrates can adopt the catalytically favorable bent conformation for donor transfer to a growing glycogen chain. 6 month...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} use of {{nanomaterials}} for bioimaging using conjugated polymer nanoparticles (CPNs) and porous silicon nanoneedles (PSNs) for intracellular biosensing. CPNs have recently started being used in biomedical research due to their outstanding optical properties, such as large extinction coefficients and high fluorescence brightness. Several strategies {{have been developed to}} stabilise their surface and provide functional groups for subsequent biomolecule conjugation. Peptides are highly customisable molecules and possess several advantages when compared to other capping ligands. A one-pot synthesis and peptide functionalisation method for CPNs using peptide amphiphiles was developed and it was shown that the presence of the peptide amphiphile did not affect the advantageous optical properties of CPNs. By using peptide amphiphiles with different characteristics, it was possible to tailor the cellular uptake of peptide-CPNs, proving the bioactivity of these nanoparticles. Importantly, none of the used peptide-CPNs demonstrated cell cytotoxicity. Other conjugated polymer (CPs) were used to synthesise peptide-CPNs of different colours, demonstrating the versatility of this method. PSNs have been developed for probing the intracellular environment for delivery or sensing. Access to the cytoplasm of cells is difficult using other methods and therefore PSNs are a suitable candidate for a biocompatible and minimally invasive approach. PSNs were functionalised to a cathepsin B (CTSB) protease cleavable peptide with an imaging moiety that would be released upon CTSB sensing. Optimal conditions for the biosensor assembly were determined in silicon chips. Moreover, two oesophageal cell lines were chosen for in vitro studies and their CTSB expression studied. Incubation of PSNs with cells showed <b>tight</b> <b>interfacing</b> without harming to cells. Finally, an intracellular pH sensor using PSNs was developed and it showed linear response in a biologically relevant window. Collectively, these results have contributed to new ways of interfacing functional nanomaterials with the cellular environment. Open Acces...|$|R
40|$|The {{interfacial}} {{interaction of}} veneering ceramic with zirconia {{is still not}} fully understood. This study aimed to characterize morphologically and chemically the zirconia-veneering ceramic interface. Three zirconia-veneering conditions were investigated: 1) zirconia–veneering ceramic fired on sandblasted zirconia, 2) zirconia–veneering ceramic on as-sintered zirconia, and 3) alumina–veneering ceramic (lower {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} [CTE]) on as-sintered zirconia. Polished cross-sectioned ceramic–veneered zirconia specimens were examined using field emission gun scanning electron microscopy (Feg-SEM). In addition, argon-ion thinned zirconia–veneering ceramic interface cross sections were examined using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) –energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) at high resolution. Finally, the zirconia–veneering ceramic interface was quantitatively analyzed for tetragonal-tomonoclinic phase transformation and residual stress using micro-Raman spectroscopy (μRaman). Feg-SEM revealed <b>tight</b> <b>interfaces</b> for all 3 veneering conditions. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) disclosed an approximately 1. 0 -μm transformed zone at sandblasted zirconia, in which distinct zirconia grains were no longer observable. Straight grain boundaries and angular grain corners were detected up to the interface of zirconia– and alumina–veneering ceramic with as-sintered zirconia. EDS mapping disclosed within the zirconia–veneering ceramic a few nanometers thick calcium/aluminum-rich layer, touching the as-sintered zirconia base, with an equally thick silicon-rich/aluminum-poor layer on top. μRaman revealed t-ZrO 2 -to-m-ZrO 2 phase transformation and residual compressive stress at the sandblasted zirconia surface. The difference in CTE between zirconia– and the alumina–veneering ceramic resulted in residual tensile stress within the zirconia immediately adjacent to its interface with the veneering ceramic. The rather minor chemical elemental shifts recorded in the veneering ceramic did not suffice to draw definitive conclusions regarding potential chemical interaction of the veneering ceramic with zirconia. Sandblasting damaged the zirconia surface and induced phase transformation that also resulted in residual compressive stress.

When compared to common biopolymers within the field such as PLA or PCL, elastomers such as polyurethane offer some unique advantages in terms of flexibility. In cases of bone defect treatments, a flexible soft filler can help to establish an intimate contact with surrounding bones to provide a stable bone-material interface for cell proliferation and ingrowth of tissue. In this study, a porous filler based on segmented polyurethane incorporated with poly l-lactic acid was synthesized by a phase inverse salt leaching method. The filler was put through in vitro and in vivo tests to evaluate its potential in acting as a bone graft substitute for critical-sized bone defects. In vitro results indicated there was a major improvement in biological response, including cell attachment, proliferation and alkaline phosphatase expression for osteoblast-like cells when seeded on the composite material compared to unmodified polyurethane.

METHODS: The nano-RMGI was used both with and without its primer, while a conventional RMGI restorative material (conv-RMGI; Fuji II LC, GC) and a packable conventional GI cement (conv-GI; Fuji IX GP, GC) were used as controls. After bonding to freshly extracted human third molars, microspecimens of the interfaces were machined into a cylindrical hourglass shape and tested to failure in tension. Non-demineralized TEM sections were prepared and examined from additional teeth. RESULTS: The microTBS to both enamel and dentin of nano-RMGI and conv-GI were not statistically different; the microTBS of non-primed nano-RMGI was significantly lower, while that of conv-RMGI was significantly higher than that of all other groups. TEM of nano-RMGI disclosed a <b>tight</b> <b>interface</b> at enamel and dentin without surface demineralization and hybrid-layer formation. A thin filler-free zone (< 1 microm) was formed at dentin. A high filler loading and effective filler distribution were also evident, with localized areas exhibiting nano-filler clustering.

For biocompatibility issues {{it is therefore}} better to avoid such monomers in dental adhesive formulations. The {{purpose of this study}} was (1) to determine the micro-tensile bond strength (muTBS) to enamel/dentin of a HEMA/TEGDMA-free three-step etch&rinse adhesive (cmf Adhesive System, Saremco), and (2) to characterize it's interfacial interaction with enamel/dentin using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). METHODS: Twelve intact freshly extracted human third molars were used for muTBS. The three-step etch&rinse adhesive OptiBond FL (Kerr) served as control adhesive. After bonding procedures and subsequent composite build-up (Z 100, 3 M ESPE), specimens were sectioned to sticks and trimmed at the interface to a cylindrical hour-glass shape. TEM section of non-demineralized and demineralized sections were prepared by ultra-microtomy and examined. RESULTS: The muTBS of the cmf Adhesive System to enamel was not statistically significantly different from that of the control (OptiBond FL) adhesive (p= 0. 3512); the muTBS to dentin was however significantly lower (p< 0. 0001). TEM showed a <b>tight</b> <b>interface</b> at enamel for both adhesives. A relatively thick, completely demineralized and acid-resistant hybrid layer was formed at dentin. Some degree of spot- and cluster-like nano-leakage was observed with cmf Adhesive System, but did not differ in extent and form in comparison to that observed with the OptiBond FL control. CONCLUSIONS: The new three-step adhesive cmf Adhesive System showed indications of good bonding effectiveness, certainly to enamel and only significantly lower to dentin, when compared to the gold-standard adhesive. The latter may be related to the adapted HEMA/TEGDMA-free formulation and the somewhat lower mechanical properties. status: publishe...|$|E
30|$|Previous studies {{indicate}} that probing cells using electronic devices are highly sensitive to the types of interfaces, as the most critical point in signal transfer from the cell to the device is the interface between these two domains [31 – 34]. In particular, the interface should have no cleft {{in order to allow}} signal transfer. The intracellular interfaces between nanowires and cells have not been investigated, and thus, these were examined in this study. Additional file 1 : Figure S 4 a of supplementary data shows a schematic drawing of the cross-sectioning process. The intracellular coupled interfaces were cross-sectioned parallel to the longitudinal direction of the nanowires using a high-resolution Cross Beam focused ion beam field emitted SEM (FIB-FESEM). The sidewall was polished with a low ion current and imaged by SEM in an in situ mode. Additional file 1 : Figure S 4 b of supplementary data shows a SEM image of the neuron-nanowire interface from the cross-section parallel to the longitudinal direction of the nanowires. The entire cross-sectional interfacial structure was well preserved, and distinct shrunken artifacts were not found. The nanowire penetrated the neuron membrane, which is attached tightly to the nanowires. These outcomes indicate that Si nanowires with diameters of < 100  nm, lengths of several micrometers, and approximate densities of 2.5 [*]×[*] 104  mm− 2 can achieve intracellular interfacing with excitable cells in a living state with <b>tight</b> <b>interfaces</b> without any cleft. This result implies that they may be suitable for probing excitable cells in an intracellular mode. Meanwhile, CNT array properties, i.e., conductivity, diameter, and length, are difficult to control for them to suit the intracellular interfacing or single cell signaling experiments. Patch clamp is conventional equipment for intracellular single cell signaling. The probe size of patch clamp is micro-scale, and the cell membrane should be broken for the probe and cell interfacing. Therefore, patch clamp is not suitable for in vivo experiment and neuronal interfaces between neuron.|$|R
40|$|Background: The BAG 6 complex {{resides in}} the cytosol and acts as a sorting point to target diverse {{hydrophobic}} protein substrates along their appropriate paths, including proteasomal degradation and ER membrane insertion. Composed of a trimeric complex of BAG 6, TRC 35 and UBL 4 A, the BAG 6 complex is closely associated with SGTA, a co-chaperone from which it can obtain hydrophobic substrates. Methodology and Principal Findings: SGTA consists of an N-terminal dimerisation domain (SGTA_NT), a central tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain, and a glutamine rich region towards the C-terminus. Here we solve a solution structure of the SGTA dimerisation domain and use biophysical techniques to investigate its interaction with two different UBL domains from the BAG 6 complex. The SGTA_NTstructure is a dimer with a <b>tight</b> hydrophobic <b>interface</b> connecting two sets of four alpha helices. Using a combination of NMR chemical shift perturbation...|$|R
40|$|SummaryThe hypothalamo-neurohypophyseal system (HNS) is the {{neurovascular}} structure {{through which}} the hypothalamic neuropeptides oxytocin and arginine-vasopressin exit the brain into the bloodstream, where {{they go on to}} affect peripheral physiology. Here, we investigate the molecular cues that regulate the neurovascular contact between hypothalamic axons and neurohypophyseal capillaries of the zebrafish. We developed a transgenic system in which both hypothalamic axons and neurohypophyseal vasculature can be analyzed in vivo. We identified the cellular organization of the zebrafish HNS as well as the dynamic processes that contribute to formation of the HNS neurovascular interface. We show that formation of this interface is regulated during development by local release of oxytocin, which affects endothelial morphogenesis. This cell communication process is essential {{for the establishment of a}} <b>tight</b> axovasal <b>interface</b> between the neurons and blood vessels of the HNS. We present a unique example of axons affecting endothelial morphogenesis through secretion of a neuropeptide...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The new three-step {{adhesive}} 'cmf adhesive system' (CMF, Saremco) {{is free of}} co-monomers such as TEGDMA and HEMA for biocompatibility reasons, {{for instance}} in prevention of allergic reactions of patients and dental staff. The {{purpose of this study}} was 1) to determine the micro-tensile bond strength (µTBS) to enamel/dentin, and 2) to characterize its interfacial interaction with enamel/dentin using transmission electron microscope (TEM). Methods: Twelve intact freshly extracted human third molars were used for µTBS. Optibond FL (OBFL, Kerr) served as control. After bonding procedures following the respective manufacturer's instructions and subsequent composite build-up (Z 100, 3 M ESPE), specimens were sectioned to 1. 8 x 1. 8 mm sticks and trimmed at the interface to a cylindrical hour-glass shape (± 1. 2 mm) using the MicroSpecimen Former (University of Iowa). TEM non-demineralised and demineralised sections, and sections of specimens immersed in ammoniacal silver nitrate were prepared by ultra-microtomy and examined (EM 900, Zeiss). Results: µTBS CMF OBFL p-value (t-test) Enamel 30. 7 ± 9. 2 MPa, n= 10 26. 7 ± 5. 0 MPa, n= 11 p= 0. 3512 Dentin 25. 7 ± 5. 8 MPa, n= 10 45. 6 ± 9. 9 MPa, n= 10 p< 0. 0001 No pre-testing failures were recorded. TEM showed a <b>tight</b> <b>interface</b> at enamel. The etch-pits produced by the 'mild' phosphoric-acid conditioner (pH= 1. 5) were rather shallow, but resulted in clearly defined micro-tags. A relatively thick, completely demineralised and acid-resistant hybrid layer was formed, varying in thickness between 1. 5 - 3 µm at dentin. The dentin tubules were opened and enabled the formation of resin tags. Some degree of spot and cluster-like nanoleakage was observed, but did not differ in extent and form in comparison to that observed with the OBFL control. Conclusion: The new three-step adhesive 'cmf adhesive system' showed clear indications of good bond reliability. status: submitte...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Among {{contemporary}} adhesives, self-etch adhesives {{have been}} adopted by general practitioners for routine adhesive restorative purposes, mainly because of their ease of use. However, many versions that differ for their clinical application procedure, pH, number of components, etc., are currently available on the market. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the bonding effectiveness of two new self-etch adhesives (Adper Easy Bond and Adper ScotchBond SE, 3 M ESPE) to enamel and dentin using a micro-tensile bond strength (microTBS) protocol and to characterise the interfacial ultra-structure at enamel and dentin using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). METHODS: The adhesives were applied onto coronal human enamel and dentin surfaces and built up with the micro-hybrid resin composite Z 100 (3 M ESPE). The 'gold-standard' two-step self-etch adhesive Clearfil SE Bond (Kuraray) served as control. Specimens were sectioned to sticks and trimmed at the interface to a cylindrical hour-glass shape ('trimmed' micro-specimens). Non-demineralized and demineralized TEM sections through the adhesive-dentin/enamel interface were prepared by ultra-microtomy. RESULTS: The microTBS of the two self-etch adhesives to enamel was statistically significantly lower than that of the control. To dentin, the microTBS of Adper Easy Bond was significantly lower than that of Adper ScotchBond SE and the control. TEM showed a <b>tight</b> <b>interface</b> to enamel for all three self-etch adhesives. A relatively thick, completely demineralized and acid-resistant hybrid layer was formed at dentin by Adper ScotchBond SE, whereas the interaction of Adper Easy Bond was much shallower, and comparable to that of so-called 'ultra-mild' self-etch adhesives. Some degree of spot- and cluster-like nano-leakage was observed for both adhesives, but did not differ in extent and form from that observed for the control. CONCLUSIONS: Although the new two self-etch adhesives revealed a tight interaction at both enamel and dentin, their bond strength to both tooth tissues was generally lower than that of the control adhesive. Nevertheless, their bonding effectiveness appears in line with other simplified self-etch adhesives. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Abstraction in {{computer}} programming {{provides a means}} of reducing complexity by emphasising the significant information (program behaviour) whilst suppressing the immaterial (program implementation). This aids program construction, improves reliability and maintainability, and eases the application of formal correctness proofs. The importance of data abstraction in the specification, design and implementation of large systems raises {{the question as to}} whether such methods may be applied in the context of programming languages designed before the widespread use of abstraction techniques. The program structuring facilities available in FORTRAN 77 support a form of encapsulation for simple data structures. In light of this mechanism provided by the language, state-based specification was found to be most appropriate. A specification technique incorporating object-oriented techniques is particularly suitable and allows a library of object classes to be specified and then implemented in sequential FORTRAN 77. Refinement extends the object classes so as to provide the commonly occurring generators for use in iterative constructs. Therefore, the advantages of data abstraction methods may be obtained in an early procedural language such as FORTRAN 77. Data abstraction provides data independence : a change in the representation for a particular class of objects affects only the code that implements the associated operations. This allows parallel implementations to be considered, without changes to the original specification or to any user-code. The provision of such parallel data structures is required for the migration of sequential systems onto parallel distributed memory architectures. As an illustration of this approach a general 2 P 2 - 2 P (for integer P≥ 3) search tree utilising a pipeline of processors in a distributed memory architecture is shown to provide a means of implementing the object classes. Variations in both the number of processors allocated to the pipeline and the value of P allows the optimal search structure for a given architecture to be determined. These structures are highly efficient leading to improvements in both throughput and response time as processors are added to the array. An efficient parallel implementation of object classes is therefore achieved within the <b>tight</b> <b>interface</b> provided by abstraction...|$|E

Among the art team was Ensemble Studios' first artist Brad Crow, who had worked on every Age of Empires game produced by the studio. The team implemented several ideas to give the game an improved core visual interface over that of its predecessors such as; increasing the field of view so that the player was able to see more on the screen, a <b>tighter</b> user <b>interface</b> to allow more of the field of play to be visible, a new building design to make them encompass less screen space [...] while also making them look more recognizable, and giving each unit a unique look and animation making them more easily distinguishable from each other.|$|R
40|$|AbstractVoltage-dependent {{potassium}} (Kv), sodium (Nav), {{and calcium}} channels {{open and close}} in response to changes in transmembrane (TM) potential, thus regulating cell excitability by controlling ion flow across the membrane. An outstanding question concerning voltage gating is how voltage-induced conformational changes of the channel voltage-sensing domains (VSDs) are coupled through the S 4 –S 5 interfacial linking helices to the opening and closing of the pore domain (PD). To investigate the coupling between the VSDs and the PD, we generated a closed Kv channel configuration from Aeropyrum pernix (KvAP) using atomistic simulations with experiment-based restraints on the VSDs. Full closure of the channel required, {{in addition to the}} experimentally determined TM displacement, that the VSDs be displaced both inwardly and laterally around the PD. This twisting motion generates a <b>tight</b> hydrophobic <b>interface</b> between the S 4 –S 5 linkers and the C-terminal ends of the pore domain S 6 helices in agreement with available experimental evidence...|$|R
