40|$|The {{cellular}} {{mechanism of}} action of <b>terikalant,</b> an investigational antiarrhythmic agent known to block the inward rectifier and other potassium currents, {{has not yet been}} fully clarified. The aim {{of the present study was}} therefore to analyse the in vitro electrophysiological effects of <b>terikalant</b> in canine isolated ventricular muscle and Purkinje fibers by applying the standard microelectrode technique. The effects of <b>terikalant</b> on the duration of action potential at a stimulation cycle length of 1000 ms and on the maximum upstroke velocity of the action potential in right ventricular papillary muscle were examined at 1, 2. 5, 10, and 20 mu M concentrations. <b>Terikalant</b> significantly prolonged the action potential duration measured both at 50 % and 90 % of repolarization in concentration-dependent manner. The maximum upstroke velocity of the action potential was unaffected at 1 and 2. 5 mu M concentrations. However, this parameter was significantly reduced at 10 and 20 mu M concentrations of <b>terikalant.</b> In Purkinje fibers <b>terikalant</b> (2. 5 mu M) also produced a marked action potential lengthening effect. Frequency dependence (cycle length of 300 - 5000 ms) of the action potential lengthening effect of <b>terikalant</b> was studied at a concentration of 2. 5 mu M. Prolongation of the duration of action potential occurred in a reverse frequency-dependent manner both in papillary muscle and Purkinje fibers, with a more pronounced frequency-dependence observed in Purkinje fibers. The onset kinetics of the <b>terikalant</b> (10 mu M) induced block of the maximum upstroke velocity of the action potential was rapid (0. 6 +/- 0. 1 beat(- 1) n= 6) like that of Class I/B antiarrhythmics, and the offset (recovery) kinetics of the drug (2956 696 ms, n= 6) best resembled that of Class I/A antiarrhythmic drugs. It was concluded that <b>terikalant,</b> unlike pure Class III antiarrhythmic drugs, has combined mode of action by lengthening repolarization and blocking the inward sodium current in a use-dependent manner...|$|E
40|$|The proarrhythmic {{activities}} of the selective IKr blocker erythromycin and the less selective K+ channel blockers, <b>terikalant</b> and clofilium, have been compared in an α 1 -adrenoceptor-stimulated, anaesthetized rabbit model. <b>Terikalant</b> (2. 5, 7. 5 and 25 nmol kg− 1 min− 1; n= 10), erythromycin (133, 400 and 1330 nmol kg− 1 min− 1; n= 8), clofilium (20, 60 and 200 mg kg− 1 min− 1; n= 10) or vehicle (n= 8) was infused intravenously over 19 min {{and there was a}} 15 -min interval between each infusion. QT and QTc intervals, and epicardial monophasic action potential duration were prolonged significantly (and to a similar extent) only by clofilium and <b>terikalant.</b> The total incidences of torsade de pointes were 60 %*, 20 %, 0 % and 0 % in clofilium-, terikalant-, erythromycin- and vehicle-treated animals, respectively (*P< 0. 05 compared to vehicle control). In conclusion, <b>terikalant</b> exerted mild proarrhythmic activity though it prolonged repolarisation markedly. Despite being given in high doses, erythromycin neither prolonged repolarisation nor induced proarrhythmia...|$|E
40|$|The {{kinetics}} of shortening {{of action}} potential duration (APD) following {{an increase in}} pacing rate, from 2 to 3. 3 [*]Hz, was characterized in guinea-pig ventricular preparations. <b>Terikalant</b> (RP 62719), an inhibitor of the inwardly rectifying K+ current (IK 1), and dofetilide, a specific inhibitor of the rapidly activating delayed-rectifier current (IKr), were applied {{to determine the effect}} of inhibition of these ion currents on slow APD shortening. Action potentials were recorded from isolated guinea-pig ventricular myocytes using the perforated-patch patch-clamp technique, and monophasic action potentials were recorded from Langendorff-perfused guinea-pig ventricles using a contact epicardial probe. Under control conditions, after an increase in pacing rate, APD immediately decreased, and then shortened slowly with an exponential time course. In ventricular myocytes, the time constant of this exponential shortening was 28 ± 4 [*]s and the amount of slow shortening was 21. 9 ± 0. 9 [*]ms (n= 8) for an increase in rate from 2 to 3. 3 [*]Hz. Similar values were observed in Langendorff-perfused ventricles. <b>Terikalant</b> dose-dependently increased APD and the increase was enhanced by rapid pacing (‘positive' rate-dependence). The drug dose-dependently decreased the time constant of shortening and amount of slow APD shortening. In contrast, dofetilide, an inhibitor of IKr, which shows ‘reverse' rate-dependent APD widening, had no significant effect on the time constant or amount of slow shortening. These observations suggest that IK 1 plays a role in rate-dependent shortening of APD. The results appear to support the hypothesis that ‘reverse' rate-dependent effects of IKr blockers are due to these drugs not affecting the ion current(s) mediating intrinsic rate-dependent slow shortening of APD...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{acquired}} long QT syndrome results {{most often}} {{from the action}} of I(Kr) blocking-drugs on cardiac repolarization. We have evaluated a transgenic (TG) mouse (FVB) overexpressing a dominant-negative KvLQT 1 isoform, as an in vivo screening model for I(Kr) blocking drugs. RESULTS: In TG mice, six-lead ECGs demonstrated sinus bradycardia, atrioventricular block, and QTc prolongation. Various drugs were injected intraperitoneally after blockade of the autonomic nervous system and serial ECGs were recorded. The end of the initial rapid phase of the T wave corrected for heart rate using a formula for mouse heart (QTrc), {{was used as a}} surrogate for the QT interval. Dofetilide, a specific I(Kr) blocker, did not prolong the QTrc interval either in TG or in wild-type (WT) mice but dose-dependently lengthened the sinus period in TG mice but not in WT mice. Other I(Kr) blockers including E 4031, haloperidol, sultopride, astemizole, cisapride and <b>terikalant</b> behaved similarly to dofetilide. Tedisamil, a blocker of the transient outward current, dose-dependently prolonged the QTrc in WT mice but not in TG mice and also reduced the sinus rhythm in both WT and TG mice. Lidocaine dose-dependently shortened the QTrc interval in TG mice and also lengthened the P wave duration. Nicardipine dose-dependently shortened QTrc and also produced sinus arrest in both WT and TG mice. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that KvLQT 1 -invalidated TG mice discriminates in vivo drugs that blocks I(Kr) from drugs that block the transient outward current, the sodium current or the calcium curren...|$|E
40|$|In the rat hepatic artery, the acetylcholine-induced {{relaxation}} {{mediated by}} endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF) is abolished {{by a combination}} of apamin and charybdotoxin, inhibitors of small (SKCa) and large (BKCa) conductance calcium-sensitive potassium (K) -channels, respectively, but not by each toxin alone. The selective BKCa inhibitor iberiotoxin cannot replace charybdotoxin in this combination. Since delayed rectifier K-channels (KV) represent another target for charybdotoxin, we explored the possible involvement of KV in EDHF-mediated relaxation in this artery. The KV inhibitors, agitoxin- 2 (0. 3 [*]μM), kaliotoxin (0. 3 [*]μM), β-dendrotoxin (0. 3 [*]μM), dofetilide (1 [*]μM) and <b>terikalant</b> (10 [*]μM), each in combination with apamin (0. 3 [*]μM) had no effect on the EDHF-mediated relaxation induced by acetylcholine in the presence of Nω-nitro-L-arginine (0. 3 [*]mM) and indomethacin (10 [*]μM), inhibitors of nitric oxide (NO) synthase and cyclo-oxygenase, respectively (n= 2 – 3). Although the KV inhibitor margatoxin (0. 3 [*]μM) was also without effect (n= 5), the combination of margatoxin and apamin produced a small inhibition of the response (pEC 50 and Emax values were 7. 5 ± 0. 0 and 95 ± 1 % in the absence and 7. 0 ± 0. 1 and 81 ± 6 % in the presence of margatoxin plus apamin, respectively; n= 6; P< 0. 05). Ciclazindol (10 [*]μM) partially inhibited the EDHF-mediated relaxation by shifting the acetylcholine-concentration-response curve 12 fold to the right (n= 6; P< 0. 05) and abolished the response when combined with apamin (0. 3 [*]μM; n= 6). This combination did not inhibit acetylcholine-induced relaxations mediated by endothelium-derived NO (n= 5). A 4 -aminopyridine-sensitive delayed rectifier current (IK(V)) was identified in freshly-isolated single smooth muscle cells from rat hepatic artery. None of the cells displayed a rapidly-activating and -inactivating A-type current. Neither charybdotoxin (0. 3 [*]μM; n= 3) nor ciclazindol (10 [*]μM; n= 5), alone or in combination with apamin (0. 3 [*]μM; n= 4 – 5), had an effect on IK(V). A tenfold higher concentration of ciclazindol (0. 1 [*]mM, n= 4) markedly inhibited IK(V), but this effect was not increased in the additional presence of apamin (0. 3 [*]μM; n= 2). By use of membranes prepared from rat brain cortex, [125 I]-charybdotoxin binding was consistent with an interaction at a single site with a KD of approximately 25 [*]pM. [125 I]-charybdotoxin binding was unaffected by iberiotoxin (0. 1 [*]μM, n= 6), but was increased by apamin in a concentration-dependent manner (Emax 43 ± 10 %, P< 0. 05 and pEC 50 7. 1 ± 0. 2; n= 7 – 8). Agitoxin- 2 (10 [*]nM) displaced [125 I]-charybdotoxin binding by 91 ± 3 % (n= 6) and prevented the effect of apamin (1 [*]μM; n= 6). It is concluded that the EDHF-mediated relaxation in the rat hepatic artery is not mediated by the opening of either KV or BKCa. Instead, the target K-channels for EDHF seem to be structurally related to both KV and BKCa. The possibility that a subtype of SKCa may be the target for EDHF is discussed...|$|E
