50|$|The {{main goal}} of a {{mechanical}} self-steering gear is to keep a sailboat on a given course towards the apparent wind and to free the helmsman from the steering job. An advantageous side effect is that the sails are kept in optimal angle towards the apparent wind and deliver optimal propulsion force by that. Even in sailboats running under engine, the self steering gear {{can be used to}} keep the boat heading into the wind to easily set or change sails (exception: sheet-to-tiller principle).As wind direction sensors are used a) a wind vane mounted on an axis being tilted more or less towards the horizon (wind vane self-steering)b) the pressure of the wind in the sail(s) and by that the force on the sheet (sheet <b>to</b> <b>tiller</b> self-steering).|$|E

25|$|The {{plant has}} a {{branching}} root system with one primary root that reaches {{deeply into the}} moist soil. Buckwheat has triangular seeds and produces a flower that is usually white, although can also be pink or yellow. Buckwheat branches freely, as opposed <b>to</b> <b>tillering</b> or producing suckers, causing a more complete adaption to its environment than other cereal crops. The seed hull density is {{less than that of}} water, making the hull easy to remove.|$|R
40|$|Cereals and grasses adapt their {{structural}} {{development to}} environmental {{conditions and the}} resources available. The primary adaptive response is a variable degree of branching, called tillering in cereals. Especially for heterogeneous plant configurations the degree of tillering varies per plant. Functional–structural plant modeling (FSPM) is a modeling approach allowing simulation of the architectural development of individual plants, culminating in the emergent behavior at the canopy level. This paper introduces the principles of modeling tillering in FSPM, using (I) a probability approach, forcing the dynamics of <b>tillering</b> <b>to</b> correspond to measured probabilities. Such models are particularly suitable to evaluate the effect structural variables on system performance. (II) Dose–response curves, representing a measured or assumed response of <b>tillering</b> <b>to</b> an environmental cue.

5000|$|In 2002 Robert Chicken {{patented}} a sheet <b>to</b> <b>tiller</b> {{system in}} the UK, known as The Steersman. It consists of two swinging platforms fitted on to the cockpit coamings {{either side of the}} boat,. The normal jib sheet winches are moved from their normal position and then re-bolted down on to the top of these platforms.With the sails set, the leeward jib sheet is cleated to the winch in the normal way, and the wind pressure in the jib, transmitted through the jib sheet, swings the platform forward. To balance this movement, a shock cord spring tensioned between the platform and a point at the stern of the boat, keeps the platform in a central neutral position. Once set, any slight changes in wind strength or direction, causes the platform to swing forwards or backwards. A simple linkage then transmits this movement to the helm to keep the boat on course.The pressure in the sails can vary hugely depending on the wind strength and the direction that the boat is travelling relative to the wind. To accommodate this, the spring is arranged in a ‘block-and-tackle’ form with a double block fitted to the stern of the boat, and a single block clipped to the platform. The fixed end, and tail end are also attached to the platform; the fixed end is clipped, and the tail end passes through a jamb cleat for fine adjustment. With this in place, the maximum spring tension is now made up of four lengths of shock cord. For a lower wind pressure in the jib, the fixed end, and the single block can be re-clipped to an attachment point on the base of the platform. This then gives a range of spring strengths from one to four shock cord lengths. For very light wind pressures, a single lighter length of shock cord is used instead.The claimed benefit of this design over a windvane system that it [...] "is far more sensitive because it uses the larger jib area to sense any changes in the wind" [...] is questionable. When the jib is in laminar flow, i.e. optimally trimmed and delivers maximum propulsion, the force at the sheet is biggest and decreases to both sides of course deviation from this optimum. Concluding from that, the ship must be sailed with sub-optimal sail trim in order to have the proper steering correction at the tiller. Its position in the cockpit area however leaves the stern of the boat clear for other purposes such as dinghy davits, stern ladders etc. In 2012, the invention won the Haven Academy Award in the UK. The chairman of the judging committee was Sir Robin Knox-Johnston, the first person to complete a circumnavigation non-stop, single handed.|$|E
