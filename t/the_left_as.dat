5|$|Alexander made a {{cautious}} and slow advance, intending to base his strategy {{on the structure}} of the Persian force. He led a flank of his Companion cavalry on the right, while the Thessalian cavalry were dispatched to <b>the</b> <b>left,</b> <b>as</b> a counter to Nabarsanes' mounted unit. Aware {{of the importance of the}} foothills to his right, Alexander sent a band of light infantry, archers, and cavalry to displace the defence Darius had stationed there. The enterprise was successful – those Persians not killed were forced to seek refuge higher in the mountains.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} Metroid {{was influenced}} by two other major Nintendo franchises: Mario, from which it borrowed extensive areas of platform jumping, and The Legend of Zelda, from which it borrowed non-linear exploration. The game differed in its atmosphere of solitude and foreboding. Metroid {{was also one of}} the first video games to feature an exploration to <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>as</b> well as the right, and backtracking to already explored areas to search for secret items and paths.|$|E
5|$|Next, {{the train}} passes through two {{consecutive}} horseshoe turns, {{first to the}} right and then to <b>the</b> <b>left.</b> <b>As</b> the name suggests, Horseshoe turns are highly banked horseshoe-shaped turns which feature track entering from roughly the same direction as where it exits. As the train exits the second horseshoe, it swoops down and begins a 270-degree helix to the right, which leads into the ride's second inversion, an inline twist. The inline twist sees riders perform a full rotation around the track, starting from a position where they are facing downward. After completing the twist, the train reaches the brake run and a final right-hand turn that leads back into the station.|$|E

Harris Mine is visible to <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>as</b> the road {{proceeds}} {{around the base}} of Echo Mountain. To the southeast of Lindley Mountain, Arden Valley Road turns east and into the park. Arden Valley Road passes Lake Cohasset and Upper Lake Cohasset as it heads eastward. The road intersects with the Long Path and RamapoDunderbergAppalachian Trails soon afterward. Bradley Mine is visible to the left, and Arden Valley Road comes to an end at Tiorati Circle., where the road continues eastward as Tiorati Brook Road.|$|E
5|$|Within Singapore, the {{national}} flag {{takes precedence over}} all other flags, subject to international practice. As such, when it is displayed or flown with other flags, it must {{be in a position}} of honour; that is, it should be positioned, where practical, either above all other flags or, if displayed side by side with other flags on the same level, {{to the left of the}} other flags (as seen by a person facing the flags). When the flag is raised or carried in a procession with other flags, it must be done so in front of the other flags in a single file, or on the right as seen by the standard bearers if the flags are carried side by side (i.e., on <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>as</b> seen by the viewer). The standard bearer must carry the flag high on his or her right shoulder.|$|E
25|$|The SWM {{changed its}} name to the Socialist Workers Party at its conference in 1995, after delegates from Dublin Bus argued that it should now take itself seriously on <b>the</b> <b>left,</b> <b>as</b> it then had a growing and active membership.|$|E

25|$|While the {{majority}} of snakes eat a variety of prey animals, there is some specialization by some species. King cobras and the Australian bandy-bandy consume other snakes. Snakes of the family Pareidae have more teeth {{on the right side}} of their mouths than on <b>the</b> <b>left,</b> <b>as</b> the shells of their prey usually spiral clockwise.|$|E

25|$|A half-mile later, {{the line}} comes to Perranwell railway station, nearly four miles from Truro. A modern shelter is {{situated}} on the platform, built in a style inspired by older railway buildings. As with all stations except for Truro, the platform is on <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>as</b> the train travels towards Falmouth. In the forecourt is the old Cornwall Railway goods shed.|$|E
25|$|Under the South station, the premetro and metro tracks swap {{from running}} {{on the right to}} {{running on the}} left where they run {{parallel}} to provide cross-platform interchange between the two lines. This serves no apparent purpose, but may be because main line trains in Belgium run on the left. Trams cross back to the right under Place Bara but the metro stays on <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>as</b> far as the Roi Baudouin terminus.|$|E
25|$|Taxes: Sarkozy avoided {{taking a}} {{position}} on the ISF (solidarity tax on wealth). This is considered an ideological symbol by many on the left and right. Some in the business world and on the liberal right, such as Alain Madelin, wanted it abolished. For Sarkozy, that would have risked being categorised by <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>as</b> a gift to the richest classes of society at a time of economic difficulties.|$|E

25|$|In May 1945, {{after a year}} {{of growing}} hostility between the {{president}} and the assembly, which was vainly awaiting deeds to substantiate Velasco's rhetorical advocacy of social justice, the mercurial chief executive condemned and then repudiated the newly completed constitution. After dismissing the assembly, Velasco held elections for a new assembly, which in 1946 drafted a far more conservative constitution that met with the president's approval. For this brief period, Conservatives replaced <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>as</b> Velasco's base of support.|$|E
25|$|The XXIV Corps had {{followed}} the VI Corps' advance and by 9:00a.m., Wright met Ord and Gibbon in the Confederate works, they decided that since the Confederate defense had collapsed in this area, they would turn their combined force toward the city. By about 10:00a.m., Ord and Wright were moving 15,000 men in a line facing northeast, with Ord {{on the right and}} Wright on <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>as</b> they advanced on the city with the idea of attempting to break the western defenses of Petersburg.|$|E
25|$|In 2005 he took {{an active}} part in the {{campaign}} in favour of the European constitution during the French referendum. The treaty was considered by a large part of <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>as</b> a European version of globalisation, and Cohn-Bendit became loathed by treaty opponents as one of the symbols of centre-left leaders collaborating with neo-liberalism through international institutions, along with Pascal Lamy from the Socialist Party. He also singled himself out by appearing publicly with right-wing leaders, contrarily to the tactics adopted by the Green Party and the centre-left during that campaign.|$|E

25|$|Most {{of the men}} {{dismounted}} {{and formed}} a line of battle several rows deep. They advanced up the hill, Todd and McGary in the center, Trigg on the right, Boone on <b>the</b> <b>left.</b> <b>As</b> Boone had suspected, Caldwell's force was waiting on the other side, concealed in ravines. When the rebels reached the summit, the Indians opened fire at close range with devastating accuracy. After only five minutes, the center and right of the rebel line fell back. Only Boone's men on the left managed to push forward. Todd and Trigg, easy targets on horseback, were shot dead.|$|E
25|$|For many years, the {{orthodox}} {{view in the}} People's Republic of China was that after the demonstrations in 1919 and their suppression, the discussion {{became more and more}} political. People like Chen Duxiu and Li Dazhao shifted more to the left and were among the leading founders of the 1921 Communist Party of China, whilst other intellectuals, such as the anarchist writer and agitator, Ba Jin also took part in the movement. Originally voluntarist or nihilist figures like Li Shicen and Zhu Qianzhi made similar turns to <b>the</b> <b>Left</b> <b>as</b> the 1920s saw China become increasingly turbulent.|$|E
25|$|Train 2D57, the 19:09 {{service from}} London Waterloo to Effingham Junction, became derailed on the {{approach}} to Epsom at about 19:42 on Tuesday 12 September 2006. The train was formed of two four-car class 455 electric multiple units (EMUs). The leading bogie of the fourth coach was derailed towards <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>as</b> it passed over a set of trailing points on a right-hand curve at about 17 miles per hour (27km/h).
