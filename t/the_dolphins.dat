5|$|In Japan, {{the hunting}} {{is done by}} {{a select group of}} fishermen. When a pod of {{dolphins}} has been spotted, they're driven into a bay by the fishermen while banging on metal rods in the water to scare and confuse <b>the</b> <b>dolphins.</b> When <b>the</b> <b>dolphins</b> are in the bay, it is quickly closed off with nets so <b>the</b> <b>dolphins</b> cannot escape. <b>The</b> <b>dolphins</b> are usually not caught and killed immediately, but instead left to calm down over night. The following day, <b>the</b> <b>dolphins</b> are caught one by one and killed.|$|E

5|$|The Patriots first {{played the}} Miami Dolphins in 1966 in the AFL, when Miami {{was one of}} two {{expansion}} teams to debut that year in that league. <b>The</b> <b>Dolphins</b> dominated the Patriots in the 1970s and 1990s, but the two teams remained competitive with each other for years before the rise of Tom Brady. Brady, however, struggled occasionally against <b>the</b> <b>Dolphins</b> in the 2000s before reasserting dominance in the 2010s. The Patriots and Dolphins are the only two teams in the Super Bowl era to post undefeated regular season records, with Miami going 14-0 in 1972 and the Patriots going 16-0 in 2007. Notable moments between the clubs include the Snowplow Game, three playoff matchups, and <b>the</b> <b>Dolphins</b> revealing their Wildcat offense against the Patriots.|$|E
5|$|Commercial 'dolphin encounter' {{enterprises}} and tours operate in many countries. The documentary film The Cove documents how dolphins are captured {{and sold to}} some of these enterprises (particularly in Asia) while the remaining pod is slaughtered. In addition to such endeavors, the individuals swim with and surface near surfers at the beach. Bottlenose dolphins perform in many aquaria, generating controversy. Animal welfare activists and certain scientists have claimed that <b>the</b> <b>dolphins</b> do not have adequate space or receive adequate care or stimulation. However, others, notably SeaWorld (backed by different scientists), counter that <b>the</b> <b>dolphins</b> are properly cared for, have lots of environmental stimulation and enjoy interacting with humans.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A dolphin had {{previously}} been trained to perform a cross-modal matching-to-sample task. In one version of this task the animal had to investigate a sample object that was concealed in a box through its echolocation sense alone, then select the correct match among up to three alternative objects visually in air. Given the frequency range of a <b>dolphin</b> click and <b>the</b> limited number of sensors that <b>the</b> <b>dolphin</b> receives <b>the</b> sonar returns with, <b>the</b> <b>dolphin</b> should have difficulties resolving {{the details of the}} object. We suggested earlier that <b>the</b> <b>dolphin</b> might be using synthetic aperture to gain a higher resolution of the stimulus. To test this hypothesis we proposed to restrict the movement of <b>the</b> <b>dolphin</b> by stationing him on a bite-plate that was fixed in front of the box that contained the sample object. We trained <b>the</b> <b>dolphin</b> to station on the bite-plate while performing the cross-modal task (echolocation to vision) while recording the sound field around <b>the</b> <b>dolphin</b> through a 16 -hydrophone array that was placed in a variety of positions and configurations between the object and <b>the</b> <b>dolphin</b> stationed on <b>the</b> bite-plate. The acoustic data were recorded at 500 kHz and later analyzed. To our surprise <b>the</b> <b>dolphin</b> was still able to perform the discrimination task. In this paper, we present the analysis of the data collected and show that <b>the</b> <b>dolphin</b> employs techniques such as beam steering and beam shaping while acoustically interrogating the object. This suggests that while <b>the</b> <b>dolphin</b> might still employ a synthetic aperture when possible, he might not need it to resolve the details of the object. We are planning to extend the range of objects to new and unfamiliar objects to explore whether <b>the</b> <b>dolphin</b> is indeed able to resolve details of the object acoustically without the need for synthetic aperture.

Then one day people has caught <b>the</b> <b>dolphin</b> and taken it to the Dolphinarium to participate in the shows with other trained <b>dolphins.</b> However, <b>the</b> <b>dolphin</b> remains completely indifferent to new environment and the shows, because it cannot live without its element — the sea.

40|$|The primary {{function}} {{of this research}} project has been to investigate the physical properties of the lower jaw of <b>the</b> Atlantic Bottlenose <b>Dolphin</b> (Tursiops truneatus).

The geometric array formed by <b>the</b> <b>dolphin</b> teeth of <b>the</b> lower jaw can be used to form an end-fire array which produces a beam pattern similar to those of <b>the</b> <b>dolphin.</b> <b>The</b> geometric array has also been analysed for its passive acoustical properties, in particular its ability to form acoustic stop bands within the audible range of <b>the</b> <b>dolphin.</b> <b>The</b> results of this research show that the directivity of <b>the</b> <b>dolphin</b> can be reproduced using the morphological features of the lower jaw.
