500|$|Reactions to the {{transmissions}} were mixed. Many fans {{felt the}} transmissions disrupted {{the flow of}} the concerts. Most of the British press was highly critical. One writer for NME wrote, [...] "The Bosnian linkup was beyond bad taste. It was insulting." [...] Bono thought that they were bringing the public's attention to an important event, though he admitted that the link-ups were the most difficult thing the band had done in their career. Guitarist The Edge said, [...] "We don't normally see that kind of cold hard news. We get a very sanitized, editorialized take on everything... When you watch the television news, you are getting something palatable, whereas this was really quite unpalatable most of the time. And for that reason I think it affected people very much, including us." [...] Mullen worried that the band were exploiting the Bosnians' suffering for entertainment. During a transmission from the band's concert at Wembley Stadium, three women in Sarajevo asked what the band intended <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> before telling Bono, [...] "We know you're {{not going to do anything}} for us. You're going to go back to a rock show. You're going to forget that we even exist. And we're all going to die." [...] During a transmission to a Glasgow concert, a Bosnian woman told the concert audience, [...] "We would like to hear the music, too, but we hear only the screams of wounded and tortured people and raped women." [...] Some people were upset by the circumstances of Sarajevo and were motivated to join the War Child charity project, including U2 producer Brian Eno. Despite U2's obligation to the tour and their inability to perform in Sarajevo during the war, they vowed to play the city someday.|$|E

There's a lot of things I haven't done I want to do, and I'll also do some things I have <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> the statehood cause".

When Ramírez was asked by the media if she will vote for Fortuño, she replied [...] "My vote is secret".|$|E
60|$|Her {{father said}} she had plenty <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> her mother. From her parents she would never get more than a hit in the face. She was not a {{practical}} person.

60|$|In the meantime, {{we had no}} {{idea what}} <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> the captain, nor any other thought but that he had got his death-hurt in the scuffle with the stranger.

It was a happy relief for us when the door opened and Doctor Livesey came in, on his visit to my father.|$|E

When I was shut up in that forest I longed for some one to help me, and by and by Ojo came and did help me. So I'm willing to help his uncle.
