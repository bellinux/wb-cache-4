Salt attracts moisture and makes shells more vulnerable to Bynesian decay.|$|E
5|$|By 1 March, over {{two-thirds of}} BuzzFeed users polled responded that {{the dress was}} white and gold. Some people have {{suggested}} that the dress changes colours on its own. Media outlets noted that the photo was overexposed and had poor white balance, causing its colours <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>washed</b> out, giving rise to the perception by some that the dress is white and gold rather than its actual colours.|$|E

At the bowling alley, before the championship game begins, Burns gives the team new shirts. Two pins away from victory, Burns takes his turn. Otto tips over a vending machine and the vibrations help the Pin Pals win by knocking down the pins. As the team celebrates their win, Burns takes the trophy and keeps it for himself.

5|$|The {{chemical}} {{reacts with}} moisture {{on the skin}} and in the eyes, causing a burning sensation and the immediate forceful and uncontrollable shutting of the eyes. Effects usually include tears streaming from the eyes, profuse coughing, exceptional nasal discharge that is full of mucus, burning in the eyes, eyelids, nose and throat areas, disorientation, dizziness and restricted breathing. It will also burn the skin where sweaty and/or sunburned. In highly concentrated doses it can also induce severe coughing and vomiting. Almost all of the immediate effects wear off within an hour (such as exceptional nasal discharge and profuse coughing), although the feeling of burning and highly irritated skin may persist for hours. Affected clothing will need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>washed</b> several times or thrown away.|$|E
5|$|In the 1920s, {{the street}} became a centre for nightclubs, {{attracting}} clientele such as Edward, Prince of Wales, Rudolph Valentino, Noël Coward, Fred Astaire and Charlie Chaplin. The Café de Paris opened in 1924 {{in the basement}} of the Rialto Cinema (which had opened in 1913) and became a popular club through the rest of the decade because of the owner Martin Poulsen's friendship with the Prince of Wales. On 8 March 1941, the Cafe and much of Coventry Street suffered significant damage from bombing as part of the Blitz, killing 84 people including Poulsen, though former Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin, visiting the cafe, survived. Owing to a lack of water, a leg wound had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>washed</b> with champagne as it was the only suitable substance to hand. The restaurant was rebuilt after the war and became a private venue in 1957. The Flamingo Club, a jazz nightclub, started on Coventry Street in 1952. It moved in 1957 to Wardour Street, where it became a popular venue for British rhythm and blues.|$|E

25|$|Unlike other 4x4s {{such as the}} Jeep Wagoneer, the {{original}} Range Rover was not designed as a luxury-type vehicle. While certainly up-market compared to preceding Land Rover models, the early Range Rovers had fairly basic, utilitarian interiors with vinyl seats and plastic dashboards that were designed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>washed</b> down with a hose. Convenience features such as power steering, carpeted floors, air conditioning, cloth/leather seats, and wooden interior trim were fitted later.|$|E
25|$|The biblical {{regulations}} of Yom Kippur require the officiating Jewish High Priest to bathe himself in water after sending off the scapegoat to Azazel, {{and a similar}} requirement was imposed on the person who led the scapegoat away, {{and the person who}} burned the sacrifices during the rituals of the day.

25|$|The first-generation devices {{relied on}} the same {{colorimetric}} reaction that is still used nowadays in glucose test strips for urine. Besides glucose oxidase, the test kit contains a benzidine derivative, which is oxidized to a blue polymer by the hydrogen peroxide formed in the oxidation reaction. The disadvantage of this method was that the test strip had to be developed after a precise interval (the blood had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>washed</b> away), and the meter needed to be calibrated frequently.|$|E
25|$|Conversion of {{vegetable}} oil to biodiesel is via a transesterification reaction, where the triglyceride {{is converted to}} the methyl ester plus glycerol. This is usually done using methanol and caustic or acid catalysts, but can be achieved using supercritical methanol without a catalyst. The method of using supercritical methanol for biodiesel production was first studied by Saka and his coworkers. This {{has the advantage of}} allowing a greater range and water content of feedstocks (in particular, used cooking oil), the product does not need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>washed</b> to remove catalyst, and is easier to design as a continuous process.|$|E
25|$|After {{the body}} of Uthman {{had been in the}} house for three days, Naila, Uthman's wife, {{approached}} some of his supporters to help in his burial, but only about a dozen people responded. These included Marwan, Zayd ibn Thabit, 'Huwatib bin Alfarah, Jubayr ibn Mut'im, Abu Jahm bin Hudaifa, Hakim bin Hazam and Niyar bin Mukarram. The body was lifted at dusk, and because of the blockade, no coffin could be procured. The body was not washed, as Islamic teaching states that martyrs' bodies are not supposed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>washed</b> before burial. Thus, Uthman was carried to the graveyard in the clothes that he was wearing {{at the time of his}} assassination.|$|E

25|$|Belt {{filters are}} less {{effective}} at processing some feeds. Unless the feed is well mixed from a digester, {{the use of}} belt filters will be more costly when processing a feed with varying solids content as this requires more operator attention, raising staffing costs. Feeds with high grease and oil content can lower the solids percentage in the cake by blinding the belt filter and all feeds need to be screened to protect the belt from being damaged by sharp objects. The type of feed may also affect the washing process. The belt filter needs <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>washed</b> frequently which consumes large amount of water and time. Water and time wastage, {{as well as the}} associated costs can be reduced by automating the washing system and using effluents.|$|E
25|$|As {{a topical}} agent {{and as a}} beta-hydroxy acid (and unlike alpha-hydroxy acids), {{salicylic}} acid is capable of penetrating and breaking down fats and lipids, causing moderate chemical burns of the skin at very high concentrations. It may damage the lining of pores if the solvent is alcohol, acetone or an oil. Over-the-counter limits are set at 2% for topical preparations expected to be left on the face and 3% for those expected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>washed</b> off, such as acne cleansers or shampoo. 17% and 27% salicylic acid, which is sold for wart removal, should not {{be applied to the}} face and should not be used for acne treatment. Even for wart removal, such a solution should be applied once or twice a day – more frequent use may lead to an increase in side-effects without an increase in efficacy.|$|E
25|$|The club's colors {{at first}} were not cream. They {{started out with}} a white kit which had the badge on the chest. During one of their early seasons, Universitario could not {{participate}} in an upcoming match because their uniforms had been sent to the laundry <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>washed.</b> The managers pleaded that they hurry with the laundry and they quickly washed them. However, when the club received the jerseys, they found that they were no longer white, but yellow. The laundry workers had forgotten to remove the badges from the jerseys and consequently the red color from the badges mixed with the white jerseys giving it a yellow tint. The club {{had no choice but to}} use the jersey to play. They managed to win that game and a few others as well and thus the club kept the new-colored kit as a good-luck charm.|$|E

25|$|In 1992 a {{campaign}} was organised against poorings {{out by a}} vocal minority of students who claimed victimisation. College authorities banned poorings out {{on the basis of}} legal liability in 1993. Rather than simply disappearing, the tradition of the pooring out has merely evolved to suit the contemporary climate. Today, pooring out is an honour generally reserved for students elected to prominent positions in the college, particularly the Student Heads. Both men and women may now be poored out; however the actual practice is most often gender segregated. For example, a man of college is defended by men and poored out by men, while a woman of college is defended by women and poored out by women. On account of the administration’s aforementioned hostility to the practice, they are no longer supposed to take place on college grounds and are absolutely forbidden in Strachan Hall. Rather, poorings-out now often occur during The Lit. However, their actual form has changed little. The student selected to be poored out lies across a table while three of his fellow students lie across him to defend him. The assemblage is then rushed by the upper year students, who shred the gown of the person, while removing his or her defenders. Once a student has been poored out, they wear the remains of their gown bound as a sash. The gown is never <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>washed,</b> mended or sewn and must be worn in its original state as a sign of pride for the experiences of the student whilst at Trinity.|$|E
