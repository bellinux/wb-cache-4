5|$|Finally, Universal's conduct {{amounted}} to {{an abuse of}} judicial process, {{and in that sense}} caused a longer harm to the public as a whole. Depending on the commercial results, Universal alternatively argued to the courts, first, that King Kong {{was a part of the}} public domain, and then second, that King Kong was not part of the public domain, and that Universal possessed exclusive trademark rights in it. Universal's assertions in court were based not on any good faith belief in their truth, but on <b>the</b> <b>mistaken</b> belief that it could use the courts to turn a profit.|$|E

5|$|Oriel {{has three}} notable pieces of medieval plate. The {{first is a}} French beaker and cover in silver gilt; past {{estimates}} on its dating from 1460–70 are thought mistaken, and circa 1350, with later decoration, was later expounded. It was bought in 1493 for £4.18s.1d., under <b>the</b> <b>mistaken</b> belief that it had belonged to Edward II. In a college inventory of plate dated 21 December 1596, it is named as the Founder's Cup.|$|E
5|$|The Australian {{military}} {{conducted an}} intensive search for I-174 {{in the days}} after the attack in <b>the</b> <b>mistaken</b> belief that she had been significantly damaged. This search was not successful and highlighted the unsatisfactory communications between the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) and Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). However, another Japanese submarine passing through the area may have been sunk by RAAF aircraft. Because of Japan's deteriorating strategic situation, I-174 was the last Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) submarine to operate off the Australian east coast.|$|E

Authors Benedict Crowell and Robert Forrest Wilson, in their work The Road to France: The Transportation of Troops and Military Supplies, 1917–1918, repeat the misinformation {{about the loss of}} West Bridge.|$|E

After finding himself in a fight, Hines jumped several fences and made his way to Detroit's wharf. He waited for a {{ferryboat}} to empty its passengers and then forced the captain at gunpoint to take him across the Detroit River to Canada. On arrival, Hines apologized to the captain and gave him five dollars. Hines' exploit led to <b>the</b> <b>mistaken</b> rumor that Booth had escaped into Canada.|$|E
5|$|Use of {{traditional}} motifs sometimes leads to <b>the</b> <b>mistaken</b> notion that these textiles serve a purpose in Navajo religion.

5|$|By {{the evening}} of 8 April, the Yugoslav Supreme Headquarters was under <b>the</b> <b>mistaken</b> {{impression}} that {{the situation in the}} 4th Army's area of operation was relatively good, believing the penetration of German troops had been temporarily halted. However, the effect of the rebellions and desertions within the 4th Army was significant within the flanking 2nd and 7th Armies, and contributed to further withdrawals. This was particularly marked {{in the area of the}} 7th Army, which was forced to withdraw from the Drava on the night of 8/9 April due to the situation in the 4th Army on its right flank, leading to the loss of Maribor.|$|E
5|$|Following the German {{collapse}} in November 1918, {{a significant portion}} of the High Seas Fleet was interned in Scapa Flow. Nassau and her three sisters were not among the ships listed for internment, so they remained at German ports. During this period, from November to December, Hermann Bauer served as the ship's commander. On 21 June 1919, Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, under <b>the</b> <b>mistaken</b> impression that the Armistice would expire at noon that day, ordered his ships be scuttled to prevent their seizure by the British. As a result, the four Nassau-class ships were ceded to the various Allied powers as replacements for the ships that had been sunk. Nassau was awarded to Japan on 7 April 1920, though the Japanese had no need for the ship. They, therefore, sold her in June 1920 to British shipbreakers, who scrapped the ship in Dordrecht.|$|E
5|$|Harada {{was born}} in the village of Asajawa in Nagano Prefecture on 11 August 1916. After {{completing}} school, he joined the Imperial Japanese Navy's naval infantry force in 1933, aged 17. He later transferred to the Navy's aviation branch, and graduated first in the 35th pilot training class in February 1937. Harada was posted to China in October that year during the Second Sino-Japanese War, but was not involved in any aerial combat. While in China he witnessed Japanese military personnel indiscriminately killing Chinese civilians in <b>the</b> <b>mistaken</b> belief that they were soldiers in disguise. He also participated in the USS Panay incident. Harada returned to Japan in January 1938, and subsequently served in several training positions.|$|E

5|$|Navigating {{through the}} smoke slowed progress, and <b>the</b> <b>mistaken</b> use by the First Canadian Army of yellow smoke to {{identify}} their positions—the same colour strategic bombers used to mark targets—led to some bombing of the Canadians and slower progress than planned. On 15 August, the 2nd and 3rd Canadian Infantry Divisions and the 2nd Canadian (Armoured) Brigade continued the offensive, but progress remained slow. The 4th Armoured Division captured Soulangy against determined German resistance and several German counter-attacks, which prevented a breakthrough to Trun. The next day, the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division entered Falaise against minor opposition from Waffen SS units and scattered pockets of German infantry, and by 17 August had secured the town.|$|E
5|$|Phantom Blood begins {{during an}} ancient Aztec ritual, {{where a man}} splatters a sacrifice's blood onto the stone mask he wears. It shoots hooks into his skull, {{and he says that}} he has become immortal. In England in 1880, a boy named Dio Brando is adopted by the wealthy Joestar family {{following}} Dio's father Dario's death; this was done as thanks under <b>the</b> <b>mistaken</b> belief that Dario had saved George Joestar and his newborn son Jonathan during a stagecoach accident twelve years prior, when Dario had in reality only been attempting to loot corpses. Intending to inherit the Joestar fortune, Dio presents himself to George as a gentleman, while also bullying Jonathan, using violence, incinerating Jonathan's dog Danny, and forcefully kissing Erina Pendleton, Jonathan's girlfriend. During a fight between Jonathan and Dio, some blood touches the stone mask – now owned by George – leading Dio to learn how it works.|$|E
5|$|Preceding the Vietnam War {{the high}} speeds {{aircraft}} were attaining {{led to a}} move to remove the cannon due to <b>the</b> <b>mistaken</b> belief {{that they would be}} useless in a dogfight, but combat experience during the Vietnam War showed conclusively that despite advances in missiles, there was still a need for them. Nearly all modern fighter aircraft are armed with an autocannon and they are also commonly found on ground-attack aircraft. One of the most powerful examples is the 30mm GAU-8/A Avenger Gatling-type rotary cannon, mounted exclusively on the Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II. The Lockheed AC-130 gunship (a converted transport) can carry a 105mm howitzer as well as a variety of autocannons ranging up to 40mm. Both are used in the close air support role.|$|E

Johnson County officials were upset that the group was not kept locally at Ft. McKinney. The general in charge of the 6th Cavalry felt that tensions were too high for the prisoners to remain in the area. Hundreds of armed locals sympathetic to both sides of the conflict were said to have gone to Ft.

5|$|The green rosella or Tasmanian rosella (Platycercus caledonicus) is {{a species}} of parrot native to Tasmania and Bass Strait islands. It was {{described}} by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in 1788, and named on <b>the</b> <b>mistaken</b> assumption it came from New Caledonia. At 37cm (14.5in) long {{it is the largest}} species of the rosella genus, Platycercus. Two subspecies are recognised. The green rosella's underparts, neck and head are yellow, with a red band above the beak and violet-blue cheeks. The back is mostly black and green, and its long tail blue and green. The sexes have similar plumage, except the female has duller yellow plumage and more prominent red markings, as well as a smaller beak. Juvenile and immature birds have predominantly green plumage.|$|E
5|$|According {{to those}} historians, the Spanish {{revolution}} against absolutism got {{mixed up with}} the Peninsular War. When FerdinandVII stood against his father CharlesIV, who {{was seen as an}} absolutist king, many Spaniards got <b>the</b> <b>mistaken</b> impression that he sympathized with the new enlightened ideas. Thus, the revolutions made in the Americas in the name of FerdinandVII (such as the May Revolution, the Chuquisaca Revolution, or the one in Chile) would have sought to replace absolutist power with power formulated under the new ideas. Even if Spain was at war with France, the ideals of the French Revolution (liberty, equality and fraternity) were still respected. Those revolutions pronounced themselves enemies of Napoleon, but did not face any active French military attack; they promoted instead fights between Spanish armies for keeping either the old or new order. This situation would change with the final defeat of Napoleon and the return of FerdinandVII to the throne, as he began the Absolutist Restoration and persecuted the supporters of the new libertarian ideas within Spain. For people in South America, to stay {{as a part of the}} Spanish Empire, but with a new relationship with the mother country, was no longer a feasible option: the only remaining options at this point were to return to absolutism or to adopt independentism.|$|E
