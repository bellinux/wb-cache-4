5|$|After seeing Nankiwi in the plane, a {{small group}} of Huaorani decided to make the trip to Palm Beach, and left the {{following}} morning, January 7. On the way, they encountered Nankiwi and the girl, returning unescorted. The girl's brother, Nampa, was furious at this, and to defuse the situation and divert attention from himself, Nankiwi claimed that <b>the</b> <b>foreigners</b> had attacked them on the beach, and in their haste to flee, they had been separated from their chaperone. Gikita, {{a senior member of the}} group whose experience with outsiders had taught him that they could not be trusted, recommended that they kill <b>the</b> <b>foreigners.</b> The return of the older woman and her account of the friendliness of the missionaries was not enough to dissuade them, and they soon continued toward the beach.|$|E
5|$|His origins are unknown, {{but he was}} {{probably}} not a native Englishman. He may have been German or Norman. The historian Katharine Keats-Rohan suggests that he was possibly the nephew of Peter, who was the Bishop of Chester and a Norman. His name was a German or French name, which suggests that Regenbald was one of <b>the</b> <b>foreigners</b> that gained favour with King Edward the Confessor.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Foreigner</b> {{hired an}} assassin {{to assume the}} {{identity}} of Blaze to fire-bomb the Black Cat's apartment. Disguised as Lieutenant Kris Keating, <b>the</b> <b>Foreigner</b> killed Blaze and framed Spider-Man for the job. As Keating, <b>the</b> <b>Foreigner</b> escaped an assassination attempt by the Rose. He finally battled Spider-Man for the first time, and was betrayed by the Black Cat. <b>The</b> <b>Foreigner</b> hired <b>the</b> Hobgoblin to steal an incriminating ledger from <b>the</b> Kingpin. <b>The</b> <b>Foreigner</b> was defeated by Silver Sable in a fencing duel. Blood Rose hired <b>the</b> <b>Foreigner,</b> who in turn hired the Hunters and the New Enforcers {{to bring down the}} remnants of the Kingpin's empire.|$|R
50|$|He {{possesses}} a near-mystic ability {{to place an}} opponent in a 10-second hypnotic trance through eye-contact, which makes the opponent believe <b>the</b> <b>Foreigner</b> can move faster than the eye can see. He has hypnotized Spider-Man in this fashion, which left Spider-Man disoriented or in a light trance {{for a few seconds}} while <b>the</b> <b>Foreigner</b> ran away at what seemed to be nearly superhuman speed; from Spider-Man's perspective it appeared that <b>the</b> <b>Foreigner</b> had teleported away. <b>The</b> <b>Foreigner</b> uses this ability for evading enemies.|$|R
50|$|At {{some time}} in <b>the</b> past <b>the</b> <b>Foreigner</b> trained <b>the</b> superhuman mutant known as Sabretooth. He has since distanced himself from his former novice.

5|$|The demonologist Pierre de Lancre (1553–1631) {{boasted that}} even dead French monarchs could heal; it was, indeed, still {{believed}} in the 16th century that the healing power was retained by Saint Louis IX's arm, preserved in Poblet Monastery in Catalonia. In order to be touched by the French king, people traveled from as far off as the present-day Italy and Spain already in the 13th century. <b>The</b> <b>foreigners</b> were ranked in a specific order, with the Spanish taking precedence over all others and the king's own subjects coming last.|$|E
5|$|The later 860s saw a {{reduction}} of activity by the Foreigners—although the Annals indignantly report that they plundered the ancient burial mounds at Newgrange, Knowth, and Dowth in 863—with the Dublin forces active in Pictland and in the six months' siege of Dumbarton Rock. Áed Findliath took advantage of these absences to destroy the Viking fortresses {{in the north of}} Ireland. Amlaíb left Ireland for good in 871 and Ímar died in 873. With their disappearance, there were frequent changes of leadership among <b>the</b> <b>Foreigners</b> {{and a great deal of}} internecine conflict is reported for the following decades.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about Atangana's childhood. Like other Beti boys, he would have learned to fish, hunt, and trap, and would have {{memorised}} his family's genealogy and folk wisdom. Explorers from the German Empire appeared near his village in 1887 {{in search of a}} direct route to the ivory trade in the savannas to the north. They had claimed Beti lands as part of their Kamerun colony in 1884, and by February 1889 they had established a permanent base in the area, which they named Jaunde after the local people. The Ewondo opposed <b>the</b> <b>foreigners</b> at first, although Atangana was probably not yet old enough to participate in the fighting. After the defeat of Omgba Bissogo in 1895 and others like it, Ewondo resistance waned. The Germans randomly appointed chiefs and mayors to serve under them, and took local youths to perform menial tasks; Atangana was among them, sent by his uncle to be a houseboy.|$|E

50|$|During the {{shooting}} of the song Unnazhagi at Brindavan, a foreigner visiting India requested permission to shoot the scenes with his camera, and permission was granted. Both the cinematographer and <b>the</b> <b>foreigner</b> simultaneously shot <b>the</b> song and dance sequence from the same angles. Zoom technique was unknown to Indian film technicians those days, but <b>the</b> <b>foreigner's</b> camera had it. When the crew learnt this, they requested <b>the</b> <b>foreigner</b> to provide {{a copy of his}} version {{to be used in the}} film, and he obliged. Though <b>the</b> <b>foreigner</b> had used 16mm, the crew managed to use some zoom shots taken by him in the film. Thus, Uthama Puthiran became the first Indian film to have the shots with zoom technique.|$|R
40|$|Native speaker {{will do a}} {{negotiation}} of language they have {{in order to make}} <b>the</b> <b>foreigner</b> understand more about what they are saying.

5|$|On {{the eve of}} the coup, Rainivoninahitriniony {{informed}} Lambert that {{he could}} not guarantee the support of the army and that the plot should be aborted. One of the officers believed the brothers had betrayed them and sought to exonerate himself by notifying the queen of the failed conspiracy. She reacted by expelling <b>the</b> <b>foreigners</b> from the island and subjecting all the implicated Merina officers to the tangena ordeal in which they were forced to swallow a poison to determine their guilt or innocence. Rainilaiarivony and his brother were excepted from this and remained, like her son Radama, in the queen's confidence for the few remaining years of her life.|$|E
5|$|Plutarch {{mentions}} that the Athenians saw the phantom of King Theseus, the mythical hero of Athens, leading {{the army in}} full battle gear in the charge against the Persians, and indeed he was depicted in the mural of the Stoa Poikile fighting for the Athenians, along with the twelve Olympian gods and other heroes. Pausanias also tells us that: They say too that there chanced {{to be present in}} the battle a man of rustic appearance and dress. Having slaughtered many of <b>the</b> <b>foreigners</b> with a plough he was seen no more after the engagement. When the Athenians made enquiries at the oracle, the god merely ordered them to honor Echetlaeus ("he of the Plough-tail") as a hero.|$|E
5|$|Roman {{slavery was}} {{not based on}} race. Slaves were drawn from all over Europe and the Mediterranean, {{including}} Gaul, Hispania, Germany, Britannia, the Balkans, Greece... Generally slaves in Italy were indigenous Italians, with a minority of foreigners (including both slaves and freedmen) born outside of Italy estimated at 5% of the total in the capital at its peak, where their number was largest. Those from outside of Europe were predominantly of Greek descent, while the Jewish ones never fully assimilated into Roman society, remaining an identifiable minority. These slaves (especially <b>the</b> <b>foreigners)</b> had higher mortality rates and lower birth rates than natives, and were sometimes even subjected to mass expulsions. The average recorded age at death for the slaves {{of the city of}} Rome was extraordinarily low: seventeen and a half years (17.2 for males; 17.9 for females).|$|E

Madoc is forced to fight other condemned men, until Madoc's Welsh allies attack the city, allowing a woman, Coatel, to free Madoc and Hoel. At the same time the Aztec warrior Amalahta attacks Caermadoc, but is defeated by the Welsh women. When Madoc returns, he joins the Welsh and Hoamen forces, and the battle continues until Madoc kills the Aztec king, Coanocotzin.|$|E
5|$|The Catholic {{community}} in Afghanistan is mainly made of foreigners, especially aid workers, and no Afghans {{are known to}} be currently part of the Church, mainly due to great social and legal pressure not to convert to non-Islamic religions. Some Afghans have converted while overseas, but they keep it secret when they return. Two Christian groups, Church World Service and Norwegian Church Aid, were accused of proselytizing while doing aid work in Afghanistan, which they denied, and 1,000 Afghans protested in Mazar-i-Sharif and burned the pope in effigy. Despite this, the community has grown from only a few sisters to a full Sunday Mass of around 100. Church attendance dipped in 2012 due to security concerns and less emphasis on religion among <b>the</b> <b>foreigners</b> in Afghanistan in recent years.|$|E
5|$|The Rhodesian Army, though mostly made up {{of local}} men, also {{included}} some foreign volunteers, who were integrated into regular units under the same salary and conditions of service. Almost all of <b>the</b> <b>foreigners</b> served in the Rhodesian Light Infantry (RLI), a heliborne commando battalion with a glamorous international reputation. The RLI initiated a major overseas recruitment drive in 1974, targeting potential volunteers from Europe, Oceania and the Americas, and requiring successful applicants to speak good English. This campaign was bearing considerable fruit by May 1976, when the RLI's largest ever intake included more foreign volunteers than any before, and the enlisting of men from overseas into the RLI would increase yet further. By 1977–78 there were around 1,500 foreigners in the Rhodesian forces. However, the Rhodesian Army remained stretched and low on manpower.|$|E

25|$|Reflecting this vacillation, some Chinese {{soldiers}} were quite liberally firing at foreigners under siege from its very onset.

Prince Duan led the Boxers to loot his enemies within the imperial court and <b>the</b> <b>foreigners,</b> although imperial authorities expelled Boxer troops after they were let into the city and went on a looting rampage against both the foreign and the Qing imperial forces.

25|$|In view of {{the humiliation}} of Chōshū forces against the Western powers, Takasugi {{had come to the}} {{realization}} that direct confrontation with <b>the</b> <b>foreigners</b> was not an option. Instead, Japan had to learn military tactics, techniques and technologies from the West. Takasugi reorganized his Kiheitai militia into a rifle-unit with the latest modern rifles, and introduced training in Western strategy and tactics. Moreover, Takasugi used his influence with the Sonnô Jôi-movement to promote a more a conciliatory policy towards the West and thus, the ‘movement to expel the barbarians and revere the Emperor’ evolved into an anti-Bakufu movement with the overthrow of the Tokugawa Bakufu as a necessary means to strengthen Japan against <b>the</b> <b>foreigners.</b>|$|E

Eventually, he defeated the Black Cat himself and then decided, instead of executing her, to start a romantic relationship with her and use her under the pretense of forming an alliance in order to destroy Spider-Man (all the while the true ulterior motive being to enlist the membership of Spider-Man as an assassin in his 1400 Club). Spider-Man turned him down and Foreigner was forced to abandon that identity.|$|R
