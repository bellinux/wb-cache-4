500|$|Monitors turret {{measured}} [...] {{in diameter}} and [...] high, constructed with [...] of armor (11 inches in front at the gun ports) rendering the overall vessel somewhat top heavy. Its rounded shape helped to deflect cannon shot. A pair of donkey engines rotated the turret {{through a set of}} gears; a full rotation was made in 22.5 seconds during testing on 9 February 1862. Fine control of the turret proved to be difficult as the engine would have to be placed in reverse if the turret overshot its mark or another full rotation could be made. The only way to see out of the turret was through the gun ports; when the guns were not in use, or withdrawn for reloading during battle, heavy iron port stoppers would swing down into place to close the gunports. Including the guns, the turret weighed approximately the entire weight rested on an iron spindle that had to be jacked up using a wedge before the turret could rotate. The spindle was [...] in diameter which gave it ten times the strength needed in preventing the turret from sliding sideways. When not in use, the turret rested on a brass ring on the deck that was intended to form a watertight seal. In service, however, this proved to leak heavily, despite caulking by the crew. [...] The gap between the turret and the deck proved to be a problem as debris and shell fragments entered the gap and jammed the turrets of several s, which used the same turret design, during the First Battle of Charleston Harbor in April 1863. Direct hits at the turret with heavy shot also had the potential to bend the spindle, which could also jam the turret. To gain access to the turret from below, or <b>to</b> <b>hoist</b> <b>up</b> powder and shot during battle, the turret had to rotate facing directly to starboard, which would line up the entry hatch in the floor of the turret with an opening in the deck below. The roof of the turret was lightly built to facilitate any needed exchange of the ship's guns and to improve ventilation, with only gravity holding the roof plates in place.|$|E
60|$|The Snark is a sail-boat. She {{was built}} {{primarily}} to sail. But incidentally, as an auxiliary, a seventy-horse-power engine was installed. This is a good, strong engine. I ought to know. I {{paid for it}} to come out {{all the way from}} New York City. Then, on deck, above the engine, is a windlass. It is a magnificent affair. It weighs several hundred pounds and takes up no end of deck-room. You see, it is ridiculous <b>to</b> <b>hoist</b> <b>up</b> anchor by hand-power when there is a seventy-horse-power engine on board. So we installed the windlass, transmitting power to it from the engine by means of a gear and castings specially made in a San Francisco foundry.|$|E

6000|$|It {{was full}} twelve o'clock, {{and the last}} rope was being loosed from the moorings. [...] "Ting-ting," [...] went the engine-room bell. [...] "Thud-thud," [...] started the great screw that would not stop again for so many restless hours. The huge vessel shuddered {{throughout}} her frame like an awakening sleeper, and growing quick with life, forged {{an inch or two}} a-head. Next, a quartermaster, came with two men <b>to</b> <b>hoist</b> <b>up</b> the gangway, when suddenly a boat shot alongside and hooked on, amongst the occupants of which Arthur had no difficulty in recognizing Mrs. Carr, who sat laughing, like Pleasure, at the helm. The other occupants of the boat, who were not laughing, he guessed to be her servants and the lady who figured on the passenger-list as Miss Terry, a stout, solemn-looking person in spectacles.|$|E
60|$|A {{thorough}} examination was now made. An exact {{inventory of the}} provisions was taken, {{and the amount of}} water on board was ascertained, the boatswain's stores were gone over, and were found to be well supplied with rope, sail-cloth, and other necessaries. A calculation was then made as to the amount that would be required for the future strength of the crew for a three months' cruise. The boat was then rowed back to the Tigre. As soon as they arrived there, and reported to the first lieutenant what was required, a signal was made to the gun-boat to send one of her boats ashore at once with water-casks, and to fill up the tanks. A party was set to work <b>to</b> <b>hoist</b> <b>up</b> the barrels of stores, according to the list handed in by Wilkinson, while Edgar was sent on shore with forty men, with an order to the Turkish commander of artillery, to hand over to him two 18-pounders and as much ammunition for them and the 14-pounder guns as could be provided.|$|E
60|$|One {{afternoon}} in the summer-time, Jenny Naylor, his granddaughter, had company, and after they had been playing around the orchard {{for an hour or}} two, and had slid down the straw-stacks to their heart's content, the children all went to the well to get a drink. A bucket of water was soon hauled up, and Tommy Barrett with a tin-cup ladled out the refreshment to the company. When they had all drank enough they began to play with the well-pole. Boys and girls will play, you know, with things that no grown person would imagine could be tortured into means of amusement. In less than five minutes they had invented a game. That is, the boys had. I will give the girls the credit of standing by and looking on, in a very disapproving manner, while this game was going on. The pastime was a very simple one. When the stone-end of the pole rested on the ground, on account of the bucket being empty, one of the boys stood by the well-curb, and, seizing the rope as high up as he could, pulled upon it, the other boys lifting the stone-end at the same time. When the stone was a foot or two from the ground the boys at that end sat on the pole and endeavored <b>to</b> <b>hoist</b> <b>up</b> the fellow at the other end.|$|E
500|$|The {{ship was}} barque-rigged {{and had a}} sail area of [...] Her funnel was semi-retractable to reduce wind {{resistance}} while under sail alone.

500|$|... "People wanting soup came {{in through}} an 18-inch wide brick-lined {{corridor}} {{one at a time}} to be served from troughs. Nine copper boilers were {{on the first floor of}} the building with storage below where raw materials were weighed <b>to</b> be <b>hoisted</b> <b>up.</b> They were making 100 gallons of soup at a time, that’s 800 people all queuing at the back of the building." ...|$|R
50|$|Canal houses {{usually had}} a {{basement}} and a loft and attic where trade goods could be stored.

5000|$|The 1965-1966 Texas Western {{basketball}} team faced many issues {{because of their}} color. For example, when they won the championship no one brought out a ladder for them to cut down the net. Nevil Shed had <b>to</b> <b>hoist</b> <b>up</b> Willie Worsley so he could do the honors. Also, they were never invited on [...] "The Ed Sullivan Show," [...] which was customary for the NCAA Champions. Texas Western (UTEP) winning the championship, started {{the integration of the}} Southeastern Conference admitting their first black basketball player in 1967.|$|E
5000|$|Once inside, {{customers}} {{could buy}} a drink at the long bar. The bar was made in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania, shipped on the Star of India around the tip of South America {{to the west coast}} of Mexico, then wagon trained the rest of the way. The main hall contained a 15 by 15 ft stage about 5 ft above the main floor, and an orchestra pit. The stage was lit by a row of gas jets along the front side. [...] There were fourteen boxes on two balconies {{on either side of the}} main hall. A dumbwaiter at the end of the bar was used <b>to</b> <b>hoist</b> <b>up</b> the whiskey, beer and cigars to the patrons in the box seats.|$|E
60|$|There was {{an instant}} stir on board. Some of the men ran to the capstan, others began to unlace the sail covers, while some {{gathered}} at the davits <b>to</b> <b>hoist</b> the boat <b>up</b> directly she came alongside.|$|R

5|$|The quatrefoil gunports in {{the lower}} levels {{could have been used}} for both hand cannons and crossbows, with {{overlapping}} fields of fire.

5000|$|St. Peter's {{bell tower}} is unique. The bell {{was a gift}} from the Sunday school {{children}} at St. Peter's Church in Philadelphia. It arrived in October 1874, but the church in Tacoma had no belfry. Loggers cut off the top of a tree growing next to the church and a crew of sailors used the ship's rigging <b>to</b> <b>hoist</b> it <b>up</b> on the stump. The rings of the tree were counted when the tree was cut, revealing that it was over 300 years old. The tree claimed fame as [...] "the oldest bell tower in America". The original tree stump was damaged by a windstorm in 1935 and had to be replaced.|$|R

[...] As he descended {{he saw that the}} well was an ancient one, and probably at one time had been carried very much lower than at present. In some places the masonry had fallen in. At one of these points there was an opening cut into the rock. He called to those above <b>to</b> <b>hoist</b> him <b>up</b> again, and procuring a lamp at one of the houses, he and Edgar descended together. Entering the passage they found that it widened into a great chamber some forty feet square and thirty high, which was literally crammed with goods.|$|R

60|$|At {{the time}} when the work was {{interrupted}} the builders were engaged chiefly on one of the towers, which they had carried up about one hundred and fifty feet. The stones which were used for this tower were very large, and in order <b>to</b> <b>hoist</b> them <b>up</b> the workmen used a monstrous crane, which was reared on the summit of it. This crane was made of timbers rising obliquely from a revolving platform in the centre, and meeting in a point which projected beyond the wall in such a manner that a chain from the end of it, hanging freely, would descend to the ground. The stones which were to go up were then fastened to this chain, and <b>hoisted</b> <b>up</b> by machinery. When they were raised high enough, that is, just above the edge of the wall, the whole crane was turned round upon its platform, in such a manner as to bring the stone in over the wall; and then it was let down into the place which had been prepared to receive it.|$|R

The mechanism is called Octopus which is an acronym for Object Closure Transplantable to Other Persistent User Spaces.

50|$|The link from Newport to Wappenshalll was crossed by a towpath bridge {{immediately}} before the junction. This {{is still in}} situ, and is a grade II listed structure. Nearby is a three-storey dock warehouse, which straddles {{a section of the}} canal. The first floor includes trap doors, which allowed goods <b>to</b> be <b>hoisted</b> <b>up</b> from the canal boats into the warehouse. It is also listed, and was built by George Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, the Earl of Sutherland, rather than the canal company, as was the basin. The Sutherland Estate also built a fine office for the canal toll clerk. It is a two-storey building, constructed of red bricks, with a central half-octagonal bay containing three sets of windows. A small community developed around the junction, as several cottages and the Sutherland Arms public house were built close by. The building is now called Bridge House, and it was rented to John Tranier when it was first opened.|$|R
5000|$|The yard {{exists to}} allow square sails {{to be set}} to drive the ship. The top edge of the sail is 'bent on' (attached) to the yard semi-permanently.

60|$|Upon getting alongside, {{the chief}} evinced {{symptoms}} of extreme surprise and delight, clapping his hands, slapping his thighs and breast, and laughing obstreperously. His followers behind joined in his merriment, {{and for some}} minutes the din was so excessive as to be absolutely deafening. Quiet being at length restored, Captain Guy ordered the boats <b>to</b> be <b>hoisted</b> <b>up,</b> as a necessary precaution, and gave the chief (whose name we soon found to be Too-wit) {{to understand that we}} could admit no more than twenty of his men on deck at one time. With this arrangement he appeared perfectly satisfied, and gave some directions to the canoes, when one of them approached, the rest remaining about fifty yards off. Twenty of the savages now got on board, and proceeded to ramble over every part of the deck, and scramble about among the rigging, making themselves much at home, and examining every article with great inquisitiveness.|$|R
