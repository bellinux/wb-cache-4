5000|$|The Cassidinae (<b>tortoise</b> and leaf-mining <b>beetles)</b> are a {{subfamily}} of {{the leaf}} beetles, or Chrysomelidae. It includes both the former subfamily [...] "Hispinae" [...] (leaf-mining beetles), {{as well as the}} former more narrowly defined subfamily Cassidinae (familiar as <b>tortoise</b> <b>beetles)</b> which are now split into several tribes that include the tribe Cassidini, and in all include over 125 genera. The traditional separation of the two groups was based essentially on the habitats of the larvae and the general shapes of the adults. The name Cassidinae for the merged subfamily is considered to have priority.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: We {{investigated}} {{the relationship between}} host-plant use by two <b>tortoise</b> <b>beetles,</b> Cassida nebulosa and C. piperata, in a field and their performance under laboratory conditions. Sixteen plant species were grown in the experimen-tal field with C. nebulosa being observed to grow on three chenopodiaceous species (Chenopodium album, C. album var. centrorubrum, and C. ficifolium), while C. piperata grew on the same three chenopodiaceous species plus three amaran-thaceous species (Amaranthus blitum, A. hybridus, and A. retroflexus). Host-plant selection in the field was directly corre-lated to the larval growth under laboratory conditions. Thus, the two <b>tortoise</b> <b>beetles</b> selected plant species that were suit-able as larval food under natural conditions. In the laboratory experiments, the survival period of adults {{and the number of}} eggs produced showed that adults have wider food ranges than larvae. Therefore, food quality is less important as a limit-ing factor for adults compared to larvae. In addition, the field observation showed that C. nebulosa laid eggs only on suit-able host plant species, whereas C. piperata laid eggs on both suitable hosts and non-hosts...|$|R

25|$|As well as {{the usual}} yellow and deep red colourings, many coccinellid species are mostly, or entirely, black, dark grey, gray, or brown, and may be {{difficult}} for non-entomologists to recognise as coccinellids at all. Conversely, non-entomologists might easily mistake many other small beetles for coccinellids. For example, the <b>tortoise</b> <b>beetles,</b> like the ladybird beetles, look similar because they are shaped so that they can cling to a flat surface so closely that ants and many other enemies cannot grip them.|$|R
