5|$|The Pigsty, a small gardeners shed {{located on}} The Orchard, has been {{preserved}} {{as the first}} campsite at Gilwell Park. The first group of Rover Scouts who arrived to prepare the site when it was purchased in 1919 slept here when the weather proved too bad to pitch <b>their</b> <b>tents.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{retreating}} Muslim {{army was}} met by the ferocious Arab women in the camps. Led by Hind, the Muslim women dismantled <b>their</b> <b>tents</b> and armed with tent poles charged at their husbands and fellow men singing an improvised song from the Battle of Uhud that then had been directed against the Muslims.|$|E
5|$|It has {{a unique}} method of {{capturing}} tent-making bats. It looks for roosting bats by looking for <b>their</b> <b>tents</b> (which are made of a folded leaf). When it finds a bat it climbs {{to a higher level}} and jumps onto the tent from above, attempting to dislodge the bat. If the fallen bat does not fly away in time, the monkey pounces on it on the ground and eats it.|$|E

60|$|By {{this time}} they began to be weary, and so in the back-road from Hackney, a little before it opened into the said great road, they {{resolved}} to set up <b>their</b> <b>tent</b> and encamp for the first night, which they did accordingly, with this addition, that finding a barn, or a building like a barn, and first searching {{as well as they}} could to be sure there was nobody in it, they set up <b>their</b> <b>tent,</b> with the head of it against the barn. This they did also because the wind blew that night very high, and they were but young at such a way of lodging, {{as well as at the}} managing <b>their</b> <b>tent.</b>|$|R

5|$|Manning {{became the}} target of {{bullying}} at the school {{because she was the}} only American and was viewed as effeminate. Manning had come out to two friends in Oklahoma as gay, but was not open about it at school in Wales. The students would imitate her accent, and apparently abandoned her once during a camping trip; her aunt told The Washington Post that Manning awoke to an empty camp site one morning, after everyone else had packed up <b>their</b> <b>tents</b> and left without her.|$|E
5|$|Frederick {{realized}} the gambit by 2:30 pm. By 3:00pm, the entire Prussian army had struck camp, loaded <b>their</b> <b>tents</b> and gear, and fallen into line. Friedrich Wilhelm von Seydlitz took his 38 squadrons of cavalry {{and moved toward}} the Janus and Pölzen, small hills between Rossbach and Reichertswerben. Except for a few moments, the advance was hidden entirely from view. He was followed by Colonel Karl Friedrich von Moller's battery of 18 guns, which positioned themselves temporarily on the reverse of the Janus between the infantry's left and the cavalry's right. Seven squadrons remained in Rossbach to contain Saint-Germain's advanced post.|$|E
5|$|By October 9, {{all of the}} French and American {{guns were}} in place. Among the American guns there were three twenty-four pounders, three {{eighteen}} pounders, two eight-inch (203mm) howitzers and six mortars, totaling fourteen guns. At 3:00pm, the French guns opened the barrage and drove the British frigate, HMS Guadeloupe across the York River, where she was scuttled to prevent capture. At 5:00pm the Americans opened fire. Washington fired the first gun; {{legend has it that}} this shot smashed into a table where British officers were eating. The Franco-American guns began to tear apart the British defenses. Washington ordered that the guns fire all night so that the British could not make repairs. All of the British guns on the left were soon silenced. The British soldiers began to pitch <b>their</b> <b>tents</b> in their trenches and soldiers began to desert in large numbers. Some British ships were also damaged by cannonballs that flew across the town into the harbor.|$|E

5|$|People {{have been}} living in deserts for millennia. Many, such as the Bushmen in the Kalahari, the Aborigines in Australia and various tribes of North American Indians, were {{originally}} hunter-gatherers. They developed skills in the manufacture and use of weapons, animal tracking, finding water, foraging for edible plants and using the things they found in their natural environment to supply their everyday needs. Their self-sufficient skills and knowledge were passed down through the generations by word of mouth. Other cultures developed a nomadic way of life as herders of sheep, goats, cattle, camels, yaks, llamas or reindeer. They travelled over large areas with their herds, moving to new pastures as seasonal and erratic rainfall encouraged new plant growth. They took with them <b>their</b> <b>tents</b> made of cloth or skins draped over poles and their diet included milk, blood and sometimes meat.|$|E

25|$|Tent Aid was {{a scheme}} {{operated}} by Scouting Ireland. For campers who had trouble pitching their tent, {{members of the}} scouting agency assisted for a charitable donation. Campers wishing to recycle <b>their</b> <b>tents</b> after the festival could leave them to be collected by Tent Aid where they were sent to Africa to be reused.|$|E

25|$|In 811, Nikephoros I Logothetes's forces {{departed}} from Markeli in their ill-fated invasion of Bulgaria, which saw the emperor being {{killed at the}} hands of the Bulgarians in the Battle of Pliska. Byzantine scholar Anna Komnene writes that in 1089 her father Alexios I Komnenos had conflicts and negotiations with the Pechenegs and Cumans who had pitched <b>their</b> <b>tents</b> at Markeli (Marcella). The fortress was manned and populated until some time in the 12th century.|$|E
25|$|Serious Arctic {{aired in}} 2005. Chosen from 9,000 applicants, eight adventurers flew to Baffin Island, Canada, where {{they made an}} attempt to track polar bears across the pack ice, riding on husky sleds. Blizzards made the trip a hazard, and they spent most of one week in <b>their</b> <b>tents.</b> Serious Arctic was also the most {{successful}} Serious series picking up five awards. The expedition leaders for this trip were Ben Major and Emma Jay.|$|E
25|$|The first {{government}} officials arrived by boat and pitched <b>their</b> <b>tents</b> opposite {{the site of}} the present-day Pacific International hotel. On 7 October 1876, the Governor of Queensland, William Wellington Cairns, proclaimed a new northern port at Trinity Bay. On 1 November 1876, the township was inaugurated at a luncheon given by Captain T. A. Lake on board the Government ship, SS Victoria. This is regarded as the official birth date of Cairns. The first public land sales in February 1877 were supplemented, three months later, by the construction of the first local saw mill making use of the abundant natural timber resources.|$|E

25|$|Participants {{arrive on}} the Friday and pitch <b>their</b> <b>tents.</b> There is {{normally}} a large campfire followed by Fire Performers. After this tickets for Saturday's activities are given out (followed by a mad dash to swap activities). On Saturday morning participants are bused offsite to do two activities (e.g. Waterskiing, Zipit, Escape Spike Island, Canoeing, Rafting, High Ropes and the Ventact Famous Monopoly Run). When they return, there is a barbecue at the campsite. On Saturday evening there is a Scouts/Guides Own followed by the ever-popular themed Ventact Disco. On Sunday morning there are activities around Kilcully Campsite before everyone heads home.|$|E
25|$|During the Arameans' {{siege of}} Samaria, four leprous {{men at the}} gate asked each other why they should die there of starvation, when they might go to the Arameans, who would either save them or leave them no worse than they were. When at twilight, {{they went to the}} Arameans' camp, there was no one there, for God had made the Arameans hear chariots, horses, and a great army, and fearing the Hittites and the Egyptians, they fled, leaving <b>their</b> <b>tents,</b> their horses, their donkeys, and their camp. The lepers went into a tent, ate and drank, and carried away silver, gold, and {{clothing}} from the tents and hid it.|$|E
25|$|On June 2, the Union columns {{set off to}} {{converge}} on Philippi. After an overnight march in rainy weather, both arrived at Philippi before dawn the following morning. Morris had planned a predawn assault to be signaled by a pistol shot. The green Confederate volunteers had failed to establish picket lines for perimeter security, choosing instead to escape the cold rain and stay inside <b>their</b> <b>tents.</b> A Confederate sympathizer, Mrs. Thomas Humphreys, saw the approaching Union troops and sent her young son on horseback to warn the Confederates. As Mrs. Humphreys watched, she saw Union pickets capture her son and fired her pistol at them. She missed, but her shots began the attack prematurely.|$|E
