5|$|Since the RCL {{is still}} covalently {{attached}} to the protease via the ester bond, the S to R transition pulls protease from the <b>top</b> <b>to</b> {{the bottom of the}} serpin and distorts the catalytic triad. The distorted protease can only hydrolyse the acyl enzyme intermediate extremely slowly and so the protease remains covalently attached for days to weeks. Serpins are classed as irreversible inhibitors and as suicide inhibitors since each serpin protein permanently inactivates a single protease, and can only function once.|$|E
5|$|The new castle needed {{constant}} {{investment to}} maintain its quality as a military fortification. Winter floods in 1315–16 damaged the soil {{at the base of}} the motte, requiring immediate repairs. Around 1358–60, the heavy stone keep again suffered from subsidence and the south-eastern lobe cracked from <b>top</b> <b>to</b> bottom. Royal officials recommended that the keep be completely rebuilt, but, instead, the lobe was repaired at a cost of £200.|$|E
5|$|The {{pressure}} on Ward's brigade was eventually too great, {{and he was}} forced to call for a retreat. Hood's division secured Devil's Den and the southern part of Houck's Ridge. The center of the fighting shifted to the northwest, to Rose Woods and the Wheatfield, while five regiments under Evander Law assaulted Little Round <b>Top</b> <b>to</b> the east. Benning's men spent the next 22 hours on Devil's Den, firing across the Valley of Death on Union troops massed on Little Round Top.|$|E

5|$|A gritter, {{also known}} as a sander, salt {{spreader}} or salt truck, is found on most winter service vehicles. Indeed, the gritter is so commonly seen on winter service vehicles that the terms are sometimes used synonymously. Gritters are used to spread grit (rock salt), onto roads. The grit is stored in the large hopper on the rear of the vehicle, with a wire mesh over the <b>top</b> <b>to</b> prevent foreign objects from entering the spreading mechanism and hence becoming jammed. The salt is generally spread across the roadway by an impeller, attached by a hydraulic drive system to a small onboard engine. However, until the 1970s, the grit was often spread manually using shovels by men riding {{on the back of the}} truck, and some older spreading mechanisms still require grit be manually loaded into the impeller from the hopper.|$|E

5|$|All {{elements}} {{in this group}} are metals. The similarity of the metallic radii of cadmium and mercury is an effect of the lanthanide contraction. So, the trend in this group is unlike the trend in group 2, the alkaline earths, where metallic radius increases smoothly from <b>top</b> <b>to</b> bottom of the group. All three metals have relatively low melting and boiling points, indicating that the metallic bond is relatively weak, with relatively little overlap between the valence band and the conduction band. Thus, zinc {{is close to the}} boundary between metallic and metalloid elements, which is usually placed between gallium and germanium, though gallium participates in semi-conductors such as gallium arsenide.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal faced Manchester United at Old Trafford on 7 December 2002; {{the home}} team had beaten title challengers Liverpool the {{previous}} weekend. Manchester United opened the scoring in the 21st minute – a poor clearance by Cygan allowed Juan Sebastián Verón to score. Arsenal goalkeeper Rami Shaaban was substituted {{before the start of}} the second half, having pulled a thigh muscle. He was replaced by Stuart Taylor, who was helpless to prevent Paul Scholes from scoring a second goal, 15 minutes before the final whistle. A 1–1 draw at Tottenham Hotspur was followed by a win against Middlesbrough; a goal apiece from Campbell and Pirès meant Arsenal were top of the table on Christmas. On Boxing Day, Arsenal came from a goal down to beat West Brom 2–1; in doing so, they extended their lead at the <b>top</b> <b>to</b> four points. Three days later, Arsenal's lead was increased to five points, having drawn with Liverpool.|$|E
5|$|Artillery {{powered by}} {{gunpowder}} {{was introduced to}} Europe in the 1320s and spread quickly. Handguns, which were initially unpredictable and inaccurate weapons, were not recorded until the 1380s. Castles were adapted to allow small artillery pieces– averaging between – to fire from towers. These guns were too heavy {{for a man to}} carry and fire, but if he supported the butt end and rested the muzzle {{on the edge of the}} gun port he could fire the weapon. The gun ports developed in this period show a unique feature, that of a horizontal timber across the opening. A hook on the end of the gun could be latched over the timber so the gunner did not have to take the full recoil of the weapon. This adaptation is found across Europe, and although the timber rarely survives, there is an intact example at Castle Doornenburg in the Netherlands. Gunports were keyhole shaped, with a circular hole at the bottom for the weapon and a narrow slit on <b>top</b> <b>to</b> allow the gunner to aim.|$|E

5|$|As the Canadians began {{preparations}} for an assault, the Germans {{were in the}} process of executing an assault plan of their own. The XIII (Royal Württemberg) Corps spent six weeks planning and carefully preparing their attack on the Mount Sorrel, Tor Top (Hill 62) and Hill 61 peaks. Their objective was to take control of the observation positions east of Ypres and keep as many British units as possible pinned down in the area, to avoid them transferring to the Somme front and assisting with the observed build-up in that area. The Germans constructed practice trenches resembling the Canadian positions near Tor <b>Top</b> <b>to</b> rehearse the assault, well behind their own lines.|$|E
5|$|Because all {{languages}} have a {{very large}} number of words, no purely logographic scripts are known to exist. Written language represents the way spoken sounds and words follow one after another by arranging symbols according to a pattern that follows a certain direction. The direction used in a writing system is entirely arbitrary and established by convention. Some writing systems use the horizontal axis (left to right as the Latin script or right to left as the Arabic script), while others such as traditional Chinese writing use the vertical dimension (from <b>top</b> <b>to</b> bottom). A few writing systems use opposite directions for alternating lines, and others, such as the ancient Maya script, can be written in either direction and rely on graphic cues to show the reader the direction of reading.|$|E
5|$|Chinese {{characters}} {{conform to}} a roughly square frame {{and are not}} usually linked to one another, so {{do not have a}} preferred direction of writing. Traditionally Chinese text was written in vertical columns which were read from <b>top</b> <b>to</b> bottom, right-to-left; the first column being {{on the right side of}} the page, and the last column on the left. Text written in Classical Chinese also uses little or no punctuation, with sentence and phrase breaks are determined by context and rhythm. Vertical Chinese is still used for effect or where space requires it, such as signs or on spines of books.|$|E

5|$|Disraeli {{justified}} {{his ideas}} by {{his belief in}} an organic society in which the different classes have natural obligations to one another. He saw society as naturally hierarchical and emphasised the obligation of those at the <b>top</b> <b>to</b> those below. This was based in the feudal concept of noblesse oblige, which asserted that the aristocracy {{had an obligation to}} be generous and honourable; to Disraeli, this implied that government should be paternalistic. Unlike the New Right, one-nation conservatism takes a pragmatic and non-ideological approach to politics and accepts the need for flexible policies; one-nation conservatives have often sought compromise with their ideological opponents for the sake of social stability. Disraeli justified his views pragmatically by arguing that, should the ruling class become indifferent to the suffering of the people, society would become unstable and social revolution would become a possibility.|$|E
5|$|Elements in {{the same}} group tend to show {{patterns}} in atomic radius, ionization energy, and electronegativity. From <b>top</b> <b>to</b> bottom in a group, the atomic radii of the elements increase. Since there are more filled energy levels, valence electrons are found farther from the nucleus. From the top, each successive element has a lower ionization energy because {{it is easier to}} remove an electron since the atoms are less tightly bound. Similarly, a group has a top-to-bottom decrease in electronegativity due to an increasing distance between valence electrons and the nucleus. There are exceptions to these trends, however: for example, in group 11, electronegativity increases farther down the group.|$|E
5|$|Heavy {{moldboard}} iron plow: Although use of {{the simple}} wooden ard in China must have preceded it, the earliest discovered Chinese iron plows date to roughly 500 BC, during the Zhou Dynasty (1122–256 BC) and were flat, V-shaped, and mounted on wooden poles and handles. By the 3rd century BC, improved iron casting techniques {{led to the development}} of the heavy moldboard plow, seen in Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) artwork such as tomb carved bricks. The moldboard allowed the Chinese to turn farm soil without clogging the plowshare with dirt, which was flung off the wheelbarrow via slanted wings on both sides. While the frame of excavated plowshares dating to the Warring States period (403–221 BC) were made mostly of perishable wood except for the iron blade, the frame of excavated plowshares dating to the Han Dynasty were made entirely of solid iron with the moldboard attached to the <b>top</b> <b>to</b> turn the soil.|$|E
