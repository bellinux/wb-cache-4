5|$|In 1929, the routing was {{amended to}} run from Route 25 (now U.S. Route 1/9 Truck) in Jersey City <b>to</b> <b>Route</b> 3 in Wallington. Route 7 was {{extended}} north in 1949 to continue <b>to</b> <b>Route</b> 6 (now U.S. Route 46) in East Paterson (now Elmwood Park).|$|E
5|$|Route 7 was {{established}} in 1927 to run from Jersey City to Paterson, replacing Pre-1927 Route 11 between Belleville and Paterson. The routing was amended in 1929 to head <b>to</b> <b>Route</b> 3 in Wallington and was extended north <b>to</b> <b>Route</b> 6 (now U.S. Route 46) in East Paterson in 1949. In 1953, the route was modified to follow its current alignment.|$|E
5|$|Route S3 {{was defined}} in 1929 {{to run from}} Route 3 in East Rutherford west <b>to</b> <b>Route</b> 6 (US46) in Clifton, (this {{is now part of}} Route 3). In 1942, the state took over the {{alignment}} and made it an unnumbered state highway was defined to run from the intersection of Clifton Avenue and Van Houten Avenue southwest <b>to</b> <b>Route</b> S3, which then ran along Allwood Road. World War II delayed completion of Route S3 long enough for an alternate freeway route to be selected, and the part of Allwood Road that was taken over is no longer a state highway. In 1948, the route was assigned the number Route S3 Spur. The number was changed <b>to</b> <b>Route</b> 161 in the 1953 state highway renumbering, and ever since then it has remained an isolated state highway.|$|E

5|$|The {{road that}} became Route 75 has existed since 1926, {{as part of}} Route 55 from south of Charleston to east of East Prairie. The route was renumbered <b>to</b> <b>Route</b> 77 in 1959, and it was rerouted in 1968. The {{realignment}} replaced Route E with Route 77, and its old alignment became part of Route 88 and Route 105.

5|$|Between 1918 and 1926, Route 46 was {{extended}} to Sheridan. Soon after, in 1933, it extended south, two miles east of Sheridan. The extension caused the road to Sheridan to become a spur route of Route 46. The spur route was then extended west into Nodaway County around 1948–1949, and was numbered supplemental route D. Four years later, the route {{was extended}} <b>to</b> <b>Route</b> 27 (now Route 148). In 1954, Route 246 was designated, starting from Sheridan, and ending at Route 46. The next year, Route 246 {{was extended to}} replace supplemental route D as the main connector from Hopkins <b>to</b> <b>Route</b> 46. The whole route was surfaced in concrete by 1959.|$|E
5|$|Planning {{for what}} would become SR 125 north of I-8 began in 1954. Route 282 {{was defined as a}} route from Brown Field through La Mesa {{extending}} <b>to</b> <b>Route</b> 277 in 1959, and in 1961 the latter terminus was changed <b>to</b> <b>Route</b> 278. The California Highway Commission selected a route for the highway in mid-1963. In the 1964 state highway renumbering, SR 125 was designated as the highway from SR 75 near Brown Field to SR 56. Route198 was renumbered as State Route67; the portion south of I-8 was renumbered as SR 125.|$|E

5|$|Route 108 was {{designated}} in 1930, connecting {{from the state}} line <b>to</b> <b>Route</b> 25. The road was already paved in gravel. Three years later, Route Y {{was designated}}, and it connected from Route 108 in Arbyth to Caruth. In 1936, Route 108 was repaved in concrete. By 1953, Route 25 was rerouted into Arbyrd, becoming the terminus of Routes 108 and Y there. Route 164 was designated in 1956, replacing a large section of Route Y from Route 108 <b>to</b> <b>Route</b> N. Fifteen years later, Route 25 was rerouted to the west, and the old alignment, from Route 246, through Arbyrd, became part of Route 108. Around 1983, US 412 was designated, replacing Route 25 from Kennett to the state line.|$|E

5|$|The {{road that}} became Route 126 was built and designated, as {{supplemental}} Route D around 1935. It connected from US 71 to US 160 in Golden City. By 1940, supplemental Route H was designated, connected from Route 43, {{to a dead}} end east of it. A year later, Route H was extended west to the Kansas state line. In 1942, Route 126 was designated, replacing Route H from the state line <b>to</b> <b>Route</b> 43. Around 1945-1949, Route H was extended east <b>to</b> <b>Route</b> Z, and the same route was extended east for a few miles east of Route Z in 1954. Around 1955, Route H and D were removed in the supplemental route system, {{and was replaced by}} Route 126, as the two sections became connected. Later, Route 126 was repaved in concrete, from the state line <b>to</b> <b>Route</b> 43. The whole route was repaved by 1957. In 1979, US 71 was moved to a freeway alignment, but an interchange wasn't built until 2010-2013. I-49 became co-signed with US 71 in December 2012.|$|E
5|$|A {{road from}} Lewistown to Canton has existed since 1918, {{and it became}} part of Route 6 by 1926. A section of a road from Monticello to Lewiston was paved in gravel two years later. In 1931, Route 6 was re-aligned south of Canton, and the former {{alignment}} was designated as Route 96. The next year, Route 96 was fully paved in gravel. The route was renumbered <b>to</b> <b>Route</b> 16 in 1941, and was fully paved in concrete by 1942. In 1977, US 61 was realigned west of Canton, and the old route became Route B. Around 1989–90, US 61 Business was designated, concurrent with Route B through Canton. An interchange was built at US 61 and Route 16 around 2001–02.|$|E

Although Route 571 and Route 526 are proposed to be realigned onto the new alignment, there is no designated change proposed for Route 64.

5|$|Heeding Bryant's advice, Palmer decided <b>to</b> <b>route</b> the {{railroad}} {{south of the}} canyon and in March 1883, it completed its connection to Salt Lake City and {{for a brief period}} the canyon was on the main line of a transcontinental railroad system.

5|$|I-70 {{exits the}} valley through De Beque Canyon, a path carved by the Colorado River that {{separates}} the Book Cliffs from Battlement Mesa.

This tunnel design features a curved sidewall, unusual for tunnels in the United States, where most tunnels feature a curved roof and flat side-walls. Engineers borrowed a European design to give the tunnel added strength. After the canyon winds past the Book Cliffs, the highway follows the Colorado River through a valley containing the communities of Parachute and Rifle.|$|E

5|$|In 1992, RIDOT {{reviewed}} {{plans for}} an eastern extension of Route 37.

The first option was ultimately dropped by RIDOT after studies indicated the routing would interfere with aviation traffic at T. F. Green Airport. The freeway extension <b>to</b> <b>Route</b> 117, however, remains on RIDOT's long-term plans.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, it was {{announced}} that the mainline Expressway from milepost 7.031.0 would be widened in the westbound direction to accommodate a third lane from just north of the Garden State Parkway <b>to</b> <b>Route</b> 73. Interchange 17 (Route 50) would be reconstructed to form a full movement interchange (completed June 18, 2010), and the Egg Harbor Toll Plaza would receive Express E-ZPass lanes to maintain highway speed.
