5|$|Band Hero has {{received}} mixed to positive reviews from gaming critics. Most recognized {{the game as}} having the same feature sets as Guitar Hero 5, including any benefits or flaws <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>come</b> from that. Reviewers praised the reuse of the Guitar Hero 5 features such as the Party Play mode that allows for players to jump in and out, the improved Career mode, and the improved GHTunes. Some identified that the target market of the game appears to be towards teenage girls, such as the featuring of Taylor Swift, the color schemes used in the game, {{and other parts of}} the song selection. Reviewers noted that setlist would be the strongest measure of whether players should purchase the game. The reviewers also commented on the smaller setlist, which contains only 65 songs compared to Guitar Hero 5s 85.|$|E
25|$|A later study {{questioned}} {{the attitudes of}} adolescents. When asked about abstinence, many girls reported they felt conflicted. They were trying to balance maintaining a good reputation with trying to maintain a romantic relationship and wanting to behave in adult-like ways. Boys viewed having sex as social capital. Many boys believed that their male peers who were abstinent would not as easily climb the social ladder as sexually active boys. Some boys said that for them, the risks <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>come</b> from having sex were {{not as bad as}} the social risks that could come from remaining abstinent.|$|E
25|$|Expectancy {{theory has}} been shown to have useful {{applications}} in designing a reward system. If policies are consistently, clearly and fairly implemented, then the instrumentality would be high. If the rewards are substantial enough to be meaningful to an employee, then the valence would be also considered high. A precursor to motivation is that the employee finds the reward(s) attractive. In some instances, the reward or outcome might inadvertently be unattractive, such as increased workload or demanding travel <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>come</b> with a promotion. In such an instance, the valence might be lower for individuals who feel work–life balance is important, for example.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to repelling or killing insects such as moths and silverfish, mothballs {{can be used}} as a repellent to keep bats from establishing themselves in attics. Mothballs may repel snakes or mice. Mothballs have the potential to be a hazard to pets, livestock or children <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>come</b> into contact with them. Recent issues with imported and unregulated mothballs from China have also become a huge concern as there is no way to know what chemicals were used during the process. However, mothball labels instruct proper use in a sealed container. Older-formula mothballs have also been used by drag racers to enhance the octane rating of fuel, by dissolving the mothballs in some of the fuel and filtering out the remains with a filter paper.|$|E
25|$|Standing {{near the}} castle, the Church of the Holy Rude {{is one of}} the town's most {{historically}} important buildings. Founded in 1129 it is the second oldest building in the city after Stirling castle. It was rebuilt in the 15th century after Stirling suffered a catastrophic fire in 1405, and is reputed to be the only surviving church in the United Kingdom apart from Westminster Abbey to have held a coronation. On 29 July 1567 the infant son of Mary, Queen of Scots, was anointed James VI of Scotland in the church. James' bride, Anne of Denmark was crowned in the church at Holyrood Palace in Edinburgh. The Holy Rude congregation still meet and some 19th century parish records survive. Musket shot marks <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>come</b> from Cromwell's troops during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms are clearly visible on the tower and apse of the church.|$|E
25|$|Soon after inoculation, yeast {{begin to}} rapidly consume the {{available}} assimilable nitrogen {{with up to}} 46% of YAN being fully consumed by the onset of full fermentation. Because inorganic nitrogen, such as the ammonium salts in DAP, are toxic to yeast in high levels, it is never added during inoculation when the biomass of the newly re-hydrated yeast is low. Many winemakers split up the dosage of DAP with the first addition being made {{at the end of}} the lag phase when the yeast enter their period of exponential growth and alcoholic fermentation begins. In most must this is around 48 to 72 hours after inoculation. A second dosage is then often added around a third of the way through sugar fermentation and often before the sugar levels hit 12-10 Brix (6.5 to 5.5 Baumé, 48.3 to 40.0 Oechsle) because as the fermentation progresses yeast cells are no longer able to bring the nitrogen into the cell due to the increasing toxicity of ethanol surrounding the cells. This leaves the nitrogen unused and available for spoilage organisms <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>come</b> afterwards.|$|E

25|$|The {{essential}} {{action in}} baseball is either (for the offence) to advance runners {{around the bases}} or (for the defence) to halt that advance. As simple as this is in principle, in practice it generates a remarkably large range of strategies. Any given situation—the number of runners on base, the bases they occupy, their skills as runners or base-stealers, the count on the hitter, the number of outs, the specialties of the pitcher and the batter, the catcher's skill at throwing out runners, the positioning of fielders, which inning is being played, and so on—allows for a considerable variety of possible plays, {{on either side of}} the ball. At any moment, one manager may be calculating how to advance his runners (whether to call for the steal, the hit-and-run, sacrifice bunt, sacrifice fly, a double steal, the squeeze, and so on) while the opposing manager is calculating how best to thwart his opponent (not only through the pitching approach and positioning of fielders, but by, say, calling for a pitch-out when a steal is anticipated, and so on). Since the variables that determine which strategies are possible or advisable change from pitch to pitch, and according to all the varieties of play situation <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>come</b> about in any game, the game played between the two managers is the most intricate aspect of the game, and for many followers of the sport is considered the true 'inner game'.|$|E
25|$|Science is a {{magnificent}} force, {{but it is}} not a teacher of morals. It can perfect machinery, but it adds no moral restraints to protect society from the misuse of the machine. It can also build gigantic intellectual ships, but it constructs no moral rudders for the control of storm-tossed human vessel. It not only fails to supply the spiritual element needed but some of its unproven hypotheses rob the ship of its compass and thus endanger its cargo. In war, science has proven itself an evil genius; it has made war more terrible than it ever was before. Man used to be content to slaughter his fellowmen on a single plane, the earth's surface. Science has taught him to go down into the water and shoot up from below and to go up into the clouds and shoot down from above, thus making the battlefield three times as bloody as it was before; but science does not teach brotherly love. Science has made war so hellish that civilization was about to commit suicide; and now we are told that newly discovered instruments of destruction will make the cruelties of the late war seem trivial in comparison with the cruelties of wars <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>come</b> in the future. If civilization is to be saved from the wreckage threatened by intelligence not consecrated by love, it must be saved by the moral code of the meek and lowly Nazarene. His teachings, and His teachings alone, can solve the problems that vex the heart and perplex the world.|$|E
500|$|The End of the Road is in a {{realistic}} style <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>come</b> {{as a surprise}} to those familiar only with Barth's later books. [...] The narrator avoids naturalistic descriptions of his surroundings, and most other details, and describes the physical aspects of life (especially of women) with disgust or contempt. [...] He indulges in occasional bursts of eloquence: [...] "A turning down of dinner damped, in ways subtle past knowing, manic keys on the flute of me, least pressed of all, which for a moment had shrilled me rarely".

500|$|If one is {{interested}} in making something {{for the public to}} view—be it a painting, a book, an album, a film, or a video game, should the POSSIBLE harm <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>come</b> out of this work be grounds for its suppression from society? This is, in a sense, pre-crime. If you believe in what you're doing and you want to express yourself, the expression should be primary and any interpretations that come after must always remain of secondary importance {{to the creation of the}} work itself. On another level, the entire correlation between the Dawson College shooting and my game is unfounded. [...] What else did Kimveer like? Black clothes? Goth music? Pizza?

500|$|With {{its budget}} of over , The Hollywood Reporter called Edge of Tomorrow, {{one of the}} [...] "biggest box-office risks" [...] in North America for mid-2014. [...] The trade paper said the film was similar to Oblivion, a 2013 science fiction film that also starred Tom Cruise, and that like Oblivion, it would likely perform better outside North America. Box Office Mojo {{reported}} that four of Cruise's films with original material—Valkyrie (2008), Knight and Day (2010), Jack Reacher (2012), and Oblivion (2013)—failed to gross more than [...] in North America. The website forecast that Edge of Tomorrow would gross [...] in North America and [...] in other territories. TheWrap said that the studio focused on theatrical releases in other territories where Cruise [...] "remains a major force" [...] in drawing audiences. Variety, writing from the US perspective, said, [...] "Media reports {{have been quick to}} speculate that Edge of Tomorrow {{may be one of the}} summer's first big bombs based on the lack of enthusiasm by U.S. audiences. <b>That</b> <b>may</b> <b>come</b> to pass, but these reports downplay the centrality of foreign markets in today's globalized movie industry." ...|$|E
500|$|Genesis of the Daleks also {{displays}} {{a battle between}} good and evil. Letts enjoyed {{the fact that the}} story did not have clear heroes and villains, but rather a conflict of principle. The discussion between the Doctor and Davros about the hypothetical viral weapon demonstrates this. Hinchcliffe described it as the [...] "hero meets antihero" [...] moment, with the two engaged in [...] "intellectual grappling". The episode also presents the [...] "moral dilemma" [...] of whether the Doctor should destroy the Daleks, resulting in the famous [...] "Have I the right?" [...] scene. The Doctor's comparison to knowingly killing a child who would {{grow up to be a}} dictator shows how the Doctor's ethics are influenced by his non-linear experience of time. (The Twelfth Doctor would again revisit this theme in the 2015 episodes [...] "The Magician's Apprentice" [...] and [...] "The Witch's Familiar".) He considers the good things <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>come</b> out of the Daleks, such as that [...] "many future worlds would become allies".

500|$|Condoms offer {{moderate}} {{protection against}} HSV-2 in {{both men and}} women, with consistent condom users having a 30%-lower risk of HSV-2 acquisition compared with those who never use condoms. A female condom can provide greater protection than the male condom, as it covers the labia. The virus cannot pass through a synthetic condom, but a male condom's effectiveness is limited [...] because herpes ulcers may appear on areas not covered by it. Neither type of condom prevents contact with the scrotum, anus, buttocks, or upper thighs, areas <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>come</b> in contact with ulcers or genital secretions during sexual activity. Protection against herpes simplex depends {{on the site of}} the ulcer; therefore, if ulcers appear on areas not covered by condoms, abstaining from sexual activity until the ulcers are fully healed is one way to limit risk of transmission. The risk is not eliminated, however, as viral shedding capable of transmitting infection may still occur while the infected partner is asymptomatic. The use of condoms or dental dams also limits the transmission of herpes from the genitals of one partner to the mouth of the other (or vice versa) during oral sex. When one partner has a herpes simplex infection and the other does not, the use of antiviral medication, such as valaciclovir, in conjunction with a condom, further decreases the chances of transmission to the uninfected partner. Topical microbicides that contain chemicals that directly inactivate the virus and block viral entry are being investigated.|$|E
500|$|In [...] "Legends of the Dark Knight", {{an episode}} of The New Batman Adventures, three {{teenagers}} discuss their ideas about what Batman is really like. They briefly meet a youth called Joel whose idea of Batman reflects characterizations and costumes portrayed within Schumacher's Batman and Robin. The teens treat Joel's ideas with utter disdain. In Watchmen, director Zack Snyder and comic book artist Dave Gibbons chose to parody the molded muscle and nipple Batsuit design from Batman & Robin for the Ozymandias costume. The film is referenced in the [...] episode [...] "Legends of the Dark Mite!", when Bat-Mite briefly uses his powers to transform Batman's costume into the same suit shown in the Schumacher Batman films, before declaring it [...] "Too icky". The Batman from Batman & Robin later appeared {{as part of an}} army of Batmen gathered from across the Multiverse in [...] "Night of the Batmen!", complete with the blue rubber Batsuit. Additionally, there were worries within Warner Bros. surrounding the negative critical reaction to Batman & Robin and how <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>come</b> to harm the success of the subsequent direct-to-video animated film , which was originally planned for release at around the same time as Batman & Robin but was subsequently delayed. However, SubZero received a far stronger positive response from critics than Batman & Robin, with Mr. Freeze's role within it being seen in a much more positive light, returning his popularity as a Batman villain to a level comparable to that reached by him within the two Emmy-winning episodes the character featured in of [...]|$|E
