5|$|Goldschmidt's {{appointment}} was initially {{expected to meet}} with little opposition. Several state senators, however, voiced concerns about Goldschmidt's involvement with SAIF and possible improprieties in the dealings {{he and his wife}} had with Texas Pacific.

Cowdery and the Whitmer family believed <b>the</b> <b>revelations</b> Page had received were true. In response, Joseph Smith, the first president of the church, received a <b>revelation</b> during <b>the</b> conference in September of that year to have Cowdery go to Page and convince him that his <b>revelations</b> were of <b>the</b> devil (Doctrine and Covenants, [...] ). At the conference there was considerable discussion on the topic.

5|$|Later volumes {{were also}} praised; Otaku USAs Joseph Luster {{appreciated}} the series' battles and Allen's development. <b>The</b> <b>revelation</b> that Allen {{would be an}} enemy of the Order and the 14th Noah was well received by Grant Goodman of Pop Culture Shock and Chris Beveridge of the Fandom Post. However, Goodman criticized early-volume reliance on comedy rather than plot. Beveridge and Erkael of Manga News were impressed with Kanda's dark past. Douresseaux liked Allen's situation in volume 21 (due to the character's connections with the Noah), and wanted to see more of that and less of Kanda's fight with Alma Karma.|$|E
