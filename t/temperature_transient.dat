40|$|The {{effects of}} fan inlet <b>temperature</b> <b>transients</b> on the {{performance}} and stability of a turbofan engine were determined. The experiment was conducted at 90 and 74 percent of low-pressure-rotor military speed (9525 rpm) and with fan inlet temperature distortions having circumferential extents of 90 deg, 180 deg, 270 deg, and 360 deg. <b>Temperature</b> <b>transients</b> were controlled by varying the magnitude and rate of change of the inlet temperature rise. The engine response ranged from a momentary compressor pressure disturbance to low-pressure-compressor stall. The compressor distortion limits decreased with decreasing low-pressure-rotor speed and increased with increasing circumferential extent of distortion.

40|$|The {{responses}} of isoprene emission rate to temperature {{are characterized by}} complex time-dependent behaviors that are currently not entirely understood. To gain insight into the temperature dependencies of isoprene emission, we studied steady-state and transient {{responses of}} isoprene emission from hybrid aspen (Populus tremula × Populus tremuloides) leaves using a fast-response gas-exchange system coupled to a proton-transfer reaction mass spectrometer. A method based on postillumination isoprene release after rapid <b>temperature</b> <b>transients</b> was developed to determine the rate constant of isoprene synthase (IspS), the pool size of its substrate dimethylallyldiphosphate (DMADP), and to separate the component processes of the temperature dependence of isoprene emission. <b>Temperature</b> <b>transients</b> indicated that over the temperature range 25 °C to 45 °C, IspS was thermally stable and operated in the linear range of its substrate DMADP concentration. The in vivo rate constant of IspS obeyed the Arrhenius law, with an activation energy of 42. 8 kJ mol− 1. In contrast, steady-state isoprene emission had a significantly lower temperature optimum than IspS and higher activation energy. The reversible temperature-dependent decrease {{in the rate of}} isoprene emission between 35 °C and 44 °C was caused by decreases in DMADP concentration, possibly reflecting reduced pools of energetic metabolites generated in photosynthesis, particularly of ATP. Strong control of isoprene temperature responses by the DMADP pool implies that <b>transient</b> <b>temperature</b> responses under fluctuating conditions in the field are driven by initial DMADP pool size as well as temperature-dependent modifications in DMADP pool size during <b>temperature</b> <b>transients.</b> These results have important implications for the development of process-based models of isoprene emission...|$|R

40|$|Modification of the TITAN {{computer}} code which enables {{it to be}} applied to a PWR steam line break accident has been accomplished. The code now has the capability of simulating an asymmetric inlet coolant <b>temperature</b> <b>transient</b> by employing different <b>temperature</b> <b>transient</b> forcing functions for different core inlet regions. Up to ten regions of the core can be considered and each region can have at most 50 channels. A total inlet coolant mass flow rate boundary condition option has been added to the code. Flow/coolant <b>temperature</b> <b>transient</b> and control rod transient can be simulated simultaneously by the code as necessary for a steam line break accident simulation. Also, the transient restart capability has been fixed which allows users to change core conditions during a transient calculation for various purposes. All these modifications have been tested by a ten-channel test calculation. Three steam line break accident simulations (YA- 1, YA- 2, and YA- 3) with different pressure forcing functions have been performed. Each simulation included both closed and open-channel calculations. The steady-state results show that a 1 -D thermalhydraulic analysis gives accurate results. Case YA- 1 employed a pressure forcing function taken from a Yankee Atomic report. No boiling during the whole calculation was observed. Also, no significant difference between closed and open-channel calculations was found. Case YA- 2 employed a reduced pressure forcing function with constant pressure after 45 seconds (because of the limitation of W- 3 correlation data base). Boiling was observed around 42 seconds after the beginning of the transient. The MCHFR dropped to a value below 6 after boiling. The MCHFR went back to a high value (" 30) at 50 seconds for the open-channel calculation while the MCHFR for the closed-channel case still remained below 6. The open-channel model provided a better condition of flow mixing among channels. Case YW- 3 had the same pressure forcing function as that of case YA- 2 except the pressure kept decreasing after 45 seconds. The MCHFR was about equal for open-and closed-channels. It is concluded that the closed-channel calculations may produce conservative core power values, but the effect on MCHFR is not always conservative...|$|E

40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} {{finite element}} model of the LOFT LTSF thermocouple assembly was developed to study the thermal response of the thermocouples to the expected <b>temperature</b> <b>transient</b> in the L 3 - 4, 5 and 6 experiments. Subjecting the thermocouple model to a 10 F fluid temperature step change resulted in a. 10 second delay before 95 % of the step change was observed in the thermocouple temperature response. A thermal analysis {{was performed on the}} Loft Test Support Facility (LTSF) small-break thermocouple assembly to evaluate the thermal response of the thermocouples during the upcoming L 3 - 4, 5 and 6 small-break experiments. The thermocouple assembly (see Figure 1) consists of 3 Type K thermocouples placed radially through an 8 inch diameter section on the pressurizer relief line in the LTSF. In support of the upcoming L 3 - 4, 5 and 6 experiments the LTSF will be used to define thermal conditions expected during these tests. The temperature transients these thermocouples are required to follow are very rapid step changes. Therefore, it is necessary that these thermocouples have a short response time in order to follow the <b>temperature</b> <b>transient</b> in this line. A two-dimensional {{finite element model}} of the thermocouple assembly was constructed using COUPLE, a finite element heat conduction code.

40|$|Borehole {{temperature}} profiles {{provide a}} record of ground surface temperature (GST) change at the decadal to centennial time scale. GST histories reconstructed from boreholes are particularly useful in climate reconstruction if changes in GST and surface air temperature (SAT) are effectively coupled at decadal and longer time periods {{and it can be}} shown that borehole temperatures respond faithfully to surface temperature changes. We test these assumptions using three boreholes in northwestern Utah that have been repeatedly logged for temperature over a time span of 29 years. We report 13 temperaturedepth logs at the Emigrant Pass Observatory borehole GC‐ 1, eight at borehole SI‐ 1 and five at borehole DM‐ 1, acquired between 1978 and 2007. Systematic subsurface temperature changes of up to 0. 6 °C are observed over this time span in the upper sections of the boreholes; below approximately 100 m any <b>temperature</b> <b>transients</b> are within observational noise. We difference the temperature logs to highlight subsurface transients and to remove any ambiguity resulting from steady state source of curvature. Synthetic temperature profiles computed from SAT data at nearby meteorological stations reproduce both the amplitude and pattern of the <b>transient</b> <b>temperature</b> observations, fitting the observations to within 0. 03 °C or better.

Major cracks were observed to run along the circumferential direction across the cylindrical liner and were caused by excessive tensile stresses resulting from temperature gradients or <b>temperature</b> <b>transients</b> induced by different operating conditions.
