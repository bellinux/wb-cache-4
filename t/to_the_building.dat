5|$|According to a 1965 source, {{the site}} of Parson's lodgings corresponded <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> with the modern address 20 Cock Lane. The house was {{believed}} to have been built in the late 17th century, and was demolished in 1979.|$|E

5|$|Almost any {{substance}} containing sugar can naturally undergo alcoholic fermentation. It {{is likely}} that many cultures, on observing that a sweet liquid could be obtained from a source of starch, independently invented beer. Bread and beer increased prosperity to a level that allowed time for development of other technologies and contributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> of civilisations.|$|E
5|$|Bani Na'im grew {{considerably}} in population {{during the early}} 20th century. In 1936, the town participated in the Arab revolt against the British authorities. In December 1937, British forces ordered the demolition of a house whose owners were accused of involvement in an anti-British incident near the town. They fined Bani Na'im's mukhtars (town chiefs) 50 British pounds and ordered the residents to carry 200 kilograms of explosives <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> for its demolition and watch the explosion as a deterrent measure.|$|E
5|$|Brisco was {{eccentric}} and wealthy, {{and added}} a ballroom <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> in 1891, replacing a timber chapel. He also began construction of the house's distinctive tower the same year but died before it was complete and building work was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|The main façade is {{topped by}} a simple wooden raking cornice that surmounts an {{ornamental}} corbel brick pendant. A semicircular fanlight, or lunette, {{is located in the}} center of the gable of <b>the</b> <b>building's</b> main façade, providing lighting <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>building's</b> attic. Chambers described this window as the most antiquated of <b>the</b> <b>building's</b> architectural elements and may have been based on the fanlight of the county's earlier courthouse built in 1833, which was located <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>building's</b> east.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>building</b> was {{designed}} with Gothic detailing by Charles A. Smith in 1926. After his firm failed in 1928, the architects William and Arthur Fisher were commissioned <b>to</b> continue <b>the</b> construction. World War II caused further delays <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>building's</b> construction. In 1948, the architect John Monroe was hired <b>to</b> complete <b>the</b> <b>building.</b>|$|R

5|$|During {{the design}} and {{construction}} period, the project name for phase 2 was C Bay. Construction of phase 2 began in April 2007, and ended when the keys <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> were handed over at an official ceremony in September 2008, {{and the beginning of}} the fitting out of the BBC Hoddinott Hall by BBC Wales.|$|E

5|$|From {{the late}} 1970s through the mid-1990s the {{laboratory}} was rededicated to medical and urban entomology, with Professor John Edman running projects on mosquitos as vectors and Professor Ron Prokopy focusing on orchard pest control. In 1982, the wintering cellar {{in the basement}} of the lab was converted into laboratories, and the workshop was relocated to the garage adjacent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> that was constructed that same year.|$|E

5|$|George Hunt leased {{the castle}} in 1841 {{and it was}} turned into a private house under the {{supervision}} of the architect George Guillame. Hunt remained at Netley until 1857, by when the castle had an oriel window overlooking the sea, and the battlements had been blocked in to allow the construction of a second storey <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>building.</b> George Sherriff leased the castle between 1868 and 1873, building a stone wall around the front of property.|$|E
5|$|Gordon was {{inspired}} to write the episode after walking down the streets of New York and seeing several stone gargoyles on the corner, staring at him. Gordon developed the concept with series creator Chris Carter, who suggested the addition of more psychological aspects to the episode. Originally, the teaser was planned to be filmed at a Catholic hospital, but the shot was relocated {{to the site of}} a historic post office after concerns were raised about attaching a fake gargoyle <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>building.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1927, William Payne Whitney's $27 million {{donation}} led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> of the Payne Whitney Psychiatric Clinic, {{which became}} the name for Weill Cornell's large psychiatric effort. That same year, the college became affiliated with New York Hospital and the two institutions moved to their current joint campus in 1932. The hospital's Training School for Nurses became affiliated with the university in 1942, operating as the Cornell Nursing School until it closed in 1979.|$|E
50|$|From <b>the</b> late 1940s <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 1960s, <b>the</b> <b>building</b> {{was used}} for storage for both the Starlight Civic Opera and San Diego's Park and Recreation department. By this point <b>the</b> <b>building</b> was in poor shape and was {{recommended}} by a 1960 commission <b>to</b> demolish <b>the</b> <b>building.</b> Several San Diego groups instead worked <b>to</b> get <b>the</b> <b>building</b> listed on <b>the</b> National Register of Historic Places in 1973, saving it from being destroyed.|$|R

5|$|In {{order for}} the heated water to form a geyser, a {{plumbing}} system made of fractures, fissures, porous spaces, and sometimes cavities is required. This includes a reservoir to hold the water while it is being heated. Geysers are generally aligned along faults. Constrictions in the system are essential <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> up of pressure before an eruption.|$|E

5|$|Life in the Middle Ages {{centred on}} the {{families}} who owned the manor {{in what was then}} an isolated rural community. Agriculture, hand loom weaving, quarrying and mining occupied the few inhabitants until the middle of the 19th century. A chapel built before 1541 was replaced by the present church in 1666 and by 1703 Nonconformism led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> of a Presbyterian church, now a Unitarian Chapel. A grammar school was founded by charter of Queen Elizabeth I in 1556.|$|E
50|$|For {{much of its}} history, <b>the</b> <b>building</b> was {{commonly}} referred <b>to</b> as <b>the</b> Westvaco <b>Building</b> and was <b>the</b> headquarters of Westvaco.
