5|$|Carr also theorizes {{that the}} {{capacity}} to contemplate may diminish as computer algorithms unburden an Internet user's brain {{of much of the}} painstaking knowledge work — the manipulation of abstract information and knowledge — that was previously done manually. In comparing the Internet with Frederick Winslow Taylor's management system for industrial efficiency, Carr makes the point that back then some workers complained that they felt they were becoming mere automatons due to the systemic application of <b>Taylorism</b> — a theory of management that analyzes and synthesizes workflow processes, improving labor productivity. Carr selects Google as a prime example of a company in which computer engineers and software designers have applied <b>Taylorism</b> to the knowledge industry, delivering increasingly robust information that may have the effect of minimizing opportunities to ponder ambiguities. Additionally, he argues that the Internet's dominant business model is one that thrives as companies either collect information on users or deliver them advertisements, therefore companies capitalize on users who move from link to link rather than those who engage in sustained thought.|$|E
25|$|In {{the middle}} of 1960 some counter-movements to <b>Taylorism</b> arose. Representatives of the {{so-called}} Human Relations movement urged humanization and democratization of the working world. The criticism of <b>Taylorism</b> supports the unilateral approach of labor. Strictly speaking, <b>Taylorism</b> is not a scientific theory. All theories of F.W. Taylor are based on experiments. On the basis of samples, conclusions were made, which were then generalized. There is no representativeness of the selected sample.|$|E
25|$|<b>Taylorism</b> {{led to a}} {{performance}} increase in companies. All superfluous working steps are avoided. The company benefits from the productivity of the workers and this in turn from higher wages. Unused productivity resources were effectively exploited by <b>Taylorism.</b>|$|E
2500|$|<b>Taylorism's</b> {{approach}} is called [...] The increased wage {{alone is not}} a permanent incentive for the workers {{to carry out the}} same monotonous work. Worker-friendly work structures are required. People no longer want to be perceived merely as executive organ. The complete separation from manual and headwork leads to a lack of pleasure in the execution of the work steps.|$|R
25|$|Subsequent {{forms of}} {{scientific}} management were articulated by Taylor's disciples, such as Henry Gantt; other engineers and managers, such as Benjamin S. Graham; and other theorists, such as Max Weber. Taylor's work also contrasts with other efforts, {{including those of}} Henri Fayol and those of Frank Gilbreth, Sr. and Lillian Moller Gilbreth (whose views originally shared much with Taylor's but later diverged in response to <b>Taylorism's</b> inadequate handling of human relations).|$|R
25|$|One of {{the most}} famous critiques of Taylor came from Antonio Gramsci in his Prison Notebooks (1937), where Gramsci argued that <b>Taylorism</b> {{attempts}} to subordinate workers to management. He also argued that the repetitive work produced by <b>Taylorism</b> might actually give rise to revolutionary thoughts in workers' minds.|$|E

25|$|The {{work of the}} Gilbreths {{is often}} {{associated}} with that of Frederick Winslow Taylor, yet there was a substantial philosophical difference between the Gilbreths and Taylor. The symbol of <b>Taylorism</b> was the stopwatch; Taylor was concerned primarily with reducing process times. The Gilbreths, in contrast, sought to make processes more efficient by reducing the motions involved. They saw their approach as more concerned with workers' welfare than <b>Taylorism,</b> which workers themselves often perceived as concerned mainly with profit. This difference led to a personal rift between Taylor and the Gilbreths which, after Taylor's death, turned into a feud between the Gilbreths and Taylor's followers. After Frank's death, Lillian Gilbreth took steps to heal the rift; however, some friction remains over questions of history and intellectual property.|$|E
25|$|Frederick had {{transferred}} {{the concepts of}} <b>Taylorism</b> from the factory to domestic work. These included suitable tools, rational study of movements and timing of tasks. Scientific standards for housework were derived from scientific standards for workshops, intended to streamline {{the work of a}} housewife.|$|E
25|$|Other work {{processes}} involved {{minimizing the}} number of steps in doing individual tasks, such as bricklaying, by performing time and motion studies to determine the one best method, the system becoming known as <b>Taylorism</b> after Fredrick Winslow Taylor who is the best known developer of this method, which {{is also known as}} scientific management after his work The Principles of Scientific Management.|$|E
25|$|In the 21st {{century the}} {{tendency}} to overcome <b>Taylorism</b> is very great. The trend is moving away from assembly line work, since people are increasingly being replaced by machines in production plants and sub-processes are automated, so that human labor is not necessary in these cases. The desire for automated workflow in companies is intended to reduce costs and support the company at the operational level.|$|E
25|$|One of Bedaux's {{principal}} engagements in Italy was at {{the iconic}} Fiat plant in Turin, whose founder Giovanni Agnelli was also head of the Società Italiana Bedaux. These management interventions were later made famous by {{the founder of the}} Italian Communist Party, Antonio Gramsci, whose Prison Notebooks analyzed the ramifications of <b>Taylorism</b> at the plant. The Bedaux System also met with resistance at the Pertusola mines in Sardinia.|$|E
25|$|The {{trend to}} {{increasing}} gasification and electrification continued {{at the turn}} of the 20th century. In industry, it was the phase of work process optimization. <b>Taylorism</b> was born, and time-motion studies were used to optimize processes. These ideas also spilled over into domestic kitchen architecture because of a growing trend that called for a professionalization of household work, started in the mid-19th century by Catharine Beecher and amplified by Christine Frederick's publications in the 1910s.|$|E
25|$|Other thinkers soon {{offered more}} {{ideas on the}} roles that workers play in mature {{industrial}} systems. These included ideas on improvement of the individual worker with attention to the worker's needs, not just {{the needs of the}} whole. James Hartness published The Human Factor in Works Management in 1912, while Frank Gilbreth and Lillian Moller Gilbreth offered their own alternatives to <b>Taylorism.</b> The human relations school of management evolved in the 1930s to complement rather than replace scientific management, with <b>Taylorism</b> determining the organisation of the work process, and human relations helping to adapt the workers to the new procedures. Today's efficiency-seeking methods, such as lean manufacturing, include respect for workers and fulfillment of their needs as integral parts of the theory. (Workers slogging their way through workdays in the business world do encounter flawed implementations of these methods that make jobs unpleasant; but these implementations generally lack managerial competence in matching theory to execution.) Clearly a syncretism has occurred since Taylor's day, although its implementation has been uneven, as lean management in capable hands has produced good results for both managers and workers, but in incompetent hands has damaged enterprises.|$|E
25|$|The {{structure}} {{and size of}} a company must be distinguished. Depending on which dispositions are predominant, {{the size of the}} company, the sector, and the number of employees in an organization, one can examine whether approaches of <b>Taylorism</b> are prevalent. It is believed to be predominant in the automotive industry. In {{spite of the fact that}} a lot of activities have been replaced by machines during the production, it is ultimately the person who can check the quality of a product.|$|E
25|$|Process {{management}} uses some of {{the techniques}} from product quality management and {{some of the}} techniques from customer service management. It looks at an activity as a sequential process. The objective is to find inefficiencies and make the process more effective. Although the procedures have a long history, dating back to <b>Taylorism,</b> the scope of their applicability has been greatly widened, leaving no aspect of the firm free from potential process improvements. Because of the broad applicability of process management techniques, they {{can be used as a}} basis for competitive advantage.|$|E
25|$|The working {{world of}} the 21st century is mainly based on Total Quality Management. This is derived from quality control. In {{contrast}} to <b>Taylorism,</b> by which products are produced in the shortest possible time without any form of quality control and delivered to the end customer, the focus {{in the 21st century}} is on quality control at TQM. In order to avoid error rates, it is necessary to hire specialists to check all the products which have been manufactured before they are delivered to the end customer. The quality controls have improved over time, and incorrect partial processes can be detected in time and removed from the production process.|$|E
25|$|Hillman's {{belief in}} {{stability}} {{as the basis}} for progress was coupled with a willingness to embrace industrial engineering approaches, such as <b>Taylorism,</b> that sought to rationalize the work processes as well. This put Hillman and the ACW leadership at odds with the strong anarcho-syndicalist tendencies within the union's membership, many of whom believed in direct action as a principle as well as tactic. On the other hand, it made Hillman receptive in the early 1920s to the Soviet Union's reconstruction efforts, particularly during its New Economic Policy phase. Hillman led the union into a joint business project with the Soviet Union that brought western technology and principles of industrial management to ten clothing factories in the Soviet Union.|$|E
25|$|It {{is often}} assumed that Fordism derives from Taylor's work. Taylor {{apparently}} made this assumption himself when visiting the Ford Motor Company's Michigan plants {{not too long}} before he died, but {{it is likely that}} the methods at Ford were evolved independently, and that any influence from Taylor's work was indirect at best. Charles E. Sorensen, a principal of the company during its first four decades, disclaimed any connection at all. There was a belief at Ford, which remained dominant until Henry Ford II took over the company in 1945, that the world's experts were worthless, because if Ford had listened to them, it would have failed to attain its great successes. Henry Ford felt that he had succeeded in spite of, not because of, experts, who had tried to stop him in various ways (disagreeing about price points, production methods, car features, business financing, and other issues). Sorensen thus was dismissive of Taylor and lumped him into the category of useless experts. Sorensen held the New England machine tool vendor Walter Flanders in high esteem and credits him for the efficient floorplan layout at Ford, claiming that Flanders knew nothing about Taylor. Flanders may have been exposed to the spirit of <b>Taylorism</b> elsewhere, and may have been influenced by it, but he did not cite it when developing his production technique. Regardless, the Ford team apparently did independently invent modern mass production techniques in the period of 1905-1915, and they themselves were not aware of any borrowing from <b>Taylorism.</b> Perhaps it is only possible with hindsight to see the zeitgeist that (indirectly) connected the budding Fordism to the rest of the efficiency movement during the decade of 1905-1915.|$|E
25|$|Fred Lip {{tried to}} smooth down the growing discontent. He {{spoke to the}} union workers of <b>taylorism</b> (scientific management), and {{proposed}} {{to increase the number}} of representatives on the comité d'entreprise (works council, the workers' representation in the factory), in order to have younger representatives. Although this was illegal, the union workers agreed, and elections were organized. Although Fred Lip had believed this would allow him more control of the workers, in less than a year all the young representatives joined the CFTC. Fred Lip then submitted a proposal to the inspection du travail (government labor inspection office) which would eliminate all of the sector of the company to which most of the union workers belonged, including Charles Piaget. However, he offered Piaget a promotion, naming him head of the workshop. For the next year, the workers blocked attempts to eliminate the department, opposing those who tried to move the machines out of the factory.|$|E

It found support in both Vladimir Lenin and Leon Trotsky. Gastev continued to promote this system of labor management until his arrest and execution in 1939. In the 1920s and 1930s, the Soviet Union enthusiastically embraced Fordism and <b>Taylorism,</b> importing American experts in both fields as well as American engineering firms to build parts of its new industrial infrastructure. The concepts of the Five Year Plan and the centrally planned economy can be traced directly {{to the influence of}} <b>Taylorism</b> on Soviet thinking.

2500|$|<b>Taylorism</b> is, {{according}} to Stephen P. Waring, considered very controversial, despite its popularity. [...] It is often criticized for turning the worker into an [...] "automaton" [...] or [...] "machine." [...] Due to techniques employed with scientific management, employees {{claim to have}} become overworked and were hostile to the process. Criticisms commonly came from workers who were subjected to an accelerated work pace, lower standards of workmanship, lower product-quality, and lagging wages. [...] Workers defied being reduced to such machines, and objected to the practices of <b>Taylorism.</b> Many workers formed unions, demanded higher pay, and went on strike {{to be free of}} control issues. [...] This ignited class conflict, which <b>Taylorism</b> was initially meant to prevent. [...] Efforts to resolve the conflicts included methods of scientific collectivism, making agreements with unions, and the personnel management movement.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Taylorism</b> {{approaches}} are largely prevalent in companies where machines can not perform certain activities. Certain subprocesses are {{still to be}} carried out by humans, such as the sorting out of damaged fruit in the final process before the goods are packed by machines.

2500|$|Scientific {{management}} {{is a theory}} of management that analyzes and [...] workflows. Its main objective is improving economic efficiency, especially labor productivity.

Scientific {{management is}} sometimes known as <b>Taylorism</b> after its founder, Frederick Winslow Taylor.|$|E
2500|$|In the Soviet Union, Vladimir Lenin {{was very}} {{impressed}} by <b>Taylorism,</b> which he and Joseph Stalin sought to incorporate into Soviet manufacturing. <b>Taylorism</b> and the mass production methods of Henry Ford thus became highly influential {{during the early years}} of the Soviet Union. Nevertheless, [...] " [...] Frederick Taylor's methods have never really taken root in the Soviet Union." [...] The voluntaristic approach of the Stakhanovite movement in the 1930s of setting individual records was diametrically opposed to Taylor's systematic approach and proved to be counter-productive. The stop-and-go of the production process – workers having nothing to do at the beginning of a month and 'storming' during illegal extra shifts at the end of the month – which prevailed even in the 1980s had nothing to do with the successfully taylorized plants e.g., of Toyota which are characterized by continuous production processes (heijunka) which are continuously improved (kaizen).|$|E
2500|$|Google's {{methods of}} {{increasing}} productivity and output {{can be seen}} to be influenced by <b>Taylorism</b> as well.

2500|$|The {{enormity of}} the Holocaust has {{prompted}} much analysis. The Holocaust has been characterized as a project of industrial extermination.

[...] Beginning his book with a description of the guillotine, which according to him marks the entry of the Industrial Revolution into capital punishment, he writes: [...] "Through an irony of history, the theories of Frederick Taylor" [...] (<b>taylorism)</b> were applied by a totalitarian system to serve [...] "not production, but extermination." ...|$|E
2500|$|With the {{division}} of labor that became commonplace as <b>Taylorism</b> was implemented in manufacturing, workers lost their sense of connection to the production of goods. Workers began to feel disenfranchised with the monotonous and unfulfilling work they were doing in factories. Before scientific management, workers felt a sense of pride when completing their good, which went away when workers only completed one part of production. [...] "The further 'progress' of industrial development... increased the anomic or forced division of labor," [...] the opposite of what Taylor thought would be the effect. Partial adoption of Taylor's principles by management seeking to boost efficiency, while ignoring principles such as fair pay and direct engagement by managers, led to further tensions and the rise of unions to represent workers needs.|$|E
2500|$|Future US Supreme Court justice Louis Brandeis {{coined the}} term {{scientific}} management {{in the course of}} his argument for the Eastern Rate Case before the Interstate Commerce Commission in 1910. Brandeis argued that railroads, when governed according to Taylor's principles, did not need to raise rates to increase wages. Taylor used Brandeis's term in the title of his monograph The Principles of Scientific Management, published in 1911. The Eastern Rate Case propelled Taylor's ideas to the forefront of the management agenda. Taylor wrote to Brandeis [...] "I have rarely seen a new movement started with such great momentum as you have given this one." [...] Taylor's approach is also often referred to as Taylor's Principles, or, frequently disparagingly, as <b>Taylorism.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Peter Drucker saw Frederick Taylor as {{the creator}} of {{knowledge}} management, because the aim of scientific management was to produce knowledge about how to improve work processes.

For example, Taylor believed scientific management could be extended to [...] "the work of our salesmen". [...] Shortly after his death, his acolyte Harlow S. Person began to lecture corporate audiences on the possibility of using <b>Taylorism</b> for [...] "sales engineering" [...] (Person was talking about what is now called sales process engineering—engineering the processes that salespeople use—not about what we call sales engineering today.) This was a watershed insight in the history of corporate marketing.|$|E
