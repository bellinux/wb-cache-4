25|$|Despite Star Treks proven success, NBC and ABC only {{offered to}} {{consider}} pilot scripts {{for the new}} series, and CBS offered to air a miniseries <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>become</b> a series if it did well. That the Big Three television networks treated Paramount's most appealing and valuable property as they would any other series offended the studio. Fox wanted the show to help launch the new network, but wanted it by March 1987, and would only commit to 13 episodes instead of a full season. The unsuccessful negotiations convinced the studio that it could only protect Star Trek with full control.|$|E

25|$|Besides the H-IIA/B and Epsilon rockets, JAXA is also {{developing}} technology for a next-generation supersonic transport <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>become</b> the commercial {{replacement for the}} Concorde. The design goal of the project (working name Next Generation Supersonic Transport) {{is to develop a}} jet that can carry 300 passengers at Mach 2. A subscale model of the jet underwent aerodynamic testing in September and October 2005 in Australia. In 2015 JAXA performed tests aimed at reducing the effects of super sonic flight under the D-SEND program. The economic success of such a project is still unclear, and as a consequence the project has been met with limited interest from Japanese aerospace companies like Mitsubishi Heavy Industries so far.|$|E
500|$|Another {{consideration}} is loss of sensation, [...] which puts {{people at risk}} for wounds such as pressure sores and injuries <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>become</b> worse before being noticed. Friction from sexual activity may damage the skin, so it is necessary after sex to inspect areas {{that could have been}} hurt, particularly the buttocks and genital area. People who already have pressure sores must take care not to make the wounds worse. Irritation to the genitals increases risk for vaginal infections, which get worse if they go unnoticed. Women who do not get sufficient vaginal lubrication on their own can use a commercially available personal lubricant to decrease friction.|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} in Radiohead's Oxford studio, Godrich's studio in Covent Garden, and Yorke's home. Yorke wanted to [...] "approach and engage with computers and not a lot else, and yet still have lots of life and energy in the music." [...] To generate ideas, he cut and pasted clips at random from Radiohead's library of original samples, {{many of which were}} created on laptops in hotel rooms as the band toured. He would send sound fragments to Godrich, who identified passages <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>become</b> songs, edited them, and returned them to Yorke. Describing the collaborative process, Yorke said: [...] "'Black Swan', back in the day, was a ... nine-minute load of bollocks. Except for this one juicy bit, and [...] goes past and goes, 'That bit. Fuck the rest.' Usually it's something like that." ...|$|E

500|$|In the {{conclusion}} of [...] "Beside the Dying Fire," [...] a large prison {{is seen in the}} background hovering over the survivors' temporary settlement. Bear McCreary composed a score for the sequence, which he thought would lay the groundworks for a future theme for the location. [...] "There’s something really powerful there <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>become,</b> sort of like a heartbeat-like theme for this location, which is kind of similar to what I had in mind when I read the comics years ago when I first got there," [...] he asserted. [...] "I had been thinking about it, there’s so many great prison shows and movies and there are certain sounds you kind of associate with it, and I don’t want to do that. But, we’ll see. I mean it really depends on where they take the show. It’s a little early to think about it, but I’m definitely thinking about it anyway." ...|$|E
500|$|On Sint Maarten, {{officials}} advised {{residents to}} start all necessary actions {{to prepare for a}} hurricane. Residents were told to clear their yards of any debris or lose furniture <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>become</b> airborne during the storm, place shutters over windows and doors and assist elderly neighbors with shuttering their homes, and mariners should find a safe haven. A curfew from 10:00p.m. on October15 to 10:00a.m. on October16 was put in place. Due to the possibility of flash flooding, residents were to unclog and free up all waterways around their homes. Officials also warned people to stay away from areas prone to landslides until the [...] "all-clear" [...] was given. Owners of livestock were advised to have insured that they were secured in holding areas. As a precaution, the water supply would be shut down from 8:00p.m. October15 to 8:00a.m. October16. Four public areas, St. Peters Community Center, Dutch Quarter Community Center, Genevieve de Weever School, and the Salvation Army building would be used as emergency shelters.|$|E
500|$|Writer Steven Moffat came up {{with the}} concept for [...] "The Time of Angels" [...] and [...] "Flesh and Stone" [...] when he was {{thinking}} of the worst possible situations to be in with the Weeping Angels and thought of the inability to see. His first idea was blindness, though this developed into the situation that Amy ends up in. Moffat designed the two-part story to be a more action-oriented sequel to [...] "Blink", an episode he wrote for the third series that introduced the Weeping Angels. He was inspired by the relationship between the film Alien and its sequel, Aliens, which he referred to as [...] "the best conceived movie sequel ever", describing it as being more [...] "highly coloured" [...] as opposed to Alien more low-key tone. He also intended for the Angels to have a plan <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>become</b> [...] "almost like a war", in contrast to the way they were struggling to survive in [...] "Blink". The title [...] "Flesh and Stone" [...] was suggested by Moffat's son.|$|E

500|$|According to critic Nancy Wingate, Heyer's detective novels, {{the last}} written in 1953, often {{featured}} unoriginal methods, motives, and characters, with {{seven of them}} using inheritance as the motive. The novels were always set in London, a small village, or at a houseparty. Critic Erik Routley labelled many of her characters clichés, including the uneducated policeman, an exotic Spanish dancer, and a country vicar with a neurotic wife. In one of her novels, the characters' surnames were even in alphabetical order according to the order they were introduced. According to Wingate, Heyer's detective stories, {{like many of the}} others of the time, exhibited a distinct snobbery towards foreigners and the lower classes. Her middle-class men were often crude and stupid, while the women were either incredibly practical or exhibited poor judgement, usually using poor grammar <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>become</b> vicious. Despite the stereotypes, however, Routley maintains that Heyer had [...] "a quite remarkable gift for reproducing the brittle and ironic conversation of the upper middle class Englishwoman of that age (immediately before 1940)". Wingate further mentions that Heyer's thrillers were known [...] "for their wit and comedy as well as for their well-woven plots".|$|E
500|$|Critics concurred that Grand Theft Auto V {{was among}} seventh {{generation}} console gaming's best {{and a great}} closing title before the eighth generation's emergence. Polygons Plante observed that the game would [...] "bridge between games' present and the future", and declared it [...] "the closure of this generation, and the benchmark for the next". VideoGamer.com's Simon Miller considered it [...] "the ultimate swansong for this console cycle" [...] that would [...] "cast a long shadow over the next". Three days after its release, the game ranked second on IGN's [...] "Top 25 Xbox 360 Games" [...] list. Editor Ryan McCaffrey considered that the open world's scale and detail succeeded the majority of other Xbox 360 games. He called the game [...] "a triumph both for gamers and for the medium itself, and it deserves its runaway success". In November 2013, Hardcore Gamer placed the game third on their [...] "Top 100 Games of the Generation" [...] list. They cited its improved shooting and driving mechanics over its predecessors, and considered the multiple protagonist design [...] "a welcome change of pace" [...] <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>become</b> an eighth generation gaming benchmark. In December, The Daily Telegraph listed the game among their [...] "50 best games of the console generation". They called it a [...] "cultural behemoth" [...] that [...] "will be Rockstar's lasting legacy".|$|E
500|$|Greenwald {{first tried}} {{to take control of}} the sounds from the {{expensive}} synthesizers Guitar Center was selling by recording samples of them, but was unimpressed with the results. On a later visit to the shop, he recorded what would be the first sound to be featured on the album; he taped a guy who [...] "was just going for it on a drum kit", lowering the speed of the sample of the drum recording he used. The singer described how he felt while editing the sample: [...] "I started to hear some kind of solace in a place that is sonically hellish.” Greenwald started recording the album in a Guitar Center in Brooklyn, and then at a shop in Baltimore. Instead of looking to record instruments specifically planned for a song, Greenwald taped whatever sound he thought <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>become</b> better in quality when editing them later. Greenwald ended up with around 40 hours of iPhone recordings to work at his home. Some snippets were played through a 4-track tape recorder, others were old pedals and some were looped or used as synthesizer patches. These recordings were put together, EQ'd, mixed and mastered in Pro Tools. Much planning was put into how the recordings were edited together, as he tried to [...] "connect things that were seemingly un-connectable." [...] The end result was an album that featured ambient, dub, new-age, experimental and post-vaporwave styles.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by lead writer and {{executive}} producer Steven Moffat. He designed the two-part episode as a more action-oriented sequel to [...] "Blink", an episode he had written for the third series. He compared the relationship to the film Alien and its sequel Aliens, with the former being more low-key and the latter more [...] "highly coloured". Moffat thought that Aliens was [...] "the best conceived movie sequel ever" [...] and decided {{to use it as}} a model. He also intended to portray the Angels and their actions differently; in [...] "Blink" [...] they were barely surviving and resembled scavengers, while in [...] "The Time of Angels" [...] he wanted them to have a plan <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>become</b> [...] "almost like a war". The two-part story was intended to show the worst possible instance that could occur with the Weeping Angels, which was the inability to see, as explored in the second part, [...] "Flesh and Stone", when Amy must keep her eyes closed. Executive producer Piers Wenger thought that the Delirium Archive, the museum the Doctor and Amy visited at the beginning of the episode, needed to be explained, therefore Moffat named it [...] "the final resting place of the Headless Monks" [...] and sent it to him via text message. The Headless Monks themselves appeared in the mid-series finale of the next series, [...] "A Good Man Goes to War".|$|E
500|$|Architect Enos Cooke of New Kensington {{developed}} {{the plan for}} the church building. In 1940, {{a friend of the}} church, John Stanish, informed Mt. St. Peter's congregation that the Mellon mansion, 6500 Fifth Avenue, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, was to be demolished. Stanish had worked for the three Mellon brothers until the last of them died in 1938. The Mellon family had spent years entertaining important people, including royalty, celebrities, well known financiers, and statesmen in the Mellon Mansion. It was built using Michigan sandstone and was four stories high on one side and three stories high on the other. The mansion had sixty-five rooms, plus halls and vestibules. There were 11 bathrooms, one of which had cost over $10,000 to complete because the walls and floor were covered in Italian marble and the fixtures were plated in gold. At one time, a hundred servants had maintained the house and surrounding grounds. The mansion had been completed in 1909 and had cost Mr. Mellon approximately three million dollars. The inside was filled with marble from all over the world, including China, Japan, and India. There were bronze doors cast in England, hand painted ceilings, and steel beams manufactured by the Carnegie Steel Company. In addition, {{one of the most expensive}} organs in the world was housed in this building. The items which the mansion contained were being sold for less than their actual values. For example, a half a million dollars worth of furniture had been sold for $3,800. The building contained many items that could easily be used in a church. There were mantles <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>become</b> altars and pieces of architecture, such as angel statues, that could be placed in Mount St. Peter Church. In 1940, St. Peter's congregation bought all of the stone, granite, marble, bronze doors, and railings from the mansion. In addition, the congregation purchased thirty tons of steel beams, sixty-five oak doors, chandeliers, and some other items, and the members transported all of the marble [...] from Pittsburgh to New Kensington. The location of the mansion is now home to Mellon Park.|$|E
