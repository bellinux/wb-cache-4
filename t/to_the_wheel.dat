5|$|Alfred Godsal {{intended}} to swing Vindictive broadside {{on into the}} channel mouth, but as he ordered the turn, the right screw broke down completely, preventing the cruiser from fully turning. Before this was realised on the cruiser's bridge, a shell fired from a gun battery on shore struck Commander Godsal directly, killing him instantly and shattering the bridge structure. Most of the bridge crew were killed or wounded by the blast, including First Lieutenant Victor Crutchley, who staggered <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> and attempted to force the ship to make the full turn into the channel. The damaged propeller made this maneuver impossible and the drifting cruiser floated out of the channel and became stuck on a sandbank outside, only partially obscuring the entranceway.|$|E
5|$|The {{pumping station}} {{operated}} continuously, providing {{water for the}} increasing traffic on the canal. Problems {{with the size of}} the water wheel, which was supported at either end, meant that the middle of the wheel sagged, putting strain on the bearings and stays. In the 1840s the trussing was changed from stays to tension rods to strengthen and lighten the wheel, along with improvements to the pumps. The changes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> were unsuccessful, and in the 1850s a central bearing was added dividing the wheel in two.|$|E
5|$|Nynaeve, {{under the}} {{instruction}} of Cadsuane, locates Tam al'Thor, Rand's father, who meets with Rand {{in an attempt to}} break his emotional isolation. Rand becomes angry when he learns that Tam was sent by Cadsuane, nearly killing his father before fleeing in horror at what he had almost done. Rand Travels to the Seanchan-held city of Ebou Dar, intending to destroy their entire army, but he becomes reluctant to act after seeing how peaceful the city is. Nearly mad with rage and grief, he Travels to the top of Dragonmount, the location where he killed himself in a past life. Angry at the futility of life bound <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wheel,</b> he uses the Choedan Kal to draw enough power to destroy the world. Lews Therin, a voice in Rand's head from his past life, suggests that by being reborn one has the opportunity to do things right. Agreeing, Rand turns the power of the Choedan Kal against itself, destroying it. Rand is finally able to laugh again.|$|E
40|$|Three {{experiments}} used rats <b>to</b> examine <b>the</b> {{effect of}} a single bout of voluntary activity (<b>wheel</b> running) on <b>the</b> acquisition, extinction, and reconsolidation of context conditioned fear. In Experiment 1, rats provided with access to a wheel for 3 h immediately before or after a shocked exposure to a context froze more when tested in that context than rats provided with access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheels</b> 6 h after the shocked exposure or rats not provided with access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheels.</b> In Experiment 2, rats provided with access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheels</b> immediately before or after a nonshocked exposure <b>to</b> <b>the</b> conditioned context froze less when tested in that context than rats provided with access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheels</b> 6 h after the nonshocked exposure or rats not provided with access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheels.</b> In Experiment 3, rats provided with access to wheels immediately after an extended nonshocked exposure <b>to</b> <b>the</b> conditioned context again froze less, whereas rats provided with access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheels</b> after a brief nonshocked exposure froze more on the subsequent test than sedentary controls. These results show that a single bout of running can enhance acquisition, extinction, and reconsolidation of context conditioned fear. © 2014 Siette et al...|$|R
50|$|Aurica’s base {{technology}} {{appears to}} be its Recurve Drive System, an “extended range, variable speed motor controller” that attaches to four independent electric motors connected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheels.</b> <b>The</b> company states that the primary benefit is that “power doesn’t have to be transferred mechanically” <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheels</b> with such a system.|$|R
50|$|An {{automobile}} may use {{a longitudinal}} shaft to deliver power from an engine/transmission <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{other end of}} the vehicle before it goes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheels.</b> A pair of short drive shafts is commonly used to send power from a central differential, transmission, or transaxle <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Porsche hull designs {{included}} a rear-mounted turret and a mid-mounted engine. The suspension {{was the same}} as on the Elefant tank destroyer. This had six road wheels per side mounted in paired bogies sprung with short longitudinal torsion bars that were integral <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> pair; this saved internal space and facilitated repairs. One Porsche version had a gasoline-electric drive (fundamentally identical to a Diesel-electric transmission, only using a gasoline-fueled engine as the prime mover), similar to a gasoline-electric hybrid but without a storage battery; two separate drive trains in parallel, one per side of the tank, each consisting of a hybrid drive train; gasoline engine – electric generator – electric motor – drive sprocket. This method of propulsion had been attempted before on the Tiger (P) (later Elefant prototypes) and in some US designs, but had never been put into production. The Porsche suspension components were later used on a few of the later Jagdtiger tank destroyers. Another proposal was to use hydraulic drives. Dr. Porsche's unorthodox designs gathered little favour.|$|E
5|$|The VH series Commodore {{introduced}} in September 1981 brought moderately updated frontal bodywork, {{with a new}} bonnet and front guards to facilitate the reshaped headlamps and a horizontally slatted grille. These front-end design changes worked to produce a longer, yet wider look. At the rear, sedans featured redesigned tail light clusters, the design of which borrowed from Mercedes-Benz models of the day, using a louvered design. At the same time, the nomenclature of the range was rationalised. The SL superseded the L as the base model, with the old SL level becoming the mid-range SL/X, and the SL/E remaining as the top-of-the-line variant. Wagons were restricted to the SL and SL/X trims. Redesigned pentagonal alloy wheels—replacing the original SL/E type used since 1978—along with a black painted B-pillar, wrap-around chrome rear bumper extensions <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> arches, and extended tail lamps that converged with the license plate alcove—distinguished the range-topping SL/E from other variants. The new pentagonal wheels were initially in short supply, such that only Shadowtone option SL/E sedans received them during 1981 production.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} {{brakes on}} the RS4 are of two-piece construction. The cast iron discs are cross-drilled and radially ventilated and float on aluminium alloy disc hubs. The two-piece disc construction reduces unsprung mass and also reduces {{the transmission of}} heat generated by the brakes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> bearings.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> reducing <b>the</b> torque applied <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheels,</b> <b>the</b> {{coefficient of}} friction may be improved by using higher friction materials.|$|R
50|$|Another {{reason to}} add a lever <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{mousetrap}} bar is <b>to</b> reduce <b>the</b> amount of torque applied <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheels.</b> If too much torque is applied <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheels,</b> <b>the</b> force between <b>the</b> <b>wheels</b> and <b>the</b> ground will exceed the maximum frictional force due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> coefficient of friction between <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> and ground surfaces. When this happens, <b>the</b> <b>wheels</b> slip and energy stored in the spring is wasted. Using a long lever on the mousetrap bar reduces the tension in <b>the</b> string due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> spring's torque, and thus reduces <b>the</b> torque applied <b>to</b> <b>the</b> car's <b>wheels.</b>|$|R

25|$|The rotor {{is usually}} made of cast iron, but may {{in some cases}} be made of {{composites}} such as reinforced carbon–carbon or ceramic matrix composites. This is connected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> and/or the axle. To retard the wheel, friction material {{in the form of}} brake pads, mounted on the brake caliper, is forced mechanically, hydraulically, pneumatically, or electromagnetically against both sides of the rotor. Friction causes the rotor and attached wheel to slow or stop.|$|E
25|$|Upon Harroun's {{declared}} victory, second-place finisher Mulford supposedly protested, contending he had lapped Harroun {{when the}} Marmon limped {{in on the}} torn tire, an argument appearing plausible to some, due to an accident disrupting the official timing and scoring stand at nearly the same time. However, race officials were quick to note Mulford's subsequent pit stop forced the Lozier crew to spend several minutes themselves changing a tire which stuck <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> hub; Mulford's protest was thus denied.|$|E

25|$|Two wheels {{fixed to}} the same axle turn {{at the same speed}} as a vehicle goes around curves. This either forces one to slip, if possible, to balance the {{apparent}} distance covered, or creates uncomfortable and mechanically stressful wheel hop. To prevent this the wheels are allowed to turn at different speeds using a mechanical or hydraulic differential. This allows one driveshaft to independently drive two output shafts, axles that go from the differential <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheel,</b> at different speeds.|$|E
25|$|The trams were {{equipped}} with two Hägglund-built H-bogies. They had an outer frame with the motor axles {{parallel with the}} wheel axles. Each axle had four rubber suspensions as its primary suspension. The carriage rested on the bogie on rubber plates. Later the bogies were supplemented with a shock absorber. The motors were connected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> axles via a universal joint and a gear. The wheels were rubber suspended, but were later replaced with steel-suspended axle boxes which required less maintenance.|$|E

50|$|In {{order to}} apply any {{traction}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheels,</b> some slippage of <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> is required. For Russian trains climbing up a grade, this slip is normally 1.5% to 2.5%.|$|R

25|$|Most bicycle hubs {{incorporate}} a freewheel {{to allow the}} pedals to remain stationary while the bicycle is in motion, so that the rider can coast, i.e., ride without pedalling using forward momentum. A fixed-gear drivetrain has the drive sprocket (or cog) threaded or bolted directly to {{the hub of the}} back wheel, so that the pedals are directly coupled <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheel.</b> During acceleration, the pedal crank drives the wheel, but in other situations, the rear wheel can drive the pedal cranks. This direct coupling allows a cyclist to apply a braking force with the legs and bodyweight, by resisting the rotation of the cranks. It also makes it possible to cycle backwards.|$|E
25|$|The {{automatic}} brake works by monitoring the speed using a centrifugal governor connected by gears {{to a large}} toothed gear mounted on the pinion axle next <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> (i.e. {{it is not the}} pinion gear). When the set speed is exceeded a lever on the governor hits a lever on a brake valve, and the brakes operate. The {{automatic brake}} can only be released after the train has come to a stop, and the driver has to leave the locomotive to reset the system. On the steam locomotives, steam is applied to a small brake cylinder that acts on the driver's side brakes. On the carriages, the automatic brake is an air brake. On the diesel locomotives, a hydraulic cylinder is used.|$|E
25|$|What bicycle did Moore {{ride in the}} Paris–Rouen race in 1869? There are two {{candidates}} and three or four accounts.

It was the first high bicycle, said Bonneville, overlooking {{the fact that he}} had elsewhere said the honour belonged to Vibert. The anonymous authors of the series 'Pioneers of the Cycle Industry' in Bicycling News said that Moore rode a heavy wooden Michaux fitted with solid rubber tyres which were secured <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> rims by means of sheet-iron braces screwed to the latter, and his machine embodied a type of ball bearing which had been more or less handmade by a Parisian manufacturer...|$|E
