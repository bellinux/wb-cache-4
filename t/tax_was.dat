5|$|John's son, King Henry III, {{assessed}} the carucage on three occasions, in 1217, 1220, and 1224. A new approach in 1217 and 1220 was {{to secure the}} consent of leading noblemen for the tax to be levied. The 1217 <b>tax</b> <b>was</b> once again assessed at 3shillings per carucate. The assessment {{of the amount of}} lands held by each taxpayer involved having each landowner provide the information and swear an oath that it was correct. Like the 1200 tax, the 1217 <b>tax</b> <b>was</b> not recorded in that year's Pipe Roll, lending support to the possibility that the revenue from the <b>tax</b> <b>was</b> sent to a separate branch of the Exchequer. The 1217 carucage was only paid by laymen; the clergy made a donation in lieu of being taxed. The money raised was intended to defray the expense of the war being fought against Prince Louis of France, who had invaded England before the death of King John and was claiming the English throne.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary {{political}} issues in South Dakota include {{the costs and}} benefits of the state lottery, South Dakota's relatively low rankings in education spending (particularly teacher pay – recently the State Sales <b>Tax</b> <b>was</b> increased from 4% to 4.5% to finance an increase in teacher pay), and recent legislative and electoral attempts to ban abortion in the state.|$|E
5|$|In February 1999, Braathens {{announced}} that they would re-register all their planes in Sweden {{to avoid having to}} pay value added tax on catering and fuel. Color Air and SAS, who had their planes registered abroad, had gotten away without paying the taxes, since it only applied to Norway-registered planes. Following this announcement, the Ministry of Finance changed the rules so also foreign-owned planes had to pay the tax. The change in rules cost Color Air NOK10 million per plane per year. From 1 July 1999, the seat <b>tax</b> <b>was</b> removed, but replaced by an equivalent tax for each passenger. This made it cheaper to fly an empty plane, but more expensive to fly a full one. Color Air had reduced the number of seats in each plane to avoid the seat tax, but increased them again after the <b>tax</b> <b>was</b> removed.|$|E
50|$|Back <b>taxes</b> <b>is</b> a {{term for}} <b>taxes</b> that <b>were</b> not paid when due. Typically, these <b>are</b> <b>taxes</b> that <b>are</b> owed from a prior year.|$|R
50|$|The royalty <b>tax</b> <b>is</b> an {{indirect}} <b>tax,</b> and has <b>been</b> historically {{the most important}} mineral tax. When the production starts, the <b>tax</b> <b>is</b> due. That generates up-front revenues for the government. A different approach of the royalty <b>tax</b> <b>is,</b> to impose it as a factor payment for extraction of minerals. If royalty <b>taxes</b> <b>are</b> very high, it might influence the production, because it gets too expensive for the firms to produce and extract minerals.|$|R
50|$|In South Africa, the {{turnover}} <b>tax</b> <b>is</b> a simple <b>tax</b> on the gross income of small businesses. Businesses who elect to pay {{the turnover}} <b>tax</b> <b>are</b> exempt from VAT. Turnover <b>tax</b> <b>is</b> at a very low rate compared to most <b>taxes,</b> but it <b>is</b> calculated on gross income without any deductions.|$|R
5|$|On 1 January 2016, {{congestion}} {{taxes were}} {{increased in the}} inner-city parts of Stockholm, and also the congestion <b>tax</b> <b>was</b> introduced on Essingeleden motorway. This was the first increase of the tax since it was introduced permanently in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Taxation of {{imported}} goods, tax rate varied over the Song dynasty, from 10% to {{as high as}} 40%; however, {{during the reign of}} Emperor Shenzong (1048–1085), the tax rate for imports was lowered to 6.67%. The <b>tax</b> <b>was</b> goods in kind, not money.|$|E
5|$|The American Medical Association (AMA) {{opposed the}} act because the <b>tax</b> <b>was</b> imposed on {{physicians}} prescribing cannabis, retail pharmacists selling cannabis, and medical cannabis cultivation and manufacturing; instead of enacting the Marihuana Tax Act the AMA proposed cannabis {{be added to}} the Harrison Narcotics Tax Act. This approach was unappealing to some legislators who feared that adding a new substance to the Harrison Act would subject that act to new legal scrutiny. Since the federal government had no authority under the 10th Amendment to regulate medicines, that power being reserved by individual states in 1937, a <b>tax</b> <b>was</b> the only viable way to legislate marijuana.|$|E
50|$|The {{property}} <b>tax</b> most citizens <b>are</b> {{aware of}} {{is known as}} an ad valorem <b>tax.</b> This <b>tax</b> <b>is</b> used to fund general or day-to-day government operations. An ad valorem <b>tax</b> <b>is</b> commonly levied on both real and personal property. A property <b>tax</b> <b>is</b> based upon a property's market value. The ad valorem <b>tax</b> levy <b>is</b> based upon a millage rate which never varies from parcel to parcel. The foundation principles for ad valorem <b>taxes</b> <b>are</b> that each property is valued according to its market value (equity) and that each property <b>is</b> <b>taxed</b> based upon a single millage rate that applies to everyone (uniformity).|$|R

5|$|The Whiskey Rebellion {{demonstrated}} that the new national government had the will and ability to suppress violent resistance to its laws, though the whiskey excise remained difficult to collect. The events contributed {{to the formation of}} political parties in the United States, a process already underway. The whiskey <b>tax</b> <b>was</b> repealed in the early 1800s during the Jefferson administration.|$|E
5|$|A similar {{source of}} funds {{was to be the}} tax on exports of cotton. However, in {{addition}} to the difficulties associated with the blockade, the self-imposed embargo on cotton meant that for all practical purposes the <b>tax</b> <b>was</b> completely ineffective as a fund raiser. Initial optimistic estimates of revenue to be collected through this tax ran as high as 20 million dollars, but in the end only $30 thousand was collected.|$|E
5|$|However, Gandhi had sound {{reasons for}} his decision. The salt <b>tax</b> <b>was</b> a deeply {{symbolic}} choice, since salt was used by nearly everyone in India, to replace the salt lost by sweating in India's tropical climate. An item of daily use could resonate more with all classes of citizens than an abstract demand for greater political rights. The salt tax represented 8.2% of the British Raj tax revenue, and hurt the poorest Indians the most significantly.|$|E
50|$|A fuel tax (also {{known as}} a petrol, {{gasoline}} or gas tax, or as a fuel duty) <b>is</b> an excise <b>tax</b> imposed {{on the sale of}} fuel. In most countries the fuel <b>tax</b> <b>is</b> imposed on fuels which are intended for transportation. Fuels used to power agricultural vehicles, and/or home heating oil which is similar to diesel <b>are</b> <b>taxed</b> at a different, usually lower rate. The fuel <b>tax</b> receipts <b>are</b> often dedicated or hypothecated to transportation projects so that the fuel <b>tax</b> <b>is</b> considered by many a user fee. In other countries, the fuel <b>tax</b> <b>is</b> a source of general revenue. Sometimes, the fuel <b>tax</b> <b>is</b> used as an ecotax, to promote ecological sustainability. Fuel <b>taxes</b> <b>are</b> often considered regressive taxes.|$|R
50|$|Indirect <b>taxes</b> <b>are</b> <b>taxes</b> which <b>are</b> levied on {{transactions}} {{rather than}} on persons (whether individuals or corporate).|$|R

5|$|Other {{government}} {{decisions in}} 1929 had attracted controversy as well. Page handed down his last budget on 22 August, which hinted at the burgeoning debt crisis and {{introduced a new}} tax on entertainment and theatres to help cover the deficit. The <b>tax</b> <b>was</b> very unpopular with the public, and the entertainment industry mounted a vocal campaign to stop it. Bruce, supported by the Brigden Report of 1929, also raised concern that protective tariffs were too high and were in need of reform a position controversial with the powerful protected industries.|$|E
5|$|The Domesday Book {{entry for}} the Hundred of Odiham surmised that the hundred in 1066 was very large with 248 {{households}} and recorded 138 villagers. 60 smallholders and 50 slaves. <b>Tax</b> <b>was</b> assessed {{to be very}} large at 78.5 exemption units. 56 ploughlands, 16.5 lord's plough teams and 41 men's plough teams were recorded. The Lord of the hundred in 1066 was Earl Harold. In 1808 the population of Bentworth was 425. Bentworth had reached its population peak in 1951, with 614 {{people living in the}} village.|$|E
5|$|The {{emergence}} of mining increased {{the migration of}} native African people in search of employment to the province from elsewhere in Africa. The mining industry improved {{the standard of living}} of those living along Northern Rhodesia's railroads, and increased the influx of white people, the Europeans from South Africa who wanted to maintain their superiority over the native African population. Native Africans were poorly treated by the whites and discouraged from working in the mines; this evolved into a racial struggle. The high rate of immigration to the region increased the number of unplanned settlements. The BSAC introduced a hut tax in 1901 in North-Eastern Rhodesia and between 1904 and 1913 in North-Western Rhodesia for all migrants. The <b>tax</b> <b>was</b> high (in some cases, six months' wages), and intended to create a system of debt bondage and generate income for investment in other mines. Unrest caused by tax increases was suppressed {{with the help of the}} British South Africa Police. The imposition of <b>tax</b> <b>was</b> a strategy adopted to create bond labour and sustain demand during the 1920s when the demand for miners was higher. The company was able to maintain low wages on account of predominance of migrant labour from rural regions. The African miners had three major issues: low wages compared to European miners, a prohibition against working in mines reserved for Europeans despite high skills, and workplace harassment and brutality.|$|E

40|$|The {{property}} <b>tax</b> <b>is</b> {{essentially a}} <b>tax</b> placed on property owners by the municipality. Cities outside of New York City may use only revenue sources authorized by New York State, and the property <b>tax</b> <b>is</b> {{one of those}} few sources. The property <b>tax</b> <b>is</b> based {{on the value of}} the property. The <b>tax</b> <b>is</b> calculated by multiplying a property’s taxable assessment by the tax rate that applies to the tax jurisdiction where the property is located...|$|R
5000|$|Typically the {{withholding}} <b>tax</b> <b>is</b> {{treated as}} a payment {{on account of the}} recipient's final tax liability, when the withholding is made in advance. It may be refunded if it is determined, when a [...] is filed, that the recipient's tax liability to the government which received the withholding <b>tax</b> <b>is</b> less than the tax withheld, or additional <b>tax</b> may <b>be</b> due if it is determined that the recipient's <b>tax</b> liability <b>is</b> more than the withholding tax. In some cases the withholding <b>tax</b> <b>is</b> treated as discharging the recipient's tax liability, and no tax return or additional <b>tax</b> <b>is</b> required. Such withholding is known as final withholding.|$|R
5|$|The government's income {{came from}} five {{principal}} sources: regular taxes, occasional taxes, fines, income taxes, miscellaneous taxes and tributes from feudatories. An emergency <b>tax</b> <b>was</b> imposed occasionally and were applicable when the kingdom was under duress, {{such as when}} it faced natural calamities, or was preparing for war or overcoming war's ravages. Income tax included taxes on crown land, wasteland, specific types of trees considered valuable to the economy, mines, salt, treasures unearthed by prospectors. Additionally, customary presents {{were given to the}} king or royal officers on such festive occasions as marriage or the birth of a son.|$|E
5|$|The private ferry {{struggled}} {{to operate at}} a profit, leading Kitsap Transit to consider a new ballot measure to fund a public passenger-only ferry service. A 0.3 percent sales <b>tax</b> <b>was</b> placed on the February 6, 2007, ballot, and was rejected by 54.5 percent of voters. As a result, Kitsap Transit pulled its funding for the private Kitsap Ferry Company, and the company suspended service on March 30, 2007. Another private operator, Aqua Express, had already ceased operations of a passenger-only service from Kingston to Seattle {{after a few months}} in 2005 due to poor ridership and increasing fuel costs.|$|E
5|$|Apollo Hall opened {{soon after}} the city's {{founding}} in 1859 and staged many plays for eager settlers. In the 1880s Horace Tabor built Denver's first opera house. After {{the start of the}} 20th century, city leaders embarked on a city beautification program that created many of the city's parks, parkways, museums, and the Municipal Auditorium, which was home to the 1908 Democratic National Convention and is now known as the Ellie Caulkins Opera House. Denver and the metropolitan areas around it continued to support culture. In 1988, voters in the Denver Metropolitan Area approved the Scientific and Cultural Facilities Tax (commonly known as SCFD), a 0.1% (1 cent per $10) sales tax that contributes money to various cultural and scientific facilities and organizations throughout the Metro area. The <b>tax</b> <b>was</b> renewed by voters in 1994 and 2004 and allows the SCFD to operate until 2018.|$|E
50|$|In China, {{the payroll}} <b>tax</b> <b>is</b> a {{specific}} <b>tax</b> which <b>is</b> paid to provinces and territories by employers, not by employees.

5|$|Because small landowning {{families}} {{represented the}} mainstay of the Han tax base, the Han government attempted to aid and protect small landowners and to limit the power of wealthy landlords and merchants. The government reduced taxes in times of poor harvest and provided relief after disasters. Tax remissions and crop seed loans encouraged displaced peasants {{to return to their}} land. An edict in 94 AD excused displaced peasants from paying land and labor service taxes for a year upon returning to their own farms. The land tax on agricultural production was reduced in 168 BC from a rate of one-fifteenth of crop yield to one-thirtieth, and abolished in 167 BC. However, the <b>tax</b> <b>was</b> reinstated in 156 BC at a rate of one-thirtieth. At the beginning of the Eastern Han, the land tax rate was one-tenth of the crop yield, but following the stabilization following Wang Mang's death, the rate was reduced to the original one-thirtieth in 30 AD.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge began reforms {{immediately}} and zealously. He secured the General Assembly's {{passage of a}} two-cent property tax for education. The <b>tax</b> <b>was</b> subject to voter approval, and Breckinridge worked hard to publicize the issue. His efforts paid off, as the tax passed by almost a two-to-one margin. Continuing to publicize needs and push legislators to action, Breckinridge enjoyed the support of {{five of the six}} governors under whom he served. Only John L. Helm, who opposed a state-funded school system, challenged him, but Helm's veto of a Breckinridge educational bill was overridden in the General Assembly. Breckinridge's reforms manifested tangible results. From 1847 to 1850, educational spending increased from $6,000 to $144,000. By 1850, only one out of every ten school age children did not attend school.|$|E
5|$|By 1901 {{there were}} so few rubber plants left in the {{concession}} that the Free State authorities granted permission for the villagers to cut down the remaining plants and grind their bark to retrieve the rubber. Once this process was completed the rubber <b>tax</b> <b>was</b> abolished. The Abir company merged with the Société Anversoise in May 1911 to form the Compagnie du Congo Belge and now focussed on the management of rubber plantations and the gathering of rubber from them. However, later that year it agreed with the Belgian government {{to reduce the size}} of its operations and its monopoly status. In July 1911 it was banned from collecting rubber within the confines of its old concession for 18 months and was subject to new laws introduced by the Free State. The later history of the company is unknown but it continued to operate until at least 1926 when it split off its oil palm concessions into the Maringa company.|$|E
50|$|Generally, where foreign <b>taxes</b> have <b>been</b> deducted or deemed {{deducted from}} income, and a credit or {{reduction}} of <b>tax</b> <b>is</b> claimed, {{the amount of}} income subject to <b>tax</b> <b>is</b> the amount before the reduction by foreign tax.|$|R
