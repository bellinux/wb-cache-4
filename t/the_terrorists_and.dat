Al Ahmadi reneges on the deal, however, and tells them to kill the hostages. At the same time, journalist Tom Hammerschmidt (Boris McGiver) publishes an investigative news story detailing Frank's crimes. Claire gives Frank the idea to declare war on <b>the</b> <b>terrorists</b> <b>and</b> allow the public to see the hostage die in order to distract from the scandal and create an atmosphere of widespread fear that they can exploit. In the final scene, Claire finally breaks the fourth wall with Frank.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the relevance of 'switching costs' to the problem of terrorism and grassroots support of terrorism. Grassroots supporters that choose between <b>the</b> <b>terrorist</b> organisation <b>and</b> <b>the</b> government may face considerable costs in switching their support after their initial decision has been made. This paper presents an analysis of competition between <b>the</b> <b>terrorist</b> organisation <b>and</b> <b>the</b> government for grassroots support within a two-period economic setting. If grassroots supporters face costs, which may be either tangible or psychological costs, in switching to the government if they initially supported <b>the</b> <b>terrorist</b> organisation (<b>and</b> vice versa), economic theory produces results that have important policy implications. Of most importance, it can be shown that when grassroots supporters have switching costs there is more intense competition between <b>the</b> <b>terrorist</b> organisation <b>and</b> <b>the</b> government for grassroots support. Also, when grassroots supporters have switching costs, <b>the</b> <b>terrorist</b> organisation <b>and</b> <b>the</b> government must invoke more extreme measures in order to win supporters away from the other party. ...|$|R

25|$|Global Offensive, like prior {{games in}} the Counter-Strike series, is an objective-based, {{multiplayer}} first-person shooter. Two opposing teams, known as <b>the</b> <b>Terrorists</b> <b>and</b> the Counter Terrorists, compete in game modes to complete objectives, such as securing a location to plant or defuse a bomb and rescuing or guarding hostages.

Winning rounds results in more money than losing, and completing objectives such as killing enemy players gives cash bonuses. Uncooperative actions, such as killing teammates, results in a penalty.|$|E

25|$|At 12 noon, French Minister of Foreign Affairs Alain Juppé {{organised}} {{a crisis}} team, and Charles Pasqua, Interior Minister of France, met his aides. French Prime Minister Édouard Balladur was recalled from his Christmas vacation in Chamonix, France, {{and other government}} officials were recalled from their vacations. Balladur recalled spending his entire afternoon on the telephone, trying to determine {{what was happening and}} feeling confusion. According to Balladur, the Algerian authorities wanted to crack down on <b>the</b> <b>terrorists</b> <b>and</b> that Balladur encountered difficulties discussing the events. At one point, the hijackers dropped the demand for the release of the party leaders. Two hours after the hijacking began, the hijackers asked the captain to depart for Paris so the hijackers could hold a press conference there. The captain could not take off as the aircraft boarding stairs were still attached to the A300 and the Algerian authorities blocked the runway with parked vehicles. When the captain, forced by the hijackers, asked for the removal of the boarding stairs, the Algerian authorities, determined not to give in to any of the hijacker demands, refused. The hijackers announced that they would detonate the aircraft unless the Algerian authorities gave in to the demands.|$|E
500|$|In {{the days}} before the election, Underwood pushes Congress to {{formally}} declare war on ICO, and orders the CIA to kill one of <b>the</b> <b>terrorists</b> <b>and</b> make it look like he had died fleeing capture. Underwood still lags in the polls, however, and on election night it appears he is going to lose to Conway. With help from Stamper and campaign strategist LeAnn Harvey (Neve Campbell), Underwood has NSA contractor Aidan Macallan (Damian Young) stage a cyberattack on several election stations. He also uses the fear of a possible terrorist attack to pressure the governors of Tennessee and Ohio to halt voting. The tactics work; the two states refuse to declare a winner, and the election drags on unresolved for several weeks.|$|E

Thomson personally viewed [...] "Death on the Rock" [...] before making the final decision to permit its broadcast, with two alterations to the commentary. He later wrote that, [...] "paradoxically", the decision [...] "was not a difficult one. My colleagues and I saw no reason why the IBA should prevent Thames' journalists interviewing those who claimed to be eyewitnesses and investigating the affair as numerous other journalists had since the shootings, provided that the criminal record of <b>the</b> <b>terrorists</b> <b>and</b> the enormity of the outrage they planned was made clear and the legal position had been established to our satisfaction".
