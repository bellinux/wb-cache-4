5|$|The {{first was}} that the Paris Accord that ended the American {{commitment}} was seriously flawed at the outset, in that it permitted the North Vietnamese to maintain their forces within territorial South Vietnam after {{the signing of the}} agreement, thereby dooming <b>the</b> <b>cease-fire.</b>|$|E
5|$|Later, the United Nations Security Council issued {{resolution}} 248 which {{condemned the}} Israeli raid on Jordanian territory and {{the violation of}} <b>the</b> <b>cease-fire</b> line, it recalled on resolutions 237 which had encouraged Israel {{to ensure the safety}} of civilians in military areas. The resolution affirmed that reprisals were not to be tolerated and that repetitions of such violations would have forced the Security Council to take further steps.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>cease-fires</b> of 1994 {{marked the}} {{transition}} of Northern Ireland toward peace. Local media, public perception, and claims by "drug authorities" suggest an increase in drug use subsequent to <b>the</b> <b>cease-fires.</b> This article suggests that social problems in Northern Ireland must be understood {{in the context of}} wider political conflict and that the conflict affects all social phenomena. Therefore, the extent and patterning of drug use in young people in Northern Ireland are explored, linked to <b>the</b> major <b>cease-fires.</b> <b>The</b> historical influences of the key paramilitary groups are outlined in relation to their drug ideologies. Media and professional perceptions are examined alongside available evidence constructed from multiple indicators of drug use. Our review of the evidence suggests that it is incorrect to assume that most drug use has increased since <b>the</b> <b>cease-fires.</b> One notable exception to that general conclusion is that a heroin scene may be developing in Northern Ireland...|$|R
5000|$|By early October, {{there were}} no cigarettes. People were smoking grape leaves or tea. There was no yeast for bread. My son was eating tinned food with me and my wife. There was less and less of that. The {{shelling}} became 24 hours a day, and <b>the</b> <b>cease-fires</b> were worse. When people {{came out of the}} shelters to go to the well during <b>the</b> <b>cease-fires,</b> <b>the</b> snipers shot them. You can't keep children in for two months, and when they ran outside, when there was sun in the morning, they shot at them, too.|$|R
5000|$|Following <b>the</b> 1949 <b>cease-fire</b> {{agreement}} with India, {{the government of}} Pakistan divided the northern and western parts of Kashmir that it occupied at <b>the</b> time of <b>cease-fire</b> into <b>the</b> following two separately-controlled political entities: ...|$|R
5|$|On 21 February, Souvanna {{signed an}} Agreement on the Restoration of Peace and Reconciliation in Laos between the central {{government}} and the Pathet Lao. The agreement was preceded by intense fighting, as both sides attempted to seize as much territory as possible before <b>the</b> <b>cease-fire</b> went into effect. The agreement was moot, however, since Hanoi {{had no intention of}} removing its troops or abandoning its logistical system.|$|E
5|$|Regiment 95 survived Operation Camargue {{and resumed}} ambushes in 1954, {{as well as}} assaulting a Vietnamese {{garrison}} near Hué. The regiment remained in the area, taking part in General Giáp's 1954 campaign season, until Vietnam was split into North and South Vietnam by <b>the</b> <b>cease-fire,</b> whereupon it infiltrated back to the north along Route One during broad daylight, leaving small cells of guerillas in the area. The regiment returned to resume ambushes of the South Vietnamese Army in 1962.|$|E
5|$|Taking {{advantage}} of North Vietnam's period of recuperation in 1974, President Thiệu stretched his forces thin by launching offensives that retook {{most of the}} territory captured by PAVN forces during the land grab of 1973 and 15 {{percent of the total}} land area controlled by the communists at the time of <b>the</b> <b>cease-fire.</b> In April, Thiệu launched the Svay Rieng Campaign against communist strongholds in eastern Cambodia. This proved to be the last major offensive operation launched by the ARVN.|$|E
40|$|In {{the closing}} months of 1994, the {{principal}} paramilitary organizations in Northern Ireland declared that their campaigns of violence were at an end. <b>The</b> <b>cease-fires</b> called by republican and loyalist groupings represented {{the most significant}} heralds of a complex process of conflict transformation that continues to unfold even twenty years on. In this introduction, {{we set out to}} map the key developments that have shaped the tortuous narrative of the Northern Irish ‘peace process’, thereby providing the historical backdrop for the articles that follow. While remarkable progress has been made over the two decades since <b>the</b> paramilitary <b>cease-fires,</b> <b>the</b> political context and future of the region remain rather more fraught than is often assumed abroad. It is perhaps best, then, to speak of the six counties in terms not of resolution but rather of ambiguity. Twenty years on from the optimism that greeted <b>the</b> paramilitary <b>cease-fires,</b> Northern Ireland retains the essential ‘inbetweenness’ of a political space that has moved from a ‘long war’ through a ‘long peace’ and into a profoundly undecided future...|$|R
25|$|Despite {{the peace}} {{agreements}} with Egypt and Jordan, interim peace accords with Palestine and <b>the</b> generally existing <b>cease-fire,</b> <b>the</b> Arab world and Israel remain {{at odds with}} each other over many issues.|$|R
25|$|As of December 21, 2006, over 60 Qassams {{have hit}} Israel since <b>the</b> {{declared}} <b>cease-fire</b> on November 26.|$|R
5|$|The International Control Commission, {{in order}} to avoid a major {{escalation}} of the armed conflicts with disastrous results, decided to intervene. On May 6, Zografos received a communication to initiate negotiations on a new basis. Zografos accepted the proposal and an armistice was ordered the next day. By the time <b>the</b> <b>cease-fire</b> order was received, the Epirote forces had secured the Morava heights near Korçë, making the city's Albanian garrison's surrender imminent.|$|E
5|$|At 18:00 on 29 January 1968, South Vietnamese forces began a 36-hour ceasefire {{in celebration}} of {{the arrival of the}} Year of the Monkey. Earlier, the communists had {{declared}} a seven-day ceasefire as part of the Tet festival, that was normally a period of truce and for community gatherings and family reunions in Vietnamese society. However, unbeknown to the South Vietnamese and their allies, the North Vietnamese leadership had decided to use <b>the</b> <b>cease-fire</b> to launch a large offensive in the south in order to break the deadlock that had developed in the conflict—despite the reluctance of Democratic Republic of Vietnam President Ho Chi Minh and Defence Minister General Vo Nguyen Giap.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>cease-fire</b> {{agreement}} {{also provided}} for the evacuation of the JNA Zadar garrison. The evacuation, encompassing six barracks and 3,750 people, began on 11 October and took 15 days to complete. The JNA removed 2,1902,250 truckloads of weapons and equipment and the personal effects of JNA personnel and their families. Evacuated personnel and equipment were required {{to be removed from}} Croatian soil; the JNA complied, except for its artillery (which was primarily left for the SAO Krajina TO). The JNA also transferred 20 truckloads of weapons to the SAO Krajina TO in the area. On 18 October, the ZNG Independent BenkovacStaknovci Battalion merged with the 1st Battalion of the 112th Brigade to create the 134th Infantry Brigade.|$|E
5000|$|The Bahá'ís {{were noted}} as making {{a small but}} {{significant}} contribution during the conflict in Northern Ireland. During the Opsahl Commission before <b>the</b> <b>cease-fires</b> twelve Bahá'í groups or individuals made submissions. Bahá'í women {{have been involved with}} women's organisations that were primarily concerned with anything to do with women and children. As Bahá'ís they also talked about peace in the global sense, hoping that [...] "some of this has filtered through".|$|R
5000|$|U-2511 {{conducted}} one patrol. On {{the evening}} of 30 April 1945 (coincidentally the date of Hitler's death), U-2511 set out from Bergen, Norway for the Caribbean, but on 4 May Schnee received <b>the</b> end-of-the-war <b>cease-fire</b> order. [...] <b>The</b> commander of U-2511 claimed the U-boat had a British cruiser in her sights on 4 May when news of <b>the</b> German <b>cease-fire</b> was received. He further claimed she made a practice attack before leaving the scene undetected.|$|R
50|$|After <b>the</b> 1991 <b>cease-fire</b> between Morocco and the Polisario Front, the United Nations' MINURSO has {{occasionally}} sheltered {{some of its}} {{personnel at}} the fort.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>cease-fire</b> {{went into}} effect on 22 February 1973. Not all of the fighting, however, had ended. This was {{particularly}} true around the town of Paksong, the last Royal Laotian stronghold on the Bolovens Plateau – the strategic high ground overlooking the Mekong River. At the request of Souvanna, nine B-52s and 12 U.S tactical fighters struck {{the outskirts of the}} town on 24 February. By mid-month, the bombers had flown 1,417 sorties and struck 286 targets in northern Laos. Once again acceding to a request from Souvanna, B-52s returned for two more days of bombing on 16 and 17 April, dropping ordnance in support of government forces under attack around Ban Tha Vieng on the Plain of Jars.|$|E
5|$|The {{refusal of}} the United States {{government}} to take promised military action {{in the face of}} North Vietnamese violations of <b>the</b> <b>cease-fire</b> is also examined as a key to the defeat. Adherents to this claim believed that South Vietnam could have been saved by another U.S. bombing campaign. The conflict between the executive and legislative branches of the American government, already severe before the onset of the Operation Linebacker II in 1972, was only more exasperating during 1975, when a new campaign would probably only have provoked even more Congressional outrage.|$|E
5|$|The {{seizure of}} {{territory}} within South Vietnam itself allowed Hanoi {{to extend the}} trail across the border with Laos and into that country. The signing of the Paris Peace Accords seemed to bring the conflict in Southeast Asia to an end. The last U.S. forces departed in March 1973. Both North and South Vietnamese were to maintain control in the areas under their influence and negotiations between the two nations, possibly leading to a coalition government and unification, were to take place. Jockying for control of more territory, both sides flagrantly violated <b>the</b> <b>cease-fire</b> and open hostilities began anew.|$|E
25|$|Additional {{justifications}} used {{at various}} times included Iraqi violation of UN resolutions, the Iraqi government's repression of its citizens, and Iraqi violations of <b>the</b> 1991 <b>cease-fire.</b>|$|R
50|$|Narayanpur is a hamlet in Jammu {{district}} {{in the state of}} Jammu & Kashmir, India. It is located less than a kilometer north of <b>the</b> India-Pakistan <b>cease-fire</b> line.|$|R
25|$|In {{the first}} {{large-scale}} violation of <b>the</b> U.N.-brokered <b>cease-fire</b> between <b>the</b> sides, Israeli raided a Hezbollah stronghold deep inside Lebanon, {{that led to}} the killing of one their soldiers.|$|R
5|$|After the Six-Day War in 1967, the PLO {{moved their}} bases to Jordan and stepped up their guerrilla attacks against Israel, taking the border town of Karameh as their headquarters. The IDF {{claimed that the}} purpose was to destroy the PLO militant camps at Karameh and capture Yasser Arafat as reprisal, however, it is also {{believed}} that it wanted to punish Jordan for its perceived support to Palestinian fighters (fedayeen, meaning self-sacrificers). Israel assumed the Jordanian Army would choose to not get involved in the battle, but the latter deployed heavy artillery fire. The Israelis withdrew, or were repulsed, after a day-long battle, having destroyed most of the Karameh camp and taken around 140 PLO members prisoner. The battle resulted in the issuance of the United Nations Security Council Resolution 248, which unanimously condemned Israel for violating <b>the</b> <b>cease-fire</b> line and its disproportionate use of force.|$|E
5|$|Captain Brown was court-martialed as {{a result}} of the incident, pleaded guilty, and was {{relieved}} of command of Missouri. As a result of his plea, he suffered the loss of 250 places on the list of captains awaiting ships. Four others were court-martialed, two were cleared of all charges, one received a letter of reprimand, and one was reduced on the promotion list. Despite these setbacks, Missouri was repaired and returned to fleet. She stayed in commission throughout the Korean War, and—after <b>the</b> <b>cease-fire</b> agreement—was decommissioned into the United States Navy reserve fleets, where she remained until the 1980s. Despite proof to the contrary, rumors continue to circulate that Missouri suffered permanent damage {{as a result}} of the grounding incident.|$|E
5|$|During <b>the</b> <b>cease-fire,</b> {{the abbey}} offers shelter to {{refugees}} fleeing the regions affected by fallout, {{which results in}} a battle of wills over euthanasia between the abbot and a doctor from a government emergency response camp. The war resumes, and a nuclear explosion occurs near the abbey. Abbot Zerchi tries to flee to safety, bringing with him the abbey's ciborium containing consecrated hosts, {{but it is too}} late. He is trapped by the falling walls of the abbey, and finds himself lying under tons of rock and bones as the abbey's ancient crypts disgorge their contents. Among them is a skull with an arrow's shaft protruding from its forehead (presumably that of Brother Francis Gerard from the first section of the book).|$|E
50|$|After <b>the</b> 1991 <b>cease-fire</b> after Operation Desert Storm, {{the base}} was officially {{transferred}} to the Iraqi Ministry of Agriculture. The Al-Baraj plant at Khan Bani Saad produces alcoholic drinks.|$|R

50|$|Task Force 78 was the fleet's {{minesweeper}} support. After <b>the</b> 1973 <b>cease-fire,</b> it {{was responsible}} for Operation End Sweep, removing naval mines dropped in Haiphong harbor only months earlier.|$|R
5|$|In 1990, the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), a rebel group {{composed}} of nearly 500,000 Tutsi refugees, invaded northern Rwanda from their base in Uganda, initiating the Rwandan Civil War. The group condemned the Hutu-dominated government {{for failing to}} democratize and confront the problems facing these refugees. Neither side was able to gain a decisive advantage in the war, but by 1992 it had weakened Habyarimana's authority; mass demonstrations forced him into a coalition with the domestic opposition and eventually to sign the 1993 Arusha Accords with the RPF. <b>The</b> <b>cease-fire</b> ended on 6 April 1994 when Habyarimana's plane was shot down near Kigali Airport, killing him. The shooting down of the plane served as the catalyst for the Rwandan Genocide, which began within a few hours. Over the course of approximately 100 days, between 500,000 and 1,000,000 Tutsi and politically moderate Hutu were killed in well-planned attacks on the orders of the interim government. Many Twa were also killed, despite not being directly targeted.|$|E
5|$|On 23 June 1940, I. Gruppe {{was moved}} to a forward {{airfield}} at Grandvilliers in preparation for missions over the Channel Coast, but the following day, all Bf109s were sent to Wiesbaden, via Brussels, for a thorough maintenance check. The overhaul detachment arrived in Wiesbaden {{in the late afternoon}} and the pilots were sent on home leave. <b>The</b> <b>cease-fire</b> of the Armistice of 22 June 1940 went into effect on 25 June 1940, ending the Battle of France. During the French campaign, Lützow flew 64 combat missions and claimed nine victories. Under his leadership, I. Gruppe {{was one of the most}} successful units in this campaign. It was credited with 88 aerial victories for the loss of six pilots killed and ten Bf109s destroyed.|$|E
5|$|The JNA 9th (Knin) Corps had {{completed}} {{a significant part}} of its assigned task before the overall offensive against Croatian forces began {{in the second half of}} September by capturing the Maslenica Bridge, which blocked the Adriatic Highway and almost-completely isolated Dalmatia from the rest of Croatia. This isolation was reinforced by the Yugoslav Navy blockade, which lasted until 13 October. However, <b>the</b> <b>cease-fire</b> agreement ended the JNA siege and a supply route to Zadar was opened via the Pag Island road. The JNA remained on the outskirts of the city, threatening the ZNG defences. Although the ZNG and the police could not withstand the JNA forces (supported by artillery and armour), they held Zadar; the city celebrates its defence on 6 October each year.|$|E
