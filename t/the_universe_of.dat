5|$|A common idea in {{the comics}} is that Bruce saw a Zorro film with his parents before they were murdered. Nolan {{explained}} that by ignoring that idea – which he stated is not found in Batman's first appearances – it {{emphasized the importance of}} bats to Bruce and that becoming a superhero is a wholly original idea on his part. It is for this reason Nolan believes other DC characters do not exist in <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> <b>of</b> his film; otherwise, Wayne's reasons for taking up costumed vigilantism would have been very different.|$|E
5|$|Blood-C: The Last Dark is set {{six months}} after the events of Blood-C; in <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> <b>of</b> Blood-C {{humanity}} is secretly preyed upon by a race called the Elder Bairns, whose feeding is kept under control by an ancient agreement called Shrovetide. The Last Dark follows Saya Kisaragi as she pursues Fumito Nanahara—the human guardian of Shrovetide who manipulated and betrayed her—through Tokyo {{with the help of an}} underground organization called SIRRUT.|$|E

5|$|In 2013, Kamiya {{revealed}} {{that he would like}} to have an opportunity to continue PlatinumGames' partnership with Nintendo, creating new properties or working on extending <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> <b>of</b> their existing franchises such as the Star Fox. Shigeru Miyamoto who produced Star Fox Zero expressed his desire to work with external developers so that the project can have a shorter development cycle. The team was asked to serve as the game's co-developer after Nintendo saw the Arwing stage of Bayonetta 2. Zero, along with its spin-off tower defense game Star Fox Guard, was released in April 2016 to mixed critical reviews. By the end of March 2016, Minami stepped down from his position as president and CEO, with executive producer Kenichi Sato succeeded him.|$|E
5|$|Interest in {{creating}} a sequel to Tron arose after the film garnered a cult following. After much speculation, Walt Disney Pictures began a concerted effort in 2005 to devise Tron: Legacy, with the hiring of Klugman and Sternthal as writers. Kosinski was recruited as director two years later. As he was not optimistic about Disney's Matrix-esque approach to the film, Kosinski filmed a high-concept, which he used to conceptualise <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> <b>of</b> Tron: Legacy and convince the studio to greenlight the film. Principal photography took place in Vancouver over 67 days, {{in and around the}} city's central business district. Most sequences were shot in 3D and ten companies were involved with the extensive visual effects work. Chroma keying and other techniques were used to allow more freedom {{in creating}} effects. Daft Punk composed the musical score, incorporating orchestral sounds with their trademark electronic music.|$|E

40|$|In communication, {{the members}} of a family are not always able to get their {{messages}} across, and this may cause some conflicts in the family. To get their messages across, {{the members of}} a family need to pay attention to some strategies in communication including the strategies in maintaining <b>the</b> same <b>universe</b> <b>of</b> discourse. <b>Universe</b> <b>of</b> discourse means <b>the</b> particular world (real or imaginary) that the speaker assumes to say at that particular time. In American Beauty, the writer notices that the participants have a lot of conflicts, and it triggers the writer to investigate the film. Moreover, this film projects many themes that occur in this modem life, and this film seems trying to warn people about their own lives that could be like the film. In her study, the writer wants to find out whether the participants in conversations among the members of the families in American Beauty share <b>the</b> same <b>universe</b> <b>of</b> discourse or not, and what the strategies that they use if they share <b>the</b> same <b>universe</b> <b>of</b> discourse. She also wants to find out if there is participant who pretends to share <b>the</b> same <b>universe</b> <b>of</b> discourse. <b>The</b> writer only analyzes the conversations that happen among the members of the two families in American Beauty. Here, the writer finds that the participants mostly do not share <b>the</b> same <b>universe</b> <b>of</b> discourse. However, there are also few times when the participants are sharing <b>the</b> same <b>universe</b> <b>of</b> discourse. <b>The</b> three strategies that are used by the participants in sharing <b>the</b> same <b>universe</b> <b>of</b> discourse are <b>the</b> spatial frames of reference strategy in anchoring in the perspective of the speaker, shared domains and coreference strategy and new information strategy. She finds that the participants mostly use the shared domains and coreference strategy. Furthermore, she finds out that there is a participant who is pretending to share <b>the</b> same <b>universe</b> <b>of</b> discourse but actually not sharing <b>the</b> same <b>universe</b> <b>of</b> discourse with <b>the</b> other participant. The writer concludes that the participants mostly do not share <b>the</b> same <b>universe</b> <b>of</b> discourse although <b>the</b> participants in conversations among the members of the families in American Beauty come from the same world because they have different ideas, feelings and interests...|$|R

5|$|Rubidium-87 has a {{half-life}} of years, {{which is}} {{more than three times the}} age of <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> <b>of</b> years, making it a primordial nuclide. It readily substitutes for potassium in minerals, and is therefore fairly widespread. Rb has been used extensively in dating rocks; 87Rb beta decays to stable 87Sr. During fractional crystallization, Sr tends to concentrate in plagioclase, leaving Rb in the liquid phase. Hence, the Rb/Sr ratio in residual magma may increase over time, and the progressing differentiation results in rocks with elevated Rb/Sr ratios. The highest ratios (10 or more) occur in pegmatites. If the initial amount of Sr is known or can be extrapolated, then the age can be determined by measurement of the Rb and Sr concentrations and of the 87Sr/86Sr ratio. The dates indicate the true age of the minerals only if the rocks have not been subsequently altered (see rubidium–strontium dating).|$|E
5|$|The Machination {{performs}} a successful surgery on Hunter, and Ironhide is seemingly {{killed in an}} explosion set up by them. They now begin to manufacture their own army of Sunstreaker bodies. Shockwave and the Dynobots are excavated up by archaeologists in Eureka, Nevada and Skywatch takes over the area. In Oregon, two young humans wonder whether to buy Soundwave, still trapped in cassette player mode. Megatron calls Sixshot to come and speed up Earth's destruction, and the Reapers follow, eager to have Sixshot join their attempt to rid <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> <b>of</b> war-like species. Elsewhere on Earth, Ramjet's grandiose plans for a coup against Megatron fail when the Decepticon leader kills him in one-on-one combat.|$|E
5|$|The {{book has}} often been {{described}} as a Bildungsroman or coming of age story, as it explores Ged's process of learning to cope with power and come to terms with death. The novel also carries Taoist themes about a fundamental balance in <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> <b>of</b> Earthsea, which wizards are supposed to maintain, closely tied to the idea that language and names have power to affect the material world and alter this balance. Although the structure of the story {{is similar to that of}} a traditional epic, critics have also described it as subverting this genre in many ways, such as by making the protagonist dark-skinned, in comparison to more typical white-skinned heroes.|$|E

Players navigate their surroundings by dragging their cursor across the screen. Players navigate different worlds, defeating monsters known as the Heartless. The base game is free to play, with optional microtransactions. Actions use up AP, which can be replenished by either waiting or by using potions, which can be earned or bought. Rare items such as special cards can also be purchased. Alongside the single-player mode, there is a multiplayer mode where teams of players take on Raid Bosses, gigantic Heartless with high HP.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>universe</b> <b>of</b> the Drakengard {{series is}} split between {{multiple}} timelines. Events in those timelines are separate, {{but they can}} overlap. The core timeline is formed from Drakengard and its sequel. Drakengard 3 acts as the first game's prequel, but most of its events take place in separate timelines leading to different outcomes. In Drakengard 3, a malevolent flower uses servants called the Intoners, women gifted {{with the power to}} use magic through song, as instruments of humanity's destruction. In Drakengard, which succeeds the fifth version of Drakengard 3s events detailed in a supplementary novel, the Watchers use a group known as the Cult of Watchers to spark a religious war and destroy the seals. In Drakengard 2, the Watchers continue to use {{the former head of the}} cult to destroy the new seals, while the dragons prepare to usurp the gods and rule over the world. Nier is set in an alternative reality created by events stemming from Drakengards fifth ending: in this reality, our modern world was decimated by a plague created by the magical beings who came through the portal, bringing humanity to the brink of extinction. Nier: Automata takes place after the fourth ending of Nier, featuring appearances and mentions of characters from both Nier and the Drakengard games.|$|E
