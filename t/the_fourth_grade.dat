5|$|Pattillo Higgins {{was born}} to Roberto James and Sarah (Raye) Higgins on December 5, 1863, in Sabine Pass, Texas. His family moved to Beaumont when he was six years old. He {{attended}} school until he reached <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>grade,</b> after which he apprenticed as a gunsmith under his father’s direction. In his youth, he was a violent troublemaker, pulling pranks and harassing African Americans. When he was seventeen, he pulled a prank on a black Baptist church that got {{the attention of a}} sheriff deputy. The deputy fired a warning shot over Higgins' head, after which Higgins fired back and delivered what would later {{turn out to be a}} fatal hit. The wounded deputy managed to fire again, striking Higgins lower left arm. Higgins' arm would later become severely infected, requiring amputation from the elbow down. Higgins was put on trial for the murder of the deputy, but he would be found not guilty by a jury that perceived his act as self-defense. After his acquittal, he worked as a logger along the Texas-Louisiana border, apparently unhindered by his lack of an arm. It was in 1885 that he attended a Baptist revival meeting where he made the decision to become a Christian. Realizing that the lumber camps were not the ideal place to maintain a good morality, he decided to return to Beaumont, Texas to establish himself as a businessman.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to measure the {{academic}} performance of children with mild hearing loss (20 - 45 dB) by comparing them with a normal control group. Twenty-four pairs of children in <b>the</b> first through <b>fourth</b> <b>grades</b> were compared. <b>The</b> achievement scores of <b>the</b> second and <b>fourth</b> <b>grade</b> student pairs were compared for the current academic year and for the previous academic year.

The results indicated statistical significance on some subtests of <b>the</b> first and <b>fourth</b> <b>grade</b> student 2 ̆ 7 s scores. The standard mean scores of the hearing impaired group was almost always poorer than the normal control group in every grade. The interaction between the two groups in <b>the</b> second and <b>fourth</b> <b>grade</b> showed no significance statistically. The improvement in scores between the two years for the two groups was relatively parallel, however, the hearing impaired group 2 ̆ 7 s improvement was usually poorer in most of the subtests. The discussion includes the implications of these results indicating a negative effect of mild hearing loss particularly as the hearing impaired child gets older.

40|$|This study {{explored}} {{the topic of}} motivation for intermediate students combining both an objective criterion measure (i. e., standardized test scores) and the self-report of students on self-concept and value of reading. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine how third grade reading achievement correlated with <b>the</b> motivation of <b>fourth</b> <b>grade</b> boys and girls, and, in turn, how motivation related to <b>fourth</b> <b>grade</b> reading achievement. ^ <b>The</b> participants were <b>fourth</b> <b>grade</b> students (n= 207) attending two public, elementary schools in Miami-Dade County who were of primarily Hispanic origin or descent. Data were collected using the Reading Survey portion of the Motivation to Read Profile (1996) which measures self-concept and value of reading in order to measure motivation and <b>the</b> Third and <b>Fourth</b> <b>Grade</b> Reading Florida Comprehensive Assessment Tests 2. 0 (FCAT 2. 0) to assess achievement. First, a one way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was conducted to determine whether motivation differed significantly between <b>fourth</b> <b>grade</b> boys and girls. Second, a path analysis was used to determine whether motivation mediated or moderated the association between FCAT 2. 0 third and <b>fourth</b> <b>grade</b> scores. ^ Results of the ANOVA indicated that motivation, as measured by the Motivation to Read Profile did not differ significantly by sex. Results from the path analysis indicated that the model was significant and that third grade FCAT 2. 0 scores accounted for a significant amount of <b>the</b> variance in <b>fourth</b> <b>grade</b> FCAT 2. 0 scores once motivation was entered. Results of the study demonstrated that motivation partially mediates, but does not moderate the relationship between FCAT 2. 0 third and <b>fourth</b> <b>grade</b> scores. ^ In conclusion, it can be determined that past student achievement for <b>fourth</b> <b>grade</b> students plays a role in current student achievement when motivation is also considered. It is therefore important in order to improve <b>the</b> quality of <b>fourth</b> <b>grade</b> student 2 ̆ 7 s current performance to take into account a student 2 ̆ 7 s motivation and past achievement. An effort must be made to address students 2 ̆ 7 motivational needs whether through school wide programs or at the classroom level in addition or in conjunction with cognition. Future research on the effect of self-concept in reading achievement is recommended. ...|$|R
