40|$|Abstract: Growth, {{photosynthesis}} and the {{nitrate reductase}} activity of Ulva pertusa were determined at fluctuating salinity treatments. Compared with the control, SGR of Ulva pertusa were higher at fluctuating salinity treatments. The photosynthetic rates were higher at the fluctuating salinity <b>treatments</b> <b>of</b> 30 - 25 and 30 - 20, and lower at the fluctuating salinity <b>treatments</b> <b>of</b> 30 - 15. Ulva pertusa got higher nitrate reductase activity at fluctuating salinity <b>treatments</b> <b>of</b> 30 - 20 and 30 - 15. It demonstrated that Ulva pertusa {{was able to}} change the photosynthetic rates and the nitrate reductase activities to adapt to salinity fluctuations...|$|R
