Characterization of <b>top</b> <b>surface</b> and {{microstructure}} of silicide coatings obtained during {{diffusion process}} of pack cementation type and laser remelting treatments is showed in this article.

In first step the phase compositions of coatings analyzed by XRD in initial condition and after remelting process. The morphology of the coatings <b>top</b> <b>surface</b> was described as well. All types of coatings were characterized by network of cracks on <b>top</b> <b>surface</b> of the coatings.

40|$|Purpose – Obtaining the {{required}} part <b>top</b> <b>surface</b> roughness and side roughness {{is critical in}} some applications. Each of these part properties can often be improved {{to the detriment of}} the other during selective laser melting (SLM). The purpose of this paper is to investigate the selective laser melting of Inconel 625 using an Nd:YAG pulsed laser to produce thin wall parts with an emphasis on attaining parts with minimum <b>top</b> <b>surface</b> and side surface roughness. Design/methodology/approach – A full factorial approach was used to vary process parameters and identify a usable Inconel 625 processing region. The effects laser process parameters had on the formation of part surface roughness for multi-layer parts were examined. Processing parameters that specifically affected <b>top</b> <b>surface</b> and side roughness were identified. Findings – Higher peak powers tended to reduce <b>top</b> <b>surface</b> roughness and reduce side roughness as recoil pressures flatten out the melt pool and reduce balling formation by increasing wettability of the melt. Increased repetition rate and reduced scan speed reduced <b>top</b> <b>surface</b> roughness but increased side roughness. A compromise between attaining a relatively low surface roughness and side roughness can be attained by comparing part surface roughness values and understanding the factors that affect them. A sample with 9 mm <b>top</b> <b>surface</b> roughness and 10 mm side roughness was produced. Originality/value – The research is the first of its kind directly processing Inconel 625 using SLM and investigating processing parameters that affect <b>top</b> <b>surface</b> and side roughness simultaneously. It is a useful aid in unveiling a relationship between process parameters and top/side roughness of thin walled parts...|$|R

A solution containing an electrolyte, at least one bonding material, and positive and negative ions is applied over the <b>top</b> <b>surface</b> of the semiconductor.

30|$|Combining Figs.  3 and 4 with Fig.  2, we can {{conclude}} {{that there is an}} alternating convex-concave curling deformation at the four corners and the track center. The reason for this phenomenon is that the poor thermal conductivity of mortar causes a temperature gradient in the vertical direction of track slab. When the temperature at the <b>top</b> <b>surface</b> is higher than that at the bottom surface, tensile stress occurs at the bottom surface and induces downward curling of the four corners; when the temperature at the <b>top</b> <b>surface</b> is lower than that at the bottom surface, there will be tensile stress at the <b>top</b> <b>surface</b> and four corners will curl upward.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{heat loss}} and surface {{temperature}} of the <b>top</b> <b>surface</b> and sidewall of large-scale floating roof tank is tested by the heat flow meter and surface temperature method. Based on the test data, the heat loss from the <b>top</b> <b>surface</b> is about twice more {{than that of the}} sidewall which means the <b>top</b> <b>surface</b> is the weakest insulation part of the floating roof tank. On the surface, the heat loss profile is in accord with the surface temperature distribution. Special attention is given on the calculation of thermal conductivity for the <b>top</b> <b>surface</b> and sidewall which finally deduced the total heat transfer coeffi-cient of large floating roof tank. Moreover, the heat loss of floating roof tank in different working conditions is predicted. According to the calculation results, the level of 6 m is regarded as a critical level determining the heat loss.

40|$|Abstract: Because of {{the smaller}} {{cross-sectional}} area, the flexural properties often become the controlling factor in PHC pile. Φ 500 PHC is widely used as an engineering design pile in the Yangtze River Delta region. On {{the basis of the}} analysis of pile soil interaction mechanism, the single Pile under different conditions is discussed. The parameters are discussed in this article are PHC pile’s wall thickness, horizontal loads, bending moments, pile elastic modulus and other engineering parameters. The studies show that, the distribution of bending moment and shear is significant in 2 ~ 4 m below the <b>top</b> <b>surface</b> of the pile, and after 6 m, the value of them closes to 0. The main sphere of influence of the single pile bending moment and shear is concentrated at 3 ~ 4 m below the <b>top</b> <b>surface</b> of the pile. Along with horizontal load enlargement, the maximum bending moment is mainly concentrated at 1. 5 m below the <b>top</b> <b>surface</b> of the pile, and the maximum pile shear is mainly concentrated at 1. 9 m below the <b>top</b> <b>surface</b> of the pile.
