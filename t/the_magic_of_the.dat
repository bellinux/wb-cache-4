25|$|While {{powerful}} in production form, the Buick 455 (including Stage 1) engines had problematic engine blocks.

25|$|Rydberg's next work, Medeltidens Magi (<b>The</b> <b>Magic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Middle Ages) 1865 is an {{exposition}} of the magical practices {{and beliefs of}} the Medieval period. According to Rydberg, the contemporary Church was still driven by {{the ideology of the}} Dark Ages, and its dualistic notions of good and evil, represented by God and the Devil, Heaven and Hell, contributed towards the horror of the witch-hunts in Europe and America in the recent past. From this point forward, Rydberg was economically successful as a writer.|$|E

This was followed in 1993 by a North American and Canadian tour and numerous UK versions in the following years, in which Rattray was succeeded by Dave Willetts, Robert Meadmore and most recently Wayne Sleep.

Wonder Woman takes Supergirl to Metropolis, and openly challenges Batman's plan. When she comes close to killing Cheetah and Harley Quinn, Supergirl stops her and heads to the Fortress of Solitude to confront Superman on the matter, learning the truth of her cousin's tyranny. With several of Earth's cities abducted, Brainiac prepares to eradicate the planet. The alliance attempts to take on Brainiac's ship, but his shields are too strong and he seemingly kills Superman in the process. They concoct a plan to weaken Brainiac's shields by using Aquaman's trident as a conduit for <b>the</b> <b>magic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rock of Eternity.|$|E
25|$|In the {{background}} of the series, the Children of the Forest fought a series of wars against the First Men (a civilization of primitive warriors wielding bronze weapons and riding horses), until the Pact of the Isle of Faces, wherein the First Men obtained control of the open lands and the Children that of the forests. The Pact was weakened after four thousand years by the emergence of the Others, who were vanquished by the combined use of obsidian, fire, <b>the</b> <b>magic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old gods, and the building of the Wall. In the following centuries the Children gradually disappeared, and it was presumed that they left Westeros or became extinct. Little of their legacy is present in the series beyond their worship of nameless gods, still practiced by some in the North, and the remaining Weirwoods through which the Children communicated telepathically.|$|E
25|$|The {{university}} again {{looked to}} its past to reverse its fortunes {{and brought back}} Johnny Majors, who had recently resigned from Tennessee after a successful 16-year tenure there. However, recruiting had fallen off significantly under Hackett, {{and the quality of}} Pitt's football facilities had fallen behind those of its competition. Over the next four years, Majors tried to recreate <b>the</b> <b>magic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1976 season but achieved little success. His final campaign in 1996 resulted in a 4–7 record which included several humiliating defeats. A new chancellor, Mark Nordenberg, brought in athletic director Steve Pederson in 1996 to resurrect the program. The move facilitated Majors' retirement from coaching following the 1996 season, although he continued to serve the university in the position of Special Assistant to the Athletic Director and Chancellor until the summer of 2007.|$|E
