25|$|Cheuk Man Lai Jackie and {{her family}} – Lai is a 26-year-old woman. She started off as a {{controversial}} chain-smoking model, with a violent husband who she had no more feelings with. However, she continued to respect her husband's father and tried to conceal the details about her affair with Yat. After her divorce with her husband, she entered the Tong family, but very few people accepted her, including Hau. After the realisation of her mistakes, Hau accepts her. After she is accepted into the family and through thorough teachings from Hau, she matures to become a woman who loves the Tong family greatly and <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>thankful</b> all that she has in life. Lai's family, in return, is a complete contrast to her. As extremely greedy people, they use the Tong family as a bank, and took $5,000,000 HKD in one visit to fund the restaurant that Hau offered them {{as a gift for}} Yat and Lai's marriage. Lai's family ultimately combine with Kam and Duk's plot to obtain a share of the Tong assets. They are hated by the Tong's including Lai herself. They never regret their mistakes, even by the end. Tong Sum is the baby girl born to Jackie and Gilbert.|$|E
25|$|While with Wordsworth, Coleridge {{was able}} to read the poem and provide his {{response}} to the ode's question within an early draft of his poem, Dejection: an Ode. Coleridge's answer was to claim that the glory was the soul and it is a subjective answer to the question. Wordsworth took a different path as he sought to answer the poem, which was to declare that childhood contained the remnants of a beatific state and that being able to experience the beauty that remained later was something <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>thankful</b> for. The difference between the two could be attributed to the differences in the poets' childhood experiences; Coleridge suffered from various pain in his youth whereas Wordsworth's was far more pleasant. It is possible that Coleridge's earlier poem, The Mad Monk (1800) influenced the opening of the ode and that discussions between Dorothy and Wordsworth about Coleridge's childhood and painful life were influences on the crafting of the opening stanza of the poem. However, the message in the ode, as with Tintern Abbey, describes the pain and suffering of life as able to dull the memory of early joy from nature but it is unable to completely destroy it. The suffering leads Wordsworth to recognise what is soothing in nature, and he credits the pain as leading to a philosophical understanding of the world.|$|E

500|$|The {{family moved}} to the suburb of Juhu when Kapoor was one month old. She was educated at the Arya Vidya Mandir school in Juhu, where she confessed to being a [...] "naughty" [...] and [...] "carefree" [...] child who would bully the boys. She excelled at sports such as rugby and basketball, and trained in Kathak, {{classical}} music and Latin dance. Kapoor, who practices Hinduism, states that she is [...] "quite religious", {{and that it is}} a way of [...] "reminding myself that I need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>thankful</b> for so much".|$|E
500|$|Bolton had the {{majority}} of possession in the second half, aside from a ten-minute spell, but {{the performance of the}} Manchester City defence limited Bolton's goalscoring opportunities. The Manchester Evening News singled out Herbert Burgess for particular praise in this respect, writing that City had [...] "considerable reason <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>thankful</b> to their left-back, Burgess.....the famous International played a game which has rarely been surpassed". The Bolton Evening News took a rather different view, claiming that physical play by Burgess provoked the ire of the crowd. Bolton's adoption of [...] "kick and rush" [...] tactics resulted in a spell of pressure, but to no avail. Bolton's best chance came in the final five minutes, a shot by White which [...] "missed by inches". The match finished 1–0, giving Manchester City their first major honour.|$|E
500|$|Since 1994, Hewson {{has been}} a patron of Chernobyl Children's Project International (shortened to Chernobyl Children International in 2010), an {{organisation}} founded and run by Roche that works with children, families, and communities that continue {{to be affected by}} Chernobyl. Through the years, Hewson has taken at least ten trips to Belarus and other nations in the region despite the risk to her health. [...] She has organised overland aid convoys and sometimes driven ambulances filled with medical supplies herself; in one case she had to retreat quickly when a fire spread in a village a few miles from Chernobyl. [...] Hewson has made sure her own children met those from Chernobyl with birth deformities and other illnesses, so that they would have a broader appreciation of the world and what <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>thankful</b> for. She has said that fundraising for those affected is very difficult, given that many people believe the problems of Chernobyl are all in the past.|$|E

2500|$|Noted logician and philosopher Arthur Prior (originator of tense logic) {{has also}} drawn a {{distinction}} between what he calls A-facts and B-facts. The latter are facts about tenseless relations, such {{as the fact that}} the year 2025 is 25 years later than the year 2000. The former are tensed facts, such as the Jurassic age being in the past, or the end of the universe being in the future. Prior asks the reader to imagine having a headache, and after the headache subsides, saying [...] "thank goodness that's over." [...] Prior argues that the B-theory cannot make sense of this sentence. It seems bizarre <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>thankful</b> that a headache is earlier than one's utterance, anymore than being thankful that the headache is later than one's utterance. Indeed, most people who say [...] "thank goodness that's over" [...] are not even thinking of their own utterance. Therefore, when people say [...] "thank goodness that's over," [...] they are thankful for an A-fact, and not a B-fact. Yet, A-facts are only possible on the A-theory of time.|$|E
2500|$|Robinson {{had told}} Billboard {{that he had}} been {{lobbying}} for the Miracles since his own induction, [...] "making calls and signing petitions and everything, because they really deserve it." [...] Though some felt Robinson should've been included as an inductee with the other Miracles, Robinson said, [...] "I don't really even care about that. I'm already in there. I don't understand why it was, like, a task to get the Miracles in there. We were one of the hottest and most prolific groups in the world at that time, so I don't understand the hesitancy." [...] Claudette Robinson stated, [...] "When I spoke to (Rock and Roll Hall of Fame & Museum President and CEO) Terry Stewart, he said he got no less than 900 e-mails per day saying the Miracles should be inducted, and why aren't they? I was surprised by that. I would think five or 10, but he said that amount, so it's {{a lot of people that}} were really pulling for us. You have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>thankful</b> and grateful for that." [...] However, before this decision, Miracle Marv Tarplin died in September 2011 at the age of 70, just months before the induction ceremony.|$|E
2500|$|After the match, Alex Ferguson praised Teddy Sheringham for his {{immediate}} impact after being brought on to replace Keane, saying: [...] "Teddy was magnificent. He has proved a point today. He {{was the key}} to victory." [...] He also complimented David Beckham on his performance in central midfield after Keane's withdrawal: [...] "Beckham took over Keane's role and was absolutely magnificent... People say that going to Barcelona without Roy Keane will be a major hurdle, but I don't think so now." [...] Ryan Giggs recognised the importance of scoring the first goal early in the game, saying: [...] "It helped getting the early goal then the second. It was hard for Newcastle {{to get back into the}} game with the weather like that. After the quick goal we could relax and hit Newcastle on the break." [...] Meanwhile, Newcastle manager Ruud Gullit was pleased with the effort his players had put in, but bemoaned their mistakes allowing Manchester United an easy victory: [...] "We were punished for our mistakes. The effort was right. The players worked hard and I can't ask for more, but every time we were on top we made a mistake and that cost us two goals. In the end we had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>thankful</b> they did not get three, four or five." ...|$|E

2500|$|Following her divorce, Jackson {{decided to}} record an uptempo, optimistic album rather than songs about sadness or anger. Producer Jimmy Jam said, [...] "You {{go through all}} these {{emotions}} and then {{you come out of}} it {{on the other side and}} say, [...] "I'm going to be okay and I have a lot of things <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>thankful</b> for,' and that was the overriding feeling in her life when we were making this album." [...] Its concept focuses largely on the demise of her marriage to René Elizondo, Jr. and subsequent embrace of the single life, experiencing dating for the first time. It also contains themes of sensuality, deceit, and betrayal. Jackson said, [...] "It’s a different thing for me. Growing up, I never dated. I’m doing that now, experiencing that whole life." [...] Its upbeat tempo intended to reflect Jackson's self-esteem, described as [...] "a work in progress." [...] Jam commented, [...] "She doesn't see herself the way other people see her. You know...gorgeous and sexy and all that. That isn't the kind of person she is. Although she is closer to feeling like that person now than she was 15 years ago. Or even three of four years ago." [...] Jackson commented, [...] "I look back at pictures of myself from four years ago and I see the unhappiness in my eyes. But I'm in the greatest space now... I believe we have choices and paths, and it's about choosing the right path, the promising path." [...] While recording, Jackson listened to artists such as St. Germain, Buena Vista Social Club, Thievery Corporation, Basement Jaxx, Outkast and Papa Roach.|$|E
