Subacute {{exposures}} (10 d) of the freshwater mollusc Dreissena polymorpha to disulfoton (10 mg/L), <b>thiometon</b> (6 mg/L), and its activated oxygen analogue demeton-S-methyl (6 mg/L) corroborate earlier {{findings of}} organophosphate resis-tance and accumulation in the organism. Mortality occurred not before the ninth day of exposure. Mortality was induced at high ambient water concentrations {{and must be}} due to unknown specific organophosphate effects. Body burdens reached satura-tion levels within one week being around 40 mg/kg wet weight for <b>thiometon</b> and 60 mg/kg for disulfoton. Mussels dying during the tests showed lower tissue concentrations. Elimina-tion of accumulated organophosphates was so low in the mussel, that an efficient metabolism of these compounds in the mussel was unlikely.

40|$|Abstract. The 96 -h toxieity of four {{organophosphates}} (thio-meton, disulfoton, malathion, and demeton-S-methyl, the oxy-gen analogue of <b>thiometon)</b> in the freshwater bivalve molluse Dreissena polymorpha {{was tested}} using different nominal con-centrations ranging between 6 and 50 mglL. No mortalities were observed in musseis exposed to malathion and demeton-S-methyl (26 mglL and 6 mglL, respectively), and at the lowest eoncentrations of <b>thiometon</b> and disulfoton (6 and 10 mglL, respectively). At higher <b>thiometon</b> and disulfoton concentra-tions, mortalities occurred. At the highest concentrations of 50 mg thiometonIL and 30 mg disulfotonIL, mussei mortalities of 88 and 93 %, respectively, were determined. Organophosphate concentrations of up to a factor 10 times {{higher than in the}} ambient water were found in exposed musseis, irrespective of whether they were alive or dead. The search for organophos-phate metabolites via GCIMS analysis of mussei tissue extraets was negative, suggesting lacking or low oxidative activation of the insecticides used. The mollusc is highly resistant to toxie effects of organophosphate insectieides and their biologieal aetive oxygen analogues. On November 1, 1986, a pestieide storing facility at Sandoz in Basel (Switzerland) caught fire. In order to extinguish the fire, water was pumped at high volurnes from the nearby river Rhine. This water found its way back into the river Rhine due to overflowing sewage canals (Capel et al. 1988; Güttinger and Stumm 1992). Along with the fire-extinguishing water, pesticides stored in the affeeted facility were swept into the river. Among these pesticides were organophosphate insecti-eides, mainly <b>thiometon</b> and disulfoton, mereurial-based fungi-eides, and herbicides. Consequently, the river Rhine ecosyste...|$|E
40|$|Eight {{commercial}} acaricides {{were evaluated}} in date palm plantations in Al-Gassim, Saudi Arabia, against the date mite Oligonychus afrasiaticus (McGregor). Neoron (bromopropylate 25 % EC), Kelthane (dicofol 18. 5 % EC), Tedion (tetradifon 75. 2 g L - 1), Top Cop (73 % S + 6. 4 % Cu, w/v), Microthiol Special (Sulfur 80 % WP, Ekatin (<b>thiometon</b> 25 % EC), were applied in sites 1 and 2. Peropal (azocyclotin 25 % WP) and Transact (abamectin 1. 8 % EC), {{in addition to}} Kelthane, Tedion and Neoron were used in site 3. Based on the percentage of web formation on date bunches all treatments, except Ekatin, reduced mite infestations significantly below that of the untreated check by the 7 th, 27 th and 21 st days after treatment (DAT) in sites 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Kelthane and Neoron significantly reduced mite infestation in the 3 sites after the second week from application and continued until the termination of the experiment. The effect of Microthiol Special was excellent until 35 DAT in site 1, when it gradually declined {{up to the end}} of the trial. Top Cop`s action was clear from week 3, however, it declined from the 5 th week in site 1. Ekatin knocked down initial infestations in both sites but rapid build up of infestation was observed in 13 and 28 DAT in sites 2 and 1, respectively. Best control obtained in site 3 was in the Neoron, Kelthane and Transact treatments, followed by Peropal and Tedion whose effect did not sustain to the end. The overall performance of the acaricides, determined according to their ability to reduce the mite infestation, compared to the control throughout the experiment, was 96. 8, 96. 3, 95. 2, 83. 8, 81. 7, 80. 6, 79. 0 and 30. 2 %, for Transact, Kelthane, Neoron, Peropal, Tedion, Microthiol, Top Cop and Ekatin, respectively. No significant differences were found in date weights between treatments...|$|E
40|$|Laboratory {{studies were}} {{conducted}} to examine the insecticidal action of agricultural chemicals against the parasite, Anicetus beneficus Ishii et Yasumatsu during 1960 and 1961. Judging from the figures obtained (as expressed by the mortality percentage) after 24 hours by the dipping method {{the results indicate that}} the four copper-mercury compounds have no effect on this parasite, but Selta (zinc dithiocarbazate 65 %) has a slight effect on it, and Sanquinon (dichlor- 1, 4 -naphthoquinon 35 %, tetra methyl thiuram disuiphide 20 %), Tedion, Neosappiran (p-chlorophenyl-p-chlorobenzenesulphonate 18 %, bis-(p-chlorophenyl) -mehtane 7 %), G- 338, Dinitrophenol and CCS have moderate effect on this. Kelthane, CMP, Methyldemeton, Ekatin (<b>Thiometon</b> 20 96), Fussol (monofiuoroacetamid 10 %), Bayer- 4741, Sevin and EPN showed high toxic action. Residues of Tedion, Dinitrophenol and Kelthane on the surface of a laurel twig were not effective even when they were not exposed to weathering. In that instance Ekatin showed a considerable residual effect and Methyldemeton, Fussol, Hokuthion (γ-BHC 15 %), Sevin, EPN, Sumithion (0, 0 -dimethyl- 0 -(3 methyl 4 nitrophenyl) -thiophosphate 50 %) and Malathion showed high toxic residual effect against the parasite. When residues were exposed to weathering for 5 days, Hokuthion and PCP did not approximately show any toxic action. Residual effects of Ekatin, Fussol, Bayer- 4741, Mehtyldemeton, Sevin and Sumithion decreased when residues were exposed to weathering for 9 - 10 days. Residual effect of EPN continued for 20 days. Residue of Malathion is more toxic than that of EPN. Residual effects of Parathion and DDT, when exposed to weathering for a month or so, remain still high against the parasite. Detrimental effects of insecticides on Anicetus beneficus were compared by the ratio of practical dosage against the pests to LD- 50 against the parasite. Thus, the relative toxic activities of Tedion, CMP and Methyldemeton were 1. 0 : 4. 1 : 6. 5. 柑橘園の害虫ルビーロームシの有力な天敵ルビーアカヤドリコバチに対する農薬の影響について基礎的な実験を行なつた. 浸漬試験でも殆ど殺虫性を示さなかつた農薬は各種の銅水銀剤で,有機硫黄剤Seltaは僅かに殺虫性が認められた. その他殺菌剤のSanquinon,殺ダニ剤のTedion,Neosappiran,G- 338,Dinitrophenol,CCSは浸漬試験ではかなりの殺虫率を示したが,残効試験では殆ど影響を示さなかつた. 浸漬試験で 100 %に近い殺虫率を示した薬剤のうち,残効試験で残効の殆ど認められなかつたものはKelthaneで, 10 日目位までに残効の減少して行つたものは順にEkatin,PCP,Hokuthion,Fussol,Bayer- 4741,Methyldemeton,Sevin,Thiodan,Sumithionであつた.
