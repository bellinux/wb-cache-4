500|$|The A.V. Clubs [...] Donna Bowman {{wrote that}} the episode showed [...] "flashes of {{brilliance}} in <b>this</b> <b>half</b> <b>hour</b> that were equally due to the situations {{set up by the}} writers and to the talents of the cast". Despite the mainly positive review, she criticized the Mitchell and Cameron plot for not having [...] "much warmth". She ultimately gave the episode a B+ while readers of the article gave it a B.|$|E

[...] "That's one reason why I'm so certain we'll have a soft time of it while we stay with the fleet." ...|$|R

60|$|Hip. The clock strikes two: Within <b>this</b> <b>half</b> <b>hour</b> {{we shall}} be called up to our devotions. Now, good Ascanio--Alas, he's gone too! we are left miserable and forlorn.|$|E
40|$|The womenâ€™s {{march in}} 1956 to the Union Buildings in Pretoria ended with thirty minutes of {{complete}} silence, {{as part of}} the protest against the extension of the Apartheid pass laws to women.

60|$|Cel. Do you not see? here's a poor gentlewoman in a swoon! (Swoon away.) I {{have been}} rubbing her <b>this</b> <b>half</b> <b>hour,</b> and cannot {{bring her to}} her senses.|$|E
60|$|Fred. Meet me within <b>this</b> <b>half</b> <b>hour,</b> at our monastery; and if, in {{the mean}} time, {{you can pick up}} a dozen of good fellows, who dare venture their lives bravely, bring them with you.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Here, Jane Beckett,' cried Mrs. Martha; 'd'ye {{see what}} 'tis to vindicate her! Will you take her word against mine, that she's been gossiping <b>this</b> <b>half</b> <b>hour</b> with that young rogue as {{was turned off}} at Ormersfield?' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>This</b> <b>half</b> <b>hour's</b> delay, however, {{of nearly}} {{one-half}} of the army, disconcerted the action. The divisions and brigades thus separated from each other by the skirmishing attack upon Chew's House, could not be re-united. The fog and smoke rendered all objects indistinct at thirty yards' distance; the {{different parts of the}} army knew nothing of the position or movements of each other, and the commander-in-chief could take no view nor gain any information of the situation of the whole. The original plan of attack was only effectively carried into operation in the centre. Still the action, though disconnected, irregular and partial, was animated in various quarters. Sullivan, being reinforced by Nash's North Carolina troops and Conway's brigade, pushed on a mile beyond Chew's House, where the left wing of the enemy gave way before him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Tut! tut! we {{will not}} compliment; for if I begin you will run away, and I have a wish to enjoy <b>this</b> happy <b>half</b> <b>hour</b> to the end;" [...] yet Mr. Bhaer looked pleased with the compliment, for it was true, and Mrs. Jo felt that she had {{received}} the best her husband could give her, by saying that he found his truest rest and happiness in her society.|$|R
6000|$|... "You'll have to wait, I'm afraid," [...] {{she warned}} him. [...] "The manager is busy just now. I've been {{wiggling}} on <b>this</b> bench <b>half</b> an <b>hour,</b> and haven't seen him yet--and my business is very important." ...|$|R
60|$|Gom. Why, {{what will}} you have me say? I think you'll make me mad: truth has been at my tongue's end <b>this</b> <b>half</b> <b>hour,</b> and I have not power to bring it out, for fear of this bloody-minded colonel.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I can't {{go to that}} house. I {{was locked}} out of it. Never mind me. I've had my {{happiness}} in <b>this</b> <b>half</b> <b>hour</b> with my little girl. I'd {{like to see her}} married, but it isn't to be." ...|$|E
6000|$|Why don't you [...] "parody that Ode?"--Do {{you think}} [2] I should be tetchy? {{or have you}} done it, and won't tell me?--You are quite right about Giamschid, and I have reduced it to a dissyllable within <b>this</b> <b>half</b> <b>hour</b> [3].|$|E
5000|$|<b>This</b> one-off <b>half</b> <b>hour</b> {{programme}} explored {{various aspects}} of Martin's life. It was a repackaging of material previously released as four 7 minute long online only episodes, under Channel 4's Shorts brand, on their online platform 4oD. Episodes [...] "Prized Possession" [...] and [...] "TT Racer" [...] were released on 18 August 2014, followed by [...] "Inside the Mind of a Racer" [...] and [...] "Proud Mechanic" [...] on 1 October 2014. Proud Possession focuses on his Merlin engine.|$|R

60|$|In <b>this</b> fashion <b>half</b> an <b>hour</b> went by, {{and it is}} safe {{to state}} that this was the longest and most trying <b>half</b> <b>hour</b> that Jasper Grinder {{experienced}} in his whole life. He shouted at the wolves and threw bits of sticks at them, but to this they paid no attention. Then he cried for help, but the Rovers and John Barrow were too far off to hear him.|$|R
6000|$|The garden-door opens! How now, Aurelia and Camilla in {{expectation}} of Don Melchor {{at the garden}} door!

6000|$|... 'As {{to getting}} on,' said Solomon good-naturedly, 'it would be odd if I couldn't get on without a young dog like {{you a great}} deal better than with you. As to dinner being ready, it's been ready <b>this</b> <b>half</b> <b>hour</b> and waiting for you. As to being hungry, I am!' ...|$|E
6000|$|A {{murmur of}} applause {{went through the}} party, and Oliver Proudfute exclaimed, [...] "That is what I {{have been saying for}} <b>this</b> <b>half</b> <b>hour,</b> and not one of ye would listen to me. 'Let us go to our provost,' said I. 'He is a gentleman himself, and ought to come between the burgh and the nobles in all matters." ...|$|E
50|$|Mornings is {{broadcast}} from 8:30am until 11:00am {{with the first}} 30 minutes devoted to the main news stories of the day. Prime ministers, premiers and other politicians will lobby to be interviewed in <b>this</b> first <b>half</b> <b>hour.</b> After 9:00am talkback callers are encouraged {{to contribute to the}} day's debate. Mornings has proved almost as controversial as the stories normally covered on the local current affairs show. Several people have presented the show over the years with their departure often making headlines.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, come, come," [...] {{said the}} King, impatiently, [...] "you needn't {{keep it up}} with me. The augurs must wink {{sometimes}} from sheer fatigue of the eyelids. Let us enjoy <b>this</b> for <b>half</b> an <b>hour,</b> not as actors, but as dramatic critics. Isn't it a joke?" ...|$|R
60|$|During {{the next}} hour the click of the hedge-shears drew nearer, but the girl did not notice <b>this.</b> In another <b>half</b> <b>hour</b> James himself came into view, intent upon his {{monotonous}} task. Gradually the motionless form of the girl and the plodding figure of the gardener drew together, until he stood but two yards distant. Then he paused, looked toward the arbor, and uttered an exclamation.|$|R
6000|$|... "Vengeance {{belongs to}} God," [...] replied the old man, [...] "and his bolt has fallen.--This way--this way," [...] he continued, {{dragging}} Tyrrel into the house. [...] "Know," [...] he said, so {{soon as he}} had led or forced him into a chamber, [...] "that Mowbray of St. Ronan's has met Bulmer within <b>this</b> <b>half</b> <b>hour,</b> and has killed him on the spot." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, {{that sounds}} very amiable here; but {{in five minutes}} you'll be murmuring in Miss Bandoline's earm--'I've been pining {{to come to you}} <b>this</b> <b>half</b> <b>hour,</b> but I was obliged to take out that Miss Wilder, you see--countrified little thing enough, but not bad-looking, and has a rich aunt; so I've done my duty to her, but deuse take me if I can stand it any longer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Jane," [...] she said, [...] "you {{are always}} {{agitated}} and pale now. I am {{sure there is}} something the matter. Tell me what business St. John and you have on hands. I have watched you <b>this</b> <b>half</b> <b>hour</b> from the window; you must forgive my being such a spy, but {{for a long time}} I have fancied I hardly know what. St. John is a strange being--" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{had been}} lying like <b>this</b> for <b>half</b> an <b>hour</b> or so, and had {{forgotten}} all about the ghost, when, on casually casting my eyes round the room, I noticed {{for the first time}} a singularly contented-looking phantom, sitting in the easy-chair by the fire, smoking the ghost of a long clay pipe.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{take great}} freedom, sir," [...] said Peveril, as they now {{approached}} {{the end of}} the lane, where it opened on a broad common; [...] "and you seem rather to count more on my forbearance, than you have room to do with safety. We are now nearly free of the lane which has made us companions for <b>this</b> late <b>half</b> <b>hour.</b> To avoid your farther company, I will take the turn to the left, upon that common; and if you follow me, it shall be at your peril. Observe, I am well armed; and you will fight at odds." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{dinner was}} at last over, and the port-wine {{was carried out}} into the arbour;--not, on this occasion, by Polly, but by the maid. Polly and Mrs. Neefit went off together, while Ralph crowded into the little summer-house with Moggs and Neefit. In <b>this</b> way <b>half</b> an <b>hour</b> was passed,--a <b>half</b> <b>hour</b> of terrible punishment. But there was worse coming. [...] "Mr. Newton," [...] said Neefit, [...] "I think I heard {{something}} about your taking a walk with our Polly. If you {{like to make a}} start of it, don't let us keep you. Moggs and I will have a pipe together." ...|$|R
