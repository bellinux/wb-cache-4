40|$|Animal {{models of}} {{intervertebral}} disc degeneration {{play an important}} role in 					clarifying the physiopathological mechanisms and testing novel therapeutic 					strategies. The objective of the present study is to describe a simple animal 					model of disc degeneration involving Wistar rats to be used for research 					studies. Disc degeneration was confirmed and classified by radiography, magnetic 					resonance and histological evaluation. Adult male Wistar rats were anesthetized 					and submitted to percutaneous disc puncture with a 20 -gauge needle on levels 6 - 7 					and 8 - 9 of the coccygeal vertebrae. The needle was inserted into the discs 					guided by fluoroscopy and its tip was positioned crossing the nucleus pulposus 					up to the contralateral annulus fibrosus, rotated 360 ° twice, and held for 					 30  s. To grade the severity of intervertebral disc degeneration, we 					measured the intervertebral disc height from radiographic images 7 and 30 days 					after the injury, and the signal intensity T 2 -weighted magnetic resonance 					imaging. Histological analysis was performed with hematoxylin-eosin and collagen 					fiber orientation using picrosirius red staining and polarized light microscopy. 					Imaging and histological score analyses revealed significant disc degeneration 					both 7 and 30 days after the lesion, without deaths or systemic complications. 					Interobserver histological evaluation showed significant agreement. There was a 					significant positive correlation between histological score and intervertebral 					disc height 7 and 30 days after the lesion. We conclude that the <b>tail</b> <b>disc</b> 					puncture method using Wistar rats is a simple, cost-effective and reproducible 					model for inducing disc degeneration...|$|E

40|$|The {{intervertebral}} disc withstands large compressive loads (up to nine times bodyweight in humans) while providing flexibility to the spinal column. At a microstructural level, the outer sheath of the disc (the annulus fibrosus) comprises 12 – 20 annular layers of alternately crisscrossed collagen fibres {{embedded in a}} soft ground matrix. The centre of the disc (the nucleus pulposus) consists of a hydrated gel rich in proteoglycans. The disc is the largest avascular structure {{in the body and}} is of much interest biomechanically due to the high societal burden of disc degeneration and back pain. Although the disc has been well characterized at the whole joint scale, {{it is not clear how}} the disc tissue microstructure confers its overall mechanical properties. In particular, there have been conflicting reports regarding the level of attachment between adjacent lamellae in the annulus, and the importance of these interfaces to the overall integrity of the disc is unknown. We used a polarized light micrograph of the bovine <b>tail</b> <b>disc</b> in transverse cross-section to develop an image-based finite element model incorporating sliding and separation between layers of the annulus, and subjected the model to axial compressive loading. Validation experiments were also performed on four bovine caudal discs. Interlamellar shear resistance had a strong effect on disc compressive stiffness, with a 40 % drop in stiffness when the interface shear resistance was changed from fully bonded to freely sliding. By contrast, interlamellar cohesion had no appreciable effect on overall disc mechanics. We conclude that shear resistance between lamellae confers disc mechanical resistance to compression, and degradation of the interlamellar interface structure may be a precursor to macroscopic disc degeneration...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Introduction Earlier work {{indicates}} that the cholesterol-lowering drug, simvastatin, is anabolic to chondrogenic expression of rat intervertebral disc (IVD) cells, which suggests a potential role for simvastatin in IVD regeneration. In this study, we expand on our earlier work to test the effectiveness of simvastatin on disc degeneration utilizing a rat <b>tail</b> <b>disc</b> degeneration model. Methods 30 rats that underwent 21 G needle-puncture at rat tail discs were injected with simvastatin-loaded poly(ethylene glycol) -poly(lactic acid-co-glycolic acid) -poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG-PLGA-PEG) gel (5 mg/ml) or vehicle control at 4 weeks after needle injury. All animals were sacrificed 2 weeks after simvastatin injection. Bone morphogenetic protein- 2 (BMP- 2), aggrecan, collagen type II, and collagen type I messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression in the rat nucleus pulposus (NP) were measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed to monitor changes in disc degeneration. Rat discs were also assessed by histology using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and safranin O staining. In addition, the NP weight, glycosaminoglycan (sGAG) and DNA content were also measured. Results A single dose of simvastatin loaded in thermo-sensitive PEG-PLGA-PEG gel injected into the NP had the trend to increase aggrecan expression and sGAG content, and significantly increased mRNA levels of BMP- 2, collagen type II, and the differentiation index (the ratio of collagen type II to collagen type I). The decreased NP weight, T 2 intensity, as well as MRI index in the rat tail discs induced by needle puncture were significantly reversed after 2 weeks of simvastatin treatment. In addition, simvastatin treatment also improved histological changes induced by needle puncture. Conclusions A single injection of simvastatin loaded in PEG-PLGA-PEG gel into rat tail discs {{had the potential to}} retard or regenerate the degenerative disc...|$|E

In the first stage, the rats were divided into two group according to discs punctured by different needle gauges (18 gauge and 22 gauge). In the second stage, the ideal size of needle was used to induce rat <b>tail</b> <b>disc</b> degeneration. These animals are divided into three groups according to timing of treatment (zero-week, two-week, four-week). Each group was divided into three treating subgroups: control group, BMDMSC group, and Baculo-BMP- 7 -BMDMSC group. Each rat undergoes radiography examination every two weeks. After eight weeks, the discs were histologically examined with hematoxylin and eosin stain and Alcian blue stain. The 18 -gauge group exhibited significant decrease in disc height index (%) than 22 -gauge group at eight weeks at both Co 6 - 7 (58. 1 % ± 2. 8 % vs. 63. 7 % ± 1. 0 %, p = 0. 020) and Co 8 - 9 discs (62. 7 % ± 2. 8 % vs. 62. 8 % ± 1. 5 %, p = 0. 010). Baculo-BMP- 7 -BMDMSCs group showed significant difference in disc height index compared to the BMDMSCs group at both Co 6 - 7 (93. 7 % ± 1. 5 % vs. 84. 8 % ± 1. 0 %, p = 0. 011) and Co 8 - 9 (86. 0 % ± 2. 1 % vs. 81. 8 % ± 1. 7 %, p = 0. 012). In Baculo-BMP- 7 -BMDMSCs group, the zero-week treatment subgroup showed significant better in disc height index compared to two-week treatment group (p = 0. 044), and four-week treatment group (p = 0. 011).

40|$|Conference Theme: The Intervertebral Disc - from Degeneration to Therapeutic Motion PreservationIntroduction Intervertebral disc (IVD) {{degeneration}} is a {{major cause}} of back pain that can also lead to sciatica, affecting the quality of life. Current treatments are limited to salvage surgical operations. Biological treatments to relieve symptoms or to restore disc are not available as we know little about the biology of IVD degeneration and its potential to regeneration. While most people will develop disc degeneration with aging, there are individuals who are protected even at the age (older than 50 years) when over 90 % of the populationwould succumb to the problem, suggesting the presence of protective genes. Furthermore, maintenance of progenitor cells within the nucleus pulposus (NP) is thought {{to play an important role}} in disc homeostasis. A hypothesis is that genetic factors can confer a protection against disc degeneration via better maintenance of resident progenitor cells. There exist strains of “healer” mice (MRL/MpJ, LG/J) that have better regenerative potentials of cartilage tissues. 1, 2 Thus, we propose to address the NP progenitor cell pools in these healer mice in relation to the degeneration and potential repair/regeneration potentials of the disc. Materials and Methods Good healer (MRL and LG/J) and poor healer (C 57 /BL 6 C, and SM/J) micewere used in this study. Histological comparison of <b>tail</b> <b>disc</b> sections was assessed from 8 to 24 weeks of age. Progenitor cell pools and differentiated NP cellswere assessed using immunohistochemistry using specific cell markers, Tie- 2 and disialoganglioside (GD 2), that were recently identified. 3 Tail looping at 8 weeks of age for a fixed periodwas used as an environmental perturbation that will induce degeneration. Unlooping the tail after the period of looping can assess healing processes with appropriate controls. Results A comparison of MRL and C 57 miceshowedneither observable histological differences, nor signs of degenerative processes from 8 -week to 24 -week of age. Following tail looping for 4, 5, 6 and 8 weeks, therewere significant distortion of the annulus fibrosus (AF) and NP at the compressed and distended sides; in terms of loss of NP cells, AF tears and ruptures, and cell death in the AF. After the tails are unlooped for 4 weeks, there are restoration of NP and AF structures such as cell number in both MRL and C 57 mice. However, superior healing is seen for MRL mice at all time-points studied; especially in TL 6 /TL 7, TL 7 /TL 8 and TL 8 /TL 9 disc levels, in which the disc structure restores better via continuous expansion of NP region, cell repopulation and lamellae orientation recovers in the compressed AF sides with a clear NPAF boundary. In C 57 mice, the AF lamellae structure remained disorganized following unlooping. Interestingly, in the absence of tail looping, SM/J tail discs already showed severe degeneration even at 8 -week-old, while that of LG/J mice were relatively normal, suggesting an impact on developmental or maturation in SM/J IVDs. Immunohistochemistry analysis of progenitors related marker GD 2 and Angiopoietin 1 (Ang- 1, Tie- 2 ligand) shows different expression pattern in 8 -week old MRL and C 57, and GD 2 is well colocalized with Ang- 1, indicating a potential regulatory role of these progenitors in disc degeneration and repair. Conclusion By comparing the genetically different healer MRL, LG/J and non-healer C 57 and SM/J, we have shown that a population of novel marked NP progentiors may play a key role in the maintaining, healing or regenerative of IVD structure and function. Abnormal persistent mechanical loading of the spine there appears to be threshold for the disc to self-repair, likely to be related to the onset of fibrotic events.

40|$|INTRODUCTION. The {{intervertebral}} disc {{is the largest}} avascular structure in the human body, withstanding transient loads of up to nine times body weight during rigorous physical activity. The key structural elements of the disc are a gel-like nucleus pulposus surrounded by concentric lamellar rings containing criss-crossed collagen fibres. The disc also contains an elastic fiber network which has been suggested to play a structural role, but to date {{the relationship between the}} collagen and elastic fiber networks is unclear. CONCLUSION. The multimodal transmitted and reflected polarized light microscopy technique developed here allows clear differentiation between the collagen and elastic fiber networks of the {{intervertebral disc}}. The ability to image unstained specimens avoids concerns with uneven stain penetration or specificity of staining.

40|$|Intervertebral disc {{degeneration}} {{induced by}} mechanical compression {{is an important}} issue in spinal disorder research.

By using this device, rat <b>tail</b> <b>discs</b> were subjected to compressive stress of 0. 5 or 1. 0  MPa for 2  weeks. Discs in the sham group received an attachment of the device but no loading. After the experimental period, first the intact tail with peripheral tissues (PT) such as tendon and skin and then the retrieved disc without PT were subjected to a uniaxial tension–compression test; biomechanical characteristics such as range of motion (ROM), neutral zone (NZ), and hysteresis loss (HL) were evaluated. Furthermore, the load-bearing contribution of PT in the intact tail was estimated by comparing the load–displacement curves obtained by the mechanical tests performed with and without PT. The experimental findings revealed that the continuous compressive stress induced reduction in disc thickness. The intact tail demonstrated decreases in ROM and NZ as well as increases in HL. On the other hand, the retrieved disc demonstrated increases in ROM, NZ, and HL. Further, {{a significant increase in the}} load-bearing contribution of PT was indicated. These findings suggest that the load-bearing capacity of the disc was seriously deteriorated by the application of compressive stress of 0. 5 or 1. 0  MPa for 2  weeks...|$|R

40|$|Fluid flow is {{essential}} for the transport of metabolites to, from and within the intervertebral disc. By applying quadriphasic mixture theory experimentally, this study relates fluid flow within the bovine nucleus pulposus (NP) to the applied fluid pressure gradients and fixed charge and mobile ion concentration gradients. 24 plugs of NP tissue (diameter 10 mm, height 1020 ± 122 µm (mean ± S. D)), orientated in the axial direction, were harvested from bovine <b>tail</b> <b>discs.</b> The plugs were permeated with either; 0 M NaCl, 0. 15 M NaCl or 3 M NaCl solutions by subjecting them to 30, 45 and 60 kPa fluid pressure gradients applied in a random sequence. The hypertonic solution was assumed to render all non-fluid pressure gradients negligible, whilst the hypotonic solution was assumed to render the mobile ion concentration gradient negligible. The effects of these gradients on fluid flow were expressed {{as a percentage of the}} applied fluid pressure. Fluid velocity was significantly increased through the tissue in the isotonic case compared to the hypertonic case by up to 55 % of the applied fluid pressure. The fixed charges accounted for between 26 - 43 % and the mobile ion gradient responsible for 12 - 26 % of this increased fluid flow. These results highlight the importance of using a constitutive equation for permeability that includes mobile ions and fixed charges as separate phases when modelling cartilaginous tissue in order to better describe fluid flow, and thus convective transfer of metabolites, within the tissue...|$|R
40|$|Poster Presentation: no. P 35 Intervertebral discs (IVD) are fibrocartilaginous {{tissues of}} the spine that provide {{flexibility}} and absorb mechanical stress. Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) is a multifactorial disease that causes sudden lateral curvature {{of the spine}} during the adolescent growth spurt but has no known cause. SNPs near the PAX 1 gene {{have been associated with}} AIS patients, and PAX 1 is known to be a key transcription activator in the embryonic development of the disc. However, the postnatal expression and function of PAX 1 have not been addressed previously. In addition, Pax 1 -null mice develop spinal curvature, yet it is unclear how the mutation affects the disc to initiate or contribute to progression of the curve. This study provides the first detailed analysis of postnatal Pax 1 expression in the mouse disc. Pax 1 is found to be expressed in the NP and AF of lumbar and <b>tail</b> <b>discs</b> from neonatal to adult ages. Next, to study the effect of spinal curvature on Pax 1, the tail looping method was applied to 6 - and 8 -week old mice for 1 and 4 weeks. Pax 1 expression was maintained in the NP, but was reduced on the convex OAF and increased in the concave OAF. This indicates that Pax 1 expression can be influenced by mechanical forces in postnatal growth and maintenance. Thus, PAX 1 as a genetic risk factor may contribute to initiation and progression of spinal curvature in AIS from asymmetrical loading of the IVD. Studies of IVD development and curvature in Pax 1 -null mice are in progress, and genetic interaction with another transcription factor, Runx 3 will be examined in the future...|$|R

We show that the overall optical/UV/X-ray/g-ray spectrum can be deconvolved into three basic continuum components: a cool multitemperature blackbody, a hard thermal Comptonized component and an EUV/soft X-ray component well described by a thermal Comptonization continuum. Assuming that the optical/IUE spectrum comes from a cold disc, the maximum disc temperature is very well constrained by the data to be kTdisc 3 : 2 þ 0 : 2 0 : 2 eV. This rules out models explaining the soft excess as a far <b>tail</b> of the <b>disc</b> spectrum. We show that the soft excess inferred by the data requires a separate continuum component, {{which is consistent with}} thermal Comptonization in optically thick (t, 30), warm (, 0 : 3 keV) plasma. This Comptonization component contains a significant fraction of the source energy. The plasma parameters of the hard continuum (t, 2, kTHC, 50 keV) ar...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{discuss the}} {{evolution}} of a disc galaxy due to the formation of a bar and, subsequently, a peanut. After the formation stage there is still considerable evolution, albeit slower. In purely stellar cases the pattern speed of the bar decreases with time, while its amplitude grows. However, if a considerable gaseous component is present in the disc, the pattern speed may increase with time, while the bar strength may decrease. In some cases the gas can be brought sufficiently close to the center to create a strong central concentration, which, in turn, may modify the properties of the bar. More violent evolution can take place during interactions, so that some disc substructures can be either formed or destroyed in a time scale which is small compared to a Hubble time. These include spirals, bars, bridges, <b>tails,</b> rings, thick <b>discs</b> and bulges. In some cases interactions may lead to mergings.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Cells in the {{intervertebral}} disc have unique phenotypes and marker genes that separate the nucleus pulposus (NP), annulus fibrosus (AF) and articular cartilage (AC) have been identified. Recently, {{it was shown}} that phenotypic marker genes exhibit variable expression in humans. In this study, the bovine tail {{was used to determine}} the ability of marker genes to distinguish the outer and inner AF from NP tissue and isolated cells. METHODS: Bovine <b>tail</b> intervertebral <b>discs</b> from 13 donors were dissected and correct isolation of tissue was confirmed. mRNA was isolated directly from tissue or passage 0 monolayer cells and used for gene expression measurements (qPCR). Conventional marker genes (bAcan, bCol 1 a 1, bCol 2 a 1) and novel marker genes (bAdamts 17, bBrachyury/T, bCD 24, bCol 5 a 1, bCol 12 a 1, bFoxf 1, bKrt 19, bPax 1, bSfrp 2) were evaluated. RESULTS: As expected bAcan, bCol 2 a 1 and bCol 1 a 1 distinguished outer AF from NP tissue, while inner AF and NP could not be discriminated. The NP markers bT, bCd 24 and bKrt 19 were significantly higher expressed in NP than inner and outer AF tissue. bFoxF 1 and bPax 1 only distinguished IVD tissues from AC. The AF markers bAdamts 17, bCol 5 a 1, bCol 12 a 1 and bSfrp 2 were higher expressed in the outer AF compared with inner AF and NP tissue. Monolayer culturing strongly decreased bAcan, bCol 2 a 1, bCD 24 and bCol 5 a 1 expression, while bCol 1 a 1, bT, bKrt 19 and bSfrp 2 were not affected. CONCLUSION: The IVD phenotypic marker genes bT, bKrt 19, bSfrp 2 and bCol 12 a 1 convincingly distinguished NP from outer AF in situ and in vitro...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Introduction A scoliotic {{deformity}} on intervertebral discs may accelerate degeneration at {{a molecular}} level with the production of metalloproteinases (MMPs). In the present experimental study we evaluated the presence of MMP- 1 immunohistochemically after application of asymmetric forces in a rat intervertebral disc {{and the impact of}} the degree of the deformity on MMP- 1 expression. Material-Method Thirty female Wistar rats (aged 2 months old, weighted 200 ± 10 grams) were used. All animals were age, weight and height matched. A mini Ilizarov external fixator was applied {{at the base of a}} rat tail under anaesthesia in order to create a scoliotic deformity of the intervertebral disc between the 9 th and 10 th vertebrae. Rats were divided into three groups according to the degree of the deformity. In group I, the deformity was 10 °, in group II 30 ° and in group III 50 °. The rats were killed 35 days after surgery. The discs were removed along with the neighbouring vertebral bodies, prepared histologically and stained immunohistochemically. Immunopositivity of disc's cells for MMP- 1 was determined using a semi-quantitative scored system. Results MMP- 1 immunopositivity was detected in disc cells of annulus fibrosus of all intervertebral disc specimens examined. The percentage of MMP- 1 positive disc cells in annulus fibrosus in group I, II and III were 20 %, 43 % and 75 %, respectively. MMP- 1 positivity was significantly correlated with the degree of the deformity (p Conclusion The present study showed that an experimentally induced scoliotic deformity on a rat <b>tail</b> intervertebral <b>disc</b> results in over-expression of MMP- 1, which is dependent on the degree of the deformity and follows a dissimilar distribution between the convex and the concave side. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Tienchi (Panax notoginseng) {{has been}} used in {{conservative}} treatments for back pain as a major ingredient of many herbal medicines. This study aims to investigate the effects of a herbal medicine containing tienchi on compressed intervertebral discs in rats. Methods Using an in vivo rat <b>tail</b> model, intervertebral <b>disc</b> compression was simulated in the caudal 8 – 9 discs of 25 rats by continuous static compression (11 N) for 2 weeks. An herbal medicine plaster (in which the major ingredient was tienchi) was externally applied to the compressed disc (n= 9) for three weeks, and held in place by an adhesive bandage, in animals in the Chinese Medicine (CM) group. The effect of the bandage was evaluated in a separate placebo group (n= 9), while no intervention with unrestricted motion was provided to rats in an additional control group (n= 7). Disc structural properties were quantified by in vivo disc height measurement and in vitro morphological analysis. Results Disc height decreased after the application of compression (P P = 0. 006) and placebo (P = 0. 003) groups, but was maintained in the CM group (P = 0. 494). No obvious differences in disc morphology were observed among the three groups (P = 0. 896).

40|$|We {{consider}} continuum free-free {{radio emission}} {{from the upper}} atmosphere of protoplanetary discs as a probe of the ionized luminosity impinging upon the disc. Making use of previously computed hydrodynamic models of disc photoevaporation {{within the framework of}} EUV and X-ray irradiation, we use radiative transfer post-processing techniques to predict the expected free-free emission from protoplanetary discs. In general, the free-free luminosity scales roughly linearly with ionizing luminosity in both EUV and X-ray driven scenarios, where the emission dominates over the dust <b>tail</b> of the <b>disc</b> and is partial optically thin at cm wavelengths. We perform a test observation of GM Aur at 14 - 18 Ghz and detect an excess of radio emission above the dust tail to a very high level of confidence. The observed flux density and spectral index are consistent with free-free emission from the ionized disc in either the EUV or X-ray driven scenario. Finally, we suggest a possible route to testing the EUV and X-ray driven dispersal model of protoplanetary discs, by combining observed free-free flux densities with measurements of mass-accretion rates. On the point of disc dispersal one would expect to find a M_dot^ 2 scaling with free-free flux in the case of EUV driven disc dispersal or a M_dot scaling in the case of X-ray driven disc dispersal.

40|$|The work {{presents}} the results of finite element (FE) simulation and study of 3 -D stress-strain state of attachments of steam turbine last stages blades performed {{with the use of the}} ANSYS FE software. The attachments of the steam turbine last stages blades consist of a great deal of structural elements (e. g. rivets, forks) that have complicated geometrical shape and are in contact interaction with each other. To obtain the FE results, correctly describing local stresses and to reduce the computation time, a series of 3 -D finite element models has been built and a method of multi-level submodeling has been used. In the process of the finite element study of the 3 -D stress-strain state of the blades attachments the following models have been used: 1. Initial model – a macro-model incorporating a disc sector and a blade with a shroud flange, damper links, and the attachment; 2. First-level submodel comprising a blade attachment and a disc sector; 3. Second-level submodel intended for correct determination of local stress fields in rivets. With the use of the method of multi-level submodeling on a submodel 717675 degrees of freedom, fields of local stresses and strains for the rivets have been obtained. To calculate the complete model without applying the method of multi-level submodeling, it would be necessary to solve a problem of 3 -D contact interaction with as many degrees of freedom as 1102743. As a result of the finite element simulation performed with due regard to the 3 -D multiple contact interaction of the blade <b>tail</b> and the <b>disc,</b> there have been revealed the areas where the equivalent, Mises stresses exceeded the yield strength. The practical recommendations have been worked out allowing reduction of the equivalent stresses in the mentioned areas. The results obtained have been used in modernizing the existing constructions as well as for designing the new blade attachments...|$|R
