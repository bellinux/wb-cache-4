5|$|One unusual specimen, {{described}} by Branch and Farrell (1988), from Summer Pride, East London in South Africa, was striped. The pattern {{consisted of a}} narrow (1 scale wide) pale yellowish stripe that ran from the crown of the head <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> of the tail.|$|E
5|$|State Route 209 (SR209) was a {{state highway}} in the U.S. state of California, {{connecting}} Cabrillo National Monument with the interchange of Interstate 5 (I-5) and I-8 in San Diego, passing through the neighborhoods of Point Loma. The majority of the route was along Rosecrans Street; it also included Cañon Street and Catalina Boulevard leading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> of Point Loma.|$|E
5|$|The {{basic unit}} of {{measurement}} used during construction was the tala, defined as {{the length of a}} human face from the forehead's hairline <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> of the chin or the distance from the tip of the thumb <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> of the middle finger when both fingers are stretched at their maximum distance. The unit is thus relative from one individual to the next, but the monument has exact measurements. A survey conducted in 1977 revealed frequent findings of a ratio of 4:6:9 around the monument. The architect had used the formula to lay out the precise dimensions of the fractal and self-similar geometry in Borobudur's design. This ratio is also found in the designs of Pawon and Mendut, nearby Buddhist temples. Archeologists have conjectured that the 4:6:9 ratio and the tala have calendrical, astronomical and cosmological significance, {{as is the case with}} the temple of Angkor Wat in Cambodia.|$|E

50|$|For {{wings of}} moderate-to-high aspect ratio, the flow at any station along the span except close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tips</b> behaves much like flow around a {{two-dimensional}} airfoil, and most explanations of lift, like those above, concentrate on two-dimensional flow. However, even for wings of high aspect ratio, the three-dimensional effects associated with finite span are significant {{across the whole}} span, not just close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tips.</b>|$|R
5|$|Additionally, {{there can}} be {{confusion}} between the various water hemlock species and poison hemlock (Conium maculatum) as the common name hemlock is applied to both Cicuta and Conium maculatum. Both are poisonous and can be differentiated by differences in their root structure. Water hemlock has a branched root systems with tubules, while poison hemlock has a single tap root. Another reliable method to identify water hemlock {{is to examine the}} leaf veins. Water Hemlock is unique in the Apiaceae family in that it has leaf veins which terminate in the notches between the leaf tips, rather than extend <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> of the leaf, as is found in the leaf structure of other members of this family.|$|E
5|$|Archaea flagella operate like {{bacterial}} flagella—their long stalks {{are driven}} by rotatory motors at the base. These motors are powered by the proton gradient across the membrane. However, archaeal flagella are notably different in composition and development. The two types of flagella evolved from different ancestors. The bacterial flagellum shares a common ancestor with the type III secretion system, while archaeal flagella appear to have evolved from bacterial type IV pili. In contrast to the bacterial flagellum, which is hollow and is assembled by subunits moving up the central pore <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> of the flagella, archaeal flagella are synthesized by adding subunits at the base.|$|E
5|$|At birth, a {{rattlesnake}} hatchling {{has only a}} small button or 'primordial rattle' which is firmly attached <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> of the tail. The first segment is added when the hatchling sheds its skin for the first time. A new section is added each time the skin is shed until a rattle is formed. The rattle grows as the snake ages but segments are also prone to breaking off and hence {{the length of a}} rattle is not a reliable indicator of the age of a snake.|$|E

5|$|Ficus obliqua occurs from Mount Dromedary (36° S) in {{southern}} New South Wales northwards {{along the coast}} and Great Dividing Range <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> of Cape York Peninsula in north Queensland. Outside Australia it occurs on New Guinea and offshore islands, through eastern Indonesia to Sulawesi {{in the west and}} east into the southwestern Pacific, where it is found in New Caledonia, Fiji, Tonga, Samoa and Vanuatu. It had been thought to occur in Western Australia, but these collections have been now referred to Ficus brachypoda. Preferring soils with high nutrient and water content, it occurs on sandstone or latite soils in the Sydney region. The habitat is warm temperate to moist subtropical rainforest. Large specimens can rise above the canopy as emergent trees.|$|E
5|$|The Gulf Stream, {{together}} with its northern extension the North Atlantic Drift, is {{a warm and}} swift Atlantic ocean current that originates in the Gulf of Mexico and stretches <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> of Florida, and follows the eastern coastlines of the United States and Newfoundland before crossing the Atlantic Ocean. The process of western intensification causes the Gulf Stream to be a northward accelerating current off {{the east coast of}} North America. At about , it splits in two, with the northern stream, the North Atlantic Drift, crossing to Northern Europe and the southern stream, the Canary Current, recirculating off West Africa.|$|E
5|$|There {{is a form}} sold as a Banksia (spinulosa) cunninghamii variant, {{propagated}} by Bournda Plants of Tura Beach on the NSW south coast. The plants reach 70cm {{after four}} years and have black-styled gold inflorescences. The form came from David Shiels of Wakiti Nursery in Victoria, who got it from Alf Salkin.

5|$|They {{possess a}} unique feeding {{mechanism}} known as suction feeding. Instead of catching their prey with teeth, it is sucked into their oral cavity. Their tongue can move very freely, and when suddenly retracted {{at the same}} time as the gular floor is distended, the pressure immediately drops within their mouth and the prey is sucked in with the water. The family members are characterized by having a lower jaw that extends at least <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> of the upper jaw, a shallow or non-existent notch between the tail flukes, a dorsal fin set well back on the body, three of four fused cervical vertebrae, extensive skull asymmetry and two conspicuous throat grooves forming a 'V' pattern.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{its large}} size, the overall {{appearance}} of Deinosuchus was not considerably {{different from that}} of modern crocodilians. Deinosuchus had an alligator-like, broad snout, with a slightly bulbous tip. Each premaxilla contained four teeth, with the pair nearest <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> of the snout being significantly smaller than the other two. Each maxilla (the main tooth-bearing bone in the upper jaw) contained 21 or 22teeth. The tooth count for each dentary (tooth-bearing bone in the lower jaw) was at least 22. All the teeth were very thick and robust; those close {{to the rear of the}} jaws were short, rounded, and blunt. They appear to have been adapted for crushing, rather than piercing. When the mouth was closed, only the fourth tooth of the lower jaw would have been visible.|$|E
5|$|During the British Civil Wars (mid-17th {{century in}} Great Britain), both the Parliamentarian and Royalist armies used various {{incendiary}} devices to attack enemies and destroy property {{that might be}} used for military purposes, according to historian Stephen Porter in Destruction in the English Civil Wars. The flaming arrow attack was used to set fire to buildings at a distance. An arrow with a flammable substance attached to the shaft, close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip,</b> was shot from a bow or short-muzzled musket. Such arrows shot from a musket had their feathers removed, to fit inside the muzzle, and were called fire-darts. These devices were cheap to make and easy to prepare. Although used infrequently during the wars, the flaming arrows and darts proved to be destructive. The Royalists shot flaming arrows into the thatched homes {{in the suburbs of}} Chester causing extensive damage. Lyme Regis was partly razed using flaming arrows.|$|E

5|$|Governor Broward {{ran for the}} U.S. Senate in 1908 but lost. Broward and his predecessor, William Jennings, {{were paid}} by Richard Bolles to tour the state to promote drainage. Broward {{was elected to the}} Senate in 1910, but died before he could take office. He was eulogized across Florida for his {{leadership}} and progressive inspiration. Rapidly growing Fort Lauderdale paid him tribute by naming Broward County after him (the town's original plan had been to name it Everglades County). Land in the Everglades was being sold for $15 an acre a month after Broward died. Meanwhile, Henry Flagler continued to build railway stations at towns as soon as the populations warranted them. News of the Panama Canal inspired him to connect his rail line to the closest deep water port. Biscayne Bay was too shallow, so Flagler sent railway scouts to explore the possibility of building the line through <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> of mainland Florida. The scouts reported that not enough land was present to build through the Everglades, so Flagler instead changed the plan to build to Key West in 1912.|$|E
5|$|Most {{anthozoans}} are opportunistic predators, catching prey which drifts {{within reach}} of their tentacles. The prey is secured {{with the help of}} sticky mucus, spirocysts (non-venomous harpoon cells) and nematocysts (venomous harpoon cells). The tentacles then bend to push larger prey into the mouth, while smaller, plankton-size prey, is moved by cilia <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> of the tentacles which are then inserted into the mouth. The mouth can stretch to accommodate large items, and in some species, the lips may extend to help receive the prey. The pharynx then grasps the prey, which is mixed with mucus and slowly swallowed by peristalsis and ciliary action. When the food reaches the coelenteron, extracellular digestion is initiated by the discharge of the septa-based nematocysts and the release of enzymes. The partially digested food fragments are circulated in the coelenteron by cilia, and from here they are taken up by phagocytosis by the gastrodermal cells that line the cavity.|$|E
5|$|The body cavity {{contains}} the circulatory or haemal system. The vessels form three rings: one around the mouth (the hyponeural haemal ring), another around the digestive system (the gastric ring) {{and the third}} near the aboral surface (the genital ring). The heart beats about six times a minute and is {{at the apex of}} a vertical channel (the axial vessel) that connects the three rings. At the base of each arm are paired gonads; a lateral vessel extends from the genital ring past the gonads <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> of the arm. This vessel has a blind end and there is no continuous circulation of the fluid within it. This liquid does not contain a pigment and has little or no respiratory function but is probably used to transport nutrients around the body.|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of calcium chelating agents (EDTA or EGTA) <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tips</b> of maize roots caused {{a loss of}} gravitropic sensitivity. When the chelator was replaced with calcium chloride, gravitropic sensitivity was restored. Asymmetric {{application of}} calcium chloride near <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> of a vertical root caused curvature toward the calcium source. When the calcium was applied <b>to</b> <b>the</b> upper surface of <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> of a root oriented horizontally, the root curved upward even though control roots exhibited strong downward curvature. Application of calcium chloride <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tips</b> of decapped roots, which {{are known to be}} gravitropically insensitive, did not restore gravitropic sensitivity. However, asymmetric application of calcium chloride near <b>the</b> <b>tips</b> of decapped roots caused curvature toward the calcium source.

5|$|The design {{proposed}} by Handley Page {{in response to}} B.35/46 was given the internal designation of HP.80. To achieve the required performance, Handley Page's aerodynamicist Dr. Gustav Lachmann and his deputy, Godfrey Lee developed a crescent-shaped swept wing for the HP.80; the sweep and chord of the wing decreased in three distinct steps from the root <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip,</b> to ensure a constant limiting Mach number across the entire wing and consequently a high cruise speed. Early work on the project included tailless aircraft designs, which would have used wing-tip vertical surfaces instead; however as the proposal matured a high-mounted, full tailplane was adopted instead. The profile and shaping of the crescent wing was subject to considerable fine-tuning and alterations throughout the early development stages, particularly to counter unfavourable pitching behaviour in flight.|$|E
5|$|With the 25 June 1950 {{outbreak}} of the Korean War, the North Korean People's Army had invaded the Republic of Korea (ROK) with 90,000 well-trained and equipped troops who had easily overrun the smaller and more poorly equipped Republic of Korea Army. The United States (U.S.) and United Nations (UN) began an intervention campaign to prevent South Korea from collapsing. The U.S. troops engaged the North Koreans first at the Battle of Osan, being badly defeated on 5 July by the better-trained North Koreans. From then on, the U.S. and UN saw {{a steady stream of}} defeats until they had been pushed back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> of the peninsula, into a -long fortification dubbed Pusan Perimeter by August. At the same time, North Korean agents began to infiltrate behind UN lines and attack military targets and cities.|$|E
5|$|Matangi {{represents}} {{the power of}} the spoken word (Vaikhari) as an expression of thoughts and the mind. She also relates to the power of listening and grasping speech and converting it back to knowledge and thought. Besides spoken word, she also governs all other expressions of inner thought and knowledge, like art, music and dance. Matangi presides over the middle part of speech (Madhyama), where ideas are translated into the spoken word and in her highest role, represents Para-Vaikhari—the Supreme Word manifested through speech and that encompasses knowledge of the scriptures. She is described as the goddess of learning and speech, and the bestower of knowledge and talent. She is also called Mantrini, the mistress of the sacred mantras. She also {{represents the}} word of a guru, who serves as a spiritual guide. Matangi is described as dwelling in the Throat chakra—the origin of speech—and on the tip of the tongue. She is also associated with a channel called Sarasvati from the third eye <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> of the tongue. According to David Frawley, her description as impure refers {{to the nature of the}} spoken word, which labels things and stereotypes them, thereby hindering actual contact with the soul of things. The goddess is described as one who helps a person to use words in the right way and to go beyond it to seek the soul and inner knowledge, which lie outside the demarcated boundaries of tradition.|$|E
