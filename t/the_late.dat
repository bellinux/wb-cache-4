5|$|Although {{investigation}} of Preclassic remains is difficult at Motul de San José {{due to the}} overlying Late Classic construction, {{it is evident that}} the site experienced major growth during <b>the</b> <b>Late</b> Preclassic (300 BCAD 300) and became a sizeable centre. At roughly the same time, most of the major structures were built at Akte, and Chakokot experienced its earliest occupation during <b>the</b> <b>Late</b> Preclassic. In contrast, Buena Vista appears to have been lightly occupied. La Trinidad de Nosotros also underwent major expansion in <b>the</b> <b>Late</b> Preclassic and became larger and more important than Motul de San José, with its architectural layout being finalised in this period – later Classic period construction was superimposed upon pre-existing Late Preclassic structures.|$|E

5|$|By <b>the</b> <b>late</b> Miocene, around 10 Mya, the bovids rapidly diversified, {{leading to}} the {{creation}} of 70 new genera.

Fossils of obivines, a tribe of Caprinae, in Africa date back to <b>the</b> <b>late</b> Miocene.
