50|$|Services for de-sludging tend <b>to</b> <b>empty</b> <b>a</b> {{septic tank}} completely, i.e. take out all septage, while the actual {{requirement}} is removal of settled solids, and even this purposefully incompletely {{so as to}} leave {{at least some of}} the microbial populations in place to continue the anaerobic degradation processes that take place in a septic tank.|$|R

60|$|Seeing {{all these}} {{indications}} of hard roystering; like a cautious young bridegroom {{at his own}} marriage merry-making, Taji stood on his guard. And when Borabolla urged him <b>to</b> <b>empty</b> <b>a</b> gourd or two, by way of making room in him for the incidental repast about to be served, Taji civilly declined; not wishing to cumber the floor, before the cloth was laid.|$|R

There {{was an old}} king {{one knew}} in the western islands, who used <b>to</b> <b>empty</b> <b>a</b> Winchester all round a man, and stir his hair or nick a rag out of his clothes with every ball except the last; and that went plump between the eyes. It was pretty practice." ...|$|R

40|$|A frozen-plug {{technique}} has been {{conceived as a}} means of temporarily blocking the flow of liquid oxygen or its vapor through a tube or pipe. The technique makes it possible to perform maintenance, repair, or other work on downstream parts of the cryogenic system in which the oxygen is used, without having <b>to</b> <b>empty</b> <b>an</b> upstream liquid-oxygen reservoir and, hence, without wasting the stored liquid oxygen and without subjecting the reservoir to the stresses of thermal cycling...|$|R

50|$|After the February 27, 2010 {{earthquake}} {{one of the}} park's main attraction, the Seven Cups, completely dried up. It {{is believed}} a rock fissure allowed the water <b>to</b> <b>empty</b> into <b>an</b> aquifer.|$|R
50|$|The hatch {{was opened}} {{and with no}} enemy ships in sight, the machine guns were not manned or prepared. The {{commander}} decided <b>to</b> <b>empty</b> <b>a</b> fuel tank in order to escape even faster, which rose the sub even higher in the water exposing the diesel exhaust pipes. Due to more pre-existing damage coupled with damage from the depth charges, the pipes began to spark, giving away O 20s position to anyone who looked in her direction. The commander decided to do nothing.|$|R
40|$|In 2002, Cookie Monster {{appeared}} in The Inquisitive Problem Solver. The hungry monster wants <b>to</b> <b>empty</b> <b>a</b> set of jars filled with various numbers of cookies. On {{each of his}} moves, he may choose any subset of jars and take {{the same number of}} cookies from each of those jars. The Cookie Monster number is the minimum number of moves Cookie Monster must use <b>to</b> <b>empty</b> all of the jars. This number depends on the initial distribution of cookies in the jars. We discuss bounds of the Cookie Monster number and explicitly find the Cookie Monster number for Fibonacci, Tribonacci and other nacci sequences. Comment: 8 page...|$|R
5000|$|A {{large number}} of myths and legends {{surround}} the few facts known about Klaus Störtebeker's life. Störtebeker is both a nickname and a surname (in 2015 ca. 200 persons in Northern Germany with the surname Störtebeker), meaning [...] "empty the mug with one gulp" [...] in Low Saxon. The moniker refers to the pirate's supposed ability <b>to</b> <b>empty</b> <b>a</b> four-litre (1.06 US gal) mug of beer in one gulp. At this time, pirates and other fugitives from the law often adopted a colorful nom de guerre.|$|R

50|$|The {{ability of}} {{packaging}} <b>to</b> fully <b>empty</b> <b>a</b> viscous liquid is somewhat {{dependent on the}} surface energy of the inner walls of the container. The use of superhydrophobic surfaces is useful but can be further improved by using new lubricant-impregnated surfaces.|$|R
5000|$|Lakes of a {{diameter}} greater than ~300 m {{are capable of}} driving a fluid-filled crevasse to the glacier/bed interface, {{through the process of}} hydrofracture. A surface-to-bed connection made in this way is referred to as a moulin.When these crevasses form, it can take a mere 2-18 hours <b>to</b> <b>empty</b> <b>a</b> lake, supplying warm water {{to the base of the}} glacier - lubricating the bed and causing the glacier to surge. [...] The rate of <b>emptying</b> such <b>a</b> lake is equivalent to the rate of flow of the Niagara Falls. Such crevasses, when forming on ice shelves, may penetrate to the underlying ocean and contribute to the breakup of the ice shelf.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the {{stability}} of queues with impatient customers. Under general stationary ergodic assumptions, we first provide some conditions for such a queue to be regenerative (i. e. <b>to</b> <b>empty</b> <b>a.</b> s. {{an infinite number of}} times). In the particular case of a single server operating in First in, First out, we prove the existence (in some cases, on an enlarged probability space) of a stationary workload. This is done by studying a non-monotonic stochastic recursion under the Palm settings, and by stochastic comparison of stochastic recursions. Comment: This paper has been withdrawn by the author.

40|$|My {{work is a}} {{critical}} view of a modern principle of personal autonomy and an idea of autonomous man, which stems from philosophy of liberalism. The practice of personal autonomy in bioetics, which takes over the features of this political concept and does not comprise a metaphysical question about <b>a</b> man seems <b>to</b> <b>empty</b> <b>a</b> concept of humanity. My work tries to turn attentation to this problem and show the difficulties of personal autonomy when presented from the secular point of view. I want to offer then the concept of narrative ethics as a vision of supplementing the concept of modern principal bioetics...|$|R
40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this paper is}} to {{demonstrate}} the theoretical and practical use of dimensional analysis, π -theorem, to formulate a physical model of fluid flow from a reservoir. Such models are essential in chemical, mechanical, and reservoir engineering, specially, to find the time required <b>to</b> <b>empty</b> <b>a</b> tank or a reservoir. This work showed that dimensional analysis reduced the number of experimental variables to be correlated (measured), and pointed out the best experimental approach to the problem. Use of dimensional analysis results in significant saving of time, efforts and expense in experimental investigation and correlation...|$|R
50|$|The third day, the ogress {{suspected}} Filadoro and set {{the prince}} <b>to</b> <b>empty</b> <b>a</b> cistern. Filadoro said that they must flee and dug a hole to an underground passage and they ran away. The prince {{did not want to}} bring her to his palace afoot and dressed this way, so he went to get suitable clothing and a carriage. The ogress cursed him to forget her {{as soon as he was}} kissed, and when he reached the castle, his mother kissed him. He could no longer explain what had happened to him, and agreed to marry as his mother wished.|$|R
50|$|The story came about, that Baxmann {{was carried}} to his grave, {{and as the}} mourners returned, was seen looking {{out of the window}} of his house! The second burial ended with Baxmann {{appearing}} among the mourners on their way back from the graveyard.Monks were then consulted to ban Baxmann from the town. They cursed him <b>to</b> have <b>to</b> <b>empty</b> <b>a</b> wellspring with a sieve, and peace returned to the village.One dreadfully cold winter, the spring froze to the ground, and Baxmann was able to chip the ice away with his sieve and was free! His undying soul was banished again from the town, this time with the curse of having <b>to</b> <b>empty</b> the wellspring with a thimble.The Baxmann has never been seen in Oldendorf since.|$|R
5000|$|Each {{level has}} a time limit, if the player fails <b>to</b> <b>empty</b> all the bins within this limit then the player has {{to repeat the}} level. If a level is played three times {{exceeding}} the time limit, the game is over. The player must avoid stepping onto grass, as doing so will cause the time counter to decrease very rapidly until they step off it. But if the player manages <b>to</b> <b>empty</b> <b>a</b> bin without stepping onto any grass, the householder appears {{at the door and}} invites the player in for a few seconds. This will increase the time limit, as well as providing a little humorous conversation, such as [...] "Could you look at my TV?" [...] - [...] "I meant mend it, not watch it".|$|R

30|$|Porosity is an {{important}} characteristic which would influence the tissue attachment and growth. The porosity of the scaffolds was measured by using a porosimeter based on capillary flow method. Scaffolds were cut into 5  ×  5  ×  1  mm pieces and the samples were impregnated with the wetting liquid. An inert gas N 2 was used to displace this wetting liquid from the porous network. The pressure required <b>to</b> <b>empty</b> <b>a</b> pore corresponds <b>to</b> the pressure necessary to evacuate the liquid from the most constricted part of it. The Young–Laplace formula permits calculating of pore diameter from the measured pressure (Nazarov et al. 2004).|$|R
50|$|Bill goes unnoticed into a bingo parlor, {{orders a}} sandwich, harasses the host, and leaves without {{shooting}} anyone, believing the elderly patrons are already {{close enough to}} dying. He then enters a local bank, killing the security guard before shooting some of the employees and customers who attempt to subdue him. He proceeds to rob the bank, forcing the manager <b>to</b> <b>empty</b> <b>a</b> safe full of money into a plastic trash bag. Outside the bank, he secretly switches the money he stole with his fake money and burns the bag in a trash can, shouting that money is worthless and causes {{the problems of the}} world.|$|R
