50|$|Baxter's law can be {{illustrated}} under {{the context of}} Internet market before the broadband age. As mentioned above, when the market for platform is subject to price and rate regulation, a monopoly of network provider holds strong incentives to monopolize an unregulated applications market (a downstream level market). For example, because the FCC have capped the price that telephone companies could charge consumers by using the telephone network circuit for Internet access, those companies are unable to extract monopoly profits from the platform. In other words, they are prohibited <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>charges</b> and prices for the exclusive services which they provide in the market. As a result, these monopoly extend their business and service to unregulated markets. Comparing to rivals in these market, monopolies could offer lower, cost-based rates for the same service because of vertically integration. Therefore, the revenues earned in unregulated market can offset the loss due to regulation in monopoly market and increase overall profits.|$|E
50|$|The Limpsfield and Oxted Water Company was {{formally}} established by an Act of Parliament in 1888, {{but was not}} the first company to supply water to that area, since the Act gave powers to dissolve a limited company with the same name, and to incorporate the shareholders into a new company. The new company could supply water for public and private use to the villages of Limpsfield, Oxted, Titsey, Tatsfield, Edenbridge and parts of Westerham. They were empowered to build two new reservoirs (numbered 3 and 4), both located in Limpsfield, and several pipelines, and to purchase the land on which the existing works of the limited company were situated, which included two reservoirs (numbered 1 and 2), a pumping station, and a meter chamber, all of which were located in Limpsfield. The Act received Royal Assent on 24 July 1888. The company petitioned for another Act in 1902, to allow them to increase their share capital, to build another reservoir and a well or wells with an associated pumping station in Limpsfield, and to extend their area of supply to include Cowden in Kent. It was granted on 23 June 1902.

50|$|The MAC, led by Rohatyn, {{insisted that}} the city make major reforms, {{including}} a wage freeze, a major layoff, a subway fare hike, and charging tuition at the City University. The New York State Legislature supported the MAC by passing a law converting the city sales tax and stock transfer tax into state taxes, which when collected were then used as security for the MAC bonds. The State of New York also passed a state law that created an Emergency Financial Control Board to monitor the city's finances, required the city to balance its budget within three years, and required the city to follow accepted accounting practices. But even {{with all of these}} measures, the value of the MAC bonds dropped in price, and the city struggled to find the money to pay its employees and stay in operation. In November 1975 the federal government stepped in, with Congress extending $2.3 billion in short-term loans. In return Congress ordered the city <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>charges</b> for city services, to cancel a wage increase for city employees and to drastically reduce {{the number of people in}} its workforce. Rohatyn and the MAC directors persuaded the banks to defer the maturity of the bonds they held and to accept less interest. They also persuaded the city and state employee pension funds to buy MAC bonds to pay off the city's debts. The city government cut its number of employees by 40,000, deferred wage increases already agreed in contracts and kept them below the level of inflation. Thanks to these measures, the confidence of the banks and bond market in MAC bonds was restored.|$|E

We show that there exist equilibria {{in which the two}} governments choose privatization and the national welfare of each port country is higher relative to a situation where ports are public. This is because privatization is a commitment <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>charges</b> relative to public port charges, which allows for a better exploitation of the third region. For some parameter regions, port countries non-cooperatively choose public port operations, while they {{would be better off if}} both ports were private.

40|$|Artículos en revistasNet-metering is {{commonly}} known as a practice by which owners of distributed generation (DG) units may offset their electricity consumption from the grid with local generation. The increasing number of prosumers (consumers that both produce and consume electricity) with solar photovoltaic (PV) generation combined with net-metering results in reduced incomes for many network utilities worldwide. Consequently, this pushes utilities <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>charges</b> per kW h in order to recover costs. For non-PV owners, this could result into inequality issues {{due to the fact that}} also non-PV owners have to pay higher chargers for their electricity consumed to make up for netted costs of PV-owners. In order to provide insight in those inequality issues caused by net-metering, this study presents the effects on cross-subsidies, cost recovery and policy objectives evolving from different applied netmetering and tariff designs for a residential consumer. Eventually this paper provides recommendations regarding tariffs and metering that will result in more explicit incentives for PV, instead of the current implicit incentives which are present to PV owners due to net-metering. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E
40|$|Peter Browne and Brian Costar go {{rummaging through}} letterboxes in Victoria 2 ̆ 7 s {{marginal}} seats “MANY MEDIA commentators {{do not see}} much of the real campaign these days,” says the former national director of the Liberal Party, Lynton Crosby. “It does not take place on TV, on radio, {{or even in the}} newspapers. It is the local activity on the ground that counts. Letters to voters, postcards, newsletters, telephone canvassing [...] . ” A team of volunteers in marginal seats around Victoria has been collecting direct mail material and forwarding it to us so we can get a sense of this “real campaign. ” So far, we’ve received material from the first three weeks of the election campaign. Not surprisingly, the volume of material - although it varies from electorate to electorate - has not been enormous. At this stage the Liberal Party has significantly out-mailed Labor, both in the cost and number of brochures reaching households. As Lynton Crosby says, the emphasis is on the local. In Kilsyth, for example, a letter from Labor’s Dympna Beard lists a series of local projects - including Croydon’s “new 5. 1 million Police Station” and a 47 million upgrade of Maroondah Hospital - while her Liberal opponent, David Hodgett, promises projects including 150, 000 for CCTV cameras “to cut down on vandalism and petty crime in Mooroolbark” and 4, 544, 948 - a very precise figure! - for local bridges and roads. In Morwell, the message from sitting Labor MP Brendan Jenkins, is also local, but he devotes an unusually long letter to the government’s support for the Gippsland Water Factory and his own role in securing benefits for the local community. The message here is that a sitting member whose party is likely to remain in power {{is in a position to}} influence policy to the benefit of the local electorate. The same message comes through in other marginals. Running alongside the local detail are brochures appearing across all marginal electorates. From the Liberals, the theme of an eight-page brochure is “Let’s Get Victoria Moving Again” - a slogan that seems to hark back to the dominant theme of the 1992 election. The unusual level of detail in this brochure (it’s hard to imagine too many voters reading it right through) is probably designed to convey a conviction that the Liberals have developed serious policies and are ready to govern. Ted Bailleau - in outdoor gear, hand pointing into the distance - appears on each page. “Waste” is the other big theme in the Liberal material. A brochure distributed in many electorates - clearly inspired by the federal party’s visually arresting interest rate “slide rule” at the 2004 election - is in the shape of a wallet. Headlined “ 494. 00. It’s Your Money,” it claims that this is the amount, per taxpayer, spent by the Bracks government on “self-promotion and budget blow-outs. ”News clipping and quotes from the media - overwhelmingly from the Herald Sun - feature in this leaflet and are a common feature across most of the Liberal material. From Labor, the brochures are generally fewer and smaller, with a few notable exceptions. Typical is a postcard-sized leaflet from the state member for Bayswater, Peter Lockwood, which tells us that “Peter Lockwood and Steve Bracks are standing up for working families” and concentrates on achievements since 1999 rather than policy plans. But Dick Wynne, the Labor member for Richmond, has issued a much more arresting four-page colour brochure featuring Labor achievements in his electorate. This brochure also seems to have been inspired by the “Local Achievements and Strong Plans for Our Areas” brochure used in many electorates by the Liberals during the 2004 federal campaign. And Bob Stensholt in Burwood has letterboxed a DVD - received by one of our collectors - featuring footage of the premier and the local member extolling Labor 2 ̆ 7 s virtues. Down in Southern Metropolitan Region the upper and lower house Labor MPs and candidates have taken a different approach, getting together to set up a sophisticated website, www. yourlaborteam. org, and developed some unusually oblique materials. A series of beautifully designed postcards (a contrast to the general run of election material produced by all the parties) uses quotes from H. L. Mencken, Decca Records, the Chairman of IBM and a French physiologist to underline the differences between Labor and its opponents. The person behind this stylish material is probably the upper house candidate Evan Thornley, a former internet entrepreneur who now runs Pluto Press and is active in the Fabian Society. The material is intriguing but clearly pitched at a segment of these well-heeled inner south-eastern electorates - and may well be targeted to people who the campaign manager see as being most receptive to this approach. Both the Liberals and the Nationals are running negative campaigns against the Greens, both via the media and direct mail. A new brochure, first spotted in this final week of the campaign, warns that the Greens “are likely to win control of the Upper House” and that their policies on drugs, the economy and property “will have a drastic effect on all Victorians. ” But you’ll find no evidence in the brochure that the Greens’ policies will have any impact at all on property - unless you count the proposal <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>charges</b> on commercial carparks. And unless you read the fine print you won’t know it’s from the Liberal Party. For the Nationals, the threat of the Greens is more of a life or death matter, and their material dwells on the sharp differences between the two parties. “While the Nationals have commonsense, practical, family orientated policies, the Greens want to decriminalise drug use, ban recreational hunting, close down Gippsland industries and remove jobs,” according to a brochure from Jim King and Peter Hall, upper and lower house Nationals candidates. None of this - nor the attacks on the Greens from Family First and the Shooters Party - is likely to do too much damage to the Green vote, though it might make supporters of the Nationals, Family First and the Shooters vote for their usual party with more enthusiasm. Material from the Greens has been relatively low-key. In inner urban electorates, the party’s brochures stress two main themes: public transport and the achievements of Green councillors in local government. It’s difficult to tell how much targeting is going on within electorates. We know that the two parties are increasingly using sophisticated databases to store information about individual voters - information gathered within electorate offices from phone and mail contact with the sitting member, local media and other sources. As a former Liberal Party staff member, Christian Kerr, has said, “Voters who phone or write to their members of parliament have no idea they are effectively phoning up the direct mail offices. ” On our evidence, the computer only seems to be choosing between families and others when it decides which letter to send to individuals. In Melbourne, for example, voters seem to be receiving either a letter headed “Standing Up for Local Working Families” or one headed “Getting Results for Our Area” from Labor’s Bronwyn Pike. But we would need hundreds of volunteers collecting material in a single electorate to get a real sense of how the databases are being used. No one outside the political parties knows exactly how much they each spend on direct mail material during election campaigns. After the last federal election, “industry sources” told the Australian Financial Review that Labor and the Liberals had each spent about 5 million on direct mail - which was around half the amount the Liberals had spent on TV, radio, newspapers and cinema, and over half what Labor had spent on those media. In this election, the Liberals are undoubtedly outspending Labor on letters and brochures - by perhaps two to one - which might reflect the fact that they have less money to spend on the more expensive options of radio, TV and newspapers. • Peter Browne is editor of APO and Brian Costar is professor of Victorian parliamentary democracy at the Swinburne Institute for Social Research Photo: Alessandro Lippi/iStockphoto. co...|$|E
