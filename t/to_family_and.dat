Hall started the 2004 season playing as a forward and, despite moving into the midfield by mid-season, he was still a regular goalkicker. In June he was named in the VFL representative squad to play against the West Australian Football League, but he missed out on the match due to a hip flexor injury that sidelined him for a month. Hall finished the home and away season in fifth place in The Mercurys Tasmanian Devils Player of the Year award and in equal third place in the Devils' best and fairest.|$|E

He became engaged to several women but never married. He died in 1924 at the age of 40 from tuberculosis.|$|E

5|$|Lassie themes {{explored}} {{the relationship between}} boys and their dogs with the show helping to shape the viewer's understanding of mid-twentieth century American boyhood. Lassie {{was associated with the}} wholesome family values of its period but some parents' groups monitoring television content found cliffhanger plots showing children in danger too intense for very young viewers and objected to some of Timmy's actions which were believed to encourage children to disobey parents. However, Lassie was consistently depicted as caring, nurturing, and responsible with a commitment <b>to</b> <b>family</b> <b>and</b> community, often rescuing those in peril and righting wrongs. She was the perfect 'mother' within the American ideology of the 1950s and 1960s.|$|E

5|$|Telecommunication {{has played}} a {{significant}} role in social relationships. Nevertheless, devices like the telephone system were originally advertised with an emphasis on the practical dimensions of the device (such as the ability to conduct business or order home services) as opposed to the social dimensions.

5|$|The {{case is a}} tubular {{structure}} made of silk, secreted from salivary glands {{near the mouth of}} the larva, and is started soon after the egg hatches. Various reinforcements may be incorporated into its structure, the nature of the materials and design depending on the larva's genetic makeup; this means that caddifly larvae can be recognised by their cases down <b>to</b> <b>family,</b> <b>and</b> even genus level. The materials used include grains of sand, larger fragments of rock, bark, sticks, leaves, seeds and mollusc shells. These are neatly arranged and stuck onto the outer surface of the silken tube. As the larva grows, more material is added at the front, and the larva can turn round in the tube and trim the rear end so that it does not drag along the substrate.|$|E
5|$|Many {{details of}} Monitors history and {{insights}} of everyday crew life {{have been discovered}} from correspondence sent from the various crew members <b>to</b> <b>family</b> <b>and</b> friends while serving aboard the ironclad. In particular the correspondence of George S. Geer, who sent more than 80 letters, {{often referred to as}} The Monitor Chronicles, to his wife Martha during the entire time of Monitors service provide many details and insights into every chapter of the ironclad's short-lived history, offering a rare perspective of a sailor's experience on the naval front during the Civil War. The letters of Acting Paymaster William F. Keeler to his wife Anna also corroborate many of the accounts of affairs that took place aboard the Monitor. The letters of Geer and Keeler are available for viewing and are housed at the Mariners' Museum in Virginia. Other crew members were interviewed later in life, like Louis Stodder, one of the last crew members to abandon Monitor minutes before she sank in a storm at sea, who was the last surviving crew member of Monitor and lived well into the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Shapiro {{responds}} to Goodin's argument by challenging his factual assumption that individuals would starve if they refused the workfare throffer. In state-sponsored (see welfare state) workfare systems, he claims, only monetary assistance is eliminated by {{a refusal to}} accept the throffer, while in private systems (that is, non-state charities or organisations offering conditional aid), other groups than the one operating a workfare system exist. In either system, recipients of welfare may also turn <b>to</b> <b>family</b> <b>and</b> friends for help. For these reasons, he does not consider the throffer to be unrefusable in the cases in which Goodin believes it is. A second (and, Shapiro claims, more important) objection is also presented. State welfare without sanctions fails to mirror the way that working individuals who do not rely on welfare payments {{take responsibility for their}} lives. If a person who works stops working, Shapiro observes, then they will typically find their economic situation worsened. Unconditional state welfare does not reflect this, and instead reflects the unusual position of the person who would be no worse off if they refused to work. As unconditional welfare does not mirror the situation of ordinary workers, it is unable {{to determine whether or not}} people are willing to take responsibility for their lives.|$|E
