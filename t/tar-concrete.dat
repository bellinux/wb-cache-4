40|$|AbstractThe {{theoretical}} postulates {{of designing}} of modified paving concrete, made of organic bindings by combined modification of asphalt- and <b>tar-concrete</b> have been formed, namely: by modification of binding polymers, integrated with them; doping into {{the composition of}} bindings the complex additives, consisting of polymer and active dispersed filling agent; superficial activation with mineral powder by oligomers and polymers. It has been proved experimentally that complex and modified asphalt-concrete and <b>tar-concrete</b> are characterized by elevated values of resistance to water and frost, resistance to thermooxidizing aging; are distinguished for the wide interval of binding and elastic behaviour of paving, uprated of shift resistance and elasticity index...|$|E
