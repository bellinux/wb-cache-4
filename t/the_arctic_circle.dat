5|$|Viperidae is {{a family}} of venomous snakes found all over the world, except for Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, Madagascar, Hawaii and <b>the</b> <b>Arctic</b> <b>Circle.</b> All have {{relatively}} long hinged fangs that permit deep penetration and injection of venom. Two species are found in Trinidad and Tobago.|$|E
5|$|Homarus gammarus {{is found}} across the {{north-eastern}} Atlantic Ocean from northern Norway to the Azores and Morocco, {{not including the}} Baltic Sea. It is also present {{in most of the}} Mediterranean Sea, only missing from the section east of Crete, and along only the north-west coast of the Black Sea. The northernmost populations are found in the Norwegian fjords Tysfjorden and Nordfolda, inside <b>the</b> <b>Arctic</b> <b>Circle.</b>|$|E
5|$|Over the Bering Sea, {{the three}} B-29s {{maintained}} radio contact with each other, communicating positions hourly as they navigated independently. Near <b>the</b> <b>Arctic</b> <b>Circle,</b> the magnetic compasses fluctuated wildly, and the fliers ignored them, relying {{instead on the}} radio compass. In Number 2, the radio compass stopped working as well, but it resumed working later in the flight.|$|E

5|$|A team of {{researchers}} discover remains of a crashed spaceship in <b>the</b> <b>Arctic</b> <b>Circle,</b> finding several humanoids with cybernetic implants frozen in the wreckage. Two bodies are taken to a nearby compound to be studied. The scientists marvel at the nanoprobes that begin to repair the long dead aliens. Suddenly one of the seemingly dead subjects attacks the scientists, assimilating them. Using scavenged wreckage to enhance the transport, they then escape into space, upgrading it with a faster than standard warp drive and weapons.|$|E

5|$|Commando raids {{were made}} by the Western Allies during much of the Second World War against the Atlantic Wall. The raids were {{conducted}} by the armed forces of Britain, the Commonwealth and a small number of men from the occupied territories serving with No. 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando during the Second World War. All the operations took place between <b>the</b> <b>Arctic</b> <b>Circle</b> in Norway to the French border with Spain, along what was known as the Atlantic Wall.|$|E
5|$|Dragonflies become scarce {{at higher}} latitudes. They are not native to Iceland, but {{individuals}} are occasionally swept in by strong winds, including a Hemianax ephippiger native to North Africa, and an unidentified darter species. In Kamchatka, {{only a few}} species of dragonfly including the treeline emerald Somatochlora arctica and some aeshnids such as Aeshna subarctica are found, possibly because of the low temperature of the lakes there. The treeline emerald {{is also found in}} northern Alaska, within <b>the</b> <b>Arctic</b> <b>Circle,</b> making it the most northerly of all dragonflies.|$|E
5|$|Since Svalbard {{is located}} north of <b>the</b> <b>Arctic</b> <b>Circle</b> it {{experiences}} midnight sun {{in summer and}} polar night in winter. At 74° north, the midnight sun lasts 99 days and polar night 84 days, while the respective figures at 81° are 141 and 128 days. In Longyearbyen, midnight sun lasts from 20 April until 23 August, and polar night lasts from 26 October to 15 February. In winter, the combination of full moon and reflective snow can give additional light.|$|E

5|$|About {{the time}} of the {{completion}} of the Alaska Railroad {{and the beginning of the}} dredging era in Fairbanks, Alaska's aviation industry began to take off. The first airplane flight in Alaska took place in Fairbanks on July 4, 1913, when a barnstormer flew from a field south of town. The aircraft had been crated and sent from Seattle via Skagway and Whitehorse. The pilot subsequently tried to sell the aircraft, but had no takers. Alaska's first commercial aircraft didn't arrive until June 1923, when Noel Wien began flying a Curtiss JN-4 on mail routes between Fairbanks and isolated communities. From Fairbanks, Wien became the first person to fly to Anchorage and cross <b>the</b> <b>Arctic</b> <b>Circle</b> in an airplane.|$|E
5|$|Collybia cookei {{is found}} in Europe, Asia (Japan), and North America. The European {{distribution}} extends north to <b>the</b> <b>Arctic</b> <b>Circle</b> and the Lofoten Islands. The species is widely distributed in North America; it was reported from Mexico {{for the first time}} in 1998. The fungus is partial to mixed forest dominated by aspen and conifers in montane and subalpine environments. In The Netherlands, it was a component of one of three communities of saprobic fungi associated with roadside verges (the land between the road edge and the adjacent wall, fence or hedge) planted with common oak (Quercus robur); the verges also supported the growth of the mushroom Russula ochroleuca, a host of C.cookei.|$|E

5|$|In the 2002 Nunavut Tourism {{publication}} The Time is Right: A Vision and Strategy for Tourism Development in Nunavut, {{a number}} of issues facing Nunavut tourism operators were highlighted. One major issue for the Nunavut tourism industry is the territory's remote nature. This imposes high travel costs on visitors to Nunavut, and drives tourism numbers down. In addition, Nunavut's position north of <b>the</b> <b>Arctic</b> <b>Circle</b> reduces the opportunity for spring activities, and results in a highly seasonally based tourism market. This limits opportunities for year-round employment in the territory. Many tourism organisations and operators faced difficulty attracting high-quality staff members to their ranks, and experienced high levels of turnover. There are limited links between tourism operators, inhibiting opportunities for inter-sector growth.|$|E
5|$|Millipedes {{occur on}} all continents except Antarctica, and occupy almost all {{terrestrial}} habitats, ranging {{as far north}} as <b>the</b> <b>Arctic</b> <b>Circle</b> in Iceland, Norway, and Central Russia, and as far south as Santa Cruz Province, Argentina. Typically forest floor dwellers, they live in leaf litter, dead wood, or soil, with a preference for humid conditions. In temperate zones, millipedes are most abundant in moist deciduous forests, and may reach densities of over 1,000 individuals per square metre. Other habitats include coniferous forests, deserts, caves, and alpine ecosystems. Some species can survive freshwater floods and live submerged underwater for up to 11 months. A few species occur near the seashore and can survive in somewhat salty conditions.|$|E
5|$|Several {{thousand}} years ago, the planet Cybertron was consumed by {{a civil war}} between the two Transformer factions, the Autobots led by Optimus Prime and the Decepticons led by Megatron. Optimus jettisoned the AllSpark, a mystical artifact that brings life to the planet, into space, but Megatron pursued it. Megatron crashed in <b>the</b> <b>Arctic</b> <b>Circle</b> and froze, and was discovered in 1895 by explorer Archibald Witwicky. Witwicky inadvertently activated Megatron’s navigational system, which etched the AllSpark’s coordinates into his glasses. The glasses {{end up in the}} possession of his great-great-grandson Sam Witwicky. In the present, Sam buys his first car, a rusting Chevrolet Camaro, but discovers it has a life of its own.|$|E

2500|$|Seen {{from the}} equator the {{celestial}} North Pole (boreios polos) {{is a point}} on the horizon. As the observer moves northward the pole rises and the circumpolar stars appear, now unblocked by the Earth. At the Tropic of Cancer the radius of the circumpolar stars reaches 24°. The edge stands on the horizon. The constellation of mikra arktos (Ursa Minor, [...] "little bear") was entirely contained within the circumpolar region. The latitude was therefore called the arktikos kuklos, [...] "circle of the bear". <b>The</b> terrestrial <b>Arctic</b> <b>Circle</b> was regarded as fixed at this latitude. <b>The</b> celestial <b>Arctic</b> <b>Circle</b> was regarded as identical to the circumference of the circumpolar stars and therefore a variable.|$|R
5|$|The Shenandoah {{destroyed}} {{one more}} prize in the Sea of Okhotsk, north of Japan, then continued to the Aleutians {{and into the}} Bering Sea and Arctic Ocean, crossing <b>the</b> <b>Arctic</b> <b>Circle</b> on June 19. Continuing then south {{along the coast of}} Alaska the Shenandoah came upon a fleet of Union ships whaling on June 22. She opened continuous fire, destroying a major portion of the Union whaling fleet. Capt. Waddell took aim at a fleeing whaler, Sophia Thornton, and at his signal, the gunner jerked a wrist strap and fired the last two shots of the American Civil War. Shenandoah had so far captured and burned eleven ships of the American whaling fleet while in Arctic waters.|$|E
5|$|The northeastern Pacific {{hurricane}} basins {{are divided}} into two parts– eastern and central. The eastern Pacific basin extends from {{all areas of the}} Pacific north of the equator east of 140°W, while the central Pacific basin includes areas north of the equator between 140°W and 180°W. Both basins extend to <b>the</b> <b>Arctic</b> <b>Circle</b> at 66°N. When tropical cyclones cross from the Atlantic into the Pacific, the name of the previous storm is retained if the system continues to exhibit tropical characteristics; however, when hurricanes degenerate into a remnant low-pressure area, the system is designated with the next name on the rotating eastern Pacific hurricane naming list.|$|E
5|$|The ship {{returned}} to Norway in mid-1942, but was badly damaged {{when she ran}} aground in July and did not return until April 1943. Hans Lody participated in the German attack (Operation Zitronella) on the Norwegian island of Spitzbergen, well north of <b>the</b> <b>Arctic</b> <b>Circle</b> and then spent {{the next six months}} on convoy duties in southern Norway. The ship began a lengthy refit in April 1944 and was not operational for the next year. She spent April 1945 escorting convoys in Danish waters before making one voyage to rescue refugees in East Prussia in May. Hans Lody was assigned to the Royal Navy after the war and used as a training ship and then a barracks ship before being broken up for scrap in 1949.|$|E
