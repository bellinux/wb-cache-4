5|$|A later source, Johannes Aventinus, {{writes that}} Taksony {{fought in the}} Battle of Lechfeld on August 10, 955. There, future Holy Roman Emperor Otto I routed an 8,000-strong Hungarian army. If this report is reliable, Taksony {{was one of the}} few Hungarian leaders to survive the battlefield. Modern historians, {{including}} Zoltán Kordé and Gyula Kristó, suggest that Fajsz abdicated in favor of Taksony around that <b>time.</b> <b>After</b> <b>that</b> battle the Hungarians' plundering raids in Western Europe stopped, and they were forced to retreat from the lands between the Enns and Traisen rivers. However, the Hungarians continued their incursions into the Byzantine Empire until the 970s.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} the Cotton {{manuscript}} itself is quite complex. The list of early writers above mentions {{that it may have}} been in the possession of at least two of them. It was owned by John Leland, the antiquary, in the 1540s. It probably became available after the dissolution of the monasteries, in which the property of many religious houses was confiscated and sold. Leland died in 1552 and it is known to have been in the possession of Matthew Parker from some <b>time</b> <b>after</b> <b>that</b> until his own death in 1575. Although Parker bequeathed most of his library to Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, the Cotton manuscript was not included. By 1600, it was in the library of Lord Lumley and by 1621 the manuscript was in the possession of Robert Cotton. The Cotton library was moved in 1712 from Cotton House in Westminster to Essex House in the Strand and then moved again in 1730 to Ashburnham House in Westminster. On the morning of Saturday, 23 October 1731, a fire broke out and the Cotton manuscript was destroyed.|$|E

25|$|Historically, Deaf {{culture has}} often been {{acquired}} within schools for Deaf students and within Deaf social clubs, both of which unite deaf people into communities with which they can identify. Becoming Deaf culturally can occur at different times for different people, depending on the circumstances of one's life.

25|$|Coconut palms were {{introduced}} to the area during the colonial period from the Philippines. For some <b>time</b> <b>after</b> <b>that,</b> they were the major cash crop. Coconut plantations still dominate the landscape along almost all of the coast, and the drying of coconut kernels (copra) is one of few widespread industries in the area. Other crops that are raised in the area include corn, tropical fruit, sesame seed, citrus fruit, melons, tamarind and hibiscus flowers, with rice and sugar cane grown in Tecpan. Livestock raising is dominated by meat and dairy cattle, although the production of honey is a traditional product as well. There is a beehive construction industry in Atoyac.|$|E

The band found the contract unacceptable and instead contacted Elton John's manager, John Reid, who accepted the position.|$|E
25|$|Subsequent {{research}} has uncovered {{more about the}} manuscript. In 1977, librarian Father Kallistos Dourvas removed the two pages containing the text from the book to photograph and re-catalog them. However, the re-cataloging never happened; Kallistos later told Charles W. Hedrick and Nikolaus Olympiou that the pages were then kept separately alongside the book at least {{until his retirement in}} 1990. Some <b>time</b> <b>after</b> <b>that,</b> however, the pages were put elsewhere, and various attempts to locate them since that time have been unsuccessful. Olympiou suggests that individuals at the Patriarchate Library may be withholding the pages due to Morton Smith's sensational use of them. Father Kallistos gave his color photographs of the manuscript to Hedrick and Olympiou, who published them in The Fourth R in 2000.|$|E
25|$|Colheita or Harvest – This style {{includes}} {{wines from}} a single vintage, but aged for a shorter period than true Vintage Madeira. The wine can be labeled with a vintage date, but includes the word colheita on it.

At that point, the wine can command a higher price than if it were still to be bottled as Colheita. This differs to Colheita Port which is a minimum of seven years of age before bottling.|$|E

25|$|The Assyrians had utterly {{destroyed}} the Elamite nation, but new polities {{emerged in the}} area after Assyrian power faded. Among the nations that benefited from {{the decline of the}} Assyrians were the Iranian tribes, whose presence around Lake Urmia to the north of Elam is attested from the 9th century BC in Assyrian texts. Some <b>time</b> <b>after</b> <b>that</b> region fell to Madius the Scythian (653 BC), Teispes son of Achaemenes conquered Elamite Anshan in the mid 7th century BC, forming a nucleus that would expand into the Persian Empire. They were largely regarded as vassals of the Assyrians, and the Medes, Mannaeans and Persians paid tribute to Assyria from the 10th century BC until the death of Ashurbanipal in 627 BC. After his death the Medes {{played a major role in}} the destruction of the weakened Assyrian Empire in 612 BC.|$|E
25|$|In 733, fourteen-year-old Yang Yuhuan married Li Mao, the Prince of Shou {{and the son}} of Emperor Xuanzong and Consort Wu. She thus {{carried the}} title of Princess of Shou.

Some <b>time</b> <b>after</b> <b>that,</b> however, Princess Yang somehow came into Xuanzong's favor and the Emperor decided to take her as his consort. However, since Princess Yang was already the wife of his son, Emperor Xuanzong stealthily {{arranged}} her to become a Taoist nun, with the tonsured name Taizhen, in order to prevent criticism that would affect his plan of making her his concubine. Yang then stayed, for a brief moment, as a Taoist nun in the palace itself, before Emperor Xuanzong made her an imperial consort after bestowing a new wife on his son Li Mao. Yang became the favorite consort of the Emperor.|$|E
25|$|Greek-speaking {{communities}} of the Hellenized East were instrumental in the spread of early Christianity in the 2nd and 3rd centuries, and Christianity's early leaders and writers (notably St Paul) were mostly Greek-speaking, though generally not from Greece itself. The New Testament was written in Greek, {{and some of its}} sections (Corinthians, Thessalonians, Philippians, Revelation of St. John of Patmos) attest to the importance of churches in Greece in early Christianity. Nevertheless, much of Greece clung tenaciously to paganism, and ancient Greek religious practices were still in vogue in the late 4th century AD, when they were outlawed by the Roman emperor Theodosius I in 391–392. The last recorded Olympic games were held in 393, and many temples were destroyed or damaged in the century that followed. In Athens and rural areas, paganism is attested well into the sixth century AD and even later. The closure of the Neoplatonic Academy of Athens by the emperor Justinian in 529 is considered by many to mark the end of antiquity, although there is evidence that the Academy continued its activities for some <b>time</b> <b>after</b> <b>that.</b> Some remote areas such as the southeastern Peloponnese remained pagan until well into the 10th century AD.|$|E
