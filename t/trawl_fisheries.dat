5|$|Bottom-dwelling and sedentary, the Tasmanian {{numbfish}} feeds {{mainly on}} polychaete worms and crustaceans. As in all numbfishes, it {{can produce a}} moderate electric shock to defend itself against predators. This species gives live birth, with the unborn young sustained to term by yolk; the litter size ranges from one to eight. The Tasmanian numbfish is a common bycatch of <b>trawl</b> <b>fisheries.</b> However, its population {{does not appear to}} be threatened by human activity and it has been assessed as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E
5|$|Favoring soft-bottomed habitats, the {{peppered}} maskray is a bottom-dwelling predator consuming mainly crustaceans (particularly caridean shrimp) and polychaete worms. It is viviparous, with litter {{sizes of}} one to three. The females supply their developing young with histotroph ("uterine milk") during gestation. Although the peppered maskray is a frequent bycatch of bottom <b>trawl</b> <b>fisheries,</b> it is still common and significant portions of its population appear to lie within unfished waters. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|Inhabiting shallow, sandy areas near rocky reefs, the Japanese sleeper ray is a bottom-dwelling {{predator}} of invertebrates. Like {{other members}} of its family, it can produce a strong electric shock from its electric organs for defensive purposes. Females give live birth to litters of up to five pups. The gestating young are sustained at first by yolk, and later by histotroph ("uterine milk"). The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species as Vulnerable, due to its susceptibility to <b>trawl</b> <b>fisheries</b> that operate intensively throughout its range.|$|E
40|$|The Netherlands Institute for Fisheries Research {{has been}} {{commissioned}} by the Dutch Fisheries Product Board {{to carry out a}} study on the effects of twin <b>trawl</b> <b>fishery</b> on the sustainable exploitation of demersal fish stocks. The twin <b>trawl</b> <b>fishery</b> appears to grow quickly, but there are many uncertainties about {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} this fishery on fish stocks. Advantages due to the light type of gear are the low use of fuel, the high quality of landings and the relatively low disturbance of the seabed. Negative effects mentioned are the large surface that is fished, which would result in high catches and large numbers of discards. Moreover, under certain conditions, twin trawlers are allowed to use smaller mesh sizes than beam trawlers, which may result in more discards of undersized fish. This study aims at making an objective and quantitative description of the twin <b>trawl</b> <b>fishery</b> in the Netherlands and consists of three parts: 1) a description of technical and fishery biological aspects; 2) a study on discards (part of the catch returned to the sea) and; 3) an integrated description of the twin <b>trawl</b> <b>fishery</b> and a comparison with the beam <b>trawl</b> <b>fishery.</b> The present report describes the second part: discarding in the twin <b>trawl</b> <b>fishery.</b> This report gives an overview of the discarding practices in the twin <b>trawl</b> <b>fishery</b> in the Netherlands...|$|R

40|$|Extract] The Queensland Finfish (Stout Whiting) <b>Trawl</b> <b>Fishery</b> (FTF) is a {{demersal}} otter <b>trawl</b> <b>fishery.</b> The FTF {{is permitted}} to target stout whiting (Sillago robusta) and red spot whiting (Sillago flindersi) and retain other permitted by-product species off southern Queensland, from Sandy Cape south to Caloundra (see Figure 1). Stout whiting also constitute a proportion of the bycatch from the Queensland East Coast Otter <b>Trawl</b> <b>Fishery</b> (ECOTF) and a proportion of retained catch in the New South Wales Ocean Prawn <b>Trawl</b> <b>Fishery</b> (NSW OPTF).

5|$|Like {{other members}} of its family, the onefin {{electric}} ray can defend itself with a strong electric shock produced {{from a pair of}} kidney-shaped electric organs beside its head. It feeds mainly on polychaete worms, and likely gives birth to live young. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) presently lacks enough information to assess the conservation status of this species. It is often caught incidentally by bottom <b>trawl</b> <b>fisheries</b> off South Africa, and may also be impacted by pollution from coastal development.|$|E
5|$|The diet of {{the sand}} devil {{consists}} mainly of small teleost fishes and squid, which are captured via ambush attack. This species is viviparous, with the unborn young nourished by their yolk sacs. Females have a multi-year reproductive cycle and give birth to 4–25 pups in spring or early summer, following a 12-month gestation period. The sand devil is not aggressive, but may attempt to bite if harassed or captured. Though not valued economically, it is caught incidentally by commercial bottom <b>trawl</b> <b>fisheries.</b> The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) presently lacks sufficient information to assess the conservation status of this species.|$|E
5|$|Angel sharks {{in general}} are highly {{threatened}} by commercial <b>trawl</b> <b>fisheries</b> due to their susceptibility to capture and low rate of reproduction, and angel shark species elsewhere {{are known to have}} declined markedly under fishing pressure. Trawling activity in the Yellow Sea {{and other parts of the}} northwestern Pacific is intense and, coupled with pollution, has had a serious impact on the local ecosystem. The Japanese angelshark population is suspected to have declined by up to 50% or more under these conditions, leading the species to be assessed as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). It may benefit from a ban on trawling imposed in some areas by the Chinese government, though enforcement is inconsistent.|$|E

5|$|The main {{conservation}} {{threat to}} the plain maskray is incidental capture by commercial bottom <b>trawl</b> <b>fisheries.</b> In the present day, this is mostly caused by Australia's Northern Prawn Fishery, which operates throughout its range. Although this species is discarded when caught, it is more delicate-bodied than other maskrays and is thus unlikely to survive encounters with trawling gear. Historically, this species {{may also have been}} negatively affected by Japanese, Chinese, and Taiwanese trawlers that fished intensively off northern Australia from 1959 to 1990. These factors, coupled with the plain maskray's limited distribution and low reproductive rate, have resulted in its being assessed as Near Threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E
5|$|Small {{bony fishes}} {{are the main}} prey of the nervous shark, while crustaceans, molluscs, and snakes may also be eaten. It is viviparous, with the {{developing}} embryos nourished through a placental connection. The details of its life history seem to vary depending on latitudefor example, {{the timing of the}} breeding season and the length of the gestation period. Females produce litters of one to six young either annually or biennially. The harmless nervous shark is caught incidentally by coastal gillnet fisheries and perhaps also by line and <b>trawl</b> <b>fisheries.</b> The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lacks sufficient data to assess the conservation status of this species except in Australian waters, where its population seems healthy and has been listed under Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature has {{listed the}} milk shark under Least Concern; despite being heavily fished, {{it has a}} wide {{distribution}} and remains fairly common. The reproductive characteristics of this species suggests {{it is capable of}} withstanding a somewhat high level of exploitation, though not as much as the grey sharpnose shark (R. oligolinx) or Australian sharpnose shark (R. taylori). In the 1980s and early 1990s, stock assessments of the milk shark off India's Verval coast concluded catches by gillnet and <b>trawl</b> <b>fisheries</b> were below the maximum sustainable level. However, these studies were based on methodologies that have subsequently been proven unreliable for shark populations.

When caught, the masked stingaree usually survives to be discarded, though the tendency of captured stingarees to abort their young merits concern. Given the limited conservation threats faced by this common species, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it under Least Concern.
