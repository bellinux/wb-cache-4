40|$|Abstract. The rapid {{development}} of the large steel structure brings {{a great opportunity for}} steelmaking industry. The steel plates not only have the strength and toughness but also can withstand the high energy input welding. Using the magnesium oxide of high melting-point and high stability to pin the grain boundaries is an effective method to improve the welding performance of the structure steel. The effect of magnesium addition on the morphology and composition of <b>the</b> <b>inclusions</b> in <b>the</b> cast microstructure of HSLA steel was analyzed. The results show that the distribution of <b>the</b> <b>inclusions</b> is more dense and uniform with respect to the raw steel, and the size of <b>the</b> <b>inclusions</b> is smaller than the ones in the raw steel after adding magnesium elements. Adding magnesium element in different amounts can lead to the large difference in the composition of <b>the</b> <b>inclusions.</b> <b>The</b> main components of <b>the</b> <b>inclusions</b> formed are magnesium oxides and <b>the</b> composite <b>inclusions,</b> as well as the oxides, sulfides and composite <b>inclusions</b> of <b>the</b> other metallic elements.

The infrared (IR) transmission microscope was used to quantify <b>the</b> <b>inclusions</b> in CZT, grown by modified vertical Bridgman technique (MVB). Precipitates were unable to resolve due to their small size (4 μm in diameters. Different solid-liquid growth interface shapes were analyzed to study their effects on the size and concentration of <b>the</b> <b>inclusions.</b> Application of various cooling schemes during crystal growths had significant effects on the size and concentration of <b>the</b> <b>inclusions.</b> Quenching and fast cooling resulted in reduced diameters of <b>the</b> <b>inclusions</b> and relatively better crystal properties. Analyses the effects of impurities on the detector properties were performed and attempts were made to establish the correlation between the impurities and the μτ.
