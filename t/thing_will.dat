5|$|A major subplot {{involves}} George (Richardo Keens-Douglas), a French {{teacher and}} former intimate of Zero's. George is losing his sight to cytomegalovirus and {{is taking a}} drug that is manufactured by a company that, {{as a member of}} ACT UP, George is protesting. George struggles through the film to resolve his conflicted feelings over this, his guilt over abandoning Zero during the final days of his illness and his fear that the same <b>thing</b> <b>will</b> happen to him.|$|E

Then, the prohibitions will be violated in (the month of) al-Muharram. Then, there will be sound in (the month of) Safar, then the tribes will conflict {{with each other in}} the two months of Rabi' al-awwal & Rabi' al-thani.

5|$|Avicenna {{distinguishes between}} {{a thing that}} needs an {{external}} cause in order to exista contingent thingand a thing that is guaranteed to exist by its essence or intrinsic naturea necessary existent. The argument, or proof, tries to prove that there is indeed a necessary existent. It does this by first considering whether the opposite could be true: that everything that exists is contingent. Each contingent <b>thing</b> <b>will</b> need something other than itself to bring it into existence, which will in turn need another cause to bring it into existence, and so on. Because this seemed to lead to an infinite regress, cosmological arguments before Avicenna concluded that some necessary cause (such as God) is needed to end the infinite chain. However, Avicenna's argument does not preclude {{the possibility of an}} infinite regress.|$|E

25|$|The many {{different}} terms for vows and pledges used in Kol Nidrei can be confusing, especially because the English language is poor in short equivalent terms that express the same nuances. These terms are almost exclusively religious pledges of various kinds: That something {{will be done}} (or not done) or given {{in exchange for a}} prayer being answered, that something will be done (or not done) for religious purposes or to show religious devotion, that a <b>thing</b> <b>will</b> be used only for religious purposes (e.g., as a tool used for building or repairing the Temple) and never for mundane purposes, that a <b>thing</b> <b>will</b> be given to the Temple or treated as if it were already given to the Temple, and so forth; and to make this declaration all the more clear, every possible synonym for such pledging and for nullification or cancellation of such pledges is used.|$|E
25|$|In 2011. the {{constitutional}} court declared current Statute as unconstitutional, because {{the numbers of}} deputies from city districts don't match the number of voters in each district.

Moore, the Principal Deputy High Representative, emphasized the importance of the urgent acts towards adoption of the new, constitutional Statute.|$|E
25|$|The storyline {{reached its}} climax in March 2003. On-screen the character’s plans to abscond with Ricky {{and her son}} (on the night of her {{surprise}} birthday party) were thwarted by Barry’s discovery of the affair – leading to a public confrontation between the three protagonists. Shaun Williamson who played Barry has commented “Barry is absolutely devastated as his whole life is ripped apart. He can’t believe Nat has betrayed him. He loves his life with Natalie and Jack, and {{would do anything to}} make it work as a family again. Losing Natalie is going to be really difficult for Barry, but I think the hardest <b>thing</b> <b>will</b> be losing his son.” The storyline signified the end of the characters’ three-year marriage and in a final plot twist Natalie opted to finish with Ricky and leave Walford alone, having discovered that he had recently slept with his ex-wife Samantha.|$|E

Mayor Harvey Nelson explained: [...] "The ad is too much; that's just not true. There's objection that this whole <b>thing</b> <b>will</b> be spreading fear in the community.

I saw a grown woman grab her breasts and speak like a baby, complaining her nipples hurt. This kind of <b>thing</b> <b>will</b> set you back".

500|$|In these series, Van Gogh was not preoccupied by {{his usual}} {{interest}} in filling his paintings with subjectivity and emotion; rather the two series {{are intended to}} display his technical skill and working methods to Gauguin, {{who was about to}} visit. The 1888 paintings were created during a rare period of optimism for the artist. Vincent wrote to Theo in August 1888, [...] "I'm painting with the gusto of a Marseillais eating bouillabaisse, which won't surprise you when it's a question of painting large sunflowers... If I carry out this plan there'll be a dozen or so panels. The whole <b>thing</b> <b>will</b> therefore be a symphony in blue and yellow. I work on it all these mornings, from sunrise. Because the flowers wilt quickly and it's a matter of doing the whole thing in one go." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{script is}} also {{thought to have}} been {{inspired}} by Lynch's fear of fatherhood; his daughter Jennifer had been born with [...] "severely clubbed feet", requiring extensive corrective surgery as a child. Jennifer has said that her own unexpected conception and birth defects were the basis for the film's themes. The film's tone was also shaped by Lynch's time living in a troubled neighborhood in Philadelphia. Lynch and his family spent five years living in an atmosphere of [...] "violence, hate and filth". The area was rife with crime, inspiring the bleak urban backdrop of Eraserhead. Describing this period of his life, Lynch said, [...] "I saw so many things in Philadelphia I couldn't believe... I saw a grown woman grab her breasts and speak like a baby, complaining her nipples hurt. This kind of <b>thing</b> <b>will</b> set you back".

500|$|McAdams {{appeared}} in three other 2015 films. She starred with her Wedding Crashers co-star Bradley Cooper, Emma Stone and John Krasinski in Cameron Crowe's romantic comedy-drama Aloha. She played the ex-girlfriend of Cooper's character, {{who is married}} to Krasinski's character with two children. While the film received a negative reaction and controversy from critics and audiences alike, McAdams was praised. Wesley Morris of Grantland remarked: [...] "Someone who can speak Crowe’s language really helps. McAdams might be the best he’s ever had ... puts the perfect amount of air in her lines, giving the words a lightness that conflates optimism, amusement, and resignation. She’s never seemed lovelier, more instinctive, or more present." [...] Mark Olsen of the Los Angeles Times felt she [...] "plays likely the strongest, most rounded female character Crowe has ever written, a woman suddenly {{face to face with the}} life she has and the one she might have had, and the actress brings a grounded, unforced earthiness to the role that is a joy to watch." [...] She co-starred with Jake Gyllenhaal in the boxing drama Southpaw (2015), where she played the wife of Gyllenhaal's character. The film received mixed reviews but A.O. Scott of The New York Times conceded: [...] "It features some pretty appealing players. There are worse things to see at the multiplex than Ms. McAdams playing a tough cookie standing by her man." [...] She co-starred with James Franco, Charlotte Gainsbourg and Marie-Josée Croze in Wim Wenders's drama Every <b>Thing</b> <b>Will</b> Be Fine. The film received an U.S. limited release in December 2015. Guy Lodge of Variety remarked: [...] "Poor McAdams, sporting sensible hair and a truly mystifying cod-Continental accent, continues her thankless run of needy, tossed-aside love interests in big-name auteur projects." ...|$|E

He {{goes on to say that}} America has failed to limit the immigration of Chinese and restrict their contact, especially sexual, with the presumed European stock. He states [...] "if they mix they must form a bad hybrid" [...] regarding the issue of Chinese and (ethnically European) Americans. Spencer ends his letter with the following blanket statement against all immigration: [...] "In either case, supposing the immigration to be large, immense social mischief must arise, and eventually social disorganization. The same <b>thing</b> <b>will</b> happen if there should be any considerable mixture of European or American races with the Japanese." ...|$|E
