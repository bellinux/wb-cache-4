500|$|In a cold open, Sonic is {{pursuing}} his nemesis, Doctor Eggman, bounding around {{a fleet of}} spaceships. After the defeat of several of his robots, Sonic transforms into Super Sonic. After a brief chase through the airships, Sonic corners Eggman. However, Eggman manages to trap him using a powerful new ray weapon which drains {{the power of the}} Chaos Emeralds, causing them <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>grey</b> and useless. He then uses the Emeralds' energy to fire an enormous laser and unleash a powerful beast, Dark Gaia, {{from the center of the}} planet, which has devastating consequences, shattering the planet into seven pieces. In addition, the ray and drained Chaos Emeralds have the unforeseen side-effect of transforming Sonic into a [...] "Werehog" [...] — a beast form with greater strength and abilities — at night. Eggman then ejects Sonic into space, who then lands safely onto the planet below.|$|E
2500|$|Kitchener {{was worried}} that, {{although}} his moustache was bleached white by the sun, {{his blond hair}} refused <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>grey,</b> {{making it harder for}} Egyptians to take him seriously. His appearance added to his mystique: his long legs made him appear taller, whilst a cast in his eye made people feel he was looking right through them. Kitchener, at 6'2", towered over most of his contemporaries. Sir Evelyn Baring, the de facto British ruler of Egypt, thought Kitchener “the most able (soldier) I have come across in my time”. In 1890, a War Office evaluation of Kitchener concluded: [...] "A good brigadier, very ambitious, not popular, but has of late greatly improved in tact and manner...a fine gallant soldier and good linguist and very successful in dealing with Orientals" [...]|$|E
60|$|The horrible {{instrument}} of torture was brought. It was constantly used to extract confession {{from the poor}} Covenanters during the long years of persecution of that black period of Scottish history. Peter's thumbs were placed in it and the screw was turned. The monsters increased the pressure by slow degrees, repeating the question at each turn of the screw. At first Peter bore the pain unmoved, but at last it became so excruciating that his cheeks and lips seemed <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>grey,</b> and an appalling shriek burst from him at last.|$|E
60|$|Monmouth {{looked up}} quickly, his {{beautiful}} eyes ineffably sad, his weak mouth drooping at the corners. Wade <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> confront <b>Grey.</b>|$|R
25|$|Part of {{the convoy}} ran into {{drifting}} ice in thick weather of the Denmark Strait. Two merchant ships were damaged and had <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> back. <b>Grey</b> Ranger was also damaged, her speed reduced to , {{and since it}} was doubtful if she could face heavy weather, {{it was decided to}} transfer her to the fuelling position northeast of Jan Mayen in exchange for the RFA Aldersdale.|$|R
50|$|Sphagnurus paluster is {{a species}} of fungus in the family Lyophyllaceae which parasitizes Sphagnum moss. It was first {{described}} by Charles Horton Peck in 1872. It is commonly called the Sphagnum Greyling due to it being found in peat bogs and <b>to</b> its cap <b>turning</b> <b>grey</b> as it ages and dries.|$|R
6000|$|When {{the old man}} waggles {{his head}} and says, [...] "Ah, so I thought when I was your age," [...] he has proved the youth's case. Doubtless, whether from growth of {{experience}} or decline of animal heat, he thinks so no longer; but he thought so while he was young; and all men have thought so while they were young, since there was dew {{in the morning or}} hawthorn in May; and here is another young man adding his vote to those of previous generations and rivetting another link to the chain of testimony. It is as natural and as right for a young man to be imprudent and exaggerated, to live in swoops and circles, and beat about his cage like any other wild thing newly captured, as it is for old men <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>grey,</b> or mothers to love their offspring, or heroes to die for something worthier than their lives.|$|E
60|$|Unfortunately, however, {{this was}} not the exact truth, for already poor Jess's teeth were {{chattering}} with cold. Soon, indeed, weary as they were, they found {{that the only way to}} keep their blood moving was to tramp continually up and down. After an hour and a half of this exercise, the breeze dropped and the temperature became more suitable to their lightly clad, half-starved, and almost exhausted bodies. Then the moon came up, and the hyenas, or wolves, or some such animals, came up also and howled round them--though they could not see them. These hyenas proved more than Jess's nerves would bear, and at last she condescended to ask John to share her ant-heap: where they sat, shivering in each other's arms, throughout the livelong night. Indeed, had it not been for the warmth they gathered from each other, it is probable that they might have fared even worse than they did; for, though the days were hot, the nights were now beginning to be cold on the high veldt, especially when, as at present, the air had recently been chilled by the passage of a heavy tempest. Another drawback to their romantic situation was that they were positively soaked with the falling dew. There they sat, or rather cowered, for hour after hour without sleeping, for sleep was impossible, and almost without speaking; and yet, notwithstanding the wretchedness of their circumstances, not altogether unhappy, since they were united in their misery. At last the eastern sky began <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>grey,</b> and John rose, shook the dew from his hat and clothes, and limped off as well as his half-frozen limbs would allow to catch the horses, which were standing together some yards away, looking huge and ghost-like in the mist. By sunrise he had managed to saddle them up, and they started once more. This time, however, he was obliged to lift Jess on to the saddle.|$|E
5000|$|According to Williams, [...] "They {{have a very}} flat face, a wide muzzle {{and their}} brow-ridge runs {{straight}} across and overhangs. They seem <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>grey</b> very early in life, but instead of turning grey-black like a gorilla, they turn grey all over." [...] They develop uniform grey fur independently of age and sex, which suggests that greying takes place early in life (whereas in all known gorilla species, only males gray as they age and graying is restricted to their backs).|$|E
60|$|The rest of {{the night}} he made no sound. The {{darkness}} <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>grey,</b> and on the colourless, clear, glassy dawn the jagged sierra stood out flat and opaque, as if cut out of paper.|$|R
25|$|The pupa is dimorphic {{with regards}} to colour, with the colour {{developing}} according to the prevalent colour and texture in the background. The green morph, which is found amongst green vegetation and smoother textures, is light green and unmarked or with yellow dorsal markings. When situated among brown or dry objects, the pupa tend <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> light <b>grey</b> brown <b>to</b> pink brown and develop cryptic dark brown and black striation.|$|R
60|$|King Bumble {{lived with}} the family until his woolly head became as white as his face was black; and Jacko--poor little Jacko--lived so long, that he became big, {{but he did not}} become less amiable, or less {{addicted}} <b>to</b> thieving. He <b>turned</b> <b>grey</b> at last and became as blind as a bat, and finally crawled about the house, enfeebled by old age, and wrapped in a flannel dressing-gown.|$|R
5000|$|... "He is {{a middle-aged}} man, of pretty stout proportions, {{has a long}} {{intellectual}} face, with beard and moustache and a fine prominent forehead, hair dark rather inclining <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>grey.</b> The first thing that strikes you on his face is a dash of care and anxiety, almost pain, as if arising from physical suffering - he has rheumatism. He never prepares his lectures beforehand. He thus often stumbles or fails to prove what he wishes at the moment, and at every such failure he is sure to make some characteristic remark." ...|$|E
50|$|Boris Akunin {{provides}} {{the reader with}} a vivid portrait of Erast Fandorin. Fandorin is of average height, with a thin build. He has a small moustache, blue eyes and black hair. The {{death of his wife}} caused his hair <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>grey</b> at the temples almost overnight, as described in The Winter Queen. It also caused him to stammer, but this tends to diminish as tensions rise. Fandorin is always impeccably groomed and can be vain about his appearance; in The Winter Queen he wears a corset to improve his figure. He is a gifted linguist; in various novels he speaks English, French, German and Japanese with fluency, as well as a working knowledge of both Serbian and Turkish in The Turkish Gambit.|$|E
5000|$|In June 2008, {{after being}} charged with various counts of fraud and money laundering, Brown fled bail and an arrest warrant was {{subsequently}} issued. the charges or Fraud and money laundering were later discharged by the judge at trial [...] Brown was last known to live in Templewood Avenue, Hampstead, north-west London. He told various former clients he had been suffering from cancer, then took the surname Campbell-Brown and stopped shaving, before he disappeared. Neighbours of his Hampstead flat {{said that in the}} weeks before he disappeared he had changed his appearance by growing a full beard instead of his usual goatee and allowed his usually blond-dyed hair <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>grey.</b> His lawyer disputed claims that Brown changed his appearance to abscond.|$|E
60|$|And {{with that}} he and then she fell into a passion of weeping. They clung very tightly together--closer {{than they had been}} since ever the first {{brightness}} of their married days <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> the <b>grey</b> of common life again.|$|R
6000|$|Out {{of sight}} {{is out of}} mind: [...] Long have man and woman-kind, [...] Heavy of will and light of mood, [...] Taken away our wheaten food, [...] Taken away our Altar stone; [...] Hail and rain and thunder alone, [...] And red hearts we <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>grey,</b> [...] Are true till Time gutter away.|$|R
60|$|She was {{speaking}} with apparent calm now, in a dull and monotonous voice, her eyes fixed upon the distant {{line of the}} horizon, where the glowing sun had at last sunk to rest. The brilliant orange and blood-red of the sky had yielded to a colder crimson tint--it, too, was now slowly <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> <b>grey.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Since {{at least}} the mid-19th century, doctors have known that silver or silver {{compounds}} can cause {{some areas of the}} skin and other body tissues <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>grey</b> or blue-grey. [...] Argyria occurs in people who ingest or inhale silver in large quantities over a long period (several months to many years). People who work in factories that manufacture silver products can also breathe in silver or its compounds. In the past, some of these workers have become argyric. However, the level of silver in the air and the length of exposure that caused argyria in these workers is not known. Historically, colloidal silver, a liquid suspension of microscopic silver particles, was also used as an internal medication to treat a variety of diseases. In the 1940s, they were overtaken by the use of pharmaceutical antibiotics, such as penicillin.|$|E

50|$|The bird is 13-14 cm (5 in) {{with a long}} {{tail and}} robust beak. The upper back and rump are olive green. The head is dark grey and the tail and wings are blackish. The eyes have a partial white eye-ring and a white stripe going down towards the beak. The underparts are white, <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> <b>grey</b> on the flanks.|$|R
6000|$|At {{that moment}} a tall figure in {{mourning}} entered, attended by a policeman. For the first time, Mauleverer's coolness gave way, though not his readiness, and, <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> Mr. <b>Grey,</b> he exclaimed, [...] "Sir, {{you do not}} intend to be misled by the malignity of a person of this description." ...|$|R
60|$|All the {{motionless}} men had {{the ghostly}} sensation {{of the presence}} of some new person; and Merton was scarcely surprised when he looked up and saw the pale face of Armstrong's daughter over Father Brown's shoulder. She was still young and beautiful in a silvery style, but her hair was of so dusty and hueless a brown that in some shadows it seemed <b>to</b> have <b>turned</b> totally <b>grey.</b>|$|R
50|$|The black slug is {{generally}} deep black, with some adults being brown or even white. Generally, pigmentation darkens directly with increasing latitude. Young specimens {{tend to be}} brown or ivory whitish, <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> <b>grey</b> before becoming characteristically black at maturity. Rust-brown individuals are arguably classified as a separate species Arion rufus (Red Slug). And the two can only be distinguished by dissecting the reproductive anatomy.|$|R
60|$|There was no pause, no pity, no peace, no {{interval}} of relenting rest, no measurement of time. Though {{days and nights}} circled as regularly as when time was young, and the evening and morning were the first day, other count of time there was none. Hold of it {{was lost in the}} raging fever of a nation, {{as it is in the}} fever of one patient. Now, breaking the unnatural silence of a whole city, the executioner showed the people the head of the king--and now, it seemed almost in the same breath, the head of his fair wife which had had eight weary months of imprisoned widowhood and misery, <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> it <b>grey.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Brother Fire {{was still}} red in his heart, but he <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>grey</b> as they {{scattered}} him. [...] "Brother Fire!" [...] they screamed. But he whispered and passed, {{and there was}} nothing but ashes. Then Ugh-lomi danced with anger and struck the ashes with his fist. But Eudena began to hammer the firestone against a flint. And the eyes of each were turning ever and again towards the gully by which Andoo was climbing down. Brother Fire! ...|$|R
50|$|The main {{target of}} this {{pathogen}} {{is the central}} vascular cylinder of the roots. The common symptom that gives P. fragariae the nickname of “red core rot” is the red discoloration of these roots. Due to the infection, the stele of the root <b>turns</b> a wine <b>to</b> brick red, and starts to decay and die from the tip upwards. Red color of the roots does not necessarily guarantee the presence of P. fragariae infection. The most dependable way {{to determine if a}} plant has P. fragariae is the presence of microscopic oospores. Another symptom of P. fragariae is badly rooted lateral roots, starting <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> a <b>grey</b> or brown color. Other roots are poorly developed. Root symptoms can be observed starting in late autumn, and young roots are particularly susceptible.|$|R
50|$|The skin of both {{female and}} male vasas turns yellow during the {{breeding}} season, and there is often feather loss. However in females the feather loss can result in complete baldness. Another interesting feature of the females breeding physiology is when her feathers, which are usually black <b>to</b> <b>grey,</b> <b>turn</b> brown without a moult. This {{is caused by the}} redistribution of melanin, which is the pigment that makes the vasas' feathers black.|$|R
50|$|Encountered as a many-branched {{spreading}} shrub 0.5 - 1.3 m {{high and}} 2.5 m wide, Banksia candolleana has linear leaves 15 - 40 cm long and 0.6-2 cm wide. The leaves are green and shiny with deep triangular lobed margins. Appearing from April to July (autumn to winter), the squat inflorescences arise on short lateral branchlets and are golden yellow in colour. Ovoid in shape, they are 5.5-7.5 cm wide. As the flower spikes age, they <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>grey</b> and 1-5 large follicles develop.|$|R
5000|$|The stipe is 3-26 cm long, and 0.5-1 cm thick. It is central, flexuous, {{cylindric}} {{or slightly}} flattened, and hollow. It can be white <b>to</b> <b>grey,</b> <b>turning</b> yellowish, blue, and black in age. The entire stem {{is covered with}} many white scales which are more pronounced in {{the lower part of}} the stipe. The partial veil is white and , disappearing in age. Often a long [...] can be found attached the base of the stipe. Strongly bruising blue then black where damaged.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 13-20 mm {{for males}} and 14-20.5 mm for females. The costa of the forewings is pale buff, <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> dark <b>grey</b> basally. There are five grey fasciae, the proximal pair cross the distal end of the cell, the distal pair pass from near the apex to about three-fourths {{the distance from the}} base along the anal margin and there is a simple subterminal fascia. The hindwings have the fasciae continuous with those of the forewings.|$|R
50|$|Ceiba chodatii is a {{medium-sized}} deciduous tree with a tall, stout, bare trunk. It grows to about 12 m tall, {{has a number}} of thick branches {{at the top of the}} swollen trunk and has a rounded crown. The bark is smooth with vertical ridges and horizontal wrinkles. It contains chlorophyll and is green when young and able <b>to</b> photosynthesize, but <b>turns</b> <b>grey</b> with age. It is covered with thick, woody conical spines. The alternate leaves are palmate with five lobes and serrated edges. The flowers are large, solitary and creamy white with a few purple flecks. They are up to 15 cm long with yellow-green calyces and funnel-shaped corollas with five fleshy, hairy petals joined at the base. The fruit is a large, oblong green capsule. When ripe it splits open to reveal black seeds surrounded by a mass of white fibres resembling cotton.|$|R
5000|$|Chilvers has {{released}} four albums {{under his own}} name - He Wrote This (a selection of mostly instrumental pieces played on bass guitars, double bass and Chapman Stick), Stormwatcher (the soundtrack to an [...] "imaginary film version" [...] of Graham Joyce's fantasy novel of the same name), Free (a virally marketed CD-R release of predominantly ambient pieces) and Piano (a collection of solo piano pieces). He is also the leader of A Marble Calm - an ambient-inclined music collective centred on himself and reclusive marimba/vibraphone player Jon Hart. Other participants have included Theo Travis, Tim Bowness, Sandra O'Neill, Steve Adey and Cambridge experimental-country guitarist Rob Jackson. This project {{has released}} two albums - Surfacing and Blue <b>Turns</b> <b>To</b> <b>Grey.</b>|$|R
50|$|This {{dark and}} crested cuckoo has {{chestnut}} wings, a glossy black crest and a graduated tail (the feathers shortening in {{steps from the}} center outwards) whose terminal edges are white and inconspicuous unlike the white tips of the Jacobin cuckoo which is found in parts of its range. The black capping on the head is broken from black of the back by a white collar that extends {{to the sides of}} the neck. The lower parts are rufous <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> dark <b>grey</b> towards the vent. Young birds are dusky with a scaly appearance to the wing feathers.|$|R
