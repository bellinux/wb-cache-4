50|$|Even {{when they}} were new, I-J's were marketed and had a {{reputation}} for being very graceful looking, well built, and engineered for performance. Iver Johnson sponsored the career of bicycle racing champion Marshall Taylor beginning in 1900. The most noted I-J model was the <b>truss-bridge</b> frame which featured a curved tube under the top tube to strengthen the frame for use on the rough roads of the early twentieth century. Bicycle production ceased in 1940 with the buildup of arms production prior to World War II.|$|E
50|$|The Crusher, the {{hydraulic}} press which tests {{the strength of}} each bridge and {{is the focal point}} of the competition, has a history of its own. The original Crusher was a hydraulic device which, after ten years of service, was damaged beyond repair in 1994 - exploding hydraulic fluid all over the judges and competitors while attempting to crush the <b>truss-bridge</b> designed by Hugues Rivard, who was a Masters student at BCEE. A mark remains on the ceiling of the Hall Building Alumni Auditorium from the incident, and the real capacity of Rivard's bridge remains a mystery. The next Crusher was a donation from Wainbee in 1994. It was a screw jack style mechanism controlled by a computer. It could apply loads of up to 6000 pounds. In 2000, Mechtronix Inc. donated a new Crusher, which has a 10-ton capacity. During the 2000 competition, a bridge resisted up to 1860 kgf. The winner, however, is the one that has the highest overall score in terms of capacity, esthetic value, and originality. For the 2010 competition a brand new crusher donated by Concordia's department of Building, Civil, and Environmental Engineering and is follows its origins and is again a hydraulic jack.|$|E
40|$|The {{project for}} the work of a new bridge over Pisuerga river is {{described}} in this article. &# 13; Considering how peculiar the topography of the place is, the idea of a <b>truss-bridge</b> is suggested, planning its construction thinking of the bearings that have to support the bridge and its constructive system, intending first its durability. Se describe el proyecto de obra del nuevo puente sobre el río Pisuerga. &# 13; Teniendo en cuenta lo peculiar de la topografía del lugar, se sugiere la idea de puente atirantado, planteándose su construcción en el tipo de apoyos que ha de presentar dicho puente y su sistema constructivo, considerando, de manera especial, su durabilidad...|$|E
