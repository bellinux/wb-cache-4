5|$|Evolve was Turtle Rock Studios' {{first major}} project {{after the company}} split from Valve Corporation in 2011. The concept for Evolve existed prior to the {{development}} of their previous game, Left 4 Dead. Inspired by hunting games such as Cabela's Big Game Hunter and Deer Hunter, <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> have prey that can strike back at the hunters. The monster design was originally intended to be esoteric but was later toned down. The game is powered by Crytek's CryEngine, as they believed that the engine is capable of creating the dark and dense forests featured in the game. Turtle Rock found difficulty when seeking publishers that could provide funding and marketing for the game. THQ was originally set to serve as the game's publisher, but the rights to the franchise and publishing duties were transferred to Take-Two Interactive after THQ filed for bankruptcy in late 2012.|$|E
25|$|Combi Coupé: A 2-door, 4-seat {{car with}} {{hatchback}} door at rear and, collapsible rear seats, resembling a fastback. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> maximize the carrying capacity without bargaining on the performance.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> {{integrate}} out lattice spins iteratively, {{generating a}} flow in couplings. But now the couplings are lattice energy coefficients. The {{fact that a}} continuum description exists guarantees that this iteration will converge to a fixed point when the temperature is tuned to criticality.|$|E
50|$|Pico {{should be}} {{interpreted}} as 'small', <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> create a small language for educational purposes.|$|R
50|$|In many cases, <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> {{create a}} {{resilient}} wheel. This function is now {{provided by the}} pneumatic tyre.|$|R
50|$|Originally, <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> make <b>the</b> Country Buggy an amphibious vehicle, however {{directives}} from VW Germany curtailed this vision.|$|R
25|$|Direct modelling, after Woodard. Here <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> {{estimate}} subsurface {{flows from}} direct inversion of the frequency-wavenumber correlations {{seen in the}} wavefield in the Fourier domain. Woodard gave a practical demonstration of {{the ability of the}} technique to recover near-surface flows from the f-mode part of the spectrum.|$|E
25|$|Mirror mazes, {{often found}} in {{amusement}} parks as well, contain large numbers of mirrors and sheets of glass. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> navigate the disorientating array without bumping into the walls. Mirrors in attractions like this are often made of Plexiglas as to assure {{that they do not}} break.|$|E
25|$|More technically, <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> {{start with}} a well-understood {{manifold}} M and perform surgery on it to produce a manifold M ′ having some desired property, {{in such a way}} that the effects on the homology, homotopy groups, or other interesting invariants of the manifold are known.|$|E
50|$|Platsr {{was created}} in 2009, {{at the request of}} the Swedish government. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> promote a more {{democratic}} historiography and to participate in this online.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> reduce <b>the</b> tonnage {{of short}} haul {{interurban}} trains by incorporating a guards van into a carriage rather than adding a dedicated guards van.|$|R
50|$|Five {{years earlier}} in 1909, a scheme had <b>been</b> devised <b>to</b> organise volunteers into Voluntary Aid Detachments (VAD). <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> provide {{supplementary}} {{aid for the}} Territorial Medical Services.|$|R
25|$|Counter attacking Football {{involves}} a team withdrawing players {{into their own}} half but ensuring that one or two players {{are committed to the}} attack. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> try to get strikers isolated from the defenders by lurking on the halfway line, and to create space for a quick break.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the season}} proper starts (usually from early November in the {{northern}} hemisphere, or May in the southern hemisphere), <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> drive the fox from the covert and pursue the scent that it leaves for long distances over open countryside. The northern hemisphere season continues through to March or April.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} {{application of}} finite differences is in numerical analysis, especially in numerical differential equations, which {{aim at the}} numerical solution of ordinary and partial differential equations respectively. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> replace the derivatives appearing in the differential equation by finite differences that approximate them. The resulting methods are called finite difference methods.|$|E
50|$|In mathematics, a Gödel {{code was}} the basis for the proof of Gödel's incompleteness theorem. Here, <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> map {{mathematical}} notation to a natural number (using a Gödel numbering).|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> use {{stem cells}} to grow new teeth that could replace missing teeth. The new tooth would {{be alive and}} nearly {{identical}} to the one that is missing.|$|R
5000|$|There is {{also the}} chromodynamic SU(3)C. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> restore parity by {{introducing}} a left-right symmetry. This is a group extension of Z2 (the left-right symmetry) byto the semidirect product ...|$|R
25|$|Wu {{transformed}} the optical energy from low powered {{light emitting diodes}} (LED) into electrical energy via a photoconductive surface. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> allow the LED to {{switch on and off}} the photoconductive material via its fine projection. As the optical pattern can be easily transformable through optical projection, this method allows a high flexibility of switching different optical landscapes.|$|E
25|$|A European patent (EP1369126A1) in 2003 by Bork records {{a method}} used for {{prevention}} of cancers {{and for the}} curative treatment of cancers and precancers such as DNA-mismatch repair deficient (MMR) sporadic tumours and HNPCC associated tumours. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> use immunotherapy with combinatorial mixtures of tumour-specific frameshift mutation-derived peptides to elicit a cytotoxic T-cell response specifically directed against tumour cells.|$|E
25|$|After {{this bit}} of fun to warm up the crowd the Sway Hood is then thrown up in the air. The rugby type scrum (or Sway to give it its {{official}} title) then converges on the Hood and the game starts in earnest. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> get the Sway Hood {{into one of the}} four pubs in either Haxey or Westwoodside.|$|E
6000|$|... "I thought," [...] said George--he {{was riding}} the single, Harris and I {{being a little}} ahead on <b>the</b> tandem--"that <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> train up <b>the</b> hills and ride down them." ...|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Shot {{from the}} music video of [...] "Ballerina", portraying Amuro sitting down on an armchair. Being a {{collaboration}} with Gucci and Vogue Japan, <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> explore <b>the</b> CGI production.|$|R
5000|$|The proper {{spelling}} of [...] "LacusCurtius" [...] is as {{a single}} CamelCase word, with no space; <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> avoid interfering with searches for the original Lacus Curtius in ancient Rome.|$|R
25|$|In December 1919, Major E. H. Armstrong gave {{publicity}} to {{an indirect}} {{method of obtaining}} short-wave amplification, called the super-heterodyne. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> reduce the incoming frequency, which may be, say 1,500,000 cycles (200 meters), to some suitable super-audible frequency that can be amplified efficiently, then passing this current through a radio frequency amplifier and finally rectifying and carrying on {{to one or two}} stages of audio frequency amplification.|$|E
25|$|The Maze procedure, first {{performed}} in 1987, {{is an effective}} invasive surgical treatment {{that is designed to}} create electrical blocks or barriers in the atria of the heart, forcing electrical impulses that stimulate the heartbeat to travel down to the ventricles. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> force abnormal electrical signals to move along one, uniform path to the lower chambers of the heart (ventricles), thus restoring the normal heart rhythm.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, the Jerusalem District Planning and Building Committee {{approved}} a new {{master plan for}} the Talpiot industrial zone, adding 600,000 square meters of construction including 3,500 new residential units {{on the edge of}} the industrial zone and more space for offices, industry and commerce. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> separate the residential, business and industrial sections of the neighborhood while boosting the presence of high-tech companies, academic institutions, offices, banquet halls, movie theaters, health clinics and art galleries.|$|E
50|$|TraveLibro <b>was</b> {{developed}} <b>to</b> build {{a travel}} community to share travel stories. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> cater to all travel needs on one app. The beta website went live on 15 August 2015 and app followed on 15 December, 2015. TraveLibro has launched it's live app and portal in April, 2017.|$|R
50|$|For {{the cover}} art, it <b>was</b> Criss' <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> paint {{half of his}} face in his {{original}} Kiss makeup, while leaving the other half plain. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> link past and present.|$|R
50|$|Norrvalla Fotbollförening {{was founded}} in 1996 after several {{meetings}} between representatives from the Vörå IF, Oravais IF, Maxmo Sportklubb and Hellnäs Bollklubb clubs. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> create an organisation specialising in football.|$|R
25|$|In {{computer}} sciences, {{and more}} particularly in artificial intelligence these mean field type genetic algorithms {{are used as}} random search heuristics that mimic {{the process of evolution}} to generate useful solutions to complex optimization problems. These stochastic search algorithms belongs to the class of Evolutionary models. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> propagate a population of feasible candidate solutions using mutation and selection mechanisms. The mean field interaction between the individuals is encapsulated in the selection and the cross-over mechanisms.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} places where an {{editorial}} hand appears absent altogether. Neologisms are continually coined, and sentences are paragraph-long and convoluted. Biography, history, propaganda, science, science fiction, and cinema are intertwined {{in the most}} confusing way. Perhaps <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> induce a slightly dissociated state, so that readers can be lulled into belief. If one did not already possess some background, this book would give no lucid history of anthropology or primatology.|$|E
25|$|The {{equivalent}} {{carbon content}} concept {{is used on}} ferrous materials, typically steel and cast iron, to determine various properties of the alloy when more than just carbon is used as an , which is typical. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> convert the percentage of alloying elements other than carbon to the equivalent carbon percentage, because the iron-carbon phases are better understood than other iron-alloy phases. Most commonly this concept is used in welding, {{but it is also}} used when heat treating and casting cast iron.|$|E
50|$|OpenPicus {{was founded}} by Claudio Carnevali and Gabriele Allegria during 2011. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> create a {{hardware}} and software open platform {{to speed up the}} development of professional IoT devices and services.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} title was [...] "Hairy Potter and the Evil Robot Monkey", which she <b>was</b> requested <b>to</b> change by the editor, as <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> create a real {{story for the}} joke title.|$|R
5000|$|The story {{follows the}} crewmembers {{of the vessel}} [...] "Juliana", {{bringing}} products from foreign ports into Sweden in time for Christmas. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> show how Swedish Christmas celebrations rely on international trade.|$|R
