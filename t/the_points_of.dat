5|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>of</b> {{interest}} of the English cathedrals {{is the way in}} which much of the history of medieval architecture can be demonstrated within a single building, which typically has important parts constructed in several different centuries with no attempt whatever to make the later work match or follow through on an earlier plan. For this reason a comprehensive architectural chronology must jump backwards and forwards from one building to another. Only at one building, Salisbury Cathedral, is stylistic unity demonstrated.|$|E

5|$|Among constant-width shapes with a given width, the Reuleaux {{triangle}} has {{the minimum}} {{area and the}} sharpest (smallest) possible angle (120°) at its corners. By several numerical measures it is the farthest from being centrally symmetric. It provides the largest constant-width shape avoiding <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>of</b> an integer lattice, and {{is closely related to}} the shape of the quadrilateral maximizing the ratio of perimeter to diameter. It can perform a complete rotation within a square while at all times touching all four sides of the square, and has the smallest possible area of shapes with this property. However, although it covers most of the square in this rotation process, it fails to cover {{a small fraction of the}} square's area, near its corners. Because of this property of rotating within a square, the Reuleaux triangle is also sometimes known as the Reuleaux rotor.|$|E
5|$|Another {{approach}} ignores {{energy and}} deals {{only with the}} molecular complexity estimated by the information entropy index. It speculates that <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>of</b> several natural compounds (urea, pyrimidine, dihydroxyacetone, uracil, cytosine, glycine, and alanine) fall into {{the range of the}} values typical for the known interstellar molecules that indicates high probability of their detection in interstellar environment. Additionally the molecules with maximal information entropy, i.e. the most complex compounds, make up approximately a half of the interstellar set and their percentage is decreased with the size. This trend may be associated with the different stabilities of the molecules with uniform (usually more stable) and diversified (usually less stable) chemical structures, so the detectable molecules with a large size must possess symmetric structure more probably than non-symmetric. The remarkable detection of low-entropy (highly symmetric) fullerene molecules supports this assumption. It is also noted that information entropy reflects the depth of hydrogenation of interstellar entities: the molecules with maximal information entropy are hydrogen-poor whereas the others are mainly hydrogen-rich.|$|E
5|$|As <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>of</b> any smooth simple {{closed curve}} move in this way, the curve remains simple and smooth. It loses area at a {{constant}} rate, and its perimeter decreases {{as quickly as possible}} for any continuous curve evolution. If the curve is non-convex, its total absolute curvature decreases monotonically, until it becomes convex. Once convex, the isoperimetric ratio of the curve decreases as the curve converges to a circular shape, before collapsing to a single point of singularity. If two disjoint simple smooth closed curves evolve, they remain disjoint until one of them collapses to a point.|$|E

5|$|Monmouth {{had been}} a {{significant}} border settlement since the Roman occupation of Britain, when it {{was the site of}} the fort of Blestium. The River Wye may have been bridged at this time but the Monnow, being easily fordable, appears not to have had a crossing until after the Norman Conquest. According to the local tradition, construction of Monnow Bridge began in 1272 to replace a 12th-century Norman timber bridge. Through the medieval era, the English Civil War, and the Chartist uprising, the bridge played a significant, if ineffectual, role in defending Monmouth. It also served as a gaol, a munitions store, a lodge, an advertising hoarding, a focus for celebrations and, most significantly, as a toll gate. Much of the medieval development of Monmouth was funded by the taxes and tolls the borough was entitled to raise through Royal Charter. The tolls were collected through control of <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>of</b> entry to the town, including the gatehouse on Monnow Bridge.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the next week, the US troops were able to discern the North Koreans' system of attack and use it to their advantage. The North Koreans used a system of flares to signal various actions and {{coordinate}} them. It quickly became apparent to the defending Americans that green flares were used to signal an attack on a given area. So the 27th Infantry obtained its own green flares and then, after the North Korean attack had begun, fired them over its main defensive positions. This confused the attacking forces and often drew them to <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>of</b> greatest US strength where they suffered massive casualties from defensive machine-gun crossfire. The US troops also began using land mines in front of their positions to stall the North Koreans. The mines stopped the tanks and the infantry tried to remove them. When this happened, US troops fired flares to illuminate the scene and pre-registered artillery and mortar fire blasted the immobilized North Koreans. This tactic was effective in inflicting further significant casualties.|$|E

5|$|The Son of Neptune is a 2011 fantasy {{adventure}} novel written by American author Rick Riordan, based on Greek and Roman mythology. It {{is the second}} book in The Heroes of Olympus series, preceded by The Lost Hero and followed by The Mark of Athena. The story follows the adventures of amnesiac Percy Jackson, a demigod son of Poseidon, as he meets a camp of Roman demigods and goes to Alaska with his new friends Hazel Levesque and Frank Zhang to free the Greek god of death, Thanatos and help save the world from Gaea, the earth goddess.

5|$|The {{extremely}} nested pseudonymity of {{this work}} adds a problem of interpretation. A and B are {{the authors of the}} work, Eremita is the editor. Kierkegaard's role in all this appears to be that he deliberately sought to disconnect himself from <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>of</b> view expressed in his works, although the absurdity of his pseudonyms' bizarre Latin names proves that he did not hope to thoroughly conceal his identity from the reader. Kierkegaard's Papers first edition VIII(2), B 81 - 89 explain this method in writing. On interpretation there is also much to be found in The Point of View of My Work as an Author.|$|E
5|$|The {{propellers}} {{themselves were}} also found to be poorly manufactured, having been shaped by hand, {{with at least one}} cast at the wrong pitch. This was rectified by using a five-axis milling machine for future shaping work and replacing the miscast propeller. The material used for the propellers was also found to be weaker than expected, developing fatigue cracks after only a few years of use. Instead of going to Kockums, which had started to go into decline {{after the end of the}} Cold War, the submarine project office sent the propeller to the United States Navy for redesigning. Despite the Americans fixing the problems with the propeller design, resulting in significant performance improvements, the Swedish company was dissatisfied with the Australian actions; the dispatch of the propellers was one of <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>of</b> contention in the company's legal action in the mid-2000s against the Australian government over ownership of the intellectual property rights to the submarine's design.|$|E

Their flowers may have superior ovaries (i.e., above <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>of</b> attachment of the sepals and petals), and areoles that produce further leaves. The two species of Maihuenia have small, globe-shaped bodies with prominent leaves at the top.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{agreement}} {{as to the}} order in which the murders took place. Burke made two confessions but gave different sequences for the murders in each statement.

These in turn differed from the order given in Hare's statement, although the pair were agreed on many of <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>of</b> the murders.

5|$|Together with a {{simultaneous}} {{attack on the}} Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, and a failed plane hijacking {{that resulted in a}} plane crash in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, the attacks resulted in the deaths of 2,996 people (2,507 civilians, 343 firefighters, 72 law enforcement officers, 55 military personnel, and the 19 hijackers). More than 90% of the workers and visitors who died in the towers had been at or above <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>of</b> impact.

When Flight 11 hit, all three staircases in the North Tower above the impact zone were destroyed, thus making it impossible for anyone above the impact zone to escape. 107 people below the point of impact also died.|$|E
