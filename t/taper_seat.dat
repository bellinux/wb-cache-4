5000|$|In the United States, {{vehicles}} {{manufactured by}} the Chrysler Corporation used left-hand and right-hand screw thread for different {{sides of the}} vehicle to prevent loosening prior to the 1975 models. Most Buicks, Pontiacs, and Oldsmobiles used both left-handed and right-handed lug nuts prior to model year 1965. [...] It was later realized that the <b>taper</b> <b>seat</b> performed the same function. Modern vehicles use right-hand threads on all wheels.|$|E
5000|$|Most {{spark plugs}} seal to the {{cylinder}} {{head with a}} single-use hollow or folded metal washer which is crushed slightly between the flat surface {{of the head and}} that of the plug, just above the threads. Some spark plugs have a <b>tapered</b> <b>seat</b> that uses no washer. The torque for installing these plugs is supposed to be lower than a washer-sealed plug. [...] Spark plugs with <b>tapered</b> <b>seats</b> should never be installed in vehicles with heads requiring washers, and vice versa. Otherwise, a poor seal or incorrect reach would result because of the threads not properly seating in the heads.|$|R
50|$|The valve {{is often}} {{described}} as a needle valve, although this is a misnomer. A true needle valve uses a tapered needle in a <b>tapered</b> <b>seat,</b> so as to provide fine control over flow rate. The float valve uses a pointed needle against a square-edged seat, to give a positive shut-off.|$|R
50|$|An {{instrument}} {{needle valve}} uses a tapered pin to gradually open {{a space for}} fine control of flow. The flow can be controlled and regulated {{with the use of}} a spindle. A needle valve has a relatively small orifice with a long, <b>tapered</b> <b>seat,</b> and a needle-shaped plunger on the end of a screw, which exactly fits the seat.|$|R
50|$|Caution {{needs to}} be {{exercised}} in the usual drilling machine or lathe situation, which provides no drawbar to pull the taper into engagement, if a tool is used requiring a high torque but providing little axial resistance. An example would be {{the use of a}} large diameter drill to slightly enlarge an existing hole. In this situation, there may be considerable rotary loading. In contrast, the cutting action will require very little thrust or feed force. Thrust helps to keep the <b>taper</b> <b>seated</b> and provides essential frictional coupling.|$|R
50|$|The lug's taper is {{normally}} 60 degrees (although 45 {{is common for}} wheels designed for racing applications), and is designed to center the wheel accurately on the axle, and to reduce the tendency for the nut to loosen, due to fretting induced precession, as the car is driven. Honda uses a spherical rather than a <b>tapered</b> <b>seat,</b> but the nut performs the same function. Older style (non-ferrous) alloy wheels have a 1/2 to 1 inch cylindrical shank slipping into the wheel to center it and a washer that applies pressure to clamp the wheel to the axle.|$|R
6000|$|The AMAH {{is seated}} {{in one of}} the {{blackwood}} chairs by the side of [...] a table. She has her water-pipe. She puts a pinch of tobacco in and [...] then going to the lamp under the image lights a <b>taper.</b> She <b>seats</b> [...] herself again and lights her pipe. She smokes quietly.|$|R
5000|$|A {{backplate}} with {{a female}} (self-releasing) <b>taper</b> may <b>seat</b> on the matching male taper of the taper(ed) spindle nose (for lathe work) or of an adapter plate with the same nose, to be mounted on a table. This system improves the repeatability of the mounting concentricity down to a very small total indicated runout (TIR) value. Subtypes: ...|$|R
50|$|A modern, {{tailored}} kilt, {{with its}} tapered pleats (<b>tapered</b> from <b>seat</b> to waist) is fastened about the body securely {{enough with the}} buckles and straps which are provided for that purpose. The kilt belt worn with such kilts is purely decorative during ceremonial use. They are typically fairly wide - between 2 - 1/2 and 3 inches or so - and come in black or brown leather.|$|R
50|$|In 2007, Honda showed two new concepts: the CB1100R and the CB1100F. Both {{were highly}} {{reminiscent}} of the original CB1100F/R, even sporting dual rear shocks with remote fluid reservoirs. Honda showed a revised concept at the 2009 Tokyo Motor Show called the CB1100. It was shown in two variants. One being more standard while the other more 'cafe-racer' style (black exhaust, black fender, bikini fairing, <b>tapered</b> rear <b>seat).</b>|$|R
60|$|Filamentary Appendages, {{one on each}} side, short, <b>tapering</b> and pointed; <b>seated</b> on the {{posterior}} margin of a slight swelling beneath the basal articulation of the first cirrus; they are about equal in length to the pedicels of this cirrus.|$|R
40|$|An {{improved}} electrode {{mounting structure}} for a {{gas tungsten arc welding}} torch having a coaxial imaging system. The electrode mounting structure includes a support having a central hub and {{a plurality of}} spokes which extend from the hub generally radially with respect to the axis of the torch into supporting engagement with the interior walls of the torch. The spaces between the spokes are optical passages for transmission of light to form the image. A tubular collet holder is threadedly engaged at its upper end to the hub and extends downwardly toward the open end of the torch. The collet holder has an inwardly tapering constriction near its lower end. An electrode-retaining, tubular collet is mounted within the collet holder and has a longitudinally split and <b>tapered</b> end <b>seating</b> against the <b>tapered</b> constriction. A spring seats against {{the upper end of the}} collet and forces the split end against the tapered constriction to wedge the split end radially inwardly to grip the electrode within the collet...|$|R
5000|$|The {{morphology}} of {{the eggs}} {{is very important for}} diagnosis, but is difficult as eggs are very small. Eggs have a smooth, hard shell that is transparent and yellow-brown with a more conventional, ovoid egg shape. They are about the same size as those of Heterophyes and Clonorchis, usually measuring 26-28 μm length and 15-17μm width. The egg also has a very slight opercular shoulder, marking the line of cleavage between the shell and operculum, an [...] "escape hatch" [...] for the mircidium. The Clonorchis has more distinctive <b>tapering</b> and a <b>seated</b> operculum that help distinguish it more readily from Metagonimus species.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Aim: To {{investigate}} whether the removal and reseating of the abutment influences {{the retention of}} Morse taper implant system. Methods: Two Morse taper implant systems were selected: Bicon Dental ImplantTM system (Bicon, LLC, Boston, MA, USA) and Kopp Implant(r) system (Kopp(r), Curitiba, PR, Brazil). In both systems, the abutment {{is connected to the}} implant with a locking <b>taper.</b> To <b>seat</b> the abutment, the same vertical force was applied in both systems. It was measured the compressive force necessary to engage effectively the locking taper connection and the tensile force to displace it. Results: The compressive force was determined by four activations in each abutment-implant set, and the sum of these forces was 21 N and 17 N in the BiconTM and Kopp(r) systems, respectively. Next, a tensile test was performed, revealing that the BiconTM system presented a 208 N resistance, whereas it was 194 N in the Kopp(r) system. Other three rounds of compression and tensile loads were applied, removing and reseating the abutment. We obtained the following tensile values: 367 N, 500 N and 756 N in the BiconTM System and 336 N, 360 N and 420 N in the Kopp(r) system. Conclusions: When the sets were subjected to repeated rounds of compressive and tensile forces, displacing and reseating the abutment, the tensile value increased...|$|R
40|$|Aim: To {{compare the}} {{mechanical}} {{resistance to fracture}} of two conical post systems placed with no preparation of the root canal with that of double <b>taper</b> fibre posts <b>seated</b> in endodontically treated single roots after standard post space preparation using dedicated drills. Methodology: Thirty fibre posts with double (G 1, n = 10, DT Light Post) and single taper (G 2, n = 10, SurgiPost Multiconical; G 3, n = 10, Tech ES Endoshape) were luted with self-adhesive cement in endodontically treated single roots using different post space preparation techniques. The bonded posts were experimentally loaded until failure and the maximum load to fracture was registered. Fracture patterns were qualitatively evaluated and SEM analysis was performed to assess the quality of endodontic treatments and cementation. Data were statistically analysed by means of one-way ANOVA. Results: The mean maximum load to fracture was 165. 05 23. 46 N in G 1, 151. 52 16. 23 N in G 2 and 129. 09 15. 25 N in G 3. Statistically significant differences were pointed out between G 1 and G 3 (p < 0. 01) and G 2 and G 3 (p < 0. 05). No root fractures were evidenced. SEM analyses showed slightly thicker cement ayers at the apical and middle thirds of single taper posts (G 2 and G 3). Conclusions: DT Light Post and SurgiPost Multiconical fibre posts showed similar properties in terms of mechanical resistance to fracture and {{higher than those of}} Tech ES Endoshape. Unrestorable root fractures did not occur with any of the tested posts...|$|R
