The neural tube, forming from the ectoderm, contains CSF prior {{to the development of the}} choroid plexuses. The open neuropores of the neural tube close after <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>month</b> of development, and CSF pressure gradually increases.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: <b>the</b> <b>first</b> {{birth is}} an event {{in the life of}} people and {{therefore}} in their development process. The implications that stem from changes arising on many different levels require a variety of parental responses. This makes studying the problems of parents in the care of infants during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>months</b> of life a relevant issue. Objective: to determine the socio-demographic characteristics of parents with a one month old child and to identify the difficulties parents face in caring for their infants during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>months</b> of life. Materials and methods: cross-sectional study, experimental, descriptive, with a non probabilistic sample of 88 parents. A questionnaire was applied in two parts, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> consisting of a socio-demographic and obstetrical configuration. The second part was applied to determine the difficulties of parents in the care of infants during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>months</b> of life. Results and discussion: the study identifies and describes the difficulties experienced by parents in the care of newborns. It is essential to know the problems of parents during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>months</b> of life of their infants in order to promote better adaptation strategies for their new roles and to develop better parenting skills...|$|R
