40|$|Background. The COM-B system {{adapted to}} family {{caregivers}} analyses health capability through capabilities, opportunities, and motivations. Focusing on motivations, {{this study investigated}} <b>the</b> <b>motivations</b> <b>to</b> be a family caregiver and <b>the</b> <b>motivations</b> <b>to</b> maintain one’s own health. Methods. Semi-structured {{interviews were conducted with}} 14 caregivers of stroke victims (France: n= 8; Luxembourg: n= 6; 50 % male; age 63. 6 ± 10. 1) about how they preserve their health and their resources to attain optimal health. Verbatims about their <b>motivations</b> <b>to</b> care for their relative and their <b>motivation</b> <b>to</b> maintain their own health were open-coded. Items were built and validated by consensus with an expert group. Findings. <b>Motivations</b> <b>to</b> care for a relative included the sense of duty, fear of guilt or deception, perceived need and feelings like love. <b>The</b> <b>motivations</b> <b>to</b> maintain personal health were intrinsic (self-; family-oriented), related to caregiving, and extrinsic (induced by relatives and material needs) and encompass amotivation. Discussion. It is relevant to integrate feelings, anticipated regret, moral norms and health value to the COM-B system adapted to family caregivers. Identifying their contribution to health capability will help orient psycho-educational interventions implementation...|$|R
5|$|Makedonsko Devojče 2 (in Macedonian Cyrillic: Македонско девојче 2, {{meaning in}} English: Macedonian Girl 2) is the eighth studio album by Macedonian singer Karolina Gočeva {{released}} on 25 February 2014. Avalon Production launched the album in Macedonia, while Croatian label Dallas Records released it throughout former Yugoslav countries in April 2015. The album consists of eight original songs written by Valentin Soklevski and Vesna Malinova; the arrangement and production were completed by Nikola Micevski and Dejan Momirovski. Except for those eight songs, two cover versions are also included, {{one of them}} being of a Macedonian traditional song {{and the other one}} of a record originally performed by Macedonian singer Pepi Baftiroski. For Gočeva, <b>the</b> <b>motivation</b> <b>to</b> record the album came from the critical and commercial success of her previous project inspired by the Macedonian traditional music, Makedonsko Devojče (2008).|$|E
5|$|SETI {{researcher}} Carl Sagan {{believed that}} a civilization with the technological prowess needed to reach the stars and come to Earth must have transcended war {{to be able to}} avoid self-destruction. Representatives of such a civilization would treat humanity with dignity and respect, and humanity, with its relatively backward technology, would {{have no choice but to}} reciprocate. Seth Shostak, an astronomer at the SETI Institute, disagrees, stating that the finite quantity of resources in the galaxy would cultivate aggression in any intelligent species, and that an explorer civilization that would want to contact humanity would be aggressive. Similarly, Ragbir Bhathal claims that since the laws of evolution would be the same on another habitable planet as they are on Earth, an extremely advanced extraterrestrial civilization may have <b>the</b> <b>motivation</b> <b>to</b> colonize humanity, much as British colonizers did to the aboriginal peoples of Australia.|$|E
5|$|The NRRF {{arrived in}} Archangel on 5 June 1919 aboard the SS Porto and SS Stephen and almost {{immediately}} moved up the Dvina River to a camp at Osinova. There they began training for an offensive up the rail and river systems of the Dvina. This offensive was designed to push the Bolshevik forces of the Red Army back while the Allies withdrew without interference. A secondary aim was to leave the White Russian forces in a better military position, in the optimistic hope they could subsequently hold their own. Meanwhile, {{with the arrival of}} the NRRF, the survivors of the earlier NREF were subsequently evacuated. Activity during this period also included small-scale patrol and ambush operations around Troitska to the south in an attempt to keep the Bolsheviks off balance, as well as to provide the White Russian forces with <b>the</b> <b>motivation</b> <b>to</b> fight. Both sides had a small air arm, and the British established a makeshift airfield at Bakaritsa, near Archangel. Later in the campaign Sopwiths from France were used from a strip at Obozerskaya. The allies soon established air-superiority, shooting down a number of Bolshevik aircraft. At least one Australian—Ira Jones—is known to have served with the British Royal Air Force in North Russia.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to gain better understanding of <b>the</b> <b>motivations</b> <b>to</b> play video games, particularly first-person shooter games. The aim was therefore to produce a motivational landscape that describes and categorizes <b>the</b> main <b>motivations</b> <b>to</b> play first-person shooter games (FPS). The study tries to expand <b>the</b> understanding of <b>motivations</b> <b>to</b> play. Therefore, qualitative research method was chosen for gaining a better understanding. The chosen research strategy is case study and the cases used in this study are Battlefield 3 and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. These two cases represent popular games in FPS-genre. The empirical material was collected by using semi-structured interviews. Total of seven (7) persons were interviewed for this study. All interviewees were Finnish males (ages 22 – 28) that are experienced gamers. This study expands <b>the</b> <b>motivation</b> research of gaming. From the academic standpoint, the study offers an empirically grounded categorization for analyzing <b>the</b> <b>motivations</b> <b>to</b> play FPS-games: achievement, learning, social interaction, entertainment and escapism. The study gives structure to a complex and elusive subject of <b>motivation,</b> deepens <b>the</b> understanding of the content of the categories and reveals the underlying processes behind it. In addition, the study makes a division between intrinsic and extrinsic motivations. From managerial standpoint, the study offers comprehensive and balanced structure for evaluating games in terms of their motivational appeal and may therefore help in game development. Game developers should understand that the game needs to provide enough intrinsic <b>motivation</b> <b>to</b> keep players interested. Extrinsic motivation should be used as something that enhances the gameplay experience without destroying it. In-depth understanding of <b>the</b> player’s <b>motivations</b> <b>to</b> play is a vital part of every game company’s business decision-making practices. Video game companies should consider <b>motivations</b> <b>to</b> play when they design monetization models for their games. From a societal standpoint, the parents of gamers could benefit from this study by understanding more of what is actually happening when their children play FPS-games...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze the {{interaction}} between different contextual motivations and exercise <b>motivation.</b> <b>The</b> sample consisted of 449 exercisers aged between 16 and 53 years.

The level of self-determined motivation regarding health, leisure and interpersonal relationships was also measured. The results of the structural equation modeling demonstrated that basic psychological needs and self-determined motivations about health and leisure positively predicted <b>the</b> self-determined <b>motivation</b> <b>to</b> exercise. Moreover, <b>the</b> self-determined <b>motivation</b> <b>to</b> exercise positively predicted the autotelic experience.
