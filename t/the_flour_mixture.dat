25|$|A light batter {{is made of}} {{cold water}} (sometimes {{sparkling}} water is used to keep the batter light) and soft wheat flour (cake, pastry or all-purpose flour).

Tempura batter is traditionally mixed in small batches using chopsticks {{for only a few}} seconds, leaving lumps in the mixture that, along with the cold batter temperature, result in the unique fluffy and crisp tempura structure when cooked. The batter is often kept cold by adding ice, or by placing the bowl inside a larger bowl with ice in it. Overmixing the batter will result in activation of wheat gluten, which causes <b>the</b> <b>flour</b> <b>mixture</b> to become soft and dough-like when fried.|$|E

50|$|The {{ingredients}} for choux pastry are butter, water, flour and eggs. Like Yorkshire Pudding or David Eyre's pancake, {{instead of a}} raising agent, it employs high moisture content to create steam during cooking to puff the pastry. The high moisture content is achieved by boiling the water and butter, then adding <b>the</b> <b>flour.</b> <b>The</b> <b>mixture</b> is cooked a few minutes longer, then cooled before adding enough eggs to achieve the desired consistency.

40|$|Whole cereal flours (buckwheat, barley, and oat) {{and wheat}} bran {{were used to}} {{substitute}} 20 % of white bakery wheat flour to prepare round rolls. Round roll quality was evaluated by determining total phenolic and total flavonoid contents, antioxidative capacity, the content of lipid hydroperoxides (primary oxidation products), and sensory profiling. Moreover, {{the stability of the}} phenolic compounds and antioxidant behaviour throughout processing was studied. Technological processing does not cause any significant loss of phenolics (less than 5 %). A significant increase in antioxidants and phenolics of <b>the</b> <b>flour</b> <b>mixtures</b> and final products were observed compared to those of white wheat round rolls (as control). Buckwheat and barley round roll crumbs contained the highest total phenolic and total flavonoid contents, and were the most effective in enhancing antioxidant activity, which increased 15 -fold and 8 -fold, respectively, when compared to the control roll. The tested cereals effectively retarded formation of lipid hydroperoxides (from over 50 % to control), which are undesirable from both a nutrition and storage/shelf life perspective.

40|$|PURPOSE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} volatile-free products that would be suitable for stabilizing incinerated dental remains at the scene of an incident, and that would not compromise any postmortem examination. METHODS: The anterior mandibles of sheep were incinerated, sprayed unilaterally with stabilizing agents, vibrated for 30  s, and assessed. The effect of the stabilizing solutions on radiographic examination was also recorded. Tests for volatility and the effect on human mandibles were also conducted. RESULTS: A flour/water mixture of one part flour to two parts water, and a paste mixture of one part Clag™ glue to one part water both produced significant stabilization results. <b>The</b> <b>flour</b> <b>mixture</b> left an opaque layer on the samples that it was applied to, which still allowed dental examination, but the glue paste mixture resulted in a clearer layer. Both solutions allowed radiographic examination and were free of volatiles. CONCLUSION: Diluted Clag™ paste, when sprayed on to incinerated remains, assists in their stabilization for transportation. When Clag™ paste is unavailable a mixture of two parts water to one part plain flour could be utilized for stabilization. John Berketa, Helen James, Neil Langlois, Lindsay Richards, Paul Pigo...|$|E
40|$|The {{extrusion}} processing parameters, {{chemical composition}} and water content of <b>the</b> <b>flour</b> <b>mixture</b> {{may affect the}} structure of rice flour, leading to products with different rheological behavior and hygroscopicity. Therefore, this work aimed to study the rheological properties and water adsorption of mixed flours of broken rice and barley bagasse obtained by extrusion cooking. Samples were prepared from a mixture of grits/bagasse between 82 / 18 and 73 / 27 (w/w) with water content between 18. 04 and 26. 96 %, using a single screw extruder. The rheological properties of the extruded flour were determined by a rapid viscosity analyzer to evaluate the cooking profile of the pastes by observing the pasting temperature, maximum viscosity, breakdown and retrogradation. The adsorption process was performed by weighing the samples stored at temperatures of 25, 30, 35 and 45 °C with water activity between 0. 112 and 0. 973. The isotherms were fitted using the following mathematical models: Halsey, Oswin, Smith, GAB and Peleg. The extruded composite flours were characterized by their lack of initial viscosity. The pasting temperature (40 - 67 °C), maximum viscosity (690 - 1146 cP), breakdown viscosity (0 - 175 cP) and retrogradation (613 - 1382 cP) were lower than for raw rice flour.

40|$|Millet (Panicum miliaceum L.) is more {{resistant}} to climatic and soil conditions but the yields are lower than in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), therefore its cultivation was given up for decades in Hungary.

40|$|Wheat and cassava {{composite}} breads {{are generally}} associated with volume and textural defects {{in contrast with}} the traditional wheat based variants. Efforts to mitigate this challenge through use of synthetic additives have been unsuccessful owing to safety concerns. The objective {{of this study was to}} explore Grewia venusta mucilage as a potential natural additive in wheat-cassava composite bread production. Sweet cassava flour was used to replace wheat flour at 100 : 0 (control), 90 : 10, 80 : 20 and 70 : 30 % ratios in bread making. Aqueous extract of G. venusta stem bark was oven dried (50 ± 3 o C), milled and added at 0, 1. 0 and 2. 0 % (w/w) to <b>the</b> <b>flour</b> <b>mixtures.</b> These, along with other conventional inputs were mixed, and used to produce bread. Proximate compositions, physical and sensory properties of the bread loaves were evaluated. Cassava flour inclusion resulted in significant (P ≤ 0. 05) decrease in the protein content of the control from 18. 1 % to 12. 1 % (90 : 10 %), 11. 5 % (80 : 20 %) and 9. 9 % (70 : 30 %). Addition of mucilage marginally increased the protein and dietary fibre contents of the loaves. Loaves containing 1 - 2 % mucilage were more regular in shape with smoother crust than those without mucilage. Cassava flour addition at 10 %, 20 % and 30 % decreased loaf height from 6. 0 cm to 5. 8 cm, 5. 7 cm and 5. 5 cm, as well as loaf volume from 815. 5 cm 3 to 783. 1 cm 3, 776. 8 cm 3 and 744. 5 cm 3, respectively. Mucilage inclusion resulted in increased heights and volumes of the loaves and reduced weights of loaf fragments upon slicing.

Nine samples from local producers were analysed considering the morphology, physicochemical (density, alveolus percentage, texture, colour and water activity) and sensorial properties. The form and dimensions of all breads were determined, as well as proximate composition and total salt content. The forms of the breads were different, some round and others long. Nutritionally this type of bread turned out to be a food with high nutritional value, high percentage of ash (2. 8 - 4. 9 %) and low values of fat, with a high range of salt content (0. 4 - 1. 4 %). The physical properties were quite different between samples, although some of them are not perceptible by the consumer. This was the case of bread density whose results were 0. 25 - 0. 56 and the sensorial panel, constituted by a panel of 40 untrained tasters aged 7 to 63 years, did not find any difference.
