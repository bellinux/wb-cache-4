5|$|The last Article {{creates the}} {{mechanism}} for future changes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Constitution.</b> Any amendment <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> {{must first be}} passed by a majority {{in each of the}} two legislative houses. The proposed amendment must then be held over for consideration by the succeeding elected legislature, where it must again be passed by a majority in each house. The amendment then goes on the general ballot and becomes enacted into the Constitution if approved by a majority of the voters.|$|E

5|$|Lincoln, however, did tacitly {{support the}} {{proposed}} Corwin Amendment <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Constitution,</b> which passed Congress before Lincoln {{came into office}} and was then awaiting ratification by the states. That proposed amendment would have protected slavery in states where it already existed and would have guaranteed that Congress would not interfere with slavery without Southern consent. A {{few weeks before the}} war, Lincoln sent a letter to every governor informing them Congress had passed a joint resolution to amend the Constitution. Lincoln was open to the possibility of a constitutional convention to make further amendments <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Constitution.</b>|$|E

5|$|On June 8, 1789, Representative James Madison {{introduced}} nine amendments <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>constitution</b> in the House of Representatives. Among his recommendations Madison proposed {{opening up}} the Constitution and inserting specific rights limiting the power of Congress in Article One, Section 9. Seven of these limitations would {{become part of the}} ten ratified Bill of Rights amendments. Ultimately, on September 25, 1789, Congress approved twelve articles of amendment <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Constitution,</b> each consisting of one one-sentence paragraph, and submitted them to the states for ratification. Contrary to Madison's original proposal that the articles be incorporated into {{the main body of the}} Constitution, they were proposed as supplemental additions (codicils) to it. Articles Three through Twelve were ratified as additions <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> on December 15, 1791, and became Amendments One through Ten of the Constitution. Article Two became part of the Constitution on May 5, 1992, as the Twenty-seventh Amendment. Article One is technically still pending before the states.|$|E

5000|$|Some {{definitions}} of 'plebiscite' {{suggest that it}} is a type of vote <b>to</b> change <b>the</b> <b>constitution</b> or government of a country. However, some other countries define it differently. For example, Australia defines 'referendum' as a vote <b>to</b> change <b>the</b> <b>constitution,</b> and 'plebiscite' as a vote that does not affect <b>the</b> <b>constitution.</b> In Ireland, <b>the</b> vote <b>to</b> adopt its constitution was called a [...] "plebiscite", but a subsequent vote <b>to</b> amend <b>the</b> <b>constitution</b> is called a 'referendum', and so is a poll of the electorate on a non-constitutional bill.|$|R
50|$|Shareholders will habitually have <b>the</b> right <b>to</b> change <b>the</b> company's <b>constitution</b> with a {{three quarter}} {{majority}} vote, {{unless they have}} chosen <b>to</b> entrench <b>the</b> <b>constitution</b> with a higher threshold.|$|R

50|$|Some {{suggest that}} these results are a very {{important}} issue in Venezuela, since a two-thirds majority in parliament is needed <b>to</b> change <b>the</b> <b>constitution.</b> <b>The</b> Fifth Republic Movement now holds a sufficient majority <b>to</b> change <b>the</b> <b>constitution</b> with or without the support of other political parties.|$|R
50|$|The {{municipality}} {{status of}} Kohalpur has been repeatedly stalled due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> failure <b>to</b> ratify <b>the</b> national <b>constitution.</b> A fourth deadline <b>to</b> ratify <b>the</b> <b>constitution</b> was missed on 27 May 2012.|$|R
5000|$|The first twelve {{amendments}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> U.S. <b>Constitution,</b> including <b>the</b> Bill of Rights, {{were directly}} incorporated into <b>the</b> Confederate <b>Constitution.</b> This was done primarily in Article I Section 9 of <b>the</b> Confederate <b>Constitution</b> with <b>the</b> first Eight Amendments <b>to</b> <b>the</b> U.S <b>Constitution</b> becoming clauses (12) to (19).|$|R

5000|$|The Constitutional Act of November 6, 1962 was adopted, {{without any}} {{parliamentary}} procedure, through direct referendum by Article 11 of <b>the</b> French <b>constitution.</b> <b>The</b> {{use of this}} procedure <b>to</b> revise <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> has been strongly criticized, as the article text does not explicitly provide {{that it can be}} used <b>to</b> revise <b>the</b> <b>Constitution.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{senate was}} to {{supervise}} the chamber of deputies, ensuring it acts according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>constitution,</b> and ensure the proper procedure during the elections. The senate could object to a legislation, but could be overruled by the king.|$|E

50|$|Amendments {{were brought}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> first <b>{{constitution}}</b> in later years, {{until a new}} constitution was finally declared in 1942.
