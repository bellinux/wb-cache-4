30|$|The {{incipient}} droughts <b>that</b> occurred <b>during</b> the wintering {{period of}} the winter wheat growth helped to increase the winter wheat yield, while the mild droughts <b>that</b> occurred <b>during</b> the maturity stage of winter wheat resulted in a reduction of yield. The mild droughts <b>that</b> occurred <b>during</b> the filling and maturity period {{had a significant effect}} on the yield of winter wheat. The moderate droughts <b>that</b> occurred <b>during</b> the flowering, filling, and maturity periods of the winter wheat growth {{had a significant impact on}} yield. In addition, the water shortage due to droughts <b>that</b> occurred <b>during</b> the seeding period in autumn also affected the production of winter wheat, and that is particularly true for the severe and extreme droughts <b>that</b> occurred <b>during</b> the seeding period. With some exception of the occurrence of droughts of certain intensities during some specific growth stages of winter wheat, droughts of higher intensities had greater impacts on winter wheat yield during the critical growth stages.|$|R

5|$|Ancient {{authors have}} implicated Domitian {{in the death}} of his brother, either by {{directly}} accusing him of murder, or implying he left the ailing Titus for dead, even alleging <b>that</b> <b>during</b> his lifetime, Domitian was openly plotting against his brother.

Brotherly affection was likely at a minimum, but this was hardly surprising, considering that Domitian had barely seen Titus after the age of seven.|$|E

50|$|Equivalent {{potential}} temperature, {{commonly referred}} to as theta-e , is a quantity <b>that</b> is conserved <b>during</b> changes to an air parcel's pressure (<b>that</b> is, <b>during</b> vertical motions in the atmosphere), even if water vapor condenses <b>during</b> <b>that</b> pressure change. It is therefore more conserved than the ordinary potential temperature, which remains constant only for unsaturated vertical motions (pressure changes).|$|R
40|$|Research has {{continued}} to demonstrate <b>that</b> exercise <b>during</b> pregnancy is safe. Growing evidence supports <b>that</b> exercise <b>during</b> pregnancy is beneficial for mother and fetus during gestation, with benefits persisting for the child into adulthood. Regardless of income or socioeconomic status, exercise during pregnancy is associated with increased incidence of full-term delivery. Additionally, normalization of birth measures, such as birth weight, occurs when women perform regular exercise throughout gestation. Measures of growth and development further indicate <b>that</b> exercise <b>during</b> pregnancy does not harm and may stimulate healthy growth throughout childhood. Measures of cognition and intelligence demonstrate <b>that</b> exercise <b>during</b> pregnancy causes no harm and may be beneficial. Overall, the benefits of exercise during pregnancy decrease the risk of chronic disease for both mother and child...|$|R

5|$|Cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond said <b>that,</b> <b>during</b> {{the time}} of {{shooting}} for the film, Spielberg got more ideas by watching movies every night which in turn extended the production schedule because he was continually adding new scenes to be filmed.

In her 1991 book You'll Never Eat Lunch in This Town Again, producer Julia Phillips wrote highly profane remarks about Spielberg, Zsigmond, and Truffaut, because she was fired during post-production due to a cocaine addiction. Phillips blamed it on Spielberg being a perfectionist.|$|E
