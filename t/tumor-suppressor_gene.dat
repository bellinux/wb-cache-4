In humans, it is encoded by the ALOX15 gene located on chromosome 17p13.3. This 11 kilobase pair gene consists of 14 exons and 13 introns coding for a 75 kiloDalton protein composed of 662 amino acids. 15-LO is to be distinguished from another human 15-lipoxygenase enzyme, ALOX15B (also termed 15-lipoxygenase-2). Orthologs of ALOX15, termed Alox15, are widely distributed in animal and plant species but commonly have different enzyme activities and make somewhat different products than ALOX15.|$|E

Kelavkar and Badr (1999) described experiments yielding data that supported the hypothesis that loss of the TP53 gene, or gain-of-function activities resulting from the expression of its mutant forms, regulates ALOX15 promoter activity in human and in mouse, albeit in directionally opposite manners. These studies defined a direct link between ALOX15 gene activity and an established <b>tumor-suppressor</b> <b>gene</b> located in close chromosomal proximity.

40|$|A {{predisposition}} {{to the development}} of certain specific and familial cancers is associated with the inheritance of a single mutated gene. In the best-characterized cases, this primary mutation is a loss of function mutation consistent with viability but resulting in neoplastic change consequent to the acquisition of a second somatic mutation at the same locus. Such genes are referred to as <b>tumor-suppressor</b> <b>genes.</b> Classical examples are the Rb- 1 gene associated with the development of retinoblastoma and the p 53 gene, which is associated with a wider range of neoplasms, including breast cancer. Other <b>tumor-suppressor</b> <b>genes</b> have been isolated which are associated with Wilms' tumor, neurofibromatosis, and inherited and sporadic forms of colorectal cancer.

The system compares mRNA expression of genes from normal and tumor-derived human mammary epithelial cells grown in a special medium that supports similar growth rates of the two cell types. mRNAs uniquely expressed in normal cells are recovered as cDNAs after subtraction with mRNA from tumor cells. Seven different clones, from 0. 6 to 4. 8 kilobases in transcript size and including both rare and abundunt transcripts, were recovered in the first 23 clones analyzed. Among the isolated clones were genes encoding the gap-junction protein connexin 26, two different keratins, and glutathione-S-transferase pi, {{as well as an}} unknown gene in the S 100 family of small calcium-binding proteins. In principle, <b>tumor-suppressor</b> <b>genes</b> include two classes: class I, in which loss of function results from mutation or deletion of DNA and class II, in which loss of function is from a regulatory block to expression. A class II suppressor gene is assumed to be regulated by a different suppressor gene that lost its function by mutation or deletion.

40|$|It is well {{established}} that transcriptional silencing of critical <b>tumor-suppressor</b> <b>genes</b> by DNA methylation is a fundamental component in the initiation of breast cancer. However, the involvement of microRNAs (miRNAs) in restoring abnormal DNA methylation patterns in breast cancer is not well understood. Therefore, we investigated whether miRNA- 29 b, due to its complimentarity to the 3 ′- untranslated region of DNA methyltransferase 3 A (DNMT 3 A) and DNMT 3 B, could restore normal DNA methylation patterns in human breast cancers and breast cancer cell lines. We demonstrated that transfection of pre-miRNA- 29 b into less aggressive MCF- 7 cells, but not MDA-MB- 231 mesenchymal cells, inhibited cell proliferation, decreased DNMT 3 A and DNMT 3 B messenger RNA (mRNA), and decreased promoter methylation status of ADAM 23, CCNA 1, CCND 2, CDH 1, CDKN 1 C, CDKN 2 A, HIC 1, RASSF 1, SLIT 2, TNFRSF 10 D, and TP 73 <b>tumor-suppressor</b> <b>genes.</b> Using methylation polymerase chain reaction (PCR) arrays and real-time PCR, we also demonstrated that the methylation status of several critical <b>tumor-suppressor</b> <b>genes</b> increased as stage of breast disease increased, while miRNA- 29 b mRNA levels were significantly decreased in breast cancers versus normal breast.

The proteins mediate signal transduction events that play a role in the regulation of cell development, activation, growth and motility. This encoded protein is a cell surface glycoprotein that is known to complex with integrins. This protein appears to promote muscle cell fusion and support myotube maintenance. Also it may be involved in signal transduction. This gene is localized in the <b>tumor-suppressor</b> <b>gene</b> region and thus it is a candidate gene for malignancies.|$|E
50|$|Signal-mediated nuclear import {{and export}} proceed through the nuclear pore complex (NPC), which is {{composed}} of approximately 30 unique proteins collectively known as nucleoporins. The 98 kD nucleoporin is generated through a biogenesis pathway that involves synthesis and proteolytic cleavage of a 186 kD precursor protein. This cleavage results in the 98 kD nucleoporin {{as well as a}} 96 kD nucleoporin, both of which are localized to the nucleoplasmic side of the NPC. Rat studies show that the 98 kD nucleoporin functions as one of several docking site nucleoporins of transport substrates. The human gene has been shown to fuse to several genes following chromosome translocations in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (T-ALL). This gene is one of several genes located in the imprinted gene domain of 11p15.5, an important <b>tumor-suppressor</b> <b>gene</b> region. Alterations in this region have been associated with the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, Wilms tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma, adrenocortical carcinoma, and lung, ovarian, and breast cancer.

5000|$|The chapter {{focuses on}} cancer, and {{introduces}} {{it with the}} principle that cells occasionally reproduce themselves {{when they are not}} supposed to. Cancer is when they are not stopped from doing so. A gene called TP53, on the short arm of chromosome 17, is responsible for suppressing rogue cancer cells, and is classified as a <b>tumor-suppressor</b> <b>gene.</b> These genes are the opposite of oncogenes, which are genes that encourage cell growth. Therefore, oncogenes can cause cancer when they are kept switched on, but tumor-suppressor genes can also cause cancer when they are kept switched off. Ridley explains that the reason detecting cancer early is so important is that the more it progresses and the more the cells divide, the more mutations accumulate, which means the progression of the disease actually accelerates with time. Some cancer victims also carry mutations in “mutator genes” such as BRCA1 and BRCA2, in the case of breast cancer. The protein that TP53 produces called p53, which is in clinical trial as a cancer drug, acts as a police officer in cells that begin to duplicate themselves excessively by either halting cell division or by instructing the cell to commit suicide by a process called apoptosis. Ridley explains that in various types of cancers TP53 is mutated very early, which explains why chemotherapy and radiation therapy does not always work effectively in later stages of the disease (chemo and radiation help the body to help itself by damaging DNA which thereby “alerts” p53, but if the gene is mutated this cannot happen). I have attached a quote from page 240 that I found particularly inspiring about “reductionist” cancer research.|$|E

40|$|Many {{different}} types of chemical exposures can increase the incidence of tumors in animals and humans, but usually {{a long period of}} time is required before the carcinogenic risk of an exposure is manifested. Both of these observations can be explained by a multistep/multigene model of carcinogenesis. In this model, a normal cell evolves into a cancer cell as the result of heritable changes in multiple, independent genes. The two-stage model of initiation and promotion for chemical carcinogenesis has provided a paradigm by which chemicals can act by qualitatively different mechanisms, but the process of carcinogenesis is now recognized as more complex than simply initiation and promotion. Even a three-stage model of initiation, promotion, and progression, which can be operationally defined, is not adequate to describe the carcinogenic process. The number of genes altered in a cancer cell compared to a normal cell is not known; recent evidence suggests that 3 - 10 genetic events are involved in common adult malignancies in humans. Two distinct classes of <b>genes,</b> protooncogenes and <b>tumor-suppressor</b> <b>genes,</b> are involved in the cancer process. Multiple oncogenes may be activated in a tumor, while multiple <b>tumor-suppressor</b> <b>genes</b> may be inactivated. Identification of the genes involved in carcinogenesis and elucidation of the mechanisms of their activation or inactivation allows a better understanding of how chemical carcinogens influence the process of neoplastic evolution. The findings of multiple genetic changes (including point mutations, chromosomal translocations, deletions, gene amplification, and numerical chromosome changes) in activated protooncogenes and inactivated <b>tumor-suppressor</b> <b>genes</b> provide experimental support for Boveri's somatic mutation theory of carcinogenesis. In addition to mutagenic mechanisms, chemicals may heritably alter cells by epigenetic mechanisms and enhance the clonal expansion of altered cells. Most chemical carcinogens operate via a combination of mechanisms, and even their primary mechanism of action may vary depending on the target tissues. The classification of chemicals by mechanism of action or by nongenotoxic or genotoxic activity has certain inherent difficulties because no classification of chemicals is exhaustive or definitive...|$|R
50|$|Mutations in GPR56 {{cause the}} brain {{developmental}} disorder BFPP, characterized by disordered cortical lamination in frontal cortex. Mice lacking expression of GPR56 develop a comparable phenotype. Furthermore, loss of GPR56 leads to reduced fertility in male mice, {{resulting from a}} defect in seminiferous tubule development. GPR56 is expressed in glioblastoma/astrocytoma {{as well as in}} esophageal squamous cell, breast, colon, non-small cell lung, ovarian, and pancreatic carcinoma. GPR56 was shown to localize together with α-actinin at the leading edge of membrane filopodia in glioblastoma cells, suggesting a role in cell adhesion/migration. In addition, recombinant GPR56-NTF protein interacts with glioma cells to inhibit cellular adhesion. Inactivation of Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) <b>tumor-suppressor</b> <b>gene</b> and hypoxia suppressed GPR56 in a renal cell carcinoma cell line, but hypoxia influenced GPR56 expression in breast or bladder cancer cell lines. GPR56 is a target gene for vezatin, an adherens junctions transmembrane protein, which is a tumor suppressor in gastric cancer. Xu et al. used an in vivo metastatic model of human melanoma to show that GPR56 is downregulated in highly metastatic cells. Later, by ectopic expression and RNA interference they confirmed that GPR56 inhibits melanoma tumor growth and metastasis. Silenced expression of GPR56 in HeLa cells enhanced apoptosis and anoikis, but suppressed anchorage-independent growth and cell adhesion. High ecotropic viral integration site-1 acute myeloid leukemia (EVI1-high AML) expresses GPR56 that was found to be a transcriptional target of EVI1. Silencing expression of GPR56 decreases adhesion, cell growth and induces apoptosis through reduced RhoA signaling. GPR56 suppresses the angiogenesis and melanoma growth through inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) via PKCα signaling pathway. Furthermore, GPR56 expression was found to be negatively correlated with the malignancy of melanomas in human patients.|$|E
50|$|The {{results from}} {{metabolism}} studies in rats show that, like other monocyclic aromatic amines, the metabolism of o-toluidine involves many competing activating and deactivating pathways, including N-acetylation, N-oxidation and N-hydroxylation, and ring oxidation. 4-Hydroxylation and N-acetylation of toluidine {{are the major}} metabolic pathways in rats. The primary metabolism of o-toluidine {{takes place in the}} endoplasmic reticulum. Exposure to o-toluidine enhances the microsomal activity of aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (particularly in the kidney), NAPDH-cytochrome c reductase and the content of cytochrome P-450. Cytochrome P450-mediated N-hydroxylation to N-hydroxy-o-toluidine, a carcinogenic metabolite, occurs in the liver. N-Hydroxy-o-toluidine can be either metabolized to o-nitrosotoluene or conjugated with glucuronic acid or sulfate and transported to the urinary bladder via the blood. Once in the bladder, N-hydroxy-o-toluidine can be released from the conjugates in an acidic urine environment to either react directly with DNA or be bio-activated via sulfation or acetylation by cytosolic sulfotransferases or N-acetyltransferases (presumably NAT1). The postulated activated form (based on comparison with other aromatic amines), N-acetoxy-o-toluidine, is a reactive ester that forms electrophilic arylnitrenium ions that can bind to DNA. Other activation pathways (ring-oxidation pathways) for aromatic amines include peroxidase-catalyzed reactions that form reactive metabolites (quinone-imines formed from nonconjugated phenolic metabolites) in the bladder. These metabolites can produce reactive oxygen species, resulting in oxidative cellular damage and compensatory cell proliferation. Support for this mechanism comes from studies of oxidative DNA damage induced by o-toluidine metabolites in cultured human cells (HL-60), calf thymus DNA, and DNA fragments from key genes thought to be involved in carcinogenesis (the c-Ha-ras oncogene and the p53 <b>tumor-suppressor</b> <b>gene).</b> Also supporting this mechanism are observations of o-toluidine-induced DNA damage (strand breaks) in cultured human bladder cells and bladder cells from rats and mice exposed in vivo to o-toluidine.|$|E

Twenty-five percent of pancreatic carcinomas, 50 % of gastric carcinomas, and 50 % of colorectal carcinomas were found to have lost an allele on chromosome 8.

40|$|Epigenetic alterations, {{represented}} by aberrant DNA methylation, are {{deeply involved in}} human cancers. In gastric cancers, <b>tumor-suppressor</b> <b>genes</b> are inactivated more frequently by promoter methylation than by mutations. We recently showed that H. pylori infection, a potent gastric carcinogenic factor, induces methylation of specific genes in the gastric mucosae. When the methylation levels were analyzed in the gastric mucosae of healthy volunteers, cases with a single gastric cancer, and cases with multiple gastric cancers, who have increasing levels of risks for gastric cancers, {{there was a significant}} increasing trend in the methylation levels among the individuals without current H. pylori infection. This finding unequivocally showed the presence of an epigenetic field for cancerization. The degree of the field defect was measured more conveniently using methylation levels of marker genes than using those of <b>tumor-suppressor</b> <b>genes.</b> The presence of an epigenetic field for cancerization has been indicated for liver, colon, Barrett's esophageal, lung, breast, and renal cancers. Since decreased transcription is involved in the specificity of methylated genes, it is likely that specific genes are methylated according to carcinogenic factors. These findings emphasize the usefulness of DNA methylation as a marker for past exposure to carcinogens and future risk of cancer development...|$|R
