5|$|Following the {{telegram}} sent to President Truman, the Lafayette students broke up their rally and ended the protest in downtown Easton. On the following day, November 24, at 9:30 in the morning, the students assembled once again at Lafayette College's Pardee Hall. Approximately 1,000 students congregated {{to pass a}} formal resolution stating <b>their</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> racial discrimination.|$|E
5|$|After {{his release}} from prison, Berkman served as editor of Goldman's anarchist journal, Mother Earth, and later {{established}} his own journal, The Blast. In 1917, Berkman and Goldman were sentenced {{to two years in}} jail for conspiracy against the newly instated draft. After their release from prison, they were arrested—along with hundreds of others—and deported to Russia. Initially supportive of that country's Bolshevik revolution, Berkman and Goldman soon became disillusioned, voicing <b>their</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> the Soviet's use of terror after seizing power and their repression of fellow revolutionaries. In 1925, he published a book about his experiences, The Bolshevik Myth.|$|E

5|$|Alexander and {{his paper}} vocally {{supported}} the old governing {{class of the}} former Confederate States of America and were rabid in <b>their</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> the policies of Reconstruction imposed upon the South by the Northern-based Republican Party. Such views were {{out of step with}} the majority of Oregonians, however, with the Republicans coming to dominate Oregon politics during the last quarter of the 19thcentury. Alexander was forced to liquidate his stake in his money-losing newspaper in 1868.|$|E
5|$|Although a {{potential}} local ownership group was identified in late February, local {{opposition to a}} perceived bailout of multi-millionaire ownership began to take hold. A citizens opposition group called Don't Target Us (referencing the Target Center in their name) formed to voice <b>their</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> a public purchase of the facility. Additionally, polling at the time showed support for public intervention as being unfavorable with 60 {{percent of those polled}} being against intervention. However support for intervention on the arena issue began to take shape as well with several at the local and state level stating their intention to make a deal happen. Additionally, businesses near the arena starting a campaign to keep the team in Minneapolis.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the vague}} {{language}} of the document, {{there has been much}} scholarly debate over how it should be interpreted. John Maddicott saw the wording as a hostile warning to the new king to avoid the mistakes of his father, or face the consequences. J. R. S. Phillips, on the other hand, took the signatories to be positively inclined towards Edward II. There were others who were more intrinsic in <b>their</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> the king and Gaveston, primarily the Earl of Warwick. The purpose of the document, in Phillips view, was to present the king with a warning, and hopefully protect him against the more antagonistic members of the nobility.|$|E
50|$|On November 4, 1986, {{three members}} of the state supreme court were ousted from office by voters after a {{high-profile}} campaign that cited <b>their</b> categorical <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> the death penalty.|$|R

50|$|It was ideologically heterogeneous, {{including}} social democrats, Arab nationalists, far-leftists, {{as well as}} Islamists. The unifiying {{point was}} <b>their</b> firm <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> the regime of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali.|$|R
5|$|In 1971, the Israeli Army {{attempted}} to disperse the {{high concentration of}} Palestinian refugees in al-Shati camp and developed new housing schemes {{that resulted in the}} establishment of the northern Sheikh Radwan district. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) and the PLO were vociferous in <b>their</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> the move, claiming it was forced resettlement. In 1972, Gaza's military governor dismissed the city's mayor, Rashad al-Shawa, for refusing to annex al-Shati camp to the municipality of Gaza. Since the 1970s, frequent conflicts erupted between Palestinians and the Israeli authorities in the city, leading to the First Intifada in 1987. Gaza became a center of confrontation during this uprising, and consequently, economic conditions in the city worsened.|$|E
5|$|Many tribal councils {{have passed}} resolutions or issued {{statements}} regarding <b>their</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> {{the name of}} the Washington Redskins, including the Cherokee and Comanche Nations of Oklahoma, the Inter Tribal Council of Arizona, the Inter-Tribal Council of the Five Civilized Tribes, the Oneida Indian Nation (New York), the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe (North Dakota) and the United South and Eastern Tribes (USET). In April 2014, Navajo Nation Council voted in favor of a statement opposing {{the name of the}} Washington team, as well as other disparaging references to American Indians by other professional sports franchises.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{opponents of the}} Bedell plan had a very {{different}} view of this legislation. Representatives such as Pat Roberts claimed that the referendum was redundant because the farmers already voted the politicians into office, and this bill {{was an example of}} the politicians not doing their jobs. The Reagan Administration opposed the bill because of <b>their</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> production controls, and the President threatened to veto the farm bill if Bedell's plan was left in place. When the bill got to the floor, an amendment was proposed to strike this provision, and it was passed 251-174.|$|E

50|$|In September 2004, several {{political}} groups (most are unofficial), {{on both the}} left and the right, announced <b>their</b> sharp <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> the inheritance of power. They demanded political change and a fair, multi-candidate election.|$|R
5|$|Phips {{arrived back}} in Boston {{in the summer}} of 1688 and was welcomed back as a hero. His wife seemed very happy to see him. He was celebrated in sermons and at the Harvard college {{commencement}} he was compared to Jason fetching the Golden Fleece. Andros and Randolph were not so happy to see him and it seems the feeling was mutual. Almost all of New England was unified in <b>their</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> Andros and Randolph. It is interesting to note here that Phips, despite having been captain of Randolph's gunship in '83-4, {{does not seem to have}} carried an association with Randolph in the minds of the people of Massachusetts Bay.|$|E
5|$|The Federalist Papers (specifically Federalist No. 84) are {{notable for}} <b>their</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> what {{later became the}} United States Bill of Rights. The idea of adding a Bill of Rights to the Constitution was {{originally}} controversial because the Constitution, as written, did not specifically enumerate or {{protect the rights of}} the people, rather it listed the powers of the government and left all that remained to the states and the people. Alexander Hamilton, the author of Federalist No. 84, feared that such an enumeration, once written down explicitly, would later be interpreted as a list of the only rights that people had.|$|E
5|$|The French were {{initially}} opposed to Albani's election, but they quickly dropped <b>their</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> him. He was elected unanimously on 23 November 1700. He was unsure {{whether he should}} accept the papacy {{due to the fact}} that he had nephews who he suspected would be angry if he followed the bull on nepotism. He was eventually convinced to accept the papacy by theologians who told him that not accepting an unanimous election would not be following the Holy Spirit.|$|E

50|$|Born in Glasgow, Maxwell {{joined the}} Liberal Party {{and worked as}} a {{lithographer}} and journalist. He left the Liberals in 1880 in <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> local <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> Irish nationalism, and became a leading supporter of Henry George and an activist in the Scottish Land Restoration League.|$|R
5|$|The first {{attempts}} {{to enforce the}} revenue laws were met with stiff resistance {{from a number of}} Massachusetts communities. Several towns refused to choose commissioners to assess the town population and estates, and officials from a number of them were consequently arrested and brought to Boston. Some were fined and released, while others were imprisoned until they promised to perform their duties. The leaders of Ipswich, who had been most vocal in <b>their</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> the law, were tried and convicted of misdemeanor offenses.|$|E
5|$|The show of {{solidarity}} between the sisters {{did not last}} long. Mary, a devout Catholic, was determined to crush the Protestant faith in which Elizabeth had been educated, and she ordered that everyone attend Catholic Mass; Elizabeth had to outwardly conform. Mary's initial popularity ebbed away in 1554 when she announced plans to marry Prince Philip of Spain, the son of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V and an active Catholic. Discontent spread rapidly through the country, and many looked to Elizabeth as a focus for <b>their</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> Mary's religious policies.|$|E
5|$|Although {{formally}} {{separate from}} Greek Orthodox and Latin (Catholic) Christians, the Armenians consider their quarter {{to be part}} of the Christian Quarter. The three Christian patriarchates of Jerusalem and the government of Armenia have publicly expressed <b>their</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> any political division of the two quarters. The central reasons for the existence of a separate Armenian Quarter is the miaphysitism and distinct language and culture of the Armenians, who, unlike the majority of Christians in Jerusalem (also in Israel and Palestine), are neither Arab nor Palestinian. However, for all intents and purposes, the Armenians living in the Armenian Quarter are considered Palestinians by Israel and the United Nations (UN). They have faced many of the same restrictions on their lives as have the Palestinians.|$|E
2500|$|In November 1978, a Labor Government {{introduced}} a Bill to establish Pitjantjatjara land rights. Before long, {{a group of}} miners from Mintabie had expressed <b>their</b> strong <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> the Bill. They warned that the proposed legislation would: ...|$|R

5|$|Germans viewed this clause as a {{national}} humiliation, forcing Germany to accept full responsibility for causing the war. German politicians were vocal in <b>their</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> the article {{in an attempt to}} generate international sympathy, while German historians worked to undermine the article with the objective of subverting the entire treaty. The Allied leaders were surprised at the German reaction; they saw the article only as a necessary legal basis to extract compensation from Germany. The article, with the signatory's name changed, was also included in the treaties signed by Germany's allies who did not view the clause with the same disdain as the Germans did. American diplomat John Foster Dullesone of the two authors of the articlelater regretted the wording used, believing it further aggravated the German people.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{continued}} to publicly support the Provisions of Oxford, but he secretly opened discussions with Pope Urban IV, {{hoping to be}} absolved from the oath he had made at Oxford. In June 1261, the King announced that Rome had released him from his promises and he promptly held a counter-coup {{with the support of}} Edward. He purged the ranks of the sheriffs of his enemies and seized back control of many of the royal castles. The baronial opposition, led by de Montfort and de Clare, were temporarily reunited in <b>their</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> Henry's actions, convening their own parliament, independent of the King, and establishing a rival system of local government across England. Henry and Eleanor mobilised their own supporters and raised a foreign mercenary army. Facing the threat of open civil war, the barons backed down: de Clare switched sides once again, de Montfort left for exile in France and the baronial resistance collapsed.|$|E
5|$|In 1901, the Democratic-dominated state {{legislature}} {{passed a bill}} requiring payment of a poll tax for voting, which effectively disenfranchised most blacks, and many poor whites and Latinos. In addition, the legislature established white primaries, ensuring that minorities {{were excluded from the}} formal political process. The number of voters dropped dramatically, and the Democrats crushed competition from the Republican and Populist parties. The Socialist Party became the second largest party in Texas after 1912, coinciding with a large socialist upsurge in the United States during fierce battles in the labor movement and the popularity of national heroes like Eugene V. Debs. The Socialists' popularity soon waned after their vilification by the United States government for <b>their</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> US involvement in World War I.|$|E
30|$|The {{interpretation}} of taxation as costs of Wb outlines {{the significance of}} the “Wicksellian connection” (Winer 2016). When the taxpayers perceive that legal taxes surpass {{the quality and quantity of}} the supplied public goods and services, <b>their</b> enforcing <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> such a system is expectable.|$|R
