2500|$|Looking {{for a more}} hard-hitting sound {{than that}} of their {{previous}} album, U2 began recording How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb in February 2003 with Thomas. After nine months of work, the band had an album's worth of material ready for release, {{but they were not}} satisfied with the results. The group subsequently enlisted Lillywhite to take over as producer in Dublin in January 2004. Lillywhite, along with his assistant Lee, spent six months with the band reworking songs and encouraging better performances. U2 lead singer Bono described the album as [...] "our first rock album. It's taken us twenty years or whatever it is, but <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>our</b> <b>first</b> rock album." [...] Thematically, the record touches on life, death, love, war, faith, and family.|$|E
2500|$|Each {{integral}} {{curve of}} the timelike unit vector field [...] appears in the cylindrical chart as a helix with constant radius (such as the red curve in Fig.nbsp&1). [...] Suppose we choose one Langevin observer and consider the other observers who ride on a ring of radius R which is rigidly rotating with angular velocity ω. [...] Then if we take an integral curve (blue helical curve in Fig.nbsp&1) of the spacelike basis vector , we obtain a curve which we might hope {{can be interpreted as}} a [...] "line of simultaneity" [...] for the ring-riding observers. [...] But as we see from Fig.nbsp&1, ideal clocks carried by these ring-riding observers cannot be synchronized. [...] <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>our</b> <b>first</b> hint that it is not as easy as one might expect to define a satisfactory notion of spatial geometry even for a rotating ring, much less a rotating disk! ...|$|E

6000|$|Now, as <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>our</b> <b>first</b> hold-up, we hadn't {{agreed upon}} any code of ethics, so I hardly {{knew what to}} answer. But, anyway, I replied: [...] "Well, not as a specialty. If this {{contains}} your personal property {{you can have it}} back." ...|$|R

Consider that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>our</b> <b>first</b> day of summer--the first time {{we have seen the}} sun make diamonds on the sea, the first west wind which has come to us with the scent of cowslips and wild roses.

One of our first duties will be to learn the country well, {{so that we may}} know where to defend ourselves, should they come up after us; where, from eminences, we can cast down rocks upon them; where there are crags which we can climb, but up which their heavy-armed {{soldiers}} cannot follow us. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>our</b> <b>first</b> task for, as yet, they have not commenced the siege of Gamala.

6000|$|Thus we may {{say that}} a {{permanent}} ideal is as necessary to the innovator as to the conservative; it is necessary whether we wish the king's orders to be promptly executed or whether we only wish the king to be promptly executed. The guillotine has many sins, but to do it justice there is nothing evolutionary about it. The favourite evolutionary argument finds its best answer in the axe. The Evolutionist says, [...] "Where {{do you draw the}} line?" [...] the Revolutionist answers, [...] "I draw it HERE: exactly between your head and body." [...] There must at any given moment be an abstract right and wrong if any blow is to be struck; there must be something eternal {{if there is to be}} anything sudden. Therefore for all intelligible human purposes, for altering things or for keeping things as they are, for founding a system for ever, as in China, or for altering it every month as in the early French Revolution, it is equally necessary that the vision should be a fixed vision. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>our</b> <b>first</b> requirement.|$|E

We have met before, but not here. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>our</b> <b>first</b> meeting here. We have {{travelled}} a long path to get here. Some of our brethren have travelled farther. They are at Detroit. They went there to meet our great Canada father, and to take Yankee scalps. How many scalps they have taken I do not know, or I would tell you. It is pleasant to me to count Yankee scalps. I would rather count them, than count the scalps of red men. There are still a great many left. The Yankees are many, and each Yankee has a scalp. There should not be so many. When the buffaloes came in the largest droves, our fathers {{used to go out}} to hunt them in the strongest parties. Their sons should do the same. We are the sons of those fathers. They say we look like them, talk like them, live like them--we should ACT like them. Let another speak, for I have done." ...|$|E
60|$|At the Gare de Lyon poilus {{are taking}} trains for the South. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>our</b> <b>first</b> real {{sight of them}} in their tired glory. They look weary and dusty and strong; every face has character, no face looks empty or as if its thought were being done by others. Their {{laughter}} is not vulgar or thick. Alongside their faces the English face looks stupid, the English body angular and--neat. They are loaded with queer burdens, bread and bottles bulge their pockets; their blue-grey is prettier than khaki, their round helmets are becoming. Our Tommies, even to our own eyes, seem uniformed, but hardly two out of all this crowd are dressed alike. The French soldier luxuriates in extremes; he can go to his death in white gloves and dandyism--he can glory in unshavenness and patches. The words in extremis seem dear to the French soldier; and, con amore, he passes from one extreme to the other. One of them stands gazing up at the board which gives the hours of starting and the destinations of the trains. His tired face is charming, and has a look that I cannot describe--lost, as it were, to all surroundings; a Welshman or a Highlander, but no pure Englishman, could look like that.|$|E

2500|$|Given {{that the}} band's {{background}} was exclusively in heavy music at that point, some band members experienced difficulties expanding their sound early on. In particular, Spruance noted that Mike Patton {{had to teach}} him to play the ska stroke for a performance at their high school talent show. Spruance later explained, [...] "Oh, what I remember <b>was...</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>our</b> <b>first...</b> like, we had only done, uh, death metal up to that point. And so <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>our</b> <b>first</b> time trying to ever play ska. And I'd never played... on guitar, like, I'd never played... I didn't {{know how to do}} that skanking guitar shit at all. But Patton could do, like with one finger on the thread mark, he could do the, the rhythmic part of it pretty well. Like, he could... he taught me how to do it. So, I just sort of awkwardly... I would fill in and make the chord and he actually played guitar, but would just kind of use it percussively. And we played these Camper Van Beethoven songs, and I don't... I dunno if we played The Specials, but that's what we were listening to." ...|$|R
