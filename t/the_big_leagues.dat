5|$|The {{entry of}} the United States into World War I {{occurred}} {{at the start of}} the season and overshadowed the sport. Conscription was introduced in September 1917, and most baseball players in <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>leagues</b> were of draft age. This included Barry, who was a player-manager, and who joined the Naval Reserve in an attempt to avoid the draft, only to be called up after the 1917 season. Frazee hired International League President Ed Barrow as Red Sox manager. Barrow had spent the previous 30 years in a variety of baseball jobs, though he never played the game professionally. With the major leagues shorthanded due to the war, Barrow had many holes in the Red Sox lineup to fill.|$|E
5|$|Lee Smith {{was born}} in Jamestown, Louisiana, {{and raised in the}} small town of Castor in Bienville Parish. Buck O'Neil claimed credit for having scouted him. At age 17, partly on O'Neil's recommendation, Smith was drafted in the second round as the 28th overall pick by the Chicago Cubs in the 1975 draft. Smith began his {{professional}} career as a starting pitcher. In 1978 with the Class AA minor league Midland Cubs, Smith struggled as a starter with an ERA near 6.00, prompting manager Randy Hundley to move him to the bullpen. Smith resisted the move and briefly tried college basketball at Northwestern State University. At the behest of former Cubs outfielder Billy Williams, Smith returned to Midland as a reliever for the 1979 season and pitched well enough to earn a promotion to Class AAA baseball for 1980. With the major league Chicago Cubs struggling to a last-place finish, Smith came into <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>leagues</b> as a September call-up that season.|$|E

25|$|The {{two biggest}} moves the Astros {{made in the}} offseason were the {{acquisitions}} of Joe Niekro and José Cruz. The Astros bought Niekro from the Braves for almost nothing.

His older brother Phil Niekro had started teaching Joe how to throw his knuckleball and Joe {{was just starting to}} use it {{when he came to the}} Astros. Niekro won six games, saved four games and had an ERA of 3.07. José Cruz was also a steal, in retrospect, from the Cardinals. Cruz became a fixture in the Astros' outfield for several years and would eventually have his number 25 retired.|$|E
