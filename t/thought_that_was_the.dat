The Astros would later select him with the second overall pick in the 1969 amateur baseball draft, behind the Washington Senators' selection of outfielder Jeff Burroughs. Richard later recalled, [...] "There were other guys in my high school with as much ability as I had, but instead of working at a job, they wanted to drink wine on Saturday nights. They <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> in thing to do, and consequently our lives went in different directions. For some people it takes that to make a world. It does not for me." ...|$|E

The film was called an [...] "anti-romantic opus of sexual obsession and cruelty" [...] by the Washington Post. His other work in period pieces such as Ken Russell's horror film The Lair of the White Worm (1988), award-winning Merchant-Ivory drama The Remains of the Day (1993) and (as Frédéric Chopin in) Impromptu (1991) went largely unnoticed. He later called this phase of his career [...] "hilarious," [...] referring to his early films as [...] "Europuddings, where {{you would have a}} French script, a Spanish director, and English actors. The script would usually be written by a foreigner, badly translated into English. And then they'd get English actors in, because they <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> way to sell it to America." ...|$|E

Salvatore sent Mary Kirchoff, then {{managing}} editor of TSR's book department, a manuscript for what would become his 1990 novel Echoes of the Fourth Magic. She liked it, but {{asked if he could}} rewrite it to take place in the Forgotten Realms. She sent him Darkwalker on Moonshae by Douglas Niles, the only novel at the time set in the Forgotten Realms. Salvatore sent her a proposal for a sequel to Darkwalker, but Kirchoff sent back a large map of the Forgotten Realms and told him she wanted a new story set in {{a different part of the}} Realms. After two weeks of phone calls, Salvatore found a spot on the map that was not already designated for another project, and he located Icewind Dale there. According to Salvatore, the book was [...] "set on the Moonshae Isles, because at the time I <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Realms.

500|$|At {{the end of}} May, Island Def Jam {{pushed forward}} the release date for Graduation up from September to an {{unspecified}} late August date, a decision that West first announced on the introductory track of his Can't Tell Me Nothing mixtape. On July 19, the album's release date was changed once more and moved to September 11, 2007, the same US release date as rapper 50 Cent's third studio album Curtis. When first presented with the proposal of his label moving the release date of his album yet again {{as well as the}} idea of a sales competition between him and 50 Cent, West initially expressed his indifference towards the thought, saying, [...] "When I heard that thing about the debate, I <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> stupidest thing. When my album drops and 50's album drops, everybody wins because you're gonna get a lot of good music at the same time." [...] However, then Def Jam president and CEO Jay Z welcomed competition, feeling that it would be prosperous for hip-hop and the date became permanent.|$|E
500|$|The {{screenplay}} {{was written}} by Eric Warren Singer after he developed {{an interest in the}} banking scandals from the 1980s and 90s, he was looking for [...] "a paranoid thriller vibe" [...] from that period; [...] "The Godfather III was really the only film up to this point that dealt with the banking scandals, because it was really gangster warfare on a corporate level, and I <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> best part of the film." [...] Later reviewers compared it directly to The Parallax View (1974) and All The President's Men (1976). [...] Ridley Scott initially expressed an interest in directing the film, and the studio agreed to finance the project, only for Scott to drop out. A year later Tom Tykwer got involved through his agent, but decided a contemporary setting would work better. In April 2007, Clive Owen agreed to perform in The International. He said the script interested him because he was reminded of [...] "those '70s paranoia pictures" [...] and because it combined a factual, intelligent basis with an international thriller plot. The following July, actress Naomi Watts was cast opposite Owen. In August, the film received US$5.4 million from the [...] toward its budget. The following month its funding increased to $7.9 million, based on the board's assessment that two-thirds of The International would be produced in Germany and that a number of Germans were in important roles, such as actors Armin Mueller-Stahl and Axel Milberg, cinematographer Frank Griebe, and production designer Uli Hanisch. Filming began in Berlin on 10 September 2007. Part of the production took place in Babelsberg Studios.|$|E
500|$|Wright scored his 27th {{goal of the}} season, away at Chelsea in {{the first}} week of April; it took him seven goals short of {{breaking}} Cliff Bastin's career record at Arsenal. A win against Leicester City was Arsenal's fifth league win in six matches and boosted the club's chances of finishing second, which came with a spot in the Champions League. Wenger assessed that it was [...] "not impossible to win the title", adding [...] "but when you see Manchester United winning again, realistically you would like to be in their position." [...] A last-minute equaliser for Blackburn Rovers against Arsenal on 19 April 1997 was controversial given the manner the opposition had scored; with Hughes cramped, Vieira kicked the ball out in order for his teammate to be treated. It was anticipated [...] "by the game's conventions", Blackburn should have thrown the ball back unchallenged, but striker Chris Sutton forced a corner. The result prompted Wenger to rule out any chance of winning the league: [...] "The best team [...] has won. But the race for second place is still open and for many weeks I have <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> best we could achieve." [...] A further draw against Coventry City, who were fighting to stay another season in the top-flight, moved Arsenal to within four points of Manchester United. They had however played two games more than the incumbent champions and one more than Liverpool sitting in third. Robbie Elliott scored the winner for Newcastle United against Arsenal on 3 May 1997, which reignited their chances of finishing second. Arsenal ended their league campaign against Derby County, who staged their final match at the Baseball Ground. In spite of winning by three goals to one, having played with ten men for the majority of the game, they missed out on second by goal difference to Newcastle.|$|E

500|$|Laughton was {{so pleased}} with O'Hara's {{performance}} in Jamaica Inn {{that she was}} cast opposite him in The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1939) for RKO in Hollywood. She boarded the RMS Queen Mary with him and her mother to New York, and then traveled by train to Hollywood. O'Hara's agent Lew Wasserman arranged for a pay increase from $80 a week to $700 a week. As {{the new face of}} RKO she garnered much attention from the Hollywood press and society before the film was even released, something which made her uncomfortable as she felt that she was being viewed as a [...] "novelty" [...] and [...] "people were making a fuss over me because of something I hadn't yet done, something they just thought I might do". O'Hara portrayed Esmeralda, a gypsy dancer who is imprisoned and later sentenced to death by the Parisian authorities. Director William Dieterle initially showed concern that O'Hara was too tall and disliked her wavy hair, asking for her to step under a shower to straighten it out. Filming commenced in the San Fernando Valley, {{at a time when the}} city was experiencing its hottest summer in its history. O'Hara described it as a [...] "physically demanding shoot", due to the heavy makeup and costume requirements, and recalls that she gasped at Laughton in makeup as Quasimodo, remarking, [...] "Good God, Charles. Is that really you?". O'Hara insisted on doing her own stunts from the outset, and for the scene in which the hangman places a noose around her neck, no safety nets were used. The film was a commercial success, taking $3 million at the box office. O'Hara was generally praised for her performance though some critics thought that Laughton stole the show. One critic <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> strength of the film, writing: [...] "The contrast between Laughton as the pathetic hunchback and O'Hara as the fresh-faced, tenderly solicitous gypsy girl is Hollywood teaming at its most inspired".|$|E

It was expected to sell well and, for the first time, a video was made to promote one of the band's tracks. However, the song failed to chart. Rough Trade boss Geoff Travis blamed poor promotion: [...] "I can't understand why 'How Soon Is Now?' wasn't a top 10 single, but perhaps I'm being naive. If only their singles had been played on the radio". Morrissey expressed his disappointment {{in an interview with}} Creem magazine: [...] "It's hard to believe that 'How Soon Is Now?' was not a hit.

They went east and arrived at Chapultepec, on the edge of what was then Lake Texcoco. The god told them that their promised land was close but that they would have to fight for it. Their first opponent was a chief named Cópil, son of a witch named Malinalxochitl and sister of Huitzilopochtli. The Mexica surrounded Cópil's forces, captured and sacrificed the chief's heart to Huitzilopochtli.|$|E

MacFarlane noted that he then wanted to pitch it to Fox, as he <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> place to create a prime-time animation show.
