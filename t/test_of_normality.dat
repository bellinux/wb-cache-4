50|$|If {{the actual}} {{values of the}} first or third quartiles differ {{substantially}} from the calculated values, P is not normally distributed. However, a normal distribution can be trivially perturbed to maintain its Q1 and Q2 std. scores at 0.67 and -0.67 and not be normally distributed (so the above test would produce a false positive). A better <b>test</b> <b>of</b> <b>normality,</b> such as Q-Q plot would be indicated here.|$|E
30|$|Statistical {{analysis}} was performed using the SigmaStat 3.0 software programme (SPSS). The different groups were analysed using t-tests to satisfy the <b>test</b> <b>of</b> <b>normality.</b> Where they failed the <b>test</b> <b>of</b> <b>normality,</b> nonparametric tests were used, namely the Mann-Whitney rank sum test.

40|$|The {{application}} of the most statistical process control techniques {{is based on the}} assumption that the distribution of the measurements is normal. However, there are many situations in practice when the process data distribution is not normal. In certain cases, the Box-Cox transformation can be used for converting the process data distribution into a normal distribution. Considering these aspects, the paper presents a method of application for the xbar and s chart that can be used in the case when the measurements distribution is not normal. The proposed method consists of the following stages: the <b>testing</b> <b>of</b> <b>normality</b> <b>of</b> the process data, the {{application of}} the Box-Cox transformation and the <b>testing</b> <b>of</b> <b>normality</b> <b>of</b> the transformed data.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} a <b>test</b> <b>of</b> <b>normality</b> of gene {{expressions}} data. Based on characterization theorems of the normal distribution, the <b>test</b> <b>of</b> <b>normality</b> {{is replaced by a}} test of spherical uniformity. Due to strong correlations between the gene expression data, the normality test is conducted with δ sequences. A new characterization theorem of the normal distribution is proven. Based on that, the normality test is conducted using Kolmogorov's test statistic. The obtained characterization results for the normal distribution are extended to the complete type of distributions and based on that, a test is conducted to verify whether the distributions of the two data sets of the gene expressions belong to the same type.

40|$|We {{present the}} {{sampling}} distributions for {{the coefficient of}} skewness, kurtosis, and a joint <b>test</b> <b>of</b> <b>normality</b> for time series observations. In contrast to independent and identically distributed data, the limiting distributions of the statistics are shown {{to depend on the}} long run rather than the short-run variance of relevant sample moments. Monte Carlo simulations show that the test statistics for symmetry and normality have good finite sample size and power. However, size distortions render testing for kurtosis almost meaningless except for distributions with thin tails such as the normal distribution. Nevertheless, this general weakness of testing for kurtosis is of little consequence for testing normality. Combining skewness and kurtosis as in Bera and Jarque (1981) is still a useful <b>test</b> <b>of</b> <b>normality</b> provided the limiting variance accounts for the serial correlation in the data. symmetry, kurtosis, normality, Bera-Jarque test...|$|E
