For example, Taloche is shown as being afraid of ghosts, which echoes the Romani phobia. For Taloche's role, Gatlif needed a musician with acrobatic skills, which {{was very hard to}} find. In Paris at the Théâtre de la Ville, he was impressed James Thiérrée, a grandson of Charlie Chaplin. A non-Romani, (though Chaplin's grandmother was Romani) Thiérrée learned Romanes and Romani swing music in six months.|$|E

Manga-News however criticized how Shinichi and Ran's interaction were covered by flashbacks instead of happening chronologically.

Multivariate Poisson-Charlier, Meixner and Hermite-Chebycheff orthogonal polynomials, used in <b>the</b> <b>characterizations,</b> are constructed from classical 1 -dimensional orthogonal polynomials and multivariate Krawtchouk polynomials. New classes of transition functions of discrete and continuous time Markov chains with these polynomials as eigenfunctions are characterized. <b>The</b> <b>characterizations</b> obtained {{belong to a}} class of mixtures of multi-type birth and death processes with fixed multivariate Poisson or multivariate negative binomial stationary distributions...|$|R

5|$|Since archaeoastronomers {{disagree}} {{so widely}} on <b>the</b> <b>characterization</b> of the discipline, they even dispute its name. All three major international scholarly associations relate archaeoastronomy {{to the study}} of culture, using the term Astronomy in Culture or a translation. Michael Hoskin sees {{an important part of the}} discipline as fact-collecting, rather than theorizing, and proposed to label this aspect of the discipline Archaeotopography. Ruggles and Saunders proposed Cultural Astronomy as a unifying term for the various methods of studying folk astronomies. Others have argued that astronomy is an inaccurate term, what are being studied are cosmologies and people who object to the use of logos have suggested adopting the Spanish cosmovisión.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>characterization</b> of Neville Sinclair was {{inspired}} by movie star Errol Flynn, or rather by the image of Flynn that had been popularized by Charles Higham's unauthorized and fabricated biography of the actor, in which he asserted that Flynn was, among other things, a Nazi spy. The film's Neville Sinclair is, like Higham's Flynn, a movie star known {{for his work in}} swashbuckler roles, and who is secretly a Nazi spy. Because Higham's biography of Flynn was not refuted until the late 1980s, the image of Flynn as a closet Nazi remained current all through the arduous process of writing and re-writing the script. The other real-life characterization was of Howard Hughes.|$|E
