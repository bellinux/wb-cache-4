5|$|Although Douglas {{had been}} <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> misfortunes, he and Wilde were reunited in August 1897 at Rouen. This meeting was disapproved {{of by the}} friends and {{families}} of both men. Constance Wilde was already refusing to meet Wilde or allow him to see their sons, though she sent him money – a meagre three pounds a week. During {{the latter part of}} 1897, Wilde and Douglas lived together near Naples for a few months until they were separated by their families under the threat of cutting off all funds.|$|E

5|$|Around Vikram 1664 (1607 CE), Tulsidas was {{afflicted by}} acute pain {{all over his}} body, {{especially}} in his arms. He then composed the Hanuman Bahuk, where he describes his bodily pain and suffering in several stanzas. He was relieved of his pain after this composition. Later he was also afflicted by Bartod boils (Hindi: बरतोड़, furuncles caused by {{pulling out of the}} hair), which may have been <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> death.|$|E
5|$|Chopin's {{disease and}} <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> death {{have since been}} a matter of discussion. His death {{certificate}} gave the cause as tuberculosis, and his physician, Jean Cruveilhier, was then the leading French authority on this disease. Other possibilities have been advanced including cystic fibrosis, cirrhosis and alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency. In 2017, an autopsy was performed on Chopin's preserved heart, which confirmed that a rare case of pericarditis, caused by complications from chronic tuberculosis, was the likely cause of his death.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Mandela inaugurated the Nelson Mandela Annual Lecture, and in 2003 the Mandela Rhodes Foundation {{was created}} at Rhodes House, University of Oxford, to provide {{postgraduate}} scholarships to African students.

He gave the closing address at the XIII International AIDS Conference in Durban in 2000, and in 2004, spoke at the XV International AIDS Conference in Bangkok, Thailand, calling for greater measures to tackle tuberculosis as well as HIV/AIDS. Mandela publicised AIDS as <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> son Makgatho's death in January 2005, to defy the stigma about discussing the disease.|$|E

25|$|Nicolas Fouquet's curiosity in {{the matter}} was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> disgrace, for, when he bribed Louise, the King mistakenly thought that Fouquet was {{attempting}} to take her as a lover.|$|R
5|$|In September 2005, an Israeli-declared AIDS expert {{claimed that}} Arafat bore all the {{symptoms}} of AIDS based on obtained medical records. But others, including Patrice Mangin of the University of Lausanne and The New York Times disagreed with this claim, insisting that Arafat's record indicated that it was highly unlikely that <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> death was AIDS. Arafat's personal doctor Ashraf al-Kurdi and aide Bassam Abu Sharif maintained that Arafat was poisoned, possibly by thallium. A senior Israeli physician concluded that Arafat died from food poisoning. Both those claims were rejected by Haaretz and The New York Times. Then-Palestinian foreign minister Nabil Shaath had also ruled out poisoning after talks with Arafat's French doctors.|$|E
5|$|In {{his later}} years, White {{and his wife}} resided in St. Petersburg, Florida during the winter season.

The medical {{certification}} of White's death stated <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> heart failure was due to age and overexertion. White's funeral was held in Charleston, and he was interred in the White family burial plot at Indian Mound Cemetery in Romney. At the time of his death, White was residing at 610½ Capitol Street in Charleston.|$|E
5|$|In {{the later}} {{part of his}} life, George III had recurrent, and {{eventually}} permanent, mental illness.

After a final relapse in 1810, a regency was established, and George III's eldest son, George, Prince of Wales, ruled as Prince Regent. On George III's death, the Prince Regent succeeded his father as George IV.|$|E
50|$|On 6 August 1917, Zimmermann {{resigned}} as foreign secretary and was succeeded by Richard von Kühlmann. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> resignation was <b>the</b> famous Zimmermann Telegram he sent on 16 January 1917. He died in Berlin in 1940 of pneumonia.|$|R

5|$|It is {{possible}} that his last fight was an 85-minute contest at Shrewsbury in July 1790. This was widely reported in the London press and that of provincial cities but was subsequently denied by newspapers more local to the event. There were unsuccessful attempts after that date to match him against Ben Bryan (sometimes known as Ben Brian, Ben Brain or Ben Bryant), who had by that time defeated Johnson. Indeed, these attempts, conducted by Daniel Mendoza, did not help <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> employment with Boulton and Watt as the firm {{thought that they were}} a distraction and expressed concern regarding his commitment to his work.|$|E
5|$|Jones {{retired from}} his {{surveying}} work in 1800, for reasons unknown. Various reasons have been suggested; Jones {{was known as}} an extremely hard worker, and may have wanted less strenuous work as a farmer, his ties to Joseph Brant may have been politically problematic as Brant was frequently in conflict with Upper Canada authorities, and {{his status as a}} loyalist to the British Empire may have come into question as it became known his brother in law, James Gage, had fought with the Americans during the revolution, and his brother Ebenezer may have as well. Whatever <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> retirement, Jones returned to his farm in Saltfleet Township and began life as a farmer.|$|E
5|$|Kīnaʻu died on September 9, 1859 in Kapaʻau, Kohala {{district}} on {{the island}} of Hawaiʻi. <b>The</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> death was said to be an accident, although the details are unknown.

5|$|Nine days later, {{he checked}} into Methodist Hospital in Houston {{for a series}} of {{physical}} and psychological tests to determine <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> mysterious arm problems. An angiogram revealed an obstruction in the distal subclavian and axillary arteries of the right arm. Richard's blood pressure in his left arm was normal but pressure was nearly absent in his right arm due to the completely obstructed artery. On July 25, however, the arteries in his neck were studied, and the doctors reached a conclusion that all was normal and no surgical treatment needed to be performed.|$|E
5|$|On 15 June 1645, Koniecpolski's wife, Krystyna, died. Koniecpolski {{remarried}} soon after, {{taking the}} hand of 16-year-old Zofia Opalińska, daughter of future Crown Marshal Łukasz Opaliński, on 16 January 1646. The marriage was short lived, though, ending with Koniecpolski's death in Brody on 11 March 1646. Sources suggest that his new marriage was <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> death; Joachim Jerlicz wrote in his diary that Koniecpolski had overdosed on an aphrodisiac. His funeral was held in Brody on 30 April 1646.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{death has}} been debated. Napoleon's physician, François Carlo Antommarchi, led the autopsy, which found {{the cause of}} death to be stomach cancer. Antommarchi did not sign the {{official}} report. Napoleon's father had died of stomach cancer, although this was seemingly unknown {{at the time of the}} autopsy. Antommarchi found evidence of a stomach ulcer; this was the most convenient explanation for the British, who wanted to avoid criticism over their care of Napoleon.|$|E

5|$|Though {{at first}} Silver stalks Sonic and impedes his {{attempts}} to save Elise, Shadow reveals to him that Sonic is not <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> world's suffering but rather Mephiles, {{who is trying to}} erase the past for his own evil purposes. Throughout the story, Sonic and friends travel between the past, present, and future in their efforts to stop Mephiles and Iblis and protect Elise from Doctor Eggman. They learn that Mephiles seeks to bond with Iblis, as they are the two halves of Soleanna's omnipotent god, Solaris. Mephiles succeeds, but Sonic, Shadow, and Silver use the power of the Chaos Emeralds to transform into their super forms and defeat Solaris.|$|E
5|$|Wiśniowiecki's indebted {{family was}} not able to provide him with a funeral his rank and fame deserved.

5|$|Breckinridge {{returned}} to Cabell's Dale in early 1806 and fell ill in June. In July, he visited Kentucky's Olympian Springs, {{hoping it would}} aid his recovery, but it did not. Doctors disagreed on <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> illness, with diagnoses ranging from typhus fever to stomach ailments. He attempted to return to Washington, D.C., on October 22, but while his horse was being prepared for the journey, he collapsed in pain {{and had to be}} helped back inside. Friends and relatives hoped for a recovery that never came, and he died on December 14, 1806. The cause of death was eventually determined to be tuberculosis. According to family tradition, Polly Breckinridge was so distraught over her husband's death that she went blind from her incessant crying. Breckinridge was first buried at Cabell's Dale on December 16 but was later reinterred in Lexington Cemetery.|$|E
