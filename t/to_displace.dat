5|$|Alexander made a {{cautious}} and slow advance, intending to base his strategy {{on the structure}} of the Persian force. He led a flank of his Companion cavalry on the right, while the Thessalian cavalry were dispatched to the left, as a counter to Nabarsanes' mounted unit. Aware {{of the importance of the}} foothills to his right, Alexander sent a band of light infantry, archers, and cavalry <b>to</b> <b>displace</b> the defence Darius had stationed there. The enterprise was successful – those Persians not killed were forced to seek refuge higher in the mountains.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the portion}} of the highway between the eastern {{terminus}} and the Muskogee Turnpike, known as the Broken Arrow south loop, was scheduled to begin in May 1999 and be completed in January 2001. The section from the Muskogee Turnpike north to the Will Rogers Turnpike was to begin construction in September 1999 and be completed in January 2002. Unlike the section of the turnpike built in the early 1990s, this section was expected <b>to</b> <b>displace</b> few residents; the city of Broken Arrow had purchased much of the right-of-way ahead of time to preserve the corridor for the expected turnpike.|$|E
5|$|Less {{powerful}} woodland owls such as {{the little}} owl and the long-eared owl cannot usually co-exist with the stronger tawny owls, which may take them as food items, and are found in different habitats; in Ireland {{the absence of the}} tawny owl allowed the long-eared owl to become the dominant owl.

5|$|The {{clinical}} {{signs and symptoms}} of AML result from the growth of leukemic clone cells, which tends <b>to</b> <b>displace</b> or interfere with the development of normal blood cells in the bone marrow. This leads to neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. The symptoms of AML are, in turn, often due to the low numbers of these normal blood elements. In rare cases, people with AML can develop a chloroma, or solid tumor of leukemic cells outside the bone marrow, which can cause various symptoms depending on its location.|$|E

5|$|Throughout Bell's {{affiliation}} with the Steelers, he suffered monetarily and Rooney bought an increasing allotment of the franchise from him. Compounding Bell's problems, Arch Ward organized the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) in 1944 <b>to</b> <b>displace</b> the NFL's sovereignty in professional football. Ward's AAFC promptly began luring players to join the league, which resulted in salaries being driven up drastically. In Bill Dudley's contract proceedings with the Steelers, he attributed Bell's anxiety during the negotiations to the rivalry from the AAFC. Furthermore, {{by the end of}} 1945, the Steelers were in their most economically perilous situation in its history.|$|E
5|$|A {{network of}} roads {{developed}} in the Lowlands in this period. Drover's roads, between the Highlands and north-east England, had become established {{by the end of}} the seventeenth century and a series of military roads were built and maintained as a response to the Jacobite Risings in the eighteenth century. At the beginning of the period, most farming was based on the Lowland fermtoun or Highland baile, but a system of land ownership based on large estates emerged. This was the beginning of a process that would create a landscape of rectangular fields and carefully located farm complexes with interconnecting roads. There was an attempt improve agriculture, resulting in new crops, techniques and enclosures began <b>to</b> <b>displace</b> the run rig system and free pasture.|$|E

5|$|Agonistic {{behaviour}} typically {{consists of}} squabbles between individuals climbing over or passing each other. This occasionally involves biting. Males that are strangers may wrestle, chase, and bite each other. In extreme situations, a male may try <b>to</b> <b>displace</b> a smaller rival from a tree. This involves the larger aggressor climbing up {{and attempting to}} corner the victim, which tries either to rush past him and climb down or {{to move to the}} end of a branch. The aggressor attacks by grasping the target by the shoulders and repeatedly biting him. Once the weaker individual is driven away, the victor bellows and marks the tree. Pregnant and lactating females are particularly aggressive and attack individuals that come too close. In general, however, koalas tend to avoid energy-wasting aggressive behaviour.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{is known}} to {{interact}} with other drugs. For example, acetazolamide and ammonium chloride are known to enhance the intoxicating effect of salicylates, and alcohol also increases the gastrointestinal bleeding associated with these types of drugs. Aspirin is known <b>to</b> <b>displace</b> a number of drugs from protein-binding sites in the blood, including the antidiabetic drugs tolbutamide and chlorpropamide, warfarin, methotrexate, phenytoin, probenecid, valproic acid (as well as interfering with beta oxidation, {{an important part of}} valproate metabolism), and other NSAIDs. Corticosteroids may also reduce the concentration of aspirin. Ibuprofen can negate the antiplatelet effect of aspirin used for cardioprotection and stroke prevention. The pharmacological activity of spironolactone may be reduced by taking aspirin, and it {{is known to}} compete with penicillin G for renal tubular secretion. Aspirin may also inhibit the absorption of vitamin C.|$|E
5|$|Because it {{is lighter}} than air, {{airships}} and balloons are inflated with helium for lift. While hydrogen gas is more buoyant, and escapes permeating through a membrane {{at a lower}} rate, helium {{has the advantage of}} being non-flammable, and indeed fire-retardant. Another minor use is in rocketry, where helium is used as an ullage medium <b>to</b> <b>displace</b> fuel and oxidizers in storage tanks and to condense hydrogen and oxygen to make rocket fuel. It is also used to purge fuel and oxidizer from ground support equipment prior to launch and to pre-cool liquid hydrogen in space vehicles. For example, the Saturn V rocket used in the Apollo program needed about 370,000m3 (13 million cubic feet) of helium to launch.|$|E
