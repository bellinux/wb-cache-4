40|$|Gillespie, John W. The {{present study}} {{involves}} the transverse static and fatigue loading of bolted joints in a discontinuous ceramic cored sandwich structure (DCCSS). DCCSS structures {{are commonly used}} in armored vehicle applications. The DCCSS is a hybrid symmetric composite laminate {{made up of a}} face sheet, adhesive interlayer, and a discontinuous tile array core infused with FCS 2 epoxy resin. Static tests were performed with the varying of support conditions from simply supported, pinned, and torqued bolts. The goal was to understand the change in strength and failure modes due to the joint under transverse loading. Optimization of the joint was also involved, thus the torque levels were also varied <b>to</b> <b>conclude</b> <b>t</b> he best torque level for performance of the joint. It was found out that the bolted joint improved the performance and strength of the DCCSS in comparison to the simply supported and pinned support conditions. The failure mode of the DCCSS changed with each support condition, but ultimate failure was consistently due to delamination between the adhesive interlayer and face sheet. The optimal torque level of 90 ft-lbs. was determined from static testing. The influence of fatigue on stiffness retention, residual strength and damage were also conducted for both pinned and torqued support conditions to study durability. The bolted joint helped maintain the strength of the joint and stiffness of the structure in comparison to the pinned condition. University of Delaware, Department of Civil EngineeringM. C. E...|$|E
40|$|We have {{demonstrated}} previously that binding of eph-rin-A 1 to EphA receptors on human CD 4 and CD 8 T cells stimulates migration. Two EphA receptors {{have been reported}} in T cells: EphA 1 at the protein level and EphA 4 at the mRNA level. In this study, we wanted to investigate the expression profile of these receptors in T cell subpopulations and to test if expression differ-ences would affect the potential of cells to migrate upon ephrin-A 1 binding. We have generated an anti-EphA 4 mAb for expression analysis. Our data show that functional EphA 4 is expressed on the cell surface of CD 4 and CD 8 T cells. In addition, EphA 4 receptor ex-pression is induced after overnight incubation in serum-free medium, in particular, on CD 4 CD 45 RO T cells. Migration of CD 4 T cells in response to ephrin-A 1 is observed for memory cells (CD 45 RO) and much weaker for naı̈ve cells (CD 45 RA). A signaling complex associated with the EphA 4 receptor has also been iso-lated and includes EphA 1, the Src family kinases Fyn and Lck, Slp 76, and Vav 1. <b>To</b> <b>conclude,</b> <b>T</b> cells express EphA 1 and EphA 4 receptors.

Rps 3 a, Fte- 1 and TU- 11 are thus one and the same gene. Similarity was also found between this gene and non-mammalian sequences reported to be involved in cell cycling. Like the Rps 3 a transcript level, the c-Fos transcript level is higher in transformed cells. Rps 3 a and Fos could thus be effectors of the transformed phenotype.

40|$|Hips with a cam {{deformity}} are at {{risk for}} early cartilage degeneration, mainly in the anterolateral region of the joint. T 1 ρ MRI is a described technique for assessment of proteoglycan content in hyaline cartilage and subsequently early cartilage damage. In this study, 1. 5 Tesla T 1 ρ MRI was performed on 20 asymptomatic hips with a cam deformity and compared to 16 healthy control hips. Cam deformity was defined as an alpha angle at 1 : 30 o'clock position over 60 ° and/or at 3 : 00 o'clock position over 50. 5 °. Hip cartilage was segmented and divided into four regions of interest (ROIs) : anterolateral, anteromedial, posterolateral and posteromedial quadrants. Mean T 1 ρ value of the entire weight bearing cartilage in hips with a cam deformity (34. 0 [*]±[*] 4. 6 [*]ms) was significantly higher compared to control hips (31. 3 [*]±[*] 3. 2 [*]ms, p[*]=[*] 0. 050). This difference reached significance in the anterolateral (p[*]=[*] 0. 042) and posteromedial quadrants (p[*]=[*] 0. 041). No significant correlation between the alpha angle and T 1 ρ values was detected. The results indicate cartilage damage occurs in hips with a cam deformity before symptoms occur. A significant difference in T 1 ρ values was found in the anterolateral quadrant, the area of direct engagement of the deformity, and in the posteromedial quadrant. <b>To</b> <b>conclude,</b> <b>T</b> 1 ρ MRI can detect early chondral damage in asymptomatic hips with a cam deformity.

Given two text pairs T 1 and T 2 that are topically related, the task is to nd whether the two statements are in contrast to each other, or not.

40|$|Although several {{molecular}} pathways {{have been}} linked to type 2 diabetes (T 2 D) pathogenesis, it is uncertain which pathway has the most implication on the disease. Changes in the expression of an entire pathway might be more important for disease pathogenesis than changes in the expression of individual genes. To identify the molecular alterations in T 2 D, DNA microarrays of human pancreatic islets from donors with hyperglycemia (n = 20) and normoglycemia (n = 58) were subjected to Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). About 178 KEGG pathways were investigated for gene expression changes between hyperglycemic donors compared to normoglycemic. Pathway enrichment analysis showed that type II diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM) and maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) pathways are downregulated in hyperglycemic donors, while proteasome and spliceosome pathways are upregulated. The mean centroid of gene expression of T 2 DM and MODY pathways was shown to be associated positively with insulin secretion and negatively with HbA 1 c level. <b>To</b> <b>conclude,</b> downregulation of <b>T</b> 2 DM and MODY pathways is involved in islet function and might be involved in T 2 D.

40|$|Abstract Background Type 2 {{diabetes}} mellitus (T 2 D) poses a large worldwide burden {{for health care}} systems. One possible tool to decrease this burden is primary prevention. As it is unethical to wait until perfect data are available <b>to</b> <b>conclude</b> whether <b>T</b> 2 D primary prevention intervention programmes are cost-effective, we need a model that simulates the effect of prevention initiatives. Thus, {{the aim of this}} study is to investigate the long-term cost-effectiveness of lifestyle intervention programmes for the prevention of T 2 D using a Markov model. As decision makers often face difficulties in applying health economic results, we visualise our results with health economic tools. Methods We use four-state Markov modelling with a probabilistic cohort analysis to calculate the cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. A one-year cycle length and a lifetime time horizon are applied. Best available evidence supplies the model with data on transition probabilities between glycaemic states, mortality risks, utility weights, and disease costs. The costs are calculated from a societal perspective. A 3 % discount rate is used for costs and QALYs. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves are presented to assist decision makers. Results The model indicates that diabetes prevention interventions have the potential to be cost-effective, but the outcome reveals a high level of uncertainty. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were negative for the intervention, ie, the intervention leads to a cost reduction for men and women aged 30 or 50 years at initiation of the intervention. For men and women aged 70 at initiation of the intervention, the ICER was EUR 27, 546 /QALY gained and EUR 19, 433 /QALY gained, respectively. In all cases, the QALYs gained were low. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves show that the higher the willingness-to-pay threshold value, the higher the probability that the intervention is cost-effective. Nonetheless, all curves are flat. The threshold value of EUR 50, 000 /QALY gained has a 30 - 55 % probability that the intervention is cost-effective. Conclusions Lifestyle interventions for primary prevention of type 2 diabetes are cost-saving for men and women aged 30 or 50 years at the start of the intervention, and cost-effective for men and women aged 70 years. However, there is a high degree of uncertainty around the ICERs. With the conservative approach adopted for this model, the long-term effectiveness of the intervention could be underestimated. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background: Diagnosis of Trichomonas vaginalis vaginalis {{infection}} {{based solely}} on clinical symptoms and signs is unreliable because the spectrum of infection is broad and other sexually transmitted pathogens cause similar signs and symptoms. Aims: Our study was undertaken to study the frequency of T. vaginalis infection in women presenting with vaginal discharge, to characterize the clinical features, and to study the sensitivity and specificity of microbiological investigations in the diagnosis of the same. Materials and Methods: This was a hospital-based descriptive study done on 400 female patients with vaginal discharge attending the Gynecology out-patient department (OPD) of JIPMER, Puducherry, from May 2010 to July 2011. Women of age between 20 years and 50 years presenting with vaginal discharge irrespective of marital status, were included, and detailed history was elicited and thorough examination was performed. Results: In 400 women presenting with vaginal discharge from Gynecology out-patient department (OPD) included in the study, T. vaginalis infection was found in 27 (6. 75 %) women. The risk factors for trichomoniasis included history of pre- or extramarital sexual contact in the woman or her partner, symptomatic partner, and alcohol consumption. A positive association with pelvic inflammatory disease was also observed. The most frequent symptoms included lower abdominal pain, dysuria, and dyspareunia. Combining of Whiff test, pH > 4. 5, and pus cells in Gram-stained smear, the specificity in diagnosing the infection (97. 3 %) approached that of the reference standard, i. e., culture. On combining wet mount with Papanicolaou smear, the sensitivity increased to 92. 6 %, which was higher than that individually done. Conclusion: <b>To</b> <b>conclude,</b> diagnosis of <b>T.</b> vaginalis infection {{based solely on}} clinical symptoms and signs is unreliable, and combination of simple laboratory tests increases the diagnostic performance close to the reference standard (culture), especially in resource poor settings...|$|R
