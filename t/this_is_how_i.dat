25|$|This {{is how it}} was for me. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> played it. It's just a pippy-poo {{little book}} and people come back with this {{diatribe}} about its great social significance. Well it's just because nobody ever got off his high horse long enough to write to single women in any form they could associate with. If they had, somebody else would be the arbiter for single women at this point instead of me.|$|E

Sonia Munder had no difficulty recognizing the sneakers of her children, one of Christian age 14 and one of Lisi age 17, by the intricate way her children laced them. Another mother says, [...] "I recognized them just like that. You see, {{there are all kinds}} of inconspicuous marks which strangers do not notice. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> recognized them. My daughter loved to wear them." ...|$|E
500|$|Much of Dignity {{was written}} in Duff's own home, as she felt [...] "comfortable and free" [...] there. She said that she knew from the {{beginning}} that she wanted to write the album with the assistance of songwriter and producer Kara DioGuardi, due to their previous work history on songs such as [...] "Come Clean" [...] and [...] "Fly". Another reason that Duff wished to work with her was that she found her lyrics were complemented by DioGuardi's melodies. She added, [...] "I helped with the melodies, but that's not my strongest suit. Coming up with the lyrics was mainly [...] I'd tell her <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> want it to go, and she would help with the lyrics, too, sometimes. She'd say, 'This doesn't really fit,' and if I was adamant, we'd make it work." ...|$|E

When asked why she chose to work for the federal government, Harden responded, “Because I want to serve my country, and <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> chose to do so.” ...|$|R
500|$|In 1993, Pascu {{experienced}} {{his first}} significant success in music with the album Mixed Grill {{and the single}} [...] "Ţara arde şi babele se piaptănă" [...] ("The Country Is Burning and Old Women Are Combing Their Hair", referencing a Romanian proverb). A poll conducted by the journal Evenimentul Zilei nominated the track as the best song of 1993, and the nationwide station Radio Contact awarded Pascu its [...] "Composer of the Year" [...] title. Mixed Grill marked Pascu's brief experimentation with a fusion of rock and reggae. [...] Hits such as [...] "Gizzi" [...] and [...] "Mi-am luat colac" [...] ("I Got Me a Lifebuoy") led some to consider {{him one of the}} pioneers of Romanian reggae, years ahead of acts like El Negro and Pacha Man. The mix of genres became characteristic of Pascu's work in music: [...] "When I was writing records, I figured that, should someone, say, be playing my record at a party, they would have several kinds to choose from, and they would not grow bored. But it's not because of that, I think that's how inspiration visits me, that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> write. I won't stick to any one musical genre." [...] In addition to the piano, guitar and drums, Pascu also began playing the harmonica.|$|E

[...] "I've {{had more}} {{unsolicited}} advice on my life than I care to mention, and <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> dealt with it. It felt empowering to turn that frustration into music, especially a song that doesn't even sound angry. That's sort of what 'Love Song' was as well. Apparently, I don't get over things very quickly." ...|$|R
2500|$|Pilot Robert White {{commented on}} his high {{altitude}} X-15 flights, [...] "My flights to 217,000 feet [...] and 314,750 feet [...] were very dramatic in revealing the Earth's curvature... at my highest altitude I could turn my head through a 180-degree arc and wow!— the Earth is really round. At my peak altitude I was roughly over the Arizona/California {{border in the}} area of Las Vegas, and <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> described it: Looking to my left I felt I could spit into the Gulf of California; looking to my right I felt I could toss a dime into San Francisco Bay." ...|$|R
2500|$|In a {{description}} of al-Jazzar's rule in Acre, Renaudot wrote that al-Jazzar was [...] "violent, carried away by his temperament; though he is not inaccessible ... He is sometimes just, great, and generous, at other times furious and bloody." [...] Commenting on his method of rule, al-Jazzar wrote [...] "In order to govern {{the people of this}} land, one cannot be too severe. But if I strike with one hand, I recompense with the other. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> maintained for thirty years, in spite of everybody, complete possession of all [...] between the Orontes and the estuary of the Jordan".|$|E

Let it be enough if I say that I have been a guest under Justice Bervie's hospitable roof, and that I know of a Home Office spy who has taken you unawares, under pretense of being your footman.

6000|$|Thomson {{came over}} from Paris {{at that time}} to consult with the authorities, and took up his {{residence}} in the most overgrown hotel in London. His friends here organized an expedition for his relief. They wandered up and down the endless stairs looking for him, till, had they not wanted to make themselves a name, they would have beaten a retreat. He also wandered about looking for them, and at last they met. The leader of the party, restraining his emotion, lifted his hat, and said, [...] "Mr. Thomson, I presume?" [...] <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> found Thomson.|$|E
6000|$|... "Because I cannot {{speak the}} {{language}} of the Spaniards; and it was necessary, for my safety, for them to believe that I am one of themselves, rescued from some Spanish ship cast, by a gale, on their shores when I was a little lad. Had I gone to Cortez direct, he would probably have guessed, from my dress and from my speaking the language, that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> came to <b>be</b> here; but had I not seen Malinche before I saw him, she would have recognized me, and would no doubt have told Cortez that she had known me from the time I was cast ashore, near Tabasco, somewhat over two years ago. He would then have known that I could not be a Spaniard, for if so, I could not in so short a time have lost my own language." ...|$|R

I have {{arranged}} with Mrs. Peach that, as soon as we soldiers have entered the town and been dismissed, I'll meet her there. It is really to say good-bye, but she don't know that; and I wanted it to look like a lopement to Margery's eyes. When I'm clear of Mrs. Peach I'll come back here and make it up with Margery on the spot. But don't say I'm coming, or she may be inclined to throw off again. Just hint to her that I may be meaning to be off to London with the widow.' ...|$|E
60|$|Other {{people may}} see {{this country in}} other terms; <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> have seen it. In some early chapter in this heap I {{compared}} all our present colour and abundance to October foliage before the frosts nip down the leaves. That I still feel was a good image. Perhaps I see wrongly. It may be I see decay all about me because I am, in a sense, decay. To others {{it may be a}} scene of achievement and construction radiant with hope. I, too, have a sort of hope, but it is a remote hope, a hope that finds no promise in this Empire or in any of the great things of our time.|$|E
6000|$|... 'We {{are almost}} there,' he answered. 'And now, Margery,' {{he said in}} a lower tone, 'I must tell you a secret. I have {{obtained}} this invitation in a peculiar way. I thought it best for your sake not to come in my own name, and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> have managed. A man in this county, for whom I have lately done a service, one whom I can trust, and who is personally as unknown here as you and I, has (privately) transferred his card of invitation to me. So that we go under his name. I explain this that you may not say anything imprudent by accident. Keep your ears open and be cautious.' Having said this the Baron retreated again to his place.|$|E
5000|$|In any case, in the Netherlands (see below) {{and many}} Hanseatic {{cities such as}} Hamburg, patricians scoffed {{at the notion of}} ennoblement. Indeed, Johann Christian Senckenberg, the famous naturalist, commented, [...] "An honest man is worth more than all the nobility and all the Barons. If anyone were to make me a Baron, I would call him a canine organ or equally well a Baron. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> much <b>I</b> care for any title." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "But you mistake me," [...] pleaded Clym. [...] "All {{this was}} very {{depressing}}. But not so depressing as something I next perceived--that my business was the idlest, vainest, most effeminate business that ever a man could be put to. That decided me: I would give it up and try to follow some rational occupation among the people I knew best, and to whom I could be of most use. I have come home; and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> mean to carry out my plan. I shall keep a school as near to Egdon as possible, {{so as to be}} able to walk over here and have a night-school in my mother's house. But I must study a little at first, to get properly qualified. Now, neighbours, I must go." ...|$|E
6000|$|But I {{did not go}} direct to the Star and Garter. No, I {{lacked the}} courage to say to John Paul: [...] "You have trusted me, and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> have rewarded your faith." [...] And the thought that Dorothy's father, of all men, had served me thus, after what I had gone through, filled me with a {{bitterness}} I had never before conceived. And when my brain became clearer I reflected that Mr. Manners had had ample time to learn of my disappearance from Maryland, and that his action {{had been one of}} design, and of cold blood. But I gave to Dorothy or her mother no part in it. Mr. Manners never had had cause to hate me, and the only reason I could assign was connected with his Grace of Chartersea, which I dismissed as absurd.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{have thought}} of that,' said Ethelberta, 'and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> shall manage. In the first place, if mother is there, the lodgings can be let in her name, all bills will be receipted by her, and all tradesmen's orders will be given as from herself. Then, we will take no English lodgers at all; we will {{advertise}} the rooms only in Continental newspapers, as suitable for a French or German gentleman or two, and by this means there will be little danger of my acquaintance discovering that my house is not entirely a private one, or of any lodger being {{a friend of my}} acquaintance. I have thought over every possible way of combining the dignified social position I must maintain to make my story- telling attractive, with my absolute lack of money, and I can see no better one.' ...|$|E
