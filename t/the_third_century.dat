5|$|The Roman Empire {{reached its}} {{greatest}} territorial extent {{during the second}} century AD; the following two centuries witnessed the slow decline of Roman control over its outlying territories. Economic issues, including inflation, and external pressure on the frontiers combined to create the Crisis of <b>the</b> <b>Third</b> <b>Century,</b> with emperors coming to the throne only to be rapidly replaced by new usurpers. Military expenses increased steadily during <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>century,</b> mainly {{in response to the}} war with the Sasanian Empire, which revived in the middle of <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>century.</b> The army doubled in size, and cavalry and smaller units replaced the Roman legion as the main tactical unit. The need for revenue led to increased taxes and a decline in numbers of the curial, or landowning, class, and decreasing numbers of them willing to shoulder the burdens of holding office in their native towns. More bureaucrats were needed in the central administration to deal with the needs of the army, which led to complaints from civilians that there were more tax-collectors in the empire than tax-payers.|$|E

5|$|Eshmun was {{identified}} with Asclepius {{as a result}} of the Hellenic influence over Phoenicia; the earliest evidence of this equation is given by coins from Amrit and Acre from <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>century</b> BC.

5|$|Great feats {{were made}} during <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>century</b> {{in both the}} {{digestive}} and reproductive systems.

5|$|Literacy {{began to}} decline, perhaps dramatically, during the socio-political Crisis of <b>the</b> <b>Third</b> <b>Century.</b> Although the Church Fathers were well-educated, they {{regarded}} Classical literature as dangerous, if valuable, and reconstrued it through moralizing and allegorical readings. Julian, the only emperor after {{the conversion of}} Constantine to reject Christianity, banned Christians from teaching the Classical curriculum, {{on the grounds that}} they might corrupt the minds of youth.|$|E

5|$|The Funerary Temple no.86 (also {{known as}} the House Tomb) {{is located at the}} western end of the Great Colonnade.

5|$|A Roman {{colonnade}} {{was built}} in <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>century,</b> probably by emperor Septimius Severus, and a Roman Villa showed a period of renewed relative importance for the city during the late period of Phoenicia under Roman rule.

Worn statuettes of three nymphs stand in the niches of a Roman fountain.|$|E

5|$|Before AD 273, Palmyra enjoyed {{autonomy}} and {{was attached to}} the Roman province of Syria, having its political organization influenced by the Greek city-state model during the first two centuries AD. The city became a Roman colonia during <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>century,</b> leading to the incorporation of Roman governing institutions, before becoming a monarchy in 260. Following its destruction in 273, Palmyra became a minor center under the Byzantines and later empires. Its destruction by the Timurids in 1400 reduced it to a small village. Under French Mandatory rule in 1932, the inhabitants were moved into the new village of Tadmur, and the ancient site became available for excavations.|$|E
5|$|By <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>century</b> AD, Palmyra was {{a prosperous}} {{regional}} center reaching {{the apex of}} its power in the 260s, when Palmyrene King Odaenathus defeated Persian Emperor Shapur I. The king was succeeded by regent Queen Zenobia, who rebelled against Rome and established the Palmyrene Empire. In 273, Roman emperor Aurelian destroyed the city, which was later restored by Diocletian at a reduced size. The Palmyrenes converted to Christianity during the fourth century and to Islam in the centuries following the conquest by the Rashidun Caliphate, after which the Palmyrene and Greek languages were replaced by Arabic.|$|E
5|$|Caesar {{defeated}} large armies {{at major}} battles 58 and 57 BC. In 55 and 54 BC he made two expeditions into Britain, the first Roman to do so.

5|$|Constantine was {{the first}} Roman emperor to convert to Christianity, and he played an {{influential}} role in the proclamation of the Edict of Milan in 313, which declared religious tolerance for Christianity in the Roman empire. He called the First Council of Nicaea in 325, at which the Nicene Creed was adopted by Christians. In military matters, the Roman army was reorganised to consist of mobile field units and garrison soldiers capable of countering internal threats and barbarian invasions. Constantine pursued successful campaigns against the tribes on the Roman frontiers—the Franks, the Alamanni, the Goths, and the Sarmatians—even resettling territories abandoned by his predecessors during the Crisis of <b>the</b> <b>Third</b> <b>Century.</b>|$|E
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>century</b> BCE, {{the islands}} formed {{part of the}} Maurya Empire, during its {{expansion}} in the south, ruled by the Buddhist emperor Ashoka of Magadha. The Kanheri Caves in Borivali were excavated in the mid-third century BCE, and served as an important centre of Buddhism in Western India during ancient Times. The city then was known as Heptanesia (Ancient Greek: A Cluster of Seven Islands) to the Greek geographer Ptolemy in 150CE. The Mahakali Caves in Andheri were built between the 1st century BCE and the 6th century CE.|$|E
5|$|Palmyra's {{society was}} {{a mixture of}} the {{different}} peoples inhabiting the city, which is seen in Aramaic, Arabic and Amorite clan names. Palmyra was a tribal community but {{due to the lack of}} sources, an understanding of the nature of Palmyrene tribal structure is not possible. Thirty clans have been documented; five of which were identified as tribes (Phyle (φυλή)) comprising several sub-clans. By the time of Nero Palmyra had four tribes, each residing in an area of the city bearing its name. Three of the tribes were the Komare, Mattabol and Ma'zin; the fourth tribe is uncertain, but was probably the Mita. In time, the four tribes became highly civic and tribal lines blurred; by the second century clan identity lost its importance, and it disappeared during <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>century.</b> Even the four tribes ceased to be important by <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>century</b> as only one inscription mentions a tribe after the year 212; instead, aristocrats played the decisive role in the city's social organization. During the Umayyad period Palmyra was mainly inhabited by the Kalb tribe. Benjamin of Tudela recorded the existence of 2,000 Jews in the city during the twelfth century. Palmyra declined after its destruction by Timur in 1400, and was a village of 6,000 inhabitants at the beginning of the 20th century; although surrounded by Bedouin, the villagers preserved their dialect. Palmyra maintained the life of a small settlement until its relocation in 1932.|$|E
