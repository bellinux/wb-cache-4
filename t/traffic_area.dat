5|$|The parish formed {{part of the}} London <b>Traffic</b> <b>Area</b> from 1924 and the London Passenger Transport Area from 1933. To {{reflect the}} {{significantly}} increased population in the area, Romford Rural District was abolished in 1934 and Cranham was amalgamated with neighbouring parishes into Hornchurch Urban District. The parish council was abolished and Hornchurch Urban District Council became the local authority. There was a revision of boundaries with North Ockendon, which {{had been part of}} Orsett Rural District, absorbed into Cranham and a small area to the north, near Great Warley, transferred to Brentwood Urban District.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1920s, with vehicle numbers depleted by wartime service in France and Belgium, the Underground Group's bus operations began to experience a surge in competition from a large number of new independent bus operators. These small operators were unregulated and preyed on the group's most profitable routes taking away a large number of its passengers and a large amount of its income. Albert Stanley (ennobled as Lord Ashfield in 1920) and Pick fought back by calling on parliament to regulate bus operations in the capital. The London Traffic Act 1924 granted their request by establishing the London <b>Traffic</b> <b>Area</b> to regulate road passenger traffic within London and the surrounding districts. Throughout the 1920s, Pick led the Underground Group's efforts to coordinate its services with the municipal tram operators, the Metropolitan Railway and the suburban mainline rail services. The aim was to achieve a pooling of income between all of the operators and remove wasteful competition. At the end of 1930, a solution was announced in a bill for the formation of the London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB), a public corporation which was {{to take control of the}} Underground Group, the Metropolitan Railway and the majority of the bus and tram operators within an area designated as the London Passenger Transport Area covering the County of London and Middlesex and parts of Buckinghamshire, Essex, Hertfordshire, Kent, Surrey and Sussex.|$|E
500|$|The Local Government Act 1894 {{reformed}} {{local government}} {{and created the}} Romford Urban District and Romford Rural District to replace the local board and sanitary district; [...] following which the Romford parish was split into Romford Urban and Romford Rural {{along the lines of}} the urban district. In 1900 the parish was recombined and the urban district expanded to cover all of the former area of the historic chapelry, except for Noak Hill which remained in the rural district and had become a parish in its own right in 1895. The enlarged urban district formed part of the London <b>Traffic</b> <b>Area</b> from 1924 and the London Passenger Transport Area from 1933. The suburban expansion of London caused an increase in population during the 1930s and the urban district was expanded further in 1934, taking in the parishes of Havering-atte-Bower and Noak Hill. It was incorporated as the Municipal Borough of Romford in 1937. In 1965 the municipal borough was abolished and its former area was combined with that of Hornchurch Urban District; it was again removed from Essex and since then has formed the northern part of the London Borough of Havering in Greater London.|$|E

The parish was divided into North and South wards by the Hornchurch to Cranham road. In 1836 the vestry lost control of poor relief, with Upminster {{becoming part of the}} Romford Poor Law Union and in 1875 the parish became part of Romford rural sanitary district. Following the Local Government Act 1894, the sanitary district became Romford Rural District and a parish council was formed of nine members, increasing to twelve by 1913 as the population had doubled. The parish council acquired the Clock House building on St Mary's Lane for use as offices in 1924. The parish formed part of the London <b>Traffic</b> <b>Area</b> from 1924 and the London Passenger Transport Area from 1933. In 1934 the parish council was abolished and Upminster was combined with other parishes to form part of Hornchurch Urban District.

The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze gaseous organic {{chemicals}} (GOCs) of high traffic (Nishinomiya City: 979, 987 vehicles/day) and low <b>traffic</b> <b>areas</b> (Miki City: 29, 338 ve-hicles/day) by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and to evaluate general envi-ronment exposure by PAHs in GOCs. After air sampling using an OMNIPORE membrane filter (< 0. 45 µm) and Porapak-QS, sorbents were extracted with solvent (dichloromethane: ace-tone (4 : 1 v/v), and analysis was carried out by GC-MS. Oxidative derivatives of diethylbenzene, such as diacethylbenzene and ethylacetophenone, were detected in GOCs. PAHs and phtha-lates in GOCs were measured. Pyrene, benz[a]anthracene, benzo[a]pyrene and benzo[ghi]perylene level were significantly higher in high <b>traffic</b> <b>areas.</b> The geometric mean of pyrene was 0. 76 ng/m 3 for low traff ic areas and 1. 96 ng/m 3 for high traff ic areas; benz[a]anthracene was found at 0. 72 ng/m 3 and 1. 80 ng/m 3 in low and high <b>traffic</b> <b>areas,</b> respectively; benzo[a]pyrene was found at 0. 87 ng/m 3 and 3. 60 ng/m 3 in low and high <b>traffic</b> <b>areas,</b> respectively and benzo[ghi]perylene was found at 0. 57 ng/m 3 and 3. 04 ng/m 3 in low and high <b>traffic</b> <b>areas,</b> respectively.
