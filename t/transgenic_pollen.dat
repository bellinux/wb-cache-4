40|$|Abstract We {{present the}} first {{evidence}} that transgenic Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) corn pollen naturally deposit-ed on Asclepias syriaca; common milkweed, in a corn field causes significant mortality of Danaus plexippus L. (Lepidoptera: Danaidae) larvae. Larvae feeding for 48 h on A. syriaca plants naturally dusted with pollen from Bt corn plants suffered significantly higher rates of mortal-ity at 48 h (20 ± 3 %) compared to larvae feeding on leaves with no pollen (3 ± 3 %), or feeding on leaves with non-Bt pollen (0 %). Mortality at 120 h of D. plexippus larvae exposed to 135 pollen grains/cm 2 of <b>transgenic</b> <b>pollen</b> for 48 h ranged from 37 to 70 %. We found no sub-lethal effects on D. plexippus adults reared from lar-vae that survived a 48 -h exposure to three concentrations of Bt pollen. Based on our quantification of the wind dis-persal of this pollen beyond the edges of agricultural fields, we predict {{that the effects of}} <b>transgenic</b> <b>pollen</b> on D. plexippus may be observed at least 10 m from trans-genic field borders. However, the highest larval mortality will likely occur on A. syriaca plants in corn fields or within 3 m of the edge of a transgenic corn field. We conclude that the ecological effects of transgenic insec-ticidal crops need to be evaluated more fully before they are planted over extensive areas.

40|$|Type 1 {{allergic}} reactions, such as {{hay fever}} and allergic asthma, triggered by grass pollen allergens are a {{global health problem}} that affects ≈ 20 % {{of the population in}} cool, temperate climates. Ryegrass is the dominant source of allergens because of its prodigious production of airborne pollen. Lol p 5 is the major allergenic protein of ryegrass pollen, judging from the fact that almost all of the individuals allergic to grass pollen show presence of serum IgE antibodies against this protein. Moreover, nearly two-thirds of the IgE reactivity of ryegrass pollen has been attributed to this protein. Therefore, it can be expected that down-regulation of Lol p 5 production can significantly reduce the allergic potential of ryegrass pollen. Here, we report down-regulation of Lol p 5 with an antisense construct targeted to the Lol p 5 gene in ryegrass. The expression of antisense RNA was regulated by a pollen-specific promoter. Immunoblot analysis of proteins with allergen-specific antibodies did not detect Lol p 5 in the <b>transgenic</b> <b>pollen.</b> The <b>transgenic</b> <b>pollen</b> showed remarkably reduced allergenicity as reflected by low IgE-binding capacity of pollen extract as compared with that of control pollen.

In order to determine if there is pollen dispersal from transgenic to nontransgenic soybean plants, a field release experiment was conducted in the Cerrado region of Brazil. Nontransgenic plants were cultivated in plots surrounding Roundup Ready transgenic plants carrying the cp 4 epsps gene, which confers herbicide tolerance against glyphosate herbicide, and pollen dispersal was evaluated by checking for the dominant gene. The percentage of cross-pollination was calculated as a fraction of herbicide-tolerant and-nontolerant plants.

30|$|The {{results of}} this {{investigation}} demonstrated an entry of Bt-maize pollen into the FFH Ruhlsdorfer Bruch under the cultivation and weather conditions for both years 2007 and 2008. At each of the sampling sites transgenic Bt-maize pollen MON 810 was detected by technical aerosol sampling and DNA-analysis. The collection of pollen pellets by honey-bees confirmed that the foraging ranges of the bees are extensive and not restricted to the FFH-area. Pollen from technical {{as well as from}} biological samplers showed comparable high proportions of <b>transgenic</b> <b>pollen</b> in 2007. Hence, an isolation distance of 100  m between Bt-maize fields and conservation areas was obviously too small to prevent butterflies and other NTOs from exposure and related adverse effects of Bt-maize cultivation in the Ruhlsdorfer Bruch. In 2008, when the buffer zone was increased to 250  m in the north-eastern and to 500  m in the north-western part, the percentage of Bt-maize pollen in the bee pellets and in the bioaerosol samples was reduced.|$|E

Additional information (e.g. data on wind conditions or soil observation sites) provided by the WebGIS will be helpful to determine representative monitoring sites for detecting potential GMO impacts by means of monitoring or modelling. Thus, the WebGIS can also serve as part of an early warning system. In the near future, the integration of locations of all Bt-maize fields in Germany into the WebGIS as a continuous task should be automatised. Additionally, a methodology should be developed to detect maize fields by means of remote sensing data to manage coexistence problems on the basis of actual field patterns.|$|E

On the basis of microscopic and histochemical studies, using X-glc (5 -Bromo- 4 -chloro- 3 -indolyl-�-D-glycopyranoside) as substrate, �-glucosidase activity was found in half the <b>pollen</b> of the <b>transgenic</b> tobacco plants. Detection of the �-glucosidase (Zm-p 60. 1) was achieved using �-glucosidase histochemical and biochemical assays. The activities of selected enzymes of sucrose metabolism (UDPGpyrophosphorylase) and starch metabolism (ADPG-pyrophosphorylase, starch-phosphorylase, and amylase) were biochemically analyzed. Histochemical studies with potassium iodide revealed that 50 % of the pollen of the positive plants (i. e. tobacco plants expressing �-glucosidase activity) exhibited normal starch accumulation.

40|$|Abstract Genetically {{engineered}} pollen with {{a visible}} marker gene {{could be useful}} to monitor the movement of <b>transgenic</b> <b>pollen</b> provided there are no negative physi-ological or fitness effects of expressing such a gene. In this study, we measured the fitness of Nicotiana tabacum cv. Xanthi pollen expressing the marker gene green fluorescent protein (GFP). Average pollen tube germina-tion frequencies and pollen tube growth rates in vitro were measured in three different types of plants: (1) plants producing GFP in pollen cells only (LAT 59 -GFP), (2) plants synthesizing GFP {{under the control of}} a constitutive promoter (CaMV 35 S) in which no GFP was produced in pollen, and (3) non-transgenic plants. Pollen synthesizing the GFP protein did not differ significantly in average pollen germination frequencies from pollen without GFP (P= 0. 65). Average pollen tube growth rates over a 5 -h period did not differ significantly between transgenic and non-transgenic types (R 2 = 0. 89, 0. 98, and 0. 95, respectively, for GFP-tagged, 35 S-GFP, and wild type). Overall, GFP expression in pollen grains of tobacco was not found to have an effect on pollen fitness under the controlled experimental conditions of this study...|$|E
40|$|Polarized {{growth in}} pollen tubes results from {{exocytosis}} {{at the tip}} and is associated with conspicuous polarization of Ca 2 +, H+, K+, and Cl− -fluxes. Here, we show that cell polarity in Nicotiana tabacum pollen {{is associated with the}} exclusion of a novel pollen-specific H+-ATPase, Nt AHA, from the growing apex. Nt AHA colocalizes with extracellular H+ effluxes, which revert to influxes where Nt AHA is absent. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis showed that Nt AHA moves toward the apex of growing pollen tubes, suggesting that the major mechanism of insertion is not through apical exocytosis. Nt AHA mRNA is also excluded from the tip, suggesting a mechanism of polarization acting at the level of translation. Localized applications of the cation ionophore gramicidin A had no effect where Nt AHA was present but acidified the cytosol and induced reorientation of the pollen tube where Nt AHA was absent. <b>Transgenic</b> <b>pollen</b> overexpressing Nt AHA-GFP developed abnormal callose plugs accompanied by abnormal H+ flux profiles. Furthermore, there is no net flux of H+ in defined patches of membrane where callose plugs are to be formed. Taken together, our results suggest that proton dynamics may underlie basic mechanisms of polarity and spatial regulation in growing pollen tubes...|$|E
40|$|Brassica campestris Male Fertility 2 (BcMF 2) is a {{putative}} polygalacturonase (PG) gene previously {{isolated from}} the flower bud of Chinese cabbage (Brassica campestris L. ssp. chinensis Makino, syn. B. rapa ssp. chinensis). This gene {{was found to be}} expressed specifically in tapetum and pollen after the tetrad stage of anther development. Antisense RNA technology was used to study the function of BcMF 2 in Chinese cabbage. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy revealed that there were deformities in the transgenic mature pollen grains such as abnormal location of germinal furrows. In addition, the homogeneous pectic exintine layer facing the exterior seemed to be overdeveloped and predominantly occupied the intine, thus reversing the normal proportional distribution of the internal endintine layer and the external exintine layer. Since it is a continuation of the intine layer, the pollen tube wall could not grow normally. This resulted in the formation of a balloon-like swelling structure in the pollen tube tip in nearly 80 % of the <b>transgenic</b> <b>pollen</b> grains. Premature degradation of tapetum was also found in these transgenic plants, which displayed decreased expression of the BcMF 2 gene. BcMF 2 might therefore encode a new PG with an important role in pollen wall development, possibly via regulation of pectin's dynamic metabolism...|$|E
40|$|Self-incompatibility (SI) is an {{important}} genetic mechanism that angiosperms utilize to reject "self' pollen. In Papaver rhoeas (poppy) Sl is controlled in an allele-specific manner by a single locus with multiple haplotypes; each haplotype encodes male (PrpS) and female (PrsS) S-determinants. PrsS-PrpS interaction triggers Sl, stimulating cation channel activity and increases in cytosolic free Ca 2 + ([Ca 2 +]i), triggering a signalling network involving actin cytoskeleton alterations and programmed cell death (PCD). PrpS was recently functionally transferred into self-compatible, highly diverged Arabidopsis thaliana. <b>Transgenic</b> Arabidopsis <b>pollen</b> expressing PrpS-GFP was shown to undergo a "Papaver-SI-Iike response", involving actin and PCD when challenged by recombinant PrsS. Here we investigated function of PrpS in several other heterologous model systems, including Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts, yeast, barley and mammalian HeLa cells. Although more work is needed {{on some of these}} systems, data were obtained suggesting that PrpS is functional in mammalian HeLa cells. A key finding was that HeLa cells expressing PrpS, when exposed to cognate PrsS, exhibited transient increases in [Ca 2 +]i and inward cation currents; actin reorganization and decrease in cell adherence. These data suggest that: PrsS-PrpS interaction can recruit endogenous components in HeLa cells to achieve a biological response...|$|R

However, their roles in pollen tube polar growth remain elusive. Here, a TUA 1 gene from Picea wilsonii, which is specifically expressed in pollen, was isolated. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed {{that the amount of}} PwTUA 1 transcript varied at each stage of growth of the pollen tube and was induced by calcium ions and boron. Transient expression analysis in P. wilsonii pollen indicated that PwTUA 1 improved pollen germination and pollen tube growth. The <b>pollen</b> of <b>transgenic</b> Arabidopsis overexpressing PwTUA 1 also showed a higher percentage of germination and faster growth than wild-type plants not only in optimal germination medium, but also in medium supplemented with elevated levels of exogenous calcium ions or boron. Immunofluorescence and electron microscopy showed α-tubulin to be enriched and more vesicles accumulated in the apex region in germinating <b>transgenic</b> Arabidopsis <b>pollen</b> compared with wild-type plants. These results demonstrate that PwTUA 1 up-regulated by calcium ions and boron contributes to pollen tube elongation by altering the distribution of α-tubulin and regulating the deposition of pollen cell wall components during the process of tube growth.

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{assessment of risk}} to natural enemies from Bt-endotoxins from bioengineered crops must evaluate potential harm, as well as exposure pathways in non-target arthropod food webs. Despite being abundant generalist predators in agricultural fields, spiders (Araneae) have often been overlooked {{in the context of}} Bt crop risk assessment. Spiders and their prey were collected from transgenic corn fields expressing lepidopteran-specific Cry 1 Ab, coleopteran-specific Cry 3 Bb 1, both proteins, and a non-transgenic near isoline. Spiders and prey were screened for Cry 1 Ab and Cry 3 Bb 1 using qualitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Spiders from the three most common functional guilds, wandering sheet-tangle weavers, orb-weavers, and ground runners, tested positive for Cry 1 Ab and Cry 3 Bb 1 proteins, with the highest per cent positive (8. 0 % and 8. 3 %) during and after anthesis. Laboratory feeding trials revealed that Bt-endotoxins were detectable in the Pardosa sp.

Additionally, direct consumption of <b>transgenic</b> corn <b>pollen</b> by Pardosa sp., T. formica, and Cyclosa turbinata (Araneidae) resulted in transfer of both Cry 1 Ab and Cry 3 Bb 1 endotoxins.

40|$|Plant-made {{pharmaceuticals}} (PMPs) offer {{promise as}} efficient and cost-effective {{products for the}} treatment of human and animal diseases. An advantage of producing pharmaceuticals in maize is the large storage capacity and stability for proteins and starch in seed, allowing for manufacturing recombinant proteins such as antigens and antibodies. Other advantages of the maize system include safety, high yields, and scalability of production and processing. However, the benefits of this technology must be balanced against potential health and environmental risks that may be associated with its use. Because PMPs presently have no provision for regulatory tolerance, their inadvertent occurrence in foods and feeds remains an important economic consideration, even when the health and environmental risks are low. Pollen drift is considered a source of potential contamination of maizemade pharmaceuticals in the food chain. In addition to physical and temporal isolation requirements, open field pharmaceutical maize production also calls for controlled pollen release.

40|$|Concerns about {{controlling}} {{pollen flow}} in maize (Zea mays L.) have greatly increased since {{the introduction of}} transgenes for insect resistance, herbicide resistance, and production of pharmaceutical and industrial compounds. The primary concern is related to out-crossing with non-transgenic genotypes destined for food uses or organic production. Pollen control is necessary to prevent the introduction of transgenes into sexually compatible crops or wild relatives in locations where these are grown or occur naturally (e. g., Native maize genotypes in Mexico).;The central hypothesis of this dissertation is that out-crossing resulting from pollen flow in maize is a predictable process, which can be simulated and quantified. The thesis is organized into three chapters. Chapter 2 describes a field study to test how a natural vegetative wind barrier {{might be used to}} limit pollen dispersal. In 10 independent tests, diminishing wind speed across the maize canopy resulted in a smaller pattern of pollen dispersal in the surrounding field. Chapter 3 presents the first attempt to predict out-crossing in a commercial hybrid seed production field. The analysis demonstrates that out-crossing can be predicted accurately based on inbred flowering dynamics and estimates of pollen dispersal. The field study presented in Chapter 4 tests the potential for predicting the spatial pattern of out-crossing from a <b>transgenic</b> <b>pollen</b> source.

The effects of Cry 1 Ie-producing <b>transgenic</b> maize <b>pollen</b> on the fitness of P. japonica {{was assessed using}} two dietary-exposure experiments in the laboratory. In the first experiment, survival, larval developmental time, adult fresh weight, and fecundity did not differ between ladybirds consuming Bt or non-Bt maize pollen.

In contrast, the larval developmental time, adult fresh weight, and fecundity of P. japonica were significantly adversely affected when fed diet containing the positive control compound E- 64. In both experiments, the bioactivity of the Cry 1 Ie protein in the food sources was confirmed by bioassays with a Cry 1 Ie-sensitive lepidopteran species.

Toxins tested included Cry 1 Ab, Cry 1 Ac, Cry 9 C, and Cry 1 F. Three methods were used: (i) purified toxins incorporated into artificial diet, (ii) pollen collected from Bt corn hybrids applied directly to milkweed leaf discs, and (iii) Bt pollen contaminated with corn tassel material applied directly to milkweed leaf discs. Bioassays of purified Bt toxins indicate that Cry 9 C and Cry 1 F proteins are relatively nontoxic to monarch first instars, whereas first instars are sensitive to Cry 1 Ab and Cry 1 Ac proteins. Older instars were 12 to 23 times less susceptible to Cry 1 Ab toxin compared with first instars. Pollen bioassays suggest that pollen contaminants, an artifact of pollen processing, can dramatically influence larval survival and weight gains and produce spurious results. The only <b>transgenic</b> corn <b>pollen</b> that consistently affected monarch larvae was from Cry 1 Ab event 176 hybrids, currently < 2 % corn planted and for which re-registration has not been applied.

40|$|Plants genetically {{modified}} (GM) for insect resistance (IR) {{have to be}} tested and compared to their non-GM counterparts with respect to several aspects. This thesis summarizes the effects of three transgenic lines of oilseed rape (Brassica napus) expressing pea (Pisum sativum) seed lectin (PSL) in the pollen on a target pest: the pollen beetle (Meligethes aeneus), and a non-target insect: the honey bee (Apis mellifera). The competitive ability of the transgenic plants was tested to evaluate potential invasive characters. Finally, attitudes towards GM crops among Swedish farmers were surveyed. Pollen beetle adults and larvae were exposed to three PSL expressing plant lines and two control lines without any PSL. Fourteen life history parameters were studied and significant differences between transgenes and controls were found for egg size and larval mortality. This means that the modification does not prevent direct damage to the attacked crop but the effects could, together with the action of natural enemies, lead to a reduced pollen beetle population. The sensitivity of honey bee larvae to PSL containing pollen was tested by feeding them diets {{with high levels of}} <b>transgenic</b> or control <b>pollen.</b> The addition of pollen had a positive effect on developmental time and larval weight but no differences were detected between <b>transgenic</b> and non-transgenic <b>pollen.</b> Competitive ability was tested by growing transgenic plants either in monoculture or mixed with control plants, with or without pollen beetles, and with or without pollinators (bumblebees). Plant characters related to plant fitness were measured but transgenic plants did not benefit from the transformation regarding pest damage. However, yield was higher on transgenic plants when grown mixed with control plants than when grown in monoculture, and the opposite was true for control plants. A majority of the surveyed farmers were negative to GM crops and considered consumers' unwillingness to buy GM products as the largest drawback, while higher yield was considered the largest potential benefit from growing such crops...|$|R

It seems, therefore, imperative to develop alternative approaches to genetic engineering that make it possible to genetically modify crops while addressing most of the controversial issues associated with the original GE alfalfa crop.

30|$|The {{results of}} 2007 show that on average 49  % of the maize pollen {{collected}} by honey-bees at sampling site I originated from Bt-maize fields. This corresponds quite {{well with the}} percentage (31  %) of <b>transgenic</b> maize <b>pollen</b> found in atmospheric samples collected by the PMF devices at this location. The highest concentrations were not found at the samplers close to the field margin (5  m: 9  %), but at samplers farther away (26  m: 40  %; 120  m: 44  %). This was because the sampling location was adjacent to a conventional maize field but the next Bt-maize fields were located further away and in another direction (see Fig. 1). At site II, 11  % of the maize pollen in honey-bee pellets and 12  % of the maize pollen in the PMF samples originated from Bt-maize MON 810. At this site, maize pollen samples collected near the field margin (20  m) showed a percentage of 7  % Bt-maize, with a value of 16  % {{at a distance of}} 60  m. The highest amount of maize pollen in the pellet samples was found at sampling site III. By contrast, the percentage of Bt-maize pollen was quite low (3  %) reflecting that the bees here collected more maize pollen in the surrounding conventional fields. The results of qPCR-analysis of the two subsamples (a, b) of the pollen pellets showed quite similar proportions for all three sites.|$|R
40|$|Mexico, {{the center}} of origin of maize (Zea mays L.), has taken actions to {{preserve}} the identity and diversity of maize landraces and wild relatives. Historically, spatial isolation {{has been used in}} seed production to maintain seed purity. Spatial isolation can also be a key component for a strategy to minimize pollen-mediated gene flow in Mexico between transgenic maize and sexually compatible plants of maize conventional hybrids, landraces, and wild relatives. The objective of this research was to generate field maize-to-maize outcrossing data to help guide coexistence discussions in Mexico. In this study, outcrossing rates were determined and modeled from eight locations in six northern states, which represent the most economically important areas for the cultivation of hybrid maize in Mexico. At each site, pollen source plots were planted with a yellow-kernel maize hybrid and surrounded by plots with a white-kernel conventional maize hybrid (pollen recipient) of the same maturity. Outcrossing rates were then quantified by assessing the number of yellow kernels harvested from white-kernel hybrid plots. The highest outcrossing values were observed near the pollen source (12. 9 % at 1 m distance). The outcrossing levels declined sharply to 4. 6, 2. 7, 1. 4, 1. 0, 0. 9, 0. 5, and 0. 5 % as the distance from the pollen source increased to 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 25 m, respectively. At distances beyond 20 m outcrossing values at all locations were below 1 %. These trends are consistent with studies conducted in other world regions. The results suggest that coexistence measures that have been implemented in other geographies, such as spatial isolation, would be successful in Mexico to minimize <b>transgenic</b> maize <b>pollen</b> flow to conventional maize hybrids, landraces and wild relatives...|$|R
40|$|State of the Art: This project {{intends to}} {{evaluate}} and test a monitoring system for the general surveillance of GMPs in Switzerland based on pollen-sampling (Bees, technical pollen sampler) {{in order to assess}} the current situation and its evolution. Comparable studies were conducted in Germany by the Federal Agency for Nature Conservation (Hofmann et al. 2005 : www. bfn. de/ 08 / 0802. htm) and in Austria by the Federal Ministry for Health and Women (Dolezel et al. 2003 : www. bmgf. gv. at/cms/site/bestelliste. htm?channel=CH 0295) Definition of the problem: Until now Switzerland is considered to be “GMP-free” to date. Nevertheless, GMP may already exist in the environment, since several sources for entry exist: Pollen entering from neighbouring countries, GMP contaminated seeds and animal feed, transport of GMP seeds through Switzerland, release from contained systems. Project aims including target group: The project intends to develop and test a monitoring system for the appearance and dissemination of GMPs within Switzerland. Methodology: DNA array technology and TaqMan PCR assays with known limits of detection will be developed for a fast and reliable detection of <b>transgenic</b> DNA in <b>pollen</b> mixtures by the KLBS.

30|$|The {{results of}} the qPCR-analyses of the {{monitoring}} in 2008 for site I showed {{a decrease in the}} percentages of <b>transgenic</b> <b>pollen</b> for both biological and technical sampling. The percentage of Bt-maize MON 810 pollen in the pellet samples declined from 49  % in 2007 to 1.9  % in 2008. The values for both samples at site I were pretty close (1.2  %, 2.5  %). A similar result was observed in the bioaerosol samples. The percentage of Bt-maize pollen decreased from 31  % in 2007 to 8  % in 2008. Comparing both surveys, these findings reflect the greater distance of the samplers to the next Bt-maize field due to the increased buffer zones (100  m in 2007, > 250  m in 2008). In 2008, 12  % Bt-maize pollen was found by technical sampling at site II at a distance of 80  m to the next maize field margin, whereas in 2007 the percentage was 16  % at a distance of 60  m. At site IV the percentage of Bt-maize pollen was 18  %. Both sites (site II + IV) were situated closer to the next Bt-maize field and in a different direction to site I, possibly leading to the higher fraction of GMO pollen. The pollen sample (PMF sampler) at site III contained 34  % Bt-maize MON 810 and was located in the proximity of a Bt-maize field. At site V which bordered the nature reserve and was 500  m from a Bt-maize field, 11  % of the maize pollen was transgenic.|$|E
40|$|Background/Objective: Despite {{potential}} benefits granted by genetically modified (GM) fruit trees, their release and commercialization raises concerns about their potential environmental impact, and the transfer via pollen of transgenes to cross-compatible cultivars is {{deemed to be}} the greatest source for environmental exposure. Information compiled from field trials on GM trees is essential to propose measures to minimize the transgene dispersal. We have conducted a field trial of seven consecutive years to investigate the maximum frequency of pollen-mediated crop-to-crop transgene flow in a citrus orchard, and its relation to the genetic, phenological and environmental factors involved. Methodology/Principal Findings: Three different citrus genotypes carrying the uidA (GUS) tracer marker gene (pollen donors) and a non-GM self-incompatible contiguous citrus genotype (recipient) were used in conditions allowing natural entomophilous pollination to occur. The examination of 603 to 2990 seeds per year showed unexpectedly low frequencies (0. 17 - 2. 86 %) of transgene flow. Paternity analyses of the progeny of subsets of recipient plants using 10 microsatellite (SSR) loci demonstrated a higher mating competence of trees from another non-GM pollen source population that greatly limited the mating chance of the contiguous cross-compatible and flowering-synchronized <b>transgenic</b> <b>pollen</b> source. This mating superiority could be explained by a much higher pollen competition capacity of the non-GM genotypes, as was confirmed through mixed-hand pollinations. Conclusions/Significance: Pollen competition strongly contributed to transgene confinement. Based on this finding, suitable isolation measures are proposed {{for the first time to}} prevent transgene outflow between contiguous plantings of citrus types that may be extendible to other entomophilous transgenic fruit tree species.

40|$|Maize is {{not only}} one of the world 2 ̆ 7 s most {{important}} crops, but it is also the first field-grown plant-based recombinant expression system developed for commercial purposes. With advantages of low cost, high yield, high protein stability, and well-developed transformation technology over other plant systems, maize is considered to be an ideal recombinant production system. However, there are three major challenges limiting the use of maize for producing recombinant proteins: 1) maize lacks mammalian-like post-translational modification ability that may be required for pharmaceutical and industrial proteins; 2) <b>transgenic</b> <b>pollen</b> containment in open-field production; and 3) low expression of recombinant products. The aim {{of the present study was}} to develop strategies to safely produce recombinant proteins with high yield and adequate modification in maize seeds. Firstly, we showed that the recombinant human collagen type I alpha 1 (rCIα 1) with high ratio of hydroxylated prolines (Hyp) similar to native human collagen was expressed in maize seeds co-expressing a recombinant human prolyl 4 -hydroxylase (rP 4 H). The hydroxylated rCIα 1 had a markedly enhanced thermal stability compared to non-hydroxylated rCIα 1. Secondly, we demonstrated that a cytoplasmic male-sterile maize system could be used for open-field production of maize-derived recombinant protein to minimize contamination risk caused by pollen drift. Two strategies were presented: the transgene was directly transformed into a male-sterile line via biolistic- or Agrobacterium -mediated methods, or introgressed from male-fertile to male-sterile germplasm by conventional breeding. The male-sterile transgenic maize seed from the second strategy can be used for open-field production by using a non-transgenic maize pollen donor to produce 100...|$|E
40|$|SummaryMany {{angiosperms}} use specific {{interactions between}} pollen and pistil proteins as “self” recognition and/or rejection mechanisms to prevent self-fertilization. Self-incompatibility (SI) is encoded by a multiallelic S locus, comprising pollen and pistil S-determinants [1, 2]. In Papaver rhoeas, cognate pistil and pollen S-determinants, PrpS, a pollen-expressed transmembrane protein, and PrsS, a pistil-expressed secreted protein [3, 4], interact to trigger a Ca 2 +-dependent signaling network [5 – 10], resulting in inhibition of pollen tube growth, cytoskeletal alterations [11 – 13], and {{programmed cell death}} (PCD) [14, 15] in incompatible pollen. We introduced the PrpS gene into Arabidopsis thaliana, a self-compatible model plant. Exposing <b>transgenic</b> A.  thaliana <b>pollen</b> to recombinant Papaver PrsS protein triggered remarkably similar responses to those observed in incompatible Papaver pollen: S-specific inhibition and hallmark features of Papaver SI [11 – 15]. Our findings demonstrate that Papaver PrpS is functional in a species with no SI system that diverged ∼ 140 million years ago [16]. This suggests that the Papaver SI system uses cellular targets that are, perhaps, common to all eudicots and that endogenous signaling components can be recruited to elicit a response that most likely never operated in this species. This will {{be of interest to}} biologists interested in the evolution of signaling networks in higher plants...|$|R
