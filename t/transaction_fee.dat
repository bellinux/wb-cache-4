25|$|CS:GO is not {{the first}} video game where players have traded, sold, or bought virtual in-game items, but the ease of {{accessing}} and transferring through the Steam Marketplace made it a successful virtual economy. However, with increased monetary values placed on some skins, the Steam Marketplace became infeasible. The Steam Marketplace only allows sales up to $400, with all transactions subject to a 15% fee collected by Valve. Trades and purchases via the Steam Marketplace required players to add funds to their Steam Wallets to purchase skins from others, with those funds being placed in the Wallet of the seller; such funds could not be taken out as real-world money, as otherwise Valve would be regulated as a bank. As the value of skins grew beyond these limits, new websites opened up that used the Steamworks application programming interface (API) to link players' inventory to these sites as to manage the trading of CS:GO skins while enabling these users to spend more and receive money through other online banking/payment sites like PayPal or using digital currency like Bitcoin, and bypassing Valve's <b>transaction</b> <b>fee.</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In {{order to}} satisfy the inter-temporal {{securities}} investors, we discuss the inter-temporal securities portfolio model with adding <b>transaction</b> <b>fees</b> in this paper. Meanwhile, {{for the purpose of}} improving the practicality of the model, we take the <b>transaction</b> <b>fees,</b> the trading volume and the minimum trading unit into account in founding the model. We divide the main content of this paper into three parts. First, Obtaining the yield and variance buy least squares in a specific period of time. Then, founding the inter-temporal securities portfolio model with adding <b>transaction</b> <b>fees.</b> Finally, obtaining the integral solution of the model. The proposed of this model provide a valuable reference standard for inter-temporal securities investors.

500|$|During mid-2011, Valve {{began to}} offer free-to-play games, such as Global Agenda, Spiral Knights and Champions Online; this offer {{was linked to}} the company's move to make Team Fortress 2 a free-to-play title. Valve {{included}} support via Steamworks for microtransactions for in-game items in these titles through Steam's purchasing channels, in a similar manner to the in-game store for Team Fortress 2. Later that year, Valve added the ability to trade in-game items and [...] "unopened" [...] game gifts between users. Steam Coupons, which was introduced in December 2011, provides single-use coupons that provide a discount to the cost of items. Steam Coupons can be provided to users by developers and publishers; users can trade these coupons between friends in a similar fashion to gifts and in-game items. Steam Market, a feature introduced in beta in December 2012 that would allow users to sell virtual items to others via Steam Wallet funds, further extended the idea. Valve levies a <b>transaction</b> <b>fee</b> of 15% on such sales and game publishers that use Steam Market pay a <b>transaction</b> <b>fee.</b> For example, Team Fortress 2the first game supported at the beta phaseincurred both fees. Full support for other games was expected to be available in early 2013. In April 2013, Valve added subscription-based game support to Steam; the first game to use this service was Darkfall Unholy Wars.|$|E
500|$|The virtual {{economy of}} Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn is largely player-driven. The {{exchange}} of items is facilitated by retainers—non-playable characters who assist in selling {{items on the}} Market Board, gather items through ventures, and provide additional item storage. A small <b>transaction</b> <b>fee</b> for all sales serves as a gold sink to regulate the inflation of prices in the economy. Players of any class {{may contribute to the}} supply of the economy: Disciples of the Land acquire raw materials from gathering points throughout the game world; Disciples of the Hand craft the materials into useful items and equipment; and Disciples of War and Magic slay monsters for rare materials not available to Disciples of the Land. Players are also able to contribute by creating materia from well-used equipment. Players may sacrifice equipment that has gained enough [...] "spiritbond" [...] to generate a piece of materia, which can then be used to improve the statistics of other equipment.|$|E

40|$|Statistical Process Control (SPC) is a {{scientific}} approach to quality improvement in which data are collected {{and used as}} evidence of the performance of a process, organisation or set of equipment. One of the SPC techniques, the cumulative sum (CUSUM) method, first developed by E. S. Page (1961), uses a series of cumulative sums of sample data for online process control. This paper reviews CUSUM techniques applied to financial markets in several different ways. The performance of the CUSUM method in predicting regime shifts in stock market indices is then studied in detail. Research in this field so far does not take the <b>transaction</b> <b>fees</b> of buying and selling into consideration. As the study in this paper shows, the performances of the CUSUM when taking account of <b>transaction</b> <b>fees</b> are quite different to those not taking <b>transaction</b> <b>fees</b> into account. The CUSUM plan is defined by parameters h and k. Choosing the parameters of the method should be based on studies that take <b>transaction</b> <b>fees</b> into account. The performances of the CUSUM in different stock markets are also compared in this paper. The results show that the same CUSUM plan has remarkably different performances in different stock markets.

If Ripple were completely free to access, adversaries could broadcast large amounts of [...] "ledger spam" [...] (i.e. fake accounts) and [...] "transaction spam" [...] (i.e. fake transactions) {{in an attempt to}} overload the network. This could cause the size of the ledger to become unmanageable and interfere with the network’s ability to quickly settle legitimate transactions. Thus, to engage in trade, each Ripple account is required to have a small reserve of 20 XRP, (US$0.16 as of October 3, 2016), and a <b>transaction</b> <b>fee</b> starting at [...]00001 XRP (US$.00000008 as of October 3, 2016) must be spent for each trade.

During three weeks, participants face <b>transaction</b> <b>fees</b> of different types. Order frequency and volume is measured and related to the price schedule in place.
