Around 97% of students leaving lower secondary education enter into upper secondary education; however there is a notable drop-out rate. There are specific entry requirements for different courses, but as all {{students have}} the right <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> education, a general program of study is available for those students who may fail to meet requirements. Some schools enjoy more prestige and popularity than others, especially in Reykjavík, and those may need to turn away hundreds of students every year.|$|E

[...] Gradually, the couple's relationship became based on a cordial friendship: Marie accorded Ferdinand respect she believed he was due as a man and, later, as king, and he respected her because he realised that she had {{a better understanding of the}} world than he did. Eventually, Marie came to believe that she and Ferdinand were [...] "the best associates, the most loyal companions, but our lives intertwine only in certain matters".

His style has been described as a [...] "robust, direct approach" [...] to journalism and is known for his scathing attacks on the industry. Smith, however, felt disheartened by the state of game journalism. [...] "Video game journalism is just weird. You have guys married to women in marketing for the games they cover. Video game journalism is still very young, very early, still trying to find out what it is," [...] he said. In an interview with Michael Zenke of The Escapist, Smith said he felt game journalists were treated by developers as another part of the PR plan, with developers sending out information and the journalists [...] "regurgitating" [...] it. Worse, Smith felt that gamers had become used <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> information; [...] "We have to be responsible for our actions and held accountable when we manipulate the expectations of gamers," [...] he told Zenke.|$|E

2500|$|Determining the player's best {{strategy}} {{within a given}} set of other rules the host must follow {{is the type of}} problem studied in game theory. For example, if the host is not required to make the offer to switch the player may suspect the host is malicious and makes the offers more often if the player has initially selected the car. In general, the answer <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> question depends on the specific assumptions made about the host's behavior, and might range from [...] "ignore the host completely" [...] to [...] "toss a coin and switch if it comes up heads"; see the last row of the table below.|$|E

[...] A political commentator based in Townsville told the Sydney Morning Herald that the electoral roll had changed by about 30% since July, due {{to a lot of}} movement by public servants and the army, and that some new residents did not qualify to vote as they had arrived too late to enrol. On election day, The Age described the campaign in retrospect as a [...] "thrill-a-minute plot with spellbinding dirty tricks that have kept locals—used <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> thing—away in droves", and characterised the main candidates as [...] "the man who talks to God, the man who runs on hurt, or the ambitious Mayor".|$|E
2500|$|Many of the {{commonly}} used {{machine learning algorithms}} require a set of training examples consisting of both a hypothetical input and a desired answer. [...] In many robot learning applications the desired answer is an action for the robot to take. These actions are usually not known explicitly a priori, instead the robot can, at best, receive a value indicating {{the success or failure}} of a given action taken. [...] Evolutionary algorithms are natural solutions <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> problem framework, as the fitness function need only encode {{the success or failure of}} a given controller, rather than the precise actions the controller should have taken. [...] An alternative to the use of evolutionary computation in robot learning is the use of other forms of reinforcement learning, such as q-learning, to learn the fitness of any particular action, and then use predicted fitness values indirectly to create a controller.|$|E

2500|$|Another form {{of salmon}} production, which is safer but less controllable, {{is to raise}} salmon in {{hatcheries}} until they {{are old enough to}} become independent. They are then released into rivers, often in an attempt to increase the salmon population. This practice was very common in countries like Sweden before the Norwegians developed salmon farming, but is seldom done by private companies, as anyone may catch the salmon when they return to spawn, limiting a company's chances of benefiting financially from their investment. Because of this, the method has mainly been used by various public authorities and non profit groups like the Cook Inlet Aquaculture Association as a way of artificially increasing salmon populations in situations where they have declined due to overharvest, construction of dams, and habitat destruction or disruption. Unfortunately, there can be negative consequences <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> population manipulation, including genetic [...] "dilution" [...] of the wild stocks, and many jurisdictions are now beginning to discourage supplemental fish planting in favour of harvest controls and habitat improvement and protection. A variant method of fish stocking, called ocean ranching, is under development in Alaska. There, the young salmon are released into the ocean far from any wild salmon streams. When it is time for them to spawn, they return to where they were released where fishermen can then catch them.|$|E
2500|$|Major Hugh Maguire (of HQ, 1st Airborne Division) was put {{in charge}} of the second escape [...] The {{operation}} largely replicated the original, but was due to take place 4km further east on the evening of 18 November. [...] A party of between 130 and 160 men would attempt to cross the river on this occasion, although this number included a much higher proportion of civilians, aircrew and other non-infantry who were unused <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> operation. [...] Because of the distance from Ede to the crossing point and the need to skirt a German 'no mans zone', the main party's march to the river was approximately 23km (compared to the 5km of Pegasus I) and would take two days to make. [...] The main party became fragmented on the second night [...] and whilst attempting to make a short cut [...] one party under Major John Coke of the King's Own Scottish Borderers stumbled into a German patrol. [...] Several men were killed in the resulting firefight - perhaps more than twenty and the evaders were forced to scatter. [...] No-one was able to cross that night, although seven men crossed during the next two days. [...] The Germans searched the area intensively with patrols and spotter planes, enabling them to capture more of the evaders, and most of the Resistance's Dutch guides were killed or captured.|$|E
2500|$|Rather than {{attempt to}} define {{intentions}} in abstraction from actions, thus taking the third heading first, Anscombe {{begins with the}} concept of an intentional action. This soon connected with the second heading. She says that what is up with a human being is an intentional action if the question [...] "Why", taken in a certain sense (and evidently conceived as addressed to him), has application. An agent can answer the [...] "why" [...] question by giving a reason or purpose for her action. [...] "To do Y" [...] or [...] "because I want to do Y" [...] would be typical answers <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> [...] "why?"; though they are not the only ones, they are crucial to the constitution of the phenomenon as a typical phenomenon of human life. The agent's answer helps supply the descriptions under which the action is intentional. Anscombe was the first to clearly spell out that actions are intentional under some descriptions and not others. In her famous example, a man's action (which we might observe as consisting in moving an arm up and down while holding a handle) may be intentional under the description [...] "pumping water" [...] but not under other descriptions such as [...] "contracting these muscles", [...] "tapping out this rhythm", and so on. This approach to action influenced Donald Davidson's theory, despite the fact that Davidson went on to argue for a causal theory of action that Anscombe never accepted ...|$|E
