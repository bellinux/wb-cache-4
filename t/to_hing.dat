40|$|BACKGROUND: Sodium aurothiomalate {{has been}} {{reported}} to have in vitro activity against Helicobacter pylori. Intramuscular gold, as given to patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), may therefore influence the colonisation of the gastric mucosa with H pylori. METHODS: Two groups were compared. One group of 42 patients was treated with intramuscular gold; the other group of 58 patients was treated with antimalarial drugs. Antibodies <b>to</b> <b>H</b> pylori (IgA and IgG) were assessed by an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and total IgA and IgG were measured by nephelometry. RESULTS: IgA and IgG antibody titres against H pylori and total IgA and IgG levels were lower in the patients treated with gold than in the group treated with antimalarial drugs. The ratio of IgA antibodies <b>to</b> <b>H</b> pylori <b>to</b> total IgA antibodies and the ratio of IgG antibodies <b>to</b> <b>H</b> pylori <b>to</b> total IgG antibodies were lower in the group treated with gold. The percentage of seropositivity <b>to</b> <b>H</b> pylori was significantly lower in the group treated with gold than in the group treated with antimalarial drugs for the two IgA antibodies (35 and 55 % respectively) and IgG antibodies <b>to</b> <b>H</b> pylori (40 and 65 % respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Although this study cannot completely exclude the possibility that a suppressive effect of intramuscular gold on total immunoglobulin production plays a part in the decrease in the titres of IgA antibodies <b>to</b> <b>H</b> pylori and IgG antibodies <b>to</b> <b>H</b> pylori, the lower ratios of antibodies <b>to</b> <b>H</b> pylori <b>to</b> total immunoglobulin antibodies and the lower percentages of seropositivity <b>to</b> <b>H</b> pylori in the group treated with gold suggests that treatment with intramuscular gold decreases H pylori colonisation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractRole of {{intracellular}} glutathione in {{the response}} of Saccharomyces cerevisiae <b>to</b> <b>H</b> 2 O 2 was investigated. Depletion of cellular glutathione or inhibition of γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (GSH-I) enhanced the sensitivity <b>to</b> <b>H</b> 2 O 2 and suppressed the adaptation <b>to</b> <b>H</b> 2 O 2. A mutant deficient in GSH-I also showed the hypersensitivity and could not adapt <b>to</b> <b>H</b> 2 O 2. Incubation of the cell with amino acids constituting glutathione (l-Glu, l-Cys, Gly) increased the intracellular glutathione content, and subsequently the cell acquired resistance against H 2 O 2. These results strongly suggest that intracellular glutathione {{plays an important role}} in the adaptive response in S. cerevisiae to oxidative damage...|$|R

40|$|Hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) has {{dramatic}} physiological {{effects on}} {{animals that are}} associated with improved survival. C. elegans grown in H 2 S are long-lived and thermotolerant. To identify mechanisms by which adaptation <b>to</b> <b>H</b> 2 S effects physiological functions, we have measured transcriptional responses <b>to</b> <b>H</b> 2 S exposure. Using microarray analysis we observe rapid changes in the abundance of specific mRNAs. The number and magnitude of transcriptional changes increased with the duration of H 2 S exposure. Functional annotation suggests that genes associated with protein homeostasis are upregulated upon prolonged exposure <b>to</b> <b>H</b> 2 S. Previous work has shown that the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor, HIF- 1, is required for survival in H 2 S. In fact, we show that hif- 1 is required for most, if not all, early transcriptional changes in H 2 S. Moreover, our data demonstrate that SKN- 1, the C. elegans homologue of NRF 2, also contributes <b>to</b> <b>H</b> 2 S-dependent changes in transcription. We show that these results are functionally important, as skn- 1 is essential to survive exposure <b>to</b> <b>H</b> 2 S. Our results suggest a model in which HIF- 1 and SKN- 1 coordinate a broad transcriptional response <b>to</b> <b>H</b> 2 S that culminates in a global reorganization of protein homeostasis networks...|$|R
