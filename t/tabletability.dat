40|$|Purpose The goal of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} correlations between the physicomechanical properties of different grades of starches with their <b>tabletability.</b> Methods Corn-starch grades (PURE-DENT® B 700, PURE-DENT® B 810, and PURE-DENT® B 830) and pregelatinized corn-starch grades (SPRESS® B 818, SPRESS® B 820, and SPRESS® B 825) were studied for physicomechanical properties, dynamic sorption isotherm, moisture content [MC] (% w/w), dehydration enthalpy (J/g) [ΔHd], and percent crystallinity (%). Tablets (6 mm) were compressed from hand-weighed powders (constant true volume) using Gamlen Tablet Press (Compression pressure- 100 MPa; Compression speed- 5 mm/s, 50 mm/s). Tablet mechanical strength (TMS) and Heckel parameters were evaluated. Correlation between physicomechanical properties and compression descriptors was evaluated by multivariate method. Results All starches followed Type-III sorption isotherm with open hysteresis loop indicating their large amorphous content. High amorphous content was further confirmed with hollow diffraction peaks of starches in the powder X-ray diffraction studies. Glass transition temperature of all starches was about 101 °C. The moisture content and percent crystallinity of all starches was found statistically insignificant. However, PURE-DENT® B 830 and SPRESS® B 818 showed significantly low ΔHd values. Principle component analysis (PCA) loadings plot calculated with measured physicomechanical properties and TMS showed positive correlation between high Heckel Yield pressure values of plastic and elastic deformation and negative correlation with percent crystallinity, ΔHd, and MC along PC 1. These relationships confirmed expected phenomenon in PCA score plots that Starches (PURE-DENT® B 830 and SPRESS® B 818) with plastic deformation followed by low elastic recovery in the decompression phase shows better <b>tabletability.</b> Furthermore, positive correlation of low ΔHd with TMS might indicate that starches with easy availability of associated water (low ΔHd) might have better <b>tabletability</b> due to water induced material plasticization. Conclusion Out of the six different grades of starches studied PURE-DENT® B 830 and SPRESS® B 818 showed better <b>tabletability</b> regardless of similar MC and amorphous nature. The better <b>tabletability</b> of these two starches might be attributed to their better plasticization due to loosely bound associated water, and low elastic recovery in the decompression phase...|$|E
40|$|Metronidazole is a {{good example}} of {{high-dose}} drug substance with poor granulating and tableting properties. Tablets are generally produced by liquid granulation; however, the technological process failure is quite frequent. In order to verify how the metronidazole particle characteristics can influence granule properties, three metronidazole batches differing for crystal habit, mean particle size, BET surface area and wettability were selected, primarily designed according to their different elongation ratio: needle-shaped, stick-shaped, and isodimensional. In the presence of lactose monohydrate and pregelatinized maize starch, respectively as diluent and binder, they were included in a formula for wet granulation in a high-shear mixer-granulator. In order to render the process comparable as far as possible, all parameters and experimental conditions were maintained constant. Four granule batches were obtained: granules from placebo (G-placebo), granules from needle-shaped crystals (G-needle-shaped), granules from stick-shaped crystals (G-stick-shaped), and granules from isodimensional crystals (G-isodimensional). Different granule properties were considered, in particular concerning porosity, friability, loss on drying (LOD), and flowability. In order to study their <b>tabletability</b> and compressibility, the different granules obtained were then compressed in a rotary press. The best <b>tabletability</b> was obtained with the isodimensional batch, while the poorest was exhibited by the stick-shaped one. Differences in <b>tabletability</b> are in good accordance with compressibility results: to a better <b>tabletability</b> corresponds an important granule ability to undergo a volume reduction as a result of an applied pressure. In particular, it was proposed that the greatest compressibility of the G-isodimensional must be related to the greatest granule porosity percentage...|$|E
40|$|Dextrans are a {{class of}} {{carbohydrate}} polymers extensively applied in pharmaceutical applications, particularly as drug conjugate macromolecular carriers or drug delivery systems. These polysaccharides improve {{the stability of the}} therapeutics enabling also the control of their release, via either the parenteral and or oral routes. In the latter case, due to their gel forming ability they may have potential as hydrophilic matrix tablets for sustained drug release. In this paper, we investigated the behaviour of different molecular weight (1, 40, 500 and 2300 kDa) dextrans as tabletting excipients. Powder particle size and hygroscopic studies have been reported, together with <b>tabletability,</b> tablet stability and tablet swelling. Moreover we use tramadol as model compound to evaluate the ability of dextrans to control drug dissolution. The results suggest that dextrans with lower molecular weights may be a promising excipient to be used as filler for immediate release tablets, due to their good <b>tabletability</b> and fast dissolution rate, while dextrans with higher molecular weights could be an efficient disintegrant due to their swelling ability...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} work, authors {{produced}} tablets of anhydrous sodium naproxen by wet granulation using a high-shear mixer-granulator. Drug hydrated to the tetrahydrated form, as observed by X-ray powder diffractometry. After wet granulation, authors then performed two different drying procedures, obtaining granules of different water content and crystallographic characteristics. The first procedure dried granules in the high-shear mixer-granulator by applying vacuum {{at room temperature}} (batch A), while the second employed the same apparatus and time, under vacuum at 408 C (batch B). X-ray powder diffractometry revealed that the sodium naproxen (SN) contained in batch A granules {{was a mixture of}} dihydrated and tetrahydrated forms (as demonstrated by the coexistence of peaks typical of both hydrated forms), while that of batch B granules was a mixture of monohydrated and tetrahydrated forms. This means that differences in drying procedures could lead to products of different crystallographic properties. The behavior under compression was evaluated, revealing that batch A offered the best <b>tabletability</b> and compressibility. These results make it possible to conclude that differences in the crystallographic properties and water content of SN are such that different hydration/drying processes can alter the drug crystal form and thus the <b>tabletability</b> of the resulting granules...|$|E
40|$|To {{be fully}} exploitable in both {{formulation}} and manufacturing, a drug cocrystal needs to demonstrate simultaneous improvement of multiple key pharmaceutical properties over the pure drug crystal. The present work {{was aimed at}} investigating such feasibility with two model profen-nicotinamide cocrystals. Phase pure 1 : 1 ibuprofen-nicotinamide and flurbiprofen-nicotinamide cocrystals were prepared from solutions through rapid solvent removal using rotary evaporation,and characterized by DSC, PXRD, FTIR, phase solubility measurements, equilibrium moisture sorption analysis, dissolution testing and <b>tabletability</b> analysis. Temperature-composition phase diagrams constructed from DSC data for each profen and nicotinamide crystal revealed the characteristic melting point of the 1 : 1 cocrystal {{as well as the}} eutectic temperatures and compositions. Both cocrystals exhibited higher intrinsic dissolution rates than the corresponding profens. The cocrystals also sorbed less moisture and displayed considerably better <b>tabletability</b> than the individual profens and nicotinamide. Phase behaviors of 1 : 1 profen-nicotinamide cocrystal systems were delineated by constructing their temperature-composition phase diagrams. Cocrystallization with nicotinamide can simultaneously improve tableting behavior, hygroscopicity, and dissolution performance of ibuprofen and flurbiprofen. This could pave the way for further development of such cocrystal systems into consistent, stable, efficacious and readily manufacturable drug products. Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|With the {{ever-increasing}} {{need for}} development speed, {{the ability to}} complete a thorough characterization of formulations with small quantities of material is critical but is possible. Thorough characterization of formulation components (both the API and excipients) is a valuable precursor to initiating tablet formulation development activities. Physicochemical and mechanical property data provides key information and insight needed to select ingredients and unit processes. It also provides a valuable benchmark that allows the formulator to monitor changes and set meaningful specifications in raw materials throughout the development process (i. e., QbD). The appropriate use of small scale equipment and, most importantly, the careful and thorough physicochemical and mechanical property characterization at {{every step of the}} manufacturing process facilitates the development of robust and well [...] characterized formulations that can be more easily scaled. Compaction is the critical unit process that is the focus of this discussion. Meaningful tablet compaction using small quantities of formulation is possible with tablet compaction simulators, emulators, and even with a simple hydraulic press. The critical information to be obtained is tablet: compactibility, compressibility, <b>tabletability,</b> and manufacturability as a function of tablet solid fraction. Compactibility {{has been shown to be}} essentially independent of compaction speed whereas <b>tabletability,</b> compressibility, and manufacturability may be significantly influenced by compaction speed (dwell time) and this is valuable information. This presentation will discuss the generation, interpretation, and application of this vital compaction data to direct compression and dry granulation formulations using tablet press simulation/emulation...|$|E

The deformation behavior of neat polymers and binary mixes was evaluated using Heckel Analysis, strain rate sensitivity, work of compaction and elastic recovery index. Additionally, the compact forming ability of neat materials and binary mixes were evaluated by analyzing their <b>tabletability,</b> compressibility and compactibility profiles. The Heckel analysis of both polymers exhibited a speed-sensitive deformation behavior typical to plastic materials. The yield values of the binary mixes of the polymers with microcrystalline cellulose revealed a linear relationship with the weight fractions of individual components. The yield values of binary mixes of both the polymers with dibasic calcium phosphate exhibited slight negative deviations from linearity. Both polymers exhibited axial relaxation after ejection typical of viscoelastic materials, {{as measured by the}} elastic recovery index values. The work of compaction and the elastic recovery index values of the binary mixtures were found to be linearly related to the weight fractions of the individual components thus, confirming ideal mixing behavior based on the composition. Addition of microcrystalline cellulose to both polymers significantly improved their <b>tabletability</b> and compactibility. The tensile strengths of the compacts prepared with neat materials and binary mixes with microcrystalline cellulose, dibasic calcium phosphate and lactose were the function of their solid fraction and independent of the tableting speeds tested; thus, validating compactibility as a reliable parameter in predicting acceptable tablet properties...|$|E

40|$|Purpose To compare six {{commonly}} available silicates {{for their}} suitability to develop tablets by adsorbing components of liquid lipid-based drug delivery systems. Methods The <b>tabletability</b> of Aerosil ® 200, Sipernat ® 22, Sylysia® 350, Zeopharm ® 600, Neusilin ® US 2 and Neusilin ® UFL 2 were studied by compressing each silicate into tablets {{in the presence}} of 20 % microcrystalline cellulose and measuring the tensile strength of tablets produced. Three components of lipid based formulations, namely, Capmul ® MCM EP (glycerol monocaprylocaprate), Captex ® 355 EP/NF (caprylic/capric triglycerides) and Cremophor ® EL (PEG- 35 castor oil), were adsorbed individually onto the silicates at 1 : 1 w/w, and themixtureswere then compressed into tablets. The SEM photomicrographs of neat silicates and their 1 : 1 w/w mixtures (also 1 : 2 and 1 : 3 for Neusilin ® US 2 and Neusilin® UFL 2) with one of the liquids (Cremophor ® EL) were recorded. Results Neat Aerosil ® 200, Sipernat ® 22 and Sylysia ® 350 were non-tabletable to the minimum acceptable tensile strength of 1 MPa, and they were also non-tabletable in presence of liquid. While Zeopharm ® 600, Neusilin ® US 2 and Neusilin ® UFL 2 were tabletablewithout the addition of liquids, onlyNeusilin®US 2 retained acceptable <b>tabletability</b> with 1 : 1 liquid. The SEM images of silicate-liquid mixtures indicated that, except for Neusilin®US 2, much of the adsorbed liquid distributed primarily at the surface of particles rather than inside pores, which hindered their compaction into tablets. Conclusion Among the six silicates studied, Neusilin ® US 2 was the only silicate able to produce tablets with acceptable tensile strength in presence of a lipid component at 1 : 1 w/w ratio {{due to the fact that}} the liquid was mostly adsorbed into the pores of the silicate rather than at the surface...|$|E
40|$|Several low-hydroxypropyl {{cellulose}} (L-HPC) derivatives (LH- 11, 21, 22, 31 and 32) differing in granulometric {{particle size}} or in hydroxypropyl content were {{considered in the}} present study. The L-HPC grades were characterized as pure powders, {{in order to determine}} both compression and densification behaviour, in presence or in absence of magnesium stearate as lubricant, and then, were physically mixed in different proportions with metronidazole, which was also previously characterized as pure powder. The <b>tabletability</b> and compressibility of these binary mixtures were then evaluated, in presence or in absence magnesium stearate as lubricant at two different compression speeds (20 and 70 mm/s). It was observed that both binary mixture compression behaviour and capping tendency were influenced by compression speed and by the presence of lubricant. Differences in anti-capping efficiency between the L-HPCs may be related to their hydroxypropyl content. This parameter influences the interaction between the metronidazole and the polymer particles, and consequently the ability of the binary system to undergo densification under compression...|$|E
40|$|Nimesulide is {{a typical}} nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drug (NSAID), widely used in solid oral formulations. By crystallizing nimesulide from an ethanol solution a crystalline form was obtained, different from the reference sample, as confirmed by X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and solid cross polarization-magic angle spinning (C- 13 -CPMAS) NMR. Moreover, when crystallized from dioxane nimesulide forms a solvate. The solvate was characterized by XRPD, IR-spectrometry, DSC, thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) and by C- 13 -CPMAS NMR. In particular, through this technique, the presence of several conformational isomers was demonstrated. In addition to the physico-chemical characterization, the technological properties of nimesulide, namely densification and tableting, were evaluated. Contrarily to the other forms that are affected by capping phenomena at increasing compression pressures, the form obtained by desolvation of dioxane solvate has positive effect on tableting properties, increasing both compressibility and <b>tabletability</b> of nimesulide.

40|$|Â© 2014 American Chemical Society. The {{existence}} of a cocrystal between curcumin (CUR) and phloroglucinol (PHL) was suspected but could not be demonstrated in a recent systematic effort to synthesize novel curcumin cocrystals. We hypothesize that the elusive CUR-PHL cocrystal is a kinetically stable form that can be prepared by trapping it using a fast solvent removal crystallization process. The polarity of crystallization solvent and relative solubility of cocrystal formers in the solvent appear to be critical parameters governing the phase purity of the resulting cocrystal. Organic solvents of higher polarity and in which the cocrystal formers exhibited congruent solubility tended to afford a purer cocrystal phase. Essentially phase-pure CUR-PHL cocrystals were successfully obtained from acetone, and their 1 : 1 stoichiometry was confirmed by differential scanning calorimetry and solid state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Compared with the individual component phases, the cocrystal displayed reduced hygroscopicity and improved <b>tabletability.</b> However, the intrinsic dissolution rate of the cocrystal showed no significant improvement compared with the pure CUR crystal due to the instantaneous conversion of the cocrystal to CUR at its surface upon contact with the dissolution medium.

Three operating parameters the roller speed, the hydraulic {{pressure and the}} granulator speed on the Alexanderwerk WP 120 Pharma Roll Compactor were varied. The planned response variable for study was % retention over # 60 BSS mesh. The number of compaction cycles required to get not less than 90 % retention over # 60 BSS mesh were evaluated. These optimized operating parameters were used during drug granulation for formulation variable optimization. The granules obtained from process optimization study were compressed at kilogram scale using ingredients in concentration selected from formulation optimization study to evaluate for the loss in <b>tabletability,</b> a phenomenon commonly observed with RCDG technology.

The aim of this work was to characterize the technological properties of citrus fibers necessary for their use as a processing aid in tableting. The results obtained showed that citrus fibers share many properties of other polysaccharides used as tableting excipients, such as thermal behavior and compaction mechanism, together with an appreciable <b>tabletability.</b> However, the most interesting properties resulted from their disintegration power. Citrus fibers behaved in a similar manner to the well-known super disintegrant croscarmellose sodium and resulted to be little susceptible to their concentration, to lubricant type, and lubricant concentration.

40|$|Salt {{formation}} {{is an effective}} method of improving physicochemical properties of acidic and basic drugs. The selection of a salt form most suitable for drug development requires a well-designed screening strategy to ensure various issues are addressed in the early development stages. Triboelectrification of pharmaceutical powders may cause problems during processing such as segregation of components due {{to the effects of}} particle adhesion. However, very little work has been done on the effect of salt formation on triboelectrification properties. In this paper, salts of flurbiprofen were prepared by combining the drug with a selection of closely related amine counter ions. The aim of the work was to investigate the impact of the counter ion on electrostatic charge of the resultant salts to inform the salt selection process. The experimental results show the magnitude of charge and polarity of the flurbiprofen salts to be highly dependent on the type of counter ion selected for the salt formation. Furthermore, particle adhesion to the stainless steel surface of the shaking container and the salts’ compression properties were measured. The formed salts had lower electrostatic charges, improved <b>tabletability,</b> and resulted in reduced adhesion of these powders compared with the parent drug...|$|E

Four samples, characterized by different crystal habit, were selected: sample A, sample E andsample T, recrystallizedrespectively from acetone, ethanol andTHF by addition of water as non-solvent andsample M recrystallized from methanol by temperature decrease. By SEM analysis, sample were characterized with the respect of their crystal habit, mean particle diameter and elongation ratio. Sample A appears stick-shaped, sample E acicular with lamellar characteristics, samples T and M polyhedral. DSC and X-ray diffraction studies permit to exclude a polymorphic modification of ibuprofen during crystallization. For all samples micromeritics properties, densification behaviour and compression ability was analysed. Sample M shows a higher densification tendency, evidenciated by its higher apparent and tapped particle density. The ability to densificate is also pointed out by D 0 ’ value of Heckel’s plot, which indicate the rearrangement of original particles at the initial stage of compression. This fact is relatedto the crystal habit of sample M, which is characterizedby strongly smoothed coins. The increase in powder bed porosity permits a particle–particle interaction of greater extent during the subsequent stage of compression, which allows higher <b>tabletability</b> andcompressibility...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{establish}} a correlation between water uptake by anhydrous sodium naproxen (ASN) at two different relative humidities and modifications in tableting and densification behaviour under hydration. Water uptake was evaluated at different relative humidities. Models for the hydration kinetics of ASN at 55 % and 86 %. corresponding to the formation of the dihydrated and tetrahydrated forms, respectively, were evaluated assuming Eyring's dependence on temperature. <b>Tabletability,</b> compressibility, compactibility, and densification behaviour were determined using an instrumented single punch tablet machine. Kinetic data are consistent with a model where water molecules enter the crystal preferentially along hydrophilic tunnels existing in the crystal structure and corresponding to the propionate side chain. Water inclusion perturbs the crystallographic structure, causing slight structural changes according to the amount and associated to an increase in entropy. The interposition of water molecules between sodium naproxen molecules weakens intermolecular bonds, and these sites can behave like sliding planes under compression. Such structural changes may explain the improved compression behaviour and modified densification propensity mechanism. Kinetic data describing the water hydration mechanism of ASN explain in an original way the improved tableting and densification properties under hydration. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V.

SMCC (silicified microcrystalline cellulose) -Prosolv® 90, SMCC HD-Prosolv® 90 HD, Avicel® PH 102 and Mannitol 60 were evaluated as co-excipients {{to improve the}} processability of zein powder. Zein/SMCC-Prosolv® 90 blend had the best flowability and <b>tabletability.</b> Tablets with tramadol hydrochloride, zein and SMCCProsolv® 90 were prepared by direct compression. Drug release from the tablets was measured by dissolution testing. The dissolution profiles obtained were compared using the dissolution efficiency (DE) and were fitted to the Korsmeyer–Peppas equation. Controlled drug release, governed by anomalous (non-Fickian) drug transport, was obtained over the test duration. Drug release rate and mechanism were dependent on formulation parameters, such as tablet hardness, zein/SMCC ratio and drug loading, as well as medium pH. Dynamics of tablets swelling correlated well with drug release rate and mechanism, with faster drug release and greater contribution of polymer relaxation being obtained at increased swelling. In conclusion, the present work has shown that zein/SMCC based matrix formulation {{can be used as}} a new platform for oral-controlled drug delivery which can be easily customized by adjusting formulation parameters.

Insights into the APIs mechanical behaviour not only assist {{in the selection of}} optimum tabletting process but the choice of suitable excipients for dosage blend. Prediction of the {{mechanical properties}} of seven solid forms was described in this study two of which were used at the initial stage to develop the model. The objective of the model is to test the reliability of applying molecular and crystallographic modelling to predict the slip behaviour of APIs which will provide a quick tool for observing the mechanical properties. Plane rugosity and interlock properties were calculated for the first time by taking the crystallographic properties of each compound. The prediction model comprises of three main components. Firstly, the identification of likely dislocation Burgers vectors based on lattice geometry and dependency to line dislocation; secondly, selection of slip planes for plastic deformation using the calculation of interplanar interactions, rugosity and surface energy and thirdly, characterisations of slip systems or propensity for cleavage and fracture. The pentaerythritol and its derivative, pentaerythritol tetranitrate were selected as the basis structure during development of model because of known cleave and plastic behaviour.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis was to investigate a mechanical dry powder coating approach to improve flow and fluidization of cohesive powder for producing direct compaction tablets. A fine cohesive ibuprofen powder (D₅₀= 25 µm) with a low-melting point (~ 76 °C) was coated with varying coating materials (magnesium stearate (MgSt), l-leucine, sodium stearyl fumarate (SSF) and silica-R 972) {{in order to examine}} the effects on flow and <b>tabletability</b> of the processed powders. Firstly, ibuprofen powder was dry coated via mechanofusion with between 0. 1 to 5 % (w/w) MgSt. ToF-SIMS demonstrated high degrees of coating coverage of MgSt on the particle surfaces. Robust tablets could be produced from the mechanofused powders and surprisingly the release rate of drug was not retarded. This is the first study to demonstrate such a single-step dry coating of ibuprofen with MgSt, with promising flow improvement and non-inhibited dissolution rate. Secondly, ibuprofen powder was dry coated with 1 % (w/w) of several materials including MgSt, l-leucine, SSF and silica-R 972 to screen potential coating materials and develop directly-compacted tablets of high-dose drug. FT 4 powder characterisation indicated coating of MgSt, l-leucine and silica-R 972 produced improvement in powder flow. ToF-SIMS demonstrated a near-complete layer on the drug particle surface after coating with MgSt and silica-R 972. The dissolution rates of all mechanofused powders were enhanced even with a hydrophobic material such as MgSt and silica. Such enhanced dissolution rate was attributed to the lesser agglomeration resulting from the reduced cohesion between the drug particles after mechanofusion. Thirdly, ibuprofen powders with various coating materials (MgSt, l-leucine and silica-R 972), PVP and superdisintegrant were co-processed using mechanofusion and then directly compacted into tablets to achieve a single-step tablet production. FT 4 indicated substantial improvement in powder flow. Robust tablets were produced from the co-processed ibuprofen and all excipient powders and the dissolution rates of these tablets were enhanced compared to control batch. However, the tablets made with silica-R 972 -mechanofused powders could not dinsitegrate and release under the same conditions. Finally, l-leucine has been found to have promising capacity of improving flowability of ibuprofen powder via mechanofusion. Such processed powder was able to be compacted into tablets directly. Therefore, a study was proposed to evaluate the influence of particle size of l-leucine (D₅₀ of 10 – 260 µm) on the flowability and <b>tabletability</b> of mechanofused ibuprofen powder. ToF-SIMS demonstrated an increasing trend of coverage level of l-leucine on the drug particle surface with reducing l-leucine particle size. Dissolution data of processed powders were fitted with multi-exponential equation models, representing dissolution from dispersed and agglomerated particle distributions. In conclusion, improvements in ibuprofen powder flowability via mechanofusion can result in a promising trend allowing tablets to be formed by direct compaction and enhanced dissolution rate of both powders and tablets. Surprisingly, coating of hydrophobic guest particles did promote dissolution of powders or corresponding tablets rather than retardance of dissolution rates. Multi-exponential modelling indicated that such improvements in the dissolution performance were attributed to the reduction in agglomerate strength caused by decreasing powder intrinsic cohesion after surface modification...|$|E
40|$|The work {{investigates the}} adhesive/cohesive {{molecular}} and physical interactions together with nanoscopic features of commonly used orally disintegrating tablet (ODT) excipients microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) and D-mannitol. This helps to elucidate the underlying physico-chemical and mechanical mechanisms responsible for powder densification and optimum product functionality. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) contact mode {{analysis was performed}} to measure nano-adhesion forces and surface energies between excipient-drug particles (6 - 10 different particles per each pair). Moreover, surface topography images (100 nm 2 - 10 µm 2) and roughness data were acquired from AFM tapping mode. AFM data were related to ODT macro/microscopic properties obtained from SEM, FTIR, XRD, thermal analysis using DSC and TGA, disintegration testing, Heckel and <b>tabletability</b> profiles. The study results showed a good association between the adhesive molecular and physical forces of paired particles and the resultant densification mechanisms responsible for mechanical strength of tablets. MCC micro roughness was 3 times that of D-mannitol which explains the high hardness of MCC ODTs due to mechanical interlocking. Hydrogen bonding between MCC particles could not be established from both AFM and FTIR solid state investigation. On the contrary, D-mannitol produced fragile ODTs due to fragmentation of surface crystallites during compression attained from its weak crystal structure. Furthermore, AFM analysis has shown the presence of extensive micro fibril structures inhabiting nano pores which further supports the use of MCC as a disintegrant. Overall, excipients (and model drugs) showed mechanistic behaviour on the nano/micro scale that {{could be related to}} the functionality of materials on the macro scale...|$|E
40|$|Oral tablets are {{convenient}} and widely administered drugdosage forms. The mechanical properties {{of a drug}} substance such as plasticity, ability to cohere into compacts and friction/adhesion are important {{in the development of}} a tablet formulation. Crystal engineering is an interesting and viabletool for improving or optimizing these technical properties of a drug substance. The creation of a lternative polymorphic forms, cocrystals, salts or hydrates of a drug substance can result in structural variations in the molecular packing of the crystals and, thereby, can alter the deformation behavior of the materials. Knowledge of the relationships between crystal modifications and the technical properties in multicomponent systems is limited, but represents a possibility to predict mechanical properties based on crystalstructure that facilitates engineering particles for the optimal processing performance. The overall objective of this thesis is thus to gain better understanding of the relationships between the crystal structure features and the mechanical properties of cocrystals and salts. Paracetamol form I, its cocrystals with oxalic acid and 4, 4 ´-bipyridine, and its hydrochloride salt were selected as model systems in the study. The materials were scaled-up using rational crystallization methods and the physical purity was confirmed. The relevant properties of these powders were determined. Tablets were then made at applied pressures of 50 - 250 MPa under controlled conditions. The <b>tabletability</b> and compactability of the powders were determined. The compression mechanics of the powders were the investigated according to a material classification protocol. Slip planes were identified by visually observing the crystal structures and based on the attachment energies calculated using different force fields in the materialsstudio. The tensile strengths of the powders increased with increasing pressure and the <b>tabletability</b> decreased in the order oxalic acid>paracetamol-hydrochloride salt≈paracetamol-oxalic acid> 4, 4 ´-bipyridine>paracetamol- 4, 4 ´-bipyridine. The tensile strength of the tablets decreased exponentially with increasing porosity,with some exceptions. Ingeneral, the cocrystals and the salt displayed intermediate compression characteristics as compared to the reference substances. The elastic recovery of the cocrystal and salt forms of paracetamol was not markedly different from that of paracetamol. It was found that slip plane prediction based on the attachment energies was not reliable. While it was possible to explain the improved tableting properties of powders based on the crystal features (i. e. the presence of slip planes and flat layers), no clear relationship was found with yield pressure. This may be attributed to possible brittle material characteristics and the surface energies of the crystals,which need to be further studied. Thus, cocrystallization and salt formation introduced structural features that were responsible for changes in the compaction and compression properties of drug substances. In future work, we intend to extend these studies to provide a clear picture of structure-mechanical property relationships in organic molecular crystals over multiple length scales;molecules to crystals to bulk powder.

40|$|Scale-up of {{tableting}} {{process is}} particularly difficult due to specific concerns related {{exclusively to the}} process itself and that cannot be determined on a smaller scale, which are the effect of compression speed and the build-up of heat due {{to the length of}} the compaction operations. In this work, it has been simulated the rise of temperature observed during the tablets manufacturing in a full production scale by means of an appropriate modification of a R&D rotary tablet machine. Four common pharmaceutical excipients, characterized by different chemical nature, consolidation behaviour and temperature sensitiveness have been analysed in terms of compaction mechanism (Heckel and energy analysis) and <b>tabletability,</b> in order to verify any effect of the increase of temperature. The results showed a relevance of the temperature on mechanical tablets properties only on materials characterized by low temperature thermal transitions (melting or glass transition), while, for compounds which do not exhibit thermal events at low temperature, it becomes less important for ductile materials and irrelevant for brittle materials. Heckel analysis highlighted a noticeable increase of ductility only in those materials whose tablets mechanical properties depended on the temperature. On the other hand, energy analysis showed low sensitivity failing to identify any temperature effect on compaction materials properties. This work showed how to simulate the process of temperature rise on a small scale and the influence of temperature on materials compaction properties. The use of a modified tableting machine, able to control the temperature and moisture levels and also capable of monitoring the punch movements, resulted in identifying the effect of temperature both on mechanical and compaction properties on materials. Thus, it represents a valuable tool in order to provide useful information at an early stage during the development of tablets formulations...|$|E

Chiiosan is {{a natural}} {{polysaccharide}} that is obtained by the partial deacetylation of chitin, the second most abundant natural polymer. Chiiosan is currently extensively utilised in various pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical preparations. It has found wide applicability in conventional pharmaceutical devices as a potential formulation excipient. As a pharmaceutical excipient, its main contribution seems to be as an absorption enhancer of large molecule drugs from the gastro-intestinal tract (through "tight junctions") and as a fat absorber in dietary products. Although it is present in various tablet preparations, l i l e if any {{is known about the}} tabletabiliiy of this versatile polymer. Characterisation of chiiosan raw material revealed poor flowabili, a large partide size distribution and poor compressibility. These properties provided the challenges circumvented in this study. The direct compression of chiiosan indicated that the flowabilii and compressibility of the polymer were insufficient to produce acceptable tablets comprising of pure chiiosan raw material. Therefore, chitosan was combined with ~vicepP H 200 and ~rosolpSM CCm 90 respectively. The properties of tablets comprising of chitosan and these directly compressible fillers were compared in terms of filler concentration and mixing time. It was found that ~vicepPH 200 proved to be most effective at a concentration of 30 % (whnr). Furthermore, a mixing time of 10 minutes produced optimal results for all the chiiosan Ifi ller combinations. The inclusion of single dry binders was investigated to assess the suitability of dry binders as enhancers of the binding properties of chiiosan raw material. Kollidon" VA- 64 (co-polyvidone) and Methocep KlOOM (hydroxypropylmethylcellulose) were combined respectively with chiiosan raw material in concentrations of 4, 5, 7, 10, 15 or 20 % wb. It was evident that chiiosan exhibited a significantly higher sensitivity for Kdlidon' VA- 64 than for Methocep K 100 M. A log-linear relatiin between the Kollidon" VA- 64 concentration and crushing strength was identified. This could be considered a significant attribute of the chiiosan I Kdliion' VA- 64 combination, since this correlation could be utilised to predict the crushing strength of tablets comprising of chitosan and Kollion' VA- 64 at any given concentration of the binder. In comparison with the combinations containing the directly compressible fillers the formulation comprising of 20 % w/w Kollidong VA- 64 produced superior crushing strength and friability. Conversely, the chiiosan I ~ethocef' KlOOM mixtures revealed erratic and relatively unacceptable results in terms of crushing strength and friability. However, the presence of Methocep KlOOM in the formulations seemed advantageous to tablet disintegration. Therefore, the combination of both binders in different concentration ratios were investigated to determine whether a combination of the dry binders would result in potentiation of the binding effect during compression and furthermore if the presence of Methocap KlOOM would enhance the disintegration of the tablets. Concentration ratios of 1 :l; 3 :l and 1 : 3 (~ollidon~ VA- 64 : ~ e t h ~ ~K 1 e 00 PM) were utilised during these experiments. The formulations comprising of single dry binders produced superior results compared to the formulations containing the dry binder combinations. Furthermore, it was evident that the binder combinations did not result in the potentiation of the binding effect nor did it prove advantageous in terms of tablet disintegration. Since the characterisation of chiiosan raw material proved that this polymer exhibited poor flowability, the subsequent wet granulation of chiiosan was investigated utilising low and high speed granulation. ~ollidon" VA- 64 (mpolyvidone) and ~ e t h ~ ~ e p KlOOM (hydroxypropylmethylcellulose) were the two binders utilised in concentrations of 3 % and 5 % w/w respectively during granulation. Wet granulation of the polymer did improve the flowabillity, however, the inherent characteristics of chiiosan still affected the <b>tabletability</b> of the material. Therefore, the indusion of extragranular binder was necessitated to improve the binding of chiiosan granules during compression. Kollidon" VA- 64 and Methocep KlOOM were utilised as external binders in concentrations of 3, 5, 7 and 10 % w/w. Generally, the granulation processes overall improved the <b>tabletability</b> of the polymer since it was possible to compress larger quantities of chitosan with the aid of selected binders. ~ollidoVnA~- 64 posed to be better suited as a granulation binder for chitosan, compared to Methocep K 100 M. Dissolution studies provided a method to determine the effect(s) of chiiosan as well as the induded binders on drug release. Furosemide was induded in seleded formulations as a tracer drug. The gel-forming ability of chiiosan in acidic pH evidently decreased the release rate of the incorporated drug. Dissolution profiles of all the formulations containing chiiosan granules and extragranular binder indicated sustained release of furosemide (24 hour period). Since ~ethocepK lOOM also possesses the ability to form a gel layer on contact with water or biological fluid, the produdion of matrix tablets was a possibility. However, it was clear that a total concentration of 15 % wlw ~eth-P KIOOM was insufficient to achieve matrix-like dissolution profiles. The combination of chiosan and ~ethoce$K IOOM proved to be advantageous in the formulation of sustained release dosage forms. Short-term stability testing of chiosan raw material proved that the exposure of chitosan to elevated temperatures had a detrimental effect on the <b>tabletability</b> of the polymer. Furthermore, it was evident that lower moisture content (sorbed water) detrimentally affected the compressibility of chiiosan raw material. Long-term stability testing indicated that ambient conditions could have pronounced effects on the physical properties of the raw material, chiosan tablets as well as the granules. Furthermore, the tablets comprising of ~ethocep KIOOM revealed the most significant deterioration in terms of crushing strength and friability. In contradidion, the tablets containing Avicep PH 200 revealed the most acceptable results, confirming that direct compression produced the optimal system in terms of product stability. However, the combination of chitosan with binders allows the exclusion of Avicep PH 200. However, the formulations containing binders (granulate) revealed poor stability. It could be concluded that the storage of chiosan raw material, tablets or granules should be ensured at temperatures lower that 25 "C and relative humidity not exceeding 60 %. The optimisation of chiiosan raw material for utilisation in tablet formulations as well as its applicability as pharmaceutical excipient was pertinently illustrated. Master...|$|E

The {{development}} of direct compression as the choice method of tablet manufacture can be promoted from two major advantages {{posed by the}} process. The method is a phenomenal time saving process due to its relative simplicity (blending of components followed by tableting directly afterwards). The consequence of these phenomena is acceleration of the production rate of tablets, ultimately resulting in vast economical benefits (Otto, 2002 :X). The growing interest for multiple-unit dosage forms, especially minitablets (2 - 3 mm in diameter), and their increasing share of the pharmaceutical product market are claimed by their proponents to stem from advantages they offer over single-unit dosage forms, such as more uniform transit, less variability and a smaller risk of dose dumping. Other advantages like their large surface area and uniformity adds to their wide field of applications. The use of minitablets would therefore constitute a potential economic saving {{through the use of}} less excipients, few and inexpensive production steps, and if to be coated, reduced amounts of coating material required. Chitosan is a natural polysaccharide that is obtained by the partial deacetylation of chitin, the second most abundant natural polymer. Since chitosan combines unique physicochemical characteristics, in vivo biodegradability, biocompatibility, non-toxicity, and antimicrobial action, it has been widely investigated {{over the last few years}} for potential applications in the medical and pharmaceutical fields. As a pharmaceutical excipient, its main contribution seems to be as an absorption enhancer of large molecular drugs from the gastrointestinal tract (through "tight junctions") and as a fat absorber in dietary products. Although it is present in various tablet preparations, little if any is known about the <b>tabletability</b> or inclusion of this versatile polymer into minitablets. Characterisation of chitosan powder revealed a large particle size and a narrow particle size distribution which had a detrimental effect on the flowability of the powder, however, did not preclude the employment of chitosan. Due to its density results it could be predicted that chitosan would produce significantly compacted tablets of minimum weight, thus questioning its compactibility propensity. During preformulation studies it was found that the production of pure chitosan tablets were impossible without the inclusion of other excipients, however, it was possible to produce minitablets which did not necessitate the presence of a lubricant. The chitosan minitablets did however, not disintegrate and were of poor mechanical strength. It was these properties that provided the challenges that were circumvented in this study. The addition of the sparingly water-soluble, hydrophobic drug, furosemide, perplexed the formulations of chitosan minitablets, however, provided a mode of evaluation of the effects of formulation variables on tracer substance dissolution behaviour. The physical stability of chitosan minitablets indicated sensitivity towards varying ambient conditions regardless the inclusion of Kollidon(R) VA 64 as chitosan easily dehydrate. It was furthermore evident that the presence of moisture (sorbed water) had a considerable influence on the <b>tabletability</b> and disintegration of chitosan powder. Furthermore, the stability of chitosan powder deteriorated to a greater extent than the chitosan minitablets which were subjected to the same conditions. It is therefore recommended that chitosan minitablets should be stored at a temperature not exceeding 25 °C at a relatively low humidity (60 %). It was also evident that the presence of Kollidon(R) VA 64 as well as the method of inclusion of this binder influenced the stability of chitosan tablets. Thus, direct compression of chitosan granules which comprised of 5 % w/w Kollidon(R) VA 64 produced the optimal system in terms of product stability. Additionally, evaluation of chitosan tablets should be performed at consistent intervals as these tablets showed a time-dependent behavioural pattern regarding their physical properties. Systematic evaluations of various commercially available excipients were investigated to determine their effects on the physical tablet properties as well as on tracer (furosemide) dissolution. The tablet weight and dimensions of the different formulations did not vary discernibly, regardless the method used for production of the filler-system. Thus, exceptional good flowability was illustrated despite the extensive percentage chitosan, and the inclusion of furosemide into the formulations. The inclusion of furosemide did, however, portray a slightly detrimental effect on the crushing strength of the minitablets compressed at the same compression setting. Furthermore, the crushing strengths of all the minitablet formulations were very low (> 80 N) and the addition of other excipients did play a significant role in the crushing strengths of the different formulations. It might be suggested that the inclusion of a binder could not be seen as the only contributor to tablet strength. Friability results for all of the formulations were in congruence with the results obtained for tablet strength. Friability and tablet hardness do not, however, play an important role in minitablets as these tablets are encapsulated and are thus, not subjected to intensive handling. The efficiency of the minitablet formulations in this study were, however, determined and set apart through the disintegration, and more importantly, the dissolution properties of the different formulations. Most of the formulations resulted in tablets that disintegrated well within the set limit of 15 minutes. The production of a 5 % w/w Kollidon(R) VA 64 filler-system through granulation proved detrimental to the disintegration process for all the different formulations. Interestingly, formulations containing a buffer disintegrated faster than formulations where a disintegrant was incorporated. It was furthermore demonstrated that formulations containing ascorbic acid disintegrated slower than formulations containing sodium bicarbonate, whereas formulations containing Kollidon(R) CL disintegrated significantly slower than formulations containing Ac-Di-Sol(R). These results indicated that Ac-Di-Sol(R) is the preferred choice of disintegrant when used in these concentrations and in combinations with various buffers. Furthermore, the level of disintegrant or buffer determined the efficiency of disintegration to a large extent. The higher level imparted a more significant enhancement of disintegration effectiveness than did the type of excipient incorporated. When considering formulations where sodium bicarbonate and a disintegrant were combined, formulations which contained 2 % w/w sodium bicarbonate disintegrated the fastest. It would seem that. the inclusion of sodium bicarbonate imparted a more significant enhancement of disintegration effectiveness than did any other variable and that this buffer should be included in formulations containing Ac-Di-Sol(R) so as to enhance the disintegration process. Comparison of the dissolution parameters of all of the formulations clearly indicated the dependency of the area under the dissolution curve (AUC) on the initial dissolution rate (DRi). The decreased DRi-values of both furosemide and chitosan, however, were contradictory to the prodigious disintegration of all the chitosan formulations which validated that tablet disintegration is no absolute guarantee for drug dissolution. It was further evident that formulation variables played a much more pronounced role during dissolution testing than with the physical properties. The incorporation of 5 % w/w Kollidon(R) VA 64 into the different formulations through physically mixing provided tablets with enhanced dissolution properties for both furosemide and chitosan, whereas Methocel(R) KIOOM inhibited the onset of dissolution. The high AUCn values of all of the formulations containing a buffer, regardless the concentration used, suggested dissolution conditions comparable and even superior to that of a furosemide suspension. This could be attributed to thorough dispersion of the primary drug particles throughout the medium before settling at the bottom of the dissolution vessel. Incorporation of 0. 5 % w/w ascorbic acid led to an increased dispensation of furosemide due to increased chitosan solubility. However, the ascorbic acid created an unfavourable microenvironment for the furosemide to be able to dissolve promptly. A more significant increase in dissolution of furosemide was produced through the incorporation of sodium bicarbonate into the minitablet formulations. The observed increase in the DRi of furosemide from these tablets was attributed to a pH-increase in the microenvironment and an increase in solvent penetration into the tablets due to the creation of capillaries. However, an increase in sodium bicarbonate concentration had a negative influence on the microenvironment of the chitosan which only dissolves in an acidic environment, thus inhibiting prompt dissolution. It could clearly be seen that the incorporation of a disintegrant resulted in the most significant change in the dissolution profiles and the efficiency of these super-disintegrants were indeed concentration-dependent. Furthermore, it could be concluded that formulations containing Ac-Di-Sol(R) depicted faster dissolution rates and more pronounced extent of dissolution than formulations containing Kollidon(R) CL. The formulations containing 0. 625 % w/w Ac-Di- Sol(R) illustrated a significant positive linear dependence of (AUC) n on (DRi) n, whilst Kollidon(R) CL formulations illustrated a slightly less apparent dependence. However, an increase in concentration of Ac-Di-Sol(R) resulted in an inadequate correlation coefficient, thus, indicating that the (AUC) n were less dependant on the (DRi) n with increasing concentrations of this disintegrant. There was no discernable vindication for the inclusion of a combination of a disintegrant and ascorbic acid into the formulations. It was rather the inclusion of a disintegrant which played a more pronounced role in the dissolution parameters. It was however clear that the inclusion of 2. 0 % w/w sodium bicarbonate into formulations containing Ac-Di-Sol(R) rendered tablets with exceptional dissolution properties. Ac-Di-Sol(R) and sodium bicarbonate had a synergistic effect on the dissolution of both furosemide and chitosan in an acidic medium. The formulation (CF/ 36) which contained a physically mixed filler-system (consisting of chitosan and 5 % w/w Kollidon(R) VA 64) with 1. 25 % w/w Ac-Di-Sol(R) and 2 % w/w sodium bicarbonate derived the most suitable dissolution properties (84. 18 % furosemide dissolved). It is thus evident that the undesirable properties of chitosan could be modified to comply with the set standards of directly compressed minitablets. The incorporation of the CF/ 36 formulation into capsules proved successful as the capsules Disintegrated within +- 60 seconds releasing and dispersing their contents into the dissolution medium. It was only due to the lag time that the disintegration of the capsules and the Avicel(R) PH-IOI matrix provided that the end furosemide concentration dissolved, had not yet been reached. However, these dissolution profiles still followed the same curve as the profile of the CF/ 36 minitablets. Capsules containing CF/ 36 tablets and Avicel(R) PH-IOI did not separate as promptly as capsules which did not contain a protective filler and contrary to previous findings these capsules depicted slightly less favourable dissolution profiles than capsules containing only the minitablets. This was probably due to the formation of a rather viscous microcrystalline cellulose matrix around the minitablets which first had to disintegrate preceding disintegration of the minitablets. Chitosan does not rank highly regarding its employment as first choice filler. Undesirable properties that limit its utilisation include its hydration propensity influencing stability, problematic tablet strength characteristics and the availability of fillers that circumvent some of the undesirable properties of chitosan. This study, however, proved that chitosan could serve as a relatively cheap alternative to other direct compression fillers especially in the formulation of minitablets, if the formulations were carefully optimised. Furthermore, its mucoadhesive and absorption enhancing properties could also benefit and improve bioavailability of various poorly absorbed compounds or active ingredients. Based on these results, the {{development of}} an optimised chitosan multifunctional excipient seems an attainable and relevant objective which is comparable and even superior to commercial products.
