5|$|Ny-Ålesund was {{established}} as a mining company town by Kings Bay in 1916. Between 1925 and 1928, four {{attempts were made to}} reach <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Pole</b> by air from Ny-Ålesund. In May 1925, Roald Amundsen used Ny-Ålesund as a base for two flying boats, but the expedition failed to come closer than 88 degrees north. On 9 May 1926, Floyd Bennett and Richard E. Byrd used Ny-Ålesund as both the starting and landing for their expedition. Although they claimed to have reached the pole, there is strong evidence that they could not have accomplished this. On 11 May, Amundsen and Umberto Nobile's airship Norge left Ny-Ålesund and traveled via <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Pole</b> to Alaska. This is regarded as the first successful expedition to <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Pole.</b> After two short skirmishes, Nobile's airship Italia left Ny-Ålesund on 23 May 1928 to reach <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Pole,</b> but crashed on the return.|$|E
5|$|S. A. Andrée's Arctic balloon {{expedition}} of 1897 was {{an effort}} to reach <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Pole</b> in which all three expedition members perished. S.A.Andrée (1854–97), the first Swedish balloonist, proposed a voyage by hydrogen balloon from Svalbard to either Russia or Canada, which was to pass, with luck, straight over <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Pole</b> on the way. The scheme was received with patriotic enthusiasm in Sweden, a northern nation that had fallen behind in the race for <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Pole.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>North</b> Magnetic <b>Pole</b> is <b>the</b> {{point on}} the surface of Earth's Northern Hemisphere at which the planet's {{magnetic}} field points vertically downwards (in other words, if a magnetic compass needle is allowed to rotate about a horizontal axis, it will point straight down). There is only one location where this occurs, near (but distinct from) <b>the</b> Geographic <b>North</b> <b>Pole</b> and <b>the</b> Geomagnetic <b>North</b> <b>Pole.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>North</b> Magnetic <b>Pole</b> is {{approximately}} 965 kilometers from <b>the</b> geographic <b>north</b> <b>pole.</b> <b>The</b> pole drifts considerably each day, and since 2007 it moves about 55 to 60 km per {{year as a}} result of this phenomenon.|$|R
5|$|Above the Arctic Circle, {{an extreme}} case is reached {{where there is}} no {{daylight}} at all for part of the year, up to six months at <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Pole</b> itself, a polar night. In the Southern Hemisphere, the situation is exactly reversed, with the South Pole oriented opposite the direction of <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Pole.</b> Six months later, this pole will experience a midnight sun, a day of 24 hours, again reversing with the South Pole.|$|E
5|$|Brian and Stewie {{decide to}} go to <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Pole</b> to kill Santa, but Brian does not want Stewie to get {{disappointed}} if Santa is not what everybody thinks he is; to this Stewie responds that Brian is as negative as Eeyore from Winnie-the-Pooh. To prevent Stewie from going to <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Pole</b> he tells him that Santa is not real; Stewie questions this, also asking if Elmo, SpongeBob SquarePants and Curious George aren't real. On their way to <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Pole,</b> Brian and Stewie find themselves in Canada, where they meet {{a man with a}} thick Canadian accent; they also see the Aurora borealis and the Aurora Boreanaz (an aurora with David Boreanaz's face).|$|E
5|$|In November1906 the American Robert Peary {{returned}} from his latest unsuccessful quest for <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Pole,</b> claiming a new Farthest North of 87°6′—a record disputed by later historians. He immediately began raising funds for a further attempt. In July1907 Dr Frederick Cook, a former shipmate of Amundsen's from Belgica, set off northwards on what was ostensibly a hunting trip but was rumoured to be an attempt on <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Pole.</b> A month later Ernest Shackleton's Nimrod Expedition sailed for Antarctica, while Robert Falcon Scott was preparing a further expedition should Shackleton fail. Amundsen {{saw no reason to}} concede priority in the south to the British, and spoke publicly about the prospects of leading an Antarctic expedition—although his preferred goal remained <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Pole.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Geographic <b>North</b> <b>Pole</b> and <b>the</b> Magnetic <b>North</b> <b>Pole</b> are {{not exactly}} the same {{position}} on the earth. From any position on the globe, a direction can be determined to either <b>the</b> geographic <b>north</b> <b>pole</b> or to <b>the</b> magnetic <b>north</b> <b>pole.</b> These directions are expressed in degrees from 0-360, and also fractions of a degree. The difference between these two directions is known as magnetic variation. While a compass is installed in a vehicle or vessel, local anomalies of the vessel can introduce error into the direction that the compass points. The difference between the direction to Magnetic <b>North</b> <b>Pole</b> and <b>the</b> direction that the compass is pointing is known as magnetic deviation.|$|R

5|$|Amundsen's initial plans {{had focused}} on the Arctic and the conquest of <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Pole</b> {{by means of an}} {{extended}} drift in an icebound ship. He obtained the use of Fridtjof Nansen's polar exploration ship Fram, and undertook extensive fundraising. Preparations for this expedition were disrupted when, in 1909, the rival American explorers Frederick Cook and Robert E. Peary each claimed to have reached <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Pole.</b> Amundsen then changed his plan and began to prepare for a conquest of the South Pole; uncertain {{of the extent to which}} the public and his backers would support him, he kept this revised objective secret. When he set out in June1910, he led even his crew to believe they were embarking on an Arctic drift, and revealed their true Antarctic destination only when Fram was leaving their last port of call, Madeira.|$|E

50|$|Magnetic {{variation}} is different {{depending on the}} geographic position on the globe. <b>The</b> Magnetic <b>North</b> <b>Pole</b> is currently in Northern Canada and is moving generally South. A straight line {{can be drawn from}} <b>the</b> Geographic <b>North</b> <b>Pole,</b> down to <b>the</b> Magnetic <b>North</b> <b>Pole</b> and then drawn straight down to the equator. This line is known as the agonic line, and the line is also moving. In the year 1900, the Agonic line passed roughly through Detroit and then was East of Florida. It currently passes roughly west of Chicago, IL, and through New Orleans, LA. If a navigator is located on the agonic line, then Variation is zero. Magnetic <b>North</b> <b>Pole</b> and <b>the</b> Geographic <b>North</b> <b>Pole</b> appear to be directly in line with each other, while the navigator is located on the Agonic line. If a navigator is East of the agonic line, then the {{variation is}} westward. Magnetic North appears slightly west of <b>the</b> Geographic <b>North</b> <b>Pole.</b> If a navigator is West of the Agonic Line, then the Variation is Eastward. <b>The</b> magnetic <b>North</b> <b>Pole</b> appears to <b>the</b> East of <b>the</b> geographic <b>North</b> <b>Pole.</b> <b>The</b> further the navigator is from the agonic line, the greater the variation. The local magnetic variation is indicated on NOAA Nautical Charts {{at the center of the}} compass rose. The Magnetic Variation is indicated along with the year of that Variation. The annual increase or decrease of the Variation is also usually indicated. So that the Variation for the current year can be calculated.|$|R
5|$|In 1827, William Edward Parry led a British Royal Navy {{expedition}} {{with the}} aim {{to be the first}} men to reach <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Pole.</b> In the 50 years following Parry's attempt, the Americans would mount three such expeditions: Elisha Kent Kane in 1853–55, Isaac Israel Hayes in 1860–61, and Charles Francis Hall with the Polaris in 1871–73.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the surface}} of the Earth, its {{magnetic}} field can be closely approximated by the field of a magnetic dipole positioned {{at the center of the}} Earth and tilted at an angle of about 11° with respect to the rotational axis of the Earth. The dipole is roughly equivalent to a powerful bar magnet, with its south pole pointing towards the geomagnetic North Pole. This may seem surprising, but <b>the</b> <b>north</b> <b>pole</b> of a magnet is so defined because, if allowed to rotate freely, it points roughly northward (in the geographic sense). Since <b>the</b> <b>north</b> <b>pole</b> of a magnet attracts the south poles of other magnets and repels the north poles, it must be attracted to the south pole of Earth's magnet. The dipolar field accounts for 80–90% of the field in most locations.|$|E
5|$|The first vortex on Venus was {{discovered}} at <b>the</b> <b>north</b> <b>pole</b> by the Pioneer Venus mission in 1978. A {{discovery of the}} second large 'double-eyed' vortex {{at the south pole}} of Venus was made in the summer of 2006 by Venus Express, which came with no surprise.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> lunar <b>north</b> <b>pole</b> is <b>the</b> northernmost {{point on}} the Moon, lying {{diametrically}} opposite the lunar south pole.

50|$|The flow {{direction}} is detected by a magnetic compass, a needle clamped onto a potentiometer. This design becomes problematic for {{instruments in the}} Arctic Ocean since <b>the</b> <b>North</b> Magnetic <b>Pole</b> moves relative to <b>the</b> geographic <b>North</b> <b>Pole</b> and this (time-depended) magnetic declination cannot be neglected any more.|$|R

In testing, the first Eurostar train ran in St Pancras on 6 March 2007. All CTRL connections are fully grade-separated. This is achieved through use of viaducts, bridges, cuttings and in one case, the tunnel portal itself.|$|E
5|$|The {{outbreak}} of the First World War in 1914 delayed the start of Amundsen's northern polar drift—to which the South Pole expedition had been intended as a preliminary—until July1918. He then set off in a specially-constructed vessel, Maud, which remained in Arctic waters {{for the next seven}} years. The ship did not drift over <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Pole,</b> although {{in the course of the}} expedition it became the second ship to traverse the North-East Passage. Amundsen left the expedition in 1923; the remaining years of his life were largely devoted to polar exploration by air. On 12May 1926, aboard the airship Norge with Lincoln Ellsworth and Umberto Nobile, Amundsen flew over <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Pole.</b> He and Wisting, also on the airship, were the first men to see both poles. In 1928, while attempting to rescue a later Nobile expedition, Amundsen disappeared with his aircraft in the seas between Norway and Spitsbergen.|$|E

40|$|In this {{activity}} students plot the {{latitude and longitude}} involved in the movement of <b>the</b> Magnetic <b>North</b> <b>Pole</b> {{over a period of}} time, predict its location by the year 2000, and justify their reasoning. Students will discover that <b>the</b> Magnetic <b>North</b> <b>Pole</b> has been charted over the past several hundred years and that the pole shifts an average of 15 kilometers/year. They will also learn tha navigation by compass is especially difficult during a magnetic storm. Compass bearings can shift by 10 degrees or more within the course of a few hours, therefore, {{it is important to know}} the pole's present location. During the activity, students will use a formula to calculate the speed of <b>the</b> Magnetic <b>North</b> <b>Pole</b> and will conclude that <b>the</b> Magnetic <b>North</b> <b>Pole</b> moves from year to year.
