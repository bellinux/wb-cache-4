5|$|Anderson {{explained}} that although <b>the</b> <b>title</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> documentary was Fuck, he allowed alternate designations using an asterisk. The film and content he controlled would {{refer to the}} title as Fuck, including theatrical and DVD editions. He concluded that his struggle reflected the debate alluded to by the documentary, and this realization motivated him to stand firm on the film's title. Because the film is about how a taboo word can impact culture, {{it was important to}} keep Fuck as its title.|$|E

5|$|Perhaps the most-quoted anecdote {{concerning}} Hardee was that, on 9 October 1986 {{his house}} was searched by the police – who were looking for crumbs – two days after he and others stole Freddie Mercury's £4,000 40th birthday cake. No crumbs were found at the house as he had already by then donated the cake to a local nursing home. He used this incident as <b>the</b> <b>title</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> 1996 autobiography I Stole Freddie Mercury's Birthday Cake which he wrote with John Fleming. In another encounter with the police, Hardee was once questioned by Special Branch officers after being found on the balcony outside government minister Michael Heseltine's hotel room, wearing nothing but a pair of socks and a leather coat containing £5,200 in cash and a pack of pornographic playing cards.

5|$|Stalin {{took several}} {{measures}} in persecuting the Armenian Church, already {{weakened by the}} Armenian Genocide and the Russification policies of the Russian Empire. In the 1920s, the private property of the church was confiscated and priests were harassed. Soviet assaults against the Armenian Church accelerated under Stalin, beginning in 1929, but momentarily eased in the following years to improve the country's relations with the Armenian diaspora. In 1932, Khoren Muradpekyan became known as Khoren I and assumed <b>the</b> <b>title</b> <b>of</b> <b>His</b> Holiness the Catholicos. However, in the late 1930s, the Soviets renewed their attacks against the Church. This culminated {{in the murder of}} Khoren in 1938 as part of the Great Purge, and the closing of the Catholicosate of Echmiatsin on August 4, 1938. The Church, however, managed to survive underground and in the diaspora.|$|E
