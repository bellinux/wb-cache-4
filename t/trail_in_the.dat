5|$|A service ramp at {{the rear}} of the {{basement}} led to a sliding door that opened into an alley; the police found the door had been tampered with so it could be opened without unlocking it. Later examination found bloody fingerprints on the door, as well as a metal pipe that had been used as a crowbar. Some evidence at the crime scene was improperly handled by the police investigators: a <b>trail</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dirt (from the elevator shaft) along which police believed Phagan had been dragged was trampled; the footprints were never identified.|$|E
5|$|As {{the freeway}} {{continues}} northward, US31 intersects {{the western end}} of M-20 in New Era in Oceana County. The landscape in this area is dominated by forest land as the trunkline crosses the Hart-Montague Trail State Park, a linear state park that follows a bike <b>trail</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area. North of the trail crossing, US31 has a business spur for Hart that runs east into that town; north of this interchange, the freeway crosses the Pentwater River near the community of Pentwater which also has its own business loop.|$|E

5|$|Part of CR112 was {{originally}} {{part of an}} old Indian trail that went from Johnstown to Hamilton County via Bleecker. At some point, part of the <b>trail</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> vicinity of Bleecker was converted into a plank road that served several locations and churches north of Bleecker. Meanwhile, NY309 was assigned {{as part of the}} 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York to a connector highway between the city of Gloversville and the hamlet of Bleecker.|$|E
5|$|Pioneers {{traveling}} in wagon trains on the Oregon <b>Trail</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1850s and 1860s followed an alternative route {{in the area}} that used old Indian trails that skirted the lava flows. This alternative route was later named Goodale's Cutoff and part of it is {{in the northern part of}} the monument. The cutoff was created to reduce the possibility of ambush by Shoshone warriors along the Snake River such as the one that occurred at Massacre Rocks, which today is memorialized in Idaho's Massacre Rocks State Park.|$|E

5|$|Popular {{recreational}} {{activities in the}} Big Butte Creek watershed include hunting, camping, hiking, and horseback riding. Many tourists also come to sight-see. The most heavily used <b>trail</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area is the Blue Canyon Trail, leading to the Sky Lakes Wilderness, and ultimately the larger Pacific Crest Trail. The city of Butte Falls has organized the Butte Falls Discovery Loop Tour, a half-day-long drive through the Rogue River– Siskiyou National Forest. The loop starts in Butte Falls, and has several stops for hiking and viewing the landscape, including Mount McLoughlin.|$|E
5|$|Railroads {{and roads}} in the Sammamish River and Snoqualmie River valleys, where modern-day SR202 runs, were built during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The early roads were {{incorporated}} into the Yellowstone <b>Trail</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1910s and became a state highway in 1925. SR202 was established in 1964 {{as part of a}} new state highway system, running from Woodinville to Monroe; SR522 was designated to the Woodinville–North Bend highway, continuing west to Seattle. By 1970, the designations were reversed, with SR202 moved to the Woodinville–North Bend highway, and SR522 moved to the Bothell–Monroe highway.|$|E
5|$|Stanton and Pike {{stopped to}} rest, and Reed {{returned}} alone to the group, arriving {{four days after}} the party's departure. Without the guide they had been promised, the group had to decide whether to turn back and rejoin the traditional trail, follow the tracks left by the Harlan-Young Party through the difficult terrain of Weber Canyon, or forge their own <b>trail</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> direction that Hastings had recommended. At Reed's urging, the group chose the new Hastings route. Their progress slowed to about {{a mile and a half}} (2.4km) a day, and all the able-bodied men were required to clear brush, fell trees, and heave rocks to make room for the wagons.|$|E

5|$|The Middle or East Plains Trail {{also came}} into common {{use in the}} 1840s. Shorter than the {{competing}} West Plain Trail, it became {{the route of the}} large cart trains originating from Pembina when well-known trader Henry Sibley retired from the fur trade in 1854. His successor and former partner Norman Kittson moved their company's cart trains from the West Plains <b>Trail</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Minnesota River valley to the East Plains route.|$|E
5|$|Historically, Arlington {{developed}} along several railroads {{that have}} since been abandoned or re-purposed. The Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway, which spurred the establishment of Arlington in the 1880s, ran north–south through Arlington on its main line between Snohomish and the Canadian border. In 1892, it was acquired by the Northern Pacific Railway, which was acquired by Burlington Northern in 1970. Burlington Northern abandoned the railroad in 1972, favoring a parallel route to the west through Marysville, and it was converted into the Centennial <b>Trail</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1990s and 2000s. A Northern Pacific branch to Darrington, following the modern-day State Route 530, was built in 1901 and abandoned in 1990; the county government {{plans to use the}} right of way for the Whitehorse Trail, a multi-purpose trail.|$|E
5|$|Meeker {{was born}} in Butler County, Ohio, to Jacob and Phoebe Meeker. His family {{relocated}} to Indiana {{when he was a}} boy. He married Eliza Jane Sumner in 1851; the following year the couple, with Ezra's brother and with their newborn son, set out for the Oregon Territory, where land could be claimed and settled on. Although they endured hardships on the <b>Trail</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> journey of nearly six months, the entire party survived the trek. Meeker and his family briefly stayed near Portland, then journeyed north to live in the Puget Sound region. They settled at what is now Puyallup in 1862, where Meeker grew hops for use in brewing beer. By 1887, his business had made him wealthy, and his wife built a large mansion for the family. In 1891 an infestation of hop aphids destroyed his crops and took much of his fortune. He later tried his hand at a number of ventures, and made four largely unsuccessful trips to the Klondike, taking groceries and hoping to profit from the gold rush.|$|E

5|$|Mount Washington is {{a common}} objective, and is often climbed from Pinkham Notch. There are {{numerous}} trail approaches from the Appalachian Mountain Club's visitor's center. Although trail distances seem short, {{the trip to the}} summit should not be underestimated; most trail approaches involve at least 4,000 vertical feet (1,200m) of climbing, including an ascent of the rocky summit cone and the boulder-strewn upper slopes. Weather changes very quickly, and one must be prepared for extreme conditions. The Tuckerman Ravine Trail is the most popular <b>trail</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> notch, ascending to the summit via the headwall of Tuckerman Ravine. The Huntington Ravine Trail is widely considered the most difficult trail in New Hampshire, making its way up the precipitous headwall of neighboring Huntington Ravine, where there are several rock climbing opportunities.|$|E
5|$|Ranchers grazed {{thousands}} of cattle {{on public land}} that would later {{become part of the}} park, and homesteaders farmed and ranched {{at the base of the}} Rincons, filing homestead applications from the 1890s through 1930. The remains of the former Freeman Homestead, established in 1929, lies along a nature <b>trail</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> RMD. The homestead is on the Arizona State Register of Historic Places. Manning Cabin, built in 1905 as a summer retreat for Levi Manning, a wealthy businessman and one-term mayor of Tucson, is part of the infrastructure at Manning Camp near Mica Mountain. Modified and restored after falling into disrepair, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. Cultural resources in the park include more than 450 archeological sites and more than 60 historic structures.|$|E
5|$|The Sammamish River valley {{was settled}} in the late 19th century and served by the Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railroad, built in 1889 from Bothell to North Bend, {{traveling}} through Redmond, Issaquah, Fall City, and Snoqualmie. By 1902, several wagon roads were built along the railroad, including a road between Fall City and North Bend, which was incorporated into the Sunset Highway when it was designated as a state highway in 1909. The road from Redmond to North Bend {{became part of the}} national Yellowstone <b>Trail</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1910s, including a section near Redmond that was paved with bricks in 1913. A portion of the Yellowstone Trail, along with unpaved roads from Redmond to Bothell, were designated as a state highway in 1925. The highway was paved in the late 1920s, and was incorporated into the Seattle–Fall City branch of the Sunset Highway (Primary State Highway 2) in 1937. After the opening of the North Bend bypass in 1941, the branch highway was extended to North Bend over the former Sunset Highway.|$|E
