5|$|Various {{insects and}} arachnids reside around the Petitcodiac River. Among them is the stonefly, the mayfly, the caddisfly, the simulium, the {{subfamily}} of tanypodinae, and the Hydracarina. Non-native species, such as the black-footed spider, the beech scale, the white-marked <b>tussock</b> <b>moth,</b> and the mountain ash sawfly have also made their home in the Petitcodiac River watershed. At the southern extremities of the watershed, 50 to 90percent of the world's semipalmated sandpipers feed on the mud shrimp at Shepody Bay. Around 269,445 stop there before migrating to South America, a number which accounts for at least 7.7percent of the total population. Among others, the semipalmated plover (around 2percent of the North American population), the short-billed dowitcher, the red knot, the sanderling, and the least sandpiper are also known for migrating through the Important Bird Area.|$|E
25|$|Halysidota tessellaris, {{also called}} the banded <b>tussock</b> <b>moth,</b> {{tessellated}} halisidota, and pale tiger moth, is in Erebidae. Like many related species, it has chemical defenses it acquires from its host plants, in this case, alkaloids (Weller et al., 1999, Hristov and Conner 2005), at least in adults. Larval brazen behaviours suggest that they are chemically protected; {{they have not been}} analyzed for alkaloid content.|$|E
25|$|As predators of invertebrates, {{including}} many pests, most ground beetles are considered beneficial organisms. The caterpillar hunters (Calosoma) {{are famous for}} their habit of devouring prey in quantity, eagerly feeding on <b>tussock</b> <b>moth</b> (Lymantriidae) caterpillars, processionary caterpillars (Thaumetopoeidae) and woolly worms (Arctiidae), which due to their urticating hairs are avoided by most insectivores. Large numbers of the forest caterpillar hunter (C. sycophanta), native to Europe, were shipped to New England for biological control of the gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) as early as 1905.|$|E

2500|$|Lymantria means [...] "defiler", {{and several}} species are {{important}} defoliators of forest trees, including the gypsy moth Lymantria dispar, the douglas-fir <b>tussock</b> <b>moth</b> Orgyia pseudotsugata, and the nun moth Lymantria monacha.

2500|$|Many of its {{component}} {{species are}} referred to as [...] "tussock moths" [...] of one sort or another. The caterpillar, or larval, stage of these species often has a distinctive appearance of alternating bristles and haired projections. Many <b>tussock</b> <b>moth</b> caterpillars have urticating hairs (often hidden among longer, softer hairs), which can cause painful reactions if they come into contact with skin.|$|E
