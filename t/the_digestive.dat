5|$|The stomach in the {{cephalothorax}} {{acts as a}} pump {{that sends}} the food deeper into <b>the</b> <b>digestive</b> system. The mid gut bears many digestive ceca, compartments with no other exit, that extract nutrients from the food; most are in the abdomen, which is dominated by <b>the</b> <b>digestive</b> system, but a few {{are found in the}} cephalothorax.|$|E

5|$|Once {{the food}} is in <b>the</b> <b>digestive</b> cavity, gland cells in the gastroderm release enzymes that reduce the prey to slurry, usually within a few hours. This circulates through <b>the</b> <b>digestive</b> cavity and, in colonial cnidarians, through the {{connecting}} tunnels, so that gastroderm cells can absorb the nutrients. Absorption may take a few hours, and digestion within the cells may take a few days. The circulation of nutrients is driven by water currents produced by cilia in the gastroderm or by muscular movements or both, so that nutrients reach all parts of <b>the</b> <b>digestive</b> cavity. Nutrients reach the outer cell layer by diffusion or, for animals or zooids such as medusae which have thick mesogleas, are transported by mobile cells in the mesoglea.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> Canadian <b>Digestive</b> Health Foundation (French: Fondation Canadienne de la Santé Digestive) or CDHF, is a {{registered}} Canadian charity. The organization was founded in 1995 as <b>the</b> Canadian <b>Digestive</b> Disease Foundation and renamed <b>the</b> Canadian <b>Digestive</b> Health Foundation in 2001. The objectives of the Foundation are to educate the general public about digestive disease and nutrition, and to advance the science of gastroenterology by funding medical research. In February 2001, it was officially endorsed as the Foundation for the Canadian Association of Gastroenterology. Since then it has raised and invested more than $1 million to fund Canadian researchers in <b>the</b> field of <b>digestive</b> health.|$|R
5|$|There are no {{respiratory}} organs, {{and both}} cell layers absorb oxygen from and expel carbon dioxide {{into the surrounding}} water. When the water in <b>the</b> <b>digestive</b> cavity becomes stale it must be replaced, and nutrients {{that have not been}} absorbed will be expelled with it. Some Anthozoa have ciliated grooves on their tentacles, allowing them to pump water out of and into <b>the</b> <b>digestive</b> cavity without opening the mouth. This improves respiration after feeding and allows these animals, which use the cavity as a hydrostatic skeleton, to control the water pressure in the cavity without expelling undigested food.|$|E
5|$|Aloe vera {{juice is}} marketed {{to support the}} health of <b>the</b> <b>digestive</b> system, but there is neither {{scientific}} evidence nor regulatory approval to support this claim.

5|$|Neptunium {{does not}} have a {{biological}} role, as it has a short half-life and occurs only in small traces naturally. Animal tests showed that it is not absorbed via <b>the</b> <b>digestive</b> tract. When injected it concentrates in the bones, from which it is slowly released.|$|E
5|$|One well-understood {{example of}} {{mutualism}} is {{the interaction between}} protozoa and methanogenic archaea in <b>the</b> <b>digestive</b> tracts of animals that digest cellulose, such as ruminants and termites. In these anaerobic environments, protozoa break down plant cellulose to obtain energy. This process releases hydrogen as a waste product, but high levels of hydrogen reduce energy production. When methanogens convert hydrogen to methane, protozoa benefit from more energy.|$|E

5|$|Solutions at {{more than}} 25% acetic acid are handled in a fume hood because of the pungent, {{corrosive}} vapour. Dilute acetic acid, {{in the form of}} vinegar, is practically harmless.

5|$|The Neocallimastigomycota were earlier {{placed in}} the phylum Chytridomycota.

They lack mitochondria but contain hydrogenosomes of mitochondrial origin. As in the related chrytrids, neocallimastigomycetes form zoospores that are posteriorly uniflagellate or polyflagellate.|$|E

5|$|The {{non-magnetic}} {{character of}} zinc and {{its lack of}} color in solution delayed discovery of its importance to biochemistry and nutrition. This changed in 1940 when carbonic anhydrase, an enzyme that scrubs carbon dioxide from blood, was shown to have zinc in its active site. <b>The</b> <b>digestive</b> enzyme carboxypeptidase became the second known zinc-containing enzyme in 1955.|$|E
5|$|A {{quarter of}} all people with Guillain–Barré {{syndrome}} develop weakness of the breathing muscles leading to respiratory failure, the inability to breathe adequately to maintain healthy levels of oxygen and/or {{carbon dioxide in the}} blood. This life-threatening scenario is complicated by other medical problems such as pneumonia, severe infections, blood clots in the lungs and bleeding in <b>the</b> <b>digestive</b> tract in 60% of those who require artificial ventilation.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} function of enzymes is in <b>the</b> <b>digestive</b> systems of animals. Enzymes such as amylases and proteases break down large molecules (starch or proteins, respectively) into smaller ones, {{so they can}} be absorbed by the intestines. Starch molecules, for example, are too large to be absorbed from the intestine, but enzymes hydrolyze the starch chains into smaller molecules such as maltose and eventually glucose, which can then be absorbed. Different enzymes digest different food substances. In ruminants, which have herbivorous diets, microorganisms in the gut produce another enzyme, cellulase, to break down the cellulose cell walls of plant fiber.|$|E

40|$|For many years, it was {{generally}} accepted {{that the vast majority}} of the colorectal carcinomas (CRCs) evolved from conventional adenomas, via the adenoma– carcinoma sequence. More recently, serrated colorectal polyps (hyperplastic polyps, sessile serrated polyps and traditional serrated adenomas (TSAs)) have emerged as an alternative pathway of colorectal carcinogenesis. It has been estimated that about 30 % of the CRC progress via the serrated pathway. Recently, TSAs were also detected in <b>the</b> upper <b>digestive</b> tract. In this work, we review the literature on TSA in the oesophagus, the stomach, the duodenum, the pancreatic main duct and the gallbladder. The review indicated that 53. 4 % (n= 39) out of the 73 TSA of <b>the</b> upper <b>digestive</b> tract now in record showed a simultaneously growing invasive carcinoma. As a corollary, TSAs of <b>the</b> upper <b>digestive</b> tract are aggressive adenomas that should be radically excised, either endoscopically or surgically, to rule out the possibility of a synchronously growing invasive adenocarcinoma or to prevent cancer progression. The present findings substantiate a TSA pathway of carcinogenesis in <b>the</b> upper <b>digestive</b> tract...|$|R

5|$|Bears have {{a fairly}} simple {{digestive}} system typical for carnivorans, with a single stomach, short undifferentiated intestines and no cecum. Even the herbivorous giant panda still has <b>the</b> <b>digestive</b> system of a carnivore, as well as carnivore-specific genes. Its ability to digest cellulose is ascribed to the microbes in its gut. Bears must {{spend much of their}} time feeding in order to gain enough nutrition from foliage. The panda, in particular, spends 12–15 hours a day feeding.|$|E
5|$|Digestive tract telangiectasias may be {{identified}} on esophagogastroduodenoscopy (endoscopy of the esophagus, stomach and {{first part of}} the small intestine). This procedure will typically only be undertaken if there is anemia that is more marked than expected by the severity of nosebleeds, or if there is evidence of severe bleeding (vomiting blood, black stools). If the number of lesions seen on endoscopy is unexpectedly low, the remainder of the small intestine may be examined with capsule endoscopy, in which the patient swallows a capsule-shaped device containing a miniature camera which transmits images of <b>the</b> <b>digestive</b> tract to a portable digital recorder.|$|E
