The weakened Steven falls back into the water, and Mike plunges in the water to rescue him. Mike helps Steven to reach the river bank, but Steven's legs are broken, so Mike carries him through the jungle to friendly lines.

Nyan Shein offers a sad {{picture of him}} in his last years, visiting artists, clutching a book by J. J. Hilder in his hands. It is said that during these last years, he lived with Saya Saung and that two of his other students, Saya Mya and Hein Soon, also helped <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> Nyan Shein gives Ba Zaw’s date of death as 1943, but Amar claims that her husband found Ba Zaw’s obituary in the newspaper and that he died on 11 December 1942.|$|E
25|$|In Sophocles' Oedipus at Colonus, Oedipus {{becomes a}} wanderer, pursued by Creon and his men. He finally finds refuge at the holy {{wilderness}} right outside Athens, {{where it is}} said that Theseus took care of Oedipus and his daughter, Antigone. Creon eventually catches up to Oedipus. He asks Oedipus to come back from Colonus to bless his son, Eteocles. Angry that his son did not love him enough <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>him,</b> he curses both Eteocles and his brother, condemning them both to kill each other in battle. Oedipus dies a peaceful death; his grave is said to be sacred to the gods.|$|E

25|$|Arthur Huntingdon, Helen's abusive and {{alcoholic}} husband, is a Byronic {{figure of}} great fascination {{but also of}} barely concealed moral failings. His abusive behaviour impels Helen {{to run away from}} him, but nevertheless when he becomes ill (after falling from his horse when drunk and injuring his leg badly), Helen returns to Grassdale <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> Unwilling to stop drinking alcohol, Huntingdon deteriorates in health and eventually dies. He is widely thought to be loosely based on the author's brother, Branwell, but some critics have argued that, apart from their masses of red hair, they have little in common. Along with Lord Lowborough, Huntingdon bears far stronger resemblance to two types of drunkards outlined in Robert Macnish's The Anatomy of Drunkenness.|$|E
25|$|Emily is {{donating}} eggs to pay {{for school}} and loses her eggs when the clinic encounters a minor shutdown of its freezers; Aria gets burned by a fire caused by a malfunction at Hanna's bridal shower; and Alison falls {{down a flight of}} stairs. The girls build a plan of attack, which offers Hanna as bait. After Ali sees what appears to be her dead mother and Detective Wilden, she starts to question her sanity and checks herself into the same hospital Charlotte attended. Spencer, Toby and Mona work together to catch Sara, but instead they find old medical records for a woman named Mary Drake, and {{she was the one who}} gave birth to Charles while a patient at the Radley (now a hotel managed by Ashley Marin) 25 years ago, the DiLaurentis family adopted Charles as she was unable <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
25|$|Hagrid {{is absent}} {{during the first}} part of the fifth novel. The {{character}} later reveals to Harry, Ron and Hermione that he and Madame Maxime travelled across Europe together on a mission from the Order, planning to find giants and convince them to ally themselves with the good side and with Dumbledore; however, Death Eaters also find the giants and managed to get them to Voldemort’s side. Hagrid is attacked by giants during the mission, and saved by Maxime. Hagrid and Maxime eventually part on the journey home because of Maxime’s exasperation with Grawp, Hagrid’s half-brother whom he had found and was attempting to bring home with them. Grawp, who wanted to stay with the giants, seriously injured Hagrid. Hagrid introduces his half-brother to Harry and Hermione, and asks them <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> after he leaves Hogwarts. High Inquisitor of Hogwarts Dolores Umbridge supervises the classes of all the members of the Hogwarts staff, including Hagrid's, and she looks for an excuse to fire him, as Hagrid is close to Dumbledore. Towards the end of the book, Umbridge and other Ministry officials attempt to arrest Hagrid. The latter manages to escape, but Professor McGonagall is injured whilst trying to defend him. Finally, with Dumbledore’s post as Headmaster restored, Hagrid returns to Hogwarts.|$|E

500|$|In Manadhai Thirudivittai (2001), Valayapathi (Vivek) {{pretends to}} have lost both his hands. His lover then {{promises}} <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> The song [...] "Kanne Kalaimane" [...] is heard as the background music for the scene. In a comedy scene from Run (2002), Mohan (Vivek) imitates Haasan's mannerisms from the climax scene in Moondram Pirai to make his friend Shiva (R. Madhavan) recognise him but fails. In a similar scene from the Malayalam film Kochi Rajavu (2005), Harisree Ashokan's character uses the same mannerisms to make Dileep's character recognise him.|$|E
500|$|... "Circle the Drain" [...] is a rant song where, lyrically, Perry {{is telling}} off a self-destructive drug-addicted ex-boyfriend. Its candid lyrics also discuss the strains his {{addiction}} put {{on both of}} them. In the track's chorus, she sings about how {{she wants to be}} his lover, not someone who has <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>him,</b> such as a maternal figure. She also sings about how he had ultimately lost large opportunities. Styled in the genres of disco-rock, and gothic rock tones, it is an up-tempo song that lasts for fourminutes and 32 seconds, and also has influences of techno. The track is composed in the key of E minor and is set in time signature of common time, with a tempo of 135 beats per minute. Perry's vocal range spans over an octave, from A3 to D5.|$|E

These six mothers all want <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> and nurse baby Kartikkeya. They argue. Baby Kartikkeya ends the argument by growing five more heads to have a total of six heads so he can look at all six moms, and let them each nurse one.|$|E

[...] On July 4, 1877, he had a disagreement with gambler Henry Kahn, and Holliday beat him repeatedly with his walking stick. Both men were arrested and fined, but Kahn was not finished. Later that same day, he shot and seriously wounded the unarmed Holliday. On July 7, the Dallas Weekly Herald incorrectly reported that Holliday had been killed.

The Royal Navy, always {{concerned about the}} possibility of mutiny, had a formal procedure for the removal of commanding officers for insanity. Admiral Dixon came on board Nancy, together with the chief and assistant surgeons from Montagu, and they examined Killwick. Then Dixon, the surgeons, D'Aranda, and Nancys Assistant Surgeon all signed a Survey, a document attesting to their willingness to swear under oath that they had impartially assessed Killwick and found him unfit to command. Killwick then was taken to Montagu. The next month Dixon sent Killwick aboard a merchant vessel bound for London, together with two marines from Nancy <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> Dixon then confirmed D'Aranda as Nancys captain.|$|E

2500|$|Following the reception, Elvis and Priscilla {{boarded a}} private jet and enjoyed a short honeymoon in Palm Springs. On May 4, they flew back to Memphis and retreated to their private ranch, just over the Mississippi state line, for a three-week break. Many of Elvis' inner circle joined them, {{although}} {{for the most part}} the couple were left alone and were able to enjoy each other's company without the intrusion of the Memphis Mafia. Priscilla reveled in her chance to be a proper wife; cooking, cleaning, and washing for her husband. [...] "I loved playing house" [...] she later remarked, adding [...] "Here was an opportunity <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> myself. No maids or housekeepers to pamper us."

Once there, Brkich won her first individual Immunity challenge, and she and Mariano convinced Lewis to vote out Boneham instead of forcing a tie. In the final three, Mariano won immunity and chose Brkich to continue with him to the Final Two. Facing the jury, they both met criticism for their gameplay. Ultimately, Brkich was victorious by becoming the Sole Survivor in a 4–3 vote, securing her the winner by receiving votes from van den Berghe, Calaway, Huang, and Buchanan while Mariano received votes from Vavrick-O'Brien, Boneham and Lewis. Before the vote was read, Mariano proposed to Brkich, which she accepted without hesitation.|$|E

Rumplestiltskin gives David an antidote for his dreamshade poisoning, which successfully cures him. After Emma believes that Henry is not himself, she demands that Gold opens Pandora's Box to confront [...] "Pan". After sharing intimate details of their relationship, Henry is welcomed by his family once more, while Pan steals Regina's original curse, using Felix's heart to enact it. The residents prepare to fight back; Tinker Bell successfully destroys Pan's shadow, reviving Mother Superior, who gives them the Black Fairy's wand to return Pan and Henry to their correct bodies. Regina falls unconscious upon touching the curse's scroll and seeing {{what needs to be}} done. Pan awakens and removes Rumplestiltskin's magic, seeking out the town's residents to kill them.
