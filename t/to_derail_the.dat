Quinn is responding to Rachel's text when a truck crashes into the driver's side of her car.|$|E
5|$|In 1963, President Kennedy asked MacArthur to help mediate {{a dispute}} between the National Collegiate Athletic Association and the Amateur Athletic Union over control of amateur sports in the country. The dispute {{threatened}} <b>to</b> <b>derail</b> <b>the</b> participation of the United States in the 1964 Summer Olympics. His presence helped to broker a deal, and participation in the games went on as planned.|$|E
5|$|Russian {{secret service}} {{defector}} Alexander Litvinenko accused the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation of having organised the Armenian parliament shooting, ostensibly <b>to</b> <b>derail</b> <b>the</b> peace process, {{which would have}} resolved the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, but he offered {{no evidence to support}} the accusation. Russian and Armenian officials denied this claims.|$|E

5|$|Emboldened by his success, Diệm {{began to}} plot Bảo Đại's downfall. He {{scheduled}} a referendum for 23 October 1955 and pushed Bảo Đại {{out of the}} political scene, hindering the former emperor's attempts <b>to</b> <b>derail</b> <b>the</b> poll. In the period {{leading up to the}} vote, campaigning for Bảo Đại was banned, while Diệm's election campaign focused on personal attacks against Bảo Đại. These included pornographic cartoons of the head of state and unverified rumours claiming he was illegitimate and linking him to various mistresses. The government-controlled media launched polemical attacks on Bảo Đại, and police went door-to-door, warning people of the consequences of failing to vote. After his brother Ngô Đình Nhu successfully rigged the poll, Diệm proclaimed himself president of the newly created Republic of Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|In 1918, Rosenthal {{was forced}} out by Dey in a complex scheme. Dey was negotiating, as owner of The Arena, with both Rosenthal {{on behalf of the}} Senators and Percy Quinn (who held an option to {{purchase}} the Quebec NHA club) on behalf of a proposed new professional league over exclusive rights to the Arena for professional hockey. In a plan <b>to</b> <b>derail</b> <b>the</b> proposed new league, Dey maintained publicly that he had reserved the Arena for Quinn's proposed league when, in fact, he had not cashed a cheque received from Quinn to reserve an option on the Arena. Rosenthal, believing the club could no longer play at the Arena, attempted to find alternate arrangements for the club, including refurbishing Aberdeen Pavilion, but was unsuccessful. Dey purchased Rosenthal's share of the club on October 28, 1918, and Rosenthal resigned from the club. Quinn filed a lawsuit against Dey for his deception but it was dismissed. Quinn would get further action from the NHL, as the NHL suspended Quinn's franchise and took over its players' contracts.|$|E
5|$|Japan's {{attack on}} Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941 {{threatened}} <b>to</b> <b>derail</b> <b>the</b> 1942 season, but most college teams played on, adjusting schedules to include military teams composed of players {{serving in the}} military. The Buckeyes opened the season by beating a Fort Knox team 59–0, followed by two more wins against Southern California and Indiana University. In the first AP Poll of the season, Ohio State was ranked best in the nation, {{the first time the}} school had achieved that mark. The 1942 team was the first composed mainly of players hand-picked by Brown, including Bill Willis, Dante Lavelli and star halfback Les Horvath. In the middle of the season, the Buckeyes lost to the University of Wisconsin after numerous players drank bad water and got sick. That was the team's only loss of the season, which culminated with a 21–7 victory over Michigan. The Buckeyes won the Western Conference and claimed their first-ever national title after finishing the season {{at the top of the}} AP Poll.|$|E

50|$|The {{cause of}} the {{collision}} was the failure of an axle {{on one of the}} tanker wagons of the freight train. It caused the wagon and adjacent ones <b>to</b> <b>derail,</b> into <b>the</b> path of the closely approaching mail train, which was travelling at 60 mph.|$|R
50|$|On 12 August 1893, {{a defect}} on a {{locomotive}} caused a passenger train <b>to</b> <b>derail</b> at Treforest, Llantrisant Junction. Thirteen {{people were killed}} and twelve were injured. The 3.50 p.m. train from Merthyr <b>to</b> Cardiff <b>derailed.</b> <b>The</b> train was conveying through coaches from Aberystwyth. A pin forming part of the suspension of the locomotive fractured and the locomotive collapsed, and six passenger vehicles ran down the embankment and were smashed.|$|R
5|$|Although Democratic-Republicans held {{a narrow}} {{majority}} in the Senate, the Federalist senators were both experienced and devoted their cause. Breckinridge acted as floor leader for the Democratic-Republicans and newly elected president, Thomas Jefferson. His proposed repeal of the Federalist-supported Judicial Act of 1801, which had {{increased the number of}} federal courts and judges, was particularly controversial. On January 4, 1802, he presented caseload data to argue that the new courts and judges were unnecessary. Federalist leader Gouverneur Morris countered that the proposal was unconstitutional; once established, courts were inviolate, he maintained. On January 20, Federalist Jonathan Dayton moved to return the bill to a committee to consider amendments. South Carolina's John E. Colhoun, a Democratic-Republican, voted with the Federalists, and the result was a 15–15 tie. Empowered to break the tie, Jefferson's vice president, Aaron Burr, voted with the Federalists. The five-man committee consisted of three Federalists, enough to prevent the bill's return to the floor, but when Vermont Senator Stephen R. Bradley, who had traveled home because of a family illness, returned to the chamber, the Democratic-Republicans regained a majority and introduced a successful discharge petition. In one last attempt <b>to</b> <b>derail</b> <b>the</b> legislation in debate, Federalists argued that the judiciary would strike down the repeal as unconstitutional; Breckinridge denied the notion that the courts had the power to invalidate an act of Congress. On February 3, the Senate repealed the act by a vote of 16–15, with the House concurring a month later.|$|E
5|$|The bill's passage was {{met with}} concern by Catholic authorities, {{including}} Pope John Paul II — who warned of a weakening of family values — and his successor Pope Benedict XVI. Cardinal López Trujillo, president of the Pontifical Council for the Family, said the Church was making an urgent call for freedom of conscience for Catholics and appealing to them to resist the law. He said every profession linked with implementing same-sex marriages should oppose it, {{even if it meant}} losing their jobs. Gay rights supporters argued that while the Catholic Church also formally opposed opposite-sex, non-religious marriage, its opposition was not as vocal; for example, the Church did not object to the marriage of Prince Felipe to Letizia Ortiz, who had divorced from a previous civil marriage. The church was unable to gather enough support <b>to</b> <b>derail</b> <b>the</b> bill, even though 80% of Spaniards identify as members of the Catholic Faith. Sociologists believe {{this may be due to}} the significant increase of liberalism in the realm of individual rights in recent years, where the Church traditionally had most influence, especially on family issues. A poll showed that three quarters of Spaniards believe the church hierarchy is out of touch with social reality. A complementary explanation might be that the Church's influence on Spaniards declined after the death in 1975 of the dictator General Francisco Franco, whose regime was closely linked to the Church.|$|E

25|$|A Cintra–Macquarie {{joint venture}} assumed {{operation}} of the Toll Road from INDOT on June 30, 2006, after the Indiana Supreme Court dismissed a legal challenge by opponents attempting <b>to</b> <b>derail</b> <b>the</b> deal following {{the failure of the}} opponents to post a bond.

The operator of the road filed for bankruptcy in September 2014, citing lower than projected traffic volumes and revenues.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the lack}} of {{tangible}} success the raid was not a complete failure. The appearance of the commandos forced the Germans to divert {{the main part of}} an armoured brigade from Sollum, in order to defend against further raids. Although there were still some elements of operational art that had to be refined, the raid demonstrated the strategic value that the commandos might have had within the theatre, if strategic imperatives and resource constraints had not served <b>to</b> <b>derail</b> <b>the</b> concept.|$|E
