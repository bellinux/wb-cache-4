5|$|Though Rosolie {{stated that}} the special was {{intended}} {{to draw attention to}} wildlife conservation and the destruction of the Amazon, the special was condemned prior to its premiere by critics and the animal rights group PETA as an inhumane publicity stunt oriented towards shock value, resulting in calls for Discovery Channel <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> special.|$|E
5|$|Even though Thiệu {{used the}} defeat of the South Vietnamese forces as a {{justification}} for the arrest of those generals, his real intention behind the arrests was to avert an imaginary military coup against him. For that reason, he chose <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> Airborne Division back to III Corps, which was commanded by loyalist officers, instead of the Marine Corps Division.|$|E

Henry agrees, but is unable <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> trigger; instead, he offers money for someone to stay with Glass. When the only volunteers are Hawk and the young Jim Bridger, Fitzgerald agrees to stay for money, to recoup his losses from the {{abandoned}} pelts.|$|E

The first written description of the rope dart is dated from the Tang Dynasty (618 – 907 AD).|$|E
5|$|The Haunted Mask is the {{eleventh}} book in Goosebumps, {{the series of}} children's horror fiction novels created and authored by R. L. Stine. The book follows Carly Beth, a girl who buys a Halloween mask from a store. After putting on the mask, she starts acting differently and discovers that the mask has become her face; she is unable <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> mask off. R. L. Stine says he {{got the idea for}} the book from his son who was wearing a mask he had trouble getting off.|$|E

5|$|The track {{had been}} patched up {{prior to the}} weekend's racing using a {{synthetic}} rubber compound, and it had remained secure throughout the practice and qualifying sessions, {{as well as the}} Grand-Am and Indy Lights races. However, the Dallara DW12's aerodynamic ground force effects acted <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> compound out. After assessing the track conditions, {{the decision was made to}} attempt to repair the track and restart the race. Marshalls and track workers started <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> loose strips up from the track, and a quick drying concrete was used to fill the troughs. The repairs were held up for a short time when a crew was despatched to collect more of the concrete, as the on-site resources had been used up, but eventually the race director was happy the race could restart. Kanaan and Power drove around to survey the repairs, acting as driver representatives, and although Kanaan particularly did not sound confident that they would hold up, they agreed to try and continue racing. There was some confusion about the rules of the restart; no repairs were allowed, and the teams could change tires, but had to remain on the same compound. This led to J.R. Hildebrand suffering a one lap penalty as his car required repair work, and a number of drivers being angered at having to stay on the harder tires, which were the slower compound.|$|E
5|$|After Reggie catches Delsin vandalizing a billboard, their {{subsequent}} argument is interrupted when a military truck carrying three Conduit prisoners crashes on the Akomish reservation. Two of the Conduits escape, but Delsin manages <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> third one, Hank, {{out of the}} wreckage, and inadvertently absorb his smoke powers. Shocked and frightened, Delsin pursues Hank {{in an effort to}} figure out what has happened and how to control his powers. However, they are both cornered by Brooke Augustine. She encases Hank in concrete and questions Delsin, suspecting him of hiding something. Delsin can choose to either tell Augustine the truth about his powers or reveal nothing. Regardless, Augustine renders him unconscious before moving on to the other tribe members.|$|E
5|$|Doggett {{returns to}} the X-Files office, where, to his surprise, he meets The Lone Gunmen. They {{tell him about the}} history of the third eye. While coming to the same conclusion, they are {{convinced}} that Tipet is projecting himself into people's dreams and killing them there. Returning to the warehouse where they found Bormanis, Skinner and Doggett meet Tipet, who is trying to take his own life by pushing his head through a table saw. They rush him to the hospital, where Doggett by surprise finds Scully's name on the register. With Tipet in a coma, Kersh decides <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> plug on the case, saying they've found the main suspect. But Doggett and Skinner are not satisfied, saying there are no explanations for the various murders and events surrounding the case.|$|E

5|$|In {{preparation}} for the fleet's approach to Quebec, James Cook surveyed {{a large portion of}} the river, including a dangerous channel known as The Traverse. Cook's ship was one of the first ships up the river, sounding the channel and guiding the fleet as it moved up, eventually landing Wolfe and his men on the Île d'Orléans on 28 June. The French attempted to attack the fleet by sending seven fire ships downriver to disrupt the landing, but the ships fired too early and British sailors in longboats were able <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> flaming craft clear of the fleet.|$|E
5|$|Many {{basketball}} commentators picked UTEP <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> upset, and {{at halftime}} {{it looked like}} they might be right, as UTEP led 33–27. Stevens {{made a number of}} halftime adjustments, and the Bulldogs came out firing on all cylinders in the second half. The team dominated the second half and won the game 77–59. Butler next faced off with thirteenth seeded Murray State. The game was close throughout, but Butler emerged victorious 54–52 when Hayward deflected a Murray State pass into the back court with less than five seconds on the clock. The win gave Stevens the first Sweet Sixteen appearance of his career.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{critically}} acclaimed bootlegs from the 1980s is The Black Album by Prince. The album {{was to have been}} a conventional major-label release in late 1987, but on 1 December, immediately before release, Prince decided <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> album, requiring 500,000 copies to be destroyed. A few advance copies had already shipped, which were used to create bootlegs. This eventually led to the album's official release. Towards the end of the 1980s, the Ultra Rare Trax series of bootlegs, featuring studio outtakes of the Beatles, showed that digital remastering onto compact disc could produce a high-quality product that was comparable with official studio releases.|$|E

5|$|The VP {{update of}} 1991 {{featured}} cosmetic changes and mechanical however most were not visible {{unless you were}} <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> motor down; and a very similar revised 3.8-litre V6 and 5.0-litre V8 engines from the VN were carried over. The 2.0-litre straight-four engine previously available in New Zealand was discontinued. Exterior cosmetic changes included a translucent acrylic grille on the base level Executive and Berlina, with a colour-coded grille for the S and SS, and a chrome grille for Calais. Updated tail lights and boot garnishes were {{also a part of}} the changes, which were different for each model, with the Berlina having grey stripes and the Calais chrome stripes. Semi-trailing arm independent rear suspension became standard on the Calais and SS, but was made an option on lower-end models in lieu of the live rear axle, improving ride and handling.|$|E
5|$|The castle was {{purchased}} from the Wollaston family in 1788 by Clement Winstanley. In 1790, {{the remains of}} the north tower were still standing, albeit in very poor condition. Clement Winstanley reportedly wanted <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> northern ruins down, intending to reuse the bricks to make a barn, but his son, also called Clement, intervened, and subsequently carried out repairs to the castle. By the 19th century the ruins were covered in ivy; by the early 20th century, trees were growing out of the tops of the walls, which were frequented by grazing goats and cattle. Much of the moat had silted up and {{the remains of the}} bridge had been buried by the accumulated debris.|$|E
5|$|The fan crest {{was later}} {{developed}} by cutting out the figure displayed on it, {{to form a}} metal outline; this evolved in the late 13th and early 14th centuries into a three-dimensional sculpture. These were usually made of cloth, leather or paper over a wooden or wire framework, and were typically {{in the form of}} an animal; also popular were wings, horns, human figures, and panaches of feathers. These were probably worn only in tournaments, not battle: not only did they add to the already considerable weight of the helm, they could also have been used by opponents as a handle <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> wearer's head down.|$|E
