40|$|Pityriasis capitis is {{a common}} scalp {{disorder}} caused by a fungus Malassezia globosa. The mechanism of Pityriasis capitis includes Malassezia-induced fatty acid metabolism, particularly lipase-mediated breakdown of sebaceous lipids and release of irritating free fatty acids. We report that extracellular lipase activity was detected in Malassezia globosa. The presence of lipase enzyme was performed in specific media on Petri dishes for formation of a zone. In this article, the effect of Cymbopogon citratus and Zingiber officinale essential oils on the extracellular lipase activity of Malassezia globosa had been studied by <b>titrametric</b> <b>method.</b> At the end of titration 4 µmol fatty acid/ml of reaction mixture was released {{in the presence of}} Cymbopogon citratus oil and 7 µmol of fatty acid/ml of reaction mixture was liberated in the presence of Zingiber officinale oil. It was found that both essential oils strongly inhibit the lipase activity of M. globosa at a lower concentration...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Three Species {{of local}} palm oil (Elaeis guineensis) were {{harvested}} {{and some of}} their physio-chemical and dietary metal components were analyzed using standard test methods such as Spectrophotometry, Titrametry and Gravimetry. The three species of E. guineensis studied were Elaeis pisifera, Elaeis dura and Elaeis tenera. Determination of the antioxidants as total carotenoids (Vitamin A) and Vitamin E showed that Vitamin A content in E. pisifera, E. dura and E. tenera were 8677. 17, 8927. 65 and 880. 80 ug/g respectively, while Vitamin E obtained for the species were 476. 88, 443. 52 and 181. 92 mg/ 100 g for Pisifera, Dura and Tenera species respectively. The protein content in the three species (with proximate) also gave 2. 21, 2. 30 and 2. 70 % for Pisifera, Dura and Tenera respectively while the iodine values which were determined using Wijis method gave results to be 44. 38, 46. 93 and 44. 05 for Pisifera, Dura and Tenera in that order. The acid value and the saponification values were determined (by <b>titrametric</b> <b>method)</b> in the three species which gave acid value results to be 0. 65, 0. 67 and 0. 57 mgkOH/g for Pisifera, Dura and Tenera respectively while the saponification values where 191. 45, 185. 77 and 188. 48 mgKoH/g for Pisifera, Dura and Tenera in that order. Also the percentage moisture content gave 0. 05, 0. 04 and 0. 05 for the three species in same order above.

40|$|Laser-Raman light {{scattering}} {{is a technique}} for determining sulfate concentrations in sea and estuarine waters with apparently none of the interferences inherent in the gravimetric and <b>titrametric</b> <b>methods.</b> The Raman measurement involved the ratioing of the peak heights of an unknown sulfate concentration and a nitrate internal standard.

At the 99. 7 % confidence level, the accuracy of the Raman technique was 7 to 8. 6 percent over the concentration range of the standard curve. The sulfate analyses of water samples collected {{at the mouth of the}} James River, Hampton, Virginia, demonstrated that in most cases sulfate had a constant concentration relative to salinity in this area...|$|R
30|$|The {{collected}} {{samples were}} analyzed for the parameters, viz., As, Fe, Mn, Ca, Na, K, Mg, pH and SO 4 2 − following standard methods (APHA 1998). pH {{of the samples}} was measured {{at the site of}} collection using the pH meter (Merck, India), previously standardized by pH 4, 7, and 9 standard buffer solutions (procured from Merck, India). The instruments were calibrated and standardized before carrying out the analysis. Na and K in the water samples were determined by a flame photometer (Systronics, Germany), whereas TH, Ca, and Mg were determined by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid <b>titrametric</b> <b>methods.</b> SO 4 2 − content present in the water samples were analyzed turbidimetrically at 450  nm using a UV–spectrophotometer. Hydride generation-atomic absorption spectrometry (HG-AAS; Varian 220,USA) was used for analysis of As in water samples (detection limit 0.001  mg/L). The results were further verified for accuracy by analyzing a few random samples in the ICP-MS. The data were subjected to Pearson correlation and cluster analysis using SPSS (Ver. 14.0). Cluster analysis was done by applying average linkage (between groups) and Pearson correlation method (hierarchical clustering), which was used as the measure of similarity. Before analyzing for clusters, the data were subjected to Pearson correlation between different water quality parameters of the study site.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1974 A new, {{computer}} oriented {{system for}} automatic, in situ monitoring of water quality is proposed which makes full and {{effective use of}} modern computer technology. The main objective of this thesis work was {{the development of the}} concept for in situ computer controlled experimenting as a reasonable and effective means of automatically observing the wide range of aquatic parameters needed. The established capability in the teleprocessing industry is assumed as starting point and an optimal design is sought for a sensing head which would meet current expression of requirements for automated water quality monitors while exploiting the advantages of both hardware and software in a total system context. A working model of such a sensing head was constructed and operationally tested using an EAI 690 hybrid computer to simulate the central computer and telecommunications facility. This sensing head consisted of a peristaltic pump, a servo positioned valve, an array of six electrodes (2 glass pH, 3 silver-silver chloride and 1 gold microelectrode) and a thermistor, along with buffer amplifiers and motor controllers to service these devices. A main feature is its design as a remote, computer periferal, like a teletype, which understands up to 64 different commands and which returns coded responses. A second feature is its in situ design making the entire sensor head submersible and operable in depths to 100 meters. A repertoire of programmed experiments was developed for the working model system to show how, for example, it could monitor the water quality parameters; temperature, pH, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, chloride ion, total carbon dioxide, total alkalinity, and a factor called "other ions". The last three in the list being derived from a novel <b>titrametric</b> <b>method,</b> that could be implemented in the particular set of devices in the model sensing head. Concepts of autovarification and autocalibration are introduced and applied with some success. Examples of data (taken at 1 / 2 meter or 100 meter submergence) for known test solutions and local river water are presented and discussed. It is concluded that the proposed concept is both practical and feasible, having an almost open ended potential to monitor parameters for which sensors per se are not now available, and to do this with high levels of confirmed data return...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{determine}} the effects of denervation of the pulp organs of teeth, particularly on the odontoblasts and their processes. Therefore, resection of the inferior alveolar, cervical sympathetic, or a combination of both types of nerves supplying the mandibular incisor teeth of New Zealand white rabbits was performed and the results compared to adjacent, unaltered teeth. Neural stains were used to evaluate the presence or absence of nerve elements, while histochemical and <b>titrametric</b> <b>methods</b> were employed to determine the presence, location and concentration of cholinesterase enzymes in these teeth. Dilation of blood vessels was noted after cervical sympathetic resection and larger nerve trunks as well as peripherally located fine fibers were absent in the pulps following inferior alveolar nerve resection. Further, irregular dentin formation and associated small openings in the tips of the teeth were observed after nerve resection. Titrametric analysis indicated a significant decrease in the concentration of cholinesterase in the pulp organ of incisors 15 – 19 days after resection of either the inferior alveolar nerve or both inferior alveolar and cervical sympathetic nerves. Only a slight decrease in the concentration of cholinesterase was noted after removal of the cervical sympathetic nerve alone. Histochemical results confirmed a decrease in cholinesterase after resection of the inferior alveolar, cervical sympathetic or both nerves. The concentration of the oxidative enzyme, succinic dehydrogenase, however, increased after all three types of nerve resection. This increase was apparent particularly in the odontoblastic cells underlying the predentin...|$|R
