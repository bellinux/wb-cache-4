5|$|Lord Runciman {{continued}} his work, attempting {{to pressure the}} Czechoslovak government into concessions. On 7 September there was an altercation involving Sudeten members of the Czechoslovak parliament in the North Moravian city of Ostrava (Mährisch-Ostrau in German). The Germans made considerable propaganda out of the incident, though the Prague government tried to conciliate them by dismissing Czech police who had been involved. As the tempest grew, Runciman concluded that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>point</b> in attempting further negotiations until after Hitler's speech. The mission never resumed.|$|E
5|$|This work {{led to an}} {{interesting}} discovery. When an engine was optimized specifically for high speed, it burned perhaps twice as much fuel at that speed than when it was running at subsonic speeds. However, the aircraft would be flying as much as four times as fast. Thus its most economical cruise speed, in terms of fuel per mile, was its maximum speed. This was entirely unexpected and implied that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>point</b> in the dash concept; if the aircraft was able to reach Mach3, it may as well fly its entire mission at that speed. The question remained whether such a concept was technically feasible, but by March1957, engine development and wind tunnel testing had progressed enough to suggest it was.|$|E

5|$|At the {{invitation}} of {{the director of the}} Manhattan Project, Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, Jr, Bohr visited the Manhattan Project sites in November 1943. Groves offered Bohr substantial pay, but Bohr initially refused the offer because {{he wanted to make sure}} that the relationship between the United States and Great Britain remained a real cooperative partnership. In December 1943, after a meeting with Albert Einstein, Bohr and his son Aage committed to working on the Manhattan Project. Bohr made a substantial contribution to the atomic bomb development effort. He also attempted to prevent an atomic arms race with the Soviet Union after the war, which he believed to be a serious threat. In 1944, Bohr made several key points he believed to be essential towards international nuclear weapon control. He urged that Britain and the United States should inform the Soviet Union about the Manhattan Project in order to decrease the likelihood of it feeling threatened on the premise that the other nations were building a bomb behind their back. His beliefs stemmed from the fact that he was convinced the Russians already knew about the Manhattan Project, which therefore led him to believe that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>point</b> in hiding it from them.|$|E

25|$|Given the {{disagreements}} {{about the}} structure of the insect head, on which most effort has been spent, {{it is no surprise that}} the potential homologies between it and other arthropods, notably the chelicerates, are also very controversial. From after the second world war to the 1980s a commonly accepted model of arthropod evolution was that the extant euarthropods were polyphyletic, i.e. the main lineages had evolved independently from soft-bodied, annelid-like ancestors, following the work of Tiegs and especially Sidnie Manton. In this view, most of the head structures would also be convergent, and thus <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>point</b> looking for specific homologies between major groups. However, the monophyletic theory of arthropod origins has since decisively gained the upper hand, which raises the problem of head homology once more.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} year of the IBMXF World Championship in 1982 after having your {{standard}} racers to decide the World Champions in the various Classes, both Amateur and Professional, an overall World Champion was decided by racing all of the class winners including the Pro Champion and Amateur champion in a single race called the Trophy Dash. In 1982, Greg Hill, the professional World Champion refused to race the Amateur World Champion the American Nelson Chanady, claiming that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>point</b> to it. Nelson Chanady raced and won the Trophy Dash without Hill's participation, capturing the Overall title. However, since Mr. Hill did not race, the World Championship title lost a considerable amount of luster, since American professional racers were regarded collectively as the best in the world with Mr. Hill being among the best of them. Because of this lost of stature due to Mr. Hill not racing that final race in 1982, the Trophy Dash to determine the World Champion was abolished and in 1983 when the American professional Clint Miller won the World Professional Championship he was also considered the overall World Champion.|$|E

Mason writes that support and apologies for absence were sent by writers Jerome K. Jerome, Thomas Hardy and Rudyard Kipling. Coleridge accused the scientists of torture: [...] "If this is not torture, let Mr. Bayliss and his friends... tell us in Heaven's name what torture is.|$|E
500|$|Farther out, {{the other}} {{eighteen}} lifeboats– {{most of which}} had empty seats– drifted as the occupants debated what, if anything, they should do to rescue the swimmers. No.4 boat, having remained near the sinking ship, {{seems to have been}} closest {{to the site of the}} sinking at around [...] away; this had enabled two people to drop into the boat and another to be picked up from the water before the ship sank. After the sinking, seven more men were pulled from the water, though two later died. Collapsible D rescued one male passenger who jumped in the water and swam over to the boat immediately after it had been lowered. In all the other boats, the occupants eventually decided against returning, probably out of fear that they would be capsized in the attempt. Some put their objections more bluntly; Quartermaster Hichens, commanding lifeboat No.6, told the women aboard his boat that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>point</b> returning as there were [...] "only a lot of stiffs there." ...|$|E

[...] Bannister pronounced Hendrix dead at 12:45p.m., on Friday, September 18, 1970; he was 27 years old. He later stated: [...] "On admission he was obviously dead. He had no pulse, no heartbeat, and the attempt to resuscitate him was merely a formality." ...|$|E

500|$|Although {{the mint}} {{had given the}} twenty-cent piece a smooth rim, rather than the reeded one on the quarter, the two pieces were {{immediately}} confused. At , the twenty-cent piece was only slightly smaller than the quarter at , and the two pieces had near-identical obverses. Mistakes in change-making were widespread, and the twenty-cent piece quickly became extremely unpopular. [...] In April 1876, when Congress began to allow the redemption of fractional currency with coin, the twenty-cent piece was listed as among the denominations that could be exchanged for the low-denomination paper. Nevertheless, in July, legislation was introduced to abolish the twenty-cent piece. [...] Although the bill did not pass immediately, according to numismatist Vernon Brown in his article on the piece, the pendency of the bill convinced the mint that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>point</b> in striking further twenty-cent pieces. The mintage for 1876 was low (coining took place at Philadelphia and Carson City), and only proof specimens were coined in 1877 and 1878, at Philadelphia. Most of the 1876 Philadelphia mintage were sold as souvenirs at the Centennial Exposition.|$|E

Cameron believed in a passionate work ethic and never apologized for the way he ran his sets, although he acknowledged:I'm demanding, and I'm demanding on my crew.
