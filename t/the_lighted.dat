5|$|In the 18thcentury it was {{the custom}} for the wealthy in Poulton to bury their dead at night, {{following}} a lamp-lit procession through town. This tradition lasted until 1810. In 1732, during the procession preceding the funeral of Geoffrey Hornby, strong winds caused sparks to fly from <b>the</b> <b>lighted</b> tapers carried by mourners. The buildings {{on the west side}} of the market place, low cottages with thatched roofs, caught fire and were destroyed. After local fund-raising the houses were eventually replaced with brick buildings with tile roofs.|$|E
5|$|By August 9, the {{production}} {{was already a}} full day behind schedule. Despite the delays, Wise refused to shoot more than twelve hours on set, feeling he lost his edge afterwards. The director was patient on set; bets were placed on when he would finally lose his temper, but pool organizers returned the money when Wise never lost his cool. Given his unfamiliarity with the source material Wise relied on the actors, especially Shatner, to help ensure that dialog and characterizations {{were consistent with the}} show. While the bridge scenes were shot early, trouble with filming the transporter room scene delayed further work. Crew working on the transporter platform found their footwear melting on <b>the</b> <b>lighted</b> grid while shooting tests. Issues with the wormhole sequences caused further delays. The footage for the scene was filmed two ways; first, at the standard 24frames per second, and then at the faster 48frames; the normal footage was a back-up if the slow-motion effect produced by the faster frame speed did not turned out as planned. The shoot dragged on so long that it became a running joke for cast members to try and top each other with wormhole-related puns. The scene was finally completed on August 24, while the transporter scenes were being filmed at the same time on the same soundstage.|$|E

25|$|In 1923, the United States Congress funded a {{sequential}} lighted airway {{along the}} transcontinental airmail route. <b>The</b> <b>lighted</b> airway was proposed by National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), and deployed by the Department of Commerce.

25|$|Around 1966 AMT {{obtained}} the plastic model rights to Star Trek {{and developed a}} model kit of the Starship Enterprise, beginning a long association between AMT, science fiction and television. The original model of the Enterprise was equipped with battery-operated lights, but even after the lights were deleted, a number of features from <b>the</b> <b>lighted</b> model persisted in the kit, including a removable main deflector assembly which had covered the battery compartment and served as an on-off switch for <b>the</b> <b>lighted</b> model. There were also little indentations in the saucer section where the light bulbs were to be placed. By the 1980s an ongoing series of revisions to the tooling to correct various inaccuracies, which unfortunately created a few new inaccuracies, such as a deflector dish that is far too small and nacelle caps which are shaped incorrectly. There was also a kit of the Klingon D-7 Battlecruiser ship seen on the TV show. It too was lighted in its first couple of issues.|$|E

50|$|Three {{years after}} {{improvements}} to the keeper's house were made in 1890, the bridge to <b>the</b> <b>light</b> was destroyed by a storm.

500|$|The skintight suits worn by {{the actors}} were {{reminiscent}} of the outfits {{worn by the}} actors in the original film. Kosinski believed that the costumes {{could be made to}} be practical due to the computerized nature of the film, as physically illuminating each costume would be costly to the budget. Christine Bieselin Clark worked with Michael Wilkinson in designing <b>the</b> <b>lighted</b> costumes, which used electroluminescent lamps derived from a flexible polymer film and featured hexagonal patterns. The lights passed through the suit via Light Tape, a substance composed of Honeywell lamination and Sylvania phosphors. To concoct a color, a transparent 3M Vinyl film was applied onto the phosphor prior to lamination. While most of the suits were made out of foam latex, others derived from spandex, which was sprayed with balloon rubber, ultimately giving the illusion of a lean shape. The actors had to be compressed to compensate for the bulk of the electronics. In addition, Clark and Wilkinson designed over 140 background costumes. The two sought influence from various fashion and shoe designers in building the costumes. On the back of the suit was an illuminated disc, which consisted of 134 LED lights. It was attached to the suit via a magnet, and was radio-controlled. All the costumes had to be sewn {{in such a way that}} the stitches did not appear, as the design team figured that in a virtual environment the clothes would just materialize, with no need for buttons, zippers or enclosures. According to Neville Page, the lead designer for the helmets, [...] "The art departments communicated very well with each other to realise Joeâ€™s [...] vision. We would look over each otherâ€™s shoulders to find inspiration from one another. The development of the costumes came from trying to develop the form language which came from within the film." ...|$|E

50|$|Before modern strobe lights, lenses {{were used}} to {{concentrate}} <b>the</b> <b>light</b> from a continuous source.
