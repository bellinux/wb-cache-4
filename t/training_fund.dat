40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Congress has {{expressed concern about the}} extent to which the Department of Defense has moved funds that directly affect military readiness, such as those that finance training, to pay for other subactivities within its operation and maintenance (O&M) account, such as real property maintenance and base operations. This report reviews the (1) Army's obligation of O&M division <b>training</b> <b>funds</b> and (2) readiness of the Army's divisions. GAO found that the Army continued to use division <b>training</b> <b>funds</b> for purposes other than training during fiscal year 2000. However, the reduced funding did not interfere with the Army's planned training events or exercises. The Army's tank units also reported that, despite the reduced funding and their failure to meet their tank mileage performance goal, their readiness remained high. Specifically, many tank units reported that they could be fully trained for their wartime mission within a short time period. Units that reported that they would need more time to become fully trained generally cited personnel issues rather than the lack of <b>training</b> <b>funds</b> as the reason. Even so, starting in fiscal year 2001, the Army has taken action to restrict moving <b>training</b> <b>funds</b> by exempting unit <b>training</b> <b>funds</b> from any Army headquarters' adjustments and requiring prior approval before Army commands move any <b>training</b> <b>funds.</b> ...|$|R
