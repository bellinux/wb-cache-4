5|$|The {{atmosphere}} of Venus {{is composed of}} 96.5% carbon dioxide, 3.5% nitrogen, and traces of other gases, most notably sulfur dioxide. The amount of nitrogen in <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>is</b> relatively small compared {{to the amount of}} carbon dioxide, but because <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>is</b> so much thicker than that on Earth, its total nitrogen content is roughly four times higher than Earth's, even though on Earth nitrogen makes up about 78% of the atmosphere.|$|E

It can be extracted from liquid air by fractional distillation. The amount of krypton in space is uncertain, because measurement is derived from meteoric activity and solar winds. The first measurements suggest an abundance of krypton in space.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>is</b> {{divided into}} a number of {{sections}} depending on altitude. The densest part of the atmosphere, the troposphere, begins at the surface and extends upwards to 65km. At the furnace-like surface the winds are slow, but {{at the top of the}} troposphere the temperature and pressure reaches Earth-like levels and clouds pick up speed to 100m/s.|$|E
5|$|The {{atmosphere}} of Mars consists of about 96% carbon dioxide, 1.93% argon and 1.89% nitrogen along with traces of oxygen and water. <b>The</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>is</b> quite dusty, containing particulates about 1.5µm in diameter which give the Martian sky a tawny color when {{seen from the}} surface.

5|$|Above the troposphere, <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>is</b> usually {{divided into}} the stratosphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere. Each layer has a {{different}} lapse rate, defining {{the rate of change}} in temperature with height. Beyond these, the exosphere thins out into the magnetosphere, where the geomagnetic fields interact with the solar wind. Within the stratosphere is the ozone layer, a component that partially shields the surface from ultraviolet light and thus is important for life on Earth. The Kármán line, defined as 100km above Earth's surface, is a working definition for the boundary between the atmosphere and outer space.|$|E
5|$|As <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>is</b> {{transparent}} {{for radio}} waves, radio telescopes in space are of most use for Very Long Baseline Interferometry; doing simultaneous observations of a source {{with both a}} satellite and a ground-based telescope and by correlating their signals to simulate a radio telescope {{the size of the}} separation between the two telescopes. Observations can be of supernova remnants, masers, gravitational lenses, starburst galaxies, and many other things.|$|E
5|$|Electric {{currents}} induced in the ionosphere generate {{magnetic fields}} (ionospheric dynamo region). Such a field is always generated near where <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>is</b> {{closest to the}} Sun, causing daily alterations that can deflect surface magnetic fields {{by as much as}} one degree. Typical daily variations of field strength are about 25 nanoteslas (nT) (one part in 2000), with variations over a few seconds of typically around 1 nT (one part in 50,000).|$|E

5|$|Sound {{movement}} through <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>is</b> affected by wind shear, which can bend the wave front, causing sounds {{to be heard}} where they normally would not, or vice versa. Strong vertical wind shear within the troposphere also inhibits tropical cyclone development, but helps to organize individual thunderstorms into living longer life cycles that can then produce severe weather. The thermal wind concept explains how differences in wind speed with height are dependent on horizontal temperature differences, and explains {{the existence of the}} jet stream.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>is</b> {{a chaotic}} system. As a result, small changes to {{one part of}} the system can {{accumulate}} and magnify to cause large effects on the system as a whole. This atmospheric instability makes weather forecasting less predictable than tides or eclipses. Although it is difficult to accurately predict weather {{more than a few days}} in advance, weather forecasters are continually working to extend this limit through meteorological research and refining current methodologies in weather prediction. However, it is theoretically impossible to make useful day-to-day predictions more than about two weeks ahead, imposing an upper limit to potential for improved prediction skill.|$|E
5|$|Xenon has {{a minimum}} {{alveolar}} concentration (MAC) of 72% at age 40, making it 44% more potent than N2O as an anesthetic. Thus, {{it can be}} used with oxygen in concentrations that have a lower risk of hypoxia. Unlike nitrous oxide (N2O), xenon is not a greenhouse gas and is viewed as environmentally friendly. Though recycled in modern systems, xenon vented to <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>is</b> only returning to its original source, without environmental impact.|$|E

5|$|Although entries of meteoroids into Earth's {{atmosphere}} {{are very}} common, recording a similar flight through the upper layers of <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>is</b> quite rare. Probably {{the first one}} reliably verified happened on 20 July 1860 above the American state of New York. The Czechoslovak–Polish fireball is sometimes compared to the 1972Great Daylight Fireball above Utah, the United States, and Alberta, Canada, {{which is the first}} scientifically observed and studied event of this type. The 1972 fireball was more than a thousand times as massive and it got 40km closer to Earth's surface. Observational data from both of them helped to develop a method for computing the grazing trajectories of such bodies, which was later used when calculating the trajectory of another Earth-grazing meteoroid, observed on 29 March 2006 above Japan.|$|E
5|$|Although most white dwarfs {{are thought}} to be {{composed}} of carbon and oxygen, spectroscopy typically shows that their emitted light comes from an atmosphere which is observed to be either hydrogen or helium dominated. The dominant element is usually at least 1,000 times more abundant than all other elements. As explained by Schatzman in the 1940s, the high surface gravity is thought to cause this purity by gravitationally separating the atmosphere so that heavy elements are below and the lighter above., §5–6 This atmosphere, {{the only part of the}} white dwarf visible to us, is thought to be the top of an envelope which is a residue of the star's envelope in the AGB phase and may also contain material accreted from the interstellar medium. The envelope is believed to consist of a helium-rich layer with mass no more than 1/100 of the star's total mass, which, if <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>is</b> hydrogen-dominated, is overlain by a hydrogen-rich layer with mass approximately 1/10,000 of the stars total mass., §4–5.|$|E
5|$|An {{emissions}} trading scheme for {{greenhouse gas emissions}} (GHGs) works by establishing property rights for the atmosphere. <b>The</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>is</b> a global public good, and GHG emissions are an international externality (p.21). The emissions from all sources of GHGs contribute to the overall stock of GHGs in the atmosphere. In the cap-and-trade variant of {{emissions trading}}, a limit on access to a resource (the cap) is defined and then allocated among users {{in the form of}} permits. Compliance is established by comparing actual emissions with permits surrendered including any permits traded within the cap. The environmental integrity of emissions trading is depends on the setting of the cap, not the decision to allow trading.|$|E

5|$|Epsilon Eridani has an {{estimated}} mass of 0.82 solar masses and a radius of 0.74 solar radii. It shines with a luminosity of only 0.34 solar luminosities. The estimated effective temperature is 5,084K. With a stellar classification of K2V, {{it is the}} second-nearest K-type main-sequence star (after Alpha Centauri B). Since 1943 the spectrum of Epsilon Eridani has served {{as one of the}} stable anchor points by which other stars are classified. Its metallicity, the fraction of elements heavier than helium, is slightly lower than the Sun's. In Epsilon Eridani's chromosphere, a region of the outer atmosphere just above the light emitting photosphere, the abundance of iron is estimated at 74% of the Sun's value. The proportion of lithium in <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>is</b> five times less than that in the Sun.|$|E
5|$|The local {{gravitational}} acceleration at the poles {{is greater than}} at the equator, so, by the Von Zeipel theorem, the local luminosity is also higher at the poles. This {{is seen as a}} variation in effective temperature over the star: the polar temperature is near 10,000K, while the equatorial temperature is 7,600K. As a result, if Vega were viewed along the plane of its equator, then the luminosity would be about half the apparent luminosity as viewed from the pole. This large temperature difference between the poles and the equator produces a strong 'gravity darkening' effect. As viewed from the poles, this results in a darker (lower intensity) limb than would normally be expected for a spherically symmetric star. The temperature gradient may also mean Vega has a convection zone around the equator, while the remainder of <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>is</b> likely to be in almost pure radiative equilibrium.|$|E
5|$|All {{these facts}} are {{consequences}} of the thermal wind relation. The balance of forces acting on an atmospheric air parcel in the vertical direction is primarily between the gravitational force acting on {{the mass of the}} parcel and the buoyancy force, or the difference in pressure between the top and bottom surfaces of the parcel. Any imbalance between these forces results in the acceleration of the parcel in the imbalance direction: upward if the buoyant force exceeds the weight, and downward if the weight exceeds the buoyancy force. The balance in the vertical direction is referred to as hydrostatic. Beyond the tropics, the dominant forces act in the horizontal direction, and the primary struggle is between the Coriolis force and the pressure gradient force. Balance between these two forces is referred to as geostrophic. Given both hydrostatic and geostrophic balance, one can derive the thermal wind relation: the vertical gradient of the horizontal wind is proportional to the horizontal temperature gradient. If two air masses, one cold and dense to the North and the other hot and less dense to the South, are separated by a vertical boundary and that boundary should be removed, the difference in densities will result in the cold air mass slipping under the hotter and less dense air mass. The Coriolis effect will then cause poleward-moving mass to deviate to the East, while equatorward-moving mass will deviate toward the west. The general trend in <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>is</b> for temperatures to decrease in the poleward direction. As a result, winds develop an eastward component and that component grows with altitude. Therefore, the strong eastward moving jet streams are in part a simple consequence {{of the fact that the}} Equator is warmer than the North and South poles.|$|E
40|$|Ca •+) and 5180 {{covering}} the last 110, 000 yeaxs from the Greenland Ice Sheet Project 2 (GISP 2) ice core were utilized {{in this study}} in order to reconstruct the soluble chemistry of <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere</b> over Greenland and interpret major climate events that have affected the region.
