5|$|On December 16, 2013, Brown was {{assigned}} to the Spokane Shock of the Arena Football League. On May 20, 2014, Brown was placed on reassignment by <b>the</b> <b>Shock.</b> On May 28, 2014, Brown was once again assigned to <b>the</b> <b>Shock.</b> He was placed on recallable reassignment on March 14, 2015. Brown was once again assigned to <b>the</b> <b>Shock</b> on March 26, 2015. Brown made his first career start for <b>the</b> <b>Shock</b> during their Week 2 game against the Philadelphia Soul. Brown was able to lead <b>the</b> <b>Shock</b> to a few scoring plays, but his ineffective play ultimately led to his benching in favor of Matt Bassuener. On April 14, 2015, he was placed on reassignment by <b>the</b> <b>Shock.</b>|$|E

5|$|Because the {{earthquake}} occurred before seismometers were {{operating in the}} region, the magnitude of <b>the</b> <b>shock</b> and its location were never precisely determined, but the intensity reports that are available for the event were studied, and various epicenters for the event were proposed based on these limited data. One study presented an estimated moment magnitude of 6.5–7.0, with a proposed location {{on the east side}} of the Cascade Range near Lake Chelan. The results of a separate study indicated that it may have been a larger event, placing <b>the</b> <b>shock</b> in the North Cascades, just south of the Canada–United States border at Ross Lake.|$|E

5|$|The {{hammering}} of woodpeckers when drumming or feeding creates great {{forces which}} are potentially {{damaging to the}} birds. In the great spotted woodpecker {{and most of its}} relatives, the hinge where the front of the skull connects with the upper mandible is folded inwards, tensioned by a muscle that braces it against <b>the</b> <b>shock</b> of the impact when the bill is hammering on hard wood. The outer layer of the upper mandible is significantly longer than the more rigid lower mandible and absorbs much of the concussive force. Skeletal adaptations and strengthening also help to absorb <b>the</b> <b>shock,</b> and narrow nostrils protect against flying debris.|$|E

5|$|Beta Pictoris {{may have}} been formed near the Scorpius-Centaurus Association.

40|$|Global linear {{stability}} {{analysis of}} a self-similar solution describing a relativistic shell decelerated by an ambient medium is performed.

40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the nature of <b>the</b> <b>shocks</b> that hit <b>the</b> small- and {{medium-sized}} enterprises (SMEs) in Japan during the global financial crisis that occurred {{in the wake of the}} massive number of non-performing subprime loans in the U.

We examine how the SMEs responded to <b>the</b> <b>shocks,</b> using <b>the</b> unique surveys that were conducted by the Research Institute of Economy, Trade and Industry (RIETI) in 2008 and 2009. <b>The</b> <b>shocks</b> were identified as demand, supply and financial <b>shocks.</b> <b>The</b> demand <b>shock</b> was <b>the</b> most prevalent, while <b>the</b> financial <b>shock</b> was <b>the</b> least frequent. The SMEs took a spectrum of measures against <b>the</b> demand <b>shock</b> by seeking help from suppliers and financial institutions. We find that the measures taken by the SMEs crucially depended on the bank-firm relationship, but not on the customer-supplier relationship.

30|$|The impulse {{response}} functions of <b>the</b> <b>shocks</b> provide {{insights into the}} propagation dynamics of <b>the</b> <b>shocks,</b> including <b>the</b> transmission of macroeconomic policies. Variances and welfare losses resulting from <b>the</b> <b>shocks</b> {{can be used to}} analyze volatility and efficiency. We also look at the effects of varying the degree of price flexibility relative to the degree of wage flexibility. As noted in the literature, this aspect is of importance in the controversy between orthodox and Neo-Keynesians. We find that this also is of importance in the disequilibrium model.|$|R
5|$|For TypeII supernovae, the {{collapse}} is eventually halted by short-range repulsive neutron-neutron interactions, {{mediated by the}} strong force, {{as well as by}} degeneracy pressure of neutrons, at a density comparable to that of an atomic nucleus. When {{the collapse}} stops, the infalling matter rebounds, producing a shock wave that propagates outward. The energy from this shock dissociates heavy elements within the core. This reduces the energy of <b>the</b> <b>shock,</b> which can stall the explosion within the outer core.|$|E
5|$|Full-scale armour trials {{revealed}} serious {{weaknesses in}} the proposed protection scheme. The trials employed the obsolete ironclad , modified with armour protection identical to that used by the s then under construction.

5|$|In a {{visit to}} Los Alamos in September 1944, von Neumann showed that the {{pressure}} increase from explosion shock wave reflection from solid objects was greater than previously believed if the angle of incidence of <b>the</b> <b>shock</b> wave was between 90° and some limiting angle. As a result, {{it was determined that}} the effectiveness of an atomic bomb would be enhanced with detonation some kilometers above the target, rather than at ground level.|$|E
40|$|Global linear {{stability}} {{analysis of}} a self-similar solution describing the interaction of a relativistic shell with an ambient medium is performed. The solution is shown to be unstable to convective Rayleigh-Taylor modes having angular scales smaller than the causality scale. Longer wavelength modes are stable and decay with time. For modes of sufficiently large spherical harmonic degree l the dimensionless growth rate scales as √(l/Γ), where Γ is the Lorentz factor of the shell. The instability commences at the contact interface separating <b>the</b> <b>shocked</b> eject a and shocked ambient gas and propagates to <b>the</b> <b>shocks.</b> <b>The</b> reverse <b>shock</b> front responds promptly to the in stability and exhibits rapidly growing distortions at early times. Propagation to <b>the</b> forward <b>shock</b> is slower, and it is anticipated that the region near the contact will become fully turbulent before the instability is communicated to <b>the</b> forward <b>shock.</b> <b>The</b> non-universality of the Blandford-McKee blast wave solution suggests that turbulence generated by the instability in <b>the</b> <b>shocked</b> ambient medium may decay slowly with time and may be the origin of magnetic fields over a long portion of the blast wave evolution. It is also speculated that the instability may affect the emission from <b>the</b> <b>shocked</b> ejecta in <b>the</b> early post-prompt phase of GRBs. Comment: 25 pages, post referee versio...|$|R
