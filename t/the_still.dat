5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, and while living in northern France, Wodehouse was captured by the Germans and was interned for over a year. After his release he was tricked into making five comic and apolitical broadcasts on German radio to <b>the</b> <b>still</b> neutral US. After vehement protests in Britain, Wodehouse never returned to his home country again, despite being cleared by an MI5 investigation. He moved to the US permanently in 1947 and took American citizenship in 1955. He continued writing until his death in 1975.|$|E

5000|$|Timothy [...] "Tim" [...] Fletcher (born July 12, 1978) is an English-Canadian {{musician}} {{who was the}} vocalist and guitarist for Montreal-based band <b>the</b> <b>Stills,</b> who have since broken up. Born in Montreal to English and Welsh parents, Fletcher met his future bandmates {{at the age of}} 15 before forming <b>the</b> <b>Stills</b> in 2000. Along with a number of <b>the</b> <b>Stills,</b> he previously played in an early incarnation of the band Chinatown, and was also a member of heavy metal band Amentum.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>stills</b> at Banff {{were fed}} by hand with coal until 1963, when a system {{was put in}} place to deliver the coal mechanically. In 1970, <b>the</b> <b>stills</b> were {{converted}} to be heated by oil burners. Cooling water was drawn from Burn of Boydine.|$|R
5|$|By February 1794 <b>the</b> <b>still</b> decommissioned, Marseillois {{had been}} renamed Vengeur du Peuple, {{probably}} {{a response to}} the participation of the city of Marseille in the Federalist revolts of 1793. She was recommissioned in Rochefort, and on 24 March 1794, Captain Jean François Renaudin took command. On 1 April 1794, she sailed to Île-d'Aix, where she joined up with Pelletier, and on 11 April, the squadron sailed on again, reaching Brest on 18 April, having been joined en route by Jemmapes. Upon their arrival the ships were assigned to the squadron under Admiral Villaret de Joyeuse.|$|E
5|$|Copper is used {{to create}} stills for distilling spirits, for example to make whisky. It's {{malleability}} {{makes it easy to}} bend into the various shapes required and allows considerable flexibility in the shaping of <b>the</b> <b>still</b> and associated pipework; the metal also reacts with undesirable sulfur-containing components in the vapor and distillate making for a cleaner product.|$|E
5|$|Depicted in {{the mosaic}} Map of Madaba of 600, Gaza {{was the most}} {{important}} political and commercial center on the southern coast of Palestine. Its northern municipal border was marked by Wadi al-Hesi, just before Ashkelon, and its southern boundary is unknown, but Gaza's jurisdiction did not reach Raphia. The towns of Bethelea, Asalea, Gerarit and Kissufim were included in Gaza's territories. Its large representation, approximately half of which is preserved, cannot be easily explained, mainly because only small tentative excavations have been made there and because Byzantine Gaza is covered by <b>the</b> <b>still</b> inhabited Old City.|$|E
50|$|Benrinnes {{employed}} {{some unusual}} production techniques. Between 1974 and 2007 the distillery used a unique partial triple distillation process. In this process the feints from <b>the</b> wash <b>still,</b> <b>the</b> weaker parts of feints of <b>the</b> spirit <b>still,</b> and <b>the</b> feints from <b>the</b> low wine <b>still</b> itself are distilled {{in a low}} wines <b>still,</b> while <b>the</b> spirit <b>still</b> is fed by the foreshots and {{the heart of the}} wash and low wine still, and its own foreshots and strong feints. The necks of <b>the</b> <b>stills</b> are cooled by worm tubs, a technique that is no longer very common.|$|R
50|$|On March 28, 2009, <b>the</b> <b>Stills</b> {{were awarded}} two Juno Awards (Canada's music awards) for their album Oceans Will Rise, in the {{categories}} of Best New Group and Best Alternative Album. In 2010, Paquet rejoined and Hamelin moved back to drums. <b>The</b> <b>Stills</b> announced their breakup on April 15, 2011.|$|R
5000|$|Logic Will Break Your Heart <b>the</b> <b>Stills</b> (2003) Featuring <b>the</b> single 'Still In Love Song' {{recorded}} by Jay Braun in the Negatones rehearsal studio. Conceived as a demo, <b>the</b> <b>Stills</b> liked <b>the</b> vibe {{of the track}} so much they released it as their first single on their Atlantic Records debut.|$|R
5|$|During World War I, <b>the</b> <b>still</b> poorly {{developed}} peninsula {{suddenly found}} itself in a strategic position, as the communication between Russia and the Allies was cut and the ice-free harbors of the Murman Coast remained {{the only means of}} sending the war supplies to the Eastern Front. In March 1915, the construction of the railroad was rushed, and the railroad was quickly opened in 1916, even though it was only partially completed and poorly built. In 1916, Romanov-na-Murmane (modern Murmansk) was founded as the terminal point of the new railroad; the town quickly grew to become the largest one on the peninsula.|$|E
5|$|During the 1930s–1950s {{heyday of}} the big Hollywood studios, {{the status of women}} in the {{industry}} was abysmal and, while much has improved, many would argue that there is still much to be done. From art films by Sally Potter, Catherine Breillat, Claire Denis and Jane Campion to action movies by Kathryn Bigelow, women now have a stronger voice, but are only too aware of <b>the</b> <b>still</b> lingering gender gap.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} for Gauguin's visit, Van Gogh bought two beds on {{advice from the}} station's postal supervisor Joseph Roulin, whose portrait he painted. On 17 September he spent his first night in <b>the</b> <b>still</b> sparsely furnished Yellow House. When Gauguin consented to work and live in Arles with him, Van Gogh started {{to work on the}} Décoration for the Yellow House, probably the most ambitious effort he ever undertook. He completed two chair paintings: Van Gogh's Chair and Gauguin's Chair.|$|E

5|$|Large ranches {{exist in}} the Amarillo area: among others, the defunct XIT Ranch and <b>the</b> <b>still</b> {{functioning}} JA Ranch founded in 1877 by Charles Goodnight and John George Adair. Goodnight continued the partnership for a time after Adair's death with Adair's widow, Cornelia Wadsworth Ritchie Adair, {{who was then the}} sole owner from 1887 until her death in 1921.|$|E
5|$|On 1 September 1967 {{at his own}} trial Bukovsky {{used his}} final words to attack the regime's failure to respect the law or follow legal procedures. He invoked Article 125 of <b>the</b> (<b>still</b> current) 1936 Soviet Constitution to defend the right to {{organize}} demonstrations and other public protests. He further suggested that the prosecution had repeatedly failed to observe the revised 1961 Code of Criminal Procedure in its conduct of the case. Bukovsky's final words in court circulated widely in a samizdat collection of such addresses {{and as part of}} a collection of materials about the demonstration and subsequent trials compiled by Pavel Litvinov.|$|E
5|$|Screaming mouths {{appears in}} many of Bacon's works from the late 1940s to the early 1950s. The motif was {{developed}} from sources including medical textbooks, and images of the nurse in the Odessa Steps sequence in Sergei Eisenstein's 1925 silent film Battleship Potemkin. Bacon kept a close-up still of the screaming nurse, {{at the moment when}} she has been shot in the eye. He referred to <b>the</b> <b>still</b> in paintings throughout his career.|$|E

5|$|Shinra pursue Zack and Cloud, {{and catch}} up with them just outside Midgar. Leaving <b>the</b> <b>still</b> semi-conscious Cloud hidden away, Zack fights off an {{enormous}} number of Shinra troops, but is ultimately fatally wounded. Cloud manages to crawl to Zack's body after Shinra has left, and Zack, in his dying breath, bequeaths the Buster Sword to Cloud, as Angeal had done to him. Cloud then begins to walk to Midgar. The epilogue recreates the opening scenes of Final Fantasy VII, as Cloud, his memories confused, claims to be a former SOLDIER.|$|E
5|$|The Humanist Library {{displays}} one of {{the oldest}} and most homogeneous collections of medieval manuscripts and Renaissance books in Europe. Its core is <b>the</b> <b>still</b> almost intact library of Beatus Rhenanus, which was bequeathed to the city and has been maintained by it ever since. The institution also holds the books that belonged to the Latin school of Sélestat, at which Rhenanus and many other reformers were educated around 1500. In 2011, the library has been inscribed in the Unesco's Memory of the World Register.|$|E
5|$|The Lakers won 60 {{games in}} the 1972–73 NBA season, and took another Pacific Division title. Wilt Chamberlain, playing in his final season, again {{led the league in}} {{rebounding}} and set <b>the</b> <b>still</b> standing NBA record for field-goal percentage at 72.7%. The team defeated the Chicago Bulls in seven {{games in the}} conference semifinals, then the Golden State Warriors in five in the Western Division Finals. They played the New York Knicks in the 1973 NBA Finals. Los Angeles took the first game by three points, but New York won the series in five games.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>stills</b> used in <b>the</b> second {{distillation}} (<b>the</b> spirit <b>still)</b> of Cragganmore whisky are unique {{in having a}} flat top and being relatively short. The stills' shape has a definite effect on the taste and aroma (nose) of the whisky.|$|R

50|$|In a new {{rejuvenation}} in 1958, two Lomond stills were installed, alongside <b>the</b> existing <b>stills.</b> <b>The</b> whisky distilled {{in these}} stills was kept {{separate from the}} rest of the whisky produced by the distillery, and sold under the name Glencraig. Production continued up until 1981 when the experiment with Lomond stills was abandoned, and <b>the</b> <b>stills</b> were replaced with regular stills.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>still</b> largely unexplained tectonic {{causes of}} the {{volcanism}} that has produced the Silverthrone Caldera are a matter of ongoing research. Silverthrone is not above a hotspot as are Nazko or Hawaii. However, {{it may be a}} product of the Cascadia subduction zone because andesite, basaltic andesite, dacite and rhyolite {{can be found at the}} volcano and elsewhere along the subduction zone. At issue are the current plate configuration and rate of subduction but Silverthrone's chemistry indicates that Silverthrone is subduction related.|$|E
5|$|The {{wide range}} of psychoactive effects can be {{variously}} described as depressant, sedative-hypnotic, psychedelic, dissociative, and deliriant; paradoxical effects such as stimulation may occur however. Perceptual phenomena such as synesthesia, macropsia, and micropsia may occur. Some users report lucid dreaming {{under the influence of}} its hypnotic effects. Unlike Psilocybe cubensis, A.muscaria cannot be commercially cultivated, due to its mycorrhizal relationship with the roots of pine trees. However, following the outlawing of psilocybin mushrooms in the United Kingdom in 2006, the sale of <b>the</b> <b>still</b> legal A.muscaria began increasing.|$|E
5|$|Three bad endings {{see one of}} {{the protagonists}} undergo the second {{transformation}} if Indiana could not convince Ubermann to use the machine instead, or if Sophia was not freed from her prison or Nur-Ab-Sal's influence. In the good ending, Atlantis succumbs to the eruption of <b>the</b> <b>still</b> active volcano as the duo flees from the city. The final scene depicts Indiana kissing Sophia on top of the escape submarine, to comfort himself for the lack of evidence for their discovery.|$|E
