In October 1986, Franklin County Circuit Court Judge Ray Corns issued an initial ruling that <b>the</b> <b>package</b> did not violate the state constitution, but both sides asked the Kentucky Supreme Court to make a final decision. On June 11, 1987, the Kentucky Supreme Court ruled 4–3 that <b>the</b> <b>package</b> served a public purpose and were therefore constitutional.|$|E

5|$|In 2013, Lundgren starred {{alongside}} Steve Austin in <b>The</b> <b>Package.</b> Directed by Jesse Johnson, principal photography {{wrapped in}} March 2012, {{and the film}} was released on February 9, 2013. For a direct-to-DVD film, <b>The</b> <b>Package</b> was not a financial success. In its first week of release, the film debuted at no. 81; grossing $1,469 at the domestic box office.

40|$|Growing {{pressure}} on <b>the</b> <b>packaging</b> design {{to enhance the}} environmental and logistics performance of a <b>packaging</b> system stresses <b>the</b> <b>packaging</b> designers to search new design strategies that not only fulfill logistics requirements in the supply chain, but also reduce the CO 2 emissions during <b>the</b> <b>packaging</b> life cycle. This thesis focuses on <b>the</b> <b>packaging</b> design process and suggests some improvements by considering its logistics performance and CO 2 emissions. A Green packaging development model was proposed for corrugated box design to explore the inter-dependencies that exist among compressive strength, waste and CO 2 emissions. The verification of the proposed model unveils the significance of a holistic view of <b>the</b> <b>packaging</b> system in <b>the</b> <b>packaging</b> design process and reveals <b>the</b> importance of <b>packaging</b> design decisions on the logistics performance and CO 2 emissions. The thesis finally concluded that <b>the</b> <b>packaging</b> logistics performance {{should be considered in}} a packaging design process to explore <b>the</b> Green <b>packaging</b> design solution...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the {{issues relating to}} integrating <b>the</b> <b>packaging</b> supplier as an active participator in the demand chain. The ability to offer and deliver highly systemised packaging solutions in a quick and efficient way has become a competitive differentiator. In some cases, <b>the</b> <b>packaging</b> supplier acts as a non-bias agent and actively participates as a co-ordinator in the supply and demand chain. However, case studies conducted in this field show that generally <b>the</b> <b>packaging</b> supplier has a relatively passive role in the supply chain. The overall problem definition for this research is to study <b>the</b> <b>packaging</b> supplier’s relatively passive role to face {{the demands of the}} supply chain. What will be the synergies if <b>the</b> <b>packaging</b> supplier holds {{an active role in the}} supply and demand chain? The overall purpose of this work is to describe <b>the</b> <b>packaging</b> supplier’s momentary situation, the development of <b>the</b> <b>packaging</b> supplier in <b>the</b> future, and to study the obstacles to including <b>the</b> <b>packaging</b> supplier as an active partner in the supply chain. To summarise this paper, the work shows an indication of the present situation of <b>the</b> <b>packaging</b> suppliers. <b>The</b> project is in progress and it is too early to draw conclusions about <b>the</b> entire <b>packaging</b> trade from this work to establish their role in network logistics...|$|R

On March 19, Tedisco called for the resignation of Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner over the AIG controversy.

5|$|Each {{software}} package has a maintainer {{that may be}} either one person or a team of Debian developers and non-developer maintainers.

50|$|Why is {{this concept}} important? Compare how often Coca Cola changes {{the formula for}} Coke with how often <b>the</b> <b>packaging</b> is changed.

In process manufacturing, the formula for making the product and <b>the</b> recipe for <b>packaging</b> <b>the</b> product exist in separate structures to reduce the ongoing maintenance function.|$|R
