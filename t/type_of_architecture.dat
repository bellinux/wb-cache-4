5|$|A recent {{geological}} formation, Carabane {{consists of}} a shoal and alluvium. The alluvium has developed because of the saltwater streams that cut across the shoal. As pointed out by early French observers, soils {{in the region are}} generally composed of sand and clay, differing in mixture and layer according to natural and human factors. However, Carabane seems to be composed entirely of sand. The lack of clay is the reason that architecture on the island employs straw wrapped around wooden frames more often than banco mud bricks. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>architecture</b> is also common in the villages of Mlomp and Seleki.|$|E
25|$|The term is {{borrowed}} from linguistics, where vernacular refers to language use particular to a time, place or group. In architecture, {{it refers to}} that <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>architecture</b> which is indigenous to a specific time or place (not imported or copied from elsewhere). It is most often applied to residential buildings.|$|E
25|$|During {{the period}} of Dutch {{colonization}} in South Africa, a distinctive <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>architecture,</b> known as Cape Dutch architecture, was developed. These style of architecture {{can be found in}} historical towns such as Stellenbosch, Swellendam, Tulbagh and Graaff-Reinet. In the former Dutch capital of Cape Town, nearly nothing from the VOC era have survived except the Castle of Good Hope.|$|E
50|$|This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> {{architectural}} model classifies different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>architecture.</b> In the later theories and models different sets <b>of</b> <b>architectures</b> have been proposed.

25|$|A {{considerable}} amount of research went in before deciding on the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>architecture</b> {{to be used in}} construction. “Earth” architecture was chosen because it would cause the least amount of ecological damage while blending harmoniously with the micro environment around the site. “Earth” (mud) that is used for construction can be recycled indefinitely or left to disintegrate without causing any environmental degradation.|$|E
25|$|The term New Indies Style refers {{specifically}} to the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>architecture</b> which appear in the 1910s Dutch East Indies. During the brief transitional period in early 20th century, the style coexisted with other Modern architectural variants in the Dutch East Indies: Art Deco, Expressionism, Nieuwe zakelijkheid, etc. The styles represent technological progress during the brief pre-World War II period.|$|E
25|$|During the Kamakura period (1185–1333) and the {{following}} Muromachi period (1336–1573), Japanese architecture made technological advances that made it somewhat diverge from its Chinese counterpart. In response to native requirements such as earthquake resistance and shelter against heavy rainfall and the summer heat and sun, the master carpenters of this time responded with a unique <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>architecture,</b> creating the Daibutsuyō and Zenshūyō styles.|$|E

25|$|Another <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>architecture</b> is Baroque Johannine. It {{has this}} name {{because it was}} {{developed}} {{during the reign of}} King John V, which lasted 44 years. Thanks to the gold of Brazil, hired foreign artists, such Nicolao Nasoni, King John V, ordered to perform various works of art. The creations of Portuguese artists can be seen on the altars of gilded panels and tiles, blue and white, that adorn churches, halls, staircases and gardens.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{singular}} {{examples of this}} <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>architecture</b> is Centrul Civic, a development that replaced {{a major part of}} Bucharest's historic city centre with giant utilitarian buildings, mainly with marble or travertine façades, inspired by North Korean architecture. The mass demolitions that occurred in the 1980s, under which an overall area of eight square kilometres of the historic center of Bucharest were leveled, including monasteries, churches, synagogues, a hospital, and a noted Art Deco sports stadium, changed drastically the appearance of the city.|$|E
25|$|The corners on this {{rear part}} of the {{building}} are rounded, a somewhat unusual condition for corners in buildings of this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>architecture.</b> After a recent remodeling, most windows and doors were finished in near-duplicative (usually louvered casement) designs. The new annex on the side features arched openings to the street and has glass fenestration. This addition does not contribute to the property's architectural value but due to its disposition and volume it does not harm the main structure's integrity. Even with the 1928 alterations this building is still a magnificent example of Spanish architecture in Ponce and of the neoclassical style.|$|E

25|$|The Byzantine Empire used Roman and Greek {{architectural}} {{models and}} styles to create {{its own unique}} <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>architecture.</b> The influence of Byzantine architecture and art {{can be seen in}} the copies taken from it throughout Europe. Particular examples include St Mark's Basilica in Venice, the basilicas of Ravenna, and many churches throughout the Slavic East. Also, alone in Europe until the 13th-century Italian florin, the Empire continued to produce sound gold coinage, the solidus of Diocletian becoming the bezant prized throughout the Middle Ages. Its city walls were much imitated (for example, see Caernarfon Castle) and its urban infrastructure was moreover a marvel throughout the Middle Ages, keeping alive the art, skill and technical expertise of the Roman Empire. In the Ottoman period Islamic architecture and symbolism were used.|$|E
25|$|Kuala Lumpur {{today has}} many iconic modern {{buildings}} which {{drew inspiration from}} every day traditional Malay items. The buildings were constructed in the 1980s and 1990s. An example of this style of architecture is the Lembaga Tabung Haji (Pilgrims Fund Board) building which {{is derived from the}} form of a Malay drum, Telekom Tower which resembles a slanted cut of a bamboo trunk and Maybank Tower, whose design was inspired by the sheath of the keris, the traditional Malay dagger. The buildings were designed by the same architect, Hijjas Kasturi. Istana Budaya is another example of this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>architecture,</b> in which the building is designed based on a Minangkabau head dress. The National Library which is situated beside Istana Budaya is also inspired by the Malay Head Dress.|$|E

500|$|The Polonnaruwa Vatadage is {{an ancient}} {{structure}} {{dating back to the}} Kingdom of Polonnaruwa of Sri Lanka. It {{is believed to have been}} built during the reign of Parakramabahu I to hold the Relic of the tooth of the Buddha or during the reign of Nissanka Malla of Polonnaruwa to hold the alms bowl used by the Buddha. Both these venerated relics would have given the structure a great significance and importance at the time. Located within the ancient city of Polonnaruwa, it is the best preserved example of a vatadage in the country, and has been described as the [...] "ultimate development" [...] of this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>architecture.</b> Abandoned for several centuries, excavation work at the Polonnaruwa Vatadage began in 1903.|$|E

2500|$|For Hundertwasser, human misery was {{a result}} of the rational, sterile, {{monotonous}} architecture, built following the tradition of the Austrian architect Adolf Loos, author of the modernist manifesto Ornament and crime (1908). He called for a boycott of this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>architecture,</b> and demanded instead creative freedom of building, and the right to create individual structures. In 1972 he published the manifesto Your window right — your tree duty. Planting trees in an urban environment was to become obligatory: [...] "If man walks in nature's midst, then he is nature's guest and must learn to behave as a well-brought-up guest." [...] Hundertwasser propagated a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>architecture</b> in harmony with nature is his ecological commitment. He campaigned for the preservation of the natural habitat and demanded a life in accordance with the laws of nature. He wrote numerous manifestos, lectured and designed posters in favor of nature protection, including against nuclear power, to save the oceans and the whales and to protect the rain forest. He was also an advocate of composting toilets and the principle of constructed wetland. He perceived feces not as nauseous but as part of the cycle of nature. His beliefs are testified by his manifesto The Holy Shit and his DIY guide for building a composting toilet.|$|E
2500|$|Architectural {{experiments}} are continuing {{in a number}} of directions, e.g. the Cyclops64 system uses a [...] "supercomputer on a chip" [...] approach, in a direction away from the use of massive distributed processors. Each 64-bit Cyclops64 chip contains 80 processors, and the entire system uses a globally addressable memory architecture. The processors are connected with non-internally blocking crossbar switch and communicate with each other via global interleaved memory. There is no data cache in the architecture, but half of each SRAM bank {{can be used as a}} scratchpad memory. Although this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>architecture</b> allows unstructured parallelism in a dynamically non-contiguous memory system, it also produces challenges in the efficient mapping of parallel algorithms to a many-core system.|$|E
2500|$|In Nazi Germany this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>architecture</b> later {{served as}} a model worthy of emulation. Wilhelm Kreis chose for his Soldiers’ Hall at the Army High Command {{headquarters}} in Berlin (1937/38) and for a never realized warriors’ monument {{at the foot of}} Mount Olympus in Greece a building shape which was very similar to the Pergamon Altar. But for the Soldiers’ Hall the frieze was limited to the front face of the risalit. The friezes by the sculptor Arno Breker were, however, never executed. Referencing this architectural form was not least in tune with the ideological concepts of the Nazis; an altar prompted ideas of being ready to sacrifice and heroic death. For the Nazis, the Pergamon Altar and Kreis' two testimonies of Nazi architecture were all [...] "cultic buildings". The Nazis also attempted to appropriate the message behind the altar frieze, namely the victory of good over evil.|$|E
