500|$|The {{issue of}} libertarianism became more {{pressing}} {{in the campaign}} for the Norwegian parliamentary election, 1993, when Carl I. Hagen said to Verdens Gang {{that he did not}} support cutting the income tax. This was not in line with official party policy, and Hagen did not confer with the party, stating that [...] "I had to take an independent initiative". Ellen Wibe openly criticized the statement, so did former MP and tax spokesperson Steinar Maribo. The <b>tax</b> <b>statement</b> was later seen as the most important factor contributing to the growing Hagen—liberalist schism. In the election the Progress Party won ten seats, down from 22 in the 1989 election.|$|E

40|$|The current Australian Treasury {{approach}} to tax expenditures management and reporting is a culmination of 36 years of Government and Parliamentary reviews and reports. The most notable outcome of these reviews and reports is {{the publication of}} the annual <b>tax</b> expenditures <b>statement,</b> which commenced in 1986. Since its inception, the Australian annual <b>tax</b> expenditures <b>statements</b> have themselves been the subject of review. Most recently, the Australian National Audit Office has undertaken a performance audit in the Department of the Treasury and released its report entitled Preparation of the <b>Tax</b> Expenditures <b>Statement.</b> In addition to this 2008 report, a second recent opportunity to consider tax expenditures within the Australian tax regime has arisen. The Australian tax system is currently undergoing a comprehensive and broad review with the terms of reference requiring a consideration of all relevant tax expenditures. While the recommendations of the Australian National Audit Office are not novel, and {{it is not unusual for}} a broader review to consider the role of tax expenditures within the Australian tax system, both the recommendations of the Australian National Audit Office and the views of the current Review Panel take on a renewed sense of importance given the proliferation of tax expenditures in Australia. Tax expenditures, in terms of number and pecuniary value, have increased significantly in Australia in recent years. The latest <b>Tax</b> Expenditures <b>Statement</b> lists around 320 tax expenditures with the pecuniary value of those expenditures estimated at $ 73. 69 billion or 7. 1 % of GDP. The largest category of tax expenditures listed in the 2008 <b>Tax</b> Expenditures <b>Statement,</b> totalling $ 29. 23 billion, relate to concessions aimed at retirement savings...|$|R
50|$|To {{count as}} a United States employee, the person must be {{employed}} in the United States. United States employees include United States citizens and lawful permanent residents, as well as H-1B employees in the United States. For multinational firms, employees in other countries cannot be counted. In particular, this is important for multinationals because the ability to count employees outside the United States in the denominator could {{mean the difference between}} being classified as H-1B-non-dependent and H-1B-dependent. According to the official rules, the list of employees should be determined from the most recent quarterly <b>tax</b> <b>statements</b> unless these fail to include all employees.|$|R
40|$|Each {{year the}} Australian Federal Treasury {{releases}} its <b>Tax</b> Expenditures <b>Statement</b> providing details of concessions, benefits, and incentives delivered through the tax regime to Australian taxpayers.

Apart from the annual <b>Tax</b> Expenditures <b>Statement,</b> and despite the recurring fiscal impact, {{there is very little}} other scrutiny of Australia’s Federal tax expenditures program. This is despite tax expenditures often being seen as an alternative to direct expenditures with similar impact on the Federal budget. The object of tax expenditures is to provide government assistance and meet government objectives, and, as such, tax expenditures are departures from the revenue raising aspect of the tax regime. Within this context, this article examines the fundamental concept of tax expenditures as contrasted with direct expenditures and considers the role they play in the current tax regime...|$|R

50|$|A {{common use}} of a survey is to {{determine}} a legal property boundary. The first stage in such a survey, known as a resurvey, is to obtain copies of the deed description and all other available documents from the owner. The deed description {{is that of the}} deed and not a <b>tax</b> <b>statement</b> or other incomplete document. The surveyor should then obtain copies of deed descriptions and maps of the adjoining properties, any records from the municipality or county, utility maps, and any records of surveys. Depending on which region the survey is located in, some or most of this information may not be available or even exist. Whether the information exists or not, a thorough search should be conducted so that no records are overlooked. Copies of deeds usually can be located in the government recorder's office, and maps or plats can usually be found at the recorder or surveyor's office. These arrangements will vary state-to-state and survey-system-to-survey system, so some familiarity may be needed.|$|E
50|$|The Form W-2, Wage and <b>Tax</b> <b>Statement,</b> is used {{to report}} wages paid to {{employees}} and the taxes withheld from them. Employers must complete a Form W-2 for each employee to whom they pay a salary, wage, or other compensation {{as part of the}} employment relationship. An employer must mail out the Form W-2 to employees on or before January 31. This deadline gives these taxpayers about 3 months to prepare their returns before the April 15 income tax due date. The form is also used to report FICA taxes to the Social Security Administration. The Form W-2, along with Form W-3, generally must be filed by the employer with the Social Security Administration by the end of February. Relevant amounts on Form W-2 are reported by the Social Security Administration to the Internal Revenue Service. In territories, the W-2 is issued with a two letter code indicating which territory, such as W-2GU for Guam. If corrections are made, it can be done on a W-2c. The British-Irish equivalent form to a W-2 is a P60.|$|E

30|$|Further, I match {{individual}} auditors’ {{signatures of}} the consolidated IFRS financial statements with individual German GAAP {{balance sheet data}} of the parent company to estimate the more immediate tax relevant association between tax certified individual auditors and effective tax rates in Germany. Foreign subsidiaries’ efforts to reduce tax rates might {{be out of the}} reach of German individual auditors and distort the previously shown associations to some extent. Groups will, as already stated earlier, optimize their IFRS tax accounts to be competitive and provide information to investors. One way to do so is to optimize only <b>tax</b> <b>statements.</b> Since IFRS and tax law are not aligned in Germany, IFRS accounting earnings will not be affected by efforts to reduce tax payments but might be biased by earnings management. By contrast, German GAAP and tax law face a high book-tax conformity. Effective tax rates consistent with German GAAP will, therefore, provide measures that are closer related to tax avoidance implemented in <b>tax</b> <b>statements.</b> This holds especially as it can be assumed that German listed companies will use their individual German GAAP <b>statements</b> primarily for <b>tax</b> reasons because capital market relevant information is already provided by IFRS consolidated statements (Zinn and Spengel 2012). Earnings management can therefore be assumed to be rarely present. Moreover, most national companies within a group consolidate their accounts for tax reasons with profit transfer agreements (‘steuerliche Organschaft’) so that the profits of all German subsidiaries are still pooled in the individual German GAAP statement of the parent. These tax rates will consequently be a reflection of the group’s level of reported corporate effective tax rates in Germany.|$|R
