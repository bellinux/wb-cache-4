25|$|The collegiate wrestling season customarily {{runs from}} October or November to March. Regular season {{competition}} begins in late October or early November and continues until February.

Normally, wrestling teams from two different colleges or universities would compete in {{what is known as}} a dual meet. It is possible for there also to be a multiple dual, where more than two wrestling teams compete against each other at the same event on the same day. For example, one college wrestling team may face another wrestling team for the first dual, and <b>then</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> wrestling team for the second dual. Also, those two wrestling teams may compete against each other in a dual meet as well. Colleges and universities often compete within their particular athletic conference; though competition outside a team's conference or even outside its division within the NCAA is not uncommon.|$|E
