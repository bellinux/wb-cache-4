40|$|Climate {{change is}} a global issue {{concerning}} scientists and governments alike. Dealing with this issue {{is at the top}} of the international agenda. The primary cause of the human-induced greenhouse effect is found to be the carbon dioxide (CO 2), deriving mainly from burning fossil fuels, industrial activity and deforestation. Under the Kyoto Protocol, the EU has committed to reduce its total greenhouse gas emissions through a flexible mechanism, the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS). Here, emission allowances in the form of a new tradable asset, the European Union Allowance (EUA), can be traded in organised financial markets. Reducing effectively carbon emissions depends upon the success of such a carbon market, which requires sufficient prediction of the price behaviour. The tradable carbon credits appear to be influenced by fuel prices in the energy sector and by certain economic indicators. This thesis presents statistical models for efficient price forecasting based on the relationships between the emission spot and futures prices with energy and several industrial and economic indicators to empirically study the emission price behaviour. Due to the different Kyoto-established <b>trading</b> <b>commitment</b> phases of emission spot prices and their volatility behaviour, we propose appropriate AR–GARCH models for stochastic futures price modelling. We find that various energy and industrial variables affect the formation of the emission futures prices and should be incorporated in price forecasting models. ...|$|E

40|$|Established in 1988, the Canadian International Trade Tribunal (the "CITT") {{replaced}} the Tariff Board, the Canadian Import Tribunal and the Textile and Clothing Board. Tasked with {{the responsibilities of}} advising the government on various trade related matters, conducting injury inquiries and reviewing certain decisions of the customs department, the CITT is {{an important source of}} Canadian trade policy and jurisprudence. This paper focuses on the role the CITT has played in the development of Canadian trade jurisprudence, with particular emphasis on the CITT's material injury inquiries and its appellate review of Canada Customs' classification and valuation determinations. Placing these decisions against the background of Canada's international <b>trade</b> <b>commitments,</b> the author gives a mixed review of the CITT's performance to date. That said, the author notes that a significant proportion of the CITT's failures in this area is more accurately attributable to the statutory limitations to its jurisdiction due to the incomplete manner in which Parliament has implemented Canada's international <b>trade</b> <b>commitments</b> into domestic law...|$|R

40|$|This Working Paper {{considers}} {{the significance of}} government procurement chapters in regional trade agreements (RTAs), both {{in their own right}} and vis-à-vis the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA). The paper finds, inter alia, that: (i) a strong complementarity exists between government procurement <b>trade</b> <b>commitments</b> and general goods and services <b>trade</b> <b>commitments,</b> making integration of procurement commitments in a more general system such as the WTO Agreements desirable; (ii) government procurement chapters in RTAs, where they exist in detailed form, are modelled substantially or entirely on the WTO GPA – a fact which can facilitate eventual accession to the GPA by participating WTO Members; and (iii) the market access opportunities created by government procurement chapters in RTAs generally are less extensive than those available under the revised GPA - a factor helping to maintain incentives for eventual GPA accession by relevant WTO Members. The recent successful renegotiation of the GPA has {{set the stage for a}} broadening of its membership, over time, ensuring that the Agreement's future remains strong...|$|R

A database has revealed rather disconnected policy arrangements across APEC members in terms of service trade liberalization.

40|$|We {{show that}} new trade {{restrictions}} implemented since {{the onset of}} the global financial crisis have had — in the limited products targeted — a strong distortionary impact on trade. Their aggregate impact is modest, however, as most countries have resisted a widespread resort to protectionism.

40|$|The Technical Note {{provides}} an overview of the trends in Belize's tariff structure over recent years, in particular its <b>trade</b> policy, <b>commitments</b> and obligations, the tax revenue implications, and the scope for policy implementation. Specifically, it assesses the country's level of compliance with CARICOM commitments, such as the application of the common external tariff, and outlines and analyzes Belize's trade agreement obligations and their timing and impact with respect to fiscal incentives. It provides policy recommendations and alternatives for compliance with Belize's international <b>trade</b> <b>commitments,</b> for example with the World Trade Organization (WTO), from legislative and policy changes to further trade liberalization and fiscal measures to ensure compliance with its existing international tariff and nontariff commitments. The study considers the solution to eliminate the use of revenue replacement duties, lower all tariffs on excisable goods, and then levy an excise tax on each of the goods up to the current level imposed by import and revenue replacement duties. The study argues in favor of the elimination of the Environmental Tax, as it violates the principle of WTO national treatment in its current form, and takes into account that the export incentive programs will have to be reformed to comply with the rules of the WTO before the end of 2015. Finally, the study proposes a transformation or rationalization of the import license regime to make it more predictable, transparent, and nondiscriminatory. ...|$|R

30|$|This paper {{identifies}} how <b>trade</b> <b>commitments,</b> {{based on}} the intrinsic characteristics of the provisions or chapters in TPP and TTIP, could interact with and impact on public health in developing countries. This follows from the concerns that the haste of negotiators to conclude deep Agreements could impose ill-conceived constraints on domestic regulators’ access to medicines and has wide-ranging implications for public health policies in developing countries by feeding into domestic regulation. We analyse two interlinked policy concerns: firstly, how tariff reduction/elimination under mega-regional Agreements impacts on production of sugar, and by inference higher consumption. A second related policy area examined {{is the impact of}} mega-regional commitments, which include Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS)-like and TRIPS-plus commitments, on IP protection rules and even modification of such rules by partner countries, thus impacting the access of people in developing countries to life-saving drugs and medicines.|$|R

This is claimed to be less efficient, in terms of liberalization effects, than alternative approaches under which everything {{is considered to be}} fully committed unless specifically excluded (top-down or negative listing). However, a closer look at services negotiations conducted in various settings, including the Doha-Round process, WTO accession cases and different types of regional trade agreements, suggests that such structural issues have limited, if any, impact on the results achieved.

40|$|Some {{countries}} in the World Trade Organization initially opposed WTO's decision to exempt electronic delivery of products from customs duties, {{out of concern for}} the revenue consequences. Others supported the decision as a means of securing open trading conditions. The authors argue that neither the inhibitions nor the enthusiasm is fully justified. First, even if all delivery of digitizable media products moved on-line [...] an unlikely prospect [...] the revenue loss for most countries would be small. More important, however, the prohibition of customs duties does not ensure continued open access for electronically delivered products and may even prompt recourse to inferior instruments of protection.
