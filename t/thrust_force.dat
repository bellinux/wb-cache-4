50|$|The {{first step}} to {{deriving}} the Betz limit is applying conservation of angular momentum. As stated above the wind loses speed after the wind turbine compared to the speed {{far away from the}} turbine. This would violate the conservation of momentum if the wind turbine was not applying a <b>thrust</b> <b>force</b> on the flow. This <b>thrust</b> <b>force</b> manifests itself through the pressure drop across the rotor. The front operates at high pressure while the back operates at low pressure. The pressure difference from the front to back causes the <b>thrust</b> <b>force.</b> The momentum lost in the turbine is balanced by the <b>thrust</b> <b>force.</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an approach for the force analysis {{of an open}} TBM gripping–thrusting–regripping mechanism, which is a special parallel mechanism driven by hydraulic actuators and constrained by rocky surroundings. The static equilibrium equations of the cutterhead–mainbeam–saddle subassembly are formulated first by exploring the reaction forces in the cross pin situated between the saddle and the gripper cylinder. This is followed by formulating the static equilibrium equations of the inner closed loops formed by the above subassembly, the torque, and gripper cylinders. Consequently, the linear map between the externally applied wrench imposed on the shield and the equivalent <b>thrust</b> <b>forces</b> of the cylinders is developed. The functionality of the force model developed is twofold, i. e., {{it can be used}} either to estimate the <b>thrust</b> <b>forces</b> of the cylinders required to resist against the tunneling loads, or to predict the tunneling loads using the measured <b>thrust</b> <b>forces</b> of these cylinders, thus providing important theoretical basis for the design and control of the mechanism...|$|R

The cutting tool is a single point diamond. The workpiece material (SiC) is heated locally by a laser beam, which passes through the diamond tool tip. The workpiece is heated beyond the thermal softening point in order to study the effect of increased temperature.
