The deadly turf war resulted in Ontario's largest street-gang crackdown and prosecutions, with 75 arrests of alleged gang members on more than 600 criminal charges.|$|E

2500|$|Acting on the {{recommendations}} of the Joint Study Group, Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara advised the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) of his decision to establish the DIA in February 1961. He ordered them to develop a plan that would integrate all the military intelligence of the DoD, a move that met strong resistance from the service intelligence units, whose commanders viewed DIA as undesirable encroachment on <b>their</b> <b>turf.</b> Despite this resistance, during {{the spring and summer of}} 1961, as Cold War tensions flared over the Berlin Wall, Air Force Lieutenant General Joseph Carroll took the lead in planning and organizing this new agency. The JCS published Directive 5105.21, [...] "Defense Intelligence Agency" [...] on August 1, and DIA began operations with a handful of employees in borrowed office space on October 1, 1961.|$|E
2500|$|On Saturday 14 June 1958, Great Britain {{lost the}} first Test 25–8 at the Sydney Cricket Ground. 48 hours later the British Lions played Brisbane team, Britain won 34–29, and then {{remained}} undefeated {{throughout the rest}} of their visit to Australia. On 5 July 1958, the Lions defeated Australia 25–18 in the second test at Brisbane with only eight fit players on the pitch. Captain Alan Prescott played for 77 minutes with a broken arm, substitutions not being permitted until six years later, the match became known as [...] "Prescott's Match" [...] or [...] "the Battle of Brisbane". That lifted the tourists to clinch the series by winning the decider 40–17 in Sydney. [...] The third test win is still a record win against the Australians on <b>their</b> <b>turf.</b>|$|E

We have quite a few of your graduates out yonder laying railroad ties, as well as lawyers who have got into trouble over trust money, and army men who couldn't meet <b>their</b> <b>turf</b> debts or were a little too smart at cards. Some of them are of unexceptionable family--at least from your point of view. As a rule, they sleep packed like cattle in reeking redwood shacks, and either dress in rags or mend their own clothes. Among their companions are ranchers who can't live all the year on the produce of their half-cleared land, absconders from half the Pacific Slope cities, and runaway sailormen. The task set before them every morning would kill most of you." ...|$|E
60|$|I may add, that absurd {{practice}} of cutting turf, without any regularity; whereby great quantities of restorable land are made utterly desperate, {{many thousands of}} cattle destroyed, the turf more difficult to come at, and carry home, and less fit for burning; the air made unwholesome by stagnating pools and marshes; and the very sight of such places offensive to those who ride by. Neither should that odious custom be allowed, of cutting scraws, (as they call them) which is flaying off the green surface of the ground, to cover their cabins; or make up their ditches; sometimes in shallow soils, where all is gravel within a few inches; and sometimes in low ground, with a thin greensward, and sloughy underneath; which last turns all into bog, by this mismanagement. And, I have heard from very skilful country-men, that by these two practices in turf and scraws, the kingdom loseth some hundreds of acres of profitable land every year; besides the irreparable loss of many skirts of bogs, which have a green coat of grass, and yet are mangled for turf; and, besides the want of canals, by regular cutting, which would not only be a great convenience for bringing <b>their</b> <b>turf</b> home at an easy rate; but likewise render even the larger bogs more dry and safe, for summer pasture.|$|E
6000|$|I {{was much}} delighted {{with a person}} who hath a great estate in this kingdom, upon his {{complaints}} to me, [...] "how grievously poor England suffers by impositions from Ireland. That we convey our own wool to France {{in spite of all}} the harpies at the custom-house. That Mr. Shuttleworth, and others on the Cheshire coasts are such fools to sell us their bark at a good price for tanning our own hides into leather; with other enormities of the like weight and kind." [...] To which I will venture to add some more: [...] "That the mayoralty of this city is always executed by an inhabitant, and often by a native, which might as well be done by a deputy, with a moderate salary, whereby poor England lose at least one thousand pounds a year upon the balance. That the governing of this kingdom costs the lord lieutenant two thousand four hundred pounds a year,[13] so much net loss to poor England. That the people of Ireland presume to dig for coals in their own grounds, and the farmers in the county of Wicklow send <b>their</b> <b>turf</b> to the very market of Dublin, to the great discouragement of the coal trade at Mostyn and Whitehaven. That the revenues of the post-office here, so righteously belonging to the English treasury, as arising chiefly from our own commerce with each other, should be remitted to London, clogged with that grievous burthen of exchange, and the pensions paid out of the Irish revenues to English favourites, should lie under the same disadvantage, to the great loss of the grantees. When a divine is sent over to a bishopric here, with the hopes of five-and-twenty hundred pounds a year; upon his arrival, he finds, alas! a dreadful discount of ten or twelve per cent. A judge or a commissioner of the revenue has the same cause of complaint."--Lastly, ...|$|E
