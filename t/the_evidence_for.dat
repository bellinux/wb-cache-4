5|$|Critics of {{evolution}} commonly appeal to past scientific hoaxes {{such as the}} Piltdown Man forgery. It is argued that because scientists have been mistaken and deceived in the past about evidence for various aspects {{of evolution}}, the current evidence for evolution is likely to also be based on fraud and error. Much of <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>for</b> evolution {{has been accused of}} being fraudulent at various times, including Archaeopteryx, peppered moth melanism, and Darwin's finches; these claims have been subsequently refuted.|$|E
5|$|Dazzle {{was adopted}} by the Admiralty in the UK, and then by the United States Navy, with little evaluation. Each ship's dazzle pattern was unique to avoid making classes of ships {{instantly}} recognisable to the enemy. The result was that a profusion of dazzle schemes was tried, and <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>for</b> their success was at best mixed. So many factors were involved {{that it was impossible to}} determine which were important, and whether any of the colour schemes were effective.|$|E
5|$|Galileo's {{dispute with}} Grassi {{permanently}} alienated {{many of the}} Jesuits who had previously been sympathetic to his ideas, and Galileo {{and his friends were}} convinced that these Jesuits were responsible for bringing about his later condemnation. <b>The</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>for</b> this is at best equivocal, however.|$|E

Homeopathy is concluded {{to be completely}} ineffective: [...] "It's nothing but a placebo, despite what homeopaths say".|$|R
5|$|In 1971, Vedic scholar John Brough from Cambridge University {{rejected}} Wasson's {{theory and}} noted that the language was too vague to determine a description of Soma.

5|$|In his preface, Merrifield {{noted that}} while archaeologists {{studying}} prehistoric periods have paid increasing attention to <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>for</b> ritual and magic in the archaeological record, their counterparts working in later historical periods {{have failed to}} follow their lead. Presenting this book as a rectifier, he outlines his intentions and the study's limitations.|$|E
5|$|It {{may be that}} Óengus was {{involved}} in wars in Ireland, perhaps fighting with Áed Allán, or against him as an ally of Cathal mac Finguine. <b>The</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>for</b> such involvement is limited. There {{is the presence of}} Óengus's son Bridei at Tory Island, on the north-west coast of Donegal in 733, close to the lands of Áed Allán's enemy Flaithbertach mac Loingsig. Less certainly, the Fragmentary Annals of Ireland report the presence of a Pictish fleet from Fortriu fighting for Flaithbertach in 733 rather than against him.|$|E

5|$|Since the 18th century, {{scholars}} have occasionally put forth that Jesus {{was a political}} national messiah, but <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>for</b> this portrait is negligible.

5|$|The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) {{recommends}} yearly screening using low-dose {{computed tomography}} {{in those who}} have a total smoking history of 30 pack-years and are between 55 and 80 years old until a person has not been smoking for more than 15 years. Screening should not be done in those with other health problems that would make treatment of lung cancer if found not an option.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>for</b> an ancestral {{world of}} RNA cells and {{computer}} analysis of viral and host DNA sequences are giving {{a better understanding}} of the evolutionary relationships between different viruses and may help identify the ancestors of modern viruses. To date, such analyses have not proved which of these hypotheses is correct. However, it seems unlikely that all currently known viruses have a common ancestor, and viruses have probably arisen numerous times in the past by one or more mechanisms.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>for</b> {{auxiliary}} {{ranks and}} pay is scant: even less exists than the patchy evidence for their legionary counterparts. There {{seems to be}} some consensus, however, that the auxiliary was paid one third of what a legionary received: 300 sesterces a year (400 after the reign of the emperor Commodus). Both auxiliaries and seamen received the viaticum of 300 sesterces, although the various sources differ as to whether auxiliaries and sailors received the retirement bonus known as the honesta missio, or honorable discharge.|$|E

Cragh's resurrection was one of thirty-eightmiracles presented to the papal commissioners who in 1307 were charged with examining <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>for</b> Cantilupe's saintliness. The hanged man himself gave evidence to the commission, after which nothing more is known of him. Cantilupe was formally canonised by Pope John XXII on 17 April 1320.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of seals of Shepseskare in the oldest part of Neferefre's mortuary temple could {{indicate that the}} former also undertook construction works there. <b>The</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>for</b> such works is uncertain: these seals could have been placed on boxes which were later moved into the magazine rooms of the temple. For example, seals of Userkaf, Sahure and Neferirkare Kakai were {{also found in the}} temple, while these three pharaohs died before Neferefre's reign.|$|E

5|$|Although Æthelred {{had been}} Eardwulf's enemy, Æthelred's killers {{proved to be}} equally hostile to Eardwulf. In 798 a dux named Wada, {{who was one of}} those who had killed King Æthelred, fought with Eardwulf on Billington Moor, near Whalley, Lancashire. Wada was put to flight and may have gone into exile in Mercia. He may have hoped to restore Osbald to the throne. <b>The</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>for</b> Osbald's {{continued}} ambition is a letter that Alcuin wrote to him, probably in 798, in which Alcuin attempted to dissuade Osbald from further interventions in Northumbrian affairs. Alcuin's arguments appear to have succeeded, since Osbald is known to have become an abbot by 799 (when his death is recorded), implying that he had given up his ambitions.|$|E
5|$|Amenhotep I {{was the son}} of Ahmose I and Ahmose-Nefertari. His elder brothers, {{the crown}} prince Ahmose Sapair and Ahmose-ankh, died before him, thus {{clearing}} the way for his ascension to the throne. Amenhotep probably came to power while he was still young himself, and his mother, Ahmose-Nefertari, appears to have been regent for him for at least a short time. <b>The</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>for</b> this regency is that both he and his mother are credited with founding a settlement for workers in the Theban Necropolis at Deir el-Medina. Amenhotep took his sister Ahmose-Meritamon as his Great Royal Wife. Another wife's name, Sitkamose, is attested on a nineteenth dynasty stele.|$|E
5|$|At {{the outset}} of his reign, Caracalla {{declared}} divine support for Egyptian deity Serapisa god of healing. The Iseum et Serapeum in Alexandria was apparently renovated during Caracalla's co-rule with his father Septimius Severus. <b>The</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>for</b> this exists in two inscriptions found near the temple that appear to bear their names. Additional archaeological evidence exists for this {{in the form of}} two papyrii that have been dated to the Severan period and also two statues associated with the temple that have been dated to around 200AD. Upon Caracalla's ascension to sole ruler in 212, the imperial mint began striking coins bearing Serapis' image. This was a reflection of the god's central role during Caracalla's reign. After Geta's death, the weapon that had killed him was dedicated to Serapis by Caracalla. This was most likely done to cast Serapis into the role of Caracalla's protector from treachery.|$|E
