Civitan volunteers place boxes of mints at businesses in their community, and patrons donate money to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> candy. Volunteers collect the money, keeping some for club service projects and sending the rest to Civitan International for its charitable projects.|$|E
25|$|After the Dhuni fire is lit and prayers, bhajans, and devotional {{songs are}} sung, people line up and <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> {{sandalwood}}. In turn they dip the sandalwood stick into ghee (clarified butter) and toss {{it into the}} fire, intending the offering to represent the relinquishing of some attachment or psychological limitation that they wish to be consumed by the fire. The ritual thus symbolizes surrendering and giving up desires and limitations to God.|$|E
500|$|Inspired by Badu's {{creativity}} and their time listening to music, Chavarria added special effects and delays to the tracks by using and manipulating {{a variety of}} plug-ins and guitar pedals, subsequently reworking effects frequency and modulation parameters. Chavarria said {{they were able to}} expand on the producers' tracks rather than change them, because [...] "Erykah made this record to display to the world that there is this whole group of producers out there who are outside of the mainstream making great music." [...] Badu said of the approach, [...] "I work in layers. The first layer is the track. The second layer is the songs. The third would be the musicians who add a certain nuance. And when they play, they play like they are a sample. Or we <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> what they played, and we sample and loop it." ...|$|E

2500|$|If the 14th of Nissan {{fell on the}} Sabbath, {{the first}} group {{stationed}} itself on the mount of the Temple in Jerusalem, the second group in the [...] "ḥel," [...] {{the space between the}} Temple wall and the Temple hall, while the third group remained in the Temple court, thus awaiting the evening, when they took their lambs home and roasted them on a spit of pomegranate-wood, On all other days, they could do it before nightfall (and if the 15th of Nissan fell to be on the Sabbath they would have to). No bones might be broken either during the cooking or during the eating. The lamb was set on the table at the evening banquet (see Passover Seder), and was eaten by the assembled company after all had satisfied their appetites with the ḥagigah or other food. The sacrifice had to be consumed entirely that same evening, nothing being allowed to remain overnight. While eating it, the entire company of those who partook was obliged to remain together, and every participant had to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> the lamb at least as large as an olive. Women and girls also might take part in the banquet and eat of the sacrifice. The following benediction was pronounced before eating the lamb: [...] "Blessed be Thou, the Eternal, our God, the King of the world, who hast sanctified us by Thy commands, and hast ordained that we should eat the Passover." [...] The [...] "Hallel" [...] was recited during the meal, and when the lamb had been eaten the meaning of the custom was explained, and the story of the Exodus was told (see Passover Seder).|$|E
