5|$|Comprising {{the nascent}} motion picture genres of horror and science fiction, the {{nightmare}} picture provoked individual psychological <b>terror</b> in its horror incarnations, while embodying group sociological <b>terror</b> in its science fiction manifestations.

Frankenstein and Freaks exemplified both genres.|$|E
50|$|Night <b>terrors</b> {{in adults}} have been {{reported}} in all age ranges. Though the symptoms of night <b>terrors</b> in adolescents and adults are similar, the cause, prognosis and treatment are qualitatively different. These night <b>terrors</b> can occur each night if the sufferer does not eat a proper diet, get the appropriate amount or quality of sleep (e.g. sleep apnea), is enduring stressful events, or if he or she remains untreated. Adult night <b>terrors</b> are much less common, and often respond to treatments to rectify causes of poor quality or quantity of sleep. Night <b>terrors</b> are classified as a mental and behavioral disorder in the ICD. A study done about night <b>terrors</b> in adults showed that other psychiatric symptoms were prevalent in most patients experiencing night <b>terrors</b> hinting at the comorbidity of the two. There is some evidence of a link between night <b>terrors</b> and hypoglycemia.|$|R

50|$|In {{children}} with night <b>terrors,</b> {{there is no}} increased occurrence of psychiatric diagnoses. However, in adults who suffer from night <b>terrors</b> there is a close association with psychopathology or mental disorders. There may be an increased occurrence of night terrors—particularly among those suffering or having suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). It is also likely that some personality disorders may occur in individuals with night <b>terrors,</b> such as dependent, schizoid, and borderline personality disorders. There have been some symptoms of depression and anxiety that have increased in individuals that have suffered from frequent night <b>terrors.</b> Low blood sugar is associated with both pediatric and adult night <b>terrors.</b> A study of adults with thalamic lesions {{of the brain and}} brainstem have been occasionally associated with night <b>terrors.</b> Night <b>terrors</b> are closely linked to sleepwalking and frontal lobe epilepsy.|$|R

50|$|Night <b>terrors</b> {{typically}} {{occur in}} {{children between the}} ages of three and twelve years, with a peak onset in children aged three and a half years old.An estimated 1-6% of children experience night <b>terrors.</b> Boys and girls of all ethnic backgrounds are affected equally.
