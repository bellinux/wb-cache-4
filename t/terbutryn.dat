30|$|The AIS <b>terbutryn</b> {{experiment}} {{investigated the}} effects of late-autumn herbicide exposure on early life stages of the grazer R. semicolorata. As expected for an herbicide and observed in the previous experiments, <b>terbutryn</b> directly affected the aufwuchs community [12, 52]. Overall, aufwuchs biomasses remained low compared to the previous experiments [12, 36, 52], {{probably due to the}} low-light availability in autumn and reduced water temperatures used in the present study. Nevertheless, a clear concentration–response of <b>terbutryn</b> with the aufwuchs biomass in terms of POC and Chlorophyll a was observed during the exposure period. Using the AUC, as suggested by Brust et al. [12], revealed apparent effects of <b>terbutryn</b> starting at 4.72  µg L− 1 for Chlorophyll a and 0.38  µg L− 1 for the aufwuchs POC content, which is in line with the former <b>terbutryn</b> studies [52]—LOEC 6  µg L− 1; [12]—LOEC 0.43  µg L− 1; [21, 23]—LOEC[*]<[*] 10  µg L− 1).|$|E
30|$|As {{discussed}} in Rybicki et al. [52], no acute toxicity of <b>terbutryn</b> in the investigated concentration range on the grazer R. semicolorata was expected, which {{was confirmed by}} low mortality of <[*] 10 % in all the treatments. Nevertheless, sub lethal effects of <b>terbutryn</b> on grazers cannot be excluded. Different studies reported sub lethal effects of <b>terbutryn</b> and other triazine herbicides, e.g., on physiological or behavioural endpoints in vertebrates and invertebrates at very low concentrations [57, 63]. However, reported sub lethal effects especially on invertebrates always coincided with increased mortality in those studies, which was {{not found in the}} present study. Nevertheless, clear concentration–response relationships of different grazer endpoints with the <b>terbutryn</b> concentration were found in the present experiment probably caused by indirect effects rather than direct toxicity.|$|E
30|$|Using the {{herbicide}} <b>terbutryn</b> {{as representative}} of this pesticide class, our first hypothesis was that environmentally relevant concentrations of <b>terbutryn</b> are able to affect {{the development of the}} early life stages of R. semicolorata negatively, due to food shortage and reduced food quality. Table  6 summarizes the deduced effect concentrations from this experiment, which clearly show the indirect effects of <b>terbutryn</b> on grazers as initially hypothesized. These data, together with environmental concentrations, have to be implemented to a risk assessment to estimate the impact on grazers in the environment.|$|E
30|$|In the AIS experiment, the {{analysis}} of <b>terbutryn</b> in the control revealed a concentration below the limit of detection. The nominal concentrations of <b>terbutryn</b> in treatments 0.06, 0.6, and 6  µg L− 1 have been achieved well 1  h after application. In treatment 0.006, only traces of <b>terbutryn</b> were quantified, due to the low intended concentration, which was already {{at the beginning of}} the experiment below the calculated limit of detection of the analytical method. <b>Terbutryn</b> showed slow and concentration dependent dissipation from the water phase with DT 50 values between 63 and 168  days− 1. Dissipation was expected, due to the results of the previous experiments [12, 41, 52]. However, the reduced aufwuchs biomass in the AIS experiment decreased the dissipation by a factor of 2 – 6 from expected 28  day− 1 to the observed times. Hence, calculated effective concentrations were 85 % of the initial concentration in treatment 6 or at least 68 % in treatment 0.06. A stable exposure of all organisms during the entire <b>terbutryn</b> experiment was herewith realised. An impact of <b>terbutryn</b> on the water chemistry as observed at high concentrations by Brust et al. [12] was not evident. The determined physicochemical characteristics of the water were in a range of former micro- and mesocosm experiments [12, 36, 52] and suitable for aufwuchs and grazers.|$|E
30|$|The first {{experiment}} {{performed in}} autumn/winter investigated {{the effects of}} environmentally relevant concentrations of the herbicide <b>terbutryn.</b> In previous studies, it was already shown that <b>terbutryn</b> affects {{the quantity and quality}} of aufwuchs [12, 52]. Moreover, negative impacts affecting the physiological fitness of the grazer R. semicolorata were found, due to indirect effects [52]. The present study increased the complexity of the experimental design by including further environmental stressors like stream velocity and further endpoints like grazer drift into the effect analysis. The hypothesis was that environmentally relevant concentrations of <b>terbutryn</b> are able to affect the development of early life stages of R. semicolorata negatively, due to food shortage and reduced food quality.|$|E
30|$|<b>Terbutryn</b> [2 -(tert-butylamino)- 4 -(ethylamino)- 6 -(methylthio)- 1, 3, 5 -Triazin; CAS: 886 - 50 - 0] (Dr. Ehrenstorfer GmbH, Germany, 98 % purity), a {{synthetic}} herbicide {{of the group}} of symmetric triazines, was used as herbicide in the AIS experiment. It was used as an herbicide against floating aquatic plants [41, 42] and for weed protection in agriculture [48]. Although <b>terbutryn</b> lost approval for use as agricultural herbicide in Germany in 2003 (European Commission Regulation 2076 / 2002), it has recently been found with concentrations up to 5.6  µL− 1 in German surface waters [12, 48]; ARGE [5]. Furthermore, it is still used as a biocide in Germany according to EU directive 98 / 8 /EG, e.g., in antifouling paints and coatings and is, therefore, still relevant. <b>Terbutryn</b> inhibits the photosystem II by binding on the plastoquinone-binding domain in the thylakoid membrane and thus prevents the electron transport from the photosystem to plastoquinone [60]. <b>Terbutryn</b> has a log KOW of 3.5 and is stable against hydrolysis at a pH range of 5 – 9. The water solubility is 25  mg L− 1 (20  °C).|$|E
30|$|Finally, the {{triglyceride}} contents as {{marker of}} the physiological condition of grazers [33, 68] were determined {{at the end}} of the exposure. All larvae in the <b>terbutryn</b> treatments developed a lower triglyceride content compared to the control. However, for the interpretation, the large standard error of the control must be considered. Only treatment 6, which developed only one-third of the value compared to the control, showed a distinct reduction and thus strong indication of starvation induced by <b>terbutryn.</b> This matches well with the reduced growth of grazers as well as the reduced aufwuchs biomass in this treatment (Table 6). A reduction of triglyceride levels as indirect effect of <b>terbutryn</b> has been observed in the previous experiments, too. Rybicki et al. [52] have determined an LOECTG of 0.21  µg L− 1, which is in a similar range as in the present experiment, showing that triglyceride contents are very sensitive endpoints of grazers.|$|E

40|$|Abstract]Few data {{exist on}} {{potential}} toxic effects that pollutants {{may have on}} zooplankton fed microalgae exposed to pesticides. For that reason, microalgal cultures were exposed to different concentrations of the triazine herbicide <b>terbutryn,</b> and used as exclusive food source to Brachionus sp. females, with the aim to evaluate potential deleterious effects upon population growth, survival, reproduction and feeding of the rotifer. Chlorella vulgaris cells were able to accumulate <b>terbutryn,</b> removing more than 90 % of {{the total amount of}} herbicide in all the exposed cultures. Growth curves of Brachionus sp. showed that population density decreased as <b>terbutryn</b> concentration increased in the microalgal cells. In fact, this species of rotifer did not survive beyond four days when fed with microalgae exposed to 500 nM <b>terbutryn.</b> Percentage of reproductive females in rotifer populations fed with terbutryn-exposed microalgae decreased significantly as herbicide concentration increased. In control cultures, reproductive females laid a maximum of three eggs per individual; whereas in 100 nM cultures, reproductive females laid only one egg per individual throughout the treatment period. <b>Terbutryn</b> accumulated in C. vulgaris provoked a decrease in the feeding rate ofBrachionus sp. cultures fed with these microalgae with respect to control cultures. After this treatment period, all the rotifer populations, except those fed with 500 nM terbutryn-exposed microalgae, showed recovery patterns when they were returned to fresh medium containing herbicide-free microalga. Taking into account the results obtained, uptake of pesticides by phytoplankton can directly affect higher trophic levels.

40|$|Abstract]Very {{little is}} known about growth and {{proliferation}} in relation to the cell cycle regulation of algae. The lack of knowledge is even greater when referring to the potential toxic effects of pollutants on microalgal cell division. To assess the effect of <b>terbutryn,</b> a triazine herbicide, on the proliferation of the freshwater microalga Chlorella vulgaris three flow cytometric approaches were used: (1) in vivo cell division using 5 -, 6 -carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE) staining was measured, (2) the growth kinetics were determined by cytometric cell counting and (3) cell viability was evaluated with the membrane-impermeable double-stranded nucleic acid stain propidium iodide (PI). The results obtained in the growth kinetics study using CFSE to identify the microalgal cell progeny were consistent with those determined by cytometric cell counting. In all C. vulgaris cultures, each mother cell had undergone only one round of division through the 96 h of assay and the cell division occurred during the dark period. Cell division of the cultures exposed to the herbicide was asynchronous. <b>Terbutryn</b> altered the normal number of daughter cells (4 autospores) obtained from each mother cell. The number was only two in the cultures treated with 250 nM. The duration of the lag phase after the exposure to <b>terbutryn</b> could be dependent on the existence of a critical cell size to activate cytoplasmic division. Cell size, complexity and fluorescence of chlorophyll a of the microalgal cells presented a marked light/dark (day/night) cycle, except in the non-dividing 500 nM cultures, where <b>terbutryn</b> arrested cell division {{at the beginning of the}} cycle. Viability results showed that <b>terbutryn</b> has an algastatic effect in C. vulgaris cells at this concentration. The rapid and precise determination of cell proliferation by CFSE staining has allowed us to develop a model for assessing both the cell cycle of C. vulgaris and the in vivo effects of pollutants on growth and reproduction at microalgal cell level.

40|$|The {{worldwide}} use of triazines as pesticides {{has resulted}} in their widespread occurrence in groundwater. Within the northern boreal region in Southern Finland, 30 % of groundwater sampling points contained pesticides, and acceptable drinking water limits were exceeded in 11 %.

However, their effects on separate microorganisms, and the genetic basis of these responses, are not well documented. The aim of this thesis was to isolate and characterize atrazine-degrading microorganisms, and to find appropriate microbial, physicochemical, and nutritional demands for pesticide degradation. Microbial community composition was studied in farmland, forested farmland, and primary forest soils by pyrosequencing and in gardens, groundwater deposits, and vadose zone sediments by cultivation on mineral medium with atrazine or <b>terbutryn</b> as the nitrogen source. Atrazine dissipation efficiency was additionally compared under stagnant and circulating water conditions. The dominant phyla that increased in atrazine-treated farmland, gardens, deposits, and sediments were Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria. The overlap in genera was less than in phyla, while the isolated Pseudomonas strains only slightly overlapped between isolates from surface soils and subsurface deposits and sediments. Atrazine dissipation was better in circulating than in stagnant water, and aerobic microbes from genera known to have atrazine degradation genes, all from phyla Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria, were simultaneously enriched,. Based on the results, the application of microbial remediation of atrazine and <b>terbutryn</b> requires special attention to soil physicochemical properties and selection of proper microbial strains.

Considering that cyanobacteria reduce the nutritional value of the aufwuchs for grazers, due to production of toxins, digestion-resistant cell walls, low unsaturated fatty acid contents, and their often filamentous growth form [1, 22, 40], further negative effects on grazers development seem possible.|$|E

IC 50 values were measured with electron transfer inhibitors of the triazine, triazinone, phenol and urea classes. The mutant T 4 {{is the first}} purple bacterium known so far, which is highly sensitive to the plant herbicide DCMU (3 -(3, 4 -dichlorphenyl) - 1, 1 -dimethyl-urea, also known as diuron).

30|$|Although <b>terbutryn</b> is {{currently}} not approved in agricultural (European Council Directive 91 / 414 /EEC, European Commission Regulation 2076 / 2002), {{it is still}} regularly detected in German surface waters, due to the use as biocide in antifouling paints or as protection agent for fibres and textiles (EU directive 98 / 8 /EG). The environmental quality standard of 0.34  µg L− 1 (2013 / 39 /EU) is thereby punctually exceeded and maximum concentrations reported achieve up to 5.6  µg L− 1 in Hesse [48] and more recently up to 1.9  µg L− 1 in the Free State of Saxony (2011, Surface water monitoring of the Federal Agency for Environment, Agriculture and Geology, Saxony). From a regulatory point of view, using 1.9  µg L− 1 as Measured Environmental Concentration and the lowest NOECDrift of 0.04  µg L− 1 for the calculation of the Toxicity Exposure Ration (TER) results in a quotient of 0.02. This indicates a clear risk of <b>terbutryn</b> for the grazer R. semicolorata in the environment and supports our first hypothesis. Considering the broad usage of herbicides in agriculture (33 % of spread pesticides in Europe; Eurostats, Pesticide sales Reg. 1185 / 2009), e.g., glyphosate, metazachlor, and others, indicates a general risk and threat of this substance class for the aquatic ecosystems and specifically for grazers, which {{is in line with}} the observations of Schaefer et al. [53] for large rivers in north Germany.|$|E
30|$|Mass {{balances}} {{were calculated}} for test specimens after outdoor exposure (see Table  4). Part of the active substances was transported from the coatings into the wooden substrate, probably depending on water solubility of the observed substances (see water solubility data in Table  2). The differences between the original amounts of active substances and the amounts detected in the runoff samples and the test specimens are high. This indicates that additional processes also control the fate of diuron, OIT and <b>terbutryn.</b> Evaporation and degradation are assumed {{to contribute to the}} fate and behaviour of these substances in the environment. In contrast, the original amount of carbendazim was almost completely detected in the runoff and the test specimens after outdoor exposure of the impregnated textile. Obviously, carbendazim in the piece of impregnated textile is less affected by competing processes. Leaching of carbendazim from pieces of the impregnated textile was relatively high. This was unexpected since leaching of carbendazim from paints and renders was observed to be relatively low, i.e. in the range of data for <b>terbutryn</b> [2, 10]. It was assumed that the textile impregnation itself is affected by water contact and UV radiation. Both effects were demonstrated in laboratory tests. Water repellency was decreasing, and water uptake was increasing after exposure to water, and leaching of carbendazim increased after artificial UV radiation of the impregnated textile [8].|$|E
40|$|Tests were {{conducted}} during 1984 - 85 season at two experimental sites near Riyadh {{to evaluate the}} efficiency of some post-emergence herbicides in the control of weeds in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The experimental sites were of loamy sand soil and were under sprinkler irrigation. The herbicides included bentazon, bromoxynil, chlortoluron, 2, 4 -D, dichlorprop, diclofop-methyl, difenzoquat, isop-roturon, MCP A, metoxuron, <b>terbutryn</b> {{and some of their}} combinations. The bromoxynil-contained treatments (Brominal plus, Buctril M, Pardner and Brominal, each at 2. 5 l/ha) were effective in controlling broad-leaved weeds, improved wheat growth and yield besides being safe and selective. Bentazonldichlorprop (Basagran DP, at 1. 51 /ha) was almost similar in many aspects to those contained bromoxynil, but did not appreciably improve the wheat biological or grain yield. Dic-lofop- methyl (IlIoxane) and difenzoquat (Avenge) each at 4. 0 1 /ha, showed effective control for grasses, and insignificantly improved the wheat growth and yield. Slight symptoms of crop phytotoxicity appeared after their application, but rapidly recovered. 2, 4 -DIMCP A (U- 46 fluid Combi, at 1. 0 l/ha) showed good control of broad-leaved weeds with slight symptoms of crop phytotoxicity and did not improve the wheat growth or yield. Isoproturon (Graminon, at 5 kg/ha), metoxuron (Dosanex, at 4. 0 kg/ha), chlortoluron/ MCPA (Dicuran MA 60, at 2. 5 kg/ha), chlortoluron (Dicuran, at 2. 5 kg/ha) and <b>terbutryn</b> (Igran, at 2. 5 kg/ha) showed excellent control of weeds, accompanied by severe symptoms of crop phytotoxicity, that adversely affected wheat growth and yield...|$|E
30|$|Materials {{and methods}} Eight {{biocides}} used in resin based facade coatings were investigated. Some biocides are substances known as pesticides for agricultural purposes like diuron, carbendazim and <b>terbutryn.</b> Ecotoxicological effect values for aquatic organisms were determined for every biocide. Leaching of four biocides from a render under UV-irradiation {{has been investigated}} in the laboratory including the influence of varying temperatures. Using 80 irrigation intervals over 28 days, facade runoff was sampled and followed by biocide chemical analysis. The total losses were calculated based on the concentration patterns. These data were used for modelling the transport of cybutryn from facades to surface waters. Biocide specific effect values and leaching characteristics have been taken into consideration.|$|E
3000|$|Results Acute {{and chronic}} effect values {{as well as}} {{predicted}} no effect concentrations for the investigated biocides indicate their high potential to affect aquatic organisms. The leaching of four biocides (diuron, [...] <b>terbutryn,</b> cybutryn, carbendazim) from the facade render under the experimental conditions delivers high concentrations in the beginning followed by an exponential decrease. Rising temperature increased the concentration of biocides in the runoff. The total losses were between 7 [*]% and 29 [*]% depending on the substances. More {{than half of the}} losses occur in the runoff within the first 15 min of runoff from a 60 min irrigation cycle. The modelling result for cybutryn underlines its high environmental risk for small surface waters.|$|E
40|$|AbstractCells of the {{photosynthetic}} bacterium Rhodospirillum rubrum were rendered resistant {{against the}} inhibitor 2 -(1 -phenyl) ethylamino- 3 -propionylamino- 4 -cyano-thiazole (PPCTH). Electron transport in reaction centers prepared {{from one of}} the mutants (M 6) was neither inhibited by PPCTH and other NH-thiazoles nor <b>terbutryn.</b> These inhibitors are known to bind at the QB site of the L-subunit. Compared to the wild type, chromatophores from M 6 exhibited strongly altered QB−Fe 2 + and QA−Fe 2 + EPR signals. Inhibitor resistance is due to a mutation in the bacterial reaction center M-subunit, where Glu 234 is exchanged against Lys. This is the first example of an inhibitor resistance in the QB site caused by a mutation in the M-subunit...|$|E

40|$|Rapid, simple, and {{low-cost}} {{screening procedures}} {{are necessary for}} the detection of harmful compounds in the effluent that flows out of point sources such as industrial outfall. The present study investigated the effects on a novel sensor of harmful compounds such as KCN, phenol, and herbicides such as 3 -(3, 4 -dichlorophenyl) - 1, 1 -dimethylurea (DCMU), 2 -chloro- 4 -ethylamino- 6 -isopropylamino- 1, 3, 5 -triazine (atrazine), and 2 -N-tert-butyl- 4 -N-ethyl- 6 -methylsulfanyl- 1, 3, 5 -triazine- 2, 4 -diamine (<b>terbutryn).</b> The sensor employed an electrode system that incorporated the photocurrent of intra-cytoplasmic membranes (so-called chromatophores) prepared from photosynthetic bacteria and linked using carbon paste electrodes. The amperometric curve (photocurrent-time curve) of photo-induced electron transfer from chromatophores of the purple photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides to the electrode via an exogenous electron acceptor was composed of two characteristic phases: an abrupt increase in current immediately after illumination (I 0), and constant current over time (Ic). Compared with other redox compounds, 2, 5 -dichloro- 1, 4 -benzoquinone (DCBQ) was the most useful exogenous electron acceptor in this system. Photo-reduction of DCBQ exhibited Michaelis-Menten-like kinetics, and reduction rates were dependent on the amount of DCBQ and the photon flux intensity. The Ic decreased in the presence of KCN at concentrations over 0. 05 μM (=μmol·dm− 3). The I 0 decreased following the addition of phenol at concentrations over 20 μM. The Ic was affected by <b>terbutryn</b> at concentrations over 10 μM. In contrast, DCMU and atrazine had no effect on either I 0 or Ic. The utility of this electrode system {{for the detection of}} harmful compounds is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1973 Studies were {{initiated}} {{to determine the}} response of two common groundsel biotypes (Senecio vulgaris L.) to several s-triazine herbicides. Herbicides tested were: 2 -chloro- 4, 6 -bis(ethylamino) -striazine (simazine), 2 -chloro- 4 -(ethylamino) - 6 -(isopropylamino) - s-triazine (atrazine) 2 -(sec-butylamino) - 4 -(ethylamino) - 6 -methoxys- triazine (GS- 14254), 2, 4 -bis(isopropylamino) - 6 -methoxy-striazine (prometone), 2 -(tert-butylamino) - 4 -(ethylamino) - 6 -methylthio- s-triazine (<b>terbutryn),</b> and 2, 4 -bis(isopropylamino) - 6 - methylthio-s-triazine (prometryne). One biotype was much more susceptible than the other. Sensitive plants were effectively controlled by 0. 5 ppm of atrazine and simazine, 1 ppm of GS- 14254 and prometone, and 4 ppm of prometryne. The resistant biotype failed to show any symptoms of photosynthesis inhibition at the highest rates tested, i. e. 4 ppm of simazine and 30 ppm for atrazine, GS- 14254, prometone, and prometryne. Both biotypes were resistant to <b>terbutryn</b> at 30 ppm. When a triazine herbicide was applied, the susceptible plants became chlorotic and died; resistant plants never exhibited these symptoms. Photosynthesis was completely inhibited by simazine in susceptible (S) plants but resistant (R) plants were unaffected. Photosynthesis in the susceptible biotype resumed when the herbicide was removed after 24 hours. Absorption and metabolism of simazine were explored as possible explanations for the herbicide tolerance exhibited by the R biotype. Both biotypes absorbed the herbicide equally well, and no differences in simazine metabolism were found which could explain the mechanism of resistance. Plants of both biotypes were subjected to ¹⁴C-simazine for up to 96 hours. The greatest concentration of ¹⁴C activity (80 to 90...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. An {{electrochemical}} DNA-biosensor {{has been}} used to investigate the interactions between DNA and members of a group of ten derivatives of 1, 3, 5 -triazine herbicides: chloro-s-triazines (atrazine, propazine, terbutylazin, and cyanazin), thiomethyl-s-triazines (ametryn, prometryn, <b>terbutryn,</b> and simetryn), and methoxy-s-triazines (prometon and terbumeton). A UV spectrophotometric study of this group of herbicides was also undertaken. Of this group only cyanazin could be oxidized in aqueous solution using a glassy carbon electrode. Use of the electrochemical DNA-biosensor revealed the occurrence of a time-dependent interaction of all the herbicides with DNA, via the appearance of guanine, guanosine, and adenosine oxidation signals that correspond to DNA damage. Adduct formation between the herbicide and the DNA purine bases guanine and adenine is suggested as a mechanism...|$|E
