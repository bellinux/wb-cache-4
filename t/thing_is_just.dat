[...] A real <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> that which forces the rest of the universe to in some way conform to it; that is to say, if theoretically a thing made strictly no difference to any other entity (i.e. it was not related to any other entity), it could not be said to really exist. [...] Relations are not secondary to what a thing is, they are what the thing is.|$|E

Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter said that the {{relationship}} between Pitt and Affleck [...] "gets smothered in pointlessly long takes, repetitive scenes, grim Western landscapes and mumbled, heavily accented dialogue."

[...] Strauss also said, [...] "Every element of this Western is beautifully rendered. So why is it a chore to sit through?"

He wrote that [...] "the look of the <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> the delivery system, though there are some striking images and even the occasional striking piece of 'acting'". He described the animation as looking [...] "fairly cheap"; however, he complemented the [...] "soft, pastel-colored style that blunts the obnoxiousness of some of the jokes without blurring out the edge", he stated, that contrasts the style of Adult Swim programs. Jason Zinoman of The New York Times called the series [...] "gleefully deranged", stating the writing of the series [...] "threatens to but never quite tips over into the overwritten cleverness of so much television comedy these days." [...] He compared the art style of the series to South Park, calling it [...] "more lifelike [...] but not by much." ...|$|E

60|$|From {{this point}} of view let me remind you that books are not the {{products}} of accident and caprice. As Goethe said, if you would understand an author, you must understand his age. The same <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> as true of a book. If you would fully comprehend it, you must know the age. There is an order; there are causes and relations between great compositions and the societies in which they have emerged. Just as the naturalist strives to understand and to explain the distribution of plants and animals over the surface of the globe, to connect their presence or their absence with the great geological, climatic, and oceanic changes, so the student of literature, if he be wise, undertakes an ordered and connected survey of ideas, of tastes, of sentiments, of imagination, of humour, of invention, as they affect and as they are affected by the ever changing experiences of human nature, and the manifold variations that time and circumstances are incessantly working in human society.|$|E
