50|$|In May 2014, Qatar {{announced}} its intentions {{to reform the}} labor laws and to abolish the kafala system. A new law, titled Law No. 21 on the Entry, Exit and Residency of Foreign Nationals replacing the 2009 Sponsorship Law, was adopted in 2015 and entered into force in December 2016. The aim {{of the new law}} was enhancing the rights and protection of migrant workers, although the law has been criticized for insufficiently enhancing migrant worker protection. According to Amnesty International, the new law still requires migrant workers to obtain their employer’s permission <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>employment</b> or to leave Qatar. Furthermore, even after completion of the labor contract, the migrant worker wishing to find employment elsewhere in Qatar will need permission from “the competent authority”, {{as well as from the}} Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, without the law specifying who is meant by the competent authority. The law also prohibits migrant workers from establishing labor unions or organizing strikes. Additionally, in 2015, the Qatari government {{announced its}} plan to set up an electronic contract system, in which workers can find their labor contract which would be available in ten different languages.|$|E
50|$|In the United Arab Emirates, the kafala {{system was}} part of the 1980 Federal Law on the Regulation of Labour Relations, which {{regulated}} the relationship between the state, the sponsor and the sponsored. The law did not require any written contract to be drawn up between the employer and the migrant worker. Migrant workers required the permission of their employers <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>employment</b> and the provided sponsorship could not be transferred to another employer. The 1980 Law did regulate issues such as severance pay, repatriation pay, annual leave, standards for maximum working hours and working conditions, payment for overtime and the payment for treatment of labor-related injuries. However, the law also prohibited labor unions and strikes. Labor law reforms were introduced in the UAE in 2016, which included a standardized offer letter prepared by the UAE’s Ministry of Labor, a standardized work contract which must specify duration, nature of the work, place of employment, wages and remuneration. The changes also specify working hours as 8 hours per day or 48 hours per week. However, these working hours could be higher for those working in the service industry. Furthermore, migrant workers are allowed to change employers after six months and only if their employer consents, or if employment is not provided or if a legal complaint of some sort is issued. Both parties can agree to end the employment contract after six months. According to the reforms, contracts must be made available in both Arabic, English and a third language if required. Employers who fail to provide translations are subjected to fines.|$|E

The author chose a pair of banking companies. The first step was using internal resources {{in order to determine the}} turnover rate, the survival rate and the stability index.

This study investigates what influences a strong or weak employer brand has on the preference for total rewards. The results should assist remuneration agents in appropriately leveraging the company’s employer brand value, as a factor, when compiling a total rewards package for potential employees. A questionnaire was developed, asking participants to indicate their preferences relating to total rewards {{in the context of}} their current employer, with regard to stronger and weaker employer brands. Results of the study indicate that potential employees would require financial reward increases in the range of 15 % - 30 % in order <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>employment,</b> irrespective of whether it is perceived as a strong or weak employer brand. It was observed that a stronger employer brand could offer increases closer to the bottom of the range compared to weaker employer brands which would have to pay a premium to the top end of the range Employer brand value appears to increase the total reward costs for companies, irrespective of how the brand is perceived. It is however beneficial to be viewed as a strong employer brand, as the value of this perception translates to a smaller premium compared to weaker employer brands.

The Caregiver Perspective on Paediatric ADHD (CAPPA) survey was conducted to evaluate the burden associated with ADHD in Europe and to identify unmet needs. Here, we describe sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, treatment use and impact of ADHD. MethodsThe cross-sectional web-based CAPPA survey was fielded in 10 European countries among caregivers of children/adolescents (aged 6 – 17 years) with ADHD who were currently receiving or had received pharmacotherapy in the previous 6 months. ResultsData on 3688 completed CAPPA surveys were evaluated. Children/adolescents were diagnosed with ADHD at {{a mean age of}} 6. 9 years; 80 % were male. Most children/adolescents (56 %) had undergone behavioural therapy. Overall, 78 % of children/adolescents currently received ADHD pharmacotherapy; high rates of atypical antipsychotic use were reported in some countries. Overall, 23 % of children/adolescents had repeated a school year and 4 % had been expelled recently. Most caregivers (68 – 88 %) reported difficulty with schoolwork, social interactions/activities and family relationships, even when the child/adolescent was receiving ADHD medication. Almost one third (31 %) of caregivers felt the need <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>employment</b> status despite their child/adolescent receiving ADHD medication in 53 % of these cases. LimitationsInformation was reported by caregivers recruited through market research panels; reporting, recall and selection biases may be present. ConclusionVariation across Europe was observed in characteristics of caregivers and children/adolescents with ADHD, and treatment use. Even with medication, ADHD compromised or negatively impacted caregivers’ work and children/adolescents’ schoolwork, their social interactions and family relationships...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to identify factors which influence decisions concerning significant career moves among older workers and women returners. A questionnaire survey of older workers was conducted in order to elicit the salient attitudes to, experience of, and satisfaction with work of job changers and non-changers aged 50 years and over, employed within a nationwide retail organisation. Results were based on 228 questionnaires. Respondents ranged in age from 50 to 73 years, 54 % were female, 46 % male. Respondents demonstrated a significant increase in self-perception the perceived benefits of working far outweighed perceived difficulties. There were {{differences between men and women}} in the prompts <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>employment</b> and in salient attitudes to work. A questionnaire survey of women returners was conducted to explore items women considered when embarking on college courses, their experience of these same items while at college, and the relationship between the decision considerations and subjective well-being. The results of 336 questionnaires were analysed. Respondents ranged in age from 16 to 62 years. The expected benefits of attending college were given greater consideration than expected risks, confirming work by Janis and Mann (1977). Actual benefits and actual problems were overall the most useful predictors of college related well-being. There were differences between young and mature students, women with and without partners, and those with and without dependents in terms of items on the motivator for college attendance, expected benefit and risk and actual benefit and problem scales. The Warr Subjective Well Being (SWB) scale was shown to be a reliable measure of college related well-being. The wide age range and life experience of respondents in both studies confirms the utility of life event models of development and the desirability of developing a flexible person-centred counselling model for decision making...|$|E
40|$|Lawyers often leave a {{practice}} setting {{and move to}} a new practice as their career paths advance or change. The incidence of lawyer migration has increased dramatically in the past decade, as law firms recruit more lateral hires and offer fewer partnership opportunities to their associates. As a lawyer prepares <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>employment</b> settings, her prospective new law firm asks her about the clients she has represented in the past. The new law firm must insist on this information, for without it the firm could not screen for possible conflicts of interest. Were the firm to hire a lawyer without such conflict screening, the new lawyer 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 taint 2 ̆ 2 could disqualify the firm from important and lucrative work, and cause great harm to its clients. At the same time, the migrating lawyer owes her clients a strong confidentiality obligation under the Model Rules of Professional Conduct and the law of lawyering. When the prospective new firm asks for information about her clients, the lawyer faces a delicate quandary. Her career interests and her respect for the new firm 2 ̆ 7 s conflict policies demand that she provide the requested information; her confidentiality duties seem to require her not to reveal her client 2 ̆ 7 s information without their permission. Seeking such permission is often impossible or impractical. This Article investigates this difficult and widespread ethical issue. It begins by identifying five types of information which a new law firm is likely to want from a prospective hire, including information about the prior firm 2 ̆ 7 s work but also financial data regarding the lawyer 2 ̆ 7 s client billings. It then looks carefully at the Model Rules, the Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers, and other authority for insights about which disclosures are lawful and which are not. It concludes that the available authority in fact permits surprisingly little information sharing, but argues that the authority ought to permit carefully defined disclosures which will not present hardships or embarrassment to the migrating lawyer 2 ̆ 7 s clients. The Article offers distinctions in information-sharing which can protect the moving lawyer 2 ̆ 7 s client confidences while allowing law firms to protect their clients 2 ̆ 7 interests, and offers protocols for performing conflict checks when a lawyer cannot reveal her client 2 ̆ 7 s identities without causing them some harm. Finally, the Article offers several discrete changes to the Model Rules, which if adopted would provide clarity to lawyers and law firms engaged in the lateral hiring process...|$|E
