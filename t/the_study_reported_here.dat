The penguins now have to commute about 65 km between colonies where they breed and the sea where they can feed. Many fewer penguins are now returning to the colonies to attempt to breed and of those that do return most fail to rear their chicks. We found hundreds of abandoned eggs and thousands of dead chicks. We did not suggest that thousands of adult penguins have died as some media reports suggest. In fact it is unlikely many if any adult penguins have {{died as a result of}} this stranding event. We found very few, perhaps no pre-breeding birds at Cape Denison and, if as we predict, few if any young birds prospecting for a place to breed in future are visiting these colonies the local colonies could become extinct within the breeding life of an Adelie penguins (<16 years) if young birds do not replace the old established breeders as they come to the end of their lives." ...|$|E
5000|$|Cape Denison once {{supported}} a large colony of Adélie penguins with perhaps 150,000 members. In 2010, a large 20iceberg trapped the colony, making {{access to the}} sea difficult and threatening {{the lives of all}} the penguins. By 2013, only 10,000 remained and by 2016, they were reported in danger of being [...] "wiped out". [...] Media reports were exaggerated however and in response, the authors released this update: [...] "It is important to recognise that this study focuses on the Adélie penguin colonies at Cape Denison and the MacKellar Islets, which has been well known, and importantly, well studied over the past century. <b>The</b> <b>study</b> <b>reported</b> <b>here</b> identified that the impact of the iceberg B09B on the penguins since 2010.
