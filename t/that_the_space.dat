5|$|The {{basis for}} TrollSat was an {{agreement}} signed in 2006 between the Norwegian Polar Institute, the Norwegian Space Centre and Kongsberg Satellite Services. It specified <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Space</b> Centre would install a Kongsberg-built radome, while the Polar Institute would provide power and undertake maintenance. In exchange, they could freely use the earth station {{for their own}} transmission needs. The commercial activities would {{be carried out by}} Kongsberg Satellite Services. A concern was raised regarding if satellite downloading would violate the Antarctic Treaty, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs negated. The station started operations on 1 March 2007 and was officially opened by Prime Minister of Norway, Jens Stoltenberg.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, Norman broke a hip and {{her health}} began to decline. Although she {{had promised to}} live until 2001, her deteriorating {{condition}} made her followers suspect she would die before then, causing them some distress and denial. In an attempt to help her recover, students used past-life regression to recall interactions with her, and some became very emotional after experiencing memories of events {{in which they had}} rejected and hurt her. Norman returned to leading services in February 1989, making a quicker than expected recovery, which was attributed to the past-life rituals. After a period of good health, her condition again deteriorated, prompting students to resume recounting their past crimes. Norman lost most of her hearing and experienced chronic pain; she was admitted to a hospital in December 1989, but by the summer she was well enough to be present at events. She was nearly bedridden in her last years and was attended to by some followers. In 1991, she stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Space</b> Brothers had given her permission to die before their expected arrival in 2001.|$|E

5|$|Scientology's space opera teachings were publicized in {{accounts}} {{given by}} former church members, most notably during court cases. One such case was filed {{by a former}} Scientologist, Larry Wollersheim, against the church in 1980. Five years later, Wollersheim offered confidential Scientology materials, including space opera teachings, to the court as evidence, a move that was vigorously protested by the church's attorneys. They were unable to prevent disclosure, however, and the documents were published by the Los Angeles Times in November 1985. This {{was the first time}} that some aspects of Scientology's space opera teachings were offered as public evidence about the church. In the mid-1990s, Wollersheim published some of the materials on a website, prompting the church to sue his organization, FACTNet.

Samus describes the events of her , and how she encountered a Metroid larva, which hatched from an egg and immediately imprinted upon her, believing her to be its mother. She brought the larva to Ceres Space Colony, where scientists believed that they could harness its power. Just after she left the colony, she received a distress call and returned to find the scientists dead and the larva stolen by Ridley—the leader of the Space Pirates. Samus escapes from the space colony when its self-destruct sequence is activated, and follows Ridley to the planet Zebes.
