5|$|Each pair of antennas was {{connected}} to a motorized switch that rapidly switched between the pairs, a technique known as lobe switching. Both signals were then sent to a cathode ray tube (CRT) for display, {{with one of them}} passing through a voltage inverter. If <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>was</b> to the left, the display would show a longer blip on the left than the right. When <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>was</b> dead ahead, the blips would be equal length. There was an inherently limited accuracy to such a solution, about five degrees but it was a practical solution in terms of limiting the antenna sizes.|$|E

5|$|On 4 April 1945, 24 B-17s {{attacked}} fortified {{targets in}} Hamburg. <b>The</b> <b>target</b> <b>was</b> obscured by cloud so radar guidance {{was used to}} launch the bombs. A further mission in May 1945 was cancelled. A total of 158 bombs were dropped {{before the end of}} the war. No aircraft or aircrew were lost during the four Disney combat missions.|$|E
5|$|After {{three runs}} over the city, and with fuel running low {{because of the}} failed fuel pump, they headed for their {{secondary}} target, Nagasaki. Fuel consumption calculations made en route indicated that Bockscar had insufficient fuel to reach Iwo Jima and {{would be forced to}} divert to Okinawa, which had become entirely Allied-occupied territory only six weeks earlier. After initially deciding that if Nagasaki were obscured on their arrival the crew would carry the bomb to Okinawa and dispose of it in the ocean if necessary, Ashworth ruled that a radar approach would be used if <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>was</b> obscured.|$|E
5|$|Mk. III {{went into}} {{extensive}} testing at No. 25 Sqn in May 1940 and another troubling problem was found. As the target aircraft {{moved to the}} sides of the fighter, the error in the horizontal angle grew. Eventually, at about 60 degrees to the side, <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>was</b> indicated as being {{on the other side of}} the fighter. Hanbury Brown concluded that the problem was due to reflections between the fuselage and engine nacelles, due to the change to the long-nose IVF from the short-nose IF and IIF. In previous examples they had used the fuselage of the aircraft as the reflector, positioning and angling the antennas to run along the nose or wing leading edges.|$|E

30|$|Due to <b>the</b> <b>target</b> {{detection}} probability drop, <b>targets</b> <b>are</b> sometimes localized {{and sometimes}} not. Depending {{on the length}} of the continuous time interval within which <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>is</b> localized, <b>the</b> MTT will create and maintain <b>the</b> <b>target</b> tracks.

5|$|The {{only major}} {{measurement}} {{that could not}} be made automatically or before the mission was the determination of the windspeed and direction. These change over time, and also due to changes in location, altitude, or wind shear. This demanded an accurate determination of the wind in the general area of the target, and would normally be highly inaccurate if dialled in at the mission start. Taking this measurement while nearing <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>was</b> an important procedure on the CSBS; its manual included several methods of determining the wind. In the case of the Mk. XIV, the manual described only one method of determining the wind, equivalent to the most complex of the procedures from the CSBS model.|$|E
5|$|The {{text of the}} {{document}} is rather vague and noncommittal. The signatories were concerned with guarding the king's honour {{and the rights of}} the Crown (garder son honeur et les dreits de sa Corounne). There was also a promise to address and correct both the things that had been done against that honour and those rights, as well as the past and present oppression of the people (les choses que sont feites avant ces houres countre soen honour et le droit de sa Coronne, et les oppressiouns que ount estre feit et uncore se fount de jour en jour a soen people). Nothing is said about what specifically these things were, but it must be assumed that <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>was</b> Gaveston. Bek was given the authority to excommunicate whoever broke the terms of the agreement.|$|E
5|$|At 08:13, {{the first}} {{formations}} took off. In total, 64 Fw 190D-9s participated. Before <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>was</b> reached, some 14 D-9s {{were forced to}} turn back due to AAA damage or mechanical difficulties. Three Fw 190s were lost to German AAA fire. At 09:10, when the front was reached, Allied heavy AAA units began to engage the formation and another five were shot down. Most of the fire was from British Naval AAA defences defending the Scheldt Estuary. As the formation crossed the Dutch and Belgian border, I./JG 26 and III./JG 54 were intercepted by Spitfires. Five of the Fw 190s were shot down. I./JG 26 destroyed or damaged the few aircraft at the airfield. AAA defences claimed five kills and I./JG 26 reported two Fw 190s lost to Spitfires. Several others were lost over the airfield. Other losses occurred against friendly fire again on the return flight.|$|E

5|$|In 1958, {{scientists}} at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory claimed the discovery of element 102, now called nobelium. At the same time, they also attempted to synthesize element 103 by bombarding the same curium target used with nitrogen-14 ions. A follow-up on this experiment was not performed, as <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>was</b> destroyed. Eighteen tracks were noted, with decay energy around (9±1)MeV and half-life around s; the Berkeley team noted that while the cause could be the production of an isotope of element 103, other possibilities could not be ruled out. While the data agrees reasonably with that later discovered for 257Lr (alpha decay energy 8.87MeV, half-life 0.6s), the evidence obtained in this experiment fell {{far short of the}} strength required to conclusively demonstrate the synthesis of element 103. Later, in 1960, the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory attempted to synthesize the element by bombarding 252Cf with 10B and 11B. The results of this experiment were not conclusive.|$|E
5|$|In January2014, Iwata {{unveiled}} a ten-year {{strategy for the}} company based on quality of life products. <b>The</b> <b>target</b> <b>was</b> a new market outside video games. Developed under partnerships with Dr. Yasuyoshi Watanabe and ResMed, the first device in this initiative was a fatigue and sleep deprivation sensor announced in October2014. Unlike the Vitality Sensor, the sleep sensor {{was to be a}} stand-alone product that {{does not need to be}} worn. Following Iwata's death in July2015, analysts questioned whether Nintendo would continue the quality of life initiative. Despite a planned United States release in March2016, some suggested the product had been temporarily shelved, while others believed the product had been indefinitely postponed like the Vitality Sensor before it. The device was formally discontinued by February2016; however, Tatsumi Kimishima stated that research into quality of life products would continue.|$|E
5|$|In November 2008, the U.S. Department of Energy, {{which had}} {{oversight}} over the reactor in Oak Ridge, allowed the scientific {{use of the}} extracted berkelium. The production lasted 250 days and ended in late December 2008, resulting in 22milligrams of berkelium, enough to perform the experiment. In January 2009, the berkelium was removed from ORNL’s High Flux Isotope Reactor; it was subsequently cooled for 90 days and then processed at ORNL’s Radiochemical Engineering and Development Center to separate and purify the berkelium material, which took another 90 days. Its half-life is only 330days: after that time, half the berkelium produced would have decayed. Because of this, the berkelium target had to be quickly transported to Russia; for the experiment to be viable, {{it had to be}} completed within six months of its departure from the United States. <b>The</b> <b>target</b> <b>was</b> packed into five lead containers to be flown from New York to Moscow.|$|E

5|$|Israeli Arab {{historian}} Mustafa Kabha {{wrote that}} Egyptian and other Arab historians did not attribute as much {{importance to the}} battle as Israeli ones. They ask what the Egyptian objective was, {{and whether or not}} it was wise to advance without securing their lines of communication. Abdullah el Tell, commander of the Jordanian Legion in Jerusalem, thought that the Egyptians did not consider the Legion's needs. Aware of their weaknesses, they did not let anything distract them from reaching Tel Aviv. The Egyptian war log, from 19:00 on May 28, 1948, showed concern over the lines of communication. Muhammad Nimr al-Hawari wrote that while the Egyptians publicly declared that <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>was</b> Tel Aviv, they never actually meant to advance farther than their Isdud fortifications. As evidence, he cited the Egyptian refusal to take the undefended Yibna despite the villagers' repeated cries for help. Bahjat Abu-Gharbiyeh, one of Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni's deputies and commander of the Beit Jibrin area, wrote that the Egyptians never had a clear plan, because their leadership were not really interested in a war. Therefore, their efforts were improvised. Kabha concludes that Arab historiography considers the battle the successful realization of a tactical move, designed to serve the actions of the badly coordinated Arab armies.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, Harvey was {{selected}} to play his only Test, the Fourth Test at Adelaide, filling in for the injured Barnes. England batted first and made 460 before being dismissed late on the second day. Harvey opened with Arthur Morris, and made 12 in the first innings before being bowled by Bedser while playing an aggressive shot. With {{only a few minutes}} of play left, the Australian captain Don Bradman came in and he too was bowled by Bedser, without scoring a run. Harvey later privately said the Bradman had told him to play cautiously and survive {{until the end of the}} day, rather than attack, and that the captain was angry with the resulting two wickets. According to Harvey, Bradman told him that he would never be selected for Australia again. The tourists then declared during the last afternoon and left Australia a target of 314. <b>The</b> <b>target</b> <b>was</b> not a realistic offer and Morris and Harvey put on an opening stand of 116 before the latter was bowled for 31 by the medium pace of occasional bowler Norman Yardley. The match ended in a draw with Australia on 1/215.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 9 August 1945, a second B-29 (Bockscar), piloted by the 393d Bombardment Squadron's commander, Major Charles W. Sweeney, lifted off with Fat Man on board. This time, Ashworth served as weaponeer and Kokura was the primary target. Sweeney took off with the weapon already armed but with the {{electrical}} safety plugs still engaged. When they reached Kokura, they found cloud cover had obscured the city, prohibiting the visual attack required by orders. After three runs over the city, and with fuel running low, they headed for the secondary target, Nagasaki. Ashworth decided that a radar approach would be used if <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>was</b> obscured, but a last-minute break in the clouds over Nagasaki allowed a visual approach as ordered. The Fat Man was dropped over the city's industrial valley midway between the Mitsubishi Steel and Arms Works {{in the south and}} the Mitsubishi-Urakami Ordnance Works in the north. The resulting explosion had a blast yield equivalent to 21 kilotons of TNT, roughly the same as the Trinity blast, but was confined to the Urakami Valley, and a major portion of the city was protected by the intervening hills, resulting in the destruction of about 44% of the city. The bombing also crippled the city's industrial production extensively and killed 23,200–28,200 Japanese industrial workers and 150 Japanese soldiers. Overall, an estimated 35,000–40,000 people were killed and 60,000 injured.|$|E

5|$|P. schultzi {{does not}} respond to prey if the light is under 100lux (like a {{restaurant}} with only subdued artificial lighting), but responds to prey at distances from 6 to 10centimetres as the light level increases. A test suggested that P. schultzi′s hunting is stimulated only by vision, as prey close but hidden caused no response. A preliminary check showed that lures got the same responses from P. schultzi as live prey, and then more detailed testing with the lures showed that: if the target moved erratically, P. schultzi did not pursue it; if <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>was</b> totally stationary, the spider approached very slow (between 5 and 100millimetres per minute), with very long pauses in the final stages, and the sequence was not completed in 43% of cases; if the lure jiggled on the same spot, P. schultzi approached much faster and the sequence was almost always completed; if a lure was pulled directly away from P. schultzi, the spider followed, and faster if the lure was pulled, up to a limit (P. schultzi generally moves very slowly).|$|E
5|$|The Saratoga {{was ordered}} to depart for home for a refit by 19 May and Somerville wanted to mount one more attack as she was leaving the Indian Ocean. He chose the naval base and oil {{refinery}} at Surabaya, Java (Operation Transom), and {{the distance from the}} newly renamed East Indies Fleet's base at Ceylon required refuelling at Exmouth Gulf on the western coast of Australia before the attack. The necessity to attack from the south, across the full width of Java, meant that <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>was</b> outside the Barracuda's range and 810 and 847 Squadrons were replaced by the 18 Grumman TBF Avengers of 832 and 845 Squadrons for the mission. Early on the morning of 17 May, the ship launched all 18 Avengers, escorted by 16 Corsairs. One Avenger crashed on take-off and an American Avenger was shot down over the target; only one small ship was sunk, and little damage was done to the refinery. The Saratoga and her escorts separated after refuelling again in Exmouth Gulf and the East Indies Fleet was back in Trincomalee on 27 May where No. 21 Wing reembarked.|$|E
