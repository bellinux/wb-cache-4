50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the disc there is a <b>table</b> <b>of</b> <b>contents</b> (<b>TOC,</b> also known as the System File area of the disc), which stores the start positions of the various tracks, as well as meta information (title, artist) about them and free blocks. Unlike the conventional cassette, a recorded song {{does not need to be}} stored as one piece on the disk, it can be stored in several fragments, similar to a hard drive. Early MiniDisc equipment had a fragment granularity of 4 seconds audio. Fragments smaller than the granularity are not kept track of, which may lead to the usable capacity of a disc actually shrinking. No means of defragmenting the disc is provided in consumer grade equipment.|$|E

50|$|The data {{structure}} and operation of a MiniDisc {{is similar to that}} of a computer's hard disk drive. The bulk of the disc contains data pertaining to the music itself, and a small section contains the <b>table</b> <b>of</b> <b>contents</b> (<b>TOC),</b> providing the playback device with vital information about the number and location of tracks on the disc. Tracks and discs can be named. Tracks may easily be added, erased, combined and divided, and their preferred order of playback modified. Erased tracks are not actually erased at the time, but are marked so. When a disc becomes full, the recorder can simply slot track data into sections where erased tracks reside. This can lead to some fragmentation but unless many erasures and replacements are performed, the only likely problem is excessive searching, reducing battery life.|$|E
50|$|The lead-in's subcode {{contains}} repeated {{copies of}} the disc's <b>Table</b> <b>Of</b> <b>Contents</b> (<b>TOC),</b> which provides an index of the start positions of the tracks in the program area and lead-out. The track positions are referenced by absolute timecode, relative {{to the start of}} the program area, in MSF format: minutes, seconds, and fractional seconds called frames. Each timecode frame is one seventy-fifth of a second, and corresponds to a block of 98 channel-data frames‚Äîultimately, a block of 588 pairs of left and right audio samples. Timecode contained in the subchannel data allows the reading device to locate the region of the disc that corresponds to the timecode in the TOC. The TOC on discs is analogous to the partition table on hard drives. Nonstandard or corrupted TOC records are abused as a form of CD/DVD copy protection, in e.g. the key2Audio scheme.|$|E
50|$|The {{possible}} {{reason for not}} using a centralized location of information is that tar was originally meant for tapes, which are bad at random access anyway: if the <b>Table</b> <b>Of</b> <b>Contents</b> (<b>TOC)</b> were {{at the start of}} the archive, creating it would mean to first calculate all the positions of all files, which needs doubled work, a big cache, or rewinding the tape after writing everything to write the TOC. On the other hand, if the TOC were at the end-of-file (as is the case with ZIP files, for example), reading the TOC would require that the tape be wound to the end, also taking up time and degrading the tape by excessive wear and tear. Compression further complicates matters; as calculating compressed positions for a TOC at the start would need compression of everything before writing the TOC, a TOC with uncompressed positions is not really useful (since one has to decompress everything anyway to get the right positions) and decompressing a TOC at the end of the file might require decompressing the whole file anyway, too.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{need for}} rapid access to {{information}} to support critical decisions in public health cannot be disputed; however, development of such systems requires {{an understanding of the}} actual information needs of public health professionals. This paper reports the results of a literature review focused on the information needs of public health professionals. The authors reviewed the public health literature to answer the following questions: (1) What are the information needs of public health professionals? (2) In what ways are those needs being met? (3) What are the barriers to meeting those needs? (4) What {{is the role of the}} Internet in meeting information needs? The review was undertaken in order to develop system requirements to inform the design and development of an interactive digital knowledge management system. The goal of the system is to support the collection, management, and retrieval of public health documents, data, learning objects, and tools. Method:The search method extended beyond traditional information resources, such as bibliographic databases, <b>tables</b> <b>of</b> <b>contents</b> (<b>TOC),</b> and bibliographies, to include information resources public health practitioners routinely use or have need to use‚Äîfor example, grey literature, government reports, Internet-based publications, and meeting abstracts. Results:Although few formal studies of information needs and information-seeking behaviors of public health professionals have been reported, the literature consistently indicated a critical need for comprehensive, coordinated, and accessible information to meet the needs of the public health workforce. Major barriers to information access include time, resource reliability, trustworthiness/credibility of information, and ‚Äúinformation overload‚Äù. Conclusions:Utilizing a novel search method that included the diversity of information resources public health practitioners use, has produced a richer and more useful picture of the information needs of the public health workforce than other literature reviews. There is a critical need for public health digital knowledge management systems designed to reflect the diversity of public health activities, to enable human communications, and to provide multiple access points to critical information resources. Public health librarians and other information specialists can serve a significant role in helping public health professionals meet their information needs through the development of evidence-based decision support systems, human-mediated expert searching and training in the use information retrieval systems...|$|R
