30|$|From {{the present}} study, it was {{concluded}} that tomato and papaya can be used as potential sources for citric acid production. Similarly, E. coli treatment of papaya, grapes, and tomato increases their succinic acid content. Milk on treatment with E. coli can be a potential source of malic acid. However, the samples analyzed did not prove to be good sources of fumaric acid.

Microbial production of dicarboxylic acids, citric acid, succinic acid, and malic acid using microbial technology employing E. coli holds a good potential.

The electrical characterization of selected NiO-CGO samples, carried out between 90 and 260 degrees C by impedance spectroscopy, confirms electrical percolation of both phases in the composites.

In both cultivars, {{the percentage of}} weight loss increased and the moisture content of the peel (%) decreased at higher temperature and longer duration. Low temperature storage at 5 °C reduced the losses of fruit weight and moisture content of the peel and preserved the external quality better than 25 °C storage. During on-tree and off-tree storage at 25 and 5 °C, peel chlorophyll content decreased and peel carotenoid content increased. Titratable acidity (TA), <b>citric</b> <b>acid,</b> isocitric acid and vitamin C contents decreased and juice pH increased. Malic <b>acid</b> <b>content</b> stayed relatively constant.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the effect of debagging time on color and flavor / taste compounds in the non-red apple cultivar 'Golden Delicious' and red cultivar 'Qinguan' at mid and late stages of fruit development. Debagging briefly improved the red color in both cultivars, the peel of 'Golden Delicious' presenting pale-pink hue. However, rapid anthocyanin accumulation occurred in apple peel at a specific time (after 179 days after flowering (DAF) in 'Qinguan') and was unaltered by debagging time in the red cultivar 'Qinguan'. Furthermore, untimely debagging had a detrimental effect {{on the content of}} anthocyanin. All sugars increased and organic acids decreased in apple pulp at mid to late stages of development. Bagging treatment reduced the content of most sugars and organic acids, as well as, the overall total. However, glucose and <b>citric</b> <b>acid</b> <b>contents</b> were higher in bagged fruit than non-bagged fruit; the maximum occurred in T 7 treatment that was no-debagging at DAF 159 / 196 ('Golden delicious' / 'Qinguan'), i. e., 24. 35 and 0. 07 mg g- 1 FW in 'Golden delicious', and 38. 86 and 0. 06 mg g- 1 FW in 'Qinguan', respectively. In a word, bagging treatment can alter the pattern of peel color development in apple fruit; however, it remains difficult to alter the timing of rapid anthocyanin accumulation as it is regulated solely by development.

The results of the experiments are as follows: 1. Human Colostrum and Human Breast Milk: In human colostrum, observations were carried out every day and, in human breast milk, observations were carried out in three stages; former half, latter half and over one year of nursing period. Citric acid content was very low in the first day after parturition, and gradually increased thereafter, reaching the highest peak in the fourth day. After the fifth day, it tended to diminish gradually. It manifested further lowering as the nursing period progressed, showing very great lowering in over one year of nursing period. It has been advocated that the delay in weaning infants often causes development of rickets. When the antiricketic effect of citric acid is taken into consideration, this is suggestive of the importance end necessity of we 2 ning at the right period. 2.

Rats given fluorides in the drinking-water showed albuminuria, glycosuria and a rise in urea output that increased steadily during the three weeks of the experiment. That fluorides interfere with tubular reabsorption was shown in an experiment in which rats on a sodium-free diet excreted sodium when given a fluoride (KF) solution to drink. Kidney clearance values were greatly reduced. Kidney lesions appeared, and activities of the enzymes succinic dehydrogenase and alkaline phosphatase were negligible. The gastric mucosa was similarly affected. For long-term fluoride administration to rats NaF solution was mixed with the food. Within a few months kidney clearance values were reduced and the kidneys contained non-functioning renal parenchyma. The surviving renal epithelium showed normal succinic dehydrogenase activity. Casts noticed previously have been identified. The suggestion is made {{that it is the}} glomerulus which, primarily, is attacked by fluoride. In chronic fluorosis the fundic mucosa of the rat stomach was found to be thin, due to the disappearance of many of the parietal cells. Peptic cells were apparently unaffected and mucoid cells were stimulated. The histological changes confirm previous observations (Bowie, Darlow and Murray) that HCl secretion, but not pepsin secretion, is suppressed by fluoride. Bogs, apart from reduced alkaline phosphatase activity in some kidneys, showed no kidney or stomach lesions after two years' fluoride feeding.

Bonding between the polymer and wood macromolecules were observed by scanning electron microscopy and interpreted as evidence of chemical bonds at the wood cells.

We demonstrated the positive function of TIFY 10 s in alkaline responses by using the AtTIFY 10 a and AtTIFY 10 b knockout Arabidopsis, as evidenced by the relatively lower germination rates of attify 10 a and attify 10 b mutant seeds under alkaline stress.

Furthermore, expression levels of the stress responsive genes including NADP-ME, CS, H+-ppase and P 5 CS were also up-regulated in GsTIFY 10 a transgenic plants under alkaline stress. Interestingly, GsTIFY 10 a overexpression increased the jasmonate content of the transgenic alfalfa. In addition, we showed that neither GsTIFY 10 a nor GsTIFY 10 e exhibited transcriptional activity in yeast cells. However, through Y 2 H and BiFc assays, we demonstrated that GsTIFY 10 a, not GsTIFY 10 e, could form homodimers in yeast cells and in living plant cells. As expected, we also demonstrated that GsTIFY 10 a and GsTIFY 10 e could heterodimerize with each other in both yeast and plant cells.

The carbons lost as CO2 originate from what was oxaloacetate, not directly from acetyl-CoA. The carbons donated by acetyl-CoA become part of the oxaloacetate carbon backbone after the first turn of <b>the</b> <b>citric</b> <b>acid</b> cycle. Loss of the acetyl-CoA-donated carbons as CO2 requires several turns of <b>the</b> <b>citric</b> <b>acid</b> cycle. However, because of the role of <b>the</b> <b>citric</b> <b>acid</b> cycle in anabolism, they might not be lost, since many <b>citric</b> <b>acid</b> cycle intermediates are also used as precursors for the biosynthesis of other molecules.|$|R

Acetoacetate is a ketone body, {{which is}} activated with succinyl-CoA, and thereafter {{it can be}} converted into acetyl-CoA, which in turn can be oxidized by <b>the</b> <b>citric</b> <b>acid</b> cycle or be used for fatty acid synthesis.|$|R
50|$|Start {{from the}} state where {{glycogen}} is available and <b>the</b> <b>citric</b> <b>acid</b> cycle is severely down-regulated. Once the cell has received a non-trivial load, and has expended the phosphocreatine reserve, a small quantity of ATP will become discharged down to AMP. AMP will instantly up-regulate myophosphorylase, which will start liberating glucose from glycogen and make it available to the glycolytic pathway, producing pyruvate and recharging AMP back to ATP. Due to the greater availability of pyruvate as a substrate, and pyruvate also contributing a <b>citric</b> <b>acid</b> cycle intermediate, α-ketoglutarate, while consuming glutamate, <b>the</b> <b>citric</b> <b>acid</b> cycle will also speed up. The combination of glycolysis and <b>the</b> <b>citric</b> <b>acid</b> cycle now balances ATP production with ATP demand and the pool of AMP does not grow further. Because all pyruvate is not burned down in <b>the</b> <b>citric</b> <b>acid</b> cycle, <b>the</b> excess is converted to lactate and passed into blood as lactic acid.|$|R
