5|$|The Altar to Liberty: Minerva monument: The {{battle is}} commemorated with a monument, which {{includes}} a bronze statue of Minerva {{near the top of}} Battle Hill, the highest point of Brooklyn, in Green-Wood Cemetery. The statue was sculpted by Frederick Ruckstull and unveiled in 1920. The statue stands in the northwest corner of the cemetery and gazes directly at <b>the</b> <b>Statue</b> <b>of</b> <b>Liberty</b> in New York Harbor. In 2006, the Minerva statue was invoked in a successful defense to prevent a building from blocking the line of sight from the cemetery to <b>the</b> <b>Statue</b> <b>of</b> <b>Liberty</b> in the harbor. The annual Battle of Long Island commemoration begins inside the main Gothic arch entrance to Green-Wood Cemetery and marches up Battle Hill to ceremonies at the monument.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} combat these {{threats to the}} world order, the United Nations has {{expanded}} its influence around the globe to form the United Nations Anti-Terrorist Coalition (UNATCO). It is headquartered near New York City in a bunker beneath Liberty Island, placed there after a terrorist strike on <b>the</b> <b>Statue</b> <b>of</b> <b>Liberty.</b>|$|E

5|$|The coin {{was first}} {{suggested}} {{as a replacement}} for the Susan B. Anthony dollar, which proved useful for vending machine operators and mass transit systems despite being unpopular with the public. <b>The</b> <b>Statue</b> <b>of</b> <b>Liberty</b> was originally proposed as the design subject, but Sacagawea, the Shoshone guide of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, was eventually chosen.|$|E
5|$|Where would {{science fiction}} be without <b>the</b> <b>Statue</b> <b>of</b> <b>Liberty?</b> For decades it has towered or crumbled above the wastelands of deserted arth—giants have uprooted it, aliens {{have found it}} curious... the symbol of Liberty, of optimism, {{has become a symbol}} of science fiction's pessimistic view of the future.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of the bad}} weather, the B-17s {{returned}} individually to Mitchel Field. Cousland's Flying Fortress encountered severe hail, damaging all {{the forward}} surfaces of the plane, and ice caused a temporary shutdown of one engine. As a result, Cousland lagged behind the others, landing at 16:30. The next morning the three bombers took off to return to Harrisburg and spotted the Rex passing <b>the</b> <b>Statue</b> <b>of</b> <b>Liberty</b> at 09:30 as it entered New York Harbor.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Statue</b> <b>of</b> <b>Liberty's</b> torch {{has been}} {{closed to the public}} since the {{explosion}} due to structural damages. Access was not opened after the 1984-1986 restoration which included repairs to the arm and installation of a new gold-plated copper torch.|$|R

5|$|Huntsman {{formally}} {{entered the}} race for the Republican presidential nomination on June 21, 2011, announcing his bid in a speech at Liberty State Park in New Jersey, with <b>the</b> <b>Statue</b> <b>of</b> <b>Liberty</b> in the background—the same site where Ronald Reagan launched his campaign in 1980. After focusing his energy and resources on the New Hampshire primary in which he finished third, Huntsman announced the end of his campaign on January 16, 2012, endorsing Mitt Romney.|$|E
5|$|Many of Daniel Libeskind's {{original}} concepts {{from the}} 2002 competition were discarded from the tower's final design. One World Trade Center's final design consisted of simple symmetries {{and a more}} traditional profile, intended to compare with selected elements of the contemporary New York skyline. The tower's central spire draws from previous buildings, such as the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building. It also visually resembles the original Twin Towers, rather than being an off-center spire similar to <b>the</b> <b>Statue</b> <b>of</b> <b>Liberty.</b>|$|E
5|$|The PL.8 also {{incorporated}} several {{safety features}} {{in case of}} ditching at sea. Apart from small floats attached directly to the undersides of the lower wing, the main units of the fixed, tailskid undercarriage could be jettisoned on takeoff, {{in order to reduce}} the aircraft's weight. The underside of the fuselage was given a boat-like shape and made watertight for a water landing. Nungesser and Coli's plan was to make a water landing in New York, in front of <b>the</b> <b>Statue</b> <b>of</b> <b>Liberty.</b>|$|E

5|$|Two of the statues, both in Arkansas, are {{individually}} {{listed on}} the National Register of Historic Places; one in Helena and one in Fort Smith. Installed in cemeteries, town squares, and parks, outside museums, on courthouse lawns, and countless other places, the design {{is said to be}} the most-viewed example of outdoor statuary in the U.S. (after <b>the</b> <b>Statue</b> <b>of</b> <b>Liberty)</b> although many people do not even realize they have seen it.|$|E
5|$|As an American icon, <b>the</b> <b>Statue</b> <b>of</b> <b>Liberty</b> {{has been}} {{depicted}} on the country's coinage and stamps. It appeared on commemorative coins issued to mark its 1986 centennial, and on New York's 2001 {{entry in the}} state quarters series. An image of the statue was chosen for the American Eagle platinum bullion coins in 1997, and it {{was placed on the}} reverse, or tails, side of the Presidential Dollar series of circulating coins. Two images of the statue's torch appear on the current ten-dollar bill. The statue's intended photographic depiction on a 2010 forever stamp proved instead to be of the replica at the Las Vegas casino.|$|E
5|$|Copper {{does not}} react with water, {{but it does}} slowly react with {{atmospheric}} oxygen to form a layer of brown-black copper oxide which, unlike the rust that forms on iron in moist air, protects the underlying metal from further corrosion (passivation). A green layer of verdigris (copper carbonate) can often be seen on old copper structures, such as the roofing of many older buildings and <b>the</b> <b>Statue</b> <b>of</b> <b>Liberty.</b> Copper tarnishes when exposed to some sulfur compounds, with which it reacts to form various copper sulfides.|$|E
50|$|McDowell {{was active}} in other {{heritage}} and patriotic activities: he raised money to complete <b>the</b> <b>Statue</b> <b>of</b> <b>Liberty’s</b> pedestal, and lobbied {{for the establishment of}} a national university in Washington, D.C.

5000|$|Most {{commonly}} used in the Victorian era and believed to be popularized by <b>the</b> <b>Statue</b> <b>of</b> <b>Liberty's</b> dedication in 1886.

5|$|In May 1982, President Ronald Reagan {{announced}} {{the formation of}} the Statue of Liberty–Ellis Island Centennial Commission, led by Chrysler Corporation chair Lee Iacocca, to raise the funds needed to complete the work. Through its fundraising arm, the Statue of Liberty–Ellis Island Foundation, Inc., the group raised more than $350million in donations. <b>The</b> <b>Statue</b> <b>of</b> <b>Liberty</b> was one of the earliest beneficiaries of a cause marketing campaign. A 1983 promotion advertised that for each purchase made with an American Express card, the company would contribute one cent to the renovation of the statue. The campaign generated contributions of $1.7million to the restoration project.|$|E
5|$|On {{a typical}} weekday, a {{combined}} total of 50,000 people {{worked in the}} North and South Towers, with another 200,000 passing through as visitors. The complex was so large that it had its own zip code: 10048. The Windows on the World restaurant, located {{on top of the}} North Tower, reported revenues of $37 million in 2000, making it the highest-grossing restaurant in the United States. The Twin Towers became known worldwide, appearing in movies, television shows, postcards, and other merchandise. The towers came {{to be seen as a}} New York City icon, much like the Empire State Building, the Chrysler Building, and <b>the</b> <b>Statue</b> <b>of</b> <b>Liberty.</b>|$|E
5|$|Stone was {{reportedly}} the first volunteer {{to enter the}} Union Army, and during the war {{he served as a}} general officer, noted for his involvement at the Battle of Ball's Bluff in October 1861. Held responsible for the Union defeat, Stone was arrested and imprisoned for almost six months, mostly for political reasons. He never received a trial, and after his release he would not hold a significant command during the war again. Stone later served again with distinction as a general in the Egyptian Army, and is also noted for his role in constructing the base of <b>the</b> <b>Statue</b> <b>of</b> <b>Liberty.</b>|$|E
