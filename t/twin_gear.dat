5000|$|The first Junkers engines had one crankshaft, {{the upper}} pistons having long {{connecting}} rods outside the cylinder. These engines were {{the forerunner of}} the Doxford marine engine, and this layout was also used for two- and three-cylinder car engines from around 1900-1922 by Gobron-Brillié. There is currently a resurgence of this design in a boxer configuration as a small aircraft Diesel engine, and for other applications, called the [...] "OPOC" [...] engine by Advanced Propulsion Technologies, Inc. of California. Later engines, such as the Junkers Jumo 205 diesel aircraft engine and today's Achates Power engine, use two crankshafts, one {{at either end of}} a single bank of cylinders. There are efforts to reintroduce the opposed-piston diesel aircraft engine with <b>twin</b> <b>geared</b> crankshafts for general aviation applications, by both Dair and PowerPlant Developments in the UK.|$|R
50|$|Launched in 1957 the Model Twenty One was {{the first}} of the Triumph unit {{construction}} twin cylinder motorcycles from the Meriden factory. With a capacity of 349 cc, the engine was a classic Edward Turner design with a 360 degree crankshaft, <b>twin</b> <b>gear</b> driven camshafts and twin plunger oil pump. The cylinder block was cast iron with an alloy head and separate rocker boxes. The engine was dry sump lubrication and there was a single Amal Monobloc carburettor. Drive was by a conventional four speed gearbox, with a right foot gear lever. There are two explanations for the ''''Twenty One'''' name spelt out in full on the side panels. The first explanation is that it celebrates the twenty-first anniversary of Triumph Engineering Co Ltd. The second explanation is that the important US export market rated motorcycle engine displacement in cubic inches and 21 cubic inches equates to 350 cc.|$|E
40|$|The {{relative}} efficiency of two square-mesh codend designs {{with the same}} circumference (~ 2 m) but different mesh sizes and materials (32 mm polyethylene-PE and 30 mm polyamide-PA) was tested in an artisanal shrimp trawl fishery in Paraná, southern Brazil. The two square-mesh codends were hauled alternately with a 26 mm diamond-shaped mesh codend (control) in a <b>twin</b> <b>gear</b> configuration. Although not significant, the mean numbers of total bycatch were reduced by 16. 6 and 10. 0 % with the 32 and 30 mm square-mesh codends, respectively. The results indicate significant improvement in size selectivity for some species (Xiphopenaeus kroyeri and Stellifer rastrifer). The operational changes tested can be a suitable technical solution for reducing the capture of immature organisms in the shrimp trawl fishery in Paraná, Brazil...|$|E

5000|$|The M1890M1 mortar {{was most}} often {{installed}} on an M1896 carriage (as shown {{here in the}} images at top left and right). The mortar and its carriage weighed a total of 78.5 tons. The carriage was geared to enable it to be turned (in azimuth) {{by means of a}} traversing crank with two handles, located {{on the right side of}} the piece. A ring marked in degrees of azimuth ran around the mortar, just outside the inner steel circle or [...] "racer" [...] that carried the carriage, and a soldier read a pointer on the racer to aim the mortar in direction. The tube was raised or lowered (in elevation) by <b>twin</b> <b>geared</b> wheels with long spokes (resembling ship's wheels) that were located on either side of the carriage. The breech could be rapidly depressed to an almost level position for loading and then be quickly elevated for firing. Other carriages included the M1891 and M1908.|$|R
40|$|The {{fact that}} bamboo’s construction, with the {{advantage}} it’s tensile {{strength in the}} fiber direction, is reliable when the earthquake occurs increased the use bamboo’s in earthquake-resistant construction. Bamboo’s construction has a weakness in the connection system caused by the dimentional variations. Researches {{on the design of}} the connection system produce various bamboo’s connection system designs, but the lack of literature on mechanical properties (tensile strength, bending, shear, fracture and dynamics) of bamboo’s connection system went hard with the designer. The analysis of construction strength shows that dynamics load is more dangerous than statics load. The design of mechanical system of dynamics model tester for the connection system of bamboo’s construction intended to obtain the dynamic characteristics of the connection system of the bamboo’s construction. Dynamic load will be very dangerous if it vibrates at the same frequency / close to the natural frequency of connection system of bamboo’s construction. So the test should be conducted in the natural frequency of connection system of bamboo’s construction.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} in torque sharing between an internal combustion engine (IC engine) and two electrical motors for optimal drive of a hybrid vehicle. The concept {{of the system is}} realized by employing the three degrees of freedom (DOF) <b>twin</b> epicyclic <b>gear</b> train with specially selected gear ratios to satisfy an optimal power sharing strategy. The first stage of the train provides high torque from the IC engine and moderate torque from the motor M 1. The second stage provides lower torque but higher speed from the motor M 2. Such arrangement of power sources is achieved by carefully selecting of all the gear ratios in the train. The designed system is able to minimize the power usage of the IC engine and thus to minimize the exhaust gas emission, save cost of petrol as compared to normal petrol vehicle. It also provides a quite wide range of torque and speed values to drive the vehicle...|$|R

The 45ft 6in Watsons were long lived and most survived at their original stations into the 1950s when most were replaced by 46ft 9in and, later in the decade, 47ft Watsons. Many boats spent their final years in the reserve fleet with five of the later boats serving until 1969 and one, ON759, continuing in the reserve fleet until 1972. During their service, 45ft 6in Watsons launched on service 2,587 times and are credited with saving 2,613 lives.

50|$|The Merlin was an {{evolution}} of earlier modification programmes performed by Swearingen Aircraft. Ed Swearingen started the developments {{that led to}} the Merlin through gradual modifications to the Beechcraft Twin Bonanza and Queen Air business aircraft which he dubbed Excalibur. Then a hybrid aircraft was developed, with a new fuselage and vertical fin, mated to salvaged and modified (wet) Queen Air wings and horizontal tails, and <b>Twin</b> Bonanza landing <b>gear.</b> This was the SA26 Merlin, more-or-less a pressurized Excalibur but fitted with a different model engine, the Lycoming TIGO-540 6-cylinder geared piston engine. The TIGO 540 was used despite the fact {{that one of the reasons}} the IO-720 was used in the Excalibur was that the Queen Air series' IGSO-480 and IGSO-540 engines from the same manufacturer were so troublesome.

40|$|This article {{presents}} some studies on precision finishing of straight bevel gears using electro-chemical honing (ECH) process. Surface roughness and form errors {{in terms of}} pitch and runout error have been studied as process performance measures. An innovative experimental setup has been designed and developed for ECH of bevel gears using a novel concept of <b>twin</b> complementary cathode <b>gears.</b> It ensures finishing of the entire face width of the workpiece gear and the inter-electrode gap required for the ECM action to take place. In this concept, one of the cathode gears has an undercut conducting layer sandwiched between two insulating layers while, in the other cathode gear, an insulating layer is sandwiched between two undercut conducting layers. The results have shown noticeable improvement in the surface finish and form accuracy in an optimized finishing time of 2 minutes. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) images and bearing area curves have also shown improvement in the surface integrity and material contact ratio thus ensuring enhanced tribological performance and maximum service life of the gears. All these results have proven ECH as a viable and productive alternative gear finishing process...|$|R
