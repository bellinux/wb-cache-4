50|$|In {{response}} Sweazey {{moved back}} to National Semiconductor, who positioned QuickRing as a high-speed interconnect. Here it had little better luck, competing against SCI on one hand, and ever-faster versions of Ethernet on the other. Efforts were made to standardize QuickRing inside the existing VMEbus system using some redundant pins {{in response to an}} industry effort to standardize parallel processing hardware, but nothing ever came of this. The US Navy announced several <b>tenders</b> <b>for</b> QuickRing <b>products</b> <b>for</b> sonar data processing (for which they had originally had Futurebus+ developed), but it is unclear {{whether or not it was}} used in this role. National eventually lost interest, and the system essentially disappeared in 1996. Similar products, notablty SKYconnect and Raceway, were also standardized in this role, but seem to have seen little use as well.|$|R

30|$|The first {{organization}} (PRODUCT) is an owner-managed, medium-sized {{company with}} about 150 employees and {{annual sales of}} about 40 million Euros. Founded in the 1980 s, PRODUCT produces professional defibrillators for the international market and considers itself as the industry’s innovation leader. We interviewed PRODUCT‘s enterprise architect {{and the head of}} the IT department, the two executives most involved in process improvement and BPM capability development. At PRODUCT, investment decisions are prioritized and approved ad hoc by the management board. In the last years, PRODUCT experienced considerable growth, which is why it started to institutionalize its management processes. As a driver of BPM, PRODUCT‘s products and processes are more and more required to comply with the industry’s quality management standards when applying <b>for</b> calls <b>for</b> <b>tenders.</b> As <b>PRODUCT</b> has just started to work on BPM, it focuses on fundamental capability areas, such as process design and modeling, enterprise process architecture, and process measures. As most of PRODUCT‘s processes are not executed within an automated workflow environment, data for process performance indicators are collected manually. The same holds true <b>for</b> <b>PRODUCT‘s</b> project and project portfolio management activities.|$|R
