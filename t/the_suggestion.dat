5|$|A {{study of}} 27 Milky Way neighbors {{found that in}} all dwarf galaxies, the central mass is {{approximately}} 10 million solar masses, {{regardless of whether the}} galaxy has thousands or millions of stars.

5|$|An {{alternative}} {{theory to}} the corpse's identity was {{suggested in the}} history The Secrets of HMS Dasher (2004). This suggested that in March 1943 {{there was an explosion}} on , which sank, killing 379 men; one of these corpses was purportedly used. The military historian Denis Smyth dismisses <b>the</b> <b>suggestion,</b> and observes that the official records of the operation state that Michael was the body.|$|E

40|$|Participants given a {{modified}} Carleton University Responsiveness to Suggestion Scale (CURSS) with goal-directed fantasies (GDF 2 ̆ 7 s) removed from hypnotic suggestions {{scored higher on}} objective, subjective and involuntariness measures of hypnotic response than participants given <b>the</b> standard CURSS <b>suggestions.</b> ^ Those receiving <b>the</b> standard CURSS <b>suggestions</b> reported more GDF 2 ̆ 7 s. Automatic GDF 2 ̆ 7 s were positively correlated with hypnotic response, both across and within groups, while intentional GDF 2 ̆ 7 s were unrelated to response scores. Goal Imagery was significantly correlated with subjective scores for the group given <b>the</b> standard <b>suggestions.</b> Absorption measured on the Tellegen Absorption Scale was unrelated to hypnotic response. ^ Most participants passing <b>the</b> <b>suggestions</b> believe in <b>the</b> reality of the ideomotor and challenge suggestions, but did not believe <b>the</b> cognitive <b>suggestions</b> were real. Despite {{the belief in the}} reality of <b>the</b> challenge <b>suggestions,</b> most participants believed they could have resisted <b>the</b> <b>suggestions</b> and performed <b>the</b> challenges if they really wanted to. ...|$|R

We believe that the reported difficulties in adjusting the abstracts are inherent to the writing process, since most users (six of them) ranked <b>the</b> information and <b>suggestions</b> provided as very informative; two users ranked them as fairly informative, and even those with difficulties in rewriting the abstract did not considered <b>the</b> <b>suggestions</b> as uninformative (see Fig.  4 d).|$|R
