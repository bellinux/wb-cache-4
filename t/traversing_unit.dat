40|$|In {{the wind}} tunnel a common method for wake {{analysis}} is {{to attach a}} pressure probe to a <b>traversing</b> <b>unit</b> in order to retrieve flow field information. However, the approach is intrusive and has {{a direct impact on}} the surrounding flow field, affecting the investigated flow characteristics. In measurements conducted in the Volvo Cars Aerodynamic Wind tunnel, the forces measured by the balance system showed variations depending on the position of the <b>traversing</b> <b>unit</b> in the wake. In this paper, a numerical investigation is conducted to initially validate the wind tunnel results and to give more insight into the physics of the problem.

40|$|This Master’s thesis {{describes}} {{the results of}} the work developed for a specific experimental aerodynamic laboratory housed at the Technische Hochschule of Ingolstadt, Germany. The present work consists in the design of an automated <b>traversing</b> <b>unit</b> that has to serve in a specific wind tunnel, which is currently equipped with a simple positioning system not operated by a computer and capable of performing a rotation just around a single axis. In this context, the design of a new <b>traversing</b> <b>unit</b> is considered a crucial element for the improvement of the future experimental analysis of the aerodynamic forces acting on a micro air vehicle. After an initial critical analysis of the assigned requirements, different strategies to satisfy the imposed conditions are implemented and different conceptual solutions are realized. The following step consists in the evaluation for merit of the different solutions suggested, selecting the one considered ideal for the fulfillment of the project. Afterwards, the best configuration is discussed in deeper detail, optimized and finally developed. All the results obtained in this section have to be considered the effect of a continuous cooperation between the Aerodynamics and Structure departments, including the respective workshops and laboratories. As specifically demanded, a 3 D model of all the components forming the <b>traversing</b> <b>unit</b> is realized, including the technical drawings and the specific structural tests for the elements considered critical. The ultimate goal is the delivery of all the calculations, all the technical considerations and the programming elements considered necessary for the effective production of the <b>traversing</b> <b>unit,</b> within a predetermined deadline...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Effective nasal drug {{delivery}} of new-generation systemic drugs requires efficient devices that can achieve targeted {{drug delivery}}. It {{has been established}} that droplet size, spray plume, and droplet velocity are major contributors to drug deposition. Continual effort is needed to better understand and characterise the physical mechanisms underpinning droplet formation from nasal spray devices. Methods: High speed laser photography combined with an in-house designed automated actuation system, and a highly precise <b>traversing</b> <b>unit,</b> measurements and images magnified in small field-of-view regions within the spray was performed. Results: The qualitative results showed a swirling liquid sheet at the near-nozzle region as the liquid is discharged before ligaments of fluid are separated off the liquid sheet. Droplets are formed and continue to deform as they travel downstream at velocities of up to 20 m/s. Increase in actuation pressure produces more rapid atomization and discharge time where finer droplets are produced. Conclusions: The results suggest that device designs should consider reducing droplet inertia to penetrate the nasal valve region, but {{find a way to}} deposit in the main nasal passage and not escape through to the lungs...|$|E
40|$|With the {{increase}} in fuel prices and the increasingly strict environmental legislations regarding CO 2 - emissions, reduction of the total energy consumption of our society becomes more important. Passenger vehicles are partly responsible for this consumption due to their strong presence in the daily life of most people. Therefore reducing the impact of cars on the environment can assist in decreasing the overall energy consumption. Even though several fields {{have an impact on}} a passenger car's performance, this paper will focus on the aerodynamic part and more specifically, the wake behind a vehicle. By definition a car is a bluff body on which the air resistance is for the most part driven by pressure drag. This is caused by the wake these bodies create. Therefore analyzing the wake characteristics behind a vehicle is crucial if one would like to reduce drag. With the recent upgrade of wind tunnels with a moving belt system, the opportunity has emerged to investigate the flow field in the wake behind vehicles, matching closer the real on-road driving conditions. This study investigates experimentally and numerically the wake behind a passenger car of an SUV-type. Three configurations with a significant change in CD have been chosen for the analysis. Their wake shape together with their respective closure points have been analyzed using three planes, namely one x-plane, one y-plane and one z-plane. Results have shown that the numerical simulations correlate well with the experiments in wake shape and wake behavior. However in the chosen configurations they underestimate the wake length. A distinct interference of the <b>traversing</b> <b>unit</b> presence can be noted in the experimental results...|$|E

40|$|This paper, {{which is}} {{presented}} in two parts, develops a computational approach to strictly concave parametric programs of the form: Maximize α f 1 (x) + (1 - α) f 2 (x) subject to concave inequality constraints for each fixed value of α in the unit interval, where f 1 and f 2 are strictly concave and certain additional regularity conditions are satisfied. This class of problems subsumes a corresponding class of vector maximum problems and also, by means of a simple device, provides a deformation method for ordinary concave programming. The approach is based on exploiting the continuity properties of the parametric program so as to efficiently maintain a solution to the associated Kuhn-Tucker conditions as a <b>traverses</b> the <b>unit</b> interval. The same approach can be adapted to much more general parametric programs than the one above. In Part I, a Basic Parametric Procedure is derived and shown to be finite in a certain sense.

In Part II, additional theory is developed that facilitates computational implementation, and one possible general-purpose algorithm for a digital computer is given.

25|$|The {{available}} {{space for}} air and moisture in wood {{depends on the}} density and porosity of wood. Porosity is the volume fraction of void space in a solid. The porosity {{is reported to be}} 1.2 to 4.6% of dry volume of wood cell wall (Siau, 1984). On the other hand, permeability {{is a measure of the}} ease with which fluids are transported through a porous solid under the influence of some driving forces, e.g. capillary pressure gradient or moisture gradient. It is clear that solids must be porous to be permeable, but it does not necessarily follow that all porous bodies are permeable. Permeability can only exist if the void spaces are interconnected by openings. For example, a hardwood may be permeable because there is intervessel pitting with openings in the membranes (Keey et al., 2000). If these membranes are occluded or encrusted, or if the pits are aspirated, the wood assumes a closed-cell structure and may be virtually impermeable. The density is also important for impermeable hardwoods because more cell-wall material is <b>traversed</b> per <b>unit</b> distance, which offers increased resistance to diffusion (Keey et al., 2000). Hence lighter woods, in general, dry more rapidly than do the heavier woods. The transport of fluids is often bulk flow (momentum transfer) for permeable softwoods at high temperature while diffusion occurs for impermeable hardwoods (Siau, 1984). These mechanisms are discussed below.|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Inspection of optical components is essential to assure the quality and performance of optical systems. Evaluation of optical components includes metrology measurements of surface topography. It also requires optical measurements including refractive index, thin film thickness, reflectivity and transmission. The dispersion characteristics of optical constants including refractive index are also required. Hence, various instruments are used to make these measurements in research laboratories and for quality assurance. Clearly, {{it would be a}} significant advantage and cost saving if a technique was developed that could combine surface metrology with optical measurements. Coherence Scanning Interferometry (CSI) (also referred to as Scanning White Light Interferometry (SWLI)) has been used widely to measure surface topography with sub-nanometre vertical resolution. One of the benefits of the CSI is that the technique is non-contacting and hence non-destructive. Thus the test surfaces are not affected by the measurement using a CSI instrument whereas damage to the surfaces can occur when using traditional contact methods such as stylus profilometry. However use of CSI is geometrically limited to small areas (≲ 10 × 10 mm) with gentle slopes (≲ 40) because of the numerical aperture of objective lens whereas stylus profilometry works well with larger areas and higher slopes due to the range of motion of the gauge and the <b>traverse</b> <b>unit.</b> Since the CSI technique is optical and involves light reflection and interference it is possible to extend the technique for the measurement of the thickness of transparent films, the roughness of surfaces buried beneath thin films or interfacial surfaces. It may also be used to determine spectral complex refractive index. This thesis provides an analytical framework of new methods to obtain complex refractive index in a visible light domain and interfacial surface roughness (ISR). It also provides experimental verification of these new capabilities using actual thin film model systems. The original Helical Complex Field (HCF) function theory is presented followed by its existing extensions that enable determination of complex refractive index and interfacial surface roughness. Further theoretical extensions of the HCF theory are also provided: A novel theory to determine the refractive index of a (semi-) transparent film is developed to address the constraint of the current HCF theory that restricted its use to opaque materials; Another novel theory is provided to measure ISR with noise compensation, which avoids erroneous surface roughness caused by the numerical optimisation affected by the existence of noise. The effectiveness of the ISR measurement with noise compensation has been verified using a number of computer simulations. Stylus profilometry is a well established method to provide a profile and has been used extensively as a 'reference' for other techniques. It normally provides a profile on which the roughness and the waviness are computed. Extension of the stylus profilometry technique to areal measurement of asymmetrical surfaces, namely raster scan measurement, requires a system to include error compensation between each traverse. The system errors and the random errors need to be separately understood particular when the measurement of a surface with nanometre-order accuracy is required. In this thesis a mathematical model to locate a stylus tip considering five mechanical errors occurring in a common raster scan profilometer is provided. Based on the model, the simulator which provides an areal measurement of a sphere was developed. The simulator clarified the relationship between the Zernike coefficients obtained from the form residual {{and the size of the}} errors in the form of partial derivatives of Zernike coefficients with respect to the errors. This provides theoretical support to the empirical knowledge of the relationship between the coefficients and the errors. Furthermore, a method to determine the size of errors directly from Zernike coefficients is proposed supported by simulations. Some of the error parameters were accurately determined avoiding iterative computation with this method whereas the errors are currently being determined by iterative computation...|$|R
