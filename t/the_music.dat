5|$|Böcker later {{explained}} {{that the decision to}} focus on Square Enix was made due to the large library of games to choose from, all of which he felt had a distinct sound, and many of which were very well known in Germany. An emphasis was put on balancing out the concert program and the arrangements, so that <b>the</b> <b>music</b> would appeal to first-time listeners, classical music fans, and longtime gamers. The titles chosen to be featured in the concert were Kingdom Hearts and Kingdom Hearts II from the Kingdom Hearts series, Secret of Mana, Chrono Trigger and Chrono Cross from the Chrono series, and the Final Fantasy series. In order to select the pieces presented, the original composers were consulted to assemble a list of their personal favorites. The composers were Yoko Shimomura for <b>the</b> <b>music</b> of Kingdom Hearts, Hiroki Kikuta for <b>the</b> <b>music</b> of Secret of Mana, Yasunori Mitsuda for <b>the</b> <b>music</b> of Chrono Trigger and Cross, and Nobuo Uematsu for <b>the</b> <b>music</b> of the Final Fantasy series.|$|E
