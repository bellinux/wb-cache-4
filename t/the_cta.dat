5|$|On June 11, 2008, <b>the</b> <b>CTA</b> {{board was}} {{scheduled}} to hear the city's plan of a three-phase bailout {{of the construction of}} the rapid transit station under block 37. The plan included $20million in additional tax increment financing. This comes on top of an extra $60–70million in excess of its budgeted amount that <b>the</b> <b>CTA</b> has been forces to expend. The building developer, Joseph Freed & Associates, has agreed to accept $19million of cost overruns. This round of assistance only covers costs that have been incurred to date. No further funds have been committed and the station's development is being halted until such funds arise. The original budget was $213million ($173 from CTA) and costs to date have been $320million. As of last year the costs were $150million over budget and the city is seeking private investment. Construction finally began on the third building, the hotel and residences in the end of 2009.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, in 2004 the Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board {{conducted}} a study into the risks presented by dust explosions after three fatal accidents in the year before. The West Pharmaceutical Services explosion killed six persons, <b>the</b> <b>CTA</b> Acoustics fiberglass insulation manufacturing plant explosion killed seven, and the Hayes Lemmerz automotive parts plant explosion killed one, prompting the report. Their report showed that between 1980 and 2005, there had been 281 explosions involving combustible dust, resulting in 119 deaths and 718 injuries. The Board found that dust explosions posed a severe risk and {{made a number of}} recommendations to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. These had been partly implemented by 2008. The Board continued {{to be concerned about the}} potential for further fatal accidents up until Imperial's refinery was the scene of an explosion.|$|E
5|$|The Mills Corporation {{has also}} been {{contracted}} to develop an underground transit center beneath Block 37 that will be jointly funded by the City of Chicago, the Chicago Transit Authority and The Mills Corporation. The planned project includes a new subway station, track connections and a common downtown airport check-in facility for train service to both O'Hare and Midway airports. Since the purchase in April 2007 the project has stalled. <b>The</b> <b>CTA</b> has {{pulled out of the}} project and the current economic climate has stalled the project. Delays in completion have caused the project to lose major tenants.|$|E
5|$|There was {{increased}} looting on December 20, both in Buenos Aires and the Conurbano. The cacerolazos continued; {{large groups of}} people started demonstrations calling for the government's resignation. The unions—first <b>the</b> <b>CTA</b> and then the CGT—began general strikes against the state of emergency. Most of the UCR withdrew their support to De la Rúa, so he asked the PJ to create a government coalition. The PJ refused, and De la Rúa resigned from government. His last administrative action was to lift the state of emergency. He gave his resignation to the Congress at 19:45 local time on December 20, 2001, and left the Casa Rosada in a helicopter. He had ruled for two years, half of his term of office.|$|E

5|$|The Orange Line, {{including}} the Pulaski station, was first proposed in 1980 by Chicago Mayor Jane Byrne, {{who planned to}} fund the line using money from the cancelled Crosstown Expressway project. U.S. Representative William Lipinski secured federal funding for the line in 1986 as a political favor from President Ronald Reagan, and Chicago Mayor Harold Washington signed a federal funding contract later that year. Construction began {{on the line in}} 1987 and was completed in 1993; the total cost of the line was $510 million. The Pulaski station was built over an abandoned Belt Railway of Chicago line which ran from 49th Street to Midway Airport. Pulaski, {{along with the rest of}} the Orange Line, opened on October 31, 1993. <b>The</b> <b>CTA</b> only charged riders 25 cents during the station's first three days of service, which were considered a test run of the line.|$|E
25|$|In 2014, <b>the</b> <b>CTA</b> {{received}} their first electric buses from New Flyer, making <b>the</b> <b>CTA</b> {{the first major}} U.S. transit agency to use electric buses {{as part of a}} regular service.|$|E
25|$|In addition, the {{legislation}} amended various other laws {{to deal with}} underfunding of <b>the</b> <b>CTA</b> Retirement Plan, and authorized the Chicago City Council to raise the real estate transfer tax for the sole benefit of <b>the</b> <b>CTA,</b> which it did.|$|E

25|$|One {{particular}} issue would have special impact on Thevar's political career. Since 1920 the Criminal Tribes Act had been {{enacted by the}} government of the Madras Presidency and began to be implemented in the Madurai, Ramnad and Tirunelveli districts. After his entry into politics, Thevar began to mobilize resistance to <b>the</b> <b>CTA.</b> He toured villages in the affected areas and led protest rallies for the rights of the individuals registered under <b>the</b> <b>CTA.</b> In 1929 the Maravars of 19 villages in Appanad were forced to registered under <b>the</b> <b>CTA.</b> Thevar led a massive campaign in the villages, urging the people to defy <b>the</b> <b>CTA.</b> The authorities partially withdrew, and reduced the number of CTA registrations in the concerned areas from around 2000 to 341.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>CTA</b> {{recently}} studied four possible {{alternatives for}} the project and will provide community presentations of those alternatives in late 2012 to 2013. <b>The</b> <b>CTA</b> is also proposing to close five stations permanently on the Red and Purple lines, including Foster, South Boulevard, Jarvis, Lawrence, and Thorndale.|$|E

25|$|The Chicago Surface Lines was {{primarily}} a trolley operation, with approximately 3100 streetcars on the roster {{at the time of}} <b>the</b> <b>CTA</b> takeover. It purchased small lots of motor buses, totaling 693 at the time of <b>the</b> <b>CTA</b> takeover, mostly consisting of smaller buses used on extension routes or to replace two-man streetcars on routes such as Hegewisch and 111th Street, because conductors were required to flag streetcars across mainline railroads where there was not a watchman at the crossing. Most postwar PCC cars were scrapped and parts reused in the 6000-series rapid transit cars for <b>the</b> <b>CTA.</b> The trolley bus fleet consisted of 152 vehicles.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, <b>the</b> <b>CTA</b> and the City of Chicago Public Art Program {{installed}} nine {{permanent works}} of art at eight renovated rail stations on what {{is now known as}} the Pink Line. <b>The</b> <b>CTA</b> has since created an ongoing program to showcase permanent {{works of art}} in conjunction with the City of Chicago Public Art Program. The Arts in Transit Program is funded by the Federal Transit Administration, and created opportunities to develop original artwork for station reconstruction projects along <b>the</b> <b>CTA</b> Red and Brown Lines. Artists were selected for each of the stations included in the Brown Line Capacity Expansion Project and select renovated Red Line stations.|$|E

25|$|After independence, the Act was {{ultimately}} repealed. It was first repealed in Madras Province in 1949, {{after a long}} campaign led by Communist leaders such as P. Ramamurthi and P.

Thevar had led many agitations in the villages since 1929, urging the people to defy <b>the</b> <b>CTA.</b> As a result, the number of tribes listed under <b>the</b> <b>CTA</b> was reduced.
