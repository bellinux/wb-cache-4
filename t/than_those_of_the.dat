5|$|The {{adult male}} has a dark grey beak and pink eye-rings. The adult female has a bone-coloured beak, grey eye-rings and ear patches that are whiter and more {{distinctive}} <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> male. The feathers of its underparts and underwing coverts have larger white margins <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> male, {{leading to a}} more barred or scalloped pattern to its plumage. Its legs and feet are a little lighter <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> male. Moulting appears {{to take place in}} stages in late summer—some time between January or February and April or May, and is poorly understood.|$|E
5|$|Leading {{officials}} such as Bedbrook, {{the founder}} of the Stoke Mandeville Games, were impressed with the spectator turnout. Although the standards were lower <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Stoke Mandeville Games, there were some outstanding individual performances and several world records were broken.|$|E
5|$|Multiple {{standards}} {{exist for}} defining Henoch–Schönlein purpura, including the 1990 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification and the 1994 Chapel Hill Consensus Conference (CHCC). Some have reported the ACR criteria {{to be more}} sensitive <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> CHCC.|$|E
25|$|In his lifetime, Perkins {{attained}} enormous popularity, {{with sales}} of his works eventually surpassing even Calvin's. When he died, his writings were selling more copies <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most famous <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Reformers combined.|$|R

5|$|On {{the other}} hand, the M. schencki prefers {{to feed the}} P. rebeli during times of food shortage. Thus, in periods of starvation, P. rebeli {{caterpillars}} overall exhibit a higher survival rate <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> M. schencki larvae.|$|E
5|$|Western Azores {{goldcrest}} R. r. inermis (Murphy & Chapin, 1929). Resident on Flores, Faial, Terceira, São Jorge and Pico, Azores; its upper-parts are {{a darker}} olive-green <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nominate form, and the underparts are also darker.|$|E
5|$|Adult Pteranodon {{specimens}} {{from the}} two major species {{can be divided into}} two distinct size classes. The smaller class of specimens have small, rounded head crests and very wide pelvic canals, even wider <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> much larger size class. The size of the pelvic canal probably allowed the laying of eggs, indicating that these smaller adults are females. The larger size class, representing male individuals, have narrow hips and very large crests, which were probably for display.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the living}} {{conditions}} for black soldiers gradually improved, {{they were still}} kept in considerably worse ones <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> white French soldiers, and the mortality rate among black soldiers was also considerably higher. Around 10,000 North African prisoners were released in 1941. Escapes and repatriations {{reduced the number of}} colonial prisoners of war to 30,000 by July 1944.|$|E
5|$|Cold water {{fishing is}} {{available}} in Black Moshannon Creek and several of its tributaries, where anglers will find rainbow and brown trout that have been stocked there for sport fishing by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. Black Moshannon Lake's waters are warmer <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> creek, and so hold many different species of fish, including largemouth bass, muskellunge, yellow perch, chain pickerel, bullhead catfish, northern pike, bluegill, and crappie.|$|E
5|$|Heterodox economists {{adhere to}} {{theories}} sufficiently {{outside the mainstream}} to be marginalized and treated as irrelevant by the establishment. Initially, heterodox economists including Joan Robinson, worked alongside mainstream economists, but heterodox groups isolated themselves and created insular groups in the late 1960s and 1970s. Present day heterodox economists often publish in their own journals rather <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mainstream and eschew formal modeling {{in favor of more}} abstract theoretical work.|$|E
50|$|Although, as {{contemporary}} critics repeatedly remarked, <b>the</b> libretti <b>of</b> Gilberts burlesques {{were more}} literate and intelligent <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> genre, he nonetheless followed <b>the</b> conventional formula <b>of</b> rhyming couplets and tortuous puns, together {{with plenty of}} young actresses in tights or short dresses, which were <b>the</b> mainstays <b>of</b> Victorian burlesque.|$|R

50|$|While <b>the</b> {{compressive}} properties <b>of</b> plastic lumber {{are equal}} or greater <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> wood, <b>the</b> modulus <b>of</b> elasticity is very low. Moreover, plastic lumber {{is subject to}} far more creep than wood.|$|R
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the buildings of the early Badami Chalukyas, whose monuments were clustered around the metropoleis of Pattadakal, Aihole, and Badami, these Western Chalukya temples are widely dispersed, reflecting a system of local government and decentralisation. The Western Chalukya temples were smaller <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> early Chalukyas, a fact discernible in the reduced height of the superstructures which tower over the shrines.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, {{the female}} purple-throated cotinga {{is a dark}} brown with pale buffy margins on the upperparts. The underparts are a buffy {{cinnamon}} with black barring. The throat is a deeper, unbarred rufous in coloration. The female's tail feathers are longer and more pointed at the tip <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> male. The juvenile purple-throated cotinga resembles a paler, buffier female; the plumage of the immature is undescribed.|$|E
5|$|Social {{divisions}} {{did appear}} both between southern and northern Finland and within rural Finland. The economy and {{society of the}} north had modernized more slowly <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> south, there was a more pronounced conflict between Christianity and socialism in the north, and farmland had a major social status; ownership of even a small parcel of land created a motivation {{to fight against the}} Reds.|$|E
50|$|B. davidii var. superba is chiefly {{distinguished}} by <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> its fragrant, violet-purple panicles, {{which are more}} <b>than</b> double <b>the</b> length <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> type, and even longer <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> magnifica. <b>The</b> plant is otherwise like the type.|$|R

5|$|T. m. achrusterus breeds from {{southern}} Oklahoma east to Maryland and western Virginia and south to northern Florida and the Gulf states. It winters {{through much of}} {{the southern part of the}} breeding range. It is smaller than the nominate subspecies. The black feathers of the forehead and crown have pale gray tips. The underparts are paler <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nominate subspecies.|$|E
5|$|T. m. nigrideus breeds from coastal {{northern}} Quebec to Labrador and Newfoundland and winters {{from southern}} Newfoundland south {{through most of}} the eastern US states to southern Louisiana, southern Mississippi and northern Georgia. It is uniformly darker or blackish on the head, with a dark gray back. The underparts are slightly more red <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nominate subspecies.|$|E
5|$|The Harrier II {{retains the}} {{tandem landing gear}} layout of the first-generation Harriers, {{although}} each outrigger landing gear leg was moved from the wingtip to mid-span for a tighter turning radius when taxiing. The engine intakes are larger <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first-generation Harrier, and have a revised inlet. On {{the underside of the}} fuselage, McDonnell Douglas added lift-improvement devices, which capture the reflected engine exhaust when close to the ground, giving the equivalent of up to 1,200lb (544kg) of extra lift.|$|E

5|$|The {{discharge}} of Nanticoke Creek downstream of the Truesdale Mine Discharge ranges from 0.019 to 40 {{cubic feet per}} second, {{with a mean of}} 6.3 cubic feet per second. The {{discharge of}} the creek at its mouth was measured to be 3.8 cubic feet per second in June 1999 and 8.2 cubic feet per second in October 1999. Both values were significantly lower <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nearby Newport Creek.|$|E
5|$|The {{in-depth}} {{studies of}} the juridic classical works in Beirut, and later in Constantinople, conferred an unprecedented scientific dimension to jurisprudence; this academic movement {{gave rise to the}} minds behind Justinian's juridic reforms. As a result of the new understanding of the classical juridic texts, the imperial laws of the late 5th and early 6th centuries were clearer and more coherent <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> early Postclassical Era, according to legal historian George Mousourakis and other scholars.|$|E
5|$|The outer {{region of}} the Solar System {{is home to the}} giant planets and their large moons. The centaurs and many short-period comets also orbit in this region. Due to their greater {{distance}} from the Sun, the solid objects in the outer Solar System contain a higher proportion of volatiles, such as water, ammonia, and methane <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inner Solar System because the lower temperatures allow these compounds to remain solid.|$|E
30|$|These {{are just}} two of ozone-formation’s complexities, which are greater <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other {{criteria}} pollutants. This complexity is only partially incorporated in existing impact assessment methods. Work to incorporate them further is recommended. An initial step would be to map the speciated hydrocarbon emissions as defined by [36] against the factors and units used in TRACI or ReCiPe endpoint, and to introduce more differentiated factors into ReCiPe.|$|R
50|$|The Omnium de Deux Ans was the country's richest {{race for}} two-year-olds until 1914. Its prize fund was greater <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> both <b>the</b> Prix Morny and the Grand Critérium. It was {{abandoned}} throughout World War I, with no running from 1915 to 1918.|$|R
