40|$|Peptide chain {{termination}} is {{a result}} of at least two events: <b>terminator</b> <b>codon</b> recognition and hydrolysis of peptidyl tRNA. A protein factor S, isolated from the supernatant of Escherichia coli B, stimulates fMet release. Factor S lowers the Km for terminator trinucleotides without altering the Vmax of release and therefore acts at <b>terminator</b> <b>codon</b> recognition. The S protein differs from initiation factors, elongation factor G, several forms of elongation factor T and release factors. The importance of the 2 % Tu content in purified S is unresolved...|$|E

Using these mutant fragments Mo-MuLV proviral DNA has been reassembled and cloned into pBR 322. Examination of the mutant proviral DNAs in mouse culture cells indicates that a <b>terminator</b> <b>codon</b> at the gag-pol junction is essential for function, but {{any of the three}} chain terminator codons gives an active virus.

Less extensive data for 18 S RNA {{from a number of}} other eukaryotes are consistent with the same 3 ′-terminal sequence, and an identical sequence has previously been reported for the 3 ′-end of rabbit reticulocyte 18 S rRNA (Hunt, 1970). These results suggest that the base sequence in this region is strongly conserved and may be identical in all eukaryotes. As the 3 ′-terminal hexanucleotide is complementary to eukaryotic <b>terminator</b> <b>codons</b> we discuss the possibility that the 3 ′-end of 18 S rRNA may have a direct base-pairing role in the termination of protein synthesis...|$|R
40|$|The major immediate-early (IE) gene region mapping at {{coordinates}} 0. 71 to 0. 74 in {{the genome}} of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) {{gives rise to}} a series of overlapping spliced IE mRNAs that are all under the transcriptional control of the complex IE 68 promoter-enhancer region. We show here that one of the phosphorylated nuclear proteins encoded by this region behaves as a powerful but nonspecific trans-activator of gene expression. In transient chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) assay experiments with Vero cells all relatively weak heterologous target promoters tested, including those of herpes simplex virus IE 175 and delayed-early genes, adenovirus E 3, the enhancerless simian virus 40 early gene, and the human beta interferon gene, were stimulated between 30 - and 800 -fold by cotransfection with the HindIII C fragment of HCMV (Towne) DNA. In contrast, expression of the homologous HCMV IE 68 -CAT gene but not SV 2 -CAT was specifically repressed. Inactivation mapping studies of the effector DNA, together with dose-response comparisons with subclones from the region, revealed that an intact 7. 1 -kilobase sequence encompassing both the IE 1 and IE 2 coding regions (exons 1 to 5) in the major IE transcription complex was required for both the nonspecific trans-activation and autoregulatory responses. The IE 1 coding region alone (exons 1 to 4) was inactive, but both functions were restored by insertion of the IE 2 coding region (exon 5) in the correct orientation downstream from the IE 1 coding region. Internal deletions or inserted <b>terminator</b> <b>codons</b> in IE 1 (exon 4) still gave efficient trans-activation and autoregulation, whereas the insertion of <b>terminator</b> <b>codons</b> in IE 2 (exon 5) abolished both activities. Finally, IE 2 (exon 5) sequences only (under the direct transcriptional control of the strong simian CMV IE 94 promoter) were still able to specifically down regulate IE 68 -CAT expression but failed to exhibit trans-activation properties. Therefore, the IE 2 gene product(s) of HCMV appear likely to be key control proteins involved in gene regulation during HCMV infection...|$|R

To explore the cis-acting sequence requirements for the readthrough event in vivo, we generated a library of mutants of the Moloney murine leukemia virus with point mutations near the <b>terminator</b> <b>codon</b> and tested the mutant viral DNAs for the ability to direct synthesis of the gag-pol fusion protein and formation of infectious virus. The analysis showed that sequences 3 ' to the terminator are necessary and sufficient for the process. The results do not support a role for one proposed stem-loop structure that includes the terminator but {{are consistent with the}} involvement of another stem-loop 3 ' to the terminator. One mutant, containing two compensatory changes in this stem structure, was temperature sensitive for replication and for formation of the gag-pol protein.

40|$|Simian virus 40 -based {{plasmids}} {{that direct}} {{the synthesis of}} preproinsulin during short-term transfection of COS cells {{have been used to}} probe the mechanism of reinitiation by eucaryotic ribosomes. Earlier studies from several laboratories had established that the ability of ribosomes to reinitiate translation at an internal AUG codon depends on having a <b>terminator</b> <b>codon</b> in frame with the preceding AUG triplet and upstream from the intended restart site. In the present studies, the position of the upstream <b>terminator</b> <b>codon</b> relative to the preproinsulin restart site has been systematically varied. The efficiency of reinitiation progressively improved as the intercistronic sequence was lengthened. When the upstream "minicistron" terminated 79 nucleotides before the preproinsulin start site, the synthesis of proinsulin was as efficient as if there were no upstream AUG codons. A mechanism is postulated that might account for this result, which is somewhat surprising inasmuch as bacterial ribosomes reinitiate less efficiently as the intercistronic gap is widened...|$|E
40|$|Molecular cloning of a cDNA has {{established}} {{the sequence of}} the translated portion of the mRNA for rat spleen thymosin beta 4. The presence of a methionyl initiator codon immediately preceding the codon for the first seryl residue of mature thymosin beta 4 {{is consistent with previous}} results indicating the absence of a signal peptide in the product translated in vitro from rat spleen mRNA. The cDNA sequence analysis also established the presence of two <b>terminator</b> <b>codons</b> immediately following the codon for the COOH-terminal seryl residue. Thymosin beta 4 is thus synthesized as a 5100 -dalton peptide containing 44 amino acid residues. Removal of the initiator methionyl residue and acetylation of the NH 2 -terminal serine residue would yield mature thymosin beta 4 containing 43 amino acids. The absence of a signal peptide makes it unlikely that thymosin beta 4 is a secreted peptide...|$|R
40|$|In vivo {{treatment}} of susceptible Escherichia coli cultures with low concentrations of dihydrostreptomycin {{leads to a}} decline in polysomes and a corresponding increase in 70 S particles which behave as run-off ribosomes, as well as free 30 S and 50 S subunits. We have examined the timing and extent of these effects on ribosomes and compared them to the effects of this antibiotic on growth and protein synthesis. We have shown that no changes in ribosome distribution are observed until growth inhibition by dihydrostreptomycin is almost complete. Thus, intracellular dihydrostreptomycin can inhibit growth and net protein synthesis without apparently affecting the ribosome cycle. Since it is known that the antibiotic combines with free 30 S subunits, the question is how such combination can bring about the observed inhibition of protein synthesis and growth. We suggest that specific interaction of intracellular antibiotic with proteins of the 30 S subunits allows repeated use of the ribosome cycle by such affected particles, but with selective misreading of certain amino acid <b>codons</b> as <b>terminator</b> <b>codons,</b> so that they produce incomplete polypeptide chains. The cumulative effect of such a mechanism would lead to eventual cessation of protein synthesis and growth...|$|R

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of reinitiation in mammalian translation systems depends {{in part on}} the size and arrangement of upstream open reading frames (upORFs). The gradual decrease in reinitiation as an upORF is lengthened, confirmed here using a variety of sequences, might reflect time-dependent loss of protein factors required for reinitiation. Consistent with the idea that the duration of elongation is what matters, reinitiation was nearly abolished when a pseudoknot that causes a pause in elongation was inserted into a short upORF. Control experiments showed that this transient pause in elongation had little effect on the final protein yield when the pseudoknot was moved from the upORF into the main ORF. Thus, the deleterious effect of slowing elongation is limited to the reinitiation mode. Another aspect of reinitiation investigated here is whether post-termination ribosomes can scan backwards to initiate at AUG codons positioned upstream from the <b>terminator</b> <b>codon.</b> Earlier studies that raised this possibility may have been complicated by the occurrence of leaky scanning along with reinitiation. Re-examination of the question, using constructs that preclude leaky scanning, shows barely detectable reinitiation from an AUG codon positioned 4 nt upstream from the <b>terminator</b> <b>codon</b> and no detectable reinitiation from an AUG codon positioned farther upstream. These experiments carried out with synthetic transcripts help to define the circumstances under which reinitiation may be expected to occur in the growing number of natural mRNAs that deviate from the simple first AUG rule...|$|E
40|$|The early {{region of}} simian virus 40 codes {{for at least}} two immunologically related polypeptides: large-T and small-t, with {{apparent}} molecular weights of 90, 000 - 100, 000 and 15, 000 - 20, 000, respectively. Because small-t shares methionine-containing tryptic peptides with large-T, the two polypeptides are probably coded, in part, by a common nucleotide sequence. To locate the coding sequences for large-T and small-t in the DNA, the production of these proteins was examined after infection of CV- 1 cells with wild-type and deletion mutants of simian virus 40. We found that a deletion at the distal portion of the early region alters the structure of large-T but not of small-t; but deletions within the region between map coordinates 0. 59 and 0. 55 result in an alteration or absence of small-t and a normal large-T. These findings have been rationalized by a model that proposes the existence of two early mRNAs, one coding for large-T and the other for small-t. Both mRNAs span virtually the entire early region; but the mRNA coding for large-T lacks the nucleotide sequence between map coordinates 0. 59 and 0. 54. We suggest that small-t is translated from the larger of the two mRNAs, beginning at or near its 5 ′ end and terminating at a termination codon at about map coordinate 0. 54. Larger-T, on the other hand, is translated from the shorter mRNA, beginning at the same initiator codon, and, because of the deletion of the <b>terminator</b> <b>codon</b> at 0. 54, translation proceeds to the <b>terminator</b> <b>codon</b> at or near map position 0. 18...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{translational}} {{regulatory mechanism}} for Tomato golden mosaic virus (TGMV) complementary-sense gene expression has been characterized. TGMV transcribes two mRNAs, AL- 1935 and AL- 1629 transcripts, {{both of which}} contain the AL 2 and AL 3 open reading frames. However, AL 2 is only expressed from AL- 1629 whereas AL 3 is expressed from both. Three AUG translation initiation codons are located upstream of both the AL 2 and AL 3 coding regions, within the 5 ′-untranslated region (UTR) of the AL- 1935 transcript. Translation can initiate at the first AUG, specifying the C-terminal 122 amino acids of the AL 1 protein (cAL 1). Initiation of translation at this AUG is inhibitory for the downstream expression of both AL 2 and AL 3. This is most likely due to the <b>terminator</b> <b>codon</b> of cAL 1 being positioned after the AUG initiation codon for the AL 2 ORF. The mechanism by which AL 3 is expressed from AL- 1935 is currently unknown but {{a gap between the}} cAL 1 termination codon and the start of AL 3 suggests that it may involve reinitiation and/or internal initiation. In contrast, expression of AL 3 from AL- 1629 most likely occurs via leaky ribosome scanning since the AL 3 initiation codon occurs before the <b>terminator</b> <b>codon</b> of AL 2. Mutation of the AUG encoding cAL 1 in the curtovirus, Spinach curly top virus, leads to increased infectivity as measured by a shorter latent period. Together this suggests that geminiviruses use a post-translational regulatory mechanism to regulate the synthesis of viral proteins important for replication and suppression of host defenses...|$|E

Hb Ms as a couse of herediatary nigremia marked the first stage of hemoglobinopahthy research in Japan, and a variety of unstable hemoglobins causing hemolytic disease the second stage. Although the prevalence of vaints of Hb A (α or β) among Japanese was estimated to be only 1 : thousands, they ware rich in varietry. Virtually all types of abnormal Hbs were found among Japanese: hereditary nigremia, unstable Hb hemolytic disease, hyperunatable Hb disease mimicking a relatively severe form of thalassemia sydrom sydrome, hereditary erythremia due to high oxygen affinity Hbs, and so on. Most Hb variants ware clinically silent, but some of them showed unique properties of intrest. Thalassemia (thal) traits ware more frequent than the structural variants of Hb A (1 : 1000 for β-thal, more for α-thal).

40|$|The {{structure}} of the maize streak virus genome (Kenyan isolate, MSV-K), as determined from the sequence of clones obtained from DNA isolated from virus particles, is composed of one major DNA component of about 2. 6 kb. MSV virion DNA is partially double-stranded, composed of a full-length virion (V) strand and a short (70 - 80 b) primer (P) strand. The primer strand has a fixed 5 '-end capped with alkaline labile material, presumably 1 - 2 ribonucleotides. The MSV genome has two major coding regions oriented on opposite strands and flanked by two small intergenic regions. The coding region on the P strand is composed of two major open reading frames (ORFs), arranged in tandem {{and in the same}} reading frame. Because the predicted protein derived from a composite of these two ORFs closely corresponds to the product from a single ORF in the cassava latent virus genome, it is likely that this region encodes two proteins with common amino-termini, one a read-through product of the amber <b>codon</b> <b>terminator</b> in the first ORF.

40|$|A {{model is}} {{proposed}} {{that accounts for}} regulation of the histidine operon by a mechanism involving alternative configuration of mRNA secondary structure (the alternative stem model). New evidence for the model includes sequence data on three regulatory mutations. The first (hisO 1242) is a mutation that deletes sequences needed to form the attenuator mRNA stem and causes constitutive operon expression. The second mutation (hisO 9654) is a His- ochre (UAA) mutation in the leader peptide gene; {{the existence of this}} mutation constitutes evidence that the leader peptide gene is translated. The third mutation (hisO 9663) is remarkable. It neither generates a nonsense codon nor affects a translated sequence; yet, it is suppressible by amber suppressors. We believe this mutation causes a His- phenotype by interfering with mRNA secondary structure. The suppressibility of the mutation is probably due to disruption of the attenuator stem by ribosomes that read through the <b>terminator</b> <b>codon</b> of the leader peptide gene. This explanation is supported by the observation of derepression of a wild-type control region in the presence of an amber suppressor. Evidence is presented that hisT mutants (which lack pseudouridine in the anticodon arm of histidine tRNA) may cause derepression of the his operon by slowing protein synthesis in the leader peptide gene...|$|E
40|$|We have {{examined}} transcripts {{corresponding to the}} Halobacterium halobium bacterio-opsin (BO) gene in wild-type and in BO-deficient mutant strains containing the insertion elements ISH 1 or ISH 2 in the BO gene. BO mRNA from the wild-type strain was purified by hybrid selection using single-stranded cDNA. Labeling by vaccinia virus capping enzyme and [α- 32 P]GTP showed that it contains the 5 ′-terminal nucleotide of the primary transcript. Sequence analysis showed that transcription begins only two nucleotides upstream of the initiator codon for BO. Two species of BO mRNA were found; the major species has a ragged 3 ′ terminus ≈ 45 nucleotides downstream from the <b>terminator</b> <b>codon</b> for BO, while the minor species is about 170 nucleotides longer at the 3 ′ end. Analysis of the transcripts in several BO gene mutant strains by RNA gel-transfer hybridization showed that (i) mutants with ISH 1 insertions within the NH 2 -terminal coding region of the gene contain no detectable transcripts, (ii) mutants with ISH 2 near {{the middle of the}} coding region of the gene contain multiple incomplete transcripts, and (iii) a mutant that is partially BO deficient due to an insertion of ISH 2 100 base pairs upstream of the site of initiation of transcription contains a decreased level of BO mRNA...|$|E
40|$|According to the {{sequence}} of Rccn 4, which is highly similar to the nucleotide-binding site (NBS) coding region of the cereal cyst nematode resistance gene, Cre 3, three 3 ′ nested primers were designed to amplify its 3 ′ flanking region through single oligonucleotide nested polymerase chain reaction (SON-PCR). One 1264 bp band, Rccn-L, was amplified from E- 10, a wheat–Aegilops variabilis translocation line containing the cereal cyst nematode resistance gene from Ae. variabilis. Sequence analysis showed that Rccn-L possesses the 3 ′ flanking sequence of Rccn 4 and contains a 55 bp-sized consensus sequence with Rccn 4. The coding region was 1026 bp, consisting of an incomplete open reading frame, a <b>terminator</b> <b>codon</b> and no initiation codon and intron; it encoded a peptide of 342 amino acid residues and shared 86 % nucleotide sequence identity with Cre 3. The peptide had a conserved leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain, containing the imperfect repeats, XXLXXLXXL, comprising 17 % leucine residues, and shares, respectively, 89 % nucleotide sequence and 78 % amino acid sequence identity with the LRR sequence of the Cre 3 locus. In the present study, SON-PCR was used successfully, for the first time, in plant genome research and {{proved to be a}} valuable method in plant gene cloning. The acquirement of Rccn-L established the foundation for obtaining the complete Rccn gene and further structural and functional investigations...|$|E
40|$|A mango ETHYLENE RESPONSE 1 (ETR 1) gene, {{designated}} MiETR 1 b, {{was isolated}} from the cotyledon of mango (Mangifera indica L. ‘Zihua’) using RT-PCR, and the 5 ′ and 3 ′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends. The full-length cDNA was 2 530 bp, with an open reading frame of 2 220 bp, and it encoded a putative protein of 739 amino acids. The genomic DNA sequence of MiETR 1 b was 4 116 bp in length, having a 3 305 bp sequence from the start to <b>terminator</b> <b>codon,</b> containing six exons and five introns. The deduced amino acids possessed conserved domains of the GAF and HATPase_c superfamilies. A phylogenetic tree analysis indicated that MiETR 1 b had the highest similarity to MiETR 1 from M. [*]indica and a high similarity to CsERS 1, DlETR 1, TcERS 1 and PtETR 1. Quantitative real-time PCR showed that MiETR 1 b was expressed in the proximal and distal cut surfaces throughout the adventitious root formation period. Meanwhile, the expression of MiETR 1 b in the distal cut surface was significantly up-regulated within 6 – 48 [*]h. Pre-treatments with indole- 3 -butyric acid and 2, 3, 5 -triiodobenzoic acid significantly down-regulated MiETR 1 b expression at 1 d and 6 [*]h, respectively. However, more ethylene was produced from 12 to 24 [*]h, while ethylene production decreased after 4 days of culturing. In conclusion, MiETR 1 b might {{play an important role}} during the adventitious root formation of mango cotyledon segments, which is related to ethylene production...|$|E
