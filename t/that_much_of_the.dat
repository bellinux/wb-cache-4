5|$|Because Faulks felt <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> extant World War I {{literature}} was deeply influenced by World War II literature, he deliberately avoided research with secondary documents, such as historical monographs, instead focusing on veteran interviews and period primary sources.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 20th century, {{scholars}} doing {{research into the}} Haymarket affair were surprised to learn <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> primary source documentation relating to the incident (beside materials concerning the trial) was not in Chicago, but had been transferred to then-communist East Berlin.|$|E
5|$|A third species, L. consors, was {{established}} by Marsh in 1894 for YPM 1882, which consists of most of one articulated skeleton and part {{of at least one}} other individual. The skull was only partially preserved, {{and the fact that the}} vertebrae were represented only by centra suggests a partially grown individual. Galton (1983) notes <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> current mounted skeleton was restored in plaster, or had paint applied.|$|E

5|$|Bacliff, like San Leon, and Bayview, {{originated}} as {{a fishing}} community. In 2012 T.J. Aulds of the Galveston County Daily News stated <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> area's economic influence {{moved to the}} corridor along Texas State Highway 146, and that the economy adjusted {{with the growth of}} retail food service outlets and bars. Like San Leon and Bayview, many residents in Bacliff commute to work in Houston.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1968, the {{prospective}} purchases from the six countries amounted to 1,500 aircraft. Canada and Belgium had departed before any long-term commitments {{had been made to}} the programme; Canada had found the project politically unpalatable; there was a perception in political circles <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> manufacturing and specifications were focused on Western Europe. France had made a favourable offer to Belgium on the Dassault Mirage 5, which created doubt as to whether the MRCA would be worthwhile from Belgium's operational perspective.|$|E
5|$|Despite his wealth, he was {{not known}} for a lavish life. His court of about a hundred people was not known for being overly extravagant, he built no luxurious residences, and did not even have a single {{portrait}} of himself made during his life. It is uncertain how Wiśniowiecki looked, although a number of portraits and other works depicting him exist. Jan Widacki notes <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> historiography concerning Wiśniowiecki focuses on the military and political aspects of his life, and few of his critics discuss his successes in the economic development of his estates.|$|E

5|$|During the Second World War, Liverpool's {{importance}} {{as a major}} port saw it become a target for the Luftwaffe and during the May Blitz of 1941, a heavy bomb exploded in the basement, {{on the eastern side}} of the building. The damage from the explosion was significant with the eastern wing being seriously damaged by fire. Nonetheless the building's structural integrity meant <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building could be re-occupied with only temporary repairs. In the aftermath of the war the building was fully restored; the cost of restoration exceeding the original construction costs.|$|E
5|$|In Hamden, Connecticut, the National Guard {{was called}} in to aid in cleanup and keep order, as some looting was {{reported}} in the devastated area. President George H. W. Bush declared the area a disaster area on July 18.

5|$|Jonathan Riley-Smith {{considers}} <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> popular {{understanding of}} the Crusades derives from the novels of Walter Scott and the French histories by Joseph François Michaud.

5|$|Modern {{scholars}} thus generally {{attribute the}} numbers {{given in the}} ancient sources to the result of miscalculations or exaggerations {{on the part of}} the victors, or disinformation by the Persians in the run up to the war. The topic has been hotly debated but the modern consensus revolves around the figure of 300,000500,000. Nevertheless, whatever the real numbers were, it is clear that Xerxes was anxious to ensure a successful expedition by mustering overwhelming numerical superiority by land and by sea, and also <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> army died of starvation and disease, never returning to Asia.|$|E
5|$|Resistance to the {{operation}} by the chosen units meant <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> preparation was not completed. Adolf Hitler ordered the reinforcement of Scandinavia in March and April 1942, before Hardboiled was shelved in May. It is unclear to what extent {{the operation}} contributed to his decision. Despite its limited impact, the operation gave the LCS experience in planning deceptions, and laid the groundwork for future exploitation of Hitler's belief that Northern Europe was strategically important.|$|E
5|$|The {{airfield}} is very {{isolated in}} northwest Utah, {{sitting in the}} middle of a vast wasteland miles away from any major population center. It is probably for this reason, and the dry hot climate, <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> airfield remains today. Still-extant facilities include the vast runway system, numerous ramps, taxiways, dispersal pads, and most of the original hangars (including the Enola Gay B-29 hangar). Most of the hospital complex and many barracks remain, as does a chow hall, chapel, swimming pool and many other World War II-era buildings.|$|E

5|$|The castle {{earthworks}} {{were built}} up from local chalk; the ditches dug around the fortification {{would not have}} provided enough for the mound itself, and local tradition suggests <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earth was quarried instead from the nearby Gallows Pits in the town. The castle was constructed by hand, using workers digging with wooden shovels, and probably without pickaxes. It is estimated that the motte would have taken around 24,000 man days of effort to build.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics; many felt {{that while the}} episode had an interesting theme and <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drama was successful, the humor was too broad or forced. The episode was viewed by 3.44 million viewers and received a 1.8/5 percent rating among adults {{between the ages of}} 18 and 49. The episode ranked fourth in its timeslot, and it was the highest-rated NBC series of the night, though it was lowest rated episode of The Office at the time of airing.|$|E
5|$|The three vinyl LPs and booklet were housed {{inside a}} deep orange-coloured box. The 1991 CD release placed the cover photo {{on a white}} background, however, replicating {{the front of the}} {{original}} album booklet. As commentators noted in 1991, the necessary downsizing to CD dimensions meant <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> effectiveness of the booklet photography was lost, not least because the contents had also been trimmed down to just 36 pages.|$|E

5|$|The wreck timbers {{were found}} under a {{sediment}} that preserved {{the remains of}} the wooden vessel, without which the wreck would have been lost due to marine worms. Wrecks of this age are rare finds and this particular one was in such a good condition <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hull was preserved. This has given us an insight into how ships of this period were constructed—something which has not been seen before as no Arabian ship of this type had previously been found, nor any with their cargo intact.|$|E
5|$|Adopting the {{theories}} of academic historian Patricia Crone as a basis, Holland asserted {{that there was little}} hard evidence for the origins of Islam and asked why it took several decades after the death of Muhammad for his name to appear on surviving documents or artifacts. Arguing that there was little evidence for how the faith was born, he suggested that the city of Mecca {{may not have been the}} real birthplace of Muhammad and Islam, and– while not clearly disputing Muhammad's existence as a real historical figure– claimed <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Islamic origin story was later developed in the early years of the Arab Empire.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of {{the opening}} of the IPO, {{concerns}} were raised among both investors and Manchester United supporters regarding the details of the share offering. Although the share prospectus specified that the proceeds from the sale would go towards paying down the club's debts, it was revealed <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> money would go directly to the Glazers. Furthermore, holders of class A shares would not be entitled to a regular dividend, and the structure of the share issue meant that the Glazers' class B shares had 10 times the voting power of class A shares, essentially denying a controlling interest in the club to anyone but the Glazers. These issues drove down interest and forced a drop in the share price from the planned $16–20 each to $14 each, representing a potential total sale value of $233million (£150million).|$|E
