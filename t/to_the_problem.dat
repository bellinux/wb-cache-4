5|$|A {{number of}} fixed {{structures}} can create structural colours, by mechanisms including diffraction gratings, selective mirrors, photonic crystals, crystal fibres and deformed matrices. Structures can {{be far more}} elaborate than a single thin film: films can be stacked up to give strong iridescence, to combine two colours, or to balance out the inevitable change of colour with angle to give a more diffuse, less iridescent effect. Each mechanism offers a specific solution <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> of creating a bright colour or combination of colours visible from different directions.|$|E

Nuclear reactor accidents still occur and there is no convincing solution <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> of long-lived radioactive waste. Nuclear weapons proliferation continues to occur, notably in Pakistan and North Korea, building on facilities and expertise from civilian nuclear operations. The alternatives to nuclear power, efficient energy use and renewable energy (especially wind power), have been further developed and commercialised.|$|E

The city of Königsberg, Prussia was set on the Pregel River, and included two large islands that were connected {{to each other and}} the mainland by seven bridges. The problem is to decide whether it is possible to follow a path that crosses each bridge exactly once and returns to the starting point. It is not possible: there is no Eulerian circuit. This solution is considered to be the first theorem of graph theory, specifically of planar graph theory.|$|E
