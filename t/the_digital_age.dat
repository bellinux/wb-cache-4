5|$|Superman is {{well known}} for its {{large-scale}} visual effects sequences, all of which were created before <b>the</b> <b>digital</b> <b>age.</b> The Golden Gate Bridge scale model stood 70 feet long and 20 feet wide. Other miniatures included the Krypton Council Dome and the Hoover Dam. Slow motion was used to simulate the vast amount of water for the Hoover Dam destruction. The Fortress of Solitude was a combination of a full-scale set and matte paintings. Young Clark Kent's long-distance football punt was executed with a wooden football loaded into an air blaster placed in the ground. The Superman costume was to be a much darker blue, but the use of blue screen made it transparent.|$|E
5|$|MIT {{has kept}} pace with and helped to advance <b>the</b> <b>digital</b> <b>age.</b> In {{addition}} to developing the predecessors to modern computing and networking technologies, students, staff, and faculty members at Project MAC, the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, and the Tech Model Railroad Club wrote {{some of the earliest}} interactive computer video games like Spacewar! and created much of modern hacker slang and culture. Several major computer-related organizations have originated at MIT since the 1980s: Richard Stallman's GNU Project and the subsequent Free Software Foundation were founded in the mid-1980s at the AI Lab; the MIT Media Lab was founded in 1985 by Nicholas Negroponte and Jerome Wiesner to promote research into novel uses of computer technology; the World Wide Web Consortium standards organization was founded at the Laboratory for Computer Science in 1994 by Tim Berners-Lee; the OpenCourseWare project has made course materials for over 2,000 MIT classes available online free of charge since 2002; and the One Laptop per Child initiative to expand computer education and connectivity to children worldwide was launched in 2005.|$|E

25|$|The {{newspaper}} {{moved into}} <b>the</b> <b>digital</b> <b>age</b> beginning in 1986 when City Editor Bill MacKenzie {{was given the}} assignment to find a publishing system.

The classified system was upgraded in early 2005; the editorial system by year's end.|$|E
25|$|There {{is little}} {{discussion}} of Chinese animation in English. Daisy Yan Du's PhD dissertation, On the Move: The Trans/national Animated Film in 1940s-1970s China (University of Wisconsin-Madison, 2012), {{is by far}} the most systematic analysis of early Chinese animation before 1980. Weihua Wu’s PhD dissertation, Animation in Postsocialist China: Visual Narrative, Modernity, and Digital Culture (City University of Hong Kong, 2006), discusses contemporary Chinese animation in <b>the</b> <b>digital</b> <b>age</b> after 1980. Besides the two major works, there are other articles and book chapters written by John Lent, Paola Voci, Mary Farquhar, and others about Chinese animation.|$|E

25|$|In 1980, the National Language Authority of Pakistan {{developed}} a new keyboard layout for typewriters based on Naskh script. The keyboard had 46 keys to type 71 Urdu consonants, vowels, diacritics, and punctuation marks, and 21 key symbols for arithmetic calculations and digits. However, {{with the arrival of}} <b>the</b> <b>digital</b> <b>age,</b> the layout became inadequate for computerised processing that required software backup to select the shape of the character appropriate to the context, and the ability to store multiple language character sets. These issues were addressed through the standardisation of keyboard for a bilingual teleprinter to use both English and Urdu. The new layout was found appropriate for use in computer-based applications and was immediately adopted with modifications for word processors.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{retailers}} typically make {{a variety}} of strategic level decisions including the type of store, the market to be served, the optimal product assortment, customer service, supporting services and the store's overall market positioning. Once the strategic retail plan is in place, retailers devise the retail mix which includes product, price, place, promotion, personnel and presentation. In <b>the</b> <b>digital</b> <b>age,</b> {{an increasing number of}} retailers are seeking to reach broader markets by selling through multiple channels, including both bricks and mortar and online retailing. Digital technologies are also changing the way that consumers pay for goods and services. Retailing support services may also include the provision of credit, delivery services, advisory services, stylist services and a range of other supporting services.|$|E
25|$|Before the {{computer}} age, the bookbinding trade involved two divisions. First, there was Stationery binding (known as vellum binding in the trade) {{which deals with}} making new books {{to be written into}} and intended for handwritten entries such as accounting ledgers, business journals, blank books, and guest log books, along with other general office stationery such as note books, manifold books, day books, diaries, portfolios, etc. Second was Letterpress binding which deals with making new books intended to be read from and includes library binding, fine binding, edition binding, and publisher's bindings. A result of the new bindings is a third division dealing with the repair, restoration, and conservation of old used bindings. With <b>the</b> <b>digital</b> <b>age,</b> personal computers have replaced the pen and paper based accounting that used to drive most of the work in the stationery binding industry.|$|E
