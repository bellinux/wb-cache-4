5|$|Some {{degree of}} {{self-regulation}} occurs whereby {{banks and other}} financial institutions attempt to operate within guidelines set and published by multilateral {{organizations such as the}} International Monetary Fund or the Bank for International Settlements (particularly the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the Committee on the Global Financial System). Further examples of international regulatory bodies are: the Financial Stability Board (FSB) established to coordinate information and activities among developed countries; the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) which coordinates the regulation of financial securities; the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) which promotes consistent insurance industry supervision; the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering which facilitates collaboration in battling money laundering and terrorism financing; and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) which publishes accounting and auditing standards. Public and private arrangements exist to assist and guide countries struggling with sovereign debt payments, such as the Paris Club and London Club. National securities commissions and independent financial regulators maintain oversight of their industries' foreign exchange market activities. Two examples of supranational financial regulators in Europe are <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Banking</b> <b>Authority</b> (EBA) which identifies systemic risks and institutional weaknesses and may overrule national regulators, and the European Shadow Financial Regulatory Committee (ESFRC) which reviews financial regulatory issues and publishes policy recommendations.|$|E

To complement this framework, {{there is also a}} European Systemic Risk Board under the responsibility of the ECB. The aim of this financial control system is to ensure the economic stability of the EU.|$|E
2500|$|Among {{the most}} {{important}} governance standards are rights vote for {{who is on the}} board of directors for investors of labour and capital. A Draft Fifth Company Law Directive proposed in 1972, which would have required EU-wide rights for employees to vote for boards stalled mainly because it attempted to require two-tier board structures, although most EU member states have codetermination today with unified boards. The Shareholder Rights Directive 2007 requires shareholders be able to make proposals, ask questions at meetings, vote by proxy and vote through intermediaries. This has become increasingly important as most company shares are held by institutional investors (primarily asset managers or banks, depending on the member state) who are holding [...] "other people's money". A large proportion of this money comes from employees and other people saving for retirement, but who do not have an effective voice. Unlike Switzerland after a 2013 people's initiative, or the U.S. Dodd-Frank Act 2010 in relation to brokers, the EU has not yet prevented intermediaries casting votes without express instructions of beneficiaries. This concentrates power into a small number of financial institutions, and creates the potential for conflicts of interest where financial institutions sell retirement, banking or products to companies in which they cast votes with other people's money. A series of rights for ultimate investors exist in the Institutions for Occupational Retirement Provision Directive 2003. This requires duties of disclosure in how a retirement fund is run, funding and insurance to guard against insolvency, but not yet that voting rights are only cast on the instructions of investors. By contrast, the Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities Directive 2009 does suggest that investors in a mutual fund or ("collective investment scheme") should control the voting rights. The UCITS Directive 2009 is primarily concerned with creating a [...] "passport". If a firm complies with rules on authorisation, and governance of the management and investment companies in an overall fund structure, it can sell its shares in a collective investment scheme across the EU. This forms a broader package of Directives on securities and financial market regulation, much of which has been shaped by experience in the banking crisis of 2007–08. Additional rules on remuneration practices, separating depositary bodies in firms from management and investment companies, and more penalties for violations were inserted in 2014. These measures are meant to decrease the risk to investors that an investment goes insolvent. The Markets in Financial Instruments Directive 2004 applies to other businesses selling financial instruments. It requires similar authorisation procedures to have a [...] "passport" [...] to sell in any EU country, and transparency of financial contracts through duties to disclose material information about products being sold, including disclosure of potential conflicts of interest with clients. The Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive 2011 applies to firms with massive quantities of capital, over €100million, essentially hedge funds and private equity firms. Similarly, it requires authorisation to sell products EU wide, and then basic transparency requirements on products being sold, requirements in remuneration policies for fund managers that are perceived to reduce [...] "risk" [...] or make pay [...] "performance" [...] related. They do not, however, require limits to pay. There are general prohibitions on conflicts of interest, and specialised prohibitions on asset stripping. The Solvency II Directive 2009 is directed particularly at insurance firms, requiring minimum capital and best practices in valuation of assets, again to avoid insolvency. The Capital Requirements Directives contain analogous rules, with a similar goals, for banks. To administer the new rules, the European System of Financial Supervision was established in 2011, and consists of three main branches: the European Securities and Markets Authority in Paris, <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Banking</b> <b>Authority</b> in London and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority in Frankfurt.|$|E

Our analysis of the results for the 51 banking groups suggests that not economic growth but rather the exposures to non-performing loans (NPLs) and to governments and corporates seem to be the main drivers behind the impact of the adverse scenario.

40|$|The latest {{financial}} crisis has exposed substantial {{weaknesses in the}} bank risk models used by national regulators {{as well as the}} Basel Accords. The study is aimed at presenting the evolution and critique of risk measures and risk models in banking, with a special focus on the dynamically developing area of systemic risk measures. A discussion of the features of the respective measures allows us to draw conclusions for banking regulations based on the analyzed models and to present the main challenges for regulators in terms of bank risk measurement. The study shows that substantial challenges for regulators include compensating for the drawbacks of the Value at Risk (VaR) and expected shortfall risk models, resolving the pro-cyclicality in risk modeling, improving the techniques of stress testing, and addressing the fallacy of composition in banking (i. e., to model risk from a systemic point of view and not only from the perspective of an individual bank). As the discussion concerning proper risk measurement in regulatory frameworks, such as the Basel Accord or <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Banking</b> <b>Authority's</b> (EBA) rules is in progress, the topic seems to be of particular importance; moreover, measures of systemic risk are not yet a subject of regulation...|$|R

40|$|This is {{the final}} version of the article. It first {{appeared}} from Springer via [URL] <b>European</b> <b>Banking</b> <b>Authority</b> (EBA), an EU agency that works to ensure effective and consistent prudential regulation and supervision across <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>banking</b> sector as a whole, was established several years before <b>the</b> <b>European</b> Central <b>Bank</b> (ECB) became responsible for the prudential supervision of euro area banks. The ECB’s assumption of supervisory responsibilities has prompted searching questions about whether the EBA can continue to add value. The EBA could function as the bridge between the ECB and the supervisory authorities of the Member States that do not participate in <b>European</b> <b>Banking</b> Union and, as such, could help to preserve the integrity of the Single Market. This article locates the EBA’s prospects for success in this role more in its ability to manage co-existence than to direct the conduct of supervision. The inquiry is placed within lines of governance scholarship that have moved away from simple ‘command and control’ models to more complex frameworks. The inquiry is supported by detailed examination of the EBA’s performance in key areas, including rule-making, interpretation, and stress testing. Close study reveals that the EBA cannot be expected significantly to prove its value on the supervisory side through its use of formal intervention powers because these powers are an uneasy fit with its hybrid structure and governance arrangements. This finding does not mean that the EBA is incapacitated: rather, the fact that its effectiveness relies more on facilitation than on threats suggests that the EBA is actually well-equipped to make progress in its unifying role...|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>European</b> {{single market}} {{supported}} {{the creation of}} multinational <b>banking</b> groups. However, <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>banking</b> directives and <b>the</b> single license system were built along {{the model of the}} stand-alone bank and cannot keep pace with recent market developments. The national character of prudential supervision determines at least three sets of negative consequences for cross-border banking groups: higher compliance and enforcement costs; national solutions rather than cross-border cooperation between supervisors; greater systemic risks as a consequence of coordination failures. In this paper we argue that there is a strong case for further centralization of supervision and crisis management. Recent reforms in Europe, including the creation of a <b>European</b> <b>Banking</b> <b>Authority,</b> move in <b>the</b> right direction, but they still rely too heavily on cooperation between national authorities. While (enhanced) coordination may be effective in normal times, in emergency situations national authorities tend to behave strategically and exploit information asymmetries. As shown by the recent crisis, misalignment of incentives can lead them to national bias and non-cooperative dominant strategies. We argue that early intervention measures and crisis resolution tools should be reserved to a pan-European authority. Also ongoing supervision should be centralized, so as to avoid an inefficient transfer of powers to a single resolution authority at the outset of a crisis...|$|R
