5|$|Calafia meets Radiaro, a Moslem warrior who convinces {{her that}} she should join him in retaking Constantinople from the Christian armies holding it. Calafia, in turn, convinces her people to take their ships, weapons, armor, riding beasts, and 500 griffins, and sail with her to Constantinople to fight the Christians, though she has no concept {{of what it means}} to be Moslem or Christian. Her {{subjects}} arm themselves with weapons and armor made of gold, as there is no other metal in California. <b>They</b> <b>fill</b> their ships with supplies and hasten to sea.|$|E
5|$|In Europe the DVD and Blu-ray was {{released}} on November 26, 2010, by Kazé. British distributor Manga Entertainment announced in January 2010 they had licensed Summer Wars for the United Kingdom, and {{was released}} in March 2011. In North America, Funimation released Summer Wars on DVD and Blu-ray on February 15, 2011. The North American DVD and Blu-ray releases included previews, and the interviews with Hosoda, Kamiki, Sakuraba, Fuji, Tanimura and Saitō. The first press copies included art cards. To get out enough copies to meet demand some did not ship with the OZ O-card (cardboard slip-cover), as it required specialty printing that takes longer to produce {{than the rest of}} the product. Funimation offered to send out the O-Card to customers who did not receive one as soon as they are available if <b>they</b> <b>fill</b> out a request form on their official website.|$|E

25|$|Throughout 2006 BP, led {{by their}} CEO Lord John Browne, has {{continued}} to take a leadership stance on climate change. It has cut its own operational emissions of CO2 by 10%. It is investing $8 billion in renewable energy over the next 10 years. And most recently it has launched a 'target zero' campaign in the UK to encourage its customers to offset their vehicle emissions when <b>they</b> <b>fill</b> up at the petrol station.|$|E
25|$|Since 2009, Radwańska and {{her sister}} Urszula have devoted time during the {{off-season}} to Szlachetna Paczka ("Noble Box"). The charity has its volunteers go door-to-door throughout the year compiling a database of families in need, asking them what would help ease {{the pressures of the}} holidays. Then, for a three-week period from mid-November to early December, donors are given a list to take with them to the supermarket, where <b>they</b> <b>fill</b> a shopping cart with the food, clothing and more to donate to them.|$|E

25|$|In 2014, it was {{reported}} that the Los Angeles Unified School District and the San Diego Unified School District acquired MRAPs for the school police. Organizations have become critical about police use of military vehicles and worried about police militarization. Proponents of the domestic acquisitions argue <b>they</b> <b>fill</b> the same role as the standard police Lenco BearCat armored vehicles. Proponents, such as Sgt. Dan Downing of the Morgan County Sheriff's Department, said the unique mine resistant capability is important as veterans leaving the military may have learned about making IEDs.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{arrangements}} under which general practitioners {{can work in}} the UK. While the main career aim is becoming a principal or partner in a GP surgery, many become salaried or non-principal GPs, work in hospitals in GP-led acute care units, or perform locum work. Whichever of these roles <b>they</b> <b>fill,</b> {{the vast majority of}} GPs receive most of their income from the National Health Service (NHS). Principals and partners in GP surgeries are self-employed, but they have contractual arrangements with the NHS which give them considerable predictability of income.|$|E

25|$|Biological invasions are {{composed}} of exotic biota that enter a landscape and replace species with which they share similarities in structure and ecological function. Because they multiply and grow quickly, invasive species can eliminate or greatly reduce existing flora and fauna by various mechanisms, such as direct competitive exclusion. Invasive species typically spread {{at a faster rate}} when they have no natural predators or when <b>they</b> <b>fill</b> an empty niche. These invasions often occur in a historical context and are classified as a type of human-mediated disturbance called human-mediated invasions.|$|E

After this, students are given a cloze passage testing comprehension as opposed to grammar, which currently has a weight of 15 in which <b>they</b> <b>fill</b> in blanks with words on their own. Students are then given a passage to comprehend, and will have to answer ten open-ended questions with a total weight of 20.|$|E
25|$|The Passing DLC {{campaign}} {{takes place}} between Dead Center and Dark Carnival, {{and after the}} events of The Sacrifice campaign. The Survivors of L4D2 arrive at the bridge in Rayford, where they meet Francis, Louis, and Zoey. As they need to cross the bridge to proceed, the Survivors need to find another way across to refill the generator with gas. After fighting {{their way through a}} wedding reception (complete with a Witch bride), the streets, and a historic under-the-river tour, they meet up again with the original Survivors, who help by covering for the group while <b>they</b> <b>fill</b> the generator and lowering the bridge once it's full.|$|E

25|$|The {{inscriptions}} on the stele are badly preserved. <b>They</b> <b>fill</b> {{the negative}} {{spaces in the}} scenes and run continuously {{from one side to}} the other. The text is written in Sumerian cuneiform script. From these inscriptions, it is known that the stele was commissioned by Eannatum, an ensi or ruler of Lagash around 2460 BC. On it, he describes a conflict with Umma over a tract of agricultural land located between the two city-states. The conflict ends in a battle in which Eannatum, described as the beloved of the god Ningirsu, triumphs over Umma. After the battle, the leader of Umma swears that he will not transgress into the territory of Lagash again upon penalty of divine punishment.|$|E
25|$|Wetlands are an {{important}} part of the Reno/Tahoe area. They act as a natural filter for the solids that come out of the water treatment plant. Plant roots absorb nutrients from the water and naturally filter it. Wetlands are home to over 75% of the species in the Great Basin. However, the area's wetlands are at risk of being destroyed due to development around the city. While developers build on top of the wetlands <b>they</b> <b>fill</b> them with dirt, destroying the habitat they create for the plants and animals. Washoe County has devised a plan that will help protect these ecosystems: mitigation. In the future, when developers try to build over a wetland, they will be responsible for creating another wetland near Washoe Lake.|$|E
25|$|UDDTs with {{a single}} vault have {{interchangeable}} containers to collect the fecal material. Depending {{on the size of}} the vault, two or more containers can be stored inside. Containers should be limited to a maximum volume of approximately 50 litres, so that they still can be manually moved when <b>they</b> <b>fill</b> up. Once a container is full, it can be left for further dehydration or removed for further treatment. Removal of the container requires care due to fresh, potentially pathogen-loaded feces being on top of the pile in the container. Because of the limited ventilation within a plastic bucket, such single-vault UDDTs may not reduce the pathogen load as effectively as double-vault UDDTs. Therefore, a post-treatment of the fecal material is usually required. This can be achieved through further dehydration, composting processes or heat treatments.|$|E

500|$|The Garden is {{composed}} of two [...] "plates" [...] protected on two sides by large hedges. [...] The dark plate depicts Chicago's history by presenting shade-loving plant material. The dark plate has a combination of trees that will provide a shade canopy for these plants when <b>they</b> <b>fill</b> in.

500|$|Females of {{the water}} spider Argyroneta aquatica build {{underwater}} [...] "diving bell" [...] webs that <b>they</b> <b>fill</b> with air and use for digesting prey, molting, mating and raising offspring. They live almost entirely within the bells, darting out to catch prey animals that touch the bell or the threads that anchor it. A few spiders use the surfaces of lakes and ponds as [...] "webs", detecting trapped insects by the vibrations that these cause while struggling.|$|E
500|$|Sand {{dunes and}} ridges are the fourth zone, formed when beach sand transported by wind and waves becomes [...] trapped by vegetation. Dunes grow and are {{stabilized}} by grasses, followed by {{other types of}} vegetation. This [...] provides habitat for amphibians, birds, mammals, and reptiles. Old dunes can become more permanent ridges, which shelter ponds. These dunes, ridges, and ponds are often remnants of previous shorelines; at the Presque Isle State Park [...] "Long Pond" [...] {{just east of the}} marina, dunes and ridges mark the eastern shoreline from 1862. The fifth ecological zone consists of old ponds and marshes. Ponds protected by dunes and ridges are more stable; these old ponds support more plant and animal life, and as <b>they</b> <b>fill</b> with vegetation, they become marshes. Old ponds and marshes have high biodiversity. Nearly 400 species of terrestrial vertebrates live on Presque Isle, including 318 different birds, 48kinds of mammals, 13types of amphibians, and 19reptile species.|$|E
