5|$|On 19 September, the Zagreb Corps {{tried to}} {{reinforce}} the HV bridgeheads across the Una River, only to suffer further casualties. The Bjelovar Corps also committed the 121st Home Guard Regiment battlegroup to Jasenovac as a reinforcement to breach VRS defences. During the day, the Bjelovar Corps was approached by Irfan <b>Torić,</b> the commanding officer of the 520th ARBiH Brigade based in Velika Kladuša, requesting permission to deploy his troops to support the Bjelovar Corps attack. Džanko referred the request to Červenko. By {{the end of the}} day, Červenko had met with Tuđman to protest against the disorganised manner in which the operation had been launched, {{and the fact that he}} was not informed of it in advance. On the same day, the HV General Staff called the operation off.|$|E
25|$|A spherical contact lens bends light evenly {{in every}} {{direction}} (horizontally, vertically, etc.). They are typically used to correct myopia and hypermetropia. A <b>toric</b> contact lens has a different focusing power horizontally than vertically, {{and as a result}} can correct for astigmatism. Some spherical rigid lenses can also correct for astigmatism. Because a <b>toric</b> lens must have the proper orientation to correct for a person's astigmatism, such a lens must have additional design characteristics to prevent it from rotating away from the ideal alignment. This can be done by weighting the bottom of the lens or by using other physical characteristics to rotate the lens back into position. Some <b>toric</b> contact lenses have marks or etchings that can assist the eye doctor or the user in fitting the lens. The first disposable <b>toric</b> contact lenses were introduced in 2000 by Vistakon.|$|E
25|$|Another {{generalization}} of projective spaces are weighted projective spaces; these are themselves special cases of <b>toric</b> varieties.|$|E
25|$|<b>Toric</b> or sphero-cylindrical lenses have {{surfaces}} {{with two}} different radii of curvature in two orthogonal planes. They {{have a different}} focal power in different meridians. This forms an astigmatic lens. An example is eyeglass lenses {{that are used to}} correct astigmatism in someone's eye.|$|E
25|$|An O-ring, {{also known}} as a <b>toric</b> joint, is a {{mechanical}} gasket {{in the shape of a}} torus containing a loop of elastomer with a disc-shaped cross-section. It is designed to be seated in a groove and compressed during assembly between two or more parts, creating a seal at the interface. The O-ring was invented in 1937 by Danish-American machinist Niels Christensen.|$|E
25|$|Rational {{singularities}} over a {{field of}} characteristic zero are Cohen–Macaulay. <b>Toric</b> varieties over any field are Cohen–Macaulay. The minimal model program makes prominent use of varieties with klt (Kawamata log terminal) singularities; in characteristic zero, these are rational singularities and hence are Cohen–Macaulay, One successful analog of rational singularities in positive characteristic {{is the notion of}} F-rational singularities; again, such singularities are Cohen–Macaulay.|$|E
25|$|Stanley {{introduced}} a generalization of the h-vector, the <b>toric</b> h-vector, which is defined for an arbitrary ranked poset, and proved {{that for the}} class of Eulerian posets, the Dehn–Sommerville equations continue to hold. A different, more combinatorial, generalization of the h-vector that has been extensively studied is the flag h-vector of a ranked poset. For Eulerian posets, it can be more concisely expressed {{by means of a}} noncommutative polynomial in two variables called the cd-index.|$|E
25|$|A rigid lens is able {{to replace}} the natural shape of the contact (cornea) with a new refracting surface. This means that a spherical rigid contact lens can correct astigmatism. Rigids can also be made as a front-toric, back-toric, or bitoric. This is {{different}} from a spherical contact lens in that one or both surfaces of the lens deliver a <b>toric</b> correction. Rigids can also correct for corneal irregularities, such as keratoconus. In most cases, patients with keratoconus see better through rigids than through glasses. Rigids are more chemically inert, allowing them to be worn in more challenging environments than soft lenses.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the arrest}} of Tara and Clay, Jax struggles to hold SAMCRO {{together}} while Tara is imprisoned. <b>Toric</b> approaches both Tara and Clay and offers them deals in exchange for giving up SAMCRO; both initially refuse, but Clay later relents when confronted with being thrown into the prison's general population and assuredly being killed by inmates paid off by Damon Pope's men as a retaliation for Pope's murder. Juice returns to Charming after helping Bobby relocate after stepping down as VP, which angers Chibs, who doesn't believe Juice has been punished enough for talking to cops and later beats him. With the growing romance between Gemma and Nero, the death of Clay Morrow, and death of Tara, the tables get turned and club starts {{to go in a}} new darker direction.|$|E
25|$|Algebraic {{geometry}} and cryptography likewise uses group theory in many ways. Abelian varieties {{have been introduced}} above. The presence of the group operation yields additional information which makes these varieties particularly accessible. They also often serve as a test for new conjectures. The one-dimensional case, namely elliptic curves is studied in particular detail. They are both theoretically and practically intriguing. Very large groups of prime order constructed in elliptic curve cryptography serve for public-key cryptography. Cryptographical methods of this kind benefit from {{the flexibility of the}} geometric objects, hence their group structures, together with the complicated structure of these groups, which make the discrete logarithm very hard to calculate. One of the earliest encryption protocols, Caesar's cipher, may also be interpreted as a (very easy) group operation. In another direction, <b>toric</b> varieties are algebraic varieties acted on by a torus. Toroidal embeddings have recently led to advances in algebraic geometry, in particular resolution of singularities.|$|E

50|$|In {{algebraic}} geometry, a <b>toric</b> stack is a stacky {{generalization of}} a <b>toric</b> variety. More precisely, a <b>toric</b> stack is obtained by replacing {{in the construction}} of a <b>toric</b> variety a step of taking GIT quotients with that of taking quotient stacks. Consequently, a <b>toric</b> variety is a coarse approximation of a <b>toric</b> stack. A <b>toric</b> orbifold {{is an example of a}} <b>toric</b> stack.|$|E
50|$|A <b>toric</b> {{ideal is}} an ideal {{generated}} by differences of monomials (provided the ideal is a prime ideal).

50|$|A <b>toric</b> {{variety is}} nonsingular if its cones of maximal {{dimension}} are {{generated by a}} basis of the lattice.This implies that every <b>toric</b> variety has a resolution of singularities given by another <b>toric</b> variety, which can be constructed by subdividing the maximal cones into cones of nonsingular <b>toric</b> varieties.|$|E
50|$|A <b>toric</b> IOL {{is a type}} of <b>toric</b> lens used {{to correct}} preexisting corneal {{astigmatism}} at the time of cataract surgery. This astigmatism can also be treated with limbal relaxing incisions or an excimer laser procedure. About 40% of Americans have significant astigmatism and thus may be candidates for a <b>toric</b> IOL. Cataract surgery with implantation of a <b>toric</b> IOL is essentially the same as cataract surgery with a conventional IOL. Like <b>toric</b> contact lenses, <b>toric</b> IOLs have different powers in different meridians of the lens, and they must be positioned on the correct meridian to reverse the preexisting astigmatism. If the <b>toric</b> IOL is not on the correct meridian, it may need to be repositioned in a second procedure.|$|E

50|$|As with IOLs {{inserted}} after cataract extraction, phakic IOLs (PIOLs) can {{be either}} spheric or <b>toric.</b> The difference {{is that they are}} placed in an eye that retains the natural human crystalline lens. As with aphakic eyes, <b>toric</b> PIOLs have to be aligned with the meridian of astigmatism; <b>toric</b> IOL misalignment or rotation can lead to residual or even greater astigmatism postoperatively.|$|E
50|$|Patients with {{astigmatism}} need a <b>toric</b> lens to see clearly. The {{geometry of}} a <b>toric</b> lens focuses light differently in different meridians. For example, a <b>toric</b> lens, when rotated correctly, could focus a horizontal line {{to a series}} of points at one focal distance while focusing a vertical line to a separate focal plane. This photo helps to illustrate this concept.|$|E
50|$|Singularities of <b>toric</b> {{varieties}} give {{examples of}} high-dimensional singularities {{that are easy}} to resolve explicitly. A <b>toric</b> variety is defined by a fan, a collection of cones in a lattice. The singularities can be resolved by subdividing each cone into a union of cones each of which is generated by a basis for the lattice, and taking the corresponding <b>toric</b> variety.|$|E
5000|$|In {{algebraic}} geometry, a <b>toric</b> variety or torus embedding is an algebraic variety containing an algebraic torus as an open dense subset, {{such that}} {{the action of the}} torus on itself extends to the whole variety. Some authors also require it to be normal. <b>Toric</b> varieties form an important and rich class of examples in algebraic geometry, which often provide a testing ground for theorems. The geometry of a <b>toric</b> variety is fully determined by the combinatorics of its associated fan, which often makes computations far more tractable. For a certain special, but still quite general class of <b>toric</b> varieties, this information is also encoded in a polytope, which creates a powerful connection of the subject with convex geometry. Familiar examples of <b>toric</b> varieties are affine space, projective spaces, products of projective spaces and bundles over projective space.|$|E

It is defined on a {{two dimensional}} lattice with <b>toric</b> boundary conditions with a spin-1/2 on each link. It can be shown that the ground state of the standard <b>toric</b> code Hamiltonian is an equal weight superposition of closed string states. Such a ground state {{is an example of a}} string-net condensate which has the same topological orderas the Z2 spin liquid above.|$|E
50|$|The {{intraocular lenses}} used in {{correcting}} astigmatism are called <b>toric</b> {{and have been}} FDA approved since 1998. The STAAR Surgical Intraocular Lens was the first such lens ever developed in the United States and it may correct up to 3.5 diopters. A different model of <b>toric</b> lenses is created by Alcon and may correct up to 3 diopters of astigmatism. In order to achieve the most benefit from a <b>toric</b> lens, the surgeon must rotate the lens to be on axis with the patient’s astigmatism. Intraoperative wavefront analysis, such as that provided by the ORA System developed by Wavetec Visions Systems, {{can be used to}} assist the doctor in <b>toric</b> lens placement and minimize astigmatic errors.|$|E
50|$|In mathematics, a <b>toric</b> {{manifold}} is a topological analogue of <b>toric</b> {{variety in}} algebraic geometry.
