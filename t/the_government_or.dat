5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, the US Navy was growing rapidly. The Navy {{commissioned}} its first battleships in 1895, {{and by the}} middle of the next decade, Jane's Fighting Ships ranked its battle line second only to the British Navy. However, this rapid growth was not universally supported either within <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>or</b> within the Navy. Compromises between powerful groups were frequently necessary to get funding.|$|E

5|$|A {{few days}} after the execution, the ten {{condemned}} prisoners who had had their sentences commuted to twelve months' imprisonment were transported to the prison hulk Justitia, moored at Woolwich on the River Thames. Such ships were used as holding areas prior to convicts being transferred to a regular vessel for penal transportation to, at this time, Australia. Residents of Ely tried to hold meetings to complain at this apparent extension of the prisoners' sentences. Despite, or because of, media attention—newspapers of the time took sides depending whether they supported <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>or</b> not—the prisoners were returned to Ely gaol; it may all have been a simple mistake by the clerk of the assizes.|$|E
5|$|Belarus {{was once}} a major center of European Jews, with 10% of the {{population}} being Jewish. But since the mid-20th century, the number of Jews has been reduced by the Holocaust, deportation, and emigration, so that today {{it is a very}} small minority of less than one percent. The Lipka Tatars, numbering over 15,000, are predominantly Muslims. According to Article 16 of the Constitution, Belarus has no official religion. While the freedom of worship is granted in the same article, religious organizations deemed harmful to <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>or</b> social order can be prohibited.|$|E

5|$|Benedict Arnold then {{applied to}} {{accompany}} General Carleton, {{who was going}} to New York to replace Clinton as commander-in-chief; this request went nowhere. Other attempts all failed to gain positions within <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>or</b> the British East India Company {{over the next few years}} and he was forced to subsist on the reduced pay of non-wartime service. His reputation also came under criticism in the British press, especially when compared to that of Major André, who was celebrated for his patriotism.|$|E
5|$|Carroll {{travelled}} to England {{to press}} his case, although Hart later {{claimed that he}} had been promised no such lobbying would take place. Carroll convinced the proprietor's officials to appoint him as the proprietor's chief agent in the colony. He was further appointed to the positions of receiver general, escheator, and naval officer. These positions together effectively gave Carroll the power to oversee all money in the colony that was collected by <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>or</b> by Calvert's private organization.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, the Lascaris War Rooms {{were built}} in Valletta {{to serve as the}} war {{headquarters}} for the defence of Malta. They were later used in the headquarters of the Allied invasion of Sicily. Throughout the war, many air-raid shelters also were dug in the limestone rock of the islands, either by <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>or</b> by individuals or families, to protect the civilian population of Malta from Italian or German aerial bombardment. Many of the shelters still exist, and a few are open to the public.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} decades of the Turkish Republic, <b>the</b> <b>government</b> (<b>or</b> banks {{established}} and owned by the government, such as Türkiye İş Bankası (1924), Sanayi ve Maadin Bankası (1925), Emlak ve Eytam Bankası (1926), Central Bank of Turkey (1930), Sümerbank (1933), İller Bankası (1933), Etibank (1935), Denizbank (1937), Halk Bankası (1938), etc.) had to subsidise most of the industrial projects, due to the lack of a strong private sector. However, in the period between the 1920s and 1950s, a new generation of Turkish entrepreneurs such as Nuri Demirağ, Vehbi Koç, Hacı Ömer Sabancı and Nejat Eczacıbaşı began to establish privately owned factories, some of which evolved into the largest industrial conglomerates that dominate the Turkish economy today, such as Koç Holding, Sabancı Holding and Eczacıbaşı Holding.|$|E

PHC adds new facilities and programs only as funds are available. The Home School Legal Defense Association is one of the primary benefactors of the school, and all members of the association receive a $1300 grant if they are accepted as students.|$|E
5|$|The 65 {{members of}} the upper Senate are {{directly}} appointed by the king, the constitution mandates that they be veteran politicians, judges and generals who previously served in <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>or</b> in the House of Representatives. The 130 {{members of the}} lower House of Representatives are elected through party-list proportional representation in 23 constituencies for a 4-year term. Minimum quotas exist in the House of Representatives for women (15 seats, though they won 20 seats in the 2016 election), Christians (9 seats) and Circassians and Chechens (3 seats).|$|E

5|$|The Government Proceedings Act bars the High Court from {{granting}} injunctions against <b>the</b> <b>Government</b> <b>or</b> {{one of its}} officers. An injunction is {{an equitable}} private law remedy that restrains a public authority from doing an act that is wrongful or ultra vires. In place of an injunction, the Court may make a declaration concerning the parties' rights. At common law, there is no general right to claim damages – that is, monetary compensation – if rules of public law have been breached by an authority. In order to obtain damages, an aggrieved person {{must be able to}} establish a private law claim in contract or tort law.|$|E
5|$|Heins {{examines}} {{the question of}} whether children and adolescents are negatively impacted by exposure to violence and pornography, contending that youth are not endangered by sexually explicit material. She believes that censorship of such material from adolescents is {{based on the idea that}} minors are innocent and exposure to inappropriate media would corrupt them, explaining how this belief has been used as a basis for censorship. Heins explores whether <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>or</b> parents should restrict children's access to potentially inappropriate material, believing that the decision should rest primarily with parents. She writes that there is no simple tactic by which government can censor material from children without violating First-Amendment rights guaranteed to adults. Heins warns that attempting to categorize forms of creative expression in order to prohibit particular works of art results in censorship choices which reflect an ideological point-of-view.|$|E
5|$|Madison, {{a member}} of the Democratic-Republican Party, was elected to the Democratic-Republican-dominated Virginia General Assembly from Orange County in 1799. A major item on his agenda was the defense of the General Assembly's 1798 Virginia Resolutions, of which Madison had been the draftsman. The Resolutions, usually {{discussed}} together with Thomas Jefferson's contemporaneous Kentucky Resolutions, were a response to various perceived outrages perpetrated by the Federalist-dominated national government. The most significant of these were the Alien and Sedition Acts, four laws that allowed the President to deport aliens at will, required a longer period of residence before aliens could become citizens, and made it a crime to publish malicious or defamatory material against <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>or</b> its officials. Democratic-Republicans were outraged by the legislation, and Madison and Jefferson drafted the highly critical Resolutions adopted in response by the Virginia and Kentucky state legislatures.|$|E

5|$|Moreno {{promoted}} stronger {{measures against}} the royalists. In July, he gave {{orders to the}} neighboring mayors to prevent the creation of secret groups, or activities that could promote alienation. He promoted a new decree of the Junta that called for trial and confiscation of goods for anyone that left the city without authorization, kept military weapons in secret, promoted popular alienation or discontent against <b>the</b> <b>government,</b> <b>or</b> wrote letters to people in other cities for such a purpose. Serious cases were usually punished with execution or exile. Some rich people exiled by this decree were Francisco Beláustegui, Olaguer Reynals, Norberto de Quirno y Echeandía, and Pablo Villariño. Manuel Andrés Arroyo y Pinedo, another rich man, blamed Moreno for these actions, accusing him of equaling disagreement with antipatriotism, and felt that the ideas of egalitarianism would only cause great evils. Those measures were also criticized by moderate supporters of the revolution, such as Gregorio Funes from Córdoba, who rejected the lack of proper trials, or Dámaso Uriburu, from Salta, who compared Moreno, Castelli, and Vieytes with the French Jacobins.|$|E
5|$|Moyer, who {{had never}} argued before the Supreme Court, {{continued}} to represent Jacobson (who was in the audience). In his brief and at oral argument, he said that a mere stated interest in sex among young men did not rise {{to a level of}} proving predisposition, that the government should have had evidence in hand that Jacobson was actually willing to break the law to do so. (Kenneth Starr, then Solicitor General, had maintained in the government's brief opposing certiorari that his prior purchase of the Bare Boys magazines was all the proof it needed, even if the action were legal at the time.) Pressed on other undercover investigative techniques, he admitted that a government-run pawn shop would be a permissible way to apprehend thieves despite a lack of evidence of predisposition because the crimes might well have occurred prior to any contact with <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>or</b> its operatives.|$|E
5|$|Since 1990, the Tower of London {{has been}} {{cared for by}} an {{independent}} charity, Historic Royal Palaces, which receives no funding from <b>the</b> <b>Government</b> <b>or</b> the Crown. In 1988, the Tower of London {{was added to the}} UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites, in recognition of its global importance and to help conserve and protect the site. However, recent developments, such as the construction of skyscrapers nearby, have pushed the Tower towards being added to the United Nations' Heritage in Danger List. The remains of the medieval palace have been open to the public since 2006. Visitors can explore the chambers restored to their former glory, once used by past kings and queens. Although the position of Constable of the Tower remains the highest position held at the Tower, the responsibility of day-to-day administration is delegated to the Resident Governor. At least six ravens are kept at the Tower at all times, in accordance with the belief that if they are absent, the kingdom will fall. They are under the care of the Yeomen Warders. The earliest known reference to a Tower raven is a picture from 1883. As well as having ceremonial duties, the Yeoman Warders provide guided tours around the Tower. Just over 2.7 million people visited the Tower of London in 2016.|$|E
