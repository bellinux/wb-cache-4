5000|$|Formative {{assessments}} are check points during the learning process. Unlike summative assessments, that check for understanding {{at the end}} of learn, formative assessments come in during learning. and “Formative assessments support learning during the learning process. They serve as practice for students, just like a meaningful homework assignment. They check for understanding along the way and guide teacher decision making about future instruction.” [...] Formative assessments give <b>teachers</b> <b>a</b> chance to <b>break</b> down complex ideas into smaller understandable pieces. This allows teachers to correct “mistakes” and fine tune skills before summative assessments.|$|R

5000|$|Differentiating by process {{refers to}} how a student comes to {{understand}} and assimilate facts, concepts and skills (Anderson, 2007). After teaching <b>a</b> lesson, <b>a</b> <b>teacher</b> might <b>break</b> students into small [...] "ability" [...] groups based on their readiness. The teacher would then give each group a series of questions, based on each group's appropriate level of readiness-skills, related to {{the objectives of the}} lesson. Another way to group the students could be based on the students' learning styles. The main idea behind this is that students are at different levels and learn in different ways, so <b>a</b> <b>teacher</b> can't teach them all the same way.|$|R

60|$|It will be {{observed}} too, {{that all the}} time this teacher was performing these experiments, and watching, with intense interest, the results, his pupils were going on undisturbed in their pursuits. The exercises in writing were not interrupted or deranged. This is a point of fundamental importance; for, if what I should say on the subject of exercising ingenuity and contrivance in teaching, should be the means, in any case, of leading <b>a</b> <b>teacher</b> to <b>break</b> in upon the regular duties of his school, and destroy the steady uniformity with which the great objects of such an institution should be pursued, my remarks had better never have been written. There may be variety in methods and plan; but through all this variety, the school, and every individual pupil of it, must go steadily forward in the acquisition of that knowledge which is of greatest importance in the business of future life. In other words, the variations and changes, admitted by the teacher, ought to be mainly confined to the modes of accomplishing those permanent objects to which all the exercises and arrangements of the school ought steadily to aim.

40|$|AbstractWe {{show how}} to learn from {{examples}} (Valiant style) any concept representable as a boolean function or circuit, {{with the help of}} <b>a</b> <b>teacher</b> who <b>breaks</b> the concept into subconcepts and teaches one subconcept per lesson. Each subconcept corresponds to a gate in the boolean circuit. The learner learns each subconcept from examples which have been randomly drawn according to an arbitrary probability distribution, and labeled as positive or negative instances of the subconcept by the teacher. The learning procedure runs in time polynomial {{in the size of the}} circuit. The learner outputs not the unknown boolean circuit, but rather a program that, for any input, either produces the same answer as the unknown boolean circuit, or else says "I don′t know. " Thus the output of this learning procedure is reliable. Furthermore, with high probability the output program is nearly always useful in that it says "I don′t know" very rarely. A key technique is to maintain a hierarchy of explicit "version spaces. " Our main contribution is thus a learning procedure whose output is reliable and nearly always useful; this has not been previously accomplished within Valiant′s model of learnability...|$|R
40|$|Restricted until 14 Jul. 2010. There {{once was}} a young slave {{by the name of}} Frederick Douglass who was {{tenacious}} in his pursuit to learn to read. After convincing the wife of his master to serve in the role as <b>teacher,</b> <b>a</b> sudden <b>break</b> occurred in his educational process as his master forbade the wife to teach a slave to read. The master believed that if a slave learned to read he would become discontent with his conditions and rebel against slavery. The master was successful in ceasing Douglass’ instruction but not his desire to learn!; Douglass’ dilemma is one of many that students in urban communities grapple with on a daily basis. Many students in urban communities are faced with unique challenges from high rates of poverty to attendance at schools with limited resources that are instructional distractions. In addition to these daily struggles, school districts nationwide are faced with the task of employing skilled urban leaders who are prepared to mitigate these adaptive challenges.; Therefore, this mixed methods, purposive case study was conducted to investigate whether a fully developed leadership intervention program complemented by leadership mentoring support and assessment of leadership practice, was effective in influencing change in leader and teacher practice over time. The study drew from an examination of leadership theories and models that served as the basis for identifying components of effective leadership development programs (Darling-Hammond et. al, Murphy et al., 2003) that build the capacity of urban leaders to create and sustain the conditions for quality teaching and learning to occur.; Consistent with contemporary research on leadership, the findings in this study suggested that effective leaders are those who possess beliefs, knowledge, skills and practices critical to shaping a culture of learning (Elmore, 2003; Marzano, 2003, Murphy et al., 2006; Hallinger, 2003). Therefore, specific leadership program features and support structures that influence leader and teacher practice in urban school settings are identified. Additionally, implications and recommendations are presented to support the field in identifying conceptual tools needed to develop a form of social capital in urban schools that lead to improved outcomes for professionals and students...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{studied a}} group of three preservice elementary <b>teachers</b> creating <b>a</b> narrated stop-motion animation (Slowmation) from start to finish in 3 [*]hours to explain the challenging concept of 2 ̆ 2 phases of the moon 2 ̆ 2 to elementary school children. The research questions investigated the preservice teachers 2 ̆ 7 learning before and after the construction as well as how the preservice teachers designed the slowmation as a teaching resource. Data collection involved individual interviews immediately before and after the construction in conjunction with analysis of video and audio data collected during the construction process. Before the animation construction, the participants had little understanding of the causes of moon phases and one held an alternative conception. After creating the slowmation all three preservice teachers demonstrated more 2 ̆ 2 elements 2 ̆ 2 of the concept and appeared to resolve an alternative conception. There are two findings from this research: (i) creating a slowmation enabled the preservice teachers to develop more elements to contribute to their understanding of moon phases; (ii) the design of the slowmation was based on breaking the concept into a sequence of sub-concepts that were represented digitally. Designing a digital teaching resource such as a slowmation to explain a concept involves preservice <b>teachers</b> <b>breaking</b> <b>a</b> concept down into coherent parts or 2 ̆ 2 chunks 2 ̆ 2 and representing the concept in multiple ways. This can be done within a science method class and is also a good way for the them to negotiate meanings about a difficult concept...|$|R
