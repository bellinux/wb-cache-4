5|$|Folklore often {{identifies}} a green {{sky with}} tornadoes, {{and though the}} phenomenon {{may be associated with}} severe weather, there is no evidence linking it specifically with tornadoes. It is often thought <b>that</b> <b>opening</b> windows will lessen the damage caused by the tornado. While there is a large drop in atmospheric pressure inside a strong tornado, {{it is unlikely that the}} pressure drop would be enough to cause the house to explode. Opening windows may actually increase the severity of the tornado's damage. A violent tornado can destroy a house whether its windows are open or closed.|$|E
5|$|Kershaw {{made his}} third {{straight}} opening day {{start for the}} Dodgers in the 2013 season, the first Dodger starter to do so since Derek Lowe (2005–2007). In <b>that</b> <b>opening</b> day start he pitched a complete game, four hit, shutout over the Giants and also hit his first career home run. He was the first pitcher to throw a shutout and {{hit a home run}} on opening day since Bob Lemon of the Cleveland Indians did so against the Chicago White Sox on April 14, 1953. Kershaw picked up his 1,000th career strikeout on April 17, 2013, when he struck out Yonder Alonso of the Padres. He was the second youngest Dodger to reach that mark, behind only Fernando Valenzuela. On May 14, Kershaw passed the 1,000 inning mark for his career. His ERA of 2.70 at the time was the fifth best of the live-ball era at the 1,000 inning mark and the best career mark. He also threw 130 pitches that day, the most of his career and the most by a Dodger pitcher since Odalis Pérez in the 2003 season.|$|E

25|$|On March 20, 1911, Jolson {{starred in}} his first musical revue at the Winter Garden Theater in New York City, La Belle Paree, greatly helping to launch {{his career as a}} singer. The opening night drew a huge crowd to the theater, and that evening Jolson gained {{audience}} popularity by singing old Stephen Foster songs in blackface. In the wake of <b>that</b> <b>opening</b> night, Jolson was given a position in the show's cast. The show closed after 104 performances, and during its run Jolson's popularity grew greatly. Following La Belle Paree, Jolson accepted an offer to perform in the musical Vera Violetta. The show opened on November20, 1911 and, like La Belle Paree, was a phenomenal success. In the show, Jolson again sang in blackface and managed to become so popular that his weekly salary of $500 (based on his success in La Belle Paree) was increased to $750.|$|E
25|$|However, {{it seems}} that a {{southern}} portion will now be built as the Scottish Executive has determined that the M74 motorway will be extended through the Southeast of Glasgow {{to connect with the}} Kingston Bridge (although not along the original route identified in the Bruce Report). This is a controversial plan as it involves plowing the motorway through the city, something that many residents do not want, and a public enquiry recommended that construction not proceed. However the Executive contends that the economic benefits as well as congestion on the current motorway dictate that it will go ahead. Despite this, the opposers to the scheme mounted a legal challenge in June 2005, which will probably mean <b>that</b> <b>opening</b> of the extension will be delayed until 2009 at the earliest. The City Council have indicated that should this extension be complete they will reconsider building the eastern flank of the ring road which will necessitate either a second motorway bridge over the river, or a tunnel.|$|E

25|$|Morphy {{favored the}} usual chess {{openings}} of the day, particularly the King's Gambit and Giuoco Piano (when playing as White) and the Dutch Defense (when playing as Black).

Bb5 a6) {{is named after}} him and remains the most popular variant of <b>that</b> <b>opening,</b> although he seldom used the Ruy Lopez when playing the White pieces. Morphy could play positional chess when required to do so, however he was not enamored of it and his closed games, while competently played, exhibit none of the imagination of his open games. He was openly critical of the Sicilian Defense and 1. d4 openings for leading to dull games, and the only known instance where he used a Sicilian Defense was a game against Loewenthal in 1858.During his tour of Europe, he included a stipulation that all matches must feature 1. e4 e5 openings in {{at least half the}} games.|$|E
