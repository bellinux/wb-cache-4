500|$|Icke {{has emerged}} as a {{professional}} conspiracy theorist within a global counter-cultural movement that combines New World Order conspiracism, the truther movement and anti-globalization, with an extraterrestrial conspiracist subculture (Roswell, alien abduction, crop circles, men in black, The X-Files). Thanks to Icke's prominence, public figures are regularly asked whether they are lizards. An Official Information Act request was filed in New Zealand in 2008 <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>this</b> of John Key, the prime minister, and Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg was asked the same during a Q in 2016. (Both men said they were not lizards. Key added that he had taken the unusual step of consulting not only a doctor but a vet.) In a 2013 survey in the United States by Public Policy Polling, 4% believed that [...] "'lizard people' control our societies." ...|$|E
500|$|Robert Sandall {{gave the}} book a {{positive}} review in The Sunday Times, and wrote: [...] "What makes this book worthwhile is its fiercely illuminating angle. ... Morrison, as usual, declined {{to take part}} but the author's scholarly methods lend this weighty volume a real authority." [...] The Journal Gazette called the book: [...] "A definitive, provocative and revelatory portrait of an endlessly complicated man and his music." [...] A review in The Irish Times characterised the book as a [...] "magical" [...] journey into Van Morrison's life, noting: [...] "Johnny Rogan spent 23 years researching his biography of Van Morrison. It shows. In a book that really should have been titled Everything You Always Wanted To Know About Van Morrison But Were Too Petrified <b>To</b> <b>Ask,</b> <b>this</b> is a magical 'into the mystic' journey which vertiginously takes you from Edward Carson to Leadbelly, from the Mafia to the Rosacrucians, from drinking stories to Gestalt therapy, and from Bernadette Devlin to Terry Keane." [...] Brian Boyd of The Irish Times described Rogan's work as a [...] "superb book".|$|E
2500|$|The {{traditional}} Haggadah {{speaks of}} [...] "four sons"—{{one who is}} wise, one who is wicked, one who is simple, and one who does not know <b>to</b> <b>ask.</b> <b>This</b> {{is based upon the}} rabbis of the Jerusalem Talmud finding four references in the Torah to responding to your son who asks a question. Each of these sons phrases his question about the seder in a different way. The Haggadah recommends answering each son according to his question, using one of the three verses in the Torah that refer to this exchange.|$|E

2500|$|Though Zeus {{begged her}} not <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>this,</b> she persisted and he agreed. Therefore, {{he came to}} her wreathed in bolts of lightning; mortals, however, could not look upon an undisguised god without dying, and she perished in the ensuing blaze. Zeus rescued the unborn Dionysus by sewing him into his thigh. A few months later, Dionysus was born on Mount Pramnos in the island of Ikaria, where Zeus went to release the now-fully-grown baby from his thigh. In this version, Dionysus is born by two [...] "mothers" [...] (Semele and Zeus) before his birth, hence the epithet dimētōr (of two mothers) {{associated}} with his being [...] "twice-born".|$|E
2500|$|The {{intended}} {{audience is}} not evident. Some believe that Prufrock {{is talking to}} another person or directly to the reader, while others believe Prufrock's monologue is internal. Perrine writes [...] "The 'you and I' of the first line are divided parts of Prufrock's own nature", while Mutlu Konuk Blasing suggests that the [...] "you and I" [...] refers {{to the relationship between}} the dilemmas of the character and the author. Similarly, critics dispute whether Prufrock is going somewhere {{during the course of the}} poem. In the first half of the poem, Prufrock uses various outdoor images (the sky, streets, cheap restaurants and hotels, fog), and talks about how there will be time for various things before [...] "the taking of a toast and tea", and [...] "time to turn back and descend the stair." [...] This has led many to believe that Prufrock is on his way to an afternoon tea, where he is preparing <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>this</b> [...] "overwhelming question". Others, however, believe that Prufrock is not physically going anywhere, but rather, is playing through it in his mind.|$|E
