40|$|Alternative {{methods of}} {{firefighting}} and new firefighting technologies {{could reduce the}} reliance on potable water supplied via the water distribution system (WDS) for firefighting. Water required for firefighting in 5 towns in proximity to Stellenbosch, South Africa, was evaluated. The key objective of this research project {{was to investigate the}} extent to which the WDS was used for fighting fires. The fire flow requirements, specified in South African guidelines, as well as some international stand-ards, were also reviewed. Information from fire departments in 3 municipal areas was analysed to determine the fire type category, the method for extinguishing the fire, and the water requirement to extinguish the fire. Only 8. 6 % of all fires were extinguished using water from the WDS by connecting firefighting equipment to a fire hydrant at the time of the fire. Most fires were extinguished by means of water ejected from a pre-filled <b>tanker</b> <b>vehicle</b> disconnected from the WDS at the time of fighting the fire. In most cases water was drawn from the WDS at a predetermined location and time, and then transported by <b>tanker</b> <b>vehicle</b> to the demand point upon receiving an emergency call.

The dispute has shifted from the traditional demand for wage increase to demand for friendly government policies towards its members.

40|$|The Argus {{reusable}} {{launch vehicle}} (RLV) concept is a single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) conical, wingedbodied vehicle powered by two liquid hydrogen (LH 2) /liquid oxygen (LOX) supercharged ejector ramjets (SERJ). The 3 rd generation Argus launch vehicle utilizes advanced vehicle technologies along with a magnetic levitation (Maglev) launch assist track. A tanker version of the Argus RLV is envisioned to provide an economical means of providing liquid fuel and oxidizer to an orbiting low Earth orbit (LEO) propellant depot. This depot could then provide propellant to various spacecraft, including reusable orbital transfer vehicles used to ferry space solar power (SSP) satellites to geo-stationary orbit. Two different tanker Argus configurations were analyzed. The first simply places additional propellant tanks inside the payload bay of an existing Argus {{reusable launch vehicle}}. The second concept is a modified pure tanker version of the Argus RLV in which the payload bay is removed and the vehicle propellant tanks are extended to hold additional propellant. An economic analysis was performed for this study that involved the calculation of the design/development and recurring costs of each vehicle. The goal of this analysis was to determine at what flight rate it would be economically beneficial to spend additional development funds to change an existing, sunk cost, payload bay <b>tanker</b> <b>vehicle</b> into a pure tanker design.

40|$|On-orbit {{refueling}} of spacecraft {{has been}} proposed {{as an alternative to}} the exclusive use of Heavy-lift Launch Vehicles to enable human exploration beyond Low Earth Orbit (LEO). In these scenarios, beyond LEO spacecraft are launched dry (without propellant) or partially dry into orbit, using smaller or fewer element launch vehicles. Propellant is then launched into LEO on separate launch vehicles and transferred to the spacecraft. Refueling concepts are potentially attractive because they reduce the maximum individual payload that must be placed in Earth orbit. However, these types of approaches add significant complexity to mission operations and introduce more uncertainty and opportunities for failure to the mission. In order to evaluate these complex scenarios, the authors developed a Monte Carlo based discrete-event model that simulates the operational risks involved with such strategies, including launch processing delays, transportation system failures, and onorbit element lifetimes. This paper describes the methodology used to simulate the mission risks for refueling concepts, the strategies that were evaluated, and the results of the investigation. The results of the investigation show that scenarios that employ refueling concepts will likely have to include long launch and assembly timelines, as well as the use of spare <b>tanker</b> launch <b>vehicles,</b> in order to achieve high levels of mission success through Trans Lunar Injection...|$|R
40|$|It is {{accepted}} that defective structural designs are mostly caused by insufficient knowledge of input data, such as material properties or loading, rather than inadequate analysis or testing methods. In particular, loads associated with automotive and transport (trucks, trailers, containers, trains) structures are nontrivial to quantify. Such loads arise from stochastic and ill-defined {{processes such as}} driver/operator actions and structure-terrain interaction. The fundamental processes involved with the determination of input loading are measurements, surveys, simulation, estimation and calculation from field failures. These processes result in design criteria, code requirements and/or testing requirements. The present study deals with methods {{for the establishment of}} input loading for automotive and transport structures. It is attempted to generalise and unify new and existing techniques into a cohesive methodology. This is achieved by combining researched current theory and best practices, with lessons learned during application on, as well as new techniques developed for, a number of complex case studies, involving road <b>tanker</b> <b>vehicles,</b> light commercial vehicles, industrial vehicles, as well as tank containers. Apart from the above, the present study offers four individual, unique contributions. Firstly, two methods, widely applied by industry, namely the Remote Parameter Analysis (RPA) method, which entails deriving time domain dynamic loads by multiplying measured signals from remotely placed transducers with a unit-load static finite element based transfer matrix, as well as the Modal Superposition method, are combined to establish a methodology which accounts for modal response without the need for expensive dynamic response analysis. Secondly, a concept named Fatigue Equivalent Static Load (FESL) is developed, where fatigue load requirements are derived from measurements as quasi-static g-loads, the responses to which are considered as stress ranges applied a said number of times during the lifetime of the structure. In particular, it is demonstrated that the method may be employed for multi-axial g-loading, as well as for cases where constraint conditions change during the mission of the vehicle. The method provides some benefits compared to similar methods employed in the industry. Thirdly, a complex analytical model named Two Parameter Approach (TPA) is developed, defining the usage profile of a vehicle in terms of a bivariate probability density distribution of two parameters (distance/day, fatigue damage/distance), derived from measurements and surveys. Based on an inversion of the TPA model, a robust technique is developed for the derivation of such statistical usage profiles from only field failure data. Lastly, the applicability of the methods is demonstrated {{on a wide range of}} comprehensive case studies. Importantly, in most cases, substantiation of the methods is achieved by comparison of predicted failures with ‘real-world’ failures, in some cases made possible by the unusually long duration of the study.
