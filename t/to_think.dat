5|$|Galileo {{observed}} the planet Saturn, {{and at first}} mistook its rings for planets, thinking it was a three-bodied system.

The rings reappeared when he observed the planet in 1616, further confusing him.|$|E

5|$|Irene is a Neoclassical tragedy written between 1726 and 1749 by Samuel Johnson. It has the {{distinction}} of being the work Johnson considered his greatest failure. Since his death, the critical consensus has been that he was right <b>to</b> <b>think</b> so.|$|E

Higher still, types enable programmers <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about and express interfaces between two of any-sized subsystems. This enables more levels of localization so that the definitions required for interoperability of the subsystems remain consistent when those two subsystems communicate.|$|E
