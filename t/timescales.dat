40|$|We derive {{power density}} spectra in the optical and X-ray {{band in the}} <b>timescale</b> range from several years down to ∼ a day. We suggest that the optical power density {{spectrum}} consists of two separate components: long <b>timescale</b> variations and short <b>timescale</b> variations, with the dividing <b>timescale</b> around 100 days. The shape of the short <b>timescale</b> component is similar to X-ray power density spectrum {{which is consistent with}} the interpretation of short <b>timescale</b> optical variations being caused by X-ray reprocessing. We show that the observed optical long <b>timescale</b> variability is consistent with thermal pulsations of the accretion disc.

5|$|Due to the {{complexity}} of proteins' conformation or configuration space (the set of possible shapes a protein can take), and limits in computing power, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations have been severely limited in the <b>timescales</b> which they can study. While most proteins typically fold in the order of milliseconds, before 2010 simulations could only reach nanosecond to microsecond <b>timescales.</b> General-purpose supercomputers have been used to simulate protein folding, but such systems are intrinsically costly and typically shared among many research groups. Further, because the computations in kinetic models occur serially, strong scaling of traditional molecular simulations to these architectures is exceptionally difficult. Moreover, as protein folding is a stochastic process and can statistically vary over time, it is challenging computationally to use long simulations for comprehensive views of the folding process.|$|E

5|$|Planet Nine modifies {{the orbits}} of extreme trans-Neptunian objects via a {{combination}} of secular and resonant dynamics. The secular dynamics acts on very long <b>timescales</b> and causes {{the distance of the}} perihelia of anti-aligned objects to rise and fall while the directions of their perihelia oscillate. The resonant dynamics acts on shorter <b>timescales</b> and provides phase protection, maintaining the stability of the objects by preventing close approaches. The inclination of Planet Nine's orbit weakens this protection, resulting in a chaotic variation of semi-major axes as objects hop between resonances. The orbital poles of the objects circle that of the Solar System's Laplace plane, which is bent toward the plane of Planet Nine's orbit, causing their poles to be clustered toward one side.|$|E

30|$|The {{definition}} of the <b>timescale</b> is critical {{to bridge the gap}} between the deformation rate during the simulation of DEM and the heating rate that was obtained from the thermal structure. The calculation cost of the DEM method was observed to be so high that we were not able to calculate the deformation during the simulation of DEM over the natural geological <b>timescale</b> (i.e., thousands or millions of years). The <b>timescale</b> used for the DEM simulation, therefore, was set to satisfy the quasi-static deformation conditions to imitate the long-term geological deformation. Consequently, the <b>timescale</b> of the calculation step during the DEM simulation cannot be directly converted to the <b>timescale</b> of the thermal model. To solve this problem, we introduced a normalized <b>timescale</b> based on the displacement of the moving wall, which controls the deformation rate.|$|R

5|$|Geothermal {{power is}} {{considered}} to be renewable because any projected heat extraction is small compared to the Earth's heat content. The Earth has an internal heat content of 1031joules (3·1015TW·hr), approximately 100 billion times current (2010) worldwide annual energy consumption. About 20% of this is residual heat from planetary accretion, and the remainder is attributed to higher radioactive decay rates that existed in the past. Natural heat flows are not in equilibrium, and the planet is slowly cooling down on geologic <b>timescales.</b> Human extraction taps a minute fraction of the natural outflow, often without accelerating it.|$|E

Previous work has shown that such subsampling can lead to significant errors about the system’s causal structure if not properly taken into account. In this paper, we first consider {{the search for the}} system <b>timescale</b> causal structures that correspond to a given measurement <b>timescale</b> structure. We provide a constraint satisfaction procedure whose computational performance is several orders of magnitude better than previous approaches. We then consider finite-sample data as input, and propose the first constraint optimization approach for recovering the system <b>timescale</b> causal structure. This algorithm optimally recovers from possible conflicts due to statistical errors. More generally, these advances allow for a robust and non-parametric estimation of system <b>timescale</b> causal structures from subsampled time series data...|$|R

5|$|Hyperion is Titan's nearest {{neighbor}} in the Saturn system. The two moons {{are locked in}} a 4:3 mean-motion resonance with each other, meaning that while Titan makes four revolutions around Saturn, Hyperion makes exactly three. With an average diameter of about 270km, Hyperion is smaller and lighter than Mimas. It has an extremely irregular shape, and a very odd, tan-colored icy surface resembling a sponge, though its interior may be partially porous as well. The average density of about 0.55g/cm3 indicates that the porosity exceeds 40% even assuming it has a purely icy composition. The surface of Hyperion is covered with numerous impact craters—those with diameters 2–10km are especially abundant. It is the only moon besides the small moons of Pluto known to have a chaotic rotation, which means Hyperion has no well-defined poles or equator. While on short <b>timescales</b> the satellite approximately rotates around its long axis {{at a rate of}} 72–75° per day, on longer <b>timescales</b> its axis of rotation (spin vector) wanders chaotically across the sky. This makes the rotational behavior of Hyperion essentially unpredictable.|$|E

40|$|Molecular {{simulations}} and {{an energy}} landscape analysis {{are used to}} examine the stretching of a model protein. A mapping of the energy landscape shows that stretching the protein causes energy minima and energy barriers to flatten out and disappear, and new energy minima to be created. The implications of these landscape distortions depend on the <b>timescale</b> regime under which the protein is stretched. When the <b>timescale</b> for thermally activated processes is longer than the <b>timescale</b> of stretching, the disappearances of energy barriers provide the mechanism for protein unfolding. When the <b>timescale</b> for thermally activated processes is shorter than the <b>timescale</b> of stretching, the landscape distortions influence the stretching process by changing the number and types of energy minima in which the system can exist...|$|R

Finite time Lyapunov exponents are used to define the <b>timescale</b> gap. It is shown that the <b>timescale</b> gap can be used for quantification of the rate of convergence of trajectories to the collision course.

5|$|Freitas {{points out}} that probes, unlike the {{interstellar}} radio waves commonly targeted by SETI searches, could store information for long, perhaps geological, <b>timescales,</b> and could emit strong radio signals unambiguously recognizable as being of intelligent origin, rather than being dismissed as a UFO or a natural phenomenon. Probes could also modify any signal they send to suit the system they were in, which {{would be impossible for}} a radio transmission originating from outside the target star system. Moreover, the use of small robotic probes with widely distributed beacons in individual systems, rather than a small number of powerful, centralized beacons, would provide a security advantage to the civilization using them. Rather than revealing the location of a radio beacon powerful enough to signal the whole galaxy and risk such a powerful device being compromised, decentralized beacons installed on robotic probes need not reveal any information that an extraterrestrial civilization prefers others not to have.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the dynamics of}} a protostellar disc in a binary system where the disc is misaligned with the orbital plane of the binary, {{with the aim of}} determining the observational consequences for such systems. The disc wobbles with a period approximately equal to half the binary’s orbital period and precesses on a longer <b>timescale.</b> We determine the characteristic <b>timescale</b> for realignment of the disc with the orbital plane due to dissipation. If the dissipation is determined by a simple isotropic viscosity then we find, in line with previous studies, that the alignment <b>timescale</b> is of order the viscous evolution <b>timescale.</b> However, for typical protostellar disc parameters, if the disc tilt exceeds the opening angle of the disc, then tidally induced shearing within the disc is transonic. In general, hydrodynamic instabilities associated with the internally driven shear result in extra dissipation which is expected to drastically reduce the alignment <b>timescale.</b> For large disc tilts the alignment <b>timescale</b> is then comparable to the precession <b>timescale,</b> while for smaller tilt angles δ, the alignment <b>timescale</b> varies as (sin δ) − 1. We discuss the consequences of the wobbling, precession and rapid realignment for observations of protostellar jets and the implications for binary star formation mechanisms.
