30|$|In {{the energy}} density {{diagrams}} of electric field and magnetic field in Fig.  4, {{the change of}} color from blue to red indicates that <b>the</b> <b>absorption</b> rate <b>of</b> terahertz wave becomes larger.

5|$|Anti-vitamins are {{chemical}} compounds that inhibit the absorption or actions of vitamins. For example, avidin is a protein in raw egg whites that inhibits <b>the</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>of</b> biotin; it is deactivated by cooking.

5|$|Closed circuit rebreathers {{are usually}} {{controlled}} {{to provide a}} fairly constant partial pressure of oxygen during the dive (set point), and may be reset to a richer mix for decompression.

This minimizes <b>the</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>of</b> inert gas in the first place, and accelerates the elimination of the inert gases during ascent.|$|E
5|$|However, {{vegetables}} often {{also contain}} toxins and antinutrients which interfere with <b>the</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>of</b> nutrients. These include α-solanine, α-chaconine, enzyme inhibitors (of cholinesterase, protease, amylase, etc.), cyanide and cyanide precursors, oxalic acid, and others. These toxins are natural defenses, used {{to ward off}} the insects, predators and fungi that might attack the plant. Some beans contain phytohaemagglutinin, and cassava roots contain cyanogenic glycoside as do bamboo shoots. These toxins can be deactivated by adequate cooking. Green potatoes contain glycoalkaloids and should be avoided.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Cellulose {{hydrogel}} {{was prepared}} from cellulose/NaOH aqueous solutions. Silica was added into cellulose hydrogel by TEOS hydrolysis method. Finally aerogel {{was obtained by}} the freeze-drying technique. The influence of silica on the properties of cellulose aerogel was studied in detail. With cellulose content 3 %, <b>the</b> water <b>absorption</b> <b>of</b> cellulose-SiO 2 composite aerogel was only about 50 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water <b>absorption</b> <b>of</b> cellulose aerogel. <b>The</b> result showed that silica could effectively reduce <b>the</b> water <b>absorption</b> <b>of</b> cellulose aerogel significantly and reduce the extent of structural damage that resulted from highly water <b>absorption</b> <b>of</b> cellulose aerogel. At the same time, {{with the increase of}} cellulose content, density of cellulose aerogel increased, while porosity decreased.

5|$|Like {{most other}} Proteaceae, B.sessilis has {{compound}} cluster roots, roots with dense clusters of short lateral rootlets that form a mat {{in the soil}} just below the leaf litter. These exude a range of carboxylates, including citrate, malonate and trans-aconitate, that act as acid phosphatase, allowing <b>the</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>of</b> nutrients from nutrient-poor soils, such as the phosphorus-deficient native soils of Australia.|$|E
5|$|Photons {{can also}} be absorbed by nuclei, atoms or molecules, {{provoking}} transitions between their energy levels. A classic example is the molecular transition of retinal (C20H28O), {{which is responsible for}} vision, as discovered in 1958 by Nobel laureate biochemist George Wald and co-workers. The absorption provokes a cis-trans isomerization that, in combination with other such transitions, is transduced into nerve impulses. <b>The</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>of</b> photons can even break chemical bonds, as in the photodissociation of chlorine; this is the subject of photochemistry.|$|E

5|$|Aspirin {{is known}} to {{interact}} with other drugs. For example, acetazolamide and ammonium chloride are known to enhance the intoxicating effect of salicylates, and alcohol also increases the gastrointestinal bleeding associated with these types of drugs. Aspirin {{is known to}} displace a number of drugs from protein-binding sites in the blood, including the antidiabetic drugs tolbutamide and chlorpropamide, warfarin, methotrexate, phenytoin, probenecid, valproic acid (as well as interfering with beta oxidation, {{an important part of}} valproate metabolism), and other NSAIDs. Corticosteroids may also reduce the concentration of aspirin. Ibuprofen can negate the antiplatelet effect of aspirin used for cardioprotection and stroke prevention. The pharmacological activity of spironolactone may be reduced by taking aspirin, and it is known to compete with penicillin G for renal tubular secretion. Aspirin may also inhibit <b>the</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>of</b> vitamin C.|$|E
5|$|Blood free {{thyroxine}} and TSH {{levels are}} monitored {{to help determine}} whether the dose is adequate. This is done 4–8 weeks {{after the start of}} treatment or a change in levothyroxine dose. Once the adequate replacement dose has been established, the tests can be repeated after 6 and then 12 months, unless there is a change in symptoms. In people with central/secondary hypothyroidism, TSH is not a reliable marker of hormone replacement and decisions are based mainly on the free T4 level. Levothyroxine is best taken 30–60 minutes before breakfast, or four hours after food, as certain substances such as food and calcium can inhibit <b>the</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>of</b> levothyroxine.

40|$|A kind of EMIMTA {{ionic liquid}} was prepared.
