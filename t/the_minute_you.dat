500|$|Describing {{the tone}} of the season, Loeb said, [...] "When we first started talking about Daredevil, we promised that we were telling a story that was first a crime drama and then a superhero show. This is more of a {{psychological}} thriller. This speaks to when you think about what happened to Jessica and what sort of destroyed her life and how she tried to put it together, and then to have to confront the person who deconstructed her world, that’s a very powerful, emotional place to start from." [...] On approaching rape and trauma in the season, Rosenberg wanted to avoid actually showing rape, which she called [...] "lazy storytelling" [...] and often a way to [...] "spice up" [...] male characters, and preferred to just make the trauma a part of the characters' everyday lives rather than an [...] "issue" [...] for the season to tackle. When asked about the adult nature of the season, including the use of sex, Rosenberg explained that Marvel would only not allow showing nudity {{and the use of the}} word 'fuck' in the season. Regarding all of the social issues the season covered, such as [...] "issues of choice, interracial relationships, domestic violence, [...] issues of consent" [...] while also exploring [...] "feminism and being a woman in this world", Rosenberg said, [...] "It was never our intention going in , and I think <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> <b>you</b> intend to do that, you’re stepping up on a soap box. If you’re digging into the dark side of the human psyche and all the different experiences we go through, and as women we go through, you’re going to find those things. If you treat them honestly and with respect, you’re also going to hit social issues." ...|$|E
2500|$|Harrelson had {{input into}} the {{wardrobe}} for his character, Tallahassee. [...] "I never worked so long and hard on an outfit in my life," [...] he stated. [...] "What this guy wears is who he is. You {{want to get a}} sense of this guy as soon as you see him. So I pick out the necklaces, the sunglasses. But the hat? <b>The</b> <b>minute</b> <b>you</b> see that on Tallahassee, you buy him. He's real. And he's got a real cool hat". Harrelson's choice of headwear for Tallahassee came not just down to style, but also to his environmental passions: the distinctive hat is handmade in Brazil by a company called The Real Deal using recycled cargo-truck tarps and wire from old truck tires.|$|E
2500|$|On January 7, 2011, Reznor {{announced}} that he would again be working with Fincher, this time to provide the score for the American adaptation of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. A cover of [...] "Immigrant Song" [...] by Led Zeppelin, produced by Reznor and Ross, with Karen O (of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs) as the featured singer, accompanied a trailer for the film. Reznor and Ross' second collaboration with Fincher was scored as the film was shot, based on the concept, [...] "What if we give you music <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> <b>you</b> start to edit stuff together?" [...] Reznor explained in 2014 that the composition process was [...] "a lot more work," [...] and that he [...] "would be hesitant to go as far in that direction in the future." ...|$|E

6000|$|... “You are two fools,” I answered. “You’ll {{be turned}} {{back at the}} Frontier or cut up <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> <b>you</b> set foot in Afghanistan. Do you want any money or a {{recommendation}} down-country? I can help you to the chance of work next week.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tell me <b>the</b> instant <b>minute</b> <b>you</b> see Pa a comin', and I'll dish up the gravy," [...] was Mrs. Wilkins's command, as {{she stepped}} in {{with a cup of}} tea for old [...] "Harm," [...] as she called Hepsey's mother.|$|R

6000|$|... "You {{have slept}} {{and you are}} better," [...] she said pleasantly. [...] "Now for <b>the</b> next few <b>minutes</b> <b>you</b> must please devote {{yourself}} to making me comfortable. Put everything down, Phoebe. Mr. Romilly will look after me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know; but in case I stay you {{can make}} up your mind that I've {{concluded}} to do the business there, and when he comes toward the shanty be on your feet ready to jump in <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> <b>you</b> hear my voice." ...|$|E
60|$|This is too {{extraneous}} for me. That is {{the trouble}} with Mrs. Eddy when she sets out to explain an over-large exhibit: <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> <b>you</b> think the light is bursting upon you the candle goes out and your mind begins to wander.|$|E
6000|$|... "You are two fools," [...] I answered, [...] "You'll {{be turned}} {{back at the}} Frontier or cut up <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> <b>you</b> set foot in Afghanistan. Do you want any money or a {{recommendation}} down-country? I can help you to the chance of work next week." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, you see it's {{getting pretty}} late.

6000|$|... "How COULD you do such {{a brutal}} thing? At all events, let the darling have her nurse. It's not like you to let a little child suffer.

6000|$|... "I'm sure it would," [...] I said enthusiastically, for I {{was glad}} {{to find that the}} man had such a human side to him. [...] "So would yours.

To many in this far corner of our country, this visit of the President will ever remain as a {{pleasant}} memory. They could never hope to get to Washington, more than three thousand miles away, and to have him come out to see them was worth remembering.|$|E
6000|$|... “Don’t {{you believe}} it,” cried Runyon, earnestly. “With {{you to work}} for, I’ll make those tart old lemons pay the {{interest}} and a good income besides. In fact, if we live long enough, we may even manage to reduce the mortgages. You see, I’ve been extravagant and foolish, but it was because I had no aim in life. <b>The</b> <b>minute</b> <b>you</b> say ‘yes,’ I’m a reformed character.” ...|$|E
