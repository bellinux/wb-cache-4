500|$|By 1989, the Peace Candle {{had become}} so {{dilapidated}} that it was hardly able to sustain the winter weather. Strong winds in November had shaken the structure {{so much that the}} wax dripping fixtures atop the candle had fallen off. On November 16, 1989, Mayor Sal Panto Jr. announced on WEST's Voice of the People show that the Peace Candle would not go up another year because the support structure was too weak and the Easton Area Christmas Committee was not receiving enough donations to pay for repairs. The committee was now receiving an average of $3,000 a year in donations, which was used to maintain the existing candle. Panto said, [...] "The sad reality is, this is the last year." [...] However, new fundraising efforts were started to raise $20,000 to build a new Peace Candle. Local businesses and unions volunteered their <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>materials</b> to work on it, with the Lehigh Valley Carpenters Union working up to 100 hours a week for about five weeks to have the candle ready for the 1990 holiday season.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} pricing of {{software}} development outsourcing. Two pricing techniques – <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>material</b> <b>and</b> fixed price – are described {{and the economic}} conditions for selecting between them are discussed. Using agency theory and transaction cost economics, it is predicted that risky and specific systems will be priced on <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>material</b> basis while other projects will be fixed price. An additional prediction is that confidence in the vendor’s auditing of resources is essential for <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>material</b> contracts. The predictions are tested on fourteen external software development projects in two large corporations. Quantitative measures of risk, specificity and confidence are utilised, but the data-set {{does not support the}} theoretical predictions. In order to explain this result, interviews with senior managers at the two corporations have been conducted. Both disagree with the theoretical prescriptions: one contracts risky projects on fixed price basis, preferring to pay a risk-premium rather than to re-budget. The second expert allows fixed price only with trusted vendors, preferrin...|$|R

Empirical evidence presented in Chapter 1 showed not only that household work is a significant component of All Work, but also that it varies widely across households and across persons within households. It is shown that there are good theoretical reasons {{to suspect that the}} decision to move from no market work to some market work involves the expenditure of <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>material</b> resources.
