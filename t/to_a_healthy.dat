5|$|On 17 April 1555, Elizabeth was {{recalled}} {{to court}} to attend {{the final stages of}} Mary's apparent pregnancy. If Mary and her child died, Elizabeth would become queen. If, on the other hand, Mary gave birth <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>healthy</b> child, Elizabeth's chances of becoming queen would recede sharply. When it became clear that Mary was not pregnant, no one believed any longer that she could have a child. Elizabeth's succession seemed assured.|$|E

25|$|The {{concept of}} republican {{motherhood}} {{was inspired by}} this period and reflects the importance of Republicanism as the dominant American ideology. It assumed that a successful republic rested upon the virtue of its citizens. Women were considered to have the essential role of instilling their children with values conducive <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>healthy</b> republic. During this period, the wife's relationship with her husband also became more liberal, as love and affection instead of obedience and subservience began to characterize the ideal marital relationship. In addition, many women contributed {{to the war effort}} through fundraising and running family businesses in the absence of husbands.|$|E
25|$|Australia {{were sent}} in to bat by South Africa and {{were on the}} back foot early. In the third over of Australia's innings, Adam Gilchrist and Brad Haddin fell in {{successive}} balls to South African pace-bowler Shaun Pollock. Brad Hodge fell in the fourth and Australia were in trouble at 3/21 after 3.4 overs. Just {{as he did in}} the warm-up against New Zealand, Andrew Symonds steadied the ship scoring a strong 45 off 26 balls. Despite Symonds' resistance, South Africa continued to steadily take wickets, and only a late flurry of powerful hitting by tailender Mitchell Johnson propelled Australia <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>healthy</b> target of 8/179.|$|E
25|$|A {{study of}} the {{regions of the world}} known as blue zones, where people {{commonly}} live active lives past 100 years of age, speculated that longevity is related <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>healthy</b> social and family life, not smoking, eating a plant-based diet, frequent consumption of legumes and nuts, and engaging in regular physical activity. In a cohort study, the combination of a plant based diet, normal BMI, and not smoking accounted for differences up to 15 years in life expectancy. Korean court records going back to 1392 indicate that the average lifespan of eunuchs was 70.0 ± 1.76 years, which was 14.4–19.1 years longer than the lifespan of non-castrated men of similar socio-economic status.|$|E

25|$|It {{is not an}} {{easy task}} {{determining}} whether or not a bite by any species of snake is life-threatening. A bite by a North American copperhead on the ankle is usually a moderate injury <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>healthy</b> adult, but a bite to a child's abdomen or face by the same snake may be fatal. The outcome of all snakebites depends on a multitude of factors: the size, physical condition, and temperature of the snake, the age and physical condition of the person, the area and tissue bitten (e.g., foot, torso, vein or muscle), the amount of venom injected, the time it takes for the person to find treatment, and finally the quality of that treatment.|$|E
25|$|Masturbation is {{the sexual}} {{stimulation}} of one's own genitals for sexual arousal or other sexual pleasure, usually {{to the point}} of orgasm. The stimulation may involve hands, fingers, everyday objects, sex toys such as vibrators, or combinations of these. Mutual masturbation (mutual manual stimulation of the genitals between partners) can be a substitute for sexual penetration. Studies have found that masturbation is frequent in humans of both sexes and all ages, although there is variation. Various medical and psychological benefits have been attributed <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>healthy</b> attitude toward sexual activity in general and to masturbation in particular. No causal relationship is known between masturbation and any form of mental or physical disorder.|$|E
25|$|With {{regard to}} genetic testing and {{information}} in general, {{legislation in the}} United States called the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act prohibits group health plans and health insurers from denying coverage <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>healthy</b> individual or charging that person higher premiums based solely on a genetic predisposition to developing a disease in the future. The legislation also bars employers from using individuals’ genetic information when making hiring, firing, job placement, or promotion decisions. The legislation, {{the first of its}} kind in the U.S., was passed by the United States Senate on April 24, 2008, on a vote of 95-0, and was signed into law by President George W. Bush on May 21, 2008. It went into effect on November 21, 2009.|$|E

25|$|Silkworm {{breeding}} {{is aimed}} at the overall improvement of silkworm from a commercial point of view. The major objectives are improving fecundity (the egg-laying capacity of a breed), the health of larvae, quantity of cocoon and silk production, and disease resistance. Healthy larvae lead <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>healthy</b> cocoon crop. Health is dependent on factors such as better pupation rate, fewer dead larvae in the mountage, shorter larval duration (shorter larval duration lessens the chance of infection) and bluish-tinged fifth-instar larvae (which are healthier than the reddish-brown ones). Quantity of cocoon and silk produced {{are directly related to}} the pupation rate and larval weight. Healthier larvae have greater pupation rates and cocoon weights. Quality of cocoon and silk depends on a number of factors including genetics.|$|E
25|$|As used by homeopaths, {{the term}} {{allopathy}} has always {{referred to the}} principle of curing disease by administering substances that produce other symptoms (when given <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>healthy</b> human) than the symptoms produced by a disease. For example, part of an allopathic treatment for fever may include the use of a drug which reduces the fever, while also including a drug (such as an antibiotic) that attacks the cause of the fever (such as a bacterial infection). A homeopathic treatment for fever, by contrast, is one that uses a diluted and succussed dosage of a substance, usually containing no actual particles of that substance, that in an undiluted and unsuccussed form would induce fever in a healthy person. Hahnemann used this term to distinguish medicine as practiced in his time from his use of infinitesimally small (or nonexistent) doses of substances to treat the spiritual causes of illness.|$|E
25|$|Michael Hussey and Paul Collingwood led Durham <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>healthy</b> total {{against the}} Yorkshire bowlers in the 40 overs {{possible}} {{on the first}} day at Scarborough. Hussey ended the day on 85 not out as Durham made their way to 140 for 1. Deon Kruis and Tim Bresnan got one wicket each in the morning, but Durham fought back with Gordon Muchall and Dale Benkenstein adding 157 for the fourth wicket. Durham were eventually bowled out midway through day three, having made a total of 414. Kruis took five wickets and Bresnan four, but they both conceded more than 100 runs in the process. Yorkshire opted for batting practice, batting out the last day and a half to make 475 for 6, with Paul Jaques scoring 172. Paul Collingwood took three for 56 for Durham, but could not help them to an extra bowling point, and with no possibility of taking the third extra point Durham's captain Hussey agreed to a draw after Yorkshire's 129th over.|$|E

500|$|A study {{published}} in 2010 found that bees that were fed pollen {{from a variety of}} different plant species showed signs of having a healthier immune system than those eating pollen from a single species.
