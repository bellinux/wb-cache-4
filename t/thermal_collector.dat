25|$|Photovoltaic thermal hybrid solar {{collector}} (PVT) are systems that convert solar radiation into thermal and electrical energy. These systems combine a solar PV cell, which converts sunlight into electricity, with a solar <b>thermal</b> <b>collector,</b> which captures the remaining energy and removes waste {{heat from the}} PV module. The capture of both electricity and heat allow these devices to have higher exergy and thus be more overall energy efficient than solar PV or solar thermal alone.|$|E

25|$|A {{range of}} local, low-tech {{solutions}} are {{being pursued by}} a number of companies. These efforts center around the use of solar power to distill water at temperatures slightly beneath that at which water boils. By developing the capability to purify any available water source, local business models could be built around the new technologies, accelerating their uptake. For example, bedouins from the town of Dahab in Egypt have installed AquaDania's WaterStillar, which uses a solar <b>thermal</b> <b>collector</b> measuring two square metres to distill from 40 to 60 litres per day from any local water source. This is five times more efficient than conventional stills and eliminates the need for polluting plastic PET bottles or transportation of water supply.|$|E
25|$|The United States, France and the United Arab Emirates {{are working}} to develop {{practical}} solar desalination. AquaDania's WaterStillar has been installed at Dahab, Egypt, and in Playa del Carmen, Mexico. In this approach, a solar <b>thermal</b> <b>collector</b> measuring two square metres can distill from 40 to 60 litres per day from any local water source – five times more than conventional stills. It {{eliminates the need for}} plastic PET bottles or energy-consuming water transport. In Central California, a startup company WaterFX is developing a solar-powered method of desalination that can enable the use of local water, including runoff water that can be treated and used again. Salty groundwater in the region would be treated to become freshwater, and in areas near the ocean, seawater could be treated.|$|E
