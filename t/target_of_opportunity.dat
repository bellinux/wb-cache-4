Based on this information, the CIA {{not only}} increased their {{operations in the}} vicinity of the prisons in Military Region 3, but also changed their focus.

25|$|The small {{frontier}} {{settlement was}} almost {{wiped out in}} 1690 during King William's War, {{the first in the}} series of conflicts known as the French and Indian Wars. French troops and their Algonquin and Sault allies, retaliating for a series of British-backed Iroquois raids on their territory, {{were on their way to}} an assault on Fort Orange at present-day Albany when their scouts found that Schenectady's stockade was almost minimally staffed, and changed their plans to attack this <b>target</b> <b>of</b> <b>opportunity.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{attack was}} timed {{to have the}} maximum effect {{possible}} to keep the Luftwaffe interceptors pinned {{down on the ground}} and be unable to attack the heavy bombers. Also, the P-47 Thunderbolts of Ninth Air Force would be dispatched to perform fighter sweeps over Juvincourt after the Marauder raids, then meet up with the heavy bombers and provide fighter escort back to England. As the P-51 Mustang groups of Eighth Air Force began accompanying the heavy bombers all the way to their German targets by mid-1944, it was routine for them to also attack Juvincourt on their return to England with a fighter sweep and attack any <b>target</b> <b>of</b> <b>opportunity</b> to be found at the airfield.|$|E

25|$|On 11 February 1990, {{a patrol}} of the King's Own Scottish Borderers {{was sent to}} {{investigate}} a suspicious column of vehicles close to the border {{with the support of}} an unarmed Gazelle helicopter from the 656 Squadron, Army Air Corps. The motorcade was actually a diversionary manoeuvre set up by the East Tyrone Brigade to lure the troops into an ambush. As usual during the KOSB tour in Northern Ireland, the soldiers would be backed up by a helicopter. The main mission of the helicopters was to airlift patrols to different locations during a single day. Another key role was to scan the terrain for potential enemy ambushes and to block the IRA getaway by landing reinforcements on their escape route. It was never determined if the Provisionals had previously planned the shooting of the Gazelle or if the helicopter became a <b>target</b> <b>of</b> <b>opportunity.</b>|$|E
25|$|Sint-Truiden Air Base was a {{frequent}} target of USAAF Ninth Air Force B-26 Marauder medium bombers. The medium bombers would attack in coordinated raids, usually in the mid-to-late afternoon, with Eighth Air Force heavy bombers returning from attacking their targets in Germany. The attack was timed to have the maximum effect possible to keep the Luftwaffe interceptors pinned {{down on the ground}} and be unable to attack the heavy bombers. Also, the P-47 Thunderbolts of Ninth Air Force would be dispatched to perform fighter sweeps over Saint Trond after the Marauder raids, then meet up with the heavy bombers and provide fighter escort back to England.

500|$|An article {{published}} in People's Daily, China's top state newspaper, accused the United States and NATO of flouting international law and fanning terrorism. Simultaneously, many Chinese scholars, analysts and members of leading think tanks also expressed strong criticism of NATO's attack. A former spokesperson for the US state department said China, which is a close ally of Pakistan, [...] "sees this as a <b>target</b> <b>of</b> <b>opportunity,</b> both to tweak the US and to subtly suggest to Pakistan that if it really sours of {{its relationship with the}} US, it has an alternative".|$|E

2500|$|Each {{group had}} {{three or four}} combat squadrons of {{aircraft}} assigned to the airfield, making Juvincourt {{one of the largest}} and most active USAAF fields on the continent. [...] Attacks on German ground forces, bridges, airfields still in Luftwaffe hands, railroads and any <b>target</b> <b>of</b> <b>opportunity</b> of the German forces were targets of the Thunderbolts as the ground forces moved east into Luxembourg and past the Siegfried Line into Germany. In addition, the Royal Air Force also utilized Juvincourt, units and aircraft are yet to be determined.|$|E

2500|$|Lavelle {{testified that}} his liberalized {{interpretation}} of the Rules of Engagement did not allow the striking of every <b>target</b> <b>of</b> <b>opportunity.</b> He said that, [...] "We went in after those targets... which would hurt the enemy's defense system, {{so that we could}} operate." [...] Lavelle cited the example of a January 1972 observation of 55 to 60 tanks 11 miles north of the DMZ. He refused authorization to strike the tanks, saying, [...] "There is just no way we can make any liberalized interpretation that would authorize that strike." ...|$|E
2500|$|These {{activities}} led to Frescaty {{being attacked}} by USAAF Ninth Air Force B-26 Marauder medium bombers and P-47 Thunderbolts mostly with 500-pound General-Purpose bombs; unguided rockets and [...]50 caliber machine gun sweeps when Eighth Air Force heavy bombers (B-17s, B-24s) were within interception range of the Luftwaffe aircraft assigned to the base. The attacks were timed to have the maximum effect possible to keep the interceptors pinned {{down on the ground}} and be unable to attack the heavy bombers. [...] Also the P-51 Mustang fighter-escort groups of Eighth Air Force would drop down on their return to England and attack the base with a fighter sweep and attack any <b>target</b> <b>of</b> <b>opportunity</b> to be found at the airfield.|$|E
2500|$|There {{were nine}} air raids on Toyohashi between January and June 1945. About 25-30 {{people were killed}} in the first eight. These early air raids are barely {{mentioned}} in relevant historical texts and were probably the result of Allied bombers hitting Toyohashi as an alternate target or a <b>target</b> <b>of</b> <b>opportunity.</b> Only the ninth raid, by far the largest, became known as [...] "The Toyohashi Air Raid". [...] Starting late on the night of 19 June or after midnight, {{in the early hours of}} 20 June 1945, 136 Boeing B-29 Superfortresses conducted a firebombing operation on the city of Toyohashi. The air raid lasted for about three hours, and ended a little before dawn. The areas primarily affected included a large part of the downtown area between Toyohashi Station and City Hall, large sections of the Azumada and Maebata neighborhoods, and neighborhoods around Azumada Elementary School.|$|E

2500|$|In March 1944, Roye-Amy {{became a}} day {{interceptor}} airfield which housed fighters {{to attack the}} USAAF Eighth Air Force heavy bomber fleets attacking targets in Occupied Europe and Germany. Schnellkampfgeschwader 10 (SKG 10) flew Focke-Wulf Fw 190As from 9 March until 13 May 1944. [...] Previously not attacked by Allied bombers, Roye-Amy came under attack by Ninth Air Force B-26 Marauder medium bombers and P-47 Thunderbolts mostly with 500-pound General-Purpose bombs; unguided rockets and [...]50 caliber machine gun sweeps when Eighth Air Force heavy bombers (B-17s, B-24s) were within interception range of the Luftwaffe aircraft assigned to the base.

2500|$|The bombing limited {{much of the}} {{leniency}} the Swiss {{had shown}} toward Allied airspace violations. Eventually, the problem became so bad that they declared a zero-tolerance policy for violation by either Axis or Allied aircraft and authorized attacks on American aircraft. Victims of these mistaken bombings were not limited to Swiss civilians, however, but included the often confused American aircrews, shot down by the Swiss fighters {{as well as several}} Swiss fighters shot down by American airmen. In February 1945, 18 civilians were killed by Allied bombs dropped over Stein am Rhein, Vals, and Rafz. Arguably the most notorious incident came on March 4, 1945, when both Basel and Zurich were accidentally bombed by American aircraft. The attack on Basel's railway station led to the destruction of a passenger train, but no casualties were reported. However, a B-24 Liberator dropped its bomb load over Zürich, destroying two buildings and killing five civilians. The aircraft's crew believed that they were attacking Freiburg in Germany. As John Helmreich points out, the pilot and navigator, in choosing a <b>target</b> <b>of</b> <b>opportunity,</b> [...] "missed the marshalling yard they were aiming for, missed the city they were aiming for, and even missed the country they were aiming for".|$|E

50|$|Enschede {{was bombed}} on several occasions, most notably on October 10, 1943 and February 22, 1944.
