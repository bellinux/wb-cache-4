5|$|Dead reckoning, {{in animals}} usually known as path integration, means the putting <b>together</b> <b>of</b> cues from {{different}} sensory sources within the body, {{without reference to}} visual or other external landmarks, to estimate position relative to a known starting point continuously while travelling on a path {{that is not necessarily}} straight. Seen as a problem in geometry, the task is to compute the vector to a starting point by adding the vectors for each leg of the journey from that point.|$|E
5|$|I {{certainly}} don't see gay {{and lesbian}} history starting with Stonewall... and I don't see resistance starting with Stonewall. What I do see is a historical coming <b>together</b> <b>of</b> forces, and the sixties changed how human beings endured things in this society and what they refused to endure... Certainly something special happened on that night in 1969, and we've made it more special in our need to have what I call a point of origin... it's more complex than saying that {{it all started with}} Stonewall.|$|E

And even for me, when I look at them, they say so much. Photos really tell a thousand words.|$|E

5|$|Lennon {{considered}} the song his greatest accomplishment. The track incorporates reverse-recorded instrumentation and tape loops, and was created from the editing <b>together</b> <b>of</b> two separate {{versions of the}} song – each one entirely different in tempo, mood and musical key. The song was later included on the US Magical Mystery Tour LP (although not on the British double EP package of the same name).|$|E
5|$|Scholarship in {{the area}} of Jewish Christian studies has tended to be based on {{artificial}} constructs similar to those developed by the early Christian heresiologists, with the underlying assumption that all of the beliefs and practices of these groups were based on theology. This has led to the perpetuation of ideological definitions that fail {{to take into account the}} pluriformity of these groups, reflecting differences in geography, time periods in history, and ethnicity. With respect to Epiphanius, and the Ebionites in particular, insufficient attention has been paid to the highly speculative nature of his theological constructs and his mixing <b>together</b> <b>of</b> disparate sources, including his use of a gospel harmony that may have had nothing to do with the Ebionite sect known to Irenaeus. In the end, he presents an enigmatic picture of the Ebionites and their place in early Christian history.|$|E
5|$|The Nifo oti, or Samoan fire knife dance, {{is also a}} kind {{of weapon}} dance. The kailao is a {{standing}} male war dance of Tonga. The kailao is performed by men (less commonly women also perform it with the men as a mixed dance), who carry clubs or fighting sticks. The performers dance in a fierce manner to emulate combat, all {{to the accompaniment of}} a slit drum or a tin box. Additional idiophonic percussion is provided by strung rattles worn on the anklets of the dancers, and the clashing <b>together</b> <b>of</b> the wooden implements of war, which today are either sticks or mock weapons. The dance is unusual for Tonga in that it lacks recited poetry as accompaniment, which fact is taken to mean that it was imported to Tonga from elsewhere.|$|E

5|$|Small {{pieces of}} gold foil {{featuring}} engravings dating from the Migration Period into the early Viking Age (known as gullgubber) have been discovered in various locations in Scandinavia, almost 2,500 at one location. The foil pieces have been found largely at sites of buildings, only rarely in graves. The figures are sometimes single, occasionally an animal, sometimes {{a man and a}} woman with a leafy bough between them, facing or embracing one another. The human figures are almost always clothed and are sometimes depicted with their knees bent. Scholar Hilda Ellis Davidson says that it has been suggested that the figures are partaking in a dance, and that they may have been connected with weddings, as well as linked to the Vanir group of gods, representing the notion of a divine marriage, such as in the Poetic Edda poem Skírnismál; the coming <b>together</b> <b>of</b> Gerðr and Freyr.|$|E

25|$|The Constructivists were early {{developers}} {{of the techniques}} of photomontage.

However Constructivist montages would be less 'destructive' than those of Dadaism. Perhaps {{the most famous of}} these montages was Rodchenko's illustrations of the Mayakovsky poem About This.|$|E
