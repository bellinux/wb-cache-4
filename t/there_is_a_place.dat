They describe virtuous conduct and man's obligation to God, nature and society, and ask as if <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> for simple appreciation of nature without having to actively dedicate one's life to altruism.|$|E

[...] Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, during a discussion about terrorism, torture and the law, took offense at a Canadian judge's remark that Canada, [...] "thankfully", did not consider what Jack Bauer would do when setting policy. He reportedly responded with a defense of Bauer, arguing that law enforcement officials deserve latitude in times of great crisis, and that no jury would convict Bauer in those types of situations.|$|E

2500|$|The {{increased}} importance new-perspective {{writers have}} given to good works in salvation has created strong {{common ground with}} the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches.

2500|$|Daniel Dennett {{argued that}} {{the way we think}} we are seeing the world is, for the most part, an illusion. Part of Dennett's {{argument}} is the claim that each of us possess what he calls a [...] "Cartesian theater", in which we believe there is a full representation of the visual world in our mind and that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> in the mind where it is observed. According to Dennett, none of this exists. Instead, the only place where a full and rich representation exists is directly on the fovea, and every time a saccade occurs, the information is overwritten. Therefore, {{there is no such thing}} as transsaccadic memory. Information previously lost only appears to be retained in visual memory because we can look again. In this way, the outside world acts as a visual memory. Since our eyes are constantly moving, we are not aware that visual inputs are constantly being refreshed to give the illusion of the completed picture we think we are seeing.|$|E
2500|$|The Daughters of Bilitis {{initially}} approached {{relations between}} lesbians and the heterosexual {{society at large}} by promoting assimilation as much as possible, {{in the hopes that}} heterosexuals would see that lesbians were not drastically different from themselves. The debate about the appropriateness and impact of women exhibiting masculine dress and behavior was carried out in the pages of The Ladder. [...] "The kids in the fly-front pants and with the butch haircuts and mannish manner are the worst publicity we can get," [...] wrote one reader in 1956, to which DOB President D. Griffin responded, [...] "Our organization has already touched on that matter and converted a few to remembering that they are women first and a butch for fem secondly, so their attire should be that which society will accept.

2500|$|ICD-11 invokes a more {{sophisticated}} architecture than historical versions, consistent with its generation as a digital resource. [...] The core content of the system, called the Foundation Component, is a semantic network of words and terms, where any given term can {{have more than one}} parent. [...] To address the requirement that statistical classifications exhibit mutual exclusiveness (so events are not counted more than once) and exhaustiveness (so <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> to tally all events), ICD11 supports the serialization of the Foundation Component into an arbitrary number of linearizations, optimized for use cases. [...] The main linearization, presently called the Joint Linearization for Morbidity and Mortality Statistics, is the tabular format with which most traditional users will become familiar. However, other linearizations, for primary care, multiple sub-specialty derivatives, or applications such as clinical decision support are possible. [...] Finally, preliminary work in partnership with the IHTSDO is underway to ensure that the ICD-11 Foundation Component is semantically coherent through development of the Common Ontology, a subset of SNOMED CT which will anchor the Foundation Component to terms defined through description logic.|$|E

Kemmangundi, at a height of 1,434 meters, is surrounded by thick forests and a salubrious climate throughout the year. It is surrounded by the Baba Budan Giri range and blessed with silver cascades of mountain streams and lush vegetation. Its beautifully laid out ornamental gardens and enchanting mountain and valley views are a treat to the eye. Spectacular sunsets are a must see from various locations in the district, even from the Raj Bhavan. For the adventurous, Kemmangundi offers many peaks to scale and intricate jungle paths to explore. This place has a beautiful rose garden and other attractions. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> called Z-point at about 10 minutes walk from this main place which gives a nice aerial view of the Shola grass lands of the Western Ghats.|$|E

She gives an analogy for the reader regarding those who would discuss and comment on the phenomenon of the Internet-based community without prior experience: [...] "Journalists who don't use the Net themselves routinely make such egregious technological and cultural errors that you can only compare the results to what would happen if they were assigned to write about the interstate highway system based on their experiences at sea.... f the police told you that prostitutes routinely and openly solicited truckers and other visitors to roadside rest areas and that therefore they were risky places for families to visit, you would probably believe them and write the story....

2500|$|Its {{location}} {{near the}} Syrian border makes Antakya more cosmopolitan than many cities in Turkey. It did not attract the mass immigration {{of people from}} eastern Anatolia in the 1980s and 1990s that radically swelled the populations of Mediterranean cities such as Adana and Mersin. Both Turkish and Arabic are still widely spoken in Antakya, although written Arabic is rarely used. A mixed community of faiths and denominations co-exist peacefully here. [...] Although almost all the inhabitants are Muslim, a substantial proportion adhere to the Alevi and the Arab Alawi traditions, in 'Harbiye' <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> to honour the Alawite saint Hızır. Numerous tombs of saints, of both Sunni and Alawite, are located throughout the city.

With its long history of spiritual and religious movements, Antakya {{is a place of}} pilgrimage for Christians.

2500|$|Reading {{the report}} of Tamar in [...] "She sat in the gate of Enaim," [...] Rabbi Alexander taught that Tamar went {{and sat at the}} {{entrance}} of the place of Abraham, the place to which all eyes ( [...] , einaim) look. Alternatively, Rav Hanin said in the name of Rav that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> called Enaim, and it is the same place mentioned in [...] when it speaks of [...] "Tappuah and Enam." [...] Alternatively, Rabbi Samuel bar Nahmani taught that the place is called Enaim because Tamar gave eyes ( [...] , einaim) to her words; that is, Tamar gave convincing replies to Judah's questions. When Judah solicited her, he asked her if she was a Gentile, and she replied that she was a convert. When Judah asked her if she was a married woman, she replied that she was unmarried. When Judah asked her if perhaps her father had accepted marriage proposals on her behalf betrothals (making her forbidden to Judah), she replied that she was an orphan. When Judah asked her if perhaps she was ritually unclean (because she was a menstruant, or niddah, and thus forbidden to Judah), she replied that she was clean..|$|E
2500|$|Reading the words, [...] "And he lighted {{upon the}} place," [...] in [...] to mean, [...] "And {{he met the}} Divine Presence (Shechinah)" [...] Rav Huna asked in Rabbi Ammi's name why [...] assigns to God the name [...] "the Place." [...] Rav Huna {{explained}} that it is because God is the Place of the world (the world is contained in God, and not God in the world). Rabbi Jose ben Halafta taught {{that we do not}} know whether God is the place of God's world or whether God's world is God's place, but from [...] which says, [...] "Behold, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> with Me," [...] it follows that God is the place of God's world, but God's world is not God's place. Rabbi Isaac taught that reading [...] "The eternal God is a dwelling place," [...] one cannot know whether God is the dwelling-place of God's world or whether God's world is God's dwelling-place. But reading [...] "Lord, You have been our dwelling-place," [...] it follows that God is the dwelling-place of God's world, but God's world is not God's dwelling-place. And Rabbi Abba ben Judan taught that God is like a warrior riding a horse with the warrior's robes flowing over {{on both sides of the}} horse.
