5|$|Blast Corps is a single-player action video game. The player {{controls}} {{vehicles to}} destroy buildings, farms, and other {{structures in the}} path of a runaway nuclear missile carrier. The player fails if the carrier collides with an object. The eight demolition vehicles vary in the way they clear structures: <b>the</b> <b>bulldozer</b> rams, the dump truck drifts, the lightweight buggy crashes from higher ground, the tricycle shoots missiles, another truck presses outwards from its sides, and robot mechs tumble and stomp from the land and the air. The player must transfer between vehicles and other machinery to solve puzzles. Objectives include transporting timed explosive crates and bridging gaps. The game's puzzles increase in difficulty as the player progresses through its 57 levels.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, The Guinness Book of World Records {{recognized}} Vulović as {{the world}} record holder for surviving the highest fall without a parachute. She was fired from JAT in 1990 after taking part in anti-government protests, but avoided arrest because the government {{was concerned about the}} negative publicity that her imprisonment would bring. She continued her work as a pro-democracy activist until the Socialist Party of Serbia was ousted from power during <b>the</b> <b>Bulldozer</b> Revolution of October 2000. Vulović later campaigned on behalf of the Democratic Party of Serbia, advocating Serbia's entry into the European Union. The final years of her life were spent in seclusion and she continued to struggle with survivor's guilt. Having divorced, she lived alone in her Belgrade apartment on a small pension until her death in 2016.|$|E
5|$|Marge asks Belle {{to close}} down the burlesque house, but Belle refuses, saying that {{the house is a}} part of Springfield. At a town meeting, Marge brings up the matter and shows {{pictures}} of several prominent citizens leaving. They form a mob so they can go destroy the burlesque house. The mob arrives at the house and immediately starts destroying things. Bart and Homer arrive and Homer decides to try to convince the mob to stop. He does so by singing a musical number accompanied by Belle and some of her dancers. The town soon joins in and are convinced to let the house stay. However, Marge arrives with a bulldozer, having missed the song. The town announces their intentions to let the house stay, but Marge tries to sing her own song about her views. During the opening lines, she accidentally puts <b>the</b> <b>bulldozer</b> into drive and destroys a wing of the burlesque house. She apologizes profusely and, to pay for the damage, she starts a ventriloquist act at the house.|$|E

50|$|A {{number of}} planned arrests {{occurred}} when people locked themselves to heavy machinery. On September 3, 2016, the DAPL {{brought in a}} private security firm. <b>The</b> company used <b>bulldozers</b> to dig up part of the pipeline route that was subject to a pending injunction motion; it contained possible Native graves and burial artifacts. <b>The</b> <b>bulldozers</b> arrived within a day from when the tribe filed legal action. When unarmed protesters moved near <b>the</b> <b>bulldozers,</b> <b>the</b> guards used pepper spray and guard dogs to attack the protesters. At least six protesters were treated for dog bites, and an estimated 30 protesters were pepper-sprayed before the security guards and their dogs exited the scene in trucks.|$|R

5|$|The 2/28th Battalion probed {{into the}} Pocket on 16 June. The {{previous}} day a 2/11th Commando Squadron patrol had {{reported that the}} track along Lyon Ridge would be passable by tanks if a bomb crater was filled, and {{on the morning of}} the 16th A Company from the 2/28th Battalion accompanied by a troop of three tanks and a bulldozer began to move south along it. After <b>the</b> <b>bulldozer</b> filled the crater, the force continued along Lyon Ridge but became pinned down by heavy fire from Japanese troops on Eastman Spur to the south-east of the ridge. One of the Australian tanks was damaged. A subsequent attempt by a section from the 2/11th Commando Squadron to advance towards Eastman Spur to the east of A Company was also beaten back, with two Australians killed and another wounded. A Company resumed its advance during the afternoon, supported by a new troop of tanks. The three tanks moved ahead of the infantry, and killed eight or ten Japanese personnel, but one was damaged by a bomb and another became bogged. By the end of the day, A Company had suffered five men killed and 23 wounded. Overall, 150 patients were admitted by the 24th Brigade's attached medical units during 16 June, which stretched their capacity.|$|E
25|$|The {{exact nature}} of her death and the culpability of <b>the</b> <b>bulldozer</b> {{operator}} are disputed, with fellow ISM protestors saying that the Israeli soldier operating <b>the</b> <b>bulldozer</b> deliberately ran over Corrie, and Israeli eyewitnesses {{saying that it was}} an accident since <b>the</b> <b>bulldozer</b> operator could not see her.|$|E
25|$|Still {{wearing her}} {{fluorescent}} jacket, she knelt down at least 15 meters {{in front of}} <b>the</b> <b>bulldozer,</b> and began waving her arms and shouting, just as activists had successfully done dozens of times that day....

Despite this, the operator continued forward, which caused her to fall back, out {{of view of the}} driver. He continued forward, and she tried to scoot back, but was quickly pulled underneath <b>the</b> <b>bulldozer.</b> We ran towards him, and waved our arms and shouted; one activist with the megaphone. But <b>the</b> <b>bulldozer</b> operator continued forward, until Corrie was all the way underneath the central section of <b>the</b> <b>bulldozer.</b>|$|E
25|$|The 383 car {{was also}} used as the tow vehicle in the crash scene {{at the end of}} the movie. A quarter-mile cable was {{attached}} between the Challenger and an explosives-laden 1967 Chevrolet Camaro with the motor and transmission removed. The tow vehicle was driven by Loftin, who pulled the Camaro into the blades of <b>the</b> <b>bulldozers</b> at high speed. Loftin expected the car to go end over end, but instead it stuck into <b>the</b> <b>bulldozers,</b> which he thought looked better.|$|R
50|$|Between <b>the</b> wars, D9 <b>bulldozers</b> were {{employed}} in earthworks, fortifications buildings, opening routes and clearing explosive charges.

25|$|The major {{points of}} dispute are whether <b>the</b> <b>bulldozer</b> {{operator}} saw Corrie and whether her injuries {{were caused by}} being crushed under the blade or by the mound of debris <b>the</b> <b>bulldozer</b> was pushing. An IDF spokesman has acknowledged that Israeli army regulations normally require that the operators of the armored personnel carriers (APCs) that accompany bulldozers are responsible for directing the operators towards their targets because the Caterpillar D9 bulldozers have a restricted field of vision with several blind spots.|$|E
25|$|Rachel Corrie (April 10, 1979– March 16, 2003) was an American Evergreen State College {{student and}} member of the International Solidarity Movement (ISM) who {{traveled}} to the Gaza Strip during the Second Intifada. She was killed in the Gaza Strip by a Caterpillar D9R armored bulldozer operated by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) while protecting the family home of local pharmacist Samir Nasrallah from demolition by the IDF. According to the Israeli authorities the demolitions were carried out to eliminate weapons smuggling tunnels. According to human rights groups the demolitions were collective punishment.The exact nature of her death and the culpability of <b>the</b> <b>bulldozer</b> operator are disputed, with fellow ISM protesters saying that the Israeli soldier operating <b>the</b> <b>bulldozer</b> deliberately ran over Corrie, and Israeli eyewitnesses saying that it was an accident since <b>the</b> <b>bulldozer</b> operator could not see her.|$|E

25|$|The events {{surrounding}} Corrie's death are disputed. Fellow ISM activists {{said that the}} soldier operating <b>the</b> <b>bulldozer</b> deliberately ran Corrie over while she was acting as a human shield to prevent the demolition of the home of local pharmacist Samir Nasrallah. They said she was between <b>the</b> <b>bulldozer</b> and a wall near Nasrallah's home, in which ISM activists {{had spent the night}} several times. Israeli eyewitnesses maintain that the death was accidental because <b>the</b> <b>bulldozer</b> operator was unable to see Corrie due to the vehicle's obstructed view. Furthermore, Israeli witnesses maintain that Corrie was not defending a house from being demolished and was instead inhibiting a military operation to find contraband weapons and smuggling tunnels in Gaza. An IDF officer testified in court that on that day they were only clearing vegetation and rubble from houses that were previously demolished, and that no new houses were slated for demolition.|$|E
25|$|There's {{no way he}} didn't see her, {{since she}} was {{practically}} looking into the cabin. At one stage, he turned around toward the building. <b>The</b> <b>bulldozer</b> kept moving, and she slipped and fell off the plow. But <b>the</b> <b>bulldozer</b> kept moving, the shovel above her. I guess it was about 10 or 15 meters that it dragged her {{and for some reason}} didn't stop. We shouted like crazy to the operator through loudspeakers that he should stop, but he just kept going and didn't lift the shovel. Then it stopped and backed up. We ran to Rachel. She was still breathing.|$|E
