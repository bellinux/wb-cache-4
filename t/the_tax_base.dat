5|$|By then, the Pagan Empire, despite outward {{appearances}} of calmness, {{had been in}} long and slow decline since the early 13th century. The continuous growth of tax-free religious wealth had greatly reduced <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> <b>base</b> of the kingdom. The crown had lost resources needed to retain the loyalty of courtiers and military servicemen, inviting a vicious circle of internal disorders and external challenges. Although {{it was able to}} put down the first batch of serious rebellions in 1258–60 in South Arakan and Martaban (Mottama), the decline continued. On the eve of the Mongol invasions, between one and two-thirds of Upper Burma's cultivable land had been donated to religion. The crown's ability to mobilize defenses was in serious jeopardy.|$|E

The United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare wished to purchase the site for its new headquarters, but the RLA declined to sell the property.

5|$|On local issues, Howard was an {{advocate}} of opening Richmond to gambling facilities, {{which led to the}} River Rock Casino Resort. He was supportive of heritage preservation measures but opposed Richmond's tree preservation bylaw. He was the only one on council who preferred the elevated option for the Canada Line (then known as the Richmond-Airport-Vancouver Line), whereas the other councillors preferred the ground level option or no SkyTrain extension at all. He was {{an advocate}} for building a convention centre and the most ardent supporter of removing a 55-acre piece of land from the Agricultural Land Reserve as a possible location for it, though the removal was refused. When the possibility of the city constructing a speed-skating oval associated with the 2010 Winter Olympics came, Howard was a vocal supporter. He travelled to Lillehammer, Norway, in 2004 as part of a committee to investigate similar facilities built for the 1994 Winter Olympics. He also traveled to Pierrefonds, Quebec and Asia as part of the sister city program. He was not supportive of proposals to build a new soccer facility or financially contributing to tall ships tourism attractions. Because previous councils had made funding commitments {{at the expense of the}} city's reserve funds rather than <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> <b>base,</b> Howard's time on council was marked with consistent property tax increases around 3 to 4% each year. Howard unsuccessfully lobbied other councillors to hire more police officers. He became the subject of a lawsuit, along with other Richmond First councillors, alleging a conflict-of-interest occurred after they approved a rezoning allowing a controversial pub.|$|E
40|$|Excerpt] Since 1950, {{self-employed}} {{individuals have}} been {{covered by the}} Social Security system. In many regards, their obligation to pay Self-Employment Contributions Act (SECA) <b>taxes</b> into <b>the</b> Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) and Hospital Insurance (HI) trust funds and their entitlement to Social Security and Medicare benefits parallel those of workers who are not self-employed and who thus are covered under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA). In both cases, <b>the</b> OASDI <b>tax</b> <b>base</b> is limited to income below a certain threshold, and <b>the</b> HI <b>tax</b> <b>base</b> is not constrained by any income ceiling. The two systems, however, diverge in an important way: <b>The</b> FICA <b>tax</b> is <b>based</b> solely on income from labor, but <b>the</b> SECA <b>tax</b> is <b>based</b> on net business income, which can also include income from capital. Such a difference in <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> code (say, among businesses providing the same goods and services) can prompt people to make choices {{that they would not}} otherwise make about self-employment or the organizational form of a business, thereby reducing the efficient allocation of resources. For this analysis, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) decomposed <b>the</b> SECA <b>tax</b> <b>bases</b> for HI and OASDI into their labor and capital components, but the discussion focuses on <b>the</b> HI <b>tax</b> <b>base</b> because it is unconstrained by the income ceiling of <b>the</b> OASDI <b>tax.</b> CBO estimates that approximately 40 percent of <b>the</b> SECA-HI <b>tax</b> <b>base</b> (<b>the</b> amount of self-employment income subject to <b>the</b> HI <b>tax)</b> derives from capital, and the remainder derives from labor. Furthermore, {{more than half of the}} labor income of self-employed people—that is, the portion of their business income that would be subject to <b>the</b> FICA-HI <b>tax</b> if <b>the</b> business was incorporated instead of being a sole proprietorship or a partnership—is not included in <b>the</b> SECA-HI <b>tax</b> <b>base.</b> That occurs because when net income from all of a taxpayer’s businesses is less than the labor income from those businesses, the excess labor income is excluded from <b>the</b> SECA <b>tax</b> <b>base.</b> There is no similar exclusion from <b>the</b> FICA <b>tax</b> <b>base.</b> With both <b>the</b> <b>taxed</b> capital income and the excluded labor income accounted for, <b>the</b> total SECA-HI <b>tax</b> <b>base</b> is roughly three-quarters of the amount of income that would be taxable under the FICA-HI rules. Lawmakers could change <b>the</b> SECA <b>tax</b> <b>base</b> to try to align it more closely with the rules governing <b>the</b> FICA <b>tax</b> <b>base.</b> CBO analyzed three options for alignment that would modify <b>the</b> SECA <b>tax</b> <b>base</b> by either reducing the share of capital income or increasing the share of labor income included in that base. No option by itself would accomplish both of those objectives when applied to both sole proprietorships and partnerships, but one option would do so if applied only to partnerships. Two of the options would reduce the size of <b>the</b> SECA <b>tax</b> base—in one case by more than half—whereas the third option would increase <b>the</b> SECA <b>tax</b> <b>base</b> by a little...|$|R

40|$|The recent {{financial}} and economic {{crisis of the}} European Union had exposed the necessity to complete monetary union with an economic union.

25|$|Graphical {{representations}} of the curve sometimes appear to put the rate at around 50%, if <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> <b>base</b> reacts to the tax rate linearly, but the optimal rate could theoretically be any percentage greater than 0% and less than 100%. Similarly, the curve is often presented as a parabolic shape, {{but there is no}} reason that this is necessarily the case. The effect of changes in tax can be cased in terms of elasticities, where the optimal elasticity of <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> <b>base</b> with respect to the tax is equal to 1. This is done by differentiating R with respect to t and grouping terms to reveal that the rate of change of R with respect to t is equal to the sum of elasticity of <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> <b>base</b> plus one all multiplied by <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> <b>base.</b> Thus as elasticity surpasses one absolute value, revenues begin to fall.
