He requested his messengers to bring the children a package including lemons, meat, honey, rice, milk and a reed, and to note which child took the reed and stood near the central pillar of the house; <b>this</b> <b>child</b> was Rakotomavo.|$|E

Their hoax is almost revealed at a neighborhood barbecue when a fork stabs her pregnancy stomach pads. Orson suggests coming clean to avoid the humiliation if their lies were to be discovered, but Bree tells him that <b>this</b> <b>child</b> is her second chance at successfully raising a child.

5|$|Sing {{was born}} on 2 March 1886 in Clermont, Queensland, Australia, {{the son of a}} Chinese father and an English mother. His parents were John Sing (c. 1842–1921), a drover from Shanghai, China, and Mary Ann Sing (née Pugh; c. 1857–unknown), a nurse from Kingswinford, Staffordshire, England. Sing's mother had given birth to a {{daughter}} named Mary Ann Elizabeth Pugh on 28 May 1883, less than two months before marrying Sing's father on 4 July 1883. It is unclear whether <b>this</b> <b>child</b> was John Sing's daughter as well. A daughter, Beatrice Sing, was later born into the family on 12 July 1893. The three children grew up together on the farm run by the Sings, and all three performed well academically.|$|E
5|$|The {{inspiration}} for Burger's Daughter came when Gordimer {{was waiting to}} visit a political detainee in prison, and amongst the other visitors she saw a school girl, {{the daughter of an}} activist she knew. She wondered what <b>this</b> <b>child</b> was thinking and what family obligations were making her stand there. The novel opens with the same scene: a 14-year-old Rosa Burger waiting outside a prison to visit her detained mother. Gordimer said that children like these, whose activist parents were frequently arrested and detained, periodically had to manage entire households on their own, and it must have changed their lives completely. She stated that it was these children who encouraged her to write the book.|$|E
5|$|Black {{believes}} Prine is not {{driven by}} malice; he and Watts use {{the resources of}} the Millennium Group to find his home, discovering the dense writings across his floors. They learn that Prine believes a third world war is imminent, and took the children as he believes one of them is destined to bring peace during this time, wishing to protect <b>this</b> <b>child</b> when he learns which one it is destined to be. Black seeks aid from another Group member, Lara Means (Kristen Cloke), who is able to observe Prine's behavioural tells for clues when interviewing him. This, coupled with analysis of soil from his clothing, points to the children being held in an aluminium quarry. The investigators rush to the quarry, where Prine's accomplice engages them in a firefight. However, the advancing tornado forces them to take cover; it kills Prine and lifts the roof from the entombing bunker. It subsides as quickly as it arrived, and the children emerge safely from the wreckage; Black senses that Cayce's daughter may be the prophesied peacemaker. It turns out that the tornado destroyed the school where the children would have been if they weren't abducted, and that Prine had saved their lives.|$|E

25|$|In winter 952, Adelaide {{gave birth}} to a son, whom she named Henry after her {{brother-in-law}} and the child's grandfather, Henry the Fowler. Rumors spread that Otto had been persuaded by his wife and brother to propose <b>this</b> <b>child</b> as his heir instead of Liudolf. For many German nobles, this rumor represented Otto's final transformation from a policy focused on Germany to an Italian-centered one. The idea that Otto would ask them to revoke the succession rights of Liudolf prompted many nobles into open rebellion. Liudolf and Conrad first led the nobles against Henry, the Duke of Bavaria, in spring 953. Henry was unpopular with the Bavarians due to his Saxon heritage, and his vassals quickly rebelled against him.|$|E

25|$|A {{daughter}} (July 1717). The Duchess {{had retired}} at the Château de la Muette {{to hide the}} term of her pregnancy. The putative father Sicaire Antonin Armand Auguste Nicolas d'Aydie, Chevalier de Rion, became Berry's lover sometime in 1716 or 1717. In his additions to the diary of Dangeau on 21 July 1719, Saint-Simon mentions that the Duchess had managed to hide a first pregnancy by Rion, bringing forth a girl. She was not so fortunate the second time when she almost died in labour at the Luxembourg and provoked a public scandal, as underscored by Saint-Simon who then writes a short description of Berry's 1719 childbirth which has become the most-well known episode of her scandalous biography. According to Duclos, <b>this</b> <b>child</b> subsequently became a nun at the Abbey of Pontoise.|$|E
25|$|Because the {{necropolis}} of Sekhemkhet {{was never}} finished, {{it is hard}} to say which planned cultic building had already existed. The pyramid courtyard was surrounded by a niched enclosure wall facing north-west. It was 1.850ft long, 607ft wide and 33ft high. The only archaeologically preserved cultic building is the Southern Tomb, its base measurement is estimated to be 105ft x 52ft. The subterranean structure included a tight corridor, beginning at the western site of the tomb and ending in a double chamber. In this chamber in 1963 Jean-Philippe Lauer excavated the burial of a 2-years-old toddler. The identity of <b>this</b> <b>child</b> remains a mystery, the only for sure known fact about it is that it cannot be king Sekhemkhet himself, since the king was always depicted as a young man.|$|E
25|$|Genie's father disliked {{children}} and wanted {{none of his}} own, finding them noisy, but around five years into their marriage his wife became pregnant. <b>This</b> <b>child,</b> an apparently healthy daughter, caught pneumonia after her father found her cries disturbing and placed her in the garage, and {{died at the age}} of ten weeks. Their second child, born approximately a year later, was a boy diagnosed with Rh incompatibility who died at two days of age, either from complications of Rh incompatibility or from choking on his own mucus. Three years later they had another son, who doctors described as healthy despite also having Rh incompatibility. His father forced his wife to keep him quiet, causing significant physical and linguistic developmental delays. When he reached the age of four his maternal grandmother took over his care for several months, and he made good progress with her before she eventually returned him to his parents.|$|E
