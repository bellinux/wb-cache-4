5|$|Many tall palms are {{herbaceous}} monocots; {{these do}} not undergo secondary growth and never produce wood. In many tall palms, the <b>terminal</b> <b>bud</b> {{on the main}} stem {{is the only one}} to develop, so they have unbranched trunks with large spirally arranged leaves. Some of the tree ferns, order Cyatheales, have tall straight trunks, growing up to , but these are composed not of wood but of rhizomes which grow vertically and are covered by numerous adventitious roots.|$|E
5|$|Plucking: Tea {{leaves and}} flushes, which {{includes}} a <b>terminal</b> <b>bud</b> and two young leaves, are picked from Camellia sinensis bushes typically twice a year during early {{spring and early summer}} or late spring. Autumn or winter pickings of tea flushes are much less common, though they occur when climate permits. Picking is done by hand when a higher quality tea is needed, or where labour costs are not prohibitive. Depending on the skill of the picker, hand-picking is performed by pulling the flush with a snap of the forearm, arm, or even the shoulders, with the picker grasping the tea shoot using the thumb and forefinger, with the middle finger sometimes used in combination. Tea flushes and leaves can also be picked by machine, though there will be more broken leaves and partial flushes reducing the quality of the tea. However, it has also been shown that machine plucking in correctly timed harvesting periods can produce good leaves for the production of high quality teas.|$|E
5|$|The pale brown-skinned ovoid {{tunicate}} bulbs have a membranous {{tunic and}} a corky stem (base or basal) plate from which arise the adventitious root hairs {{in a ring}} around the edge, which grow up to 40mm in length. Above the stem plate is the storage organ consisting of bulb scales, surrounding the previous flower stalk and the <b>terminal</b> <b>bud.</b> The scales are of two types, true storage organs and the bases of the foliage leaves. These have a thicker tip and a scar from where the leaf lamina became detached. The innermost leaf scale is semicircular only partly enveloping the flower stalk (semisheathed).(see Hanks Fig 1.3). The bulb may contain a number of branched bulb units, each with two to three true scales and two to three leaf bases. Each bulb unit has a life of about four years.|$|E

500|$|The {{silver birch}} is a {{medium-sized}} deciduous tree, typically reaching [...] tall (exceptionally up to [...] ), with a slender trunk usually under [...] diameter. The bark {{on the trunk}} and branches is golden-brown at first, but later this turns to white {{as a result of}} papery tissue developing on the surface and peeling off in flakes, in a similar manner to the closely related Paper birch (B. papyrifera). The bark remains smooth until the tree gets quite large, but in older trees, the bark thickens, becoming irregular, dark and rugged. Young branches have whitish resin warts and the twigs are slender, hairless and often [...] The buds are small and sticky, and development is sympodial, that is to say the <b>terminal</b> <b>bud</b> dies away and growth continues from a lateral bud. The species is monoecious with male and female catkins found in the same tree. Some shoots are long and bear the male catkins at the tip, while others are short and bear female catkins. The immature male catkins are present during the winter but the female catkins develop in the spring, soon after the leaves unfurl.|$|E
2500|$|The tuber has all {{the parts}} of a normal stem, {{including}} nodes and internodes. [...] The nodes are the eyes and each has a leaf scar. [...] The nodes or eyes are arranged around the tuber in a spiral fashion beginning on the end opposite the attachment point to the stolon. The <b>terminal</b> <b>bud</b> is produced at the farthest point away from the stolon attachment and tubers thus show the same apical dominance as a normal stem. [...] Internally, a tuber is filled with starch stored in enlarged parenchyma like cells. The inside of a tuber has the typical cell structures of any stem, including a pith, vascular zones, and a cortex.|$|E
6000|$|It was {{surprising}} {{to see how}} much water was contained in the <b>terminal</b> <b>bud</b> of the sea-side golden-rod, standing in the sand early in July, and also how turnips, beets, carrots, etc., flourished even in pure sand. A man travelling by the shore near there not long before us noticed something green growing in the pure sand of the beach, just at high-water mark, and on approaching found it to be a bed of beets flourishing vigorously, probably from seed washed out of the Franklin. Also beets and turnips came up in the sea-weed used for manure {{in many parts of the}} Cape. This suggests how various plants may have been dispersed over the world to distant islands and continents. Vessels, with seeds in their cargoes, destined for particular ports, where perhaps they were not needed, have been cast away on desolate islands, and though their crews perished, some of their seeds have been preserved. Out of many kinds a few would find a soil and climate adapted to them, become naturalized, and perhaps drive out the native plants at last, and so fit the land for the habitation of man. It is an ill wind that blows nobody any good, and for the time lamentable shipwrecks may thus contribute a new vegetable to a continent's stock, and prove on the whole a lasting blessing to its inhabitants. Or winds and currents might effect the same without the intervention of man. What indeed are the various succulent plants which grow on the beach but such beds of beets and turnips, sprung originally from seeds which perhaps were cast on the waters for this end, though we do not know the Franklin which they came out of? In ancient times some Mr. Bell (?) was sailing this way in his ark with seeds of rocket, salt-wort, sandwort, beachgrass, samphire, bayberry, poverty-grass, etc., all nicely labelled with directions, intending to establish a nursery somewhere; and did not a nursery get established, though he thought that he had failed? ...|$|E

40|$|The <b>terminal</b> <b>buds</b> of Machilus {{seedings}} {{from the}} seeds {{collected in the}} Subtropical Zone (Iriomote,Okinawa,Amami) could not survive the winter, but the seedlings from the Temperate Zone (Kagoshima,Kochi,Mie,Chiba,Iwate,Aomori) grew up well without frost damage in Mie(Table 1). The <b>terminal</b> <b>buds</b> of Machilus seedlings grown in the Subtropical Zone were not induced into the dormacy requiring chilling for its release and had a relatively wide range of temperatures suitable for bud break(Table 4 and 5). So the <b>terminal</b> <b>buds</b> often sprout in the winter in Mie and then are killed by frost. On the other hand, the <b>terminal</b> <b>buds</b> of Macilus seedlings collected from the Temperate Zone could be induced into the dormancy requring chilling for its release(Table 4 and 5) and sprouted in spring without frost damage in Mie. This dormancy,however,could not be induced with short-days at the temperatures ranging from 18 to 28 â„ƒ(Fig. 5 - 8). The relationship between photoperiod and temperature seems {{to play an important}} role in inducing dormancy. And photoperiod seems to have a great effect on the growth patterns, that is, the relationship between leaf initiation and internode growth(Fig. 9) ...|$|R

50|$|Axillary buds do {{not become}} {{actively}} growing shoots on plants with strong apical dominance (the tendency to grow just the <b>terminal</b> <b>bud</b> on the main stem). Apical dominance occurs because the shoot apical meristem produces auxin which prevents axillary buds from growing. The axillary buds begin developing when {{they are exposed to}} less auxin, for example if the plant naturally has weak apical dominance, if apical dominance is broken by removing the <b>terminal</b> <b>bud,</b> or if the <b>terminal</b> <b>bud</b> has grown far enough away for the auxin to have less of an effect.|$|E
