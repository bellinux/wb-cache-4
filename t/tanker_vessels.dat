40|$|This paper investigates {{whether there}} are {{accident}} vessel damage cost differentials among container, <b>tanker</b> and bulk <b>vessels.</b> Tobit estimates of accident vessel damage cost equations suggest that vessel damage cost differentials exist for container versus bulk and <b>tanker</b> versus bulk <b>vessel</b> accidents, but not for container versus <b>tanker</b> <b>vessel</b> accidents. The vessel damage cost per vessel gross ton of a container (tanker) accident is $ 33. 37 ($ 18. 37) {{less than that of}} a bulk accident, all else held constant. The damage cost differentials are associated with fire/explosion accidents and human and environmental accident causes. The accident vessel damage cost differentials found in this paper may be compared with vessel hull insurance rates for investigating whether the latter reflect the former. Also, such comparisons may reveal whether there is cross-subsidisation among vessel hull insurance payees.

5000|$|... 2. Disincentives for fleet {{replacement}} and modernization: Since the Oil Pollution Act {{holds the}} vessel owners fully liable, {{it has created}} a disincentive for oil companies to transport crude oil in their vessels and for charterers to transport their oil on the most suitable vessels. Many financially successful oil companies select the highest quality of ships to transport their products, however, other companies continue to transport their product on the lower quality, older vessels due to the cheaper costs. The majority of charterers refuse {{to pay more for}} higher grade vessels despite the liability and compensation regulations enforced by OPA. The new and safer double hull <b>tanker</b> <b>vessels</b> are approximately 15-20% more costly to operate. In 1992, approximately 60% of global vessels was at least fifteen years old or older. The major oil companies are still delaying the fleet replacement requirement of retiring single hull vessels mandated by OPA. For example, Exxon and Texaco have delayed the replacement of their single hull vessels for new double hulled ships. However, companies like Chevron and Mobil have ordered two new double hull tankers. Leading by example, other independent shipping companies to invest in new double hull tankers as well. Despite the change from single to double <b>tanker</b> <b>vessels,</b> it is still not sufficient enough to accommodate the needs of the oil industry. It is expected that over the next decade there will be a serious lack of suitable tonnage to meet the expected demand for newer vessels. It is estimated that the global oil industry must invest approximately 200-350 billion dollars to meet global demands for new and environmentally sound vessels.|$|E

40|$|Application of pod {{propulsion}} on {{a variety}} of vessels such as cruise ships, ropax, and <b>tanker</b> <b>vessels</b> has increased significantly {{over the last two decades}} owing to the benefits offered by pods. Despite the clear benefits, operators are still reluctant to have this innovation on board because of unknown overall reliability. Many of the published research efforts in the area of pod propulsion have been concentrated on hydrodynamics and manoeuvring aspects with little in the area of quantitative pod reliability assessment. In this paper, the applicability and appropriateness of various quantitative fault tree solution techniques (exact and approximate) for the reliability assessment of a generic pod propulsion system are investigated. Also, the paper demonstrates that the proposed quantitative reliability assessment methodology can be used to make design changes by identifying critical components in system functionality and modifying the system with improvements, where needed...|$|E
