5|$|A 2006 study {{suggested}} that the correlation of tail length and body size in males, wing length in females, and lifespan for both sexes were signs of individual quality, and the wrens of high quality tend to mate with like individuals. The courting and antagonistic encounters <b>that</b> <b>involve</b> the tail fanning and wing drooping was suggested to be a possible signaling use. Age and life experience are not thought of as significant for potential mates due to their relatively short lifespan and sedentary lifestyle. Due to the large size of male wrens and the male's vigor in defending its territory, intrasexual selection was given as a {{possible explanation for the}} sexual dimorphism.|$|E
5|$|A {{common and}} popular {{structural}} alignment method is the DALI, or distance alignment matrix method, which breaks the input structures into hexapeptide fragments and calculates a distance matrix by evaluating the contact patterns between successive fragments. Secondary structure features <b>that</b> <b>involve</b> residues that are contiguous in sequence {{appear on the}} matrix's main diagonal; other diagonals in the matrix reflect spatial contacts between residues that are not near {{each other in the}} sequence. When these diagonals are parallel to the main diagonal, the features they represent are parallel; when they are perpendicular, their features are antiparallel. This representation is memory-intensive because the features in the square matrix are symmetrical (and thus redundant) about the main diagonal.|$|E
5|$|A {{preventative}} procedure (thoracotomy or thoracoscopy with pleurodesis) may be recommended {{after an}} episode of pneumothorax, with the intention to prevent recurrence. Evidence on the most effective treatment is still conflicting in some areas, and there is variation between treatments available in Europe and the US. Not all episodes of pneumothorax require such interventions; the decision depends largely on estimation {{of the risk of}} recurrence. These procedures are often recommended after the occurrence of a second pneumothorax. Surgery may need to be considered if someone has experienced pneumothorax on both sides ("bilateral"), sequential episodes <b>that</b> <b>involve</b> both sides, or if an episode was associated with pregnancy.|$|E

As {{part of the}} Conker video game series, the game follows the story of Conker the Squirrel, a greedy, heavy-drinking red squirrel who attempts to return home to his girlfriend Berri. The gameplay is composed of various challenges <b>that</b> <b>involve</b> platforming, solving puzzles, fighting enemies, and gathering objects. The game also features a multiplayer mode where a maximum of four players can compete in seven different game types.|$|E
5|$|Electronics {{deals with}} {{electrical}} circuits <b>that</b> <b>involve</b> active electrical components such as vacuum tubes, transistors, diodes, optoelectronics, sensors and integrated circuits, and associated passive interconnection technologies. The nonlinear behaviour of active components {{and their ability}} to control electron flows makes amplification of weak signals possible and electronics is widely used in information processing, telecommunications, and signal processing. The ability of electronic devices to act as switches makes digital information processing possible. Interconnection technologies such as circuit boards, electronics packaging technology, and other varied forms of communication infrastructure complete circuit functionality and transform the mixed components into a regular working system.|$|E

Major League Baseball teams have played the song at games involving the Toronto Blue Jays and the former Montreal Expos, and National Basketball Association teams do so for games involving the Toronto Raptors, and previously, the Vancouver Grizzlies.

5|$|Metabolism {{involves}} {{a vast array}} of chemical reactions, but most fall under a few basic types of reactions <b>that</b> <b>involve</b> the transfer of functional groups of atoms and their bonds within molecules. This common chemistry allows cells to use a small set of metabolic intermediates to carry chemical groups between different reactions. These group-transfer intermediates are called coenzymes. Each class of group-transfer reactions is carried out by a particular coenzyme, which is the substrate for a set of enzymes that produce it, and a set of enzymes that consume it. These coenzymes are therefore continuously made, consumed and then recycled.|$|E

The number of species of protists is unknown since only a small proportion has been identified. Protist diversity is high in oceans, deep sea-vents, river sediment and an acidic river, suggesting that many eukaryotic microbial communities may yet be discovered.|$|E
