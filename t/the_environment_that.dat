5|$|NASA {{announced}} in June 2012 that the probe was detecting changes in <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> <b>that</b> were suspected to correlate with {{arrival at the}} heliopause. Voyager 1 had reported a marked increase in its detection of charged particles from interstellar space, which are normally deflected by the solar winds within the heliosphere from the Sun. The craft thus began to enter the interstellar medium {{at the edge of}} the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of technology {{by the human}} race has allowed the greater exploitation {{of natural resources and}} has helped to alleviate some of the risk from natural hazards. In spite of this progress, however, the fate of human civilization remains closely linked to changes in the environment. There exists a highly complex feedback loop between the use of advanced technology and changes to <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> <b>that</b> are only slowly becoming understood. Man-made threats to the Earth's natural environment include pollution, deforestation, and disasters such as oil spills. Humans have contributed to the extinction of many plants and animals.|$|E
5|$|The {{front of}} the lahar {{contained}} boulders and cobbles which would have crushed anyone in their path, while the slower parts were dotted by fine, sharp stones which caused lacerations. Mud moved into open wounds and other open body parts – the eyes, ears, and mouth – and placed pressure capable of inducing traumatic asphyxia {{in one or two}} minutes upon people buried in it. Martí and Ernst state in their work Volcanoes and <b>the</b> <b>Environment</b> <b>that</b> they believe that many who survived the lahars succumbed to their injuries as they were trapped, or contracted hypothermia – though the latter is unlikely, given that survivors described the water as warm.|$|E

5|$|Within the verse, Coleridge {{seeks to}} {{discover}} <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> <b>that</b> {{his friends are}} exploring because {{he is unable to}} join them. The poem links the lime-tree bower to the Quantocks where the Wordsworths, Lamb and Fricker were out walking. Although he is separated from them, the poet connects to his distant friends and they are able to share in a common view on life. The poem describes Coleridge's loneliness and solitude throughout, yet he is glad that his friends are able to experience nature. Because of this, he is able to tolerate his prison, which he views as merely physical rather than intellectual.|$|E
5|$|Battles in {{the story}} take place on maps divided into a square-based grid. Battle actions are governed by a turn-based system where each unit on both sides is given their chance to move and act. During gameplay, weather and terrain effects appear such as fog of war or {{elements}} of <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> <b>that</b> can be manipulated to one side's advantage, affecting the progress of battle. Units are split between player, enemy and allied non-player character (NPC) units. Each unit's movement range and attack range is displayed when selected. The player must clear a map to advance the story: the objectives for clearing a level can vary from defeating all enemies to capturing strongholds or rescuing NPCs. When engaging a unit, the scene transitions into a battle between the player and enemy unit, with battle animation playing out. When hit with an attack, a character loses health points (HP). For player characters, HP can be restored with items or by units with healing magic; {{it can also be}} regained by standing on forts, gates or castles, or using a special spell that replenishes health based on damage dealt to an enemy.|$|E
5|$|Before the Columbine High School massacre, {{perpetrator}} Dylan Klebold referenced lyrics from Nine Inch Nails songs {{multiple times}} in his journal. Klebold heavily identified with the protagonist of The Downward Spiral {{as a symbol of}} his own depression. On May 4, 1999, a hearing on the marketing and distribution practices of violent content to minors by the television, music, film, and video game industries was conducted before the United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation. The committee heard testimony from cultural observers, professors, and mental health professionals, that included conservative William Bennett and the Archbishop of Denver, Reverend Charles J. Chaput. Participants criticized the album, Nine Inch Nails' label-mate Marilyn Manson, and the 1999 film The Matrix for their alleged contribution to <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> <b>that</b> made tragedies like Columbine possible. The committee requested that the Federal Trade Commission and the United States Department of Justice investigate the entertainment industry's marketing practices to minors.|$|E

5|$|In December 1982 Jarrell was {{commissioned}} by Westinghouse Electric Company to create a three-hundred-foot mural in their Athens headquarters, to boost {{the morale of the}} employees. The mural {{was the first time he}} used a bricklayer's trowel in his work, a tool introduced to him by Adger Cowans. The Apple Birds and The Return of the Apple Birds, from 1983, show his dramatic use of the trowel. The paintings were inspired by a drawing by his daughter, Jennifer, at the age of two. The Apple Birds were drawn by and talked about by Jennifer as having apple-shaped heads with stems at the top, long arms and short bodies. Zigzags, geometric shapes and layers make up <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> <b>that</b> the Apple Birds live in on the canvas. The trowel is used throughout to create 3-D layers and overlaps.|$|E
5|$|Star Cops is a British {{science fiction}} {{television}} series first broadcast on BBC2 in 1987. It was devised by Chris Boucher, {{a writer who}} had previously worked on the science fiction television series Doctor Who and Blake's 7 as well as crime dramas such as Juliet Bravo and Bergerac. Set in the year 2027, a time where Interplanetary travel has become commonplace, it starred David Calder as Nathan Spring, commander of the International Space Police Force—nicknamed the “Star Cops"—who provide law enforcement for the newly developing colonies of the Solar System. The series follows Nathan Spring {{and the rest of}} his multinational team as they work to establish the Star Cops and solve whatever crimes come their way. Operating in a relatively accurately realised hard SF, near-future, space environment, many of the cases that the Star Cops investigate arise from opportunities for new crimes presented by the technologically advanced future society the series depicts and from the hostile frontier nature of <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> <b>that</b> the Star Cops live in.|$|E
5|$|The Nigerian {{government}} has commissioned the overseas production and launch of four satellites. The Nigeriasat-1 {{was the first}} satellite to be built under the Nigerian government sponsorship. The satellite was launched from Russia on 27 September 2003. Nigeriasat-1 {{was part of the}} worldwide Disaster Monitoring Constellation System. The primary objectives of the Nigeriasat-1 were: to give early warning signals of environmental disaster; to help detect and control desertification {{in the northern part of}} Nigeria; to assist in demographic planning; to establish the relationship between malaria vectors and <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> <b>that</b> breeds malaria and to give early warning signals on future outbreaks of meningitis using remote sensing technology; to provide the technology needed to bring education to all parts of the country through distant learning; and to aid in conflict resolution and border disputes by mapping out state and International borders.|$|E
