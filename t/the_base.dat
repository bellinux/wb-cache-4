5|$|During the 1970s, the {{population}} of <b>the</b> <b>base</b> declined due to the possible closure of <b>the</b> <b>base</b> and the draw down in personnel from the Vietnam War.

50|$|A {{baseball}} field can {{be referred to}} as a diamond. The infield is a rigidly structured diamond of dirt containing <b>the</b> three <b>bases,</b> home plate, and the pitchers mound.

Some ballparks, like Toronto's Rogers Centre, have grass or artificial turf between <b>the</b> <b>bases,</b> and dirt only around <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> and pitcher's mound.

The General Services Administration (GSA) wanted to sell <b>the</b> <b>base</b> {{to the town of}} Wendover, leaving only the bombing ranges and radar site with the Air Force. <b>The</b> <b>base</b> was renamed Decker Field, and again declared surplus in 1972. <b>The</b> <b>base</b> continued to be used occasionally for training by Air National Guard units, and the firefighting detachment remained until 1977.|$|E

5|$|After welding, {{a number}} of {{distinct}} regions can be identified in the weld area. The weld itself is called the fusion zone—more specifically, it is where the filler metal was laid during the welding process.

It is surrounded by the heat-affected zone, the area that had its microstructure and properties altered by the weld. These properties depend on <b>the</b> <b>base</b> material's behavior when subjected to heat.
