5|$|In {{ancient times}} the signs corresponded roughly to 12 of <b>the</b> <b>constellations</b> that {{straddle}} the ecliptic.|$|E
5|$|In 1756, French {{astronomer}} Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille {{introduced the}} constellation of Circinus with the French name le Compas, representing a pair of dividing compasses, on a chart of the southern sky. On that chart, Lacaille portrayed <b>the</b> <b>constellations</b> of Norma, Circinus, and Triangulum Australe, respectively, as a set square and ruler, a compass, and a surveyor's level {{in a set of}} draughtsman's instruments. Circinus was given its current name in 1763, when Lacaille published an updated sky map with Latin names for <b>the</b> <b>constellations</b> he introduced.|$|E
5|$|Andromeda is also {{associated}} with the Mesopotamian creation story of Tiamat, the goddess of Chaos. She bore many demons for her husband, Apsu, but eventually decided to destroy them in a war that ended when Marduk killed her. He used her body to create <b>the</b> <b>constellations</b> as markers of time for humans.|$|E
50|$|Moreover, {{a careful}} design of <b>the</b> <b>constellation</b> {{geometry}} enables {{to approach the}} Gaussian capacity when <b>the</b> <b>constellation</b> size grows to infinity. For <b>the</b> regular QAM <b>constellations,</b> a gap of 1.56 dB is observed. The previous solution, where <b>the</b> <b>constellation</b> has a Gaussian shape, is called constellation shaping.|$|R
50|$|When {{the sun is}} in {{the sign}} of Scorpio, <b>the</b> <b>constellation</b> Hercules rises. <b>The</b> Greeks {{referred}} to <b>the</b> <b>constellation</b> of Hercules as the Stag (hind is another word for doe), the identification of <b>the</b> <b>constellation</b> with Hercules {{was made by the}} Romans.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: <b>The</b> <b>constellation</b> Taurus {{as it can}} be seen by {{the naked}} eye. <b>The</b> <b>constellation</b> lines have been added for clarity.|$|R
5|$|Perseus rescued Andromeda {{from the}} monster by killing {{it with his}} diamond sword. He turned Polydectes and his {{followers}} to stone with Medusa's head and appointed Dictys the fisherman king. Perseus and Andromeda married and had six children. In the sky, Perseus lies near <b>the</b> <b>constellations</b> Andromeda, Cepheus, Cassiopeia (Andromeda's mother), Cetus, and Pegasus.|$|E
5|$|The planet Jupiter {{has been}} known since ancient times. It is {{visible to the naked}} eye in the night sky and can {{occasionally}} be seen in the daytime when the Sun is low. To the Babylonians, this object represented their god Marduk. They used Jupiter's roughly 12-year orbit along the ecliptic to define <b>the</b> <b>constellations</b> of their zodiac.|$|E
5|$|The roof bosses in the cloisters display many astrological {{references}} including <b>the</b> <b>constellations</b> Cygnus (the Swan), Vulpecula and Anser (Fox and Goose), Sagittarius (the Archer), the Man in the Moon, Draco (the Dragon), Canis Major (Sirius the Dog Star), Capricornus (the Sea Goat), Columba (the Dove), Noctua (the Owl), Aquila (the Eagle), Leo (the Lion) and Virgo (the Angel).|$|E
40|$|This {{poster for}} the Natural Sciences Poster Session at Parkland College {{features}} <b>the</b> <b>constellation</b> Gemini, identifying prominent stars in <b>the</b> <b>constellation</b> and objects {{within the region}} (nebulae, clusters, galaxies), calculating the lifespans of the stars in <b>the</b> <b>constellation,</b> calculating average rise time change, and briefly touching on the associated mythology...|$|R
50|$|Royer {{is often}} named as {{the creator of}} <b>the</b> <b>constellation</b> Columba (<b>the</b> Dove) by {{splitting}} off part of <b>the</b> <b>constellation</b> Canis Major, and <b>the</b> <b>constellation</b> Crux (<b>the</b> Southern Cross) with stars from Centaurus but these were in fact already formed (and depicted) in 1589 and in 1592 by Petrus Plancius.|$|R
50|$|The {{algorithm}} is effective because it imposes much less constellational rigidity <b>the</b> way <b>the</b> <b>constellation</b> model does. Admittedly <b>the</b> <b>constellation</b> {{model can be}} modified to allow for occlusions and other large abnormalities but this model is naturally suited to it. Also {{it must be said}} that sometimes the more rigid structure of <b>the</b> <b>constellation</b> is desired.|$|R
5|$|Another {{narrative}} on <b>the</b> <b>constellations,</b> three paragraphs long, {{is from a}} Latin writer whose brief notes {{have come}} down to us {{under the name of}} Hyginus. It begins with the oxhide story of Orion's birth, which this source ascribes to Callimachus and Aristomachus, and sets the location at Thebes or Chios. Hyginus has two versions. In one of them he omits Poseidon; a modern critic suggests this is the original version.|$|E
5|$|Later, the 17th-century German {{celestial}} cartographer Johann Bayer {{called the}} constellation Triplicitas and Orbis terrarum tripertitus, {{for the three}} regions Europe, Asia, and Africa. Triangulus Septentrionalis was a name used to distinguish it from Triangulum Australe, the Southern Triangle. Polish astronomer Johannes Hevelius excised three faint stars—6, 10 and 12 Trianguli—to form the new constellation of Triangulum Minus in his 1690 Firmamentum Sobiescianum, renaming the original as Triangulum Majus. The smaller constellation was not recognised by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) when <b>the</b> <b>constellations</b> were established in the 1920s.|$|E
5|$|Molyneux's {{celestial}} globe was virtually {{a copy of}} Gerardus Mercator's globe of 1551, which itself {{was based on a}} globe of 1537 by Gemma Frisius that Mercator had helped to construct. To <b>the</b> <b>constellations</b> featured on Mercator's globe, Molyneux added the Southern Cross and Southern Triangle, though somewhat to the west of their true positions. His source appears to have been Andrea Corsali's diagram of the Antarctic sky published in 1550.|$|E
5000|$|Gamma Gruis (Gamma Gru, γ Gruis, γ Gru) {{is a star}} in <b>the</b> {{southern}} <b>constellation</b> of Grus. It {{is known}} as Al Dhanab, [...] "the Tail (of <b>the</b> <b>constellation</b> of <b>the</b> Southern Fish)" [...] and once belonged to <b>the</b> Ptolemaic <b>constellation</b> Piscis Austrinus. With an apparent visual magnitude of 3.0, it is the third-brightest star in <b>the</b> <b>constellation.</b>|$|R
50|$|Omicron1 Canis Majoris (ο1 CMa, ο1 Canis Majoris) {{is a red}} {{supergiant star}} in <b>the</b> <b>constellation</b> Canis Major. It is a {{variable}} star in <b>the</b> <b>constellation</b> of Canis Major.|$|R
25|$|Part of <b>the</b> <b>constellation</b> was hived off to form <b>the</b> <b>constellation</b> Sciurus Volans, <b>the</b> Flying Squirrel, by William Croswell in 1810. However {{this was}} not taken up by later cartographers.|$|R
5|$|Nicolas Louis de Lacaille portrayed <b>the</b> <b>constellations</b> of Norma, Circinus and Triangulum Australe as a {{set square}} and ruler, a compass, and a surveyor's level {{respectively}} {{in a set of}} draughtsman's instruments in his 1756 map of the southern stars. Also depicting it as a surveyor's level, German Johann Bode gave it the alternate name of Libella in his Uranographia.|$|E
5|$|The first star {{catalogue}} in Greek astronomy {{was created by}} Aristillus in approximately 300 BC, {{with the help of}} Timocharis. The star catalog of Hipparchus (2nd century BC) included 1020 stars, and was used to assemble Ptolemy's {{star catalogue}}. Hipparchus is known for the discovery of the first recorded nova (new star). Many of <b>the</b> <b>constellations</b> and star names in use today derive from Greek astronomy.|$|E
5|$|The use of polyhedra {{to model}} heavenly bodies {{can be traced}} back to Plato, who in the Timaeus {{identified}} the regular dodecahedron with the shape of the heavens and its twelve faces with <b>the</b> <b>constellations</b> of the zodiac. Later, Johannes Kepler theorized that the distribution of distances of the planets from the sun could be explained by the shapes of the five Platonic solids, nested within each other. Escher kept a model of this system of nested polyhedra, and regularly depicted polyhedra in his artworks relating to astronomy and other worlds.|$|E
50|$|Although the Small Magellanic Cloud lies mostly within <b>the</b> <b>constellation</b> Tucana, <b>the</b> wing extends into Hydrus. The NGC 602 region, {{including}} AB8, {{lies within}} {{the borders of}} <b>the</b> <b>constellation</b> Hydrus.|$|R
50|$|Part of <b>the</b> <b>constellation</b> was hived off to form <b>the</b> <b>constellation</b> Sciurus Volans, <b>the</b> Flying Squirrel, by William Croswell in 1810. However {{this was}} not taken up by later cartographers.|$|R
5000|$|T Ursae Minoris (T UMi) {{is a star}} in <b>the</b> <b>constellation</b> Ursa Minor, located 2'30" [...] westsouthwest of 3 Ursae Minoris {{toward the}} western border of <b>the</b> <b>constellation</b> with Draco.|$|R
5|$|There is {{also much}} {{information}} about how the universe was thought to work stored in the mythology of <b>the</b> <b>constellations.</b> The Barasana of the Amazon plan part of their annual cycle based on observation of the stars. When their constellation of the Caterpillar-Jaguar (roughly equivalent to the modern Scorpius) falls they prepare to catch the pupating caterpillars of the forest as they fall from the trees. The caterpillars provide food at a season when other foods are scarce.|$|E
5|$|Astrology, in its {{broadest}} sense, is {{the search}} for meaning in the sky. Early evidence for humans making conscious attempts to measure, record, and predict seasonal changes by reference to astronomical cycles, appears as markings on bones and cave walls, which show that lunar cycles were being noted as early as 25,000 years ago. This was a first step towards recording the Moon's influence upon tides and rivers, and towards organising a communal calendar. Farmers addressed agricultural needs with increasing knowledge of <b>the</b> <b>constellations</b> that appear in the different seasons—and used the rising of particular star-groups to herald annual floods or seasonal activities. By the 3rd millennium BCE, civilisations had sophisticated awareness of celestial cycles, and may have oriented temples in alignment with heliacal risings of the stars.|$|E
5|$|In {{some ancient}} atlases, <b>the</b> <b>constellations</b> Serpens and Ophiuchus were {{depicted}} as two separate constellations, although more often they were shown {{as a single}} constellation. One notable figure to depict Serpens separately was Johann Bayer; thus, Serpens' stars are cataloged with separate Bayer designations from those of Ophiuchus. When Eugène Delporte established modern constellation boundaries in the 1920s, he elected to depict the two separately. However, this posed {{the problem of how}} to disentangle the two constellations, with Deporte deciding to split Serpens into two areas—the head and the tail—separated by the continuous Ophiuchus. These two areas became known as Serpens Caput and Serpens Cauda, caput being the Latin word for head and cauda the Latin word for tail.|$|E
5000|$|Epsilon Volantis (ε Vol, ε Volantis) is a quadruple {{star system}} in <b>the</b> {{southern}} <b>constellation</b> Volans. This star {{is at the}} center of <b>the</b> <b>constellation</b> of Volans and connects the [...] "wings" [...] of <b>the</b> <b>constellation.</b> Based upon parallax measurements, is roughly 560 light years from Earth.|$|R
50|$|The {{company name}} was changed, {{a few months}} later, to Volantis Systems Ltd. - the taking its name from <b>the</b> <b>constellation</b> Volans. <b>The</b> company’s logo is a {{representation}} of <b>the</b> <b>constellation.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Constellation</b> Plaza {{helps to}} trace <b>the</b> <b>constellation</b> during <b>the</b> evenings. The Sundial Plaza at the seafront facing the Promenade is {{installed}} {{for the young}} {{to learn how to}} tell time.|$|R
5|$|Kepler-8b is {{the fifth}} of the first five exoplanets {{discovered}} by NASA's Kepler spacecraft, which aims to discover planets in a region of the sky between <b>the</b> <b>constellations</b> Lyra and Cygnus that transit (cross in front of) their host stars. The planet is the hottest of the five. Kepler-8b was the only planet discovered in Kepler-8's orbit, and is larger (though more diffuse) than Jupiter. It orbits its host star every 3.5 days. The planet also demonstrates the Rossiter–McLaughlin effect, where the planet's orbit affects the redshifting of the spectrum of the host star. Kepler-8b was announced to the public on January 4, 2010 {{at a conference in}} Washington, D.C. after radial velocity measurements conducted at the W.M. Keck Observatory confirmed its detection by Kepler.|$|E
5|$|The {{supernova}} {{explosion that}} formed the Vela Supernova Remnant most likely occurred 10,000–20,000 years ago. In 1976, NASA astronomers suggested that inhabitants of the southern hemisphere may have witnessed this explosion and recorded it symbolically. A year later, archaeologist George Michanowsky recalled some incomprehensible ancient markings in Bolivia that were left by Native Americans. The carvings showed four small circles flanked by two larger circles. The smaller circles resemble stellar groupings in <b>the</b> <b>constellations</b> Vela and Carina. One of the larger circles may represent the star Capella. Another circle is located near {{the position of the}} supernova remnant, George Michanowsky suggested this may represent the supernova explosion as witnessed by the indigenous residents.|$|E
5|$|As {{with all}} exoplanets, Kepler-11d is named first for its host star, Kepler-11. Because Kepler-11d was {{announced}} {{at the same time}} as the five other planets in the system, their names are sorted by their distances from the host star; thus, because Kepler-11d is the third planet from Kepler-11, it was given the designation d. Kepler-11 was named for the Kepler spacecraft, a NASA Earth-trailing satellite purposed with discovering Earth-like planets in a small area of the sky between <b>the</b> <b>constellations</b> Cygnus and Lyra by observing planets that transit, or cross in front of, their host stars with respect to Earth. The transit causes the star's brightness to dim slightly and at a regular rate, a phenomenon that the Kepler satellite notes till future study can prove or disprove the existence of a planetary body. Kepler-11d was flagged by Kepler-11, given the designation KOI-157.|$|E
5000|$|In addition, the Alien tells Jadna {{that he has}} {{constructed}} {{some ancient}} cities near Denebola in <b>the</b> <b>Constellation</b> of Leo and a Chinese period near Zuben-Al-Akrab which is in <b>the</b> <b>Constellation</b> of Libra.|$|R
5000|$|In {{previous}} sections we saw how various overlays (scale degrees, semi-tone numbering, notes) {{can be used}} to notate {{the circumference}} of <b>the</b> <b>constellation.</b> Various other overlays can be laid around <b>the</b> <b>constellation.</b> For example: ...|$|R
5000|$|Two {{diagrams}} of circular QAM constellation are shown, for 8-QAM and 16-QAM. <b>The</b> circular 8-QAM <b>constellation</b> {{is known}} to be <b>the</b> optimal 8-QAM <b>constellation</b> in <b>the</b> sense of requiring the least mean power for a given minimum Euclidean distance. <b>The</b> 16-QAM <b>constellation</b> is suboptimal although the optimal one may be constructed along the same lines as <b>the</b> 8-QAM <b>constellation.</b> <b>The</b> circular <b>constellation</b> highlights <b>the</b> relationship between QAM and PSK. Other orders of constellation may be constructed along similar (or very different) lines. It is consequently hard to establish expressions for the error rates of non-rectangular QAM since it necessarily depends on <b>the</b> <b>constellation.</b> Nevertheless, an obvious upper bound to the rate is related to the minimum Euclidean distance of <b>the</b> <b>constellation</b> (<b>the</b> shortest straight-line distance between two points): ...|$|R
