5|$|After {{some members}} of the Virginia Tech panel complained about the missing paper, Virginia Tech decided to release a copy of the paper <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>panel</b> during {{the latter part of the}} week of August 25, 2007. Although the Virginia Tech panel has since {{received}} the paper written by Cho for the fiction writing class, the precise contents of that paper have not been released to the public.|$|E
5|$|From 1987 through 1994 {{the award}} was given {{out by a}} panel of science fiction experts led by Orson Scott Card. Beginning in 1995, the {{committee}} was replaced by a group of jurors, who vote on the nominations submitted for consideration. The initial jurors were James Gunn, Frederik Pohl, and Judith Merril. Merril was replaced on the jury by former winner Kij Johnson in 1997, one of Sturgeon's children—Noel Sturgeon in most years—was added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>panel</b> in 1999, and George Zebrowski was added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>panel</b> in 2005. Nominations are submitted by reviewers, fans, publishers, and editors, and are collated by the current Director of the Center for the Study of Science Fiction, Christopher McKitterick, into a list of finalists to be voted on by the jury. The maximum eligible length that a work may be is not formally defined by the center. The winner is selected by May of each year, and is presented at the Campbell Conference awards banquet in June at the University of Kansas in Lawrence, as part of the centerpiece of the conference along with the Campbell Award. Winners are always invited to attend the ceremony. Since 2004 winners have received a personalized trophy, while since the inception of the award a permanent trophy has recorded all of the winners.|$|E

50|$|In 2006, R&R moved WMBX from <b>the</b> Rhythmic <b>panel</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Urban <b>panel,</b> but in May 2007, R&R moved <b>the</b> station back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Rhythmic <b>panel</b> due <b>to</b> a {{shift in}} its {{direction}} which now favors a broader Rhythmic playlist.|$|R
5|$|Mulder finds Arlinsky and Babcock dead, {{with the}} alien body missing. Mulder, distraught, {{sits in his}} {{apartment}} watching a conference about extraterrestrial life on television. The narrative returns to the present, where Scully reveals <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>panel</b> that Mulder died the previous night of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.|$|E
5|$|When {{information}} surfaced {{about the}} paper, the Virginia Tech panel learned {{at that time}} that only the Virginia State Police and Virginia Tech had copies of the unreleased paper in their possession. The Virginia State Police reported that, although it had a copy of the paper, Virginia law prevented them from releasing the paper <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>panel</b> because {{it was part of the}} investigative file in an ongoing investigation.|$|E
5|$|The {{investigation}} panel {{had sought}} Cho's medical records for several weeks, {{but due to}} privacy laws, Virginia Tech was prohibited from releasing them without permission from Cho's family, even after his death. The panel had considered using subpoenas to obtain his records. On June 12, 2007, Cho's family released his medical records <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>panel,</b> although the panel said that the records were not enough. The panel obtained additional information by court order. Like the perpetrators of both the Columbine and Jokela school massacres, Cho was prescribed the antidepressant drug Prozac prior to his rampage, a substance suspected by Peter Breggin and David Healy of leading to suicidal behaviors. It is not known if Cho ever complied in filling or taking this prescription; or if he had taken and then discontinued the prescribed medication. The toxicology test from the official autopsy later showed that neither psychiatric nor any kind of illegal drugs were in his system {{during the time of}} the shooting.|$|E

50|$|Although {{spacecraft}} {{are protected}} by Whipple shields, solar panels, which are exposed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Sun, wear from low-mass impacts. These produce a cloud of plasma which is an electrical risk <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>panels.</b>|$|R

5|$|Most puzzles {{are located}} on {{recognizable}} eye-level panels scattered around the island, often connected with power cables that light up once a puzzle is solved and guiding the player to the next puzzle. Some puzzles incorporate the game's architecture, such as one that requires the player to view background elements through a semi-transparent puzzle panel to determine the solution. There are also non-obvious puzzles built into the environment itself, requiring the player to find the correct vantage point to complete the puzzle. At any time, the player can engage the maze-drawing mode, which {{is marked by a}} white border on screen. While in this mode, the player's avatar is prevented from moving and instead allows the player to use their controls to trace the path through a presented maze. The mode ends once the player solves the puzzle or cancels the mode. Normally, this mode is activated in front of a panel, moving the player's view directly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>panel</b> to solve it, {{but it can also be}} activated at any other time to engage those puzzles that are based on vantage points. Nearly all puzzles provide immediate feedback if they have been solved correctly or not through sound effects or visual indication.|$|E

50|$|Controllers {{provide an}} overrun time to extract {{some of the}} heat energy left in {{interconnecting}} pipes after <b>the</b> <b>panels</b> cool off. They may also implement certain safety features such as cooling the store when it exceeds a preset temperature such as 65 °C, by sending excess heat back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>panels</b> <b>to</b> be given off <b>to</b> <b>the</b> environment.|$|R
25|$|Later systems {{maintained}} {{compatibility with}} revertive pulsing, even as more advanced signaling methods were developed.
