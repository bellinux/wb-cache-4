5|$|The {{potential}} {{changes from}} extraterrestrial contact could vary greatly in magnitude and <b>type,</b> <b>based</b> on the extraterrestrial civilization's level of technological advancement, degree of benevolence or malevolence, {{and level of}} mutual comprehension between itself and humanity. The medium through which humanity is contacted, be it electromagnetic radiation, direct physical interaction, extraterrestrial artefact, or otherwise, may also influence the results of contact. Incorporating these factors, various systems have been created to assess the implications of extraterrestrial contact.|$|E

This invention gradually made books less expensive to produce, and more widely available.|$|E

25|$|Ecotype, ecotope, or biotope aquaria {{is another}} <b>type</b> <b>based</b> on species selection.

These biotope aquaria {{are the most}} sophisticated hobby aquaria; public aquaria use this approach whenever possible. This approach best simulates the experience of observing in the wild. It typically serves as the healthiest possible artificial environment for the tank's occupants.|$|E
25|$|Around 1450, Johannes Gutenberg {{introduced}} the first movable type printing system in Europe. He advanced innovations in casting <b>type</b> <b>based</b> on a matrix and hand mould, adaptations to the screw-press, {{the use of}} an oil-based ink, {{and the creation of a}} softer and more absorbent paper. Gutenberg was the first to create his type pieces from an alloy of lead, tin, antimony, copper and bismuth – the same components still used today. Johannes Gutenberg started work on his printing press around 1436, in partnership with Andreas Dritzehen – whom he had previously instructed in gem-cutting – and Andreas Heilmann, the owner of a paper mill.|$|E
25|$|The {{legions of}} the late Republic and early Empire are often called Marian legions. Following the Battle of Vercellae in 101 BC, Marius granted all Italian {{soldiers}} Roman citizenship. He justified this action to the Senate by saying that in the din of battle he could not distinguish Roman from ally. This effectively eliminated the notion of allied legions; henceforth all Italian legions would be regarded as Roman legions, and full Roman citizenship was open to all the regions of Italy. At the same time, the three different types of heavy infantry were replaced by a single, standard <b>type</b> <b>based</b> on the Principes: armed with two heavy javelins called pila (singular pilum), the short sword called gladius, chain mail (lorica hamata), helmet and rectangular shield (scutum).|$|E

500|$|In 2002, Bjarne Stroustrup {{suggested}} {{extending the}} C++ language with mechanisms for querying {{the type of}} an expression, and initializing objects without specifying the type. Stroustrup observed that the reference-dropping semantics offered by the typeof operator provided by the GCC and EDG compilers could be problematic. Conversely, an operator returning a reference <b>type</b> <b>based</b> on the lvalue-ness of the expression was deemed too confusing. The initial proposal to the C++ standards committee outlined {{a combination of the}} two variants; the operator would return a reference type only if the declared type of the expression included a reference. To emphasize that the deduced type would reflect the [...] "declared type" [...] of the expression, the operator was proposed to be named decltype.|$|E
500|$|According to Luttwak, Roman forts of the 1st/2nd centuries, whether castra legionaria (inaccurately {{translated}} as legionary [...] "fortresses") or auxiliary forts, were clearly residential bases {{that were not}} designed to withstand assault. The typical rectangular [...] "playing-card" [...] shape, the long, thin and low walls and shallow ditch and the unfortified gates were not defensible features and their purpose was delimitation and keeping out individual intruders. This view is too extreme, as all {{the evidence suggests that}} such forts, even the more rudimentary earlier <b>type</b> <b>based</b> on the design of marching-camps (ditch, earth rampart and wooden palisade), afforded a significant level of protection. The latter is exemplified by the siege of the legionary camp at Castra Vetera (Xanten) during the revolt of the Batavi in 69–70 AD. 5,000 legionaries succeeded in holding out for several months against vastly superior numbers of rebel Batavi and their allies under the renegade auxiliary officer Civilis, despite the latter disposing of c. 8,000 Roman-trained and equipped auxiliary troops and deploying Roman-style siege engines. (The Romans were eventually forced to surrender the fort by starvation).|$|E

2500|$|Singers and {{the roles}} they play are {{classified}} by voice <b>type,</b> <b>based</b> on the tessitura, agility, power and timbre of their voices. Male singers {{can be classified}} by vocal range as bass, bass-baritone, baritone, tenor and countertenor, and female singers as contralto, mezzo-soprano and soprano. (Men sometimes sing in the [...] "female" [...] vocal ranges, in which case they are termed sopranist or countertenor. The countertenor is commonly encountered in opera, sometimes singing parts written for castrati—men neutered {{at a young age}} specifically to give them a higher singing range.) Singers are then further classified by size—for instance, a soprano can be described as a lyric soprano, coloratura, soubrette, spinto, or dramatic soprano. These terms, although not fully describing a singing voice, associate the singer's voice with the roles most suitable to the singer's vocal characteristics.|$|E
