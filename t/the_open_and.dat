Leaving Company F at the scene, Carlson returned to Binu with Company C, arriving at 22:00. Company E arrived at Binu about the same time and reported that they had caught a Japanese company crossing a river in <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>and</b> killed many of them before withdrawing. Carlson then took Company B and returned to the area that Company F was guarding, arriving at daybreak on 12 November.

5|$|Grey reef sharks feed {{mainly on}} bony fishes, with {{cephalopods}} such as squid and octopus being the second-most important food group, and crustaceans such as crabs and lobsters {{making up the}} remainder. The larger sharks take {{a greater proportion of}} cephalopods. These sharks hunt individually or in groups, and have been known to pin schools of fish against the outer walls of coral reefs for feeding. They excel at capturing fish swimming in <b>the</b> <b>open,</b> <b>and</b> they complement hunting whitetip reef sharks, which are more adept at capturing fish inside caves and crevices. Their sense of smell is extremely acute, being capable of detecting one part tuna extract in 10 billion parts of sea water. In the presence of a large quantity of food, grey reef sharks may be roused into a feeding frenzy; in one documented frenzy caused by an underwater explosion that killed several snappers, one of the sharks involved was attacked and consumed by the others.|$|E

5|$|North Korean troops {{continued}} {{attacking the}} 24th Infantry all across its line, probing for weaknesses. On August 25 and 26, C Company beat off several more North Korean attacks on Battle Mountain coming along the long ridge extending from Tundok. At {{one point in}} these fights, a flight of US Air Force aircraft caught about 100 North Korean soldiers in <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>and</b> immediately napalmed, bombed, and strafed them. The North Korean force was destroyed with few survivors. Task Force Baker, comprising C Company and a platoon of E Company, 24th Infantry with an ROK police company, defended Battle Mountain at this time. The special command was established because of the isolated Battle Mountain area and the extended regimental battle front. For the next two days, air strikes continued to rack North Korean counterattacks and {{to prevent them from}} forming into any serious attack on Battle Mountain.|$|E

5|$|The 1st Battalion harassed the {{constantly}} moving German flying column during August and September 1917. Two Military Medals were won by RNR soldiers {{during this}} time: Sergeant Northcote rescued a wounded askari under German fire in late August, {{and a few}} days later Corporal Suga, himself lightly injured, dragged his wounded commanding officer Lieutenant Booth out of <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>and</b> into cover. The 2nd Battalion, comprising Major Jackson at the head of 585 askaris and 75 whites, left Salisbury on 16 September 1917, and joined the front on 16 October, when it arrived at Mbewa on the north-eastern shore of Lake Nyasa, intending to ultimately merge with 1RNR. After 1RNR spent two months garrisoning Wiedhaven and 2RNR underwent further training, the two forces joined on 28 January 1918 (becoming known as the 2nd Rhodesia Native Regiment), and immediately made their way south in pursuit of Lettow-Vorbeck's Germans, who were by now down to an effective strength of less than 2,000, and moving through Portuguese Mozambique.|$|E

5|$|The Bourbon Spanish and French land force {{continued}} to bombard Gibraltar, inflicting further {{damage on the}} town's somewhat weak fortifications but were unable to make any progress against the reinforced garrison. They were being vigorously opposed with counter-bombardments, which killed many of their number, and by sallies, two of which were carried out successfully by the confederates on 23 and 31 December. Relations steadily worsened between the Spanish and French components of the besieging force, a trend that was exacerbated {{by the lack of}} progress they were making, the appalling conditions they were enduring in <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>and</b> the steady stream of casualties being caused by the counter-bombardment and outbreaks of epidemic disease. The weather, too, was terrible, with storms and heavy rain making life a misery. By the New Year of 1705, the besieging force was disintegrating and had dropped in numbers from around 7,000 men to only 4,000, the remainder having either become casualties or simply deserting.|$|E
5|$|The Germans, who {{had left}} Songea {{only a few weeks}} before, sent two columns to retake it during early November 1916—250 askaris marched from Likuyu, and 180 more (with two machine guns) set off from Kitanda. The latter German column spotted the RNR company that was patrolling the road, and at Mabogoro {{attacked}} the advance guard, which was commanded by Sergeant (later Lieutenant) Frederick Charles Booth. The Rhodesians were caught by surprise, and many panicked, running about and firing randomly. Booth restored discipline and led the defence until reinforcements arrived. The Germans then retreated and continued towards Songea. During this contact, Booth advanced towards enemy fire to rescue a wounded scout who was lying in <b>the</b> <b>open,</b> <b>and</b> brought him back alive; for this and subsequent actions, Booth received the Victoria Cross in June 1917.|$|E

5|$|The {{commander}} of the British Expeditionary Force, Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, already had plans in place for an attack near Amiens. When the British retreat had ended in April, {{the headquarters of the}} British Fourth Army under General Sir Henry Rawlinson had taken over the front astride the Somme. Its left hand corps was the British III Corps under Lieutenant General Richard Butler, while the Australian Corps under Lieutenant General John Monash held the right flank and linked up with French armies to the south. On 30 May, all the Australian infantry divisions were united under the corps HQ, {{for the first time on}} the Western Front. The Australians had mounted a number of local counter-attacks which both revealed the suitability of <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>and</b> firm terrain south of the Somme for a larger offensive and also established and refined the methods which were to be used.|$|E
5|$|The {{economy is}} mainly based on {{agriculture}} and this, along with tourism, {{has contributed to}} the rural and seaside character of the Riding.

5|$|Throughout a {{great and}} open area, not only {{will there be a}} greater chance of {{favourable}} variations, arising from the large number of individuals of the same species there supported, but the conditions of life are much more complex from the large number of already existing species; and if some of these species become modified and improved, others will have to be improved in a corresponding degree, or they will be exterminated. Each new form, also, as soon as it has been improved, will be able to spread over <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>and</b> continuous area, and will thus come into competition with many other forms... the new forms produced on large areas, which have already been victorious over many competitors, will be those that will spread most widely, and will give rise to the greatest number of new varieties and species. They will thus play a more important role in the changing history of the organic world.|$|E
5|$|Foraging {{behaviour}} {{depends on}} the type of termite. For example, certain species feed on the wood structures they inhabit, and others harvest food that is near the nest. Most workers are rarely found out in <b>the</b> <b>open,</b> <b>and</b> do not forage unprotected; they rely on sheeting and runways to protect them from predators. Subterranean termites construct tunnels and galleries to look for food, and workers who manage to find food sources recruit additional nestmates by depositing a phagostimulant pheromone that attracts workers. Foraging workers use semiochemicals to communicate with each other, and workers who begin to forage outside of their nest release trail pheromones from their sternal glands. In one species, Nasutitermes costalis, there are three phases in a foraging expedition: first, soldiers scout an area. When they find a food source, they communicate to other soldiers and a small force of workers starts to emerge. In the second phase, workers appear in large numbers at the site. The third phase is marked by a {{decrease in the number of}} soldiers present and an increase in the number of workers. Isolated termite workers may engage in Lévy flight behaviour as an optimised strategy for finding their nestmates or foraging for food.|$|E
