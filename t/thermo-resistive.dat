40|$|A {{feedback}} <b>thermo-resistive</b> sensor-based measurement {{scheme was}} proposed to estimate physical quantities like solar radiation (H), fluid velocity (U) and environment temperature (Ta). It was implemented as an environment temperature meter, using PI controller. Controller implementation was done digitally using FPGA. Practical results are presented...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} a <b>thermo-resistive</b> {{instability in the}} outer crusts of magnetars wherein a perturbation in temperature increases ohmic heating. We show that magnetars of characteristic age τ_age 10 ^ 4 yr are unstable over timescales as short as days if strong current sheets {{are present in the}} outer crust. This instability could {{play an important role in}} the thermal and magnetic field evolution of magnetars, and may be related to bursting activity in magnetars...|$|E
40|$|Micro-thermal {{analysis}} (µ-TA), with a miniaturized <b>thermo-resistive</b> probe, allows topographic {{and thermal}} imaging of surfaces {{to be carried}} out and permits localized thermal analysis of materials. In order to estimate the effective volume of material thermally affected during this localized measurement, simulations, using finite element method were used. Several parameters and conditions were considered. So, thermal conductivity was found to be the driving physical parameter in thermal exchanges. Indeed, the evolution of the heat affected zone (HAZ) versus thermal conductivity can well be described by a linear interpolation. Therefore it is possible to estimate the HAZ before experimental measurements. This result is an important progress especially for accurate interphase characterization in heterogeneous materials...|$|E
40|$|The {{scientific}} community has known about Fluidic Oscillation as a measurement technology for many years. Recent advances in this technology now {{make this a}} highly robust, cost-effective solution to metering needs. This paper will discuss the advances and benefits. Based on Bernoulli’s Theory- A slow moving high pressure gas becomes fast moving low pressure gas at the nozzle exit forming a jet of gas. The jet, once formed can be controlled by the Coanda effect using an obstacle in the flow {{that is designed to}} optimize the performance of the meter. Controlling the jet path enables formation of feedback nodes of pressure {{on either side of the}} jet. This provides a predictable oscillation of the jet. The metrology of the meter is only related to the mechanical design of the oscillation chamber and flow tranquilizer. The jet oscillations are detected using a <b>thermo-resistive</b> sensing device, which provides the data to the electronic index. In addition to the commonly known benefits of static metering (no moving parts and possible integrated volume correction and AMR), fluidic oscillation provides high rangeability and tolerates dirty gas...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{developments}} in MEMS technology made available {{a new class}} of <b>thermo-resistive</b> sensors to be used as functional devices for acoustic particle velocity, v, measurements (Bruschi and Piotto, IEEE Sensors Proceedings 1405 – 1408, 2011). A very interesting feature of this new generation of v-sensors—distinguishing them from the Microflown® ones (de Bree et al., Sens Actuators A Phys 54 : 552 – 557, 1996) —is their compatibility with standard CMOS industrial processes, so allowing to integrate in the same chip both the sensors and read-out electronic circuits. This added flexibility of v-sensors, combined with miniature or MEMS microphones, allows of setting up pressure–velocity (p–v) microprobes for specific applications, in particular when the reduction of production costs is decisive for marketing strategies. In many applications, in fact, carefully designed functional devices can be safely used, without prejudice to the reliability and the robustness of the required measurement process. In other words, the required measurement precision can be achieved despite the low signal-to-noise ratio or limited band frequency response of the used p–v microprobes. This article shows a first comparison between the two kinds of sensor...|$|E
40|$|Four Polyanilines (PANI) doped with {{different}} acids (HCl, dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid or DBSA and sodio- 5 -sulfoisophtalic acid or NaSIPA) {{have been prepared}} by chemical oxidative polymerization, through direct and indirect routes of synthesis. The synthesis conditions have been optimized to be simple, low-cost and transferable to industrial processing. The PANIs have been characterized by Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and electrical DC conductivity. The nature of the acid dopant and synthetic conditions affect the doping level, oxidation state, presence of oligomeric chains and morphology, which account for the conductivity values spanning from 3. 9 to 14. 7 S/cm. The polymers were subjected to different heating ramps and heating-cooling cycles to test the dependence of electrical conductivity with temperature. Conductivity retention upon heating is affected by moisture content, thermal stability of the dopant, strength of the PANI-acid complex and rearrangement capability of both PANI and organic dopant alkyl chains. Two DBSA doped PANIs, obtained by direct and indirect methods, exhibit the best conductivity retention up to 150 ºC and excellent <b>thermo-resistive</b> properties in cyclic experiments, which make them potential materials for thermal sensor applications.
