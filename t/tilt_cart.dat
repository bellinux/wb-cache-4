6000|$|I {{suppose it}} was about half-past eight when this worthy, Monsieur Hector Gilliard of Maubeuge, turned up at the ale-house door in a <b>tilt</b> <b>cart</b> drawn by a donkey, and cried cheerily on the inhabitants. He was a lean, nervous flibbertigibbet of a man, with {{something}} {{the look of a}}n actor, and something the look of a horse-jockey. He had evidently prospered without any of the favours of education; for he adhered with stern simplicity to the masculine gender, {{and in the course of}} the evening passed off some fancy futures in a very florid style of architecture. With him came his wife, a comely young woman with her hair tied in a yellow kerchief, and their son, a little fellow of four, in a blouse and military kepi. It was notable that the child was many degrees better dressed than either of the parents. We were informed he was already at a boarding- school; but the holidays having just commenced, he was off to spend them with his parents on a cruise. An enchanting holiday occupation, was it not? to travel all day with father and mother in the <b>tilt</b> <b>cart</b> full of countless treasures; the green country rattling by on either side, and the children in all the villages contemplating him with envy and wonder? It is better fun, during the holidays, to be the son of a travelling merchant, than son and heir to the greatest cotton-spinner in creation. And as for being a reigning prince--indeed I never saw one if it was not Master Gilliard! ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was nine}} years before I {{revisited}} the neighbourhood. I travelled at that time with a <b>tilt</b> <b>cart,</b> a tent, and a cooking- stove, tramping all day beside the waggon, and at night, whenever it was possible, gipsying in a cove of the hills, or {{by the side of}} a wood. I believe I visited in this manner most of the wild and desolate regions both in England and Scotland; and, as I had neither friends nor relations, I was troubled with no correspondence, and had nothing in the nature of headquarters, unless it was the office of my solicitors, from whom I drew my income twice a year. It was a life in which I delighted; and I fully thought to have grown old upon the march, and at last died in a ditch.|$|E
25|$|The Gypsy Horse was bred by the Roma of Great Britain to {{pull the}} vardoes in which they lived and {{travelled}}. The Roma {{had arrived in the}} British Isles by 1500 AD, but they did not begin to live in vardoes until around 1850. Prior to that, they travelled in <b>tilted</b> <b>carts</b> or afoot and slept either under or in these carts or in small tents. The peak usage of the Gypsy caravan occurred {{in the latter part of}} the 19th century and the first two decades of the 20th.|$|R

Prior to that, they {{traveled}} in <b>tilted</b> <b>carts</b> or afoot and slept either under or in these carts or in small tents. Originally Romanichals would travel on foot, or with light, horse-drawn carts, typical of other Romani groups or would build [...] "bender" [...] tents â€” so called because they were made from supple branches which they bent inwards to support a waterproof covering. The heyday of the Romani caravan was {{the latter part of the}} 19th century.|$|R
60|$|The {{schoolmaster}} {{was leaving}} the village, and everybody seemed sorry. The miller at Cresscombe lent him the small white <b>tilted</b> <b>cart</b> and horse to carry his goods {{to the city of}} his destination, about twenty miles off, such a vehicle proving of quite sufficient size for the departing teacher's effects. For the schoolhouse had been partly furnished by the managers, and the only cumbersome article possessed by the master, in addition to the packing-case of books, was a cottage piano that he had bought at an auction during the year in which he thought of learning instrumental music. But the enthusiasm having waned he had never acquired any skill in playing, and the purchased article had been a perpetual trouble to him ever since in moving house.|$|R
60|$|Like Constantinople {{seen from}} the Bosphorus; like Mrs. Rougemont viewed in her box from the {{opposite}} side of the house; like many an object which we pursue in life, and admire before we have attained it; Clavering is rather prettier at a distance than it is on a closer acquaintance. The town so cheerful of aspect a few furlongs off, looks very blank and dreary. Except on market days there is nobody in the streets. The clack of a pair of pattens echoes through half the place, and you may hear the creaking of the rusty old ensign at the Clavering Arms, without being disturbed by any other noise. There has not been a ball in the Assembly Rooms since the Clavering volunteers gave one to their Colonel, the old Sir Francis Clavering; and the stables which once held a great part of that brilliant, but defunct regiment, are now cheerless and empty, except on Thursdays, when the farmers put up there, and their <b>tilted</b> <b>carts</b> and gigs make a feeble show of liveliness in the place, or on Petty Sessions, when the magistrates attend in what used to be the old card-room.|$|R
50|$|Mart Racer {{features}} twelve different supermarkets to race in, {{with new}} stages unlocked by winning. The game {{is controlled by}} players gripping the Wii Remote like the bar on a shopping <b>cart,</b> <b>tilting</b> it forward and back to accelerate and brake, and twisting it to steer. The Classic Controller is also supported.|$|R
60|$|Cole felt fear. He {{kicked at}} the terrified horses. They reached a big door, {{crashing}} wildly against it. The door gave--and they were outside, bright sunlight blinking down on them. For a sickening second the <b>cart</b> <b>tilted,</b> almost turning over. Then the horses gained speed, racing across an open field, toward a distant line of green, Cole holding tightly to the reins.|$|R
60|$|This {{extremely}} artful suggestion Mr. Barkis accompanied with a nudge of {{his elbow}} {{that gave me}} quite a stitch in my side. After that, he slouched over his horse in his usual manner; and made no other reference to the subject except, half an hour afterwards, taking a piece of chalk from his pocket, and writing up, inside the <b>tilt</b> of the <b>cart,</b> 'Clara Peggotty'--apparently as a private memorandum.|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the use of a standard two-wheel cart to transport loads over a curb. This was done through biomechanical (static and dynamic) and psychophysical evaluations of industrial males. The biomechanical study (n= 4) involved altering the amount of weight placed on the cart, the diameter of the wheels, and the load center of gravity. For the heavier load of 68 kg (150 lb), the forces exerted on the force plates (p= 0. 0001) and the dynamic moments (P= 0. 0001) at the shoulder, hip, L 5 /S 1, and knee increased. In addition, the static moments at the elbow (p= 0. 0001), hip (p= 0. 0001), L 5 /Sl (p= 0. 0001), and knee (p= 0. 0260) increased for the heavier load. The accelerations at the shoulder (p= 0. 0356) and elbow (p= 0. 0090) also increased for the heavier load. For the smaller diameter wheel, the forces exerted on the force plates (p= 0. 0027), and the dynamic (p= 0. 0143) and static (p= 0. 0014) moments at the knee increased. For the longer distance between the load center of gravity and the axle, the accelerations at the hip (p= 0. 0442) and L 5 /S 1 (p= 0. 0145) as well as the dynamic (p= 0. 001 1) and static (p= 0. 0008) moments at L 5 /S 1 increased. The psychophysical study (n= 20) required participants to determine the maximum load each was comfortable having on the <b>cart</b> to <b>tilt</b> the <b>cart</b> back and to move the cart over the curb without excessive strain. The maximum weight to <b>tilt</b> back the <b>cart</b> was 225. 8 kg (500 lb), and the minimum was 158. 8 kg (350. 1 lb). The average weight of the load the worker was willing to transport with the cart over the curb was 101. 8 kg (224. 4 lb), which is roughly half of the average load of 203. 0 kg (447. 5 lb) to <b>tilt</b> the <b>cart</b> back. This study concludes that moving a two-wheel cart over a curb is a dynamic activity. Recommendations include use of a wheel larger than 20. 3 cm (8 in) and redesign of the runner on the cart. Also, stack loads up until it is necessary to stack them out on the tongue extension and place heavier items closer to the cart axle...|$|R
60|$|Breaks and Drags.--Breaks.--Every {{cart and}} wagon in Switzerland, and, indeed, {{in most parts}} of the Continent, has a break {{attached}} to it: the simplest kind of break is shown in fig. 2, which represents a <b>cart</b> <b>tilted</b> upwards. Fig 1 shows the break itself; fig. 2 explains how it is fitted on to the cart. [Fig 1.] It will easily be understood how, by tightening the free end of the cord, the break is pressed against the wheels. The bent piece of iron shown in fig. 2, by which the bar of the break is kept in its place, may be replaced by a piece of wood, or even by a thong of leather. Every explorer's wagon should be furnished with a break.|$|R
5000|$|The New York Timess review concluded, [...] "the films highlight, one superbly {{conceived}} and well-performed {{scene with the}} father and girl at loggerheads over the boy. As we contend, the author does know better. He has perceptively hammerlocked youth and age, and until the half-way mark, the above-mentioned encounter, the quandary is genuinely intriguing. But M. Cocteaus triumphant rattling of the Oedipus legend <b>tilts</b> the apple <b>cart,</b> {{and some of his}} own dialogue provides the best summary. [...] "What a nightmare!" [...] moans Miss Spencer at one point. Mr. Warrender: [...] "Youre telling me" [...] and more recently, TV Guide wrote, [...] "the film is too talky and constricted by stage motifs. Enoch and Albiin, the mistress, do have a nice chemistry, though." ...|$|R
40|$|Photograph of horse-drawn carts {{being used}} for {{construction}} on a segment of Southern Pacific Railroad in a mountainous region, ca. 1860. At center, five carts {{can be seen at}} the bottom of a mound of loose-earth, above which five more can be seen with their <b>carts</b> <b>tilted</b> back toward the viewer. Nine men attend to the lower carts. In the distance, lumber can be seen on the mountainside just above the road.; Photoprint reads: "None of the facilities for large scale construction work were to be had when the first lines of the Southern Pacific and its parent organization (Central Pacific) were being built in the West. One-horse dump carts, wheelbarrows and Chinese laborers took the place of the modern steam derricks and large scrapers. Dynamite was not then in use and black powder wa the only explosive used in blasting through hundreds of feet of solid granite walls. Building of these rail lines, particularly through the mountainous country, is considered one of the greatest engineering achievements of all times"...|$|R
40|$|Perceptual matches between {{vertical}} extents (poles) and egocentric extents (between {{the observer}} and the pole) show that observers set themselves much {{too far from}} the pole, consistent with an under-perception of egocentric distance (Li, Phillips 2 Ì† 6 Durgin, 2010). These matches can be modeled by assuming that angular gaze declination is exaggerated with a pitch-angle gain of 1. 5. Matches to horizontal frontal extents suggest a lesser yaw-angle gain of about 1. 2 (Li et al., in press). We tested whether angular biases in space perception were affected by observer orientation relative to vertical. Observers (96) were tested in four, between-subject conditions: (1) Walking, (2) Sitting upright on a cart, (3) Lying sideways on a <b>cart</b> (<b>tilted</b> 90 Â° from vertical), and (4) Lying at an oblique angle (54 Â° from vertical) on a cart. Each observer made three judgments: one egocentric matching judgment to a 10 m vertical pole (half started near; half far and adjusted themselves to be in the apparent match location), one 45 Â° gaze elevation judgment to a 35 m tower (half started near; half far and adjusted themselves to be at an apparent 45 Â° {{to the top of the}} tower), and one verbal height estimate of the 35 m tower. Upright observers and tilted observers showed similarly biased matches between egocentric distance and object height and consistently biased apparent 45 Â° gaze setting, consistent with the model proposed by Li et al. (2010). This suggests that exaggerations of gaze elevation and declination are referenced to the world rather than the body. However, tilted observers gave reliably lower verbal estimates of tower height (geometric mean: 28 m), than did upright observers (45 m). Although eye-height was similar across conditions, it may have been underestimated in the tilted conditions [...] which should reduce height estimates proportionally but not affect matching.
