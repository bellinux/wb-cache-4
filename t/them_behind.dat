5|$|Bok finally {{escaped from}} Giemma {{when he was}} 17 years old by walking through the forest to the nearby market town of Mutari. Bok went to the local police {{department}} to seek help, and asked the police to help him find his people. Instead of helping him, the police made him their slave for two months. Bok escaped from the police by simply taking their donkeys to the well, tying them, and leaving <b>them</b> <b>behind</b> as {{he walked into the}} crowded marketplace.|$|E
5|$|Gilpin Gorst {{bought the}} estate in 1815 at public auction, {{and his son}} sold it to Thomas Usborne in 1824. When London Bridge was {{replaced}} in 1826, Usborne bought pieces of the stone balustrades, which date to 1209, and erected <b>them</b> <b>behind</b> the White House around the Buffalo Lawn. The estate changed ownership more times, but these families did not maintain the property and it fell into disrepair by 1900. Reverend Cranshaw, a local resident, bought the estate in 1911 and was the last owner prior to the Boy Scout Association, {{as it was then}} known.|$|E
5|$|Miss Calypso is a 1957 album by singer, {{writer and}} poet Maya Angelou. The album was {{released}} during a craze for calypso music catalyzed by Harry Belafonte the previous year. Angelou sings every {{song on the}} album, and she composed five of <b>them.</b> <b>Behind</b> Angelou's voice, studio guitarist Tommy Tedesco and percussionist Al Bello created an exotic mood. Angelou toured {{in support of the}} album, performing calypso songs in nightclubs. The album was a modest success but Angelou did not make any further records as a singer.|$|E

5|$|With {{this new}} power he persuaded the chamber {{to pass the}} radical Ventôse Decrees, under which the régime would {{confiscate}} aristocratic émigré property and distribute it to needy sans-culottes. But these acts of wealth redistribution, arguably the most revolutionary acts of the French Revolution, never went into operation. The Committee faltered in creating procedures for their enforcement, and the frantic pace of unfolding political events left <b>them</b> <b>behind.</b>|$|E
5|$|Lieutenant du Plooy led his {{men around}} the bend, {{carefully}} keeping <b>them</b> <b>behind</b> cover, then sent Coey {{out into the}} open riverbed to give treatment. With his Red Cross flag clearly visible, Coey came out from cover and made for the bodies on the ground. The concealed cadres immediately opened fire and fatally shot him through the head. His lifeless body fell at du Plooy's feet. Coey was the first American fatality of the Rhodesian Bush War. The contact in which he died eventually ended with du Plooy and two other Rhodesians being wounded and a further Rhodesian soldier, Corporal Jannie de Beer, being killed. The insurgents escaped without any further loss to their number.|$|E
5|$|Making several {{attempts}} to close on Endymion, Decatur discovered that Presidents damage limited her maneuverability, allowing Endymion to anticipate, and draw away from, positions favorable for boarding. Faced {{with this new}} dilemma, Decatur ordered bar and chain shot fired to disable Endymions sails and rigging, the idea being to shake his pursuer and allow President to proceed to a safe port without being followed. At noon, Endymion, being the much better sailer, was close-hauled, outpacing her squadron and leaving <b>them</b> <b>behind.</b> At 2pm, she gained on President and took position on the American ship's quarter, shooting into President {{as she tried to}} escape. Endymion was able to rake President three times and did considerable damage to her; by contrast, President primarily directed her fire at Endymion's rigging in order to slow her down during the two-hour engagement.|$|E

5|$|On 26 October 1942, Oliphant {{embarked}} from Melbourne, taking Rosa and {{the children}} back with him. The wartime sea voyage on the French Desirade was again a slow one, {{and they did not}} reach Glasgow until 29 February 1943. But he had to leave <b>them</b> <b>behind</b> once more in November 1943 after he joined the Manhattan Project in the United States as part of the British Mission. Oliphant was one of the scientists whose services the Americans were most eager to secure, and Robert Oppenheimer, the head of the Los Alamos Laboratory attempted to persuade Oliphant to join. The work on the bomb itself made him uneasy, and he preferred to head the team assisting his friend Lawrence at the Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley to develop the electromagnetic uranium enrichment– a vital but less overtly military part of the project.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} was {{released}} on Vevo on May 21, 2013. The video was directed by Rich Lee. The video features Levine and Emily Ratajkowski as his love interest, {{as well as the}} members of the band, covered in grey paint. Levine initially paints himself out of a purely white background and then paints Ratajowski in front of him. The last scenes feature the band member's instruments spraying paint when played continually, a girl dancing seductively, and Levine and his love interest passionately embracing - all while covered in grey paint. In the very last scene, Levine reverses what he has done, removing all the paint from the scene, leaving no trace of <b>them</b> <b>behind.</b>|$|E
5|$|As the Giro left Austria, {{the race}} began {{to enter the}} Dolomites during stage fourteen. The {{eventual}} stage winner Marco Pantani was in a chasing group on the final climb of the stage, the Passo di Monte Giovo. He attacked, bridged the gap to the leading group, and left <b>them</b> <b>behind</b> to claim his first professional victory of his career. The next stage saw Pantani win again after he rode away from the attack group on the last climb of the Valico di Santa Cristina and he then soloed to the finish in Stradella. Pantani's efforts on the day moved him up to second overall in the race. The race's sixteenth stage took {{a break from the}} mountains with the stage being primarily fled, which ultimately led to the sprint finish that was won by Italian Maximilian Sciandri. Ján Svorada won the next day's stage after attacking from the breakaway group in the closing seconds.|$|E
