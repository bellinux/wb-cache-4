In 1999 President Clinton awarded Bentsen the Presidential Medal of Freedom, {{one of the}} nation's highest honors given to civilians. President Clinton singled Bentsen out for applause during his final State of the Union address in 2000, saying: 'In 1993 we began <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>our</b> fiscal house in order with the Deficit Reduction Act, which you'll all remember won passages in both Houses by just a single vote. Your former colleague, my first Secretary of the Treasury, led that effort and sparked our long boom. He's here with us tonight. Lloyd Bentsen, you have served America well, and we thank you.' Bentsen appeared {{in the summer of}} 2004 at the portrait unveilings at the White House of former President Bill Clinton and former First Lady Senator Hillary Clinton.|$|E
500|$|The script {{went through}} many stages. In early 1965, when backing was secured for the film, Clarke and Kubrick {{still had no}} firm idea {{of what would happen}} to Bowman after the Star Gate sequence. Initially all of Discoverys astronauts were to survive the journey; by October 3, Clarke and Kubrick had decided to leave Bowman the sole {{survivor}} and have him regress to infancy. By October 17, Kubrick had come up with what Clarke called a [...] "wild idea of slightly fag robots who create a Victorian environment <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>our</b> heroes at their ease." [...] HAL 9000 was originally named Athena after the Greek goddess of wisdom and had a feminine voice and persona.|$|E

It was unveiled on May 3, 2011 in the Capitol Rotunda. On the proper right side is inscribed a quotation from a tribute by Thomas P. [...] "Tip" [...] O'Neill, Speaker of the House {{at the end of}} Ford's presidency: [...] "God has been good to America, especially during difficult times. At the time of the Civil War, he gave us Abraham Lincoln. And at the time of Watergate, he gave us Gerald Ford—the right man at the right time who was able <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>our</b> nation back together again." [...] On the proper left side are words from Ford's swearing-in address: [...] "Our constitution works. Our great republic is a government of laws and not of men. Here the people rule." ...|$|E

500|$|Daniel Hales, {{brother of}} the organisation's {{worldwide}} leader Bruce Hales, described the book {{as part of a}} trend of what he said were lies told about his group by critics and disaffected former members. He said such criticism showed it is [...] "open season to kill us". [...] "We're happy to live our lives in anonymity, just quietly in our neighbourhoods in our low-key way. We're quite happy to have our beliefs questioned, ethically debated, and points of religion looked at. That's not a problem. We don't mind being criticised. We don't even mind being despised because of it. But once it starts to be charged that we're acting criminally, we're acting illegally, we're acting immorally, we're acting against society, then we felt that we really had <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>our</b> point of view. We felt that it wasn't fair to our members," [...] said Daniel Hales to The West Australian.|$|E
500|$|This lack {{of results}} has not {{dampened}} interest in observing the Tau Ceti system for biosignatures. In 2002, astronomers Margaret Turnbull and Jill Tarter developed the Catalog of Nearby Habitable Systems (HabCat) {{under the auspices}} of Project Phoenix, another SETI endeavour. The list contained more than [...] theoretically habitable systems, approximately 10% of the original sample. The next year, Turnbull would further refine the list to the 30 most promising systems out of [...] within one hundred light-years of the Sun, including Tau Ceti; this will form part of the basis of radio searches with the Allen Telescope Array. She also chose Tau Ceti for a final shortlist of just five stars suitable for searches by the (indefinitely postponed) Terrestrial Planet Finder telescope system, commenting that [...] "these are places I'd want to live if God were <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>our</b> planet around another star".|$|E
500|$|Lansbury {{has been}} married twice; first to the actor Richard Cromwell, when she was 19 and Cromwell was 35. Cromwell and Lansbury eloped and were married in a small civil {{ceremony}} on September 27, 1945. The marriage ended in divorce in 1946, but they remained friends {{until his death in}} 1960. In 1949 she married actor Peter Shaw, and they remained together for 54 years until his death in 2003; she asserted that [...] "We had the perfect relationship. Not many people can say that." [...] She acquired a step-son, David, from Shaw's first marriage. They had two children of their own, Anthony Peter and Deirdre Ann. While Lansbury repeatedly stated that she wanted to put her children before her career, she admitted that she often had to leave them in California for long periods when she was working elsewhere. She brought up her children to be Episcopalian, although they were not members of a congregation. She has stated that [...] "I believe that God is within all of us; that we are perfect, precious beings, and have <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>our</b> faith and trust in that." ...|$|E

500|$|After the election, Perot {{continued}} to work with [...] "United We Stand", and focused his efforts to defeat the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). In 1993, {{he was involved in}} a highly publicized debate with Vice President Al Gore on Larry King Live over NAFTA. Perot formed the Reform Party of the United States of America in 1995, and ran for president under the party's banner the following year. During the election, he failed to appear in the presidential debates, and finished in third place with about 8% of the vote, behind Republican nominee Bob Dole and President Bill Clinton. The Reform Party's candidate, former professional wrestler Jesse Ventura, was elected as Governor of Minnesota in 1998, which was connected to Perot's performance in the presidential elections. His focus on a balanced budget during his campaigns is speculated to have brought the issue to the forefront, enabling the surplus of the late 1990s. [...] Perot declined to run in the 2000 presidential election, and endorsed eventual winner Republican Governor George W. Bush of Texas. In 2008, he endorsed Republican Governor Mitt Romney of Massachusetts for the presidency, and stated [...] "the situation in 1992 was not nearly as bad as it is now... {{if ever there was a}} time when it was necessary <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>our</b> house in order, it is now." [...] The members of the populist Tea Party movement have been compared to Perot advocates, for their support of a balanced budget.|$|E

We are going <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>our</b> arms around that church and that church family." ...|$|E
2500|$|It was {{announced}} in May 2009 that a reimagining of the 1983 miniseries V created by Kenneth Johnson, had been picked up by ABC. Cast member Mitchell noted that the show would do service to the most iconic moments from the original franchise. Executive producer Scott Peters later confirmed that the new series would incorporate memorable elements of the original, including [...] "the huge ships [...] the red uniforms" [...] seen in the pilot, as: [...] "we {{are well aware of}} those moments and looking <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>our</b> own little spin on them to tip our hat to the old audience." [...] Asked about the 1983 reveal of the Visitors' reptilian appearance beneath their human disguise, Peters noted of the reimagining: [...] "We tried <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>our</b> own [...] We're ... a little bit different than their execution of it. It wasn't so much latex mask as it is real flesh and blood." ...|$|E

2500|$|On January 13, 2014, Charter Communications {{said it was}} {{interested}} in buying its larger rival Time Warner Cable. After three previous attempts to buy and merge with the company, all of which failed, Charter's chief executive officer Thomas Rutledge wrote in {{an open letter to}} Time Warner Cable's chief executive officer Robert Marcus stating, [...] "I believe we have a significant opportunity <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>our</b> companies together {{in a way that will}} create maximum, long-term value for shareholders and employees of both companies". The $132.50 per share offer, just above TWC's closing price at $132.40 on January 13, was rejected.|$|E
2500|$|These generic criticisms by OFSTED of AET {{standards}} are also echoed in local areas by people {{concerned about the}} standards in individual AET academies. For example, commenting on Richmond Park academy, councillor Paul Hodgins stated that enough was enough with AET and that the school should be given back to the local Authority. He noted that the 2016 OFSTED report on AET [...] "highlights low attendance across AET’s academies, a failure to tackle weak leadership and how changes to the trust’s working practices had not sufficiently improved its performance." [...] He said: “These depressing reports, along with the significant financial hole that AET has allowed Richmond Park Academy to get into, reflect our own experience with AET and just reinforce our firm view that RPA must come out from under them." [...] He continued by appealing personally {{to the head of}} AET: [...] "I again call on AET’s chief executive Ian Comfort <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>our</b> students first, and stop simply trying to preserve AET and his own position." ...|$|E
2500|$|Temur Iakobashvili {{had refused}} any talks in the Joint Control Commission (JCC) format, since the {{commission}} [...] "is {{responsible for what}} is happening in the region," [...] adding if Russian [...] "puppets" [...] would not be forced to negotiate then Russia's status as a mediator would be [...] "in doubt." [...] A Russian co-chairman of the JCC, Yury Popov, said in Tbilisi he was going to visit Tskhinvali with Iakobashvili: [...] "We have not yet arranged a trip to Tskhinvali...The negotiations will be held if the situation allows it." [...] South Ossetian leader Eduard Kokoity had earlier warned Popov that his visit to Tskhinvali would be [...] "dangerous". Georgian Foreign Ministry issued a statement calling on Russia to force the separatists to stop the systematic shelling and saying, [...] "Responsibility for the latest events lies with Russia." [...] The Georgian diplomats said that mercenaries and military hardware were moving to South Ossetia through the Roki Tunnel. In the afternoon South Ossetia claimed that lots of Georgian troops were advancing towards them. Abkhaz Defense Minister Mirab Kishmaria had said earlier: [...] "The Abkhazian Security Council held a meeting [...] today, where our republic's Commander-in-Chief Sergei Bagapsh gave me instructions <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>our</b> troops on combat readiness." ...|$|E

2500|$|Denisof complimented {{the season}} three Angel episode [...] "Billy", in which Wesley tries to murder Fred after {{becoming}} supernaturally misogynous, [...] "because {{it was the}} first real dark change in Wesley to experiment with". Discussing Wesley's betrayal of his friends to protect Angel's baby, Denisof explains, It isn't that he's purely bad or purely good, we're discovering a deeper and more complicated area of the character where good and bad aren't as clear, where Wesley does something motivated, he thinks, for the good of all [...] i.e. saving Connor and relieving Angel of the responsibility of murdering his son [...] and in doing so creates the situation in which the baby could be kidnapped, Angel loses his son and Wesley has his throat slit for the trouble. So it's grey rather than black or white. Science fiction magazine Starburst said that [...] "somber, subdued, bearded Wesley is worlds away from the foolish, pompous Wesley". Denisof says of the period, [...] "It was a great opportunity to explore some of the character's darker layers. You couldn't have predicted it when he arrived in Sunnydale. This was an important element to introduce and explore, to be consistent with the show and to continue the organic exploration of all the characters." [...] Whilst the character spent less time with his old friends, Denisof was [...] "more or less isolated from the , barring one or two scenes of mild confrontation when they would come to visit me and we'd chew each other out. There's definitely a cold war going on with Wesley versus the world." [...] Wesley's dark attitude is alleviated somewhat when the gang decide to take over Wolfram & Hart. The tension between Wesley and his co-workers did not go away because of the mind-wipe but because [...] "we decided we were better off as a team than as separate entities. And we had <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>our</b> differences behind us and build our trust again as a group." [...] Discussing the way Wesley's English accent softens over the course of Angel, Denisof says, [...] just sits on him better. As an actor, it just felt that organically the way he was changing, and it also seemed to be accurate when you consider the amount of time he's spent in L.A. that the accent could have softened. And since he isn't surrounded by upper-crust academics as he was as a young Watcher in the Academy in England, it's understandable that he is changing the way he speaks and changing his voice, his delivery, {{as a result of his}} environment.|$|E

5000|$|Despite {{some early}} success, the network {{struggled}} to shift its focus from the female 12-24 demographic {{to the broader}} 12-34 range, {{in its attempt to}} attract a broader young adult audience. In 2005, the network retired Michigan J. Frog, as the network's trademark mascot. The WB's president of entertainment at the time, David Janollari, explained in July 2005 at the network's summer press tour that [...] "Michigan was a symbol that perpetuated the young-teen feel of the network.
