I've no doubt this debate will go on for a significant period of time, but I do agree.

She said that this resulted in a very intermittent recording process, but also informed the album's content; she told Country Standard Time, [...] "I {{spent a lot of time}} thinking about what's important to me. I <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> album about those things." [...] Although Mattea rarely writes her material, she wrote two songs on the album with Vezner. The album's final track, a novelty song called [...] "BFD", was included as a bonus track because it was popular with fans, but she was unsure of how to sequence it with the rest of the album. [...] "The Trouble with Angels" [...] and [...] "BFD" [...] made the Hot Country Songs charts in 2000, although neither made Top 40. Country Standard Time reviewer Eli Messinger wrote that [...] "though the smooth sound and heart-on-her-sleeve lyrics may not be for the country roots fan...Mattea's superb voice and mature readings are clearly the work of an accomplished artist chasing her musical muse." ...|$|E

6000|$|In his defence of the Cuvierian doctrine, Professor Owen avails {{himself of}} the odium theologicum. He {{attributes}} to his opponents [...] "the insinuation and masked advocacy of the doctrine subversive of {{a recognition of the}} Higher Mind." [...] Now, saying nothing about the questionable propriety of thus prejudging an issue in science, we <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> unfortunate accusation. What is there in the hypothesis of necessary, as distinguished from actual, correlation of parts, which is particularly in harmony with Theism? Maintenance of the necessity, whether of sequences or of coexistences, is commonly thought rather a derogation from divine power than otherwise. Cuvier says--"None of these parts can be changed without affecting the others; and consequently, each taken separately, indicates and gives all the rest." [...] That is to say, in the nature of things the correlation could not have been otherwise. On the other hand, Professor Huxley says we have no warrant for asserting that the correlation could not have been otherwise; but have not a little reason for thinking that the same physiological ends might have been differently achieved. The one doctrine limits the possibilities of creation; the other denies the implied limit. Which, then, is most open to the charge of covert Atheism? ...|$|E
60|$|MY DEAR GENERAL BANKS:--Early {{last week}} you left me in high hope with your {{assurance}} {{that you would}} be off with your expedition {{at the end of that}} week, or early in this. It is now the end of this, and I have just been overwhelmed and confounded with the sight of a requisition made by you which, I am assured, cannot be filled and got off within an hour short of two months. I enclose you a copy of the requisition, in some hope that it is not genuine--that you have never seen it. My dear General, this expanding and piling up of impedimenta has been, so far, almost our ruin, and will be our final ruin if it is not abandoned. If you had the articles of this requisition upon the wharf, with the necessary animals to make them of any use, and forage for the animals, you could not get vessels together in two weeks to carry the whole, to say nothing of your twenty thousand men; and, having the vessels, you could not put the cargoes aboard in two weeks more. And, after all, where you are going you have no use for them. When you parted with me you had no such ideas in your mind. I know you had not, or you could not have expected to be off so soon as you said. You must get back to something like the plan you had then, or your expedition is a failure before you start. You must be off before Congress meets. You would be better off anywhere, and especially where you are going, for not having a thousand wagons doing nothing but hauling forage to feed the animals that draw them, and taking at least two thousand men to care for the wagons and animals, who otherwise might be two thousand good soldiers. Now, dear General, do not <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> ill-natured letter; it is the very reverse. The simple publication of this requisition would ruin you.|$|E
