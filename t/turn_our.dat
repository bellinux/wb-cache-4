25|$|As in The Age of Intelligent Machines Kurzweil argues {{here that}} {{evolution}} has an intelligence quotient just slightly greater than zero. He {{says it is}} not higher than that because evolution operates so slowly, and intelligence {{is a function of}} time. Kurzweil explains that humans are far more intelligent than evolution, based on what we have created in the last few thousand years, and that in <b>turn</b> <b>our</b> creations will soon be more intelligent than us. The law of accelerating returns predicts this will happen within decades, Kurzweil reveals.|$|E
25|$|We have {{mentioned}} that natural selection has not played its part {{for a long}} while. That many inferior individuals have been conserved {{through the efforts of}} hygiene and medicine. But we cannot prevent the reproduction of the weak when they are neither insane nor criminal. Or destroy sickly or defective children as we do the weaklings in a litter of puppies. The only way to obviate the disastrous predominance of the weak is to develop the strong. Our efforts to render normal the unfit are evidently useless. We should, then, <b>turn</b> <b>our</b> attention toward promoting the optimum growth of the fit. By making the strong still stronger, we could effectively help the weak; For the herd always profits by the ideas and inventions of the elite. Instead of leveling organic and mental inequalities, we should amplify them and construct greater men.|$|E

[...] Stewart has said {{that he does not}} take any joy in the failings of American government, despite the comedic fodder they provide.

[...] Gail Simone, who will be writing the series, stated: [...] "For many years, I got to write the character as Oracle, and there is to this day, no character who means more to me. This is classic Barbara as she was originally conceived, with a few big surprises.

500|$|In 1963 Waldron {{had a major}} {{breakdown}} caused by a heroin overdose. He recounted in 1998 {{that a lot of}} musicians in the 1950s and 1960s felt that taking drugs was necessary for career progression. The police assumed they were all doing it, according to Waldron: The police would stop the musicians and search us as we came out of the clubs after work. We had to <b>turn</b> <b>our</b> pockets inside out. After a while, the musicians thought ... well, if you have the name you might as well have the game. Eventually, I overdosed. I couldn't remember my own name. My hands were trembling, I couldn't play the piano. I needed shock treatments and a spinal tap to bring me back. [...] Waldron always felt that he had to return to playing, but this was a slow process. About a year after the overdose, his physical recovery was sufficient to allow him to start relearning his skills, which he did partly by listening to his own records. His recovery as a musician continued for another two years, as his speed of thought was still too slow over that period to allow genuine improvisation: [...] "I worked out my solos in advance and played what I had written out, until gradually all my faculties returned".|$|E
500|$|The {{first season}} of Dexter {{followed}} the same storyline of Jeff Lindsay's novel Darkly Dreaming Dexter, {{the first in the}} series of novels on which the television show is based, albeit with many additional elements and altered characters. When writing the second season, Daniel Cerone said that the writers [...] "didn't see the opportunity in the second book" [...] to continue on the path that they hoped to go down and chose to depart from Lindsay's second Dexter novel, Dearly Devoted Dexter. Instead, they chose [...] "to <b>turn</b> <b>our</b> biggest card up - [...] "What if Dexter's bodies were discovered?" [...] - and just chart that course throughout the season." [...] According to executive producer Clyde Phillips, they decided to resume the second season storyline five weeks after season one's finale [...] "so all of the emotional resonance of what each [...] went through [...] will continue as if that were the actual passage of time, so they're still dented and rocked by what has happened." [...] Cerone added that [...] "The nice thing with Dexter is it's actually the lack of emotional resonance." [...] Speaking about Dexter's situation {{at the beginning of the}} second season, Hall said, [...] "I think his world is pretty rocked. He encountered , a person he never anticipated encountering, someone who sees him for who he is, accepts him as such, and he really has no choice but to do him in ... he's still reeling from that, and any footing he's able to establish for himself is pretty much immediately pulled out from under him." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{break between}} {{the forces of}} Mihailović and Tito in the Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia reached eastern Bosnia in early November. In response, a joint Partisan-Chetnik conference was held in Vlasenica on 16 November. It was convened by Čolaković and Vukmanović without {{consulting}} the Partisan Provincial Committee for Bosnia-Herzegovina. Serbian Partisans were situated at Ljubovija at the time, ready to launch an offensive across the Drina against Dangić's forces in Bratunac and Srebrenica, but held off at Čolaković's request. At the conference, Čolaković tried to maintain the alliance, but Vukmanović raised Mihailović's attack on Tito's headquarters at Užice and the Chetnik's failure to fight Axis forces. Dangić questioned Vukmanović's Montenegrin background {{and told him to}} return to Montenegro. The Partisan representatives sought a policy of brotherhood and unity among Serbs, Muslims, and Croats, whereas Dangić stated that his Chetniks were fighting a purely Serbian war for the Serbian people. Dangić's envoys told them they intended [...] "to slit the throats of the Turks, except for any pretty Turkish ladies" [...] and [...] "screw down the Croats so hard that they wouldn't dare for a thousand years to look at a Serb askance." [...] At this conference the two sides failed to come to an agreement. The next day a separate Chetnik conference was held where a 14-article resolution was adopted in support of Dangić's views. Meanwhile, the Partisan General Staff of Bosnia and Herzegovina appealed to the Chetnik rank and file that Partisan-Chetnik cooperation was broken due to the Chetnik importation of Royal Yugoslav Army officers from Serbia to Bosnia and due to Dangić wanting [...] "to <b>turn</b> <b>our</b> People's Liberation Struggle into a war of Serbs against Muslims" [...] as opposed to the Partisan belief [...] "that the peaceful toiling Muslim people is not to blame for the crimes that the Ustaše have committed, and that the People's Liberation Army must protect them from persecution and killing." [...] The Staff charged that Dangić wished for [...] "Serbs to gather for a war of revenge" [...] instead of the Partisans' [...] "summon to our flag all honorable people, Serbs, Muslims, and Croats." [...] They claimed that Dangić attempted to collaborate with the Germans and Italians.|$|E

500|$|The lyrics on Riot Act {{were more}} direct than on {{preceding}} records, {{in response to}} the political climate after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Bassist Jeff Ament commented that he felt that love was a major theme of the album, and Vedder tried to convey themes such as love, loss and struggle to make a difference because of the difficulty in leading with events such as the September 11 attacks and the accidental death of nine fans during Pearl Jam's performance at the 2000 Roskilde Festival – [...] "You start feeling like, 'What do I have to say? What is my opinion?' Then I realized I did have an opinion. Not only did I have one, but I felt like it was formed by processing a lot of information and having good influences. Ament also told that [...] "I think the time's right to <b>turn</b> <b>our</b> voice up a bit [...] And Ed did it in a great way, with humour and a mystical, magical approach. It isn't just, 'We're pissed off, and fuck you! Riot! Anarchy!' Cos I don't think that's the method. At least at this point." [...] Vedder, however, said, [...] "I have to admit this record came out a bit one-sided. But I think we as a country need to understand why we're involved in the Middle East. This hollow patriotism frightens me." [...] The singer added that the Riot Act lyrics [...] "represent my state of mind these days. I'm optimistic yet disillusioned, hopeful yet frustrated." [...] Several songs on the album were inspired by Roskilde tragedy, with the album's first single, [...] "I Am Mine", being written by Vedder in 2000 in a hotel room before the band's first show after Roskilde, and [...] "Love Boat Captain" [...] including a brief lyrical reference ("Lost nine friends we'll never know... two years ago today"). Regarding the time period when the lyrics were being written, Vedder said, [...] "There's been a lot of mortality...It's a weird time to be writing. Roskilde changed the shape of us as people, and our filter for seeing the world changed." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Eastern Orthodox {{portrayal}} of the Ascension is a major metaphor for the mystical nature of the Church.
