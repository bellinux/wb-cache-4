5|$|A sea shore. As Goffredo, Eustazio and Rinaldo {{near the}} magician's lair, a {{beautiful}} woman calls from her boat, promising Rinaldo that she can take him to Almirena. Two mermaids sing of love's delights, and urge Rinaldo {{to go in the}} boat. He hesitates, unsure what to do, and his companions attempt to restrain him. Angry at the abduction of his loved one, Rinaldo enters the boat, which immediately sails off. Goffredo and Eustazio are shocked at Rinaldo's impulsiveness and believe that he has deserted <b>their</b> <b>cause.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although the Colorados had {{defected}} to the Flores insurgency, {{the national guard}} continued to support the fusionist government. Blanco partisans filled its depleted ranks. They also replaced army officers who had deserted to Flores. The Blancos received aid from several Argentine Federalists who joined <b>their</b> <b>cause.</b> As in Uruguay, Argentina had long been a battleground of rival parties, and Bartolomé Mitre's victory at Pavón in 1861 had signaled the triumph of his Unitarian Party over the Federal Party led by Justo José de Urquiza. Mitre denied any involvement in the Flores rebellion, even though his complicity was widely known and taken for granted.|$|E

5|$|Because {{judicial}} decisions {{are subject to}} the sometimes arbitrary assessments of the CCP, citizens who attempt {{to make use of the}} legal system to pursue grievances find that, if <b>their</b> <b>cause</b> is determined to have the potential to undermine the authority of the Communist Party, they may be suppressed. Defendants who find themselves facing criminal charges, such as for conducting activism or for their religious beliefs, often have few means of pursuing an effective defense.|$|E

5|$|In 2010, {{the health}} of the Dry Island Albertosaurus {{assembly}} was reported upon. Most specimens showed no sign of disease. On three phalanges of the foot strange bony spurs, consisting of abnormal ossifications of the tendons, so-called enthesophytes, were present, <b>their</b> <b>cause</b> unknown. Two ribs and a belly-rib showed signs of breaking and healing. One adult specimen had a left lower jaw showing a puncture wound and both healed and unhealed bite marks. The low number of abnormalities compares favourably with the health condition of a Majungasaurus population of which it in 2007 was established that 19% of individuals showed bone pathologies.|$|E
5|$|In Puerto Rico, Albizu Campos {{used the}} Rhoads scandal {{as part of}} his anti-colonial campaign, {{attracting}} followers to the Nationalist Party. In 1950, longtime Puerto Rican pro-independence activists Oscar Collazo and Griselio Torresola tried to assassinate President Truman to bring <b>their</b> <b>cause</b> to the world stage. When later interviewed, Collazo said that as a young man, in 1932 he heard Albizu Campos speak about the Rhoads letter and decided to devote his life to the Nationalist movement.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to desegregating public schools, Nixon implemented the Philadelphia Plan in 1970—the first significant federal affirmative action program. He also endorsed the Equal Rights Amendment after it passed {{both houses of}} Congress in 1972 {{and went to the}} states for ratification. Nixon had campaigned as an ERA supporter in 1968, though feminists criticized him for doing little to help the ERA or <b>their</b> <b>cause</b> after his election. Nevertheless, he appointed more women to administration positions than Lyndon Johnson had.|$|E

5|$|Liverpool Women's Suffrage Society {{was formed}} with the {{intention}} of fulfilling a number of goals. It hoped to educate women on why they {{should have the right to}} vote and convince men of the same. It had links with Liberal MPs and intended to use these to pressure the government to allow women's suffrage. In addition, the society tried to drum up support for <b>their</b> <b>cause</b> by holding small scale events, often with speakers at the Yamen Cafe in Liverpool's Bond Street. The events would also include poetry, singing or performances of acting or ballet by the Blue Bird Theatre Company.|$|E
5|$|Many {{of those}} in the protest {{movements}} were young children {{at the time of the}} invasion and had been educated under the Indonesian system. They resented the repression of Timorese cultural and political life at the expense of the Indonesian, were ambivalent of Indonesian economic development, and spoke Portuguese amongst themselves, stressing their Portuguese heritage. Seeking help from Portugal for self-determination, they considered Indonesia an occupying force. Abroad, Fretilin's members—most notably former journalist José Ramos-Horta (later to be Prime Minister and President)—pushed <b>their</b> <b>cause</b> in diplomatic forums.|$|E

5|$|On April 21, 1981, four EPB commandos {{were able}} to extract $348,000 from a Wells Fargo armored car, with the group later noting {{that it would be}} spent in <b>their</b> <b>cause.</b> In November 1981, the EPB detonated {{explosives}} in AEE substations in Santurce, a district of San Juan. When 350 families that occupied a makeshift village in Carolina, Puerto Rico, were removed by the police, the EPB warned the governor that they would retaliate. Afterwards, they made an offensive against the police that resulted in twelve injured and one dead policeman.|$|E
