5|$|In May 2010, an Elderly manager {{told the}} {{publication}} <b>TWICE</b> <b>that</b> economic recession had affected {{the business and}} forced layoffs of part-time employees, and that Elderly's being in Michigan worsened the effects. He noted that as the consumer electronics business began to recover, the musical instrument business followed.|$|E
5|$|On Earth, thorium {{is not a}} rare element as was {{previously}} thought, having a crustal abundance {{comparable to that of}} lead and molybdenum, <b>twice</b> <b>that</b> of arsenic, and three times that of tin. Thorium only occurs as a minor constituent of most minerals. Soil normally contains about 6 ppm of thorium.|$|E

He's one of their leading lawyers, out Dubuque way; been judge of the Common Pleas once or <b>twice.</b> <b>That's</b> his son--just {{graduated}} at Yale--alongside of my youngest girl. Good-looking chap, ain't he?" ...|$|R
5|$|The Sudan {{was very}} lightly administered. As late as 1919 {{there were just}} 17 British administrators in the Bahr al-Ghazal and Mongalla provinces, with a {{combined}} area <b>twice</b> <b>that</b> of Britain.|$|E
5|$|The {{abundance}} of deuterium in comet Hale–Bopp {{in the form}} of heavy water was found to be about <b>twice</b> <b>that</b> of Earth's oceans. If Hale–Bopp's deuterium abundance is typical of all comets, this implies that although cometary impacts are thought to be the source of a significant amount of the water on Earth, they cannot be the only source.|$|E
5|$|The {{church is}} {{relatively}} large, seating 850. It is {{built in the}} Venetian Gothic style, and divided into a five-bay nave, transepts, chancel, morning chapel and organ chamber. Although Plumbe's original design envisaged a tower, none was ever built. By 1900, St Mark's was reported as having a congregation <b>twice</b> <b>that</b> of any other church in Wood Green.|$|E
5000|$|To {{this day}} Kurti still acts and amazes her {{audience}} wherever she goes. She once said: [...] "I don't fear the old age, not even death. But, I do fear the senility of the brain, {{and when that}} moment will come, I think I would be dead <b>twice.</b> <b>That's</b> why I want to work." ...|$|R

5|$|The company grew {{consistently}} {{through the}} 1980s and 1990s, attaining a $1 billion market value by 1992. In 1993, the chain's revenue was nearly <b>twice</b> <b>that</b> {{of any other}} family restaurant.|$|E
5|$|According to the Bills of Mortality, {{there were}} in total 68,596 deaths in London from the plague in 1665. Lord Clarendon {{estimated}} that the true number of mortalities was probably <b>twice</b> <b>that</b> figure. The next year, 1666, saw further deaths in other cities but on a lesser scale. Dr Thomas Gumble, chaplain to the Duke of Albermarle, both of whom had stayed in London {{for the whole of}} the epidemic, estimated that the total death count for the country from plague during 1665 and 1666 was about 200,000.|$|E
5|$|As of 2007, the brewing {{industry}} is a global business, consisting of several dominant multinational companies and many thousands of smaller producers ranging from brewpubs to regional breweries. As of 2006, more than 133 billion litres (35 billion gallons), {{the equivalent of a}} cube 510 metres on a side, of beer are sold per year, producing total global revenues of $294.5 billion (£147.7 billion). In 2010, China's beer consumption hit 450 million hectolitres (45 billion litres), or nearly <b>twice</b> <b>that</b> of the United States, but only 5 per cent sold were premium draught beers, compared with 50 per cent in France and Germany.|$|E
60|$|CANYNGE. I don't {{know that}} an asylum isn't {{the place for}} him. He must be off his head at moments. That jump-crazy! He'd have got a verdict on that alone--if they'd seen those balconies. I was looking at them when I was down there last Sunday. Daring thing, Twisden. Very few men, on a dark night--He risked his life <b>twice.</b> <b>That's</b> a shrewd fellow--young De Levis. He spotted Dancy's nature.|$|R

5|$|During {{the late}} 1910s and 1920s, oil {{exploration}} and production continued to expand and stabilize. Oil production became established in North Texas, Central Texas, the Panhandle, and the Permian Basin in western Texas. The finds in North Texas, beginning with the 1917 strike in Ranger west of Dallas-Fort Worth, were particularly significant, bringing substantial industrialization to the area. Texas soon became dominant as the nation's leading oil producer. By 1940, Texas production was <b>twice</b> <b>that</b> of California, the next largest U.S. producer.|$|E
5|$|England's bodyline tactics, which {{involved}} bowling at speeds of around 150km/h at the heads and torsoes of the Australian batsmen—including Woodfull—and employing a close leg-side cordon to catch balls fended {{away from the}} upper body, caused great controversy and ill-feeling among Australian players and crowds. England devised the tactics {{in an attempt to}} curb Donald Bradman, Australia's star batsman, whose average hovered around 100, around <b>twice</b> <b>that</b> of all other world-class batsman. However, they also hoped to restrict the other batsmen, Woodfull among them, through such means.|$|E
5|$|Following Malvern's new-found fame as a spa {{and area}} of natural beauty, and fully {{exploiting}} its new rail connections, factories {{from as far}} as Manchester were organising day trips for their employees, often attracting as many as 5,000visitors a day. In 1865, a public meeting of residents denounced the rising rail fares– by then <b>twice</b> <b>that</b> of other lines– that were exploiting the tourism industry, and demanded a limitation {{to the number of}} excursion trains. The arrival of the railway also enabled the delivery of coal in large quantities, which accelerated the area's popularity as a winter resort.|$|E

5|$|Gair has now {{developed}} a style {{as a body}} painter. Her typical job takes her and her team eight hours, but some jobs take <b>twice</b> <b>that.</b> She does not charge by the hour. Gair is always well prepared for her jobs, but does not generally sketch her work on paper. In fact, she claims to have only had to do so twice in over twenty years of body painting. When she needs to test something out she usually uses her opposite (left) arm or hand.|$|E
5|$|Lead's {{close-packed}} face-centered cubic {{structure and}} high atomic weight {{result in a}} density of 11.34g/cm3, which is {{greater than that of}} common metals such as iron (7.87g/cm3), copper (8.93g/cm3), and zinc (7.14g/cm3). This density is the origin of the idiom to go over like a lead balloon. Some rarer metals are denser: tungsten and gold are both 19.3g/cm3, and osmium—the densest metal known—has a density of 22.59g/cm3, almost <b>twice</b> <b>that</b> of lead.|$|E
5|$|Lithium's {{coefficient}} of thermal expansion is <b>twice</b> <b>that</b> of aluminium and almost {{four times that}} of iron. Lithium is superconductive below 400 μK at standard pressure and at higher temperatures (more than 9 K) at very high pressures (>20 GPa). At temperatures below 70 K, lithium, like sodium, undergoes diffusionless phase change transformations. At 4.2 K it has a rhombohedral crystal system (with a nine-layer repeat spacing); at higher temperatures it transforms to face-centered cubic and then body-centered cubic. At liquid-helium temperatures (4 K) the rhombohedral structure is prevalent. Multiple allotropic forms have been identified for lithium at high pressures.|$|E

60|$|He listened intently, and <b>twice</b> again <b>that</b> thrilling cry broke on his ear, {{but each}} time more faintly. Still he {{continued}} to listen for it {{with a feeling of}} horror, and once or <b>twice</b> fancied <b>that</b> he heard it rising above the turmoil of wind and waves. Long before he ceased to listen in expectancy, the murderer's dead body lay tossing in that great watery grave in which so many of the human race--innocent and guilty alike--lie buried.|$|R
5|$|Osmium {{has high}} {{reflectivity}} in the ultraviolet {{range of the}} electromagnetic spectrum; for example, at 600 Å osmium has a reflectivity <b>twice</b> <b>that</b> of gold. This high reflectivity is desirable in space-based UV spectrometers, which have reduced mirror sizes due to space limitations. Osmium-coated mirrors were flown in several space missions aboard the Space Shuttle, but {{it soon became clear}} that the oxygen radicals in the low Earth orbit are abundant enough to significantly deteriorate the osmium layer.|$|E
5|$|Some 110,000 {{people live}} in the Saw Mill River's watershed, in {{communities}} varying from small villages to Yonkers, New York's fourth-largest city. This is 12% of the county's total, on 6% of its area. The watershed's population density varies from 1,000 per square mile around the headwaters at Chappaqua to 10,000 around the mouth. It averages to 4,151 per square mile, <b>twice</b> <b>that</b> of the county and ten times the density for the state.|$|E
5|$|Stieger, Voracek, and Formann {{recommend}} that the task be administered <b>twice,</b> <b>that</b> the effects be calculated separately for first-name initial and last-name initial, that the task be accompanied with the birthday-number task, and that the instructions focus on liking rather than attractiveness. They suggest {{it may be useful}} to use not just initials but all name letters for measuring implicit self-esteem, something which Hoorens says is her most important recommendation. The Letter Preference Task has been used to measure implicit self-esteem in contexts as diverse as depression, physical health, social acceptance, unrealistic optimism, feedback sensitivity, self-regulation, and defensiveness.|$|E
