5|$|As is {{discussed}} below, {{the reason for}} the delay was probably simply that neither the Athenians nor the Persians were willing to risk battle initially. This then raises <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>why</b> the battle occurred when it did. Herodotus explicitly tells us that the Greeks attacked the Persians (and the other sources confirm this), {{but it is not clear}} why they did this before the arrival of the Spartans. There are two main theories to explain this.|$|E
5|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{philosophers}} of diverse orientations have challenged many of Fodor's ideas. For example, the language of thought hypothesis {{has been accused of}} either falling prey to an infinite regress or of being superfluous. Specifically, Simon Blackburn suggested in an article in 1984 that since Fodor explains the learning of natural languages as a process of formation and confirmation of hypotheses in the LOT, this leaves him open to <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>why</b> the LOT itself should not be considered as just such a language which requires yet another and more fundamental representational substrate in which to form and confirm hypotheses so that the LOT itself can be learned. If natural language learning requires some representational substrate (the LOT) in order for it to be learned, why shouldn't the same be said for the LOT itself and then for the representational substrate of this representational substrate and so on, ad infinitum? On the other hand, if such a representational substrate is not required for the LOT, then why should it be required for the learning of natural languages? In this case, the LOT would be superfluous. Fodor, in response, argues that the LOT is unique in that it {{does not have to be}} learned via an antecedent language because it is innate.|$|E
5|$|Luther lists several criticisms {{advanced}} by laypeople against indulgences in theses 81–91. He presents these as difficult objections his congregants are bringing {{rather than his}} own criticisms. How should he answer those who ask why the pope does not simply empty purgatory {{if it is in}} his power? What should he say to those who ask why anniversary masses for the dead, which were for the sake of those in purgatory, continued for those who had been redeemed by an indulgence? Luther claimed that it seemed strange to some that pious people in purgatory could be redeemed by living impious people. Luther also mentions <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>why</b> the pope, who is very rich, requires money from poor believers to build St. Peter's Basilica. Luther claims that ignoring these questions risks allowing people to ridicule the pope. He appeals to the pope's financial interest, saying that if the preachers limited their preaching in accordance with Luther's positions on indulgences (which he claimed was also the pope's position), the objections would cease to be relevant. Luther closes the Theses by exhorting Christians to imitate Christ even if it brings pain and suffering. Enduring punishment and entering heaven is preferable to false security.|$|E

5|$|In his 2006 re-evaluation, Carpenter {{examined}} the paleobiology of giant sauropods, including Amphicoelias, and addresses <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>why</b> this group attained {{such a huge}} size. He pointed out that gigantic sizes were reached early in sauropod evolution, with very large sized species present {{as early as the}} late Triassic Period, and concluded that whatever evolutionary pressure caused large size was present from the early origins of the group. Carpenter cited several studies of giant mammalian herbivores, such as elephants and rhinoceros, which showed that larger size in plant-eating animals leads to greater efficiency in digesting food. Since larger animals have longer digestive systems, food is kept in digestion for significantly longer periods of time, allowing large animals to survive on lower-quality food sources. This is especially true of animals with a large number of 'fermentation chambers' along the intestine which allow microbes to accumulate and ferment plant material, aiding digestion. Throughout their evolutionary history, sauropod dinosaurs were found primarily in semi-arid, seasonally dry environments, with a corresponding seasonal drop in the quality of food during the dry season. The environment of Amphicoelias was essentially a savanna, similar to the arid environments in which modern giant herbivores are found, supporting the idea that poor-quality food in an arid environment promotes the evolution of giant herbivores. Carpenter argued that other benefits of large size, such as relative immunity from predators, lower energy expenditure, and longer life span, are probably secondary advantages.|$|E

25|$|In Of the Standard of Taste, Hume {{argues that}} no rules {{can be drawn}} up about what is a tasteful object.

He argued that this was because the spectator is aware that he is witnessing a dramatic performance. There is pleasure in realising that the terrible events that are being shown are actually fiction. Furthermore, Hume laid down rules for educating people in taste and correct conduct, and his writings in this area have been very influential on English and Anglo-Saxon aesthetics.|$|E

40|$|Since 2002, a new {{phenomenon}} has emerged that MNEs (Multinational Enterprises) have invested in China’s Water Industry (CWI), which belongs to the state-owned and monopolized industries with characteristics of low efficiency, low profitability, intensive investment, as well as price limitations. From the view of economic rational law, all capital has the economic nature to pursue the profit maximizing. However, this {{new phenomenon}} did not show this economic rationality of capital. It impels our motivation to make a research on the topic. Therefore, the aim of our dissertation is to answer <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>of</b> <b>why,</b> where and how of FDI in China’s Water Industry. Since few existing theories can answer our proposed <b>questions,</b> we adopt <b>the</b> SCP (Structure-Conduct-Performance) approach in Industrial Economics and OLI (Ownership-Location-Internalization) theorem in FDI theories as a deductive base {{to create a new}} applicable CIF (Country-Industry-Firm) model, which can be used to answer <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>of</b> <b>why,</b> where and how of FDI in China’s Water Industry. Then, we use a positivistic philosophy to try the newly created model with multiple research methods: a case study and a survey. We focus on a typical and empirical case: Vivendi Water in China. Consequently, we analyze the data in detail. After the empirical research study, we conclude that the Country Factors, Industry Factors and Firm Factors are the main factors which facilitate FDI in China’s Water Industry.
