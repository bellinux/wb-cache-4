2500|$|Meier founded MicroProse with Stealey in 1982, and by 1986 {{the company}} was using his name and face in {{advertisements}} for its games. MicroProse at first developed mostly simulation video games, such as Silent Service and F-19 Stealth Fighter. In 1987, the company released Sid Meier's Pirates!, which also began a trend of placing Meier's name in the titles of his games. He later explained that the inclusion of his name {{was because of the}} dramatic departure in the design of Pirates! compared to the company's earlier titles. Stealey decided that it would improve the company's branding, believing that it would make those who purchased the flight simulators more likely to play the game. Stealey recalled: [...] "We were at dinner at a Software Publishers Association meeting, and Robin Williams was there. And he kept us in stitches for two hours. And he <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> and says 'Bill, you should put Sid's name on a couple of these boxes, and promote him as the star.' And that's how Sid's name got on Pirates, and Civilization." ...|$|E
2500|$|... {{this movie}} is about visuals. It's about excitement, it's about thrills. Don't worry about the script... I {{remember}} mentioning it to six or seven people that the script was trashy and I always got the same answer... The script doesn't matter. This movie is about visuals... Then {{we go to the}} first edit, the first cut of the movie in the screening room and it's [...] Iovine and me and Joel Silver... And about 20 minutes into the movie Jimmy <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> and he goes... {{this movie is}} really shitty isn't it? It's really bad. I said, yeah, it's a really bad script. Why didn't anyone notice that the script was bad? It stinks. I can't even watch it... Joel's on the other side going, what am I gonna do next? There's gotta be a next project, and they're sitting there and there's so many lessons I learned during that movie. It went $14 million over budget, I think and I kept saying to Joel, how are they allowing this? 'Cause they kept screaming at us, it's over the budget. I said, how, and they, you've gotta understand, they built all, Walter Hill didn't want to go to Chicago. The story took place in Chicago, so they built Chicago in LA.|$|E
2500|$|When Kiefer Sutherland {{took the}} project, {{he did not}} {{understand}} that the series was set in real-time, having skipped the line that said, [...] "All events take place in real time." [...] Kiefer said it was, in fact, the interaction between the characters that prompted him to take the pilot. Sutherland was sent the script by director Stephen Hopkins, with whom he had a previous relationship. Sutherland was attracted to the shades of grey in the Jack Bauer character, as well as his status as a [...] "normal guy", citing Jack's inability to handle his own teenage daughter. The Tony Almeida character was originally called [...] "Geller" [...] in the original Pilot script, who Bernard called a [...] "backbiting Jewish techie guy". Bernard didn't understand why they had sent him the script, given his Hispanic ethnicity. Carlos and the crew came up with the Tony Almeida name fifteen minutes before shooting, but the legal department wouldn't let them use it. Legal told the crew that they could use the name 'Tonio', which Carlos found underwhelming. Bernard said, [...] "So we were filming the very first scene, Kiefer walking down CTU, and he <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> and says, 'Sorry man, I can't call you Tonio, I'm just gonna call you Tony.' I owe Kiefer everything: Tonio's the name of a guy who gets killed in the first episode." ...|$|E
