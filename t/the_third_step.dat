5|$|The sixteenth {{stage was}} {{considered}} to be one of two queen stages, most difficult stages, of this Giro, as it contained many high mountain climbs and the Giro's most difficult summit stage finish. After the second rest day came an unusual stage, one that was very short in terms of sheer distance but on par with previous mountain stages in terms of difficulty. These stages were won by Carlos Sastre and Franco Pellizotti, respectively, who fought for <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>step</b> on the Giro's podium behind Menchov and previous race leader Danilo Di Luca. Though Sastre went on to win another stage, to Mount Vesuvius, it was Pellizotti who finished the Giro third overall.|$|E

25|$|Odell's {{sighting}} is of {{especially high}} interest. The description of Odell's sighting {{and the current}} knowledge indicate Mallory's 5-minute surmounting of the Second Step is unlikely.

He finished the Spanish Grand Tour on <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>step</b> of the podium behind Chris Froome and the overall winner Alberto Contador. After the Vuelta, it was announced that Valverde had signed a three-year contract with his team, Movistar, meaning that he would ride for them until at least 2017. At the World Road Race Championships in Ponferrada, Valverde stood on <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>step</b> on the podium for the third year in a row.

This differs from the aggregate decision making of classical political economy in that it explains how vital goods such as water can be cheap, while luxuries can be expensive.|$|E

25|$|This {{step was}} then {{repeated}} in <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>step.</b> The plutonium was reduced again by adding ferrous ammonium sulfate. Bismuth nitrate and phosphoric acid were added and bismuth phosphate precipitated. It was dissolved in nitric acid and the bismuth phosphate was precipitated. This step resulted {{in reducing the}} gamma radiation by four more orders of magnitude, so the plutonium-bearing solution now had 100,000-th of the original gamma radiation. The plutonium solution was transferred from the 224 buildings to the 221 buildings, through underground pipes. In the fourth step, phosphoric acid was added and the bismuth phosphate precipitated and removed; potassium permanganate was added to oxidize the plutonium.|$|E

This positive outcome resulted from the explanation of the decomposition of the waveform in different frequency ranges separately analyzed in <b>the</b> first and <b>third</b> <b>steps.</b> As a result, the Three-step SW method has a significantly lower computational burden than SW ESPRIT or SW Prony while still providing highly accurate results.|$|R

A color contrast value is defined to select the best color space for segmenting color objects. Then, an architecture of binary neural networks is described. Its properties relies on the simplification of the recognition problem, leading to a noticeable increase in the classification rate. We conclude with the abilities of such a recognition scheme and present an automated cell sorting system...|$|R
