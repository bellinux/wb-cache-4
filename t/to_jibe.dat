5|$|After {{escaping}} the Machias men, the Margaretta was forced <b>to</b> <b>jibe</b> into brisk winds, {{which resulted in}} the main boom and gaff breaking away, crippling its navigability. Once Moore was in Holmes Bay he captured a sloop and took its spar and gaff to replace the Margaretta's. Moore also took its pilot, Robert Avery, captive. The Unity crew of about 30 Machias men elected Jeremiah O'Brien as their captain and sailed out to chase down the Margaretta. Since the Unity was a much faster sailing vessel, O'Brien's crew quickly caught up to the crippled Margaretta, while the Falmouth Packet lagged behind.|$|E
5|$|The sudden {{loss of the}} {{flagship}} and the fleet admiral threw the already scattered Swedish line into confusion and sapped morale. Four ships from Creutz's and Uggla's squadrons immediately fled when they saw that {{the flagship}} was lost. Claes Uggla was next in command after Creutz and became the acting commander of the Swedish fleet. When the line came about, Uggla and his ship Svärdet came {{on a collision course}} with the still floating wreckage of Kronan, and were forced <b>to</b> <b>jibe</b> (turn the stern into the wind direction) to avoid it. Svärdets second turn was interpreted by many ships as a signal to turn again; others interpreted it as the beginning of a general retreat, leading to major disorder. Uggla reduced speed in an attempt to gather his forces, but instead was separated from his squadron.|$|E
2500|$|By midnight, the {{flotilla}} was on {{its final}} leg between Warren Island and Coronation Island, and the captains of both tugboats became concerned with the freshening southeast headwind. The vessels were making very little forward progress and getting closer to Coronation Island than expected. In poor visibility, the crews of all three ships relied on lead lines to ascertain their positions with respect to land. As the wind continued to strengthen, by 1:00a.m. captain Farrar and captain Hamilton, whose tugboats were moving [...] from each other, negotiated a turn, aimed <b>to</b> <b>jibe</b> the Star of Bengal, i.e. to pull her through the wind and change her tack from port to starboard.|$|E

2500|$|The resail of race {{thirteen}} {{began at}} 2:33pm in [...] of wind. Spithill tried to hook Barker during the pre start to gain advantage, but Barker managed to prevent Oracle from gaining the overlap. Team New Zealand led over the line, {{and took a}} 3-second lead around the reach mark. The pivotal moment of the race came {{towards the end of}} the second leg. Team New Zealand were slightly ahead and tried to cross in front of Oracle who had the starboard tack advantage. Spithill had to evade the Kiwi boat, and gained a penalty for the infraction. With the boats still close heading into the leeward gate, Barker fluffed his lines, and Aotearoa ended up being forced <b>to</b> <b>jibe</b> twice in quick succession. Oracle sped away to begin the third leg leaving the Kiwis almost dead in the water. That was effectively the race, and Oracle confirmed their third point by 1:24 at the finish. The New Zealanders' largest defeat of the Cup to date brought the score to 3–8.|$|E

50|$|Madame Fatal {{was never}} a popular {{character}} given the cross-dressing angle, which is perhaps {{part of the reason}} why DC Comics decided not to further run with the character and limited him <b>to</b> light-hearted <b>jibes</b> made by other comic book heroes.|$|R

Grafton Street, along which he walked, prolonged that moment of discouraged poverty. In the roadway {{at the head of the}} street a slab was set to the memory of Wolfe Tone and he remembered having been present with his father at its laying. He remembered with bitterness that scene of tawdry tribute. There were four French delegates in a brake and one, a plump smiling young man, held, wedged on a stick, a card on which were printed the words: VIVE L'IRLANDE! ...|$|R

60|$|When {{the point}} {{shut off the}} beach, she saw she must come round, and, after waiting for a patch of smooth water, put up the helm <b>to</b> <b>jibe.</b> The strain on the sheet was heavier than she thought; the rope bruised her fingers as it ran through them. The boat rolled wildly, and then the big sail swung over with a crash. Evelyn saw with alarm that the gaff along its head had stopped at an unusual angle to the canvas. Something had gone wrong. But her nerve was good. She could lower the {{mainsail}} and run home under the jib.|$|E

60|$|I coughed, {{and tried}} to feel less wrathful toward Tripp. I saw my duty. Cunningly I had been inveigled, but I was {{securely}} trapped. Tripp's first dictum to me had been just and correct. The young lady must {{be sent back to}} Greenburg that day. She must be argued with, convinced, assured, instructed, ticketed, and returned without delay. I hated Hiram and despised George; but duty must be done. Noblesse oblige and only five silver dollars are not strictly romantic compatibles, but sometimes they can be made <b>to</b> <b>jibe.</b> It was mine to be Sir Oracle, and then pay the freight. So I assumed an air that mingled Solomon's with that of the general passenger agent of the Long Island Railroad.|$|E
60|$|Suffering {{much from}} thirst {{and from the}} wound on his left hand, which had now begun to swell, Henry watched the Indians as they {{prepared}} an early morning meal, for the light of dawn was now showing in the east.

The smell of the cooking venison was tantalizing to Henry, but he {{knew better than to}} ask for a portion of the repast. Once or twice the Indians came up to him but only <b>to</b> <b>jibe</b> at him and poke him with their guns or their bows, while one made a move with his hunting knife as if to cut out the young hunter's heart.|$|E

Besides that, we'd have a strip of rocky coast to lee of us presently, and we mightn't be able to keep her off it with only the foresail set. On the other hand, so far as I can recollect from looking at the chart, the islands are dead to leeward and we'd only have to keep her running to reach them.

25|$|By {{the end of}} the war, Louisville {{itself had}} not been {{attacked}} once, although it was surrounded by skirmishes and battles, including the Battle of Perryville and the Battle of Corydon. The Unionists—most of whose leaders owned slaves—felt betrayed by the abolitionist position of the Republican Party.

60|$|The inn did {{not look}} promising--the usual cold room opening gloomily on the gloomy street. The usual long table, with this time a foully blotched table-cloth. And two young peasant madams in charge, in the brown costume, rather sordid, and with folded white cloths on their heads. The younger was in attendance. She was a full-bosomed young hussy, and would be very queenly and cocky. She held her nose in the air, and seemed ready <b>to</b> <b>jibe</b> at any order. It takes one some time {{to get used to}} this cocky, {{assertive}} behaviour of the young damsels, the who'll-tread-on-the-tail-of-my-skirt bearing of the hussies. But it is partly a sort of crude defensiveness and shyness, partly it is barbaric méfiance or mistrust, and partly, without doubt, it is a tradition with Sardinian women that they must hold their own and be ready to hit first. This young sludge-queen was all hit. She flounced her posterior round the table, planking down the lumps of bread on the foul cloth with an air of take-it-as-a-condescension-that-I-wait-on-you, a subdued grin lurking somewhere on her face. It is not meant to be offensive: yet it is so. Truly, it is just uncouthness. But when one is tired and hungry....|$|E
60|$|Frank {{had learned}} that <b>to</b> <b>jibe</b> a boat is to turn her around stern to wind, instead of head-on, which is the usual way, and {{scrambling}} forward with Harry he helped lower the peak. After that they again floundered aft, leaving the mainsail reduced in size, and grabbed the sheet as Mr. Oliver put up his helm. The bows swung around as the boat went up with a sea, and the big boom tilted high up into the darkness above the boys. They struggled savagely with the sheet, which slightly restrained it, until the boat rolled suddenly down upon her side as the sail jerked over and the rope was torn swiftly through their hands. There was a crash and a bang, and Frank was conscious that the water was pouring over the coaming. He clung to the sheet, however, and while Mr. Oliver helped them with one hand they got a little of it in, after which the sloop, rising somewhat, drove forward. A few minutes later the sea suddenly became smoother, the wind seemed cut off, and Frank made out a black mass of rock rising close above them. They ran on beneath it until Mr. Oliver, rounding the boat up, bade them pitch the anchor over.|$|E

25|$|After the war, Louisville {{returned}} to growth, {{with an increase}} in manufacturing, establishment of new factories, and transporting goods by train.
