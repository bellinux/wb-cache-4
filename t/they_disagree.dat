25|$|Some websites, such as Reddit, have rules forbidding the posting of {{personal}} information of individuals (also known as doxxing), due to concerns about such postings leading to mobs {{of large numbers}} of Internet users directing harassment at the specific individuals thereby identified. In particular, the Reddit rule forbidding the posting {{of personal}} information is widely understood to imply that all identifying photos and names must be censored in Facebook screenshots posted to Reddit. However, the interpretation of this rule in relation to public Twitter posts is less clear, and in any case, like-minded people online have many other ways they can use to direct each other's attention to public social media posts <b>they</b> <b>disagree</b> with.|$|E
25|$|When hearing an appeal, the Court of Appeal {{normally}} {{sits with}} a bench of three Judges of Appeal, {{one of whom}} is the Chief Justice.

Certain appeals, including those against interlocutory orders, may be heard by only two judges. Matters before the Court are decided according to the opinion {{of the majority of the}} members of the Court hearing the case. If there are only two judges hearing an appeal and <b>they</b> <b>disagree,</b> the appeal is dismissed and the decision appealed against stands. Proceedings in the High Court are heard before a single judge, unless otherwise provided by any written law. A Judge of Appeal may also sit in the High Court as a Judge.|$|E
