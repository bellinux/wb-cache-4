Low blade twist is beneficial in terms of forward-flight performance, which, combined with a deployable flap, could also offer good hover performance, resulting in an overall better design in comparison with a plain <b>twisted</b> <b>blade.</b> To evaluate this concept, a parametric study of flap configurations was conducted using a simple blade-element method based on computational-fluid-dynamics-generated two-dimensional aerodynamics. This simple model indicated that up to 6 deg of blade twist could be recovered at high rotor thrust by using an optimized flap configuration. Performance improvements were also obtained for outboard slotted-flap configurations. The optimum slotted-flap designs were also evaluated using three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics, which confirmed that an inboard flap combined with a low-twist (7 deg) rotor blade matched {{the performance of a}} plain blade with - 13 deg of twist.

40|$|High-speed flow {{visualization}} and high-resolution particle image velocimetry {{experiments were}} conducted on a two-bladed rotor that was operated in a hovering state, both out of ground effect (well away from the ground) and in ground effect at several rotor heights. Recent advances in flow diagnostic instrumentation allowed measurements of the rotor wake to be performed with unprecedented levels of resolution. In particular, {{the goal of the}} present work was {{to gain a better understanding}} of the fluid dynamics of the wake sheets (and the blade tip vortices) that were trailed from the blades. The present work examined the effects produced by two blade sets: 1. A baseline untwisted blade, 2. A <b>twisted</b> <b>blade</b> with - 17 ^∘ of linear twist, and has revealed fluid dynamic details of the wake sheet that were hitherto unknown. For the measurements made with the rotor operating out of ground effect, the blade sets were tested at two blade loading coefficients of 0. 053 and 0. 08, although only the higher loading condition was tested with the rotors operating in ground effect. For the rotor operating out of ground effect, a helicoidal tip vortex was shown to form at the blade tip and the associated wake sheets were initially laid down as small-scale counterrotating vortical pairs. However, this initial vorticity quickly diffused and the sheet was then convected as a concentrated bands of turbulence, including several dominant eddies. Several types of sheet dynamics were documented in the rotor wake, including sheet interactions with the tip vortices, the detailed behavior of this interaction depending on both the blade twist and the rotor thrust. At earlier wake ages, a sinusoidal wave-like perturbation was seen to be formed on the wake sheets, although the growth in wave amplitude was limited as the sheets were convected and stretched in the velocity gradients in the downstream wake. When the rotor was operated in ground effect, the vorticity in the wake sheets persisted to much older wake ages. Wave-like perturbations did not form on the wake sheets when the rotors were operating in ground effect because the outward radial stretching of the rotor wake in the presence of the ground suppressed their development. The wake sheets were found to convect to the ground and introduce significant vorticity into the near-wall flow field closer to the rotor, contributing to fluctuations in the local flow velocities. The flow field near the ground was also observed to be significantly affected by the use of twist on the blade, with the wake impinging on the ground further inboard and closer to the rotor, which also resulted in higher flow velocities being produced further downstream...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the initial {{development of an}} optimization framework for designing active <b>twist</b> helicopter rotor <b>blade</b> cross sections with embedded anisotropic piezocomposite actuators. Optimum design of active <b>twist</b> <b>blades</b> is a complex task, since it involves a rich design space with tightly coupled design variables, e. g., the simple orientation of the actuators affects the blade natural frequencies. Therefore, it becomes advantageous to apply the principle of mathematical optimization to the design task. In the proposed framework, the blade cross-sectional internal layout is designed to maximize the static twist actuation while satisfying a series of blade requirements. These requirements are associated with locations {{of the center of}} gravity and elastic axis, blade mass per unit span, fundamental rotating blade frequencies, and the blade strength based on local three-dimensional stress and strain fields under worst loading conditions.

40|$|The {{majority}} of present-day {{horizontal axis wind turbine}} blade tips are simple designs based on historical trends. There is, however, {{some evidence that}} varying the design of the tip can result in significant changes in performance characteristics such as power output, noise, and structural loading. Very few studies have tested this idea on an actual rotating blade and there is much to be investigated. Thus, a project was devised to examine experimentally the effect of various tip designs on an operational rotating wind turbine rotor. A tapered, <b>twisted</b> <b>blade</b> 1. 6 m in length was custom designed for use in the UW Wind Energy Research Facility using the blade element momentum (BEM) method. A coupling mechanism was designed such that the outer 10 % of each blade could be exchanged to evaluate the effect of different tip designs. A set of three blades was fabricated out of fibre-reinforced plastic, while the tips were machined out of maple wood on a CNC milling machine. The blade was evaluated with a standard rectangular tip to establish baseline performance against which to compare the alternative tip configurations. The three-bladed rotor was tested at shaft speeds from 100 rpm to 240 rpm in wind speeds up to the facility maximum of 11. 1 m/s. The rotor was found to have a maximum power coefficient of 0. 42 at a tip speed ratio of 5. 3 and a 1. 45 kW rated power at a wind speed of 11 m/s. The performance was compared to predictions made using the BEM method with airfoil data generated using a modified Viterna method and the Aerodas method. While the Aerodas data was capable of predicting the power fairly accurately from 5 m/s to 10 m/s, the modified Viterna method predicted the entire curve much more accurately. Two winglet designs were also tested. The first (called Maniaci) was designed by David Maniaci of Pennsylvania State University and the other (called Gertz) was designed by the author. Both winglets were found to augment the power by roughly 5 % at wind speeds between 6. 5 m/s and 9. 5 m/s, while performance was decreased above and below this speed range. It was calculated that the annual energy production could be increased using the Maniaci and Gertz winglets by 2. 3 % and 3 %, respectively. Considering the preliminary nature of the study the results are encouraging and it is likely that more optimal winglet designs could be designed and evaluated using the same method. More generally, this study proved that the blades with interchangeable tips are capable of being used as an evaluation testbed for alternative wind turbine blade tip designs...|$|E
40|$|The current {{generation}} of wind turbines that are being deployed around the world features, almost exclusively, a three-bladed rotor with a horizontal-axis configuration. In recent years, however, a resurgence {{of interest in the}} vertical-axis wind turbine configuration has been prompted by some of its inherent advantages over horizontal-axis rotors, particularly in flow conditions that are typical of the urban environment. The accurate modelling of the aerodynamics of vertical-axis wind turbines poses a significant challenge. The cyclic motion of the turbine induces large variations in the angle of attack on the blades during each rotor revolution that result in significant unsteadiness in their aerodynamic loading. In addition, aerodynamic interactions occur between the blades of the turbine and the wake that is generated by the rotor. Interactions between the blades of the turbine and, in particular, tip vortices that were trailed in previous revolutions produce impulsive variations in the blade aerodynamic loading, but these interactions are notoriously difficult to simulate accurately. This dissertation describes the application of a simulation tool, the Vorticity Transport Model (VTM), to the prediction of the aerodynamic performance of three different vertical-axis wind turbines - one with straight blades, another with curved blades and a third with a helically <b>twisted</b> <b>blade</b> configuration - when their rotors are operated in three different conditions. These operating conditions were chosen to be representative of the flow conditions that a vertical-axis wind turbine is likely to encounter in the urban environment. Results of simulations are shown {{for each of the three}} different turbine configurations when the rotor is operated in oblique flow, in other words when the wind vector is non-perpendicular to the axis of rotation of the rotor, and also when subjected to unsteady wind. The performance of the straight-bladed turbine when it is influenced by the wake of another rotor is also discussed. The capability of the VTM to simulate the flow surrounding vertical-axis wind turbines has been enhanced by a dynamic stall model that was implemented in the course of this research in order to account for the effects of large, transient variations of the angle of attack on the aerodynamic loading on the turbine blades. It is demonstrated that helical blade twist reduces the oscillation of the power coefficient that is an inherent feature of turbines with non-twisted blades. It is also found that the variation in the blade aerodynamic loading that is caused by the continuous variation of the angle of attack on the blades during each revolution is much larger, and thus far more significant, than that which is induced by an unsteady wind or by an interaction with the wake that is produced by another rotor. Furthermore, it is shown that a vertical-axis turbine that is operated in oblique flow can, potentially, produce a higher power coefficient compared to the operation in conditions in which the wind vector is perpendicular to the axis of rotation, when the ratio between the height of the turbine and the radius of the rotor is sufficiently low.

40|$|This Master Thesis {{has been}} carried out at Chalmers University of Technology in Göteborg and GKN Aerospace in Trollhättan during the spring of 2015. The aim was to {{identify}} the effects of as-manufactured geometry and mechanical deformation on the aerodynamic performance of a double blade swept propeller, also called "Boxprop". The Boxprop is a new high speed propeller concept that was developed by Richard Avellan and Anders Lundbladh at Volvo Aero Corporation in Trollhättan, now GKN Aerospace Sweden. In the past, research has been focused mainly on jet engines, since propeller driven aircraft only form {{a small part of the}} commercial air traffic. Nevertheless, propellers have high propulsive efficiencies due to low operating pressure ratios, which is of interest in terms of a reduction of emissions and noise. The blades of conventional high speed propellers are swept rearwards whereas the Boxprop comprises forward swept blades that are joined at the tip. The forward sweep is supposed to have a positive influence at the tip flow but the drawbacks are usually aerodynamic instabilities and flutter. These disadvantages may be eliminated by the joined blade tips which make the Boxblade geometry stiffer and improves the stability. Chalmers University of Technology in Göteborg and GKN Aerospace collaborate in the NFFP iFram project to develop the Boxprop concept further. Previous master theses' showed discrepancies between CFD simulation results and experimental testing. By realising further CFD simulations and static as well as dynamic experimental tests, these differences could be identified and thus be considered in further research. The CFD simulations yielded that roughness of the propeller blades may reduce the turbo efficiency up to 15 %, and causes an increase in propeller torque as well as a decrease in propeller thrust. Those values change in function of the employed advance ratio of the propeller. Another contributing factor that could be identified was the geometry of the nacelle, which causes a light increase in performance due to lower local wind speed in front of the propeller. Last but not least, also the deformation of the blade causes an increase in performance, due to a larger diameter when deformed. The performance is also influenced by the change of the angle of the leading edge, resulting in slightly <b>twisted</b> <b>blade.</b> The effect on the flow field of the deformed GPX- 313 can only be estimated, since it would involve an extended analysis of various blade sections in CFD that could not be realised in the time available. Experiments with Boxprops made out of rigid opaque material with a diameter of 0 : 15 m and 0 : 3 m have been realised statically and in the Chalmers L 2 wind tunnel at speeds up to 40 m=s and a rotational tip speed up to 210 m=s, corresponding to up to 26000 rpm rotational speed, to further study the performance of the Boxprop. An analysis of the flow field in the propeller swirl of the propeller was carried out with a stereo PIV, studying a plane along the wind tunnel flow field. Surface roughness measurements and 3 D scans have been conducted on Boxprop blades to identify manufactured defects that can have impact on aerodynamic performance. FE simulations were done to calculate deformation of a Boxprop due to rotational load during testing. Polished and non-polished blades have been compared experimentally to test the impact of decreased roughness. The ability to conduct experiments in the Chalmers wind tunnel gave comparable experimental results for various advance ratios to verify the performance of the propeller. Considering roughness effects and disturbances in material deformation and flow field, the experimental results are on the same level as the results from the CFD simulations...|$|E
40|$|Ever {{since the}} early days of {{helicopter}} flight vibrations and noise have been issues. One major source for helicopter noise and vibration is the main rotor. Individual blade control (IBC) in general tackles noise and vibration of rotary wing aircrafts. The architecture of IBC systems evolved from actuated pitch links to active flaps and active twist. The active <b>twist</b> <b>blades</b> investigated at DLR (German Aerospace Center) are actuated by piezoelectric Macro Fiber Composite Actuators that are integrated into the skin of the rotor blades. Unfortunately some advantages of the active twist concept like: distributed actuation without big local strains or no moving components are also causing some challenges in the control of the actuation. Even though a feedforward control of the actuation voltage can be realized easily it is quite difficult to find a physical value that is suited to close the control loop. As the angle of attack at the blade tip has a big influence on the trajectory of the vortices the tip twist angle of the blade is identified to be controlled. But since the twist is generated over the whole span of the blade, it is not possible to measure the actuation amplitude at a discrete hinge as for an active flap. The fact that the active <b>twist</b> <b>blades</b> investigated at DLR are model scale blades causes additional challenges due to the high centrifugal forces and the limitations in size. Within this paper the requirements on a measurement system for the detection of the tip twist angle of an active <b>twist</b> <b>blade</b> in model scale will be elucidated. As the next step in the development of the active <b>twist</b> <b>blades</b> at DLR are wind tunnel tests, the system should work at least under wind tunnel forward flight conditions. First two optical measurement methods for the detection of the tip twist at one azimuth position will be introduced and compared. Those techniques are serving as a reference later on. From the intention to control the tip twist in a closed loop, arises the need for a continuous measurement of the tip twist angle. In a first approach accelerometers were used to detect the flap wise accelerations at the leading and trailing edge of the blade tip. The results of those measurements will be compared to the optical reference and the limitations of this principle will be shown. Another way to estimate the motion of the blade tip is the use of strain gauge data. Theoretically the moments measured by the strain gauges can be integrated to a deformation when the distribution of the stiffness is known. The database that is needed for these investigations was established during an extensive measurement campaign performed in the DLR rotor test facility in Braunschweig between January 2009 and April 2009. The challenges related to the analysis of this data for an active <b>twist</b> rotor <b>blade</b> will be pointed out. A possible solution will be investigated and restrictions on the applicability of this measurement method will be made...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{introduces the}} process of optimizing active <b>twist</b> rotor <b>blades</b> {{in the presence of}} embedded anisotropic piezo-composite actuators. Optimum design of active <b>twist</b> <b>blades</b> is a complex task, since it involves a rich design space with tightly coupled design variables. The study presents the development of an optimization framework for active helicopter rotor blade cross-sectional design. This optimization framework allows for exploring a rich and highly nonlinear design space in order to optimize the active <b>twist</b> rotor <b>blades.</b> Different analytical components are combined in the framework: cross-sectional analysis (UM/VABS), an automated mesh generator, a beam solver (DYMORE), a three-dimensional local strain recovery module, and a gradient based optimizer within MATLAB. Through the mathematical optimization problem, the static twist actuation performance of a blade is maximized while satisfying a series of blade constraints. These constraints are associated with locations of the center of gravity and elastic axis, blade mass per unit span, fundamental rotating blade frequencies, and the blade strength based on local three-dimensional strain fields under worst loading conditions. Through pre-processing, limitations of the proposed process have been studied. When limitations were detected, resolution strategies were proposed. These include mesh overlapping, element distortion, trailing edge tab modeling, electrode modeling and foam implementation of the mesh generator, and the initial point sensibility of the current optimization scheme. Examples demonstrate the effectiveness of this process. Optimization studies were performed on the NASA/Army/MIT ATR blade case. Even though that design was built and shown significant impact in vibration reduction, the proposed optimization process showed that the design could be improved significantly. The second example, based on a model scale of the AH- 64 D Apache blade, emphasized the capability of this framework to explore the nonlinear design space of complex planform. Especially for this case, detailed design is carried out to make the actual blade manufacturable. The proposed optimization framework is shown to be an effective tool to design high authority active <b>twist</b> <b>blades</b> to reduce vibration in future helicopter rotor blades...|$|R
