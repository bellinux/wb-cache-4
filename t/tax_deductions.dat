The Australian government had {{for many years}} been encouraging agricultural and forestry investment schemes by allowing investors to claim up-front <b>tax</b> <b>deductions</b> {{of the costs of}} investment. Investors paid Great Southern a fee to lease plantation woodlots. Great Southern managed the woodlot, and the investor could deduct the cost of the lease from the income they declared that year for tax assessment purposes. The tax deductible status of the investment was widely regarded as the main attraction of MIS schemes to investors.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to study elderly people’s {{experiences}} of and approach to their usage of home care services with <b>tax</b> <b>deduction.</b> The aim was also to describe how elderly people reason about their underlying motives of using home care service with <b>tax</b> <b>deduction.</b> The study is based on six qualitative interviews with people {{between the ages of}} 65 and 80, living in Nacka, Sweden. This thesis is a collaboration with Stiftelsen Stockholms läns Äldrecentrum/ Stockholm Gerontology Center and part of their follow up study concerning simplified administration for elderly people applying for home care services in Nacka. The theory of rational choice was used in the analysis of the results. The primary results showed that elderly people’s usage of home care services with <b>tax</b> <b>deduction</b> was limited though regular and consist mainly of basic domestic work. The overall experiences of using home care services with <b>tax</b> <b>deduction</b> were positive and described in terms of satisfaction and as a possibility of independence and influence regarding their needs of services and how they were executed. The results indicate that the usage of home care services with <b>tax</b> <b>deduction</b> is partly based on elderly people’s lack of confidence in publicly-financed elderly care. Due to the distrust in elderly care and the self-determing factors home care services with <b>tax</b> <b>deduction</b> generated, their choice of using home care services with <b>tax</b> <b>deduction</b> seemed more appealing than publicly-financed home care services. ...|$|R

The government provided RS$1,500 (US$420) to every family whose hut collapsed during the storm, and RS$100,000 (US$2,857) to the family of every person killed by the storm. However, there were also reports of people stealing bodies to receive the payment. The federal government provided about US$12million to the state, as well as <b>tax</b> <b>deductions</b> for monetary donations. Former Union Minister Rangaiah Naidu opined that the state government overinflated the damage estimates to qualify for additional aid, in part due to the government spending annual disaster subsidies for salaries. The World Bank credited the government's experience with disasters as saving lives, although the response to the disaster was largely in repairing damage, rather than mitigating against future storms. The storm also demonstrated the region's outdated infrastructure.|$|E
