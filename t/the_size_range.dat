5|$|The Nile {{crocodile}} has {{a reputation}} as the biggest killer of large animals, including humans, on the African continent. It is widely distributed, found in many habitats and cryptically coloured. From a waiting position with only its eyes and nostrils above the water, it can lunge at drinking animals, fishermen, bathers, or people collecting water or washing clothes. Once seized and dragged into the water, there is little chance for the victim to escape. Analysis of attacks show that most take place during the breeding season or when crocodiles are guarding nests or newly hatched young. Although many attacks go unreported, there are estimated to be over 300 per year, 63% of which are fatal. Wild saltwater crocodiles in Australia carried out 62 confirmed and unprovoked attacks causing injury or death between 1971 and 2004. These animals have also caused fatalities in Malaysia, New Guinea, and elsewhere. They are highly territorial and resent intrusion into their territories by other crocodiles, humans, or boats such as canoes. Attacks may come from animals of various sizes, but the larger males are generally responsible for fatalities. As their size increases, so does their need for larger mammalian prey; pigs, cattle, horses, and humans are all within <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>range</b> they seek. Most of the people attacked were either swimming or wading, but in two instances they were asleep in tents.|$|E
5|$|Debate has {{occurred}} regarding whether the sea mink was its own species, or a subspecies of the American mink. Those {{who argue that}} the sea mink was a subspecies often {{refer to it as}} Neovison vison macrodon. A study in 1911 by Frederic Brewster Loomis, an American paleontologist, concluded that the differences between the American mink and the sea mink were too minute to justify the latter's classification as a separate species, and he named it Lutreola vison antiquus. A study conducted in 2000 by Mead et al. refuted Loomis by claiming that <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>range</b> for the largest sea mink specimen was beyond that of the American mink, thereby making it a separate species. But a 2001 study by Graham concluded that this size difference was insufficient evidence to classify the sea mink as its own species and that it should be considered a subspecies. Graham supposed that the size difference was caused by environmental factors. Furthermore, Graham reported that Mead assumed the smaller mink specimens to be the American mink, and the larger mink specimens outside the range of the American mink to be sea minks; this may have been a case of sexual dimorphism wherein all specimens were sea minks, the larger being male and the smaller being female. A 2007 study compared the dental makeup of the sea mink to the American mink, and concluded that they were distinct enough to be considered separate species.|$|E

Larger hooks are referenced by increasing whole numbers followed by a slash and a zero (e.g. 1/0 (one aught), 2/0, 3/0...) as their size increases. The numbers represent relative sizes, normally associated with the gap (the distance from the point tip to the shank). The smallest size available is 32 and largest 20/0.|$|E
25|$|Ceramic {{capacitors}} {{are composed}} of a mixture of finely ground granules of paraelectric or ferroelectric materials, appropriately mixed with other materials to achieve the desired characteristics. From these powder mixtures, the ceramic is sintered at high temperatures. The ceramic forms the dielectric {{and serves as a}} carrier for the metallic electrodes. The minimum thickness of the dielectric layer, which today (2013) for low voltage capacitors is in <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>range</b> of 0.5 micrometers is limited downwards by the grain size of the ceramic powder. The thickness of the dielectric for capacitors with higher voltages is determined by the dielectric strength of the desired capacitor.|$|E

25|$|The fly {{pattern is}} {{the recipe for}} any {{particularly}} named fly. In older literature, especially prior to the 20th century, fly patterns were referred to as dressings. The pattern specifies <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>range</b> and type of hook to be used, materials including type, color and size, {{and in some cases}} specific instructions to achieve a particular effect or configuration. Fly patterns allow tyers to consistently reproduce any given fly over time. A Light Cahill dry fly produced by one tyer will look remarkably similar to the same fly produced by a completely different tyer if the pattern is followed with reasonable accuracy and with comparable materials. Patterns may also lay out alternatives for different materials and variations.|$|E
25|$|A {{cleanroom}} {{or clean}} room is an environment, typically used in manufacturing, including of pharmaceutical products or scientific research, {{as well as}} aerospace semiconductor engineering applications with {{a low level of}} environmental pollutants such as dust, airborne microbes, aerosol particles, and chemical vapors. More accurately, a cleanroom has a controlled level of contamination that is specified by the number of particles per cubic meter at a specified particle size. To give perspective, the ambient air outside in a typical urban environment contains 35,000,000 particles per cubic meter in <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>range</b> 0.5μm and larger in diameter, corresponding to an ISO 9 cleanroom, while an ISO 1 cleanroom allows no particles in that size range and only 12 particles per cubic meter of 0.3μm and smaller.|$|E

25|$|The gall growth first {{appears as}} a rounded mass of green plant tissue on the leaf buds of the oak, later {{becoming}} hard and brown, being up to approximately 25mm / 1 inch in diameter. Although nearly spherical, the galls often {{have a number of}} little flattened nodules. The rounded growths are filled with a spongy mass and a single wasp larva is located in a hard seed-like cell in the centre. The word 'marble' derives from the gall's shape, which is a marble-like rounded structure. As stated, although normally distinctive the oak marble gall can, under some growth conditions, be mistaken for the oak apple gall, caused by a number of gall wasps, such as Biorhiza pallida. This {{may be due to the}} observer's unfamiliarity with the true oak apple gall which grows to be somewhat larger, has red markings, but does grow on the axillary or terminal buds. The galls sometimes coalesce. The non-parasitised specimens are at the largest end of <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>range.</b>|$|E
25|$|In response, Weber et al. {{conducted}} a survey the same year comparing the computer model of LB1's skull {{with a sample of}} microcephalic human skulls, concluding that the skull size of LB1 falls in the middle of <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>range</b> of the human samples and is not inconsistent with microcephaly. Next to dispute the finding of Falk et al. (2005) were Martin et al. (2006), who objected to the failure to compare the model of LB1's skull with a typical example of adult microcephaly. Martin and his coauthors concluded that the skull was probably microcephalic, arguing that the brain is far too small to be a separate dwarf species; if it were, the 400-cubic-centimeter brain would indicate a creature only one foot in height, one-third the size of the discovered skeleton. Shortly thereafter, a group of scientists from Indonesia, Australia, and the United States came to the same conclusion by examining bone and skull structure (Jacob (2006)).|$|E

40|$|Experiments were {{designed}} to investigate size-selective predation by medium (40 - 55 mm carapace width) and large (55 - 70 mm) Carcinus maenas when feeding on four bivalves of contrasting shell morphologies, mussel, Mytilus edulis, flat oyster Ostrea edulis, Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas, and edible cockle Cerastoderma edule. Medium-sized crabs preferred mussels 5 - 15 mm shell length (maximum shell dimension) and cockles 5 - 10 mm long, whereas large crabs preferred mussels 15 - 25 mm and cockles 10 - 20 mm long. Generally, no preference was shown for any particular size of either species of oyster. Comparisons amongst <b>the</b> preferred <b>size</b> <b>ranges</b> of prey showed that crab preference for a particular <b>size</b> <b>range</b> of prey was more strongly related to the minimum than to the maximum shell dimension, and that the minimum shell dimension was always equivalent to, or smaller than: the maximum {{cross section of the}} crabs' chelae. <b>The</b> <b>size</b> <b>ranges</b> of M. edulis and C. edule selected by C. maenas either clearly corresponded to, or were slightly smaller than, <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>ranges</b> of prey with the highest profitability (= dry weight consumed per unit of handling time).

500|$|Remains of Plesiorycteropus {{have been}} misidentified as rodents and primates. Charles Immanuel Forsyth Major {{described}} Myoryctes rapeto in 1908 as a [...] "giant subfossil rat" [...] {{on the basis}} of two innominate bones (pelvic bones). The generic name was replaced by Majoria in 1915, because Myoryctes was preoccupied by the name of a nematode worm. However, according to MacPhee, innominates of Majoria are identical to those assigned to Plesiorycteropus. Guillaume Grandidier assigned a well-preserved femur (upper leg bone) to a gigantic relative of the living votsovotsa (Hypogeomys antimena), a large rodent, which he described as Hypogeomys boulei. Lamberton identified this femur as Plesiorycteropus and MacPhee concurred. Remains of both Majoria rapeto and Hypogeomys boulei fall at the upper end of <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>range</b> of the genus, indicating that they are referable to P.madagascariensis. Another Plesiorycteropus innominate was mistakenly assigned to Daubentonia robusta, the extinct giant aye-aye, and other material has been misidentified as of a dwarf lemur (Cheirogaleus).|$|E
