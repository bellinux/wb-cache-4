The cotton rat is classified in the family Cricetidae (with hamsters and gerbils) and is a distant cousin of the common laboratory rat (Rattus) classified in the family Muridae (with the common laboratory mouse, Mus). Antibody reagents that are specific for cotton rat immunoglobulins have not been described. To enhance the usefulness of this model, four immunoglobulins in Sigmodon serum were characterized (IgG 1, IgG 2, IgA, IgM) and antisera specific for each immunoglobulin were made. Sera from three different species of Sigmodon were examined, S. hispidus (SH), <b>S.</b> arizoni (<b>SA)</b> <b>and</b> <b>S.</b> fulviventer (SF).

In vitro this protein kinase phosphorylates ribosomal {{proteins}} <b>Sa</b> <b>and</b> <b>S</b> 2 <b>and</b> vaccinia virus protein H 5 R, proteins that become phosphorylated during infection. Nothing {{is known about}} the sites phosphorylated on these proteins or the general substrate specificity of the kinase. The work described is the first to address these questions. Results Vaccinia virus protein H 5 R was phosphorylated by the B 1 R protein kinase in vitro, digested with V 8 protease, and phosphopeptides separated by HPLC. The N -terminal sequence of one radioactively labelled phosphopeptide was determined and found to correspond to residues 81 - 87 of the protein, with Thr- 84 and Thr- 85 being phosphorylated. A synthetic peptide based on this region of the protein was shown to be a substrate for the B 1 R protein kinase, and the extent of phosphorylation was substantially decreased if either Thr residue was replaced by an Ala. Conclusions We have identified the first phosphorylation site for the vaccinia virus B 1 R protein kinase. This gives important information about the substrate-specificity of the enzyme, which differs from that of other known protein kinases.

Models have been improved to be chemically consistent, i. e. we use evolutionary tracks, yields, lifetimes and remnant masses for the metallicity calculated at the time of birth for respective stars. Metallicity dependent stellar yields and remnant masses for massive stars (M ≥ 12 ∗ M⊙) are taken from Weaver & Woosley[5]. For lower mass stars data from van den Hoek & Groenewegen[4] are incorporated. Updated SN Ia contributions are taken from Nomoto et al. [2].

40|$|The {{accumulation}} of independent mutations {{over time in}} two populations often leads to reproductive isolation. Reproductive isolation between diverging populations may be reinforced by barriers that occur either pre- or postzygotically. Hybrid sterility {{is the most common}} form of postzygotic isolation in plants. Four postzygotic sterility loci, comprising three hybrid sterility systems (Sa, s 5, DPL), have been recently identified in Oryza sativa. These loci explain, in part, the limited hybridization that occurs between the domesticated cultivated rice varieties, O. sativa spp. japonica and O. sativa spp. indica. In the United States, cultivated fields of japonica rice are often invaded by conspecific weeds that have been shown to be of indica origin. Crop-weed hybrids have been identified in crop fields, but at low frequencies. Here we examined the possible role of these hybrid incompatibility loci in the interaction between cultivated and weedy rice. We identified a novel allele at Sa that seemingly prevents loss of fertility in hybrids. Additionally, we found wide-compatibility type alleles at strikingly high frequencies at the <b>Sa</b> <b>and</b> <b>s</b> 5 loci in weed groups, and a general lack of incompatible alleles between crops and weeds at the DPL loci. Our results suggest that weedy individuals, particularly those of the SH and BRH groups, should be able to freely hybridize with the local japonica crop, and that prezygotic factors, such as differences in flowering time, have been more important in limiting weed-crop gene flow in the past.

The development and spread of pathogenic bacteria that are resistant to the existing catalog of antibiotics is a major public health threat. Biofilms are complex, sessile communities of bacteria embedded in an organic polymer matrix which serve to further enhance antimicrobial resistance. Consequently, novel compounds and innovative methods are urgently required to arrest the proliferation of drug-resistant infections in both nosocomial and community environments. Accordingly, {{it has been suggested}} that antimicrobial peptides could be used as novel natural inhibitors that can be used in formulations with synergistically acting antibiotics. Nisin is a member of the lantibiotic family of antimicrobial peptides that exhibit potent antibacterial activity against many Gram-positive bacteria. Recently we have used bioengineering strategies to enhance the activity of nisin against several high profile targets, including multi-drug resistant clinical pathogens such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycinresistant enterococci, staphylococci, and streptococci associated with bovine mastitis. We have also identified nisin derivatives with an enhanced ability to impair biofilm formation and to reduce the density of established biofilms of methicillin resistant S. pseudintermedius. The present study was aimed at evaluating the potential of nisin and nisin derivatives to increase the efficacy of conventional antibiotics and to assess the possibility of killing and/or eradicating biofilm-associated cells of a variety of staphylococcal targets. Growth curve-based comparisons established that combinations of derivatives nisin V C penicillin or nisin I 4 V C chloramphenicol had an enhanced inhibitory effect against <b>S.</b> aureus <b>SA</b> 113 <b>and</b> <b>S.</b> pseudintermedius DSM 21284, respectively, compared to the equivalent nisin A C antibiotic combinations or when each antimicrobial was administered alone.

This method provides strong motion generation areas that reproduce near-source ground motions in a broadband period range(0. 1 ～ 10 sec). The storong motion generation areas roughly coincide with the asperity areas where stresses are largely released. Fault parameters of the asperity source model are outer fault parameters (entire source area and total seismic moment) and inner fault prameters (area of asperities,stress drop on each asperity and short-period level of the S-wave acceleration source spectrum). We find self-similar scaling of total seismic moment to the asperity areas. The number of asperities is one for Mw 6 events,two to three for Mw 7 events and five for Mw 8 events. We also find self-similar scaling of total seismic moment to the short-period level of the S-wave acceleration source spectrum that {{is directly related to}} the asperity parameters (area of asperities and stress drop on each asperity). Further we find that the aftershock area overestimates the entire source area. This means that estimation of the entire source area is somewhat difficult for intraslab earthquakes.

(1987) Gene 61, 329 - 338] {{has suggested that the}} structures of cystatins which we determined previously at the protein level lack N-terminal peptide portions of the full-sized intact forms. In the present study, attempts were made to isolate full-sized S-type cystatins by introducing methanol fractionation into the purification steps to suppress the enzymatic activity present in saliva. Full-sized cystatin SN and two phosphorylated forms of full-sized cystatin S were thus isolated. Analysis of one fraction indicated that this was a mixture of full-sized cystatin <b>SA</b> <b>and</b> non-phosphorylated cystatin <b>S.</b> The phosphoryla-tion sites of cystatin S were determined to be Ser-Ser-Ser'(P) -Lys-Glu-Glu- for monophos-phorylated cystatin <b>S</b> <b>and</b> Ser'(P) -Ser-Ser 3 (P) -Lys-Glu-Glu- for diphosphorylated cystatin S. Immunoblotting analysis with anti-cystatin S antiserum revealed that tears and seminal plasma also contained S-type cystatins, but diphosphorylated cystatin S was detected neither in tears nor in seminal plasma and no cystatin SN was found in seminal plasma. These data indicate that S-type cystatins are secreted into the oral cavity without significant degradation in salivary glands or ducts and that they are expressed tissu...|$|R
40|$|Metal oxides structures, {{formed by}} ordered self-assembling of {{crystalline}} nanoparticles aggregates, are attracting growing attention in {{fields such as}} catalysis or solar cells. The properties of these structures are influenced not only by their morphology and nanoparticles composition {{but also by the}} assembled particles boundaries. In order to determine the influence of these boundaries on the structures properties, the present investigation has been devoted to study the characteristics of anatase nanoparticles boundaries in titania aggregates prepared by TiCl 4 hydrolysis at low temperature. Proton magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance and high resolution transmission electron microscopy show that these samples mainly contain amorphous TiO 2 strongly bound to specific faces of anatase particles. This amorphous titania-mediated attachment induces the ordered self-assembling of the anatase particles, with favored formation of mesopores in the nanoparticles boundaries. Photocatalytic degradation of 4 -methoxybenzyl alcohol in water, test reaction used as a method to get information on the boundaries properties, indicates that the mesoporous amorphous TiO 2 offers active sites for the alcohol catalytic partial oxidation, but it strongly hampers inter-particles electron transfer. These effects, characteristic of amorphous oxide chain morphology, can be expected when low dispersed dopants or promoters are incorporated to metal oxides. © 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

40|$|The {{centrosome}} is {{the primary}} microtubule organising centre of the cell. It is composed of many proteins, some of which make up {{the core of the}} centrosome, whereas others are used for specific functions. Although the cellular roles of many centrosomal proteins are well defined, much less is known about their functions {{and the role of the}} centrosome in development. In this study we investigated the function of NEDD 1, a critical component of the centrosome essential for microtubule nucleation, in zebrafish (Danio rerio) development. The zebrafish homologue of NEDD 1 (zNEDD 1) was cloned and found to have a similar localisation and function to mammalian NEDD 1. We show that zNEDD 1 is essential for survival, as a high level of knockdown was embryonic lethal. Partial knockdown of zNEDD 1 caused abnormalities including an increase in mitotic and apoptotic cells. Pronounced phenotypic defects were seen in the brain, with a lack of defined brain structures, incomplete neural tube formation and a disorganisation of neurons. In addition, we show that a reduction in zNEDD 1 resulted in the loss of c-tubulin at the centrosome. Our data thus demonstrate that zNEDD 1 is critical for the recruitment of c-tubulin to the centrosome, and is essential for the proper development of zebrafish.

40|$|Objective: Phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE 4) catabolizes {{the second}} {{messenger}} 3 &# 8242;, 5 &# 8242;-cyclic adenosine monophosphate and {{may play a}} critical role in brain diseases. Our aim was to quantify PDE 4 in rats with positron emission tomography (PET). Methods: High (n = 6) and low specific activity (SA) (n = 2) higher affinity ((R) -[11 C]rolipram) <b>and</b> high <b>SA</b> lower affinity ((S) -[11 C]rolipram) (n = 2) enantiomers were intravenously administered to Sprague&# 8211;Dawley rats. Brain data were acquired using the ATLAS PET scanner and reconstructed using the 3 D-ordered subset expectation maximization algorithm. Arterial samples were taken to measure unmetabolized [11 C]rolipram. Total distribution volumes (VT&# 8242;) were calculated using a 1 -tissue compartment (1 C) and an unconstrained 2 -tissue compartment (2 C) model. Results: High SA R experiments showed later and greater brain uptake, and slower washout than low <b>SA</b> R <b>and</b> <b>S</b> experiments. In all regions and in all experiments, the 2 C model gave significantly better fitting than the 1 C model. The poor fitting by the latter caused underestimation of VT&# 8242; by 19 &# 8211; 31 %. The 2 C model identified VT&# 8242; reasonably well with coefficients of variation less than 10 %. VT&# 8242; values by this model were 16. 4 &# 8211; 29. 2 mL/cm 3 in high SA R, 2. 9 &# 8211; 3. 5 in low <b>SA</b> R, <b>and</b> 3. 1 &# 8211; 3. 7 in S experiments. Conclusions: Specific binding of (R) -[11 C]rolipram was accurately measured in living rats. In high SA R experiments, not, vert, similar 86 % of VT&# 8242; was specific binding. Distribution and changes of PDE 4 in animal models can now be studied by measuring VT&# 8242; of high SA (R) -[11 C]rolipram...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The use of {{efflux pump}} inhibitors {{may be a}} {{powerful}} strategy to overcome transporter-mediated bacterial multidrug resistance. In the present study, {{we set out to}} investigate the potency of tariquidar, a third-generation P-glycoprotein inhibitor in clinical development, for overcoming bacterial resistance towards ciprofloxacin. Methods: Staphylococcus aureus 29213 (<b>SA</b> 29213) <b>and</b> <b>S.</b> aureus 1199 B (SA 1199 B), which overexpresses the multidrug transporter NorA, as well as Pseudomonas aeruginosa 27853 and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia BAA- 85, which expresses SmeDEF, were exposed to ciprofloxacin in the presence and absence of tariquidar or, for comparative reasons, elacridar. Activity of both P-glycoprotein inhibitors was evaluated by determination of MICs and time-kill curves, and by quantification of uptake of ciprofloxacin into bacterial cells. Results: Activity of tariquidar and elacridar was comparable for <b>S.</b> aureus strains, <b>and</b> both dose-dependently increased susceptibility towards ciprofloxacin. Highest effects were observed for SA 1199 B, where the addition of tariquidar resulted in a 10 -fold reduction of the ciprofloxacin MIC, while no effect was observed for P. aeruginosa. For S. maltophilia, elacridar but not tariquidar improved susceptibility. Uptake of [(14) C] ciprofloxacin and modification of susceptibility showed significant correlations (r = 0. 89, P < 0. 0001). Tariquidar had no intrinsic activity against any strain tested. Conclusions: We conclude that tariquidar has potent inhibitory effect against certain bacterial efflux pumps in vitro. Their high activity at clinically achievable concentrations might yield this class of drugs promising for future applications in infectious diseases...|$|R

The different proteoforms of these protein families were expressed according to this order: aPRPs(PRH 2 locus[1]) and g-PRP(PRB 3 locus) before 195 days of PCA; histatin 1 and statherin at 210 - 220 days of PCA; aPRPs (PRH 1 locus) at normal term of delivery (270 - 280 days of PCA); cystatin S proteoforms after normal term of delivery;bPRPs (PRB 1, PRB 2 and PRB 4 loci) later, reaching adult levels after puberty [2]. All S 100 A 9 proteoformswere highly abundant in pre-term newborn saliva, their concentration decreasing as a function of PCA [3]. The PTMsevaluation of various proteoforms highlighted that the Golgi casein kinase (Fam 20 C [4]), responsible for the aPRPs, histatin 1, statherin and cystatin Sphosphorylation, is poorly active during fetal development.
