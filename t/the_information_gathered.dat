5|$|The Puerto Rico Breeding Bird Survey (PRBBS), {{established}} in 1997, {{is a program}} {{with the purpose of}} monitoring the status and trends of Puerto Rican breeding bird populations. <b>The</b> <b>information</b> <b>gathered</b> by these surveys is used by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) to assess bird conservation priorities. Other conservation programs by the USFWS include the Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands Migratory Bird Conservation and the maintenance of 5 wildlife refuges at Cabo Rojo, Laguna Cartagena, Vieques, Culebra and Desecheo. Other institutions supporting bird conservation in Puerto Rico are the Puerto Rican Ornithological Society and the Puerto Rico National History Association.|$|E
5|$|The first {{spacecraft}} to explore Jupiter was Pioneer 10, which flew past {{the planet in}} December 1973, followed by Pioneer 11 twelve months later. Pioneer 10 obtained the first-ever close-up images of Jupiter and its Galilean moons; the spacecraft studied the planet's atmosphere, detected its magnetic field, observed its radiation belts and determined that Jupiter is mainly fluid. Pioneer 11 made its closest approach, within some 34,000km of Jupiter's cloud tops, on December 4, 1974. It obtained dramatic images of the Great Red Spot, made the first observation of Jupiter's immense polar regions, and determined the mass of Jupiter's moon Callisto. <b>The</b> <b>information</b> <b>gathered</b> by these two spacecraft helped astronomers and engineers improve the design of future probes to cope more effectively with the environment around the giant planet.|$|E
5|$|The various {{agencies}} {{that participated in}} Operation PBHistory had different aims in mind for {{the products of the}} operation. The CIA was most interested in using <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>gathered</b> against communist movements in Latin America and elsewhere. The State Department wanted to use them to reconstruct the history of the communist party within Guatemala, while the highest priority of the United States Information Agency was to use the documents to release information {{that could be used to}} change international opinion. The agents in charge of the operation were expected to balance these various interests: however, as the organization behind the operation, the CIA had veto power over any public use. The work done by the PBHistory team assisted two existing CIA operations, Operation Kufire and Operation Kugown, both of which had been a part of Operation PBSUCCESS.|$|E
