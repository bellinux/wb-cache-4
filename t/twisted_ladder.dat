DNA is a double-helix molecule, and its distinctive shape {{is often described}} as a <b>twisted</b> <b>ladder.</b> The outside of the <b>twisted</b> <b>ladder</b> is composed of sugar and phosphate groups, while the rungs, or steps, of the ladder are formed by two nucleobases connecting to each other via hydrogen bonds.|$|E

50|$|James Watson and Francis Crick {{determined}} {{the structure of}} DNA in 1953, using the X-ray crystallography work of Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins that indicated DNA has a helical structure (i.e., shaped like a corkscrew). Their double-helix model had two strands of DNA with the nucleotides pointing inward, each matching a complementary nucleotide on the other strand to form what look like rungs on a <b>twisted</b> <b>ladder.</b> This structure showed that genetic information exists in the sequence of nucleotides on each strand of DNA. The structure also suggested a simple method for replication: if the strands are separated, new partner strands can be reconstructed for each based on the sequence of the old strand. This property is what gives DNA its semi-conservative nature where one strand of new DNA is from an original parent strand.|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{asymptotic}} limiting function W({G}, q) = limn→ ∞ P(G, q) 1 /n, where P(G, q) is the chromatic polynomial for a graph G with n vertices. We first discuss a subtlety {{in the definition}} of W({G}, q) resulting from the fact that at certain special points qs, the following limits do not commute: limn→ ∞ limq→qs P(G, q) 1 /n ̸ = limq→qs limn→ ∞ P(G, q) 1 /n. We then present exact calculations of W({G}, q) and determine the corresponding analytic structure in the complex q plane for a number of families of graphs {G}, including circuits, wheels, biwheels, bipyramids, and (cyclic and <b>twisted)</b> <b>ladders.</b> We study the zeros of the corresponding chromatic polynomials and prove a theorem that for certain families of graphs, all but a finite number of the zeros lie exactly on a unit circle, whose position depends on the family. Using the connection of P(G, q) with the zero-temperature Potts antiferromagnet, we derive a theorem concerning the maximal finite real point of non-analyticity in W({G}, q), denoted qc and apply this theorem to deduce that qc(sq) = 3 and qc(hc) = (3 + √ 5) / 2 for the square and honeycomb lattices. Finally, numerical calculations of W(hc, q) and W(sq, q) are presented and compared with series expansions and bounds...|$|R
40|$|It {{is found}} that all the zigzag chains except the {{nonmagnetic}} (NM) Ni and antiferromagnetic (AF) Fe chains which form a <b>twisted</b> two-legger <b>ladder,</b> look like a corner-sharing triangle ribbon, and have a lower total energy than the corresponding linear chains. All the 3 d transition metals in both linear and zigzag structures have a stable or metastable ferromagnetic (FM) state. The electronic spin-polarization at the Fermi level in the FM Sc, V, Mn, Fe, Co and Ni linear chains is close to 90 % or above. In the zigzag structure, the AF state is more stable than the FM state only in the Cr chain. It is found that the shape anisotropy energy may be comparable to the electronic one and always prefers the axial magnetization in both the linear and zigzag structures. In the zigzag chains, {{there is also a}} pronounced shape anisotropy in the plane perpendicular to the chain axis. Remarkably, the axial magnetic anisotropy in the FM Ni linear chain is gigantic, being ~ 12 meV/atom. Interestingly, there is a spin-reorientation transition in the FM Fe and Co linear chains when the chains are compressed or elongated. Large orbital magnetic moment is found in the FM Fe, Co and Ni linear chains...|$|R

Across the upper part are six bleeding doves trying to fly above the walls that enclose them. A brightly lit wire-barbed doorway with black birds trying to fly in and out fills the center. A <b>ladder</b> <b>twists</b> up {{the left side of}} the painting camouflaging the sixth child and connecting it to the sixth bird. Some critics contends that the composition portrays humanity surrounded by towers of powers (walls) and its soul is arrested in flight, despair emanates from the doorway, and everything seems submerged in sanguinity (the law).” ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWithin a tight-binding Hamiltonian approach, {{we study}} the {{dynamics}} of one-electron wave packets in a <b>twisted</b> <b>ladder</b> geometry with adiabatic electron–phonon interaction. The electron–phonon coupling is {{taken into account in}} the time-dependent Schrödinger equation through a cubic nonlinearity. This physical scenario incorporates several relevant ingredients to study the electronic wave packet dynamics in DNA-like segments. In the absence of nonlinearity, a random sequence of nucleotides pairs makes the wave packets remain localized, according to the standard picture of the Anderson localization. However, when the electron–phonon interaction is turned on, Anderson localization is suppressed and a subdiffusive regime takes place. Further, we show that the wave packet trapping can be controlled by an external field perpendicular to the helicity axis of the double-strand chain...|$|E
40|$|Databases of DNA {{and protein}} {{sequences}} are growing {{at an alarming}} rate as biologists map entire genomes. Faster methods of searching these databases are becoming more important. The method of dot matrix plots provides biologists with a complete picture of homology between two DNA or protein sequences. Parallel computation provides a faster means of generating simple unfiltered plots, which can then be filtered via image processing techniques to provide the standard dot matrix plot. 1 Introduction A genome is the complete set of instructions necessary for creating an organism [1]. This set of instructions takes the form of chromosomes which consist of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and associated proteins twisted together. DNA is a string of nucleotides bonded together into a <b>twisted</b> <b>ladder</b> shape known as a double helix. Nucleotides are large molecules containing a sugar, a phosphate and one of four possible bases: adenine (A), guanine (G), thymine (T) and cytosine (C). A DNA sequence is [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This paper aims {{to offer}} a fresh {{perspective}} into {{what is at stake}} in the cross-cultural trade dispute over genetically-modified organisms (GMOs) by subjecting a particular discursive sample, the parties’ submissions to the WTO panel, to critical scrutiny. The first step involves a survey of the rhetorical strategies deployed by the parties’ in the presentation of their arguments to the Panel. Next, I embark on the task of ‘disassembling the double helix’. My use of the term ‘double helix’ in this analysis refers to the close coupling of scientific and legal discourses in the trade regime: science and law are two parallel strands of discourse wound around each other, each punctuated at intervals by key binding sites where linkages between the strands are anchored. The image I aim to conjure up is, of course, the one made famous by Watson 2 ̆ 6 Crick’s 1953 discovery of the structure of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), “the molecule that genes are made of”. A discovery which has led, inevitably, to the advances in molecular biology that give rise to the technologies so contested in their current application to the task of ‘improving’ food. This work attempts to unfurl that <b>twisted</b> <b>ladder</b> and peel apart the strands of scientific and legal discourse that are coiled together in the ‘double helix’ of international trade law dealing with environmental and health risks. The aim is to gain some clarity from the disentanglement: it is hoped that teasing the scientific from the legal discourses will expose the implicit assumptions at play when international trade tribunals turn to scientific assessment as the means of separating the legitimate from the protectionist in disputes over contested technologies...|$|E
