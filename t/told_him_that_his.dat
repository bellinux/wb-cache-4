5|$|His {{subsequent}} {{involvement in}} a conference promoting adolescent sexuality caused the party to announce that {{it would no longer}} publish his material. In March 1933 Freud <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> contract with the International Psychoanalytic Publishers to publish Character Analysis had been cancelled. Sharaf writes that this was almost certainly because of Reich's stance on teenage sex.|$|E
5|$|Bradman {{arranged}} for Lindwall {{to see his}} Melbourne masseur Ern Saunders, who restored the paceman’s leg to prime condition in a fortnight. On the public relations front, Bradman stated his firm belief in the fairness of Lindwall's delivery. During the lengthy sea voyage to England, Bradman {{emphasized the importance of}} caution with respect to his bowling action. Bradman advised Lindwall to ensure that his dragging rear right foot was further behind the line than usual to avoid being no-balled, and to refrain from bowling at full speed until the umpires were satisfied with his delivery stride. The Australian captain guaranteed Lindwall selection for the Tests and <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> first priority in the lead-in tour matches was passing the umpires' scrutiny. Bradman recalled how paceman Ernie McCormick had been no-balled 35 times in the traditional tour opener against Worcester during the 1938 campaign, destroying his confidence {{for the rest of the}} season.|$|E
5|$|After a month {{without a}} club, Foster went on trial at League One club Preston North End in November 2012, managed by former Stevenage manager Graham Westley. The trial proved successful, and he signed on non-contract {{terms with the}} club on 18 December 2012. He made his debut {{on the same day}} in a 3–3 draw against Bury in the Football League Trophy, with Preston {{progressing}} following a penalty shoot-out. After impressing in his first four matches for the club, Foster signed a permanent contract, keeping him at Preston {{for the remainder of the}} 2012–13 season. In the club's next match, on 10 January 2013, a televised 3–2 defeat to Coventry City at the Ricoh Arena in the Football League Trophy, Foster scored his only goal for Preston, briefly restoring parity in the match as Coventry scored two injury-time goals to win the match. Foster made eight appearances in all competitions during his time with the club, and at the end of the season, new Preston manager Simon Grayson <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> contract would not be renewed when it expired in June 2013.|$|E
50|$|Byrd then <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> all <b>his</b> {{men were}} hired, {{but that he}} would see what he could do.|$|R

6000|$|... "He {{calls himself}} a white man," [...] {{answered}} the Master-Attendant scornfully; [...] "but if so, it's just skin-deep and no more. I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> to <b>his</b> face too." ...|$|R
5|$|From May 1980 {{to early}} 1981 he acted as {{editor for the}} {{magazine}} POL. In 1982, {{he moved to the}} neighbouring state of Victoria, and was appointed the Director of Tourism. This sparked an outcry in South Australia due to the two states' traditional rivalry. For his part, Dunstan said that he had yearned to be given a role in shaping and building the future of his native state, but that he had been snubbed for three years. He said that public figures in South Australia had <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> high profile and ability to overshadow others could have caused a loss of face to them, and thus his departure would be seen favourably by them, while Victoria's offer gave him an opportunity to be constructive. Dunstan was appointed to the Victorian Economic Development Corporation on 12 July 1983, resigning on 23 June 1986. Dunstan stayed in the Director of Tourism role until 1986, when he returned to Adelaide after falling out with the government of John Cain. His retirement from these positions followed the provocative publication of a photograph of him with Monsignor Porcamadonna, member of the gay community Order of Perpetual Indulgence, taken after he had launched a collection of coming out stories by gay historian Gary Wotherspoon.|$|E
5|$|Some {{incidents}} in Fingleton's {{century in the}} last match of the season were also believed to have reflected badly at the selection table. Having retired hurt on 78, he returned {{the next day and}} was then dropped on 86 in the slips. Fingleton had moved out of his crease to pat out the pitch before the ball had gone dead and Victorian wicket-keeper Ben Barnett broke the stumps. A displeased Fingleton was given out by umpire George Borwick and walked off the ground, only to be called back by captain Woodfull. Fingleton refused Woodfull's offer and did not return until Woodfull successfully asked Borwick to reverse his decision. The media reported that Fingleton had quarrelled with Woodfull and several teammates <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> apparent rebuff of the national captain would prejudice his chances of selection, and the NSWCA made an inquiry into the matter; Fingleton failed to respond. During the same innings, Bradman also wrote in his newspaper report that Fingleton had been responsible for the run out of teammate Ray Rowe, which angered Fingleton for an extended period.|$|E
25|$|On 30 November 1884 Reichart {{arrived at}} Mpala, coming from Katanga, and <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> {{companion}} Richard Böhm {{had died in}} March.|$|E
60|$|Boulter, who had {{the matter}} in hand, Jobling having died some years before, <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> in <b>his</b> opinion it was rather a nice point; he would like counsel's opinion on it.|$|R
6000|$|... "He grew ill. The doctors dosed {{him with}} {{sleeping}} draughts in vain. At last they <b>told</b> <b>him</b> bluntly <b>that</b> <b>his</b> life depended upon his finding another wife, able {{and willing to}} nag him to sleep.|$|R
60|$|Kit <b>told</b> <b>him</b> {{and added}} <b>that</b> <b>his</b> uncle {{had seemed to}} get worse after {{drinking}} some wine.|$|R
25|$|Habib also {{alleged that}} at Guantanamo, he {{suffered}} both {{mental and physical}} abuse: for instance, interrogators <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> family had been killed, and he was tied to the ground while a prostitute threw menstrual blood on him.|$|E
25|$|In his Annals of the Former World, John McPhee repeats a {{story told}} to {{geologist}} David Love in the 1930s by Love's family doctor, Francis Smith, M.D., when Love was a doctoral student. Smith {{stated that he}} had just seen Cassidy who <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> face had been altered by a surgeon in Paris, and that he showed Smith a repaired bullet wound that Smith recognized as work he had previously done on Cassidy.|$|E
25|$|According to Rosenblum, in 1892 the Imperial Russian Secret Police {{arrested him}} for being a {{messenger}} for a revolutionary group, the Friends of Enlightenment. After he was released Grigory, his assumed father, <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> mother was dead and that his biological father was her Jewish doctor Mikhail A. Rosenblum. Renaming himself Sigmund Rosenblum, he faked his death in Odessa Harbour and stowed away aboard a British ship bound for South America.|$|E

25|$|The {{subscription}} {{cost for}} the newspaper was 50 cents per year and 1 dollar for a six-month subscription. Lathers was once insulted when he first started publishing his Newz paper when a local businessman <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> publication would not last even six months and offered him 25 cents. Then and there he set his subscription fee at 50 cents a year, 1 dollar {{for six months and}} 2 dollars for 3 months.|$|E
25|$|That same day, Erik XIV had Sten Eriksson {{accompany}} {{him to a}} visit to Svante Sture's cell. On his knees, the king begged Sture's forgiveness, admitting {{that he had done}} him wrong and promising full reconciliation. He then left the castle. Peterson says that on his way out, Erik had a conversation with Jöran Persson, while according to Geijer, Erik went for a walk with Petrus Caroli, ordinary of Kalmar, who <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> brother John had started a rebellion.|$|E
25|$|In 1904, {{he was in}} Kashi (now {{known as}} Varanasi), when goddess Annapurna {{appeared}} in another dream and <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> knowledge was limited to formless god and not gone beyond that, hence he was still incomplete. He accepted her challenge and traveled to Gouri devi (a siddha yogini) to learn bhava sadhana. Gouri devi accepted him as disciple and taught him bhakti or prem (eternal nature of divine love play) to understand the physical world as the transformation of god in bhava sadhana.|$|E
60|$|But {{the youth}} <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> she was <b>his</b> sister, and <b>that</b> he had painted her, {{and that if}} she was not prettier than the picture she was at all events not uglier.|$|R
5000|$|Later a Brahmin Sumedha, son of Harita (hence {{the name}} [...] "Haritayana") sought Parasurama {{to learn the}} highest good from him, who in turn {{imparted}} to him the knowledge which he had gained from Dattatreya. Parasurama <b>told</b> <b>him</b> also <b>that</b> <b>his</b> Master had predicted the compilation of {{the knowledge of the}} Highest Truth by Haritayana for the benefit of mankind.|$|R
60|$|But Rollo {{was saved}} any trouble on this score, for the coachman drove the {{carriage}} {{directly to the}} door of the office for Rome. Rollo had <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> was <b>his</b> destination, before leaving the hotel.|$|R
25|$|In 1907, Munthe {{married an}} English aristocrat, Hilda Pennington-Mellor (1876–1967). Her family owned two notable properties: Hellens in Herefordshire, {{one of the}} oldest {{dwellings}} in the country, and Southside House, a 17th-century mansion on Wimbledon Common in London. They had two sons, Peter and Malcolm. There is an anecdote that when Munthe was discussing The Story of San Michele with his publisher, John Murray, in the garden at Southside, Murray <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> ancestor and namesake John Murray (1778–1843) had sat in the same garden with Lord Byron to discuss publication of Byron's works.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{his arrival}} in Washington, Lombardi was aware of tight end Jerry Smith's sexual orientation. “Lombardi {{protected}} and loved Jerry,” said former teammate Dave Kopay. Lombardi brought Smith {{into his office and}} <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> sexual orientation would never be an issue {{as long as he was}} coaching the Redskins; Smith would be judged solely on his on-the-field performance and contribution to the team's success. Under Lombardi's leadership Smith flourished, becoming an integral part of Lombardi's offense, and was voted a First Team All-Pro for the first time in his career, which was also Lombardi's only season as Redskin head coach.|$|E
25|$|Warren {{was told}} that the new Gravelly Run bridge was {{completed}} at 2:05a.m. Ayres's division arrived at Sheridan's position near dawn. As predicted by Warren, the effect of Bartlett's appearance threatening Pickett's flank was enough for Pickett to withdraw to Five Forks, which the Confederates had done by the time Ayres reach Dinwiddie Court House. One of Sheridan's staff officers met Ayres and <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> division should have turned on to Brooks Road, a mile back. Ayres returned to Brooks Road, where a lone Confederate picket promptly fled as the division approached and, after Sheridan rode up for a brief meeting with Ayres, Ayres's men settled down for a rest until 2:00p.m.|$|E
25|$|In 1981, {{newspapers}} {{reported that}} Sir Hugh Rhys Rankin {{claimed to have}} met Ethel Le Neve in 1930 in Australia and that on <b>that</b> occasion, she <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> Crippen murdered <b>his</b> wife because she had syphilis.|$|R

50|$|The {{vocation}} {{of being}} a painter was something Rafael inherited. His grandfather used to decorate churches: he used to paint the decorations all over {{the walls of the}} churches. When <b>his</b> father <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> Pedro, <b>his</b> brother, was studying to become a painter in Mexico city, {{he thought it was a}} great waste of time. Even the greatest painters in Mexico had to rely on other jobs.|$|R
25|$|In {{an effort}} to prepare her {{daughter}} Bernice, then only five years old, for the funeral, she {{tried to explain to}} her that the next time she saw her father he would be in a casket and would not be speaking. When asked by her son Dexter when his father would return, King lied and <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> father had only been badly hurt. Senator Robert Kennedy ordered three more telephones to be installed in the King residence for King and her family to be able to answer the flood of calls they received and offered a plane to transport her to Memphis. Coretta spoke to Kennedy the day after the assassination and asked if he could persuade Jacqueline Kennedy to attend her husband's funeral with him.|$|E
25|$|On July 13, {{the kidnappers}} {{contacted}} Sergio Cázares Garza, {{one of the}} family members who lived in Texas, and <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> remaining relatives would be released if the family paid a ransom. Initially, the family said they could only pay a few thousand dollars, but the captors allowed for them to have at least two days to collect more money. In total, the Cázares made four different payments to the kidnappers in Matamoros in a sum of US$100,000. The first one was delivered at a grocery store parking lot and the second one was left behind a fast-food eatery. The kidnappers communicated with the Cázares family that was in hiding in Texas through telephone, and the cash deliveries were made by a trusted employee of the family in Matamoros. Each time the deliveries were made, the Gulf Cartel sent a different envoy to pick up the money from the Cázares at a disclosed location.|$|E
25|$|Cowdrey won a Heath Harrison Exhibition {{award and}} a place at Brasenose College at Oxford University to study {{geography}} {{in the autumn of}} 1951. He played for the Oxford University Cricket Club in 1952 and 1953 {{at the start of the}} season and the rest of the summer for Kent. He made 50 and 57 for the Gentlemen vs the 1953 Australians at Lords. In 1954 he captained Oxford University and was a surprise choice for the MCC tour of Australia, replacing Willie Watson. Len Hutton later <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> selection was a gamble, but it was thought that his technique would be good on the hard Australian wickets. At 21, Cowdrey was the youngest man in the side and the schoolboy photographs used in the brochures made him appear younger. He had yet to make a century in the County Championship, go on tour or play a Test, though he was made twelfth man for the Fourth Test against Pakistan and fielded for 20 minutes, but was so nervous he could barely watch.|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> with civility <b>that</b> <b>his</b> words {{conveyed}} no impression to my intelligence. `I mean,' he said, `that {{going right}} {{round the world}} is the shortest way to where you are already.' ...|$|R
50|$|Following the Horse Camp Slaughter and {{encouragement}} from Spokane runners, Owhi visited Colonel George Wright at his camp on Latah Creek intending to negotiate peace. During the meeting he was seized {{and put in}} irons. Wright <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> if <b>his</b> son didn't surrender within four days, Owhi was to be hanged. Despite Wright stating his intention to send Qualchan a message demanding he come to the camp, Native witnesses deny one was ever sent.|$|R
5000|$|Since no commercially {{available}} [...]50 caliber rifle existed at that time, {{he decided to}} make a semi-automatic weapon. With no background in manufacturing or engineering, Barrett sketched a cross-sectioned, full-size rifle, adding different components to it. Once he decided on the concept, he approached some machine shops with <b>his</b> drawings. They <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> if <b>his</b> idea were any good, someone smarter would have already designed it. However, this did not diminish his ideas.|$|R
