5|$|By {{the end of}} this era, Rome {{had become}} full of {{unemployed}} Plebeians. They then began filling the ranks of the assemblies, {{and the fact that they}} were no longer away from Rome made it easier for <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote.</b> In the principle legislative assembly, the Plebeian Council, any individual voted in the Tribe that his ancestors had belonged to. Thus, most of these newly unemployed Plebeians belonged to one of the thirty-one rural Tribes, rather than one of the four urban Tribes, and the unemployed Plebeians soon acquired so much political power that the Plebeian Council became highly populist. These Plebeians were often angry with the aristocracy, which further exacerbated the class tensions. Their economic state usually led <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> for the candidate who offered the most for them, or at least for the candidate whose games or whose bribes were the most magnificent. The fact that they were usually uninformed as to the issues before them didn't matter, because they usually sold their votes to the highest bidder anyway. Bribery became such a problem that major reforms were ultimately passed, in particular the requirement that all votes be by secret ballot. A new culture of dependency was emerging, which would look to any populist leader for relief.|$|E
5|$|The Singapore {{position}} may {{be compared}} with the situation in other jurisdictions. In Malaysia, the right to vote is entrenched in Article 119 of the Federal Constitution, but suffrage is similarly denied to those serving prison terms. In Yazid bin Sufaat v. Suruhanjaya Pilihanraya Malaysia (2009), it was held that while detainees under the Internal Security Act 1960– who have not been convicted of any crime– still enjoy the right to vote in national elections, that right may only be exercised only in the constituencies they are registered in, and does not extend to allowing <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> while incarcerated elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|After Homer sees how devastated Apu {{was about}} being deported, he changes {{his mind about}} the {{immigration}} proposition and vows {{that he and his}} family will help Apu. Lisa discovers that Apu will not have to leave if he can pass a United States citizenship test. Homer agrees to be Apu's tutor to help prepare for the exam. After Lisa intervenes, Apu goes to take the test; he passes and becomes a citizen of the United States. At a congratulatory party, Homer tells his guests how terrible it would be if immigrants were deported, explaining they make the United States thrive. He inspires <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> no on Proposition 24, but it still passes, with 95% of voters voting yes. After the ballot is passed, the only person deported is Groundskeeper Willie.|$|E

5|$|Also in Oregon v. Mitchell, the Supreme Court {{addressed}} {{the constitutionality of}} various other provisions relating to voter qualifications and prerequisites to voting. The Court upheld Section 202, which prohibits any state or local jurisdiction from requiring people to live in their borders for longer than 30 days before allowing <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> in a presidential election. Additionally, the Court upheld the provision lowering the minimum voting age to 18 in federal elections, but it held that Congress exceeded its power by lowering the voting age to 18 in state elections; this precipitated the ratification of the Twenty-sixth Amendment the following year, which lowered the voting age in all elections to 18. The Court was deeply divided in Oregon v. Mitchell, {{and a majority of}} justices did not agree on a rationale for the holding.|$|E
5|$|Governor Luis Fortuño and his party, New Progressive Party (PNP), campaigned {{in favor}} of the {{proposed}} amendments. Most {{of the leaders of the}} party support him and will campaign with him. Thomas Rivera Schatz, President of the Senate of Puerto Rico, asked voters to participate of the referendum and encouraged <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> {{in favor of}} the amendments. Also, a group of chiefs of agencies made statements {{in favor of the}} amendments. The group, led by Chief of Staff Miguel Romero, included Guillermo Somoza (Justice), Yanitzia Irizarry (Family), Miguel Hernández Vivoni (Housing), Jesús F. Méndez (Treasury), Henry Neumann (Sports and Recreation), and Jesús González (Correction).|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to 2008, {{there was no}} organised dissent against Mugabe within ZANU-PF. The party elite decided to avoid the violence that had marred 2008's election {{so as not to}} undermine its credibility, particularly {{in the eyes of the}} SADC, thus allowing Zimbabwe's government to consolidate its rule without interference. Mugabe called upon supporters to avoid violence, and attended far fewer rallies than in past elections, in part because of his advanced age and in part to ensure that those rallies he did attend were larger. The ZANU-PF offered gifts, including food and clothing, to many members of the electorate to encourage <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> for the party.|$|E

5|$|In {{the final}} decades of this era many plebeians grew poorer. The long {{military}} campaigns had forced citizens {{to leave their}} farms to fight, while their farms fell into disrepair. The landed aristocracy began buying bankrupted farms at discounted prices. As commodity prices fell, many farmers could no longer operate their farms at a profit. The result was the ultimate bankruptcy of countless farmers. Masses of unemployed plebeians soon began to flood into Rome, and thus {{into the ranks of}} the legislative assemblies. Their poverty usually led <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> for the candidate who offered them the most. A new culture of dependency was emerging, in which citizens would look to any populist leader for relief.|$|E
5|$|Kirchner quickly {{expanded}} {{the activities and}} scope of his office, building a parallel state. This soon started a conflict with Puricelli. Instead of being fired, Kirchner resigned and accused the governor of reducing the funds for social-welfare. He ran for mayor of Río Gallegos in 1987, and won by the slim margin of 110 votes. Kirchner's friend, Rudy Ulloa Igor, helped him to victory by registering some groups of Chilean immigrants to vote (immigrants were allowed to vote in mayoral elections), and persuading <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> for Kirchner. Julio de Vido and Carlos Zannini began working with Kirchner at this time. Kirchner used the state-owned media to promote his activities. The Peronist Ricardo del Val was elected governor that year, and the province was impacted by inflation in 1989. Kirchner became the main opponent of del Val, who was impeached and removed from office in 1990 due to the inflation crisis.|$|E
5|$|Diana asks Paul's lawyer, Toadfish Rebecchi (Ryan Moloney), to {{work for}} her in {{bringing}} Paul down and he agrees. Diana discovers that Paul is blackmailing Toadie into covering up his embezzlement. Paul tells Diana that he has sold PirateNet and that his money troubles will soon be over, before giving her cab fare to the airport.

Rosemary is grateful and tells Diana that she will book her a flight home. Diana asks Paul to comes to her hotel room and she tries to seduce him, but he pushes her away. Diana tells him that she is not going anywhere and that she will take everything from him. Paul goads Diana when she comes into Charlie's, he tells her that it was fun crushing her and Diana throws her drink in Paul's face. Diana is about to go home, when she hears that Paul has decided to put Declan in charge of Lassiter's for six months, so he can spend more time with his family. Diana asks Declan to help her bring Paul and Rosemary down and he agrees. Diana begins calling the board members in the hope that she can persuade <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> Rosemary and Paul out. Paul discovers that Toadie and Declan are working against him and he tells Rosemary about Diana's plan. Diana goes to Declan's office and finds Paul waiting for her. He tells her that her plan has not worked and that Rosemary has fired her.|$|E
5|$|Local Conservative Associations {{began to}} educate {{citizens}} about the Party's platform and encouraged <b>them</b> <b>to</b> register <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> annually, as {{mandated by the}} Act. Press coverage of national politics in the local press was joined by in-depth reports on provincial politics in the national press.

25|$|The {{company had}} a long-standing policy of {{reinvestment}} in the rail system. When profits appeared, they were usually {{used to pay}} off loans and improve the rails, streetcars and other hardware the company owned. It was rare {{for the company to}} pay out dividends. In 1948, Wall Street speculator Charles Green bought 6000 shares of TCRT stock. He expected to quickly gain profit, but found he had purchased stock just as the company decided to set forth on some major construction. Knowing this would demolish his anticipated dividends, Green contacted other shareholders and urged <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> out the company's president, D. J.

In April 2010, it was revealed that former contestant Kate Gosselin had e-mailed friends and family asking <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> as many as 10x each. In Nov 2010, the Washington Post reported that online voting appeared not to require a valid email address, and accordingly that numerous votes apparently could be cast by 1 person.|$|E
25|$|During {{the reign}} of William III, the Dutch royal house's {{popularity}} waned, because William III had much trouble complying to the Constitutional Reform of 1848. He would rather exert the same power as his predecessors did. In 1866, after the Second Thorbecke cabinet, he formed a conservative cabinet. That cabinet was immediately voted out in the House of Representatives over the controversial royal appointment of Pieter Mijer to Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies. Instead of dismissing the cabinet, the king dissolved Parliament and organised new elections. All voters received a letter that urged <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> conservative. Although the conservatives won, they did not attain a majority. Nevertheless, the cabinet did not step down.|$|E
