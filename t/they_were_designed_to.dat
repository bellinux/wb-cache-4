5|$|The Student and Instructor {{models were}} also {{introduced}} in the late 1960s. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> teach the piano in the classroom. By connecting the output {{of a network of}} student models, the teacher could listen to each student in isolation on the instructor model, and send an audio backing track to them. This allowed the teacher to monitor individual students' progress.|$|E

The piped water had already failed which <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> use, but parts of the river bank could still be reached. Gangs of men tried desperately to {{manoeuvre}} the engines right up to the river to fill their reservoirs, and several of the engines toppled into the Thames. The heat from the flames by then was too great for the remaining engines to get within a useful distance; they could not even get into Pudding Lane.|$|E

5|$|Since <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> escort the US {{fleet of}} fast attack {{aircraft}} carriers, the Iowa-class battleships were all intended {{to carry a}} fearsome array of anti-aircraft guns to protect US aircraft carriers from Japanese fighters and dive bombers. This array included up to 20 quad 40mm mounts and 49 single 20mm mounts. In the 1968 USS New Jersey re-activation for service off Vietnam, the 20mm and 40mm batteries were removed. In the 1980s re-activation, all the ships with 20mm and 40mm batteries had them removed, and four Phalanx CIWS mounts were added to all.|$|E
5|$|The {{first four}} M-class shipsM, N, O, and Pwere 178 meters long at the waterline, and 183 meters long overall.

The ships had a {{designed}} displacement of 8,500metric tons, but displaced 7,800tons at standard load and 10,400tons fully laden. The ships had a crew of 28 officers and 892 men. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> carry one picket boat, a barge, a launch, and two cutters.|$|E
5|$|The two Brummer class cruisers were {{designed}} in 1914, when the turbines being built by AG Vulcan for the Russian battlecruiser Navarin became available {{owing to the}} state of war between Germany and Russia. The German navy instructed AG Vulcan to divide the turbines in half and design a pair of cruiser-minelayers around the propulsion system. As a result of their need for high speed, they were lightly armed, with only four 15cm guns. And to further aid them in their offensive minelaying role, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> resemble British cruisers to help conceal their identity.|$|E

They were a mixed-traffic design, being equally adept at hauling passenger and freight trains, and were used on all types of services, frequently far below their capabilities. A total of 110locomotives were constructed between 1945 and 1950, named after West Country resorts or Royal Air Force (RAF) and other subjects associated with the Battle of Britain.|$|E
5|$|As a {{character}} introduced in Soul Edge, Li Long's weapon, {{a pair of}} nunchaku with mounted blades, were selected before {{other elements of the}} character. One of several weapons initially considered for the character Hwang early in development, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> be unique amongst the other weapons in the game. Li Long's design and concept were built to revolve around them, starting with gender, then physical measurements, and lastly background details. After his appearance and movement were fleshed out by a concept artist, his character was rendered as a 3D model by a design team that worked solely on him, and then animated by a motion designer using motion capture to create his in-game movements. During development, many ideas were considered for Li Long's appearance, including several younger drafts. Another idea considered was for him to fight using kung fu, instead of solely with his nunchaku.|$|E
5|$|Devil Children {{was created}} as a {{response}} to the popularity of the Pokémon series of games, and as an alternative take on the game Shin Megami Tensei for younger players, featuring child characters and cute monsters. Most of the games were developed by Multimedia Intelligence Transfer and published by Atlus, with the exception of Card Summoner, which was developed and published by Enterbrain, and the 2011 Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Children, which was developed by Index Corporation. The only games in the series to have been released in English are Dark Version and Light Version. The soundtracks for Black Book and Red Book were composed by Tomoyuki Hamada from the group T's Music, using orchestral music blended with elements of rock. For the 2011 game, Yuji Himukai, known for his work on Atlus' Etrian Odyssey series, was tasked with creating new designs and illustrations of Mirai and Setsuna; <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> look older than in their original appearances in Black Book and Red Book.|$|E

5|$|Optically, the HST is a Cassegrain {{reflector}} of Ritchey–Chrétien design, as {{are most}} large professional telescopes. This design, with two hyperbolic mirrors, {{is known for}} good imaging performance over a wide field of view, with the disadvantage that the mirrors have shapes {{that are hard to}} fabricate and test. The mirror and optical systems of the telescope determine the final performance, and <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> exacting specifications. Optical telescopes typically have mirrors polished to an accuracy of about a tenth of the wavelength of visible light, but the Space Telescope was to be used for observations from the visible through the ultraviolet (shorter wavelengths) and was specified to be diffraction limited {{to take full advantage of}} the space environment. Therefore, its mirror needed to be polished to an accuracy of 10nanometers, or about 1/65 of the wavelength of red light. On the long wavelength end, the OTA was not designed with optimum IR performance in mind—for example, the mirrors are kept at stable (and warm, about 15°C) temperatures by heaters. This limits Hubble's performance as an infrared telescope.|$|E
5|$|The Amiral Charner {{class was}} a group of four {{armoured}} cruisers built for the French Navy during the 1890s. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> be smaller and cheaper than the preceding design while also serving as commerce raiders in times of war. Three of the ships were assigned to the International Squadron off the island of Crete during the Greco-Turkish War of 1897 to protect French interests and citizens. With several exceptions the sister ships spent most of {{the first decade of the}} 20th century serving as training ships or in reserve. Bruix aided survivors of the devastating eruption of Mount Pelée on the island of Martinique in 1902. Chanzy was transferred to French Indochina in 1906 and ran aground off the Chinese coast in mid-1907. She proved impossible to refloat and was destroyed in place.|$|E
5|$|Undoubtedly while negro slavery {{alone was}} {{in the mind of}} the Congress which {{proposed}} the thirteenth article, it forbids any other kind of slavery, now or hereafter. If Mexican peonage or the Chinese coolie labor system shall develop slavery of the Mexican or Chinese race within our territory, this amendment may safely be trusted to make it void. And so if other rights are assailed by the States which properly and necessarily fall within the protection of these articles, that protection will apply, though the party interested may not be of African descent. But what we do say, and what we wish to be understood is, that in any fair and just construction of any section or phrase of these amendments, it is necessary to look to the purpose which we have said was the pervading spirit of them all, the evil which <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> remedy, and the process of continued addition to the Constitution, until that purpose was supposed to be accomplished, as far as constitutional law can accomplish it.|$|E

5|$|Screenwriter Gidding, who {{had worked}} with {{director}} Wise on the 1958 film I Want to Live!, began a six-month write of the script after reading the book, which Wise had given to him. He perceived the book to be more about mental breakdown than ghosts, and although he was informed after meeting author Shirley Jackson that it was very much a supernatural novel, elements of mental breakdown were introduced into the film. The film was shot at MGM-British Studios in the United Kingdom on a budget of US$1.05 million, with exteriors and the grounds shot at Ettington Park (now the Ettington Park Hotel) in the village of Ettington, Warwickshire. Julie Harris was cast by Wise who found her ideal for the psychologically fragile Eleanor, though during production she suffered from depression and had an uneasy relationship with her co-stars. The interior sets were by Elliot Scott, credited by Wise as instrumental in the making of The Haunting. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> be brightly lit, with no dark corners or recesses, and decorated in a Rococo style; all the rooms had ceilings to create a claustrophobic effect on film. Numerous devices and tricks were used in the filming. Wise used a 30mm anamorphic, wide-angle lens Panavision camera that was not technically ready for use and caused distortions. It was only given to Wise on condition that he sign a memorandum in which he acknowledged that the lens was imperfect. Wise and cinematographer Davis Boulton planned sequences that kept the camera moving, utilizing low-angle takes, and incorporating unusual pans and tracking shots.|$|E
5|$|Thuan {{started an}} inquiry into the usage of {{chemical}} weapons on the protestors. The investigation exonerated the Diệm regime {{of the most serious}} allegations of using poison or mustard gas. Before the president was deposed in November, the inquiry's report declared that only tear gas was used, and that the liquid components of the grenades were poured onto the protestors after they had failed to vaporize as <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to.</b> A further commission chaired by General Trần Văn Đôn prior to February 1964 concluded that the tear gas was left behind by French colonial forces in the 1950s. The tear gas used came in glass containers {{in the form of a}} liquid that was transformed into gaseous vapor upon activation by acid. The injuries were attributed to the acid failing to activate the liquid into gaseous form. United States Army chemists in Maryland confirmed that the tear gas had come from canisters dating back to French World War I stocks. During World War I, France had used tear gas containing a mixture of chloroacetone and ethyl bromoacetate against German troops at Ypres on the Western Front, which was known to strongly irritate mucous membranes.|$|E
