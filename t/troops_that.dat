By {{the time}} Ohioan had completed her sixth and final trooping voyage on 16 September 1919, Ohioan had carried home 8,383 healthy and wounded men. USS Ohioan was decommissioned on 6 October 1919, {{and returned to}} American-Hawaiian.|$|E
5|$|Operation Varsity (24 March 1945) was a {{successful}} airborne forces operation launched by Allied <b>troops</b> <b>that</b> took place {{toward the end of}} World War II. Involving more than 16,000 paratroopers and several thousand aircraft, it was the largest airborne operation in history to be conducted on a single day and in one location.|$|E
5|$|The ARBiH drive towards Sanski Most and Novi Grad, {{where one}} of the bridgeheads had been {{established}} by the HV, came to a halt on 18–19 September, as the ARBiH encountered 14,000 previously undetected VRS troops in the area, supported by 2,000 <b>troops</b> <b>that</b> had arrived from Serbia.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of the Assunpink Creek, {{also known}} as the Second Battle of Trenton, was a battle between American and British <b>troops</b> <b>that</b> took place in and around Trenton, New Jersey, on January2, 1777, during the American Revolutionary War, and {{resulted}} in an American victory.|$|E
5|$|The French {{invasion}} of Russia, where poor traction conditions for ill-shod horses {{made it difficult}} for supply wagons to keep up with <b>troops.</b> <b>That</b> campaign was also strongly affected by cold, whereby the retreating army reached Neman River in December 1812 with only 10,000 of the 420,000 that had set out to invade Russia in June of the same year.|$|E
5|$|The French tactics were {{sufficient}} to prevent Amherst's army from joining James Wolfe at the Battle of the Plains of Abraham. However, they also tied up 3,000 {{of their own}} <b>troops</b> <b>that</b> {{were not able to}} assist in Quebec's defense. The capture of the fort, which had previously repulsed a large British army a year earlier, contributed to the Annus Mirabilis of 1759.|$|E

5|$|The {{numbers of}} <b>troops</b> <b>that</b> Xerxes mustered {{for the second}} {{invasion}} of Greece {{have been the subject}} of endless dispute. Most modern scholars reject as unrealistic the figures of 2.5 million given by Herodotus and other ancient sources because the victors likely miscalculated or exaggerated. The topic has been hotly debated, but the consensus revolves around the figure of 200,000.|$|E
5|$|Washington's defeat {{revealed}} his deficiencies as a strategist who split his forces, his inexperienced generals who misunderstood the situation, and his raw <b>troops</b> <b>that</b> fled in disorder {{at the first}} shots. However, his daring nighttime retreat has been seen by some historians {{as one of his}} greatest military feats. Other historians concentrate on the failure of British naval forces to prevent the withdrawal.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} event now occurred which {{granted the}} Japanese forces a reprieve. Early on 3 November, Marine units near Koli Point, {{east of the}} Lunga Perimeter, engaged 300 fresh Japanese <b>troops</b> <b>that</b> had just been landed by a Tokyo Express mission of five destroyers. This, plus the knowledge that {{a large body of}} Japanese troops {{was in the process of}} relocating to Koli Point after the defeat in the Henderson Field battle, led the Americans to believe that the Japanese were about to conduct a major attack on the Lunga Perimeter from the Koli Point area.|$|E

5|$|An article {{published}} by Politico in September 2017, cited a self-assessment by the 173rd Airborne Brigade as {{stating that the}} brigade lacked “essential capabilities needed to accomplish its mission effectively and with decisive speed”. The document detailed a number of “capability gaps”, which had been identified during the brigade′s training with Ukrainian <b>troops</b> <b>that</b> had experience fighting against Russian-backed forces in eastern Ukraine. The report described deficiencies in air defense and electronic warfare units {{as well as an}} over-reliance on satellite communications and GPS navigation systems. These are said to make the unit vulnerable to an enemy with high-end equipment and technology.|$|E
5|$|Another novel {{aspect of}} the {{offensive}} used by the attackers, which was extensively commented upon by American journalist Timothy Turner who was observing the battle from El Paso, was the rotation of <b>troops</b> <b>that</b> the rebels employed. Rather than attacking en masse with the whole army, Villa and Orozco had their soldiers engage the enemy for a few hours, {{then go back to}} secure positions to sleep, while other rebels took their place. As a consequence the rebel troops were always rested while the less numerous defending federal troops were forced to remain sleepless and ever vigilant.|$|E
5|$|As the IJN was {{preparing}} to invade Sakhalin Island in early July, Kamimura's 2nd Division, now reduced to Iwate, Izumo, and Tokiwa, was tasked to defend the Korea Strait before it escorted <b>troops</b> <b>that</b> made an amphibious landing in northeastern Korea. In mid-August, the division covered the landing at Chongjin, closer to the Russian border. After the war, she was briefly commanded by Captain Yamashita Gentaro from 2 February to 22 November 1906 before he was relieved by Captain Arima Ryokitsu.|$|E
60|$|An hour's work sufficed to show Sergeant Menzies, who was {{drilling}} the <b>troop,</b> <b>that</b> the new recruit {{needed no}} instructions on that score, {{and that he}} was as perfect in his drill as any one in the troop.|$|R

5|$|By November 1940, {{more than}} 2,000 men had volunteered and were {{organised}} into four battalions in a Special Service Brigade, {{under the command}} of Brigadier J. C. Haydon. The Brigade quickly expanded to 12 battalions, which were renamed commandos. Each commando had a lieutenant colonel as the commanding officer (CO) and numbered around 450 men (divided into 75 man <b>troops</b> <b>that</b> were further divided into 15 man sections). Technically these men were only on secondment to the commandos; they retained their regimental cap badges and remained on the regimental roll for pay. The new force of commandos came under the operational control of the Combined Operations Headquarters.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, Dexagoridas, {{one of the}} two {{garrison}} commanders, {{sent word}} to the Roman legate {{that he was willing to}} surrender the city. This plan fell through when Gorgopas, the other commander, learned of it and slew Dexagoridas with his own hands. Gorgopas continued to resist fiercely until Flamininus arrived with 4,000 additional <b>troops</b> <b>that</b> he had recently recruited. The Romans renewed their assault and Gorgopas was forced to surrender, though he did secure the condition that he and his garrison could leave unharmed and return to Sparta.|$|E
5|$|From the {{beginning}} of the planning, things went awry for the Confederates. While Pickett's division had not been used yet at Gettysburg, A.P. Hill's health became an issue and he did not participate in selecting which of his troops were to be used for the charge. Some of Hill's corps had fought lightly on July 1 and not at all on July 2. However, <b>troops</b> <b>that</b> had done heavy fighting on July 1 ended up making the charge.|$|E
