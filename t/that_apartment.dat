2500|$|Chichiarelli, {{the author}} of the false [...] "Communication No.7", was related to the Banda della Magliana. Aside from its purely {{criminal}} activities this large gang in Rome was related to Sicilian Mafia and has been involved in numerous political and terrorist scandals since the 1970s. Judiciary acts have proved that members of the gang had a role in the assassination of Pecorelli {{and in the case of}} Roberto Calvi (both of which saw the incrimination of Giulio Andreotti), in the financial affairs of the Vatican City (including the kidnapping of Emanuela Orlandi), and in the sidetracking of the investigations on massacres such as that of Bologna Station. Judge Ferdinando Imposimato proved that the [...] "Banda della Magliana" [...] had strong ties with SISMI (Italy's military intelligence agency), and that the latter inspired the farce of the communication and of the Lago della Duchessa. Finally, the apartment of via Montalcini, in which Moro was allegedly detained by the Red Brigades, was located in the Magliana quarter of southern Rome and a member of the gang owned the building facing <b>that</b> <b>apartment.</b>|$|E

He concluded: [...] "Maintaining these central points of focus permits the additional color and activity of Apartment Life to fill out Ivy's dynamic to splendid and harmonious effect". Robbins, also a columnist for Rolling Stone, wrote a separate album review where he highlighted Durand's distinctive French accent and described it as perfect for [...] "breezy pop music".

Club claimed that the entirety of Apartment Life fails to match the quality and strength of its opening track, [...] "The Best Thing".

40|$|Do {{behavioral}} biases affect {{prices in}} a high-stake market? We study {{the role of}} left-digitbias in the purchase of an apartment, {{one of the most}} important assets in a household’sportfolio. Left-digit bias is the inability to fully process digits after the first, perceivingprices just below a round number (such as $ 3. 99) as cheaper than their roundcounterpart ($ 4). We start by documenting <b>that</b> <b>apartments</b> listed at just-below asking prices are sold at a 3 - 5 % higher final price after an auction. This effect appears not to bedriven by i) differences in observable characteristics; ii) differences in real estate agents’behavior; or iii) institutional characteristics of the market. We show <b>that</b> <b>apartments</b> using just-below prices attract more bidders and bids, leading to higher competition and to a higher final price. Our results suggest that inattentive buyers might be losing roughlyhalf a year of disposable income...|$|R
