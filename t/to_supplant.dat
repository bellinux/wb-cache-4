5|$|The {{remaining}} G and H {{models were}} used for nuclear standby ("alert") duty {{as part of the}} United States' nuclear triad, the combination of nuclear-armed land-based missiles, submarine-based missiles and manned bombers. The B-1, intended <b>to</b> <b>supplant</b> the B-52, replaced only the older models and the supersonic FB-111. In 1991, B-52s ceased continuous 24-hour SAC alert duty.|$|E
5|$|Scherger became Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee (COSC), {{the senior}} Australian {{military}} {{position at the}} time, in May 1961, taking over from Vice Admiral Sir Roy Dowling. Keen as ever to see a supersonic bomber replace the Canberra, he visited Britain in April 1963 to investigate progress of the TSR-2. Using back-channel sources of information, he satisfied himself that the RAF's pronouncements on the bomber's development were overly optimistic, and later that year began supporting selection of the F-111 as the aircraft best suited <b>to</b> <b>supplant</b> the Canberra.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{of a new}} four-lane {{bridge across}} the Raritan River (now the John A. Lynch Memorial Bridge) began in the 1960s, but in 1970, when the {{environment}} impact laws came out, construction froze with only three massive piers standing out of the river. Outside of the bridge, there was significant controversy over the abandoned Delaware and Raritan Canal heading through New Brunswick. The new freeway was <b>to</b> <b>supplant</b> the former canal and its thirteenth lock in New Brunswick, abandoned in 1932. The environmentalists and the historic preservationists opposed the freeway extension because of the fears of losing the canal, while companies like Johnson & Johnson supported the new highway for redeveloping New Brunswick.|$|E

5|$|For the {{majority}} of its history the area now recognised as the Rhondda Valley was an exclusively Welsh speaking area. It was only in the early 20th century that English began <b>to</b> <b>supplant</b> Welsh as the first language of social intercourse. In 1803, English historian Benjamin Heath Malkin mentioned while travelling through Ystradyfodwg, that he had only met one person with whom he could talk, and then {{with the help of an}} interpreter. This situation was repeated with John George Wood, who on his visit to the area complained of the awkwardness of understanding the particular dialects and idioms used by the native speakers, which were on times difficult for other Welsh speakers to understand. This dialect was once called 'tafodiaith gwŷr y Gloran' ('the dialect of the men of Gloran').|$|E
5|$|In 1320 Maria married Dmitri of Tver, {{ruler of}} a Russian principality. The {{marriage}} took place soon after Mikhail Yaroslavich, Dmitri's father, was killed; his sons {{were searching for}} strong allies against Yury of Moscow, their principal competitor for the throne of Vladimir and All Rus'. After 1327 Lithuania began <b>to</b> <b>supplant</b> Tver as Moscow's chief rival for supremacy in the Rus'. When Tver sought to rival Moscow, it needed an alliance with Lithuania. Dmitri was killed in 1325 and Maria never remarried. Maria's brother-in-law, Alexander I, nevertheless maintained friendly relationships with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and his daughter Uliana married Algirdas, the son of Gediminas, who continued the Gediminid line. The cooperation between Lithuania and Tver lasted well into the 15th century.|$|E
5|$|Previously, the M-83 {{designation}} {{was used}} for a highway in the Upper Peninsula between 1919 and 1926. Immediately after that, the moniker was used <b>to</b> <b>supplant</b> the M-31 designation in The Thumb area. A disconnected segment of highway was given the M-83 name in 1929 in the Frankenmuth area. The {{gap between the two}} roads was eliminated within a year. By the end of the 1930s, the highway was truncated to its current northern terminus in the Richville area, removing The Thumb area segments. The last changes rerouted the southern end to connect with I-75 after that freeway was opened in 1962.|$|E

5|$|The {{number of}} cotton mills in Manchester itself reached {{a peak of}} 108 in 1853. Thereafter the number began to decline and Manchester was surpassed as the largest centre of cotton {{spinning}} by Bolton in the 1850s and Oldham in the 1860s. However, this period of decline coincided {{with the rise of}} the city as the financial centre of the region. Manchester continued to process cotton, and in 1913, 65% of the world's cotton was processed in the area. The First World War interrupted access to the export markets. Cotton processing {{in other parts of the}} world increased, often on machines produced in Manchester. Manchester suffered greatly from the Great Depression and the underlying structural changes that began <b>to</b> <b>supplant</b> the old industries, including textile manufacture.|$|E
5|$|As the 16th century progressed, keeps {{fell out}} of fashion once again. In England, the {{gatehouse}} also began <b>to</b> <b>supplant</b> the keep as the key focus for a new castle development. By the 15th century, it was increasingly unusual for a lord to build both a keep and a large gatehouse at the same castle, and by the early 16th century, the gatehouse had easily overtaken the keep as the more fashionable feature: indeed, almost no new keeps were built in England after this period. The classical Palladian style began to dominate European architecture during the 17th century, causing a further {{move away from the}} use of keeps. Buildings in this style usually required considerable space for the enfiladed formal rooms that became essential for modern palaces {{by the middle of the}} century, and this style was impossible to fit into a traditional keep. The keep at Bolsover Castle in England was one of the few to be built as part of a Palladian design.|$|E
5|$|Assisting {{communication}} {{across many}} modern optic fibre networks is a protocol known as Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM). The ATM protocol {{allows for the}} side-by-side data transmission mentioned in the second paragraph. It is suitable for public telephone networks because it establishes a pathway for data through the network and associates a traffic contract with that pathway. The traffic contract is essentially an agreement between the client and the network about how the network is to handle the data; if the network cannot meet {{the conditions of the}} traffic contract it does not accept the connection. This is important because telephone calls can negotiate a contract so as to guarantee themselves a constant bit rate, something that will ensure a caller's voice is not delayed in parts or cut off completely. There are competitors to ATM, such as Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS), that perform a similar task and are expected <b>to</b> <b>supplant</b> ATM in the future.|$|E

5|$|Upon its {{inception}} in 1921, a very different M-86 was routed along a portion of present-day M-66 from M-46 at Six Lakes northward to Remus, ending at M-24 (modern M-20). A few years later in 1924–25, M-66 was extended north <b>to</b> Remus, <b>supplanting</b> the contemporary M-86. At the same time, the M-86 designation was relocated to Ionia County to run from M-44 in Orleans to M-43 (present day M-66) just east of there. In late 1929, M-44 was extended east from Orleans to junction with M-43, once again, causing M-86 <b>to</b> be <b>supplanted</b> and removed from the highway system.|$|R
5|$|Far more {{difficult}} and protracted was {{the war against the}} ambitious governor of Ahwaz, Abu Abdallah al-Baridi, who aimed <b>to</b> <b>supplant</b> Ibn Ra'iq. Al-Baridi's family was of Basran origin, and had served the Abbasids in various roles as officials before managing to assert a weak hold over Khuzistan. Ibn Ra'iq himself was defeated and forced to leave Basra to the Baridis, but Bajkam saved the situation by scoring two major victories, despite being outnumbered, that allowed him to take possession of Khuzistan. The hard-pressed al-Baridi now turned to his powerful neighbour, the Buyid ruler of Fars, Ali ibn Buya, for help. Ali's brother Ahmad soon took over Khuzistan, and Ibn Ra'iq was forced to offer possession of the province as an independent domain if Bajkam would recover it. Bajkam however was repulsed by the Buyid forces, and fell back to Wasit.|$|E
5|$|The Sejm's great {{achievement}} was {{the adoption of}} the Constitution of May 3, 1791, often described as Europe's first modern written national constitution, and the world's second, after the United States Constitution. The Polish Constitution was designed to redress long-standing political defects of the federative Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and its system of Golden Liberties. The Constitution introduced political equality between townspeople and nobility and placed the peasants under the protection of the government, thus mitigating the worst abuses of serfdom. The Constitution abolished pernicious parliamentary institutions such as the liberum veto, which at one time had placed a sejm at the mercy of any deputy who might choose, or be bribed by an interest or foreign power, to undo all the legislation that had been passed by that sejm. The May 3rd Constitution sought <b>to</b> <b>supplant</b> the existing anarchy fostered by some of the country's reactionary magnates, with a more egalitarian and democratic constitutional monarchy.|$|E
5|$|The {{constitution}} sought <b>to</b> <b>supplant</b> {{the prevailing}} anarchy fostered {{by some of}} the country's magnates with a more democratic constitutional monarchy. It introduced elements of political equality between townspeople and nobility, and placed the peasants under the protection of the government, thus mitigating the worst abuses of serfdom. It banned parliamentary institutions such as the liberum veto, which had put the Sejm at the mercy of any deputy who could revoke all the legislation that had been passed by that Sejm. The Commonwealth's neighbours reacted with hostility to the adoption of the constitution. Frederick William II's Kingdom of Prussia broke its alliance with the Commonwealth, which was attacked and then defeated in the War in Defence of the Constitution by an alliance between Catherine the Great's Imperial Russia and the Targowica Confederation of anti-reform Polish magnates and landless nobility. The King, a principal co-author, eventually capitulated to the Confederates.|$|E

5|$|Marianos was {{the eldest}} son of the general Leo Argyros, active in {{the first decades of}} the 10th century. He had a brother, Romanos Argyros, who in 921 married Agathe, a {{daughter}} of Emperor Romanos I Lekapenos (r. 920–944). The Argyroi therefore were counted among the firmest supporters of the Lekapenos regime. Romanos Lekapenos had risen to power in 919 as regent over the young Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos (r. 913–959), whom he married to his daughter Helena. By December 920, his position had become so unassailable that he was crowned senior emperor. To consolidate his hold on power, and possibly aiming <b>to</b> <b>supplant</b> the ruling Macedonian dynasty with his own family, Romanos raised his eldest son Christopher to co-emperor in 921, while the younger sons Stephen and Constantine were proclaimed co-emperors in 924. Christopher died in 931, and as Constantine VII remained sidelined, Stephen and Constantine assumed an increased prominence, although formally they still ranked after their brother-in-law in the college of emperors. However, in 943, the elderly Romanos drafted a will which would leave Constantine VII as the senior emperor following his death. This greatly upset his two sons, who started planning to seize power through a coup d'état, with Stephen apparently the ringleader and Constantine a rather reluctant partner.|$|E
5|$|With {{relation}} to the human characters, David was conceptualized as not only a surrogate son for Peter Weyland, but {{as a replacement for}} Weyland's estranged daughter, Meredith Vickers. The actress who portrayed Vickers, Charlize Theron, detailed that Ridley Scott perceived Weyland's family and his company, the Weyland Corporation, as being male-dominated, with Vickers' shared DNA being the only attachment. This runs counter to David, who is a synthetic male created <b>to</b> <b>supplant</b> Vickers and uphold the family's patriarchy. Throughout the eight-month rewrite process leading directly into principal photography, Damon Lindelof focused on enhancing David's bondage to Weyland and the Prometheus- despite David being designed to be a surrogate son, he would actually be a proverbial captive to the master and his ship. With Weyland's death {{at the hands of the}} awakened Engineer, David's programming has run its course and every action he takes from thereon out is by his own volition, essentially freeing him. A philosophical element Scott raised about the David 8 model is that he exemplifies the dangers of making an android sentient- with him having the capacity for free will and the ability to create, he crosses a moral boundary that other androids stay within. The contrast between David and the others androids was developed further in , with the creation of the physically identical character Walter, who was made more robotic and unable to create on his own.|$|E
