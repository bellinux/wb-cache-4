5|$|It was {{discovered}} later that Kehoe had cut all his wire fences {{as part of}} his preparations to destroy his farm, girdling young shade trees to kill them and cutting off his grapevine plants before putting <b>them</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> their stumps to hide the damage.

5|$|The twins {{had been}} in Ireland before {{travelling}} to England and boarding a coach for London at Liverpool. Their odd behaviour after exiting the coach at a service station on the M6 – including not allowing the bags they were clutching to be searched – caused the driver not to allow <b>them</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the coach. The two were later seen on the central reservation of the M6. When Highways Agency Traffic Officers arrived to assist the women, they ran across the busy motorway. Ursula managed to dodge traffic; Sabina was first struck by a SEAT León.|$|E
5|$|Aboard the ship, {{passenger}} John Geiger hacks {{into the}} ship's computer system, {{and the following}} evening, he destroys the ship's communication systems and kills the captain. After remotely shutting down the ship's engines, Geiger calls the bridge to tell the first officer, Juliano, that the captain is dead and he is in charge. Juliano is ordered by Geiger to evacuate the ship. Geiger steals jewelry from the ship's vault. As passengers evacuate, Drew, a young deaf girl, becomes trapped in an elevator, {{and a group of}} people become trapped behind locked fire doors in a hallway filling with smoke. As Annie and Alex attempt to board the last lifeboat, Geiger programs the ship to continue sailing. The winch lowering the lifeboat jams. Alex jumps into the boat to rescue the passengers who are falling off, and Annie and Juliano use the ship's gangplank to get <b>them</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> deck.|$|E

5|$|The Maratha {{redeployment}} was swifter {{and more}} efficient than Wellesley had anticipated and he immediately reacted by extending his front to deny Pohlmann the opportunity to outflank him. A battalion of pickets and the 74th Highlanders, which formed {{the right of the}} first and second lines, were ordered to move obliquely to the right. This allowed the 78th to anchor the left flank and Madras infantry battalions (the 1/10th, 1/8th, 1/4th and 2/12th) to form the centre of the British line. Wellesley's intention was to force back the Marathas from their guns and then– operating by his left to avoid the heavily defended Assaye– throw <b>them</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the Juah and complete their destruction with his cavalry.|$|E
5|$|The UN counterattack at Inchon {{collapsed}} the North Korean {{line and}} forced <b>them</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> all fronts. On 16 September, however, 25th Infantry Division was still fighting North Korean forces behind its lines, and North Korean strong points existed on {{the heights of}} Battle Mountain, P'il-bong, and Sobuk-san. Kean felt that the division could advance along the roads toward Chinju only when the mountainous center of the division front was clear. He therefore believed {{that the key to}} the advance of the 25th Division lay in its center where the North Koreans held the heights and kept the 24th Infantry Regiment under daily attack. The 27th Infantry on the left and the 35th Infantry on the right, astride the roads between Chinju and Masan held their positions and could not advance until the situation in front of the 24th Infantry improved.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Bynars discreetly {{create a}} catastrophic {{failure in the}} ship's warp core. Lt. Cmdr. Data (Brent Spiner) and Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton) are unable to locate Picard or Riker and, {{assuming}} them to already be on the Starbase, order an emergency evacuation. They set the ship to leave the Starbase and warp to a safe location before it would explode. However, once they are clear of the dock, the failure disappears and the ship sets course for the Bynar system, the planet Bynaus orbiting Beta Magellan. Data, La Forge, and Quinteros realize that the Bynars are still aboard the ship, but there are currently no other working vessels to follow <b>them.</b> <b>Back</b> <b>on</b> the Enterprise, Riker and Picard leave the simulation to find the ship empty and at warp to the Bynar system, with the ship's controls locked to the bridge. Fearing that the Bynars have taken over the ship for nefarious purposes, they set the ship to self-destruct in 5 minutes and then take the bridge by inter-ship transporter beam and find the Bynars there unconscious.|$|E

5|$|On 13 March 1985, Millwall visited Kenilworth Road for an FA Cup sixth round match. After only 14 {{minutes the}} match was halted as the visiting fans began to riot. The referee took both teams off for 25 minutes, before {{bringing}} <b>them</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> {{to complete the}} match. Following the final whistle, and a 1–0 victory for Luton, another pitch invasion and subsequent riot by away supporters caused noticeable damage {{to the ground and}} the surrounding area. Many of those arrested turned out to be supporters of teams other than Millwall. The club's chairman, David Evans, reacted by imposing a ban on all away supporters from Kenilworth Road {{from the start of the}} 1986–87 season as well as introducing a scheme that would require even home supporters to carry membership cards to be admitted to matches. The Football League insisted that Luton relax the ban for League Cup matches, but when Evans refused to allow Cardiff City fans to visit Kenilworth Road for their second round tie, the club were thrown out of the competition. The ban continued for four seasons, with exceptions for cup matches, before Luton Town repealed the ban before the 1990–91 season.|$|E

25|$|In essence, this {{technique}} is a statistical method of assessing the behavior of incoming requests to detect if something unusual or abnormal is going on. Imagine {{if you were to}} observe the behavior of normal, paying customers at a brick-and-mortar department store. On average, they would spend in aggregate a known percentage of time on different activities such as picking up items and examining them, putting <b>them</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> shelves, trying on clothes, filling a basket, waiting in line, paying for their purchases, and leaving. These high-level activities correspond to the Key Completion Indicators in a service or site, and once normal behavior is determined, abnormal behavior can be identified. For example, if a huge number of customers arrive and spend all their time picking up items and setting them down, but never making any purchases, this can be flagged as unusual behavior.|$|E

25|$|Hampshire Hawks {{recovered}} to post {{a challenging}} target after early setbacks, caused by two wickets from Lancashire Lightning spinner Andrew Symonds and losing Nic Pothas early through a run out. They struggled to 86 for 4 before Shane Watson put <b>them</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> track with an unbeaten 106, helped by Greg Lamb, who made 42. In a match dominated by foreign or foreign-born players, Marcus North and Symonds put on a 94-run partnership to help Lancashire to 155 for 2. However, Australian all-rounder Andy Bichel took three for 34, Dimitri Mascarenhas rounded off his nine overs by taking two wickets with the two last balls, and Lancashire were left to score 23 from 24 balls with a wicket in hand. James Anderson tried, hitting two fours, but with nine required off ten balls he was lbw to Shaun Udal for nine to give Hampshire an eight-run victory.|$|E
25|$|In 1723, the Immaculata statue {{was erected}} {{in the place}} of a former gallows at Hlavná ulica (Main Street) commemorating the plague from the years 1710–1711. This was one of the centers of the Hungarian {{language}} regenerate movement which published the first Hungarian language periodical called the Magyar Museum in Hungary in 1788. The city's walls were demolished step by step from the early 19th century to 1856; only the Executioner's Bastion remained with few parts of the wall. The city became the seat of its own bishopric in 1802. The city's surroundings became a theater of war again during the Revolutions of 1848, when the Imperial cavalry general Franz Schlik defeated the Hungarian army on 8 December 1848 and 4 January 1849. The city was captured by the Hungarian army on 15 February 1849, but the Russian troops drove <b>them</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> 24 June 1849.|$|E
25|$|In a match {{reduced by}} rain, the South African Academy {{came back to}} record their first victory of the tour in the final game. Winning the toss and opting to bat at the Sheikhupura Stadium in Lahore, they lost Tshabalala early, but Williamson and Smit sent <b>them</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> track with a 61-run partnership. The middle and lower order then smacked the bowlers about, van Jaarsveld and Phangiso hitting three sixes between them in quickfire innings, as South Africa closed on 164 for 9. Mansoor Amjad took four wickets for Pakistan, but conceded 57 runs from five overs in the process. Due to rain having {{interrupted}} South Africa's innings, Pakistan were set 176 to win, and were in trouble early as Philander and Govender took wickets to peg them back to 12 for 3. Hasan Raza made another big innings, with 67 not out, but could not hit quickly enough as Pakistan fell five runs short of the target, ending on 171 for 5.|$|E

25|$|Australia again {{started with}} a wobble, losing McCosker for 4 in the third over, but a 42 run {{partnership}} between Chappell and Ian Davis got <b>them</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> track. Davis eventually went for 18, but that brought Kim Hughes to the crease. Although scoring less prolifically, Hughes capably supported Chappell as he moved towards a well-deserved century, falling on 102. It was enough {{to prop up the}} Australian second innings, and solid contributions from Hughes (27), Doug Walters (24), Richie Robinson (26), and Max Walker (22) took Australia to 251 all out. Gloucestershire required an unlikely 343 for victory, and never looked like they would reach the target. Andy Stovold made 27, and Jim Foat and David Shepherd both chipped in with 26 each, but Gloucentershire were all out for 169. Len Pascoe (4/36) and Ray Bright (4/63) were the pick of the Australian bowlers, as they wrapped up a deserved victory by 173 runs in two days.|$|E
25|$|On 27 May 1793 Servan sent a force under Pierre François Lambert Lamoureux de Genettière to {{threaten}} the Roncevaux Pass. Caro sent a column under Pedro Caro, 3rd Marquis of la Romana to counter the French. On 6 June the two sides clashed at Chateau-Pignon. At first Moncey with Jean Boudet, the 5th Light Infantry and few other units did well but superior Spanish forces soon forced <b>them</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the main body. After a few rounds of artillery fire, the untried French volunteers fled leaving Genettière to be captured. La Romana's soldiers then successfully stormed Chateau-Pignon. On 22 June Servan pushed the Spanish left wing back to the Bidasoa, capturing the Montaigne Louis XIV redoubt. On 30 August, Deprez-Crassier ordered a major assault on the Spanish outpost of Biriatou. La Romana not only repelled the assault but drove the attackers back to the Sans Culottes Camp near Urrugne. On the same day, José Urrutia y de las Casas repulsed a second column under Willot in its attack on Bera (Vera).|$|E
25|$|Mighty Wings – deep-fried spicy chicken wings. McDonald's {{began selling}} these in 1990 as an {{optional}} item and stopped selling them in 2003.

On September 9, 2013, McDonald's brought the Mighty Wings back to its menus {{in all of its}} American restaurants as a limited time offer available until November 2013. The Mighty Wings did not sell well its second time around in the U.S. The main problems cited with the Mighty Wings was the price point versus the amount purchased.

25|$|In {{the week}} {{preceding}} the race London experienced {{a series of}} riots; several football matches were called off, but the London–Surrey Cycle Classic was allowed to proceed. On race day British riders Liam Holohan, Kristian House and Tom Murray and Brazil's Cleberson Weber opened up a 6-minute gap in the breakaway before the peloton started to pull <b>them</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the final Box Hill climb. 2009 British road race champion House won the King of the Mountains award. The lead quartet were {{swept up in the}} final 9kilometres as Great Britain and England controlled the pace. Kurt Asle Arvesen then made a bid for the win before being brought back. With 12kilometres to go, Tyler Farrar suffered a puncture. After chasing furiously he reached the peloton with 2kilometres to go, only to see his chance of the win wiped out as a crash occurred; according to Heinrich Haussler it was caused by two riders fighting. The crash split the peloton and in a group of just 20 riders Mark Cavendish beat Sacha Modolo of Italy and France's Samuel Dumoulin in a sprint finish on the Mall.|$|E
25|$|The relegation {{battle in}} the National League {{tightened}} further, as the match at Trent Bridge became a low-scoring thriller, where Gloucestershire Gladiators failed to put away two good positions - first they collapsed from 75 for 2 to make 116, then they allowed Nottinghamshire to hit 19 for the last wicket. They were put in to bat by Nottinghamshire Outlaws and after losing Kadeer Ali and Ramnaresh Sarwan for ducks, Steve Adshead and Craig Spearman rebuilt with a 60-run third-wicket stand. Mark Ealham and Gareth Clough shared the last seven wickets, however, after Ryan Sidebottom had bowled Spearman for 18, and Gloucestershire were all out for 116. James Averis then took four wickets for the Gladiators, as Nottinghamshire lost their first five wickets for 32 runs, but Anurag Singh and Mark Ealham put <b>them</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> track by adding 30 for the sixth wicket. Jon Lewis broke through their defences, however, shattering Ealham's stumps as he was bowled, and when Anurag Singh departed for 41, Nottinghamshire's task looked steep. They needed 19 for the last wicket with Ryan Sidebottom and Greg Smith batting - but Smith hit two fours as he ended with 16 not out to take Nottinghamshire to the victory.|$|E
25|$|The 3rd Army {{was formed}} in August 1914 as part of Austria-Hungary's {{mobilization}} following its declaration of war on Serbia and Russia, carrying out the prewar plans {{for the formation of}} six field armies. Just as all Austro-Hungarian field armies, it consisted of a headquarters and several corps, along with some unattached units. The 3rd Army initially consisted of the XI and XIV Corps, based in Lemberg (modern day Lviv, Ukraine), and Innsbruck, respectively. In addition there were several divisions that were attached directly to army headquarters. It was placed under the overall command of General der Kavallerie Rudolf Ritter von Brudermann. Early on in the war the formation took part in the Battle of Galicia in the northeastern part of the Dual Monarchy, where {{it was part of the}} Austro-Hungarian force advancing from Lemberg towards the Russian Southwestern Front's positions. On 25 August 1914, they received word of advancing Russian forces near Zlota Lipa river and 3rd Army was ordered to engage them. The clash began on August 26, with what the Austrians believed were small Russian units, but turned out to be eight corps. It was not long before they were forced to retreat, reaching Lemberg on August 27. Although 3rd Army had the time to form a defensive line near the Gnila Lipa river, the advancing Russians outnumbered Bruderman's army three to one and drove <b>them</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> August 30, before seizing Lemberg itself in early September. Thus the Austro-Hungarian line had to retreat back to the Carpathians, losing the country's territory east of the mountain range to the Russians.|$|E
