FIG were influential on the second-generation improvisation scene and spawned a number of women-only improvising groups and events. FIG were also educational in that they exposed new audiences to improvisation and feminism.|$|E
5|$|Emma Goldman {{was born}} on June 27, 1869. Her father used {{violence}} to punish his children, beating them when they disobeyed him. He used a whip on Emma, the most rebellious of them. Her mother provided scarce comfort, rarely calling on Abraham <b>to</b> <b>tone</b> <b>down</b> his beatings. Goldman later speculated that her father's furious temper was at least partly a result of sexual frustration.|$|E
5|$|Directed by Peter Maris, {{the game}} {{features}} {{a cast of}} 25 actors, all performing {{in front of a}} blue screen. While most games at the time featured 80 to 100 backgrounds, Phantasmagoria includes more than 1,000. A professional Hollywood special effects house worked on the game, and the musical score includes a neo-Gregorian chant performed by a 135-voice choir. Sierra stressed it was intended for adult audiences. The company willingly submitted it to a ratings system, and included a password-protected censoring option within the game <b>to</b> <b>tone</b> <b>down</b> the graphic content.|$|E

5|$|Dixon was {{primarily}} hired <b>to</b> <b>tone</b> <b>down</b> {{much of the}} campiness inherent in the stage musical. The 2007 film's script is based primarily on the stage musical rather than the 1988 film, so several changes already made to the plot for the stage version remain in this version. These include dropping several characters from the 1988 version (such as Arvin Hodgepile (the role Mr. Spritzer fills), Velma's husband Franklin, Corny's assistant Tammy, the beatniks, et al.), removing the Tilted Acres amusement park from the story, and placing Velma {{in charge of the}} station where The Corny Collins Show is filmed.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{had little}} {{interest}} in formal education and rarely attended classes, Sylvester was enrolled at Jordan High School. He graduated in 1969 at the age of 21; in his graduation photograph, he appeared in drag wearing a blue chiffon prom dress and beehive hairstyle. By the end of the decade, the Disquotays had begun to drift apart, with a number of them abandoning cross-dressing and others recognizing that they were trans women and undergoing sex reassignment surgery. Sylvester always considered himself male and began <b>to</b> <b>tone</b> <b>down</b> the feminine nature of his clothing, aiming for a more androgynous look which combined male and female styles and which was influenced by the fashions of the hippie movement.|$|E
5|$|Emotions {{contains}} influences from mostly 1950s, 1960s and 1970s balladry and gospel, {{as well as}} her continued work of R and soul. The album, while {{praised by}} some as more mature and raw, failed to reach the critical or commercial heights of her debut effort, while selling far less and failed to introduce Carey into a different market. Following these events, Columbia decided to try to market Carey in a similar fashion to her debut, only having her produce a more commercial and radio-friendly album. Their plans were <b>to</b> <b>tone</b> <b>down</b> Carey's vocals, and soften the album's production, leaving a more contemporary pop/R record. Agreeing to the change, Carey and Afanasieff began writing and recording material for her third studio effort, Music Box.|$|E

5|$|Operation Ferdinand formed part of Operation Bodyguard, a broad {{strategic}} military deception {{intended to}} confuse the Axis high command as to Allied intentions during the lead-up to the Normandy landings. During early 1944 {{the main thrust of}} deceptions in the Middle Eastern theatre were contained under Operation Zeppelin (including its sub-plan Vendetta), which developed threats against Greece and Southern France, and Operation Royal Flush, which ran political deceptions against Spain and Turkey. On 14 June the Allies committed to a landing in Southern France, codenamed Operation Dragoon (formerly Anvil). Royal Flush and Zeppelin were scaled back, <b>to</b> <b>tone</b> <b>down</b> the threat to France, and it was decided a new plan (Ferdinand) was required to cover the intended invasion.|$|E
5|$|The film began {{development}} in 2004, and Dixon reworked Meehan and O'Donnell's {{first draft of}} the screenplay <b>to</b> <b>tone</b> <b>down</b> the musical's campiness. In 2005, Shankman agreed to direct the film. Composer/lyricist Marc Shaiman and lyricist Scott Wittman reworked their songs from the Broadway musical for the film's soundtrack, and also wrote four new songs for the film. Principal photography commenced in September 2006 and ended in December of that year; filming took place on locations in Toronto, Ontario and Hamilton, Ontario in Canada and on soundstages at Toronto's Showline Studios. Recording sessions for the film's songs and soundtrack took place in Los Angeles, California in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the book}} {{originally}} sold very slowly, {{it became a}} Publishers Weekly bestseller. The Fall of Reach {{would go on to}} sell more than 100,000 copies by 2003 and a million copies by December 2009. The novel's success convinced Microsoft and Del Ray to pen a three-novel publishing contract for novels based on Xbox games, including another Halo novel. The next entry in the Halo novel franchise would be 2003's , written by William C. Dietz. The more human Chief seen in the novel led Bungie <b>to</b> <b>tone</b> <b>down</b> the character model in Halo 2 to make him less an exaggerated robot and more a real person inside a suit.|$|E
50|$|An angry loan shark has a {{tendency}} of getting excessively violent with anyone who doesn't have his money. His mob boss disapproves of his actions, warning him <b>to</b> <b>tone</b> things <b>down</b> or else. As expected, things only get worse.|$|R
50|$|I {{spent a lot}} of time {{studying}} S&M clothing, {{because it}} uses so much metal, silver and studs. I just tried <b>to</b> <b>tone</b> it <b>down</b> by removing some of the sexual aspects. S&M was heavy metal long before heavy metal was.|$|R
50|$|Like the Legion, the Crusade of Romanianism was a Fascist {{organisation}} {{rooted in}} mystic Orthodoxy and anti-Semitism, but presenting a more leftist and social colouring (its political programme included {{such items as}} decent wages, a mandatory 8-hour work day, and pensions for invalid workers). It {{can be interpreted as}} a more radical and working class wing of the Legion, and in this respect Stelescu’s dissidence may be compared to those of Otto Strasser or Manuel Hedilla. According to Talex, Stelescu had equal admiration for Leon Trotsky and Alfred Rosenberg. Istrati probably contributed <b>to</b> <b>toning</b> <b>down</b> anti-Semitism in the Crusades discourse.|$|R
5|$|Carey's debut studio album made {{a strong}} impact on pop music, but the singer became {{interested}} in altering her sound and branching out into other genres for her second studio effort, Emotions (1991). Columbia allowed her to take more control over her musical direction, enabling her to change the musical genre, melodies, and production style. Carey worked with many new musicians and producers on the album; Walter Afanasieff being the only holdover from her debut. Emotions contained influences from 1950s, 60s, and 70s balladry, gospel, R and soul music. The album, while praised by some as being more mature and raw, failed to reach the critical or commercial heights of her debut effort; selling fewer units and failing to introduce Carey into new markets. Columbia decided to return Carey to the same genre as her debut album and have her produce a more commercial and radio-friendly record. Their plans were <b>to</b> <b>tone</b> <b>down</b> Carey's vocals and soften the album's production to create a contemporary pop record. Carey and Afanasieff agreed to the change and began writing and recording material for her third studio effort, Music Box (1993).|$|E
5|$|From January 1996 onwards, Ranariddh's {{relations}} with Hun Sen {{began to show}} signs of tension. Hun Sen submitted a government circular to reinstate 7 January as a national holiday, the anniversary of Phnom Penh's liberation from the Khmer Rouge by Vietnamese forces. Ranariddh added his signature to the circular, which incurred the ire of Sihanouk and several FUNCINPEC leaders. A few days later, apparently <b>to</b> <b>tone</b> <b>down</b> dissatisfaction from party members, Ranariddh publicly accused the Army of Vietnam of encroaching into the territories of four Cambodian provinces bordering it. As Widyono saw it, Ranariddh intended to test Hun Sen's response to his accusations, of which the latter chose to remain quiet. During a closed-door FUNCINPEC meeting in the later part of January 1996, party members criticised Hun Sen and the CPP for monopolizing government power, and also chided Ranariddh for being too subservient to Hun Sen.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the middle}} of 24s run, the series {{attracted}} significant criticism for its depictions of torture, {{as well as its}} negative portrayal of Muslims. The frequent use of ticking time bomb scenarios in storylines, as well as the main character, Jack Bauer portraying torture as normal, effective, acceptable and glamorous, was criticized by human rights activists, military officials, and experts in questioning and interrogation, with concerns raised that junior U.S. soldiers were imitating techniques shown on the series. In response to these concerns, members of the U.S. military met with the creators of the show. Partly {{as a result of these}} discussions, and the military's appeal to the creators of the show <b>to</b> <b>tone</b> <b>down</b> the scenes of torture since it was having an impact on U.S. troops, there was a reduction in torture in subsequent seasons of the series. However, the writers stated that they reduced the number of torture scenes, not as a concession, but because it was starting to overwhelm the storytelling.|$|E
50|$|The show {{included}} Jenifer Lewis and Cree Summer as {{the first}} recurring African American lesbian characters on TV, but the role was ordered <b>to</b> be <b>toned</b> <b>down</b> for broadcast. Lewis played Juvenile Court judge Rosetta Reide, who was having a relationship with her housekeeper Danny Gates (played by Summer).|$|R
60|$|Mr Sparkler {{was much}} afflicted by the charge, {{and offered a}} most tender and earnest apology. His apology was accepted; but Mrs Sparkler {{requested}} him to go round {{to the other side}} of the sofa and sit in the window-curtain, <b>to</b> <b>tone</b> himself <b>down.</b>|$|R
5|$|Due to {{the extreme}} nature of the {{original}} NES Battletoads difficulty, almost all future ports went <b>to</b> measures <b>to</b> <b>tone</b> it <b>down</b> <b>to</b> varying degrees, seeking to make the game more accessible to casual players. The Mega Drive version of Battletoads features <b>toned</b> <b>down</b> difficulty, {{as well as providing}} higher definition and more colourful graphics as opposed to the NES version. The Game Gear port features downscaled graphics, also removing three levels and the two-player mode.|$|R
25|$|Despite {{the attempt}} <b>to</b> <b>tone</b> <b>down</b> the content, the Motion Picture Association of America deemed the film too violent to rate PG-13, so Gibson {{released}} it as unrated. The re-release showed for three weeks.|$|E

25|$|Some of {{the changes}} were related <b>to</b> <b>toning</b> <b>down</b> more mature content as well; the two scaled back on {{references}} to Aika being assaulted by Vigaro when captured by him, and of references to Ramirez obsessively talking about Galcian in later scenes of the game. Additionally, all traces of cigarettes are removed, shops serve Loqua juice instead of alcohol, and the female character Bellena's attire is altered to be less revealing. The entire project was a massive undertaking, taking four months of work with 80 to 100 hour work weeks, on a script of over 2,000 pages. The game was released in English in North America on November 13, 2000, and in Europe on April 21, 2001.|$|R

25|$|Father Charles Coughlin was an Irish-Canadian priest near Detroit, {{who became}} the most {{prominent}} Roman Catholic spokesman on political and financial issues in the 1930s, with a radio audience that reached millions every week.

50|$|One of the {{distinctive}} aspects of Team Buddies is its visual style and choice of dialogue. Censorship in the United States caused the game's vulgar and stereotyped character dialogue originally used for characters <b>to</b> be <b>toned</b> <b>down.</b> The European {{version of the}} game gave each character class different voice identities, and additionally gives each multi-player team colour its own nationality; for example blue team are stereotypical English, whereas purple are 'engrish' style Japanese.|$|R
