60|$|I {{believe that}} the great kelp-beds round Catalina are the spawning-grounds of these fish in question. And not only a spawning-ground, but, what is more important, a feeding-ground. And now the kelp-beds are being exploited. <b>The</b> <b>government</b> <b>needs</b> potash. Formerly our supply of potash came from Germany. But, {{now that we are}} not on amiable terms with those nice gentle Germans, we cannot get any potash. Hence the great, huge kelp-cutters that you hear cut only the tops of the kelp-beds. Six feet they say, and it all grows up again quickly. But in my opinion the once vast, heaving, {{wonderful}} beds of kelp along the Clemente and Catalina shores have been cut too deeply. They will die.|$|E
