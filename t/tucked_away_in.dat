The Moore children (for whom she had written several tales early in her career) were grown, and Potter had not replaced them with other children, although she continued to write letters to child fans who had written her. She was {{out of touch with}} the interests of American children. Her marriage to William Heelis on October 15, 1913 effectively ended her literary and artistic career. Although she published sporadically in the years following her marriage, her works depended principally upon decades-old concepts filed away in her publisher's offices and ageing illustrations <b>tucked</b> <b>away</b> <b>in</b> her portfolio. Only The Tale of Johnny Town-Mouse (1918) brought forth a completely new set of illustrations from the artist. She devoted herself to marriage and farming, and avoided publicity and fans.|$|E

In this state, it can literally be rolled around. Favored retreats include mammal burrows and other underground hiding places, where they also aestivate. In captivity, they are considered good pets, with their relatively small size and placid nature making them easy to handle.|$|E

25|$|When Earthrealm was young, Raiden was its protector. He {{fought the}} rogue Elder God Shinnok, {{who wished to}} {{overthrow}} his fellow gods, in a war that threatened to destroy Earthrealm itself. One of the casualties {{of the war was}} the Saurian civilization (of which Reptile is a descendant), forcing the remaining survivors to emigrate to another world, which they named Zaterra. With the aid of the Elder Gods, Raiden managed to defeat Shinnok, then banished him to the Netherealm and secured Shinnok's amulet of power in a secret location—a Temple of the Elements <b>tucked</b> <b>away</b> <b>in</b> the highest mountains of Nepal. Raiden charged four gods with guarding the amulet—the gods of Wind (Fujin), Fire, Earth and Water. When the elder Sub-Zero stole Shinnok's amulet from the temple for Quan Chi millions of years later, Raiden appeared before the Lin Kuei warrior and instructed him to enter the Netherealm and steal it back, lest Shinnok use it to free himself. Raiden could not retrieve it himself as his powers would dissipate in the Netherealm. Sub-Zero's mission into the Netherealm was a success and Shinnok was, for a time, no longer a threat. Though it was later revealed that the sorcerer Quan Chi had given Sub Zero a false amulet, Raiden never realized the counterfeit and Quan Chi would remain in possession of the true amulet for years.|$|E

500|$|Also in The Daily Telegraph, Ed West {{gave the}} book a {{favourable}} review, writing [...] "Sentimentality, in which crude emotion replaces dispassionate analysis, affects {{all aspects of}} public life, such as the debates over education, prison places and overseas aid. As Dalrymple points out, no country has ever escaped poverty via international aid—but never mind, since what matters is not actually doing anything about state education or crime or Africa, but being seen to be caring about the 'vulnerable'". [...] The book was listed as a non-fiction choice by Steven Poole in The Guardian, who wrote, [...] "Dalrymple alternates vague ranting with surgical demolition (he is excellent on the fatuity of 'family impact statements' in court), and exhibits impressive thrift, in these uncertain times, with his research, getting tens of pages out of a single visit to WHSmith and the purchase of two newspapers. Perhaps the most suggestive sentence is <b>tucked</b> <b>away</b> <b>in</b> an endnote about tattoos: 'I wish I had the space to elaborate on the dermatological semiotics of violence in England'.

500|$|The Chapel of Christ {{and of the}} Reliquaries (...) {{was built}} in 1615 and {{designed}} with ultra-Baroque details which are often difficult {{to see in the}} poorly lit interior. [...] It was originally known as the Christ of the Conquistadors. That name came from an image of Christ that was supposedly donated to the cathedral by Emperor Charles V. [...] Over time, so many reliquaries were left on its main altar that its name was eventually changed. Of 17thcentury ornamentation, the main altarpiece alternates between carvings of rich foliage and small heads on its columns in the main portion and small sculptures of angels on its telamons in the secondary portion. Its niches hold sculptures of saints framing the main body. Its crucifix is from the 17thcentury. The predella is finished with sculptures of angels, and also contains small 17thpaintings of martyred saints by Juan de Herrera. Behind these paintings, hidden compartments contain some of the numerous reliquaries left here. Its main painting was done by Jose de Ibarra and dated 1737. Surrounding the altar is a series of paintings on canvas, depicting the Passion of Christ by Jose Villegas, painted in the 17thcentury. On the right-hand wall, an altar dedicated to the Virgin of the Confidence is decorated with numerous churrigueresque figurines <b>tucked</b> <b>away</b> <b>in</b> niches, columns and top pieces.|$|E

2500|$|Early on, {{the issue}} of private token coinage served a purpose to ease {{everyday}} transactions. [...] But, by 1793, the hobby of collecting and trading various tokens achieved widespread popularity. [...] Most tokens issued {{in the early years}} were primarily intended for circulation. [...] However, manufacturers soon found that issuing token designs in very limited mintage meant they could be sold directly to collectors at tidy profits. A few enterprising collectors even funded {{the issue of}} very small mintage tokens of their own design. [...] These self-made [...] "rare" [...] tokens would then be used to trade with other collectors in an attempt to fill their collections with as many varieties as possible. [...] As evidence of the collecting craze, three extensive reference works on the indexing and collecting of provincial tokens were published before 1800 by Pye (first edition in 1795), Birchall (1796), and Conder (1798). [...] None of these three published works were undertaken by accomplished numismatic researchers, but instead were undertaken out of personal interest and were largely based on the personal collections of the authors.

Of interest here is the Saddanta Jataka tale – the fable about six tusked elephant, and the Shyama Jataka – the story about the man who dedicates his life serving his blind parents.

The memorial, a bronze and stone statue, was officially unveiled in Belfast on 8 October 1999. The ceremony was conducted in the grounds of Belfast City Hall in the presence of Magennis's son Paul, by the Lord Mayor of Belfast, Bob Stoker. Magennis's former commanding officer, Ian Fraser, was reported as saying: [...] "Jim gave me bother from time to time. He liked his tot of rum, but he was a lovely man and a fine diver.
