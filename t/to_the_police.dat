5|$|After Bamber telephoned the police, a British Telecom {{operator}} {{checked the}} White House Farm line—at 3:56am according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> log and at 4:30 am {{according to the}} Court of Appeal—and found that the line was open.

According to British Telecom, if Nevill had telephoned Bamber without replacing the receiver, the line between them would have remained open for between eight and 16 minutes. Bamber would therefore {{not have been able}} to use his telephone to report the call <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> immediately, as he said he did in one statement; in another statement he said he had first telephoned his girlfriend, Julie Mugford, in London. That the line would not have cleared is one of several disputed points.|$|E
