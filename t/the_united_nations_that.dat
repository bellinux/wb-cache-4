On January 30, 1993, Private First Class Domingo Arroyo, Jr. (1979–1993), a Marine from Puerto Rico, became the first of three Marines of Hispanic descent to die in {{what is known as the}} Battle of Mogadishu from a total of 45 American soldiers killed during the operation. The other two were Sergeant Lorenzo Ruiz and Lance Corporal Jesus Perez. Ruiz was ambushed in Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia, by Somali warlords. Perez was killed in a training accident involving an 81mm mortar.|$|E

25|$|During his term, Hammarskjöld {{tried to}} smooth {{relations}} between Israel and the Arab states. Other highlights include a 1955 visit to China {{to negotiate the}} release of 11 captured US pilots who {{had served in the}} Korean War, the 1956 establishment of the United Nations Emergency Force, and his intervention in the 1956 Suez Crisis.

25|$|More than a {{year after}} his arrest, while still in prison, Porter filed a $150 million lawsuit against the Republic of Panama, {{claiming}} damages incurred from his arrest and imprisonment in the country.

50|$|Multiple {{countries}} {{have been critical of}} the allegations made against North Korea.

Venezuela's delegation to <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>Nations</b> asserted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> allegations made by UN observers against North Korea are based on flawed criteria and are not credible. Cuba's delegation to <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>Nations</b> said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> body's claims made against North Korea are politically motivated and seek to impose isolation and pressure on the country, in violation of the Human Rights Council's stated principles.|$|R

25|$|Women's {{movements}} in Brazil {{have traditionally been}} led and supported by upper middle class women, and tend to be reformist rather than revolutionary in nature, though clear exceptions exist, most notably with regard to agrarian land reform movements. Though suffrage was granted to women in Brazil in the 1930s, {{it was not until}} the 1970s and onwards that a broader, more potent women's movement took hold in Brazil. In 1979, the year of its publishing, Brazil signed and ratified CEDAW, a convention by <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>Nations</b> <b>that</b> aims to eliminate all forms of discrimination against women. Women in Brazil enjoy the same legal rights and duties as men, which is clearly expressed in the 5th article of Brazil's 1988 Constitution.|$|E
25|$|On 11 December 2008, the United Nations General Assembly {{made history}} when it adopted the Swedish {{sponsored}} GA Resolution A/63/139 on the Strengthening of the Coordination of Emergency Assistance of <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>Nations,</b> <b>that</b> amongst other important humanitarian decisions, decided to designate 19 August as the World Humanitarian Day (WHD). The Resolution gives {{for the first}} time, a special recognition to all humanitarian and United Nations and associated personnel who have worked in {{the promotion of the}} humanitarian cause and those who have lost their lives in the cause of duty and urges all Member States, entities of the United Nations within existing resources, {{as well as the other}} International Organizations and Non-Governmental Organizations to observe it annually in an appropriate way. It marks the day on which the then Special Representative of the Secretary-General to Iraq, Sergio Vieira de Mello and his 21 colleagues were killed following the bombing of the UN Headquarters in Baghdad.|$|E

25|$|Germany, {{which has}} the largest economy in Europe, is the biggest {{contributor}} to {{the budget of the}} European Union thereby allowing Berlin an important say in the day-to-day working of the Institutions of the European Union. The rapidly ageing German socio-economic fabric is overdependent on export-driven growth whose life-lines are directly linked to the increasingly contested European project. Assertion of German leadership within the European Union faces stiff opposition to Germany's vision for the European Union in southern and eastern European countries, an ominous unease about a dominant Germany, memories of Germany's Nazi-era legacy which remain unforgotten, and currently shifting global power-centres. Restrictions imposed through the 1990 Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany effectively subordinates Germany to the Four Powers (USA, UK, France & Russia). General consensus within <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>Nations</b> <b>that</b> Europe is already over-represented within the UN Security Council is a critical obstacle for Germany's bid to become a permanent member of the UNSC. In Asia, Germany is viewed as an established Europe-centric geoeconomic power. Germany is a geopolitically insignificant entity in Asian power politics.|$|E

As {{a founding member of}} the United Nations, India strongly supports the purposes and principles of the UN and has made significant contributions to implementing the goals of the Charter, and the evolution of the UN's specialised programmes and agencies. India is a charter member of the United Nations and participates in all of its specialised agencies and organisations. India has contributed troops to United Nations peacekeeping efforts in Korea, Egypt and the Congo in its earlier years and in Somalia, Angola, Haiti, Liberia, Lebanon and Rwanda in recent years, and more recently in the South Sudan conflict. India has been a member of the UN Security Council for six terms (a total of 12 years), and was a member for the term 2011–12. India is a member of the G4 group of nations who back each other in seeking a permanent seat on the security council and advocate in favour of the reformation of the UNSC. India is also part of the Group of 77.|$|E

500|$|Kirchner took {{a pragmatic}} {{approach}} to Argentine foreign policy, and Argentina–United States relations did not continue the special {{relations of the}} 1990s. Chancellor Rafael Bielsa called {{the relationship between the}} countries [...] "cooperation without cohabitation" [...] in contrast to that of the Menem era, which was known as [...] "carnal relations". Kirchner opposed the proposed Free Trade Area of the Americas, as it was based on majority rule among all the countries of the Americas, whereas he preferred a proportional representation system that would have given the Mercosur bloc more influence. The 4th Summit of the Americas, hosted in Mar del Plata, ended with violent protests against U.S. President George W. Bush; negotiations stalled, and the FTAA was not implemented. Kirchner told <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>Nations</b> <b>that,</b> although he opposed terrorism, he did not support the War on Terror.
