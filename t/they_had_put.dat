5|$|In {{the next}} match against Lancashire, Toshack made four in Australia's 204, before {{claiming}} both openers after <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>put</b> on 48, including Test batsman Cyril Washbrook. Toshack ended with 2/40 as the match {{ended in a}} draw after the first day was washed out. It was Australia's first non-victory of the tour. After six consecutive matches {{in the space of}} 21 days, Toshack was rested for the next two matches against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge and Hampshire; the matches ended in a draw and an eight-wicket Australian win respectively.|$|E
5|$|Bradman {{thought his}} faster bowlers could not extract much bounce {{from the surface}} and soon removed the short leg fielder, and pursued a 63 {{off-side}} field with three slips and a deep point, trying to encourage the English openers {{to cut through the}} vacant area between the slips and extra cover. However, they declined Bradman's incentive and decided to bat in a low-risk manner, favouring straight-batted shots. After 80 minutes of batting, England's openers reached 50, the first time <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>put</b> on a half-century in the series. Hutton and Washbrook appeared set for the long haul, and did not react to the applause. They continued on cautiously, and persisted in eschewing the cross-batted cut and pull shots and relying on the safe accumulation of singles.|$|E
5|$|In the Second World War, the 2nd Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment and the 4th Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry held Cassel {{for three}} days {{as part of the}} {{defensive}} screen around Dunkirk during the Battle of Dunkirk and evacuation (27 May 1940 – 30 May 1940). The British forces had prepared a defence on the hilltop, emplacing anti-tank guns and barricading the narrow streets of the town. After scoring initial successes against the tanks of Panzer Regiment 11, which had made the mistake of advancing without infantry support, the British garrison was heavily attacked from the ground and the air by German forces. Much of the town was reduced to ruins by bombing. Most of the garrison's members were killed or captured by the Germans during the fighting or the subsequent attempted breakout towards Dunkirk, but the defence <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>put</b> up {{played an important role in}} holding up the Germans while the Dunkirk evacuation was taking place.|$|E

25|$|From April {{to early}} September 2010, {{the future of}} MonoTouch was put in doubt as Apple {{introduced}} new terms for iPhone developers that apparently prohibits them from developing in languages other than C, C++ and Objective-C, {{and the use of}} a middle layer between the iOS platform and iPhone applications. This made the future of MonoTouch, and other technologies such as Unity, uncertain.

25|$|In a paper {{delivered}} to the Australasian Society for Human Biology in 2009, Colin Groves and Catharine FitzGerald compared the Flores bones with those of ten people who had had cretinism, focusing on anatomical features which are typical of the disease. They found no overlap, and stated that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>put</b> the claim to rest. However, an article by Oxnard, Obendorf and Kefford rejects Groves and FitzGerald's argument and revives the cretinism hypothesis. Oxnard and colleagues also criticise the cladistic analysis of Argue et al. (2009), stating {{that it is not}} logically possible for the analysis to conclude that the Liang Bua remains represent a separate species and not a pathology because the cladistics analysis assumes that they do not represent a pathology.|$|E

After re-provisioning on 6 August, the British squadron stationed itself off Newport, then retired to Gardiner's Island on 9 August, leaving on 17 August for an eight-day cruise between the Nantucket Shoals and the east end of Long Island, returning to lie off Martha's Vineyard.|$|E
25|$|When {{speaking}} about all future Shady Records releases president Paul Rosenberg said that Eminem's next album {{would be released}} post-Memorial Day 2013 and to expect new music from it soon. He also went on to discuss the other acts saying 50 Cent's Street King Immortal would be released {{in the first half}} of 2013, with Yelawolf's second album, Love Story, currently being recorded. Rosenberg would also state that all four members of Slaughterhouse would release solo projects prior to them returning to the studio as a group to record their second album under Shady Records. The first album released would be Joe Budden's No Love Lost on February 5, 2013 under E1 Music. The second would be Kxng Crooked's Apex Predator released under Treacherous C.O.B and Empire Distribution. However, Royce and Joell Ortiz of Slaughterhouse would confirm in May 2013 that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>put</b> their solo projects on hold, and had begun working on their third studio album.|$|E

The Chief Constable of Northern Ireland, James Flanagan together {{with his wife and two}} police officers with their families were travelling to London to attend an investiture; the two officers were to receive the British Empire Medal from Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace for their work during the Northern Ireland Troubles. The MP James Molyneaux, Chief Whip for the Ulster Unionist Party and a senior member of the Orange Order was also on the flight.

25|$|Noor's {{head and}} penis were never recovered, {{although}} Linda later admitted <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>put</b> {{the head in}} rubbish bins around Phoenix Park. It was also thought that they carried the head by bus to Tallaght and buried it in a field, with Linda returning later to dig it up, carry it to another field using her son's schoolbag, smash it further with a hammer and bury it again. Linda attracted further media attention when she slit her wrists and was sectioned. Charlotte also attracted media attention when a photograph of her holding a knife to a male prisoner's throat was published; that action resulted in an increased security presence in all Irish prisons and Charlotte was moved from Mountjoy to Limerick. Kathleen Mulhall voluntarily returned to Ireland in February 2008 and faced several charges.

500|$|The fort itself, sited on {{the west}} bank of the Richelieu River, {{consisted}} of two earthen redoubts about [...] apart, surrounded by a ditch [...] wide and [...] deep that was lined with chevaux de frise. [...] The southern redoubt was roughly 250 by 200 feet (80 by 65 metres), and it contained 6 buildings, including a bake house, the fort's magazine, and storage houses. The northern redoubt was slightly larger, enclosing a two-storey stone house that was used as a barracks. [...] The defenders had cleared brush for several hundred yards around the fort to ensure a clear field of fire. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> <b>put</b> up a wooden palisade to the west of the redoubts, and dug a trench connecting the two redoubts, for ease of communications. The eastern side of the fort faced the river, where there was a shipyard and anchorage for Royal Savage.|$|E
500|$|The canal finally {{opened on}} 15 August 1833, amid {{celebrations}} {{at both ends}} of the canal and a cavalcade to and from Highbridge to Glastonbury. A second celebration for the [...] "respectable trading classes" [...] was held nine days later. The first cargo of wood from Canada arrived in July 1835. The canal appears to have been successful initially, but the revenues generated were inadequate, and there were problems with water levels on the upper section. In 1840, the Prat brothers, whose legal firm had played a major part in the creation of the canal, disappeared, leaving a financial shortfall of over £40,000. It appears that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>put</b> up most of the extra costs of construction, and may have borrowed some money from client's funds. They were declared bankrupt and Richard Prat was removed from office as town clerk and a Commissioner of Sewers, but the firm's collapse had a serious effect on the prosperity of Glastonbury.|$|E
