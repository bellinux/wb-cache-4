50|$|Most modern North American, some European and Japanese {{cars have}} an {{automatic}} transmission that selects an appropriate gear ratio without any operator intervention. They primarily use hydraulics to select gears, depending on pressure exerted by fluid within the <b>transmission</b> <b>assembly.</b> Rather than using a clutch {{to engage the}} transmission, a fluid flywheel, or torque converter is placed in between the engine and transmission. It is possible for the driver to control the number of gears in use or select reverse, though precise control of which gear is in use {{may or may not}} be possible.|$|E
5000|$|King {{joined the}} Olds Motor Works around 1900, but {{resigned}} after their plant burned down. He then joined the Northern Manufacturing Company in 1902 and in 1903 became their chief engineer until 1908. One well known car he designed was the two-cylinder [...] "Silent Northern" [...] - the automobile {{with the first}} integrated motor and <b>transmission</b> <b>assembly</b> and the first side-step running boards. The 1907 Northern car model also had three-point engine suspension, air brakes, an air-controlled clutch and other innovations new to the auto industry of the time.|$|E
5000|$|Transmission {{problems}} were tackled {{by adding a}} further mounting-point (making five) for the whole engine and <b>transmission</b> <b>assembly</b> {{at the back of}} the gearbox where it was supported by an extra chassis cross-member. The transmission made a significant humming noise while in neutral and there were difficulties with excessive vibration from oil surge in the fluid flywheel when picking up under heavy load at low speed. The transmission mechanism for top-gear was modified to reduce pedal pressure and ensure positive engagement and disengagement while avoiding a humming sound in neutral.|$|E
5000|$|The gearbox {{had five}} ratios with {{synchromesh}} on all gears. A conventional Borg & Beck clutch with mechanical linkage was used and {{drive from the}} gearbox was by shaft to the rear combined transfer box and differential assembly which incorporated reverse gear, thereby allowing five reverse gears also, and then by a long shaft to the front differential which incorporated a simple dog clutch to enable four-wheel drive when required. A conventional separate transfer case was not possible due to the cruciform layout of the vehicle chassis which placed the junction of the cruciform where the transfer box would reside on a conventional ladder-type chassis. Bendix [...] "Tracta" [...] type constant velocity joints were fitted at all wheel stations. All <b>transmission</b> <b>assemblies</b> were sealed against the ingress of water.|$|R

The computer-controlled transmission allows it to climb grades rated up to 60%, and can ford waterways of up to 1.25 m on-the-fly.

50|$|The {{mainshaft}} extends {{outside the}} case in both directions: the input shaft towards the engine, and the output shaft towards the rear axle (on rear wheel drive cars.

At the point of the split, a pilot bearing holds the shafts together. The gears and clutches ride on the mainshaft, the gears being free to turn relative to the mainshaft except when engaged by the clutches.|$|E

The engine retained the Bosch K-Jetronic fuel injection system of its predecessor, but was fitted with a Marelli MED 806 A electronic ignition system, to produce a claimed power output of [...] at 7000 rpm. As with the preceding 308 models the engine was mounted in unit with the all synchromesh five-speed manual <b>transmission</b> <b>assembly,</b> which was below, and {{to the rear of the}} engine's sump.|$|E

50|$|After World War I, {{the three}} {{brothers}} decided {{to expand the}} company and to concentrate on drive technologies. By 1922, Voith had begun building <b>transmission</b> gear <b>assemblies,</b> based on its fluid-dynamics know-how gained from previous turbine projects.

5000|$|The 308 had a tube {{frame with}} {{separate}} body. The 308 GTB/GTS and GT4 were mechanically similar, and also shared {{much with the}} original Dino. Both 308s sit on the same tube platform, however the GT4—being a 2+2—has a longer wheelbase.The engine was a V8 of a 90 degree configuration, with belt-driven twin overhead camshafts per cylinder bank. It was transversely mounted in unit with the transaxle <b>transmission</b> <b>assembly,</b> which was below and {{to the rear of}} the engine's sump. All models used a fully synchromesh 5-speed [...] "dog-leg" [...] manual gearbox and a clutch-type limited slip differential.Suspension was all-independent, comprising double wishbones, coaxial coil springs and hydraulic dampers, and anti-roll bars on both axles; four wheel vented disc brakes were also fitted. Steering was unassisted rack and pinion.|$|E
5000|$|In other cases, {{the goal}} is {{producing}} the best instantaneous satellite estimate, which is the High Resolution Precipitation Product approach. In either case, of course, the less-emphasized goal is also considered desirable. One key result of the multi-satellite studies is that including even {{a small amount of}} surface gauge data is very useful for controlling the biases that are endemic to satellite estimates. The difficulties in using gauge data are that 1) their availability is limited, as noted above, and 2) the best analyses of gauge data take two months or more after the observation time to undergo the necessary <b>transmission,</b> <b>assembly,</b> processing and quality control. Thus, precipitation estimates that include gauge data tend to be produced further after the observation time than the no-gauge estimates. As a result, while estimates that include gauge data may provide a more accurate depiction of the [...] "true" [...] precipitation, they are generally not suited for real- or near-real-time applications.|$|E

40|$|Manufacturing {{automotive}} powertrain components (engines and transmissions) is {{a complex}} task involving the integration of hundreds of components. Simulation is commonly applied {{in the design and}} implementation of such production systems. Examples of such systems are the crankshaft machining line, engine final <b>assembly</b> and <b>transmission</b> final <b>assembly,</b> to name a few. Invariably, different engine and transmission sub-assemblies are machined and assembled on separate systems. The completed sub-assemblies are then assembled to the engine or <b>transmission</b> main <b>assembly.</b> There are many areas within a powertrain assembly plant that show complicated behavior due to the varying nature of manufacturing processes. Not only the variation in process, but the schedules, availability of workers, and the performance of material handling equipment are only few of the factors contributing to the randomness in operation. Test areas where the final assembly is inspected for functionality present an example of such highly random operation. Simulation is a very useful tool for investigating the behavior of such complicated systems. This paper discusses the need for and uses of discrete event simulation in the design of manufacturing systems for powertrain assemblies. The benefits of such applications of simulation are illustrated by using a sample study of the final engine test and repair area. ...|$|R

In order to conduct the experimental programme, a new test rig and associated data processing and assessment capability was developed. Wearing couples in homogeneous and heterogeneous arrangements were tested to assess {{the effectiveness of the}} nitriding process as a fretting palliative-the heterogeneous mating is particularly representative of configurations found in aerospace <b>transmission</b> <b>assemblies.</b> A range of test conditions were examined with a line contact, including normal loads from 25 to 65 Nmm- 1, displacement amplitudes from 10 to 100 µm and temperatures from 24 to 450 °C. At ambient temperatures, the wear behaviour was assessed using an energy-wear analysis, whereupon it was demonstrated that the wear volume was a linear function of the dissipated frictional energy (over the range of loading conditions) with a significant energy threshold before the onset of wear. Accordingly, the fretting wear over the full range of loading conditions could be described by a single wear rate and threshold value. The wear rate for homogeneous couples of nitrided super-CMV (SCMVN) was found to be 12...|$|R
