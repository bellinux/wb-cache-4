40|$|AbstractPoor adiposities are {{risk factors}} for major morbidities, but reports on how these relate with gait {{function}} of stroke patients undergoing rehabilitation is sparse and need further investigation. A convenience sample of 94 ambulatory stroke survivors and 94 matched apparently healthy individuals were assessed for adiposity markers (body mass index, waist circumference, <b>thigh</b> <b>girth,</b> waist-hip ratio, and percent body fat) and gait parameters (cadence, step length, stride length, stride width, gait velocity, and cycle). Mean age of the stroke and apparently healthy participants were 57 ± 5. 2 years and 56. 9 ± 4. 8 years, respectively. We found significant (p< 0. 05) relationships between waist circumference and each of gait cycle (r= 0. 67) namely, cadence (r=− 0. 68), stride length (− 0. 62), step length (− 0. 61), and gait velocity (− 0. 75). Fairly similar correlations existed between body mass index, waist-hip ratio, percent body fat, <b>thigh</b> <b>girth,</b> and each of gait parameters, with only the <b>thigh</b> <b>girth</b> significantly correlating with stride width (r= 0. 79). Obesity more than triples the odds of low gait velocities (odds ratio: 3. 28; 95 % confidence interval: 1. 60 – 6. 74). Findings provide clinicians with likely influence of adiposities on gait parameters of stroke patients. This may inform treatment decision and help to prioritize interventions through adiposity management for stroke patients undergoing rehabilitation...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the change in body composition, leg girths, and muscle strength of patients with incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI) after functional electrical stimulation cycling exercises (FESCE). Eighteen subjects with incomplete SCI were recruited. Each patient received FESCE three times per week for 8 weeks.

30|$|To {{avoid this}} problem, Wroble and Lindenfeld [29] {{introduced}} the “stabilized Lachman test,” {{in which the}} patient’s thigh is supported on a bolster. They reported better reproducibility of the test due to better control over tibial rotation and a fixed knee flexion angle during the examination. In 1995 [26], Draper and Schulthies described the “alternate Lachman test” as a modification of the “prone Lachman test” first introduced by Feagin [27]. They found that {{the sensitivity of the}} standard Lachman test was 28  %, that of the anterior drawer test was 59  %, while that of the alternate Lachman test was 78  % in subjects with large <b>thigh</b> <b>girths</b> (more than 43  cm).

40|$|OBJECTIVES: In 1997, {{anthropometry}} {{measures were}} made to determine the body size and shapes of both senior and junior elite triathletes. Since then, the junior event distance has changed and the optimal morphology of participants may have evolved. Thus {{the objective of this}} study was to compare the morphology of 1997 World championship junior elite triathlon competitors with junior elite competitors in 2011. DESIGN: Comparative study of junior elite triathlete kinanthropometry. METHODS: Twenty-nine males and 20 females junior elite competitors in the 1997 Triathlon World Championships underwent 26 anthropometric measurements. Results were compared with 28 male and 14 female junior elite triathletes who competed in the 2011 Australian National Junior Series, as qualifying for 2011 Triathlon World Championships. Comparisons were made on the raw scores, as well as somatotype, and body proportional scores. RESULTS: Both male and female junior elite triathletes in the 2011 group were significantly more ectomorphic than their 1997 counterparts. The 2011 triathletes were also proportionally lighter, with significantly smaller flexed arm and <b>thigh</b> <b>girths,</b> and femur breadths. The 2011 males recorded significantly longer segmental lengths and lower endomorphy values than the 1997 junior males. CONCLUSIONS: Junior elite triathlete morphology has evolved during the past 14 years possibly as a result of changing race distance and race tactics, highlighting the importance of continually monitoring and updating such anthropometric data...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if consistent participation in bench stepping leads to a decreased hamstrings to quadriceps ratio. Thirty-two healthy volunteers without pathological conditions of the knee joint participated in three, one-hour bench stepping classes each week for eight weeks. Each subject 2 ̆ 7 s strength and endurance of the hamstrings and quadriceps muscles were measured before and after the eight week stepping program using a Cybex 340 Isokinetic Dynamometer (Lumex, Ronkankoma, New York). <b>Thigh</b> <b>girth</b> was also measured before and after the exercise program. T-tests were used to evaluate the data. Significant increases were found in hamstring strength and endurance, quadriceps strength and endurance, and in the hamstrings to quadriceps strength ratio. <b>Thigh</b> <b>girth</b> and the hamstrings to quadriceps endurance ratio did not significantly change. The results of this study suggest that bench stepping does not lead to a muscle imbalance in the knee. In fact, more equivalent coactivation in the hamstrings and quadriceps occurs during bench stepping. It is therefore not anticipated that bench stepping with cause muscle imbalances which will produce knee injury or dysfunction...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The aims of {{the present}} study were to assess {{competitive}} sprinters’ body size and composition and to determine their impact on performance. METHODS: Ninety-eight competitive male sprinters (100 m) participated in this cross-sectional study. A series of measurements was directly taken and data on muscular strength and power tests were self-reported. Body composition was assessed by skinfold method and somatotype was calculated by the Heath-Carter anthropometric method. Sprinters were classified into three groups depending on their personal best time and comparisons were performed between the athletes in the top and in the bottom tertiles. Relationships between anthropometric traits and performance were assessed by Pearson’s correlation coefficients. RE SULTS: Top sprinters had significantly greater body mass index, relaxed and contracted upper arm <b>girths,</b> <b>thigh</b> and calf <b>girths,</b> fat free mass and fat free mass index, and lower ectomorphy than the lowest tertile. Strength and power were significantly higher. Personal best time was significantly correlated with several anthropometric traits and indices of lean body mass. CONCLUSIONS: Body size, composition and somatotype differ between performance levels in speed running. Being less ectomorphic, with a greater fat free mass and strength, can explain significant differences in sprinting performances. The results presented in this study provide a point of reference about sprinter characteristics, which can help coaches and sport scientists to improve sprinter performance...|$|R
40|$|Janet Kupperman, FACSM Rockhurst University, Kansas City, Missouri The {{measurement}} of body composition {{is integral to}} assessing fitness and included in professional competencies outlined by the American College of Sports Medicine and the National Strength and Conditioning Association. Thus, it is incumbent on faculty/programs in exercise science {{to provide students with}} experiences to promote the knowledge, skills, and dispositions to assess body composition. While it is customary to include content knowledge and some skills practice in courses like Physiology of Exercise, reflection on dispositions may occur less frequently. PURPOSE: The {{purpose of this study was}} to address dispositions while reviewing skills for assessing girths and skinfolds. Specifically, students explored the consequences of using techniques for measuring girths and skinfolds that do not comply with approved methods (e. g., measuring over clothing and subtracting the estimated thickness of the clothing and altered limb positioning). METHODS: Students reviewed techniques for assessing height, weight, circumferences, and skinfolds that they had previously practiced in other courses and also discussed techniques to promote subject comfort and measurement accuracy. After measuring girths and skinfolds using techniques consistent with those illustrated in their text book, students used specified non-conforming techniques for chest, waist, hip, and <b>thigh</b> <b>girths</b> and for chest, thigh, abdomen, triceps, suprailium, and subscapula skinfolds. They reflected on differences in laboratory reports and discussed professional options for dealing with situations in student and employee roles during which they could feel pressured to use methods that do not conform with best practices. RESULTS: Twenty-six students gave informed consent for their data to be included in the analysis. Difference scores (approved minus non-conforming) were calculated for girths, skinfolds, body density, and percent fat. 71. 9 % of the difference scores were lower for unapproved techniques and 25. 3 % were higher. Mean girth difference was 0. 4 ± 1. 08 inches. Mean skinfold difference was - 1. 63 ± 4. 83 mm. CONCLUSION: The activity provided students with a concrete understanding of the importance of using measurement techniques associated with best practices. Additionally, their awareness of challenges they may experience in the field was enhanced.

40|$|Background: An {{increased}} central {{distribution of}} fat with advanc-ing age {{is associated with}} chronic metabolic and cardiovascular abnormalities. Little {{is known about the}} magnitude or pattern of fat distribution and its association with healthy aging. Objective: This study describes 10 -y changes in body composi-tion at 11 anthropometric sites in elderly persons and the metabolic and physical activity factors associated with these changes. Design: Skinfold thicknesses, girths, body fat by hydrodensitom-etry, physical activity by questionnaire, and metabolic variables were examined twice, 9. 4 1. 4 y apart, in 54 men and 75 women aged 60. 4 7. 8 y at baseline. Results: Subcutaneous fat declined (17. 2 %; P 0. 001), whereas total fat mass increased (7. 2 %; P 0. 05). Waist and hip circumfer-ence changes were the best anthropometric predictors of total fat mass change (r 2 0. 40 – 0. 65, P 0. 0001). <b>Thigh</b> <b>girth</b> change was more strongly associated with fat-free mass change (r 2 0. 22, P 0. 01) than with fat mass change (r 2 0. 07, P 0. 05) in women. An increase in physical activity was associated with an attenuation of <b>thigh</b> <b>girth</b> decline in men and women (F ratio 5. 13, P 0. 007). Traditional metabolic markers of visceral adiposity (triacylglycerol, glucose, and total cholesterol) were not significantly related to the change in waist circumference. Conclusions: Skinfold thicknesses cannot be used to assess changes in body fat mass because of age-related fat redistribution. Higher levels of physical activity can attenuate the decline in appendicular lean tissue expected over 10 y. Waist and thigh girths, rather than skinfold thicknesses, should be considered for use in longitudinal stud-ies in the elderly because the changes in these girths capture increased abdominal adiposity and sarcopenia, respectively.

Forty two naval personnel (age 27 ± 4. 1 years; body mass 86. 2 ± 4. 9 kg; height 184. 6 ± 7. 4 cm; body fat percentage 17. 3 ± 5. 2) participated in this study. In order to evaluate the fitness of the naval servicemen, we applied a testing procedure that included measurements of 7 fitness tests and 15 body anthropometric tests. A negative correlation was found between the body fat percentage and all the analyzed sprint tests and three anaerobic power tests (r), SP 5 (r=– 0. 42), SP 10 (r=– 0. 51), SP 20 (r=– 0. 53), SJ (r=– 0. 45), CM (r=– 0. 57), SLJ (r=– 0. 67). Also a negative correlation was found between the body fat percentage and VO 2 max (r=– 0. 44). A positive correlation was found between the sprint test and the power performance test and <b>thigh</b> and calf <b>girth.</b> Spiriting ability is influenced by the strength of a person. This is one of the reasons why we found a positive correlation between the sprint test (SP 5, SP 10 and SP 20) and <b>thigh</b> and calf <b>girth.</b> In this study we found a negative correlation between body fat percentages and all the sprint tests and three anaerobic power tests and VO 2 max.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the effects of bodyweight squat exercise on muscle mass, muscle strength, and function in frail older adults. METHODS: Fifteen older adults (mean age= 78. 7 yr) who needed assistance performing ADL according to long term care insurance regulations in the Japan participated in the study. Participants performed squat exercise using bodyweight as resistance for one set consisting of 48 reps twice weekly for 12 weeks. Body mass, <b>thigh</b> <b>girth,</b> thigh muscle thickness assessed by B-mode ultrasound, knee extension strength (KES), static and dynamic balance (static (SB) : sway velocity (SV) standing on firm or foam surfaces with eyes open or closed; dynamic (DB) : limits of stability) were measured before and after the intervention. RESULTS: Following the intervention, participants decreased (p< 0. 05) body mass by 1. 6 % (7. 4 ± 11. 4 to 56. 5 ± 11. 1 kg (mean±SD)), and increased KES by 10. 0 % (66. 9 ± 22. 2 to 73. 6 ± 24 Nm/kg) and KES relative to body mass by 16. 7 % (1. 2 ± 0. 4 to 1. 3 ± 0. 4 Nm/kg).

Various studies have reported mass exponents (b) greater than the anticipated 'surface-area' exponent 0. 67, often closer to 0. 75 originally identified by Kleiber. AIM: The study aimed to provide a biological explanation for these 'inflated' exponents when modelling maximum oxygen uptake (max), based on the observations from this and previous studies that larger individuals develop disproportionately more muscle mass in the arms and legs. RESEARCH DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: A cross-sectional study of 119 professional soccer players from Croatia aged 18 - 34 was carried out. RESULTS: Here we confirm that the {{power function}} relationship between max and body mass of the professional soccer players results in an 'inflated' mass exponent of 0. 75 (95 % confidence interval from 0. 56 to 0. 93), but also the larger soccer players have disproportionately greater leg muscle girths. When the analysis was repeated incorporating the calf and <b>thigh</b> muscle <b>girths</b> rather than body mass as predictor variables, the analysis not only explained significantly more of the variance in max, but the sum of the exponents confirmed a surface-area law. CONCLUSIONS: These findings confirm the pitfalls of fitting body-mass power laws and suggest using muscle-girth methodology as a more appropriate way to scale or normalize metabolic variables such as max for individuals of different body sizes...|$|R
40|$|Human {{physique}} classification by somatotype {{assumes that}} adult humans are geometric similar to each other. However, this assumption {{has yet to}} be adequately tested in athletic and nonexercising human populations. In this study, we assessed this assumption by comparing the mass exponents associated with girth measurements taken at 13 different sites throughout the body in 478 subjects (279 athletic subjects, and 199 nonexercising controls). Corrected girths which account for subcutaneous adipose tissue at the upper arm, thigh, and calf sites, and which simulate muscle circumference, were also calculated. If subjects are geometrically similar to each other, girth exponents should be approximately proportional to M(1 / 3), where M is the subjects' body mass. This study confirms that human adult physiques are not geometrically similar to each other. In both athletic subjects and nonexercising controls, body circumferences/limb girths develop at a greater rate than that anticipated by geometric similarity in fleshy sites containing both muscle and fat (upper arms and legs), and less than anticipated in bony sites (head, wrists, and ankles). Interestingly, head girths appear to remain almost constant, irrespective of subjects' body size/mass. The results also suggest that <b>thigh</b> muscle <b>girths</b> of athletes and controls increase at a greater rate than that predicted by geometric similarity, proportional to body mass (M(0. 439) and M(0. 377), respectively). These systematic deviations from geometric similarity have serious implications for the allometric scaling of variables such as energy expenditure, oxygen uptake, anaerobic power, and thermodynamic or anthropometric studies involving individuals of differing size...|$|R

40|$|Introduction Chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) {{is accompanied by}} several extra-pulmonary consequences, such as skeletal muscle weakness and atrophy which will {{have a negative impact}} on daily life in patients and lead to their debilitation; therefore, when treating COPD patients, protocols should be taken into account to improve function and quality of life (QoL). Case Presentation The case was a 71 - year-old woman suffering from chronic bronchitis and bronchiectasis for 30 years that has been faced with increased musculoskeletal disorders in recent months. The case was managed by downhill treadmill walking for four months with the aim of improving her functional ability and QoL. Functional tests, <b>thigh</b> <b>girth</b> measurement and St. george’s respiratory questionnaire (SGRQ) were used to assess the physical status and QoL of the patient. The outcomes measures confirmed the improvement of the studied case. The improvements continued three months after the beginning of the treatment. Conclusions The eccentric exercise therapy in the form of downhill walking had positive effects on functions and QoL of studied case, especially had an augmenting effect on the thigh muscles size...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{identify}} homogeneous groups of camels according to their conformation, 212 camels (155 females and 57 males) from 9 regions of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and belonging to 12 different camel breed or types were measured. The body measurements included {{the length of the}} head, of the neck, of the udder and of the teat, the height at the withers, and the circumference of the neck, of the <b>thigh</b> and at <b>girth.</b> The 12 breeds were compared according to their mean body measurements and the groups with similar conformation were identified by Automatic Hierarchical Classification on Ward distance. Finally, 4 types of female camel conformation were identified: small size breed from mountains and Red Sea coast, big size camel from desert areas, and 2 breeds, Zargeh with small size but with wide chest and neck, and Asail (racing camel) with very thin neck and leg and poorly developed udder. Six groups of males are identified also but with a different distribution. This classification is close to the typology based on the ecosystem distribution of camel breeds in Saudi Arabia.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to describe the morphological profile of professional dancers compared with university physical education students. Thirty-five subjects were evaluated as follows: 13 professional ballet dancers of the Bolshoi Theater Company, six males and seven females, and 22 university physical education students, 11 males and 11 females. Body mass, height, skinfold (triceps, biceps, subscapular, chest, axilla, supraspinale, Iliac crest, abdominal, Front <b>thigh,</b> medial calf) <b>girth</b> (Arm flexed and tensed, forearm, waist, gluteal girth, Mid-thigh girth and calf) and breadth (wrist, ankle, Biepicondylar humerus and femur) were evaluated and somatotype, body fat percentage (BF%) body mass index (BMI), S 7 Skinfolds lean body mass, bone, residual and muscle mass were calculated. Dancers showed lower values for BMI, sum of seven skinfolds, BF%, body fat percentage, fat mass, residual mass (p< 0. 05). For females, lean body mass was also lower in the group of dancers. Body muscle values were lower for university physical education students of both sexes (p< 0. 05). When assessing differences between male and female dancers and male and female university physical education students, dancers appeared to be more homogeneous than students. As for somatotype, male dancers showed predominance of mesomorphy over the other components and female dancers showed predominance of ectomorphy. The intense training in classical ballet interfered in body composition components, changing them significantly...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the relationship between physiological and anthropometric qualities and tackling ability in rugby league players. Twelve rugby league players (mean ± SD age, 24. 4 ± 3. 5 years) underwent a standardized 1 -on- 1 tackling drill in a 10 -m grid. Video footage {{was taken from the}} rear, side, and front of the defending player. Tackling proficiency was assessed using standardized technical criteria. In addition, all players underwent measurements of anthropometry (stature, body mass, sum of 7 skinfolds, arm, chest, waist, gluteal, <b>thigh,</b> and calf <b>girths,</b> and biepicondylar humerus and femur breadths), somatotype (endomorphy, mesomorphy, and ectomorphy), acceleration (5 - and 10 -m sprint), change-of-direction speed (modified 505 test), lower-body muscular power (vertical jump), and upper-body muscular power (overhead medicine ball throw). Differences in tackling ability and physiological and anthropometric qualities between the best (N = 6) and worst (N = 6) tacklers were compared using the Cohen effect size (ES) statistic. Eta coefficients (η) were used to determine the relationships among physiological and anthropometric qualities and tackling proficiency. Better tacklers were older (ES = 1. 9), more experienced (ES = 1. 0), shorter (ES = 1. 2), lighter (ES = 2. 3), and leaner (ES = 1. 3) than players with poor tackling proficiency. Better tacklers also had greater levels of mesomorphy (ES = 0. 3), acceleration (ES = 2. 3), and change-of-direction speed (ES = 0. 5) than poor tacklers. The strongest correlates of tackling ability were age (η = 0. 70), skinfold thickness (η = − 0. 68), body mass (η = − 0. 72), waist girth (η = − 0. 79), gluteal girth (η = − 0. 74), and level of endomorphy (η = − 0. 65). These findings demonstrate that well-developed physiological and anthropometric qualities contribute to effective tackling ability in rugby league players...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Human Movement Science)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2004. The {{prevalence}} of morphological asymmetry amongst sport participants and sedentary individuals {{has been well}} documented. The importance of studies in this field is accentuated {{by the fact that}} morphological asymmetry has a negative effect on the health and performance of elite athletes. The purpose of this study was, therefore, firstly to determine whether significant differences for thirty five anthropometrical measurements exist between the dominant and nondominant sides of male (n = 16) and female (n = 11) crawl stroke swimmers. Dependent t-tests were used for this purpose. All of the measurements were taken twice on both the dominant and nondominant sides of the body, according to the methods described by Norton et al. (1996). Amongst the male swimmers, the (relaxed-, tensed- and corrected-) upper arm girths, wrist girth, <b>thigh</b> <b>girth</b> and lower leg length showed statistically significant (p < 0. 05) differences. Amongst the female swimmers statistically significant (p < 0. 05) differences were found for the <b>thigh</b> <b>girth,</b> upper leg length and foot length. The second purpose was to compare the indices of morphological asymmetry of twenty upper body anthropometrical variables of the male swimmers to that of male fast bowlers (n = 27) and aged-matched sedentary males (n = 27). This comparison was done using an ANOVA with Tukey post hoc tests. The indices of morphological asymmetry were determined with Wolaiiski's Relative Indices of Asymmetry (RIA). The RIA for the twenty upper body measurements for the three groups in this comparison are also reported. Statistically significant (p < 0. 05) differences were found for the (relaxed, tensed and corrected) upper arm girths and halfchest girth when the fast bowlers were compared to the male swimmers {{as well as for the}} comparison between the fast bowlers and the sedentary individuals. A statistically significant (p < 0. 05) difference was also found for the hand length between the fast bowlers and the sedentary individuals. To conclude, all four of the measured groups showed indices of morphological asymmetry for certain anthropometrical variables, with the fast bowlers showing the highest indices and the swimmers showing the lowest indices of morphological asymmetry. These results support the notion that swimming may have preventive and therapeutic value for athletes who show a high degree of morphological asymmetry due to participation in unilateral sport types. Further research is, however, required. Master...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the appropriate elasticity of the textile material used for making women's girdle. Background: The elastic textiles have been used for making girdle. The hard type girdle gave high pressure on the body to make slim look. However, excessively high garment pressure caused negative effect to human bodies. This study studied the material giving proper garment pressure in girdle. Method: In this study five experimental girdles were made fabrics with various elasticities. The change of garment pressures and body girths were measured after subjects wearing the experimental girdles. The garment pressure was measured at 10 points. Body girths measured at abdomen, hip, and thigh. Results: The garment pressure of the commercial girdle was high at side of waistband, side femur and back gluteal fold. The experimental girdles made with high elasticity material definitely lowered garment pressure at those points. After wearing experimental girdle their abdomen and hip girths measurements were decreased. But, <b>thigh</b> <b>girth</b> was not reduced. Conclusion: The girdle made with excellent elasticity materials reduced garment pressure significantly and it made body slim as much as the commercial girdle except the thighs. Application: This study provides guideline for the developin...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{effects of}} TENS before {{exercise}} (TBE) and TENS after exercise (TAE) {{in the management}} of knee osteoarthritis (OA) were compared. METHODS: Fifteen participants with knee OA were alternatively assigned to either TBE or TAE groups. Participants ’ pain, active knee flexibility, <b>thigh</b> <b>girth,</b> disability, and activity levels were assessed at baseline {{and at the end of}} eight-week study. Mixed design two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) at P   0. 05 was used to compare the two groups. RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 58. 1   ±  10. 9 years. Post-intervention comparison showed that TAE had significantly lower scores (1. 9 ±  0. 9) than TBE (4. 3   ±  1. 5) on Disability Index Questionnaire (DIQ) (F-ratio  =  10. 5; P  =  0. 006), and significantly lower scores (0. 8   ±  0. 3) than TBE (1. 4 ±  0. 6) on Patient Assessment Scale (PAS) (F-ratio  =  8. 3; P  =  0. 013).

40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{the effect of a}} 12 -week exercise programme consisting of jogging, calistnenics, and recreational activities on the cardiorespiratory function and body composition of 15 young and 15 middle-aged nonobese women 21 - 32 and 34 - 57 years, respectively. The exercise programme was 3 days per week for an average of 45 minutes each session. Pre- and post-programme data were obtained on: age, height, total body weight, resting heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, vital capacity, submaximal heart rate, supra-iliac skinfold, <b>thigh</b> skinfold, waist <b>girth,</b> cup size, body density, and percent fat. The t-test was used to test the difference between the young and middle-aged groups before and after the exercise programme and to test the pre- and post-programme mean values of each group. No differences between the groups or changes due to the exercise programme were observed on total body weight. No significant cardiorespiratory {{differences were found between the}} two groups at either test period, however, the young group decreased significantly (p <. 01) in submaximal HR and the middle-aged group decreased significantly in resting (p <. 01) and submaximal (p <. 001) HR illustrating the positive effect of the programme. No significant body composition differences were found between the two groups at the pre-test. At the post-test the middle-aged group had a significantly (p <. 10) larger thigh skinfold thickness than the young group. The young group did not change significantly on body composition measures from pre- to post-test. In contrast, the middle-aged group increased significantly in body density (p <. 01) and decreased in percent body fat (p <. 01) due to a significant (p <. 01) reduction in supra-iliac skinfold thickness from 21. 67 ± 2. 35 to 18. 13 ± 2. 08 mm. The data were compared with data from other studies using similar age groups. The pre-test percent fat of the young group (25. 07 ±. 74) was similar to values reported in other studies. The middle-aged group had a relatively lower fat percentage (27. 46 ± 1. 58) compared with other middle-aged groups...|$|R
40|$|There {{is little}} {{information}} on anthropometric measures (i. e., length, breadth and girth of body's parts) related to throwing ability. To clarify {{the influence of}} the physique on the throwing ability, the relationships between physique and throwing distance, as well as ball speed were investigated. The subjects were fourty-nine high school baseball players, and thirty-eight high school volleyball players, football players and canoeists served as a control group. The throwing distance was significantly related to lean body mass (r=. 290), chest girth (r=. 416), upper arm girth (r=. 307), abdominal girth (r=. 288), <b>thigh</b> <b>girth</b> (r=. 327) and lower leg girth (r=. 285) in baseball players group (p< 0. 05 - 0. 01). A significant relationship between the throwing distance and foot length in control group (r=. 329, p< 0. 05) was demonstrated. Significant relationships between ball speed and standing height in the baseball players group (r=. 354, p< 0. 01) and that between ball speed and Impedance in the control group (r=-. 288, p< 0. 05) were ovserved. These findings indicate that the throwing distance is influenced by quantity of body muscle in baseball players. There was no relation between physique and throwing ability in unskilled players...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Understand the {{effectiveness}} of foam rolling as a recovery tool following exercise induced muscle damage (EIMD), analyzing: muscle soreness, dynamic and passive range of motion (ROM), along with evoked and voluntary neuromuscular properties. [...] Methods: 20 male subjects with 3 + years of strength training experience were randomly divided into either the control (CON) (n= 10) or foam rolling (FR) (n= 10) group. All subjects followed the same testing protocol. The only between group difference was that the FR group performed a 20 -minute foam rolling exercise protocol {{at the end of}} the testing session at post-test 0, 24, and 48 hours (POST- 0, POST- 24, POST- 48). Subjects participated in 5 testing sessions: [1] orientation and 1 repetition maximum (1 RM) back squat, [2] pre-test measurements (PRE), 10 x 10 squat protocol (weight: 60 % 1 RM, tempo: 4, 1, 1, 1) with 2 minutes rest between sets, and post-test measurements (POST- 0), along with measurements at: [3] POST- 24, [4] POST- 48, and [5] POST- 72. Test measurements included: <b>thigh</b> <b>girth,</b> muscle soreness, range of motion (ROM), evoked and voluntary contractile properties, vertical jump, along with perceived pain (FR-pain) and reaction forces (FR-force) while foam rolling. [...] Results: <b>Thigh</b> <b>girth</b> showed no substantial between group differences at all time points. FR substantially reduced muscle soreness at all time points while substantially improving ROM. FR negatively affected evoked contractile properties (twitch force, rate of force development, and potentiated twitch force) with the exception of half-relaxation time (½RT) and electromechanical delay (EMD). ½RT showed no substantial between group differences at all time points, while FR substantially improved EMD. Voluntary contractile properties showed no substantial between group differences for all measurements besides voluntary muscle activation, with FR substantially improving muscle activation at all time points. FR improved functional movement, with substantial between group differences in vertical jump height. When performing the five FR exercises at the three time points (POST- 0, POST- 24, POST- 48), subjects FR-force ranged between 26 - 46 kg (32 - 55 % of subjects' body weight) with FR-pain measurements (based on NRS) ranging between 2. 5 - 7. 5 pts. [...] Conclusion: The most important findings of the present study were that FR was beneficial in attenuating muscle soreness while improving vertical jump height, muscle activation, and passive and dynamic ROM in comparison to CON. FR negatively impacted a number of evoked contractile properties of the muscle, except for ½RT and EMD, indicating that FR benefits are primarily accrued through neural responses and connective tissue...|$|E
