5|$|The {{northern}} attack force moved south towards Østerport {{where the}} fortification Kastellet laid. The Swedes got {{very close to}} Nyboder and {{were in the process}} of crossing the moat, when they fell victim to a well-conducted ambush, and withdrew with heavy losses. Around 6 in the morning, Charles X of Sweden knew that all attacks had failed. He ordered a retreat <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>outskirts</b> <b>of</b> the city, back to the starting position.|$|E
5|$|While {{attending}} school at Trinity College, Cambridge, Daniel becomes Newton's companion, ensuring that Newton does not harm his health and assisting in his experiments. However, {{the plague of}} 1665 forces them apart: Newton returns to his family manor and Daniel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>outskirts</b> <b>of</b> London. Daniel quickly tires of the radical Puritan rhetoric of his father, Drake Waterhouse, and decides to join Reverend John Wilkins and Robert Hooke at John Comstock's Epsom estate.|$|E
5|$|A second market cross, {{known as}} the Butter Cross, which {{was built in the}} 15th century used to stand near the Yarn Market but was moved <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>outskirts</b> <b>of</b> the village in the 18th or 19th centuries. The Yarn Market is in the {{guardianship}} of English Heritage but is managed by the National Trust. In 1951 the Ministry of Works took over various properties including the Yarn Market from the Crown Estate. They carried out restoration works, however this was controversial as the shape of the roof was changed to more closely resemble the appearance of the original building, rather than that produced by subsequent revisions.|$|E
50|$|According to City Counsel records, in 1776, the Spanish {{governor}} of Louisiana, Antonio de Ulloa, tried to banish all lepers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>outskirt</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> colony.

5|$|In Dix, NY414 makes a large reverse S-curve, {{turning to}} the east and {{northeast}} as it follows the Corning Secondary through another creek valley, this one surrounding Shequaga Creek. The creek eventually heads east toward Montour Falls; however, NY414 and the rail line continue northeast <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>outskirts</b> <b>of</b> Watkins Glen, a village located inside of a wide valley holding Seneca Lake. At {{the western edge of the}} gully, the Corning Secondary breaks from NY414 to follow the ridge north through Watkins Glen State Park. The route, meanwhile, descends the side of the valley to enter Watkins Glen, where it merges with NY14 at the foot of the hill.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1864, as Major General Ulysses Grant {{prepared}} to launch his Overland Campaign, he removed fresh troops from the defensive fortifications of Washington and transferred them into the field to strengthen the Army of the Potomac. Capitalizing on this reduction of manpower, Confederate General Robert E. Lee ordered Jubal Early to launch an offensive against the largely undefended capital from the Shenandoah Valley. The attack failed, however the fact that Confederate troops advanced <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>outskirts</b> <b>of</b> Washington D.C. caused widespread panic. This prompted Lincoln to issue a call for 500,000 troops to serve a brief term of 100 days to bolster defenses around the capital.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of June 9, the IAF {{aircraft}} over Lebanon were operating at three levels. Kfirs and Skyhawks were along the coastline from Sidon <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>outskirts</b> <b>of</b> Beirut, providing close air support for the ground troops and striking at Palestine Liberation Organization targets. At the second level, over 10,000 feet (3,000 m), similar formations were circling and awaiting orders. At the top level, Hawkeyes were stationed to ensure air control. The first task force aircraft attacked the Syrian radar {{at the top of}} Jebel Baruk, which was commanding a large area.|$|E

5|$|The French {{soldiers}} {{charged with}} holding the citadel soon became stretched by the guerrilla {{attacks on the}} military installation. De Genouilly had decided to withdraw some of his forces back to central Vietnam. In addition, the inland position of the French forces lessened their technological advantage. As a result, the French decided to evacuate and destroy the fort. This was achieved on March 8. Captain Deroulede used 32 chests of explosives. He also razed the citadel by setting the rice granary ablaze, along with the weapons and munitions. The resulting fire was improbably claimed to have smoldered for a further three years. The French withdrew <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>outskirts</b> <b>of</b> the city, before returning to central Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins in}} medias res with Walker, Adams, and Lugo flying in a {{helicopter}} past the skyscrapers of Dubai, shooting down several pursuing helicopters until a sudden sandstorm forms, causing one of the pursuers to spin {{out of control and}} crash into the trio. The story then jumps back to the start, with Delta traversing the storm wall <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>outskirts</b> <b>of</b> a mostly buried Dubai, being taunted on broadcasts by the Radioman (Jake Busey), a DJ and former journalist speaking for the 33rd. After coming across refugees being rounded up by the 33rd and engaging in a firefight, Walker elects to disobey orders and find Konrad.|$|E
5|$|The market cross was {{probably}} built in 1609 by the Luttrell family {{who were the}} local lords of the manor to maintain {{the importance of the}} village as a market, particularly for wool and cloth. It still bears the damage caused by cannon fire in the Civil War. Nearby was an older cross known as the Butter Cross which has subsequently been moved <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>outskirts</b> <b>of</b> the village. The Yarn Market is an octagonal building constructed around a central pier. The tiled roof provides shelter from the rain.|$|E

5|$|The route then passes under {{a series}} of power lines, loosely {{paralleling}} the more northerly CR96 (Higby Road) <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>outskirts</b> <b>of</b> the village of Frankfort. Here, NY171 intersects with several roads of local importance before crossing over the NY5S freeway to enter the village itself. On {{the eastern side of}} the highway, NY171 becomes South Litchfield Street and passes through areas that are mostly residential. It continues to the village's central business district. State maintenance of the route ends at a junction with Canal Street. but the route continues as a village-maintained highway for one more block to an intersection with Main Street.|$|E
5|$|West of Plattsburgh, NY3 {{exits the}} park and {{encounters}} NY374 via an interchange. Past the exit, the two routes follow parallel routings before separating outside of Plattsburgh. NY3 curves to the southeast toward the former Clinton County Airport, where it meets NY22B just west {{of what was once}} the main entrance to the airport. From NY22B, NY3 continues east <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>outskirts</b> <b>of</b> Plattsburgh, where it meets the Adirondack Northway (I-87). Past I-87, NY3 follows Cornelia Street into the city, where it becomes city-maintained. Within Plattsburgh, NY3 intersects NY22 before terminating at US9 just west of Lake Champlain.|$|E
5|$|When {{the last}} besieged {{garrison}} (aside from Kailahun) was evacuated on 30 May, preparations {{for a military}} extraction—should Jetley's negotiations fail—began to increase. The operation (codenamed Operation Khukri) was eventually launched on 10 July. Two RAF Chinooks transported Indian special forces <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>outskirts</b> <b>of</b> Kailahun. The helicopters returned to Freetown with Harrison, his fellow UNMOs, and several Gurkhas who had been wounded during the siege. Harrison was safely extracted and the 600 Gurkhas successfully fought {{their way out of}} Kailahun, suffering one casualty in the process.|$|E

5|$|As {{ruler of}} Thessalonica, Theodore quickly {{declared}} himself emperor, challenging the Nicaean emperor John III Vatatzes's {{claims to the}} Byzantine imperial throne. In 1225, he advanced <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>outskirts</b> <b>of</b> Constantinople, but his final attack against {{the seat of the}} much-reduced Latin Empire was delayed until 1230. In that year, Theodore amassed an army to besiege Constantinople, but then diverted it against Bulgaria, an ambivalent ally which threatened his northern flank. Theodore was defeated and captured at the Battle of Klokotnitsa, and spent the next seven years in captivity. In the meantime, he was succeeded by his brother Manuel. Manuel quickly lost Thrace, most of Macedonia, and Albania to the Bulgarian Tsar John II Asen. Thessalonica itself became a Bulgarian vassal, while in Epirus proper power was seized by Michael II, returning from exile.|$|E
5|$|At Merriweather, M-64 turns easterly again, {{this time}} merging with M-28 and {{becoming}} {{a part of the}} Lake Superior Circle Tour. The two highways run together along the northern end of Lake Gogebic to Bergland. Turning north once again, M-64 crosses a branch line of the Canadian National Railway. The highway runs through more dense forests parallel to the Big Iron River on this north–south leg. The trunkline leaves the national forest as it passes into the community of White Pine, and the road runs near a former copper mine in the area. M-64 approaches the shores of Lake Superior at Silver City. There, it meets the eastern terminus of the former M-107, a highway designation that ran west into the Porcupine Mountains along the current 107th Engineers Memorial Highway. M-64 turns east along Lake Superior following the shoreline <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>outskirts</b> <b>of</b> Ontonagon. The highway crosses the Ontonagon River and terminates on the eastern shore. The current intersection with US45 that marks the end of M-64 {{on the south side of}} downtown is also the western terminus of M-38.|$|E
5|$|Between {{the bridge}} and exit18, I-87 passes two rest areas, one for each direction. The road's northward course through Queensbury quickly brings it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>outskirts</b> <b>of</b> Glens Falls, and as such the highway heads across another swath of {{residential}} neighborhoods. Exits18 and19 are the main exits for the city, with the latter connecting to NY254 near the commercial center of Queensbury. Just east of the exit is Aviation Mall, located on NY254 {{just west of the}} route's junction with US9. A northwestern turn in the freeway takes I-87 past the Great Escape amusement park and lodge, both of which are accessed from exit20 and NY149. Past exit20, I-87 runs across increasingly remote areas of Queensbury as the road enters Adirondack Park and heads toward Lake George. The freeway closely follows US9 northwest to the village of Lake George, where I-87 meets NY9N via exits21 and22.|$|E

5|$|Continuing into Onondaga County and {{the village}} of Jordan, NY31 begins to make a turn northward while {{connecting}} to {{the northern end of}} NY317 (the former northern terminus of NY31C) a short distance north of the village center. With the turn complete, NY31 traverses the CSX mainline and the Thruway via successive overpasses before returning to level ground and resuming an eastward alignment {{in the shadow of the}} Thruway. Once inside the limits of Van Buren, NY31 separates from the Thruway, curving north and intersecting the western terminus of NY173 in quick succession. The alignment remains fairly straight <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>outskirts</b> <b>of</b> Baldwinsville, where NY31 turns to the right onto Downer Street to avoid the Seneca River to the immediate north. The eastward progression is limited, however, as NY31 merges with NY690 northward, traversing the Seneca River and straddling the western edge of Baldwinsville.|$|E
5|$|Continuing southward, NY93 runs across open, rolling terrain, meeting CR259 (Tonawanda Creek Road) {{on its way}} to {{the hamlet}} of Swifts Mills. Here, the rural {{surroundings}} briefly give way to residential areas as NY93 intersects with CR255 (Swift Mills Road) in the center of the community. South of Swifts Mills, the road serves only intermittent stretches of homes for , including a cluster of residences around its closely spaced intersections with CR253 (Carney Road) and CR42 (Rapids Road). It continues on a southward track past the eastern terminus of CR218 (Hunts CornerAkron Road) <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>outskirts</b> <b>of</b> the village of Akron, where the highway turns east onto Lewis Road and soon enters the village limits. NY93 runs past a line of homes before intersecting Cedar Street, a road maintained by Erie County as CR261 north of the village.|$|E
5|$|Following this, the 31st Army drove {{towards the}} Baltic coast. The 331st {{captured}} the rail junction of Landsberg from the march, and Berestov ordered the division northward, unaware {{that it was}} coming {{into the path of}} a powerful German counterstrike to hold open a land link to the rest of Germany. Under pressure, the 331st fell back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>outskirts</b> <b>of</b> Landsberg, and savage fighting ensued. Meanwhile, the German columns led by Waffen SS troops bypassed the town to the south and north, leaving the fighting elements of the division encircled for two days until they were relieved from outside. Meanwhile, the southern German column had rampaged through the mostly-defenseless rear elements of the division, destroying the medical-sanitation battalion, the motor pool, and other units; in total more than 300 men and women were killed and more wounded.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} half of the 20th century, a large portion of the birch forest was cut and the freed land was replanted with pine trees. A century-old birch forest once reached <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northeastern <b>outskirts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> village but was {{destroyed}} one-and-a-half to two centuries ago by an extensive wildfire.

It was also the last major obstacle before the Syrian border, as well as Syria's capital Damascus itself. <b>The</b> Israelis managed <b>to</b> reach <b>the</b> mountain pass {{near the village of}} Dahr el-Baidar, which was the last obstacle before Cthaura. The Syrians fought fiercely <b>to</b> hold <b>the</b> pass, and the Israeli advance halted, with the Israelis holding their ground and harassing the Syrians with artillery fire. By June 25, with the remaining Syrian positions on and north of the highway no longer tenable, the Syrians withdrew. The Israelis allowed <b>the</b> withdrawal <b>to</b> occur but conducted artillery harassment and continued <b>to</b> shell <b>the</b> <b>outskirts</b> <b>of</b> Chtaura. <b>The</b> Syrians attempted <b>to</b> deploy a SAM battery in the Bekaa Valley at midnight, but Israeli intelligence detected this, and the battery was destroyed in an Israeli air attack.
