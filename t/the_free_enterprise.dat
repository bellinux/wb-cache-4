25|$|The anti-literacy laws after 1832 contributed {{greatly to}} the problem of {{widespread}} illiteracy facing the freedmen and other African Americans after Emancipation and the Civil War 35 years later. The problem of illiteracy and need for education was seen {{as one of the greatest}} challenges confronting these people as they sought to join <b>the</b> <b>free</b> <b>enterprise</b> system and support themselves during Reconstruction and thereafter.|$|E
25|$|In his 1980 {{campaign}} speeches, Reagan {{presented his}} economic proposals as {{a return to}} <b>the</b> <b>free</b> <b>enterprise</b> principles, free market economy {{that had been in}} favor before the Great Depression and FDR's New Deal policies. At the same time, he attracted a following from the supply-side economics movement, which had formed in opposition to Keynesian demand-stimulus economics. This movement produced some of the strongest supporters for Reagan's policies during his term in office.|$|E

25|$|The first {{fundamental}} decision Macapagal {{had to make}} {{was whether}} to continue the system of exchange controls of Quirino, Magsaysay and Garcia or to return to <b>the</b> <b>free</b> <b>enterprise</b> of Quezon, Osmena and Roxas. It had been his view {{since he was a}} Congressman for eight years that the suitable economic system for Filipinos was free enterprise. So on January 21, 1962 after working for 20 straight hours he signed a Central Bank decree abolishing exchange controls and returning the country to free enterprise.|$|E
500|$|In February 2006, author Timothy Sexton {{wrote an}} article titled [...] "Hoodwinked: A Postmodern Examination of the Dangers of Runaway Capitalism" [...] for Associated Content, in which he posited that Hoodwinked! {{was one of the}} first postmodern {{animated}} films and also carried political undertones. He argued that the relative nature of truth was shown by revealing deviations from the original fairy tale as the film explored the story from each of the central characters' points of view. Calling Hoodwinked! [...] "the most subversive movie released nationwide since Fahrenheit 9/11", Sexton went on to interpret the film as a critique on <b>the</b> <b>free</b> <b>enterprise</b> system. He drew comparisons between the film's villain and the typical American business owner, going so far as to say that the character was [...] "clearly based on people like Bill Gates and Sam Walton". In Sexton's view, the film exposed the flaws of capitalism, showing that if left unregulated, business owners will establish monopolies and eliminate competition.|$|E

[...] In another letter to Semonin, Thompson wrote that he agreed with Karl Marx, and compared him to Thomas Jefferson. In a letter to William Kennedy, Thompson confided that he was [...] "coming to view <b>the</b> <b>free</b> <b>enterprise</b> system as the single greatest evil in the history of human savagery." [...] In the documentary Breakfast with Hunter, Hunter S. Thompson is seen in several scenes wearing different Che Guevara T-shirts. Additionally, actor and friend Benicio del Toro has stated that Thompson kept a [...] "big" [...] picture of Che in his kitchen. Thompson wrote on behalf of African-American rights and the Civil Rights Movement. He strongly criticized the dominance in American society of, what he called, [...] "white power structures".|$|E
