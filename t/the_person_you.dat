This led him to wonder, [...] "What if <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>you</b> expect to be the predator is not who you expect it to be? What if it's the other person?" [...] He then hired writer Brian Nelson to flesh out the idea. Due to the controversial nature of the work, the budget was kept under $1 million so that the production company would not ask to change anything.|$|E

500|$|Bushnell {{felt that}} Pong was {{especially}} significant in {{its role as}} a social lubricant, since it was multiplayer-only and did not require each player to use more than one hand: [...] "It was very common to have a girl with a quarter in hand pull a guy off a bar stool and say, 'I'd like to play Pong and there's nobody to play.'

500|$|The Ludys {{argue that}} one's love {{life should be}} both guided by and {{subordinate}} to one's relationship with God.

The Ludys contest the definition of [...] "true love" [...] as an emotion; instead, they define [...] "true love" [...] as the choice to commit to another person no matter what happens. Eric writes that [...] "there are two ways each of us can approach life: spending our days meeting our needs or looking for ways to meet others' needs. The mystery is that when we spend our life focused on our own needs, we are never satisfied... but when we pour out our life and focus on how we can serve others... our deepest needs are met as well!" ...|$|E

But I reached out to him about doing 'Birthday Cake' because that’s the only person that, really, it made sense to do the record.

So I wanted him on the track, and then in turn he was like, ‘Why don’t you do the remix to my track?’ and it was a trade-off. We did two records. One for my fans, one for his fans, and that way our fans can come together. There shouldn’t be a divide. You know? It’s music, and it’s innocent." [...] In March 2012, American rapper Fabolous released his own verse to the [...] "Birthday Cake" [...] remix. The following month, Rick Ross also released the track featuring an added rap verse from himself, along with the previously incorporated Chris Brown verses.

500|$|The cast of Blue Velvet {{included}} several then-relatively unknown actors. Isabella Rossellini had gained some exposure before the film for her Lancôme {{ads in the}} early 1980s and for being the daughter of actress Ingrid Bergman and Italian film director Roberto Rossellini. After completion of the film, during test screenings, ICM Partners—the agency representing Rossellini—immediately dropped her as a client.

Dennis Hopper was the biggest [...] "name" [...] in the film, having starred in Easy Rider (1969), while Kyle MacLachlan had played the central role in Lynch's critical and commercial failure Dune (1984), a science fiction epic based on the novel of the same name. MacLachlan later became a recurring collaborator with Lynch, who remarked: [...] "Kyle plays innocents who are interested in the mysteries of life. He's <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>you</b> trust enough to go into a strange world with." [...] Dennis Hopper—said to be Lynch's third choice—accepted the role, reportedly having exclaimed, [...] "I've got to play Frank! I am Frank!" [...] as Hopper confirmed in the Blue Velvet [...] "making-of" [...] documentary The Mysteries of Love, produced for the 2002 special edition. For the role of Dorothy Vallens, Lynch met Isabella Rossellini at a restaurant, and she accepted the role. Laura Dern, then just 19 years old, was cast after various successful actresses at the time turned it down, including Molly Ringwald.|$|E

2500|$|Cushing is {{well known}} for playing Baron Victor Frankenstein and Professor Van Helsing in a long series of horror films {{produced}} by Hammer Film Productions in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. He was often cast alongside Christopher Lee, who became his best friend. His first appearances in his two most famous roles were in Terence Fisher's films The Curse of Frankenstein (1957) and Dracula (1958). He later said that his career decisions entailed selecting roles where he knew that he would be accepted by the audience. [...] "Who wants to see me as Hamlet? Very few. But millions want to see me as Frankenstein, so that's the one I do." [...] The film critic Roger Ebert described Cushing's work in the Hammer films thusly: [...] " [...] the one in all those British horror films, standing between Vincent Price and Christopher Lee. His dialog usually runs along the lines of, 'But good heavens, man! <b>The</b> <b>person</b> <b>you</b> saw has been dead for more than two centuries!'" ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{one popular}} {{interpretation}} of stage theory, {{each of the}} so-called levels of existence envelops those below it: an ethical person is still capable of aesthetic enjoyment, for example, and a religious person is still capable of aesthetic enjoyment and ethical duty. The difference between these ways of living are internal, not external, and thus there are no external signs one can point to determine at what level a person is living. This inner and outer relationship is commonly determined by an individual by looking to others to gauge one's action, Kierkegaard believed one should look to oneself and in that relationship look to Christ as the example instead of looking at others because the more you look at others the less you see of yourself. This {{makes it easier to}} degrade your neighbor instead of loving your neighbor. But one must love the person one sees not the person one wishes to see.

2500|$|Mollie King {{spoke about}} the album's sound saying {{that she had been}} joining playing on the studio [...] "messing around" [...] with a certain track. [...] "30 Days" [...] is about being a part from <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>you</b> love and {{counting}} down the minutes until you're back together. [...] "The song really struck a chord with us - it's a situation all of us can relate to, and we think a lot of fans will relate to it as well." [...] Rochelle Humes explained the concept of the single, [...] "It’s a really amazing, catchy song but the sentiment behind it is being all excited and counting down the days to seeing someone when you’ve really been missing that person." [...] The band revealed that they wanted to create an album which was [...] "amazing", [...] "crazy" [...] and [...] "very pop". King said [...] "What About Us" [...] features [...] reggae pop music influence, a little different from what band usually record, but the track is still really [...] "dancey" [...] and [...] "upbeat", as well a good song to dance to on either stage or at a club. When Una Healy was asked what the song was about she said that she [...] "did not know" [...] what the song was exactly about. [...] "To be honest I {{was trying to figure out}} the other day what exactly it's about. I could bullshit away telling you, but I really don't know.

Rochelle Humes said that the band had recorded a new track, which features a more [...] "edgy" [...] vibe than their previous material. She also said that the track would be released at the end of Summer, which was revealed to be [...] "Gentleman". She also said [...] "It's very dancey", and that they hoped to experiment with other types of music genres on the album, she said: [...] "It's going to be a lot more edgy than our previous stuff and what we are known for. I think we are definitely a pop band so we will carry on doing what we do best." [...] She said that her most favourite thing about being a singer is that she can try out different styles of genres. The band warned fans that the new album would have a [...] "fresh sound". Although, the said they weren't changing the sound too much.
