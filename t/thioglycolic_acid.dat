40|$|Linear {{oligomeric}} silsesquioxanes with polar side moieties (e. g., carboxylic {{groups and}} derivatives of N -acetylcysteine, cysteine hydrochloride or glutathione) can form specific, self-assembled nanostructures when deposited on mica by dip coating. The mechanism of adsorption {{is based on}} molecule-to-substrate interactions between carboxylic groups and mica. Intermolecular cross-linking by hydrogen bonds was also observed due to the donor–acceptor character of the functional groups. The texture of supramolecular nanostructures formed by the studied materials on mica was analysed with atomic force microscopy and their specific surface energy was estimated by contact angle measurements. Significant differences in the surface roughness, thickness and the arrangement of macromolecules were noted depending {{on the kind of}} functional groups on the side chains. Specific changes in the morphology of the surface layer were observed when mica was primed with a monolayer of small organic compounds (e. g., N -acetylcysteine, citric <b>acid,</b> <b>thioglycolic</b> or <b>acid).</b> The adsorption of both silsesquioxane oligomers and organic primers was confirmed with attenuated total reflectance infrared spectroscopy.

40|$|This {{study is}} devoted to {{development}} of the optimal conditions for synthesis {{and the study of}} some “structure – antioxidant activity” regularities of [(1 -arylimidazole- 5 -yl) methylthio]alkane carboxylic ac¬ids, which structural analogues have found an application as medicinal products {{with a wide range of}} biological activities. The methodology of interaction between 4 -cloro- 5 -chloromethylimidazoles with <b>thioglycolic</b> and thiopropionic <b>acids</b> has been used to obtain these compounds. Selection of the op¬timal reaction conditions has allowed to obtain target compounds in a dry dimethylformamide in the presence of potash at 50 оC with yields of 75 - 82 %. The compounds synthesized are high-melting crystalline substances that dissolve well in polar organic solvents and aqueous alkaline solutions. Their composition and structure have been confirmed by the results of elemental analysis and mea¬surement data of IR-, 1 H NMR- and chromatography mass-spectra. The study of the compounds synthesized has been conducted in vitro on biological samples. The antioxidant activity has been determined by the inhibition value of the ascorbate-dependent endogenous lipid peroxidation rate in rats’ liver found by the concentration of one of the final products of free-radical lipid oxidation processes – malonaldehyde in the test sample. The results of the biological activity screening of the compounds synthesized show that all imidazole derivatives studied in the final concentration ranges of 10 - 3 - 10 - 1 M exhibit a high antioxidant action in the system in vitro. It has been found that the value of the antioxi¬dant activity is influenced by the nature and position of the substituent in position 1 of imidazole. In particular, the presence of electron-acceptor substituents in the aryl fragment decreases the molecule activity in comparison with electron-donor substituents, wherein increase of the methylene groups quan¬tity in the carboxyalkylthiol fragment does not significantly impact the antioxidant effect of the compounds synthesized.

50|$|Caffeic acid is {{susceptible}} to autoxidation. Glutathione and thiol compounds (cysteine, <b>thioglycolic</b> <b>acid</b> or thiocresol) or ascorbic acid have a protective effect on browning and disappearance of caffeic acid.

Chemical oxidation of caffeic acid in acidic conditions using sodium periodate leads to the formation of dimers with a furan structure (isomers of 2,5-(3′,4′-dihydroxyphenyl)tetrahydrofuran 3,4-dicarboxylic acid). Caffeic acid can also be polymerized using the horseradish peroxidase/H2O2 oxidizing system.|$|E

50|$|Work that Goddard {{participated in}} at, what was then, the Rockefeller Institute, {{inspired}} by Leonor Michaelis, {{in the early}} 1930s, led indirectly {{to the discovery of}} simple methods of permanently modifying the shape of hair by reducing the disulfide bonds in keratin (hair protein). The basic chemistry of this discovery was adapted into the technology known in the hairdressing industry as a cold wave, using chemical derivatives of the reagent, <b>thioglycolic</b> <b>acid,</b> that he identified as suitable for this purpose. Goddard was only interested in the, considerable, scientific implications of this discovery, and refused any suggestion of attempting to patent the process.|$|E
5000|$|A {{solution}} containing ammonium thioglycolate contains {{a lot of}} free ammonia, which swells hair, rendering it permeable. The <b>thioglycolic</b> <b>acid</b> in the perm solution reduces the disulfide cystine bonds in the cortex of the hair. [...] In a sense, the thioglycolate removes crosslinks. After washing, the hair is treated with a mild solution of hydrogen peroxide, which oxidizes the cysteines back to cystine. These new chemical bonds impart the structural rigidity necessary for a successful perm. The rigidification process is akin to the vulcanization of rubber, where commonly polysulfide linkages are used to crosslink the polymer chains. However, not as many disulfide bonds are reformed as there were before the permanent. As a result, the hair is weaker than before the permanent was applied and repeated applications over the same spot may eventually cause strand breakage.|$|E
50|$|The {{condensed}} tannins can nevertheless undergo acid-catalyzed cleavage in {{the presence}} of (an excess of) a nucleophile like phloroglucinol (reaction called phloroglucinolysis), benzyl mercaptan (reaction called thiolysis), <b>thioglycolic</b> <b>acid</b> (reaction called thioglycolysis) or cysteamine. These techniques are generally called depolymerisation and give informations such as average degree of polymerisation or percentage of galloylation. These are SN1 reactions, a type of substitution reaction in organic chemistry, involving a carbocation intermediate under strongly acidic conditions in polar protic solvents like methanol. The reaction leads to the formation of free and derived monomers that can be further analyzed. The free monomers correspond to the terminal units of the condensed tannins chains. If thiolysis is done directly on plant material (rather than on purified tannins), it is, however, important to subtract naturally occurring free flavanol monomers from the concentration of terminal units that are released during depolymerisation.|$|E
