She causes them to be reborn as humans, who eventually meet and start living together. Sakura gives birth to the original Syaoran and they realize <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> own past. They raise him until {{it is time for}} him to begin the events of the series, then they seal themselves in a glass tube in order to await the time when Fei-Wang will attempt to shatter reality. After breaking free from the tube, Sakura and Syaoran reverse Fei-Wang's damage to the dimension using the magic they inherited from the sorcerer Clow Reed during their reincarnation. They disappear after Fei-Wang is killed by Kurogane, leaving behind only a feather which the original Sakura and Syaoran absorb.|$|E
5|$|The eggs hatch after 53 to 60days of {{incubation}} by both parents. Chicks {{are born}} with their eyes open and sometimes {{can take up to}} a week to leave the shell completely. The young are covered with a grayish down until they are almost as large as their parents. They are able to fly after five to six months, but continue to roost and forage with their parents until <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> second year, at which point the parents typically turn their energies to a new nest. Ravens are the main predatory threat to condor eggs, while golden eagles and bears are potential predators of condor offspring.|$|E

25|$|Tolkien {{does not}} {{elaborate}} on Orc culture and customs. Orcs know {{some form of}} healing arts (as the Orc-band apply harsh but effective Orkish medicine to Pippin's and Merry's injuries while <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> captivity). Also their armour, though inferior to that of Elves and Dwarves, is serviceable. Orcs often use poisoned blades (as Aragorn observes while inspecting a wound received by Sam) and arrows (as they use on Isildur). They like to sing horrible songs (as in The Hobbit). The Goblins of the Misty Mountains were a smaller breed of Orc, and invented horrid machines used to torture and kill things. In some texts, Tolkien suggests that {{after the fall of}} Morgoth, some of his Orcs set up petty kingdoms of their own.|$|E
25|$|The {{plants are}} as highly adapted in their methods of {{surviving}} seasonally inclement conditions as <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> structure and feeding habits. Temperate perennials can require a winter {{period in which}} they die back each year, and they will weaken in cultivation {{if they are not}} given it; tropical and warm-temperate species, on the other hand, require no dormancy. Floating bladderworts in cold temperate zones such as the UK and Siberia can produce winter buds called turions at the extremities of their stems: as the autumnal light fails and growth slows down, the main plant may rot away or be killed by freezing conditions, but the turions will separate and sink {{to the bottom of the}} pond to rest beneath the coming ice until the spring, when they will return to the surface and resume growth. Many Australian species will grow only during the wet season, reducing themselves to tubers only 10mm long to wait out the dry season. Other species are annual, returning from seed each year.|$|E

500|$|Other {{reviews of}} the book's {{illustrations}} were positive. Beier writes highly of the illustrations and states that Dyer's paintings of the dogs' faces are priceless, particularly in the scenes where {{they are looking at}} each other through the fence and those where <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> owners' arms. Similarly, the Kirkus reviewer calls the illustrations charming and writes that they [...] "have all the clever details that are Dyer's signature touch", noting specifically the lavender frames of Miss Violet's eyeglasses and the inclusion of the dogs' names on their collars. Fletcher suggests that, apart from the [...] "ominous grays and greens" [...] in the illustrations of the forest scenes with the bear, the pastel-colored illustrations in the book are evocative of 1940s picture postcards, which she considers [...] "just right for such jolly capers".|$|E
500|$|According to the series' {{director}} Gorō Taniguchi, {{the idea}} for s-CRY-ed originated in 1999 {{when he was working}} on the series Infinite Ryvius. One of Infinite Ryviuss themes was people communicating with each other. The series' staff wanted to show people already on their own paths, focusing more on individualism. With the storyline beginning in the early 21st century, Taniguchi said the cast would already have adapted to the new times allowing s-CRY-ed to take more themes from Infinite Ryvius. The title s-CRY-ed is basically a combination of one English word and Japanese. The first lower-case [...] "s" [...] is a representation of the Japanese word su which means something in its natural form and not artificial. [...] "Cry" [...] comes from the English, and the last [...] "ed" [...] represents a person. Combined as [...] "s-CRY-ed" [...] the Sunrise studio staff wanted it to express the idea of how people react or interact when <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> most natural state. They had devised the word when the project was in its early phases of production, and while {{it was meant to be}} a temporary name, the staff ended up using it as the title.|$|E

But that's exactly what transpired on 'Silly Love Songs', as the show stopped feeling like a Public Service Announcement for a week and actually focused on well-paced, well-written relationship developments among its core characters." [...] Joel Keller of TV Squad gave the episode a positive review, and wrote, Silly Love Songs' strikes an interesting contrast to Sunday night's post-Super Bowl episode in that tonight was more about the kids and where <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> stories than about big production numbers and Sue's cartoon evilness. It was also the funniest episode of the season, in no small part because we got some insight into the lives of two New Directions members we rarely get to hang out with for any length of time: Santana and Lauren." [...] James Poniewozik of Time Magazine praised the storyline and the musical performances of the episode. However, Soraya Roberts of the Daily News gave the episode a negative review: [...] "This show sometimes sounds like it was written by a PIT, prime idiot TV writer. It's almost as bad as Tina breaking down into tears for no reason while singing 'My Funny Valentine' to Mike and Blaine attempting to channel Frank Sinatra while singing Paul McCartney's 'Silly Love Songs' in the middle of Breadsticks."

40|$|In May 2001 the Australian Broadcasting Authority {{released}} the authors 2 ̆ 7 report titled Sources of News and Current Affairs (ABA, 2001). The monograph consisted of {{reports from the}} Stage I study of journalists 2 ̆ 7 views (Pearson 2 ̆ 6 Brand, 2001) and the Stage 2 study of audiences 2 ̆ 7 views (Brand, Archhold 2 ̆ 6 Rane, 2001). These were independent publications {{focusing on the individual}} results from each stage of the larger study. Little comparison was made between the journalists 2 ̆ 7 and audiences 2 ̆ 7 views in the two reports. This paper provides a comparison and contrast of the views of news and current affairs producers and their audiences. The comparative analysis covers a range of topics including characteristics and attitudes; news and current affairs media credibility; news quality (particularly issues of sensationalism, inrusiveness, bias, and inaccuracy); influences upon news and current affairs; adequacy of local coverage; and attitudes to contemporary social issues. The authors found that journalists and their audiences <b>are</b> different, demographically; <b>they</b> <b>are</b> different <b>in</b> <b>their</b> views on the credibility of the news product; <b>they</b> <b>are</b> different <b>in</b> <b>their</b> perceptions of the quality of news; <b>they</b> <b>are</b> different <b>in</b> <b>their</b> assessment of sources of influence on the news product; <b>they</b> <b>are</b> different <b>in</b> <b>their</b> views of the adequacy of local coverage; and <b>they</b> <b>are</b> different <b>in</b> <b>their</b> attitudes to contemporary issues...|$|R

2500|$|The {{homeless}} shelters {{across the country}} act merely as emergency shelter systems that can only hold {{a fraction of the}} rapidly increasing homeless population. The Housing First practice provides an alternative to the current network of {{homeless shelters}}. The program targets the large problem within the United States which is a lack of affordable housing. [...] This methodology attempts to place homeless families back into independent living situations as quickly as possible. The Housing First practice has achieved success from the fact that homeless families are more responsive to social services support once when <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> own housing. It provides crisis intervention, affordable rental housing, and gives each family a grace period of {{six months to a year}} of social service to allow the family to get back on their feet. [...] The effectiveness of this concept is that it assists homeless families in identifying their needs and recognizing the choices they must make. From this point families can create better options for them and plan strategies for living on their own.|$|E
2500|$|The {{nature in}} which the tail groups {{organize}} themselves into a straight ordered monolayer {{is dependent on the}} inter-molecular attraction, or van der Waals forces, between the tail groups. To minimize the free energy of the organic layer the molecules adopt conformations that allow high degree of Van der Waals forces with some hydrogen bonding. The small size of the SAM molecules are important here because Van der Waals forces arise from the dipoles of molecules and are thus much weaker than the surrounding surface forces at larger scales. The assembly process begins {{with a small group of}} molecules, usually two, getting close enough that the Van der Waals forces overcome the surrounding force. The forces between the molecules orient them so <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> straight, optimal, configuration. Then as other molecules come close by they interact with these already organized molecules in the same fashion and become a part of the conformed group. When this occurs across a large area the molecules support each other into forming their SAM shape seen in Figure 1. The orientation of the molecules can be described with two parameters: α and β. α is the angle of tilt of the backbone from the surface normal. In typical applications α varies from 0 to 60 degrees depending on the substrate and type of SAM molecule. β is the angle of rotation along the long axis of tee molecule. β is usually between 30 and 40 degrees. In some cases existence of kinetic traps hindering the final ordered orientation has been pointed out. Thus in case of dithiols formation of a [...] "lying down" [...] phase was considered an impediment to formation of [...] "standing up" [...] phase, however various recent studies indicate this is not the case.|$|E
