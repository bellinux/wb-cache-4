5|$|A {{central part}} of Klamath mythology, the {{mountain}} offers activities such as hiking and horseback riding.

5|$|A {{few miles}} {{southwest}} {{from the head}} of Anderson Lake is Mount Birkenhead, {{on the north side of}} the low pass connecting the valley of those lakes to that of the Birkenhead River.

5|$|As {{animals at}} <b>the</b> <b>summit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> food chain, bears {{do not have}} many predators.

5|$|Hugh Ross Williamson cites a {{tale about}} St. Collen, {{one of the}} {{earliest}} hermits to inhabit the Tor before the Abbey was built by St. Patrick, which has the Saint summoned by the King of the Fairies, Gwyn, to <b>the</b> <b>summit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tor. Upon arrival there he beholds a hovering mansion inhabited by handsomely dressed courtiers and King Gwyn on a throne of gold; holy water disperses the apparition. This is from Druid mythology, in which the mansion is made of glass so as to receive the spirits of the dead, which were supposed to depart from <b>the</b> <b>summit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tor. This was the chief reason why the chapel, and later the church, of St. Michael were built on the high hill; St. Michael being the chief patron against diabolic attacks which the monks believed the Fairy King to be numbered among. Accordingly, Williamson posits that the Tor was named after the glassy mansion of the dead.|$|E

Double points were awarded on the summit finishes on stages 9, 12, 17 and 19. The leader wore a white jersey with red polka dots.|$|E

5|$|Approximately 57 {{people were}} killed directly, {{including}} innkeeper Harry R. Truman, photographers Reid Blackburn and Robert Landsburg, and geologist David A. Johnston. Hundreds of square miles were reduced to wasteland, causing over a billion U.S. dollars in damage ($3.03 billion in 2017 dollars), thousands of animals were killed, and Mount St. Helens was left with a crater on its north side. At {{the time of the}} eruption, <b>the</b> <b>summit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> volcano was owned by the Burlington Northern Railroad, but afterward the land passed to the United States Forest Service. The area was later preserved, as it was, in the Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument.|$|E
5|$|Beginning November 1984, geologists {{observed}} {{an increasing}} level of seismic activity near Nevado del Ruiz. Other {{signs of a}} forthcoming eruption included increased fumarole activity, deposition of sulfur on <b>the</b> <b>summit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> volcano, and small phreatic eruptions. In the latter, hot magma {{came in contact with}} water, resulting in explosions as the water was almost instantly turned into steam. The most notable of these events was an ash ejection on September 11, 1985. The activity of the volcano decreased in October 1985. The most likely explanation of the events is that new magma rose into the volcanic edifice before September 1985.|$|E
5|$|During the Postclassic period, {{the most}} common form of human {{sacrifice}} was heart extraction, influenced by the method used by the Aztecs in the Valley of Mexico; this usually took place in the courtyard of a temple, or upon <b>the</b> <b>summit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pyramid. Depending upon the exact ritual, sometimes the corpse would be skinned by assistant priests, except for the hands and feet. The officiating priest would then remove his ritual attire and dress himself in the skin of the sacrificial victim before performing a ritual dance that symbolized the rebirth of life. Archaeological investigations indicate that heart sacrifice was practised as early as the Classic period.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{emplacement}} of late Pliocene lava domes, lesser activity {{continued into}} the Quaternary period (2.58 million years ago to present). Initial volcanism began on <b>the</b> <b>summit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> volcano, depositing lava in and adjacent to the Level Mountain Range. This activity is indirectly dated as Pleistocene age , on the bases {{of the presence of}} subglacial and/or intraglacial deposits. Meszah Peak, the highest point of both Level Mountain and the Level Mountain Range, was volcanically active during this eruptive period.|$|E
5|$|Geologically <b>the</b> <b>summit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fell forms {{part of the}} Deepdale Formation, (principally volcaniclastic sandstone) {{underlain}} by the dacitic lapilli-tuff of the Helvellyn Formation. The geology {{of much of the}} Lake District is the Borrowdale Volcanic Group, {{of which}} Nethermost Pike is part, and is late Ordovician in age. The eastern cliffs of the range, including those of Nethermost Pike, are rich in base minerals. When these rocks weather they form areas of fertile soil, which together with the area's inaccessibility and climate provide suitable conditions for plants of biological importance.|$|E
