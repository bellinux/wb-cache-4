5|$|On February 15, NASA {{scientists}} identified <b>the</b> <b>crater</b> {{formed by}} Deep Impact in images from Stardust. <b>The</b> <b>crater</b> {{is estimated to}} be 150 meters (500ft) in diameter, and has a bright mound in the center likely created when material from the impact fell back into <b>the</b> <b>crater.</b>|$|E
5|$|Since 2004, new glaciers {{have formed}} on <b>the</b> <b>crater</b> wall above Crater Glacier feeding rock and ice to Crater Glacier below. In addition, {{there are two}} rock glaciers {{to the north of}} the eastern lobe of Crater Glacier and one north of the western lobe. Two of these rock glaciers have merged with <b>the</b> <b>Crater</b> Glacier, with one on the west and one on the east. The other rock glacier on the eastern slopes of <b>the</b> <b>crater</b> wall is very close to {{touching}} the glacier.|$|E

5|$|Ida's major craters {{are named}} after caves and lava tubes on Earth. <b>The</b> <b>crater</b> Azzurra, for example, {{is named after}} a {{submerged}} cave {{on the island of}} Capri, also known as the Blue Grotto. Azzurra seems to be the most recent major impact on Ida. The ejecta from this collision is distributed discontinuously over Ida and is responsible for the large-scale color and albedo variations across its surface. An exception to <b>the</b> <b>crater</b> morphology is the fresh, asymmetric Fingal, which has a sharp boundary between the floor and wall on one side. Another significant crater is Afon, which marks Ida's prime meridian.|$|E
5|$|Shackleton is {{an impact}} crater that {{lies at the}} south pole of the Moon. The peaks along the crater's rim are exposed to almost continual sunlight, while the {{interior}} is perpetually in shadow (a Crater of eternal darkness). The low-temperature interior of this crater functions as a cold trap that may capture and freeze volatiles shed during comet impacts on the Moon. Measurements by the Lunar Prospector spacecraft showed higher than normal amounts of hydrogen within <b>the</b> <b>crater,</b> which may indicate the presence of water ice. <b>The</b> <b>crater</b> is named after Antarctic explorer Ernest Shackleton.|$|E
5|$|Sid {{finds the}} eighth spirit at <b>the</b> <b>crater</b> {{site of the}} alien asteroid's impact on Earth. He lowers a {{shielded}} vehicle, with Aki and Gray aboard, into <b>the</b> <b>crater</b> to locate the final spirit. Just before they can reach it, Hein fires the Zeus cannon into <b>the</b> <b>crater,</b> not only destroying the eighth spirit but also revealing the Phantom Gaia. Aki has {{a vision of the}} Phantom home planet, where she is able to receive the eighth spirit from the alien particles in herself. When Aki awakens, she and Gray combine it with the other seven. Hein continues to fire the Zeus cannon despite overheating warnings and unintentionally destroys the cannon and himself. Gray sacrifices himself as a medium needed to physically transmit the completed spirit into the alien Gaia. The Earth's Gaia is returned to normal as the Phantoms ascend into space, finally at peace. Aki is pulled from <b>the</b> <b>crater</b> holding Gray's body, and is seen looking into the newly liberated world.|$|E
50|$|The sand {{was turned}} into black glass near <b>the</b> <b>craters,</b> and pellets of the glass are {{scattered}} all over the area, decreasing in size with distance from <b>the</b> <b>craters</b> due to wind-sorting. The glass is about 90% local sand and 10% meteoritic iron and nickel.|$|R
50|$|A {{northwest}} wall {{of one of}} <b>the</b> <b>craters</b> {{collapsed and}} generated several pyroclastic flows. <b>The</b> collapsed <b>crater</b> wall was shaped as a V, about 60 meters deep and 100 meters wide. In this V-shaped <b>crater</b> <b>the</b> lava started to flow again.|$|R
50|$|Further {{southeast}} are <b>the</b> <b>craters</b> Mallet and Reimarus, {{the later}} {{located near the}} difficult-to-discern terminus. <b>The</b> satellite <b>crater</b> Mallet D, next to Mallet, also overlays part of the valley.|$|R
5|$|The Aristarchus {{region was}} part of a Hubble Space Telescope study in 2005 that was {{investigating}} the presence of oxygen-rich glassy soils {{in the form of the}} mineral ilmenite. Baseline measurements were made of the Apollo 15 and Apollo 17 landing sites, where the chemistry is known, and these were compared to Aristarchus. The Hubble Advanced Camera for Surveys was used to photograph <b>the</b> <b>crater</b> in visual and ultraviolet light. <b>The</b> <b>crater</b> was determined to have especially rich concentrations of ilmenite, a titanium oxide mineral that could potentially be used in the future by a lunar settlement for extracting oxygen.|$|E
5|$|The {{continuous}} {{shadows in}} the south polar craters cause the floors of these formations to maintain a temperature that never exceeds about 100K. For Shackleton, the average temperature {{was determined to be}} about 90K, reaching 88K at <b>the</b> <b>crater</b> floor. Under these conditions, the estimated rate of loss from any ice in the interior would be 10−26 to 10−27m/s. Any water vapor that arrives here following a cometary impact on the Moon would lie permanently frozen on or below the surface. However, the surface albedo of <b>the</b> <b>crater</b> floor matches the lunar far-side, suggesting that there is no exposed surface ice.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>crater</b> was {{discovered}} by Antonio Camargo and Glen Penfield, geophysicists who {{had been looking for}} petroleum in the Yucatán during the late 1970s. Penfield was initially unable to obtain evidence that the geological feature was a crater and gave up his search. Later, through contact with Alan Hildebrand in 1990, Penfield obtained samples that suggested it was an impact feature. Evidence for the impact origin of <b>the</b> <b>crater</b> includes shocked quartz, a gravity anomaly, and tektites in surrounding areas.|$|E
5|$|The shadowed {{portion of}} <b>the</b> <b>crater</b> was imaged with the Terrain Camera of the Japanese SELENE {{spacecraft}} using the illumination of sunlight reflected off the rim. The interior of <b>the</b> <b>crater</b> {{consists of a}} symmetrical 30° slope that leads down to a 6.6km diameter floor. The handful of craters along the interior span {{no more than a}} few hundred meters. The bottom is covered by an uneven mound-like feature that is 300 to 400m thick. The central peak is about 200m in height.|$|E
5|$|This crater {{has also}} been {{proposed}} as a future site for a large infrared telescope. The low temperature of <b>the</b> <b>crater</b> floor makes it ideal for infrared observations, and solar cells placed along the rim could provide near-continuous power to the observatory. About 120 kilometers from <b>the</b> <b>crater</b> lies the 5-km tall Malapert Mountain, a peak that is perpetually visible from the Earth, and which {{could serve as a}} radio relay station when suitably equipped.|$|E

5|$|Between 1980 and 1986, {{activity}} {{continued at}} Mount St. Helens, {{with a new}} lava dome forming in <b>the</b> <b>crater.</b> Numerous small explosions and dome-building eruptions occurred. From December 7, 1989, to January 6, 1990, and from November 5, 1990, to February 14, 1991, the mountain erupted with sometimes huge clouds of ash.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, a {{scientific}} drilling project drilled {{deep into the}} peak ring of the impact crater, hundreds of meters below the current sea floor, to obtain rock core samples from the impact itself. The discoveries were widely seen as confirming current theories related to both <b>the</b> <b>crater</b> impact and its effects.|$|E

5|$|Most notable was {{the closure}} of the Monitor Ridge trail, which {{previously}} let up to 100 permitted hikers per day climb to the summit. On July 21, 2006, the mountain was again opened to climbers. In February 2010, a climber died after falling from the rim into <b>the</b> <b>crater.</b>|$|E
5|$|On November 15, 2008, a 34-kg probe made a {{hard landing}} near <b>the</b> <b>crater.</b> The moon impact probe (MIP) was {{launched}} from the Indian Chandrayaan-I spacecraft {{and reached the}} surface 25 minutes later. The probe carried a radar altimeter, video imaging system, and a mass spectrometer, which {{will be used to}} search for water.|$|E
5|$|Optical imaging inside <b>the</b> <b>crater</b> {{was done}} {{for the first time}} by the Japanese lunar orbiter {{spacecraft}} Kaguya in 2007. It did not have any evidence of significant amount of water ice, down to the image resolution of 10 m per pixel.|$|E

According to <b>the</b> images, <b>the</b> <b>craters</b> on <b>the</b> west side of Ichi-no-ike were not active during the previous sub-phase, but became active before 13 : 00 on September 27. However, these craters started erupting during this third sub-phase.|$|R
