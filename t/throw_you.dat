"At {{this moment}} I believe neither Captain Bligh of the Bounty, nor Christian, had entered {{any of our}} thoughts, and in waiting the {{approach}} of the strangers, we prepared to ask them some questions in the language of those people we had so recently left.

On September 22, 1939, {{in the second game}} of a double-header against the {{powerful}} American Giants, Paige won a 1–0 game, striking out 10 men in the seven innings before the game was called on account of darkness. Buck O'Neil, who had batted against Paige in 1935 and 1936 and faced him again in a game against the parent Monarchs, recalled a dropoff in speed but an improvement in deception. [...] "He could still throw hard. Not as hard as he had thrown, but you're talkin' about somebody thrown' ninety-eight, a hundred miles an hour. But now he's throwin' maybe ninety—which is still more than the average guy... He was the best and, actually, he was so deceptive! You'd look at that big ol' slow arm movin' and—chooo—that ball's just right by you. And then he'd come up and <b>throw</b> <b>you</b> a change of pace and, oh, man." ...|$|E

She said [...] "They just <b>throw</b> <b>you</b> into a house {{and tell you that}} you have no phone, no internet and you’ll have no contact with the outside world, You can only talk to your family once a week for 10 minutes and that’s monitored. And we weren’t allowed to go to Boots to grab something. We had to be monitored and guided there."

I think you can gauge people’s business skills without putting them in that environment.|$|E

Before this match, Foley and Terry Funk were {{discussing}} the previous year's Hell in a Cell (which took place at Badd Blood in October) that featured the Undertaker backdropping and slamming Shawn Michaels onto the chain-link ceiling of the cage. Foley and Funk were brainstorming {{ideas about how to}} top that match when Funk said, laughing, [...] "Maybe you should let him <b>throw</b> <b>you</b> {{off the top of the}} cage", Foley replied: [...] "Yeah," [...] I shot back, [...] "then I could climb back up – and he could throw me off again." [...] Man, that was a good one, and we were having a good time thinking completely ludicrous things to do inside, outside, and on top of the cage.
