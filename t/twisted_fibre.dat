Braided ropes are preferred by arborists, rock climbers, and in sport sailing {{because they do not}} twist under load, as does an ordinary twisted-strand rope. These ropes consist of one or more concentric tubular braided jackets surrounding either several small <b>twisted</b> <b>fibre</b> cords, or a single untwisted yarn of straight fibres, and are known as Kernmantle ropes.|$|E
50|$|The fibrous husks are {{soaked in}} pits or in nets in a slow-moving {{body of water}} to swell and soften the fibres. The long bristle fibres are {{separated}} from the shorter mattress fibres underneath {{the skin of the}} nut, a process known as wet-milling. The mattress fibres are sifted to remove dirt and other rubbish, dried in the sun and packed into bales. Some mattress fibre is allowed to retain more moisture so it retains its elasticity for <b>twisted</b> <b>fibre</b> production. The coir fibre is elastic enough to twist without breaking and it holds a curl as though permanently waved. Twisting is done by simply making a rope of the hank of fibre and twisting it using a machine or by hand. The longer bristle fibre is washed in clean water and then dried before being tied into bundles or hanks. It may then be cleaned and 'hackled' by steel combs to straighten the fibres and remove any shorter fibre pieces. Coir bristle fibre can also be bleached and dyed to obtain hanks of different colours.|$|E

40|$|Seven new 1, 3, 5 -cyclohexyl-tricarboxamide-phenylalanine {{derivatives}} were synthesized {{in order}} to investigate {{the effect of the}} amino acid chirality on the gelating properties of these small molecules in water. Gelation tests have shown that enantiomerically pure homochiral 1, 3, 5 -cyclohexyl-tricarboxamide-L-phenylalanine is a non-hydrogelator as it crystallizes from water, whereas the heterochiral derivatives with either two L-phenylalanine moieties and one D-phenylalanine (LLD), or vice versa (DDL), are very good hydrogelators. Concentration-dependent gel-to-sol transition-temperature (T-gs) curves for LLD or DDL gels show a siamoidal behaviour, which is in contrast to the logarithmic curves generally observed for gels derived from low molecular weight gelators (LMWGs). Such sigmoidal behaviour can be related to interactions between fibre bundles, which give rise to intertwined bundles of fibres. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of LLD and DDL gels show a network of thin, unbranched, fibre bundles with diameters of 20 nm. Right-handed <b>twisted</b> <b>fibre</b> bundles are present in the LLD gel, whereas left-handed structures can be found in tile DDL gel. Each bundle of fibres consists of a finite number of primary fibres. Gels consisting of mixtures of gelators, LLD and DDL, and nongelators (LLL or DDD) were investigated by means of T-gs measurements, CID spectroscopy and TEM. Results show that the incorporation of nongelator molecules into gel fibres occurs; this leads to higher T-gs values and to changes in the helicity of the fibre bundles. Furthermore, it was found that peripheral functionalization of the homochiral derivatives LLL or DDD by means of a second amino acid or a hydrophilic moiety can overcome the effect of chirality; this process in turn leads to good hydrogelators...|$|E
40|$|Damage {{development}} in transparent woven glass fibre reinforced epoxy laminates manufactured {{from two different}} commercial cloths has been investigated under quasi-static and cyclic loading. Of the two different cloths, one was woven using untwisted fibre bundles, the second cloth was woven using a fibre bundle which was formed by twisting three smaller bundles together. All laminates were fabricated using a wet lay-up process to impregnate two layers of cloth prior to curing. Uniaxial quasi-static tension and tension-tension fatigue tests were carried out on coupons from both sets of laminates. Observations of {{the damage caused by}} the different loading modes were made in two ways, In-situ observations of coupons held within the testing machine allowed the damage to be monitored during testing. Observations of metallographically polished edge- sections containing damage allowed the through-thickness characteristics of the damage to be observed. The major damage morphology observed m both laminates under both types of loading was matrix cracking. The crack morphology observed in laminates reinforced with the cloth woven using untwisted fibre bundles was similar to the cracks observed in cross-ply laminates. This similarity allowed the damage to be quantified by a line density measurement analogous to that used for cross-ply laminates. The damage observed in the laminates reinforced with the cloth woven using <b>twisted</b> <b>fibre</b> bundles was more complicated. This complex damage required quantification by measurements from both the plan view and the edge-section. Shear-lag analysis was used to model the stiffness reduction of the laminates due to cracking damage. Equivalent laminates based on a cross-ply lay-up were derived. The reduced stiffness of the region of the laminate affected by the cracking was calculated using shear-lag and the stiffness of this region was then combined with the stiffness {{of the rest of the}} laminate to give the reduced stiffness of the laminate as a whole. The test data and the model predictions showed good agreement for both laminates...|$|E

[...] <b>Twisting</b> <b>fibres</b> into yarn in the process called spinning can be dated back to the Upper Paleolithic, and yarn spinning was one of the very first processes to be industrialized. Spun yarns may contain a single type of fibre, or be a blend of various types. Combining synthetic fibres (which can have high strength, lustre, and fire retardant qualities) with natural fibres (which have good water absorbency and skin comforting qualities) is very common. The most widely used blends are cotton-polyester and wool-acrylic fibre blends. Blends of different natural fibres are common too, especially with more expensive fibres such as alpaca, angora and cashmere.|$|R

40|$|Despite progress, a {{fundamental}} {{understanding of the}} relationships between the molecular structure and self-assembly configuration of Fmoc-dipeptides is still in its infancy. In this work, we provide a combined experimental and computational approach that makes use of free energy equilibration of a number of related Fmoc-dipeptides to arrive at an atomistic model of Fmoc-threonine-phenylalanine-amide (Fmoc-TF-NH 2) which forms <b>twisted</b> <b>fibres.</b> By using dynamic peptide libraries where closely related dipeptide sequences are dynamically exchanged to eventually favour the formation of the thermodynamically most stable configuration, the relative importance of C-terminus modifications (amide versus methyl ester) and contributions of aliphatic versus aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine F vs. leucine L) is determined (F > L and NH 2 > OMe). The approach enables a comparative interpretation of spectroscopic data, which can then be used to aid the construction of the atomistic model of the most stable structure (Fmoc-TF-NH 2). The comparison of the relative stabilities of the models using molecular dynamic simulations and the correlation with experimental data using dynamic peptide libraries and a range of spectroscopy methods (FTIR, CD, fluorescence) allow for the determination of the nanostructure with atomistic resolution. The final model obtained through this process is able to reproduce the experimentally observed formation of intertwining fibres for Fmoc-TF-NH 2, providing information of the interactions involved in the hierarchical supramolecular self-assembly. The developed methodology and approach should be of general use for the characterization of supramolecular structures...|$|R
40|$|The {{birefringence}} {{properties of}} single-mode optical-fibre waveguides are discussed. A fibre birefringence measurement {{system has been}} developed specifically to measure the birefringence of fibres {{as a function of}} temperature, wavelength, twist and bending. By incorporating a birefringence modulator into the system, the measurement speed and sensitivity is substantially increased, particularly for low birefringences. The fibre spinning technique has been invented to provide a means of manufacturing ultra-low birefringence fibres with extremely high yield. It is shown that spinning averages the intrinsic local birefringence to produce very low overall retardation. A coupled-mode analysis to describe the birefringence properties of spun and <b>twisted</b> <b>fibres</b> is developed and confirmed experimentally. It is now possible to manufacture ultra-low birefringence fibres routinely. The coupled-mode analysis is subsequently extended to treat the effects of bending, twist and magnetic fields on both linearly- and circularly-birefringent fibres. The predictions are subsequently confirmed experimentally and a thorough understanding of extrinsic effects on fibre birefringence has been established. The design criteria of polarisation maintaining fibres are discussed. A novel technique is also described for the measurement of polarisation mode-dispersion, based on the variation of birefringence with wavelength. The dramatic reduction of polarisation-dispersion achieved by spinning is demonstrated, thereby indicating the high suitability of spun fibres to high-bandwidth communications. The separate identification of the stress and waveguide effects contributing to the intrinsic fibre birefringence has been achieved by observing the changes in birefringence as a function of wavelength and temperature...|$|R

40|$|Considering the {{difficulty}} of obtaining reliable experimental results on hybrid composites, a new principle termed 'twist-bonding equivalence' is proposed in this paper. By means of this theory, {{we have used a}} <b>twisted</b> hybrid <b>fibre</b> strand (a yarn) as a prototype for the composites so that the fibre-matrix bonding strength can be closely simulated by adjusting the twist on the strand.

We show an excellent agreement between the spatial distributions as predicted by the Klyshko picture and those obtained using the SPDC photon pairs. An interesting speckle feature is present in the Klyshko predictive images due to the spatial coherence of the back-propagated beam in the multi-mode fibre.

40|$|Abstract. This letter {{deals with}} the {{observed}} development of (false) <b>twist</b> in <b>fibres</b> subjected to a biaxial rotation-fatigue test. A simple theory in terms of forces and moments is presented from which both the torque and the rate (amount) of twist can be correlated with the viscoelastic properties of the fibre. In a recent paper of Calil et a 1 (1980) a theory was presented {{to account for the}} experi-mentally observed development of (false) <b>twist</b> in <b>fibres</b> subjected to a biaxial rotation-fatigue test. This theory is based upon an energy consideration, because, as the authors state: ‘the torque is easily explained by an energy argument, but more difficult in terms of forces and moments’. The theory neither permits the calculation of the angular dependence of the twisting torque nor the rate (amount) of twist. In figure l(a) a simpie method for fatigue testing by rotation of a bent fibre is shown. According to Calil et a 1 (1980) the deformation of the fibre is considered in a frame rotating with the same speed as the fibre; see figure l (b). In this frame the cross-section A remains stationary, but the end B is moved around a circle (without rotation of the cross-section itself) in a direction opposite to the original direction of rotation. There-fore: in this frame the deformation of the fibre can be considered as due to the super-position of two identical periodic pure bending deformations showing a phase difference of;r/ 2 rad. (FrGm these considerations it is dear that the amount of dissipated energy as mentioned by Calil eta 1 (1980) is too small by a factor two.) Alternatively the deformation j bi Figure 9.
