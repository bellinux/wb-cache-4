5|$|In March 1971, the NTSB {{released}} a report summarizing {{the findings of a}} study of midair collisions. The report indicated that 204 of 396 fatalities in U.S. jetliner crashes since 1967 had occurred in mid-air collisions. Additionally, near-miss situations involving jetliners occurred on average at least once per day, with the Los Angeles and New York areas noted as being especially high-risk. Finally, the report noted that <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>trend</b> in air casualties indicated that a further 528 people would die in mid-air collisions during the following ten years. These figures did not include the casualties from Flight 706.|$|E
5|$|Many fans wanted Snake Eater {{to use a}} 3D camera, {{but this}} was {{ultimately}} not implemented in the game. Kojima views Metal Gear Solid, Sons of Liberty and Snake Eater as a trilogy, and wished to keep the camera {{the same as the}} previous two {{in order to keep the}} feel of the three games the same. He did, however, acknowledge that <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>trend</b> for video games is to use the 3D camera. The camera was later implemented in an updated version of Snake Eater titled , and further installments in the franchise.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>current</b> <b>trend</b> of {{enhancing}} {{security at the}} cost of passenger and baggage handling efficiency at international airports is expected to continue in the future. This places financial burden on airports, risks the flow of servicing processes, and has implications for the privacy of passengers. International flights often require a higher level of physical security than do domestic airports, although in recent years, many countries have adopted the same level of security for both.|$|E

5|$|The Panama Canal had {{a limited}} {{capacity}} determined by operational times and cycles {{of the existing}} locks and further constrained by <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>trend</b> towards larger (close to Panamax-sized) vessels transiting the canal which take more transit time within the locks and navigational channels, {{and the need for}} permanent periodical maintenance works due to the aging canal, which forces periodical shutdowns of this waterway. On the other hand, demand has been growing due to the rapid growth of international trade. Also, many users require a guarantee of certain level of service. Despite the gains which have been made in efficiency, the Panama Canal Authority (ACP) estimates that the canal will reach its maximum sustainable capacity between 2009 and 2012. The long-term solution for the congestion problems was the expansion of the canal through a new third set of locks. Work started in 2007 and the expanded canal enter commercial operation in June 2016. The new locks allow transit of larger, Post-Panamax ships, which have a greater cargo capacity than the current locks are capable of handling.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>current</b> <b>trend</b> of {{decreasing}} tilt, by itself, {{will promote}} milder seasons (warmer winters and colder summers), {{as well as}} an overall cooling trend. Because most of the planet's snow and ice lies at high latitude, decreasing tilt may encourage the onset of an ice age for two reasons: There is less overall summer insolation, and also less insolation at higher latitudes, which melts less of the previous winter's snow and ice.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>current</b> <b>trend</b> in the {{classification}} of Cubist styles reflects Apollinaire's wider view of the movement, more so than others. Cubism is once again no longer definitively attached {{to the art of}} a specific group or even a movement. It embraces vastly disparate work; applying to artists in different socio-cultural environments and settings. And despite the difficulties of classification, Cubism, as predicted by Apollinaire in 1913, has been called the first and the most influential of all movements in 20th-century art.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>current</b> <b>trend</b> {{appears to}} be that DNA barcoding needs to be used {{alongside}} traditional taxonomic tools and alternative forms of molecular systematics so that problem cases can be identified and errors detected.
