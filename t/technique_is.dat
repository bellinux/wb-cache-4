5|$|Despite Kabuto {{claiming}} that the <b>technique</b> <b>is</b> flawless, it does have several flaws, including that the reanimated can choose to leave their vessels to willingly drift back to the afterlife. Those who are paralyzed, sealed, or subjected to certain genjutsu, such as Komo Amatsukami: Koto, cannot take further action to free themselves until the <b>technique</b> <b>is</b> canceled. Also, the reanimated can sever their link to the jutsu so they will remain among the living even after the jutsu is canceled, as shown by Madara Uchiha. Furthermore, if such a ninja who lost a body part while alive is brought back to true life with the Rinnegan's Samsara of Heavenly Life Jutsu, the living equivalent of that ninja's body part is absent.|$|E

5|$|As {{with other}} forms of climbing, bouldering <b>technique</b> <b>is</b> largely {{centered}} on proper footwork. Leg muscles are significantly stronger than arm muscles; thus, proficient boulderers use their arms primarily to maintain balance and body positioning, relying on their legs to push them up the boulder. Boulderers also keep their arms straight whenever possible, allowing their bones to support their body weight rather than their muscles.|$|E

30|$|Possible feature {{reduction}} <b>techniques</b> <b>are</b> <b>techniques</b> such as principle components, heuristic {{feature selection}} with wrapper method and feature selection with decision trees. Examples for case reduction <b>techniques</b> <b>are</b> incremental samples, average samples, increasing the sampling period and strategic sampling of key events. For value reduction prominent <b>techniques</b> <b>are</b> rounding, using k-means clustering and discretization using entropy minimization.|$|R
5|$|Electron-beam {{lithography}} (EBL) is {{a method}} of etching semiconductors at resolutions smaller than a micrometer. This <b>technique</b> <b>is</b> limited by high costs, slow performance, the need to operate the beam in the vacuum and the tendency of the electrons to scatter in solids. The last problem limits the resolution to about 10nm. For this reason, EBL is primarily used {{for the production of}} small numbers of specialized integrated circuits.|$|E
5|$|Hunting {{is often}} {{performed}} alone, but L. colubrina may also {{do so in}} large numbers {{in the company of}} hunting parties of giant trevally and goatfish. This cooperative hunting <b>technique</b> <b>is</b> {{similar to that of the}} moray eel, with the banded sea kraits flushing out prey from narrow crevices and holes, and the trevally and goatfish feeding on fleeing prey.|$|E
5|$|Literary scholar M. Keith Booker {{argues that}} Vargas Llosa perfects the {{technique}} of interlacing dialogues in his novel The Green House. By combining two conversations that occur at different times, he creates {{the illusion of a}} flashback. Vargas Llosa also sometimes uses this technique as a means of shifting location by weaving together two concurrent conversations happening in different places. This <b>technique</b> <b>is</b> a staple of his repertoire, which he began using {{near the end of his}} first novel, The Time of the Hero. However, he does not use interlacing dialogues in the same way in all of his novels. For example, in The Green House the <b>technique</b> <b>is</b> used in a serious fashion to achieve a sober tone and to focus on the interrelatedness of important events separated in time or space. In contrast, Captain Pantoja and the Special Service employs this strategy for comic effects and uses simpler spatial shifts. This device is similar to both Virginia Woolf's mixing of different characters' soliloquies and Gustave Flaubert's counterpoint technique in which he blends together conversation with other events, such as speeches.|$|E

40|$|Several <b>techniques</b> <b>are</b> {{presented}} to perform static and dynamic load balancing schemes for integrated vision systems. These <b>techniques</b> <b>are</b> novel {{in the sense}} that they capture the computational requirements of a task by examining the data when they are produced. Furthermore, they can be applied to many integrated vision systems because many algorithms in different systems are either the same or have similar computational characteristics. These <b>techniques</b> <b>are</b> evaluated by applying them to the algorithms in a motion estimation system. It is shown that the performance gains when these <b>techniques</b> <b>are</b> used are significant and the overhead of using these <b>techniques</b> <b>is</b> minimal. The performance is evaluated by implementing the algorithms using the presented techniques on a hypercube multiprocessor system...|$|R

5|$|Molecular {{diagnostics}} is {{a collection}} of techniques used to analyse biological markers in the genome and proteomethe individual's genetic code and how their cells express their genes as proteinsby applying molecular biology to medical testing.

5|$|The analog <b>technique</b> <b>is</b> {{a complex}} {{way of making}} a forecast, {{requiring}} the forecaster to remember a previous weather event {{that is expected to}} be mimicked by an upcoming event. What makes it a difficult technique to use is that there is rarely a perfect analog for an event in the future. Some call this type of forecasting pattern recognition. It remains a useful method of observing rainfall over data voids such as oceans, as well as the forecasting of precipitation amounts and distribution in the future. A similar <b>technique</b> <b>is</b> used in medium range forecasting, which is known as teleconnections, when systems in other locations are used to help pin down the location of another system within the surrounding regime. An example of teleconnections are by using El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) related phenomena.|$|E

Also like phocids, it lacks external ears.|$|E
