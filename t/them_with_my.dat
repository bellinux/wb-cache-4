2500|$|The {{accident}} ended Kahlo's {{dreams of}} becoming a doctor and caused her pain and illness {{for the rest of}} her life; her friend Andrés Henestrosa stated that Kahlo [...] "lived dying". During her recovery, she started to consider a career as a medical illustrator, which would combine her interests in science and art, and began to paint. She had a specially-made easel that enabled her to paint in bed, and a mirror was placed above it so she could see herself. [...] Painting became a way for Kahlo to explore questions of identity and existence, and she later stated that the accident and the isolating recovery period made her desire, [...] "to begin again, painting things just as I saw <b>them</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> own eyes and nothing more." ...|$|E

2500|$|Newly {{arrived in}} Rome, Ingres read with {{mounting}} indignation the relentlessly negative press clippings {{sent to him}} from Paris by his friends. In letters to his prospective father-in-law, he expressed his outrage at the critics: [...] "So the Salon is the scene of my disgrace;... The scoundrels, they waited until I was away to assassinate my reputation... I have never been so unhappy....I knew I had many enemies; I never was agreeable with them and never will be. My greatest wish would be to fly to the Salon and to confound <b>them</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> works, which don't in any way resemble theirs; [...] and the more I advance, the less their work will resemble mine." [...] He vowed never again to exhibit at the Salon, and his refusal to return to Paris led to the breaking up of his engagement. Julie Forestier, when asked years later why she had never married, responded, [...] "When one has had the honor of being engaged to M. Ingres, one does not marry." ...|$|E

60|$|So {{the dogs}} remain in peaceable {{possession}} of the streets. I do not {{say that they do}} not howl at night, nor that they do not attack people who have not a red fez on their heads.
