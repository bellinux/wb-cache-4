5|$|Although {{the founders}} of the Tang related to <b>the</b> <b>glory</b> <b>of</b> the earlier Han dynasty (3rd century–3rd century), the basis for much of their {{administrative}} organization was very similar to the previous Northern and Southern dynasties. The Northern Zhou (6th century) fubing system of divisional militia was continued by the Tang, along with farmer-soldiers serving in rotation from the capital or frontier in order to receive appropriated farmland. The equal-field system of the Northern Wei (4th–6th centuries) was also kept, although there were a few modifications.|$|E
5|$|Compositions in the haridasa {{literature}} are sub-divided into four types: kirthane, suladi, ugabhoga and mundige. Kirthanes are devotional musical compositions with refrains based on raga and tala and celebrate <b>the</b> <b>glory</b> <b>of</b> god. The suladi are tala based, the ugabhoga are melody based while the mundige {{are in the}} form of riddles. Compositions were also modelled on jogula (lullaby songs) and sobane (marriage songs). A common feature of haridasa compositions are influences from the Hindu epics, the Ramayana, the Mahabharata and Bhagavata.|$|E

5|$|After the Suez Crisis and the Six-Day War, {{the army}} came to arm the most {{important}} place. For technical reasons (distance of communication with bases) and because new places of historical interest were accessible, the top brass debated whether to transfer the postings of new recruits at Massada to a more appropriate place.

5|$|Christodorus of Coptus, an Egyptian {{poet and}} writer wrote a lengthy (416 lines long) hexameter piece of poetry {{inspired}} by <b>the</b> <b>glory</b> <b>of</b> the statues housed within {{the halls of}} the Baths of Zeuxippus. This poem actually consisted of a number of short epigrams (six in total), each focusing on one or a small group of statues within the Baths, designed to combine to form one work. While {{it has been suggested that}} the epigrams of Christodorus of Coptus may actually have been inscribed on the (bases) of the statues themselves, this is unlikely because of his use of the ekphrastic medium, and the presence of the past tense in the text.|$|E

5|$|Due to its {{criticism}} of Albrecht and the event it portrayed, the painting often {{is seen as}} strongly anti-Prussian. While it appears to glorify Poland, it is also critical of the country. Matejko went beyond portraying <b>the</b> <b>glory</b> <b>of</b> a historical event and attempted to convey hints of how the country's history would play out in the future. This event was merely a hollow victory that failed to secure Poland's future. Matejko shows that the homage was an empty gesture {{and that it was}} Prussia that exploited it rather than Poland. Nobody in the painting is smiling except a lady of the court who is engaged in idle gossip.|$|E
5|$|Gaudí also practiced landscaping, {{often in}} urban settings. He aimed to place his {{works in the}} most {{appropriate}} natural and architectural surroundings by studying the location of his constructions thoroughly and trying to naturally integrate them into those surroundings. For this purpose, he often used the material that was most common in the nearby environment, such as the slate of Bellesguard and the grey Bierzo granite in the Episcopal Palace, Astorga. Many of his projects were gardens, such as the Güell Park and the Can Artigas Gardens, or incorporated gardens, as in the Casa Vicens or the Güell Pavilions. Gaudí's harmonious approach to landscaping is exemplified at the First Mystery of <b>the</b> <b>Glory</b> <b>of</b> the Rosary at Montserrat, where the architectural framework is nature itself—here the Montserrat rock—nature encircles the group of sculptures that adorned {{the path to the}} Holy Cave.|$|E
5|$|How great <b>the</b> <b>glory</b> <b>of</b> Origen was, {{appears from}} the fact that Firmilianus, bishop of Cæsarea, with all the Cappadocian bishops, sought a visit from him, and entertained him for a long while. Sometime afterwards, going to Palestine to visit the holy places, he came to Cæsarea and was {{instructed}} at length by Origen in the Holy Scriptures. It appears also {{from the fact}} that he went to Antioch, on the request of Mammaea, mother of the Emperor Alexander, and a woman religiously disposed, and was there held in great honour, and sent letters to the Emperor Philip, who was the first among the Roman rulers, to become a Christian, and to his mother, letters which are still extant.|$|E

5|$|In 1584, Virupaksha Pandita, {{the head}} priest at the Virupaksha Temple in Vijayanagara, wrote an account {{on the life}} and deeds of the 12th-century saint and vachana poet Chennabasava. The writing, titled Chenna Basava Purana, regards the protagonist as an {{incarnation}} of god Shiva and describes <b>the</b> <b>glory</b> <b>of</b> Shiva and his famous devotees. The book gives valuable information, including dates, about early Veerashaiva saints and vachanakaras (vachana poets). In addition to religious content, the writing provides useful insights about the former capital Vijayanagara, its royal palace, its market places and merchants, its military encampments, specialisations and divisions and the guilds of workers who served the military in various capacities. Other authors from the 16th century were Chermanka (Chermanka Kavya), Virabhadraraja (Virabhadra Vijaya), Chennabasavanka (Mahadevi Akkanna Purana), Nanjunda of Ikkeri (Bhairavaesvara Kavya) and Sadasiva Yogi (Ramanatha Vilasa).|$|E
5|$|In AD 26, Judah Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston) is {{a wealthy}} prince and {{merchant}} in Jerusalem, {{who lives with}} his mother, Miriam (Martha Scott); his sister, Tirzah (Cathy O'Donnell); their loyal slave, Simonides (Sam Jaffe); and Simonides' daughter, Esther (Haya Harareet). Esther loves Judah, but is committed to another. Judah's childhood friend, the Roman citizen Messala (Stephen Boyd), is now a tribune. After several years away from Jerusalem, Messala returns as the new commander of the Roman garrison. Messala believes in <b>the</b> <b>glory</b> <b>of</b> Rome and its imperial power, while Judah is devoted to his faith and {{the freedom of the}} Jewish people. This difference causes tension between the friends, and results in their split after Messala issues an ultimatum demanding that Judah delivers potential rebels amongst the populace to the Roman authorities.|$|E
5|$|In this respect, Traherne's work {{is often}} {{compared}} to the abounding joy and mysticism found {{in the works of}} William Blake, Walt Whitman, and Gerard Manley Hopkins. According to Traherne scholar Denise Inge, Traherne's introduction of a child's viewpoint to narrate his theological and moral premises was unknown or certainly unappreciated in the literature of this time. His poems frequently explore <b>the</b> <b>glory</b> <b>of</b> creation and what he perceived as his intimate relationship with God. He drew deeply on the writings of Aristotle and on the early Church Fathers for his concept of Man and human nature. Little mention is made of sin and suffering in the works that have dominated 20th-century criticism, and some critics have seen his verse as bordering upon pantheism (or perhaps panentheism).|$|E

5|$|Larger scale state-generating {{processes}} {{developed in}} Slavic {{areas in the}} 9th century. Great Moravia, the most prominent Slavic state of the era, became established in the early 9th century south of modern Poland. The original lands of Great Moravia included what is now Moravia and western Slovakia, plus parts of Bohemia, Pannonia and southern regions of Lesser Poland. <b>The</b> <b>glory</b> <b>of</b> the Great Moravian empire became fully apparent in light of archeological discoveries; lavishly equipped burials are especially spectacular. Such finds do not extend to the lands that now constitute southern Poland, however. The great territorial expansion of Great Moravia {{took place during the}} reign of Svatopluk I {{at the end of the}} 9th century. The Moravian state collapsed quite suddenly; in 906, weakened by an internal crisis and Magyar invasions, it ceased to exist entirely.|$|E
5|$|Literary works {{connected}} to the game include the short fiction of Ring Lardner and novels such as Bernard Malamud's The Natural (the source for the movie), Robert Coover's The Universal Baseball Association, Inc., J. Henry Waugh, Prop., and W. P. Kinsella's Shoeless Joe (the source for Field of Dreams). Baseball's literary canon also includes the beat reportage of Damon Runyon; the columns of Grantland Rice, Red Smith, Dick Young, and Peter Gammons; and the essays of Roger Angell. Among the celebrated nonfiction books {{in the field are}} Lawrence S. Ritter's <b>The</b> <b>Glory</b> <b>of</b> Their Times, Roger Kahn's The Boys of Summer, and Michael Lewis's Moneyball. The 1970 publication of major league pitcher Jim Bouton's tell-all chronicle Ball Four is considered {{a turning point in the}} reporting of professional sports.|$|E
5|$|Potemkin then {{embarked}} on a period of city-founding. Construction started at his first effort, Kherson, in 1778, {{as a base for}} a new Black Sea Fleet he intended to build. Potemkin approved every plan himself, but construction was slow, and the city proved costly and vulnerable to plague. Next was the port of Akhtiar, annexed with the Crimea, which became Sevastopol. Then he built Simferopol as the Crimean capital. His biggest failure, however, was his effort to build the city of Ekaterinoslav (lit. <b>The</b> <b>glory</b> <b>of</b> Catherine), now Dnipropetrovsk. The second most successful city of Potemkin's rule was Nikolayev (now better known as Mykolaiv), which he founded in 1789. Potemkin also initiated the redesign of Odessa after its capture from the Turks; it was to {{turn out to be the}} greatest.|$|E
