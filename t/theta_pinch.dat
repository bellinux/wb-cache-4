40|$|A {{diffusion}} {{equation is}} derived which describes {{the evolution of}} a magnetic field in a plasma of arbitrary beta and resistivity. The equation is valid for a one-dimensional slab geometry, assumes the plasma remains in quasi-equilibrium throughout its evolution and does not include thermal transport. Scaling laws governing the rate of change of the magnetic energy, particle drift energy, and magnetic flux are calculated. It is found that the magnetic free energy can be substantially larger than the particle drift energy and can be an important energy reservoir in driving plasma instabilities (e. g., the lower-hybrid-drift instability). In addition, the effect of a spatially varying resistivity on {{the evolution of a}} reversed-field plasma is studied. The resistivity model used is based upon the anomalous transport properties associated with the nonlocal mode structure of the lower-hybrid-drift instability.

A spherical <b>theta</b> <b>pinch</b> is proposed to act as a plasma target in various applications including a plasma stripper cell. One key parameter for such applications is the free electron density. A linear dependency of this density to the amount of energy transferred into the plasma from an energy storage was found by C.

The traditional two models of energy transfer efficiency are based on assumptions which comprise the risk of systematical errors. To obtain precise results, this paper proposes a new model without the necessity of any assumption to calculate the energy transfer efficiency for an inductively coupled plasma device. Further, a comparison of these three different models is given at a fixed operation voltage for the full range of working gas pressures. Due to the inappropriate assumptions included in the traditional models, one owns a tendency to overestimate the energy transfer efficiency whereas the other leads to an underestimation.

40|$|Results are {{presented}} demonstrating the e ect of inductive coil geometry and current sheet trajectory on the exhaust velocity of propellant in conical <b>theta</b> <b>pinch</b> pulsed induc- tive plasma accelerators. The electromagnetic coupling between the inductive coil of the accelerator and a plasma current sheet is simulated, substituting a conical copper frustum for the plasma. The variation of system inductance {{as a function}} of plasma position is obtained by displacing the simulated current sheet from the coil while measuring the total inductance of the coil. Four coils of differing geometries were employed, and the total inductance of each coil was measured {{as a function of}} the axial displacement of two sep- arate copper frusta both having the same cone angle and length as the coil but with one compressed to a smaller size relative to the coil. The measured relationship between total coil inductance and current sheet position closes a dynamical circuit model that is used to calculate the resulting current sheet velocity for various coil and current sheet con gura- tions. The results of this model, which neglects the pinching contribution to thrust, radial propellant con nement, and plume divergence, indicate that in a conical <b>theta</b> <b>pinch</b> ge- ometry current sheet pinching is detrimental to thruster performance, reducing the kinetic energy of the exhausting propellant by up to 50 % (at the upper bound for the parameter range of the study). The decrease in exhaust velocity was larger for coils and simulated current sheets of smaller half cone angles. An upper bound for the pinching contribution to thrust is estimated for typical operating parameters. Measurements of coil inductance for three di erent current sheet pinching conditions are used to estimate the magnetic pressure as a function of current sheet radial compression. The gas-dynamic contribution to axial acceleration is also estimated and shown to not compensate for the decrease in axial electromagnetic acceleration that accompanies the radial compression of the plasma in conical theta pinches...|$|E

For a period up to 70 microsec from the onset of X-ray emission, neither transmitted nor scattered laser radiation was observed above the detector threshold of 0. 3 % of the incident flux.

No line corresponding to the coronal lines was observed from the high-temperature plasma, but lines with wavelengths very nearly identical to those of two of the forbidden transitions were observed; these lines were due to allowed transitions of Ar II in a cooler portion of the plasma.

40|$|The {{concept of}} (shear) AlfvÃ¨n wave {{resonant}} absorption for heating a plasma {{has been demonstrated}} on a <b>theta</b> <b>pinch.</b> The m = 1 mode is excited {{by means of a}} helical launching structure with a given wave length, at different frequencies. When the frequency is situated in the continuous AlfvÃ¨n spectrum, the kink energy is transmitted to the AlfvÃ¨n waves, where it is rapidly thermalized. The source term for the excitation is proportional to the density gradient. The measurement of the heating power is performed with a diamagnetic probe. We show that the probe signal can be treated as a thermodynamic variable which allows us to deduce an exact energy balance. The resonance curve of the heating power presents the peculiar shape predicted by theory. Strong power coupling exists between RF source and plasma, which follows from power balance considerations, allowing nearly all power delivered by the coils to be dissipated in the AlfvÃ¨n waves by resistivity and viscosity. The efficiency approaches unity, even in spite of the high compression ratio. The plasma motion is monitored by streak photography and shows nearly critical damping of the kink...|$|E
40|$|Separatrix {{shapes and}} {{internal}} structures of a field-reversed configuration (FRC) plasma {{are determined by}} comparing the measured magnetic fluxes with the Grad-Shafranov equation. This analysis also suggests a width of an edge-layer plasma wÏi (w {{is the number of}} ion gyro-radius Ïi), a beta value at the separatrix Î²s, and the formation of magnetic islands near the field null. In order to confirm these findings by the magnetic method, a radiation power density of the FRC is measured. It is found that the w and Î²s values agree well with those obtained by the radiation measurement. However, the positions of the magnetic islands do not coincide with those appearing in an intensity contour map of the radiation. Asymmetrical profiles of the radiation are also discussed with respect to the nonconcentricity of the pressure constant surface.

40|$|Data from an {{inductive}} conical <b>theta</b> <b>pinch</b> accelerator {{are presented}} to {{gain insight into}} the process of inductive current sheet formation {{in the presence of}} a preionized background gas produced by a steady-state RF-discharge. The presence of a preionized plasma has been previously shown to allow for current sheet formation at lower discharge voltages and energies than those found in other pulsed inductive accelerator concepts, leading to greater accelerator efficiencies at lower power levels. Time-resolved magnetic probe measurements are obtained for different background pressures and pulse energies to characterize the effects of these parameters on current sheet formation. Indices are defined that describe time-resolved current sheet characteristics, such as the total current owing in the current sheet, the time-integrated total current ('strength'), and current sheet velocity. It is found that for a given electric field strength, maximums in total current, strength, and velocity occur for one particular background pressure. At other pressures, these current sheet indices are considerably smaller. The trends observed in these indices are explained in terms of the principles behind Townsend breakdown that lead to a dependence on the ratio of the electric field to the background pressure. Time-integrated photographic data are also obtained at the same experimental conditions, and qualitatively they compare quite favorably with the time-resolved magnetic field data...|$|E
40|$|The {{theory of}} plasma blobs is {{extended}} {{to treat the}} stability of "non-thermalized" blobs, which have both density and temperature higher than the surrounding plasma and can transport heat as well as particles.

Rotation is expected {{to play a role in}} the evolution of blobs created by Edge Localized Modes (ELMs).

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1993 Plasma {{formation}} in a coaxial double <b>theta</b> <b>pinch</b> device is analyzed. This device, called the Coaxial Slow Source (CSS), has demonstrated {{the formation of}} annular field reversed configurations on diffusive timescales. Three analytical models are developed and used to: characterize the coupling between the magnetic configuration and the driving circuit, predict a temperature limit due to impurity radiation, and reveal an instability due to localized radiation cooling. A comprehensive model incorporating the interactions of neutral and ionized particles is used to simulate the CSS experiment on a computer. This two-dimensional MHD two-fluid code called scCOAX is adapted from an earlier version used by Hahn (1). Simulations are compared to experimental data from the CSS to test the models, and quantify the physical processes involved. The slow forming plasma is strongly influenced by the surrounding neutral fill gas due to: the energy lost by ionization of these neutrals, and enhanced heat conduction from charge exchange collisions between neutrals and ions. The friction between the neutral and ionized fluids is important in modeling the formation dynamics.

40|$|A new {{simplified}} {{design is}} being developed for injecting and trapping Field-Reversed Configurations (FRCs) into liners, which {{is compatible with the}} energetic liner implosions of interest for Magnetized Target Fusion (MTF). Conical theta pinches that inject from each end of the liner region are proposed. The conical angle can be chosen to make axial translation out of the conical <b>theta</b> <b>pinch</b> into the liner region occur on approximately the same time scale as radial compression. Thus no crowbar switch is needed for the high-voltage fast-rising current pulse. The toroidal field from conical theta-pinch injection and/or Z-pinch preionization should rapidly annihilate upon merging of the two oppositely directed FRCs. Two dc coils in a Helmholtz-like configuration are all that are needed to serve the functions of cusp, translation, and mirror fields for trapping in the liner. The mirror strength required for trapping is not as critical as when using onesided injection because the merging FRCs have no net momentum when they collide. Previously observed damping of axial kinetic energy suggests that viscous damping parallel to B 'is strong for FRCs with mfp comparable to FRC length, and conversion of directed energy to thermal energy should occur on a time scale comparable to the injection time.
