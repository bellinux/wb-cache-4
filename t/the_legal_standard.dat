5|$|In February 2013, the Michigan Department of Civil Rights (MDCR) filed a {{complaint}} with the US Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights (OCR). MDCR's complaint asserted that new research clearly establishes that use of American Indian imagery negatively impacts student learning, creating an unequal learning environment in violation of Article VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In June 2013, the OCR dismissed the case on the basis that <b>the</b> <b>legal</b> <b>standard</b> required not only harm, but the intent to do harm, which was not established.|$|E
5|$|After a small {{quantity}} {{was struck}} for circulation, the Mint received complaints regarding the prominent placement of Gobrecht's {{name on the}} dollar, and the design was modified to incorporate his name in a less conspicuous position. In January 1837, <b>the</b> <b>legal</b> <b>standard</b> for the percentage of precious metal in silver coins was changed from 89.2% to 90%, and the Gobrecht dollars struck after that point reflect this change. In total, 1,900 Gobrecht dollars were struck during the official production run. Production of the Seated Liberty dollar, which utilized the same obverse design as the Gobrecht dollar, began mintage in 1840. In the 1850s, Mint officials controversially re-struck the coins without authorization.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{complaints}} from bar owners about {{their inability to}} obtain liability insurance, the state passed legislation in 1987 to limit liability to cases where the server could have realistically known that the patron was underage or intoxicated, and to limit lawsuits to types of injuries that are foreseeable. The act also instituted <b>the</b> <b>legal</b> <b>standard</b> of comparative negligence in these cases, wherein the monetary damages against a licensed establishment can be reduced if {{there are others who}} are also negligent (e.g. the patron, other bars). Additional legislation passed in 1987 substantially limited the liability of social hosts for adult guests.|$|E

500|$|In 2001, {{many other}} {{families}} also {{filed suit in}} the NVICP, also because they believed their children's autism had been caused by vaccines and they were therefore entitled to compensation. The following year, the Office of Special Masters of the United States Court of Federal Claims {{held a series of}} meetings to decide how to deal with these claims, and that July, issued an order establishing the Omnibus Autism Proceeding. According to the Cedillos, Michelle was developmentally normal until she received her MMR vaccine at the age of 15 months, at which point she developed a 105-degree fever, began vomiting and developed diarrhea. Michelle was diagnosed with autism 18 months after receiving her MMR vaccine. According to the Washington Post, <b>the</b> <b>legal</b> <b>standard</b> to which the cases were subjected in this trial meant that [...] "the outcome will hinge not on scientific standards of evidence but on a legal standard of plausibilitywhat one lawyer for the families called '50 percent and a feather'."

500|$|When the {{full-scale}} production began, {{the reverse}} eagle {{was surrounded by}} 26 stars rather than 24 as Patterson had originally requested of Sully, as the states of Arkansas and Michigan had been admitted to the Union since Patterson's letter was penned in 1835. Some of the Gobrecht dollars produced were struck with 'medal alignment', meaning that the obverse and reverse images both face upward when the coin is rotated around its vertical axis. For the 1837 production (which kept the 1836 date), Patterson ordered that the coins be struck in coin alignment, the opposite of medal alignment, and the practice with current US coins (the two faces both are upright when the coin is rotated about its horizontal axis). An act of January 18, 1837, officially changed <b>the</b> <b>legal</b> <b>standard</b> for silver coins from 89.2% to 90% silver. Numismatic historian Walter Breen asserts that those pieces struck before the passage of this act are technically patterns (or coins created to test their design, composition or other points), as they were not authorized by Congress. In total, 1,000 pieces dated 1836 were struck in 89.2% silver and 600 in 90% silver. Gobrecht dollars struck prior to passage of the act weighed , while those struck later weighed [...]|$|E
500|$|FBI Special Agent Robert Sawyer {{initially}} {{said there}} was probable cause to believe the trio were conspiring to kill Obama, based on searches of their hotel rooms and cars. However, United States Attorney Troy Eid said the racist statements the suspects made following their arrests had not risen to <b>the</b> <b>legal</b> <b>standard</b> {{that would have allowed}} the filing of federal charges for threatening a presidential candidate, an offense that falls under the same statute as threatening the President of the United States. Prosecutors also said they had insufficient evidence that they had the means to carry out a plot to kill Obama. Eid said the searches of the suspects' rooms and computers turned up no evidence of a plot or conspiracy. Eid and his aides said the decision not to press charges of threatening a presidential candidate was at least in part because they did not believe a jury would convict them based on the reliability of Johnson's testimony. Jeffrey Dorschner, Eid's spokesman, said a defense attorney “would tear him apart”. Although Eid would be accused of racism and political posturing for not seeking the charge, Eid said, [...] "The 'political' thing to have done in this case, of course, would have been to charge all three defendants with making a threat against Obama and then quietly drop those charges later — expedient, Machiavellian and self-serving, but also illegal, unethical and immoral." ...|$|E

40|$|That {{the conduct}} of human affairs does not always conform to the {{requirements}} of the law is a surprise to no one. But in few areas of critical life and death decisions is there such a disparity between commonly recognized principles of law and developing medical practice as exists in the area of withholding lifesaving medical care from infants, notably defective infants. The law is said to restrict physicians and parents from withholding lifesaving treatment from infants for the purpose of causing their deaths. Yet it is reported that {{it is not uncommon for}} lifesaving treatment to be denied severely defective infants, and that thousands of infant deaths result each year from this lack of treatment. This disparity between the law and practice may result from confusion in the medical community about <b>the</b> <b>legal</b> <b>standards</b> for nontreatment decisions, or from the absence of any effective mechanism to enforce the law.
