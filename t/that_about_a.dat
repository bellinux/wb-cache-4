Thousands more drowned {{as they tried to}} get across the river. It is thus likely <b>that</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> third of the German force lost their lives. However, it appears that the majority escaped, including the eight reges alongside Chnodomar. The Romans lost just 243 men, including four tribuni (regimental commanders) of which two were commanders of cataphracti.|$|E

5|$|The {{chronology}} {{and circumstances}} surrounding the conclusion of Lǫgmaðr's reign are uncertain. According to one source, he voluntarily resigned the kingship and journeyed to Jerusalem where he died. This account could be evidence that he died on crusade: one possibility is the First Crusade, perhaps in the entourage of Robert II, Duke of Normandy; another possibility is the so-called Norwegian Crusade, in the entourage of Sigurðr Magnússon, King of Norway. Although one source claims that Lǫgmaðr's trek to the Holy Land was undertaken in remorse for the cruelty he had inflicted upon Haraldr, {{another possibility is that}} he was forced into exile instead. Whatever the case, it is apparent <b>that</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> decade after Magnús' death, the Crovan dynasty was restored to the kingship in the person of Lǫgmaðr's youngest brother.|$|E

25|$|The term {{substrate}} {{with reference}} to Proto-Germanic refers to lexical items and phonological elements that {{do not appear to}} be descended from Proto-Indo-European. The substrate theory postulates that the elements came from an earlier population that stayed amongst the Indo-Europeans and was influential enough to bring over some elements of its own language. The theory of a non-Indo-European substrate was first proposed by Sigmund Feist, who estimated <b>that</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> third of all Proto-Germanic lexical items came from the substrate.|$|E
25|$|It is {{suggested}} <b>that</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> {{fifth of the}} Turkish population are Alevis, whose folk music is performed by a type of travelling bard or ozan called aşık, who travels with the saz or baglama, an iconic image of Turkish folk music. These songs, which hail from the central northeastern area, are about mystical revelations, invocations to Alevi saints and Muhammad's son-in-law, Ali, whom they hold in high esteem. In Turkish aşık literally means 'in love'. Whoever follows this tradition has the Aşık assignation put before their names, because it {{is suggested}} that music becomes an essential facet of their being, for example as in Aşık Veysel.|$|E

25|$|Dutch was {{not made}} the {{official}} language of the colony and was not widely used by the indigenous Indonesian population. The majority of legally acknowledged Dutchmen were bi-lingual Indo Eurasians. Dutch was only used by a limited educated elite, and in 1942, around {{two percent of the}} total population in the Dutch East Indies spoke Dutch including over 1 million indigenous Indonesians. A number of Dutch loan words are used in present-day Indonesian, particularly technical terms (see List of Dutch loan words in Indonesian). These words generally had no alternative in Malay and were adopted into the Indonesian vocabulary giving a linguistic insight into which concepts are part of the Dutch colonial heritage. Hendrik Maier of the University of California says <b>that</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> fifth of contemporary Indonesian language can be traced to Dutch.|$|E
25|$|The {{rebalancing}} and re-indexing of leveraged ETFs {{may have}} considerable costs when markets are volatile. The rebalancing {{problem is that}} the fund manager incurs trading losses because he needs to buy when the index goes up and sell when the index goes down in order to maintain a fixed leverage ratio. A 2.5% daily change in the index will for example reduce value of a -2x bear fund by about 0.18% per day, which means <b>that</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> third of the fund may be wasted in trading losses within a year (1-(1-0.18%)252=36.5%). Investors may however circumvent this problem by buying or writing futures directly, accepting a varying leverage ratio. A more reasonable estimate of daily market changes is 0.5%, which leads to a 2.6% yearly loss of principal in a 3x leveraged fund.|$|E

Former mayor Ron Oden estimated <b>that</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> third of Palm Springs is gay. Over various times, the city has catered to LGBT tourists. Palm Springs is host to the Greater Palm Springs Pride Celebration. This celebration, held every year in November, includes events such as the Palm Springs Pride Golf Classic, the Stonewall Equality Concert, and a Broadway in Drag Pageant. The city also held same sex wedding ceremonies at the iconic 'Forever Marilyn' statue located downtown, before its relocation in 2014.|$|E

25|$|Some chiropractors oppose {{vaccination}} {{and water}} fluoridation, which are common public health practices. Within the chiropractic community {{there are significant}} disagreements about vaccination, {{one of the most}} cost-effective public health interventions available. Most chiropractic writings on vaccination focus on its negative aspects, claiming that it is hazardous, ineffective, and unnecessary. Some chiropractors have embraced vaccination, but {{a significant portion of the}} profession rejects it, as original chiropractic philosophy traces diseases to causes in the spine and states that vaccines interfere with healing. The extent to which anti-vaccination views perpetuate the current chiropractic profession is uncertain. The American Chiropractic Association and the International Chiropractors Association support individual exemptions to compulsory vaccination laws, and a 1995 survey of U.S. chiropractors found <b>that</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> third believed there was no scientific proof that immunization prevents disease. The Canadian Chiropractic Association supports vaccination; a survey in Alberta in 2002 found that 25% of chiropractors advised patients for, and 27% against, vaccinating themselves or their children.|$|E

He also criticized it for sharing too much of the American gangster and spy film clichés. The most critical review was done by Georg Metz of Dagbladet Information, who criticized its historicity and thought the characters were psychologically underdeveloped and uninteresting. Metz wrote, [...] "The nicest [...] one can say about this film, if it is nice, is that it celebrates the naïve view of history" [...] and described it as [...] " [...] neo-nationalistic panopticon of predominantly cardboard figures that will be suitable for evening entertainment for the Danish People's Party and the Liberal Party congresses.
