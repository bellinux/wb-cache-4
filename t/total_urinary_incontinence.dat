40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the subjective, lived {{experience}} of women who suffer from long-term <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> and to show how a cultural model helps define that experience. Using an illness narrative approach and underlying theoretical frameworks from cognitive and critical medical anthropology, the specific aims of the study were to describe and analyze (1) what <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> means, and (2) how that meaning is constructed by women who live with long-term <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence.</b> Seventeen community-dwelling women (ages 28 – 86) participated in in-depth interviews. Three dominant plot types were discovered in informant 2 ̆ 7 s narratives: the <b>Urinary</b> <b>Incontinence</b> Quest Narrative, <b>Urinary</b> <b>Incontinence</b> Restitution and Redemption Narratives, and the <b>Urinary</b> <b>Incontinence</b> Victim Narrative. Three dominant themes evolved from interview data: Strategies for Living with <b>Urinary</b> <b>Incontinence,</b> Memories of <b>Urinary</b> <b>Incontinence,</b> and Responses to <b>Urinary</b> <b>Incontinence.</b> Four dominant themes were identified in media representations of female incontinence: Normalizing <b>Urinary</b> <b>Incontinence,</b> Fixing <b>Urinary</b> <b>Incontinence,</b> Stigmatizing <b>Urinary</b> <b>Incontinence,</b> and Avoiding <b>Urinary</b> <b>Incontinence.</b> Plot types, shared themes from narrative interviews, and influences from others were compared with themes that emerged from public representations of female incontinence, and a cultural model for long-term female <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> was developed. Findings suggest: (1) the meaning of long-term female <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> is constructed and negotiated as a result of individual and shared experiences, interactions with healthcare professionals, friends, and family members, and publicly available representations of female <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence,</b> (2) the cultural model constructed by women differs significantly from the public model for female <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence,</b> and (3) women 2 ̆ 7 s narratives provide a method for accommodating similarities and differences between personal and public models for female <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence.</b> Implications for clinical practice, education, and research are also included. ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTR ACT: <b>Urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> {{in women}} is quite {{prevalent}} today and management can be costly. <b>Urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> can be minimal or quite bothersome, limiting {{activities of daily}} living. It is subdivided into urgency <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence,</b> stress <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence,</b> and mixed <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence.</b> As such, treatment can vary immensely depending on the clinical presentations, ranging from behavioral modification to medicinal thera-pies to surgical procedures. First-line management for all <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> includes lifestyle and behavioral modifications. Historically, treatment options for urgency <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> were predominantly antimuscarinics, while more recent therapies include oral beta- 3 agonist administration, sacral neuromodulation, onabotulinumtoxinA injection, and posterior tibial nerve stimulation. Stress <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> can be treated {{with a variety of}} urethral bulking agent injections or sling-based procedures using mesh, autologous fascia, or cadaveric fascia, as well as urethral intrasphincteric injec-tions of autologous muscle-derived cells in new clinical trials.

40|$|Purpose: To {{develop a}} {{decision}} support system to discriminate the diagnoses of alterations in urinary elimination, according to the nursing terminology of NANDA International (NANDA-I). Methods: A fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) was structured considering six possible diagnoses: stress urinary incontinence, reflex urinary incontinence, urge urinary incontinence, functional urinary incontinence, <b>total</b> <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> and urinary retention; and 39 signals associated with them. the model was implemented in Microsoft Visual C++(R) Edition 2005 and applied in 195 real cases. Its performance was evaluated through the agreement test, comparing its results with the diagnoses determined by three experts (nurses). the sensitivity and specificity of the model were calculated considering the expert's opinion as a gold standard. in order to compute the Kappa's values we considered two situations, since more than one diagnosis was possible: the overestimation of the accordance in which the case was considered as concordant when at least one diagnoses was equal; and the underestimation of the accordance, in which the case was considered as discordant when at least one diagnosis was different. Results: the overestimation of the accordance showed an excellent agreement (kappa = 0. 92, p < 0. 0001); and the underestimation provided a moderate agreement (kappa = 0. 42, p < 0. 0001). in general the FCM model showed high sensitivity and specificity, of 0. 95 and 0. 92, respectively, but provided a low specificity value in determining the diagnosis of urge urinary incontinence (0. 43) and a low sensitivity value to <b>total</b> <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> (0. 42). Conclusions: the {{decision support system}} developed presented a good performance compared to other types of expert systems for differential diagnosis of alterations in urinary elimination. Since there are few similar studies in the literature, we are convinced {{of the importance of}} investing in this kind of modeling, both from the theoretical and from the health applied points of view. Limitations: in spite of the good results, the FCM should be improved to identify the diagnoses of urge urinary incontinence and <b>total</b> <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence.</b> (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

40|$|Objective: Description {{and early}} {{results of a}} new {{urethral}} sling technique for treatment of postprostatectomy urinary incontinence, which combines efficacy, low cost and technical simplicity. Materials and Methods: From May 2003 to April 2004, 30 patients with moderate or <b>total</b> <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence,</b> following radical prostatectomy or endoscopic resection of the prostate, under-went the new technique. The technique {{is based on the}} placement of a longitudinal-shaped sling in the bulbar urethra, measuring 4 cm in length by 1. 8 cm in width, made of Dacron or polypropylene mesh, fixed by 4 sutures on each side, with 2 sutures passed with Stamey-Pereira needle by retropubic approach and 2 by prepubic approach, which are then tied over the pubis. Pressure control was determined by interrupting the loss of infused water through a suprapu-bic cystostomy 60 cm from the pubis level. Results: Pre-operative assessment excluded vesical instability, urethral stenosis and urinary infection. Suprapubic cystostomy was removed when the patient was able to satisfactorily void with urinary residue lower than 100 mL, which occurred in 29 of the 30 cases.

40|$|Dynamic graciloplasty {{is used as}} a {{treatment}} modality for <b>total</b> <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> caused by a paralyzed sphincter. A problem with this application is undesirable fatigue of the muscle caused by continuous electrical stimulation. Therefore, the neosphincter must be trained via a rigorous regimen to transform it from a fatigue-prone state to a fatigue-resistant state. To avoid or shorten this training period, the application of sequential segmental neuromuscular stimulation (SSNS) was examined. This form of stimulation proved previously to be highly effective in acutely reducing fatigue caused by electrical stimulation. The contractile function and perfusion of gracilis muscles employed as neosphincters were compared between conventional, single-channel, continuous stimulation, and multichannel sequential stimulation in 8 dogs. The sequentially stimulated neosphincter proved to have an endurance 2. 9 times longer (as measured by halftime to fatigue) than continuous stimulation and a better blood perfusion during stimulation (both of which were significant changes, p < 0. 05). Clinically, this will not antiquate training of the muscle, but SSNS could reduce the need for long and rigorous training protocols, making dynamic graciloplasty more attractive as a method of treating urinary or fecal incontinence...|$|E

40|$|Urinary {{incontinence}} {{caused by}} functional or anatomical incompetence of the urethral sphincter {{is one of}} the most challenging problems in urological surgery. Posterior urethral lengthening accomplished by tubularization of the trigonum, which was proposed by H. H. Young, J. E. Dees and G. W. Leadbetter, has been shown to improve the outcome in epispadia patients with incontinence. We report our experiences of Young-Dees-Leadbetter's operation in three patients. Case 1 was a 55 -year-old woman who had undergone removal of the external genitalia to treat genital Paget's disease, resulting in total incontinence. About one half of the urethra had been removed, resulting in a shortened urethral length of 2. 5 cm. Case 2 was a 6 -year-old boy with penile epispadia, who had leadage of about a third of the total urine volume. Case 3, an 18 year-old female patient, suffered from <b>total</b> <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> which had resulted from a defect in the entire urethra and bladder neck following a motor vehicle accident.

40|$|AIMS: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH). METHODS: Patients with new-onset iNPH were prospectively evaluated for LUTS via detailed history and physical, and administration of questionnaires from the International Consultation on Incontinence to assess incontinence (ICIq-UI), overactive bladder (ICIq-OAB), and quality of life (ICIq-LUTqol), as well as the American Urological Association Symptom Score bother scale. All patients with moderate-to-severe LUTS were offered urodynamic testing. Sub-analysis was performed based on gender, medical comorbidities, and age. RESULTS: Fifty-five consecutive patients with iNPH completed the initial evaluation and surveys. <b>Total</b> <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> score was mild to moderate (8. 710. 64 : 0 - 21 scale) with 90. 9 % experiencing leakage and 74. 5 % reporting urge incontinence. The most common OAB symptom was nocturia (2. 2 +/- 0. 14 : 0 - 4 scale) with urge incontinence the most bothersome (3. 71 +/- 0. 44 : 0 - 10 scale). Quality-of-life impact was moderate (4. 47 +/- 0. 4 : 0 - 10 scale) and American Urological Association Symptom Score bother scale was 2. 89 +/- 0. 22 (0 - 6 scale).

40|$|ABSTRACT <b>Urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> is {{a common}} problem among women and it is {{estimated}} that between 15 and 55 % of them complain of lower urinary symptoms. The most prevalent form of <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> is associated with stress, followed by mixed <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> and urge <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence.</b> It is a symptom with several effects on quality of life of women mainly in their social, familiar and sexual domains. Female reproductive and urinary systems share anatomical structures, which promotes that urinary problems interfere with sexual function in females. This article is a review of both the concepts of female <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> and its impact on global and sexual quality of life. Nowadays, it is assumed that <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence,</b> especially urge <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence,</b> promotes anxiety and several self-esteem damages in women. The odour and the fear of incontinence during sexual intercourse affect female sexual function and this is related with the unpredictability and the chronicity of <b>incontinence,</b> namely urge <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence.</b> Female <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> management involves conservative (pelvic floor muscle training), surgical and pharmacological treatment.

Weight loss studies indicate that both surgical and nonsurgical weight loss leads to significant improvements in prevalence, frequency, and/or symptoms of <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence.</b> Conclusion: Epidemiological studies document overweight and obesity as important risk factors for <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence.</b> Weight loss by both surgical and more conservative approaches is effective in reducing <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> symptoms and should be strongly considered as a first line treatment for overweight and obese women with <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence.</b> Keywords: <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence,</b> obesity, wome...|$|R

40|$|Background : <b>Urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> is {{extremely}} common complaint {{in every part}} of the world. It causes a great deal of distress and embarrassment, as well as significant cost, to both individual and societies. <b>Urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> and pelvic organ prolapsed commonly coexist. The prevalence of women presenting with pelvic organ prolapsed are also diagnosed with <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> was 25 - 35 % and some studies shows higher prevalence <b>Urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> gives significant impact on social and productivity of the women. Objective: To determine the prevalence of <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> in women with pelvic organ prolapsed. Methods: This study is a descriptive study in 67 samples in women with pelvic organ prolapsed. Samples were obtained non-randomly by using consecutive sampling. All samples were examined using Pelvic Organ Prolepses Quantification (POPQ) procedure to measure degrees of prolapsed. An interview, measurement of residual urine, stress test, bladder diary recording, and urinalysis were performed to investigate presence of <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> and its type.   The data obtained analyzed descriptively for baseline characteristic and to determine its prevalence of <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence.</b> Results: Prevalence of <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> in women with pelvic organ prolapsed was 37, 32 %, consist of 31, 32 % stress type, 1. 49 % overactive bladder, and 4. 47 % overflow incontinence. There was no mixed <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> found in this study. Prevalence of <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> was 16. 42 % and 20. 90 % on those with I-II degrees and III- IV degrees of pelvic organ prolapsed respectively. Conclusion: Prevalence of <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> in women with pelvic organ prolapsed was 37, 32 %. </p...|$|R

30|$|Introduction: The {{etiology}} of urge <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> is unknown. Petros in {{the so called}} Integral Theory postulated that incompetent pelvic ligaments {{may play a role}} for he development of urge and urge <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence.</b> In 2012 Jäger reportet a 77 % cure rate for urge <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> after replacement of the uterosacral ligaments by an alloplastic tape.

Data were analysed by Student’s t-test for quantitative variables, the x 2 -test for qualitative variables and logistic regression. Increased age and body mass index {{were found to be}} significant risk factors of <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> (bivariate and multivariate analyses). There were also significant relationships between <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> and gravidity, parity, delivery mode, episiotomy, type of caesarean section (elective or emergency), cystocele, rectocele and chronic constipation (bivariate analysis only). There was no relationship between <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> and fetal birth weight or maternal employment status.
