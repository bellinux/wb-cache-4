5|$|Mihdhar {{was born}} in Saudi Arabia and fought in the Bosnian War during the 1990s. In early 1999, he {{traveled}} to Afghanistan where, as an experienced and respected jihadist, he was selected by Osama bin Laden {{to participate in the}} attacks. Mihdhar arrived in California with fellow hijacker Nawaf al-Hazmi in January 2000, after traveling to Malaysia for the Kuala Lumpur al-Qaeda Summit. At this point, the CIA was aware of Mihdhar, and he was photographed in Malaysia with another al-Qaeda member who was involved in <b>the</b> <b>USS</b> <b>Cole</b> bombing. The CIA did not inform the FBI when it learned that Mihdhar and Hazmi had entered the United States, and Mihdhar was not placed on any watchlists until late August 2001.|$|E

50|$|Following <b>the</b> 2000 <b>USS</b> <b>Cole</b> bombing, Mohammed Atef {{was moved}} to Kandahar, Zawahiri to Kabul, and Bin Laden fled to Kabul, later joining Atef when he {{realised}} no American reprisal attacks were forthcoming.|$|R
25|$|Following {{the attack}} on <b>the</b> <b>USS</b> <b>Cole</b> and 11 September 2001 {{terrorist}} attacks, the base had some major upgrades to its security gates, costing more than $12.5 million.|$|E
25|$|In 2000, <b>the</b> <b>USS</b> <b>Cole</b> bombing {{encouraged}} {{several members}} to depart. Mohammed Atef went to escape Kandahar, Zawahiri to Kabul, and Bin Laden fled to Kabul, later joining Atef when he realised no American reprisal attacks were forthcoming.|$|E
25|$|Next {{came the}} 2000 {{millennium}} attack plots, which included an attempted bombing of Los Angeles International Airport. On 12 October 2000, <b>the</b> <b>USS</b> <b>Cole</b> bombing occurred near {{the port of}} Yemen, and 17 U.S. Navy sailors were killed.|$|E

25|$|Al-Manar was {{the first}} TV station to report Hezbollah's {{condemnation}} of the September 11 attacks. Other non-state attacks against the United States have also been condemned on Al Manar, including <b>the</b> 2000 <b>USS</b> <b>Cole</b> bombing suicide attack against a US Navy destroyer.|$|R

Whenever al-Qaeda organised games of volleyball, Atef and Bin Laden were forced to be on separate teams since they were both tall, and good players.|$|R
25|$|Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri was interrogated {{numerous}} times. In 2007 he attributed his {{confessions of}} involvement in <b>the</b> <b>USS</b> <b>Cole</b> bombing to torture, including waterboarding. All the details Abd al-Rahim offered of his claims of torture were redacted from his transcript.|$|E
25|$|On 3 November 2002, a Hellfire missile {{was fired}} at {{a car in}} Yemen, killing Qaed Salim Sinan al-Harethi, an al-Qaeda leader thought to be {{responsible}} for <b>the</b> <b>USS</b> <b>Cole</b> bombing. It was the first direct U.S. strike in the War on Terrorism outside Afghanistan.|$|E
25|$|Following Yemeni {{unification}} in 1990, Wahhabi networks {{began moving}} missionaries {{into the country}} {{in an effort to}} subvert the capitalist north. Although it is unlikely that bin Laden or Saudi al-Qaeda were directly involved, the personal connections they made would be established over the next decade and used in <b>the</b> <b>USS</b> <b>Cole</b> bombing. Concerns grow over Al Qaeda's group in Yemen.|$|E
50|$|On 12 October 2000, {{one year}} prior to 9/11, Yemen became an early {{theater in the}} War on Terrorism, when <b>the</b> 2000 <b>USS</b> <b>Cole</b> bombing killed 17 American sailors and wounded 40 off the port coast of Aden, Yemen. In the aftermath, the {{government}} of Yemen rounded up numerous suspected terrorists, {{many of whom were}} identified as members of al-Qaeda.|$|R
50|$|Marlborough was {{the first}} naval ship on the scene to assist <b>the</b> {{stricken}} <b>USS</b> <b>Cole</b> after she was attacked in Aden, Yemen in October 2000. Marlborough, {{under the command of}} Captain Anthony Rix, was on passage to the UK after a six-month deployment in the Gulf and had a full medical detachment on board; when her offer of assistance was accepted she immediately diverted to Aden.|$|R
5000|$|Qaed Salim Sinan al-Harethi a.k.a. Abu Ali al-Harithi (Arabic: [...] أبو علي الحاريثي [...] ) (died November 3, 2002) was an Al-Qaeda {{operative}} and {{a citizen}} of Yemen who is suspected of having been involved in <b>the</b> October 2000 <b>USS</b> <b>Cole</b> bombing, and <b>the</b> October Limburg attack.|$|R
25|$|After {{the fall}} of the Taliban regime, many members of the Taliban {{resistance}} fled to the Northern border region of Afghanistan and Pakistan where the Pakistani army had previously little control. With the logistics and air support of the United States, the Pakistani Army captured or killed numerous al-Qaeda operatives such as Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, wanted for his involvement in <b>the</b> <b>USS</b> <b>Cole</b> bombing, the Bojinka plot, and the killing of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl.|$|E
25|$|Naval Station Norfolk is homeport for the , {{which was}} the victim of an Al-Qaeda {{terrorist}} attack in October 2000 while it was harbored and being refueled in the port of Aden, Yemen. 17 American sailors were killed, and 39 were injured in the attack, which was later revealed to have been a dress rehearsal for future terror attacks by the group in the United States. <b>The</b> <b>USS</b> <b>Cole</b> remains in active service and remains homeported at Norfolk.|$|E
25|$|While the CIA {{insists that}} those who {{conducted}} the attacks on 9/11 were not aware that the agency was operating at 7 World Trade Center {{under the guise of}} another (unidentified) federal agency, this center was the headquarters for many notable criminal terrorism investigations. Though the New York field offices' main responsibilities were to monitor and recruit foreign officials stationed at the United Nations, the field office also handled the investigations of the August 1998 bombings of United States Embassies in East Africa and the October 2000 bombing of <b>the</b> <b>USS</b> <b>Cole.</b> Despite the fact that the CIA's New York branch may have been damaged by the 9/11 attacks and they had to loan office space from the US Mission to the United Nations and other federal agencies, there was an upside for the CIA. In the months immediately following 9/11, there was a huge increase in the amount of applications for CIA positions. According to CIA representatives that spoke with The New York Times, pre-9/11 the agency received approximately 500 to 600 applications a week, in the months following 9/11 the agency received that number daily.|$|E
50|$|After the 1993 World Trade Center bombing took place, his {{research}} area changed to terrorist attacks. In {{the following years}} he was involved with the research of the 1998 United States embassy bombings in Tanzania and Kenya, <b>the</b> 2000 <b>USS</b> <b>Cole</b> bombing in Aden, Yemen, and the destructive attacks of September 11, 2001, on the World Trade Center and The Pentagon. In course of the years he therefore became an expert on al-Qaeda.|$|R
5000|$|Some of the {{students}} at the university have been accused of ties to terrorism. The Summary of Evidence memo prepared for Tawfiq bin Attash's Combatant Status Review Tribunal stated: The detainee's University of Islamic Studies identification card was found at an alleged al Qaida residence in Karachi, Pakistan." [...] Tawfiq bin Attash is alleged to {{have been one of the}} key players in the 1998 East Africa Embassy bombings and <b>the</b> 2000 <b>USS</b> <b>Cole</b> bombing.|$|R
25|$|On 3 February 2006, 23 {{suspected}} or convicted Al-Qaeda members {{escaped from}} jail in Yemen. This number included 13 who {{were convicted of}} <b>the</b> bombings of <b>USS</b> <b>Cole</b> and <b>the</b> French tanker Limburg in 2002. Among those who reportedly escaped was Al-Badawi. Al-Qaeda's Yemeni number two Abu Assem al-Ahdal may also have escaped.|$|R
500|$|In Malaysia, {{the group}} stayed with Yazid Sufaat, a local Jemaah Islamiyah member, who {{provided}} accommodation at Hambali's request. [...] Both Mihdhar and Hazmi were secretly photographed {{at the meeting}} by Malaysian authorities, whom the CIA had asked to provide surveillance. [...] The Malaysians reported that Mihdhar spoke at length with Attash, and he met with Fahd al-Quso and others who were later involved in <b>the</b> <b>USS</b> <b>Cole</b> bombing. [...] After the meeting, Mihdhar and Hazmi traveled to Bangkok, Thailand on January 8 and left a week later on January 15 for the United States.|$|E
500|$|After the attacks, the {{identification}} of Mihdhar {{was one of the}} first links suggesting that Bin Laden had played a role in their organization, since Mihdhar had been seen at the Malaysian conference speaking to Bin Laden's associates. [...] The FBI interrogated Quso, who was arrested following <b>the</b> <b>USS</b> <b>Cole</b> bombing and in custody in Yemen. [...] Quso was able to identify Mihdhar, Hazmi and Attash in photos provided by the FBI, and he also knew Marwan al-Shehhi, a hijacker aboard United Airlines Flight 175. [...] From Quso, the FBI was able to establish an al-Qaeda link to the attacks.|$|E
500|$|Mihdhar and Hazmi {{moved out}} of the Parkwood Apartments at the end of May 2000, and Mihdhar {{transferred}} registration for the Toyota Corolla to Hazmi. [...] On June 10, 2000, Mihdhar left the United States and returned to Yemen to visit his wife, against the wishes of Mohammed who wanted him to remain in the United States to help Hazmi adapt. [...] Mohammed was so angered by this that he decided to remove Mihdhar from the 9/11 plot, but he was overruled by Bin Laden. Mihdhar remained part of the plot as a muscle hijacker, who would help take over the aircraft. [...] On October 12, 2000, <b>the</b> <b>USS</b> <b>Cole</b> was bombed by a small boat laden with explosives. After the bombing, Yemeni Prime Minister Abdul Karim al-Iryani reported that Mihdhar {{had been one of the}} key planners of the attack and had been in the country at the time of the attacks. [...] In late 2000, Mihdhar was back in Saudi Arabia, staying with a cousin in Mecca.|$|E
25|$|On October 12, 2000, al-Qaeda {{militants in}} Yemen bombed <b>the</b> missile {{destroyer}} <b>USS</b> <b>Cole</b> in a suicide attack, killing 17 U.S. servicemen and damaging the vessel while it lay offshore. Inspired {{by the success}} of such a brazen attack, al-Qaeda's command core began to prepare for an attack on the U.S. itself.|$|R
5000|$|In December 2005, Saleh {{stated in}} a nationally {{televised}} broadcast that only his personal intervention had preempted a U.S. occupation of the southern port of Aden after <b>the</b> 2000 <b>USS</b> <b>Cole</b> bombing, stating [...] "By chance, I happened to be down there. If I hadn't been, Aden would have been occupied as there were eight U.S. warships {{at the entrance to}} the port." [...] However, transcripts from the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee state that no other warships were in the vicinity at the time.|$|R
2500|$|Both the Clinton Administration and the Bush Administration {{have been}} criticized for failing to respond militarily to <b>the</b> attack on <b>USS</b> <b>Cole</b> before 11 September 2001.

500|$|On 8 March, Thomas {{was interviewed}} again by {{two members of}} the AFP, who had made special {{arrangements}} with the Pakistani Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) to have the interview conducted pursuant to Australian law, particularly the requirements of the federal Evidence Act 1995 and Crimes Act 1914, so that admissible evidence could be gathered. ISI allowed the interview, but with a very limited timeframe, and did not allow Thomas to have access to legal advice. During this interview, Thomas made several self-incriminatory statements, which were key to his later convictions and the admissibility of which was the central issue in the appeal. In the statements, Thomas admitted that he had tampered with his passport to conceal the amount of time he had been in Pakistan, and also admitted that the money and airline ticket had been given to him by Tawfiq bin Attash, a high ranking Al Qaeda lieutenant involved with the 1998 United States embassy bombings and <b>the</b> <b>USS</b> <b>Cole</b> bombing. On 10 March, the AFP wrote again to the ISI, reiterating the requirements of the Australian legislation, and saying that [...] "the admissibility of [...] in Australian Courts has been seriously compromised." ...|$|E
