5|$|After {{his release}} from Bradford, Brandon spent {{a period of time}} {{training}} with Scottish-side Dundee United, although <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> he was visiting his friend and former teammate Danny Cadamarteri and would not be offered a contract, before he was offered a trial with Port Vale in July 2010. It proved to be an unsuccessful trial, with Brandon spending time away from the game. He later held talks with Conference North side Guiseley, a non-league team from near Bradford. At the start of 2011, he signed for Thai Premier League side BEC Tero Sasana.|$|E
5|$|At first, the dissenting deputies {{were often}} {{convinced}} or cowed back to withdraw their objections. Also, at first, the rule {{was used to}} strike down only individual laws, not to dissolve the chamber and throw out all measures passed. For example, as historian Władysław Czapliński describes in the Sejm of 1611 context, some resolutions were struck down, but others passed. From the mid-17th century onward, however, an objection to any item of Sejm legislation from a deputy or senator automatically caused other, earlier adopted legislation to be rejected. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> all legislation that was adopted by a given Sejm formed a whole.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the need}} for an {{improved}} CSBS was known in the 1930s, little work on developing such a sight was carried out. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> an entirely new class of tachometric bombsights were being developed, which offered dramatically improved accuracy and automated much of the setup. The RAF was working on the Automatic Bomb Sight along these lines but development was slow and it had not been accepted for use when the war started. Hearing of a similar development by the US Navy, the Air Ministry began extensive negotiations in an effort to gain a licence for the Norden bombsight. The Navy constantly refused these requests, based on arguments about secrecy and various political issues. As the war started, revised versions of the CSBS, the Mk. VII and Mk. IX remained universal and the Mk. X, a more extensive improvement, was in mass production and being readied for service entry.|$|E

25|$|By 1886-1888 {{the locks}} were {{in bad shape}} {{and in need of}} repair or rebuilding.

25|$|Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann {{were able}} to do this by {{exceptionally}} good chemistry, fantastically good chemistry, which was way ahead of what any one else was capable of at that time.

25|$|However, by {{the time}} the Americans arrived and checked at Subig on April 30, they found no Spanish ships there. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> Montojo had judged to {{position}} to be indefensible because they did not finish installing the naval guns on the ground at the entrance to Subig, being behind schedule—though according to American scouts, the guns were lying on the beach and could have been mounted in less than 24 hours. In addition, the wooden cruiser Castilla was having technical problems. Thus a council of squadron captains decided to return to Manila Bay. Reportedly, another factor in Admiral Montojo's decision was {{that they would not be}} able to save Spanish sailors in the depth of forty meters of water at Subig, something which American naval officers found astounding. Thus the American squadron leader, Admiral George Dewey, and his other officers initially had a low opinion of the Spanish commander's abilities.|$|E
25|$|The DD {{class is}} notable {{for being the}} last class of {{locomotive}} to be built by Ballarat's Phoenix Foundry, which had been the main supplier of locomotives to the VR for over thirty years, and the first locomotive class to be constructed in large numbers by VR's own newly built Newport Workshops. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> the conservative Irvine government sought to reduce the costs of locomotive construction, and Newport Workshops was asked to tender {{for the construction of}} the DD class locomotives. A fierce tender war between Newport and Phoenix eventually resulted in a Royal Commission, which found that Newport could produce a locomotive for £3,364, some £497 cheaper than the Phoenix Foundry. Phoenix produced just seven DD locomotives and received no further orders, going into voluntary liquidation a year later. VR's Newport, Ballarat and Bendigo workshops went on to build virtually all subsequent locomotives for the Victorian railway system until the post-war era.|$|E
500|$|Before the {{qualifier}} with Poland at Wembley Stadium, Brian Clough described Polish goalkeeper Jan Tomaszewski as a [...] "circus clown in gloves". Errors by Norman Hunter and goalkeeper Peter Shilton and {{an inspired}} goalkeeping performance by Tomaszewski, who made many crucial saves, {{meant that the}} match finished 1–1. Ramsey, always uncomfortable with the substitute rule, was blamed for waiting until the 85th minute before bringing on forward, Kevin Hector. [...] The draw meant that England had {{tried and failed to}} qualify for a World Cup {{for the first time in}} the national team's history (England did not compete in the three pre-War World Cups, but <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> of a boycott of FIFA by the English FA).|$|E

500|$|When, in 1946, Isma'il al-Azhari of the Sudanese al-Ashiqqa party began seeking {{support for}} {{unification}} of the Nile Valley, Abd al-Rahman was strongly {{opposed to any}} hint that the king of Egypt might have authority of any kind in Sudan. He and his followers set up an [...] "Independence Front" [...] and organized huge demonstrations throughout Sudan against the draft Anglo-Egyptian agreement on Sudan. In November 1946, Abd al-Rahman left with a delegation for London via Cairo. Completely ignored by the Egyptian government in Cairo, he talked with British Prime Minister Clement Attlee for two hours in London. When Attlee asked why the Sudanese had not spoken up while Egypt pressed its claims over Sudan for the last seventy years, Abd al-Rahman said <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> the British had excluded them from any talks. He {{went on to say}} the Sudanese would fight with all their power for independence.|$|E
500|$|... "The Pandorica Opens" [...] {{received}} positive reviews. Dan Martin of The Guardian {{praised the}} cinematic scope and cliffhanger, calling it [...] "the most audacious of showstoppers". He thought {{that so much}} happened in the episode that Rory's return felt like [...] "a minor plot point", though he considered <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> the audience {{knew it was going}} to happen. Gavin Fuller, writing for The Daily Telegraph, praising it for bringing an [...] "epic, cinematic tale to stick in the memory" [...] that the series had [...] "arguably lacked", though he thought the assembly of the Alliance was [...] "rather fanboyish on Moffat's part". He also praised Smith for [...] "hit the right note" [...] and the revelations at the end for being [...] "genuinely shocking". Like Martin, he said that Rory's return was [...] "unsurprising", though [...] "well-handled" [...] and with some touching moments between him and Amy.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written and {{directed}} by series creator Rob Thomas, marking his seventh writing credit and second and final directing credit for the series (after [...] "Donut Run"). Starting with this episode, Thomas and the crew's plan for the season changed—while they had initially scheduled three major story arcs for the season, this number was now bumped down to two, while the last few episodes would be standalone. The creative team decided that their choices for major mysteries had not worked since season one; Thomas elaborated, [...] "One feeling is that the big mysteries keep away the casual TV viewers, and the other is the thing that has been the least successful since season one [...] the big mysteries." [...] Thomas also recalled that his major design for the first season <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> Lilly had been murdered, everyone had a stake in the solving of the mystery and that the crew were finding it impossible to keep the same amount of emotional involvement since the first season; Thomas thought that the new format would be a way of trying to return to a more emotionally driven format.|$|E

500|$|Even before Sestak {{formally}} {{declared his}} candidacy on August 4, 2009, Specter and Sestak began exchanging criticisms {{about each other}} that were so heated, The New York Times writer Janie Lorber suggested [...] "the contest will {{become one of the}} more vicious for next year's midterm elections". Sestak repeatedly said Specter was not a [...] "real Democrat" [...] and continued to assert Specter's switch was based on self-preservation rather than principles. Specter called Sestak a [...] "flagrant hypocrite" [...] for questioning Specter's loyalty to the Democratic Party, citing the fact that Sestak himself was registered as an Independent until he became a Democrat in 2006, just before he ran for Congress. Sestak claimed <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> he was serving in the military and wished to be nonpartisan, but Specter called that a [...] "lame excuse for avoiding party affiliation ... undercut by his documented disinterest in the political process", pointing out that records indicated Sestak voted in only 12 out of 35 elections from 1971 to 2005. A day after Sestak formally entered the race, Specter described Sestak's recent 67-county tour as a [...] "taxpayer-financed self-promotion tour around the state". Specter's campaign also accused Sestak of neglecting his duties in the House and missing more than 100 votes in the last year, which Specter called the worst attendance record for any Pennsylvania Congressman. Sestak responded to the latter point that most of the missed votes were procedural in nature, and were missed because of the statewide tour and because he visited his father, who was dying at the time. Sestak accused Specter of launching a [...] "GOP negative style campaign", which Specter denied.|$|E

The Apalachee expanded the superstitions to include Christian elements; after losing two games in a row, one village decided <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> their mission church was closed during the games.
