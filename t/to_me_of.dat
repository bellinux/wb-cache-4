25|$|It will {{be borne}} {{in mind that}} the Liberal doctrines of that time, with their violent anti-socialist spirit and their strong insistence on the gospel of thrift, self-help, {{settlement}} of wages by the higgling of the market, and non-interference by the State.... I think that Mr. Gladstone was the strongest anti-socialist that I have ever known among persons who gave any serious thought to social and political questions. It is quite true, as has been often said, that “we are all socialists up to a certain point”; but Mr. Gladstone fixed that point lower, and was more vehement against those who went above it, than any other politician or official of my acquaintance. I remember his speaking indignantly <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> the budget of 1874 as “That socialistic budget of Northcote's,” merely because of the special relief which it gave to the poorer class of income-tax payers. His strong belief in Free Trade was only one of the results of his deep-rooted conviction that the Government's interference with the free action of the individual, whether by taxation or otherwise, should be kept at an irreducible minimum. It is, indeed, not too much to say that his conception of Liberalism was the negation of Socialism.|$|E

500|$|In {{a speech}} to the Labour Friends of Israel in April 2007, Brownwhose father was the {{chairman}} of the Church of Scotland's Israel Committee spoke of his long-standing interest in Israel and the Jewish community. He said that he [...] "had a very clear view from household slides and projectors about the history of Israel, about the trials and tribulations of the Jewish people, about the enormous suffering and loss during the Holocaust, as well as the extraordinary struggle that he described <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> people to create this magnificent homeland".|$|E

500|$|According to {{academic}} Robin Ellen Visel, Rosa {{is a complicated}} person, with roles thrust on her by her parents, which suppresses her own goals and desires. Gordimer explained how she constructed the book's narrative structure to convey this struggle and explain Rosa: [...] "he idea came <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> Rosa questioning herself as others see her and whether what they see is what she really is. And that developed into another stylistic question—if you're {{going to tell the}} book in the first person, to whom are you talking?" [...] This led to Gordimer creating Conrad and Katya for Rosa to use as sounding boards to question and explain herself.|$|E
500|$|In The Musical Times Edwin Evans praised Tippett's text: [...] "simple {{and direct}} ... he has wisely {{resisted}} any temptation to use quasi-biblical or 'Pilgrim's Progress' language." [...] Evans was uncertain whether {{the music was}} truly reflective of the words: [...] "...the emotion seemed singularly cool under the provocations described in the text". Unlike Glock, Evans was unconvinced by {{the case for the}} inclusion of the spirituals: [...] "he peculiar poignancy they have in their traditional form tends to evaporate in their new environment". [...] Eric Blom, in Music & Letters, thought the idea of using spirituals [...] "brilliant", and the analogy with Bach's chorales convincing. Blom was less enthusiastic about the text, which he found [...] "very terse and bald – rather poor, really"—though he thought this [...] preferable to the pomposities such as those that [...] characterise libretti written for Handel. In his autobiography, Tippett makes only [...] muted references to the premiere, noting that the event [...] "had some mixed reviews", but {{in a letter to his}} friend Francesca Allinson he professed himself delighted [...] with the breadth of response to the work: [...] "It's got over not only to the ordinary listeners but even to the intellectuals like [...] Seiber, who has written <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> some of the 'lovely texture of some of the numbers'".|$|E
500|$|The British {{entry into}} the {{maritime}} fur trade dates to 1778 and the third voyage of Captain James Cook. While sailing north {{to search for the}} fabled Northwest Passage, Cook discovered the Hawaiian Islands. On the Northwest Coast, he spent a month in Nootka Sound, during which he and his crew traded with the Nuu-chah-nulth from the village of Yuquot. They ended up with over 300 furs, mostly sea otter, but thought them of no great value. Later, after Cook had been killed in Hawaii, the expedition visited Canton and were surprised by how much money the Chinese were willing to pay for the furs. A profit of 1,800% was made. James King, one of the commanders after Cook's death, wrote, [...] "the advantages that might be derived from a voyage to that part of the American coast, undertaken with commercial views, appear <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> a degree of importance sufficient to call for the attention of the public." [...] The crews of the two ships were so eager to return to Nootka Sound and acquire more furs, they were [...] "not far short of mutiny". Nevertheless, they sailed for England, arriving there in October 1780. Accounts of Cook's voyage and the sea otter trade were published in the 1780s, triggering a rush of entrepreneurial voyages to the Northwest Coast.|$|E

500|$|... "Witch Doctor" [...] {{is based}} on a true story where Tinie met a girl at a show who he took with him on the tour bus and showed what it's like to live his life. [...] "It's OK" [...] and [...] "Lover Not a Fighter" [...] are two songs that feature vocals and {{production}} from Labrinth. [...] "It's OK" [...] is a contrast from the [...] "intro and fun, random bouncy things" [...] according to Okogwu. He added [...] "it's very unorthodox in the sense that people wouldn't have heard or even expect us to make a song like this because it's very slow and ballad-y. It's very reminiscent <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> the Fugees or something because it just sounds different and very soulful as well." [...] He wrote the song in Jamaica and wanted it to feel rustic and urban. Tinie wanted to [...] "push the envelope" [...] with what you're used to hearing from him and Labrinth. [...] "Lover Not a Fighter" [...] is a feel-good, radio-friendly song that incorporates hip hop and electronic music, along with rap rock, and is about good vibes and [...] "doing your thing". [...] "I'm a lover, not a fighter. I've just come to do my thing and enjoy myself so don't try and get on to me about it or try and make me feel bad about everything that's going on in my life", said Tinie to SB.TV.|$|E

2500|$|In other communications, {{officials}} used {{an ethnic}} pejorative {{to refer to}} the Fort Lee mayor. In an e-mail from Wildstein responding to Bill Stepien, he said [...] "It will be a tough November for this little Serbian", derogatorily referring to Sokolich, who is Croatian-American. Baroni referred to [...] "Serbia" [...] in text messages in another apparent reference to Mayor Sokolich. Sokolich told The Huffington Post: [...] "That slight is offensive to me, and it's offensive <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> everyone of Serbian background. If I were Serbian, I would be absolutely, positively appalled by it." [...] The Serbian remarks received the attention of Serbian and Croatian media, and was commented upon by the Serbian government's Office for Cooperation with the Diaspora and Serbs in the Region.|$|E

2500|$|On 25 November, Gyulay {{accompanied}} Johann Philipp Stadion, Count von Warthausen on {{a mission}} to negotiate a treaty with Emperor Napoleon I of France. During the talks Gyulay demanded that France compensate Austria for the loss of Venetia. A frustrated Napoleon wrote to Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord that Gyulay, [...] "talked <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> the Teutonic Order, of the Diet in Ratisbonne, and I don't know what else". Though the discussions continued with Talleyrand, Napoleon became more focused on defeating his enemies and nothing came out of the peace talks. After the disaster at the Battle of Austerlitz, at which Gyulay was not present, he and Johann I Josef, Prince of Liechtenstein negotiated the Peace of Pressburg with the First French Empire. Emperor Francis II appointed Gyulay the Ban of Croatia in 1806, a position he held throughout his lifetime.|$|E

2500|$|When Kahlo was {{six years}} old, she {{contracted}} polio, which made her right leg shorter and thinner than the left. The illness forced her to be isolated from her peers for months, and she was bullied. While the experience made her introverted, it also made her Guillermo's favorite due to their shared experience of living with disability. Kahlo credited him for making her childhood [...] "marvellous ... he was an immense example <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> tenderness, of work (photographer and also painter), and above all in understanding for all my problems". He taught her about literature, nature, and philosophy, and encouraged her to play sports to regain her strength, {{despite the fact that}} most physical exercise was seen as unsuitable for girls. He also taught her photography, and she began helping him retouch, develop, and color photographs.|$|E

2500|$|Early on, his {{temperament}} {{affected his}} performance in the court. For example, he deemed John Clarke, another Wilson appointee to the court, to be [...] "too liberal" [...] and refused to speak with him. Clarke made an early decision to leave the Court, and McReynolds's antipathy was a factor given by Clarke. However, another possible reason was his hope of an appointment by President Wilson as his representative to the nascent League of Nations, and writing to the President that {{he felt it was}} his [...] "duty to devote what might remain <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> life and health and strength to doing what I could to cultivate public opinion in our country to having our government take some share in the effort which many other nations are making to devise some rational substitute for irrational war". Indeed, McReynolds refused to sign the customary joint memorial letter given to departing members. In a letter, Taft commented that [...] "his is a fair sample of McReynolds's personal character and the difficulty of getting along with him." ...|$|E
2500|$|The film {{score by}} John Williams was {{recorded}} in late March and early April 2011. Tuba player Jim Self reported in May 2011: [...] "For John Williams I [...] recently finished recording for the film War Horse. It's a war movie so the score {{has a lot of}} brass—but it was gentle music often." [...] English folk singer John Tams, who wrote the songs for the stage production of War Horse, was approached by Spielberg and Williams about including one of his songs from the stageshow in the film. In the liner notes to the film soundtrack cd, Spielberg wrote [...] "I feel that John has made a special gift <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> this music, which was inspired not only by my film but also by many of the picturesque settings of the poet William Wordsworth, whose vivid descriptions of the British landscape inspired much of {{what you are going to}} hear."
