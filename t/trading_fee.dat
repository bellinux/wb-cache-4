40|$|Abstract: Previous {{research}} on the Viking Age trade centre of Birka has suggested the parallel use of two harmonising standard weight units, differing in mass by five percent. As an explanation to this phenomenon, this paper puts forward a hypothesis of a <b>trading</b> <b>fee,</b> embedded in the weights. This is corroborated through a hypothetical deductive study; including a reassertion of earlier results {{by means of a}} new method for archaeometrological analysis, using a 3 D scanner and Computer-Aided Design. Further, the role of silver, as a preferred unit of payment in Birka, is supported through a spatial analysis of the distribution of Islamic coins and Oriental beads in the provinces of Middle Sweden. Plausible manufacturing sites for the cylindrical lead weights, adhering to the Birka mitqal, are discussed as a possible way of falsifying the hypothesis. The results suggest that a <b>trading</b> <b>fee</b> was extracted, using the Birka mitqal for imports and the Islamic mitqal for exports. The metrological analysis was also expanded to weights from Sigtuna, which proved the Birka mitqal, as well the dual metrics system, continued to be in use there until, at least, {{the first half of the}} 11 th century. Finally, a short study on the origins of the Scandinavian/Islamic weight system suggests that the direct influence for the system primarily can be attributed the Volga-Bulgarians...|$|E
30|$|Competition between {{trading venues}} also {{pressures}} the exchanges {{to upgrade their}} trading facilities, {{as well as to}} provide services and cut stamp duties for changing securities ownership. For example, ASX recently upgraded its trading technology and launched its own low latency platform, PureMatch, to compete directly with Chi-X (Comerton-Forde 2012). In addition, ASX enhanced its co-location facilities, but it no longer offers transaction rebates for large participants or large volumes (Australian Securities Exchange 2010). Competition among exchanges has also brought with it lower <b>trading</b> <b>fees.</b> This is demonstrated by ASX’s reduction of its <b>trading</b> <b>fees</b> from 0.28 basis points (bps) down to 0.15  bps. Meanwhile, Chi-X also launched a maker-taker pricing model (Mishkin 2011). This has resulted in differential fees being charged to trading firms depending on whether they provide or demand liquidity. These changes make Australia a more attractive place for HFT traders to operate.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model to}} analyze the consequences of competition in order-flow between a profit maximizing stock exchange and an alternative trading platform on the decisions concerning <b>trading</b> <b>fees</b> and listing requirements. Listing requirements, set by the exchange, provide public information on listed firms and contribute to a better liquidity on all trading venues. It is sometimes asserted that competition induces the exchange to lower its level of listing standards compared to {{a situation in which}} it is a monopolist, because the trading platform can free-ride on this regulatory activity and compete more aggressively on <b>trading</b> <b>fees.</b> The present analysis shows that this is not always true and depends on the existence and size of gains related to multi market trading. These gains relax competition on <b>trading</b> <b>fees.</b> The higher these gains are, the more the exchange can increase its revenue from listing and trading when it raises its listing standards. For large enough gains from multi-market trading, the exchange is not induced to lower the level of listing standards when a competing trading platform appears. As a second result, this analysis also reveals a cross - subsidization effect between the listing and the trading activity when listing is not competitive. This model yields implications about the fee structures on stock markets, the regulation of listings and the social optimality of competition for volume. competition in order flow, fragmentation, listing requirements, stock exchanges...|$|R

We implement a financial market with sequential trading and transaction costs in the laboratory.

We find that, in the experiment, informational no-trade cascades occur when theory predicts they should (i. e., when the trade imbalance is sufficiently high). At the same time, the proportion of subjects irrationally trading against their private information is smaller than in a financial market without transaction costs.

40|$|Cahier de {{recherche}} HEC - n° 920 We {{develop a}} model of trading in securities markets with two specialized sides: traders posting quotes ("market makers") and traders hitting quotes ("market takers").

40|$|I {{propose a}} model in which a stock {{exchange}} can improve its liquidity by tightening its listing requirements. Because these reduce information asymmetry, they increase the utility of investors and {{lead to a high}} investor participation on the exchange. However, the exchange never sets the highest possible level of listing requirements because investors also incur a risk due to more transparency. Their utility is concave in the level of listing requirements. This property determines the optimal decisions of an exchange as well as the social optimum. The level of listing requirements maximizing investor welfare depends on the sensitivity of the utility of investors to changes in liquidity and varies with the organization of listing and trading. A monopolist exchange always under-regulates if regulation is costly. Under- regulation is exacerbated if other trading venues free ride on the regulation and if the <b>trading</b> <b>fee</b> is determined by the level of listing requirements. While investors are better off if trading is separated from listing and is a competitive industry, an exchange has a higher profit when it is a monopolist in listing and trading.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{collection}} of three individual works on dynamic economic decision problems which go beyond expected utility maximisation in complete markets. The first chapter introduces an asset liquidation model under prospect theory preferences. We demonstrate that the probability weighting component of the model can predict liquidation strategies which better fit the empirical patterns of investors’ stock trading behaviours, when compared to models which do not incorporate probability weighting. The second chapter explores the role of randomised strategies in an exit-timing problem faced by a prospect theory agent. Several new insights are offered: in a discrete model, access to randomisation can strictly improve the economic value to the agent; in a continuous time counterpart, allowing randomisation will significantly alter the prediction of an agent’s behaviours and more realistic exit-strategies would be observed in contrast to the results from the existing literature. The final chapter studies an extension to the Merton’s optimal investment and consumption problem under transaction costs, where the agent can also dynamically invest in a liquid hedging asset without a <b>trading</b> <b>fee.</b> We provide a complete solution. Important properties of the problem such as well-posedness conditions and comparative static results are derived...|$|E
