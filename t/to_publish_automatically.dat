40|$|There are {{different}} {{problems associated with}} a static website, such as management and content update. To address these problems, one alternative is to use Content Management System (CMS), such as WordPress. This project describes the process of migrating a static website to WordPress and adding six additional functionalities according to requirements from a company. In the meantime, theme is used to customize the website based on company’s requirements; specific WordPress plugins and widgets are used to implement additional requirements, including submenus, user registration and login, content update, Facebook and Twitter integration, and RSS support for the new content. Besides, solutions are given to resolve problems, such as the conflict with Internet Explorer (IE) and WordPress security issues. The outcome of this work allows the company to use WordPress to manage the website, <b>to</b> <b>publish</b> <b>automatically</b> new content into online social networking services, to provide customized information to registered users {{as well as to}} allow web syndication.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} the Markov decision process extraction network, {{which is a}} data-efficient, automatic state estimation approach for discrete-time reinforcement learning (RL) based on recurrent neural networks. The architecture is designed to model the minimal relevant dynamics of an environment, capable of condensing large sets of continuous observables to a compact state representation and excluding irrelevant information. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, it is the first approach <b>published</b> <b>to</b> <b>automatically</b> extract minimal relevant aspects of the dynamics from observations to model a Markov decision process, suitable for RL, without requiring special knowledge of the regarded environment. The capabilities of the neural state estimation approach are evaluated using the cart-pole problem and standard table-based policy iteration. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The latest {{issues in}} {{simulating}} and analyzing differ-ent Earth Science phenomena require {{the development of}} complex algorithms, based on satellite images in different formats. The main goal {{of this paper is}} to process these data in a standard manner and <b>to</b> <b>automatically</b> <b>publish</b> the execution results by using the latest Web Processing Services (WPS). The development of these services needs to be slightly different when involving large volume of data processed over the Grid infrastructure opposed to standalone machines. This paper provides an implementation so-lution of the WPS standard within the GreenLand platform, and exemplifies it on the Black Sea catchment hydrologic modeling use case. I...|$|R

40|$|Information {{sources such}} as {{relational}} databases, spreadsheets, XML, JSON, and Web APIs contain {{a tremendous amount of}} structured data that can be leveraged to build and augment knowledge graphs. However, they rarely provide a semantic model to describe their contents. Semantic models of data sources represent the implicit meaning of the data by specifying the concepts and the relationships within the data. Such models are the key ingredients <b>to</b> <b>automatically</b> <b>publish</b> the data into knowledge graphs. Manually modeling the semantics of data sources requires significant effort and expertise, and although desirable, building these models automatically is a challenging problem. Most of the related work focuses on semantic annotation of the data fields (source attributes). However, constructing a semantic model that explicitly describes the relationships between the attributes in addition to their semantic types is critical. We present a novel approach that exploits the knowledge from a domain ontology and the semantic models of previously modeled sources to automatically learn a rich semantic model for a new source. This model represents the semantics of the new source in terms of the concepts and relationships defined by the domain ontology. Given some sample data from the new source, we leverage the knowledge in the domain ontology and the known semantic models to construct a weighted graph that represents the space of plausible semantic models for the new source. Then, we compute the top k candidate semantic models and suggest to the user a ranked list of the semantic models for the new source. The approach takes into account user corrections to learn more accurate semantic models on future data sources. Our evaluation shows that our method generates expressive semantic models for data sources and services with minimal user input. [...] .

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to know whether brand image, {{motivation}} <b>to</b> <b>publish</b> manuscript, affiliation with School of Medicine, Gadjah Mada University, and prior publication experience in journals of the School of Medicine influenced the interest <b>to</b> <b>publish</b> in those journals. The higher the numbers of respondents showing interest <b>to</b> <b>publish</b> in the journals, the better are chances to select high quality manuscripts with potentially more citations and broader readership. A sample survey was conducted involving 120 respondents, who may send their manuscripts to the journals. Questionaires for data collection were adapted from Shukla (2010) to measure the interest <b>to</b> <b>publish</b> manuscript, from Sondoh et al. (2007) for perception on brand image, and from Miller and Bedeian (2010) for motivation <b>to</b> <b>publish.</b> The questionaires were distributed to respondents and selfadministered before being handed to the researcher. Results of the study suggest that perception on brand image is the strongest predictor of interest <b>to</b> <b>publish</b> manuscripts in journals catered by the School of Medicine, Gadjah Mada University. Motivation <b>to</b> <b>publish</b> only weakly predicts interest <b>to</b> <b>publish,</b> and is not significant statistically. Affiliation and prior publication do not seem to be associated with interest <b>to</b> <b>publish.</b> Efforts <b>to</b> improve brand awareness, recognition, and perceived associations with positive attributes of the journals would increase manuscript submission, citations and readership among loyal readers and writers. Brand image is a useful feature in marketing theories which can be applied in the improvement of manuscript submission to academic journals...|$|R
