5|$|Goodman is {{best remembered}} today for having created the Order of <b>the</b> <b>Arrow</b> (OA), a popular and highly {{successful}} {{program of the}} BSA that continues to honor Scouts for their cheerful service. Since its founding in 1915, the Order of <b>the</b> <b>Arrow</b> has grown to become a nationwide program having thousands of members, which recognizes those Scouts who best exemplify the virtues of cheerful service, camping, and leadership by membership in BSA's honor society. As of 2007, the Order of <b>the</b> <b>Arrow</b> has more than 183,000 members.|$|E
5|$|A replica Arrow {{built by}} Allan Jackson {{was used in}} <b>The</b> <b>Arrow,</b> a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) production. He began {{building}} a full-scale replica of <b>the</b> <b>Arrow</b> in 1989, and was approached by the producers of <b>the</b> <b>Arrow</b> miniseries in 1996, then about 70% complete, who made an offer to complete the construction if the replica {{could be used for}} the production. It was used on the miniseries and several public appearances at air shows. The replica was later donated to the Reynolds-Alberta Museum in his home town of Wetaskiwin, Alberta. While in a temporary outdoor collection, it was damaged in a wind storm in 2009. It has since been repaired, but is no longer on public display.|$|E
5|$|Arrowmen are {{identified}} {{by a white}} sash bearing a red arrow that is worn over their right shoulder. An Ordeal member wears a sash with a lone arrow. The Brotherhood member wears a sash bearing an arrow with a red bar {{at each end of}} <b>the</b> <b>arrow.</b> A Vigil Honor member wears a sash with the same bars of as the Brotherhood sash at each end of <b>the</b> <b>arrow,</b> and a Vigil Honor triangle on the center of the shaft. Members wear the sash at Order of <b>the</b> <b>Arrow</b> functions and special Scouting activities when members need to be identified as Arrowmen rendering special services. The OA sash is not worn {{at the same time as}} the merit badge sash, nor worn folded in the belt. The sash as a form of recognition dates to the founding of the Order and has a long history of changes in usage and design.|$|E

5|$|Procurement of <b>the</b> <b>Arrow</b> from Canada, {{and setting}} up a {{production}} line in the UK, was studied, the unit price per aircraft built in the UK being estimated at £220,000 each for a production run of 100 aircraft, {{as opposed to the}} estimate of £150,000 per aircraft for the thin wing Javelin. The CF-105 would serve as a stopgap until the UK's F.155 project came to fruition; however with the F.155 due in 1963 and <b>the</b> <b>Arrow</b> not likely to reach the RAF before 1962, there was little point in proceeding.|$|E

5|$|The Vigil Honor is a {{recognition}} given to Arrowmen for distinguished contributions {{beyond the immediate}} responsibilities of their position or office to their lodge, the Order of <b>the</b> <b>Arrow,</b> Scouting, or their Scout Camp. The Vigil Honor may be conferred upon Arrowmen who have completed {{a minimum of two}} years as a Brotherhood member and have performed exceptional service above and beyond their immediate responsibilities through leadership, exemplary efforts, and dedication. However, under no circumstances should tenure in Scouting or the Order of <b>the</b> <b>Arrow</b> be considered as reason enough for a Vigil Honor recommendation. Selection is annual and is limited to one person for every 50members of the lodge, and members of the Order can be inducted into the Vigil Honor only with the written approval of the National Order of <b>the</b> <b>Arrow</b> Committee.|$|E

5|$|Lovefilm (1970) {{focuses on}} a young man’s {{relationship}} with his childhood sweetheart, told through flashbacks that include <b>the</b> <b>Arrow</b> Cross dictatorship and 1956, and rendered in an experimental, fragmented form. This experimental tendency in Szabó’s films reached its apotheosis in 25 Fireman Street (1973), which began as a short film, Dream About a House (1971). 25 Fireman Street takes place {{during the course of}} a long, hot night in Budapest, during which the residents of a single apartment building are plagued by dream-memories of pain and loss spanning thirty years, including both World Wars, <b>the</b> <b>Arrow</b> Cross dictatorship, the Communist takeover, and 1956. While the film won the top prize at Locarno, Szabó was upset by its lack of success at the box office and at film festivals. Attributing this lack of success to the film's complex structure, he decided to give his next film a simpler structure.|$|E

While Valmiki's Ramayana narrates that the magical arrow {{was given to}} Rama by Indra, in other versions the magical arrow is hidden in Mandodari's bed chambers or under her bed. While Mandodari is engrossed in worshipping the goddess Parvati for Ravana's wellbeing, Hanuman comes to her disguised as a Brahmin. After winning her confidence, he tricks her into revealing the secret location of <b>the</b> <b>arrow.</b> Hanuman seizes <b>the</b> <b>arrow</b> and gives it to Rama, leading to Ravana's end. Mandodari appears at the death scene of Ravana in a disarrayed state and laments his death. In this battle, Mandodari loses her husband, her sons, and her kinsmen.|$|E
