25|$|De Gaulle {{initially}} reacted angrily to {{news of the}} Royal Navy’s {{attack on}} the French fleet (3 July); Pétain and others wrongly blamed him for provoking it by his 26 June speech (in fact it had been planned at least as early as 16 June). He considered withdrawing to Canada to live as a private citizen and waited five days before broadcasting. Spears called on de Gaulle on 5 July and found him “astonishingly objective” and acknowledging {{that it was the}} right <b>thing</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> British point of view. Spears reported to Churchill that de Gaulle had shown “a splendid dignity”. In his broadcast of 8 July he spoke of the “pain and anger” caused by the attack and that it was a “hateful tragedy not a glorious battle”, but that one day the enemy would have used the ships against England (sic) or the French Empire, and that the defeat of England would mean “bondage forever” for France. “Our two ancient nations … remain bound to one another. They will either go down both together or both together they will win”.|$|E
500|$|A few reviewers {{were pleased}} by the new {{friendship}} between Rory and Sam. Kubicek said it was [...] "officially my favorite <b>thing</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> entire third season of Glee", and Bell approved, though she said [...] "the writers don't know how to use" [...] Rory, and was disappointed that his brotherly relationship with Finn had [...] "fizzled". VanDerWerff singled out Rory's reading from the bible, which was, as Canning phrased it, [...] "ripped from A Charlie Brown Christmas" [...] when Linus reads the same passage, as one that [...] "irks" [...] him most, [...] "because it takes a perfectly beautiful little moment from a nearly perfect TV special" [...] and makes it a [...] "cutaway gag".|$|E
500|$|Howarth stated, [...] "I {{was happy}} to get the part of Todd, {{but it was the}} furthest <b>thing</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> fabric of my personality." [...] In an {{interview}} later that year, with Soap Opera Weekly, he grimaced when reminded of what he had said, and commented, [...] "What a totally self-involved, pretentious thing to say." [...] He clarified his previous statement, saying that although he seemed to be consistently cast as a [...] "bad guy" [...] and as a [...] "Greek frat brother-type", both his upbringing and experiences in college were different than those of Todd and his other roles. [...] For example, Howarth was not in a fraternity in college, and, unlike Todd and his previous soap opera roles, Kent in Loving and Jory on Guiding Light, status was unimportant to him.|$|E

500|$|Rumors persisted that Clark {{was forced}} out due to his {{contentious}} relationship with some in Washington, D.C.; however, he has dismissed such rumors, calling it a [...] "routine personnel action". The Department of Defense said it was merely a [...] "general rotation of American senior ranks". However, a NATO ambassador told the International Herald Tribune that Clark's dismissal {{seemed to be a}} [...] "political <b>thing</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> United States". General Hugh Shelton would say of Clark during his 2004 campaign that [...] "the reason he came out of Europe early had to do with integrity and character issues, things that are very near and dear to my heart. I'm not going to say whether I'm a Republican or a Democrat. I'll just say Wes won't get my vote." [...] Shelton never elaborated further on what these issues were.|$|E
500|$|After {{not being}} able to find a baby-sitter for Amy, Reagan {{suggests}} that the two throw a game night, an idea Chris doesn't react well to. They invite Ava, Kevin, Missy, but Chris attempts to hide the games due to Reagan's competitive nature. He tries to make her promise that she won't be too competitive, but she does which makes the party awkward. While playing Rock Band the two get in a fight when Chris loses the beat on the drums because he was looking at his [...] "drumming arm". Reagan decide to a make a list of [...] "Things We Are Going to Stop Doing That Embarrass Each Other in 2012", which features annoying habits that the two want each other to give up. However, before 2011 comes to an end the two erase every <b>thing</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> list except for Chris's Borat impression and Reagen's competitive nature.|$|E

And then there was a name change (to Tame Impala), and then a new drummer (Jay Watson) whose style was more elegant than the last drummer." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{year after}} the top 15 hit single success of [...] "Apollo 9", which reached no.13 in September 1984, the parent album Vive Le Rock was {{released}} in September 1985, to mixed reviews.

2500|$|On August 9, 2005, it was {{announced}} that British director Anand Tucker would take over from Weitz. Tucker felt the film would thematically be about Lyra [...] "looking for a family", and Pullman agreed: [...] "He has plenty of very good ideas, and he isn't daunted by the technical challenges. But the best <b>thing</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> point of view of all who care about the story is his awareness that it isn't about computer graphics; it isn't about fantastic adventures in amazing-looking worlds; it's about Lyra." [...] Tucker resigned on May 8, 2006, citing creative disagreements with New Line, and Weitz returned to direct. Weitz said [...] "I'm both the first and third director on the film..but I did a lot of growing in the interim." ...|$|E

[...] Following a warm up date in Puerto Banús, Spain on 23 August 1985, a seventeen date UK Vive Le Rock tour was scheduled to start in Southampton on 10 September 1985, however due to insurance problems relating to the stage set (which included a particularly rickety bridge) and/or poor ticket sales, this was reduced to three dates – 25 September 1985 in London, 27 September in Birmingham and 28 September in Manchester. The tour fared better in North America with 34 US and Canadian shows from 11 October 1985 in Santa Cruz, California until 14 December 1985 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.|$|E
2500|$|Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said, {{while visiting}} Romania, that Iran expects a new {{government}} to respect the JCPOA. [...] "It is our norm not to interfere in the domestic affairs of other countries. Since Iran and the US have no political relations, {{what is important is}} that America’s next president is bound by the multilateral commitments of the JCPOA. We are certain the international community would expect the same <b>thing</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> United States of America." [...] Foreign Ministry Spokesman Bahram Qassemi also said that U.S. policies in the past decades brought about [...] "an unpleasant, bitter experience" [...] for Iran. [...] "What is important to Iran and its people, and would be used by them as evaluation criteria, is the next US administration’s future performance and executive policies." [...] He added that the policies of previous administrations, including intervention in the Middle East, are the “main factor behind the escalation of tensions." [...] As such, he called for a review of its policies vis-à-vis other regions.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{graduation}} from Wake Forest, White went to Europe, {{in an effort}} to prove that he could succeed there. [...] He signed with Serbian club OFK Beograd, in January 2004, shunning offers from Major League Soccer, where he had been drafted in the third round of the MLS SuperDraft by the New England Revolution. [...] White's short time with Beograd was marred by a racism incident that occurred in March 2004, and received international media attention. [...] White and a group of friends, including two black Brazilians, were confronted by a group of angry youth, one of whom, according to White, was [...] "throwing around Nazi signs." [...] Fierce words were exchanged, punches were thrown, and the groups eventually separated with no serious damage incurred. [...] News organizations like BBC, RAI, and CNN picked up on the story, and White was headline news around the world for a short time. [...] A month later, White asked for, and was granted, release from his contract on April 6, 2004, which led to speculation that White was leaving the team {{as a result of the}} incident. [...] White dismissed this, saying, [...] "That's the farthest <b>thing</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> truth." ...|$|E

2500|$|But {{the papal}} censure now proved a very {{different}} <b>thing</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> one four years before. It was widely felt to be an injustice, and people began to ask whether an excommunication pronounced on frivolous grounds was entitled to respect. [...] The king, now more experienced, took up the struggle with great vigour. He refused to acknowledge the ban on the ground of its illegality. He then summoned a Council, which met at Brixen, and on 16 June, [...] pronounced Gregory deposed. It nominated the archbishop Guibert (Wibert) of Ravenna as his successor. On 25 June 1080, Guibert was elected Pope by the thirty bishops who were present at the King's command. [...] On 15 October 1080, Pope Gregory advised the clergy and laity to elect a new archbishop {{in place of the}} [...] "mad" [...] and [...] "tyrannical" [...] schismatic Wibert. In 1081, Henry opened the conflict against Gregory in Italy. Gregory's support had by that time weakened, and thirteen cardinals had deserted him. [...] To make matters worse, Rudolf of Swabia died on 16 October of the same year. Henry was now in a stronger position and Gregory a weaker one. A new claimant, Hermann of Luxembourg, was put forward in August 1081, but his personality was not suitable for a leader of the Gregorian party in Germany, and the power of Henry IV was at its peak.|$|E
2500|$|Interpreting the {{prohibition}} of coveting in [...] (20:14 in NJSP) and desiring in [...] (5:18 in NJPS), Maimonides taught that any person who covets a servant, a maidservant, a house, or utensils that belong to a colleague, or any other article that the person can purchase from the colleague and pressures the colleague with friends and requests until the colleague agrees to sell, violates a negative commandment, even though the person pays much money for it, as [...] (20:14 in NJSP) says, [...] "Do not covet." [...] Maimonides taught that the violation of this commandment was not punished by lashes, {{because it does not}} involve a deed. Maimonides taught that a person does not violate [...] (20:14 in NJSP) until the person actually takes the article that the person covets, as reflected by [...] "Do not covet the gold and silver on these statues and take it for yourself." [...] Maimonides read the word for [...] "covet" [...] in both [...] (20:14 in NJSP) and [...] to refer to coveting accompanied by a deed. Maimonides taught that a person who desires a home, a spouse, utensil, or anything else belonging to a colleague that the person can acquire violates a negative commandment when the person thinks in the person's heart how {{it might be possible to}} acquire this <b>thing</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> colleague. Maimonides read [...] (5:18 in NJPS), [...] "Do not desire," [...] to refer even to feelings in the heart alone. Thus, a person who desires another person's property violates one negative commandment. A person who purchases an object the person desires after pressuring the owners and repeatedly asking them, violates two negative commandments. For that reason, Maimonides concluded, the Torah prohibits both desiring in [...] (5:18 in NJPS) and coveting in [...] (20:14 in NJSP). And if the person takes the article by robbery, the person violates three negative commandments.|$|E
