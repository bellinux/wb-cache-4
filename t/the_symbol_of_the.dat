Dumas wore a top emblazoned with <b>the</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> band during her final match in WWE. The band {{released}} their self-titled debut CD, The Luchagors, on September 11, 2007.|$|E
5|$|Andersen biographer Jackie Wullschlager {{indicates}} that “Thumbelina” {{was the first}} of Andersen's tales to dramatize the sufferings of one who is different, and, as a result of being different, becomes the object of mockery. It was also the first of Andersen's tales to incorporate the swallow as <b>the</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> poetic soul and Andersen’s identification with the swallow as a migratory bird whose pattern of life his own traveling days were beginning to resemble.|$|E
5|$|Due {{in part to}} the {{diffusion}} of national and Republican ideas across France {{during the second half of}} the Third Republic, the Bastille lost an element of its prominence as a symbol by the 20th century. Nonetheless, the Place de la Bastille continued to be the traditional location for left wing rallies, particularly in the 1930s, <b>the</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bastille was widely evoked by the French Resistance during the Second World War and until the 1950s Bastille Day remained the single most significant French national holiday.|$|E

5|$|Green was the {{traditional}} color of Irish nationalism, {{beginning in the}} 17th century. The green harp flag, with a traditional gaelic harp, became <b>the</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> movement. It was the banner of the Society of United Irishmen, which organized the Irish Rebellion of 1798, calling for Irish independence. The uprising was suppressed with great bloodshed by the British army. When Ireland achieved independence in 1922, green was incorporated into the national flag.|$|E
5|$|Her {{death was}} widely publicised shortly {{afterwards}} by the Polish press, which contributed to her growing fame. Plater {{became one of}} the symbols of the uprising. <b>The</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fighting girl became quite widespread both in Poland, Lithuania and abroad. Mickiewicz immortalized her in his poem, Śmierć pułkownika (Death of a Colonel), although the description of her death is a pure poetical fiction and was only loosely based on her real life. Mickiewicz has also idealized her personality and skills, portraying her as the ideal commander, worshiped by her soldiers. That poem has entered the elementary curriculum in the independent Poland.|$|E
5|$|Ophelia {{has also}} been defended by feminist critics, most notably Elaine Showalter. Ophelia is {{surrounded}} by powerful men: her father, brother, and Hamlet. All three disappear: Laertes leaves, Hamlet abandons her, and Polonius dies. Conventional theories had argued that without these three powerful men making decisions for her, Ophelia is driven into madness. Feminist theorists argue that she goes mad with guilt because, when Hamlet kills her father, he has fulfilled her sexual desire to have Hamlet kill her father {{so they can be}} together. Showalter points out that Ophelia has become <b>the</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> distraught and hysterical woman in modern culture.|$|E

5|$|Students {{moved into}} the center on May 8, 1987. The school {{remained}} unfinished, but the dormitory levels had been completed. Students had formerly been housed at Kibbutz Ramat Rachel. In 1988, before the center's dedication, a few Jerusalem locals complained that {{the arrangement of the}} windows at night looked like a Christian cross. The center purchased blinds and carefully arranged them over the windows so that no such sign would be seen. Members of the LDS Church do not use <b>the</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cross as other Christian denominations do, due to their focus on the resurrection, rather than the death, of Christ.|$|E
5|$|The dodo {{is used as}} a mascot {{for many}} kinds of products, {{especially}} in Mauritius. It appears as a supporter on the coat of arms of Mauritius, {{is used as a}} watermark on all Mauritian rupee banknotes, and features as the background of the Mauritian immigration form. A smiling dodo is <b>the</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Brasseries de Bourbon, a popular brewer on Réunion, whose emblem displays the white species once thought to have lived there.|$|E
5|$|The dragon motif is {{repeated}} in the radial coffers of the caisson and the timbered coffers throughout the theatre. The Imperial dragon is accompanied by <b>the</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Empress, the Chinese phoenix (Fèng huáng), sometimes called Ho-Ho or Ho-Oh Bird from the Japanese. This personal symbol of the Empress is also repeated throughout the theatre, but most prominently in relief {{as part of the}} grills above false balconies that once screened organ pipes. In addition to these symbols, orange blossoms, chrysanthemums, and lotus flowers appear throughout the theatre. The highly decorated proscenium arch and safety curtain maintain the Chinese design influence.|$|E

5|$|The medical faculties of Charles University in Prague {{also have}} a pelican as their emblem. <b>The</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Irish Blood Transfusion Service is a pelican, {{and for most of}} its {{existence}} the headquarters of the service was located at Pelican House in Dublin, Ireland. The heraldic pelican also ended up as a pub name and image, though sometimes with the image of the ship Golden Hind. Sir Francis Drake's famous ship was initially called Pelican, and adorned the British halfpenny coin.|$|E
5|$|Detractors of {{the flag}} movement, {{including}} Motilal Nehru, soon hailed the Swaraj flag {{as a symbol of}} national unity. Thus, the flag became a significant structural component of the institution of India. In contrast to the subdued responses of the past, the British Indian government took greater cognisance of the new flag, and began to define a policy of response. The British parliament discussed public use {{of the flag}}, and based on directives from England, the British Indian government threatened to withdraw funds from municipalities and local governments that did not prevent the display of the Swaraj flag. The Swaraj flag became the official flag of Congress at the 1931 meeting. However, by then, the flag had already become <b>the</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> independence movement.|$|E
5|$|For five months, Henry took {{no action}} on the accusations against his archbishop. The {{conspiracy}} was finally revealed to Cranmer by the king himself. According to Cranmer's secretary, Ralph Morice, sometime in September 1543 the king showed Cranmer a paper summarising the accusations against him. An investigation was to be mounted and Cranmer was appointed chief investigator. Surprise raids were carried out, evidence gathered, and ringleaders identified. Typically, Cranmer put the clergymen involved in the conspiracy through immediate humiliation, but he eventually forgave them and continued to use their services. To show his trust in Cranmer, Henry gave Cranmer his personal ring. When the Privy Council arrested Cranmer {{at the end of}} November, the nobles were stymied by <b>the</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> king's trust in him. Cranmer's victory ended with two second-rank leaders imprisoned and Germain Gardiner executed.|$|E

5|$|In 2001, President Lukashenko {{issued a}} decree {{granting}} a flag to the Armed Forces of Belarus. The flag, {{which has a}} ratio of 1:1.7, has the national ornamental pattern {{along the length of}} the hoist side of the flag. On the front of the flag is the Belarusian coat of arms, with the wording УЗБРОЕНЫЯ СІЛЫ ("Armed Forces") arched over it, and РЭСПУБЛІКІ БЕЛАРУСЬ ("of Republic of Belarus") written below; the text of both is in gold. On the reverse of the flag, the center contains <b>the</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> armed forces, which is a red star surrounded by a wreath of oak and laurel. Above the symbol is the phrase ЗА НАШУ РАДЗІМУ ("For our Motherland"), while below is the full name of the military unit.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, PD {{affected}} 6.2 {{million people}} and resulted in about 117,400 deaths globally. Parkinson's disease typically occurs in people {{over the age of}} 60, of which about one percent are affected. Males are more often affected than females. When it is seen in people before the age of 50, it is called young-onset PD. The average life expectancy following diagnosis is between 7 and 14 years. The disease is named after the English doctor James Parkinson, who published the first detailed description in An Essay on the Shaking Palsy, in 1817. Public awareness campaigns include World Parkinson's Day (on the birthday of James Parkinson, 11 April) and the use of a red tulip as <b>the</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disease. People with parkinsonism who have increased the public's awareness of the condition include actor Michael J. Fox, Olympic cyclist Davis Phinney, and late professional boxer Muhammad Ali.|$|E
5|$|In {{the social}} {{evolution}} from the archaic age to the classical, the public ceased carrying weapons into the poleis. Originally {{it was expected}} that one carried a sword while in the city; However, a transition to spears, and then to staffs occurred until wearing any weapon in the city became a foolish old custom. Thus, the very act of carrying a staff was slightly taboo itself. According to modern theorists, <b>the</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> staff was one which both functions as a tool to signal the user’s dissociation from physical labour, that is, as a display of conspicuous leisure, {{and at the same time}} it also has an association with sport and typically plays a part in hunting and sports clothing. Thus, it displays active and warlike qualities, rather than being a symbol of a weak man’s need to support himself. The staff itself became a message of how the Cynic was free through its possible interpretation as an item of leisure, but, just as equivalent, was its message of strength - a virtue held in abundance by the Cynic philosopher.|$|E

5|$|Overall, {{the relief}} is in {{excellent}} condition. It was originally received in three pieces and some fragments by the British Museum; after repair, some cracks are still apparent, in particular a triangular piece missing {{on the right}} edge, but the main features of the deity and the animals are intact. The figure's face has damage to its left side, {{the left side of}} the nose and the neck region. The headdress has some damage to its front and right hand side, but the overall shape can be inferred from symmetry. Half of the necklace is missing and <b>the</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> figure held in her right hand; the owls' beaks are lost and a piece of a lion's tail. A comparison of images from 1936 and 2005 shows that some modern damage has been sustained as well: the right hand side of the crown has now lost its top tier, and at the lower left corner a piece of the mountain patterning has chipped off and the owl has lost its right-side toes. However, in all major aspects, the relief has survived intact for more than 3,500years.|$|E
5|$|Starting with {{victory in}} the Revolution, there were many {{proposals}} to build a monument to Washington. After his death, Congress authorized a suitable memorial in the national capital, but the decision was reversed when the Democratic-Republican Party (Jeffersonian Republicans) took control of Congress in 1801. The Republicans were dismayed that Washington had become <b>the</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Federalist Party; furthermore the values of Republicanism seemed hostile {{to the idea of}} building monuments to powerful men. They also blocked his image on coins or the celebration of his birthday. Further political squabbling, along with the North-South division on the Civil War, blocked the completion of the Washington Monument until the late 19th century. By that time, Washington had the image of a national hero who could be celebrated by both North and South, and memorials to him were no longer controversial.|$|E
5|$|The Addolorata Society {{was started}} {{by a group of}} women parishioners in 1903 and {{continues}} to be an all-women society. The goal of the group is to find better ways to serve the church. <b>The</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Addolorata Society is the Blessed Mother because she symbolizes love. A member becomes a free life member when she turns eighty, as long as she has a member for at least fifteen years prior to her eightieth birthday. Some of their events include attending funeral Masses and collecting money to purchase altar linens, vestments, and altar lights. The presidents of the society since 1903 in chronological order are as follows: Mrs. Rose Spinelli, Mrs. Michelina Fragale, Mrs. Maria Greco, Mrs. Rose Pascuzzi, Mrs. Santa Bordonaro, Mrs. Anna Bordonaro, Mrs. Sabetta, Mrs. Carmina Chirella, Georgeanne Stearman, and Sandy Laney.|$|E
