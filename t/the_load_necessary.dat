The RPV steel is 22 NiMoCr 37 (A 508 Cl. 2). The expected neutron fluence at the end of license (EOL) after 32 years of full operation is Phi < 2. 3 x 10 (18) neutrons/cm(2). The assessment followed a multibarrier concept to independently prove the exclusion of crack initiation, crack arrest, and exclusion of <b>the</b> <b>load</b> <b>necessary</b> to advance the arrested cracks through the RPV wall. Thermal and structural analyses of the RPV were performed both for the reactor shutdown with postulated upset conditions, as the most severe load case at operation, and for loss of coolant accident (LOCA) conditions. For LOCA transients, a leak size screening of different combinations of cold/hot leg injection of emergency core cooling was performed, and the leading leak size was determined. A fracture mechanics based assessment was carried out for extended circumferential flaws in the weld joint between the RPV shell and the flange, as well as for axial flaws in the nozzle corner. These flaw geometries postulated at locations of the highest principal stresses and lowest temperatures under the respective transient conditions are representative for the brittle failure assessment of the whole vessel. For a normal operation, the maximum crack driving force takes place at high temperatures preceding the upset conditions. The transient follows a load path decreasing with temperature, producing a warm prestressing effect, which is considered in the assessment. Thus, a large safety margin against crack initiation can be demonstrated. At LOCA, the most severe conditions are determined for postulated cracks in the nozzle corner. Here, applying the constraint modified master curve, which takes account of the low stress triaxiality in the component, the exclusion of crack initiation is proven. Furthermore, two additional safety barriers are proven, the crack arrest after postulated crack initiation well within the allowable depth, as well as the preclusion of <b>the</b> <b>load</b> <b>necessary</b> to advance the arrested crack through the RPV wall...|$|E

40|$|The {{brittle failure}} {{assessment}} for the {{reactor pressure vessel}} (RPV) of a 1300 MW pressurized water reactor (PWR) was revised according to the advanced state of the art. The RPV steel is 22 NiMoCr 37 (A 508 Cl. 2). The expected neutron fluence at End of License (EOL) after 32 years of full operation is Φ < 2. 31018 cm- 2. The assessment followed a multi-barrier concept to prove independently exclusion of crack initiation, crack arrest and exclusion of <b>the</b> <b>load</b> <b>necessary</b> to advance the arrested cracks through the RPV wall. For operational conditions, a combination of shut-down and anomalous operation was proven as the leading transient. This transient follows a load path decreasing with temperature and thus producing a warm pre-stressing for flaws in the RPV. Therefore, a warm pre-stress (WPS) effect is to be considered. For {{loss of coolant accident}} (LOCA) conditions, a leak size screening was performed to find the leading transients. Enveloping transients were determined and used for the brittle failure assessment. As covering crack postulates circumferential cracks in the flange joint to the vessel and axial cracks in the nozzle corner were investigated both under the assumption of a broken clad. For the LOCA loads, the leading leak size was determined by finite element analyses and fracture mechanics based assessment of different combinations of cold/hot leg leak position and cold/hot leg injection of emergency core cooling (ECC). Leading situations are in the flange joint for the cylinder and in the nozzle corner for the flange. In the nozzle corner, high thermal loading from cross corner cooling produces large plastic deformation and loss of constraint. In this situation, the fracture toughness KIC as determined from deeply cracked fracture mechanics specimens is not representative for the component. Thus, loss of constraint in the component was considered by the application of a constraint modified master curve to determine the constraint representative fracture toughness. For the investigated load cases the relevant part of the load paths is at upper shelf temperatures, {{with the exception of the}} anomalous operation starting at 50 °C to lower temperatures. The results of the investigation demonstrate preclusion of initiation for normal and anomalous operation as well as for LOCA loads.

40|$|Graduation date: 1967 This work {{shows how}} a new design in a load cell {{can be built}} using the {{principles}} of photoelasticity.

This difference in light intensity can be displayed on a meter which is calibrated to give a reading of the applied load. The stress optic constant varies for the different photoelastic materials giving the load cell several ranges of loading. Also, model size may be varied, giving additional selectivity in the range of loading while keeping the accuracy high. Load ranges may range from 0 - 2. 7 ounces to 0 - 430 pounds.

40|$|A {{tensegrity}} {{system is}} considered {{here as a}} stable pin-jointed cable-bar framework with a rank-deficient equilibrium matrix. This means that the system possesses infinitesimal mechanisms stabilized by a self-stress state. We present a method for the shape-change of a tensegrity system, starting from an initial known configuration. The method {{is based on the}} characterization of the rank-deficiency manifold in the space of nodal coordinates [8]. The tangent space to this manifold is orthogonal to the geometric load vectors of the system. The geometric load, associated to a self-stress state and a mechanism, is <b>the</b> <b>load</b> <b>necessary</b> to preserve the equilibrium after a small displacement along the mechanism [1]. During a motion along a path on the manifold, the vector of nodal velocities has to remain orthogonal to the set of vectors of geometric loads. Once this characterization is given, we can use a subset of edge-lengths to form a local coordinate system on the manifold [4]. The change in shape is then obtained by using edge-lengths as control parameters in compatibility equations, i. e. those equations which give the deformation rates of the edges {{as a function of the}} nodal velocities. Compatibility equations and orthogonality conditions form together a system of ordinary differential equation which can be solved efficiently with the Runge-Kutta integration scheme.

The {{purpose of this}} study was to evaluate after fatigue testing, the effect of heat-treatment and veneering on the fracture resistance of frameworks manufactured using sintered and subsequently hot isostatic pressed yttrium oxide partially-stabilized zirconia (Denzir). METHODS: The specimens were subjected to dynamic loading in water. Thereafter, using a universal testing machine, the fracture resistance of three-unit fixed partial dentures was determined; (i) of the frameworks as delivered after machining, (ii) after the frameworks had been subjected to heat-treatment similar to veneering with a glass-ceramic (Eris) or a feldspar-based ceramic (Vita D) and (iii) after the frameworks had been veneered with these ceramics.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a discussion of}} the history of Carbon Cloth Phenolic (CCP) ply lifting in the Redesigned Solid Rocket Motor (RSRM) Program, a brief presentation of theoretical methods used for analytical evaluation, and results of parametric analyses of CCP material subject to test conditions of the Laser Hardened Material Evaluation Laboratory. CCP ply lift can occur in regions of the RSRM nozzle where ply angle to flame surface is generally less than about 20 degrees. There is a heat rate dependence on likelihood and severity of the condition with the higher heating rates generally producing more ply lift. The event occurs in-depth, near the heated surface, where <b>the</b> <b>load</b> <b>necessary</b> to mechanically separate the CCP plies is produced by the initial stages of pyrolysis gas generation due to the thermal decomposition of the phenolic resin matrix. Due to the shallow lay-up angle of the composite, normal components of the indepth mechanical load, due to "pore pressure", are imparted primarily as a cross-ply tensile force on the interlaminar ply boundaries. Tensile capability in the cross-ply (out of plane) direction is solely determined by the matrix material capability. The elevated temperature matrix material capabilities are overcome by pressure induced mechanical normal stress and ply-lift occurs. A theoretical model used for CCP in-depth temperature, pressure, and normal stress prediction, based on first principles, is briefly discussed followed by a parametric evaluation of response variables subject to boundary conditions typical of on-going test programs at the LHMEL facility. Model response demonstrates general trends observed in test and provides insight into the interactivity of material properties and constitutive relationships...|$|E
40|$|The {{accumulation}} of microdamage in bone {{may contribute to}} loss of bone quality in osteoporosis, {{and the role of}} microdamage in the etiology of fatigue fractures is unknown. Microdamage created during testing, ex vivo, can increase the fragility of bone by decreasing <b>the</b> <b>load</b> <b>necessary</b> to cause fracture. Microdamage can also accumulate in vivo, but its influence on bone fragility is unknown. To date, stained microcracks are the only criteria to have been correlated with bone mechanics, leaving the influence of ultrastructural damage on bone fragility open for scrutiny. Staining en bloc has identified three morphological features in the tissue, discrete microcracks, cross-hatch staining, and diffuse staining. The relationship between these features and their identification as microdamage remains equivocal. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the three-dimensional nature of microdamage in cancellous bone and also to describe stained microcracks, cross-hatch staining, and diffuse staining and to determine whether they all relate to microdamage in bone. Laser scanning confocal microscopy that provides improved spatial resolution over bright-field microscopy was used to visualize bone damage. It was found that crack surface density was highly correlated with crack density (r = 0. 95, p < 0. 0001), suggesting that the crack surface of preexisting cracks increases as new cracks are formed or submicroscopic cracks become visible under bright-field microscopy. Cross-hatch staining and diffuse staining included ultra-microcracks about 10 μm in length. The ultra-microcracks in cross-hatch staining were organized in bands and surrounded by diffuse staining. This study demonstrates that damage in bone occurs over a wide range and that discrete microcracks, cross-hatch staining, and diffuse staining are all indicative of bone damage. The diffuse staining still evident in association with the ultra-microcracks seen in cross-hatch staining and diffuse staining is probably due to damage at a still smaller scale than we have been able to investigate.

40|$|The {{impingement}} of edge dislocations on nano-scale interfaces {{formed when}} bringing in contact aluminum crystals is investigated using molecular dynamics simulations. Dislocations, {{inserted in the}} bottom crystal, glide towards the contact when the two crystals are pressed together. There, dislocations are absorbed and upon further loading new dislocations are nucleated from the impinging site. Absorption and nucleation are events that affect the length of dislocation pile-ups and therefore the plastic behavior of crystals under contact loading. While {{it is possible to}} track absorption and nucleation at the nano-scale with molecular dynamics simulations, larger scale models, which are suitable to study plasticity, do not have the right resolution and neglect these events. The goal of this work is {{to gain a better understanding}} of dislocation impingement and to assess to which extent absorption and renucleation would play a role at the larger scale. The contacts are here characterized by their initial atomic scale roughness for which a simple, novel definition is introduced. Results show for the first time that roughness controls dislocation nucleation from the contact. This is true for both dislocation-free crystals and for crystals containing one or more dislocations before application of contact loading. In dislocation-free crystals nucleation occurs at decreasing load for increasing roughness. When a dislocation impinges on the contact, it affects its local roughness, by that decreasing <b>the</b> <b>load</b> <b>necessary</b> for dislocation nucleation. Only when the initial roughness of the contact is above a given threshold, dislocation impingement does not affect the load required for nucleation. If instead of a single dislocation, a train of dislocations impinges on the same site, dislocation nucleation is even more facilitated. However, even in this case the contact pressure required to nucleate dislocations is in the order of one GPa, rather high compared with the pressure required to sustain plastic deformation when macro-scale bodies are in contact...|$|E

In contrary to <b>the</b> other <b>load</b> shedding strategies, there is no limitation in where <b>the</b> <b>load</b> could be shedding and how much could be shedding. Furthermore, this algorithm has the advantages of PSO method. That is this algorithm doesn't require the gradient information, and has better global search ability. The effectiveness of this model is verified by the simulation results concerning the IEEE 30 -bus system. Department of Electrical EngineeringRefereed conference pape...|$|R
40|$|A {{theoretical}} and {{experimental study of}} the buckling under impulsive load of an arch with rotational end restraints was carried out. Impulsive loading was realized experimentally by use of the spray deposited explosive silver nitrate-silver acetylide. <b>The</b> experimental buckling <b>loads</b> were compared to those obtained by a theoretical analysis. It {{was found that the}} theoretical analysis yields a quite conservative lower bound on <b>the</b> magnitude of <b>load</b> <b>necessary</b> for buckling. Both uniform and nonuniform loadings were considered. It was found that there exists a critical value of rotational spring constant above which dynamic buckling may not occur in the rigorous mathematical sense. An expression for this critical value was found...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{concentrates}} on mega–catastrophic risks whose coverage can be gained only by resorting to funds {{from outside the}} insurance industry. We propose a definition of catastrophe, mega-catastrophe, mega-catastrophic risk and insured mega-catastrophic risk. Furthermore, under suitable assumptions, we propose and analyze the decomposition of a mega–catastrophic risk in a part retained by the insurance market (using a catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance contract) and in a part transferred to the financial market (by issuing catastrophe bonds). Accordingly, {{taking into account the}} solvency constraint for the insurance business and the no–arbitrage condition for the financial market, we compute <b>the</b> safety <b>loading</b> <b>necessary</b> for <b>the</b> insurance of the mega–catastrophic risk, analyzing some of the different possible choices corresponding to different risky insurance portfolios. Key words: Mega–catastrophic risk, capacity, Lundberg exponent, premium loading factor, catastrophe bonds...|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} avoid this kind of delays and to {{minimize}} the time to scale, we implemented a faster scaling method in the API Server calling a specific entry of <b>the</b> <b>load</b> balancing plugin each 10 seconds. The encrypted call transmits collective cluster information consisting of all edge server heartbeats including a timestamp. A history of the last minute of heartbeats is kept in memory to determine the actual progression of <b>load.</b> Depending on <b>the</b> <b>load</b> history <b>the</b> <b>necessary</b> measures like cluster resizing are initiated by the API Server.|$|R
