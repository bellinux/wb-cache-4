5|$|When cranial CSF leak is {{suspected}} because of {{discharge from the}} nose or ear that is potentially CSF, the fluid can be collected and tested with a beta-2 transferrin assay. This <b>test</b> <b>can</b> positively identify if the fluid is cerebrospinal fluid.|$|E
5|$|In {{parallel}} with the efforts of Pierce, Silcott's lawyers had requested access in November 1990 to his original interview notes, so that the seven pages from his crucial fifth interview – the notes he said were fabricated– could be submitted for an electrostatic detection analysis (ESDA). The <b>test</b> <b>can</b> identify a small electrostatic charge left on a page when the page above it is written on; in this way, the test's developers say, the chronological integrity of interview notes can be determined.|$|E

5|$|The World Health Organization, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and US {{government}} are subsidizing a fast-acting diagnostic tuberculosis test {{for use in}} low- and middle-income countries. In addition to being fast-acting, the <b>test</b> <b>can</b> determine if there is resistance to the antibiotic rifampicin which may indicate multi-drug resistant tuberculosis and is accurate in those who are also infected with HIV. Many resource-poor places as of 2011 have access to only sputum microscopy.|$|E
5|$|Fruit bodies {{produce a}} white spore print. Spores are {{elliptical}} to cylindrical, smooth, hyaline (translucent), and measure 3.5–5 by 2–3μm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club shaped and four-spored, with dimensions of 18–22 by 5–5.6μm. H.nidulans has a monomitic hyphal system, containing only generative hyphae with clamp connections. In the flesh, these hyphae are thick-walled and highly branched, measuring up to 10μm in diameter; hyphae comprising the pores and the subhymenium are thinner (up to 6μm wide) and less branched. A chemical <b>test</b> <b>can</b> {{be used to}} help identify H.nidulans: all parts of the fruit body will instantly stain bright violet if a drop of an alkaline solution is applied. Dilute (3–10%) potassium hydroxide (KOH), is often used for this purpose.|$|E
5|$|In most cases, thyroid cancer {{presents}} as a painless {{mass in the}} neck. It is {{very unusual}} for thyroid cancers to present with other symptoms, although in some cases cancer may cause hyperthyroidism. Most malignant thyroid cancers are papillary, followed by follicular, medullary, and thyroid lymphoma. Because of the prominence of the thyroid gland, cancer is often detected earlier {{in the course of}} disease as the cause of a nodule, which may undergo fine needle aspiration. Thyroid function tests will help reveal whether the nodule produces excess thyroid hormones. A radioactive iodine uptake <b>test</b> <b>can</b> help reveal the activity and location of the cancer and metastases.|$|E

50|$|Most {{forms of}} {{cognition}} actually involve multiple cognitive functions working in unison, however <b>tests</b> <b>can</b> be organised into broad categories {{based on the}} cognitive function which they predominantly assess.

5|$|If morning {{cortisol}} {{levels are}} over 500nmol/l, ACTH deficiency is unlikely, whereas a level less than 100 is indicative. Levels between 100-500 require a stimulation test. This, too, {{is done with}} the insulin tolerance test. A cortisol level above 500 after achieving a low blood sugar rules out ACTH deficiency, while lower levels confirm the diagnosis. A similar stimulation test using corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) is not sensitive enough {{for the purposes of}} the investigation. If the insulin tolerance test yields an abnormal result, a further test measuring the response of the adrenal glands to synthetic ACTH (the ACTH stimulation <b>test)</b> <b>can</b> be performed to confirm the diagnosis. Stimulation testing with metyrapone is an alternative. Some suggest that an ACTH stimulation test is sufficient as first-line investigation, and that an insulin tolerance test is only needed if the ACTH test is equivocal. The insulin tolerance test is discouraged in children. None of the tests for ACTH deficiency are perfect, and further tests after a period of time may be needed if initial results are not conclusive.|$|E
5|$|Measures {{to prevent}} {{opportunistic}} infections {{are effective in}} many people with HIV/AIDS. In addition to improving current disease, treatment with antiretrovirals {{reduces the risk of}} developing additional opportunistic infections. Adults and adolescents who are living with HIV (even on anti-retroviral therapy) with no evidence of active tuberculosis in settings with high tuberculosis burden should receive isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT), the tuberculin skin <b>test</b> <b>can</b> be used to help decide if IPT is needed. Vaccination against hepatitis A and B is advised for all people at risk of HIV before they become infected; however it may also be given after infection. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis between four and six weeks of age and ceasing breastfeeding in infants born to HIV positive mothers is recommended in resource limited settings. It is also recommended to prevent PCP when a person's CD4 count is below 200cells/uL and in those who have or have previously had PCP. People with substantial immunosuppression are also advised to receive prophylactic therapy for toxoplasmosis and MAC. Appropriate preventive measures have reduced the rate of these infections by 50% between 1992 and 1997. Influenza vaccination and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine are often recommended in people with HIV/AIDS with some evidence of benefit.|$|E
5|$|The IIHF {{follows the}} World Anti-Doping Agency's (WADA) {{regulations}} on performance-enhancing drugs. The IIHF maintains a Registered Testing Pool, {{a list of}} top players who are subjected to random in-competition and out-of-competition drug tests. According to the WADA, a positive in-competition test results in disqualification of the player and a suspension that varies {{based on the number}} of offences. When a player tests positive, the rest of their team is subjected to testing; another positive <b>test</b> <b>can</b> result in a disqualification of the entire team. In 2001, the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) pushed for American NHL players who were potential Olympians to be subject to random drug tests. The USOC requires all Olympic-bound athletes to be randomly tested by the United States Anti-Doping Agency, but had exempted NHL players in 1998. The NHL preferred a more uniform method, in which all players would undergo the same number of tests from the WADA. An agreement was reached that the WADA would start testing players after the NHL playoffs were finished.|$|E

5|$|To works, however, {{of which}} the {{excellence}} is not absolute and definite, but gradual and comparative; to works not raised upon principles demonstrative and scientifick, but appealing wholly to observation and experience, no other <b>test</b> <b>can</b> be applied than length of duration and continuance of esteem. What mankind have long possessed they have often examined and compared, and if they persist to value the possession, it is because frequent comparisons have confirmed opinion in its favour. As among the works of nature no man can properly call a river deep or a mountain high, without the knowledge of many mountains and many rivers; so in the productions of genius, nothing can be stiled excellent till it has been compared with other works of the same kind. Demonstration immediately displays its power, and has nothing to hope or fear from the flux of years; but works tentative and experimental must be estimated by their proportion to the general and collective ability of man, as it is discovered in a long succession of endeavours. Of the first building that was raised, it might be with certainty determined that it was round or square, but whether it was spacious or lofty must have been referred to time. The Pythagorean scale of numbers was at once discovered to be perfect; but the poems of Homer we yet know not to transcend the common limits of human intelligence, but by remarking, that nation after nation, and century after century, {{has been able to}} do little more than transpose his incidents, new name his characters, and paraphrase his sentiments.|$|E
