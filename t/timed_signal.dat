The <b>timed</b> <b>signal</b> transition graph model, an interpreted Petri net, is a formal specification that is capable to characterize the temporal behavior of asynchronous circuits by utilizing interval delays. However asynchronous circuits are prone to metastability, which may subside after an arbitrarily long time. Thus an interval analysis yields a very pessimistic description of the performance bounds. In this paper we take a probabilistic approach based on a Petri net model to study the effect of metastability {{in the performance of}} asynchronous circuits. We illustrate our approach by modeling the Seitz' arbiter as a case study. 1.

Because power-supply rails in digital systems are very noisy, we have analysed the effect of Gaussian white noise and sine wave interference added to the PIC 16 F 873 power supply pin.

Such an interface design can be carried out based on the protocols used by the components. This paper addresses the problem of determining the feasibility of a design prior to synthesis. A design is called feasible if it achieves the desired functionality and satisfies the given environmental constraints. Because timing is an important aspect of a correct design, protocols are described using <b>timed</b> <b>signal</b> transition graphs, an interpreted Petri net.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a decomposition-based method for timed circuit design that {{is capable of}} significantly reducing the cost of synthesis. In particular, this method synthesizes each output individually. It begins by contracting the <b>timed</b> <b>signal</b> transition graph (STG) to include only transitions on the output of interest and its possible trigger signals. Next, the reachable state space for this contracted STG is analyzed to determine a minimal number of additional signals, which must be reintroduced into the STG to obtain complete state coding. The circuit for this output is then synthesized from this STG. Results show that the quality of the circuit implementation is nearly as good as the one found from the full reachable state space, but it can be applied to find circuits for which full-state-space methods cannot be successfully applied.

40|$|Abstract—Globally a{{synchronous}}, locally synchronous (GALS) systems-on-chip (SoCs) may be {{prone to}} synchronization failures if the delay of their locally-generated clock tree is not considered. This paper presents an in-depth analysis {{of the problem and}} proposes a novel solution. The problem is analyzed considering the magnitude of clock tree delays, the cycle times of the GALS module, and the complexity of the asynchronous interface controllers using a <b>timed</b> <b>signal</b> transition graph (STG) approach. In some cases, the problem can be solved by extracting all the delays and verifying whether the system is susceptible to metastability. In other cases, when high data bandwidth is not required, matched-delay asynchronous ports may be employed. A novel architecture for synchronizing inter-modular communications in GALS, based on locally delayed latching (LDL), is described. LDL synchronization does not require pausable clocking, is insensitive to clock tree delays, and supports high data rates. It replaces complex global timing constraints with simpler localized ones. Three different LDL ports are presented. The risk of metastability in the synchronizer is analyzed in a technology-independent manner.

40|$|Formal {{approaches}} to HW and system design {{have not been}} generally adopted, because designers often view the modelling concepts in these approaches as unsuitable for their problems. Moreover, they are frequently on a too high abstraction level to allow for efficient synthesis with today’s techniques. We address this problem with a modelling method, which is strictly formal and based on formal semantics, a pure functional language, and the synchrony hypothesis. But the use of skeletons {{in conjunction with a}} proper computational model allows to associate a direct hardware interpretation. In particular we use (1) the synchrony hypothesis and a <b>timed</b> <b>signal</b> model to provide a high abstraction for communication at the system level. This facilitates efficient modelling and design space exploration at the functional level, because the designer is not concerned with complex communication mechanisms, and functionality can easily be moved from one block to another. To bridge the gap between an elegant and abstract functional model and the details of an implementation we use (2) skeletons to encapsulate primitive structures, such as FSMs, buffers, computation units, etc. in a purely functional way. 1...|$|E
40|$|Well <b>timed</b> <b>signal</b> {{systems are}} capable of {{decreasing}} delay, overall travel time {{and the number of}} stops along a roadway. However, the mode of operation selected is crucial. With the arrival of actuated signal controllers, many agencies converted from pre-timed controllers to actuated controllers. Actuated controllers are considered 2 ̆ 2 smarter 2 ̆ 2 than pre-timed controllers since they are able to vary signal timing based upon traffic volumes present. As a result, actuated controllers are the best selection for isolated intersections with variable traffic demand. Pre-timed controllers are not as efficient as actuated controllers but they may be used at isolated intersections with predictable traffic volumes. However, the question remains: What is the best mode of operation for a signal system? To investigate this topic, two suburban arterial signal systems with approximately 1 / 2 mile signal spacing in southeastern Wisconsin were selected as test systems. High, medium, and low volume periods were determined for each system based on traffic volume counts. Utilizing SIGNAL 94 and PASSER II, optimal signal timing was developed for each mode of operation during each volume period. Evaluation of each system consisted of field gathering stopped delay, percent stopped and average running speed. TRAF-NETSIM analyses were completed for each of the test systems operating under semi-actuated and pre-timed modes of operation for each volume period to evaluate the simulation accuracy of TRAF-NETSIM. The output for each simulation includes stopped delay, and percent stopped. Using the data gathered during the evaluation phase, the output from the TRAF-NETSIM analysis was evaluated for accuracy. This research presents recommendations for optimum signal system operation based on traffic volumes. The recommendations suggest a suburban arterial signal system with speeds of 45 - 50 mph and signal spacing of approximately 1 / 2 mile operates most efficiently by changing the mode of operation based on volume conditions. In other words, the signal system may operate in the semi-actuated mode of operation for part of the day, the pre-timed mode of operation for part of the day and actuated {{for the remainder of the}} day...|$|E

40|$|The {{current state}} of the {{practice}} in traffic signal system management is highly dependent on modeling of signal operations based on historical field data. While the initial design phase is typically rigorous, once systems are installed and <b>timed,</b> <b>signal</b> timing updates are infrequent. As agencies compete for increasingly limited resources, enhanced quantitative performance data from traffic signal systems is urgently needed. As such data becomes available, it is highly desirable to make use of it to improve operations. ^ This dissertation defines and demonstrates several tools for measuring the performance of traffic signal systems and improving operations using that information. A portfolio of performance measures is proposed, including an analysis of the intersection phase capacity utilization; progression quality for coordinated phases; and estimated motorist delay time. Techniques for aggregating this data on an arterial system level are presented, including prototype graphics and tables that would be useful for agency performance reports. ^ A new visualization graphic is developed called the Purdue Coordination Diagram (PCD), allowing a qualitative appraisal of coordinated phase performance. When coupled with quantitative data, the PCD is a powerful tool for analyzing offset performance in a coordinated signal system. Using a simple model, the PCD is used to predict the impact of changes to arterial offsets; the prediction is verified by field implementation, with observed performance slightly superior to the prediction. Probe vehicle travel times decrease by 1. 7 minutes (28 %) in the northbound direction on the arterial system; the difference is statistically significant. ^ Procedures are proposed that aggregate the high resolution data to improve the computational efficiency of offset optimization algorithms. A “Link Pivoting” algorithm for optimizing offsets on a linear arterial is introduced, which revisits the Combination Method of the 1960 s- 1970 s. Link Pivoting is compared against a heirarchical heuristic search, Monte Carlo simulation, and TRANSYT-style hill climbing, using alternate objective functions (maximize arrivals on green or minimize delay). Link Pivoting yielded the best performing offsets out of the algorithms tested, and is comparable to TRANSYT in terms of computational complexity. A simple model is proposed that extends the offset analysis methodology to include changes to cycle length. ...|$|E
