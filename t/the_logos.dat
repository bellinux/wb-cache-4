5|$|In the prologue, John {{identifies}} Jesus as <b>the</b> <b>Logos</b> (Word). In Ancient Greek philosophy, {{the term}} logos meant {{the principle of}} cosmic reason. In this sense, it {{was similar to the}} Hebrew concept of Wisdom, God's companion and intimate helper in creation. The Hellenistic Jewish philosopher Philo merged these two themes when he described <b>the</b> <b>Logos</b> as God's creator of and mediator with the material world. The evangelist adapted Philo's description of <b>the</b> <b>Logos,</b> applying it to Jesus, the incarnation of <b>the</b> <b>Logos.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{second book}} is largely {{devoted to the}} {{respective}} roles of faith and philosophical argument. Clement contends that while both are important, the fear of God is foremost, because through faith one receives divine wisdom. To Clement, scripture is an innately true primitive philosophy which is complemented by human reason through <b>the</b> <b>Logos.</b> Faith is voluntary, and the decision to believe is a crucial fundamental step in becoming closer to God. It is never irrational, as it is founded on {{the knowledge of the}} truth of <b>the</b> <b>Logos,</b> but all knowledge proceeds from faith, as first principles are unprovable outside a systematic structure.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} Olympics, recent Paralympics {{have also been}} {{supported}} by contributions from major sponsors. Unlike the Olympics, where the IOC mandates that arenas be clean of sponsor logos, the Paralympics do allow <b>the</b> <b>logos</b> of official sponsors to be displayed inside arenas and on uniforms.|$|E
2500|$|In 1973–74, <b>the</b> {{original}} <b>logo</b> {{featured a}} white square {{with a black}} hockey stick and puck in it forming the letter [...] "C". <b>The</b> <b>logo</b> laid on a field of red {{in the middle of}} the chest. This was prior to having home and away uniforms. In the late 1970s, <b>the</b> <b>logo</b> changed to a red square with a black hockey stick and puck forming the letter [...] "C" [...] with the words [...] "Merritt" [...] above <b>the</b> <b>logo</b> and [...] "Centennials" [...] below <b>the</b> <b>logo.</b> On <b>the</b> home jerseys, <b>the</b> <b>logo</b> laid on a field of white, while on the away jerseys, <b>the</b> <b>logo</b> laid on a field of red.|$|R

5|$|But {{theories}} of either complete independence of or complete {{dependence on the}} synoptics are largely rejected in current scholarship: on the one hand, elements such as distinctive Johannine language, the lengthy discourses, and the prologue on <b>the</b> <b>Logos,</b> are clearly unique to John; on the other, John clearly shares a multitude of episodes with the other three.|$|E
5|$|Huff {{has several}} tattoos. A noted Transformers fan, he has <b>the</b> <b>logos</b> of the Autobots and Decepticons tattooed on his {{shoulder}} blades. On his left shoulder, {{he also has a}} tattoo of a guitar with his father's name under it in memory of his father.|$|E
5|$|Jesus {{is placed}} in his cosmic setting as <b>the</b> <b>Logos</b> made flesh who reveals God and gives {{salvation}} to believers; John the Baptist, Andrew, and Nathanael bear witness {{to him as the}} Lamb of God, the Son of God, and the Christ.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>logo</b> {{has always}} been a {{combination}} of <b>the</b> old Beano <b>logo</b> (from 1977-1998), slightly updated with the help of computer technology, and a blue, graffito style MAX alongside it.The original <b>logo</b> had <b>the</b> Beano <b>logo</b> as it was on the weekly comic, with the MAX overlapping it slightly at the right.In late 2007, the MAX part of <b>the</b> <b>logo</b> started to grow in size. It was almost twice the height as <b>the</b> Beano <b>logo</b> at one point.In 2008, for 3 issues in <b>the</b> summer, <b>the</b> <b>logo</b> changed so that the MAX was predominant to <b>the</b> Beano <b>logo.</b> Instead of <b>the</b> Beano <b>logo</b> running horizontal, it was now vertical, alongside the MAX which was by now on a diagonal bar. After these three issues, <b>the</b> BeanoMAX <b>logo</b> changed back to the style it had gained in late 2007.In 2009, <b>the</b> <b>logo</b> changed again, with <b>the</b> Beano <b>logo</b> directly above <b>the</b> MAX <b>logo.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>logo</b> became <b>the</b> {{target of}} jokes, with critics {{highlighting}} its similarity to <b>the</b> Adidas <b>logo,</b> <b>the</b> Stalin Memorial at Letná, <b>the</b> <b>logo</b> of financial Company OVB, and the symbol indicating a strong Wi-fi signal.|$|R

5|$|The {{figure of}} Orpheus is {{prominent}} throughout the narrative, and Clement contrasts his song, representing pagan superstition, {{with the divine}} Logos of Christ. According to Clement, through conversion to Christianity alone can man fully participate in <b>the</b> <b>Logos,</b> which is universal truth.|$|E

5|$|Sheep {{have had}} a strong {{presence}} in many cultures, especially in areas where they form {{the most common type}} of livestock. In the English language, to call someone a sheep or ovine may allude that they are timid and easily led. In contradiction to this image, male sheep are often used as symbols of virility and power; <b>the</b> <b>logos</b> of the Los Angeles Rams football team and the Dodge Ram pickup truck allude to males of the bighorn sheep, Ovis canadensis.|$|E
5|$|Three {{months after}} {{receiving}} the All-Star Game, the Hurricanes unveiled <b>the</b> <b>logo</b> for <b>the</b> 2011 game. <b>The</b> <b>logo</b> was designed with some homage to the host team and city hidden within it. The shape of <b>the</b> <b>logo</b> is similar to <b>the</b> Hurricanes primary <b>logo,</b> along with <b>the</b> team colors of red, black and silver.

5|$|The {{bald eagle}} appears on most {{official}} seals of the U.S. government, including the presidential seal, the presidential flag, and in <b>the</b> <b>logos</b> of many U.S. federal agencies. Between 1916 and 1945, the presidential flag (but not the seal) showed an eagle facing to its left (the viewer's right), which {{gave rise to}} the urban legend that the flag is changed to have the eagle face towards the olive branch in peace, and towards the arrows in wartime.|$|E
5|$|Three major {{theological}} controversies {{occurred during}} Manuel's reign. In 1156–1157 {{the question was}} raised whether Christ had offered himself as a sacrifice {{for the sins of}} the world to the Father and to the Holy Spirit only, or also to <b>the</b> <b>Logos</b> (i.e., to himself). In the end a synod held at Constantinople in 1157 adopted a compromise formula, that the Word made flesh offered a double sacrifice to the Holy Trinity, despite the dissidence of Patriarch of Antioch-elect Soterichus Panteugenus.|$|E
5|$|Although Christ, like man, {{is made in}} {{the image}} of God, he alone shares the {{likeness}} of God the Father. Christ is both sinless and apathetic, and thus by striving to imitate Christ, man can achieve salvation. To Clement, sin is involuntary, and thus irrational , removed only through the wisdom of <b>the</b> <b>Logos.</b> God's guidance of us away from sin is thus a manifestation of God's universal love for mankind. The word play on λόγος and αλόγον is characteristic of Clement's writing, and may be rooted in the Epicurean belief that relationships between words are deeply reflective of relationships between the objects they signify.|$|E

5|$|Reveton {{initially}} began spreading {{in various}} European countries in early 2012. Variants were localized with templates branded with <b>the</b> <b>logos</b> of different law enforcement organizations {{based on the}} user's country; for example, variants used in the United Kingdom contained the branding of {{organizations such as the}} Metropolitan Police Service and the Police National E-Crime Unit. Another version contained the logo of the royalty collection society PRS for Music, which specifically accused the user of illegally downloading music. In a statement warning the public about the malware, the Metropolitan Police clarified that they would never lock a computer {{in such a way as}} part of an investigation.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} by Atari, Inc. beginning in 1974; the earliest schematics in the service manual are from June 1974, while the last is from November. The schematics bear <b>the</b> <b>logos</b> of both Atari and Kee Games, a subsidiary company set up by Atari in 1973 {{in order to reach}} more distributors, which was merged with Atari in December 1974. The game was announced and shown at the Music Operators of America (MOA) Music & Amusement Machines Exposition on November 1–3, 1974, for release that month. It was then advertised in the December 7 issue of Cash Box.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} sources {{used by the}} evangelist were the Jewish scriptures (the Tanakh, more or less identical with the Christian Old Testament), probably in the Greek translation. John quotes from them directly, references important figures from them, and uses narratives from them {{as the basis for}} several of the discourses. But the author was also familiar with non-Jewish sources: <b>the</b> <b>Logos</b> of the prologue (the Word that is with God from the beginning of creation) derives from both the Jewish concept of Lady Wisdom and from the Greek philosophers, while John 6 alludes not only to the exodus but also to Greco-Roman mystery cults, while John 4 alludes to Samaritan messianic beliefs.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>logo</b> of <b>the</b> 1999 Southeast Asian Games is {{an image}} of a torch, the symbol of the Games that {{represents}} vitality, sportsmanship and tradition. <b>The</b> <b>logo</b> that is coloured in red, yellow and green symbolises the excitement of the games. The ten interlinked gold rings, <b>the</b> <b>logo</b> of <b>the</b> Southeast Asian Games Federation represents the participating nations of the Southeast Asian Games, and the Southeast Asian Games itself. The gold colour of <b>the</b> <b>logo</b> represents quality, achievement and victory. <b>The</b> games' <b>logo</b> is <b>the</b> first <b>logo</b> in Southeast Asian Games history to use the 10-ring chain which last until the 2011 games.|$|R
5|$|After {{creating}} custom plugins for the 3D {{computer graphics}} software, Burrows {{claimed that the}} team could create and test entire race tracks within five minutes. The custom plugin used for creating tracks consisted of a 450 kilobyte file, which contained polygon subdividing and data on artificial intelligence, effectively cutting down the time to create tracks from six hours to five minutes. In order to the play the game as soon as possible, the team developed the user interface in the XML markup language, which allowed revisions {{to be made for}} the content at any time. However, Burrows recalled that the only downside to converting everything to XML was that the game was always in danger of becoming too large for the PlayStation Portable's Universal Media Disc. The game's cover art was designed by Popgun, who also designed <b>the</b> <b>logos</b> for games released by EA Sports.|$|E
5|$|Clement {{begins the}} fourth {{book with a}} belated {{explanation}} of the disorganized nature of the work, and gives {{a brief description of}} his aims for the remaining three or four books. The fourth book focuses on martyrdom. While all good Christians should be unafraid of death, Clement condemns those who actively seek out a martyr's death, arguing {{that they do not have}} sufficient respect for God's gift of life. He is ambivalent whether any believing Christian can become a martyr by virtue of the manner of their death, or whether martyrdom is reserved for those who have lived exceptional lives. Marcionites cannot become martyrs, because they do not believe in the divinity of God the Father – their sufferings are in vain. There is then a digression to the subject of theological epistemology. According to Clement, there is no way of empirically testing the existence of God the Father, because <b>the</b> <b>Logos</b> has revelatory, not analysable meaning, although Christ was an object of the senses. God had no beginning, and is the universal first principle.|$|E
5|$|Most Christians {{believe that}} Jesus was {{both human and}} the Son of God. While there has been {{theological}} debate over his nature, Some early Christians viewed Jesus as subordinate to the Father, and others considered him {{an aspect of the}} Father rather than a separate person. The Church resolved the issues in ancient councils, which established the Holy Trinity, with Jesus both fully human and fully God. Trinitarian Christians generally believe that Jesus is <b>the</b> <b>Logos,</b> God's incarnation and God the Son, both fully divine and fully human. However, the doctrine of the Trinity is not universally accepted among Christians. With the Protestant Reformation, Christians such as Michael Servetus and the Socinians started questioning the ancient creeds that had established Jesus' two natures. Nontrinitarian Christian groups include The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Unitarians and Jehovah's Witnesses.|$|E
