25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s Tyco Toys created {{a line of}} action figures called The Incredible Crash Dummies based on the {{characters}} from the NHTSA television advertisements. They were intended to fall apart at the <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>button</b> on their abdomens. Vehicles which could be crashed into walls and broken were also produced. Dummies and vehicles were easily reassembled. They prompted a one-hour television special, The Adventures of the Incredible Crash Dummies. Unique for its time, the cartoon was produced entirely using 3D computer animation techniques. A comic book series and a video game for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Game Boy were produced.|$|E

500|$|The GTS has usually used a more {{powerful}} engine and robust drivetrain than other HSV models, however the E-Series 1 GTS shared the 6.0L LS2 V8 engine with 412bhp (307kW) of power and 405lb·ft (550 N·m) of torque, with the cheaper Clubsport and the luxury Senator. The major difference between the E-Series GTS and other HSV models in the range is the Magnetic Ride Control (MRC, or [...] "MagneRide"). MRC utilises magnetorheological dampers to improve the car's handling and dynamics.

500|$|In 2014, CIM {{began moving}} forward with adding a rental {{residential}} tower atop Block 37. In March 2014, rumors began that an apartment building exceeding 500 units was being planned. On September 11, CIM issued a press release that it had obtained permits for a 34-story, 690-unit apartment tower, which Crain's Chicago Business described as [...] "the biggest apartment tower the Loop has seen in decades". The official commencement of the glass-walled project was on October 29 with expected completion by Summer 2016 to include amenities such as outdoor pool and spa, plus a rooftop spa and fitness center. At the time the retail spaces were only 52 percent occupied. The apartment building construction eliminated the {{plans to build a}} hotel atop the structure. The apartment building construction coincided with plans to bring an 11-screen AMC Theatres dine-in movie theater to the building. The 4th floor AMC theater opened its doors on December 17, 2015 as scheduled as the Loop's only major chain movie theatre. The theatre is Chicago's first Dine-In Theatre in which patrons order food by the <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>button</b> from their seats. On June 1, 2016, the 38-story, 690-unit Marquee at Block 37 opened at 25 West Randolph, marking the conclusion of construction at Block 37.|$|E

As {{the reliance on}} innovation increments, individuals require the capability to contemplate trivial errands and {{need to focus on}} other pertinent issues. This sort of interest must be met by a framework equipped for rapidly, exactly, and dependably translating the needs of the client and actualizing suitable movements independently. The Remote Controlled Garage Door exploit the utilization of current innovations to give such a framework. The general idea driving is to actualize a framework where the client is no more fundamentally answerable for deciding the activity, yet rather an order module screens the movement, the garage door needs to be performing and makes the fitting modification. In an age where no one has much time for things like coming {{out of the car and}} opening garage door, a remote control garage door steps up for the solution of their problem. The research project for a garage door that can be opened with <b>a</b> mere <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> remote control <b>button</b> is studied, reviewed and its prototype has been developed. For the development purpose the problems faced by the users are identified, detailed specifications of the product parts are done and a working prototype has been fabricated...|$|R
40|$|A {{perfectly}} balanced wine {{can be said}} {{to create}} a symphony in the mouth. To achieve the sublime, both in wine and music, requires imagination and skilled orchestration of artistic craftmanship. For wine, inventiveness starts in the vineyard. Similar to <b>a</b> composer <b>of</b> music, the grapegrower produces grapes through <b>a</b> multitude <b>of</b> specifications to achieve a quality result. Different Vitis vinifera grape varieties allow the creation of wine of different genres. Akin to <b>a</b> conductor <b>of</b> music, the winemaker decides what genre to create and considers resources required to realise the grape’s potential. A primary consideration is the yeast: whether to inoculate the grape juice or leave it ‘wild’; whether to inoculate with <b>a</b> specific strain <b>of</b> Saccharomyces or <b>a</b> combination <b>of</b> Saccharomyces strains; or whether to proceed with a non-Saccharomyces species? Whilst the various Saccharomyces and non-Saccharomyces yeasts perform their role during fermentation, the performance is not over until the ‘fat lady’ (S. cerevisiae) has sung (i. e., the grape sugar has been fermented to specified dryness and alcoholic fermentation is complete). Is the wine harmonious or discordant? Will the consumer demand an encore and make a repeat purchase? Understanding consumer needs lets winemakers orchestrate different symphonies (i. e., wine styles) using single- or multi-species ferments. Some consumers will choose the sounds <b>of</b> <b>a</b> philharmonic orchestra comprising <b>a</b> great range <b>of</b> diverse instrumentalists (as is the case with wine created from spontaneous fermentation); some will prefer to listen to a smaller ensemble (analogous to wine produced by <b>a</b> selected group <b>of</b> non-Saccharomyces and Saccharomyces yeast); and others will favour the well-known and reliable superstar soprano (i. e., S. cerevisiae). But what if a digital music synthesizer—such as a synthetic yeast—becomes available that can produce any music genre with the purest of sounds by the <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> few <b>buttons?</b> Will synthesisers spoil the character of the music and lead to the loss of the much-lauded romantic mystique? Or will music synthesisers support composers and conductors to create novel compositions and even higher quality performances that will thrill audiences? This article explores these and other relevant questions in the context of winemaking and the role that yeast and its genomics play in the betterment of wine quality...|$|R

2500|$|The {{later years}} of this {{generation}} of Toronado saw new features mostly confined to minor styling tweaks to the grille and trim, although in 1977, the XS and XSR models debuted. Both featured a three-sided, hot wire [...] "bent-glass" [...] rear window and, on the XSR, electric t-tops which slid inwards at the <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>button.</b> However, as built in prototype form, the XSR had no means of channeling water away from the retractable sections, and water would inevitably leak into the cabin. No workable {{solution to the problem}} was found, and as such, the XSR model was scrapped. The XS, which did enter production, was offered with GM's more reliable (and no doubt more leak-resistant) Astroroof sliding sunroof instead. Air conditioning was standard.|$|E

2500|$|As a result, {{sections}} of the Abwehr were incorporated into RSHA Amt VI SD-Ausland and therefore placed under Schellenberg's command. Assumption of these powers made Schellenberg the [...] "absolute master" [...] of Nazi intelligence". He was infamous for his [...] "office fortress" [...] desk, which had two automatic guns built into it that could be fired by the <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>button.</b> According to the memoirs of SS intelligence officer Wilhelm Hoettl, Schellenberg was very suspicious of Gestapo Chief Müller, whom {{he claimed to have}} evidence against by way of radio surveillance recordings (allegedly revealing Müller's plans to work with the Russians); when he informed then RSHA chief Ernst Kaltenbrunner of possessing proof to that end, he was ignored. Kaltenbrunner disliked Schellenberg, perhaps due to his direct access to Himmler, and complained about him in particular on a number of occasions. Despite Kaltenbrunner's animosity towards Schellenberg, the latter's soothing manners kept him in good graces with Himmler and allowed him to [...] "retain the ear of the SS overlord".|$|E
