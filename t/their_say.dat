5|$|The battleground {{proved to}} be the Midwest—the South and most of the West were conceded to Bryan—and the Democrat spent much of his time in those crucial states. The Northeast was {{considered}} most likely safe for McKinley after the early-voting states of Maine and Vermont supported him in September. By then, it was clear that public support for silver had receded, and McKinley began to emphasize the tariff issue. By the end of September, the Republicans had discontinued printing material on the silver issue, and were entirely concentrating on the tariff question. On November 3, 1896, the voters had <b>their</b> <b>say.</b> McKinley won the entire Northeast and Midwest; he won 51% of the vote and an ample majority in the Electoral College. Bryan had concentrated entirely on the silver issue, and had not appealed to urban workers. Voters in cities supported McKinley; the only city outside the South of more than 100,000 population carried by Bryan was Denver, Colorado.|$|E

Kemp was named an AFL All-Star in 1969 for the seventh time in the league's 10 years. He advocated recognition of the league, and in its last year, 1969, lobbied Pete Rozelle to have AFL teams wear an AFL patch to honor it. In 1969, the Erie County Republican Party approached him about running for the United States Congress. After the January 17, 1970, AFL All-Star game, Kemp returned home and talked to his wife before deciding to enter politics.

[...] On Tuesday, November 3, the voters had <b>their</b> <b>say</b> in most states. [...] McKinley won 271 electoral votes to Bryan's 176. [...] The Democratic candidate won in the South and in the western states except California and Oregon. [...] Bryan was also successful in his native Nebraska and neighboring Kansas and South Dakota. [...] McKinley swept the populous northeastern states, and the Midwest. [...] He had hoped to end sectionalism, but his only successes in the [...] "Solid South" [...] were in the border states of Delaware, Maryland, West Virginia and Kentucky. [...] McKinley took 51.0% of the vote, the first presidential majority since Grant in 1872; the intense voter interest in the campaign resulted in a turnout of 79.3%. [...] On Election Night, Hanna wired from Cleveland to Canton, [...] "The feeling here beggars description ... I will not attempt bulletins.

Regarding the recording sessions, drummer Jack Irons said, [...] "We didn't put any time limit on it. It was like, 'When this record's done, we call it a record.' We took out time to come up with ideal sounds and feel for every song, so that each had its own identity. We would cut a track and go back and listen to it and openly discuss it." [...] Ament stated that [...] "Yield was a superfun record to make. And so much of it was Ed kind of sitting back." [...] He added that [...] "everybody really {{got a little bit of}} <b>their</b> <b>say</b> on the record...because of that, everybody feels like they're an integral part of the band." [...] The band discussed the album's production on the documentary Single Video Theory.|$|E
500|$|Mark Washburn of Knight Ridder {{wrote that}} at the time of the episode's broadcast, most Americans were {{accustomed}} to seeing homosexual characters on television. He said this is why Patty's coming-out did not become as controversial as the episode's examination of the same-sex marriage issue, which was more sensitive in the country then. The controversy became so big that local news programs in certain cities aired segments about it. In response to the claims that this episode was supporting gay marriage, Al Jean replied that [...] "we don't really take any positions for or against anything, we just like to examine all sides of an issue and I think that anyone who would get their political wisdom from a cartoon might be sadly mistaken." [...] Likewise, Mark Pinsky writes in The Gospel According to The Simpsons that once the episode ended, it was hard to tell what stance on same-sex marriage the writers had and that [...] "both sides of the controversy had <b>their</b> <b>say,</b> voiced by various Simpsons characters". Jean has also cited the episode in defense to critics who say The Simpsons has lost its relevance and edginess in later years. In his book , John Ortved responded to this, commenting that despite the controversies the episode was [...] "in fact a long-winded and lame exploration of the topic." ...|$|E

500|$|Under the Local Government Act 1972, the town's Urban District {{status was}} abolished, {{and the area}} has, since 1 April 1974, formed part of the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham, a local {{government}} district of the metropolitan county of Greater Manchester. [...] A civil parish of Crompton was formed in April 1987 and renamed to [...] "Shaw and Crompton" [...] in July 1987. [...] The civil parish has its own parish council, giving it some limited local government autonomy {{from that of the}} wider Metropolitan Borough of Oldham, and including the status as a statutory consultee on local planning applications. The council comprises 14 locally elected members, councillor Ann Tindall is the parish chairman 2017-2018 and is consulted in planning applications that affect the area through the Shaw and Royton Area Committee of Oldham Metropolitan Borough Council. Shaw and Crompton Community Council, a separate body, meets at least four times per year and is designed to allow local people to put forward their priorities for the area in which they live, suggest improvements and have <b>their</b> <b>say</b> on how services are run on a local basis. Shaw and Crompton does not have a mayor, but does have a town crier, a purely ceremonial role.

500|$|Following {{the short}} tour for No Code, the band {{went into the}} studio in 1997 to record its follow-up. The {{sessions}} for the band's fifth album represented more of a team effort between {{all members of the}} group, with Ament stating that [...] "everybody really {{got a little bit of}} <b>their</b> <b>say</b> on the record...because of that, everybody feels like they're an integral part of the band." [...] On February 3, 1998, Pearl Jam released its fifth album, Yield. The album was cited as a return to the band's early, straightforward rock sound. Tom Sinclair of Entertainment Weekly stated that the band has [...] "turned in an intermittently affecting album that veers between fiery garage rock and rootsy, acoustic-based ruminations. Perhaps mindful of their position as the last alt-rock ambassadors with any degree of clout, they've come up with their most cohesive album since their 1991 debut, Ten." [...] Lyrically, Yield continued with the more contemplative type of writing found on No Code, with Vedder saying, [...] "What was rage in the past has become reflection." [...] Yield debuted at number two on the Billboard charts, but like No Code soon began dropping down the charts. It included the singles [...] "Given to Fly" [...] and [...] "Wishlist". The band hired comic book artist Todd McFarlane to create an animated video for the song [...] "Do the Evolution" [...] from the album, its first music video since 1992. A documentary detailing the making of Yield, Single Video Theory, was released on VHS and DVD later that year.|$|E

[...] He further stated that [...] "The imperialists are always prepared to pay thirty pieces of silver to those who split the Communist ranks." [...] To this Hoxha replied in a November 7 speech, [...] "the Albanian people and their Party of Labor will even live on grass if need be, but they will never sell themselves 'for 30 pieces of silver'... They would rather die honourably on their feet than live in shame on their knees." [...] Nicholas C. Pano noted that [...] " [...] pronouncements , at least insofar as the Soviet leadership was concerned, had made the policies of de-Stalinization, peaceful coexistence, and reconciliation with Yugoslavia adopted at the Twentieth Congress of the CPSU binding upon the members of the communist system." [...] Despite Albanian calls for the continued existence of state relations between the two countries, the Soviet government formally withdrew its ambassador on November 25 and on December 3 withdrew [...] "the whole personnel of its embassy and commercial representation from the PRA, {{while at the same time}} demanding that the personnel of the Albanian embassy and the Albanian commercial adviser should leave the territory of the Soviet Union." [...] "Thus," [...] the Albanian account continues, [...] "the Khrushchev revisionist group, consistent in its line, cut off all relations with socialist Albania at a time when it maintained contacts with and was drawing ever closer to the most reactionary regimes of the world." ...|$|E

500|$|Johnson and Christie's {{prospectus}} describes its reviewers as [...] "the HISTORIANS of the Republic of Letters" [...] Literary scholar Paul Keen {{has described}} the Republic of Letters as a vision of society in which [...] "all rational individuals could have <b>their</b> <b>say,</b> and in which an increasingly enlightened reading public {{would be able to}} judge the merit of different arguments for themselves". The practical goal of the Analytical Review was to facilitate this society by summarizing serious new and foreign publications in great depth so that intelligent readers might form their own opinions. This aim was embodied in its initial title: The Analytical Review; or, History of Literature, domestic and foreign, on an enlarged plan. Containing Scientific Abstracts of important and interesting Works, published in English; a general account of such as are of less consequence, with short characters; Notices, or Reviews of valuable foreign Books; Criticism on New pieces of Music and Works of Art; and the Literary Intelligence of Europe, etc. The periodical sought to avoid ephemeral works and to review only [...] "standard works which add to the stock of human knowledge and will live beyond a day". Johnson and Christie also intended to eschew editorializing and to avoid shaping the tastes of the public. Scrupulous attention to this point was meant to bring the reviewed work into the foreground and not the reviewer (a goal shared by many eighteenth-century journals). An early review, for example, criticized historian Edward Gibbon for [...] "so frequently and unnecessarily obtruding his particular prejudices on the eye of his readers". All editors signed their reviews with initials (sometimes not their own) rather than with their names. This practice was meant to prevent the appearance of collusion between the reviewers and the authors reviewed, although this did not succeed in practice. It was also intended to prevent any unethical puffing, or false advertising, of friends' or one's own books; nevertheless, both Henry Fuseli and Mary Wollstonecraft reviewed their own books for the journal.|$|E
