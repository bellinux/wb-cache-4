2500|$|According to Hegel, [...] "Heraclitus {{is the one}} {{who first}} {{declared}} the nature of the infinite and first grasped nature as in itself infinite, that is, its essence as process. The origin of philosophy is to be dated from Heraclitus. His is the persistent Idea that is the same in all philosophers up to the present day, as it was the Idea of Plato and Aristotle." [...] For Hegel, Heraclitus's great achievements were to have understood the nature of the infinite, which for Hegel includes understanding the inherent contradictoriness and negativity of reality, and to have grasped that reality is becoming or process, and that [...] "being" [...] and [...] "nothingness" [...] are mere empty abstractions. According to Hegel, Heraclitus's [...] "obscurity" [...] comes from his being a true (in Hegel's terms [...] "speculative") philosopher who grasped the ultimate philosophical truth and therefore expressed himself in a way <b>that</b> <b>goes</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> abstract and limited nature of common sense and is difficult to grasp by those who operate within common sense.

2500|$|One {{painting}} at least depicts an actress playing {{the part of}} Circe. This is Franz von Stuck’s striking portrait of [...] " [...] as Circe” (1913). She played this part in a Viennese revival of Calderon’s play in 1912 {{and there is a}} publicity still of her by Isidor Hirsch in which she is draped across a sofa and wearing an elaborate crown. Her enticing expression and the turn of her head there is almost exactly that of Van Stuck’s enchantress as she holds out the poisoned bowl. It suggests the use of certain posed publicity photos in creating the same iconic effect as had paintings in the past. A nearly contemporary example was the 1907 photo of Mme Geneviève Vix as Circe in the light opera by Lucien Hillenacher at the Opéra-Comique in Paris. The posing of the actress and the cropping of the image so as to highlight her luxurious costume demonstrates its ambition to create an effect <b>that</b> <b>goes</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> merely theatrical. A later example is the still of Silvana Mangano in her part as Circe in the 1954 film “Ulysses”, which is as cunningly posed for effect.|$|E

2500|$|Kovel pursues [...] "ecological production" [...] <b>that</b> <b>goes</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> socialist {{vision of}} the {{emancipation}} of labor to [...] "the realization of use-values and the appropriation of intrinsic value". He envisions a form of production in which [...] "the making of a thing {{becomes part of the}} thing made" [...] so that, using a high quality meal as an analogy, [...] "pleasure would obtain for the cooking of the meal" [...] – thus activities [...] "reserved as hobbies under capitalism" [...] would [...] "compose the fabric of everyday life" [...] under eco-socialism. This, for Kovel, is achieved if labor is [...] "freely chosen and developed... with a fully realized use-value" [...] achieved by a [...] "negation" [...] of exchange-value, and he exemplifies the Food Not Bombs project for adopting this. He believes that the notion of [...] "mutual recognition... for the process as well as the product" [...] will avoid exploitation and hierarchy. With production allowing humanity to [...] "live more directly and receptively embedded in nature", Kovel predicts that [...] "a reorientation of human need" [...] will occur that recognises ecological limits and sees technology as [...] "fully participant in the life of eco-systems", thus removing it from profit-making exercises.|$|E
2500|$|Heavy Rain was {{critically}} acclaimed. The UK Official PlayStation Magazine reviewer Tim Clark wrote, [...] "I'm convinced it's {{one of the}} freshest, most exciting, {{and even}} important games on PS3 so far." [...] Clark praised the effective controls of the game, {{as well as the}} pacing of the story, which the reviewer described as key, and perfectly designed to create an [...] "exhausting, exhilarating, and, crucially, involving" [...] experience. He concluded by saying that, [...] "Certainly there's nothing quite like it on PS3, or indeed any other system. Put gaming conventions aside, go in with no expectations other than this is something new and massively good-looking, and you'll be rewarded with a unique experience that lurches between genius and madness, manages to be genuinely emotional, and that you'll be bursting to talk about with your friends." [...] GamesMaster complimented Heavy Rain for being [...] "incredibly original and compelling", as [...] "the atmosphere is incredible – full of driving rain (which becomes central to the plot), fizzing neon lights, dark apartments and warehouses. It's a dark noir game, not a bright adventure." [...] The game was given a GamesMaster Gold Award. IGN's Chris Roper praised the game's [...] "fantastic story that's {{one of the best in}} gaming." [...] However, he pointed out that the game's beginning is very slow, and might turn off some players. GameZone's Michael Lafferty wrote, [...] "There are some flaws, but taken as a package, Heavy Rain is a remarkable achievement in gaming that creates an interactive experience <b>that</b> <b>goes</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> pages of a good novel or film noir. This is a game that needs to be experienced." [...] Winda Benedetti wrote about the maturity of Heavy Rain as well as Remedy Entertainment's psychological action thriller Alan Wake for MSNBC, praising both titles for being [...] "emotionally powerful" [...] as well as having [...] "said goodbye to the tired alien invasions and over-the-top fantasy stories so often found in video games.
