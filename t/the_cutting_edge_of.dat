The breeding male is not easily confused with any other birds except the chestnut weaver, which is substantially larger and has white on its wings. The breeding male's legs and feet are horn (pale grey) in colour. The non-breeding male chestnut sparrow has white flecking on the upperparts, and much of its plumage is buff or whitish with chestnut crescent markings, until the bright chestnut of {{the breeding}} plumage is exposed by wear.

The {{root of the}} lower incisors extends though the mandible (lower jaw) to a low capsular process {{at the back of}} the jawbone. The molars are brachyodont (low-crowned) and bear distinct cusps. The second molars, although decidedly smaller than the first, are similar in their crown morphology, but the much smaller third molars are reduced and more distinct from the first molars in morphology. The molars lack accessory crests and other features. Each of the upper molars is three-rooted, whereas the lowers have two roots. The molars are quite similar to those of Macrotarsomys, and differ only in minor details.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. After the {{grinding}} process, <b>the</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> cemented carbide milling tools tend to chipping. Chipping {{has a strong}} influence on the tool performance. For this reason, <b>the</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edges</b> are further prepared. Additionally, a <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> rounding {{has an impact on}} the wear behavior and the process stability. For <b>the</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> preparation <b>of</b> milling tools, magnetic finishing is a promising process. This paper describes the process of magnetic finishing.

Furthermore, the effect of magnetic finishing on the tool life is demonstrated using the example of a milling process with titanium...|$|R

30|$|In {{industrial}} machining of timber, {{the method}} {{in which the}} operator visually inspects both wear and chippings of router bits after stopping the machine is generally adopted. However, many working hours are lost in this method and productivity suffers.

In this study, a laser measuring instrument was installed in a computerized numerically controlled (CNC) router, and an automatic measurement system for <b>the</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> profile <b>of</b> throw-away-type straight bits with single-edged blades was developed. The main results are summarized as follows: (1) an automatic measurement system for <b>the</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> profile <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bit was constructed; (2) this system was composed of a laser measuring instrument, a control personal computer (PC) for the CNC router, and a monitoring PC to control some devices and collect sampling data; (3) the system could measure <b>the</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> profile <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bit without stopping the CNC router.|$|R
