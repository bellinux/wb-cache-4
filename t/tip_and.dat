5|$|In tarsiers, the sublingua {{does not}} have {{serrations}} along its <b>tip</b> <b>and</b> is much simpler and generalized in structure, making it clearly distinguishable {{from that of the}} lemuriform primates. The tarsier has a distinct plica mediana and its plicae fimbriatae are large and stick to the entire underside of the tongue. The plica sublingualis is also prominent.|$|E
5|$|Originating {{below the}} fourth pair of gill slits, the {{pectoral}} fins are short, broad, and falcate (sickle-shaped) with pointed tips. The first dorsal fin {{is tall and}} falcate with a distinctively long free rear <b>tip,</b> <b>and</b> is positioned just behind the pectoral fin bases. The second dorsal fin is large and tall without a notably elongated free rear <b>tip,</b> <b>and</b> is positioned over or slightly behind the anal fin. Usually there is no midline ridge between the dorsal fins, and when present the ridge is slight. The caudal peduncle has a deep crescent-shaped notch at the upper caudal fin origin. The asymmetrical caudal fin has a well-developed lower lobe and a longer upper lobe with a notch in the trailing margin near the tip.|$|E
5|$|The first pereiopod is {{modified}} into {{a strong}} cheliped (claw-bearing leg): the claw's fingers, the dactylus and propodus, are black at the tips. The other pereiopods {{are covered with}} rows of short stiff setae; the dactylus of each is black towards the <b>tip,</b> <b>and</b> ends in a sharp point.|$|E

40|$|We {{present an}} optimal-control model where tipping {{behavior}} creates reputation that affects future service. <b>Tipping</b> <b>and</b> reputation can evolve in four path prototypes: converging to an interior equilibrium; converging to minimum <b>tips</b> <b>and</b> reputation; and two prototypes that start differently but end with <b>tips</b> <b>and</b> reputation increasing indefinitely. Analyzing the interior equilibrium suggests that when reputation erodes more quickly (capturing lower patronage frequency), equilibrium reputation is lower. Interestingly, however, tips may be higher. Increasing the minimal tip raises tips {{by the same}} increase, and does not change reputation. A more patient customer leaves higher <b>tips</b> <b>and</b> reaches a higher reputation. ...|$|R

5|$|Flaming arrows {{required}} the shooter to get {{quite close to}} their desired target and most will have extinguished themselves before reaching the target. In response, another form of fire arrow was developed which consisted of curved metal bars connecting a <b>tip</b> <b>and</b> hollow end for the shaft. The resulting cage was filled with hot coals or other solid object which could be fired from a much stronger bow or ballista without fear of extinguishing and {{would be used to}} ignite straw or thatch roofs from a safer distance.|$|E
5|$|Generally duller and paler, {{the female}} {{has a more}} uniform and paler blue face, with highly {{contrasting}} cream bare skin around the eye. It lacks the red shoulder band, and the blue shoulder markings are darker and less distinct. The throat and chest are pale green and the belly is yellow. The upper mandible is paler brown-grey with a darker <b>tip,</b> <b>and</b> has been recorded as black while nesting. The lower mandible is pale grey to almost white. When flying, the female has a broad white bar visible on the underwing.|$|E
5|$|Hanigan {{spent the}} entire 2009 season with the Reds except for five games with the Bats. He served as the backup catcher to Ramón Hernández until Hernández {{underwent}} knee surgery and {{was placed on the}} DL. Hanigan went on the DL after he was hit on the face mask by a foul <b>tip</b> <b>and</b> suffered a concussion; he returned on August 8, 2009. For the season, Hanigan had the best fielding percentage as a catcher (.998), and the second best caught stealing percentage (42.9) in the majors.|$|E

5|$|The Pondicherry shark (Carcharhinus hemiodon) is an {{extremely}} rare species of requiem shark, in the family Carcharhinidae. A small and stocky gray shark, it grows not much longer than , {{and it has a}} fairly long, pointed snout. This species can be identified by the shape of its upper teeth, which are strongly serrated near the base and smooth-edged near the <b>tip,</b> <b>and</b> by its first dorsal fin, which is large with a long free rear tip. Furthermore, this shark has prominent black tips on its pectoral fins, second dorsal fin, and caudal fin lower lobe.|$|E
5|$|The SS195LF is {{a commercially}} {{available}} cartridge {{that features a}} lead-free primer and produces ballistics similar to the SS192 round, which it replaced in late 2004. It uses the same 1.8-g (28grain) copper-jacketed aluminum core bullet as the SS192, {{and it can be}} identified by the unmarked, hollow void at the <b>tip</b> <b>and</b> the silver-colored primer. The SS195 is classified by the ATF as not armor-piercing, and it is currently manufactured by FN Herstal in Belgium.|$|E
5|$|The {{bills of}} bee-eaters are curved, long and {{end in a}} sharp point.

The short legs have weak feet, and when it is moving on the ground a bee-eater's gait is barely more than a shuffle. The feet have sharp claws used for perching on vertical surfaces and also for nest excavation.|$|E

5|$|The engines power an 18.59metre {{diameter}} five-bladed main rotor. The {{rotor blades}} are constructed from carbon/glass with nomex honeycomb and rohacell foam, edged with titanium alloy in a sandwich construction. The shaping {{of the main}} rotor blades {{is derived from the}} BERP rotor blades first used on the Westland Lynx. This blade design improves aerodynamic efficiency at the blade <b>tip</b> <b>and</b> reduces the acoustic signature. Improved BERP IV rotors have since been developed; when installed, this increases the AW101's maximum takeoff weight.|$|E
5|$|The {{king vulture}} has, {{relative}} to its size, the largest skull and braincase, and strongest bill of the New World vultures. This bill has a hooked <b>tip</b> <b>and</b> a sharp cutting edge. The bird has broad wings and a short, broad, and square tail. The irises of its eyes are white and bordered by bright red sclera. Unlike some New World vultures, the king vulture lacks eyelashes. It also has gray legs and long, thick claws.|$|E
5|$|The spores are smooth, {{narrowly}} fusiform (fuse-shaped), {{and measure}} 7–12 by 3–5µm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) measure 20–28 by 6–8µm and are hyaline (translucent), four-spored, and narrowly club-shaped, with many internal oil droplets. Cystidia are fusiform, sometimes with a rounded <b>tip,</b> <b>and</b> have dimensions of 30–50 by 9–12µm. Some {{are more or}} less hyaline, while others are encrusted with a golden pigment. The cap cuticle is a trichodermium, an arrangement in which the outermost hyphae emerge roughly parallel, like hairs, perpendicular to the cap surface. These hyphae are 10–17µm wide and have elliptical to cylindrical cells at their ends that are not gelatinous. Clamp connections are absent from the hyphae.|$|E

5|$|A spine is a sharp, {{needle-like}} structure used {{to inflict}} pain on predators. An {{example of this}} seen in nature is in the Sohal surgeonfish. These fish have a sharp scalpel-like spine {{on the front of}} each of their tail fins, able to inflict deep wounds. The area around the spines is often brightly colored to advertise the defensive capability; predators often avoid the Sohal surgeonfish. Defensive spines may be detachable, barbed or poisonous. Porcupine spines are long, stiff, break at the <b>tip,</b> <b>and</b> are barbed to stick into a would-be predator. In contrast, the hedgehog's short spines, which are modified hairs, readily bend, and are barbed into the body, so they are not easily lost; they may be jabbed at an attacker.|$|E
5|$|But Melody's {{love of the}} sea proves {{too strong}} and she visits Morgana, who turns her into a mermaid temporarily. King Triton uses his trident to {{transform}} Ariel back into her own mermaid form to find and rescue Melody. Morgana tricks Melody into {{taking part in a}} plot to steal her grandfather King Triton's trident. Together with Tip the Penguin and Dash the Walrus she goes to Atlantica and succeeds in acquiring the trident. Ariel arrives as they return with it to Morgana, and tries to persuade Melody to give back the trident. Morgana captures Ariel, tightly wrapping her tentacle around Ariel's mouth and body. She then seals Melody behind a block wall. <b>Tip</b> <b>and</b> Dash rescue Melody and Ariel manages to free themselves. Morgana then uses the trident's magic to force everyone to bow before her.|$|E
5|$|Cardiff's {{first ground}} was at Sophia Gardens {{recreational}} park where they played from their founding in 1899 until 1910 when, {{due to the}} lack of facilities at the ground and the increasing amount of support for the club, Bartley Wilson contacted Bute Estate, who owned large amounts of Cardiff at the time, in an attempt to find land suitable for building a stadium. They eventually agreed on an area of waste ground on Sloper Road. The land was a former rubbish <b>tip</b> <b>and</b> required extensive work to get a playable surface, but with the assistance of Cardiff Corporation and volunteers the work was completed. The ground was originally to be known as Sloper Park but was instead named after Lord Ninian Crichton-Stuart, who was a large force in helping the club get the ground built, and became Ninian Park. The ground hosted its first match on 1 September 1910 with a friendly against Aston Villa, with the kick-off being performed by Lord Crichton-Stuart.|$|E

5|$|Females {{have the}} same plumage pattern as males, though with {{somewhat}} duller colouration. The female has a grey head; buff supercilium, chin, and throat; black and warm brown upperparts; and off-white underparts. The bill of the female is pale yellow with the <b>tip</b> <b>and</b> cutting edge of mandible dusky. Juveniles are dull grey with a brown back, a pale yellow supercilium, and a pale horn bill. Females and juveniles have hints of chestnut on their supercilium, shoulders, and throat, by which they may be distinguished from other sparrows, such as the Kenya sparrow and the other rufous sparrows, which are common {{in much of the}} chestnut sparrow's range; or the house sparrow, which also occurs in parts of its range.|$|E
5|$|Four {{specimens}} (MACN Pv-RN 702A through 702D) {{are thought}} to represent second upper incisors (I2) of Ferugliotherium. 702A (height 1.5mm; width 1.1mm) and 702B are slightly larger than 702C (height 1.2mm; width 0.9mm) and 702D. The smaller incisors cannot be lateral incisors (I3), because 702C's wear facet is stronger than would be expected in an I3; therefore, all four upper incisors are identified as central incisors (I2). To explain the size difference, Krause and colleagues suggested that Ferugliotherium was variable in size or that the smaller incisors were deciduous precursors of the larger permanent tooth. They considered it less likely that multiple species with similar incisors were present. The upper incisors have enamel only on the dorsal side. The wear facet at the tip is preserved only in 702C, forming an angle of 52° with the dorsal side, and is more concave than the facet in the lower incisors. 702A–D are recognizable as upper incisors {{because they have a}} less acute angle at the <b>tip</b> <b>and</b> are less laterally compressed, more curved, and elliptical in cross section.|$|E
5|$|Hindfoot {{length is}} 37mm (1.5in). The upper {{sides of the}} feet are covered with grayish white fur, which extends around the claws to form ungual tufts. On the hindfeet, the fifth digit is {{relatively}} short at 6mm (0.2in); the hallux (first digit) is 8mm (0.3in) long, and the other digits 11 to 12mm (0.4 to 0.5in). The tail is 238mm (9.4in) long and naked in part. At the base, it is dark brown both above and below, but slightly lighter below. The upper side remains dark brown for much of its length, though the color does become lighter towards the tip. The lower side becomes mottled at about 55mm (2.2in) from the <b>tip</b> <b>and</b> then whitish at about 65mm (2.6in). It has a well-developed tuft at its tail tip, consisting of whitish and occasional light brown hairs. This tuft commences at about 130mm (5.1in) from the base with fairly short hairs and becomes more pronounced at 180mm (7.1in). In contrast, the greater big-footed mouse has a weaker, dark brown tuft.|$|E
