As a result, these systems may come to be characterised by vast arrays of largely identical devices that are differentiated via postfabrication configuration – but only if low-overhead configuration can be achieved. Two simulation studies are presented that describe some ideas for achieving low-overhead reconfigurability in systems built from nano-scale components. The first is based on variable-threshold devices built from thin-body double gate transistors while a second, more speculative idea is based on recently identified resonant tunneling behaviour in carbon nanotubes.

The multiplier consists of quadrupler stage {{followed by a}} high pass filter, an inter-stage amplifier and a doubler stage. The required output power is achieved by a two stage buffer amplifier on the output. An output power exceeding 7 dBm is achieved from 52 to 61 GHz. The rejection of the unwanted harmonics is better than 28 dB and the detected degradation of phase noise due to the circuit is less than 1 dB at 100 kHz offset from the carrier, compared to a theoretical value of 18. 06 dB for a multiplier by eight. The bias configuration is optimized {{to reduce the number}} of <b>the</b> <b>required</b> <b>bias</b> <b>voltages</b> to three. The total power dissipation is 450 mW.

40|$|Abstract—Backgate biasing is a {{promising}} technique for high speed systems. Leakage {{can be reduced}} during standby periods by reverse bias while adequate bias in active mode can balance process and temperature variations. This technique introduces no delay penalty in active mode but slow wake up time results in system performance degradation. In this paper, we demonstrate a circuit that provides fast charging of the backgate through a large MOSFET directly connected to the supply. A circuit based on a mirror delay is used to precisely turn off this MOSFET when the backgate <b>voltage</b> has reached <b>the</b> <b>required</b> <b>bias</b> <b>voltage</b> for active mode operation. A nonlinearity compensation operation is implemented to guarantee precise control of the timing despite a non-constant backgate charging rate during transition due to nonlinear backgate capacitance.

In {{the case of the}} core-shell structure, we show that both electrons and holes of high density can be efficiently injected into and confined in the structure even without an i-region. <b>The</b> <b>required</b> <b>bias</b> <b>voltage</b> and doping concentrations in the core-shell structure are smaller than those in the longitudinal p-i-n structure to achieve the same carrier injection level. Furthermore, we show that a type-Ι band alignment, as required in traditional p-i-n structure is not necessary in core-shell structure, allowing more flexibility in nanowire devices design. Our results thus provide a theoretical foundation and understanding that a core-shell structure is far superior to the longitudinal p-i-n structure for electrical injection nanowire lasers.

40|$|Since {{the advent}} of precise {{semiconductor}} engineering techniques in the 1960 s, considerable effort has been devoted both in academia and private industry to the fabrication and testing of complex structures. In addition to other techniques, molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) {{has made it possible}} to create devices with single mono-layer accuracy. This facilitates the design of precise band structures and the selection of specific spectroscopic properties for light source materials. The applications of such engineered structures have made solid state devices common commercial quantities. These applications include solid state lasers, light emitting diodes and light sensors. Band gap engineering has been used to design emitters for many wavelength bands, including the short wavelength (SWIR) infrared region which ranges from 1. 5 to 2. 5 μm [1]. Practical devices include sensors operating in the 2 - 2. 5 μm range. When designing such a device, necessary concerns include <b>the</b> <b>required</b> <b>bias</b> <b>voltage,</b> operating current, input impedance and especially for emitters, the wall-plug efficiency. Three types of engineered structures are considered in this thesis. These include GaInAsSb quaternary alloy bulk active regions, GaInAsSb multiple quantum well devices (MQW) and GaInAsSb cascaded light emitting diodes. The three structures are evaluated according to specific standards applied to emitters of infrared light. The spectral profiles are obtained with photo or electro-luminescence, for the purpose of locating the peak emission wavelength. The peak wavelength for these specimens is in the 2. 2 - 2. 5 μm window. The emission efficiency is determined by employing three empirical techniques: current/voltage (IV), radiance/current (LI), and carrier lifetime measurements. The first verifies that the structure has the correct electrical properties, by measuring among other parameters the activation voltage. The second is used to determine the energy efficiency of the device, including the wall-plug and quantum efficiencies. The last provides estimates of the relative magnitude of the Shockley Read Hall, radiative and Auger coefficients. These constants illustrate the overall radiative efficiency of the material, by noting comparisons between radiative and non-radiative recombination rates...|$|R
40|$|As {{portable}} devices {{are required to}} operate in different frequency bands and work under changing environ- ment conditions, reconfigurable RF devices, which <b>required</b> high <b>biasing</b> <b>voltages</b> above 100 V, are used in RF frond-end to achieve the multi-bands functionality. The size and cost of discrete circuits are not accept- able for most hand-held devices. Thus, high voltage ASIC, which can be easily integrated and powered by a battery, is a better solution to provide the <b>biasing</b> <b>voltage.</b> High voltage ASIC design {{is a relatively new}} field in chip design. To support safe operation voltage above 100 V, sophisticated physical structures with multiple isolation layers, extra drain region and thick oxidation gate are used in high voltage technologies and result in worse performance than designs with low voltage technologies. Thus, chip size, cost, power consumption and performance become the biggest challenges of the proposed design. In this dissertation, two high voltage ASIC designs used to provide the <b>biasing</b> <b>voltage</b> for tunable components in communication systems are proposed. These ASICs can operate with a high voltage power supply generated by an on-chip DC-DC converter. Both designs are simulated in Cadence, implemented in AMS H 35 and experimentally tested. The first ASIC is 8 -bits high voltage DAC designed in segmented architecture with a Segmented Tran- sistor Only DAC and a high voltage Miller-compensated Amplifier to boost up the output of the low voltage DAC to the expected high voltage. It can provide the <b>biasing</b> <b>voltage</b> for tunable devices up to 115 V with 256 voltage steps. The INL and DNL of the HV DAC are 0. 48 LSB and 0. 38 LSB, respectively. The power consumption is 18 mW, and the chip size is 3. 5 mm 2. The second ASIC is a high voltage controller mainly consisting of 16 HV DACs and a simple digital con- troller. Each HV DAC consists of a Current Steering DAC and a high voltage Miller-compensated Amplifier. It is able to provide 16 individual voltages up to 120 V for different channels of antenna arrays in commu- nication systems. Because of the process and mismatch variations, each HV DAC on the same chip has different performance. Based on the experimental test, the worst INL and DNL of the DACs are 0. 98 LSB and 0. 52 LSB, respectively. The total power consumption is 120 mW, and the chip size is 10. 88 mm 2.

40|$|Abstract The thesis {{describes}} electrically tunable microwave devices utilising low sintering temperature, screen printable Barium Strontium Titanate (BST) thick films. The {{work has}} been divided into two parts. In the first section, the fabrication and microwave characterisation of BST material based structures compatible with Low Temperature Cofired Ceramic technology (BST-LTCC) are presented. Three different fabrication techniques, namely: direct writing, screen printing and via filling techniques, {{were used for the}} realisation of the structures. A detailed description of these fabrication techniques is presented. The dielectric properties such as relative permittivity, static electric field dependent tunability and loss tangent of BST-LTCC structures at microwave frequencies were characterised using coplanar waveguide transmission line and capacitive element techniques. The measured dielectric properties of BST-LTCC structures realised with the different fabrication methods are presented, compared and discussed. The second section describes tunable microwave devices based on BST-LTCC structures. A frequency tunable folded slot antenna (FSA) with a screen printed, integrated BST varactor is presented. The resonant frequency of the FSA was tuned by 3. 2 % with the application of 200 V external <b>bias</b> <b>voltage.</b> The impact of the BST varactor on the total efficiency of the antenna was studied through comparison with a reference antenna not incorporating the BST varactor. A compact, frequency tunable ceramic planar inverted-F antenna (PIFA) utilising an integrated BST varactor for mobile terminal application is presented. The antenna's resonant frequency was tuned by 3 % with an application of 200 V <b>bias</b> <b>voltage.</b> Frequency tunable antennas with a completely integrated electrically tunable BST varactor with silver metallisation are introduced in this work for the first time. The integration techniques which are described in this thesis have not been previously reported in scientific literature. The last part of the thesis presents a microwave delay line phase shifter operating at 3 GHz based on BST-LTCC structures. The figure of merit (FOM) of the phase shifter was measured to be 14. 6 °/dB at 3 GHz and and the device employs a novel structure for its realisation that enabled <b>the</b> <b>required</b> <b>bias</b> <b>voltage</b> to be decreased, while still maintaining compliance with standard screen printing technology. The performance of the phase shifter is compared and discussed with other phase shifters realised with the BST thick film process.

The {{first part of}} the project is designed the low noise amplifier (LNA) with high associated gain. The basic point of the design is choice of the active device. In the present time are available the ultra low noise transistors based on the GaAs with high mobility electron. The two-stage LNA has been designed with Agilent ATF- 55143. It is pseudomorphic HEMTs,which work in an enhancement mode. These transistor do not <b>require</b> a negative <b>bias</b> <b>voltage</b> and have extremely good typical noise figure. The design includes an interdigital tuned band pass filter between stages. The second part of the project is search another way design circuit. There are designed two LNA with paralel coupled line filter. The first has been applied on a PTFE substrate Duroid 5880 with relative permitivity 2, 2 and tg d = 0, 009.

40|$|The reverse <b>bias</b> <b>voltage</b> {{across the}} PIN {{photodiode}} {{is essential for}} the photodiode to operate in the photoconductive mode. This paper presents an input bias stage with differential photocurrent sensing for VLC front-ends. The <b>bias</b> <b>voltage</b> is provided from within the transimpedance amplifier’s (TIA) circuit eliminating the need of external <b>bias</b> <b>voltage.</b> The amount of <b>bias</b> <b>voltage</b> could be optimised according to <b>the</b> photodiode <b>required</b> sensitivity and capacitance. The differential configuration makes the TIA immune to any common mode noise. The proposed method is applied to a hypothetical TIA and results are compared with single ended structure. Simulation results showed that using this approach it is possible to achieve a transimpedance gain of 120 dBΩ over a maximum bandwidth of 14. 5 MHz with a common mode rejection ratio of 61 dB while the circuit provides a controlled <b>bias</b> <b>voltage</b> of up to 6 V across the PIN photodiode eliminating the need for external <b>bias</b> <b>voltage</b> source...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA {{low power}} and low cost WLAN/WiMAX RF front- end {{requires}} more advanced CMOS technologies whose transistor parameters degradation is becoming worse. Few published works has presented the reliability results for RF circuits. In order {{to fill this}} gap, we develop a new synthesis methodology for reliable RF front-end design using the design example of a reliable BLIXER. The first steps of our synthesis methodology is a transistor ageing simulation. Then, we calculate an estimation of the circuit performance and ageing using the circuit design equations and the total derivatives. Thus, we can find <b>the</b> <b>required</b> <b>bias</b> and sizing improving the circuit reliability. The simulation results of the typical circuit are coherent with the WLAN/WiMAX RF front-end specifications. Despite the integrated process variability and mismatch, we observe that 96. 4 % of the simulation runs have Gain >; 10. 0 dB, and 92. 1 % of the simulation runs have NFmax <; 5. 0 dB. Moreover, the BLIXER ageing degradation is negligible according to the fitted Poisson {{distribution of the power}} consumption for 99. 9 % of confidence. Going further, we can say that the synthesis methodology proposed and developed for a RF front-end design can be exploited in different AMS/RF circuits and also generalized for a single bottom- up reliable-system design approach...|$|R
40|$|An {{improved}} generic {{design has}} been devised for implementing signal chains involved in readout from complementary metal oxide/semiconductor (CMOS) image sensors {{and for other}} readout integrated circuits (ICs) that perform equivalent functions. The design applies to any such IC in which output signal charges from the pixels in a given row are transferred simultaneously into sampling capacitors at the bottoms of the columns, then voltages representing individual pixel charges are read out in sequence by sequentially turning on column-selecting field-effect transistors (FETs) in synchronism with source-follower- or operational-amplifier-based amplifier circuits. The improved design affords the best features of prior source-follower-and operational- amplifier-based designs while overcoming the major limitations of those designs. The limitations can be summarized as follows: a) For a source-follower-based signal chain, the ohmic voltage drop associated with DC bias current flowing through the column-selection FET causes unacceptable voltage offset, nonlinearity, and reduced small-signal gain. b) For an operational-amplifier-based signal chain, <b>the</b> <b>required</b> <b>bias</b> current and <b>the</b> output noise increase superlinearly with size of the pixel array because of a corresponding increase in the effective capacitance of the row bus used to couple the sampled column charges to the operational amplifier. The effect of the bus capacitance is to simultaneously slow down the readout circuit and increase noise through the Miller effect...|$|R
40|$|This is a {{theoretical}} {{study of the}} effects of two asgrown structural parameters on the modulation properties of Al xGa 1 -xAs-GaAs quantum wells (QW's), which are the Al concentration in barrier and the thickness of the well layer serving as initial conditions before interdiffusion. The results show that, with a larger Al concentration and a wider well width, the range of interdiffusion for an enhanced electroabsorption (EA) change increases with both of these parameters, while insertion loss increases with the former and decreases with the latter. However, the increase in loss is lower than that of the rectangular QW for the same magnitude of absorption change. The range of a tunable absorption-peak wavelength produced by interdiffussion increases with increasing Al concentration and decreases with increasing well width. Moreover, in a moderately interdiffused QW, <b>the</b> <b>required</b> <b>bias</b> reduces for <b>the</b> same level of EA modulation. For the best device operation, interdiffused QW's with the Al concentration between 0. 3 and 0. 4 and well width between 10 and 12 nm are must suitable for developing a general-purpose electroabsorptive modulator. When applied in high-speed modulators, the EA of a wide and shallow QW active-region structure can be further enhanced by the use of corresponding interdiffusion. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
