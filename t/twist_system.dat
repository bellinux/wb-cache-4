This study aimed to analyze a dataset of genetic and cytogenetic data in an Italian group of MDS and mothers of healthy children (control mothers) to assess the predictive capacity of artificial neural networks assembled in <b>TWIST</b> <b>system</b> in distinguish consistently these two different conditions and to identify the variables expressing the maximal amount of relevant information to the condition of being mother of a DS child. The dataset consisted of the following variables: the frequency of chromosome damage in peripheral lymphocytes (BNMN frequency) and the genotype for 7 common polymorphisms in folate metabolic genes (MTHFR 677 C>T and 1298 A>C, MTRR 66 A>G, MTR 2756 A>G, RFC 1 80 G>A and TYMS 28 bp repeats and 1494 6 bp deletion).

The semantic connectivity map provided important information on the complex biological connections between the studied variables and the two conditions (being MDS or control mother).

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSdA total of 175 eugonadal type 1 diabetic patients (age 32. 8 6 8. 4 years) and 151 age- and BMI-matched control subjects (age 32. 6 6 4. 5 years) were studied. In all subjects, BMI and BMD (as Z score) at the lumbar spine (LS-BMD) and femur (F-BMD) were measured. Daily insulin dose (DID), age at diagnosis, presence of complications, creatinine clearance (ClCr), and HbA 1 c were determined. RESULTSdLS- and F-BMD levels were lower in patients (20. 11 6 1. 2 and 20. 32 6 1. 4, respectively) than in control subjects (0. 59 6 1, P, 0. 0001, and 0. 63 6 1, P, 0. 0001, re-spectively). LS-BMD was independently associated with BMI and DID, whereas F-BMD was associated with BMI and ClCr. The cutoffs for predicting low BMD were as follows: BMI, 23. 5 kg/m 2, DID. 0. 67 units/kg, and ClCr, 88. 8 mL/min.

40|$|To {{prevent the}} {{singularity}} of serial robot’s {{due to the}} lost {{of one or more}} degree of twist freedom, it is necessary to determine the Jacobian matrix J associated to its instantaneous motion and analyze the vanishing condition of the determinant det (J). Usually, the large expression of det (J) does not facilitate an efficient geometric analysis. Since Grassmann-Cayley Algebra (GCA) has powerful tools for geometric interpretation of coordinate free representation and singularity analyzing in real time computing, this method is implemented in the present work. The goal of this research is to determine the singularity condition of wrist-partitioned 6 -R serial manipulator (SM) based on GCA. The symbolic approach of Plücker coordinate lines is used to formulate the <b>twist</b> <b>system</b> (TS) of SM. The <b>twist</b> <b>system</b> is similar to det (J) which rows are Plücker coordinate lines. The vanishing condition of det (J) based on the linearity condition of TS is determined without algebraic coordinate and provides a single singularity condition which contains all generals and particulars cases. The keys elements of transition between the rows of J and singularity condition of a twist-partitioned 6 -R SM are the introduction of the symbolic approach of Plücker coordinate lines and superbracket. The vanishing points of the superbracket are analyzed to describe the singularity condition. The result indicates that for a wrist-partitioned 6 -R SM a single singularity condition contains three generals cases such as the shoulder, elbow and wrist singularity.

As a practical type of RCM mechanisms, 2 R 1 T RCM mechanisms are synthesized in this paper using a modified screw theory method. Differing from the conventional screw theory method, the modified method brings forward the assessment of different wrench systems, and proposes several general subchains to satisfy each geometrical condition of the wrench system, which can ensure the motion continuity to a great degree. First, the motion pattern and the <b>twist</b> <b>system</b> of 2 R 1 T RCM mechanisms are presented.

To satisfy each condition of the sub-wrench-systems, several general subchains are proposed, and consequently some preferred general chains are constructed by the serial assembly of the corresponding subchains. These general chains are applied to the leg synthesis. Finally, practical examples of 2 R 1 T RCM mechanisms are constructed by assembling the legs...|$|E

QSPT was then applied to forty-six AD and forty-six DLB patients, using two phases statistical approach, standard and artificial neural network respectively. DLB patients had significant lower total score in the copy of pentagons and number of angles, distance/intersection, closure/opening, rotation compared to AD. However the logistic regression did not allow to establish any suitable modeling, whereas using Auto-Contractive Map (Auto-CM) the DLB was more strongly associated with low scores in some qualitative parameters of pentagon copying, i. e. number of angles and opening/closure and, for the remaining subitems of the MMSE, in naming, repetition and written comprehension, and for demographic variables of gender (male) and education (6 – 13 years). <b>Twist</b> <b>system</b> modeling showed that the QSPT had a good sensitivity (70. 29 %) and specificity (78. 67 %) (ROC-AUC 0. 74).

40|$|The {{kinetics}} of Bacillus subtilis macrofiber helix hand inversion was examined. Inversion was {{induced by}} transfer of structures produced in one medium to another medium. When cultured at 20 degrees C in either medium, the doubling time was approximately 100 min. To establish a baseline, the macrofiber twist state produced in one medium was measured {{over the same}} time course during which other macrofibers underwent inversion after transfer to a second medium. The baseline was used to identify the time of inversion initiation: {{the point at which}} curves representing changes of twist as a function of time after transfer to the new medium intersected the baseline. Right- and left-handed macrofibers of different twists were produced by growth in mixtures of TB and S 1 media. These were used to determine the influence of initial twist on the time course of inversion initiation. In the right to left inversion, a positive correlation was found between initial twist and the time of inversion initiation. The left to right inversion differed, however, in that a constant time was required for inversion initiation regardless of the starting left-handed twist. When a nutritional pulse was administered by transferring fibers from TB to S 1 to TB medium, the time to initiation of inversion was found to decrease with incubation of increasing duration in S 1 medium. A similar pulse protocol was used in conjunction with inhibitors to examine the protein and peptidoglycan synthesis requirements for the establishment of nutrition-induced memory that leads to initiation of inversion. Nutritionally induced right to left inversion but not left to right inversion required protein synthesis.

The nite dimensional reduction gives rise to a second order monotone recurrence relation. We study these recurrence relations to nd simple closed characteristics for the Lagrangian system. More complicated closed characteristics will be dealt with in future work. Furthermore, we give conditions on the Lagrangian that guarantee the Twist property...|$|R
40|$|Twisting is an {{important}} process to form a continuous yarn from short fibres and to determine the structure and properties of the resultant yarn. This paper proposes a new theoretical model of yarn dynamics in a generalized <b>twisting</b> <b>system,</b> which deals with two important phenomena simultaneously, that is, twist generation and twist propagation. Equations of yarn motion are established and the boundary value problems are numerically solved by Newton-Raphson method. The simulation results are validated by experiments and a good agreement has been demonstrated for the system with a moving rigid cylinder as the twisting element. For the first time, influences of several parameters on the twisting process have been revealed in terms of twist efficiency of the moving rigid cylinder, propagation coefficients of twist trapping and congestion. It {{was found that the}} wrap angle and yarn tension have large influence on the twisting process, and the yarn torsional rigidity varies with the twisting parameters.

40|$|This {{paper is}} an {{invitation}} to Fourier analysis {{in the context of}} reduced twisted C*-crossed products associated with discrete unital <b>twisted</b> C*-dynamical <b>systems.</b> We discuss norm-convergence of Fourier series, multipliers and summation processes. Our study relies in an essential way on the (covariant and equivariant) representation theory of C ∗ -dynamical systems on Hilbert C*-modules. It also yields some information on the ideal structure of reduced twisted C*-crossed products...|$|R
