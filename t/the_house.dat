Each year, and when required, the National Diet is convoked at <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Councillors, {{on the advice of}} the Cabinet, for an extra or an ordinary session, by the Emperor.

5|$|A new {{aristocracy}} {{known as}} the Kazoku was established. It merged the ancient court nobility of the Heian period, the Kuge, and the former Daimyo, feudal lords subordinate to the Shogun.

Members of <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Peers were {{made up of the}} Imperial Family, the Kazoku, and those nominated by the Emperor, while members of <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Representatives were elected by direct male suffrage. Despite clear distinctions between powers of the executive branch and the Emperor in the Meiji Constitution, ambiguity and contradictions in the Constitution eventually led to a political crisis.

5|$|After {{scouting}} Vancouver for a {{place to}} film scenes that involved the Swan house, {{the decision was made to}} recreate <b>the</b> <b>house</b> on an empty lot with a tree line and approaching road.

The second film also attempted to clarify the location of Bella's room, which, as seen in the first film, seemed to be located in the front of <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> when in reality it was on the right-hand side. Complications arose when the Portland house was repainted after Twilights release, which took away the aging <b>the</b> <b>house</b> had come to depict in the film.

5|$|After the Reform Bill was {{rejected}} in the Lords, <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Commons immediately passed a {{motion of confidence}} affirming their support for Lord Grey's administration. Because parliamentary rules prohibited {{the introduction of the}} same bill twice during the same session, the ministry advised the new king, William IV, to prorogue Parliament. As soon as the new session began in December 1831, the Third Reform Bill was brought forward. The bill was in a few respects different from its predecessors; it no longer proposed a reduction in the total membership of <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Commons, and it reflected data collected during the census that had just been completed. The new version passed in <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Commons by even larger majorities in March 1832; it was once again sent up to <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Lords.|$|E
