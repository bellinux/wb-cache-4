40|$|In {{the present}} work, {{design of a}} first {{approach}} of a test bench prototype for measuring friction in a piston-cylinder system is presented. The bench consists of a motor, belt and pulley <b>transmission,</b> <b>crank</b> mechanism, a piston, a cylinder and a lubrication system. Friction {{will be determined by}} means of strain gages placed on the connecting rod of the mechanism. The bench also includes a phonic wheel for acquiring angular speed and angular position signals of the crank. In future research, friction will be studied for different surface finishes obtained by means of honing and plateau honing. Honing processes provide a crosshatch pattern that holds oil and helps lubrication of piston and rings. Honing conditions will be selected with the goal of minimizing friction. Friction is directly related to energy consumption of an engine and, thus, to its environmental impact. Keywords: test bench, friction, piston-cylinder system, honing, roughness.

50|$|The {{locomotive}} {{was designed}} in Fablok in Chrzanów, sharing some features and components {{with a normal}} gauge locomotive SM03 (Ls150). It was powered by 150 hp diesel engine, driving three axles by mechanical <b>transmission,</b> <b>cranks,</b> connecting rods and coupling rods. A prototype was constructed in 1960, and subsequently tested on a railway of a Polish military weapons' research institute in Zielonka, where it served until 1992. From 1962, the locomotive entered series production, with a factory designation WLs150 (WLs stood for Wąskotorowa - narrow-gauge, lokomotywa - locomotive, spalinowa - internal combustion engine, practically diesel engine). Until 1968, 144 were built by Fablok (64 for 750 mm gauge, 71 for 785 mm gauge, and 10 for 900 mm gauge, designated WLs150-2). Four 785 mm gauge locomotives were later converted to 750 mm.|$|R

The parametric model of mechanism is established based on ADAMS software, then, with the minimum transmission angle to take the maximum as the optimization goal, lists the objective function and constraint equations of I and II type crank rocker mechanism.

50|$|L&MR No.32 Experiment {{was built}} in 1833 with {{vertical}} cylinders mounted just behind the chimney, driving the wheels via a bell crank. The locomotive also had piston valves. These valves were probably {{the reason that the}} design was not a success, rather than the bell <b>crank</b> <b>transmission,</b> which was used successfully in other locomotives. Another reason that the locomotive was not successful was steam leakage from the cylinders. Experiment was withdrawn after a few months.|$|R
40|$|This is a {{remarkable}} discovery. A century has passed since {{the invention of the}} first mechanical inversor, and we are now aware of the two historical inversive mechanisms: The Peaucel-lier cell and contraparallelogram of the Hart cell are cognates of each other. As a consequence of this, a new class of straight-line mechanisms is being introduced. Aside from theoretical interest, cognates provide alternative linkages with different link sizes and configurations, force <b>transmission</b> characteristics, <b>crank</b> rotations, and fixed pivot locations to provide a variety of design choices.

40|$|AbstractVertical {{crankshaft}} forging presses {{are designed for}} precision die forging and calibrating large series, large dimensions and power demanding forgings. Forming is carried out in several die cavities with increasing complexity, for example, intended for the aerospace and automotive industries. Transfer of vertical forging press workforce is realized between crankshaft and ram through the inserted connecting rod and coupling or sliding joint. The accuracy of these presses {{is directly related to}} their stiffness. Designers are therefore looking for ways to increase the stiffness. One of the possibilities is to increase the rigidity of the transmission of power from the crankshaft to the forging. The subject of this paper is comparing the conventional press with power <b>transmission</b> using the <b>crank</b> mechanism and the press with yoke mechanism...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the option to}} convert the diesel engine to LPG retaining the diesel-like behaviour. LPG is an alternative fuel with a better carbon to hydrogen ratio permitting reduced carbon dioxide emissions. It flashes immediately to gaseous form even if injected in liquid state for a much cleaner combustion almost cancelling some of the emissions of the diesel. Within Australia, LPG permits a much better energy security and the refueling network is widespread. In this paper, a latest heavy duty truck diesel engine with a novel power turbine connected through a continuously variable <b>transmission</b> to the <b>crank</b> shaft and fitted with a by-pass is modified to accommodate a second direct injector for the LPG fuel and operate full load with 5 % diesel and 95 % LPG. Results of engine performance simulations with diesel and diesel-LPG are presented. The engine retains the diesel performances while permitting the advantages of LPG in terms of particulate, carbon dioxide emissions and diversification of fuel supplies and energy security...|$|R
40|$|Crank case as the {{foundation}} for almost all engine parts are mounted her machine. Such as <b>transmission</b> gear shaft, <b>crank</b> shaft, shaft coupling, bushing and various other components. All of components are related to each other, if components are not installed with precision, the machine rejected. Manufacturing of the crank case begins with the die casting process, face milling, drilling, boring, reaming, spot facing and tapping. The most important process is the face milling. Face milling is done {{on both sides of the}} crank case R & L, which will both be united. Therefore, it takes surface roughness 12. 5 μm, flat and level, because if there are scratches on the crank case surface after combined oil seepage will occur. It is already a reject. It required an analysis of the failure of face milling process by considering several things, namely machining parameters are used, the condition of the cutting tool,the installation of the crank case on the jig and the coolant used. Analyzing the four factors above, it is hoped will be able to optimize the face milling process as well as reduced product reject. ...|$|R

With increased penetration of renewables and upgrade of network complexity in modern grid environment, a resilient and efficient restoration strategy is increasingly desired to enhance system reliability. As {{one of the}} most important tasks for power system planning and operation, power system restoration is regarded as a multi-objective and multi-stage nonlinear constrained optimization problem involving a great number of generation, transmission, distribution and load constraints. For simplifying problem formulation, the process is usually divided into three stages: preparation, system restoration and load restoration, with emphasis on different restoration objective for each stage. A restoration strategy is attained for dispatchers to start blackstart units, establish <b>transmission</b> path to <b>crank</b> non-blackstart units and pick up necessary loads. In existing methodologies, a strategy usually provides optimal starting timetable for all blackstart and non-blackstart units based on fixed time interval timeline in a way that the overall system generation capability is maximized. The insufficiency of this strategy is the inflexibility of the resultant restoration plan due to the assumption that the operation time for each transmission line and the whole restoration time horizon are preassigned fixed values. In modern power system environment, resilience and efficiency are critical and desirable features for electric power system recovery. Consequently, another variable factor of flexible transmission line operation time is taken into consideration while ensuring grid security at the same time, and a novel methodology named optimal efficiency oriented power system restoration has been developed. The proposed efficiency oriented model consists of transmission path search module, operation time calculation module, startup constraints checking module and load pickup module. Particularly, the operation time calculation module is designed to generate a random time matrix T for modeling variable transmission line operation time which complies with beta distribution. Based on this time matrix, power system restoration is formulated as a permutation-based optimization problem. Different from traditional objective of maximizing available generation capability, the proposed novel optimization objective is to maximize available generation capability per unit time named as restoration efficiency for adapting flexible restoration period. Moreover, the optimization solution in terms of non-blackstart units startup permutation is solved through one optimization process for generator startup permutation and transmission restoration path. For practical application, a flexible restoration schedule is generated according to the optimal solution, and provides information of non-blackstart generator startup timing, charging path and corresponding available generation at each restoration stage. Another contribution is development of a tailored algorithm referred as advanced quantum-inspired differential evolutionary algorithm (AQDE) to solve the proposed permutation-based restoration model. It features with better population diversity and quicker convergence speed. The superior performance of AQDE has been benchmarked through comparison experiments with two other well established meta-heuristic techniques including QDE and GA. Consequently, the proposed AQDE method is successfully applied to solve the system restoration of IEEE 39 and 118 bus systems respectively. The optimal efficiency oriented power system restoration methodology is also applied on load restoration stage after its validation on the aforementioned system restoration stage. Traditionally at load restoration stage, maximization of restored load becomes primary objective. When applying the proposed novel methodology, however, maximization of restored load per unit time is designed as the optimization objective. In order to reduce the impacts of service disruption on load loss, load prioritization should be taken into consideration in load pickup process. In general, electrical loads can be divided into three levels based on reliability requirements by customers. Load importance degree is defined according to properly ranking the prioritization of loads with reference to pre-signed contracts with customers, where the expected service quality has been specified. Based on the undirected power system topology model, a novel index Ps combining load prioritization and capacitance is proposed for searching optimal path. Finally, a flexible restoration schedule is obtained to provide information for generator startup and load pickup considering load prioritization. The proposed restoration methodology is applied on IEEE 39 and 57 bus systems respectively. The second part of my research work is load modeling. It is an important issue due to the fact that load model significantly affects power system dynamic simulations. In modern power system, there is increasingly desire of delicate load model with respect to accuracy and computational efficiency. A delicate load model is called for to capture specific load characteristics of various load components. To catch these characteristics, a complete load model at distribution grid level consisting of equivalent capacitor, large motor and small motor is proposed. Furthermore, the other two models, namely the composite load model and dynamic load model at distribution grid level, are applied to assess the accuracy of the developed complete load model. The comparisons of simulation on case studies have demonstrated that the complete load model has superior performance in transient simulations at distribution grid level and capable to capture more accurate load characteristics than the other two models.
