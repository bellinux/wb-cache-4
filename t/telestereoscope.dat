50|$|In 1963, Wallach, Moore and Davidson artificially {{increased}} disparity {{by having}} subjects look through a <b>telestereoscope,</b> a device {{which uses a}} mirror arrangement to simulate an increased distance between the eyes. When they viewed a wireform cube through the <b>telestereoscope,</b> subjects reported that the cube’s depth appeared greater than its width and height, {{a result of the}} greater disparity generated by the <b>telestereoscope.</b> After this, the cube was made to rotate slowly while the subjects watched. This created a conflict between two depth cues: while the artificially-increased disparity was indicating that the cube’s depth was greater than its other two dimensions, the kinetic depth effect (which is not affected by disparity) was presenting cues consistent with a normal rotating cube, of equal size on all sides.|$|E
50|$|After {{watching}} the rotating cube in this cue-conflict situation for a 10-minute adaptation period, subjects were again showed the stationary cube (still through the <b>telestereoscope)</b> {{and asked to}} indicate its depth. They reported less apparent depth than before the adaptation period, indicating that conflict from the competing KDE cue had modified the way the visual system interpreted the stereoscopic depth cues. The altered perception of depth was temporary: it could easily be unlearned (by {{watching the}} cube rotate without the <b>telestereoscope),</b> and the effect dissipated spontaneously after a few minutes, even with if the subjects simply sat with eyes closed during that time.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the role of {{binocular}} and monocular information sources in specifying time-to-contact. More specifically, it was investigated whether the timing of the one-handed catch is consistent with a binocular tau-function strategy. Subjects (n= 8) were required to time their grasp to catch a ball approaching with a constant spatial trajectory. The ball approached at three different constant velocities (1. 5, 2. 0 and 2. 5 m/s). Vergence and disparity were manipulated through subjects wearing a <b>telestereoscope</b> to increase the effective interocular separation, under both binocular and monocular viewing. Subjects performed 24 trials in each of the four conditions. Subjects' started the opening of the hand earlier in the binocular <b>telestereoscope</b> condition when a ball approached with velocity of 1. 5 m/s. They then closed the hand earlier in the binocular <b>telestereoscope</b> condition at all ball approach velocities. There were no effects of <b>telestereoscope</b> on the timing of hand opening and closing under monocular viewing. This finding suggests the use of the binocular information in timing the grasp. However, there were effects of approach velocity under all conditions of monocular and binocular viewing. Subjects' closed the hand earlier as a function of increasing approach velocity. Together, the effects of the <b>telestereoscope</b> and approach velocity indicate that timing of the one-handed catch is not consistent with the use of a binocular "tau-function" variable. Rather, it is concluded that multiple sources of monocular and binocular information contribute to the regulation of timing...|$|E
40|$|Previous work using prediction-motion tasks has {{indicated}} that time-to-contact estimates are based exclusively on binocular information when the approaching object is small. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the influence of object size on the use of binocular information sources in specifying time-to-contact in one-handed catching. Subjects (n= 10) were required to time their grasp to catch different-sized balls (60, 80, and 100 mm in diameter) approaching with a constant spatial trajectory and constant velocity of 2. 0 m/s. Binocular information was manipulated with a <b>telestereoscope</b> that increased the individuals' effective interocular separation. Subjects performed six trials with each of the different-sized balls in normal and telestereoscopic viewing conditions. It was found that subjects closed the hand earlier when catching the small and medium balls under telestereoscopic viewing compared with normal viewing; furthermore, that subjects closed their hand earlier for the small and medium balls compared with the large ball under telestereoscopic viewing. With regard to hand aperture, there was an effect of ball size, with the hand being opened to a wider aperture for each increase in ball size. Subjects also opened the hand to a wider aperture when catching the small and medium balls under telestereoscopic viewing. These findings are consistent with the notion of an increased reliance on the use of binocular information when the approaching object is small. Furthermore, they indicate that binocular and monocular sources of information are not used in isolation, but rather in combination to support the timing of one-handed catching...|$|E
40|$|A pre-exposure, exposure, {{post-exposure}} {{design was}} used to assess the adaptation of the timing of a one-handed catch during telestereoscopic viewing. More specifically, it was examined whether the adaptation involved: (1) ignoring binocular sources of information and selecting other information, or (2) a recalibration of the coupling between the effected binocular information and the catching movement, and (3), if it is recalibration, whether it is restricted to the manipulated binocular information. To test these hypotheses, subjects (n= 16) were assigned to one of two groups, each group performing three blocks of 15 trials in the dark with only the ball visible. In the exposure condition, both groups were required to catch balls under binocular telestereoscopic viewing. In the pre-exposure and post-exposure conditions, subjects performed under binocular and monocular viewing, respectively. Kinematics of the grasping movement were recorded. It was predicted that, {{in the case of a}} selection process, no afterfeffects would occur in the post-exposure condition, whereas, in the case of recalibration, aftereffects would occur. Moreover, if the recalibration is restricted to the manipulated information, only the group that was provided with binocular vision during the pre- exposure and post-exposure conditions would show aftereffects. Significant condition (pre-exposure, exposure, post-exposure) by block (first three trials, last three trials) effects were found for the moments of grasp onset, peak opening velocity and hand closure, indicating that the hand was opened and closed earlier in the first three trials of telestereoscopic viewing. This coincided with an increase in catching failures. In addition, for the moments of hand closure and peak closing velocity, negative aftereffects were found in the post-exposure condition. The hand was closed later in the first three trials after removal of <b>telestereoscope.</b> With respect to the presence of the aftereffects, no differences were found between the groups. It was concluded that adaptation to telestereoscopic viewing in the timing of a one-handed catch is due to the recalibration of the coupling between information and movement, rather than a selection of another source of information. Moreover, it is likely that the recalibration was not restricted to the single, manipulated information. Rather, the recalibration involves multiple binocular and monocular optical and oculomotor sources of information...|$|E
