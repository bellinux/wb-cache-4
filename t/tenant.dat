5|$|After {{talks of}} closure for years, Wayzata Bay Center closed its doors on August 15, 2011. Demolition began shortly after in April 2012, when all {{stores in the}} mall had either {{relocated}} or closed. The Original Pancake House, a restaurant, was the final <b>tenant</b> to close in the mall. The restaurant, a <b>tenant</b> of the center since 1994, relocated to neighboring Plymouth, while Adele's Frozen Custard, a <b>tenant</b> in the mall since 2009, closed their Wayzata location entirely. Among the mall's other final tenants were a True Value hardware store, a jewelry store, a health food store, and a furniture store.|$|E
5|$|In the 1850s, some <b>tenant</b> farmers formed {{associations}} {{to demand}} the three Fs: fair rent, fixity of tenure, and free sale. In the 1870s, the Fenians tried to organise the <b>tenant</b> farmers in County Mayo to resist eviction. They mounted a demonstration against a local landlord in Irishtown and succeeded in getting him to lower his rents.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{the passage}} of the Occupiers' Liability Act 1957, the general {{principle}} was that landlords were not liable for injuries suffered by third parties on their property. The 1957 Act qualified this, providing in Section 4 (repealed by the Defective Premises Act) that where a landlord was obligated by his <b>tenant</b> to repair property and he breached this obligation, third parties injured {{as a result of the}} breach would be able to claim providing that the <b>tenant</b> could. This provision was limited; it provided no remedy to the <b>tenant</b> himself, and only applied to lawful visitors, not trespassers. In addition, it only came into effect if the landlord was obliged to repair the property; if he simply had the option to do so, there was no remedy for an injured third party. Similarly, if a <b>tenant</b> failed to inform the landlord of something needing repair, any resulting injury could not be sued upon.|$|E

5|$|Historians {{are divided}} on Hugh Bardulf's ancestry. Katharine Keats-Rohan {{says that he}} was the son of Hamelin Bardulf, a <b>tenant</b> of Hugh Bigod, who held land in Suffolk. Ralph V. Turner, {{revising}} John Horace Round's entry in the Dictionary of National Biography for the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography says that Hugh was the son of a Hugh Bardulf that died around 1176. According to Turner and Round, the younger Hugh's mother was Isabel, who may have been a member of the Twist family from Lincolnshire. The younger Hugh acquired land at Waddington, Lincolnshire as a <b>tenant</b> of Ranulf de Gernon, 4th Earl of Chester, sometime in the middle 1140s.|$|E
5|$|In 1851, the Liberals gained {{office on}} Prince Edward Island. They {{immediately}} went about putting in place measures to gradually dismantle the proprietor/tenant system, although their efforts generally had limited effect largely because Samuel Cunard, who owned one-sixth of the Island, refused to sell {{any of his}} land. In 1864, the tenants organised into the <b>Tenant</b> League, and vowed to resist the collection of rent by their proprietors. Efforts by law enforcement to quell this rebellion had little effect, so {{the government of the}} island requested the assistance of British troops to enforce the collection of rent. In 1865, British troops arrived in the colony and successfully enforced the collection of the unpaid rent, and the <b>Tenant</b> League crumbled. It appeared that the operation of the <b>Tenant</b> League was a matter of principle rather than practical necessity; the rent paid by tenants to the proprietors was to the amount of one shilling per acre, and the proprietors allowed rent to go unpaid for years at a time.|$|E

5|$|In the Greco-Roman {{world of}} Classical antiquity, Roman {{agriculture}} {{was built on}} techniques originally pioneered by the Sumerians, transmitted to them by subsequent cultures, with a specific emphasis on the cultivation of crops for trade and export. The Romans {{laid the groundwork for}} the manorial economic system, involving serfdom, which flourished in the Middle Ages. The farm sizes in Rome can be divided into three categories. Small farms were from 18-88 iugera (one iugerum is equal to about 0.65 acre). Medium-sized farms were from 80-500 iugera (singular iugerum). Large estates (called latifundia) were over 500 iugera. The Romans had four systems of farm management: direct work by owner and his family; slaves doing work under supervision of slave managers; <b>tenant</b> farming or sharecropping in which the owner and a <b>tenant</b> divide up a farm’s produce; and situations in which a farm was leased to a <b>tenant.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Non-payment of rent- [...] " [...] A <b>tenant's</b> {{failure to}} pay rent must be habitual." [...] This will stop landlords from evicting <b>tenants</b> for just one late payment. It also gives <b>tenants</b> more time to make up some payments.|$|R
50|$|In practice, lettings {{agencies}} will usually obtain credit references on prospective <b>tenants</b> and, once the <b>tenants</b> have moved in, they are ambivalent {{as to whether}} <b>tenants</b> claim housing benefit or not, {{as long as the}} rent is paid on time.|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} {{evidence on}} whether the aim of moving people who are dependent on benefits into work has been achieved, and considers three important questions: Are welfare reforms encouraging <b>tenants</b> into work or to work more? What are the main barriers to work for out of work <b>tenants</b> or <b>tenants</b> {{who want to work}} more? Why are many social housing <b>tenants</b> not working...|$|R
5|$|Landlords {{generally}} divided their estates {{into smaller}} farms that they rented to <b>tenant</b> farmers. <b>Tenant</b> farmers were generally on one-year leases, {{and could be}} evicted even if they paid their rents. Some of the tenants were large farmers who farmed over , but the majority were much smaller—on average between 15 and 50 acres (0.06–0.20km2). Many small farmers worked as labourers on the larger farms. The poorest agricultural workers were the landless labourers, {{who worked on the}} land of other farmers. Farmers were an important group politically, having more votes than any other sector of society.|$|E
5|$|Over time, {{numerous}} structural modifications {{were made}} to suit the needs of tenants in the Twin Towers. Modifications were made {{in accordance with the}} Port Authority's <b>Tenant</b> Alteration Review Manual and were reviewed by the Port Authority to ensure the changes did not compromise structural integrity of the buildings. In many instances, openings were cut in the floors to accommodate new stairways to connect <b>tenant</b> floors. Some steel beams in the core were reinforced and strengthened to accommodate heavy live loads, such as large amounts of heavy files that tenants had on their floors.|$|E

50|$|The NIB {{provided}} the <b>tenants</b> with housing, transport, food, tools and a subsistence advance of Kshs 300 {{per month for}} incoming <b>tenants</b> until the first cash crop was harvested.

When the <b>tenants</b> arrived, often the farm land was not ready and this resulted in late planting, low cotton yields and thus low incomes.|$|R

5000|$|This {{management}} system could work if a viable cropping pattern would be available, {{but this was}} and is lacking at Bura. <b>Tenants</b> planted cotton in 2010 and 2011. In 2010 most <b>tenants</b> made a small profit, {{but in the next}} year the crop failed, leaving the <b>tenants</b> without income and with debts with Equity Bank. Since then no cotton has been cultivated as it is considered non-profitable. For food the <b>tenants</b> grew maize, but this crop was commercially not viable and although it has provided the <b>tenants</b> with the necessary subsistence food, it also resulted in more arrears. Moreover, when the <b>tenants</b> wanted to market their surplus maize, there was no market available. Alternative crops (chillies) have also not been successful and left <b>tenants</b> with debts as well. The only crop which has been grown with success is seed maize. Unfortunately, due {{to the quality of the}} soils, the margins for this crop are low at Bura and do not make it possible for the <b>tenants</b> to repay already existing debts or to pay for the cost of their food maize.|$|R
