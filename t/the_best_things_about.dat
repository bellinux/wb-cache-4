He relies on a network of scouts and personal contacts to find and attract talented footballers to play under him.

A photo gallery was also included as well as backstage footage showing Gaga meeting with actress Liza Minnelli. According to Jeffrey Kauffman of Blu-ray.com, the audio tracks were commendable for their crisp sound. He stated that [...] "One of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> this concert is despite its artifice, even its artificiality, there's absolutely no question that Lady Gaga is actually singing.

Instrumentation includes guitar strings, piano lines and vocals. The song utilises an acoustic guitar riff and a rotation of lead vocals. The song's lyrics revolve around the insistence that flaws are what make a person unique.

[...] Busis praised the final fairytale scenes as [...] "intense, effective..... awesome." [...] IGN writer Amy Ratcliffe rated the episode 7/10, giving praise to Robert Carlyle and guest actor Brad Dourif, but criticizing Lana Parrilla's constant [...] "dagger stares and pursed lips" [...] to Emma. Ratcliffe did however believe Ginnifer Goodwin and Joshua Dallas had [...] "electric chemistry," [...] and wished viewers could see more scenes between the two. Like Ratcliffe, Digital Spy columnist Catriona Wightman lauded Parrilla and Carlyle's performances, believing the latter [...] "continues {{to be one of}} <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> Once Upon A Time - this completely new version of Rumpelstiltskin we saw was illuminating.

500|$|Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, {{in their}} book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three-a-half stars out of five, and wrote that, while the episode [...] "stumbles around a lot", it gives the viewer [...] "the {{impression}} there's nothing else on TV quite like it". The two felt that the idea that Mulder and Scully were friends throughout their various lives was [...] "one of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> the story". They also wrote {{that the fact that}} Melissa and Mulder were somehow soul mates also prevented the story from being [...] "obvious and pat". However, Shearman and Pearson felt that Morgan and Wong added [...] "a few too many ingredients" [...] which yielded an uneven episode. Entertainment Weekly, on the other hand, was negative, giving the episode an [...] "F" [...] and describing it as [...] "stultifyingly awful".|$|E

[...] Benioff continued, [...] "Every kid that grows up in Westeros, they all hear about this legendary sword fight that took place twenty years ago, and as far as Bran knew, it was just his father beat this legendary guy." [...] Weiss also stated [...] "Honor was so important to Ned Stark that it was worth losing his own life for, but he was completely ready to let go of that honor and excellence to do something that he really felt was more important. It could make a very, very strong defense for Ned doing what he did, and it certainly does puncture the mythology of Ned Stark that's running through this world, especially after his death." ...|$|E

Praveen of The Hindu gave a {{positive}} review: [...] "Syam Pushkaran, {{in writing the}} revenge story, takes away the usual ingredients of hate and anger, and replaces it with lots of humour, arriving as a torrent in one-liners, in situations {{and even in the}} minute gestures of the characters ... Maheshinte Prathikaram provides clean entertainment, treading new paths in that endeavour. If revenge comes like this, let's have more of it". He praised Pothan's direction and Faasil's performance. Sify also had {{a positive}} review: [...] "It's not often that you come across such an intelligent comedy that is extremely funny, thoroughly gripping and brilliantly packaged". The reviewer praised the performances: [...] "One of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> this one is the performance of every artiste, both in main roles and also those who are there even in a scene or so". Also praising the screenplay, cinematography, and music, the review concluded: [...] "Maheshinte Prathikaram is one of the finest comedies to have happened in Malayalam during recent years".|$|E

500|$|At Metacritic, which assigns a {{normalised}} rating out of 100 to {{reviews from}} mainstream critics, the album has received an average score of 82, indicating universal acclaim, based on 14 reviews. Pitchfork stated that [...] "One of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> Glass Swords is that, {{for all of}} its pop-goes-clubbing bluster, it's also as psychedelic, where the devil's in the zillion little details zigzagging across the tracks" [...] and that [...] "there's not a lot here that will redefine your ideas of what dubstep or electronic music in general can do. For all of Rustie's skill as a sculptor of very 21st-century beats, Glass Swords can feel just as much like a [...] "greatest bits" [...] collage." [...] Fact gave the album a five out of five rating, stating that [...] "you get the impression that it's the point Rustie has been building up to for the last five years; an album made in relative isolation, with zero self-consciousness, shame or thought for trend behind it." [...] Drowned in Sound gave the album an eight out of ten rating, finding that the album is [...] "equally impressive is the fact that this formula (or lack thereof) never grows tired. Thirteen tracks of excess could easily have been a recipe for sighs, but instead it is consistently addictive and grin-inducing." ...|$|E
500|$|Drew McWeeny {{praised the}} film's {{complexity}} as giving it repeat-viewing value, and its conclusion as [...] "perhaps the most canny move it makes." [...] Todd Gilchrist found the story too {{similar to other}} cinematic trilogies such as Star Wars, but praised the production values. Brian Lowry felt that [...] "unlike last year's bloated sequel, it at least possesses some semblance of a destination, making it slightly more coherent - if no less numbing during the protracted finale." [...] Total Film praised the performances but complained that the twists and exposition {{made it hard to}} care for the characters. Edward Douglas liked the film but had issues with its pacing, while Blake Wright criticized the Davy Jones's Locker and Calypso segments. James Berardinelli found it the weakest of the trilogy as [...] "the last hour offers adventure as rousing as anything provided in either of the previous installments... which doesn't account for the other 108 minutes of this gorged, self-indulgent, and uneven production." [...] Peter Travers praised Richards and Rush but felt [...] "there can indeed be {{too much of a good}} thing," [...] regarding Depp's character. Travers later declared the movie to be one of the worst films of the year. Colm Andrew of the Manx Independent said the film was overall a disappointment and that [...] "the final showdown ... is a non-event and the repetitive swordplay and inane plot contrivances simply become boring by the end". Richard Roeper gave a positive review, saying [...] "Gore Verbinski and the stunt and special effects crews have created one of the most impressive blends of live-action work and CGI wizardry ever put on film," [...] and believing it [...] "rarely drags and is almost always entertaining." [...] He praised the performances of the actors as one of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> the film.|$|E
500|$|Lesley Goldberg of The Hollywood Reporter {{said that}} the scene where Santana comes out to her {{grandmother}} only to be rejected was a [...] "powerful moment and Rivera delivered in a way equal to Chris Colfer and Mike O'Malley's scenes during Kurt's coming out". Bell also complimented the sequence, though she criticized the next scene for showing [...] "a happy, smiling Santana" [...] with no further explanation, and Canning and Kubicek were also unhappy with her abrupt change in mood, {{as if nothing had}} happened. VanDerWerff, though he called the coming-out scene [...] "a moment that's played with a sort of bracing honesty and moving empathy" [...] for what Santana was going through, stated that the [...] "Santana storyline has been one of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> the back half of season two and this front half of season three, and the scenes that should be its emotional crux are occurring in our imaginations", such as when she comes out to her parents. Goldberg called the fact that Finn suffered no consequences for his outing of Santana [...] "a missed opportunity". Bell, however, thought that his telling Santana that [...] "he cares about her and doesn't want her to hold her feelings for women in anymore" [...] was [...] "one of the most touching scenes of the series", though Kubicek characterized Finn's statement that he cared for her because Santana [...] "was his first" [...] as creepy. MTV's Kevin P. Sullivan derided the choice to perform [...] "I Kissed a Girl" [...] as [...] "poor comprehension of song lyrics", since Santana [...] "is a lesbian and not just [...] drunk girl who kissed another girl after drinking". VanDerWerff wondered why Santana was so happy during the song, since she had just experienced [...] "the sort of outrageous bigotry she'll {{have to put up with}} for the rest of her life".|$|E
5000|$|Time Out more {{recently}} stated, [...] "Tourneur's second film in Hollywood, it's briskly and competently done, but <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> it is Donald Meek's performance as Bartholomew the Bee Man, a mousy little apiculturist who fancies {{himself as a}} private eye." ...|$|R

500|$|Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad {{said that}} he was not certain if [...] "this was a great 30 Rock episode" [...] but that it [...] "had all of the {{elements}} that make the good ones: funny one-liners and Liz and Jack both looking for something better in their lives." [...] He was complimentary towards Matt Damon's appearance, writing that he [...] "was one of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> this season finale episode", but admitted he could not see Damon [...] "being Liz's boyfriend or husband next season." [...] The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin wrote that he enjoyed Kenneth's rant against his former co-workers, and said that this episode [...] "was a terrific end to a season that wobbled for a while but ended strongly." [...] Sean Gandert of Paste magazine said that Kenneth's story was [...] "an enjoyable diversion". In regard to the finale, itself, Gandert noted that it was [...] "pretty good, but not outstanding, which is a fitting way to conclude a season that never quite hit its stride but was still consistently entertaining." [...] Entertainment Weekly contributor Emily Exton noted that Damon's character was a [...] "perfect match" [...] for Liz. Meredith Blake, writing for the Los Angeles Times, wrote that Damon was [...] "perfectly Damon-esque". Blake reported that she had been rooting for the Avery character since first appearing in the series, but acknowledged [...] "that there's something undeniably sweet about Jack and Nancy." [...] IGN contributor Robert Canning complimented Julianne Moore's performance, writing that she was [...] "engaging". Canning said that Kenneth and Jenna's plots [...] "added more hilarity to the episode" [...] and that on their own [...] "these storylines [...] very entertaining. But combine them into one fantastic, fast and funny half hour and you're left with near perfection." [...] Alexandra Martell of New York magazine said that Avery's pregnancy was [...] "going to drive much of next season, but if that means more Elizabeth Banks, we're cool." [...] Martell wrote that Kenneth getting fired was a [...] "nice twist", but that [...] "the highlight" [...] of [...] "I Do Do" [...] was Jenna discovering Paul dressing up as Cher.

2500|$|Chicago Sun-Times film critic, Roger Ebert, was {{especially}} complimentary {{of the film}} and of actor Joe Pesci, and wrote, [...] "One of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> the movie {{is the way it}} shows us how seriously Bernzy takes his work. He doesn't talk about it. He does it, with that cigar stuck in his mug, leading the way with the big, ungainly Speed Graphic with the glass flashbulbs. In the movie's big scene of a mob assassination, he stares death in the face to get a great picture." [...] Ebert said the film made him [...] "think" [...] a little bit of Casablanca (1942).|$|E

[...] Conversely, Mark Wright from The Stage said that the decision to bring these much-loved character back [...] "is very welcome". Ruth Deller of entertainment website Lowculture praised Bianca stating: [...] "Bianca and Ricky’s return has been one of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> [...] in the past year [...] and even when Bianca and co don't have storylines as big as the Whitney/Tony one, they still give good telly." ...|$|E
