5|$|As {{a result}} of these problems, in 1954 serious {{consideration}} was given to scrapping <b>the</b> <b>class</b> <b>and</b> replacing them with Britannia class locomotives. However, the locomotives had excellent boilers and several other good features and so the decision was taken to rebuild them, removing several of Bulleid's less successful ideas.|$|E
5|$|Maunsell {{was aware}} of the {{reputation}} for poor steaming enjoyed by <b>the</b> <b>class</b> <b>and</b> attempted to address it by the fitting of twin Kylchap blastpipes to No. 860 in 1934. However, the problem was ultimately solved by Oliver Bulleid, Maunsell's replacement as Chief Mechanical Engineer of the Southern in 1938. He fitted larger diameter chimneys and Lemaître multiple jet blastpipes, which effectively transformed their performance. Thereafter the class was highly respected.|$|E

The 219th Engineers moved to Camp Dodge, Iowa in November 1918. Casey returned to the Engineer School at Camp Humphreys as a student in September 1919.|$|E

Since the students were seated alphabetically, he sat next to the officer who topped the class, Major Dwight D. Eisenhower. Other students in the class included Joseph Stilwell, Leonard Gerow and Joseph T. McNarney. Eichelberger graduated as a Distinguished Graduate, one of the top quarter of <b>the</b> <b>class,</b> <b>and</b> stayed on at the Command and General Staff College as its Adjutant General.

5|$|He pursued his {{literary}} goals by submitting {{poetry and prose}} to various newspapers and magazines, partly due to encouragement from Professor Thomas Cogswell Upham. He published nearly 40 minor poems between January 1824 and his graduation in 1825. About 24 of them {{were published in the}} short-lived Boston periodical The United States Literary Gazette.

5|$|The Nclass {{was also}} {{successful}} on the Central section, where they worked alongside L. B. Billinton's LB K class 2-6-0s. However the large cylinder and cab sizes of the Nclass prevented {{use of the}} type on the Eastern section's TonbridgeHastings line. The route's narrow bridges and tunnels were unable to accommodate <b>the</b> <b>class,</b> <b>and</b> provided justification for using the narrower 3-cylinder N1 class 2-6-0 on the route. Despite these restrictions, the class was capable of hauling heavy loads at moderate speeds, a useful attribute that was exploited throughout the Second World War.

5|$|In February 1931, de Hauteclocque {{went back}} to Saint-Cyr as an instructor, but wanted to return to active service. During the summer break in 1933, he flew south to Africa, where he {{reported}} to Général de brigade Henri Giraud on 11 July. Giraud sent him into the field as a liaison officer with a goum. He was awarded the croix de guerre des théâtres d'opérations extérieures for leading goumiers in an attack on caves and ravines on Bou Amdoun on 11 August. The Commander in Chief in Morocco, Général de division Antoine Huré, felt that de Hauteclocque {{should not have been}} there, and held the award up for three years. Others felt differently, and de Hauteclocque was given early admission to the course for promotion to capitaine. He placed fourth in <b>the</b> <b>class,</b> <b>and</b> was promoted on 25 December 1934. Promotion was slow in the inter-war French Army, especially in the cavalry, and he was only the second in his Saint-Cyr class to reach that rank. Most had to wait until 1936. He was also made a Chevalier de la Légion d'Honneur.|$|E
