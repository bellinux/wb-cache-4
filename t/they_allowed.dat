5|$|Alerted by a witness, MalcolmX and a {{small group}} of Muslims went to the police station and demanded to see Johnson. Police {{initially}} denied that any Muslims were being held, but when the crowd grew to about five hundred, <b>they</b> <b>allowed</b> MalcolmX to speak with Johnson. Afterward, MalcolmX insisted on arranging for an ambulance to take Johnson to Harlem Hospital.|$|E
5|$|An {{additional}} {{cause of}} delay, according to Professor Williams, was the long pause after the debacle of the Battle of Curupayty when the Allies overestimated the strength {{both of the}} opposing army and of Humaitá: <b>they</b> <b>allowed</b> López almost a year to rebuild his forces, devastated at the Battle of Tuyutí.|$|E
5|$|At Frankfurt Airport, Nebiu Demeke took {{advantage}} of the airport security by stuffing a pistol deep into his hat and then placing his hat on a table adjacent to the scanner. The security guards were not as strict as now since the incident took place before 9/11 and <b>they</b> <b>allowed</b> Demeke to pass.|$|E

5|$|Conversely, UConn boasted one of {{the better}} {{defenses}} in the country. The Huskies allowed the 10th-fewest yards per game in the nation with 281yards allowed. Connecticut was especially good against the pass; <b>they</b> <b>allowed</b> an average of only 165yards per game, seventh-best in the country. No UConn opponent passed for more than 259yards during the regular season.|$|E
5|$|Granderson was {{recruited}} {{by a number}} of college baseball programs, and he chose the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), in part because <b>they</b> <b>allowed</b> him to play basketball in addition to baseball.

5|$|The Yankees would however receive {{one notable}} moment of glory against the Red Sox during this era. On April 24, 1917 Yankee pitcher George Mogridge threw a no-hitter at Fenway Park, {{the first in}} the ball park's history and first in Yankee history. It would also {{turn out to be the}} Yankees' only no-hitter where <b>they</b> <b>allowed</b> a run as they would win the game, 2–1.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} week, Maryland beat 20th-ranked Baylor, 20–6, with Tamburello {{passing for}} two touchdowns. Maryland then defeated Wake Forest, 28–7, {{and held them}} to nine rushing yards. Against , <b>they</b> <b>allowed</b> 18 yards on the ground. Vereb scored three touchdowns and made an interception, but the Tar Heels scored under unusual circumstances when center Jim Jones stripped Tamburello and returned it 35 yards. The final result was 25–7.|$|E
5|$|By 7June 1823, Etty {{felt that}} he had reached the limits of what he could {{accomplish}} in Venice, and was considering returning home. Soon afterwards he left Venice for Florence, with the intention of creating a full-size replica of Titian's Venus of Urbino, considered one of the finest works of the Venetian school of painting. Although the Uffizi management were hostile to this proposal, after 10 days of negotiations <b>they</b> <b>allowed</b> Etty to create his copy. His contemporaries considered it among the finest copies ever made of a painting generally considered to be impossible to copy. In late July Etty began the journey home, pausing for a further two months in Venice. On 8October 1823 Etty finally left Venice, travelling via Mantua and Geneva to Paris.|$|E

5|$|He {{acted as}} an {{official}} representative for the English Royal Family in the Perfeddwlad territories. Tudur used the English property laws, which he found more advantageous in his position than those used by the Welsh, as <b>they</b> <b>allowed</b> for inheritance of lands by a single party. He continued to hold the lands in North Wales and Cardiganshire which he had inherited. Upon his death in 1311, his holdings passed to his son Goronwy ap Tudur Hen. He had two further sons, Madog and Hywel. Tudur Hen was interned in Bangor Priory on 11 October 1311; his son, Goronwy, was also placed there on 11 December 1331 following his death.|$|E
5|$|In 1848, Wisconsin {{achieved}} statehood; Indian {{nations were}} under increased pressure for removal and marginalization. Corrupt US Indian agents controlled annuity payments, sometimes underpaying tribes, and took authority not granted {{them by the}} bands. <b>They</b> <b>allowed</b> white settlers to move onto Ojibwa lands and refused the Ojibwe the rights reserved by treaties. The Ojibwa complained to the President about the mistreatment and broken promises, but politicians were more apt to listen to western land speculators, who saw possibilities for profit in removing the Ojibwa to Minnesota.|$|E
5|$|In the 1860s, {{the income}} from the {{navigation}} had dropped, {{as a result of}} attempts to compete against the railways, but economies were made, and capital works continued. The lock at Lea Bridge was removed, and replaced by Old Ford Lock further to the south, which was built to take 100-ton barges, rather than the 40-ton barges specified by an Act of 1805. Although the original Lee trustees, and after 1868 the Conservators of the River Lee, were officially responsible for the Bow Back Rivers, there was little incentive to maintain them, since they did not generate any revenue. Nor could they be closed, since <b>they</b> <b>allowed</b> surplus water from the upper river to reach the Thames, without causing flooding.|$|E

5|$|Philip had no {{intention}} of handing over Amphipolis to the Athenians, but acted as if he was just delaying the transfer of the city. He seems to have gone straight on to besiege Pydna after capturing Amphipolis. The Athenians, perhaps still hoping to receive Amphipolis if <b>they</b> <b>allowed</b> Philip to take Pydna, do not seem to have tried to intervene (and may not have been able to). Pydna seems to have fallen to Philip by treachery, in either 357 or 356 BC.|$|E
5|$|Smetona and Voldemaras, both {{representing}} the Lithuanian National Union, invited the Christian Democrats {{to join them}} in forming a new government that would restore some degree of constitutional legitimacy. The party agreed reluctantly; {{they were worried about}} their prestige. Looking toward the near future, the Christian Democrats reasoned that they could easily win any upcoming Seimas elections, regaining power by constitutional means and avoiding direct association with the coup. In keeping with this strategy, <b>they</b> <b>allowed</b> members of the Lithuanian National Union to take over the most prominent posts.|$|E
5|$|The French {{responded by}} attacking and {{capturing}} Washington at Fort Necessity in July 1754. <b>They</b> <b>allowed</b> {{him to return}} with his troops to Virginia. Historian Joseph Ellis concludes that the episode demonstrated Washington's bravery, initiative, inexperience, and impetuosity. Upon his return to Virginia, Washington refused to accept a demotion {{to the rank of}} captain, and resigned his commission. Washington's expedition into the Ohio Country had international consequences; the French accused Washington of assassinating Jumonville, who they claimed was on a diplomatic mission. Both France and Great Britain were ready to fight for control of the region and both sent troops to North America in 1755; war was formally declared in 1756.|$|E

5|$|The King County Superior Court {{ruled in}} April that the {{university}} was exempt from the city's landmarks-preservation ordinance and could go ahead with demolition of the More Hall Annex. While the city and preservationists appealed the decision, <b>they</b> <b>allowed</b> the demolition of the More Hall Annex to proceed by not seeking a stay that would leave them responsible for damages compensation. The decision was appealed to the Washington Supreme Court, who ruled in the city's favor, and rejected the university's claimed exemption from the city landmarks preservation ordinance.|$|E
5|$|The {{preceding}} pair of transits {{occurred in}} December 1874 and December 1882; the following pair {{will occur in}} December 2117 and December 2125. The oldest film known is the 1874 Passage de Venus, showing the 1874 Venus transit of the sun. Historically, transits of Venus were important, because <b>they</b> <b>allowed</b> astronomers to determine {{the size of the}} astronomical unit, and hence the size of the Solar System as shown by Horrocks in 1639. Captain Cook's exploration of the east coast of Australia came after he had sailed to Tahiti in 1768 to observe a transit of Venus.|$|E
5|$|The {{reductions}} were self-sufficient {{indigenous communities}} of 2,000–4,000 inhabitants, usually headed by two Jesuit priests and the cabildo (town council and cacique (tribal leader), who retained their functions {{and played the}} role of intermediaries between the native peoples and the Jesuits. However, {{the degree to which the}} Jesuits controlled the indigenous population for which they had responsibility and the degree to which <b>they</b> <b>allowed</b> indigenous culture to function is a matter of debate, and the social organization of the reductions have been variously described as jungle utopias on the one hand, to theocratic regimes of terror, the former description being much closer to the mark.|$|E
