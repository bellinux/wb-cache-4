5|$|Sow stalls {{were again}} criticised by celebrity chef Jamie Oliver in 2009 and <b>the</b> <b>response</b> <b>from</b> the Danish Bacon {{industry}} {{makes it clear}} that they are still in use on some farms, but they confirm that they will all be phased out by the EU deadline of 2013.|$|E
5|$|By 1972, the Portuguese {{military}} had changed its strategy, adapting the British/American search and destroy operations utilising small shock troop sweeps. They also initiated a {{hearts and minds}} campaign, named the Aldeamentos Programme, which was a forced relocation program. But on November 9, 1972, FRELIMO – not numbering more than 8,000 fighters – launched a large offensive in Tete Province. <b>The</b> <b>response</b> <b>from</b> the Portuguese military was fierce, leading to reprisal attacks {{in an attempt to}} unbalance the local population's continuing faith in FRELIMO.|$|E
5|$|In Nikki Stafford's analysis, the {{reactions}} of Buffy, Dawn, Xander, Willow, Anya, and Tara represent stages of Elisabeth Kübler-Ross' five stages of grief in different parts. Joss Whedon stated on the DVD commentary how surprised he was at <b>the</b> <b>response</b> <b>from</b> viewers who wrote {{to say that the}} episode allowed them to accept the death of a close family member, even if they had not acknowledged it for months or years. Joyce's death was the first by natural causes in the series.|$|E

5|$|The {{episode was}} {{intended}} to be commentary on Apartheid in South Africa, using gender role reversal. However, there were problems between the cast and director during filming, and Patrick Stewart sought to have the sexist nature of the episode changed. The resulting episode was not well liked by members of the production team, and <b>the</b> <b>response</b> <b>from</b> reviewers was negative.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>response</b> <b>from</b> {{non-governmental}} organizations {{has been more}} favorable. The Mekong Wetlands Biodiversity Programme (MWBP), an international alliance managed by the United Nations Development Programme and World Conservation Union, has published {{a study on the}} methodology of Thai Baan research and coordinated their own study in Sri Songkham district in 2004, concluding that it was more useful than top-down styles of village research. The study overseen by the MWBP was cited in an academic journal and submitted to an international conference. Living River Siam's spokesperson Pianporn Deetes was invited to a United Nations Environment Programme conference on dams.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>response</b> <b>from</b> the team's {{management}} was to suspend four players. The team travelled to Toowoomba, where they defeated the locals 19–0.

The team then travelled back to New Zealand, and arrived in Invercargill on 5 August.|$|E

5|$|In 1919, {{the year}} after the war ended, around 60,000 British {{tourists}} and mourners made pilgrimages to the Western Front. The transatlantic voyage was longer and more expensive from Canada; many attempts to organize large pilgrimages failed, and journeys overseas were largely made individually or in small, unofficial groups. The delegates of the 1928 national convention of the Canadian Legion passed a unanimous resolution asking that a pilgrimage be organized to the Western Front battlefields. A plan began to take form wherein the Legion aimed to coordinate the pilgrimage with the unveiling of the Vimy memorial, which at the time was expected to be completed in 1931 or 1932. Due to construction delays with the memorial, it was not until July 1934 that the Canadian Legion announced a pilgrimage to former battlefield sites in conjunction with the unveiling of the memorial. Although the exact date of the memorial unveiling was still not set, the Legion invited former service members to make tentative reservations with their headquarters in Ottawa. <b>The</b> <b>response</b> <b>from</b> veterans and their families was enthusiastic—1,200 inquiries by November 1934. The Legion presumptuously announced that the memorial would be unveiled on Dominion Day, 1 July 1936, even though the government still did not know when it would be completed.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>response</b> <b>from</b> the {{community}} was overwhelming. More than 75,000 people asked that Stiltsville be spared, and the park service reversed their decision. In August, 2000, the Park Service announced the approval of a Stiltsville amendment to the 1983 General Management Plan for the Biscayne National Park.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>response</b> <b>from</b> law {{enforcement}} has been mixed.

The Ottawa Police, the first Ontario police force to adopt the Taser, held a Taser demonstration for reporters to illustrate their safety. Both the Toronto Police and the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary, meanwhile, have put large orders of Tasers for their front-line officers on hold.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>response</b> <b>from</b> the Italian troops was {{in favour}} of the third option by a large {{majority}} {{but there is no}} available information as to the exact size of the majority, and therefore on 14 September Gandin reneged on the agreement, refusing to surrender anything but the division's heavy artillery and telling the Germans to leave the island, demanding a reply by 9:00 the next day.|$|E
25|$|While {{awaiting}} a response, MacArthur informed General Ridgway {{of the new}} development on March 22. Although MacArthur expected that <b>the</b> <b>response</b> <b>from</b> Washington would be a new directive for ground operations, possibly one forbidding an entry into North Korea in strength, he intended in the meantime to allow the Eighth Army to advance north of the parallel as far as logistics could support major operations. Ridgway otherwise was to be restricted only by having to obtain MacArthur's specific authorization before moving above the parallel in force.|$|E
50|$|A motion {{detector}} needs to satisfy three general requirements: pair-inputs, asymmetry and nonlinearity.

25|$|Nevertheless, <b>the</b> <b>response</b> <b>from</b> {{the public}} and critics alike were lukewarm at best. Faye herself {{admitted}} {{that she was not}} totally satisfied with some tracks, namely those produced by Taiwan 'father of rock' Wu Bai, which had an industrial electronica flavour reminiscent of Karen Mok's 'Golden Flower' album. She cited the two folk-style songs written by Singaporean singer-songwriter Tanya Chua as her favourite picks on her album. The song that generated most noise from the press turned out to be Vertigo (迷魂記), a ballad penned by former love Nicholas Tse. Faye Wong (王菲) reached number 14 on the Japan Oricon charts.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, a 1999 {{survey by}} the United Kingdom Consumers' Association ranked Proton as among the most {{reliable}} and recommended in Britain. <b>The</b> <b>response</b> <b>from</b> 27,000 members of the association revealed that Proton was third ranked third in terms of fewer breakdowns, faults and other mechanical problems, placing Proton behind Honda and Mazda, and ahead of Toyota and Ford. Furthermore, 80% of the surveyed Consumers' Association members said they would recommend Proton cars to friends and family, compared to 90% for Subaru, 79% for Toyota, 78% for Honda and Mitsubishi, 63% for Hyundai and 47% for Rover respectively. The 1999 award is Proton's second consecutive, having received similar appraisal in 1998.|$|E
