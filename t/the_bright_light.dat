5|$|In the 1990s the Elephant 6 collective, {{including}} {{acts like}} The Apples in Stereo, The Olivia Tremor Control, Neutral Milk Hotel, Elf Power and of Montreal, produced eclectic psychedelic rock and folk. Other alternative acts to pursue psychedelia from the 1990s included The Brian Jonestown Massacre, The Dandy Warhols, Kula Shaker and Super Furry Animals. Stoner rock also emerged, combining elements of psychedelic rock, blues-rock and doom metal. Typically using a slow-to-mid tempo and featuring low-tuned guitars in a bass-heavy sound, with melodic vocals, and 'retro' production, it was pioneered by the Californian bands Kyuss and Sleep. In the UK the Madchester scene influenced the early sound of 1990s Britpop bands like Blur. The Verve mixed on 1960s psychedelia with the shoegazing aesthetic. Oasis also drew on 1960s psychedelic pop and rock. In the immediate post-Britpop era Kula Shaker incorporated swirling, guitar-heavy sounds of late-'60s psychedelia with Indian mysticism and spirituality. In {{the new millennium}} neo-psychedelia was continued by bands directly emulating {{the sounds of the}} 60s such as The Black Angels, Tame Impala, Pond, King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard, Unknown Mortal Orchestra and The Essex Green, while bands like Animal Collective and <b>The</b> <b>Bright</b> <b>Light</b> Social Hour applied an experimental approach that combined genres from the 1960s and the present.M.

25|$|After {{examining}} the case 48 {{years after the}} event, Joe Nickell of the paranormal investigation group Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI), then known as CSICOP, concluded in 2000 that <b>the</b> <b>bright</b> <b>light</b> in the sky reported by the witnesses on September12 was most likely a meteor, that the pulsating red light was likely an aircraft navigation/hazard beacon, and that the creature described by witnesses closely resembled an owl. Nickell claimed that the latter two of which were distorted by the heightened state of anxiety felt by the witnesses after having observed the former. Nickell's conclusions are shared {{by a number of}} other investigators, including those of the Air Force. Skeptics have also proposed misidentified owl sightings as explanations for the Mothman and the Kelly-Hopkinsville encounter.|$|E
500|$|Frank McNamara (62), an apiarist, and Geoff Inkpen (25), a young farmer, {{heard the}} sound of a big {{aircraft}} in serious trouble, flying low nearby. McNamara described the noise from the engines as [...] "terrifying". They investigated and saw <b>the</b> <b>bright</b> <b>light</b> of a flash fire. McNamara sent his two teenage sons in his utility truck to York to alert the police. McNamara and Inkpen then set out on foot {{in the direction of the}} fire. As there was bright moonlight, they were able to hurry through the bush. After about half an hour, they came upon a scene of devastation. They were astonished to find an elderly man in a dazed state wandering around the burning wreckage. He gave his name and explained that he had been a passenger on a large aircraft. He had survived the crash despite being badly burned. No one else was found alive.|$|E

500|$|Ponzi {{described}} the machine as [...] "light-hearted [...] [...] [...] active, distinctive—and fun". O'Donnell, who inspired the sculpture, {{called it a}} [...] "gentle spectacle" [...] and {{described the}} work as [...] "a cartoon contraption, an odd little thingamajig. It has bells and whistles and other mechanized wonders that confirm rain sometime after the downpour and proudly announce sunshine in <b>the</b> <b>bright</b> <b>light</b> of day." [...] In 1994, The Oregonian reported that O'Donnell regarded Weather Machine with a [...] "mixture of wonder and embarrassment" [...] and stated that he [...] " [...] think it's all that attractive". The publication's Vivian McInerny said of O'Donnell and the machine: [...] "Practical people may wonder why the square needs such a silly weather machine when a glance out the window works as well[...] [...] And these practical people may be the very ones who make the world go 'round. But it is the less practical people, the dreamers like O'Donnell, who make it worth going 'round." ...|$|E
500|$|Welders wear {{protective}} clothing, including {{light and}} thin leather gloves and protective long sleeve shirts with high collars, to avoid exposure to strong ultraviolet light. [...] Due {{to the absence}} of smoke in GTAW, the electric arc light is not covered by fumes and particulate matter as in stick welding or shielded metal arc welding, and thus is a great deal brighter, subjecting operators to strong ultraviolet light. The welding arc has a different range and strength of UV light wavelengths from sunlight, but the welder is very close to the source and the light intensity is very strong. Potential arc light damage includes accidental flashes to the eye or arc eye and skin damage similar to strong sunburn. [...] Operators wear opaque helmets with dark eye lenses and full head and neck coverage to prevent this exposure to UV light. Modern helmets often feature a liquid crystal-type face plate that self-darkens upon exposure to <b>the</b> <b>bright</b> <b>light</b> of the struck arc. Transparent welding curtains, made of a polyvinyl chloride plastic film, are often used to shield nearby workers and bystanders from exposure to the UV light from the electric arc.|$|E
500|$|One {{interpretation}} of the perspective of Rix {{is that she was}} an orientalist, in the sense used by academic Edward Said. However, Hoorn argues that she and her sister were to a significant extent counter-orientalist: they focussed on the common nature of human experience rather than cultural expressions of difference and they sought to portray everyday life in Tangier as they found it, rather than presenting generalised views of the orient. Her works also reflected the modernist interest in the empirical: in using <b>the</b> <b>bright</b> <b>light</b> of north Africa to help bring out the structures and shapes that made up visual impressions. Stylistically, Rix's Moroccan paintings have been characterised as the [...] "most abstract, flat and post-impressionistic of her career". Whether this reflected the influence of Matisse is not known – despite the coincidences of their Tangier visits, it is not certain that they actually met. Rix {{was one of the first}} Australians to paint post-impressionist landscapes, represented by works such as Men in the Market Place, Tangier (1914) and View of Tangier (1914), produced at the time of a second visit to the city. Such works demonstrated the development of Rix's style at the time: loose brush strokes, a palette confined to a few low-keyed colours, and an emphasis on shadow and light, affecting both the overall impression made by the picture and the treatment of individual figures.|$|E

500|$|The miners are teleported away safely {{before the}} rain starts after helping Madge locate her missing children. Madge, using the limited flying skills taught {{to her by}} Reg, directs the walker to the {{lighthouse}} and safely reunites with her children as the acid rain starts. The wood creatures identify her as [...] "strong", and the Doctor realises they consider her the [...] "mothership", able to carry the life force safely. Donning the band, Madge absorbs the life force of the forest, allowing her to direct {{the top of the}} lighthouse as an escape pod away from the acid rain and into the time vortex. To get them home, the Doctor directs her to think of memories of home, allowing Madge to revisit her fond memories of Reg, shown on screens within the pod. The Doctor urges her to continue to show even Reg's death, revealing to Lily and Cyril what happened to their father. Soon, the escape pod safely leaves the time vortex, landing just outside the house in Dorset, and the life force of the forest have converted themselves to ethereal beings within the time vortex. The Doctor steps outside while Madge starts to explain Reg's death to Lily and Cyril, but he returns to interrupt her and to tell her to come outside. There stands Reg and his Lancaster; he had followed <b>the</b> <b>bright</b> <b>light</b> of the escape pod into the time vortex and came out safely along with the pod at Dorset. The family has a tearful reunion as the Doctor watches.|$|E

2500|$|One form of unspoken {{communication}} between drivers is to flash headlights {{on or off}} once or twice to indicate that a passing truck has cleared the passed vehicle and may safely change lanes {{in front of the}} signaling vehicle. [...] Flashing of the high beams is discouraged since the driver is looking in the mirror to see if it is clear to move over and <b>the</b> <b>bright</b> <b>light</b> of the high beams can temporarily blind the driver. [...] The passing driver may then flash the trailer or marker lights to indicate thanks. This signal is also sometimes used by other motorists to signal truck drivers.|$|E
2500|$|Jay Ellis elaborates on Chigurh's {{encounter}} with {{the man behind the}} counter at the gas station. [...] "Where McCarthy gives us Chigurh's question as, 'What's the most you ever saw lost on a coin toss?', he says, 'the film elides the word 'saw', but the Coens of course tend to the visual. Where the book describes the setting as 'almost dark', the film clearly depicts high noon: no shadows are notable in the establishing shot of the gas station, and the sunlight is bright even if behind cloud cover. The light through two windows and a door comes evenly through three walls in the interior shots. But this difference increases our sense of the man's desperation later, when he claims he needs to close and he closes at 'near dark'; it is darker, as it were, in the cave of this man's ignorance than it is outside in <b>the</b> <b>bright</b> <b>light</b> of truth." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Watch Tower Society {{has stated}} that its early leaders {{promoted}} [...] "incomplete, even inaccurate concepts". The Governing Body of Jehovah's Witnesses says that, unlike Old Testament prophets, its interpretations of the Bible are not inspired or infallible. Witness publications say that Bible prophecies can be fully understood only after their fulfillment, citing examples of biblical figures who {{did not understand the}} meaning of prophecies they received. Watch Tower publications often cite Proverbs 4:18, [...] "The path of the righteous ones is like <b>the</b> <b>bright</b> <b>light</b> that is getting lighter and lighter until the day is firmly established" [...] (NWT) to support their view that there would be an increase in knowledge during [...] "the time of the end", as mentioned in Daniel 12:4. Jehovah's Witnesses state that this increase in knowledge needs adjustments. Watch Tower publications also say that unfulfilled expectations are partly due to eagerness for God's Kingdom and that they do not call their core beliefs into question.|$|E
