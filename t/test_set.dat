5|$|Tham Chee Ho contends that, {{based on}} the {{objective}} <b>test</b> <b>set</b> out in Chng Suan Tze, the fear that the courts will take over responsibility for national security matters is misplaced. This is because the courts do not review the actions taken by the executive for national security purposes, but merely determine whether the situation in fact involves national security issues. The Court of Appeal in Chng Suan Tze reflected this by holding that what was required to preserve national security was a matter solely for executive judgment.|$|E
5|$|The First <b>Test</b> <b>set</b> {{the tone}} for the series, and ahead of the next Test, Hassett top scored with 127 and took five catches in an innings win over Northamptonshire. Hassett scored 47 and a duck in the Second Test at Lord's, having been dropped three times in the first innings as Australia went on to a 409-run win. Hassett then struck 139 against Surrey, his second century against the county in as many matches. Hassett and Australia were in {{difficulty}} in the Third Test at Old Trafford. Hassett made 38 as Australia scored 221 in reply to 363. In England's second innings, Hassett twice dropped Cyril Washbrook in the same position from the same shot. After the third day's play, Washbrook shouted Hassett a drink; England were in a strong position, 316 runs ahead with seven wickets in hand. Luckily for Australia and Hassett, the pair of missed chances from the England opener late in the day cost little. Washbrook remained unbeaten on 85 as England declared without further addition after the entire fourth day and the final morning had been lost to rain. Hassett was not required as Australia batted for 61 overs to ensure a draw.|$|E

5|$|The First <b>Test</b> <b>set</b> {{the trend}} {{for the series}} as England's batsmen {{struggled}} against the Australian pace attack and, despite attempting to stifle the Australian scoring with leg theory, fell to an eventual defeat. Failure to contain the Australian batsmen, particularly Bradman himself, plagued the English bowlers, while their batsmen were prone to struggling and collapsing on key occasions, with rain petering the Third Test into a draw. The series saw a number of notable cricketing feats, including a 301-run partnership between Bradman and Arthur Morris, aided by many dropped catches and missed stumpings, during the Fourth Test, and Australia's heaviest win of the series in the Fifth Test, where England were bowled out for 52 in half a day. Australia then made 389, with Bradman making a famous duck in his final innings. England were then bowled out for 188 to lose by an innings and 149 runs {{in less than three}} days' playing time.|$|E

JJ Jones, James Cook and Freddie McClair are best friends to begin with; twins Katie and Emily Fitch know Naomi Campbell from school but are distant with her because Katie is homophobic and suspects her of being a lesbian. The gang meet Effy, and sidekick Pandora; Katie wants to become Effy's best friend, and both Cook and Freddie are instantly smitten. Cook passes the <b>test</b> <b>set</b> by Effy and begins a casual sexual relationship with her. Episode two focuses on Cook who invites the whole group over, but their friendships are not very strong yet; chaos ensues, and Cook angers local gangster Johnny White (Mackenzie Crook). Thomas Tomone is only introduced in the third episode. He is an immigrant from the Congo, and develops a crush on Pandora. He endears himself to the group when {{he is able to}} get Johnny White off their backs by besting him in a pepper-eating competition. However, despairing at his decadent life in Bristol, Mrs. Tomone brings Thomas back to the Congo. In 'Pandora', Pandora's innocent slumber party becomes an MDMA-fuelled rave after Katie spikes the brownies. Emily and Naomi kiss; Naomi denies being gay, but urges Emily to admit that she is, who also denies it. Pandora allows Cook to take her virginity, but regrets it when later Thomas returns from the Congo.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [39]- 41) This {{investigation was}} designed to evaluate the fundamental gross motor skill patterns of seventy-two preschool-age children at risk for developmental delay(s) in two test settings (traditional and natural). The traditional <b>test</b> <b>setting</b> is defined as {{an environment that is}} teacher directed. The natural <b>test</b> <b>setting</b> was a child?s scheduled physical education time. Performance criteria from the Test of Gross Motor Development (TGMD) were used to observe and score the performances of two locomotor skills (horizontal jump, gallop) and two object control skills (overhand throw, bounce) of the children in both test settings. This investigation sought to identify differences in the observed motor skill patterns between two observations within a traditional <b>test</b> <b>setting</b> and between two observations in a natural <b>test</b> <b>setting.</b> The results indicate that {{there were no significant differences}} between two observations within the traditional <b>test</b> <b>setting</b> (p=. 43). The mean scores in the traditional <b>test</b> <b>setting</b> were M= 3. 35 (SD= 2. 81) for day one and M= 3. 76 (SD= 2. 84) for day two, and the results indicate that there were no significant differences in two observations within the natural <b>test</b> <b>setting</b> (p=. 85). The mean scores in the natural <b>test</b> <b>setting</b> were M= 3. 29 (SD= 2. 42) for day one and M= 3. 37 (SD= 2. 46) for day two. This investigation also sought to identify differences between the observed motor skill patterns in two days within each testing environment (traditional and (natural). The results indicate that a statistically significant difference was found to favor the traditional <b>test</b> <b>setting</b> for the performances of horizontal jump (p<. 05) but not in the performances of gallop, overhand throw, or bounce. Although not statistically significant, the results indicate that object control performance scores were slightly higher in the natural <b>test</b> <b>setting</b> while locomotor performance scores were slightly higher or significantly higher (horizontal jump) in the traditional <b>test</b> <b>setting.</b> Teachers need to determine the purposes of assessment. The learning styles of children as well as the purpose of an assessment should drive the choice of test settings for evaluation purposes. Depending on this information, the teachers can then determine what environment would provide the most accurate information about a child?s ability level. M. S. Ed. (Master of Education...|$|R

500|$|The court first {{addressed}} the VSDA's {{argument that the}} entire Act should be invalidated based on the defendant's concession on appeal that the definition of [...] "violent video game" [...] in the Act is unconstitutionally broad.

The {{court held that the}} definition for [...] "violent video game" [...] is grammatically and functionally separable because, as an alternative definition of [...] "violent video game," [...] it can be removed from the Act without affecting the wording or function of the Act's other provisions. Further, the definitions are volitionally separable because those sections were not of critical importance to the passage of the Act and the legislative body would have adopted the Act had it foreseen the partial invalidation of the statute. These definition sections were only included to avoid the possibility that a court would rule the terms unconstitutionally vague; the court found that the legislature would still have enacted the statute without this definition section.|$|E
500|$|The first {{innings of}} the First <b>Test</b> <b>set</b> {{the pattern of}} the series as the England top-order {{struggled}} against Australia's pace attack. Only twenty minutes of play was possible before the lunch break on the first day due to inclement weather, but it was enough for Miller to bowl Hutton with a faster ball. During the interval, heavy rain fell, making the ball skid through upon resumption. Washbrook was out after the luncheon interval, caught on the run by Brown at fine leg after attempting to hook Lindwall. At 15/2, Compton came to the crease, and together with Edrich, they took the score to 46 before left arm paceman Johnston bowled the latter. Two balls later, Johnston removed Hardstaff without scoring, caught by Miller in slips, an effort described by Wisden as [...] "dazzling". Two runs later, Compton was bowled attempting a leg sweep from the bowling of Miller and half the English team were out with only 48 runs on the board. Lindwall was forced to leave the field mid-innings due to a groin injury and did not bowl again in the match. Johnston bowled Barnett for eight and when Evans and Yardley were both dismissed with the score on 74, England was facing the prospect of setting a new record for the lowest Test innings score at Trent Bridge, the current record being 112. Laker and Bedser, both from Surrey, scored more than half of England's total, adding 89 runs in only 73 minutes. Laker's innings was highlighted by hooking, while Bedser defended stoutly and drove in front of the wicket. Bedser was removed by Johnston and Miller had Laker caught behind two runs later, ending England's innings at 165. Laker top-scored with 63 in 101 minutes, with six boundaries. Johnston ended with 5/36, a display characterised with accuracy and variations in pace and swing. Miller took 3/38 and a catch.|$|E
2500|$|The {{final step}} of {{knowledge}} discovery from data is {{to verify that}} the patterns produced by the data mining algorithms occur in the wider data set. Not all patterns found by the data mining algorithms are necessarily valid. It is common for the data mining algorithms to find patterns in the training set which are not present in the general data set. This is called overfitting. To overcome this, the evaluation uses a <b>test</b> <b>set</b> of data on which the data mining algorithm was not trained. The learned patterns are applied to this <b>test</b> <b>set,</b> and the resulting output is compared to the desired output. For example, a data mining algorithm trying to distinguish [...] "spam" [...] from [...] "legitimate" [...] emails would be trained on a training set of sample e-mails.
