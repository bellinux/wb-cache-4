5|$|After {{the episode}} was submitted, several re-writes were requested. Originally, {{the story was}} {{supposed}} to take place in Oklahoma, noted for being the center of Tornado Alley. For budgetary reasons, the episode was relocated <b>to</b> <b>Mississippi.</b> Another scene, originally scripted to take place at a motel, featured Pinker taking a short cut through a wall. This scene was cut not only because of budgetary reasons, but also because the writers and producers wanted to shift the episode from a supernatural focus to an emotional one.|$|E

5|$|During the screenwriting process, Parker and Colesberry began {{scouting}} locations. They visited {{eight states}} based on suggestions {{made by the}} location department. The shooting script required that a total of 62 locations be used for filming. In December 1987, Parker and Colesberry traveled <b>to</b> <b>Mississippi</b> to visit the stretch of road where Goodman, Chaney and Schwerner were murdered. The filmmakers were initially reluctant about filming in Mississippi; they expressed interest in filming in Forsyth County, Georgia before being persuaded by John Horne, head of the Mississippi's film commission. Parker also met with Mississippi governor Ray Mabus, who voiced his support of the film's production.|$|E
5|$|His brother Joseph, who was 24 years older, {{acted as}} a {{surrogate}} father and encouraged Jefferson in his education. Two years later, Davis entered the Catholic school of Saint Thomas at St. Rose Priory, a school operated by the Dominican Order in Washington County, Kentucky. At the time, {{he was the only}} Protestant student at the school. In 1818 Davis returned <b>to</b> <b>Mississippi,</b> studying at Jefferson College at Washington. Three years later in 1821, he returned to Kentucky, where he studied at Transylvania University in Lexington. (At the time, these colleges were like academies, roughly equivalent to high schools.) His father Samuel died on July 4, 1824, when Jefferson was 16 years old.|$|E

5|$|In late 1835, Davis sailed from New Orleans to Havana, Cuba, to {{help restore}} his health. He was {{accompanied}} by James Pemberton, his only slave at that time. Davis observed the Spanish military and sketched fortifications. Although no evidence points to his having any motive beyond general interest, the authorities knew that Davis was a former army officer and warned him to stop his observations. Bored and feeling somewhat better, Davis booked passage on a ship to New York, then continued to Washington, D.C., where he visited his old schoolmate George Wallace Jones. He soon returned with Pemberton <b>to</b> <b>Mississippi.</b>|$|E
5|$|That {{victory was}} {{followed}} by consecutive losses, however, against UCLA and No. 1-ranked Florida. Tennessee ended its losing streak with a win against Ohio, then began alternating wins and losses. The victory against Ohio {{was followed by}} a loss to Auburn. A win against Georgia preceded a loss to No. 2 Alabama on a last-second blocked field goal and a win against No. 22 South Carolina. After South Carolina, Tennessee beat Memphis to create its first winning streak of the season. That streak abruptly ended the following week, when Tennessee lost <b>to</b> <b>Mississippi.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{football}} team at Georgetown was first formed on November 1, 1874, with the earliest recorded games dating to 1887.

As the college game became more expensive after World War II, however, Georgetown's program began to lose money rapidly. The Hoyas last successful season was 1949, when they lost in the Sun Bowl against Texas Western. However the program was losing too much money, and on March 22, 1951, the university's president canceled the football program.|$|E

5|$|Brown {{moved into}} an on-campus {{boarding}} house at 61 East Eleventh Avenue in the primarily black neighborhood of the University District in Columbus, and majored in architectural engineering. Brown attempted {{several times to}} apply to the school's aviation program, but was denied because of his race. Brown joined the track and field team as well as the wrestling team, but soon dropped both for financial reasons. He {{took a job as a}} janitor at a local Lazarus department store and then was hired by the Pennsylvania Railroad to load boxcars from 15:30 to midnight each day. In spite of this, he maintained top grades in his classes. Facing difficulties with his academics and the institutional segregation in the city, Brown nevertheless found most of his fellow students were friendly toward him. Brown rarely returned <b>to</b> <b>Mississippi</b> during the school year, but in the summers he worked at a dry cleaner in Hattiesburg to help pay for his classes.|$|E
5|$|Inacom, {{founded in}} Omaha in 1991, was a {{technology}} company that customized computer systems for large businesses, {{and was on}} the Fortune 500 list from 1997 until 2000, when it filed for bankruptcy. Northwestern Bell, the Bell System affiliate for Northwestern states, had its headquarters in Omaha from its founding in 1896 until it moved to Denver in 1991 as US West. Level 3 Communications, a large Tier 1 network provider, was founded in Omaha in 1985 as Kiewit Diversified Group, a division of Kiewit Corporation, a Fortune 500 construction and mining company still headquartered in Omaha; Level 3 moved to Denver in 1998. World Com was founded by a merger with Omaha's MFS Communications, started as Metropolitan Fiber Systems in 1993. MFS, backed by Kiewit Corporation CEO Walter Scott and Warren Buffett, purchased UUNET, one of the largest Internet backbones in the world, for $2 billion in 1996. The now-infamous Bernie Ebbers purchased the much larger MFS for $14.3 billion in 1997 under his World Com. He moved headquarters of the merged company from Omaha <b>to</b> <b>Mississippi.</b>|$|E
5|$|Major Francis L. Dade, {{military}} commandant at Key West, received {{intelligence that}} Cuba and Spain were arming the Indians; investigations did not confirm the rumor. Reports coming from Fort Brooke, near present-day Tampa, noted that Indians {{in the area}} were resisting orders {{from the federal government}} to emigrate <b>to</b> <b>Mississippi,</b> contradicting the assertions made by the federal authorities that the Indians had agreed to emigrate peacefully. Dade, two companies of soldiers, and all of the available arms were sent to Fort Brooke at Tampa Bay, the port designated for the commencement of the Indians' emigration. The Indians answered by concentrating all of their forces in the New River region. On December 28, 1835, Dade and 107soldiers were ambushed en route from Tampa Bay to Fort King, near present-day Ocala. Only three soldiers survived; the attackers lost only three men.|$|E

5|$|Mississippi based Grapico Bottling Company {{troubles}} did not {{end with}} its union problems. In September 1924, John Henry Ennis of Ellisville, Mississippi purchased a Grapico. On drinking it, Ennis discovered that the contents were filled with flies, some of which he swallowed and became sick. On filing a lawsuit against Grapico Bottling Company and its sole stockholder, Philip Carriere, Ennis learned that Grapico Bottling Company had filed for and successfully dissolved itself as a corporation between the time Ennis consumed the flies and filed suit against Grapico Bottling. On appeal, the Supreme Court of Mississippi issued an opinion that serve as precedent in Mississippi for the rule that a stockholder of a corporation is not liable for the debts, liabilities, and other acts of the corporation. After Grapico Bottling Company (Mississippi) dissolved in 1925, Rochell's Grapico Bottling Works became the sole supplier of Grapico <b>to</b> <b>Mississippi.</b>|$|E
5|$|Senator Joseph S. Clark's and Senator Robert F. Kennedy's {{tour of the}} Mississippi Delta {{occurred}} on April 10, 1967. At the behest of civil rights lawyer Marian Wright, Clark and Kennedy, together with two other Senators, traveled <b>to</b> <b>Mississippi</b> to investigate reports of extreme poverty and starvation. Following a field hearing, they drove from Greenville to Clarkesdale, stopping and touring impoverished communities as they went. Deeply disturbed by what they saw, the senators returned to Washington D.C. and began pushing {{for a series of}} reforms to alleviate the situation. Extensive media coverage of the event exposed the American public to real instances of malnutrition and starvation. The country was shocked and hunger became an important topic nationwide as people began looking for solutions. Efforts by the government and political action groups ultimately resulted in the problem being largely reduced by the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Gladys {{became a}} {{tropical}} storm, the NHC issued gale warnings for the Florida Keys {{and later a}} hurricane watch for the southwest Florida coast from the Florida Keys to Clearwater. After Gladys entered the Gulf of Mexico, the NHC issued hurricane warnings for the Florida Keys to Cedar Key, with a watch to St. Marks. Later, hurricane warnings were issued from Charleston, South Carolina to Hatteras, North Carolina. Before Gladys made landfall in Florida, all schools in Pinellas County were closed, and officials evacuated 60jet fighters from MacDill Air Force Base <b>to</b> <b>Mississippi.</b> The HMS Sirius, which was visiting St. Petersburg, rode out the storm in the open Gulf of Mexico. The American Red Cross opened shelters across western Florida for people to stay in during the storm, and about 40,000people evacuated their homes during the storm's passage. Then-governor Claude R. Kirk, Jr. ordered 100Florida guardsmen to assist with storm work. Shelters were set up in North Carolina, although few people evacuated.|$|E

5|$|Tennessee {{was ranked}} No. 13 in the Associated Press preseason poll {{at the start}} of the season, but won just one game in its first four of the season, causing the Volunteers to drop out of the top 25 for the first time since 1989, {{breaking}} a streak of 84 consecutive weeks in the poll. To make matters worse, Tennessee's two starting quarterbacks suffered season-ending injuries during that four-game span. In the Volunteers' season-opener against UCLA, Jerry Colquitt suffered a knee injury. Backup quarterback Todd Helton was hurt in the fourth game of the season, a loss <b>to</b> <b>Mississippi</b> State. In response to the poor start, Fulmer overhauled his defense and coped with the loss of his first- and second-string quarterbacks by bringing in acclaimed freshman Peyton Manning, son of National Football League star Archie Manning.|$|E
5|$|The {{novel is}} set in the American South in the 1930s, during the time of Prohibition and Jim Crow laws that legalized racial {{segregation}} in the South. It begins with the journey of Lena Grove, a young pregnant white woman from Doane's Mill, Alabama, who is trying to find Lucas Burch, the father of her unborn child. He has been fired from his job at Doane's Mill and moved <b>to</b> <b>Mississippi,</b> promising to send word to her when he has a new job. Not hearing from Burch and harassed by her older brother for her illegitimate pregnancy, Lena walks and hitchhikes to Jefferson, Mississippi, a town in Faulkner's fictional Yoknapatawpha County. There she expects to find Lucas working at another planing mill, ready to marry her. Those who help her along her four-week trek are skeptical that Lucas Burch will be found, or that he will keep his promise when she catches up with him. When she arrives in Jefferson, Lucas is there, but he has changed his name to Joe Brown. Looking for Lucas, sweet, trusting Lena meets shy, mild-mannered Byron Bunch, who falls in love with Lena but feels honor-bound to help her find Joe Brown. Thoughtful and quietly religious, Byron is superior to Brown in every way but his shyness prevents him from revealing his feelings to Lena.|$|E
