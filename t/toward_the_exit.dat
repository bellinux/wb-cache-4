50|$|Nepal often {{experiences}} significant hailstorms {{during early}} spring, but the stadium {{only had one}} covered grandstand. Spectators panicked {{in their efforts to}} escape the pelting hail, and rushed to the sheltered west stand. When police pushed them back, they turned <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>exits.</b> All but one of <b>the</b> stadium's eight <b>exits</b> were locked, and witnesses reported that most of the deaths occurred there as fans found the other gates closed.|$|R
60|$|They walked {{together}} <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> main <b>exit.</b> <b>The</b> young man's {{face had}} {{lost some of}} its grimness. Once more his features wore that look of pleasant and genial good-fellowship which seems characteristic of his race after business hours.|$|R
60|$|He {{wished that}} he might be granted the brief respite of {{unconsciousness}} before the final plunge of the keen blade--and then there was a frightful roar that sounded almost in his ears. The High Priestess lowered her dagger. Her eyes went wide in horror. The priestesses, her votaresses, screamed and fled madly <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>exits.</b> <b>The</b> priests roared out their rage and terror according to the temper of their courage. Werper strained his neck about to catch a sight of the cause of their panic, and when, at last he saw it, he too went cold in dread, for what his eyes beheld was the figure of a huge lion standing {{in the center of the}} temple, and already a single victim lay mangled beneath his cruel paws.|$|R
60|$|For a {{long time}} the Leiter stood, toying with his rod. At last he pushed it back in his belt and signalled the {{soldiers}} <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> lock.|$|E
60|$|He looked around. The {{soldiers}} had wandered away again, back <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> of the building. They were standing outside, {{looking at the}} valley and the sky. A few of them were carefully climbing down the slope.|$|E
60|$|They {{were armed}} with bludgeons and knives, and {{fortified}} in their courage by fanatical hate and frenzy. Werper was terrified. Tarzan stood eyeing the foe in proud disdain. Slowly he advanced <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> {{he had chosen}} to utilize in making his way from the temple. A burly priest barred his way. Behind {{the first was a}} score of others. Tarzan swung his heavy spear, clublike, down upon the skull of the priest. The fellow collapsed, his head crushed.|$|E

50|$|That afternoon, a {{combined}} {{force of the}} RIC, the Dublin Metropolitan Police, the Auxiliary Division, the RICRF, and the British Army stormed Croke Park during a Gaelic football match. Accompanied by an armoured car which remained outside the pitch, security forces were under orders to stop the game and search all males {{to see if anyone}} was carrying firearms. Instead, the Auxiliaries and Black and Tans opened fire within the stadium. As the panicking crowd stampeded <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>exits,</b> more than 228 rounds were fired from small arms and 50 from the armoured car. The shooting left 15 people dead (12 men, 1 woman, and 2 children) and 60 wounded, of whom 11 had to be detained in hospital.|$|R
60|$|This {{and much}} more passed through Tarzan's memory as he stood gazing at the long tiers of dull-yellow metal. He {{wondered}} if La still ruled the temples of the ruined city whose crumbling walls rose upon the very foundations about him. Had she finally been forced into a union {{with one of her}} grotesque priests? It seemed a hideous fate, indeed, for one so beautiful. With a shake of his head, Tarzan stepped to the flickering candle, extinguished its feeble rays and turned <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>exit.</b>|$|E
60|$|I {{now turned}} my {{attention}} to Dejah Thoris, and assisting {{her to her feet}} I turned with her <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>exit,</b> ignoring her hovering guardian harpies as well as the inquiring glances of the chieftains. Was I not now a chieftain also! Well, then, I would assume the responsibilities of one. They did not molest us, and so Dejah Thoris, Princess of Helium, and John Carter, gentleman of Virginia, followed by the faithful Woola, passed through utter silence from the audience chamber of Lorquas Ptomel, Jed among the Tharks of Barsoom.|$|E

50|$|The Wildcats stifled BYU quarterback Max Hall {{throughout}} the game, {{forcing him to}} scramble often, lose a fumble and throw an interception. Arizona (8-5) kept {{the ball in the}} air most of the game. Tuitama threw a 71-yard pass to WR Terrell Turner that set up the first score, a 37-yard touchdown to WR Delashaun Dean that gave the Wildcats the lead for good in the third quarter, and a 24-yard strike to RB Chris Gronkowski that sent Cougars fans <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>exits</b> (Tuitama would run 6 yards into the end zone to complete the drive). The Wildcats' third-quarter scoring spree salvaged an otherwise-unlucky period. Arizona thought it had recovered a fumble three plays earlier, when BYU WR Austin Collie caught a screen pass, took a step, ran into his own blocker and fumbled. UA safety Nate Ness recovered at BYU's 11. The game's referee crew opted to review the play, and ruled that Collie had never demonstrated possession. The Cougars completed a short pass on third down, then punted. Arizona's five days in Las Vegas {{had a little bit of}} everything — fun, drama and even questions about Mike Stoops' job future (Stoops was rumored to be a candidate for the vacant Iowa State head coach position which was filled by Auburn assistant coach Paul Rhoads).|$|R

She then bolts <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> museum's <b>exit,</b> concerning <b>the</b> guards and other patrons. She makes it out of the building just moments before the bomb explodes. After the explosion, she re-enters the building to find all the unarmed visitors and the man from the altar, who appears to have been just wakened by the blast.

50|$|Eventually Peterson {{is sent to}} a {{psychiatric}} hospital where he continues to rebel against those charged with the duty of controlling him. In response, Peterson is kept heavily drugged which makes him physically weak. His first escape attempt is merely to walk sluggishly <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> until he is calmly thwarted by a staffer standing nearby who waves him into a chair. Later, he decides to escape by earning himself a transfer back to prison. He attempts to strangle another detainee with his socks, but is apprehended before killing the man, which means {{he will not be}} transferred. He comments to the audience that despite all his prison time and solitary confinement, he has never yet killed anyone.|$|E

In 2003, Morris further stated that Clinton cocked his arm back to throw a punch, but Hillary Clinton pulled her husband off Morris. In both versions of the story, she consoled Morris and apologized to him, stating that Bill behaved as such only with those he cared for most. According to Morris, she did this to keep him quiet about the incident. He says the incident {{was the reason for}} denying Bill Clinton's request to work on the 1992 campaign.|$|E

40|$|AbstractNascent-peptide {{modulation}} {{of translation}} {{is a common}} regulatory mechanism of gene expression. In this mechanism, while the nascent peptide is still in <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> tunnel of <b>the</b> ribosome, it induces translational pausing, thereby controlling the expression of downstream genes. One example is SecM, which inhibits peptide-bond formation in the ribosome's peptidyl transferase center (PTC) during its own translation, upregulating {{the expression of the}} protein translocase SecA. Although biochemical experiments and cryo-electron microscopy data have led to the identification of some residues involved in SecM recognition, the full pathway of interacting residues that connect SecM to the PTC through the ribosome has not yet been conclusively established. Here, using the cryo-electron microscopy data, we derived the first (to our knowledge) atomic model of the SecM-stalled ribosome via molecular-dynamics flexible fitting, complete with P- and A-site tRNAs. Subsequently, we carried out simulations of native and mutated SecM-stalled ribosomes to investigate possible interaction pathways between a critical SecM residue, R 163, and the PTC. In particular, the simulations reveal the role of SecM in altering the position of the tRNAs in the ribosome, and thus demonstrate how the presence of SecM in <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> tunnel induces stalling. Finally, steered molecular-dynamics simulations in which SecM was pulled <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> tunnel <b>exit</b> suggest how SecA interacting with SecM from outside the ribosome relieves stalling...|$|R
25|$|The attack {{began at}} around 10:30A.M. when six gunmen, wearing {{explosive}} belts entered the school {{from the back}} through a cemetery adjacent to the school after having scaled the walls. Army Public School is located at Warsak Road near the Peshawar Cantt, and is part of Army Public Schools and College Systems that runs 146 schools in Pakistan. Before entering the school, the gunmen {{set fire to the}} Suzuki Bolan ST41 van in which they had arrived. The terrorists, bearing automatic weapons,and grenades, moved straight <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> auditorium located at the centre of the complex and opened fire indiscriminately on the children who were gathered there for First aid training. According to the Director General of the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the public relations department of the Pakistani military, Major-General Asim Bajwa, the terrorists did not intend to take any hostages but instead wanted to kill as many pupils as they could. As the terrorists opened fire, many of <b>the</b> pupils ran <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> two <b>exits</b> on <b>the</b> other side of the auditorium, but many of them were gunned down in the garden.|$|R
