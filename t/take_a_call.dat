The first call letter is always C, and callsigns of privately owned television stations start with the two-letter combinations of CF, CH, CI, CJ, or CK. The combinations CG, CY, CZ and several combinations beginning with V and X are also assigned to Canada, but to date no Canadian television station has ever been licensed to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>call</b> sign within those ranges. There is no clear rule for the call letters of rebroadcasterssome are labelled by the call-letters of the originating station, followed by a number, while others have their own distinct call letters.

[...] Lameda was not calling for a coup, he said, although he and other opponents of Chávez hoped that anti-Chávez demonstrations would grow so large that Chávez would have to crack down, whereupon the military would be faced with the decision of whether to enforce his orders or not.|$|E
