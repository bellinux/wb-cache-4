5|$|Gate towers, one on {{each side}} of the gate and {{projecting}} out from the gate to allow defenders to shoot into the area in front of the entrance. The gates <b>themselves</b> <b>were</b> normally wooden with metal covering plates to prevent destruction by fire. Some gates had portcullises. Postern gates were built into towers or near them to allow sorties.|$|E
5|$|The beaches <b>themselves</b> <b>were</b> {{overlooked}} by pillboxes of various types. These were sometimes placed low {{down to get}} maximum advantage from enfilading fire whereas others were placed high up making them much harder to capture. Searchlights were installed at the coast to illuminate the sea surface and the beaches for artillery fire.|$|E
5|$|The {{slightly}} haphazard {{nature of}} the cricket tournament was mirrored {{throughout the rest of}} the 1900 Olympics. Events took place throughout a six-month period from May through until October, and like the Games <b>themselves,</b> <b>were</b> often considered part of the Exposition Universelle, a world's fair held in Paris from 15 April until 12 November 1900.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} {{companies}} were affected by inability to reach their premises even where the premises <b>themselves</b> <b>were</b> largely unaffected by the blast. Criticism was expressed by local citizens and the local MP that originally the depot had been constructed away from other buildings, but that developmental pressures had led to both houses and commercial premises being built near the depot.|$|E
5|$|Air-landing {{obstacles}} {{were not}} the only tactic Rommel used against aerial invaders. Rommel ordered the flooding of some fields so that glider troops and paratroops landing in the water would drown. He ordered machine gun crews to cover the exits of fields that were bounded by bocage—tall, dense hedgerows—so that glider infantry and paratroopers would come under fire as they moved out of their landing area. The bocage hedgerows <b>themselves</b> <b>were</b> the worse hazard to safe glider landings, and caused more glider casualties than Rommelspargel.|$|E
5|$|Although most U.S. {{aircraft}} losses {{continued to}} be inflicted by anti-aircraft fire, U.S. Air Force F-105s and Navy A-4 Skyhawks increasingly encountered SAMs and MiGs. North Vietnamese fighters also became a particular problem {{because of the lack}} of radar coverage in the Red River Delta region, which allowed the MiGs to surprise the strike forces. Airborne early warning aircraft had difficulty detecting the fighters at low altitudes and the aircraft <b>themselves</b> <b>were</b> difficult to see visually.|$|E

5|$|Arsenal {{were missing}} defender Sol Campbell from their team {{after the death}} of his father, and manager Arsène Wenger dropped wingers Robert Pirès and Sylvain Wiltord in favour of Ray Parlour and Fredrik Ljungberg, {{creating}} a more physical midfield. Wenger's tactics worked, as the Arsenal defence withstood the pressure from the Manchester United attack. United <b>themselves</b> <b>were</b> without Paul Scholes due to injury, and they played a 4–3–2–1 formation with Phil Neville, Roy Keane and Quinton Fortune completing a defensively minded midfield.|$|E
5|$|At {{least partly}} {{explaining}} why both Lamb and Hazlitt felt {{the inadequacy of}} Shakespearean stage performances was that the theatres <b>themselves</b> <b>were</b> huge and gaudy, audiences were noisy and unmannerly, and dramatic presentations {{in the early nineteenth}} century were sensationalistic, laden with artificial and showy props. In addition, unless one sat down in the pit, one could easily miss the subtleties of the actors' facial and vocal expressions.|$|E
5|$|Characteristic of {{the turn}} of the 10th century in most Polish tribal {{settlement}} areas was a particular intensification of gord building activity. The gords were the centers of social and political life. Tribal leaders and elders had their headquarters in their protected environment and some of the tribal general assemblies took place inside them. Religious cult locations were commonly located in the vicinity, while the gords <b>themselves</b> <b>were</b> frequently visited by traders and artisans.|$|E

5|$|HMS Agamemnon {{was ordered}} in 1904 {{and was the}} first warship built by the William Beardmore and Company's Dalmuir Naval Construction Works. She was laid down on 15 May 1905 and {{launched}} on 23 June 1906 before the dockyards <b>themselves</b> <b>were</b> finished. Her completion was greatly delayed by labour troubles and by the diversion of the 12-inch (305mm) guns intended for her to expedite completion of HMS Dreadnought, and she was not finally completed until June 1908, six months before her sister Lord Nelson.|$|E
5|$|His first {{project for}} Webb and Knapp was an {{apartment}} building with funding from the Housing Act of 1949. Pei's design {{was based on a}} circular tower with concentric rings. The areas closest to the supporting pillar handled utilities and circulation; the apartments <b>themselves</b> <b>were</b> located toward the outer edge. Zeckendorf loved the design and even showed it off to Le Corbusier when they met. The cost of such an unusual design was too high, however, and the building never moved beyond the model stage.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, {{four new}} {{performances}} were scheduled, taking stage in Tokyo, Stockholm, and a reprise in Cologne. These performances featured slightly modified {{versions of the}} original arrangements, and like the original concerts, were sold out. Another performance was held in London in October 2016 by the London Symphony Orchestra. The original concert and the Tokyo concert both sparked the release of an album. These albums, along with the concerts <b>themselves,</b> <b>were</b> heavily praised, both {{for the quality of}} the performance and for the quality of Valtonen's arrangements, which overlaid themes from multiple pieces rather than relying on a traditional medley.|$|E

A U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation resulted in convictions against the McDougals for their role in the Whitewater project, but the Clintons <b>themselves</b> <b>were</b> never charged, and Clinton maintains his and his wife's innocence in the affair.|$|E
5|$|R. Gordon Wasson {{recounted the}} details of these deaths, noting the {{likelihood}} of Amanita poisoning. In the case of Clement VII, the illness {{that led to his}} death lasted five months, making the case inconsistent with amatoxin poisoning (p.110). Natalia Naryshkina is said to have consumed a large quantity of pickled mushrooms prior to her death. It is unclear whether the mushrooms <b>themselves</b> <b>were</b> poisonous or if she succumbed to food poisoning.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the local}} beliefs were perhaps less welcome to the {{practitioners}} of organised religion.

The curative powers of the seventh son of a seventh son were assumed to be sufficient for the treatment of diseases as serious as tuberculosis.

5|$|The Church of San Benedetto in Catania (Illustrations 15 and 16) is a {{fine example}} of a Sicilian Baroque interior, {{decorated}} between 1726 and 1762, the period when Sicilian Baroque was at the height of its fashion and individuality. The ceilings were frescoed by the artist Giovanni Tuccari. The most spectacular part of the church's decoration is the nun's choir (Illustrations 16), created c. 1750, which was designed {{in such a way that}} the nuns' voices could be heard during services, but the nuns <b>themselves</b> <b>were</b> still quite separate from and unseen by the less spiritual world outside.|$|E
5|$|The Territorial Force now {{constituted}} 204 infantry battalions (ten {{of which}} were organised as bicycle infantry) and 56 Yeomanry regiments, organised into fourteen divisions and fourteen cavalry brigades, along with associated support troops. A new all-Territorial regiment, the London Regiment, was formed to encompass twenty-seven battalions which had previously been associated with various regular regiments. The divisional troops were raised and administered by the County Associations, whilst the divisions <b>themselves</b> <b>were</b> operationally commanded by regular staff officers. Outside of the divisional structure, a Territorial Medical Corps was created, followed by a Territorial Association Nursing Service.|$|E
