500|$|Much of the {{argument}} for Al-Kateb centred {{on the fact that}} he was a stateless man. Kateb's lawyer, O'Connor, noted that the provisions in the Migration Act about refugees were based on the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, both of which overlooked the situation of stateless persons. Several exchanges during the hearings illustrated the way in which the usual processes of the immigration system were not adapted well, if at all, to dealing with stateless people. In one such exchange, O'Connor referred to Al-Kateb both by his name and by the identifier used on the formal documents, [...] "SHDB" [...] (in matters concerning asylum seekers, names are usually suppressed in order to prevent persecution should they return to their country of origin). After some debate about whether to suppress Al-Kateb's name, Justice Kirby said that [...] "there often is a very good reason... because people suffer great risks if their name goes on the Internet <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> become known to the country that they want to avoid," [...] to which Al-Kateb's lawyer replied, [...] "That is correct, but, of course, with Mr Al-Kateb there is no country." ...|$|E
