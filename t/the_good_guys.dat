25|$|It {{is easy to}} {{tell who}} the bad guys are – they are almost {{invariably}} white, male, and middle-class or better, while <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>guys</b> are almost invariably non-white, non-male, or non-middle class....

25|$|Carey Henderson, Speakeasy (November 5, 2002) — Timothy Hutton, {{along with}} the ever pompous Maury Chaykin, stars in—and directs—this amazing weekly 'who done it' on A … Wolfe takes us {{back to a time}} (or maybe just {{transports}} us to a new one) where television could be good.

2500|$|The album's closing song, [...] "Blood", {{was written}} and sung by drummer Vince Nudo, {{who is an}} avid vampire mythology enthusiast. The song centers on a {{conflict}} between <b>good</b> and evil, <b>the</b> latter personified as a vampire. Intentionally leaving the song open to interpretation {{as to whether the}} conflict depicted is a literal one, Nudo said, [...] "I think everyone has encountered a vampire (off the screen or pages of a book). I guess the hero is <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>guy</b> who sees what's coming and battles their way out. But in this song <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>guy</b> loses." ...|$|R

500|$|On February 13, 1982, President Ronald Reagan, {{himself a}} former film actor and {{president}} of the Screen Actors Guild, screened the film in the White House. He noted in his diary: [...] "Ran Inchon—it is a brutal but gripping picture about the Korean War and for once we're <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>guys</b> and the Communists are the villains. The producer was Japanese or Korean which probably explains the preceding sentence".|$|E
500|$|Kansas City Star – [...] "this {{is but one}} of {{a series}} of high court rulings in recent months that have {{effectively}} nipped away at the Miranda ruling. ... Perhaps because it is occurring incrementally, few outside the legal community have taken note of the trend... And besides, as long as <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>guys</b> win out over the bad, who cares how we get there, right?... We ought to care.... eal for fighting crime shouldn't be allowed to undercut American standards like 'innocent until proven guilty'." [...] It concluded that Sotomayor—the newest justice at the court—seemed to understand that [...] "ood policing is based on building cases, not on coercing confessions. ... What's the matter with the conservatives on the court?" ...|$|E
500|$|Cameron {{argued that}} [...] "the film is {{definitely}} not anti-American" [...] and that [...] "part of being an American is having the freedom to have dissenting ideas." [...] A critic for MTV concurred that [...] "it'd take a great leap of logic to tag 'Avatar' as anti-American or anti-capitalist." [...] Ann Marlowe called the film [...] "the most neo-con movie ever made" [...] for its [...] "deeply conservative, pro-American message". [...] But Cameron admitted to some ambiguity on the issue, agreeing that [...] "the bad guys could be America in this movie, or <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>guys</b> could be America in this movie, depending on your perspective", and stated that Avatars defeat at the Academy Awards might {{have been due to}} the perceived anti-U.S. theme in it.|$|E
50|$|J-ok'el is a Mexican thriller of 2007, {{directed}} by Benjamin Williams. The film deviates {{from the usual}} stories about spirits showing an ending where <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>guy</b> do not always win. This film was William's debut.|$|R

500|$|Less than a {{month after}} the shootout it was {{described}} by a local newspaper as the [...] "Gunfight at The O.K. Corral". William Breakenridge in his 1928 book Helldorado: Bringing Law to the Mesquite described it as [...] "The Incident Near the O.K. Corral." [...] Stuart Lake titled his chapter about the conflict [...] "At the O.K. Corral" [...] in his popular book [...] But it was the popular movie Gunfight at the O.K. Corral that cemented the incident and its erroneous location in popular consciousness. The movie and accompanying mythologizing also altered the way that the public thought of the Earps and the outlaws. Prior to the movie, the media often criticized the Earps' actions in Tombstone. In the movies, they became <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>guys,</b> always ready to stand for what is right.|$|E
500|$|The Los Espantos trio {{got their}} biggest win ever when they {{defeated}} the [...] "dream team" [...] of Mexican tecnicos (those that portray <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>guys)</b> El Santo, Blue Demon and Mil Máscaras. In the early parts of 1964 Espanto III won two additional Lucha de Apuestas matches, leaving both Alex Montaña and Humberto Garza without their hair as a result. The Apuesta wins {{were used to}} build a storyline feud between Espanto III and Huracán Ramírez through {{the first half of}} 1964. The storyline came to a conclusion on June 12, 1964 where Espanto III was unmasked after losing a Lucha de Apuestas match to Ramírez. As each Espanto lost their mask they claimed that their last name was [...] "Vázquez Cisneros", combining their last names {{to hide the fact that}} they were not all brothers.|$|E
500|$|The story {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews. IGN's Ed Lewis said it [...] "admirably [...] the bizarre and fantastically medieval {{world that was}} established in the original game.", while GameSpot's Greg Meuller called it [...] "Interesting [...] with plenty of twists and turns". Eurogamer's Simon Parkin cited the story as being very good, though he found Nowe [...] "a little nauseating to watch as the weighty, dark (and pretty good) plot unfolds", and VideoGamer.com's Adam Jarvis called the story [...] "one of the highlights of the package". The 1UP reviewer called the [...] "clear undercurrent of [...] "maybe <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>guys</b> are the bad guys,"" [...] {{one of the main reasons}} to keep playing the game. In contrast, the reviewer for GameTrailers called it [...] "a cookie-cutter RPG plot" [...] where players could [...] "predict nearly every plot twist the game throws at [...]", ...|$|E
25|$|Another {{negotiation}} tactic is bad guy/good guy. Bad guy/good guy is {{when one}} negotiator {{acts as a}} bad guy by using anger and threats. The other negotiator acts as a <b>good</b> <b>guy</b> by being considerate and understanding. <b>The</b> <b>good</b> <b>guy</b> blames <b>the</b> bad guy for all the difficulties while trying to get concessions and agreement from the opponent.|$|R

500|$|Most {{newspaper}} reviewers gave Inchon negative reviews; {{among them}} were The Boston Globe, The Philadelphia Inquirer, [...] The Miami Herald, [...] and The Washington Post. [...] In The New York Times, critic Vincent Canby commented, [...] "Inchon is a hysterical historical epic, somewhat less offensive than The Green Berets and far funnier. ... 'Inchon' looks like the most expensive B-movie ever made." [...] A review in the influential entertainment-trade magazine Variety commented, [...] "Olivier is convincing in his role {{throughout most of the}} saga, {{the only member of the}} cast to achieve that status. [...] Screenplay [...] generally treats all others as one-dimensional buffoons, giving them lines that are unintentionally laughable. One reason is that all plot digressions are simply window dressing to the film's focus on the brutally invading North Koreans and the big-scale counterattack by <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>guys.</b> No speaking roles are given to the Communists, for example." ...|$|E
500|$|On November 9, 2007, Jay-Z {{appeared}} on the Charlie Rose Show to discuss the album. When asked about how the film gave life to this album, he stated [...] "It's a New York City true story, you know. So {{as soon as the}} movie came on, it was like familiar, things that my pop seen and my uncles seen and, you know, different things like that, things I've seen growing up. So they resonated with me in a way, the story, as well as, I mean, even though everything happens, you know, the way it turns out, you know, it's one of those movies that where you champion the bad guy, because the bad guy, you know, he don't seem like a bad guy, and the good guy — I mean <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>guys</b> are bad. You know, that complex — the complexity of human beings in this thing was amazing to me. I loved the complexity of the human beings".|$|E
500|$|Desmond Ryan of The Philadelphia Inquirer {{thought that}} Leslie Nielsen was deceptively portrayed {{in a major}} role {{similar to that of}} Lieutenant Frank Drebin from The Naked Gun films, instead having merely [...] "a running and unfunny gag about his {{malfunctioning}} answering machine and generally wasted otherwise". [...] Ryan also found the film's dialogue to be [...] "painful" [...] and considered Surf Ninjas to be [...] "beyond airheaded". [...] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle considered the story of Surf Ninjas to be [...] "harmless and painfully dull". LaSalle thought that the pacing of the film was too long with only [...] "two smirks over the course of 90 minutes". [...] Sean Piccoli of The Washington Times thought that the film's [...] "dull stretch" [...] was buoyed by the presence of Rob Schneider. [...] Piccoli compared the martial arts choreography in the film to the [...] "cartoon fantasies that little boys re-enact on neighbors' lawns: <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>guys,</b> alone and outnumbered by the charging horde, air-punch their way to glory".|$|E
