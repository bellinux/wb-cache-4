The model, which stratifies the total population in terms of age and gender, incorporates an imperfect anti-HPV vaccine with some therapeutic benefits. Rigorous qualitative analysis of the resulting age-structured model, which {{takes the form of}} a deterministic system of non-linear partial differential equations with separable transmission coefficients, shows that the disease-free equilibrium of the model is locallyasymptotically stable whenever the effective reproduction number (denoted by Rv) is less than unity. It is shown to be globally-asymptotically stable if certain additional conditions hold. Furthermore, it is shown that the model has at least one endemic equilibrium when Rv exceeds unity. Hence, the effective control of HPV spread in a community, using a vaccine, is governed by the <b>threshold</b> <b>quantity</b> Rv (the use of the vaccine will lead to effective disease control or elimination only if it reduces the <b>threshold</b> <b>quantity</b> to a value less than unity; and the use of such vaccine will not lead to effective disease control if it fails to make the <b>threshold</b> <b>quantity</b> to be less than unity) ...|$|E
