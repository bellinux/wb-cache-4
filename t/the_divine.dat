5|$|<b>The</b> <b>divines</b> {{were even}} more {{strongly}} opposed to Catholicism than to William Laud and his followers, the Laudians. They associated both Catholicism and Laudianism with Arminianism and persecution. Before the civil war, <b>the</b> <b>divines</b> saw these two groups as {{the greatest threat to}} the church. With the rise of radical sectarian movements during <b>the</b> war, <b>the</b> <b>divines</b> became much more concerned with these groups than polemics against Catholicism. <b>The</b> <b>divines</b> were particularly concerned with those they labeled antinomians. This was a loose term for those who saw the moral law as in some way no longer relevant for Christians. <b>The</b> <b>divines</b> saw these groups as more immediately threatening than Catholicism.|$|R

This sequence is to be interpreted by <b>the</b> <b>diviner</b> with regards to certain rules, which are usually specific to his/her religion (e.g. Buddhism).|$|R
5|$|According to Tacitus's Germania (AD 98), Tuisto (or Tuisco) is <b>the</b> <b>divine</b> {{ancestor}} of the Germanic peoples.

5|$|Beliefs in <b>the</b> <b>divine</b> and in {{the afterlife}} were {{ingrained}} in ancient Egyptian civilization from its inception; pharaonic rule was based on <b>the</b> <b>divine</b> right of kings. The Egyptian pantheon was populated by gods who had supernatural powers and were called on for help or protection. However, the gods were not always viewed as benevolent, and Egyptians believed {{they had to be}} appeased with offerings and prayers. The structure of this pantheon changed continually as new deities were promoted in the hierarchy, but priests made no effort to organize the diverse and sometimes conflicting myths and stories into a coherent system. These various conceptions of divinity were not considered contradictory but rather layers in the multiple facets of reality.|$|E
50|$|Protection from sorcery is {{afforded by}} a diviner by {{recourse}} to amulets, for which <b>the</b> <b>diviner</b> might take payment for, or alternatively, <b>the</b> <b>diviner</b> might {{assist with the}} direct punishment of a sorcerer by occult means, for the explicit reason of effecting a cure for the affliction.|$|R

A sceptical Zulu, named John, having a shilling to expend on psychical research, smote violently at every guess. <b>The</b> <b>diviner</b> was hopelessly puzzled; John kept his shilling, and laid it out on a much more meritorious exhibition of animated sticks.[24] ...|$|R

These works show that Euler was a devout Christian who believed the Bible to be inspired; the Rettung was primarily an argument for <b>the</b> <b>divine</b> inspiration of scripture.|$|E

50|$|Alectryomancy (also called alectoromancy or alectromancy; {{derivation}} {{comes from}} the Greek words ἀλεκτρυών alectryon and μαντεία manteia, which mean rooster and divination respectively) {{is a form of}} divination in which <b>the</b> <b>diviner</b> observes a bird, several birds, or most preferably a white rooster or cockerel pecking at grain (such as wheat) that <b>the</b> <b>diviner</b> has scattered on the ground. It was the responsibility of the pullularius to feed and keep the birds used. The observer may place grain in the shape of letters and thus discern a divinatory revelation by noting which letters the birds peck at, or <b>the</b> <b>diviner</b> may just interpret the pattern left by the birds' pecking in randomly scattered grain.|$|R

5|$|Priestley {{strongly}} {{suggested that}} there is no mind-body duality, and put forth a materialist philosophy in these works; that is, one founded on the principle that everything in the universe is made of matter that we can perceive. He also contended that discussing the soul is impossible because it is made of a divine substance, and humanity cannot perceive <b>the</b> <b>divine.</b> Despite his separation of <b>the</b> <b>divine</b> from the mortal, this position shocked and angered many of his readers, who believed that such a duality was necessary for the soul to exist.|$|E

5|$|Shaktism's {{focus on}} <b>the</b> <b>Divine</b> Feminine {{does not imply}} a {{rejection}} of masculine. It rejects male-female, soul-body, transcendent-immanent dualism, considering nature as divine.

Yet in Shaktism, states C. MacKenzie Brown, the masculine and the feminine are aspects of <b>the</b> <b>divine,</b> transcendent reality. In Hindu iconography, the cosmic dynamic of masculine-feminine interdependence and equivalence, is expressed in the half-Shakti, half-Shiva deity known as Ardhanari.|$|E
