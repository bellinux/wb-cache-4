5|$|Faramir's {{decision}} {{to reject the}} One Ring shows influences from a kind of courage and behaviour that was known to Tolkien from the medieval poem The Battle of Maldon.

40|$|We propose in {{this paper}} an {{extension}} of the multi-anticipative optimal velocity car-following model to consider explicitly <b>the</b> <b>desired</b> following distance. <b>The</b> model on the following vehicle’s acceleration is formulated as a linear function of the optimal velocity and <b>the</b> <b>desired</b> distance, with reaction-time delay in elements. The linear stability condition of the model is derived. The results demonstrate that the stability of traffic flow is improved by introducing <b>the</b> <b>desired</b> following distance, increasing the time gap in <b>the</b> <b>desired</b> following distance or decreasing the reaction-time delay. The simulation results show that by taking into account <b>the</b> <b>desired</b> following distance as well as the optimal velocity, the multi-anticipative model allows longer reaction-time delay in achieving stable traffic flows...|$|R
30|$|After {{reagents}} {{are loaded}} into the reaction vessel, a reaction can be performed by sealing the vessel against a sealing position on the gasket of the cassette (Figures  4 and 5). The reactor is then heated to <b>the</b> <b>desired</b> temperature, with optional stirring. Once <b>the</b> <b>desired</b> elevated temperature is reached in the heating jacket, heating and stirring are continued for <b>the</b> <b>desired</b> reaction time. After this time elapses, the heaters are turned off and the cooling pump is activated until the heating jacket reaches <b>the</b> <b>desired</b> reduced temperature. Additional cooling of the reaction vessel is necessary to ensure the internal liquid temperature is sufficiently lowered; <b>the</b> <b>desired</b> additional time for cooling can be programmed in the software.|$|R

Aspect released their final novel on March 1, 2004; written by Devin K. Grayson, City chronicled Clark and Lex's trip to Metropolis. While in the city, the pair got caught between the Japanese mafia and a secret agent who believed he has found an alien.
