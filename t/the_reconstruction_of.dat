The BP section of the site {{is a good way}} from the explosion and survived with very little damage, but it was inoperative as of 2009. BP is exploring plans for the future use of this part of the site, and has indicated a number of priorities, including the reopening of the fuel pipelines to Heathrow. It is considering using its section to store aviation fuel and as a distribution centre for motor fuel, but at a much-reduced level.

Licthon also constructed a new chapel dedicated to St John the Evangelist, and donated much of his own money to new service books and vestments, as well as to <b>the</b> <b>reconstruction</b> <b>of</b> the cathedral.

40|$|<b>The</b> {{separation}} and <b>reconstructions</b> <b>of</b> charged hadron and neutral hadron from their overlapped showers in electromagnetic calorimeter {{is very important}} for <b>the</b> <b>reconstructions</b> <b>of</b> some particles with hadronic decays, for example <b>the</b> tau <b>reconstruction</b> in <b>the</b> searches for the Standard Model and supersymmetric Higgs bosons at the LHC. In this paper, a method combining the shower cluster in electromagnetic calorimeter and the parametric formula for hadron showers, was developed to separate the overlapped showers between charged hadron and neutral hadron. Taking the hadronic decay containing one charged pion and one neutral pion in the final status of tau for example, satisfied results of the separation of the overlapped showers, <b>the</b> <b>reconstructions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> energy and positions of the hadrons were obtained. An improved result for <b>the</b> tau <b>reconstruction</b> with this decay model can be also achieved after the application of the proposed method. Comment: 7 page...|$|R

Construction of the entire route was completed in 2006; further development entails new exits, new rest areas and <b>the</b> <b>reconstruction</b> <b>of</b> the existing motorway.

5|$|In poor {{condition}} {{in the mid-nineteenth}} century, the nave walls were leaning outward and the roofs decayed, so restoration was proposed in 1848 under R.K. Penson, but not actively pursued until the Reverend John Pugh became vicar in 1861, when new plans were made by William Butterfield. Butterfield however resigned in 1867 and the restoration was finally carried out 1867–84 by John Pollard Seddon. The church was substantially restored in stages {{at a cost of}} £8,500, and the roof was renewed, apart from the wagon roof over the chancel, which survives above Seddon's roof. The restoration work in general consisted of <b>the</b> <b>reconstruction</b> <b>of</b> the nave, the lifting and paving of the chancel, {{the construction of a new}} altar and <b>the</b> <b>reconstruction</b> <b>of</b> the north and south transepts. The nave was opened in 1869 and the tower and south transepts were opened in 1880.|$|E
