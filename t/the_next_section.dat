5|$|East of Westminster, <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>section</b> of the District's line {{ran in the}} new Victoria Embankment {{built by}} the Metropolitan Board of Works along the north bank of the River Thames. The line opened from Westminster to Blackfriars on 30 May 1870 with {{stations}} at Charing Cross (now Embankment), The Temple (now Temple) and Blackfriars.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the station}} started in 1918 and was {{finished}} in 1921. The station, excluding its water tower and restaurant, cost 117,062 Norwegian krone (NOK) to build and took 26,883 man-hours. The station and axillary buildings were designed by Gudmund Hoel of NSB Arkitektkontor. The station opened with {{the first part of}} the Rauma Line on 19 November 1921. It remained the terminus until 25 November 1923, when <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>section,</b> to Verma Station, opened.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>section</b> {{accuses the}} Dissenters of {{involvement}} with various notorious and hideous {{events of the}} past century, including the English Civil War and Monmouth's Rebellion. The accusations become increasingly sinister, and at points the speaker directly addresses the Dissenters ("You have butchered one King! deposed another King! and made a Mock King of a third!"). A brief history is given of how past monarchs—from James I to William III—have treated the Dissenters; in the opinion of the speaker, it is too leniently.|$|E

5|$|In 1929, the routing from Allegan to Martin {{was removed}} and renumbered M-118, and M-40 was {{extended}} to the north out of Allegan along M-89 and its modern routing to a new terminus in Holland ending at US31. By the middle of 1960, the US131 was opened {{as far south as}} Martin; the section of M-118 between the new freeway and the old routing was used as a connector until <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>section</b> south to Plainwell opened the next year. After this next freeway segment was opened, M-118 was truncated to end at the freeway.|$|E
5|$|In {{works from}} Jeux vénitiens, Lutosławski wrote long {{passages}} {{in which the}} parts of the ensemble are not to be synchronised exactly. At cues from the conductor each instrumentalist may be instructed to move straight on to <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>section,</b> to finish their current section before moving on, or to stop. In this way the random elements within compositionally controlled limits defined by the term aleatory are carefully directed by the composer, who controls the architecture and harmonic progression of the piece precisely. Lutosławski notated the music exactly; there is no improvisation, no choice of parts is given to any instrumentalist, and there is thus no doubt about how the musical performance is to be realised.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} less action-oriented {{segments}} in the game, where players have to solve environmental puzzles, which usually {{function as a}} 3D platformer. With time stuttering and collapsing, objects may get trapped in a time loop and either become platforms for players to proceed into <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>section</b> of the game, or create dangerous environmental hazards, which are extremely unstable. In the latter case they become obstacles that block the player's path. Jack can overcome them by using his time manipulation powers, such as slowing down or stopping time, {{so that he can}} proceed without getting hurt. He can also revive frozen non-playable characters at several specific points of the game.|$|E

5|$|In another {{hundred years}} or more two groups arrived and settled the upper San River basin (270–170 BC) and the Kraków area respectively. This last one, {{together}} with the local population developing at about that time the Przeworsk culture characteristics (see <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>section),</b> formed the mixed Tyniec group, in existence 270–30 BC. The rise of the Tyniec group took place in particular about 80–70 BC, when the existing settlements received Celtic reinforcements from the more southern populations being displaced from Slovakia by the Dacians. In the 1st century BC another small group settled probably much further north, in Kujawy. And finally there was the long-lasting (270 BC - 170 AD) mixed Púchov culture, associated based on Roman sources with the Celtic Cotini, whose northern reaches included parts of the Beskids mountain range and even the Kraków area.|$|E
5|$|The District {{also had}} {{parliamentary}} permission to extend westward from Brompton (Gloucester Road) station and, on 12 April 1869, it opened a single track line {{from there to}} West Brompton on the West London Railway. There were no intermediate stations and this service initially operated as a shuttle. By summer 1869 additional tracks had been laid between South Kensington to Brompton (Gloucester Road) and from Kensington (High Street) to a junction with the line to West Brompton. During the night of 5 July 1870 the District secretly built the disputed Cromwell curve connecting Brompton (Gloucester Road) and Kensington (High Street). East of Westminster, <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>section</b> ran in the newly constructed Victoria Embankment built by the Metropolitan Board of Works along the north bank of the River Thames. The line was opened from Westminster to Blackfriars on 30 May 1870 with stations at Charing Cross (now Embankment), The Temple (now Temple) and Blackfriars.|$|E
5|$|The glyphs are stylized human, animal, {{vegetable}} and geometric shapes, and often form compounds. Nearly all those with heads are oriented {{head up and}} are either seen face on or in profile to the right, {{in the direction of}} writing. It is not known what significance turning a glyph head-down or to the left may have had. Heads often have characteristic projections on the sides which may be eyes (as on the sea turtle glyph below, and more clearly on sea-turtle petroglyphs) but which often resemble ears (as on the anthropomorphic petroglyph in <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>section).</b> Birds are common; many resemble the frigatebird (see image directly below) which was associated with the supreme god Makemake. Other glyphs look like fish or arthropods. A few are similar to petroglyphs found throughout the island.|$|E

5|$|The {{right-hand}} {{side of the}} above equation is the sure information, i.e. information which can be certainly extracted from the database regardless of what values are used to replace Nulls in the database. In the example we considered above, it's {{easy to see that}} the intersection of all possible models (i.e. the sure information) of the query selecting WHERE Age = 22 is actually empty because, for instance, the (unlifted) query returns no rows for the relation EmpH37. More generally, it was shown by Imielinski and Lipski that Codd tables are a weak representation system if the query language is restricted to projections, selections (and renaming of columns). However, as soon as we add either joins or unions to the query language, even this weak property is lost, as evidenced in <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>section.</b>|$|E
5|$|After 1976, gaps in {{the belt}} route were present from 2100 North near the airport to SR-201 and from State Street in Murray to 4600 South in Holladay. The first step in {{completing}} the gap was taken in June 1979, when construction of the interstate from State Street to 700 East began. This {{was followed by the}} Cottonwood Inc. lawsuit being awarded in favor of UDOT in November 1979. In July 1985, the route from 280 East to Union Park Avenue was completed. At the time, this portion of road was the most expensive in the state in terms of cost per mile, due to the road being depressed below surrounding neighborhoods. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>section</b> to open was from 2100 North south to I-80 in 1987. This was followed by a section between Union Park Avenue and 2000 East, opened in November 1987, which was also built as a sunken freeway. The western quadrant of the freeway was completed in October 1988, closing the gap between SR-201 and I-80 (however, the California Avenue interchange wasn't opened until mid-1989). In August 1989, the road from 2000 East to 6200 South was finished, and the belt route was completed with the opening of freeway between 4500 South and 6200 South in October 1989.|$|E
5|$|Czech {{cross country}} skier and six-time Winter Olympic {{medalist}} Kateřina Neumannová was originally an honorary {{vice president of}} the organizing committee. On 25 July 2007, Neumannová was appointed as the new president of the organizing committee as approved by the organizing committee, replacing Kumpošt. She also served as a World Cup organizer for the second of the Tour de Ski events that took place in Prague on 30 December 2007. During the week of 13 August 2007, a delegation visited the FIS headquarters in Oberhofen, Switzerland and met with FIS President Kasper. This delegation included Liberec Mayor Jiří Kittner, Organizing Committee Secretary Marek Rejman, Czech Ski Association President Lukáš Sobotka, and its General Secretary Norbert Pelc, and all four confirmed the work toward the sites used for the championships were proceeding as planned with test events that occurred in February 2008. Financing issues for the event were also clarified. The next scheduled update occurred at the FIS Autumn Meeting in Zurich during the week of 24 September 2007. Progress was given by Organizing President Neumannová and Executive Director Marek Rejman while at Zurich, including updates on the venues (shown in <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>section),</b> and focused on the sports organization (including the technical directors); and the marketing and promotion of the test events. Liberec had also confirmed their support of the governmental financing for the university campus which served as the village for the teams in 2009.|$|E
