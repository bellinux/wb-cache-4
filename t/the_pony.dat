5|$|April 3, 2010 was <b>the</b> <b>Pony</b> Express' 150th anniversary. Located in St. Joseph, Missouri, the Patee House Museum, {{which was}} <b>the</b> <b>Pony</b> Express' headquarters, hosted events celebrating the anniversary.|$|E
5|$|In 1869, the United States Post Office {{issued the}} first U.S. Postage stamp to depict an actual {{historic}} event, {{and the subject}} that was chosen was <b>the</b> <b>Pony</b> Express. Until then only the faces of George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson {{were found on the}} face of U.S. Postage. Sometimes mistaken for an actual stamp used by <b>the</b> <b>Pony</b> Express, the 'Pony Express Stamp' issue was released in 1869 (8 years after <b>the</b> <b>Pony</b> Express service had ended) to honor the men who rode the long and sometimes dangerous journeys and to commemorate the service they provided for the nation. In 1940 and 1960 commemorative stamps were issued for the 80th and 100th anniversaries of <b>the</b> <b>Pony</b> Express respectively.|$|E
5|$|In {{the brief}} history that <b>the</b> <b>Pony</b> Express {{operated}} only once did the mail not go through. After completing eight weekly trips from both Sacramento and Saint Joseph, <b>the</b> <b>Pony</b> Express {{was forced to}} suspend mail services because of {{the outbreak of the}} Paiute Indian War in May 1860.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Galloway <b>pony</b> heavily {{influenced}} <b>the</b> Newfoundland <b>pony,</b> <b>the</b> Highland <b>Pony,</b> and <b>the</b> Fell <b>pony</b> of England. It died out through crossbreeding because its crossbred progeny were such useful animals, {{much like the}} Narragansett Pacer breed of Rhode Island.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> other <b>ponies</b> {{and forest}} animals {{are about to}} be covered by the Smooze as the witches watch from their ship. <b>The</b> Flutter <b>Ponies</b> come to <b>the</b> rescue and destroy the Smooze, with their magical wind, Utter Flutter, uncover the rainbow and drop the witches back into the volcano with the sticky goo. The Grundles are given the ruins of Dream Castle, all <b>the</b> <b>ponies</b> and Spike who were covered in Smooze are cleaned by the Flutter Ponies' Utter Flutter, and the Rainbow of Light is {{returned}} to <b>the</b> <b>ponies.</b> With all problems resolved, <b>the</b> <b>ponies</b> take Megan and her siblings back home.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Pony</b> Express route {{has been}} {{designated}} <b>the</b> <b>Pony</b> Express National Historic Trail. Approximately 120 historic sites along the trail may eventually {{be open to the}} public, including 50 stations or station ruins.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Pony</b> Express was a {{mail service}} {{delivering}} messages, newspapers, and mail.|$|E
5|$|Wells Fargo used <b>the</b> <b>Pony</b> Express logo for its {{guard and}} armored car service. The logo {{continued}} to be used when other companies took over the security business into the 1990s. Since 2001, <b>the</b> <b>Pony</b> Express logo is no longer used for security businesses since the business has been sold.|$|E
6000|$|... "I have ventured on the extravagance {{of taking}} <b>the</b> <b>ponies</b> and little {{carriage}} off my brother's hands, it is low enough for you, and I shall teach Rose to ride one of <b>the</b> <b>ponies</b> with me." ...|$|R

60|$|They rode fast, {{for it was}} {{possible}} that when the loss of <b>the</b> <b>ponies</b> was discovered someone who might have noticed them go down the street might set the Boers on the track, and in that case they would certainly be hotly pursued. <b>The</b> <b>ponies,</b> however, turned out to be good animals, and as the lads were {{at least a couple of}} stones lighter than the average Boer, they could not be overtaken unless some of <b>the</b> <b>ponies</b> happened to be a good deal better than these.|$|R
5|$|During its {{brief time}} in operation, <b>the</b> <b>Pony</b> Express {{delivered}} approximately 35,000 letters between St. Joseph, Missouri, and Sacramento, California. Although <b>the</b> <b>Pony</b> Express {{proved that the}} central/northern mail route was viable, Russell, Majors and Waddell {{did not get the}} contract to deliver mail over the route. The contract was instead awarded to Jeremy Dehut in March 1861, who had taken over the southern Congressionally favored Butterfield Overland Mail Stage Line. The so-called 'Stagecoach King', Ben Holladay, acquired the Russell, Majors and Waddell stations for his stagecoaches.|$|E
5|$|In 1866, {{after the}} Civil War was over, Holladay sold <b>the</b> <b>Pony</b> Express assets {{along with the}} {{remnants}} of the Butterfield Stage to Wells Fargo for $1.5 million.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{contract}} was awarded, {{the start of the}} American Civil War caused the stage line to cease operation. From March 1861, <b>the</b> <b>Pony</b> Express ran mail only between Salt Lake City and Sacramento. <b>The</b> <b>Pony</b> Express announced its closure on October 26, 1861, two days after the transcontinental telegraph reached Salt Lake City and connected Omaha, Nebraska, and Sacramento, California. Other telegraph lines connected points along the line and other cities on the east and west coasts.|$|E
60|$|Dismounting, {{they handed}} over <b>the</b> <b>ponies</b> to <b>the</b> {{servants}} and, taking {{the guns and}} ammunition, set out on foot. The servants were to go on, with <b>the</b> <b>ponies</b> and lunch, to a village in the hills, four miles distant; and to get tiffin ready, by eleven o'clock.|$|R
5000|$|Main Stage: <b>The</b> <b>Ponys,</b> <b>The</b> Fiery Furnaces, Vue, TV on the Radio, Har Mar Superstar, Blonde Redhead, Death Cab for Cutie ...|$|R

5|$|State Route 201 {{is one of}} the {{original}} highways through the Salt Lake Valley. Signs along the route claim the path of the highway to be the historical route of the California Trail, Pony Express and Lincoln Highway. While signed as the route of the California Trail, modern 2100 South is a less common branch called Hastings Cutoff that became infamous because of the Donner Party. The Lincoln Highway, generally derived from the route of <b>the</b> <b>Pony</b> Express across Utah, was routed on 2100 South. However, no modern highway exactly follows the route of <b>the</b> <b>Pony</b> Express west of Salt Lake City. SR-201 is one of a few auto-tour routes that approximates <b>the</b> <b>Pony</b> Express trail, which actually ran south of the road.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Pony</b> Express {{demonstrated}} that a unified transcontinental system of communications could be established and operated year-round. When {{replaced by the}} telegraph, <b>the</b> <b>Pony</b> Express quickly became romanticized and {{became part of the}} lore of the American West. Its reliance on the ability and endurance of individual young, hardy riders and fast horses was seen as evidence of rugged American individualism of the Frontier times.|$|E
5|$|The most {{complete}} books on <b>the</b> <b>Pony</b> Express are The Story of <b>the</b> <b>Pony</b> Express and Saddles and Spurs by Raymond & Mary Settle and Roy Bloss. Settle's account is unique {{as he was}} the first writer and historical researcher to make use of Pony Express founder William B. Waddell's papers, now in a collection at the Huntington Library in San Marino, California. Mr. Settle wrote in the mid-1950s. Mr. Bloss was a writer for <b>the</b> <b>Pony</b> Express Centennial. While Settle's work was published generally without his annotations and notes, the writer's background here is unique and Settle does have an excellent bibliography. When Settle prepared to publish his well-researched account he had a good volume of footnotes, citations prepared, but the editors chose not to use most of them. Instead, they opted for a less expensive approach to print and publish and released an accurate, but simplified account. Settle was not pleased with this new and sudden development, as he put much time and effort into the annotations. Yet, the account Settle wrote was and is a definitive one and is considered the best account on the history of <b>the</b> <b>Pony</b> Express amongst many historians.|$|E

50|$|My Little Pony Tales, premiered on July 3, 1992 on Disney Channel, {{was set in}} a {{different}} environment. This series anthropomorphized <b>the</b> <b>ponies</b> further than <b>the</b> works from the mid-1980s, as <b>the</b> <b>ponies</b> lived in a town, went to school, ran businesses, went on vacation and exchanged currency for goods.|$|R
5|$|The {{mountain}} {{is a popular}} destination, attracting an estimated 100,000 ascents a year, around three-quarters of which use <b>the</b> <b>Pony</b> Track from Glen Nevis.|$|E

5|$|When Homer's {{attempts}} to mend {{his relationship with}} Lisa fail, he buys her a pony with help from a loan through the Power Plant Credit Union. When Lisa wakes up one morning to find <b>the</b> <b>pony</b> (named Princess) lying next to her, she gallops into her parents' bedroom telling Homer she loves him. While Homer is happy, Marge is upset he ignored her warning {{that they could not}} afford <b>the</b> <b>pony.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Two schemes {{have been}} {{introduced}} to halt the decline in numbers, and broaden the gene pool of <b>the</b> Dartmoor <b>Pony.</b> <b>The</b> Dartmoor <b>Pony</b> Moorland Scheme (DPMS) was established in 1988 and is administered by <b>the</b> Dartmoor <b>Pony</b> Society and <b>the</b> Duchy of Cornwall, {{as well as being}} supported by the Dartmoor National Park. In 2004 a new scheme, <b>the</b> Dartmoor <b>Pony</b> Preservation Scheme (DPPS), was introduced, and herds taking part in this new scheme must enter one mare each year to the DPMS. [...] <b>The</b> Dartmoor <b>Pony</b> has been granted Rare Breed status.|$|R
5|$|A route {{popular with}} {{experienced}} hillwalkers starts at Torlundy, {{a few miles}} north-east of Fort William on the A82 road, and follows the path alongside the Allt a' Mhuilinn. It can also be reached from Glen Nevis by following <b>the</b> <b>Pony</b> Track as far as Lochan Meall an t-Suidhe, then descending slightly to the CIC Hut. The route then ascends Càrn Mòr Dearg and continues along the Càrn Mòr Dearg Arête ("CMD Arête") before climbing steeply to the summit of Ben Nevis. This route involves a total of 1,500 metres of ascent and requires modest scrambling ability and a head for heights. In common with other approaches {{on this side of}} the mountain, it has the advantage of giving an extensive view of the cliffs of the north face, which are hidden from <b>the</b> <b>Pony</b> Track.|$|E
5|$|During the {{following}} weeks, other isolated incidents occurred when whites in Paiute country were ambushed and killed. <b>The</b> <b>Pony</b> Express {{was a special}} target. Seven other express stations were also attacked; some 16 employees were killed and approximately 150 express horses were either stolen or driven off. The Paiute war cost <b>the</b> <b>Pony</b> Express company about $75,000 in livestock and station equipment, {{not to mention the}} loss of life. In June of that year, the Paiute uprising had been ended through the intervention of U.S. government troops, after which four delayed mail shipments from the East were finally brought to San Francisco on June 25, 1860.|$|E
5|$|Following {{her success}} with Smack <b>the</b> <b>Pony,</b> Channel 4 gave Pile a fairly free hand with her next project. Their only {{requirement}} {{was that it}} should have enough of a narrative thread to make it more of a sitcom than a sketch show.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Ride-Along <b>Ponies</b> {{are special}} {{versions}} of <b>the</b> Playful <b>Ponies,</b> {{each with a}} scooter and an animal companion. Three sets were released in July 2011 with Wave Four of <b>the</b> Playful <b>Ponies.</b>|$|R

5|$|The British cavalry {{became aware}} of <b>the</b> <b>ponies</b> in 1804, during the Peninsular War, and used them as pack animals during the conflict; most {{did not return to}} Ireland. The famine of 1845–1852 furthered their decline, as farmers who {{previously}} utilised them died or emigrated. In addition, Spanish donkeys were brought to the island to replace <b>the</b> <b>ponies,</b> and when peat declined as a fuel source, pack animals were no longer needed. In the 1850s, farms began to be consolidated, and more machinery and large draft horses were employed, further reducing <b>the</b> number of <b>ponies</b> needed. Consequently, <b>the</b> <b>ponies</b> were left to run feral, mostly ignored and sometimes shot at by locals.|$|R
