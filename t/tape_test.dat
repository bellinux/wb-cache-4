40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{adhesion}} of a sputtered copper film (thickness 5000 Angstroms) to flexible polyimide substrates between 1 mil and 5 mil thick. The polyimide types include Kapton (based on the monomers of pyromellitic dianhydride and oxydialine, i. e., PMDA-ODA) and Upilex (based on the bi-phenyl tetracarboxylic dianhydride monomer). (A. S. Wood, 1988) For each of these polyimides, a clear difference in adhesion is observed when the polymer surface has been treated with a simple AC nitrogen glow discharge. We used a <b>tape</b> <b>test</b> to estimate {{the strength of the}} adhesion bond. The difference in adhesion only becomes apparent after the film and substrate have been subjected to either boiling water or steam for 30 minutes or more; the difference becomes quite clear after two hours. After two hours, about 100 % of the copper film fails the adhesion <b>tape</b> <b>test</b> for an untreated polyimide surface; for a plasma modified surface, less than 1 % of the copper film fails the <b>tape</b> <b>test.</b> In this thesis, we present experimental data on the effects of moisture, cleaning procedures, and plasma surface modification in copper - polyimide adhesion.

40|$|Demodicosis is {{a common}} parasitary {{dermatopathy}} in dogs, resulting from excessive proliferation of Demodex canis mite, a natural inhabitant of dog´s skin. Definitive diagnosis is classically established through microscopic examination of deep skin scrapings obtained from affected areas, in which numerous adult mites and/or immature forms are observed. Although considered as the golden pattern for the disease diagnosis, this technique is difficult to be performed {{in some parts of}} the body, as face, eyelids and interdigital areas, besides causing pain in the dog and discomfort to the owner. Two less invasive diagnostic methods, the hair plucking and the adhesive <b>tape</b> <b>test</b> are described. Although these methods are well known, only few studies about their sensitivity were found in the literature. In the present study, tests were conducted on 40 dogs previously diagnosed with demodicosis through deep skin scrapings. At adhesive <b>tape</b> <b>test,</b> 30 of 40 samples were positive, evidencing 75 % of sensivity, while at hair plucking, mites were observed in 29 samples, leading to a sensivity of 73 %. These results do not differ statistically and suggest that adhesive <b>tape</b> <b>test</b> and hair plucking tests can be used on clinical routine as first choice primary tests for canine demodicosis as they offer more comfort to animal and its owner. Interestingly, the presence of pyoderma raised the sensibility of both tests to 100 %.

This research first reviewed the current literature on the topic of communicative competence from the perspectives of linguistics and sociolinguistics, discourse analysis, and speech communication. The 1 iterature on testing for communicative competence within the ESL and foreign language teaching fields was also reviewed. A 7 -minute oral semi-direct <b>taped</b> <b>test</b> was then developed and administered to a trial group of 5 ESL students and a final group of 25 ESL students at Portland State University. The test consisted of 5 short information questions and 10 social situations to which the subject was requested to respond.

A reliability study was conducted on the raters wherein the reliability of the raters was shown to be significantly high.

Since the residual adhesion of Au on SiO_ 2 is low, the improved adhesion can be easily seen using the Scotch <b>Tape</b> <b>Test.</b> The threshold in the enhanced adhesion corresponding to passing the <b>tape</b> <b>test</b> occurs at two different dose ranges for a given energy; one at very low dose centered around 1 × 10 ^(13) /cm^ 2, the other at higher doses with a threshold of around 1. 5 × 10 ^(14) /cm^ 2 (depending upon the beam energy). At low doses (2 × 10 ^(12) to 5 × 10 ^(13) /cm^ 2) surface cracks occur on the SiO_ 2 substrates, these cracks close up at doses higher than 5 × 10 ^(13) /cm^ 2.

40|$|While {{the stroke}} {{survivor}} with a motor deficit strives for recovery of {{all aspects of}} daily life movements, neurorehabilitation training is often task specific and does not generalize to movements other than the ones trained. In rodent models of post-stroke recovery, this problem is poorly investigated as the training task is often {{the same as the}} one that measures motor function. The present study investigated whether motor training by pellet reaching translates into enhancement of different motor functions in rats after stroke. Adult rats were subjected to 60 -min middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Five days after stroke, animals received either training consisting of 7  days of pellet reaching with the affected forelimb (n =  18) or no training (n =  18).

40|$|An {{excimer laser}} {{incident}} on a metallic thin film {{is used to}} measure the adhesion between the film and the substrate. The initial optical absorption leads to electron excitation. After collisions and degradation of the excited electrons, the absorbed energy is transferred into various kinds of energy among which the major one is thermal. The superheated surface undergoes vapor explosion which serves as one source of shock wave to break the thin film. The evaporated particles may recoil back to the surface constructing another shock wave to break the film. In addition, a tensile stress may be formed by the large difference of thermal expansion between metallic thin film and polymeric substrate. All these effects cooperate to cause the cracking of the metallic thin film. This thesis provides the theoretical models to explain how the various mechanisms work on adhesion evaluation. Based on these understandings, the experimental data of laser ablation test is more suggestive and meaningful than the <b>tape</b> <b>test</b> which is sometimes ambiguous due to undiscerned effects. The experimental results show that laser ablation is sensitive to small differences in adhesion. In addition, the laser ablation test has a broader range of measurement as compared to that of <b>tape</b> <b>test.</b> One thing to be noticed is that laser ablation test is strongly affected by the thickness of the film...|$|E
