40|$|Highway diverge {{areas are}} often {{characterized}} by high crash rates. All over the world, geometric design guidelines propose deceleration lanes with parallel or tapered layout {{in order to}} promote a free-vehicle condition, while neglecting the potential effects of traffic flow and risky driving behaviors that are induced by the wrong perception of road geometries and vehicle interferences. A driving simulation study is carried out to analyze the effects of traffic flow and deceleration lane geometries on the driving performance of diverging drivers. Two different types of deceleration lanes (parallel and tapered) are implemented in a simulator, and two different traffic conditions (low and high traffic flows) are simulated for each type. Thirty one drivers took part in the experiments. The effects of traffic flow on the driving performance whilst approaching the diverge area and during deceleration are investigated. The study found that lane type significantly affects the speeds of diverging drivers, independent of the traffic condition, with higher interferences with the through traffic on the <b>tapered</b> <b>lane.</b> Traffic condition was found to influence the driver’s trajectory along the <b>tapered</b> <b>lane,</b> and thus delaying the exiting maneuver under high traffic conditions. This effect was not found to be significant for parallel deceleration lanes on which, on the contrary, the deceleration rates were significantly affected by the traffic condition: higher decelerations were recorded under low traffic condition. No significant traffic effects on deceleration rates were found on the <b>tapered</b> <b>lane...</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} research {{looking at}} the design and operation of motorway diverges using the microscopic computer program SISTM. A diverge is {{the area of the}} motorway or other major road where drivers can leave the main carriageway. Low cost measures including the installation of alternative designs (such as the Ghost Island diverge) are assessed which could improve the operation, capacity and driving behaviour at the diverge. Following on from a recent study reviewing the diverging flow-region diagram (used in the UK as a tool to help traffic engineers select the most suitable diverge layout for a particular site with given downstream mainline and diverging flows), it was thought that microscopic models could offer potential benefits in confirming such a choice (particularly in border line situations) as driving behaviour aspects which affect capacity are not catered for in the diagram. SISTM has been used to evaluate existing and alternative diverge layouts in terms of their throughput as well as several other parameters. Modelled and observed data for the speed-flow relationship and the lane distribution of the mainline was compared and differences noted in order that the results could be interpreted correctly. A theoretical comparison of four layouts was carried out; <b>Taper,</b> Parallel, <b>Taper</b> <b>lane</b> drop and Ghost Island diverge. The link between throughput and lane distribution on the mainline before the diverge was also assessed as well as the importance of lane and exit choice. This research presents a summary of some of the key results from the modelling along with a discussion of their accuracy and application. Conclusions and recommendations are made with regard to design implications for diverges along with a list of modelling requirements (essential and desirable) for motorway diverges...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the driving performance of drivers exiting from the highway under various geometric deceleration lane conditions. Specifically, the effects of different deceleration lanes on the speeds, trajectories, and decelerations of diverging drivers were investigated to increase the knowledge of driver behavior while approaching a highway exit, during the lane-change maneuver, and along the deceleration lane.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this report is a {{capacity}} analysis of two long-term urban freeway Work Zones. Work Zone # 1 <b>tapered</b> four mainline <b>lanes</b> to two, using two separate tapers; Work Zone # 2 <b>tapered</b> two mainline <b>lanes</b> to one. Work Zone throughput was analyzed throughout the day over multiple days and traffic operations conditions were analyzed up to a distance of five miles upstream of the Work Zone entrance. Historical data from pavement-embedded detectors were used to analyze traffic conditions. The database consisted of five-minute volume, speed and occupancy data collected from 78 detectors {{for a total of}} 50 days. Congestion during each analyzed Work Zone existed for more than fourteen hours each day; Work Zone impacts adversely affected freeway operations over distances of 3. 7 to 4. 2 miles. Speed and occupancy conditions further upstream were, however, not affected, or even improved due to significant trip diversion. Work Zone capacity was defined based on the maximum traffic flows observed over a one-hour period; throughput values were also compiled over longer periods of time when traffic was within 90 % of the maximum observed one-hour flows, as well as over the multi-hour mid-day period. The Highway Capacity Manual freeway capacity definition based on the maximum observed 15 -min period was not used, since it would have no practical application in estimating Work Zone throughput when congested conditions prevail {{for the majority of the}} hours of the day. Certain noteworthy changes took place for the duration of the analyzed Work Zones: per-lane throughput dropped; morning peak periods started earlier, evening peak periods ended later and lasted longer; mid-day volumes dropped accompanied by the highest occupancies of the day. Trip diversion was evident in lower volumes entering the analyzed freeway corridor, higher volumes using off-ramps and lower volumes using onramps upstream of the Work Zones. The majority of diverted traffic comprised smaller vehicles (vehicles up to 21 feet in length); combination truck volumes increased and their use of the median lane increased, contrary to smaller vehicles that shifted toward a heavier use of the shoulder lane...|$|R
40|$|Deceleration lanes are {{designed}} to improve traffic operation, reduce vehicular interferences, improve safety, and provide an effective transition from high-speed lanes to low-speed ramps. Nevertheless, several studies have shown high crash rates on these road geometries. Moreover, there are no guidelines that could provide designers with clear and updated criteria for appropriately designing deceleration lanes, whilst {{taking into account the}} driver’s behavior and the effects of different design variables on driving performance. The main objective {{of this study is to}} investigate the driving performance of drivers exiting from the highway under various geometric deceleration lanes conditions. Specifically, the effects of different deceleration lanes on the speeds, trajectories, and decelerations of diverging drivers were investigated, in order to increase the knowledge of driver behavior whilst approaching a highway exit, during the lane-change maneuver, and along the deceleration lane.

The effects of the number of the exit lanes on the driving performances were then statistically analysed. The main results demonstrated that, for the geometric and operating conditions investigated in this study, a single-lane exit ramp resulted in a poorer performance from the exiting drivers with regard to the operating and safe driving conditions.

40|$|Severe traffic {{turbulence}} on entry {{sections of}} freeway work zones increases the delays {{and risk of}} crash. A new Indiana Department of Transportation system called Indiana Merge Lane System (IMLS) creates a dynamic no passing zone on the approach to the freeway work zone through the sequence of DO NOT PASS signs. The system is thought to encourage drivers to switch lanes well upstream of the discontinuous <b>lane</b> <b>taper</b> where the merging maneuver is safer and less intrusive. The IMLS is expected to impact drivers’ behavior, {{their perception of the}} traffic conditions, and traffic safety. This research is focused on: (1) drivers’ compliance with the system, (2) delays and travel times on approaches to work zones, (3) optimal configuration of the system, and (4) warrants for the system’s use. The simulation and field studies indicate a significant {{reduction in the number of}} merging maneuvers near work zones after the IMLS is applied. Also, the travel time on continuous lanes is reduced. The increased fairness of the system improves the perception of the traffic conditions among the majority of drivers. A slight reduction in the capacity of the merge point is the second finding of the field observations. This finding should be confirmed through long-term measurements of capacity during regular use of the IMLS units. The final report is divided into two parts. Part I presents the performed research, including the simulation model development and simulation experiments. Part II contains the system description, guidelines for its use, and rules for its setting. The system description includes presentation of the concept and the system components. The guidelines for the system use provide the traffic conditions where the system is expected to provide benefit.

40|$|The {{entry to}} a work zone is {{critical}} for traffic smoothness and safety because of the discontinuation {{of one or more}} lanes. The Indiana Lane Merge System (ILMS) was designed to implement dynamic lane change control at work zone entries by encouraging drivers to switch lanes well upstream of the discontinuous <b>lane</b> <b>taper,</b> thereby reducing the number of aggressive lane changes at the taper. At the time of this research, the ILMS had not been implemented on a large scale at rural freeway work zones. The Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) wanted to do a complete safety and capacity evaluation of the system before implementing it statewide. The safety of a system is usually evaluated by close examination prior to and following the installation of the system, i. e., before and after studies. Since crashes are rare and random occurrences, it would take a long time (usually 5 - 10 years) before the safety study can be completed. Another safety indicator that is used by a number of safety researchers is traffic conflicts. Unfortunately, safety benefits expressed in traffic conflicts (unlike crashes) cannot be converted to a monetary value. In this study, a new method combining crashes and conflicts is proposed. The relative change in the number of conflicts with and without the system is first established, which is then assumed to be equivalent to the relative change in the number of crashes. This value is then multiplied by the expected number of crashes without the system to obtain the expected crash reduction using the new system. Crash prediction models without ILMS and conflict models with and without ILMS were developed. In addition, a capacity evaluation was conducted to estimate the capacity impacts of ILMS. All the models were integrated and a detailed sensitivity analysis was performed by using a spreadsheet-based application that was developed using Visual Basic. The software program also serves as a tool for INDOT personnel to estimate the expected safety and monetary benefits for a given work zone. Sensitivity analysis results are summarized in the ILMS guidelines, which are based on daily vehicle profiles, directional distributions, and heavy vehicle profiles from rural freeways in Indiana. The estimated total benefits showe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract EVALUATING THE USE OF STEADY BURN WARNING LIGHTS ON DRUMS FOR WORK ZONE SAFETY by PRASAD LAKSHMI VARA NANNAPANENI May 2011 Advisor: Dr. Timothy Gates Major: Civil Engineering Degree: Doctor of Philosophy Roadway {{maintenance}} and repair has become increasingly commonplace in the United States {{over the past several}} decades as our roadway infrastructure has continued to age and deteriorate. Maintenance and repair work on an existing roadway often presents the challenge of maintaining traffic on the existing roadway while work is being performed, thereby necessitating the use of what is commonly referred to as a roadway 2 ̆ 2 work zone 2 ̆ 2. One of the most important components of traffic control in a work zone is delineation of the edge of the traveled way, which assists drivers with tasks such as: lane selection; lateral positioning within a lane; and speed control. Delineation of the edge of the traveled way is commonly provided by a series of portable devices, such as drums, cones, vertical panels, or barricades. The type and duration of the work being performed often requires that these channelizing devices remain in place at all times. Maintaining traffic through nighttime work zones poses increased risks for drivers and roadway workers due to the lack of ambient light. To help overcome nighttime visibility issues, the 2009 Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) requires work zone traffic control devices to be retroreflective or internally illuminated. To help supplement retroreflectivity, Section 6 F. 81 of the 2009 MUTCD allows for the use of auxiliary steady burn warning lights (SBWL) on work zone channelizing devices. Until recently, plastic drums with steady burn warning lights had been the primary channelizing device utilized in work zones throughout the State of Michigan for several years. However, the use of sheeting materials with improved retroreflectivity, including high intensity and microprismatic (i. e., prismatic) materials, has prompted investigation into the value and effectiveness provided by the steady burn warning lights. Furthermore, although previous research has explored the effectiveness of steady burn warning lights on drums both in Michigan and elsewhere, these efforts included a relatively limited number of work zone sites and/or focused on controlled human factors experiments. As a result, research was undertaken to explore the impacts associated with the use of steady burn warning lights on channelizing drums considering a variety of work zone scenarios utilized in Michigan. The primary goal of this research was to evaluate the safety impacts associated with the use of steady burn warning lights on drums in roadway work zones in Michigan. The following research objectives were addressed in this study: 1. 	Determine the state-of-the-art of work zone channelization through a comprehensive literature review. 2. 	Determine the state-of-the-practice regarding the use of steady burn warning lights by roadway agencies throughout the United States. 3. 	Assess the crash experiences of states with respect to the work zone steady burn warning light policy or practice. 4. 	Evaluate the impacts that steady burn warning lights on channelizing drums have on work zone crash occurrence in Michigan. 5. 	Evaluate the driver behavioral impacts associated with the use of steady burn warning lights on channelizing drums in Michigan work zones. 6. 	Determine the degree by which steady burn warning lights affect the overall brightness of work zone drums in Michigan. 7. 	Assess the overall impacts of steady burn warning lights on work zone safety. A comprehensive research methodology was developed to address these objectives. The initial tasks involved a comprehensive review of the current state-of-the-art and a state DOT survey related to the use of drums or other channelizing devices in roadway work zones, both with and without the presence of steady burn warning lights. The next tasks involved a comparison of work zone crash trends, both among states with varying policies on the use of steady burn warning lights, as well as a detailed investigation of crash data for work zones within the State of Michigan. To further supplement the crash data, a series of field studies were performed at 36 Michigan work zones to provide a more in-depth evaluation of differences in driver behavior and performance with respect to the use of steady burn warning lights. In addition to these field studies, a series of luminance tests were also conducted to assess the relative brightness levels provided by drums with and without warning lights. The luminance tests were performed both in the field and in a controlled environment to gauge the impacts of steady burn warning lights on drum visibility. Established sampling procedures were utilized to determine the target sample sizes necessary to assess statistical inference on the measures of effectiveness (MOEs). The data were collected for each study component under a variety of representative field conditions, which included different types of roadways, work zone configuration, levels of ambient lighting, roadway geometry, and other factors. Each of the MOEs were analyzed using appropriate statistical techniques to determine the impacts of steady burn warning lights and the impacts of other factors. The results showed that the presence of steady burn warning lights on work zone channelizing drums increased the occurrence of risky driver behavior, as evidenced by a higher proportion of drivers traveling too close to the drums, more frequent steering reversals, and higher vehicular speeds. These findings were further substantiated by the observance of a greater proportion of damaged drums at work zone locations with steady burn warning lights. Steady burn warning lights were not found to provide substantial increases to the luminance of the drums either in the field or in a controlled environment. It was determined that the use of microprismatic sheeting materials provide considerably greater luminance increases for the drums compared to the addition of a steady burn warning light to the drum. The state DOT survey revealed that only approximately one-third of the 42 responding state agencies utilize steady burn warning lights on channelizing devices in work zones and only one-tenth of the responding agencies utilize them on a frequent basis. The majority of agencies that use steady burn warning lights do so on an infrequent basis, typically for specific types of applications, such as at spot hazards, <b>tapers,</b> <b>lane</b> shifts, and crossovers. The investigation of nationwide work zone crash statistics revealed only slight differences between the rates of work zone crashes for the various steady burn warning light usage practices. The states that frequently use lights on drums exhibited a slightly higher aggregate work zone crash rate, while the states that infrequently use lights on drums had the lowest aggregate crash rate. No discernable differences were observed between any of the three groups of states when examining work zone crashes as a proportion of total crashes. A detailed review of Michigan work zone crash statistics revealed that a higher proportion of work zone crashes tended to occur during nighttime conditions at locations with steady burn warning lights compared to locations without steady burn warning lights. Deeper investigation showed that among those crashes occurring in the presence of drums, the proportion of the crashes that may have been affected by the drums was indistinguishable between the two samples. Based on a synthesis of all results, steady burn warning lights demonstrate no substantive value to nighttime brightness, driver behavior, or crash prevention when used on channelizing drums in work zones. Thus, it was concluded that steady burn warning lights demonstrate no additional safety benefit when used on channelizing drums in work zones. Furthermore, steady burn warning lights may actually contribute to a greater crash risk due to the increase in risky driver behavior that was observed when steady burn warning lights were present. Drums with high intensity sheeting that is in good condition will provide adequate nighttime brightness for work zone channelization regardless of whether a steady burn warning light is attached or not. Therefore, it is recommended that the use of steady burn warning lights on work zone drums be discontinued. If additional nighttime brightness of the channelizing devices is desired, the use of microprismatic sheeting on the drums provides far greater increases in brightness than the addition of a steady burn warning light...|$|R
