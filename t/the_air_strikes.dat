5|$|During {{the period}} in which <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>strikes</b> were conducted, a force of 25 Wildcat and Supermarine Seafire fighters from 801, 842 and 880 Naval Air Squadrons {{provided}} air defence for the Home Fleet. Nine Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers, which were also operated by 842 Naval Air Squadron, conducted anti-submarine patrols. No threat to the fleet developed, and Corsairs took over air defence duties {{at the conclusion of the}} two attacks.|$|E
5|$|The {{operations}} of Deny Flight spanned {{more than two}} years of the Bosnian War and {{played an important role in}} the course of that conflict. The no-fly zone {{operations of}} Deny Flight proved successful in preventing significant use of air power by any side in the conflict. Additionally, <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>strikes</b> flown during Deny Flight led to Operation Deliberate Force, a massive NATO bombing campaign in Bosnia that played a key role in ending the war.|$|E
5|$|In January 1973, {{hope was}} renewed when the Paris Peace Accord was signed, ending the {{conflict}} (for the time being) in South Vietnam and Laos. On 29 January, Lon Nol proclaimed a unilateral cease-fire throughout the nation. All U.S. bombing operations were halted {{in hopes of}} securing a chance for peace. It was not to be. The Khmer Rouge simply ignored the proclamation and carried on fighting. By March, heavy casualties, desertions, and low recruitment had forced Lon Nol to introduce conscription and, in April, insurgent forces launched an offensive that pushed into the suburbs of the capital. The U.S. Air Force responded by launching an intense bombing operation that forced the communists back into the countryside after being decimated by <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>strikes.</b> The US Seventh Air Force argued that the bombing prevented the fall of Phnom Penh in 1973 by killing 16,000 of 25,500 Khmer Rouge fighters besieging the city.|$|E

50|$|At 14:00, an <b>air</b> <b>strike</b> came in, with planes bombarded {{the hill}} with napalm, {{conventional}} bombs, rockets, and machine guns. The strike and artillery preparation, {{were successful in}} pushing North Korean forces off the hill. After the strike, the infantry attacked up the hill at 15:30 unopposed and secured it by 16:30. The combined strength of E and F Companies {{on top of the}} hill was about sixty men. The artillery preparations and <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>strike</b> killed and wounded an estimated 500 enemy troops on Hill 303, with survivors had fleeing in complete rout after <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>strike.</b>|$|R
5|$|The HNC, {{which had}} representatives {{from a wide}} range of social groups, {{selected}} the aging civilian politician Phan Khắc Sửu as chief of state, and Suu chose Trần Văn Hương as prime minister, a position that had greater power. However, Khánh and the senior generals retained the real power. At the same time, a group of Catholic officers were trying to replace Khánh with their co-religionist, General Nguyễn Văn Thiệu, and the incumbent was under pressure. During 1964, South Vietnam had suffered a succession of setbacks on the battlefield, in part due to disunity in the military and a focus on coup plotting. In the meantime, both Saigon and Washington were planning a large-scale bombing campaign against North Vietnam in an attempt to deter communist aggression, but were waiting for stability in the south before starting <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>strikes.</b>|$|E
5|$|In March 1995, while NATO was {{planning}} {{a new strategy}} in support of peacekeeping operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina, a ceasefire brokered by former US President Jimmy Carter between the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Armija Republike Bosne i Hercegovine; ARBiH) and the Army of Republika Srpska (Vojska Republike Srpske; VRS) expired and fighting resumed. As the struggle gradually widened, the ARBiH launched a large-scale offensive around Sarajevo. In response, the VRS seized heavy weapons from a UN-guarded depot and began shelling targets around the city, prompting the UN commander in Bosnia, Lieutenant General Rupert Smith, to request NATO air strikes against the VRS. NATO responded on 25 and 26 May 1995 by bombing a VRS ammunition dump in the Bosnian Serb capital, Pale. The mission {{was carried out by}} United States Air Force F-16s and Spanish Air Force EF-18A Hornets armed with laser-guided bombs. In response, the VRS seized 377 UNPROFOR hostages and used them as human shields for a variety of potential targets in Bosnia and Herzegovina, forcing NATO to end <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>strikes.</b>|$|E
5|$|In early November, the JNA and the SAO Krajina TO {{intensified}} their offensive {{aimed at}} capturing Saborsko and the Slunj pocket. The main axes of the advance radiated north and northwest from the Plitvice Lakes—towards Slunj and Saborsko respectively. The JNA force {{assigned to the}} offensive was organised as the Tactical Group 2 (TG-2), {{under the command of}} Colonel Čedomir Bulat. The TG-2, whose bulk consisted of a reinforced motorised battalion detached from the 236th Motorised Brigade and a D-30 howitzer battalion, was supported by the 5th Partisan Brigade, both subordinated to the 13th JNA Corps as well as a police unit and a SAO Krajina TO brigade drawn from Plaški. The attacking force, supported by the Yugoslav Air Force, artillery and tanks, approached the village from three directions on the morning of 12 November, while the main force advancing towards Slunj reached Rakovica. According to SAO Krajina sources, <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>strikes</b> commenced at 9a.m. and lasted for fifteen minutes. They were followed by a 30-minute artillery bombardment before ground forces were ordered to attack.|$|E

In a possible future, told in flashback by Rodimus Prime, Scorponok lost a leadership contest with Megatron and Shockwave. Fleeing, Megatron sent <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Strike</b> Patrol to pursue him, but they wound up in battle with Hot Rod, who Scorponok had surrendered to, forcing the Autobot and his comrades to protect him.

25|$|On Friday, Major Tom Holloway, {{spokesman}} for the British Armed Forces, reported two air strikes were made in support of Iraqi forces in Basra overnight. <b>The</b> <b>air</b> <b>strikes,</b> which occurred at 21:00 on Thursday and shortly after midnight involved US Navy or Marine F/A-18 fighters firing cannon rounds at a militia stronghold and on a mortar team in Basra.

25|$|The {{fighting}} quickly escalated to {{exchanges of}} artillery and tank fire, leading {{to four weeks}} of intense fighting. Ground troops fought on three fronts. On 5 June 1998, the Ethiopians launched air attacks on the airport in Asmara and the Eritreans retaliated by attacking the airport of Mekele. These raids caused civilian casualties and deaths {{on both sides of}} the border. The United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 1177 condemning the use of force and welcomed statements from both sides to end <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>strikes.</b>|$|E
25|$|Following <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>strikes</b> on airfields on 15 April 1961, the FAR {{managed to}} prepare for armed action at least four T-33s, four Sea Furies and five or six B-26s. All three types were armed with machine guns (20mm cannon, {{in the case of}} the Sea Furies) for air-to-air combat and for {{strafing}} of ships and ground targets. CIA planners had failed to discover that the US-supplied T-33 jets had long been armed with M-3 machine guns. The three types could also carry bombs, for attacks against ships and tanks.|$|E

25|$|Snook left Pearl Harbor for {{her third}} war patrol on 18 August and arrived off Marcus Island on 30 August to take {{reconnaissance}} photographs and stand lifeguard duty for the carrier air strikes of 1 September. Following <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>strikes,</b> the submarine resumed patrol {{and headed for}} the East China Sea where, in the early morning darkness of 13 September, she torpedoed and sank the 9,650-ton transport Yamato Maru. On 22 September, Snook intercepted and sank 715-ton Japanese cargo ship Katsurahama Maru departing from Dairen. The submarine terminated her third patrol at Pearl Harbor on 8 October.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, two Air Force Tactical Air Control Parties {{arrived in}} theater within the war's first week. Over 60% of <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>strikes</b> flown {{in the first}} month of the war—some 3,251 sorties—beefed up the scanty {{artillery}} support of American and South Korean ground forces. American communication nets in Korea were so overloaded that close air support operations were hindered. At times, senior officers even desperately resorted to personal telephone calls to Japan to request air strikes. Without guidance, many tactical sorties became a hunt for targets of opportunity. Even B-29 Superfortresses were pressed into close air support, though with little effect.|$|E
25|$|In late August and September 1999, Russia {{mounted a}} massive air {{campaign}} over Chechnya, with the stated aim of wiping out militants who invaded Dagestan the previous month. On 26 August 1999, Russia acknowledged bombing raids in Chechnya. The Russian air strikes {{were reported to}} have forced at least 100,000 Chechens to flee their homes to safety; the neighbouring region of Ingushetia was reported to have appealed for United Nations aid to deal {{with tens of thousands of}} refugees. On 2 October 1999, Russia's Ministry of Emergency Situations admitted that 78,000 people have fled <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>strikes</b> in Chechnya; most of them were heading for Ingushetia, where they were arriving at a rate of 5,000 to 6,000 a day.|$|E

25|$|The Luftwaffe's Chief of the General Staff, Hans Jeschonnek, {{wanted to}} begin the air attacks before the German {{artillery}} started firing. However, Hitler and the OKW decided it may give the opportunity for the Soviets to disperse their air units, and his idea was rejected. Hitler gave the order for <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>strikes</b> on airfields {{to be carried out}} at dawn. Although many new German bomber crews had only limited training in instrument-flying, the Luftflotten overcame the problem by hand picking experienced crews, who would cross the border at high altitude, to swoop on their targets. The Germans deliberately targeted Soviet fighter air bases first, to knock out potential opposition to its bombers and dive bombers.|$|E
25|$|The only {{power plant}} in Gaza is not {{operational}} {{due to the lack}} of industrial fuel and spare parts. As of 1 January, power outages last 16 hours per day. Due to localised damage following the airstrikes, some electrical lines have been cut, causing some areas to suffer from power cuts lasting 24 hours. In addition, due to the damage caused by <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>strikes</b> to 15 electrical transformers, as many as 250,000 people in central and northern Gaza have no electricity supply during the entire day and night. On 1 January, a 5MW line from Egypt to Rafah was damaged, extending the power cuts to Rafah, which usually has a continuous supply. Fuel for heating and cooking are no longer available and most of the 240 gas stations in Gaza City have been closed.|$|E
25|$|The first {{success in}} this Anglo-Italian {{cooperation}} came in December 1910. In that month, the British Warsangali and the Italian Mijertain peacefully resolved all their outstanding disputes and, convening in Bander Kasim, agreed to act jointly in combating Sayyid Mohammed Abdullah Hassan and his Dervishes. The Mijertain–Warsangali Accord led to a common offensive against the Mullah, whose forces were cut off from arms and munitions smuggled in from the coast. (Hess, 427) In 1920, the Dervishes unexpectedly captured Badhan and besieged Las Khorey. The British Governor at Aden soon sent RAF biplanes to contain the advance of the Dervish army into the Warsangali country. Though <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>strikes</b> that bombarded Badhan, Jidali and Talex never did considerable harm to the Dervishes, the Dervishes were still powerful but disorganized and dispersed into unknown areas. Finally, the forces of Warsangali and Dervishes met at Jidali and this {{was in fact the}} final decimation of the Dervish movement.|$|E
