5|$|Nikki is {{manipulative}} of Paulo {{and appears}} to care more about <b>the</b> <b>diamonds</b> than her relationship. After the crash, Paulo becomes suspicious Nikki is just using him to get <b>the</b> <b>diamonds.</b> The first thing she asks him after the crash is the whereabouts of <b>the</b> <b>diamonds,</b> and avoids answering Paulo when he asks if they would still be together {{if she did not}} need him to help find <b>the</b> <b>diamonds.</b> Paulo does what Nikki tells him to because of his fear of losing her, which results in their deaths.|$|E

5|$|A fourth-wicket {{partnership}} of 83 runs between Amy Jones and Ellyse Perry rescued Loughborough from 31 for three against the Western Storm, and they posted 158 for eight. Storm's captain, Heather Knight, scored 74 {{runs in the}} chase, but received little batting support from her teammates. After Knight was run out, the Storm faltered to eventually lose the game by five runs. Western Storm were in action again two days later, when they hosted the Stars in Bristol. The Stars batted first and scored 161 for six, propelled by an innings of 90 not out from Nat Sciver. In their chase, Stafanie Taylor scored 74 not out, and Lizelle Lee got 53 to help the Storm to victory. In Southampton the next day, the Southern Vipers beat <b>the</b> <b>Diamonds</b> by 54 runs; Suzie Bates and Arran Brindle each scored 45 runs for the hosts, and Linsey Smith then took four wickets to help bowl <b>the</b> <b>Diamonds</b> out for 64. Only Beth Mooney reached double figures for <b>the</b> <b>Diamonds.</b> A strong bowling performance from Alex Hartley and Marizanne Kapp helped Surrey to limit Lancashire to 102 for nine in the next match, with the pair both bowling economically and taking five wickets between them. The Stars chased down the target with more than four overs remaining; Tammy Beaumont scored 45, and Bryony Smith made 30.|$|E

25|$|After {{thoroughly}} cleaning <b>the</b> <b>diamond,</b> <b>the</b> <b>diamond</b> {{is picked}} up using tweezers in a girdle-to-girdle hold. The grader views <b>the</b> <b>diamond</b> for <b>the</b> first time through the table, studying the culet area of the stone for inclusions. <b>The</b> <b>diamond</b> is then set {{down and picked up}} with the tweezers in a table-to-culet hold. In this position, <b>the</b> <b>diamond</b> can be studied from the pavilion side, and the crown side, examining <b>the</b> <b>diamond</b> through each facet for inclusions. Once a sector of <b>the</b> <b>diamond</b> has been thoroughly examined, the grader rotates <b>the</b> <b>diamond</b> in <b>the</b> tweezer, so that the neighboring sector can be examined. The grader uses darkfield lighting to reveal characteristics, and alternates to reflected, overhead lighting to ascertain whether a characteristic lies within the stone, on the stones surface, or both. If the grader is using a stereo microscope, she may zoom in to a higher magnification to make closer observations of an inclusion, but then return to 10x magnification to make an assessment of its impact on the clarity grade.|$|R

5|$|Tiffany reneges on her deal to meet {{back with}} Bond and instead flees, passing off <b>the</b> <b>diamonds</b> {{to the next}} smuggler. However, seeing that O'Toole was killed after being mistaken for her, Tiffany changes her mind. She drives Bond to the airport, where <b>the</b> <b>diamonds</b> are given to Whyte's casino manager, Bert Saxby, who is {{followed}} to a remote facility. Bond enters the apparent destination of the diamonds: a research laboratory owned by Whyte, where a satellite is being built by Professor Metz, a laser refraction specialist. Bond fakes Metz by telling him he is Klaus Hergersheimer, a technician he met in the facility. His cover is blown when the real Hergersheimer shows up. Bond attempts to remain hidden, but is seen by a technician. He manages to evade the security guards by stealing a moon buggy and reunites with Tiffany. The laboratory report Bond's activity to the sheriff's office. Bond and Tiffany make {{their way back to}} Las Vegas; they are seen there by the Las Vegas police, who engage in a car chase, but Bond manages to evade all the cars.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> Nassak <b>Diamond</b> quickly resurfaced in the {{possession}} of Baji Rao II the last independent Indian Peshwa Prince, who handed over <b>the</b> <b>diamond</b> to an English colonel named J.

5|$|Diamonds {{prepared}} as gemstones are sold on diamond exchanges called bourses. There are 28 registered diamond bourses in the world. Bourses are the final tightly controlled {{step in the}} diamond supply chain; wholesalers and even retailers are able to buy relatively small lots of diamonds at the bourses, after which they are prepared for final sale to the consumer. Diamonds can be sold already set in jewelry, or sold unset ("loose"). According to the Rio Tinto Group, in 2002 <b>the</b> <b>diamonds</b> produced and released to the market were valued at US$9billion as rough diamonds, US$14billion after being cut and polished, US$28billion in wholesale diamond jewelry, and US$57billion in retail sales.|$|E
