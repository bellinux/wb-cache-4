40|$|The paper studies optimal {{taxation}} in a two-period, two-asset {{model in}} which the assets have random returns. The taxes are state-contingent, proportional taxes on the asset-returns. Government revenue requirements in each state of nature are given. Consumers are identical. Two results are found. It is shown that the optimum has a degree of freedom, {{so that there is}} a set of equivalent optimal tax systems. Conditions are also established for the optimum to have no portfolio distortion in the sense that there is no <b>tax</b> <b>inducement</b> to switch from one asset to the other.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis study provides a general {{analysis of the}} United States (U. S.) Navy's lease versus buy decision model in the satellite communications systems. It also examines the Leased Satellite (LEASAT) and the Ultra High Frequency (UHF) Follow-on satellites. It gives general background information on lease versus buy decisions in {{both the public and}} private sectors. It evaluates the inputs affecting the lease/purchase decision, particularly the <b>tax</b> <b>inducement</b> and tax regulations affecting lease/buy decisions in the U. S. satellite communications sector. However, the analysis shows that cost considerations do not always receive top priority. Technical sophistication and risk, managerial considerations, and cash flow implications are among the other factors considered in lease/buy analyses. [URL] Turkish Nav...|$|E

40|$|We {{analyze the}} gains of {{coordinating}} decisions in a regulatory {{framework in which}} agents are sovereign and <b>tax</b> <b>inducements</b> are socially costly. We consider a general multi-agent situation with externalities among agents, incomplete information, and type-dependent reservation utilities. When the regulator (optimally) leaves informational rents to the most efficient agents, centralized coordination reduces global activity. Coordination induces more activity when the principal (optimally) leaves rents to the most inefficient agents. Last, if we impose budget balance, our mechanism can also be interpreted as the optimal auction of a public good with congestion externalities.

50|$|In 1991, {{under the}} {{leadership}} of then Governor Carroll A. Campbell, the state successfully recruited BMW's (Bavarian Motor Works) only U.S. auto factory to the city of Greer, in Spartanburg County. Second-tier and third-tier auto parts suppliers to BMW likewise established assembly and distribution facilities near the factory, creating a significant shift in manufacturing from textiles to automotive. In 2009, the state outbid the state of Washington for a giant new Boeing plant, to be constructed in North Charleston. Boeing must create at least 3,800 jobs and invest more than $750 million within seven years {{to take advantage of the}} various <b>tax</b> <b>inducements,</b> worth $450 million.|$|R
50|$|Intelligent urbanism {{proposes that}} {{enterprise}} can only flourish where a public framework provides opportunities for enterprise. This system of opportunities operates through public investments in {{economic and social}} infrastructure; through incentives {{in the form of}} appropriate finance, <b>tax</b> <b>inducements,</b> subsidized skill development for workers, and: regulations which protect the environment, safety, hygiene and health. To ensure a stable playing field where one can make an investment with predictable returns, a modicum of regulation is necessary. Proponents argue that it is through government regulations that private investment can be protected from fraud. It is through government regulation that the under-pinning conditions for free enterprise can be protected.|$|R
40|$|Part I of {{this article}} {{concluded}} that tax incentives for foreign direct investment (FDI) have become increasingly common over the past 10 years or so, especially among developing countries, {{and that there is}} substantial evidence to support the proposition that tax considerations now {{play an important role in}} many investment decisions. Countries seeking to attract FDI often feel compelled to offer <b>tax</b> <b>inducements</b> that are at least as attractive as those offered by their neighbours or competitors. Countries do so at a cost, however, and that cost may be substantial. Governments are thus placed in a dilemma - can they afford to cut taxes in order to attract investment, and can they afford not to? The second part {{of this article}} assumes that countries, and especially most developing countries, will continue to feel obliged to provide tax incentives. The aim of this part therefore is to examine ways in which those incentives can be made more effective and more efficient, thereby reducing their cost to the host country. <br /...|$|R
40|$|During the 1960 s and 1970 s, the U. S. {{government}} closely regulated the single-family {{housing finance}} system. The regulation {{manifested itself in}} a highly specialized system with four notable characteristics: portfolio restrictions against investments in corporate assets, <b>tax</b> <b>inducements</b> to invest in residential mortgages, prohibitions against investing in ARMS, and deposit rates ceilings. All were removed in the 1980 s, and, not surprisingly, the housing finance system changed markedly. Between early 1982 and 1989, two-fifths of all new loans had adjustable, not fixed, rates, and savings and loans reduced their holdings of FRMs (both whole loans and mortgage pass-throughs) by 15 to 20 percent. Moreover, the fraction of conventional FRM originations that have been pooled into pass-throughs rose from less than one-twentieth before 1981 to over one-half after 1985. With the opportunity of borrowers to shift to lower coupon ARMs when rates rise and with {{the integration of the}} home mortgage market with capital markets generally, one would expect that the U. S. housing sector is now less sensitive to rising interest rates {{than it was in the}} 1960 s and 1970 s. Numerous studies support this expectation. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{residential}} energy credit {{provided by}} the federal Energy Tax Act (1977) cannot be carried beyond December 31, 1987, and the Reagan administration has indicated a disinclination to support an extension of its provisions, in either its current or an altered form. Its likely demise indicates nothing about the Act's effectiveness in getting homeowners to invest in energy conservation or solar devices. Rather, it {{is a reflection of}} the Reagan philosophy of letting market conditions determine energy conservation decisions. Since the administration is not explicitly passing judgment on the success or failure of residential tax credits, important questions regarding their efficacy remain to be answered. This paper will attempt to shed light on this question. It will examine data derived from a random sample of Western United States homeowners to determine awareness and use of the federal energy tax credit; the role of climate and dwelling type; and the influence of selected socioeconomic factors on the use of energy tax credits. Most important, it will seek to determine the extent to which conservation decisions were contingent on the availability of the tax credits, i, e., what proportion of investments were made wholly or predominantly because of their special <b>tax</b> <b>inducements</b> and what proportion would have been made in any case. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{build an}} {{equilibrium}} model of prostitution where clients and sex workers choose to demand and supply sex under three legal regimes: prohibition, regulation and laissez-faire. The key {{feature is the}} endogenous evolution of the risk {{as a consequence of}} policy changes. We calibrate the model to empirical evidence from Italy and then compare the effect of different policies on the equilibrium quantity of prostitution and on the harm associated with it. A prohibition regime that makes it illegal to buy sex but not to sell it is more effective than the opposite regime in reducing quantity but less effective in reducing harm. <b>Taxes</b> are one <b>inducement</b> to go illegal and prevent some of the less risky individuals from joining the market, leaving it smaller but riskier. A licensing system that prevents some infected individuals from joining the legal market reduces the risk and is therefore associated with a sharp increase in quantity. While prohibition is preferable to minimize quantity, regulation is best to minimize harm. Prostitution, Regulation, Prohibition, Lasseiz-faire. ...|$|R
