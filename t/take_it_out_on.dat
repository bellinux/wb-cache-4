500|$|Pittsburgh {{scored the}} only {{points of the}} third quarter when Jeff Reed {{converted}} his sole field goal attempt of the game. The Steelers added two touchdowns in the final quarter—on a Gary Russell rush and Tyrone Carter's return of his second interception of the game.

500|$|When Paul is {{tormented by}} a group of {{homophobic}} men, Ivan steps in to rescue him. Brocklebank told Kris Green of Digital Spy that Ivan tells the men that if they have a problem they should <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> him, not his boyfriend. This is the first time Ivan [...] "actually vocalises it" [...] and he is shocked because [...] "he has ever considered anyone to be his boyfriend before". Paul then invites Ivan out for dinner with his father, but Ivan is not ready to come out. The actor said that Ivan needs more time until he feels comfortable with the situation. Ivan's ex-wife Jordan (Erin Shanagher) caught him with another man, outed him and which resulted in a [...] "horrendous" [...] reaction from those he knew. Brocklebank said that this causes his reluctance to come out again because [...] "he's become scared about opening himself up to a new community of people and is worried about the villagers' reaction." ...|$|E
500|$|Besides Big Sugar, Douglas {{spoke about}} the damage the Army Corps of Engineers was doing to the Everglades by {{diverting}} the natural flow of water. The Corps was responsible for constructing more than [...] of canals to divert water away from the Everglades after 1947. When the Central & South Florida Project (C), run by {{former members of the}} Corps of Engineers, was proposed to assist the Everglades, Douglas initially gave it her approval, as it promised to deliver much-needed water to the shrinking Everglades. However, in application, the project instead diverted more water away from the Everglades, changed water schedules to meet sugarcane farmers' irrigation needs, and flat-out refused to release water to Everglades National Park, until much of the land was unrecognizable. [...] "What a liar I turned out to be!" [...] remarked Douglas, then suggested the motivation behind all the digging and diversion in saying, [...] "Their mommies obviously never let them play with mud pies, so now they <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> us by playing with cement".|$|E

2500|$|Jewish graves in Wellington were {{subsequently}} vandalised with Swastikas and Nazi slogans carved into and around 16 Jewish graves. The {{head of the}} New Zealand-Jewish community, David Zwartz, said, [...] "there is a direct connection between the very strong expressions against Israel and people here feeling they can <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> Jews. It seems to me Israel-bashing one day, Jew-bashing the next day." ...|$|E
2500|$|Before {{the start}} of the Test series, Yashpal Sharma, who was {{replaced}} in the national selection panel, accused Chappell of questioning his integrity and interfering with selection of the team. Following this, Chappell remarked that his spat with Ganguly was [...] "blown out of proportion" [...] and went on to say, [...] "He [...] was frustrated that he lost a job which he obviously wanted to keep. I had no part in him losing his job, but he had to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> someone.".|$|E
2500|$|In {{the extreme}} shoot {{interview}} released by Highspots in 2005, Awesome conspired that the infamous incident between Vince Russo and Hulk Hogan at Bash at the Beach 2000 {{may have been}} one of the underlying reasons as to why he was plagued by a string of unfavorable gimmicks. As a cousin of Michael Bollea, Awesome suggested that Russo may have thought that he was just [...] "too close of kin" [...] to Hogan and decided to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> him.

2500|$|In {{a review}} from Rickey.org, Nick Roman said, [...] "Last week, I was pretty miffed about Once Upon A Time and its {{treatment}} of Regina (Lana Parrilla). While I ultimately liked the episode, {{it felt like the}} show was continuing to use her as a punching bag to move the plot forward. Need something bad to happen to one of our characters? Just <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> Regina! Granted, it’s a formula that has served Once Upon A Time in the past, but at this point, it just felt repetitive. That’s why “Only You” and “An Untold Story” provided such a fresh change of pace for a season finale that not only sets up the next phase of the story, but also promises to put Regina in a more central role." ...|$|E
2500|$|Critical {{reception}} to Luke fon Fabre has {{ranged from}} negative to positive {{based on his}} appearances in Tales of the Abyss. Based on his first impression of the game, Jeff Haynes from IGN called Luke a [...] "spoiled and sheltered child" [...] and noted how he was the opposite of Tear. GameSpot's Ashton Raze noted that Luke [...] "is highly obnoxious, at least at first, {{and the way the}} other characters riff off his behavior is entertaining." [...] Casey Brienza from Anime News Network (ANN) saw Luke's interactions with Cheagle Mieu as a big appeal in the anime's second episode. [...] "Anyone who has ever briefly nurtured homicidal thoughts when confronted by yet another cute anime creature will rejoice at his comedic whack-a-mole treatment and die laughing at his instantaneous hatred of its high-pitched squeal". Carl Kimlinger also from ANN found the character irritating. Christian Nutt of GamesRadar noted that Luke will probably annoy most players saying [...] "though any guy who's made it through his teens will wince... this stuff cuts close to the bone." [...] He also annoys the game's other characters and [...] "when the first big plot twist hits, they <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> him - too much". Alex Fuller of RPGamer commented that: [...] "The exceedingly good handling of character development is easily Abyss' biggest storytelling strength. Luke's journey from selfish and sheltered brat into the final hero of the game is plotted superbly." [...] Dan Whitehead of Eurogamer commented that Luke, in particular, stands out within the RPG genre's heroes [...] "as his evolution from spoiled brat to worthy hero is enjoyably organic." ...|$|E

Murray is thirty [...] years old--a tall, slender, rather unusual-looking fellow with a [...] pale face, sunken under high cheek bones, lined about the eyes and [...] mouth, jaded and worn for one still so young. His intelligent, [...] large hazel eyes have a tired, dispirited expression in repose, but [...] can quicken instantly with a concealed mechanism of mocking, [...] careless humour whenever his inner privacy is threatened. His large [...] mouth aids this process of protection by a quick change from its [...] set apathy to a cheerful grin of cynical good nature. He gives off [...] the impression of being somehow dissatisfied with himself, but not [...] yet embittered enough by it to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> others. His manner, [...] as revealed by his speech--nervous, inquisitive, alert--seems more [...] an acquired quality than any part of his real nature. He stoops a [...] trifle, giving him a slightly round-shouldered appearance. He is [...] dressed in a shabby dark suit, baggy at the knees. He is staring [...] into the fire, dreaming, an open book lying unheeded on the arm of [...] his chair. The gramophone is whining out the last strains of [...] Dvorak's Humoresque. In the doorway to the office, Miss Gilpin [...] stands talking to Miss Howard. The former is a slight, [...] middle-aged woman with black hair, and a strong, intelligent face, [...] its expression of resolute efficiency softened and made kindly by [...] her warm, sympathetic grey eyes. Miss Howard is tall, slender and [...] blonde--decidedly pretty and provokingly conscious of it, yet with [...] a certain air of seriousness underlying her apparent frivolity. She [...] is twenty years old. The elder woman is dressed in the all-white of [...] a full-fledged nurse. Miss Howard wears the grey-blue uniform of [...] one still in training. The record finishes. Murray sighs with [...] relief, but makes no move to get up and stop the grinding needle. [...] Miss Howard hurries across to the machine. Miss Gilpin goes back [...] into the office.|$|E
6000|$|That, {{with the}} new day, was once more her law--though she saw before her, of course, as {{something}} of a complication, her need, each time, to decide. She should have to be clear as to how a dove would act. She settled it, she thought, well enough this morning by quite readopting her plan in respect to Sir Luke Strett. That, she was pleased to reflect, had originally been pitched in the key of a merely iridescent drab; and although Mrs. Stringham, after breakfast, began by staring at it {{as if it had been}} a priceless Persian carpet suddenly unrolled at her feet, she had no scruple, at the end of five minutes, in leaving her to make the best of it. [...] "Sir Luke Strett comes, by appointment, to see me at eleven, but I'm going out on purpose. He's to be told, please, deceptively, that I'm at home, and, you, as my representative, when he comes up, are to see him instead. He will like that, this time, better. So do be nice to him." [...] It had taken, naturally, more explanation, and the mention, above all, of the fact that the visitor was the greatest of doctors; yet when once the key had been offered Susie slipped it on her bunch, and her young friend could again feel her lovely imagination operate. It operated in truth very much as Mrs. Lowder's, at the last, had done the night before: it made the air heavy once more with the extravagance of assent. It might, afresh, almost have frightened our young woman to see how people rushed to meet her: had she then so little time to live that the road must always be spared her? It was as if they were helping her to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> the spot. Susie--she couldn't deny, and didn't pretend to--might, of a truth, on her side, have treated such news as a flash merely lurid; as to which, to do Susie justice, the pain of it was all there. But, none the less, the margin always allowed her young friend was all there as well; and the proposal now made her what was it in short but Byzantine? The vision of Milly's perception of the propriety of the matter had, at any rate, quickly engulfed, so far as her attitude was concerned, any surprise and any shock; so that she only desired, the next thing, perfectly to possess the facts. Milly could easily speak, on this, as if there were only one: she made nothing of such another as that she had felt herself menaced. The great fact, in fine, was that she knew him to desire just now, more than anything else, to meet, quite apart, some one interested in her. Who therefore so interested as her faithful Susan? The only other circumstance that, by the time she had quitted her friend, she had treated as worth mentioning was the circumstance of her having at first intended to keep quiet. She had originally best seen herself as sweetly secretive. As to that she had changed, and her present request was the result. She didn't say why she had changed, but she trusted her faithful Susan. Their visitor would trust her not less, and she herself would adore their visitor. Moreover he wouldn't--the girl felt sure--tell her anything dreadful. The worst would be that he was in love and that he needed a confidant to work it. And now she was going to the National Gallery.|$|E
