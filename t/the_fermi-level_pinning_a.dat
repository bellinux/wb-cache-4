Compared with the control Al/n-Ge sample without ZnO, Al/ZnO/n-Ge devices exhibit the improved reverse J, {{which is due to}} <b>the</b> <b>Fermi-level</b> depinning induced by the reduction of metal-induced-gap-states (MIGS) at metal/Ge interface [18, 19].

If the ZnO is not thick enough, MIGS will not be effectively eliminated, and it still shows rectifying characteristics. But if the ZnO is too thick, the series resistance of ZnO will dominate the whole resistance, and the current gets smaller. So there is a trade-off between elimination of MIGS and increase in series resistance of ZnO, and thus there is a critical thickness for the IL [19].

30|$|In conclusion, we have {{produced}} and characterized Ge QDs (2 to 10 nm in size) embedded in silica by thermal annealing of a SiGeO film produced by magnetron sputtering. The light absorption spectra of the investigated Ge QDs have been measured, demonstrating that the optical bandgap of these nanostructures, {{both in the}} amorphous or crystalline phase, is pinned at about 1.6 eV, regardless of the QD size and then of the confinement extent. Moreover, we showed that for a given amount of clustered Ge, the probability of photon absorption is larger the smaller is the QD size. By modeling the photon absorption mechanism, we evidenced that it {{is related to the}} surfaces of Ge QDs rather than to their volume, through the mediation of the electronic states localized at the interface between Ge QDs and the hosting matrix. This behavior has been discussed in comparison with <b>the</b> <b>Fermi-level</b> <b>pinning</b> observed in metal/Ge contacts. The reported surface effect on the light absorption in Ge QDs should be kept into account for both the electronic gap calculations and for any application in photovoltaic devices. As far as the optical bandgap is concerned, Ge QDs, in conjunction with confined and bulk Si, give the chance to efficiently modulate the onset of light absorption from 1.1 eV (bulk Si) up to more than 2 eV (Si QDs).|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> {{problem of}} <b>Fermi-level</b> <b>pinning</b> at semiconductor-metal {{contacts}} is readdressed starting from first-principles calculations for Al/GaAs. We give quantitative {{evidence that the}} Schottky barrier height is very little affected by any structural distortions on the metal side [...] -including elongations of the metal-semiconductor bond (i. e. interface strain) [...] -whereas it strongly depends on the interface structure on the semiconductor side. A rationale for these findings is given {{in terms of the}} interface dipole generated by the ionic effective charges. Comment: 5 pages, latex file, 2 postscript figures automatically include...|$|R
40|$|We perform density {{functional}} theory calculations for {{the determination}} of the structural and electronic properties of epitaxial graphene on 4 H-SiC(0001 ̅). Using commensurate supercells that minimize non-physical stresses we show that, in contrast with Si-face epitaxial films, the first graphene layer that forms on the C-face of SiC is purely metallic with its π-bands partially preserved. Typical free-standing characteristics are fully recovered with a second graphene layer. We moreover discuss on the magnetic properties of the interface and <b>the</b> absence of <b>Fermi-level</b> <b>pinning</b> effects that could allow for a plausible device operation starting from the off-state.
