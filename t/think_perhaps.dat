500|$|When he {{returned}} to the topic of the Crucifixion eleven years later, he retained some of the stylistic elements he had developed earlier, such as the elongated and dislocated organic forms that he now based on Oresteia. He continued to incorporate the spatial device he was to use many times throughout his career—three lines radiating from this central figure, which was first seen in Crucifixion, 1933. Three Studies was painted over the course of two weeks in 1944, when, Bacon recalled, [...] "I was in a bad mood of drinking, and I did it under tremendous hangovers and drink; I sometimes hardly knew what I was doing. I <b>think</b> <b>perhaps</b> the drink helped me to be a bit freer." [...] The painting was executed in a ground-floor flat at 7 Cromwell Place, South Kensington in London. A large back room in the building had been converted into a billiard room by its previous occupant, artist John Everett Millais. It was Bacon's studio by day; at night, abetted by Eric Hall and Bacon's childhood nanny Jessie Lightfoot, it functioned as an illicit casino.|$|E

"Religiously, I <b>think</b> <b>perhaps</b> the silliest idea abroad—and {{one which}} is {{calculated}} to divide the people of God—is {{the idea that there}} is some sort of special inspiration attached to the...King James Version....Moreover, it is a heresy because it implies that God did not completely inspire the original manuscripts and therefore in 1611 He had to add inspiration." ...|$|E

2500|$|Caillat, in contrast, cites Fleetwood as [...] "still one of {{the most}} amazing drummers I've ever met. He had his rack of tom drums {{arranged}} back to front. Most drummers place them from high to low (in pitch) from their left to right, but Mick chose to place his mid, high, low. I <b>think</b> <b>perhaps</b> this helped him develop his unique style. He hit his drums very hard, except for his kick drum. For some reason, when he played his high hat, it distracted him. He would keep perfect beat with his kick, but he played it so softly that we could hear his mouth noises through his kick mic." ...|$|E
2500|$|Virgil {{eventually}} convinces Johanna true {{love can}} overcome their social differences, and he asks the emperor {{for her hand}} in marriage. This is the crucial scene in the picture, and brings the otherwise lightweight movie plot to a higher level. The Emperor is cordial and fatherly with Virgil, and treats him with respect and even a bit of admiration. But he is certain Johanna could never be happy living in Newark, New Jersey. [...] "We are not better than you," [...] explains the Emperor sadly, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>perhaps</b> you are better than us. But we are like snails: If you take us out of our majestic shells, we die." ...|$|E

2500|$|In October 1990 Hepburn went to Vietnam, in {{an effort}} to {{collaborate}} with the government for national UNICEF-supported immunisation and clean water programmes. In September 1992, four months before she died, Hepburn went to Somalia. Calling it [...] "apocalyptic", she said, [...] "I walked into a nightmare. I have seen famine in Ethiopia and Bangladesh, but I have seen nothing like this – so much worse than I could possibly have imagined. I wasn't prepared for this." [...] Though scarred by what she had seen, Hepburn still had hope. [...] "Taking care of children {{has nothing to do with}} politics. I <b>think</b> <b>perhaps</b> with time, instead of there being a politicisation of humanitarian aid, there will be a humanisation of politics." ...|$|E
2500|$|Orton was cremated at the Golders Green Crematorium, his maroon cloth-draped coffin {{being brought}} into the west chapel to a {{recording}} of The Beatles song [...] "A Day in the Life". Harold Pinter read the eulogy, concluding with [...] "He was a bloody marvellous writer." [...] According to Dennis Dewsnap's memoir, What's Sex Got To Do With It (The Syden Press, 2004), Orton and Halliwell had their ashes mixed and were buried together. Dewsnap writes about Orton's agent Peggy Ramsay: [...] "...At the scattering of Joe's and Kenneth's ashes, his sister took a handful from both urns and said, 'A little bit of Joe, {{and a little bit}} of Kenneth. I <b>think</b> <b>perhaps</b> a little bit more of our Joe, and then some more of Kenneth.' At which Peggy snapped, 'Come on, dearie, it's only a gesture, not a recipe. She described Orton's relatives as simply [...] "the little people in Leicester", leaving a cold, nondescript note and bouquet at the funeral on their behalf.|$|E

At first Fulvia tells Ezio that yes, she has agreed to marry the Emperor but finally has to admit it is a pretense, she still loves Ezio. Valentiniano has Ezio thrown into prison.|$|R
