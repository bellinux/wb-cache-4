40|$|Pervasive {{computing}} environments typically change {{frequently in}} terms of available resources and their properties. Applications in pervasive computing use contexts to capture these changes and adapt their behaviors accordingly. However, contexts available to these applications may be abnormal or imprecise due to environmental noises. This may result in context inconsistencies, which imply that contexts conflict with each other. The inconsistencies may set such an application into a wrong state or lead the application <b>to</b> <b>misadjust</b> its behavior. It is thus desirable to detect and resolve the context inconsistencies in a timely way. One popular approach is to detect context inconsistencies when contexts breach certain consistency constraints. Existing constraint checking techniques recheck the entire expression of each affected consistency constraint upon context changes. When a changed context affects only a constraint’s subexpression, rechecking the entire expression can adversely delay the detection of other context inconsistencies. This article proposes a rigorous approach to identifying the parts of previous checking results that are reusable without entire rechecking. We evaluated our work on the Cabot middleware through both simulation experiments and a case study. The experimental results reported that our approach achieved over a fifteenfol...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} shown that {{exercise}} is helpful against brain disorders. However, this may not be true for intense exercise (IE). Because it is easy <b>to</b> <b>misadjust</b> exercise intensity with physical condition, it is essential to know the effects of IE on cognitive process because it may have important consequences on people skills and work skills. We investigated the effects of IE on male C 57 B 1 / 6 mice, 3 -mo-old, undergoing 10 days of intense and exhaustive running program on cognition and its possible relationship with brain oxidative stress. Cognition was evaluated by three different cognitive tests: passive avoidance task, contextual fear conditioning, and tone fear conditioning, performed 24 h after the last exercise session. Brain oxidative stress was evaluated by lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation. There was a remarkable memory reduction of exercised animals in comparison with the control group, associated with increase in the brain oxidative stress, with no alterations in shock sensitivity, locomotion and anxiety parameters. Concurrent vitamin C and E supplementation fully prevented the memory decrement induced by IE and partially recovered both the increased the brain lipid peroxidation and the protein oxidation. in conclusion, IE- induces a high index of brain oxidative stress and impairs memory in murine model that was prevented by vitamin C and E supplementation.

40|$|The article {{describes}} {{a mathematical model}} of an algorithm used in calculation of the charge burden <b>to</b> correct the <b>misadjusted</b> chemical composition of metal melt. The model assumes that the charge materials covered by calculations are characterised by a fuzzy (uncertain) chemical composition. The model also assumes different yield of chemical elements from the metal melt and charge materials. The discussion is completed with an example of calculations illustrating practical application of the said algorithm...|$|R

For an instantaneous adjustment of the manufacturing prices, stock values and exchange rates may appear <b>to</b> misjump or <b>misadjust</b> at the instant of the monetary policy announcement. When the manufacturing prices adjust sluggishly, exchange rates may overshoot but stock values can exhibit various dynamic patterns, including overshooting or undershooting.

40|$|No {{two people}} are alike. We usually ignore this {{diversity}} as we {{have the capability to}} adapt and, without noticing, become experts in interfaces that were probably <b>misadjusted</b> <b>to</b> begin with. This adaptation is not always at the user’s reach. One neglected group is the blind. Spatial ability, memory, and tactile sensitivity are some characteristics that diverge between users. Regardless, all are presented with the same methods ignoring their capabilities and needs. Interaction with mobile devices is highly visually demanding which widens the gap between blind people. Our research goal is to identify the individual attributes that influence mobile interaction, considering the blind, and match them with mobile interaction modalities in a comprehensive and extensible design space. We aim to provide knowledge both for device design, device prescription and interface adaptation...|$|R
40|$|Part 2 : Long and Short PapersInternational audienceNo two {{persons are}} alike. We usually ignore this {{diversity}} {{as we have}} the capability to adapt and, without noticing, become experts in interfaces that were probably <b>misadjusted</b> <b>to</b> begin with. This adaptation is not always at the user’s reach. One neglected group is the blind. Age of blindness onset, age, cognitive, and sensory abilities are some characteristics that diverge between users. Regardless, all are presented with the same methods ignoring their capabilities and needs. Interaction with mobile devices is highly visually demanding which widens the gap between blind people. Herein, we present studies performed with 13 blind people consisting on key acquisition tasks with 10 mobile devices. Results show that different capability levels have significant impact on user performance and that this impact is related with the device and its demands. It is paramount to understand mobile interaction demands and relate them with the users’ capabilities, towards inclusive design...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In Portugal, product {{development}} in decorative ceramic industry is usually done using traditional methodologies. In most cases manual modelling is used, {{which is very}} slow, highly inaccurate and demands skilled persons, {{that are difficult to}} find and too much time consuming to train. These methodologies, highly <b>misadjusted</b> <b>to</b> the new marketing demands, tend to decrease companies competitiveness. This paper explains some of the work that has been done at INEGI, seeking the introduction of new methodologies for {{product development}} of decorative ceramic components, using CAD 3 D design or engineering tools. Traditionally in the Portuguese ceramic industry, only few products are developed using CAD 3 D tools. Considering that CAD 3 D files are used {{since the beginning of the}} project, it is possible to accelerate the optimization of the geometry, producing, by different rapid prototyping technologies, solid models, like the ones obtained with SLA, SLS and LOM processes. However, more important than this first stage, is the prototype production tools based on LOM rapid prototyping models, which offer important time and money savings. In future mass production, the prototype files used for RP tools generation, can also be used in a more accurate and high quality CNC tools production...|$|R
