5|$|Juvenile magpies begin {{foraging}} {{on their}} own three weeks after leaving the nest, and mostly feeding themselves by six months old. Some birds continue begging for food until eight or nine months of age, but are usually ignored. Birds reach adult size by their first year. <b>The</b> <b>age</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> young birds disperse varies across the country, and depends on the aggressiveness of the dominant adult of the corresponding sex; males are usually evicted at a younger age. Many leave at around a year old, but the age of departure may range from eight months to four years.|$|E

5|$|Pinnipeds have lifespans {{averaging}} 25–30 years. Females usually live longer, as males tend {{to fight}} and often die before reaching maturity. The longest recorded lifespans include 43 years for a wild female ringed seal and 46 years for a wild female grey seal. <b>The</b> <b>age</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> a pinniped sexually matures can vary from 2–12 years depending on the species.

5|$|A land tax, {{aimed at}} {{breaking}} up big estates and give wider scope for small-scale farming, was also introduced, while {{coverage of the}} Arbitration system was extended to agricultural workers, domestics, and federal public servants. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>age</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> women became entitled to the old-age pension was lowered from sixty-five to sixty. The introduction of the maternity allowance was a major reform, because it enabled more births to be attended by doctors, thus leading to reductions in infant mortality rates. Compulsory preference to trade unionists in federal employment was also introduced, while the Seaman's Compensation Act of 1911 and the Navigation Act of 1912 were enacted to improve conditions for those working at sea, together with compensatory arrangements for seamen and next of kin. Eligibility for pensions was also widened. From December 1912 onwards, naturalised residents {{no longer had to}} wait three years to be eligible for a pension. That same year, the value of a pensioner's home was excluded from consideration when assessing the value of their property.|$|E
5|$|Homosexual arousal in {{childhood}} appeared to predict adult homosexuality, while homosexual activities and arousal during adolescence {{had a very}} strong connection with adult homosexuality. Rape and sexual molestation {{did not appear to be}} significant in the development of homosexuality. Heterosexual arousal during childhood had a very small effect on adult sexual preference. Homosexual women were more likely to have their first homosexual encounter before their first heterosexual encounter. Phenomena associated with physical maturation, such as <b>the</b> <b>age</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> menstruation began, did not appear to play a significant role in the development of sexual preference, while parental attitudes toward sex and failure to enjoy early heterosexual activity also seemed unimportant. Sexual feelings seemed important in the development of adult homosexuality.|$|E
5|$|Interior Minister Anne Holmlund, who {{had ordered}} the {{original}} investigation into the police officers' conduct in the Kauhajoki incident, said that legislation would be introduced to aid police officers in accessing information about the {{mental and physical health}} of applicants for firearms licenses. This included, potentially, the ability to gain detailed information about an applicant's health, the right to subpoena records from the Finnish Social Insurance Institution, and the right to request further information if the applicant had a history of using medication. In addition to this, Holmlund said that the referencing process for being granted a firearms license would be intensified: two referees would have to be personally interviewed before a license was granted. Holmlund also pointed to legislation of the EU as her starting point. Other reforms, that she said would be introduced as late as spring 2009, included a national register of gun owners. Parliamentary debates occurred on whether to raise <b>the</b> <b>age</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> one could own a gun, or whether to put further checks in place, in September 2009.|$|E

5|$|The World Health Organization, the European Union {{and other}} {{regional}} bodies, national governments and parliaments have formed alcohol policies {{in order to}} reduce the harm of alcoholism. Targeting adolescents and young adults is regarded as an important step to reduce the harm of alcohol abuse. Increasing <b>the</b> <b>age</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> licit drugs of abuse such as alcohol can be purchased, the banning or restricting advertising of alcohol has been recommended as additional ways of reducing the harm of alcohol dependence and abuse. Credible, evidence based educational campaigns in the mass media about the consequences of alcohol abuse have been recommended. Guidelines for parents to prevent alcohol abuse amongst adolescents, and for helping young people with mental health problems have also been suggested.|$|E
5|$|The {{aim of the}} ducker was to {{get every}} {{duckling}} as fat as possible {{by the age of}} eight weeks (the first moult, <b>the</b> <b>age</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> they would be killed for meat), while avoiding any foods which would build up their bones or make their flesh greasy. In their first week after hatching, the ducklings would be fed on boiled eggs, toast soaked in water, boiled rice and beef liver. From the second week on, this diet would gradually be replaced by barley meal and boiled rice mixed with greaves. (Some larger-scale duckers would boil a horse or sheep and feed this to the ducklings in place of greaves.) This high-protein diet was supplemented with nettles, cabbage and lettuce to provide a source of vitamins. As with all poultry, ducks require grit in their diet to break up the food and make it digestible. Aylesbury ducklings' drinking water was laced with grit from Long Marston and Gubblecote; this grit also gave their bills their distinctive pinkish colour. Around 85% of ducklings would survive this eight-week rearing process to be sent to market.|$|E
5|$|The four-horned {{antelope}} is diurnal (active mainly during the day). Though solitary by nature, {{four-horned antelope}}s may form loose {{groups of three}} to five –with one or more adults, sometimes accompanied by juveniles. This elusive antelope feeds on grasses, herbs, shrubs, foliage, flowers and fruits. It needs to drink water frequently; as such it stays in places near water sources. The breeding behaviour of the four-horned antelope has not been well studied. <b>The</b> <b>age</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> they reach sexual maturity and the season when mating occurs have not been understood well. Gestation lasts about eight months, following which one or two calves are born. They are kept concealed {{for the first few}} weeks of their birth.

5|$|Although {{there is}} some debate within Islam over {{whether it is a}} {{religious}} requirement, circumcision (called khitan) is practiced nearly universally by Muslim males. Islam bases its practice of circumcision on the Genesis 17 narrative, the same Biblical chapter referred to by Jews. The procedure is not explicitly mentioned in the Quran, however, it is a tradition established by Islam's prophet Muhammad directly (following Abraham), and so its practice is considered a sunnah (prophet's tradition) and is very important in Islam. For Muslims, circumcision is also a matter of cleanliness, purification and control over one's baser self (nafs). There is no agreement across the many Islamic communities about <b>the</b> <b>age</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> circumcision should be performed. It may be done from soon after birth up to about age 15; most often it is performed at around six to seven years of age. The timing can correspond with the boy's completion of his recitation of the whole Quran, with a coming-of-age event such as taking on the responsibility of daily prayer or betrothal. Circumcision may be celebrated with an associated family or community event. Circumcision is recommended for, but is not required of, converts to Islam.|$|E
5|$|Education in Malta is {{compulsory}} through age {{sixteen and}} is offered through three different providers: the state, the church, {{and the private}} sector. The state is responsible for promoting education and instruction and ensuring universal access to education for all Maltese citizens {{the existence of a}} system of schools and institutions accessible to all Maltese citizens. The objectives of education in Malta include intellectual and moral development and the preparation of every citizen to contribute productively to the national economy. Although Maltese citizens had access to education during the Arab occupation of 870 to 1090, the arrival of a number of religious orders in the following four centuries brought religious-based education to the island for wealthy families. The arrival of the Knights Hospitaller saw the establishment of the University of Malta, around which a number of primary, secondary and post-secondary institutions were established. Education in Malta has been universally available at the primary level since the ejection of the Knights Hospitaller by the French in 1798, when state-funded elementary schooling was established. In 1878, English replaced Italian as the primary language of instruction, and education was made compulsory in 1946 in response to a number of children not attending school due to poverty between World Wars One and Two. <b>The</b> <b>age</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> education became compulsory was lowered to five years in 1988.|$|E
5|$|Individual mysids {{are either}} male or female, and {{fertilisation}} is external. The gonads {{are in the}} thorax and are tubular in shape. Males have two gonopores in the eighth thoracic segment {{and a pair of}} long penises. The female gonopores are in the sixth thoracic segment and the oostegites are attached to the first to seventh pereopods to form a brood pouch. Mating usually takes place at night and lasts only a few minutes. During the process, the male inserts his penises into the marsupium and releases sperm. This stimulates the female and the eggs are usually released into the marsupium within an hour. Here they are fertilised and retained, development of the embryos in the brood pouch being direct with the young hatching from the eggs as miniature adults. The size of a mysid brood generally correlates with body length and environmental factors such as density and food availability. <b>The</b> <b>age</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> mysids reach sexual maturity depends on water temperature and food availability. For the species Mysidopsis bahia, this is normally at 12 to 20 days. The young are released soon afterwards, and although their numbers are usually low, the short reproductive cycle of mysid adults means a new brood can be produced every four to seven days.|$|E

5|$|The {{timing of}} the {{coronation}} has varied throughout British history. King Edgar's coronation was some 15 years after his accession in 957 {{and may have been}} intended to mark the high point of his reign, or that he reached the age of 30, <b>the</b> <b>age</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> Jesus Christ was baptised. HaroldII was crowned on the day {{after the death of his}} predecessor, Edward the Confessor, the rush probably reflecting the contentious nature of Harold's succession; whereas the first Norman monarch, WilliamI, was also crowned on the day he became king, 25December 1066, but three weeks since the surrender of English nobles and bishops at Berkhampstead, allowing time to prepare a spectacular ceremony. Most of his successors were crowned within weeks, or even days, of their accession. EdwardI was fighting in the Ninth Crusade when he acceded to the throne in 1272; he was crowned soon after his return in 1274. EdwardII's coronation, similarly, was delayed by a campaign in Scotland in 1307. HenryVI was only a few months old when he acceded in 1422; he was crowned in 1429, but did not officially assume the reins of government until he was deemed of sufficient age, in 1437. Pre-modern coronations were usually either on a Sunday, the Christian Sabbath, or on a Christian holiday. Edgar's coronation was at Pentecost, WilliamI's on Christmas Day, possibly in imitation of the Byzantine emperors, and John's was on Ascension Day. Elizabeth I consulted her astrologer, John Dee, before deciding on an auspicious date. The coronations of Charles II in 1661 and Anne in 1702 were on St George's Day, the feast of the patron saint of England.|$|E
