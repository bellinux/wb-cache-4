5|$|In {{theoretical}} physics, the anti-de Sitter/conformal {{field theory}} correspondence, sometimes called Maldacena duality or gauge/gravity duality, is a conjectured relationship between {{two kinds of}} physical <b>theories.</b> On one side are anti-de Sitter spaces (AdS) which are used in <b>theories</b> of quantum gravity, formulated in terms of string theory or M-theory. On {{the other side of}} the correspondence are conformal field <b>theories</b> (CFT) which are quantum field <b>theories,</b> including <b>theories</b> similar to the Yang–Mills <b>theories</b> that describe elementary particles.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Witten's announcement, string theorists had {{identified}} five versions of superstring theory. Although these <b>theories</b> appeared, at first, {{to be very}} different, work by several physicists showed that the <b>theories</b> were related in intricate and nontrivial ways. In particular, physicists found that apparently distinct <b>theories</b> could be unified by mathematical transformations called S-duality and T-duality. Witten's conjecture was {{based in part on}} the existence of these dualities and in part on the relationship of the string <b>theories</b> to a field theory called eleven-dimensional supergravity.|$|E
5|$|<b>Theories</b> {{about the}} origin of {{language}} differ in regard to their basic assumptions about what language is. Some <b>theories</b> are {{based on the idea that}} language is so complex that one cannot imagine it simply appearing from nothing in its final form, but that it must have evolved from earlier pre-linguistic systems among our pre-human ancestors. These <b>theories</b> can be called continuity-based <b>theories.</b> The opposite viewpoint is that language is such a unique human trait that it cannot be compared to anything found among non-humans and that it must therefore have appeared suddenly in the transition from pre-hominids to early man. These <b>theories</b> can be defined as discontinuity-based. Similarly, <b>theories</b> based on Chomsky's generative view of language see language mostly as an innate faculty that is largely genetically encoded, whereas functionalist <b>theories</b> see it as a system that is largely cultural, learned through social interaction.|$|E

5|$|A few {{theoretical}} physicists {{have argued}} that classical physics is intrinsically incapable of explaining the holistic aspects of consciousness, but that quantum theory may provide the missing ingredients. Several theorists have therefore proposed quantum mind (QM) <b>theories</b> of consciousness. Notable <b>theories</b> falling into this category include the holonomic brain theory of Karl Pribram and David Bohm, and the Orch-OR theory formulated by Stuart Hameroff and Roger Penrose. Some of these QM <b>theories</b> offer descriptions of phenomenal consciousness, as well as QM interpretations of access consciousness. None of the quantum mechanical <b>theories</b> has been confirmed by experiment. Recent publications by G. Guerreshi, J. Cia, S. Popescu, and H. Briegel could falsify proposals {{such as those of}} Hameroff, which rely on quantum entanglement in protein. At the present time many scientists and philosophers consider the arguments for an important role of quantum phenomena to be unconvincing.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} {{conspiracy}} <b>theories</b> {{have been proposed}} about the events surrounding the bombing. Some <b>theories</b> allege that individuals in the government, including President Bill Clinton, knew of the impending bombing and intentionally failed to act on that knowledge. Other <b>theories</b> focus on initial reports by local news stations of multiple other unexploded bombs within the building itself as evidence of remnants of a controlled demolition; following the attack, search and rescue operations at the site were delayed until the area had been declared safe by the Oklahoma City bomb squad and federal authorities. According to both a situation report compiled by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and a memo issued by the United States Atlantic Command the day following the attack, a second bomb located within the building was disarmed while a third was evacuated. Further <b>theories</b> focus on additional conspirators involved with the bombing. Additional <b>theories</b> claim the bombing {{was carried out by}} the government in order to frame the militia movement or to provide the impetus for new antiterrorism legislation while using McVeigh as a scapegoat. Other conspiracy <b>theories</b> suggest that foreign agents, particularly Islamic terrorists but also the Japanese government or German Neo-Nazis, were involved in the bombing. Experts have disputed the <b>theories</b> and government investigations have been opened at various times to look into the <b>theories.</b>|$|E

5|$|In general, {{the term}} duality {{refers to a}} {{situation}} where two seemingly different physical systems {{turn out to be}} equivalent in a nontrivial way. If two <b>theories</b> are related by a duality, it means that one theory can be transformed in some way so that it ends up looking just like the other theory. The two <b>theories</b> are then said to be dual to one another under the transformation. Put differently, the two <b>theories</b> are mathematically different descriptions of the same phenomena.|$|E
5|$|In {{opposition}} to the formal <b>theories</b> of the generative school, functional <b>theories</b> of language propose that since language is fundamentally a tool, its structures are best analyzed and understood by reference to their functions. Formal <b>theories</b> of grammar seek to define the different elements of language and describe the way they {{relate to each other}} as systems of formal rules or operations, while functional <b>theories</b> seek to define the functions performed by language and then relate them to the linguistic elements that carry them out. The framework of cognitive linguistics interprets language in terms of the concepts (which are sometimes universal, and sometimes specific to a particular language) which underlie its forms. Cognitive linguistics is primarily concerned with how the mind creates meaning through language.|$|E
