5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>icon</b> {{not only}} {{attracted}} soldiers, {{but also the}} inhabitants, by its powers. In time, healings of the sick, cleansing of the sinned, and conversion of the pagans were attributed to <b>the</b> <b>icon.</b> <b>The</b> <b>icon</b> was declared officially miraculous in 1737. The news of this icon travelled all over Europe due to the praise given by printers, writers, and polemists. The wife of Jan Kaietan Jablonowski, Theresa from Wilgorska created for <b>the</b> <b>icon</b> a silver crown and gown. In 1752-1788, the priest Wojec Bilinsky donated silver and gems to <b>the</b> <b>icon.</b> <b>The</b> miraculous nature of <b>the</b> <b>icon</b> is catalogued in W. Urban's work [...] "The <b>icon</b> of <b>the</b> Mother of God of Marijampil in Wrocław" [...] (Wrocław, 1981, in Polish).

5|$|Basiliscus re-instated Timothy Aelurus and Peter the Fuller {{to their}} sees, and by persuasion {{of the former}} issued (9 April 475) a {{circular}} letter (Enkyklikon) to the bishops calling them to accept as valid only the first three ecumenical synods, and reject the Council of Chalcedon. All bishops were to sign the edict. While most of the Eastern bishops accepted the letter, Patriarch Acacius of Constantinople refused, {{with the support of}} the population of the city, clearly showing his disdain towards Basiliscus by draping <b>the</b> <b>icons</b> in Hagia Sophia in black.|$|E

5000|$|In 1990, <b>the</b> <b>icon</b> {{was taken}} down from its altar for new {{photography}} and image restoration {{commissioned by the}} General Government of Redemptorists. The Redemptorist Order entered into contract with the Technical Department at the Vatican Museum to restore <b>the</b> <b>icon</b> and prevent further fungal damage to <b>the</b> <b>icon.</b> <b>The</b> restoration process involved X-ray, infra-red scanning, technical analysis of the paint and ultra-violet testing along with a Carbon-14-test which placed <b>the</b> <b>icon</b> between <b>the</b> year 1325-1480.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>icon</b> of Archangel {{has been}} {{considered}} as the main patron of the village Mutso during <b>the</b> centuries. <b>The</b> <b>icon</b> was kept on the mount Daquekhi (დაქუეხი) (mountain Tebulosmta, თბულოსმთა) which is always covered by snow.

After that, people started praying there.|$|R
50|$|Following {{the onset}} of the Russo-Japanese War, the devotees donated money for {{materials}} needed for making <b>the</b> <b>icon.</b> <b>The</b> image itself was painted free of charge by icon painter Pavel Shtronda in 1904 according to the sailor's vision. <b>The</b> <b>icon,</b> however, was not delivered to Port Arthur in time and the Siege of Port Arthur, as well as the war in general, ended with Russian defeat (for this reason <b>the</b> <b>icon</b> is also called the Unachieved Victory). Nonetheless <b>the</b> <b>icon</b> continued to be venerated and six copies were made. <b>The</b> <b>icon</b> was considered lost for more than 90 years.

5|$|Colin McRae Rally is {{a racing}} video {{game in which}} players can drive cars in {{point-to-point}} rally events. The game can be played from a behind-the-car perspective or from a bonnet camera view. On mobile devices, cars can be steered using on-screen buttons which provide digital input or using tilt controls which provide analog input. The game's content and driving model are taken directly from the 2000 title Colin McRae Rally 2.0. The game features thirty rally stages from Colin McRae Rally 2.0, located in Australia, Corsica, and Greece. Terrain and surfaces vary between stages ranging from smooth tarmac roads to gravely off-road tracks. Track information is provided through verbal descriptions from the co-driver and icons that appear {{near the top of}} the screen. <b>The</b> <b>icons</b> display the severity and difficulty of turns using colour-coding. A progress indicator is also displayed on screen, so that the player can see how much of the course they have completed and compare their position to the computer drivers.|$|E
50|$|According to the Orthodox Church's Sacred Tradition, <b>the</b> <b>icon</b> was at {{one time}} in the {{possession}} of a widow in Nicaea. Not wanting <b>the</b> <b>icon</b> to be seized and destroyed by the iconoclasts, she spent all night in prayer and then cast <b>the</b> <b>icon</b> into <b>the</b> Mediterranean Sea. The widow's son later went to Mount Athos, where he became a monk and recounted the miracle of the bleeding wound, and how <b>the</b> <b>icon</b> had been placed in the sea. Much later, (ca. 1004) <b>the</b> <b>icon</b> was recovered from the sea by a Georgian monk named Gabriel (later canonized a saint in the Orthodox Church), who was laboring at the Iveron Monastery on Mount Athos. This occurred on Tuesday of Bright Week (Easter Week), and is commemorated annually on that day (as well as the fixed date of March 31). <b>The</b> <b>icon</b> was taken to the katholikon (main church) of the monastery from which <b>the</b> <b>icon</b> gets its name.|$|R
50|$|Since the 14th century, <b>the</b> <b>icon</b> {{was held}} in Tikhvin, where {{eventually}} Tikhvin Assumption Monastery was founded to host <b>the</b> <b>icon.</b> In 1941, during World War II, for a month Tikhvin was occupied by German troops, who looted the monastery and, in particular, took <b>the</b> <b>icon</b> to Pskov, and in 1944 transferred it to Riga. <b>The</b> <b>icon</b> eventually {{was taken out of}} Russia for safety by a Russian Orthodox bishop from Kolka parish and later Bishop of Riga - John (Garklavs) of Chicago. In the period between 1949 and 2004 <b>the</b> <b>icon</b> was stored in Chicago, United States. It was returned to Tikhvin, Russia in 2004 by his spiritual son, Fr. Sergei Garklavs of Chicago. <b>The</b> <b>icon</b> is kept at the Tikhvin Assumption Monastery, where it was kept prior to 1917. Most of <b>the</b> <b>icon,</b> except <b>the</b> two faces, is normally covered by a chased frame of precious metals and jewels (riza).|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Icon</b> of <b>the</b> Annunciation in St. Catherine's Monastery in Sinai, Egypt is {{an unusual}} Byzantine <b>icon</b> {{attributed}} to <b>the</b> late twelfth century. <b>The</b> Annunciation <b>icon</b> {{is an example of}} the late Komnenian-era style and was likely produced in Constantinople. <b>The</b> <b>icon,</b> tempera on wood, is one of <b>the</b> largest <b>icons</b> on display at St. Catherine's Monastery, standing 61 cm in height and 42.2 cm length. Very similar Annunciation icons exist to help establish the date of <b>the</b> Sinai <b>icon.</b> One at Kurbinovo in Yugoslavia, dated 1191, and <b>the</b> <b>icon</b> at Lagoudhere on Cyprus, dated 1192. <b>The</b> <b>icon</b> has distinctive elements that lead art historians, such as Evans and Wixom, to suggest <b>the</b> <b>icon</b> may have been produced at St. Catherine's Monastery itself rather than Constantinople. <b>The</b> Annunciation <b>icon</b> shares features found exclusively on other <b>icons</b> only at <b>the</b> Sinai monastery, such as the reflective circles scored in the surface of the gold and the grisaille medallion with the infant Christ on the Virgin Mary's breast.|$|R
5|$|Following the {{accession}} of Heraclius, the Sassanid advance pushed {{deep into}} the Levant, occupying Damascus and Jerusalem and removing the True Cross to Ctesiphon. The counter-attack launched by Heraclius took {{on the character of}} a holy war, and an acheiropoietos image of Christ was carried as a military standard (similarly, when Constantinople was saved from a combined Avar–Sassanid–Slavic siege in 626, the victory was attributed to <b>the</b> <b>icons</b> of the Virgin that were led in procession by Patriarch Sergius about the walls of the city). In this very siege of Constantinople of the year 626, amidst the climactic Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628, the combined Avar, Sassanid, and Slavic forces unsuccessfully besieged the Byzantine capital between June and July. After this, the Sassanid army was forced to withdraw to Anatolia. The loss came just after news had reached them of yet another Byzantine victory, where Heraclius's brother Theodore scored well against the Persian general Shahin. Following this, Heraclius led an invasion into Sassanid Mesopotamia once again.|$|E
5|$|Her parents, Franciszek Ksawery Plater and Anna von der Mohl (Anna z Mohlów), {{divorced}} {{when she was}} nine years old, in 1815. She was brought up by distant relatives, Michał Plater-Zyberk and Izabela Helena Syberg zu Wischling, in their family's manor Līksna near Daugavpils (Dźwina), then Inflanty (now Latvia). Well-educated, Plater was brought up to appreciate the efforts of Tadeusz Kościuszko and the Prince Józef Poniatowski. She was fascinated by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Friedrich Schiller, who she could read in the original German language. She was raised {{in an environment that}} valued the history of Poland, and her literary heroes included Princess Wanda and Adam Mickiewicz's Grażyna. She also admired Bouboulina, a woman who became one of <b>the</b> <b>icons</b> of the Greek uprising against the Ottomans, a Polish fighter Anna Dorota Chrzanowska, as well as Joan of Arc. These pursuits were accompanied by an early interest in equestrianism and marksmanship, quite uncommon for early 19th-century girls from aristocratic families. She was also deeply interested in Ruthenian and Belarusian folk culture. She had contacts and friends in the Filaret Association.|$|E
5|$|Philosophically, the Smarta {{tradition}} {{emphasizes that}} all idols (murti) are icons to help focus on and visualize aspects of Brahman, rather than distinct beings. The ultimate goal in {{this practice is}} to transition past the use of icons, recognize the Absolute symbolized by <b>the</b> <b>icons,</b> {{on the path to}} realizing the nondual identity of one's Atman (soul, self) and the Brahman. Popularized by Adi Shankara, many Panchayatana mandalas and temples have been uncovered that are from the Gupta Empire period, and one Panchayatana set from the village of Nand (about 24 kilometers from Ajmer) has been dated to belong to the Kushan Empire era (pre-300 CE). The Kushan period set includes Shiva, Vishnu, Surya, Brahma and one deity whose identity is unclear.|$|E
50|$|Throughout {{the centuries}} locals have revered <b>the</b> <b>icon</b> and have {{attributed}} miracles to its presence.

5|$|The XrossMediaBar, {{originally}} {{used on the}} PSX, is a graphical {{user interface}} currently used for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable, {{as well as a}} variety of other Sony devices. The interface features icons that are spread horizontally across the screen. Navigation moves <b>the</b> <b>icons</b> instead of a cursor. These icons are used as categories to organize the options available to the user. When an icon is selected on the horizontal bar, several more appear vertically, above and below it (selectable by the up and down directions on a directional pad). The XMB can also be accessed in-game albeit with restrictions, it allows players to access certain areas of the XMB menu from within the game and is only available for the PlayStation 3.

5|$|The chronicles of Genesios and Theophanes Continuatus (and {{following}} them Skylitzes and Zonaras), however, {{report that he}} survived his wounds, allegedly being miraculously cured after renouncing iconoclasm {{at the behest of}} some monks. The same sources report that after Theophilos's death, he assumed the overall command of the Byzantine army and was appointed a member of the regency council for the infant new emperor Michael III (r. 842–867) along with Theoktistos and Bardas. His standing was so high that the populace is said to have acclaimed him as emperor at the Hippodrome, but he refused to accept the post. The same writers report that he {{played an important role in}} the restoration of <b>the</b> <b>icons,</b> and that he became a protomagistros before falling out with Theoktistos, being accused of lèse-majesté, and retiring from public life to his estates. According to the same sources, in the late 850s, he saved the Emperor's life in another battle at Anzen and died shortly after. Traditional scholarship has largely accepted this account, but some modern historians have expressed doubts as to its veracity. The Belgian Byzantinist Henri Grégoire was the first to highlight its incompatibility with the narrative of Symeon Logothetes, speculating that it was a later invention, possibly carried out by the monks of the Monastery of Manuel, who venerated him as a saint and tried to mitigate his iconoclast past. Warren Treadgold, who considers Symeon Logothetes more reliable, also dismissed the reports of Manuel's post-838 survival as invented.|$|E

Révész's team put the icon of the Flight into Egypt in the first position, and immediately after the scene of the Death of Mary. The next picture depicted the Annunciation, and only then came the icon of the Birth of Mary. The tier was ended with scenes of the Visitation and the Presentation of Mary. On {{the right side of the}} Feasts tier, concentrating on Jesus' life, only two scenes were transposed. <b>The</b> <b>icons</b> of the Pentecost and the Triumphal entry into Jerusalem switched places after the 19th-century renovation work. Today <b>the</b> <b>icons</b> are once again in the correct chronological sequence. The mistaken order of the Feast icons was corrected in 2002.
