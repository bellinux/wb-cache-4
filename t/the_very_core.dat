The resulting confrontation between rebellious Veerashaivas and the conservative upper classes lead to the assassination of King Bijjala II and the eviction of most devotees, including Basavanna, from Kalyani. The successors of King Bijjala II were weak, prompting Chalukya Someshvara IV, ruling from Annigeri, to attempt rebuilding his empire by invading Kalyani in 1183. Though his invasion was successful, his overall efforts failed and the dynasty was ended by the Seuna rulers who drove Someshvara IV into exile in Banavasi in 1189. Though these turbulent events caused a setback to the Veerashaiva gatherings and creation of poems, the movement had set roots in the Kannada soil and regained popularity in the 15th century under the patronage of the rulers of the Vijayanagara Empire.|$|E

500|$|In this definition, Durkheim avoids {{references}} to supernatural or God. Durkheim {{argued that the}} concept of supernatural is relatively new, tied to the development of science and separation of supernatural—that which cannot be rationally explained—from natural, that which can. Thus, according to Durkheim, for early humans, everything was supernatural. Similarly, he points out that religions that give little importance to the concept of god exist, such as Buddhism, where the Four Noble Truths are much more important than any individual deity. With that, Durkheim argues, we are left with the following three concepts: the sacred (the ideas that cannot be properly explained, inspire awe and are considered worthy of spiritual respect or devotion), the beliefs and practices (which create highly emotional state—collective effervescence—and invest symbols with sacred importance), and the moral community (a group of people sharing a common moral philosophy). Out of those three concepts, Durkheim focused on the sacred, noting that it is at <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>core</b> of a religion. He defined sacred things as: ...|$|E

2500|$|As {{outlined}} above, {{representatives of}} the populares faction tried to question {{the validity of the}} decree over the entire course of its 90-year existence, without success. Among them, one of the strongest opponents was Julius Caesar, who did not put the decree into question altogether, but its ability to override the popular rights of intercessio and provocatio. He was later able to use this stance as an excuse to bring about the Civil War that would bring him the dictatorship, a reminiscence of the exact institution the SCU had once replaced. In summary, the SCU constituted an emergency decree with which the consuls, backed by the senate, were able to [...] "claim dictatorial force". As with the dictatorship before, no positive action necessarily followed from the passing of the decree. The SCU could however be perceived as favourable to a dictator considering the Roman constitution, since it distributed power only to the highest elected officials and followed the principle of collegiality. Unlike the dictatorship, the SCU was used almost exclusively in domestic conflicts. The debate over its legality continues in the research literature. Some - like Theodor Mommsen and Andrew Lintott - follow Cicero in describing the decree {{as a consequence of the}} Roman principle of [...] "self-help" [...] and therefore trace its legality to <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>core</b> of the Roman constitution.

John Markoff, a sociologist at the University of Pittsburgh, also notes that political developments, particularly in the advancement of democracy, originate in the semi-periphery. He notes that innovations in democracy came from the semi-periphery rather than the more established, stable core nations, where profit discourages great reform, or the extremely poor periphery where instability makes reform too dangerous to attempt. It has been within semi-peripheral nations where democratic reforms like the expansion of suffrage and the institution of the secret ballot have been implemented.|$|R
