500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Today the Sun's on Us" [...] was filmed in Iceland. The video begins with Ellis-Bextor, {{wearing a black}} dress and short hair, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> her {{on-screen}} boyfriend, who is sending text messages through his phone. Later, she plays a sudoku game on a computer however her boyfriend makes her leave. He starts browsing through pictures {{of a man and}} a woman kissing, who are later seen by Ellis-Bextor and her boyfriend through the window of the hotel room. The following day, they start following the recently-arrived couple, and at night, in the hotel restaurant, Ellis-Bextor manages to steal the couple's room key and breaks into the room. She steals money from a safe in the room, while in the restaurant, her boyfriend looks at the other couple repeatedly. She and her boyfriend pack and leave the hotel, and the latter gets angry when he learns that Ellis-Bextor has stolen from the couple. She decides to abandon their car, and, seemingly angry as well, goes near a cliff. The visual ends with him trying to comfort Ellis-Bextor, hugging her.|$|E

500|$|In 2012, Hawke {{entered the}} horror genre {{for the first}} time, by playing a true crime writer in Scott Derrickson's Sinister, which grossed US$87million at the {{worldwide}} box office—the film {{was the first in}} a series of highly profitable films for Hawke after the start of the new decade. In the week prior to the US opening of Sinister, Hawke explained that he was previously turned off by horror because good acting is not always required for success; however, the producer of Sinister, Jason Blum, who formerly ran a theater company with Hawke, made the offer to the actor based on the character and director."when I was younger, I ran a theater company with this guy, Jason Blum. And he loved horror movies and he went on to create his own little subgenre with [...] "Paranormal Activity." [...] And he kept <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> me about how I should love this whole genre. And I told him: I've never had a script with a really great character and a real filmmaker attached to it that I'd be interested in. So, he brought me into it.|$|E

2500|$|A {{present perfect}} also exists (normally called pretérito perfeito composto), {{but it has}} a very {{restricted}} use, denoting an action or a series of actions which began in the past and are expected to continue into the future, but will stop soon. For instance, the meaning of [...] "Tenho tentado falar com ela" [...] may be closer to [...] "I have been <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> her" [...] than to [...] "I have tried to talk to her", in some contexts.|$|E

2500|$|The {{present perfect}} has an {{iterative}} sense {{unique to the}} Galician-Portuguese language group. It denotes an action or a series of actions {{that began in the}} past and are expected to keep repeating in the future. For instance, the sentence Tenho tentado falar com ela would be translated to [...] "I have been <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> her", not [...] "I have tried to talk to her". On the other hand, the correct translation of the question [...] "Have you heard the latest news?" [...] is not *Tem ouvido a última notícia?, but Ouviu a última notícia?, since no repetition is implied.|$|E
2500|$|On October 11, the Associated Press {{reported}} that North Korea had threatened war if attempts {{would be made}} to penalize them through further sanctions. [...] This statement occurred even as Japan moved to tighten sanctions on the country. South Korea said they were ensuring their troops were prepared for nuclear war. [...] A U.S. Army major, stationed along the border between North and South Korea, said that the overall situation was [...] "calm" [...] but that [...] "Communist troops were more boldly trying to provoke their southern counterparts: spitting across the demarcation line, making throat-slashing hand gestures, flashing their middle fingers and <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> the troops." ...|$|E

60|$|And suddenly--as {{years before}} in a Paris music hall--there leapt to life within Joan's brain a little impish {{creature}} that took possession of her. She hoped the miracle would not happen.

6000|$|... "The joke of it is," [...] he said, [...] "I've been {{followed}} {{all the way}} here.

60|$|Next came rumours {{that even}} the Nunnery itself was haunted, {{especially}} the chapel.

60|$|Nobody {{seemed to}} want {{anything}} to do with the lad--thinking him the son of a forger, and possibly a suicide. Some <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him, but when they mentioned the supposed guilt of his parent, he flew into a rage.|$|R
