5|$|A {{controversy}} that has occupied scholars {{for more than}} a century concerns whether Cabral's discovery was by chance or intentional. If the latter, that would mean that the Portuguese had at least some hint that a land existed to the west. <b>The</b> <b>matter</b> <b>was</b> first raised by Emperor Pedro II in 1854 during a session of the Brazilian Historic and Geographic Institute, when he asked if the discovery might have been intentional.|$|E
5|$|After his release, Money {{immediately}} {{spoke to}} his official contacts, {{and the next morning}} <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>was</b> raised in the House of Commons. It was suggested that the police evidence was perjured, and as a result the Home Secretary William Joynson-Hicks instructed Sir Archibald Bodkin, the Director of Public Prosecutions, to investigate the possibility of perjury. Bodkin had the Metropolitan Police Commissioner appoint Chief Inspector Collins, one of his most experienced CID officers, to investigate the claims and interview Savidge.|$|E

The police investigation into <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>was</b> closed the same month.|$|E

5|$|France's {{intervention}} in the coup was openly applauded by the Central African Republic, Chad, Côte d'Ivoire, Madagascar, Niger, and Upper Volta. In fact, France was barely criticised at all in Africa, other than a mild response by Dahomey and one by the Democratic Republic of Congo. <b>The</b> <b>matter</b> <b>was</b> not discussed at the next meeting of the Council of Ministers of the OAU, held on 24 February–29 February in Lagos.

5|$|In 1741 Adam {{was forced}} to {{initiate}} legal proceedings against William, Lord Braco, to retrieve unpaid fees arising from his work at Duff House.

Adam sued for £5,796 12s 11⅓d, and <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>was</b> initially resolved in his favour.

5|$|In Australia, however, {{public opinion}} about <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>was</b> divided with many Australians {{opposed to the}} issue on moral grounds, feeling that the {{situation}} was not desperate enough to require such a drastic measure, while others felt it {{necessary in order to}} achieve final victory. The Hughes Labor government decided to hold a plebiscite on the matter and on 28 October 1916 <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>was</b> decided by a narrow margin of 51 per cent to 49 per cent, with the no vote prevailing. Despite the result, the issue split the Labor Party and the pro-conscription prime minister, Billy Hughes, ultimately left the party and joined with members of the opposition that supported conscription to form a new party, known as the Nationalist Party.|$|E

In addition, during a couple of instances {{between the end of}} the Second Punic War in 201 BC {{and the beginning of the}} Social War in 91 BC, although they had no legal power to do so, several Consuls were known to have vetoed acts of the Senate. Ultimately, if there was no veto, and <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>was</b> of minor importance, it could be voted on by a voice vote or by a show of hands. If there was no veto, and <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>was</b> of a significant nature, there was usually a physical division of the house, where senators voted by taking a place on either side of the chamber.|$|E

Colombia, however, declined to ratify the treaties, and after the 1912 elections, Knox offered $10 million to the Colombians (later raised to $25 million). The Colombians felt the amount inadequate, and requested arbitration; <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>was</b> not settled under the Taft administration.|$|E
5|$|A $30,000 supersedeas bond {{was issued}} in August 1965 as the United Bond Insurance Company {{continued}} to dispute {{the payment of}} Kinne's original $25,000 bond. The supersedeas bond allowed the company to defer payment of the $25,000 bond until a ruling on <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>was</b> handed down by the Missouri Supreme Court, but when that court upheld the bond's forfeiture, the $25,000 was paid to the State of Missouri in October 1965.

Nasser gave each of the provinces two vice-presidents: Boghdadi and Amer in Egypt, and Sabri al-Asali and Akram al-Hawrani in Syria. Nasser then left for Moscow to meet with Nikita Khrushchev. At the meeting, Khrushchev pressed Nasser to lift the ban on the Communist Party, but Nasser refused, stating it was an internal matter which was not a subject of discussion with outside powers. Khrushchev was reportedly taken aback and denied he had meant to interfere in the UAR's affairs. <b>The</b> <b>matter</b> <b>was</b> settled as both leaders sought to prevent a rift between their two countries.|$|E
