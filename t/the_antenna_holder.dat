50|$|<b>The</b> actual <b>antenna</b> {{which is}} {{transmitting}} the original wave then also may receive a strong signal {{from its own}} image from the ground. This will induce an additional current in <b>the</b> <b>antenna</b> element, changing <b>the</b> current at the feedpoint for a given feedpoint voltage. Thus <b>the</b> <b>antenna's</b> impedance, given by the ratio of feedpoint voltage to current, is altered due to <b>the</b> <b>antenna's</b> proximity to <b>the</b> ground. This can be quite a significant effect when <b>the</b> <b>antenna</b> is within a wavelength {{or two of the}} ground. But as <b>the</b> <b>antenna</b> height is increased, the reduced power of the reflected wave (due to the inverse square law) allows <b>the</b> <b>antenna</b> to approach its asymptotic feedpoint impedance given by theory. At lower heights, the effect on <b>the</b> <b>antenna's</b> impedance is very sensitive to the exact distance from the ground, as this affects the phase of the reflected wave relative to the currents in <b>the</b> <b>antenna.</b> Changing <b>the</b> <b>antenna's</b> height by a quarter wavelength, then changes the phase of the reflection by 180°, with a completely different effect on <b>the</b> <b>antenna's</b> impedance.|$|R

As a result, energy transfer from the generator to the an-tenna is maximized, which in turn maximizes the energy radiated by <b>the</b> <b>antenna</b> into <b>the</b> ground for different antenna elevations and soil types. <b>The</b> <b>antenna</b> {{is based on a}} wire bow-tie structure with variable flare angle for adjusting <b>the</b> <b>antenna’s</b> input impedance. <b>The</b> flare angle variation is realized by short-circuiting the gaps separating the wires from the feed point of <b>the</b> <b>antenna,</b> for which electronic switching devices such as PIN diodes could be used to allow fast and convenient control of <b>the</b> <b>antenna’s</b> flare angle.

50|$|Very {{close to}} <b>the</b> <b>antenna,</b> in <b>the</b> {{reactive}} region, {{energy of a}} certain amount, if not absorbed by a receiver, is held back and is stored very near <b>the</b> <b>antenna</b> surface. This energy is carried {{back and forth from}} <b>the</b> <b>antenna</b> to <b>the</b> reactive near field by electromagnetic radiation of the type that slowly changes electrostatic and magnetostatic effects. For example, current flowing in <b>the</b> <b>antenna</b> creates a purely magnetic component in the near field, which then collapses as <b>the</b> <b>antenna</b> current begins to reverse, causing transfer of the field's magnetic energy back to electrons in <b>the</b> <b>antenna</b> as <b>the</b> changing magnetic field causes a self-inductive effect on <b>the</b> <b>antenna</b> that generated it. This returns energy to <b>the</b> <b>antenna</b> in a regenerative way, so that it is not lost. A similar process happens as electric charge builds up in one section of <b>the</b> <b>antenna</b> under <b>the</b> pressure of the signal voltage, and causes a local electric field around that section of <b>antenna,</b> due to <b>the</b> <b>antenna's</b> self-capacitance. When <b>the</b> signal reverses so that charge is allowed to flow away from this region again, the built-up electric field assists in pushing electrons back in the new direction of their flow, as with the discharge of any unipolar capacitor.
