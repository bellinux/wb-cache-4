50|$|In {{the early}} days, {{critical}} loads were often calculated {{as a single}} value, e.g. critical load of acidity. Today a two-dimensional critical load function is often calculated, with the x-axis as N-deposition and the y-axis as S-deposition. The critical loads concept is a steady-state concept and that it therefore includes no information whatsoever regarding {{how long it takes}} before effects are visible. A simplified illustration of dynamic aspects is the <b>target</b> <b>load</b> function, which is the load at which the chemical criterion recovers before a chosen year, the target year. Thus, for target years in the near future the <b>target</b> <b>load</b> function is lower than the critical load and for target years in the distant future the <b>target</b> <b>load</b> function approaches the critical load function.|$|E

40|$|With the {{proliferation}} of various electronic and electrical devices, IEMI has become a critical issue that may severely threaten the modern society. For practical protection considerations, {{it is crucial to}} comprehensively evaluate the potential damages resulted by IEMI. The major objective of this thesis is to study the impacts of IEMI on the <b>targeted</b> <b>load</b> in complex networks. More exactly, with respect to certain IEMI, the characteristics of the resulting frequency response on the <b>targeted</b> <b>load</b> are studied, and the effects of network configurations, i. e., the attribute of load impedances, lengths of lines, parameters of disturbance source, location of source and network structures, are also investigated. First, we developed a novel efficient method to solve the frequency response, which is applicable for arbitrary networks. The key idea is decomposing the whole complex network into multiple equivalent units, and performing a recursive approach to efficiently compute the frequency response without losing the precision. Subsequently, we studied the periodicity of the load response in the frequency domain. Starting with a simple network, we derived and verified the period of the frequency response. During the study, the periodicity with respect to load and media was discussed. Furthermore, with respect to five important time-domain norms, i. e., time-domain peak, total signal energy, peak signal power, peak time rate of change, and peak time integral of the pulse, we considered a parameterized ultra-wideband (UWB) transient as the disturbance source, and thoroughly studied its impacts on the <b>targeted</b> <b>load</b> regarding network configurations, which include load impedance, the lengths of lines and parameters of the UWB transient. Finally, we adopted a statistical approach to investigate the receptivity at the <b>targeted</b> <b>load</b> in a network. Via complementary cumulative distribution function, the stochastic IEMI and its effects on the <b>targeted</b> <b>load</b> were studied. Moreover, by statistical approach, we also investigated how the network structure affects the frequency response of the <b>targeted</b> <b>load.</b> The results give suggestions on how to protect the <b>targeted</b> <b>load</b> by varying network structures.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} whether patients load the operated leg at a prescribed weight-bearing <b>target</b> <b>load</b> during postoperative recovery. DESIGN: A descriptive prospective study. SETTING: Orthopedic clinic and patients' homes. PARTICIPANTS: Fifty {{patients who had}} undergone total hip arthroplasty (THA) with trochanteric osteotomy. INTERVENTION: Patients were verbally instructed by a physical therapist to perform partial weight bearing at a 10 % body weight (BW) <b>target</b> <b>load</b> (n= 33) or at a 50 % BW <b>target</b> <b>load</b> (n= 17). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mean peak load (%BW) and percentage of patients and mean percentage of steps below, equal to, and above the <b>target</b> <b>load.</b> Weight bearing was measured when patients walked with (condition 1) and without (condition 2) a physical therapist {{in the hospital and}} walked at home (condition 3). RESULTS: The mean peak load was significantly higher than the target in the 10 % BW group for all 3 conditions (condition 1, 19. 2 % BW; condition 2, 20. 0 % BW; condition 3, 26. 8 % BW). In the 50 % BW group, the mean peak load was significantly lower than the target in conditions 1 (28. 1 % BW) and 2 (32. 5 % BW). No significant difference in weight bearing was found when walking with or without a physical therapist (change in 10 % BW, - 0. 1 % BW; change in 50 % BW, - 3. 17 % BW). At home, the mean peak load was significantly larger compared with walking without a physical therapist in the hospital (change in 10 % BW, - 7. 0 % BW; change in 50 % BW, - 11. 5 % BW). CONCLUSIONS: Partial weight bearing at a specific <b>target</b> <b>load</b> was not achieved by patients with a THA when given verbal instructions. Especially when using a low <b>target</b> <b>load</b> and when walking at home with no supervision of a physical therapist, patients loaded the operated leg higher and more frequently above the <b>target</b> <b>load.</b> Other training methods (eg, biofeedback) have to be evaluated to use as training tools for partial weight bearing at specific target loads...|$|E

30|$|As location-based {{services}} (LBSs) become attractive {{services and}} are expected to be widely used, we need to directly use location information to provide service differentiation and/or fairness for them, which is completely different from existing per-station and per-flow service differentiation. In this paper, we have introduced per-location <b>target</b> <b>load</b> in order to support location-based service differentiation, then devised <b>Target</b> <b>Load</b> Estimator (TaLE) to determine current per-location <b>target</b> <b>load,</b> and finally proposed a TaLE-based framework of QoS provisioning in IEEE 802.11 -based Hot Spot networks. In the TaLE-based framework, the AP keeps track of current per-location load diverged from a given per-location share of link capacity and its contribution to current network-wide load, and it feedbacks the load information to traffic senders. Based on the load information, each traffic sender adjusts its sending rate. We have implemented the proposed framework in ns- 2 simulator, and we carried out an extensive set of simulations to evaluate its performance with respect to fairness and service differentiation. The simulation results have indicated that the proposed TaLE-based framework can successfully support both the per-location fairness and service differentiation, irrespective of the number of stations per location, station mobility, the number of flows per station, traffic types, and any combination thereof.|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{describes}} {{the results of}} an experimental and numerical investigation on a composite laminated helicopter tailplane, whose lower panels are subjected to buckling phenomena during the life envelope. The structure is made of carbon fabric, carbon unidirectional and honeycomb. Two different types of lower laminate composite panels are investigated: Z stringer-stiffened panels and L stringer-stiffened panels. During the tests, the applied load is measured using a load cell, the displacement of the tailplane ends using potentiometers and the panels strains using strain gauges. Moire' fringes are installed to highlight the panels deformation in {{the lower part of the}} structure. At the beginning three Z stringer-stiffened and three L stringer-stiffened laminate composite lower panels are tested until 85 % of the <b>target</b> <b>load.</b> Then the last L stringer-stiffened panel is tested until collapse. The buckling load happens at 63 % of the <b>target</b> <b>load,</b> while the collapse happens at 90 %.
