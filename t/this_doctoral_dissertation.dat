The original {{title of this}} dissertation was La filosofia política i jurídica de Francesc Eiximenis (Francesc Eiximenis' Political and Legal Philosophy). It analyzes Francesc Eiximenis' works and thought from a social, political, economic and only in some respect, {{in spite of the}} title, legal point of view. It deals specially with the theological Franciscan thought and its presence in Eiximenis' work. It deals as well with eschatological matters and prophetism. <b>This</b> <b>doctoral</b> <b>dissertation</b> was published, with some additions, in 2004, now with the title of La Filosofia Social i Política de Francesc Eiximenis (Francesc Eiximenis' Social and Political Philosophy).It was reprinted in the review Estudios Franciscanos (Franciscan Studies) between 2006 and 2007 (with an enlargement of a short biography of Francesc Eiximenis).|$|E
40|$|The {{liberalisation}} of {{the wholesale}} electricity markets {{has been considered}} {{an efficient way to}} organise the markets. In Europe, the target is to liberalise and integrate the common European electricity markets. However, insufficient transmission capacity between the market areas hampers the integration, and therefore, new investments are required. Again, massive transmission capacity investments are not usually easy to carry through. <b>This</b> <b>doctoral</b> <b>dissertation</b> aims at elaborating on critical determinants required to deliver the necessary transmission capacity investments. The Nordic electricity market is used as an illustrative example. This study suggests that changes in the governance structure have affected the delivery of Nordic cross-border investments. In addition, the impacts of not fully delivered investments are studied in <b>this</b> <b>doctoral</b> <b>dissertation.</b> An insufficient transmission network can degrade the market uniformity and may also cause a need to split the market into smaller submarkets.

40|$|Cloud {{computing}} brings {{widely recognized}} benefits {{as well as}} new challenges and risks resulting mainly from the fact that cloud service provider is an external third party that provides public cloud services in multi-tenancy model. At present, widely accepted IT governance frameworks lack focus on cloud computing governance and do not fully address the requirements of cloud computing from cloud consumer viewpoint. Given the absence of any comprehensive cloud computing governance and management framework, <b>this</b> <b>doctoral</b> <b>dissertation</b> thesis focuses on specific aspects of cloud service governance and management from consumer perspective. The main aim of doctoral dissertation thesis is the design of methodological framework for cloud service governance and management (Cloud computing governance and management) from consumer point of view. Cloud consumer is considered as a medium or large-sized enterprise that uses services in public cloud computing model, which are offered and delivered by cloud service provider. Theoretical part of <b>this</b> <b>doctoral</b> <b>dissertation</b> thesis identifies the main theoretical concepts of IT governance, IT management and cloud computing (chapter 2). Analytical part of <b>this</b> <b>doctoral</b> <b>dissertation</b> thesis reviews the literature dealing with specifics of cloud services utilization and their impact on IT governance and IT management, cloud computing governance and cloud computing management (chapter 3). Further, existing IT governance and IT management frameworks (SOA Governance, COBIT, ITIL and MBI) were analysed and evaluated in terms of the use of cloud services from cloud consumer perspective (chapter 4). Scientific research was based on Design Science Research Methodology with intention to design and evaluate artifact methodological framework. The main part of <b>this</b> <b>doctoral</b> <b>dissertation</b> thesis proposes methodical framework Cloud computing governance and management based on SOA Governance, COBIT 5 and ITIL 2011 (chapter 5, 6 and 7). Verification of proposed methodical framework Cloud computing governance and management from cloud consumer perspective was based on scientific method of case study (chapter 8). The main objective of the case study was to evaluate and verify proposed methodical framework Cloud computing governance and management in a real business environment. The main contribution of <b>this</b> <b>doctoral</b> <b>dissertation</b> thesis is both the use of existing knowledge, approaches and methodologies in area of IT governance and IT management to design methodical framework Cloud computing governance and management and the extension of Management of Business Informatics (MBI) framework by a set of new tasks containing procedures and recommendations relating to adoption and utilization of cloud computing services...|$|E

40|$|Recently, {{there has}} been {{increased}} interest in understanding entanglement and quantum communication in black hole spacetimes and in using quantum information techniques to address questions in gravity. Studies on relativistic entanglement show the emergence of conceptually important qualitative differences to a non-relativistic treatment.

Relativisitic quantum information theory uses well-known tools coming from quantum information and quantum optics to study quantum effects provoked by gravity to learn information about the spacetime.

Precisely measurement allows efficient clinical assessment and evaluation of successful treatment. From the scientific aspect it’s important to collect all data which can be objectify clinical improvement of wound healing during the particular procedure. Primary goal of <b>this</b> <b>doctoral</b> <b>dissertations</b> is making the gold standard for estimation accuracy computer software for wound tissue analysis. Secondary goals are defining dataset for learning software classifier which will make automatic analysis of wound tissue and wound tissue represenrtation, based on digital photography of wound. In that order, measurements of subjective assessment represented tissue are done based on digital images of wound. Eight examiners were assessing representation tissue on 40 images of wounds in 5 occasions. Errors in subjective assessment amounted to 36 % in assessment fibrins, and to 28 % in assessment granulation. Objective measurements of the same images were done by experienced expert in 3 occasions. Mean measurement values were taken like objective values of tissue type and wound tissue representation. Objective measurements of wound tissue representation show the best accuracy, precision and reliability. Variation error was under 5 % of total variance. This created a golden standard for checking and testing of software for automatic differentiation and assessment of the presence of tissue in the wound based on digital images of the wound. Set for the test consists of 40 digital images of chronic wounds. For each image was calculated representation of all types of tissue. Estimated possible error is 5 %.

40|$|Brief is {{the flight}} of the {{brightest}} stars. In February 2008, we were struck by the sudden departure of our colleague and friend, Carlo Magi. His demise, {{at the age of}} 27, was not only a great personal shock for those who knew him, but also a loss for science. During his brief career in science, he displayed rare talent in both the development of mathematical theory as well as application of mathematical results in practical problems of speech science. Apart from mere technical contributions, Carlo was also a valuable and highly appreciated member of the research team. Among colleagues, he was well known for venturing into exciting philosophical discussions and his positive as well as passionate attitude was motivating for everyone around him. His contributions will be fondly remembered. Carlo’s work was tragically interrupted just a few months before the defence of his doctoral thesis. Shortly after Carlo’s passing, we realised that the thesis he was working on had to be finished. We, the colleagues of Carlo, did not have a choice, it was obvious to us that finishing his work was our obligation.

Examples of left-homogeneous spaces are spheres, Euclidean spaces, {{as well as}} hyperbolic spaces acted on by isometries; uniform tilings acted on by symmetries; vertex-transitive graphs, in particular, Cayley graphs, acted on by automorphisms; groups acting on themselves by multiplication; and integer lattices acted on by translations. For such automata and spaces, we prove, in particular, generalisations of topological and uniform variants of the Curtis-Hedlund-Lyndon theorem, of the Tarski-Følner theorem, and of the Garden-of-Eden theorem on the full shift and certain subshifts.

40|$|<b>This</b> <b>doctoral</b> <b>dissertation</b> aims {{to expand}} our {{knowledge}} of the socio-legal and administrative side of the Ptolemaic society (332 - 30 BC) through a study of the Ptolemaic petitioning system. Petitions are official documents through which (groups of) individuals address special requests to the authorities, mostly in relation to interpersonal conflicts: family disputes, official misconduct, violent crime, theft, etcetera. They constitute one of the best represented types of papyri from Ptolemaic Egypt (ca. 900 published texts) and offer a privileged insight into the daily problems and aspirations of life and the interactions between private persons and the authorities in this society. Despite their enormous potential for research, a recent survey of these documents is missing; <b>this</b> <b>doctoral</b> <b>dissertation</b> aims to fill that gap. Under Ptolemaic rule, three text formats were used to write petitions: the ἔντευξις, the ὑπόμνημα and the mḳmḳ. Most petitions are written in Greek (ἐντεύξεις and ὑπομνήματα), a smaller group in Demotic (mḳmḳ). All three formats were also used for communications with other purposes than petitioning, however. The core of <b>this</b> <b>doctoral</b> <b>dissertation</b> consists of an overview of all Ptolemaic ἐντεύξεις, ὑπομνήματα and mḳmḳ, both with and without petitioning function: lists of all examples of these types of texts and surveys of their addressees, form and content. Additionally, this dissertation discusses some specific topics related to Ptolemaic petitions and other ἐντεύξεις, ὑπομνήματα and mḳmḳ: the personal delivery of these documents to their addressee, the processing of petitions addressed to the king by government officials, and the relation between the ὑπόμνημα and the προσάγγελμα. In this way, this work provides a solid basis for further research regarding these intriguing documents. status: accepte...|$|E
