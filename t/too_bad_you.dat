Not have domestic partnerships; that's not acceptable. I don't believe for a moment [...] would destroy the sanctity of marriage. But let's just say for a moment that it does. Well, then the sanctity of marriage just has to be destroyed. It's just <b>too</b> <b>bad.</b> <b>You</b> can't have one set of benefits and only give them to some of the people." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Not yet. We {{can stand}} {{for another week}} or two if the wind's not <b>too</b> <b>bad.</b> Anyhow, <b>you</b> can find out whether Davies is {{inclined}} to trade." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am innocent--innocent as the babe unborn! Oh! Mr. Cary! this is <b>too</b> <b>bad</b> of <b>you,</b> sir!" [...] quoth Jack indignantly, while Amyas {{asked what}} was the matter.|$|R
6000|$|... "Randy Fairwell, at your service, sir. It's <b>too</b> <b>bad</b> <b>you</b> were wrecked, {{but you can}} {{be thankful}} your life was spared. Seen anybody around here since you've been ashore?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Fran, it was lovely!" [...] cried Cecilia. [...] "But I felt so sorry--why didn't {{you let me}} go to Ashland? It was <b>too</b> <b>bad</b> <b>you</b> missed it--and Sara Beaumont." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It's <b>too</b> <b>bad</b> <b>you</b> didn't {{get here}} before the train started," [...] he observed. [...] "If you had we might have nabbed that rascal and maybe got a reward," [...] and he smiled grimly.|$|E
6000|$|... "I say, you know, you there, I {{wish you}} wouldn't mind being quiet a bit. My wife says she can't get the {{children}} to sleep. It's <b>too</b> <b>bad,</b> <b>you</b> know, 'pon my word it is." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wish the}} Guard would come quick. <b>Too</b> <b>bad</b> <b>you</b> couldn't have sent word! I'd enjoy seeing Greaser swing. Say, he hasn't a {{ghost of a}} chance, with the President and Jim Williams after him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{heard it}} had been closed. <b>Too</b> <b>bad!</b> If <b>you</b> are going to Santa Barbara, you must call and see me by all means," [...] went on Bob Sutter.|$|R

6000|$|... "What's {{the good}} of that to ME?" [...] he cried, hitting his fist on the wall. Then he became plaintive. [...] "It's <b>too</b> <b>bad</b> of <b>you</b> to be ill. Little, it is--" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Read this letter, Tom. I {{should like}} to have seen the admiral's face, as he read my uncle's letter. But it is <b>too</b> <b>bad.</b> <b>You</b> see, I have {{regularly}} done for myself. I was to have stopped here till a year come Christmas, and now I have to leave at Michaelmas. I call it a beastly shame." ...|$|E
6000|$|Conrad replied softly: [...] "I know, I know! I {{just heard}} of it. <b>Too</b> <b>bad!</b> but <b>you</b> {{understand}} how it is. Herds get going that way, and you can't stop 'em nor head 'em off." ...|$|R

[...] "However, things will come all right at the nomination." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How could I? I was at {{the main}} rigging, looking {{to see if any}} more rain threatened. He must have left the wheel and crept behind me. I was holding on to a stay with one hand.

6000|$|... "In {{which case}} I reckon I'd {{have to hold}} you in my arms some more and sort of soothe you down," [...] he {{threatened}} back. [...] "And now I'm going to go.
