The South American clade is rooted by the maned wolf and bush dog, and the fox-like canids by the fennec fox and Blanford's fox. The grey fox and island fox are basal to the other clades; however, this topological difference is not strongly supported.|$|E

Another consequence was an expansion of freshwater environments, since continental runoff now had longer distances to travel before reaching oceans.

6000|$|I {{return to}} another of Mr. Douglas's excuses for the {{expenditures}} of 1838, {{at the same}} time announcing the pleasing intelligence that this is the last one.

Few words will settle this. First, that the <b>ten</b> <b>millions</b> appropriated was not made till 1839, and consequently could not have been expended in 1838; second, although it was appropriated, it has never been expended at all. Those who heard Mr. Douglas recollect that he indulged himself in a contemptuous expression of pity for me. [...] "Now he's got me," [...] thought I. But when {{he went on to say}} that five millions of the expenditure of 1838 were payments of the French indemnities, which I knew to be untrue; that five millions had been for the post-office, which I knew to be untrue; that <b>ten</b> <b>millions</b> had been for the Maine boundary war, which I not only knew to be untrue, but supremely ridiculous also; and when I saw that he was stupid enough to hope that I would permit such groundless and audacious assertions to go unexposed,--I readily consented that, on the score both of veracity and sagacity, the audience should judge whether he or I were the more deserving of the world's contempt.|$|R
