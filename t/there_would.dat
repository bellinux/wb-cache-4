60|$|Two lovers {{once upon}} a time had planned a little summer-house {{in the form of an}} antique temple which it was their purpose to consecrate to all manner of refined and {{innocent}} enjoyments. <b>There</b> they <b>would</b> hold pleasant intercourse with one another and the circle of their familiar friends; <b>there</b> they <b>would</b> give festivals of delicious fruit; <b>there</b> they <b>would</b> hear lightsome music intermingled with the strains of pathos which make joy more sweet; <b>there</b> they <b>would</b> read poetry and fiction and permit their own minds to flit away in day-dreams and romance; there, in short--for why should we shape out the vague sunshine of their hopes?--there all pure delights were to cluster like roses among the pillars of the edifice and blossom ever new and spontaneously.|$|R

5|$|At 09:45, the US Embassy closed. <b>There</b> <b>would</b> be no {{diplomatic}} {{relations between the}} US and Cambodia again until 11 November 1991. By 10:41 all the evacuees including Ambassador Dean and President Saukham Khoy had been lifted out by helicopters of HMH-462. Helicopters of HMH-463 operating from the USS Hancock then began to land to extract the ground security force.|$|E

60|$|It was a {{sufficiently}} naive way {{to account for}} a chastisement which had now strung out for ninety-six years. But nobody found fault with it.

5|$|B. Lance Armstrong was {{declared}} winner of seven consecutive Tours from 1999 to 2005.

The Tour director Christian Prudhomme had previously declared that if this happened, <b>there</b> <b>would</b> be no alternate winners for those years, but this has not yet been made official.|$|E
5|$|Because <b>there</b> <b>would</b> be {{only one}} chance {{to carry out the}} test correctly, Bainbridge decided that a {{rehearsal}} should be carried out to allow the plans and procedures to be verified, and the instrumentation to be tested and calibrated.

5|$|Donald Markwell {{argued that}} {{in the absence of}} such an {{international}} approach, <b>there</b> <b>would</b> be a risk of worsening international relations and possibly even world war arising from economic factors similar to those present during the depression of the 1930s.|$|E

5|$|During the 2015 Labour {{leadership}} election, Andy Burnham {{said that}} he would introduce a graduate tax to replace fees. He was ultimately unsuccessful in his bid for leadership.

5|$|Following the problem-ridden limited {{electronic}} voting experiment of the 2008 municipal elections, the Ministry of Justice announced in January 2010 that <b>there</b> <b>would</b> be no {{electronic voting}} at this time, {{but that the}} ministry would be monitoring the international arenas for development of online voting.|$|E

5|$|Fragments of Him {{originally}} {{stemmed from}} an idea developed at a game jam called the Ludum Dare. The game originally had players removing objects while {{the main character}} {{became more and more}} depressed. Mata Haggis, one of the developers of Fragments of Him, told the Rock, Paper, Shotgun blog that in the final version <b>there</b> <b>would</b> be more mechanics than just removing objects. He said that <b>there</b> <b>would</b> be some choices to be made, and that the story would branch off a little from the choices. The prototype of the game focused only on the boyfriend, while the full version was to include four different character perspectives. He described the gameplay style as a mix of Heavy Rain and Gone Home. Haggis told Nathan Grayson of the Kotaku blog that many of the objects in the game, such as hotels and parks, were based on his real-life experiences of when he lost a friend.|$|E
5|$|Games {{tended to}} be {{characterized}} by low scores and frequent punting, with crowds between 10,000 and 20,000; these numbers dropped off {{in the last two}} games of the era. A low scoring BC–Calgary game in Everett, Washington in 1967 drew just over 6,000; <b>there</b> <b>would</b> not be another CFL game in the United States until the cusp of US expansion itself in 1992.|$|E
5|$|Heisenberg's {{uncertainty}} principle predicts {{that during the}} inflationary phase <b>there</b> <b>would</b> be quantum thermal fluctuations, which would be magnified to cosmic scale.

5|$|In 1990, the MTA {{proposed}} a rail line connecting LaGuardia Airport and John F. Kennedy International Airport. The line would have operated over the Grand Central Parkway and the Van Wyck Expressway. <b>There</b> <b>would</b> be stations at Shea Stadium and Jamaica. The system was proposed to cost $2billion. The MTA {{estimated that the}} rail link would take 30minutes from Kennedy to LaGuardia, {{and the frequency of}} service would initially be every 15minutes. <b>There</b> <b>would</b> be a two-track alignment with one track for each direction, as well as at least two trains heading in each direction at all times. If the link were built, the average travel time from Manhattan to Kennedy would have been about 45minutes using the Long Island Rail Road, including transfers. To LaGuardia, the average travel time from the Grand Central station using the IRT Flushing Line would be 47minutes.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, Arsenal invited Galatasaray {{to compete}} at their annual Emirates Cup tournament.
