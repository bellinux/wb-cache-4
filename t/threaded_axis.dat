40|$|A {{woven fabric}} {{structure}} {{is defined by}} mutual threads interlacing in the fabric {{as well as the}} basic parameters of the fabric. The interrelation among fabric parameters can be obtained by considering a geometrical model of the fabric and specific experimental methods. The geometrical model is mainly concerned with the shape taken up by the yarn in the warp or weft cross-section of the fabric. This article provides a possible methodology for evaluation of geometric parameters of threads in the real longitudinal and transverse cross-sections of fabric. From an individual cross-section of the fabric using image analysis it is possible to define the diameter of threads, their deformation, thread spacing, the maximum displace-ment (height of binding wave) of the <b>thread</b> <b>axis,</b> the angle of the <b>thread</b> <b>axis</b> (interlacing angle), the length of the <b>thread</b> <b>axis</b> in the cross-section of the fabric, the crimp of threads in the fabric, and the real shape of the binding wave through wave coordinates. The pa-rameters mentioned are possible to use as input for mathematical modelling of the fabric structure and for prediction of mechanical and end-use properties of fabrics. Key words: fabric geometry, interlacing, cross-section, waviness, height, binding waves...|$|R

40|$|The mussel byssus is {{a unique}} {{holdfast}} structure employed by marine mussels to colonize diverse substrates. The byssus consists of extracellular threads with mainly proteinaceous components. Individual threads reveal high tensile strength at their distal end and high elasticity in their proximal portion. Our studies show that proteins of the distal part are oriented along the <b>thread</b> <b>axis</b> and are well-ordered with a high beta-structural content. In contrast, proteins of the proximal part are less ordered and are not as well-oriented with primarily alpha-helical structure. The detected differences in the structural features of the proteins along a byssus thread are likely an important basis for its gradual mechanical properties...|$|R
40|$|Measurement {{of thread}} {{surfaces}} accuracy {{is a subject}} of this investigation. The standard complex indicator of thread accuracy – the virtual pitch thread diameter (VPTD) is considered. The author previously developed and published the method of calculation of VPTD. This method is based on data, which are obtained from coordi-nate measuring machines (CMM). However, using this method the preliminary deter-mination of the <b>thread</b> <b>axis</b> position is assumed. Actually this case does not always occur in practice. This disadvantage limited the possibility of CMM application {{for the assessment of}} the thread accuracy significantly. Taking it into account, the additional method for the <b>thread</b> <b>axis</b> determination for the cases where the axis is located arbitrarily is offered in this article. This method includes two stages. One of them is based on the determination of average values of point cloud coordinates received from CMM. The second one is based on minimiza-tion (maximization) of objective function. The objective function, in turn, includes such parameters as parameters of thread location in CMM coordinate system. VPTD is used as the minimized (maximized) value. The concerned method is confirmed by computer calculations, which show sufficient reliability and «robust » algorithm of the accepted approach. Calculations were done with point cloud calculated theoretically by using other computer program, and also with points that were received from CMM in real mea-surement. This investigation determined sufficient minimum number of points to ob-tain the reliable result at the first most effective stage of the method. Thus, the research showed that for VPTD assessment the earlier offered method and the additional new method gives a possibility to use CMM instead of using gauges...|$|R

40|$|Transverse {{oscillations}} {{of solar}} filament and prominence threads have been frequently reported. These oscillations have the common features of being of short period (2 - 10 min) and being damped {{after a few}} periods. Kink magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wave modes have been proposed as responsible for the observed oscillations, whereas resonant absorption in the Alfven continuum and ion-neutral collisions are the best candidates to be the damping mechanisms. Here, we study both analytically and numerically the time damping of kink MHD waves in a cylindrical, partially ionized filament thread embedded in a coronal environment. The thread model is composed of a straight and thin, homogeneous filament plasma, with a transverse inhomogeneous transitional layer where the plasma physical properties vary continuously from filament to coronal conditions. The magnetic field is homogeneous and parallel to the <b>thread</b> <b>axis.</b> We find that the kink mode is efficiently damped by resonant absorption for typical wavelengths of filament oscillations, the damping times being compatible with the observations. Partial ionization {{does not affect the}} process of resonant absorption, and the filament plasma ionization degree is only important for the damping for wavelengths much shorter than those observed. To our knowledge, {{this is the first time}} that the phenomenon of resonant absorption is studied in a partially ionized plasma. Comment: Submitted in Ap...|$|R

50|$|It is a {{screw set}} into the {{breechblock}} that has a section of <b>thread</b> along its <b>axis</b> removed. The screw is mated with a partially threaded hole {{at the rear of}} the weapon's chamber: threadless channels in the breechblock screw line up with threadless channels in the breech, and vice versa. The screw can thus be smoothly inserted all the way into the gun, after which as little as one-sixth of a turn can engage the two sets of threads securely, sealing the breech. Interrupted screws are occasionally seen in loose gunpowder rifles, as this mechanism was historically one of the few practical ways to achieve a gas-proof seal with a breech-loading firearm that does not employ cartridges. An earlier method was the use of a wedge to block the rear of the gun.|$|R
40|$|The volume phase {{transition}} of slide-ring gels with freely-movable cross-linking junctions was investigated. Ionic chemical gels with fixed cross-linking junctions undergo volume {{phase transition}}s {{when they have}} higher than the critical degree of ionization. However, the experimentally-observed critical ionization value for slide-ring gels {{is much higher than}} theoretical values for chemical gels. This difference indicates that the volume phase transition is significantly suppressed in slide-ring gels. The mesoscale structure at various swollen or shrunken states was also investigated by small angle X-ray scattering. Changes in the scattering patterns with shrinking slide-ring gels suggest microphase separation due to the sliding of cyclic molecules <b>threaded</b> along the <b>axis</b> of the polymer chains, which may suppress the volume phase transition. In addition, slide-ring gels absorbed/desorbed greater than equilibrium volumes in the shrinking/swelling processes and showed slow dynamics; these observations are also related to their sliding properties...|$|R
40|$|Formed through {{magnetic}} field shearing and reconnection {{in the solar}} corona, magnetic flux ropes are structures of twisted {{magnetic field}}, <b>threaded</b> along an <b>axis.</b> Their evolution and potential eruption are of great importance for space weather. Here we describe a new methodology for the automated detection of flux ropes in simulated magnetic fields, based on fieldline helicity. More robust than previous methods, it also allows the full volume extent of each flux rope structure to be determined. Our Flux Rope Detection and Organization (FRoDO) code is publicly available, and measures the magnetic flux and helicity content of pre-erupting flux ropes over time, as well as detecting eruptions. As a first demonstration the code {{is applied to the}} output from a time-dependent magnetofrictional model, spanning 1996 June 15 - 2014 February 10. Over this period, 1561 erupting and 2099 non-erupting magnetic flux ropes are detected, tracked, and characterized. For this particular model data, erupting flux ropes have a mean net helicity magnitude of (2. 66 ± 6. 82) × 10 ^ 43 Mx^ 2, while non-erupting flux ropes have a significantly lower mean of (4. 04 ± 9. 25) × 10 ^ 42 Mx^ 2, although there is overlap between the two distributions. Similarly, the mean unsigned magnetic flux for erupting flux ropes is (4. 04 ± 6. 17) × 10 ^ 21 Mx, significantly higher than the mean value of (7. 05 ± 16. 8) × 10 ^ 20 Mx for non-erupting ropes. These values for erupting flux ropes are within the broad range expected from observational and theoretical estimates, although the eruption rate in this particular model is lower than that of observed coronal mass ejections. In future the FRoDO code will prove a valuable tool for assessing the performance of different non-potential coronal simulations and comparing them with observations.
