5|$|As {{described}} above, John Scannella {{had argued}} in 2010 that Nedoceratops {{should be considered}} a synonym of Triceratops. Andrew Farke (2011) maintained that it represents a valid distinct genus. Nick Longrich agreed with Scannella about Nedoceratops and made a further suggestion: that the recently described Ojoceratops was likewise a synonym. The fossils, he argued, are indistinguishable from <b>the</b> <b>T.</b> horridus specimens that were previously attributed to the defunct species T. serratus.|$|E

5|$|Helper T cells express T {{cell receptors}} (TCR) that {{recognize}} antigen bound to Class II MHC molecules. The MHC:antigen complex is also {{recognized by the}} helper cell's CD4 co-receptor, which recruits molecules inside <b>the</b> <b>T</b> cell (e.g., Lck) {{that are responsible for}} <b>the</b> <b>T</b> cell's activation. Helper T cells have a weaker association with the MHC:antigen complex than observed for killer T cells, meaning many receptors (around 200–300) on the helper T cell must be bound by an MHC:antigen in order to activate the helper cell, while killer T cells can be activated by engagement of a single MHC:antigen molecule. Helper T cell activation also requires longer duration of engagement with an antigen-presenting cell. The activation of a resting helper T cell causes it to release cytokines that influence the activity of many cell types. Cytokine signals produced by helper T cells enhance the microbicidal function of macrophages and the activity of killer T cells. In addition, helper T cell activation causes an upregulation of molecules expressed on <b>the</b> <b>T</b> cell's surface, such as CD40 ligand (also called CD154), which provide extra stimulatory signals typically required to activate antibody-producing B cells.|$|E

5|$|With time, {{the idea}} that the differing skulls might be {{representative}} of individual variation within one (or two) species gained popularity. In 1986, Ostrom and Wellnhofer published a paper in which they proposed that there was only one species, Triceratops horridus. Part of their rationale was that generally there are only one or two species of any large animal in a region (modern examples being the elephant and the giraffe in modern Africa). To their findings, Lehman added the old Lull-Sternberg lineages combined with maturity and sexual dimorphism, suggesting that <b>the</b> <b>T.</b> horridus-T. prorsus-T. brevicornus lineage was composed of females, the T.calicornis-T.elatus lineage was made up of males, and <b>the</b> <b>T.</b> obtusus-T. hatcheri lineage was of pathologic old males. His reasoning was that males had taller, more erect horns and larger skulls, and females had smaller skulls with shorter, forward-facing horns.|$|E
5|$|After the {{processed}} antigen (peptide) is complexed to the MHC molecule, {{they both}} migrate together {{to the cell}} membrane, where they are exhibited (elaborated) as a complex that can be recognized by the CD 4+ (T helper cell)– a type of white blood cell. This is known as antigen presentation. However, the epitopes (conformational epitopes) that are recognized by the B cell prior to their digestion {{may not be the}} same as that presented to <b>the</b> <b>T</b> helper cell. Additionally, a B cell may present different peptides complexed to different MHC-II molecules.|$|E

40|$|For the {{inhibition}} of T-lymphocyte proliferation in mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) by in vivo alloantigen-induced specific T-suppressor cells (<b>Ts),</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ts</b> and responder cells must have {{major histocompatibility complex}} (MHC) class II identity, either in I-C or in I-A + I-E. In the case of I-C, the molecule is {{on the surface of}} <b>the</b> <b>Ts</b> and not {{on the surface of the}} stimulator or responder cells. This lack of I-C on the responder cells occurs even after pre-activation by antigen. I-J on <b>the</b> <b>Ts</b> is unimportant in the present system. By blocking <b>the</b> <b>Ts</b> surface molecules with antibody, it was shown that <b>the</b> two <b>Ts</b> genetic restrictions were due to distinct Ts subsets, bearing I-C in one case and I-A + I-E in the other. Pretreatment of <b>the</b> <b>Ts</b> with anti-I-C antibodies (without complement) did not prevent specific <b>Ts</b> binding to <b>the</b> alloantigen, as shown by absorption on monolayers. However, it blocked the ability of <b>the</b> <b>Ts</b> to cause suppression and this could be reversed by removal of the antibody with pronase. The responder population, when pre-activated, could be fractionated by absorbing on monolayers of syngeneic Ts. Under these conditions, the cells sensitive to suppression adhered to the monolayer, while the non-adherent cell could not be suppressed. It is proposed that a receptor, to an Ia molecule (I-C or I-A + I-E) of <b>the</b> <b>Ts,</b> appears on <b>the</b> surface of <b>the</b> pre-activated responder <b>T</b> cell and that this is required for the genetically restricted interaction between the responder cell and <b>the</b> <b>Ts...</b>|$|R
