5|$|The {{area around}} Licancabur was first settled by the Atacameno people, presumably {{because of the}} water in local canyons. <b>The</b> <b>Incas,</b> under Yawar Waqaq, were {{followed}} by the Spanish during the early 16th century in the region; both were looking for yareta and chinchillas.|$|E
5|$|Aveni {{states that}} one of the {{strengths}} of the Brown methodology is that it can explore astronomies invisible to statistical analysis and offers the astronomy of <b>the</b> <b>Incas</b> as another example. The empire of <b>the</b> <b>Incas</b> was conceptually divided using ceques radial routes emanating from the capital at Cusco. Thus there are alignments in all directions which would suggest there is little of astronomical significance, However, ethnohistorical records show that the various directions do have cosmological and astronomical significance with various points in the landscape being significant at different times of the year. In eastern Asia archaeoastronomy has developed from the History of Astronomy and much archaeoastronomy is searching for material correlates of the historical record. This is due to the rich historical record of astronomical phenomena which, in China, stretches back into the Han dynasty, in the second century BC.|$|E
60|$|<b>THE</b> <b>INCA.</b> How {{can he be}} mad, madam? What is sanity? The {{condition}} of <b>the</b> <b>Inca's</b> mind. What is madness? The {{condition of}} the people who disagree with <b>the</b> <b>Inca.</b>|$|R
60|$|<b>THE</b> <b>INCA.</b> I repeat, grossly overrated. Strictly between ourselves, I do {{not believe}} all this about Providence entrusting the care of sixty million human beings to the {{abilities}} of Chips and the Piffler and Jack Johnson. I believe in individual genius. That is <b>the</b> <b>Inca's</b> secret. It must be. Why, hang it all, madam, {{if it were a}} mere family matter, <b>the</b> <b>Inca's</b> uncle would have been as great a man as <b>the</b> <b>Inca.</b> And--well, everybody knows what <b>the</b> <b>Inca's</b> uncle was.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Inca</b> Army was a {{multi-ethnic}} army {{charged with}} defending {{the sovereignty of}} <b>the</b> <b>Inca</b> empire.|$|R
5|$|Faced {{with these}} constraints, the Spanish {{expedition}} {{had to cross}} the river several times and fight at each ford against stiff opposition. The bulk of the Inca army confronted the Spaniards from a set of terraces overlooking a plain by the Urubamba River. Several Spanish assaults against the terraces failed against a shower of arrows, slingshots and boulders {{coming down from the}} terraces as well as from both flanks. To hinder the efforts of the Spanish cavalry <b>the</b> <b>Incas</b> flooded the plain using previously prepared channels; water eventually reached the horses' girths. The defenders then counterattacked; some of them used Spanish weapons captured in previous encounters such as swords, bucklers, armor and even a horse, ridden by Manco Inca himself. In a severely compromised situation, Hernando Pizarro ordered a retreat; under the cover of darkness the Spanish force fled through the Urubamba valley with <b>the</b> <b>Incas</b> in pursuit and reached Cusco the next day.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Incas</b> {{arranged}} their empire {{to demonstrate}} their cosmology. The capital, Cusco, was at {{the centre of the}} empire and connected to it by means of ceques, conceptually straight lines radiating out from the centre. These ceques connected the centre of the empire to the four suyus, which were regions defined by their direction from Cusco. The notion of a quartered cosmos is common across the Andes. Gary Urton, who has conducted fieldwork in the Andean villagers of Misminay, has connected this quartering with the appearance of the Milky Way in the night sky. In one season it will bisect the sky and in another bisect it in a perpendicular fashion.|$|E
50|$|When {{encountered}} by <b>the</b> Spanish, <b>the</b> <b>Inca</b> Empire supplied tampu (inns) along <b>the</b> <b>Inca</b> road system with llama ch'arki for travelers. <b>The</b> <b>Inca</b> used a freeze drying process that {{took advantage of}} their cold dry mountain air and strong sun.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Inca</b> Empire invaded Pachacamac {{and took}} over the site around 1470. For <b>the</b> <b>Inca,</b> Pachacamac was {{extremely}} important to religion {{as well as an}} important administration center. When <b>the</b> <b>Inca</b> started their conquest, they had their own creation god, Viracocha. However, out of respect for the religion of their conquered people, <b>the</b> <b>Inca</b> entered Pacha Kamaq into their religion, but Pacha Kamaq and Viracocha were not equals, Viracocha was believed to be more powerful. Still, Pachacamac was allowed an unusual amount of independence from <b>the</b> <b>Inca</b> Empire ...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Inca</b> {{society was}} <b>the</b> society of <b>the</b> <b>Inca</b> civilization in South America. <b>The</b> <b>Inca</b> Empire, which was centred {{in what is}} now called Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador and {{southern}} Colombia and lasted from 1438 to 1533 AD, represented the height of this civilization. <b>The</b> <b>Inca</b> state was known as the Kingdom of Cusco before 1438. Over the course of <b>the</b> <b>Inca</b> Empire, <b>the</b> rulers used conquest and peaceful assimilation to incorporate in their empire a large portion of western South America, centred on the Andean mountain ranges. The empire proved relatively short-lived however: by 1533, Atahualpa, <b>the</b> last Sapa <b>Inca</b> (emperor) of <b>the</b> <b>Inca</b> Empire, was killed on the orders of the conquistador Francisco Pizarro, marking the beginning of Spanish rule. <b>The</b> last <b>Inca</b> stronghold, <b>the</b> Neo-Inca State in Vilcabamba was conquered by the Spanish in 1572.|$|R
5|$|In 1981, Harries left Granada {{and moved}} into {{freelance}} producing and directing. He directed the documentary series Africa in 1984 before beginning a collaboration with Paul Yule, with whom he made four films in Peru between 1985 and 1989—Martin Chambi and the Heirs of <b>the</b> <b>Incas,</b> Our God the Condor, Iquitos, and Mario Vargas Llosa: The Novelist Who Would Be President—and working on editions of The South Bank Show and Arena. While directing a corporate video for BT he met Jonathan Ross, who was his assistant for the day. Ross invited Harries to direct a pilot for a chat show he and Alan Marke had developed {{that was based on}} Late Night with David Letterman. The pilot was a success and Ross found a television audience with The Last Resort with Jonathan Ross, which first aired in 1988.|$|E
5|$|There are no {{credible}} {{descriptions of}} smallpox-like {{disease in the}} Americas before the westward exploration by Europeans in the 15th century AD. Smallpox was introduced into the Caribbean island of Hispaniola in 1509, and into the mainland in 1520, when Spanish settlers from Hispaniola arrived in Mexico bringing smallpox with them. Smallpox devastated the native Amerindian population and was {{an important factor in}} the conquest of the Aztecs and <b>the</b> <b>Incas</b> by the Spaniards. Settlement of the east coast of North America in 1633 in Plymouth, Massachusetts was also accompanied by devastating outbreaks of smallpox among Native American populations, and subsequently among the native-born colonists. Case fatality rates during outbreaks in Native American populations were as high as 80–90%. Smallpox was introduced into Australia in 1789 and again in 1829. Although the disease was never endemic on the continent, it was the principal cause of death in Aboriginal populations between 1780 and 1870.|$|E
5|$|The main access {{route to}} Ollantaytambo runs along a narrow valley {{formed in the}} {{mountains}} by the Urubamba River, which connects the site with Machu Picchu {{to the west and}} with Pisaq and Cusco to the east. After his uprising, Manco Inca fortified the eastern approaches to fend off attacks from the former Inca capital, now under Spanish occupation. The first line of defense was a steep bank of terraces at Pachar, near the confluence of the Anta and Urubamba rivers. Behind it, <b>the</b> <b>Incas</b> channeled the Urubamba to make it cross the valley from right to left and back thus forming two more lines backed by the fortifications of Choqana on the left bank and 'Inkapintay on the right bank. Past them, at the plain of Mascabamba, eleven high terraces closed the valley between the mountains and a deep canyon formed by the Urubamba. The only way to continue was through the gate of T'iyupunku, a thick defensive wall with two narrow doorways. In the event of these fortifications being overrun, the Temple Hill, a religious center surrounded by high terraces overlooking Ollantaytambo, provided a last line of defense.|$|E

50|$|Inti {{ordered his}} {{children}} to build <b>the</b> <b>Inca</b> capital where a divine golden wedge they carried with them would penetrate <b>the</b> earth. <b>Incas</b> believed that this happened {{in the city of}} Cusco. <b>The</b> <b>Inca</b> ruler was considered to be the living representative of Inti.

25|$|Period of Integration and the Arrival of <b>the</b> <b>Incas.</b>|$|E
25|$|During the pre-Inca period, {{people lived}} in ans, which formed great tribes, some allied {{with each other to}} form {{powerful}} confederations, as the Confederation of Quito. But none of these confederations could resist the formidable momentum of the Tawantinsuyu. The invasion of <b>the</b> <b>Incas</b> in the 16th century was very painful and bloody. However, once occupied by the Quito hosts of Huayna Capac (1593–1595), <b>the</b> <b>Incas</b> developed an extensive administration and began the colonization of the region. The Pre-Columbian era can be divided up into four eras: the Pre-ceramic Period, the Formative Period, the Period of Regional Development and the Period of Integration and the Arrival of <b>the</b> <b>Incas.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The {{name and}} meaning of Paccha could be {{interpreted}} and sourced in two ways both originating from the Pre-Colonial period or even before the invasion and conquering by <b>the</b> <b>Inca</b> Empire. One possible meaning lies in the actual {{fact that in the}} native language of the region, including <b>the</b> <b>Inca</b> Empire <b>the</b> Quechua meaning for Paccha (Pachamama) is our Mother Earth. Although for <b>the</b> <b>Inca’s</b> <b>the</b> Pachamama was also a Goddess similar to the goddess Demeter in the Greek Mythology. Another possible historical meaning {{lies in the fact that}} Paccha was also the name of the Princess Paccha a princess from the northern lands, who married <b>the</b> <b>Inca</b> Emperor Huayna Capac in order to stop the conflict in this case the invasion of <b>the</b> <b>Inca</b> empire. Once <b>the</b> <b>Inca’s</b> had conquered <b>the</b> land that now makes Ecuador, they fostered <b>the</b> last <b>Inca</b> Emperor Atahualpa.|$|R

50|$|Inca rope bridges {{are simple}} {{suspension}} bridges over canyons and gorges and rivers (pongos) constructed by <b>the</b> <b>Inca</b> Empire. <b>The</b> bridges were {{an integral part}} of <b>the</b> <b>Inca</b> road system and exemplify Inca innovation in engineering. Bridges of this type were useful since <b>the</b> <b>Inca</b> people did not use wheeled transport - traffic was limited to pedestrians and livestock - and they were frequently used by Chasqui runners delivering messages throughout <b>the</b> <b>Inca</b> Empire.|$|R
25|$|The central {{buildings}} use {{the classical}} Inca architectural style of polished dry-stone walls of regular shape. <b>The</b> <b>Incas</b> were masters of this technique, called ashlar, in which blocks of stone are cut {{to fit together}} tightly without mortar.|$|E
