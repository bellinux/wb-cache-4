5|$|Among the Romani people, mullo (literally {{one who is}} dead) are {{believed}} to return from the dead and cause malicious acts as well as drink human blood, most often that of a relative or <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> caused their death. Other potential victims were {{those who did not}} properly observe the burial ceremonies or kept the deceased's possessions instead of properly destroying them. Female vampires could return, lead a normal life and even marry but would eventually exhaust the husband with their sexual appetite. Similar to other European beliefs, male vampires could father children, known as dhampirs, who could be hired to detect and get rid of vampires.|$|E
5|$|The Sadducismus debellatus pamphlets, {{written by}} Lord Cullen, giving {{details about the}} demonic {{possession}} of Christian Shaw, the 11-year-old girl at {{the centre of the}} Paisley witches trials, were in circulation at the time. Patrick Cowper, the local minister who was intolerant of witches, had read the pamphlets to Morton just before his afflictions began. The villagers' suspicions were aroused that the Devil was implicated when no explanation could be given for Morton's condition; initially his seizures were described as unusual then as preternatural. Cowper continued to advise Morton about what happened in Paisley and encouraged him to name Laing as <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> called upon the Devil to inflict his ailments. In May 1704 Morton named Laing as a witch and, with further prompting from Cowper, accused four local women of being her accomplices: Isobel Adam; Janet Cornfoot; Nicholas Lawson; and Lillie Wallace. Subsequent statements revealed that he identified another woman, Janet Horseburgh, as an accomplice.|$|E

A co-passenger who had travelled with Cheenu and Viji from Chennai to Ooty by train gives them a lead. Cheenu takes Viji to an Ayurvedic medical practitioner and leaves her there for treatment for a day. In his absence, the police come to his house searching for Viji. Finally, the police learn that Viji is getting treated at the doctor's place and reach there. Cheenu is unable to come as he is afraid of police action. The treatment goes through successfully. Viji regains her memory and completely forgets about the period between her accident and recovery. Vedachalam {{and his wife are}} happy and decide to leave. From the doctor, Vedachalam learns that <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> brought her there had been taking good care of their daughter; he withdraws his police complaint and they begin their journey to Chennai with Viji.|$|E

5|$|The trial, Illinois vs. August Spies et al., {{began on}} June 21, 1886, {{and went on}} until August 11. The trial was {{conducted}} {{in an atmosphere of}} extreme prejudice by both public and media toward the defendants. It was presided over by Judge Joseph Gary. Judge Gary displayed open hostility to the defendants, consistently ruled for the prosecution, and failed to maintain decorum. A motion to try the defendants separately was denied. The defense counsel included Sigmund Zeisler, William Perkins Black, William Foster, and Moses Salomon. Selection of the jury was extraordinarily difficult, lasting three weeks, and nearly one thousand people called. All union members and anyone who expressed sympathy toward socialism were dismissed. In the end a jury of 12 was seated, most of whom confessed prejudice towards the defendants. Despite their professions of prejudice Judge Gary seated those who declared that despite their prejudices they would acquit if the evidence supported it, refusing to dismiss for prejudice. Eventually the peremptory challenges of the defense were exhausted. Frustrated by the hundreds of jurors who were being dismissed, a bailiff was appointed who selected jurors rather than calling them at random. The bailiff proved prejudiced himself and selected jurors who seemed likely to convict based on their social position and attitudes toward the defendants. The prosecution, led by Julius Grinnell, argued that since the defendants had not actively discouraged <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> thrown the bomb, they were therefore equally responsible as conspirators. The jury heard the testimony of 118 people, including 54 members of the Chicago Police Department and the defendants Fielden, Schwab, Spies and Parsons. Albert Parsons' brother claimed there was evidence linking the Pinkertons to the bomb. This reflected a widespread belief among the strikers.|$|E
25|$|Perennis {{took over}} the reins of {{government}} and Commodus found a new chamberlain and favourite in Cleander, a Phrygian freedman who had married one of the emperor's mistresses, Demostratia. Cleander was in fact <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> murdered Saoterus. After those attempts on his life, Commodus {{spent much of his}} time outside Rome, mostly on the family estates at Lanuvium. Being physically strong, his chief interest was in sport: taking part in horse racing, chariot racing, and combats with beasts and men, mostly in private but also on occasion in public.|$|E

He was the gang's staff instructor. Colin Wallace maintained Hanna had organised the Dublin bombings in May 1974. Journalist Joe Tiernan alleged that Hanna was an Intelligence Corps agent. He was <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> approached James Mitchell for permission to use the property as an arms dump and bomb-making site.

This was more understandably an aspect of his theology than of his history. This does not mean he saw himself as innovative. On the contrary, he was very much opposed to religious innovation. The story goes that when he was near death ibn Kamil suggested he forgive his enemies.

25|$|The {{prosecution}} {{claimed that}} Bembenek {{was the only}} person with the motive, means and opportunity to carry out the crime. The strongest evidence was two human hairs found at the crime scene, which matched ones taken from the hairbrush of the defendant. The gun used to kill Christine Schultz turned out to be Bembenek's husband's off-duty revolver. The prosecution claimed that Bembenek {{was the only person}} besides Fred Schultz who had access to this weapon. Blood was found on the gun. Bembenek supposedly also had access to a key to Christine Schultz's home. There were no signs of a break-in and no valuables taken. Schultz's eldest son, however, stated that Bembenek was not <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> held up their house and shot his mother.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} said that the concept of {{treasure}} trove in English law dates back to the time of Edward the Confessor (c.1003/1004–1066). Under the common law, treasure trove was defined as gold or silver in any form, whether coin, plate (gold or silver vessels or utensils) or bullion (a lump of gold or silver),|url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50029165|title=OED Online|edition=2nd|location=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1989|accessdate=9 April 2008}}. which had been hidden and rediscovered, and which no person could prove he or she owned. If <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> hidden the treasure was known or discovered later, it belonged to him or her or persons claiming through him or her such as descendants. To be treasure trove, an object had to be substantially – that is, more than 50% – gold or silver.|$|E

25|$|In Hennedige Oliver v. Singapore Dental Council (2007), the High Court {{held that}} members of the Disciplinary Committee ("DC") of the Council had not acted in a biased manner towards Hennedige even though they had interjected a number of times during Hennedige's testimony, and had treated <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> lodged a {{complaint}} against Hennedige gently but had cross-examined Hennedige robustly and strongly challenged his evidence. This was because the members of the DC were entitled to seek clarifications from Hennedige. Furthermore, his evidence covered much wider ground than the complainant's, and part of Hennedige's oral evidence at the inquiry did not feature in his written explanation. The nature of the Hennedige's answers at the inquiry warranted the additional questions, and he must have expected his peers in the DC to question him thoroughly on his many assertions.|$|E
25|$|Next in {{importance}} is the speech Against Agoratus (388 BC), {{one of our}} chief authorities for the internal history of Athens during the months which immediately followed; the defeat at Aegospotami. The Olympiacus (388 BC) is a brilliant fragment, expressing {{the spirit of the}} festival at Olympia, and exhorting Greeks to unite against their common foes. The Plea for the Constitution (403 BC) is interesting for {{the manner in which it}} argues that the well-being of Athens—now stripped of empire—is bound up with the maintenance of democratic principles. The speech For Mantitheus (392 BC) is a graceful and animated portrait, of a young Athenian hippeus, making a spirited defence of his honor against the charge of disloyalty. The defence For the Invalid is a humorous character-sketch. The speech Against Pancleon illustrates the intimate relations between Athens and Plataea, while it gives us some picturesque glimpses of Athenian town life. The defence of <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>had,</b> been charged with destroying a mona, or sacred olive, places us amidst the country life of Attica. And the speech Against Theomnestus deserves attention for its curious evidence of the way in which the ordinary vocabulary of Athens had changed between 600 and 400 BC.|$|E
25|$|There are doubts {{though as}} to Gochiyaev's guilt. In November 2003, an article {{appeared}} in the weekly Moskovskiye Novosti, authored by an investigative journalist, Igor Korolkov. It described a meeting between Mikhail Trepashkin and Mark Blumenfeld, a former businessman who had rented the basement in the apartment house on Guryanov Street to Gochiyaev, in which Mr Blumenfeld stated {{that the person who}} was making use of the Laipanov passport, and who was publicly presented by the investigation as Gochiyaev, was not in fact Gochiyaev. In Lefortovo Prison, Blumenfeld had been shown a photo of someone he was told was Gochiyaev but Blumenfeld replied that he had never seen the man but the investigators insisted that he identify Gochiyaev, at which point Blumenfeld ceased arguing and signed the document. <b>The</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> met Blumenfeld was evidently not the same person depicted in the photograph but was, according to Blumenfeld, a man with a simple face whereas the person Blumenfeld had actually met looked externally like an intellectual. False-Laiponov had been seen by several persons. They all maintained that the original composite photo was very similar to the actual person who rented the storage facilities. The Russian Procuracy General unwittingly substantiated Trepashkin’s claim. Of the four storage premises named (two bombed and two not), the Delo (case) states that the witnesses for three, V.A. Avseev, Mark Blumenfeld and N.A. Gollubeva are not reported to have identified Gochiyaev as False-Laipanov. It should be noted that Blumenfeld’s account was different to the statement that he had signed for the FSB. One witness, Yu.E. Petrunkin, did identify a photograph of Gochiyaev as the man known by him as Laipanov. A driver, V.P.Sinitsyn, hired by False-Laipanov to deliver sacks of sugar, was not reported to have made an identification. Another hired driver, A.V.Prushinskii, stated that he was paid for his work by a man in glasses, about 1.8m tall, similar to the composite photo of Laipanov. It should be noted that Prushinskii was not shown an actual photo of Gochiyaev, even though one existed (it had been shown to Petrunkin).|$|E

[...] The deputy Maurício de Lacerda said that [...] "now the traces of his political legacy—honesty—are disappearing." [...] In the Senate, however, the proposal was rejected due to intervention by the caudillo and radical republican Pinheiro Machado.
