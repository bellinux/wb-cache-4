5|$|Most of <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>at</b> St. Mary's played {{baseball}} in organized leagues {{at different levels}} of proficiency. Ruth later estimated that he played 200 games a year as he steadily climbed the ladder of success. Although he played all positions {{at one time or another}} (including infield positions generally reserved for right-handers), he gained stardom as a pitcher. According to Brother Matthias, Ruth was standing to one side laughing at the bumbling pitching efforts of fellow students, and Matthias told him to go in and see if he could do better. Ruth had become the best pitcher at St. Mary's, and when he was 18 in 1913, he was allowed to leave the premises to play weekend games on teams that were drawn from the community. He was mentioned in several newspaper articles, for both his pitching prowess and ability to hit long home runs.|$|E

After only two months based in the church of St. Martin, the entire {{neighborhood}} expressed its annoyance with the noise coming from <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>at</b> play. A formal complaint was lodged against them with the municipality. Rumors also circulated that the meetings conducted by the priest with his boys were dangerous; their recreation could be turned into a revolution against the government. The group was evicted.|$|E
25|$|Urged by her father, Ian, {{to take up}} cricket, Reeler didn't {{start playing}} until she was 15, and then lacked the self-discipline to truly progress. A move to opening batsman changed that, and gave her the {{self-confidence}} to improve. As a teenager, she played for Ravenswood High School, but craving greater competition, she trained and played with <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>at</b> nearby Barker College. She appeared for New South Wales Breakers {{at the age of}} 19, taking one wicket and scoring five runs in a drawn two-day match with South Australia. She made just three appearances in her maiden season, all coming in January 1981.|$|E
25|$|Adulthood {{was reached}} {{at the age}} of 18, and the young adult (eiren) {{initially}} served as a trainer for <b>the</b> <b>boys.</b> <b>At</b> the same time, the most promising youths were included in the Krypteia. At 20, Spartans became eligible for military service and joined one of the messes (syssitia), which included 15 men of various ages. Those who were rejected retained a lesser form of citizenship, as only the soldiers were ranked among the homoioi. However, even after that, and even during marriage and until about the age of 30, they would spend most of their day in the barracks with their unit. Military duty lasted until the 60th year, but there are recorded cases of older people participating in campaigns in times of crisis.|$|E

Clay Basket fears that young Jacques will be psychologically damaged and left a scarred outcast, since both worlds he comes from reject him.|$|E
500|$|The {{field for}} the role of the boy in Lassie [...] was narrowed to three young actors, but the final {{decision}} was left to Pal. After spending a week with <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>at</b> Weatherwax's North Hollywood home, Pal seemed to like eleven-year-old Tommy Rettig more than the other two. Rettig won the role based on Pal's response, and filming for the two pilots began in the summer of 1954, with Pal portraying Lassie in both.|$|E

[...] Critical reception was generally positive, and multiple reviewers applauded Perry and Doofenshmirtz's relationship in the episode, which they noted was portrayed with possible homosexual subtext.|$|E

He explains that the diamond was originally split into two pieces and hidden at different points of the world, but Streisand had managed to find {{the first of the}} two. Streisand later dons a disguise and visits the boys again, offering them a monetary reward for the triangle. Stan, Kenny and Kyle are suspicious, but Cartman insists they go along for the money.|$|E

500|$|At age 10 Johannes was {{declared}} a {{ward of court}} {{and sent to the}} school institution Toftes gave on the island Helgøya in the lake Mjøsa. While at the strict institution Johannes received parcels from home, with yellow cheese. The cheese was needed because of the meagre rations given <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>at</b> Toftes gave. The parcels with yellow cheese led to Johannes being given the nickname [...] "Gulosten" [...] (...) by the other boys at the institution, a name that stuck with him {{for the rest of his}} life. After four years on Helgøya he was transferred to Bastøy school home for maladjusted boys, an equally harsh institution. When 29boys rebelled at Bastøy in 1915, police officers and the Norwegian Armed Forces were employed to crush the riot, and the leaders taken away in handcuffs. Physical punishment was common at Bastøy, including being locked away in a dark cellar, a punishment Johannes had to endure. When Johannes was 15 his mother died, and he was not informed until several days after her funeral. This led to him making suicide threats and going amok at the warden's office, for which he was punished with a stay in the dark cell.|$|E
