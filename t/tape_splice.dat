There is harmonic ambiguity, in that the chord progression may be either interpreted as I–IV–I (in B) or V–I–V (in G). Stebbins says that this section [...] "might be called a bridge under normal circumstances, but the song's structure takes such an abstract route that traditional labels don't really apply." [...] A new sound is created by tack piano, jaw harp, and bass relegated to strong beats which is subsequently (1:55) augmented by a new electric organ, bass harmonica, and sleigh bells shaken on every beat. [...] The lone line of vocals (aside from non-lexical harmonies) is [...] "I don't know where, but she takes me there" [...] sung in Mike Love's upper-register baritone. [...] This section lasts for ten measures (6 + 2 + 2), which is unexpectedly long in light of previous patterns.|$|E

Brian’s own description of the song—a three-and-a-half-minute 'pocket symphony'—is a telling clue about his formal ambitions here." ...|$|E

5000|$|Side 1 of {{this single}} is {{an excerpt from}} side 1 of the Tubular Bells album, which {{contains}} 2 long pieces, [...] "Tubular Bells" [...] parts 1 and 2. The excerpt was made by staff at Atlantic Records, the American distributors of Oldfield's label, Virgin Records, and was made from {{bits and pieces of}} the first 8 minutes of the album, often resulting in abrupt transitions that did not occur in the original version. The abruptness of the edits is a combination of the choice of excerpts, and physical <b>tape</b> <b>splice</b> editing. This version also suffers from a loud hum, which is clearly audible in the quiet opening section, and is not heard on the album. It ends with a return to the opening, which fades out. On the album, there is no return to the opening. This edited version {{is often referred to as}} [...] "Now the Original" [...] in reference to the advertising sub-title, which is printed on the label in larger type than the song title itself.

2500|$|Following {{his work}} with Studio d'Essai at Radiodiffusion Française (RDF), during the early 1940s, Pierre Schaeffer is {{credited}} with originating the {{theory and practice of}} musique concrète. In the late 1940s, experiments in sound based composition using shellac record players were first conducted by Schaeffer.

Their music is heavily influenced by Minimalist music, such as La Monte Young and Terry Riley, and electronic composers, such as Hugh Le Caine and Karlheinz Stockhausen.|$|R

Solo works include titles such as Invisible Barrier (1992), Aftersolstice (1994), Days of the Eclipse (1996), Magnetic <b>Tape</b> <b>Splicing</b> (1997), [...] "The Rings of Saturn"(2010), {{the latter being}} an allusion to the German novel {{of the same name}} by W.G.

50|$|The {{earliest}} commercial modular synthesizers were developed, in parallel, by R.A. Moog Co., and Buchla in 1963. Their designs {{drew from}} innovations by inventor Hugh Le Caine, particularly his implementation of control voltage {{in the electronic}} sackbut. The synthesizer both broadened the spectrum, and greatly eased the creation of electronic music, which before was made via <b>tape</b> <b>splicing,</b> use of primitive electronic oscillators, and earlier electronic or electromechanical instruments such as the theremin and the Ondes Martenot. ARP (in 1970), Serge (1974), and EMS (1969) versions were soon to follow.|$|R

500|$|... "Good Vibrations" [...] {{established}} a new {{method of operation}} for Wilson. Instead of working on whole songs with clear large-scale syntactical structures, Wilson limited himself to recording short interchangeable fragments (or [...] "modules"). Through the method of <b>tape</b> <b>splicing,</b> each fragment could then be assembled into a linear sequence, allowing any number of larger structures and divergent moods to be produced at a later time. This was the same modular approach used during the sessions for Smile and Smiley Smile. To mask each tape edit, vast reverb decays were added at the mixing and sub-mixing stages.|$|R
50|$|The {{combination}} {{of the ability to}} edit via <b>tape</b> <b>splicing</b> and the ability to record multiple tracks revolutionized studio recording. It became common studio recording practice to record on multiple tracks, and bounce down afterward. The convenience of tape editing and multitrack recording led to the rapid adoption of magnetic tape as the primary technology for commercial musical recordings. Although 33⅓ rpm and 45 rpm vinyl records were the dominant consumer format, recordings were customarily made first on tape, then transferred to disc, with Bing Crosby leading the way in the adoption of this method in the United States.|$|R

5000|$|Greek {{composer}} Iannis Xenakis {{is known}} as the inventor of the granular synthesis technique. Xenakis was the first to explicate a compositional theory for grains of sound. He began by adopting the following lemma: [...] "All sound, even continuous musical variation, is conceived as an assemblage {{of a large number of}} elementary sounds adequately disposed in time. In the attack, body, and decline of a complex sound, thousands of pure sounds appear in a more or less short interval of time." [...] Xenakis created granular sounds using analog tone generators and <b>tape</b> <b>splicing.</b> These appear in the composition Analogique A-B for string orchestra and tape (1959).|$|R

50|$|Other {{units used}} a single reel, with the <b>tape</b> <b>spliced</b> into a {{continuous}} loop, {{much as in}} an 8-track cartridge. The tape would circulate and old audio information would be overwritten every 30 minutes. Recovery of sound from magnetic tape often proves difficult if the recorder is recovered from water and its housing has been breached. Thus, the latest designs employ solid-state memory and use digital recording techniques, making them much more resistant to shock, vibration and moisture. With the reduced power requirements of solid-state recorders, it is now practical to incorporate a battery in the units, so that recording can continue until flight termination, even if the aircraft electrical system fails.|$|R

50|$|Single-8 cartridges, {{without a}} press plate, {{are of a}} {{different}} design from a Super 8 cartridge, resembling a cassette-style design (supply and take-up reels side by side) as opposed to Super 8's coaxial cartridge design (one reel {{on top of the}} other). Therefore, Single-8 film cartridges can only be used in Single-8 cameras. However, the film loaded in a Single-8 cartridge has exactly the same dimensions as Super 8 (though it is made of a thinner and stronger polyester base, rather than the acetate base of Super 8 film), and can be viewed in any Super 8 projector after processing. However, Fuji recommended that only <b>tape</b> <b>splices</b> be used when combining Single-8 footage with Super-8, as cement would cause damage to the Single-8 footage. Also, when jammed, Single-8 footage had a tendency to stretch in the projector, unlike the acetate-based Super-8 film, which simply broke.|$|R

25|$|From the {{contemporary}} point of view, {{the importance of}} Schaeffer's musique concrète is threefold. He developed the concept of including any and all sounds into the vocabulary of music. At first he concentrated on working with sounds other than those produced by traditional musical instruments. Later on, he found {{it was possible to}} remove the familiarity of musical instrument sounds and abstract them further by techniques such as removing the attack of the recorded sound. He was among the first musicians to manipulate recorded sound for the purpose of using it in conjunction with other sounds in order to compose a musical piece. Techniques such as tape looping and <b>tape</b> <b>splicing</b> were used in his research, often comparing to sound collage. The advent of Schaeffer's manipulation of recorded sound became possible only with technologies that were developed after World War II had ended in Europe. His work is recognized today as an essential precursor to contemporary sampling practices.
