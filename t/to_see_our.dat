25|$|Prior to the final, the GAA {{stated that}} the All-Ireland final post-match {{presentation}} of the Liam MacCarthy Cup would {{be returned to the}} centre of the pitch. The Association were considering a return to the centre of Croke Park for All-Ireland day presentations since the 2008 football decider between Tyrone and Kerry when Kerry's Colm Cooper was jostled by rival supporters as he left the field following the final whistle. From 1999 to 2001, presentations were made in the centre of Croke Park and passed off largely without incident. However, a pitch invasion by fans following the 2009 hurling final meant plans to change the style of trophy presentation were cancelled, with Kilkenny captain Michael Fennelly receiving the Liam MacCarthy Cup in the Hogan Stand of Croke Park. GAA President Christy Cooney later spoke of his disappointment about the pitch invasion but indicated that it confirmed his belief that the invasions must stop. He said: Despite all pre-match communications, press publicity and big-screen appeals, it was extremely disappointing <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>our</b> plans were not realised. Even allowing for all the exuberance and joy of supporters on the day, it was disappointing to see the disregard for the safety of others amongst fans intent on getting on the pitch and ignoring safety appeals. The Kilkenny County Board later complained about the presentation.|$|E

War and apocalyptic disaster was an especially common theme; Gold reported that [...] "Over 90% of stories submitted still nag away at ...

500|$|East Coker gives {{a message}} of hope that the English {{communities}} would survive through World War II. In a letter dated 9 February 1940, Eliot stated, [...] "We can have very little hope of contributing to any immediate social change; and we are more disposed <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>our</b> hope in modest and local beginnings, than in transforming the whole world at once... We must keep alive aspirations which can remain valid throughout the longest and darkest period of universal calamity and degradation." [...] The poem also relied on the war {{as a way to}} connect to Eliot's idea that there was a united humanity. In particular, Stephen Spender claimed that [...] "the war modified [...] attitude by convincing him that there was a Western cause to be positively defended. And after the war there was a Germany to be brought back within the Western tradition".|$|E
500|$|Lambert had the acumen {{to refuse}} the {{management}} offers of various impresarios and agents, and by , {{he had returned}} to Leicester as a wealthy man. [...] He returned to his favourite pastimes, breeding sporting dogs and fighting cocks. A terrier bitch, {{for which he was}} offered 100guineas (about £ as of [...] ), was said to be the finest in England. He refused to sell the dog, which became his lifetime companion. He began again to attend sporting events, as a report on the Leicester Races of September 1806 noted that [...] "Among the distinguished characters upon the turf we were glad <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>our</b> old friend, Mr.Daniel Lambert, in apparent high health and spirits". Although too heavy to follow hunts on horseback, he used a portion of the money earned in London to build up a pack of greyhounds, watching from his carriage as they coursed hares in the Leicestershire countryside.|$|E
500|$|Though {{at times}} Hazlitt delighted in actors' interpretations of Shakespearean characters, {{and he thought}} some of Shakespeare's plays eminently suited for the stage, he opens the chapter on Hamlet by proclaiming, [...] "We do not like <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>our</b> author's plays acted, and least of all, Hamlet". Here, more than {{anywhere}} else, he sides with Charles Lamb in believing Shakespeare's plays to suffer in stage presentation. Neither John Kemble nor his favourite actor Edmund Kean {{played the role of}} Hamlet to his satisfaction. [...] "Mr. Kean's Hamlet is as much too splenetic and rash as Mr. Kemble's is too deliberate and formal." [...] This, he felt, is a play to be read, and he noted that by his time it had already been so often read as to have become part of the common culture. [...] "This is that Hamlet the Dane, whom we read of in our youth". One might say, he observes, that Hamlet is just a character in a play: [...] "Hamlet is a name; his speeches and sayings but the idle coinage of the poet's brain." [...] Yet Shakespeare gives those sayings a reality {{in the mind of the}} reader, making them [...] "as real as our own thoughts." ...|$|E

James told Sunrise that viewers could expect a [...] "realistic portrayal of teen pregnancy" [...] and she explained {{that it was important to}} respect the issue. She added [...] "We took it very seriously with the writers, and you do a lot of research and things like that. You can only do your best, I guess!" [...] Nicole later told Marilyn Chambers (Emily Symons) about the baby and she offered to adopt it. James later revealed that when she joined Home and Away she told the writers that they can do anything with her character, except make her pregnant. Of the moment she was told that Nicole was going to have a baby, James said [...] "I went in <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>our</b> producer later and he said, 'Okay, I'm going to apologise in advance - we're making Nicole pregnant!'" [...] She initially did not want to portray a [...] "typical soap teenage pregnancy" [...] as she thought Nicole should be different. However the situation was explained to her and she became excited at the challenging storyline ahead.|$|E
500|$|Precious was {{screened}} {{during the}} 2009 Sundance Film Festival from January 15, 2009, until January 25 in Park City, Utah. At Sundance, Precious was listed under its original title of Push: Based On The Novel By Sapphire; however, {{the title was}} later altered to avoid confusion with another 2009 film entitled Push. Precious appeared in the Un Certain Regard, an award section recognising unique and innovative films, at the 62nd Cannes Film Festival in May 2009. At Cannes, the film received a fifteen-minute standing ovation from the audience after the film was screened. Daniels commented that, at first he was [...] "embarrassed" [...] to show Precious at Cannes {{because he did not}} want [...] "to exploit black people" [...] and wasn’t sure if he [...] "wanted white French people <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>our</b> world." [...] After the success at Precious screenings at Sundance, reporters took note that the film could mirror the success of other films that had been screened and praised at the festival. S. James Snyder, of Time, compared Precious's success at Sundance to that of 2008's The Wrestler and Slumdog Millionaire; both films later were nominated for multiple Academy Awards, and Slumdog itself won Best Picture at the 81st Annual Academy Awards.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive reviews. Margaret Lyons of Entertainment Weekly {{praised the}} episode, comparing it positively to previous episodes [...] "Casino Night" [...] and [...] "Booze Cruise": [...] "not as heavy or emotional, certainly, {{but still a}} chance <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>our</b> Dunderheads in a charming and demonstrative not-quite-work environment." [...] Lyons also complimented a number {{of changes in the}} series the episode seemed to indicate, including shifting allegiances, goodwill where there used to be bad and a possible budding romance between Andy and Kelly. Alan Sepinwall, television journalist with The Star-Ledger, said the episode, [...] "started off seeming like a dumb and pointless idea before gradually revealing itself to be a fun, and even welcome, diversion." [...] Sepinwall said the episode was not as funny as other recent ones, but that he enjoyed seeing the characters interact this way together, and particularly liked seeing Dwight and Phyllis bond, [...] "even as he treated her like a racehorse". Josh McAuliffe of The Times-Tribune in Scranton, Pennsylvania, described the episode as [...] "a wacky and wonderful little gem, one of those rare ones where it was just wall-to-wall happy, giddy fun, with not a drop of pathos, except for maybe Michael whining about having to eat lunch by himself." [...] McAuliffe also said he was glad to see Erin's [...] "cheerful, appealingly goofy personality" [...] continue to emerge.|$|E

500|$|Mason had {{submitted}} {{his plan}} sometime between June 8 and 10, 1776. It named {{the new state}} the [...] "Commonwealth of Virginia", a name chosen pointedly by Mason to indicate that power stemmed from the people. The constitution provided for a popularly elected House of Delegates, chosen annually by men who owned or leased property, or who had fathered three or more Virginians. Most governmental power resided in the House of Delegates—the governor could not even veto a bill, and could only act {{as head of the}} state militia on the advice of his Council of State, whose members were elected by the legislature. The draft was considered by the committee, and it issued a report on June 24, at which time Jefferson's preamble and several amendments authored by him were included—George Wythe, who advocated for Jefferson's draft before the committee, found discussion far enough advanced that members were only willing to yield to Jefferson on a few points. The entire convention considered the document between June 26 and 28, and it was signed on the 29th. Richard Henry Lee wrote the day prior to the constitution's passage by unanimous vote, [...] "I have had the pleasure <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>our</b> new plan of Government go on well. This day will put a finishing hand to it. 'Tis very much of the democratic kind." ...|$|E
500|$|Gwenda Robb and Elaine Smith, {{in their}} Concise Dictionary of Australian Artists, {{considered}} Fuller's art {{to be created}} in [...] "a free painterly style indebted to Impressionism". During {{the first decade of}} the twentieth century, reviews drew attention to her distinctively Australian style. When one of Fuller's works was included in an exhibition of colonial artists in London (including paintings from Canada and Australia), the [...] correspondent from the Adelaide Advertiser described Fuller's contribution as [...] "most Australian in feeling". Reviewing her work hung in the Royal Academy in 1904, a Perth critic reported: [...] "Of the 16 or 17 Australian artists exhibiting at the Academy, Miss Fuller was the only one who chose a typically Australian scene. Her picture shows a young girl in thin white, clinging, dress, standing on a bushy piece of country... As the London Observer says, the atmosphere that bathes the graceful figure of the girl is capitally managed with its note of subtropical heat". One reviewer thought very highly of her portraits, but was less convinced about Fuller's approach to the Australian light, writing:She had less success with our landscapes than with her figure subjects. That was the result of her passion for toning her pictures for ultimate indoor hanging. Thereby she lost, or illuminated, the hard Australian, hard light and shade, and startling relative values. Observable too was the influence of the English school in her rendering of our foliage; never could she bring herself <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>our</b> trees as dim coloured as they usually are.|$|E
500|$|In April 2016, the ABC-owned {{cable network}} Freeform {{announced}} Marvel's Cloak & Dagger, {{based on the}} characters of the same name, with a straight-to-series order for 2018. The network confirmed that the series would be [...] "its first venture into the Marvel Cinematic Universe", and described the show as a [...] "superhero love story", a premise that Variety called [...] "a seamless fit for Freeform" [...] given the network's target audience of [...] "Becomers" [...] (the 14-34 age demographic). This younger-skewing content was continued with the comedy series Marvel's New Warriors ordered in April 2017, with Freeform executive Karey Burke saying, Marvel [...] "started <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>our</b> strength with young adults and together we could create a pipeline for content that was specific to our audience that felt younger than what they're doing at the other channels... It was important {{to both of us}} to find the right characters that felt like they would speak directly to Freeform's audience. The Avengers wouldn't work here but the about-to-be-Avengers works here." [...] Loeb noted that it was [...] "exciting" [...] to Marvel [...] "to be able to explore the world of the hero and how it affects someone who {{is trying to figure out}} who they are as opposed to already knows who they are and now their whole life has to take a left. That's the journey we're going on with these kinds of characters" [...] in Cloak & Dagger, New Warriors and Hulu's Runaways. In November 2017, it was announced that New Warriors would no longer air on Freeform and was being shopped to other networks.|$|E
