5|$|Melvil Dewey (1851–1931) was an American {{librarian}} and self-declared reformer. He was {{a founding}} member of the American Library Association and can be credited with the promotion of card systems in libraries and business. He developed the ideas for his library classification system in 1873 while working at Amherst College library. He applied <b>the</b> <b>classification</b> to the books in that library, until in 1876 he had a first version of <b>the</b> <b>classification.</b> In 1876, he published <b>the</b> <b>classification</b> in pamphlet form with the title A Classification and Subject Index for Cataloguing and Arranging the Books and Pamphlets of a Library.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>classification</b> {{of bodies}} in other {{planetary}} systems with {{the characteristics of}} dwarf planets has not been addressed.|$|E
5|$|A {{white dwarf}} with a {{polarized}} magnetic field, an effective temperature of 17,000K, and a spectrum dominated by He I lines which also had hydrogen features {{could be given}} <b>the</b> <b>classification</b> of DBAP3.|$|E
50|$|The final of <b>the</b> primary <b>classifications</b> is <b>the</b> Combination <b>Classification.</b> A rider's ranking in <b>the</b> Combination <b>Classification</b> is {{determined}} by tallying up his positions in <b>the</b> General <b>Classification,</b> <b>the</b> Points <b>Classification,</b> and <b>the</b> Mountains <b>Classification.</b> <b>The</b> rider with the highest overall position in these three <b>classifications</b> combined is <b>the</b> leader of <b>the</b> Combination <b>Classification</b> and wears <b>the</b> white jersey. If no rider is classified in all three classifications, riders classified in two will be considered.|$|R
50|$|The race {{included}} {{four main}} classifications: <b>the</b> general <b>classification,</b> <b>the</b> points <b>classification,</b> <b>the</b> mountains <b>classification</b> and <b>the</b> youth <b>classification.</b> There {{was also an}} award for the most aggressive rider on each stage and a team classification.|$|R
5000|$|During {{the stages}} when Merckx was leading <b>the</b> general <b>classification</b> and <b>the</b> points <b>classification,</b> Merckx wore <b>the</b> yellow jersey {{and the number}} two of <b>the</b> points <b>classification</b> was wearing a black/green jersey. When Merckx was leading <b>the</b> general <b>classification</b> and <b>the</b> {{combination}} <b>classification,</b> <b>the</b> number two of <b>the</b> combination <b>classification</b> wore a black/white jersey.|$|R
5|$|A {{white dwarf}} with only He I lines in its {{spectrum}} and an effective temperature of 15,000K {{could be given}} <b>the</b> <b>classification</b> of DB3, or, if warranted by the precision of the temperature measurement, DB3.5.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, {{there was}} a points classification, which awarded a green jersey. In <b>the</b> <b>classification,</b> cyclists {{received}} points for finishing in the top 10 in a stage. For stages, 1, 2 and 4 the win earned 25points, second place 22, third 20, fourth 18, fifth 16, sixth 14, seventh 12, eighth 10, ninth 8 and tenth 6. For stages 5, 6, 7 and 8 the win earned 15points, second place 12, third 10, fourth 8, fifth 6, and 1 point fewer per place down to a single point for 10th. Points towards <b>the</b> <b>classification</b> could also be achieved {{at each of the}} intermediate sprints; these points were given to the top three riders through the line with 5points for first, 3 for second, and 1 point for third.|$|E
5|$|Although {{concerns}} were raised about <b>the</b> <b>classification</b> of planets orbiting other stars, {{the issue was}} not resolved; it was proposed instead to decide this only when such objects start to be observed.|$|E
5000|$|In <b>the</b> other race <b>classifications,</b> Altig won <b>the</b> points <b>classification</b> and Federico Bahamontes of [...] won <b>the</b> {{mountains}} <b>classification.</b> <b>The</b> team <b>classification</b> was won by , and Eddy Pauwels (...) won <b>the</b> combativity <b>classification.</b> Altig and Emile Daems (...) won {{the most}} stages, with three each.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to <b>the</b> general <b>classification,</b> Merckx won <b>the</b> points <b>classification.</b> Amongst <b>the</b> other <b>classifications</b> that <b>the</b> race awarded, José Manuel Fuente of KAS won <b>the</b> mountains <b>classification.</b> Molteni finished as {{the winners of}} <b>the</b> team points <b>classification.</b>|$|R
50|$|Some cyclists {{have managed}} to win both <b>the</b> general <b>classification</b> and <b>the</b> {{mountains}} <b>classification</b> in <b>the</b> same year.In {{the early years of}} the Tour, only the highest mountains gave points. Cyclists aiming for the Tour win generally did well on those mountains, so the riders high in <b>the</b> general <b>classification</b> were typically also high in <b>the</b> mountains <b>classification,</b> which made <b>the</b> double more likely. Later, the rules of <b>the</b> mountains <b>classification</b> changed, giving more points to mountains of lower category. The cyclists aiming to win <b>the</b> general <b>classification</b> did not spend energy on those lower category mountains, and thus other cyclists could aim for <b>the</b> mountains <b>classification</b> win. In 1969, Eddy Merckx won not only <b>the</b> general <b>classification</b> and <b>the</b> mountains <b>classification,</b> but also <b>the</b> points <b>classification.</b>|$|R
5|$|Another {{group was}} called Microsauria by Cope in 1868. He {{classified}} Microsauria as a subgroup of Labyrinthodontia, placing many small, amphibian-like animals within it. Among them was Dendrerpeton, once placed in Ganocephala. Dendrerpeton was later placed as a labyrinthodont with other temnospondyls, but confusion existed {{for many years}} over <b>the</b> <b>classification</b> of small amphibians.|$|E
5|$|As for <b>the</b> <b>classification</b> of the Mongolic family {{relative}} to other languages, the Altaic theory (which is increasingly less well received among linguists) proposes that the Mongolic family {{is a member of}} a larger, now discredited Altaic family that would also include the Turkic and Tungusic, and usually Koreanic languages and Japonic languages as well.|$|E
5|$|Different {{crystalline}} {{forms of}} an element are called allotropes. Some allotropes, {{particularly those of}} elements located (in periodic table terms) alongside or near the notional dividing line between metals and nonmetals, exhibit more pronounced metallic, metalloidal or nonmetallic behaviour than others. The existence of such allotropes can complicate <b>the</b> <b>classification</b> of the elements involved.|$|E
2500|$|In <b>the</b> other <b>classifications,</b> <b>the</b> young riders {{competition}} was won by Davide Formolo (...) , Machado won <b>the</b> Portuguese <b>classification</b> and Machado's team Katusha won <b>the</b> team's <b>classification.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In <b>the</b> race's other <b>classifications,</b> Jens Debusschere (...) won <b>the</b> points <b>classification,</b> <b>the</b> combativity <b>classification</b> was won by [...] rider Kenneth Vanbilsen, while <b>the</b> teams <b>classification</b> {{was taken}} by , after placing three riders {{in the top five}} places overall.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> points <b>classification</b> was won by Laurent Jalabert, while Richard Virenque won <b>the</b> {{mountains}} <b>classification.</b> Marco Pantani won <b>the</b> young rider <b>classification,</b> and ONCE won <b>the</b> team <b>classification.</b>|$|R
5|$|Following {{an effort}} from the International Maple Syrup Institute (IMSI) and many maple syrup {{producer}} associations, both Canada and the United States have altered their laws regarding <b>the</b> <b>classification</b> of maple syrup to be uniform. Whereas {{in the past}} each state or province had their own laws on <b>the</b> <b>classification</b> of maple syrup, now those laws define a unified grading system. This had been {{a work in progress}} for several years, and most of the finalization of the new grading system was made in 2014. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency announced in the Canada Gazette on 28 June 2014 that rules for the sale of maple syrup would be amended to include new descriptors, {{at the request of the}} IMSI.|$|E
5|$|In 1895, the International Institute of Bibliography, {{located in}} Belgium {{and led by}} Paul Otlet, {{contacted}} Dewey {{about the possibility of}} translating <b>the</b> <b>classification</b> into French, and using <b>the</b> <b>classification</b> system for bibliographies (as opposed to its use for books in libraries). This would have required some changes to <b>the</b> <b>classification,</b> which was under copyright. Dewey gave permission {{for the creation of a}} version intended for bibliographies, and also for its translation into French. Dewey did not agree, however, to allow the International Institute of Bibliography to later create an English version of the resulting classification, considering that a violation of their agreement, as well as a violation of Dewey's copyright. Shortly after Dewey's death in 1931, however, an agreement was reached between the committee overseeing the development of the Decimal Classification and the developers of the French Classification Decimal. The English version was published as the Universal Decimal Classification and is still in use today.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to <b>the</b> <b>classification</b> of seizures {{which focuses on}} what happens during a seizure, <b>the</b> <b>classification</b> of epilepsies focuses on the underlying causes. When a person is admitted to hospital after an epileptic seizure the diagnostic workup results preferably in the seizure itself being classified (e.g. tonic-clonic) and in the underlying disease being identified (e.g. hippocampal sclerosis). The name of the diagnosis finally made depends on the available diagnostic results and the applied definitions and classifications (of seizures and epilepsies) and its respective terminology.|$|E
5000|$|Meyer {{also won}} <b>the</b> points <b>classification,</b> while Cameron Bayly (search2retain-health.com.au) won <b>the</b> {{mountains}} <b>classification</b> and Robert Power (Jayco-AIS) won <b>the</b> young rider <b>classification.</b> [...] won <b>the</b> teams <b>classification.</b>|$|R
50|$|When using <b>the</b> <b>classifications</b> below, <b>the</b> problem's {{complexity}} {{class is}} determined by <b>the</b> topmost <b>classification</b> that it satisfies.|$|R

5|$|Later Aucouturier caught Pottier, {{and dropped}} him, {{and won the}} stage. Pottier became second in the stage and led <b>the</b> <b>classification.</b> Seven cyclists did not reach the finish in time, but they were again allowed to start the next stage.|$|E
5|$|Linwood House was {{registered}} as a heritage building by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust on 17 August 1982 with registration number 3119 classified as D. With {{the change of}} <b>the</b> <b>classification</b> system, the building later became a Category II listing.|$|E
5|$|Note: <b>The</b> <b>classification</b> of the 18 boats {{into the}} two U.S. fleets is {{according}} to the latest updates of the Naval Vessel Register, and does not indicate previous boat transfers between the two fleets.|$|E
5000|$|In <b>the</b> race's other <b>classifications,</b> John Degenkolb of [...] won {{the green}} jersey for <b>the</b> points <b>classification.</b> Degenkolb took four stage wins, the most by any rider in the race.

5|$|Since {{the year}} 2000, taxonomic studies using cladistical {{analyses}} of multiple organ systems, shell morphology (including fossil species) and modern molecular phylogenetics {{have resulted in}} the drawing up of what experts believe is a more accurate phylogeny of the Bivalvia. Based upon these studies, a new proposed classification system for the Bivalvia was published in 2010 by Bieler, Carter & Coan. In 2012, this new system was adopted by the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) for <b>the</b> <b>classification</b> of the Bivalvia. Some experts still maintain that Anomalodesmacea should be considered a separate subclass, whereas the new system treats it as the order Anomalodesmata, within the subclass Heterodonta. Molecular phylogenetic work continues, further clarifying which Bivalvia are most closely related and thus refining <b>the</b> <b>classification.</b>|$|E
5|$|TCDD was {{classified}} in 1997 by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as a carcinogen for humans (group 1). In the occupational cohort studies available for <b>the</b> <b>classification,</b> the risk, even {{at very high}} exposures, was weak and borderline detectable. Therefore, human data were not deemed sufficient, and <b>the</b> <b>classification</b> was, in essence, based on animal experiments and mechanistic considerations. This has been criticized as a deviation from IARC classification rules. It is much debated whether TCDD is carcinogenic only at high doses which also cause toxic damage of tissues. Moreover, a recent review concludes that, after 1997, further studies do not support an association between TCDD exposure and cancer risk. New studies include the update of Vietnam veteran studies from Ranch Hand operation, which concluded that after 30 years the results do not provide evidence of disease.|$|E
5|$|The Eskaya {{community}} has been the object of ongoing controversy, particularly with regards to its status as an indigenous group and <b>the</b> <b>classification</b> of the Eskayan language. Intense speculation in the 1980s and 1990s {{on the part of}} journalists and lay historians generated a number of theories that continue to be elaborated without resolution.|$|E
