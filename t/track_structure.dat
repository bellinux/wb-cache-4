5|$|Renovations began almost {{immediately}} and involved {{the removal of}} all of the wooden track and modifications to some of the support structure. On March 3, 2010, Six Flags Over Texas and Rocky Mountain Construction (RMC) unveiled the steel I-Box track which would be used on the refurbished ride. The track was developed over the course of three years by RMC owner Fred Grubb, and Ride Centerline, LLC engineers Alan Schilke and Dody Bachtar. The steel track was designed to be a replacement for any existing wooden <b>track</b> <b>structure,</b> with the rail shape, approximate weight, and dimensions remaining the same. Schilke designed the modifications to the layout, giving specifications to Grubb for manufacturing at RMC's Idaho plant. There, two-dimensional plates of steel were machine-welded to form the three-dimensional track parts. The redevelopment saw much of the track get reprofiled; the lift hill was increased by , the first drop was steepened to 79 degrees, and several overbanked turns (ranging from 90° to 115°) were added. The renovated ride, dubbed the New Texas Giant, reopened on April 4, 2011.|$|E

25|$|Because of {{steadily}} increasing traffic to Lehrter Stadtbahnhof and its location on a bridge crossing {{the north end}} of Lehrter Bahnhof, elaborate changes were made to the <b>track</b> <b>structure</b> in 1912 and again in 1929.

Lower maintenance requirements lead to fewer interruptions to traffic, and considerable cost savings over the design life of the structure. [URL]...|$|R

25|$|The Morris Street {{station was}} reopened {{for two years}} until the line was rebuilt for the {{junction}} of the IRT Sixth Avenue Line at Morris Street. On June 2, 1878, service to 53rd Street began. By then, the line carried 8,500 passengers a day. The car and engine shops were located behind #7 Broadway. Passenger cars were lighted by oil candles at this time. On June 9, 1879, operations were extended to 81st Street and Columbus (Ninth) Avenue, with new stations at 59th, 66th, 72nd and 81st Streets. The double <b>track</b> <b>structure</b> was built jointly by the New York Elevated Railroad {{on the west side}} of the street and the Metropolitan Elevated Railroad on the east side. On June 21, 1879, service was extended to 104th Street with intermediate stations at 86th, 93rd Street, and 99th Street.|$|E
500|$|As {{the railway}} was {{effectively}} {{split into two}} halves by the incline, two engine sheds were needed, one for the lower level line from Watchet to Comberow and another for the upper level south of the incline top. Initially the lower level used a temporary locoshed at Torre siding. This {{was replaced by a}} permanent one [...] "road" [...] (<b>track)</b> <b>structure</b> known as [...] "Watchet". It was originally built of wood, but was rebuilt in masonry and slate in the Winter of 1872-3, with part of the original shed retained at the northern end to act as a workshop. In 1911 the shed was extended at the southern end to cater for the two locomotives participating in the automatic control trials. This extension was removed after the trial locomotives were taken away. The shed stood east of the line in the Whitehall area, a short distance south of [...] station. It was open for three periods: April 1857 to 7 November 1898, 4 July 1907 to 1910 and 1911–14. In 2015 it was in use as a dwelling.|$|E

40|$|In-field {{testing for}} {{structural}} integrity using dynamic non-destructive investigation of ballasted railway <b>track</b> <b>structures</b> {{was carried out}} and is presented in this paper. A non-destructive technique, ‘modal analysis’, was utilised in this investigation. The railway <b>track</b> <b>structures</b> were dynamically excited using an impact excitation instrumented hammer. Due {{to the nature of}} railway <b>track</b> <b>structures</b> that they extrude for a long distance, the transient excitation was given randomly at several local areas. Acceleration responses in time domain were recorded using an accelerometer mounting on the railhead. The frequency response functions (FRFs) can be obtained via the PULSE FFT Analyser. The analytical formulation and best curve fitting algorithms were developed to identify the dynamic properties of railway tracks’ components. Rather than providing only the absolute solutions, this paper points out more on how to judge the dynamic responses (e. g. FRFs) together with the visual inspection of existing conditions from the field experience. Examples of testing results representing the deficient integrity are additionally highlighted. Based on the results, the impact excitation technique is an efficient method susceptible to the structural integrity of railway <b>track</b> <b>structures...</b>|$|R
2500|$|Where it is {{critical}} to reduce noise and vibration, the concrete slab can be supported on soft resilient bearings. This configuration, called [...] "floating slab track", is expensive and requires more depth or height in the <b>track</b> <b>structure,</b> but it can reduce noise and vibration by around 80%. GERB quote up to 35-40dB of attenuation using their steel sprung system. Alternatively, the rail can be supported along its length by an elastic material; when combined with a smaller rail section, this can provide a significant noise reduction over traditional ballasted track.|$|E
2500|$|Track ballast {{forms the}} {{trackbed}} upon which railroad ties (sleepers) are laid. It is packed between, below, {{and around the}} ties. [...] It is used to bear the load from the railroad ties, to facilitate drainage of water, and also to keep down vegetation that might interfere with the <b>track</b> <b>structure.</b> This also serves to hold the track in place as the trains roll by. It is typically made of crushed stone, although ballast has sometimes consisted of other, less suitable materials, for example burnt clay.

2500|$|It was {{initially}} {{believed that the}} top of the viaduct was composed of solid granite blocks (originally carrying a single track). [...] After the track and ballast were removed from the structure, troughs were discovered recessed into the granite capstones. [...] The 18" [...] deep troughs ran {{the entire length of the}} viaduct and were spaced approximately 56" [...] apart (standard railroad gauge). [...] In some locations, the trough contained a solid piece of oak, including some abandoned spikes. [...] It is believed the troughs held wooden sleepers for the original single track railroad. [...] These loose materials were removed from the deck, and lean concrete was placed to fill the voids. [...] Archival photographs of the sleepers were taken and their remnants will be turned over to the local historical commission. [...] At the approaches to the viaduct, a series of granite walls were uncovered running perpendicular to the tracks. [...] These walls were approximately 7' on center, and it was thought that they might have carried a timber approach structure. [...] The locations of the walls conflicted with new abutments for the PPC beams, and they made it difficult to install sheet piling for the contractor's support of excavation system. [...] The walls were left in place undisturbed beneath the new <b>track</b> <b>structure.</b> [...] HDR, Inc. redesigned the abutments to minimize their depths, eliminate the conflicts and reduce the loading of the temporary support of excavation system.|$|E

Polyclonal antibodies against the isolated HSPG were raised by two separate techniques, both producing highly reactive antisera.

At high magnification of the EHS tumor matrix, the gold particles were found over 5 nm wide sets of parallel lines, referred to as "double tracks" (Inoue et al., 1989). When HSPG was incubated in 50 mM Tris buffer, pH 7. 4, at 35 $ sp circ$C for either 5 min or 1 hr, a precipitate resulted which was made up of 5 - 6 nm wide sets of parallel lines, similar to double <b>track</b> <b>structures.</b> Together these studies demonstrate that HSPG of the EHS tumor matrix is made up of double <b>track</b> <b>structures,</b> and that in vitro incubation of HSPG produces double <b>track</b> <b>structures</b> in as short a time as 5 min...|$|R

40|$|The talk {{describes}} an innovative method to simultaneously estimate motion and <b>track</b> a <b>structure</b> on an image sequence. To process noisy images, assumptions on dynamics should be involved. Consequently, the method {{relies on the}} dynamics equations of the studied physical system. The issue of <b>tracking</b> a <b>structure</b> has been largely studied in the image processing literature, see Yilmaz et al. [1]. In Papadakis et al. [2], a method that computes motion field and <b>tracks</b> a <b>structure,</b> based on an incremental 4 D-Var approach, is described. But it requires an accurate segmentation of the structure on the whole image sequence. On the other hand, our method only necessitates an approximate segmentation of the object on the first image. To our knowledge, no paper de-scribes such a method that, only based on image data and a rough segmentation, simultaneously estimates motion and segments/tracks a structure.
