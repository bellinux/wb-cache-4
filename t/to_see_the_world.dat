5|$|Born in Conegliano, Veneto, Del Piero {{is the son}} of Gino, an electrician, and Bruna, a housekeeper. He {{regularly}} {{played football}} in the backyard with two friends, Nelso and Pierpaolo, as a child. All three dreamed of becoming footballers, but only Alessandro would eventually manage to do so. Alessandro's older brother, Stefano, briefly played professional football for Sampdoria before an injury curtailed his career; he later worked as Alessandro's agent. The family lived in the hamlet of Saccon, a rural home in San Vendemiano. While growing up, Del Piero's family did not have much money for travelling abroad, so he considered being a lorry driver in order <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b>|$|E
5|$|The 1881 {{world tour}} of King Kalākaua of the Kingdom of Hawaii was {{his attempt to}} save the Hawaiian culture and {{population}} from extinction through the importation of a labor force from Asia-Pacific nations. His efforts brought the small island nation {{to the attention of}} world leaders, but sparked rumors that the kingdom was for sale. In Hawaii there were critics who believed the labor negotiations were just his excuse <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> The 281-day trip gave him the distinction of being the first monarch to circumnavigate the globe, just as his 1874 travels had made him the first reigning monarch to visit America and the first honoree of a state dinner at the White House.|$|E
25|$|Millennium {{featured}} Frank Black, {{a freelance}} forensic profiler and former FBI agent {{with a unique}} ability <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> {{through the eyes of}} serial killers and murderers, though he says that he is not psychic. Black worked for the mysterious Millennium Group, whose power and sinister agenda were explored throughout the series.|$|E
50|$|In {{the movie}} National Lampoon's Vacation, Clark W. Griswold {{mentions}} departing {{the route of}} travel <b>to</b> Liberal <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>world's</b> largest house of mud. The idea is rejected by his wife, Ellen, in favor of getting to her cousin Eddie's home.|$|R

50|$|In the {{historic}} Karaköy (Galata) district towards {{the southern end}} of the avenue, it is possible <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>world's</b> second-oldest subway station, generally known and referred to as simply Tünel (The Tunnel) which entered service in 1875. Moreover, one of the finest educational institutions established in Turkey, the German High School of Istanbul (Deutsche Schule Istanbul in German, Özel Alman Lisesi in Turkish) is also located near Tünel.|$|R
25|$|Prior to the {{building}} of the transcontinental railway, Portland’s {{contact with the outside world}} – California or the eastern US – was largely by sea. These journeys took a long time: they were made for business; to replenish stocks; visits to family; education in the East; or <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> Even the inland routes were largely along rivers.|$|E
25|$|We {{knew that}} we had created a new means of warfare, and the {{question}} as to what nation, to what victorious nation we were willing to entrust this brainchild of ours was a moral decision more than anything else. We wanted <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> spared another conflict such as Germany had just been through, and we felt that only by surrendering such a weapon to people who are guided by the Bible could such an assurance to the world be best secured.|$|E
25|$|Alcohol can {{alleviate}} the drinker’s feelings of stress or anxiety. Alcohol myopia limits those {{under the influence}} of alcohol <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> through a nearsighted lens; in other words, consumption of alcohol will lead individuals to temporarily forget about previous worries or problems, for these feelings lay outside of the restricted set of immediate cues that the drinker can respond to. By depriving him of the attention capacity necessary to process undesirable thoughts, alcohol myopia can bring the drinker a sense of relief.|$|E
5000|$|Mac {{confesses to}} a priest how he gained his weight, {{and why the}} blame falls on his friends. The gang rush to <b>the</b> movie theater <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>world's</b> {{greatest}} action movie, but must avoid traffic caused by President Obama's trip to Philly. The gang attend their high school reunion and are humiliated by the [...] "cool kids" [...] and other former enemies. They then take revenge on their enemies {{in the form of}} a dance routine.|$|R
50|$|Mao Nome: Sara's younger sister. Cheerful and outgoing, {{and longing}} <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> outside <b>world.</b> Also {{has a very}} obvious crush on Shynn. Voiced by Yuuka Nanri.|$|R
60|$|The mid-day {{dinner at}} Pupp's was <b>the</b> time <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> Carlsbad <b>world,</b> and <b>the</b> Marches had {{the habit of}} sitting long at table to watch it.|$|R
25|$|Apart from Barry, another {{formerly}} stereoblind adult whose acquired {{ability for}} stereopsis has received media attention is neuroscientist Bruce Bridgeman, {{professor of psychology}} and psychobiology at University of California Santa Cruz, {{who had grown up}} nearly stereoblind and acquired stereo vision spontaneously in 2012 at the age of 67, when watching the 3D movie Hugo with polarizing 3D glasses. The scene suddenly appeared to him in depth, and the ability <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> in stereo stayed with him also after leaving the cinema.|$|E
25|$|In 1887 {{he visited}} Austria, Italy and Germany, and {{retired from the}} board of the Itinerants' Society. He painted two portraits of Leo Tolstoy at Yasnaya Polyana that year and made {{preparations}} for his painting Leo Tolstoy Ploughing, and painted Alexander Pushkin on the Shore of the Black Sea (in collaboration with Ivan Aivazovsky). In 1888 he traveled to Southern Russia and the Caucasus, where he did sketches and studies of descendants of the Zaporozhian Cossacks. In 1889 he traveled to Paris <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> Exhibition and then visited London, Zurich, and Munich with Stasov.|$|E
25|$|Munro's {{interest}} in speed began {{at an early}} age, riding the family's fastest horse across the farm, despite the complaints of his father. Trips via train to the port at Invercargill were a rare source of excitement, {{and the arrival of}} cars, motorcycles and aircraft added to Burt's eagerness to join the world outside his farm. As Munro's family discouraged his endeavours outside farm life, he became constantly bored with daily routine. At the outbreak of the First World War, he intended to go to war {{as soon as he was}} old enough, for a chance <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b>|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Plankton {{checks out}} the armory vault, intent on using the city's lost weapons (the Atlanteans had {{abandoned}} the idea of warfare long ago) for his own ends. He then chooses his weapon, a tank. Finally, SpongeBob and Patrick get <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>world's</b> oldest living bubble. Patrick takes a picture of it, which causes the bubble to pop. They are afraid to speak, saying {{they have to go}} back to Bikini Bottom. Then, Patrick shouts out the [...] "truth." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{syndrome}} {{is the main}} theme of Malaysian movie [...] "Desolasi" [...] (Desolation), where the patients live in their own world of imagination, while unable <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> real <b>world.</b>|$|R
60|$|With that Grandfather Frog dived {{into the}} Smiling Pool, swam across {{to a place}} where the bank was low, and without once looking back started across <b>the</b> Green Meadows <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> Great <b>World.</b>|$|R
25|$|Another famous {{philosophy}} is that formulated by Nachman of Breslov and adhered to by Breslov Hasidim. In contrast {{to most of}} his peers who believed God must be worshiped through joy, Nachman portrayed the corporeal world in grim colors, as a place devoid of God's immediate presence from which the soul yearns to liberate itself. He mocked the attempts to perceive the nature of infinite-finite dialectics {{and the manner in}} which God still occupies the Vacant Void albeit not, stating these were paradoxical, beyond human understanding. Only naive faith in their reality would do. Mortals were in constant struggle to overcome their profane instincts, and had to free themselves from their limited intellects <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> as it truly is.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, another sibling of Richard's, Oba Rahl, suffers {{under an}} abusive {{mother on the}} family farm. Oba imagines himself as {{energetic}} and the possessor of a healthy curiosity. His inquisitive nature manifests itself especially through pleasure in watching things die under his hand. Oba does not know that he, along with Jennsen, is pristinely ungifted and immune to magic. His mother sends him to a nearby sorceress to buy medicine, and, during the purchase, he begins to menace the magic user. Her attempts to defend herself with magic fail and Oba kills her brutally. During the fight, Oba surrenders to a voice in his mind that promises invincibility in return for obedience. After returning home, Oba kills his mother and resolves <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> He can travel comfortably with the funds he looted from the sorceress.|$|E
25|$|Another key {{concept in}} social {{cognition}} {{is the assumption}} that reality is too complex to easily discern. As a result, we tend <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> according to simplified schemas or images of reality. Schemas are generalized mental representations that organize knowledge and guide information processing. Schemas often operate automatically and unintentionally, and can lead to biases in perception and memory. Expectations from schemas may lead us to see something that is not there. One experiment found that {{people are more likely to}} misperceive a weapon in the hands of a black man than a white man. This type of schema is actually a stereotype, a generalized set of beliefs about a particular group of people (when incorrect, an ultimate attribution error). Stereotypes are often related to negative or preferential attitudes (prejudice) and behavior (discrimination). Schemas for behaviors (e.g., going to a restaurant, doing laundry) are known as scripts.|$|E
60|$|Flossie and Glossie, being deer of much intelligence, {{had long}} wished <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> great <b>world,</b> so they gladly ran over the frozen snow {{to ask the}} Knooks if they might carry Claus on his journey.|$|R
50|$|She {{is also a}} Trustee of Peace Child International a United Nations {{accredited}} charity that empowers {{young people}} to be the change they want <b>to</b> <b>see</b> in <b>the</b> <b>world</b> through education, employability and entrepreneurship.|$|R
6000|$|... "Chugarum!" [...] said he, [...] "I {{am going}} <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> Great <b>World</b> first, and then I am {{going back to}} the Smiling Pool. Do you happen to know where there is any water? I am very thirsty." ...|$|R
25|$|I was {{lobbying}} at the Council of Europe and at Parliament; I {{was over}} in Washington, in Jo'burg, in South America. It was 'let's get guns for the Contras', that sort of stuff. I was enjoying it immensely, I got to go with these guys and fire off AK-47s. I always like to go where the action is, and for that period in the Reagan/Thatcher days, it was great fun, it was all expenses paid and I got <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> I {{used to think that}} World Briefing was a bit funny. The only scary thing about those publications was the mailing listpeople like George Bushand the fact that Hart would talk to the head of British Intelligence for an hour. I used to think it was us having a laugh, putting some loony right-wing sell in, and that somebody somewhere was taking it seriously. You've got to understand that we had a sense of humour about this.|$|E
25|$|Empathy {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} aspects of humanistic therapy. This idea focuses on the therapist’s ability <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> through the eyes of the client. Without this, therapists can be forced to apply an external frame of reference where the therapist is no longer understanding the actions and thoughts of the client as the client would, but strictly as a therapist which defeats the purpose of humanistic therapy. Included in empathizing, unconditional positive regard {{is one of the}} key elements of humanistic psychology. Unconditional positive regard refers to the care that the therapist needs to have for the client. This ensures that the therapist does not become the authority figure in the relationship allowing for a more open flow of information as well as a kinder relationship between the two. A therapist practicing humanistic therapy needs to show a willingness to listen and ensure the comfort of the patient where genuine feelings may be shared but are not forced upon someone. Marshall Rosenberg, one of Carl Rogers' students, emphasizes empathy in the relationship in his concept of Nonviolent Communication.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} is about a desire to view people as God would, and was [...] "inspired by people-watching at an airport". Heath has said, [...] " [...] a song about my own {{convictions}} for wanting <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> with compassionate eyes." ...|$|E
50|$|After {{giving the}} {{character}} Leon (Jamie Davis) a potion of Ella's {{to allow him}} <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> spirit <b>world,</b> <b>the</b> three form a group who fight against Malachi - the series' main antagonist in wake of Azazeal's mid-season departure.|$|R
50|$|Cut to the {{flashback}} a {{few months}} ago: In Madurai, where Kottai's mother (Saranya Ponvannan) is cutting down logs, and boasting about her son: he is a god who deserves <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> outside <b>world</b> and derive its benefits.|$|R
5000|$|The mock in this mockumentary is {{targeted}} towards the west. This film highlights the ignorance and disinterest of the Western cultures towards [...] "other" [...] cultures. The [...] "West" [...] here {{is shown to}} take {{the culture of the}} Filipino people, completely change and misconstrue it, and then to exhibit this inaccuracy in front of millions, who believe that it is real. The easiness with which the American people believe this lie put before them, just shows the gullibility and ignorance of these audiences at <b>the</b> <b>World's</b> Fair. This mock offers the viewer another angle <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>World's</b> Fair by, and it isn't a pretty one.|$|R
500|$|People Magazine Daily {{noted that}} the film [...] "mainly had a music {{supervised}} soundtrack, but {{not much of a}} score, so there were popular songs placed in the movie." [...] Peter Travers, of Rolling Stone, described [...] "I Can See In Color" [...] as being [...] "a knockout song...expressing the goal of Precious <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> in color." ...|$|E
500|$|Not {{everybody}} was enthusiastic about Kalākaua's journey. In Hawaii's Story, Liliuokalani defended her brother's efforts {{against those who}} she felt [...] "grossly misjudged and even slandered" [...] him. She gave no names, but said {{there were those who}} believed, or wanted to persuade others to believe, that Kalākaua was using labor immigration as a cover story to gratify his selfish desire <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b>|$|E
500|$|The song {{is about}} wanting <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> as God would, {{and having a}} desire to view people with more compassion. [...] "Give Me Your Eyes" [...] was written by Heath and {{songwriter}} Jason Ingram, and was generally well received by critics. The song received two GMA Dove Awards in April 2009, including the Song of the Year title. It was also Grammy Award-nominated in the Best Gospel Song category for 2009.|$|E

6000|$|But Grandfather Frog {{was set in}} his ways, {{and nothing}} that Danny Meadow Mouse could say changed his mind in the least. [...] "I started out <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> Great <b>World,</b> and I'm going to keep right on," [...] said he.|$|R
5000|$|Interest in sideshows {{declined}} {{as television}} {{made it easy}} (and free) <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>world's</b> most exotic attractions. Moreover, viewing [...] "human oddities" [...] became distasteful as the public conscience changed, and many localities passed laws forbidding the exhibition of freaks. The performers often protested (to no avail) {{that they had no}} objection to the sideshow, especially since it provided not only a good income for them, but in many cases it provided their only possible job. The sideshow seemed destined for oblivion, until only a few exemplars of the ten-in-one remained. A greater number of [...] "Single O" [...] attractions still tour carnivals.|$|R
