5|$|Additionally, {{the company}} sells beer at the Whopper Bar locations, {{including}} Budweiser, Bud Light, and Miller Lite in aluminum bottles designed to maintain temperature. The move, designed {{to target the}} important 30-and-under demographic, has been called risky by industry analysts because the company {{is known as a}} fast food purveyor and not as an alcoholic beverages seller. Other industry consultants have disagreed with the assessment, believing that <b>the</b> <b>move</b> <b>is</b> timely because the company is growing with its aging customer base.|$|E
5|$|If {{a player}} moves a pawn to its eighth rank, it cannot be {{substituted}} for a different move of the pawn when the player has stopped touching it. However, <b>the</b> <b>move</b> <b>is</b> not complete until the promoted piece is released on that square.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, Nebraska lawmakers moved Offutt Air Force Base and {{the town}} of Bellevue — an area with a large {{minority}} population — out of the Omaha-based 2nd District and shifted in the Republican-heavy Omaha suburbs in Sarpy County. <b>The</b> <b>move</b> <b>is</b> expected to dilute the city's urban Democratic vote.|$|E

5000|$|On July 17 {{parliament}} {{approved a}} major cabinet reshuffle. <b>The</b> <b>move</b> <b>was</b> to [...] "optimize the government's work" [...] according to foreign minister Solomon Passy. <b>The</b> <b>move</b> <b>was</b> announced against <b>the</b> backdrop of sliding approval ratings.|$|R
5|$|In March 2015, the Museum of London {{revealed}} {{plans to}} vacate its Barbican site {{and move into}} the General Market Building. The cost of <b>the</b> <b>move</b> <b>is</b> estimated {{to be in the}} region of £70 million and, if funding can be achieved, would be complete by 2021.|$|E
5|$|Zugzwang, disadvantageous {{since it}} forces {{a player to}} move, is often a factor in endgames but rarely in other stages of the game. In the example diagram, either side having <b>the</b> <b>move</b> <b>is</b> in zugzwang: Black to move must play 1...Kb7 {{allowing}} White to promote the pawn after 2.Kd7; White to move must permit a draw, either by 1.Kc6 stalemate or by losing the pawn after any other legal move.|$|E
5|$|Exceptions {{to these}} naming {{patterns}} {{are found in}} languages that designate the move by making reference to a location, such as the Norwegian brassespark (Brazilian kick). This exception is most significant in Spanish, where a fierce controversy exists between Chile and Peru—as part of their historic sports rivalry—over the naming of the bicycle kick; Chileans know it as the chilenita, while Peruvians call it the chalaca. Regardless, <b>the</b> <b>move</b> <b>is</b> also known in Spanish by the less tendentious names of tijera and tijereta—both {{a reference to the}} manoeuvre's scissor-like motion.|$|E

5|$|For {{many years}} Burger King has sold beer {{in several of}} its {{international}} locations, such as Germany, but not in its home territory. The company began to sell beer at its BK Whopper Bar limited service concept restaurants in Miami, New York, and Los Angeles in 2010. The company is selling products from SABMiller and Anheuser-Busch, including Budweiser, Bud Lite, and Miller Lite in aluminum bottles designed to maintain temperature.

5|$|With {{the opening}} of its Whopper Bar {{locations}} in the United States during 2010, Burger King reported {{that it would be}} the first time in its North American locations that beer would be available for purchase. Although beer is available at fast food restaurants throughout Europe, including Burger King, this is the first time a major fast food chain has attempted to sell beer in the United States. The company will be selling products from SABMiller and Anheuser-Busch including Budweiser, Bud Lite and Miller Lite in aluminum bottles designed to maintain temperature.

5000|$|When listing <b>the</b> <b>moves</b> of a game, first <b>the</b> <b>move</b> number <b>is</b> written, then <b>the</b> <b>move</b> by White {{followed}} by <b>the</b> <b>move</b> by Black.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>move</b> <b>was</b> {{banned in}} WWE in 2005 for safety reasons, as <b>the</b> <b>move</b> can easily <b>be</b> botched and cause serious injury, {{much like the}} {{shooting}} star press and piledriver.|$|R
25|$|On 21 April 2009, {{the prime}} {{minister}} Najib Tun Razak has announced the liberalisation of 27 services sub-sector by abolishing the 30% bumiputera requirement. <b>The</b> <b>move</b> <b>is</b> seen as the government efforts to increase investment {{in the service sector}} of the economy.

25|$|In April 2007, {{attorney}} and then {{leader of the}} opposition Dean Barrow wrote Amandala requesting payment on a loan accruing to some $262,000 procured from Sagis Investments, a company apparently owned by Lord Michael Ashcroft.

5000|$|Genge {{began his}} {{professional}} career at Bristol, before gaining {{the attention of}} Richard Cockerill, moving to Leicester Tigers on loan in January 2016. [...] <b>The</b> <b>move</b> <b>was</b> made permanent {{at the end of}} May 2016. The reason for <b>the</b> <b>move</b> <b>was</b> attributed to off-field issues, including being arresting after an away game against Ulster in 2015.|$|R
50|$|In 1997, <b>the</b> club <b>was</b> <b>moved</b> to Suceava {{after it}} won the {{promotion}} to the Divizia A {{for the first}} time in history. The main reason for <b>the</b> <b>move</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> inadequate state of Foresta's stadium in Fălticeni, which was both small and had a cracked stand. Another reason for <b>the</b> <b>move</b> <b>was,</b> that <b>the</b> main team in the city, CSM Suceava had failed to achieve any notable performances during the previous decade.|$|R
25|$|When {{a player}} makes a move {{such that the}} opponent's king could be {{captured}} on the following move, <b>the</b> <b>move</b> <b>is</b> said to give check to the king; the king {{is said to be}} in check.

25|$|Drop kick: Kicking a ball after {{bouncing}} {{it on the}} ground. Although {{rarely used}} today, {{it has the same}} status in scoring as a place kick. This play is part of the game's rugby heritage, and was largely made obsolete when the ball with pointed ends was adopted. Unlike the American game, Canadian rules allow a drop kick to be attempted at any time by any player, but <b>the</b> <b>move</b> <b>is</b> very rare.|$|E
25|$|Another likely {{reason for}} <b>the</b> <b>move</b> <b>is</b> that CKY had more space than it needed. With WTN, CITI-FM and CKY-FM {{moving to new}} studios in recent years, plus the {{reduction}} of local, in-studio programming on CKY-TV since 1991, a new, although smaller, facility suited CKY-TV's needs. In recent years, CKY has allowed studio space to be rented for third-party productions, including the locally produced film Blue State. The station marked its 50th anniversary in 2010.|$|E

25|$|In chess, the {{distance}} between squares on the chessboard for rooks is measured in taxicab distance; kings and queens use Chebyshev distance, and bishops use the taxicab distance (between squares of the same color) on the chessboard rotated 45 degrees, i.e., with its diagonals as coordinate axes. To reach from one square to another, only kings require the number of moves equal to {{the distance}}; rooks, queens and bishops require one or two moves (on an empty board, and assuming that <b>the</b> <b>move</b> <b>is</b> possible {{at all in the}} bishop's case).|$|E

They then outstretch their right arm inline with their right shoulder, hand flat in a vertical position. The dancer then rotates around the waist in a 180 degree sweep, pulling back three times as you move your arm to the left, and then in one motion swing right arm back to the right. <b>The</b> <b>move</b> <b>is</b> then repeated. The dancer may then swap arms and reverse the move.|$|E
