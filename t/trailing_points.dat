25|$|Train 2D57, the 19:09 {{service from}} London Waterloo to Effingham Junction, became derailed on the {{approach}} to Epsom at about 19:42 on Tuesday 12 September 2006. The train was formed of two four-car class 455 electric multiple units (EMUs). The leading bogie of the fourth coach was derailed towards the left as it passed over a set of <b>trailing</b> <b>points</b> on a right-hand curve at about 17 miles per hour (27km/h). The train {{came to a stop}} partially in Epsom station, and passengers were quickly evacuated onto the platform. There were no injuries, and there was only minor damage to the train and the track.|$|E
25|$|A start {{was made}} in April on {{building}} the new depot at Carter Gate (Parliament Street), with accommodation for buses, trams and trolleybuses. Trams were given eight roads, all with pits, the capacity being 80 cars. A most complicated layout of track leading to the depot was put in at same time, the intention being to build a single line for one-way traffic inward to the Market Place along Lower Parliament Street and Hockley, via Victoria Street and South Parade, the outward route, also single line and one-way traffic via Long Row and Pelham Street to Hockley. Hockley was a narrow thoroughfare that had been widened towards its junction with Lower Parliament Street, but, owing to the Corporation being unable to obtain a property higher up the street at a reasonable price, the whole scheme was later abandoned, although not before much track and pointwork had been laid. The double turnout {{at the bottom of}} Hockley had been in position for approximately six months when it was removed together with the short length of track leading to it, no car ever having run over it. Lines built in connection with the depot were along Southwell Road, with a three-way junction at Manvers Street, another three-way junction at Lower Parliament Street, and then along Lower Parliament Street to within 30 yards of Pennyfoot Street. There were <b>trailing</b> <b>points</b> from both lines into Stanhope Street, where the depot entrances were. A single line ran along Stanhope Street, with trailing junctions both ways into Manvers Street.|$|E

5000|$|The Torrey Pines State Natural Reserve offers 8 trails to hikers {{that vary}} {{in terms of}} length, difficulty, and scenery. San Diego Tourism Authority says that three popular trails at the park are Guy Fleming <b>Trail,</b> Razor <b>Point</b> <b>Trail,</b> and Beach Trail. The Guy Fleming Trail is 0.7 miles and is the easiest trail at the park. The trail {{provides}} diverse scenery from Peñasquitos Marsh to views of La Jolla and {{is well known for}} whale sightings in the winter. The Razor <b>Point</b> <b>Trail</b> is a 1.4-mile loop that provides hikers with a view of ravines and badlands while overlooking the ocean. The Beach Trail is a ¾ mile walk that leads one down to the Torrey Pines State Beach. Although it is the least scenic trail, it is very popular due to taking hikers straight to the wide-open beach. Other trails at the park are the Parry Grove <b>Trail,</b> Yucca <b>Point</b> <b>Trail,</b> High <b>Point</b> <b>Trail,</b> Broken Hill Trail, and Discovery Trail.

From the gate the railway crosses Odin Street extending in a large curve to the south, terminating at an earth stop block; and to the west, terminating at a raised concrete loading bank. A triangle is formed by a section of track that links the southern and western extensions before their termination. <b>Trailing</b> <b>points</b> are positioned on the southern and western corners of the turning triangle.

He felt a judder, and looked back, observing blue flashesand smoke {{from the rear of the}} train. He assumed there was a fault with the train, andattempted to coast into the station. As the fourth coach came into his field of vision, thedriver saw that it was derailed and made an emergency brake application. The train thenstopped within five seconds.In the report by the Rail Accident Investigation Branch into the accident, the maintenance of track and points was heavily criticised. The removal of a remote rail lubricator by Network Rail was also criticised.|$|E

The collision completely destroyed the three wooden bodied coaches {{at the rear of the}} local train (where most of the casualties occurred), telescoping them into the length of one coach, and drove the entire train forward 20 yd. The leading two vans and three coaches of the Perth train piled up behind and above the locomotive.The wreckage from the first collision was spread across the adjacent down fast line. A few seconds after the first collision, the northbound express to [...] passed through the station on this line in the opposite direction at approximately 60 mph. The leading locomotive of this train struck the derailed locomotive of the Perth train and derailed itself. The two locomotives from the Liverpool train were diverted left, mounting the platform, which they ploughed across diagonally before landing on their side on the adjacent DC electric line, one line of which was short circuited by the wreckage; the other line had its electric current quickly switched off by the signalman, thus preventing any further collisions. The leading seven coaches, plus a kitchen car from the Liverpool train, were carried forward by momentum, overriding the existing wreckage and piling up above and around it. Several of these coaches struck the underside of the station footbridge, tearing away a steel girder.|$|E
