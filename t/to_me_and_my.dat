In a polemic entitled [...] "Milton Friedman Unraveled", he maligned Friedman as a [...] "statist", a [...] "favorite of the establishment", a friend of and [...] "apologist" [...] for Richard Nixon, and a [...] "pernicious influence" [...] on public policy. Rothbard said that libertarians should scorn rather than celebrate Friedman's academic prestige and political influence. Noting that Rothbard has [...] "been nasty <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> work", Friedman responded to Rothbard's criticism by calling him a [...] "cult builder and a dogmatist." ...|$|E
500|$|When Peter regained enough {{strength}} he {{told his}} story, which Johnston later wrote down and is now kept with his papers at Duke University. Peter had been a slave of a Mr. Read in Charlotte County, a neighbor of John Randolph. He had been sold (apparently because of Read's debts) to a trader, leaving behind a wife and young daughter to work a cotton field for thirty-five years in Mississippi. When he was freed, Peter walked from Mississippi until he reached Abingdon in his quest to return home. Johnston wrote: [...] "It was evident <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> wife that all our care could not rebuild that worn-out body, and that death was near at hand. He weakened rapidly ... His life was weary, toilsome, and full of trouble. But surely the Lord has rewards for such as he, and will give him rest in all eternity, and permit him to see Susy and his Mammy and Daddy." [...] Peter died of tuberculosis.|$|E
500|$|The 17th was {{deployed}} for the Battle of the Somme in July. It {{was engaged}} {{on the first}} day of the Somme, 1 July, where it supported the capture of Fricourt and lost 1,155 men killed or wounded. Following this, it was involved in the capture of Contalmaison and the capture of Mametz, and had taken a total of 4,771 casualties by the time it was relieved on 11 July. Many of these casualties stemmed from an unsuccessful attack on the [...] "Quadrangle Trench Support" [...] on 7 July; the division had captured the main trench system on 5 July and Pilcher ordered it to pause and prepare for a subsequent assault. However, he was over-ruled by higher command, who forced an attack the next night – which failed – followed by a daylight attack on 7 July, which Pilcher strongly protested but eventually acquiesced in. He ordered an attack with the minimal number of men necessary, assuming it would inevitably be doomed to failure and high casualties, which outraged his superiors. Pilcher later wrote that [...] "It is very easy to sit a few miles in the rear and get credit for allowing men to be killed in an undertaking foredoomed to failure, but the part did not appeal <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> protests against these useless attacks were not well received." ...|$|E

2500|$|The couple {{remained}} childless. When Sir Edward Bromley died in 1626, disputes {{about the}} inheritance {{of the family}} estates had already begun. The codicil to his will showed {{that he had been}} forced to sacrifice some of the lands he had intended as part of Lady Margaret's jointure to placate the Davenports, his great-niece and her husband, who were ultimately to acquire the main estate at Hallon, next to Worfield, after protracted litigation. As compensation, he left her all his moveable property, although he had originally intended to give her only the use of it during her life and the right to bequeath £400-worth in her own will. For everything not relating to the property dispute, Lady Margaret was appointed executrix. Sir Edward set aside £100 for a monument [...] "to be set up in Shifnall Church, or elsewhere, <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> wife Dame Margaret." [...] However, he directed that his burial itself be [...] "without funeral pompe," [...] probably an indication of Puritan views. He was buried in the church at Worfield, where his wife subsequently had the prescribed monument built, with an inscription attesting her role: [...] "Dame Margaret his wife according to his will did dedicate This monument to his memory." ...|$|E
2500|$|Supporters for {{ratification}} of the Constitution {{became known as the}} Federalist Party. Those in opposition were labeled Anti-Federalists, but neither group was a political party in the modern sense. Following ratification and formation of the first government in 1789, two new political factions formed along similar lines as the old division. The supporters of Alexander Hamilton's attempts to strengthen the national government called themselves Federalists, while those who opposed Hamilton called themselves [...] "Republicans" [...] (later historians would refer to them as the Democratic-Republican Party). Madison and other Republican Party organizers, who favored states' rights and local control, were struggling to find an institutional solution to the Constitution's seeming inability to prevent concentration of power in an administrative republic. As first Secretary of the Treasury, Hamilton created many new federal institutions, including the Bank of the United States. Madison led the unsuccessful attempt in Congress to block Hamilton's proposal, arguing that the new Constitution did not explicitly allow the federal government to form a bank. As early as May 26, 1792, Hamilton complained, [...] "Mr. Madison cooperating with Mr. Jefferson is {{at the head of a}} faction decidedly hostile <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> administration." [...] As Hamilton's influence in the administration grew, Madison and Jefferson increasingly came to fear the possible restoration of a monarchy, and they worked together to build an opposition to Hamilton's policies. By the end of Washington's term, most Congressmen identified as either Democratic-Republicans or Federalists.|$|E

2500|$|Sorge {{arrived in}} Yokohama on 6 September 1933. After landing in Japan, Sorge became the Japan {{correspondent}} for the Frankfurter Zeitung. As the Frankfurter Zeitung was the most prestigious newspaper in Germany, Sorge's status as the Tokyo {{correspondent for the}} Frankfurter Zeitung made him {{in many ways the}} most senior German reporter in Japan. Sorge's reputation as a Nazi journalist who detested the Soviet Union served as an excellent [...] "cover" [...] for his espionage work. Sorge was told by his GRU superiors that his mission in Japan was to [...] "give very careful study {{to the question of whether}} or not Japan was planning to attack the USSR". After his arrest in 1941, Sorge told his captors: [...] "This was for many years the most important duty assigned <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> group; it would not be far wrong to say that it was the sole object of my mission in Japan...The USSR, as it viewed the prominent role and attitude taken by the Japanese military in foreign policy after the Manchurian incident, had come to harbor a deeply implanted suspicion that Japan was planning to attack the Soviet Union, a suspicion so strong that my frequently expressed opinions to the contrary were not always fully appreciated in Moscow..." [...] He was warned by his commanders not to have contact with the underground Japanese Communist Party or with the Soviet Embassy in Tokyo. His intelligence network in Japan included Red Army officer and radio operator Max Clausen, Hotsumi Ozaki, and two other Comintern agents, Branko Vukelić, a journalist working for the French magazine, Vu, and a Japanese journalist, Miyagi Yotoku, who was employed by the English-language newspaper, the Japan Advertiser. Max Clausen's wife Anna acted as ring courier from time to time. From summer 1937, Clausen operated under cover of his business, M Clausen Shokai, suppliers of blueprint machinery and reproduction services. The business had been set up with Soviet funds but in time became a commercial success. Ozaki was a Japanese man from an very influential family who had grown up in Taiwan (at the time a Japanese colony) and was an idealistic Sinophile who believed that Japan, which had started its modernization with the Meiji Restoration, had much to teach China. However, the Sinophile Ozaki was shocked by the racism of Japanese policy towards China with the Chinese being depicted as a people fit only to be slaves. Ozaki believed that the existing political system of Japan with the emperor being worshipped as a living god had to go, and to save Japan from fascism required that Japan be [...] "reconstructed as a socialist state".|$|E
