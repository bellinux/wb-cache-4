5|$|A {{solar eclipse}} (as {{seen from the}} planet Earth) {{is a type of}} eclipse that occurs when the Moon passes between <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> and Earth, and when the Moon fully or {{partially}} blocks ("occults") <b>the</b> <b>Sun.</b> This can happen only at new moon when <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> and the Moon are in conjunction as seen from Earth in an alignment referred to as syzygy. In a total eclipse, the disk of <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> is fully obscured by the Moon. In partial and annular eclipses, only part of <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> is obscured.|$|E
5|$|A transit of Venus across <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> {{takes place}} when the planet Venus passes {{directly}} between <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> and a superior planet, becoming visible against (and hence obscuring {{a small portion}} of) the solar disk. During a transit, Venus {{can be seen from}} Earth as a small black disk moving across the face of <b>the</b> <b>Sun.</b> The duration of such transits is usually several hours (the transit of 2012 lasted 6 hours and 40 minutes). A transit is similar to a solar eclipse by the Moon. While the diameter of Venus is more than 3 times that of the Moon, Venus appears smaller, and travels more slowly across the face of <b>the</b> <b>Sun,</b> because it is much farther away from Earth.|$|E
5|$|After fusing helium in {{its core}} to carbon, <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> {{will begin to}} {{collapse}} again, evolving into a compact white dwarf star after ejecting its outer atmosphere as a planetary nebula. In 50 billion years, if the Earth and Moon are not engulfed by <b>the</b> <b>Sun,</b> they will become tidelocked, with each showing only one face to the other. Thereafter, the tidal action of <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> will extract angular momentum from the system, causing the lunar orbit to decay and the Earth's spin to accelerate.|$|E
5000|$|In Game 3 of the NBA Finals, <b>the</b> <b>Suns</b> {{defeated}} <b>the</b> Bulls in triple overtime, 129-121. This {{marked the}} second time a Finals game lasted three overtimes, along with Game 5 of the 1976 Finals, which also involved <b>the</b> <b>Suns.</b> Coincidentally, in <b>the</b> 1976 game, Paul Westphal played for <b>the</b> <b>Suns,</b> and in <b>the</b> 1993 game, he coached <b>the</b> <b>Suns.</b>|$|R
50|$|The 2000-01 NBA {{season was}} the 33rd season for <b>the</b> Phoenix <b>Suns,</b> members of <b>the</b> Pacific Division in the National Basketball Association. During <b>the</b> offseason, <b>the</b> <b>Suns</b> signed free agents Mario Elie and Tony Delk. <b>The</b> <b>Suns</b> were coached by Scott Skiles, who enjoyed {{his first full}} season as head coach as <b>the</b> <b>Suns</b> {{finished}} <b>the</b> regular season with a 51-31 record. For a franchise-record 13th season in a row, <b>the</b> <b>Suns</b> earned {{a trip to the}} playoffs, but would later lose in the first round. America West Arena was the home court venue for <b>the</b> <b>Suns.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> 2010-11 Phoenix <b>Suns</b> season [...] was the 43rd {{season for}} <b>the</b> Phoenix <b>Suns</b> of <b>the</b> National Basketball Association (NBA). For {{the first time}} in eight seasons, <b>the</b> <b>Suns</b> will be without the play of power forward Amar'e Stoudemire, a 5-time All-Star and former Rookie of the Year who joined the New York Knicks in <b>the</b> summer. <b>The</b> <b>Suns</b> traded Jason Richardson on December 18, 2010 as part of a trade that brought Vince Carter to <b>the</b> <b>Suns.</b> On February 24, 2011, <b>the</b> <b>Suns</b> traded Goran Dragić and the draft pick they got earlier from Orlando in {{exchange}} for Aaron Brooks. Alvin Gentry was head coach and <b>the</b> <b>Suns</b> played their home games at US Airways Center.|$|R
5|$|Afternoon is a {{time when}} <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> is {{descending}} from its daytime peak. During the afternoon, <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> moves from roughly the center of the sky to deep in the west. In late afternoon, sunlight is particularly bright and glaring, because <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> is at a low angle in the sky. The standard working time in most industrialized countries goes from the morning to the late afternoon or evening—archetypally, 9 am to 5 pm—so the latter part of this time takes place in the afternoon. Schools usually let out during the afternoon as well.|$|E
5|$|Again, {{this is a}} simplification, {{based on}} a {{hypothetical}} Earth that orbits at uniform speed around <b>the</b> <b>Sun.</b> The actual speed with which Earth orbits <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> varies slightly during the year, so {{the speed with which}} <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> seems to move along the ecliptic also varies. For example, <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> is north of the celestial equator for about 185 days of each year, and south of it for about 180 days. The variation of orbital speed accounts for part of the equation of time.|$|E
5|$|An annular eclipse {{occurs when}} <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> and Moon are exactly {{in line with}} the Earth, but the {{apparent}} size of the Moon is smaller than that of <b>the</b> <b>Sun.</b> Hence <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> appears as a very bright ring, or annulus, surrounding the dark disk of the Moon.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Toronto <b>Suns</b> format {{has given}} rise to sister Sun tabloids in major markets across Canada, namely <b>the</b> Edmonton <b>Sun,</b> <b>the</b> Calgary <b>Sun,</b> <b>the</b> Ottawa <b>Sun</b> and most {{recently}} <b>the</b> Brampton <b>Sun</b> and York Sun, weekend-only tabloids distributed as sections of the Toronto edition. <b>The</b> Winnipeg <b>Sun</b> was originally launched by independent interests, only later coming under common ownership to <b>the</b> Toronto <b>Sun,</b> which subsequently elicited a redesign in Sun Media style.|$|R
50|$|Colangelo {{was hired}} by <b>the</b> <b>Suns</b> front office in 1991. In 1995, Colangelo succeeded his father as general manager of <b>the</b> <b>Suns.</b>|$|R
50|$|On February 24, 2016, Jenkins was claimed off waivers by <b>the</b> Phoenix <b>Suns.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Suns</b> {{inherited}} Jenkins' {{three-year contract}} with non-guaranteed years of $1.05 million for 2016-17 and $1.18 million for 2017-18. He made his debut for <b>the</b> <b>Suns</b> <b>the</b> following day, scoring two points in four minutes {{off the bench}} against the Brooklyn Nets. During his first season with <b>the</b> <b>Suns,</b> he averaged 5.0 points and a career-high 1.2 assists per game.|$|R
5|$|An {{issue with}} the Hinomaru and {{national}} anthem was raised once again when Tokyo hosted the 1964 Summer Olympic Games. Before the Olympic Games, the size of <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> disc of the national flag was changed partly because <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> disc was not considered striking when it was being flown with other national flags. Tadamasa Fukiura, a color specialist, chose to set <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> disc at {{two thirds of the}} flag's length. Fukiura also chose the flag colors for the 1964 as well as the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano.|$|E
5|$|And {{long before}} <b>the</b> <b>sun.</b>|$|E
5|$|As a red dwarf, Gliese 876 is {{much less}} massive than the Sun: {{estimates}} suggest it has only 32% {{of the mass of}} <b>the</b> <b>Sun.</b> The surface temperature of Gliese 876 is cooler than <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> and the star has a smaller radius. These factors combine to make the star only 1.24% as luminous as <b>the</b> <b>Sun,</b> and most of this is at infrared wavelengths.|$|E
50|$|Del Negro {{worked as}} a radio {{commentator}} for <b>the</b> Phoenix <b>Suns</b> before being promoted to director of player personnel for <b>the</b> <b>Suns</b> in 2006. In 2007, <b>the</b> <b>Suns</b> promoted him {{to the position of}} assistant general manager.|$|R
50|$|On July 15, 2012, after <b>the</b> <b>Suns</b> {{acquired}} <b>the</b> amnestied {{rights of}} Luis Scola, Childress {{was released by}} <b>the</b> <b>Suns</b> via <b>the</b> amnesty clause.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Suns</b> would next {{face-off}} {{against the}} top-seeded Los Angeles Lakers, who finished {{the season with}} a league-best 63-19 record. Coach Cotton Fitzsimmons came into game one with an 0-37 record coaching against the Lakers at the Great Western Forum. <b>The</b> <b>Suns</b> had lost 21 consecutive games at the Forum dating back to 1984. They ended the streak with a 104-102 upset, stealing homecourt advantage. Center Mark West led <b>the</b> <b>Suns</b> with 24 points, 16 rebounds and 7 blocks. The Lakers would recover in game two, blowing out <b>the</b> <b>Suns</b> 100-124 to even the series. After winning games three and four in Phoenix, <b>the</b> <b>Suns</b> returned to <b>the</b> Forum with a 3-1 series lead. Despite an early 15-point lead and a 43-point performance from MVP Magic Johnson, <b>the</b> <b>Suns</b> rallied to a 106-103 victory, behind 37 points from Kevin Johnson.|$|R
5|$|As an A-type main {{sequence}} star, Beta Pictoris is more luminous than the Sun: combining the apparent magnitude of 3.861 with {{the distance of}} 19.44 parsecs gives an absolute magnitude of 2.42, as compared to <b>the</b> <b>Sun,</b> which has an absolute magnitude of 4.83. This corresponds to a visual luminosity 9.2 times {{greater than that of}} <b>the</b> <b>Sun.</b> When the entire spectrum of radiation from Beta Pictoris and <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> is taken into account, Beta Pictoris is found to be 8.7 times more luminous than <b>the</b> <b>Sun.</b>|$|E
5|$|As <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> sets on Mingulay.|$|E
5|$|Asteroseismic {{analysis}} of the star reveals it is approximately 10% more massive than <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> and significantly older, at around 6.34 billion years. The radius of the star is 36% {{greater than that of}} <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> and it is 90% more luminous. The star contains twice the abundance of iron relative to hydrogen of <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> and is therefore described as metal-rich. Mu Arae is also more enriched than <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> in the element helium.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> 1985-86 Phoenix <b>Suns</b> {{season was}} <b>the</b> 18th season for <b>the</b> Phoenix <b>Suns</b> of <b>the</b> National Basketball Association. <b>The</b> <b>Suns</b> {{finished}} <b>the</b> regular season tied with their third-worst record to that point, going just 32-50. Coupled with every {{team in the}} Western Conference's Midwest division finishing with a better record than all but two teams from the Pacific division, and <b>the</b> <b>Suns</b> {{were out of the}} playoffs {{for the first time in}} eight seasons, ending a then-franchise record streak for consecutive playoff berths. <b>The</b> <b>Suns</b> were led by head coach John MacLeod, in his 13th year with <b>the</b> <b>Suns,</b> and played all home games in Arizona Veterans Memorial Coliseum.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Desert <b>Sun</b> publishes <b>the</b> Desert Post Weekly, {{a variety}} {{entertainment}} paper available on every Thursday {{in the distribution}} range, as well as city-specific publications <b>The</b> Indio <b>Sun,</b> <b>The</b> La Quinta <b>Sun,</b> <b>The</b> Palm Springs Weekend, <b>The</b> Palm Desert <b>Sun</b> and <b>The</b> Cathedral City <b>Sun.</b>|$|R
50|$|On October 24, <b>the</b> <b>Suns</b> claimed veteran swingman John Wetzel off of waivers {{from the}} Atlanta Hawks. Wetzel would play {{sparingly}} throughout the season, averaging 6.7 minutes in 37 regular season games, and 2.5 minutes in two playoff games. Wetzel had played for <b>the</b> <b>Suns</b> from 1970 to 1972, and would spend his final season with <b>the</b> <b>Suns</b> {{before retiring in}} August 1976. Wetzel would later become an assistant coach with <b>the</b> <b>Suns</b> from 1979 to 1987, before becoming the team's head coach for the 1987-88 season.|$|R
5|$|Because the Earth's {{orbit around}} <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> is also elliptical, the Earth's {{distance}} from <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> similarly varies throughout the year. This affects the apparent size of <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> {{in the same}} way, {{but not as much}} as does the Moon's varying distance from Earth. When Earth approaches its farthest distance from <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> in early July, a total eclipse is somewhat more likely, whereas conditions favour an annular eclipse when Earth approaches its closest distance to <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> in early January.|$|E
5|$|Dead reckoning, {{navigating}} from a known position {{using only}} information about one's own speed and direction, was suggested by Charles Darwin in 1873 {{as a possible}} mechanism. In the 20th century, Karl von Frisch showed that honey bees can navigate by <b>the</b> <b>sun,</b> by the polarization pattern of the blue sky, and by the earth's magnetic field; of these, they rely on <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> when possible. William Tinsley Keeton showed that homing pigeons could similarly make use {{of a range of}} navigational cues, including <b>the</b> <b>sun,</b> earth's magnetic field, olfaction and vision. Ronald Lockley demonstrated that a species of small seabird, the Manx shearwater, could orient themselves and fly home at full speed, when released far from home, provided either <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> or the stars were visible.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to their}} great {{distance}} from the Earth, all stars except <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> appear to the unaided eye as shining points {{in the night sky}} that twinkle because of the effect of the Earth's atmosphere. <b>The</b> <b>Sun</b> is also a star, but it is close enough to the Earth to appear as a disk instead, and to provide daylight. Other than <b>the</b> <b>Sun,</b> the star with the largest apparent size is R Doradus, with an angular diameter of only 0.057 arcseconds.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Suns</b> made <b>the</b> most {{of these}} moves, winning a {{franchise}} record 62 games. Barkley's efforts won him the MVP award. In {{the first round of}} the Western Conference playoffs, <b>the</b> <b>Suns</b> eliminated <b>the</b> Los Angeles Lakers in five games. In the second round <b>the</b> <b>Suns</b> defeated <b>the</b> San Antonio Spurs in six, and were again pushed to a decisive game by the Seattle SuperSonics before ultimately winning in the conference finals. For <b>the</b> <b>Suns,</b> it was their first NBA finals appearance since 1976 and second overall.|$|R
50|$|On April 1, 2015, McNeal {{signed a}} 10-day {{contract}} with <b>the</b> Phoenix <b>Suns.</b> <b>The</b> following day, {{he made his}} NBA debut, scoring two points in a 107-106 loss to the Golden State Warriors. On April 11, he signed with <b>the</b> <b>Suns</b> through <b>the</b> 2015-16 season. On July 17, 2015, he was waived by <b>the</b> <b>Suns.</b> Despite this, McNeal continued to play for <b>the</b> <b>Suns</b> at <b>the</b> 2015 Las Vegas Summer League, where he averaged 2.1 points and 1.3 rebounds in seven games.|$|R
50|$|January 13, 2015: When <b>the</b> <b>Suns</b> {{had their}} 107-100 {{victory over the}} Cleveland Cavaliers, <b>the</b> <b>Suns</b> would begin their eight-game homestand for January, which marked the longest homestand in {{franchise}} history. This game also marked the Suns' halfway point into the regular season, which came by <b>the</b> <b>Suns</b> much faster {{than most of the}} teams in the NBA.|$|R
5|$|Earth is {{the third}} planet from <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. According to radiometric dating and other sources of evidence, Earth formed over 4 billion years ago. Earth's gravity interacts with other objects in space, {{especially}} <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> and the Moon, Earth's only natural satellite. Earth revolves around <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> in 365.26 days, a period known as an Earth year. During this time, Earth rotates about its axis about 366.26 times.|$|E
5|$|From {{at least}} the 4th Dynasty of Ancient Egypt, <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> was worshipped as the god Ra, portrayed as a falcon-headed divinity surmounted by the solar disk, and {{surrounded}} by a serpent. In the New Empire period, <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> became identified with the dung beetle, whose spherical ball of dung was identified with <b>the</b> <b>Sun.</b> In the form of <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> disc Aten, <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> had a brief resurgence during the Amarna Period when it again became the preeminent, if not only, divinity for the Pharaoh Akhenaton.|$|E
5|$|HD 28185 {{is similar}} to our Sun in terms of mass, radius, and luminosity. The star is on the main {{sequence}} and is generating energy by fusing hydrogen in its core. The spectral type of G5V implies HD 28185 is cooler than <b>the</b> <b>Sun.</b> Like the majority of extrasolar planet host stars, HD 28185 is metal-rich relative to <b>the</b> <b>Sun,</b> containing around 173% of the solar abundance of iron. The star rotates slower than <b>the</b> <b>Sun,</b> with a period of around 30 days, compared to 25.4 days for <b>the</b> <b>Sun.</b>|$|E
50|$|Despite {{having the}} best overall record in the Carolina League North Division in 1988, <b>the</b> <b>Suns</b> {{did not make the}} playoffs. This {{occurred}} because <b>the</b> <b>Suns</b> did not win either the first or second half. The team that won the North Division Championship was the Lynchburg Red Sox, whose overall record was 11 games worse than <b>the</b> <b>Suns.</b>|$|R
50|$|On July 11, <b>the</b> <b>Suns</b> re-signed Grant Hill and Louis Amundson. On July 13, <b>the</b> <b>Suns</b> {{signed a}} two-year {{contract}} with former University of Arizona center Channing Frye.|$|R
