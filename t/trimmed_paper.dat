40|$|Adhesive bookbinding, {{a method}} of holding trimmed pages {{together}} in a book using hotmelt glue, offers rapid binding and curing time, but has the disadvantage of poor glue penetration into the paper edges. A weak binding will result unless good linkage can be made between paper and glue, which is the objective of spine-roughening treatments. Eight spine-roughening treatments from three manufacturers were compared on an uncoated and a coated paper stock, against a control treatment of <b>trimmed</b> <b>paper.</b> Treatments were studied by light- and scanning electron microscopic examination of paper edges and by measurement of the mean page-pull values based on samples of 30 or more page-pulls. The results were compared with four hypotheses concerning bookbinding strength. First, when 95 percent confidence intervals were compared, different spine-roughening treatments were found to produce different bookbinding strengths, as measured by mean page-pull value. Specifically, {{almost all of the}} treatments produced higher page-pull values than the control, showing that these roughening treatments increased book strength. Some treatments produced significantly higher page-pull values than others, indicating that some roughening treatments were better than others for binding the two papers studied. The results of these tests are summarized in the table {{at the top of the}} next page. Secondly, comparing mean page-pull values ranked on the uncoated stock with those of the coated stock, the relatively low correlation of 0. 66 indicated that a spine-roughening treatment appropriate for one kind of paper may not be suitable for another kind of paper. One treatment produced the highest page-pull value on both papers, however, indicating that its edge geometry produced a strong bond in both papers studied. Table of Spine-Roughening Treatments with Page-Pull Values and Duncan Groupings. Ranked by Uncoated Paper: (Treatment, Mean Page-Pull Value, Duncan 1 Groupings) : ((Control) # 1, 2. 12 lb/in, F), (# 48, 2. 36, F E), (# 2, 2. 62, D E), (# 16, 2. 88, D C), (# 24, 3. 14, B C), (# 20, 3. 26, B), (# 3, 3. 34, B), (# 30, 3. 42, B), (# 10 3. 74 A). Ranked by Coated Paper: (Treatment, Mean Page-Pull Value, Duncan 1 Groupings) : ((Control) # 1, 0. 74, E), (# 2, 0. 78, E), (# 30, 0. 95, D), (# 48, 1. 09, D C), (# 3, 1. 16, C), (# 20, 1. 20, C), (# 16, 1. 36, B), (# 24, 1. 43, B), (# 10, 1. 61, A). 1 Duncan groupings indicate means which are not significantly different. Thirdly, two page-pull testers commonly used to measure page pull were compared using the Mandrell Sensitivity Analysis, which considers sensitivity to the measured attribute along with consistency of measurement. The Martini Tester was shown to be approximately 1. 5 times, or barely significantly, more sensitive than the Moffett Tester. Fourthly, three spine-roughening treatments were compared for book strength vs. production speed. Some treatments-those in which the edge-weakening effect of pattern undercutting was apparent produced higher page-pull values as production speed increase...|$|E

40|$|Amid growing {{concerns}} over {{global warming and}} available management strategies for reducing cluster temperature to prevent overheating and sunburn damage, there is increasing interest in sprawling, non-positioned canopies {{as an alternative to}} traditional vertically-positioned ones. However, management of sprawling canopies needs adjustments so that a mostly erect growth pattern is maintained during the season. A three-year study (2009 – 2011) was carried out to investigate the performance of 15 -yr-old Pinot noir grapevines trained to a single high-wire trellis (SHW) subjected to pre-bloom shoot trimming to retain seven (T 7) or eleven (T 11) main stem leaves. Results showed significant year x treatment interactions: with a low crop and weather conducive to post-trimming lateral re-growth in 2010, trimmed vines had higher leaf area, soluble solids concentration, pH, total anthocyanins and cluster rot incidence than control vines, whereas in 2009 and 2011 the overall must compositional pattern was reversed due to sub-optimal leaf-to-fruit ratios in the trimmed plots. The effects linked to this necessary operation are very much dependent upon unpredictable weather occurring after shoot trimming and, hence, the milder trimming severity (T 11) may more successfully balance the need of inducing a still mostly erect canopy while retaining more vine leaves to buffer any weak lateral formation after <b>trimming.</b> The <b>paper</b> provides new and useful knowledge for improved canopy management in trellises having free shoot growth due to absence of foliage wires...|$|R

The kinematic model is then used to optimize the servo-actuators placement and pre-inclination {{in order to minimize}} static and dynamic loads in the three servo-actuators and in the non-rotating scissors. The inputs for the model (blade pitch link loads and pilot input to trim the aircraft) are taken from flight tests measurements, current rotor computations being unable to predict blade root torsion moments vs azimuth with enough accuracy. The analysis is based on X 3 demonstrator flight tests, which showed high control system loads that used to reduce flight envelope during the first flight test campaign. Flight tests measurements are used to validate the kinematic model used for the optimization. Computations made for X 3 case at 220 kts showed a reduction of 40 % of maximum static load and 45 % of maximum dynamic load on servo-actuators compared to the initial placement of the servo actuators.
