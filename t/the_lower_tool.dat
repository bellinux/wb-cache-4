40|$|Abstract. Bendability is an {{important}} material property for ultra-high strength steel. The bendability of a certain material is expressed as the minimum bending radius Rmin of the inner surface of the bend and expressed in multiples of the sheet thickness. Bendability is limited by either cracking on the surface or {{the edges of the}} bend or by surface waviness that usually precedes cracking on the outer surface. Surface waviness is a form of strain localization in bending and the intensity of the phenomenon is dependent on e. g. the punch radius, <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>tool</b> width and the sheet thickness. In this study the bendability of a S 960 grade steel was investigated using optical strain measurements of three-point bending tests to determine the strain level and the bending angle when localization starts with different punch radii. The unbent samples were marked with a grid using laser marking and the deformation was measured with the GOM ARGUS strain analysis system after bending. The quality of the bend was also evaluated visually. In addition, tensile tests were performed and evaluated with the GOM ARAMIS deformation analysis system to investigate the local mechanical properties of the studied steel. The results of strain measurements and visual evaluation were then compared. It was found that beyond a certain angle the maximum strain across the bend did not significantly change with further increases in the bending angle when the punch radius was at least three times the sheet thickness. But with smaller punch radii the maximum strain increased almost linearly with increasing bending angle until fracture appeared. With the smaller punch radii deformation localizes and surface waviness begins to form in smaller bending angles because the deformation is concentrated in a narrow zone...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of microstructure on the corrosion behaviour of magnesium alloys {{has been investigated}} using advanced microscopy approaches including optical microscopy, SEM, TEM and SKPFM {{with a focus on}} the effect of melt-conditioned twin roll casting (MCTRC) and friction stir welding (FSW) on the resultant microstructure of magnesium alloys. The microstructure characterization revealed that intense shearing, generated through the advanced shear technology, resulted in grain refinement and a uniform distribution of the β-phase and reduced micro-porosity in the MCTRC Mg-Al alloys, of which were attributed to the enhanced heterogeneous nucleation, which resulted in a highly refined grain structure. The TRC Mg-Al alloys displayed a coarse grained microstructure, with a random distribution of grain sizes. Deformation features like twinning, localized shear, microporosity and centre-line segregation were some of the commonly observed defects in the TRC alloys. The general microstructure of the AZ series Mg-Al alloys was composed of α-Mg grains, the β-phase, rosette-shaped Al 8 Mn 5 intermetallic particles and β-precipitates. The MCTRC Mg-Al alloys showed improved corrosion resistance owing to the reduced grain size and the β-phase network acting as a corrosion barrier, thereby retarding the corrosion process. The TRC Mg-Al alloys exhibited higher susceptibility to galvanic corrosion due to the coarse and random distribution of grain sizes, and segregation. The corrosion testing results showed different corrosion morphologies, including filiform-like and spherical channel-like along with overall general corrosion. However, galvanic corrosion, initiating at localized sites due to Al 8 Mn 5 intermetallic particles and the Si/Fe impurities accounted for a major deterioration in the performance of the Mg-Al alloys. The polarization curves revealed no evidence of passivation, suggesting that the alloy surface was continuously attacked. SKPFM results indicated that the micro-constituents, namely Al 8 Mn 5 intermetallic particles and the β-phase exhibited higher nobility relative to the α-Mg matrix, suggesting formation of micro-galvanic couples at localized sites leading to the initiation of galvanic corrosion. The AM 60 and AZ 91 Mg-Al alloys, subjected to FSW, revealed that the traverse speed had a direct influence on the weld zone microstructure, where the size of the friction stir/weld nugget zone decreased with increase in the traverse speed and the increase in the rate of deformation, led to widening of the friction stir zone, below the shoulder. The weld microstructure displayed a prominent friction stir zone, with an ultrafine grain structure of an average grain size ranging from 2 - 10 μm. The localized increase in temperatures, in the TMAZ, due to <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>tool</b> rotation rates and traverse speeds, which rise above the eutectic melting point (430 °C), showed evidence of partial melting followed by re-solidification of the β-phase and evidence of liquation below the shoulder regions in the TMAZ. The morphology of the β-phase clearly revealed solute segregation, inconsistent with the β-phase observed in the parent alloy microstructure. The polarization curves obtained from the weld zones in the FSW AM 60 alloy showed an improved corrosion resistance compared with the parent metal zone. SKPFM results revealed that the α-Mg matrix in the friction stir zone showed higher surface potential values compared with the parent alloy microstructure, due to the dissolution of the β-phase, suggesting higher nobility. However, the polarization behaviour of the AZ 91 alloys did not show {{a significant difference in the}} corrosion resistance in the weld zones due to the higher volume fraction of the β-phase in the AZ 91 alloys. The immersion testing results revealed higher susceptibility to corrosion in the transition zone due to the flash formation and the banded microstructure leading to failure of the weld zone.

40|$|Nowadays, {{titanium}} {{has become}} an important material mainly used in engineering application because of its excellent mechanical and physical property, for example, aircraft, aero-engines, biomedical devices and components in chemical processing equipments. However, the machining of titanium is getting tougher as tool wear is a common phenomenon happened during machining operations due to the frictions and forces produced when the cutting tool is {{in contact with the}} workpiece. The kind of chips produced from the machining operation may contribute to certain tool wear and cause the cutting tool life to be lowered. So, it is necessary to find out the optimum machining parameters that produce certain chip structure formations with lowest tool wear rate. Therefore, this project gives an investigation on the effect of chip formation on tool wear in machining of Titanium. The experiments will be carried out using a Computer Numerically Controlled machine (CNC). Different value of cutting speeds and feed rates are selected in order to study and observe the kind of chip formed. The cutting speed selected in the experiment are 90, 120 and 150 m/min, while the feed rates range from 0. 05 to 0. 15 mm/min. Apart from that, the depth of cut is kept constant at 0. 5 mm. The diameter and length of titanium used in this study are 25 mm and 200 mm respectively. The chips collected from all these machining parameters will be taken to several chip preparation processes and then examined using optical microscope.

40|$|Micro-end-milling {{requires}} high spindle {{rotational speed}} to achieve effective material removal. This results in the requirement of tool stoppage or slowdown during a micro-end-milling operation, a deterrent to productivity and to part acceptability. A circular tool path geometry can avoid discontinuities in the tool movements leading to a more consistent and smooth material removal. However, optimal process planning for such a tool path will require detailed understanding of the chip-formation mechanism in circular end-milling. The cut geometry during end-milling along a circular tool path is often approximated {{as that of a}} linear tool path. Although this assumption works well for circular tool paths with higher tool path radius, this is not <b>the</b> case for <b>lower</b> <b>tool</b> path radius often used in micro-milling.

Systematic signal processing was applied to analyse the measured cutting force signal along linear and several circular tool paths. Qualitative as well as quantitative differences were observed in the cutting force profiles obtained using different tool path radii, tool path orientations, and feed rates. This implies the need for an improved chip thickness formulation dedicated to micro-end-milling with circular tool path rather than approximating it with formulations derived for linear tool path. 9 Authors 2011.

As {{a part of}} efforts to reduce HTV exposures through tool selection, the primary objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the applicability of a standardized laboratory-based riveting hammer assessment protocol for screening riveting hammers. The second objective was to characterize the vibration emissions of reduced vibration riveting hammers and to make approximations of the HTV exposures of workers operating these tools in actual work tasks. Eight pneumatic riveting hammers were selected for the study. They were first assessed in a laboratory using the standardized method for measuring vibration emissions at the tool handle. The tools were then further assessed under actual working conditions during three aircraft sheet metal riveting tasks. Although the average vibration magnitudes of the riveting hammers measured in the laboratory test were considerably different from those measured in the field study, the rank orders of the tools determined via these tests were fairly consistent, especially for <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> vibration <b>tools.</b> This study identified four tools that consistently exhibited lower frequency-weighted and unweighted accelerations in both the laboratory and workplace evaluations. These observations suggest that the standardized riveting hammer test is acceptable for identifying tools that could be expected to exhibit lower vibrations in workplace environments. However, the large differences between the accelerations measured in the laboratory and field suggest that the standardized laboratory-based tool assessment is not suitable for estimating workplace riveting hammer HTV exposures. Based on the frequency-weighted accelerations measured at the tool handles during the three work tasks, the sheet metal mechanics assigned to these tasks at the studied workplace are unlikely to exceed the daily vibration exposure action value (2. 5 m s(- 2)) using any of the evaluated riveting hammers.

40|$|Mechanical micro-cutting (e. g. micro-grooving, micro-milling) is {{emerging}} as a viable alterna-tive to lithography based micromachining techniques for various applications {{in the fields of}} micro molding, biomedical devices, optics, and semiconductors. However, certain factors limit the work-piece materials that can be processed using mechanical micromachining methods. For difficult-to-machine materials such as mold and die steels and ceramics, limitations in cutting tool and stage stiffness and strength of the micro-tool are significant problems facing the successful application of mechanical micromachining methods. In addition, in microscale cutting, the effects of tool and pre-cision motion stage deflections on part dimensional accuracy can be significant. This paper presents a novel hybrid Laser Assisted Mechanical Micromachining (LAMM) process that makes use of highly localized thermal softening of the hard material by continuous wave laser irradiation (2 - 35 W Yb-fiber laser, wavelength 1064 nm) in front of a miniature (100 - 500 µm wide) TiAlN-coated tung-sten carbide grooving tool. By suitably controlling the laser power, location, and spot size, it is pos-sible to bring about a sufficiently large decrease in the work material strength and thereby minimize catastrophic <b>tool</b> failure, and <b>lower</b> <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> forces and deflection. Despite these advantages, the LAMM process may produce a heat affected zone (HAZ) that can result in potentially undesirabl...|$|R
