40|$|We {{consider}} the short-term scheduling of multistage continuous multiproduct plants. In the literature {{this problem is}} generally modeled as a monolithic mixed-integer program. In this paper we follow a closed-loop approach which starts from a decomposition of the problem into an <b>operations</b> <b>planning</b> and an <b>operations</b> scheduling problem. <b>The</b> <b>operations</b> <b>planning</b> problem consists in optimizing the operating conditions of <b>the</b> <b>operations</b> and can be formulated as a nonlinear program of moderate size. The solution to <b>the</b> <b>operations</b> <b>planning</b> problem provides a set of operations with fixed operating conditions, which have to be scheduled on the processing units of the plant. For solving this operations scheduling problem we use a novel mixed-integer linear programming formulation. Having computed a feasible production schedule, we return to <b>the</b> <b>operations</b> <b>planning</b> phase, where we re-optimize the operating conditions {{in such a way}} that we can guarantee the existence of a feasible s olution to <b>the</b> <b>operations</b> scheduling problem. We proceed with scheduling <b>the</b> <b>operations</b> again and iterate the planning and scheduling phases until a fixed-point solution has been reached. The new method is able to find good feasible schedules for complex benchmark instances within a few minutes of computation time on a standard PC...|$|R
