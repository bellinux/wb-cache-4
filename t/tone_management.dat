40|$|Background and Problem Definition: The CEO {{letter is}} one {{significant}} narrative document through which senior management have {{opportunity to express}} beliefs and values to their shareholders. The CEO letter is unregulated in its nature and thereby subject to management opportunism through <b>tone</b> <b>management.</b> <b>Tone</b> <b>management</b> could further be used to manipulate {{the perception of the}} firm, which causes information asymmetry. Similar to the purpose of <b>tone</b> <b>management,</b> accruals could be opportunistically managed in order to manipulate users’ perceptions of firm fundamentals. Thus, managers could through CEO letters employ <b>tone</b> <b>management</b> to potentially hide earnings management, and thereby mislead users about firm fundamentals. Purpose: The purpose of this thesis is to test the possible association between <b>tone</b> <b>management</b> in CEO letters and earnings management, using data from 2013 including firms listed on the London Stock Exchange. Subsequently, the intention is to investigate if earnings management and <b>tone</b> <b>management</b> are substitutes or complements. The purpose is additionally to test the relation between <b>tone</b> <b>management</b> in CEO letters and financial performance Research Design and Methodology: The theoretical framework of this thesis is used to develop hypotheses, which subsequently guide the research forward. In the execution phase, a customized dictionary is developed to fit with the purpose of the thesis. The execution phase continues in correlation and multiple regression analysis. The outcome of the statistical tests contributes to fulfill the purpose. Empirical Results and Analysis: In accordance with previous literature, the empirical results reveal a positive association between tone in CEO letters and financial performance. Strengthening the purpose and the contribution of this thesis, empirical evidences reveal that abnormal tone in CEO letters and abnormal accruals are positively associated. Concluding Remarks: The tone in CEO letters is generally positive regardless of management discretion. Furthermore the tone in CEO letters can be derived from firm performance, firm size and annual stock return. Finally, the findings indicate that <b>tone</b> <b>management</b> and earnings management through the use of abnormal tone and abnormal accruals functions as complements and are thus not substitutes...|$|E

30|$|The {{responsibility}} for <b>tone</b> <b>management</b> in tertiary centres varies; for example, injections of botulinum toxin may be administered in some centres by paediatric neurologists {{and in other}} centres by specialists in paediatric rehabilitation or orthopaedic surgeons [11].

Neurosurgeons perform selective dorsal rhizotomy, and ITB pumps may be inserted by orthopaedic surgeons or neurosurgeons. We believe it is important to record the utilisation and response to <b>tone</b> <b>management,</b> adverse events and future plans [28]. For example, some children are uniquely sensitive to injections of botulinum toxin and develop stridor and recurrent bouts of aspiration following the administration of doses which would be considered as standard and safe in other individuals [29]. The documentation of early response and later unresponsiveness to injections of botulinum toxin may indicate the development of neutralising antibodies or the progression of fixed muscle tendon contractures. Information from examination under anaesthesia as to the site, severity and significance of fixed muscle tendon contractures can be very useful to the adult rehabilitation physician in ongoing <b>tone</b> <b>management</b> in young adults. In our jurisdiction, future access to botulinum toxin under a government subsidised scheme is in part dependent on the documentation of its use in childhood.

The Public Finance Management Act. No. 1 of 1999 requires Public entities including the councils (university or college controlling body) of public {{institutions of higher learning}} to adopt enterprise risk management, which includes a fraud and corruption risk management policy and procedures. The function of the fraud and corruption policy is to provide an objective strategy to prevent, detect and investigate any possible irregularity in order to prevent further loss in line with Corporate Governance requirements. The anti-fraud and corruption strategy measures include setting the appropriate <b>tone</b> by <b>management</b> of the institution, being proactive (fraud risk assessments), and being reactive (reporting process, investigation and taking appropriate action). The actions include disciplinary action and criminal or civil proceedings in order to recover assets lost. The procedures address the implementation of the policy.

In this context, we present a novel gamut and <b>tone</b> <b>management</b> framework for color-accurate reproduction of high dynamic range (HDR) images, which is conceptually and computationally simple, parameter-free, and compatible with existing TMOs. In the CIE LCh color space, we compress chroma to fit the gamut of the output color space. This prevents hue and luminance shifts while taking gamut boundaries into consideration. We also propose a compatible lightness compression scheme that minimizes the number of color space conversions.

The current research consisted of an alternating treatment single-subject study, which was conducted on a college campus over the course of a 15 -week semester. 8 college voice students (3 male and 5 female) ranging in age from 18 to 25 participated in voice lessons provided by the researcher and aimed at improving the overall quality of the voices of the participants. Over the course of the 15 weeks, the instructor alternated between providing a high-frequency feedback (HFF) instruction condition and a low-frequency feedback (LFF) instruction condition. At the beginning of each session, a vocal sample was recorded to test the retention of the skills trained in the previous lesson. Those recordings were evaluated by a panel of five college voice instructors who provided a numerical score (out of a possible 100 pts.) for each sample on the basis of <b>tone</b> quality, breath <b>management,</b> and intonation. The results of this study indicated that three of the eight subjects retained more vocal skill ability during the HFF phases of the study, while the remaining five subjects retained less vocal skill ability during the HFF phases of the study.

40|$|Background: Qualitative {{disclosures}} {{in annual}} reports, i. e. disclosure narratives, {{such as the}} CEO-letter, are important complements to the quantitative aspects of corporate disclosure. How readers perceive the narrative information, and thereby how they perceive the firm’s performances and image, may influence investors’ business decisions. Since there are few or no explicit rules as to what narrative disclosures should cover and {{how it should be}} written, firms have the possibility to influence the readers perception through <b>tone</b> <b>management.</b> If a family holds a high degree of voting shares in a firm, it can obtain and maintain considerable control and may thereby also have the ability to influence disclosure practises. Purpose: The {{purpose of this study is}} to test whether there is a correlation between the degree of family ownership in terms of voting rights and the tone used in the disclosure narratives. Furthermore, the study seeks to test if having a family member as CEO and/or chairman of the board affects the tone used. By testing for these correlations, this thesis seeks to investigate if family ownership has an impact on the tone used in disclosure narratives and thereby tell if family firms are more or less inclined to use <b>tone</b> <b>management.</b> Delimitations: The scope of this study focuses on the annual reports of 100 companies noted on the Swedish stock exchange, Nasdaq OMX Stockholm. This thesis concerns the narrative parts of the annual reports, more specifically the CEO-letter. The annual reports studied are from the year of 2013 and published in Swedish. Methodology: This thesis takes on a quantitative approach. Tone in CEO-letters have been quantified through word counts based on positive and negative words occurring in a pre-set wordlist. The firms studied have been dichotomously segmented into family and non-family firms and further divided into two groups; (1) family firms where a member of the controlling family holds the position as CEO and/or chairman of the board, and (2) non-family firms or family firms without a family member as CEO and/or chairman. The hypotheses have been tested through statistical tests of differences and correlation. Findings and Conclusions: The empirical results indicate no statistically significant correlation between the degree of family ownership and tone in CEO-letters. However, the results suggest a tendency for firms that are considered family firms to present a slightly less positive tone than non-family firms do. Furthermore, when a member of a controlling family serves as CEO or chairman of the board, the tone used in the CEO-letter tends to decline further. Although the empirical evidence of the associations were not statically significant, a different definition of family firms or a larger sample may change the outcome of the tests and thus, further research is therefore necessary in order to make a general conclusion on the impact of family ownership on disclosure tone...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{draws on}} agency theory to {{primarily}} investigate whether CEOs’ and CFOs’ voluntary certification of internal controls over financial reporting (hereafter, ICFR) {{is associated with}} audit fees and value relevance of Australian financial reports. The thesis also examines whether corporate governance and audit quality {{are associated with the}} likelihood that firms provide the CEOs’ and CFOs’ voluntary ICFR certification. While agency theory predicts that firms with high agency costs are less likely to implement sound internal control procedures, however, sound corporate governance and higher audit effort provides avenues to mitigate such high agency costs. This theoretical framework is used to examine three Research Questions. CEOs’ and CFOs’ voluntary ICFR certification is a recommendation within the Australian Securities Exchange Corporate Governance Council Best Practice Recommendations. The ICFR certification states that the integrity of financial reports is formed on the soundness, efficiency and effectiveness of firms’ risk management systems and internal compliance and controls (hereafter, CERTDISC). While disclosure of ICFR certification is not mandated, if there is a non-compliance of the recommendation, that information has to be disclosed in the annual report with an “if not why not” approach. Studies in a mandatory disclosure setting in the US find internal control deficiency is related to several firm level outcomes. For example, it is found to be negatively associated with earnings quality (Doyle, Ge and McVay, 2007 b; Ashbaugh-Skaife, Collins, Kinney and LaFond, 2008; Chan, Farrell and Lee, 2008), positively associated with audit fees (Raghunandan and Rama, 2006; Hoitash, Hoitash and Bedard, 2008; Lu, Richardson and Salterio, 2011) and positively associated with cost of equity (Beneish, Billings and Hodder, 2008; Ashbaugh-Skaife, Collins, Kinney and Lafond, 2009). The inferences drawn from studies in a mandatory setting may not be applicable in a voluntary environment where disclosures of good news as opposed to bad news, are affirmative and not assured by an external auditor. Three specific related Research Questions are examined in this thesis: (1) Are corporate governance and audit quality associated with ICFR certification and disclosure? (2) Is ICFR certification and disclosure associated with audit fees? (3) Is ICFR certification and disclosure value relevant? This thesis aims at establishing a view on the effect of CERTDISC on audit fees and the value relevance of CERTDISC by investigating whether firms with strong corporate governance and audit quality implement CERTDISC and whether auditors and investors are affected by CERTDISC. Prior studies show that the effectiveness of the board and audit committee positively affects voluntary disclosures and the quality of ICFR (Klein, 2002; Leuz, Nanda and Wysocki, 2003; Beekes, Pope and Young, 2004; Agrawal and Chadha, 2005; Farber, 2005; Ashbaugh-Skaife, Collins and LaFond, 2006; Doyle, Ge and McVay, 2007 a). Sound, effective and efficient ICFR reduces the auditors’ control risk which, in turn, according to the audit risk model, increases detection risk. Firms with high detection risk (the risk that the auditor’s testing procedures will not be effective in detecting a material misstatement) require less audit effort and therefore lower audit fees, ceteris paribus. The thesis is conducted using a sample of 498 Australian listed firms in 2004, the year post the introduction of CERTDISC provisions. In testing first Research Question it is found that firms audited by big- 4 audit firms are associated with CERTDISC. Moreover, it is found that the positive association between corporate governance and CERTDISC is stronger for firms audited by big- 4 auditors consistent with agency theory. In the audit fee tests to address Research Question 2, it is found that while CERTIDISC has no significant main effect on audit fees, corporate governance has a significant positive main effect. This suggests firms with strong corporate governance are likely to demand higher audit effort also consistent with agency theory and a study by Carcello, Hermanson, Neal and Riley Jr (2002). However, when CERTDISC and corporate governance variables are tested for interaction effect, it is found that there is a significant positive interaction effect between CERTDISC and corporate governance on audit fees. Further analysis of the interaction effect suggests that the effect of CERTDISC on audit fees is conditional on corporate governance. In point of detail, it is found that at low levels of corporate governance, there is a negative association between CERTDISC and audit fees but at progressively higher levels of corporate governance, the effects of CERTIDISC become weaker. In other words, CERTDISC has a negative effect on audit fees only for firms with low corporate governance. The results from the examination of the value relevance of CERTDISC for addressing Research Question 3 suggest that CERTDISC is positively associated with share price. More specifically, it is found that the value relevance is more prominent for firms with higher information asymmetry proxied by three measures namely audit by big- 4 versus non-big- 4 audit firms (non-big- 4 client firms are assumed to be associated with higher information asymmetry), bid-ask spread and stock liquidity. These results suggest that investors find CERTDISC most useful for firms with high information asymmetry. Findings suggest that costly ICFR audit environment similar to that in the US under Section 404 of Sarbanes Oxley Act, 2002 may not be required as the market is able to recognize the information conveyed by the existence of ICFR. Finally, from the theoretical point of view, this thesis provides evidence consistent with theoretical predictions in agency theory. More specifically, agency theory predicts that stronger internal controls and a commitment by top <b>management</b> (<b>tone</b> at the top) to implement ICFR procedures reduces potential agency conflicts between managers and shareholders thus resulting in higher firm valuation, ceteris paribus. This thesis contributes to the extant literature on ICFR by investigating a unique unaudited and voluntary ICFR certification and disclosure regime. The findings have implications for investors when making an investment decision as it informs them of the reliance they can place on CERTDISC. The thesis also provides some information to the corporate regulators on whether an alternative to the regulation (Section 404 of Sarbanes Oxley Act, 2002) adopted by the US should be considered in Australia. Finally, the thesis adds to the audit fee literature by showing that both corporate governance and ICFR certification affect audit fees. It also adds to the “value relevant” literature by showing that ICFR certification information is value relevant to investors for a sample of Australian listed firms, and that the extent of value relevance depends on the information environment; ICFR is less relevant for firms with big- 4 auditors and for firms with low information asymmetry...|$|R

Quantifying {{the contributions of}} each of these components is crucial to optimize the selection of anti-spasticity treatments such as botulinum toxin (BTX). The aim {{of this study was to}} compare different biomechanical parameters that quantify the neural contribution to ankle joint torque measured during manually-applied passive stretches to the gastrocsoleus in children with spastic cerebral palsy (CP). The gastrocsoleus of 53 children with CP (10. 9 ± 3. 7 y; females n = 14; bilateral/unilateral involvement n = 28 / 25; Gross Motor Functional Classification Score I-IV) and 10 age-matched typically developing (TD) children were assessed using a manually-applied, instrumented spasticity assessment. Joint angle characteristics, root mean square electromyography and joint torque were simultaneously recorded during passive stretches at increasing velocities. From the CP cohort, 10 muscles were re-assessed for between-session reliability and 19 muscles were re-assessed 6 weeks post-BTX. A parameter related to mechanical work, containing both neural and non-neural components, was compared to newly developed parameters that were based on the modeling of passive stiffness and viscosity. The difference between modeled and measured response provided a quantification of the neural component. Both types of parameters were reliable (ICC > 0. 95) and distinguished TD from spastic muscles (p < 0. 001).

It is important that all orthopaedic interventions and the dates of these interventions, {{as well as the}} response, rehabilitation and functional response of the patient, be documented prior to transition. For ambulant patients, records of three-dimensional gait analysis, gait patterns and changes relevant to <b>tone</b> <b>management,</b> the use of orthoses and orthopaedic surgery contribute to clear communication. In our centre, ambulant patients receive serial two-dimensional video recordings of gait from an early age and instrumented gait analysis (three-dimensional gait analysis) at intervals, including before selective dorsal rhizotomy, single-event multilevel surgery and at intervals thereafter [30]. When possible, we encourage a full three-dimensional gait analysis immediately prior to transition in order to advise the person with CP, their family and their future carers about functional status and expected future issues. In this “exit” or transition gait analysis, we describe fully the utilisation of assistive devices when appropriate, using the FMS [24]. In addition, we carefully compare gait parameters and function with and without orthoses, thereby providing adolescents and parents with the information—based on objective measurements—on just how much the current use of orthoses is helping gait and function. This approach provides additional information to the adolescent patient which he/she can base his/her personal choice for the ongoing utilisation of both assistive devices and orthoses. In this regard, serial examinations of composite gait indices including the Gait Profile Score are helpful [31]. At a glance, these scores all demonstrate whether gait function is static, improving or deteriorating [32].|$|E

Both paediatricians and general practitioners have expressed concern about the differences in healthcare services between paediatric and adult providers, the lack of knowledge about adult services and the difficulty in finding “the right service for the right adolescent”. Adult-oriented healthcare sectors and tertiary children’s hospitals have markedly different subcultures. For example, in our centre, a group of three surgeons with an interest in the musculoskeletal problems of children with CP provide three dedicated clinics for the needs of these children, which are staffed with allied healthcare professionals that include a clinical nurse coordinator, physiotherapists and gait laboratory staff. In addition, a combined clinic is conducted monthly run by an orthopaedic surgeon in conjunction with paediatric rehabilitation physicians. There is also a complex movement disorder meeting in which the management of young people with complex needs is discussed for the specific purpose of triaging <b>tone</b> <b>management</b> services, including botulinum toxin therapy, selective dorsal rhizotomy and intrathecal baclofen (ITB) [11]. In addition, there are robust hip surveillance programmes and a dedicated clinic for the evaluation and management of children with complex spinal deformities [12]. In the adult orthopaedic culture, surgeons are organised by narrow areas of super specialisation with the “generalist” rapidly becoming a creature of the past. If a young adult with CP has problems related to the spine, the hips, the knees, the feet and the upper limbs, {{it is possible that the}} person might need to see several orthopaedic surgeons [10], with the generalists being the family doctor and/or a specialist in adult rehabilitation medicine [9, 10]. The progressive subspecialisation of adult orthopaedic services has led us to re-double our efforts during childhood to complete and stabilise as many of the potential musculoskeletal problems as possible, particularly hip displacement and spinal deformity. The actual process of transition is now a subject of increasing evaluation and study [13].|$|E
