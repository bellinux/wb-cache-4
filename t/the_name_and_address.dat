5|$|While Lody was {{travelling}} to Killarney on {{the morning}} of 2 October, an Edinburgh City Police detective was ordered to enquire at hotels for a person named Inglis. The detective found that Lody had stayed at the Roxburgh Hotel and was shown his luggage, which still had a label attached bearing <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>and</b> <b>address</b> Charles A. Inglis, Bedford House, 12Drumsheugh Gardens. An interview with the proprietor of the boarding-house where Lody had stayed enabled the police to reconstruct his movements, while the manageress of the Roxburgh was able to tell them that he had gone to Ireland.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} Holloway's missed flight, Jug and Beth Twitty {{and friends}} flew to Aruba by private jet. Within {{four hours of}} landing on the island, the Twittys presented the Aruban police with <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>and</b> <b>address</b> of Van der Sloot as the person with whom Holloway left the nightclub. Beth stated that Van der Sloot's full name was given to her by the night manager at the Holiday Inn, who supposedly recognized him on a videotape. The Twittys and their friends went to the Van der Sloot home with two Aruban policemen to look for Holloway. Van der Sloot initially denied knowing Holloway's name, but he then told the following story, which was corrorborated by Deepak Kalpoe, who was present in the house: Van der Sloot related that they drove Holloway to the California Lighthouse area of Arashi Beach {{because she wanted to}} see sharks; they later dropped Holloway off at her hotel at around 2:00a.m. According to Van der Sloot, Holloway fell down as she exited the car but refused his help. He stated that as he and Kalpoe were driving away, Holloway was approached by a dark man in a black shirt similar to those worn by security guards.|$|E
25|$|About 1,000 draft {{cards were}} turned in on April 3, 1968, in {{nationwide}} protests organized by The Mobe. In Boston, 15,000 protesters watched 235 men turn in their draft cards. War protesters were increasingly choosing the more profound act of turning in their draft cards, an act {{which gave the}} government <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>and</b> <b>address</b> of the protester.

25|$|A truck driver's “DAC Report” {{refers to}} the {{employment}} history information submitted by former employers to HireRight & USIS Commercial Services Inc. (formerly called DAC Services, or “Drive-A-Check”). Among other things, a truck driver’s DAC Report contains the driver’s identification (Name, DOB, SSN), <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>and</b> <b>address</b> of the contributing trucking company, the driver’s dates of employment with that company, the driver’s reason for leaving that company, whether the driver is eligible for rehire, and comments about the driver’s work record (e.g. good, satisfactory, too many late deliveries, etc.). It will also indicate whether the company stored drug and alcohol testing information with USIS. A separate section of the DAC report contains incident/accident information as well as CSA 2010 Pre-Employment Screening Program (PSP) Reports.|$|E
25|$|Concerned {{that the}} sale of items such as bongs and rolling papers, along with books and {{magazines}} devoted to the era's drug culture promoted and encouraged illegal recreational drug use, {{the board of trustees}} of the village of Hoffman Estates, Illinois, passed an ordinance requiring that vendors of drug paraphernalia obtain a license to do so, as they lacked the power to ban their sale outright. As a condition of that license, they were required to keep a record of <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>and</b> <b>address</b> of anyone buying such items for inspection by the police at any time. One of the two stores it applied to, The Flipside, filed suit in federal court for the Northern District of Illinois, seeking to have the ordinance invalidated, claiming its scope was so wide and overbroad as to possibly prevent the store from selling the books and magazines, thus infringing its First Amendment rights.|$|E
25|$|Adams' {{share of}} the vote, at 37%, was short of a {{majority}} and he achieved victory only due to Fitt and the SDLP candidate splitting the non-Sinn Féin vote. In 1987 Adams narrowly held his seat, but lost it in the 1992 general election amidst a strong tactical voting campaign in favour of Joe Hendron of the Social Democratic and Labour Party by unionists in the Shankill Road area of the constituency. After the election a constituent, Maura McCrory, lodged an election petition challenging the result. The election court reported Hendron personally guilty of the illegal practice of failing to deliver a declaration verifying the return of his election expenses, and guilty through his election agent of failing to deliver a verified return of election expenses within 35 days, exceeding the maximum spending by £782.02, and failing to pay all the expenses within 28 days. Hendron's agent was also reported personally guilty of distributing election material without <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>and</b> <b>address</b> of the printer and publisher. The Judges granted both Hendron and his agent relief from their findings, {{on the grounds that}} the law had been broken through inadvertence; they therefore certified that Hendron had been duly elected.|$|E

500|$|The Green Book's motto, {{displayed}} on the front cover, urged black travelers to [...] "Carry your Green Book with you – You may need it". The 1949 edition included a quote from Mark Twain: [...] "Travel is fatal to prejudice", inverting Twain's original meaning; as Cotton Seiler puts it, [...] "here it was the visited, rather than the visitors, who would find themselves enriched by the encounter." [...] Green commented in 1940 that the Green Book had given black Americans [...] "something authentic to travel by and to make traveling better for the Negro." [...] Its principal goal was to provide accurate information on black-friendly accommodations to answer the constant question that faced black drivers: [...] "Where will you spend the night?" [...] As well as essential information on lodgings, service stations and garages, it provided details of leisure facilities open to African Americans, including beauty salons, restaurants, nightclubs and country clubs. The listings focused on four main categories– hotels, motels, tourist homes (private residences, usually owned by African Americans, which provided accommodation to travelers), and restaurants. They were arranged by state and subdivided by city, giving <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>and</b> <b>address</b> of each business.

On the contrary, the proposed reforms would heighten the risks for workers seeking to organize by requiring independent unions to submit <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>and</b> <b>address</b> of each of their members to the local Boards, which would then {{have the power to}} investigate the authenticity of their signatures.|$|E

2500|$|In 1978, a {{year before}} the DEA promulgated its model ordinance, the board of {{trustees}} of the village of Hoffman Estates, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, passed an ordinance of its own. It did not ban the sale of paraphernalia, but instead required those businesses selling [...] "any item, effect, paraphernalia, accessory or thing which is designed or marketed for use with illegal cannabis or drugs" [...] to get a license. Applicants were required to file an affidavit certifying that no one employed by the business had ever been convicted of a drug-related offense and to keep a record of <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>and</b> <b>address</b> of anyone purchasing items covered by the law, which the village police could inspect at any time. Sales to minors were also prohibited. The license fee was $150 (roughly $ in modern dollars), with any violation punishable by a fine of $10.|$|E

2500|$|... "But the {{inherent}} vagueness of the English language," [...] Sprecher concluded {{after reviewing the}} text of the ordinance and Grayned and the other relevant precedents, [...] "coupled with the admirable intention of stemming drug abuse, cannot save an ordinance which fails to give fair notice of what it prohibits." [...] He subjected the text to a closer reading than the district court had. Yes, he agreed with Leighton, the five words had clear meanings. [...] "But the fact that [...] does not sufficiently clarify the scope of the licensing requirement, which applies to any person who sells [...]" [...] He found the phrase after those words, [...] "which is designed or marketed for use with illegal cannabis or drugs" [...] to be most determinative of how the ordinance would be interpreted and enforced. [...] "Unless the license guidelines give additional clarity to this phrase, we must agree with plaintiff that the ordinance is so vague that it does not give sufficient notice to merchants as to whether they are required to obtain a license, and for which items <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>and</b> <b>address</b> of the purchaser must be recorded and sale to minors prohibited." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1711 Queen Anne gave {{royal assent}} to the 1712 Stamp Act, which imposed new taxes on newspapers.

[...] This evil seems to be grown too strong for the laws now in force. [...] It is therefore recommended to you to find a remedy equal to the mischief." [...] The passage of the Act was partly an attempt to silence Whig pamphleteers and dissenters, who had {{been critical of the}} then Tory government. [...] Every copy of a news-carrying publication printed on a half-sheet of paper became liable to a duty of a halfpenny, and if printed on a full sheet, a penny. [...] A duty of a shilling was placed on advertisements. [...] Pamphlets were charged a flate rate of two shillings per sheet for each edition, and were obliged to include <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>and</b> <b>address</b> of the printer.

2500|$|Prescriptions may {{be entered}} into an {{electronic}} medical record system and transmitted electronically to a pharmacy. Alternatively, a prescription may be handwritten on preprinted prescription forms that have been assembled into pads, or printed onto similar forms using a computer printer or even on plain paper according to the circumstance. In some cases, a prescription may be transmitted from the physician to the pharmacist orally by telephone; this practice may {{increase the risk of}} medical error. The content of a prescription includes <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>and</b> <b>address</b> of the prescribing provider and any other legal requirement such as a registration number (e.g. DEA Number in the United States). [...] Unique for each prescription {{is the name of the}} patient. [...] In the United Kingdom and Ireland, the patient's name and address must also be recorded. Each prescription is dated and some jurisdictions may place a time limit on the prescription. In the past, prescriptions contained instructions for the pharmacist to use for compounding the pharmaceutical product but most prescriptions now specify pharmaceutical products that were manufactured and require little or no preparation by the pharmacist. Prescriptions also contain directions for the patient to follow when taking the drug. These directions are printed on the label of the pharmaceutical product.|$|E
2500|$|Marlowe {{returns to}} his office, where he finds a note from Kingsley's {{secretary}} giving him the names and address of Almore's wife's parents. Marlowe visits them and learns <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>and</b> <b>address</b> of the detective they hired to investigate their daughter's death and that Dr. Almore's nurse was named Mildred Haviland. They also tell him that Almore is a [...] "dope" [...] doctor and that they believe he killed their daughter by drugging her and then putting her in the garage with the motor running on her car. The detective they hired was charged with drunk driving, spent 6 months in jail and is now not in contact with them. Marlowe visits the detective, who is not at his modest home, and is rebuffed by the detective's wife, who says that [...] "they" [...] have been there. Marlowe notices someone looking at his car and upon leaving realises he is being followed. He is confronted by the police again, who force him to drink liquor, beat him up and arrest him for speeding, resisting arrest and drunk driving, charges similar to those levelled against the parents' detective. Marlowe talks to a police captain, Webber, who treats him decently for a Bay City policeman, and although Webber isn't convinced by Marlowe's theories on the case, he is convinced that Marlowe is mostly telling him the truth, and he turns him loose.|$|E
