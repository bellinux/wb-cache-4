5|$|In 1935 Tange {{began the}} {{tertiary}} studies he desired at University of Tokyo's architecture department. He studied under Hideto Kishida and Shozo Uchida. Although Tange {{was fascinated by}} <b>the</b> <b>photographs</b> <b>of</b> Katsura villa that sat on Kishida's desk, his work was inspired by Le Corbusier. His graduation project was a seventeen-hectare (42-acre) development set in Tokyo's Hibiya Park.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, Himmler {{assigned}} him to Hitler's headquarters staff as his liaison officer and {{representative of the}} SS. He was promoted {{to the rank of}} SS-Gruppenführer und Generalleutnant der Waffen-SS on 10 June 1944. On 20 July 1944 Fegelein was present at the failed attempt on Hitler's life at the Wolf's Lair headquarters in Rastenburg, East Prussia and received a minor wound to his left thigh from the bomb blast. Fegelein often showed around <b>the</b> <b>photographs</b> <b>of</b> the hanged men who had been executed {{as a result of this}} failed assassination attempt.|$|E
5|$|Beato's {{photographs}} of the Second Opium War {{are the first to}} document a military campaign as it unfolded, doing so through a sequence of dated and related images. His {{photographs of}} the Taku Forts represent this approach on a reduced scale, forming a narrative recreation of the battle. The sequence of images shows the approach to the forts, the effects of bombardments on the exterior walls and fortifications, and finally the devastation within the forts, including the bodies of dead Chinese soldiers. The photographs were not taken in this order, as <b>the</b> <b>photographs</b> <b>of</b> dead Chinese had to be taken first—before the bodies were removed; only then was Beato free to take the other views of the exterior and interior of the forts.|$|E

5|$|In the 1960s, Riefenstahl became {{interested}} in Africa from Ernest Hemingway's Green Hills of Africa and from <b>the</b> <b>photographs</b> <b>of</b> George Rodger. She visited Kenya {{for the first time}} in 1956 and later Sudan, where she photographed Nuba tribes with whom she sporadically lived, learning about their culture so she could photograph them more easily. Even though her film project about modern slavery entitled Die Schwarze Fracht ("The Black Cargo") was never completed, Riefenstahl was able to sell the stills from the expedition to magazines in various parts of the world. While scouting shooting locations, she almost died from injuries received in a truck accident. After waking up from a coma in a Nairobi hospital, she finished writing the script, but was soon thoroughly thwarted by uncooperative locals, the Suez Canal crisis and bad weather. In the end, the film project was called off. Even so, Riefenstahl was granted Sudanese citizenship for her services to the country, becoming the first foreigner to receive a Sudanese passport.|$|E
5|$|The photographers in 1999, 2001, 2003 and 2004 were {{respectively}} Antoine Verglas, James Porto, Michael Zeppetello and Steven White for the Swimsuit Issue works. From 2005–2007 Gair took <b>the</b> <b>photographs</b> <b>of</b> {{her body}} paintings herself. Verglas again photographed the bodypainting for the 2008 Swimsuit Issue. No body painting pictures {{have been chosen}} as the main image {{on the cover of}} the Swimsuit Issue. However, in the 2005 Swimsuit Issue (pictured left) in which Carolyn Murphy is the cover model, Jessica White was shown as an inset on the cover in a Miami Dolphins jersey body painting by Gair. Thus, as a Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue photographer Gair debuted on the cover in a sense. In 2006 a small cropped portion of her photograph of a bodypainting of Klum appeared in an inset on the cover, but no bodypainting was apparent.|$|E
5|$|The {{search for}} bodies continued, but with winter setting {{in it was}} called off in November. Presented with the {{evidence}} of the tape recording, Brady admitted to taking <b>the</b> <b>photographs</b> <b>of</b> Lesley Ann Downey, but insisted that she had been brought to Wardle Brook Avenue by two men who had subsequently taken her away again, alive. Brady was further charged with the murder of John Kilbride, and Hindley with the murder of Edward Evans, on 2 December. At the committal hearing on 6 December, Brady was charged with the murders of Edward Evans, John Kilbride, and Lesley Ann Downey, and Hindley with the murders of Edward Evans and Lesley Ann Downey, as well as with harbouring Brady in the knowledge that he had killed John Kilbride. The prosecution's opening statement was held in camera, and the defence asked for a similar stipulation, but was refused. The proceedings continued in front of three magistrates in Hyde over an 11-day period during December, {{at the end of which}} the pair were committed for trial at Chester Assizes.|$|E

25|$|The {{primary reason}} Wood gave for {{changing}} her findings was her {{realization that the}} microscopic slides of the popliteal vein and <b>the</b> <b>photographs</b> <b>of</b> muscle tissue in the surrounding area provided evidence of trauma which could explain the thrombus formation.

25|$|When 20th-century American artists {{became aware}} of European Modernism, they began to {{interpret}} still-life subjects {{with a combination of}} American realism and Cubist-derived abstraction. Typical of the American still-life works of this period are the paintings of Georgia O'Keeffe, Stuart Davis, and Marsden Hartley, and <b>the</b> <b>photographs</b> <b>of</b> Edward Weston. O’Keeffe’s ultra-closeup flower paintings reveal both the physical structure and the emotional subtext of petals and leaves in an unprecedented manner.|$|E
25|$|Rolfe {{continued}} to indulge {{his interest in}} photography in Christchurch in 1890–91, upon his return from Rome, and experimented with colour and underwater pictures. He began to lose interest, however, and really only took photography up again {{when he returned to}} Italy in 1908. His photographic career has been fully documented in Donald Rosenthal's book <b>The</b> <b>Photographs</b> <b>of</b> Frederick Rolfe Baron Corvo 1860–1913, which was published in 2008.|$|E
25|$|As {{with many}} other 19th century novels, Onegin was written and {{published}} serially, with parts of each chapter often appearing published in magazines before the first printing of each chapter. Many changes, some small and some large, were made from the first appearance to the final edition during Pushkin's lifetime. The following dates mostly come from Nabokov's study of <b>the</b> <b>photographs</b> <b>of</b> Pushkin's drafts that were available at the time, {{as well as other}} people's work on the subject.|$|E

The Hindu also issued an apology after it printed {{a photograph of}} some people holding copies of Charlie Hebdo. The editor of the Urdu newspaper Avadhnama, Shireen Dalvi, which printed the cartoons faced several police complaints. She was arrested and released on bail. She began to wear the burqa {{for the first time}} in her life and went into hiding.|$|E
25|$|The My Lai massacre, {{like many}} other events in Vietnam, was {{captured}} on camera by U.S.Army personnel. The most published and graphic images were taken by Ronald Haeberle, a U.S. Army Public Information Detachment photographer who accompanied the men of Charlie Company that day. In 2009, Haeberle admitted that he destroyed a number of photographs he took during the massacre. Unlike <b>the</b> <b>photographs</b> <b>of</b> the dead bodies, the destroyed photographs depicted Americans in the actual process of murdering Vietnamese civilians.|$|E

The torsos of the bodies were missing and the investigating team was looking into possibilities that the killings were motivated by illicit trade in human organs.
