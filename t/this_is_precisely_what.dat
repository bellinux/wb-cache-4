25|$|The Constitution gives {{each state}} {{legislature}} {{the power to}} decide how its state's electors are chosen {{and it can be}} easier and cheaper for a state legislature to simply appoint a slate of electors than to create a legislative framework for holding elections to determine the electors. As noted above, the two situations in which legislative choice has been used since the Civil War have both been because there was not enough time or money to prepare for an election. However, appointment by state legislature can have negative consequences: bicameral legislatures can deadlock more easily than the electorate. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>precisely</b> <b>what</b> happened to New York in 1789 when the legislature failed to appoint any electors.|$|E
25|$|Hermeneutic counselors {{advocate}} his {{same process}} {{can be used in}} counseling to envision the bodily experiences of others in reality. For example, a client may present with tears while verbalizing feelings of pain and humiliation in response to a break up with a significant other. A therapist, using his memory of past embodied experiences of relationship heartache, can empathically envision in his imagination very closely to what the client is experiencing, therefore sharing that experience with the client and in turn enabling him to authentically relate to the client. Furthermore, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>precisely</b> <b>what</b> enables the therapist and the client to work together to imagine new therapeutic possibilities. Mensch states that this capacity of human beings necessitates their responsibility to relate to and understand others as best they can. Humans may not always be able to, or entirely be able to, but their co-existence as embodied beings demands that they make the attempt.|$|E

There is no claim that Dershowitz used the words of others without attribution. When he uses the words of others, he quotes them properly and generally cites them to the original sources (Mark Twain, Palestine Royal Commission, etc.) [...] complaint is that instead he should have cited them to the secondary source, in which Dershowitz may have come upon them. But as The Chicago Manual of Style emphasizes: 'Importance of attribution. With all reuse of others' materials, it is important to identify the original as the source. This not only bolsters the claims of fair use, it also helps avoid any accusation of plagiarism.' <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>precisely</b> <b>what</b> Dershowitz did.|$|E
500|$|Since the band's 1960s heyday, the {{influence}} of the Byrds on successive generations of rock and pop musicians has grown steadily, with acts such as the Eagles, Big Star, Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers, R.E.M., the Bangles, the Smiths, and innumerable alternative rock bands of the post-punk era all exhibiting signs of their influence. [...] Musician and author Peter Lavezzoli described the Byrds in 2007 as [...] "one of the few bands to exert a decisive influence on the Beatles", while also noting that they helped to persuade Bob Dylan to begin recording with electric instrumentation. [...] Lavezzoli concluded that [...] "like it or not, terms like [...] "folk rock," [...] "raga rock" [...] and [...] "country rock" [...] were coined for a reason: the Byrds did it first, and then kept moving, never staying in the [...] "raga" [...] or [...] "country" [...] mode for very long. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>precisely</b> <b>what</b> made the Byrds such a rewarding band to follow from one record to the next." ...|$|E

"As Saint Maximus the Confessor insisted, however, in defence of the Roman {{use of the}} Filioque, {{the decisive}} thing in this defence lies {{precisely}} in the point that in using the Filioque the Romans do not imply a [...] "cause" [...] other than the Father.

If Roman Catholic theology {{would be ready to}} admit that the Son in no way constitutes a [...] "cause" [...] (aition) in the procession of the Spirit, this would bring the two traditions much closer to each other with regard to the Filioque."

2500|$|A {{contemporary}} theory {{among some}} modern archaeologists and biblical scholars {{is that the}} stories in the Hebrew scriptures about the range {{and power of the}} United Kingdom of Israel are exaggerated by its authors. Charles Pope outlines the work of Ahmed Osman in support of one aspect of this theory, [...] "that the story of Solomon was patterned specifically after the life of Amenhotep III." [...] The article points out that “To be consistent with the pattern of other great Bronze and Iron Age cultures in the ancient Near East (Egyptian, Babylonian, Assyrian, and Hittite), it would be expected that numerous documents, art, and inscriptions on buildings or public monuments would have been left by such a great king or by his descendants later in honor of him. Yet no article of any kind bearing his name has ever been found.” At Gezer, no reference to Solomon was discovered, but a cartouche of Amenhotep III was, for it was [...] "during Amenhotep III's reign that Gezer and other major Palestine cities were refortified as royal Egyptian garrisons, and endowed with fine temples and palaces." [...] While no record of an Egyptian princess being given to a foreigner exists outside the Bible, [...] "It was customary and obligatory for Amenhotep III to marry 'the daughter of Pharaoh' in order to secure the throne. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>precisely</b> <b>what</b> was done when he was married to Sitamun, the daughter of his father, Pharaoh Thutmose IV." ...|$|E
2500|$|This {{is because}} Georgian has yet {{another level of}} split ergativity. In the aorist series, intransitive verbs behave differently. Second {{conjugation}} verbs behave as would normally be expected in an ergative language: the subject is declined in the least-marked case, the nominative case (terminologically equivalent in this instance to absolutive cases in other languages). Third conjugation verbs behave as if they belonged to an accusative system: the most-marked case (the ergative) marks the subject. The division between second and third conjugations is a convenient way to remember the difference, but in fact they both contain intransitive verbs, and as a whole the behaviour of these verbs follows an active alignment. In an active language, intranstive verbs are subdivided into two classes. The division is usually based on semantic criteria regarding {{the nature of the}} subject and the verb; for example, if the subject identifies an agent (an active or intentional performer of the action of the verb), then it might be marked with one case (e.g. the ergative), while if the subject identifies an experiencer of the event or one who does not actively initiate it, then it might be marked with another case (e.g. the absolutive or nominative). What might be called the [...] "most active" [...] case, then, marks the subject of a transitive verb, while the [...] "least active" [...] or [...] "most patientive" [...] case is that used to mark a direct object. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>precisely</b> <b>what</b> happens in Georgian, in the restricted environment of the second or third conjugation verbs in the aorist series.|$|E

60|$|It is {{needless to}} inform the reader, I trust, that I do not think this {{particular}} case in the least likely; or that I am only using it {{for the sake of}} lucidity. Even as it stands, it would not necessarily make a man believe the traditional story, but it would make him guess that it was some sort of tradition of some sort of truth; that there was something in it, and much more in it than even he himself had imagined. And the point of it would be precisely that his reason had not anticipated the extent of his revelation. He has proved the improbable, not the probable thing. Reason had already taught him the reasonable part; but facts had taught him the fantastic part. He will certainly conclude that the whole story is very much more valid than anybody has supposed. Now as I have already said, it is not in the least likely that this will happen touching this particular tale of Palestine. But <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>precisely</b> <b>what</b> really has happened touching the most sacred and tremendous of all the tales of Palestine. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>precisely</b> <b>what</b> has happened touching that central figure, round which the monster and the champion are alike only ornamental symbols; and by the right of whose tragedy even St. George's Cross does not belong to St. George. It {{is not likely to be}} true of the desert duel between George and the Dragon; but it is already true of the desert duel between Jesus and the Devil. St. George is but a servant and the Dragon is but a symbol, but it is precisely about the central reality, the mystery of Christ and His mastery of the powers of darkness, that this very paradox has proved itself a fact.|$|E
