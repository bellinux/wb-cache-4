40|$|Abstract—Overthe <b>past</b> <b>half-century,</b> {{there have}} been many {{advances}} in the design, construction, and implantation of joint prostheses, resulting in a high percentage of successful long-term outcomes. One of the most common concerns of both patients and physicians is the problem of joint replacements becoming loose over time.

Multidisciplinary research team studies are needed for an improvement in understanding in pathophysiological mechanisms of joint implant loosening and failure, which is the key point to improve implant survival and to minimize revisions.

6000|$|There is a disposition, I know, {{in myself}} {{as well as}} in others, to wriggle away from this verity, to find so much good in the {{collapse}} that has come to the mad direction of Europe for <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>half-century</b> as to make it on the whole almost a beneficial thing.

Better had he been awake--or never there. In Venetia Captain Pirelli, whose task it was to keep me out of mischief in the war zone, was insistent upon the way in which all Venetia was being opened up by the new military roads; there has been scarcely a new road made in Venetia since Napoleon drove his straight, poplar-bordered highways through the land. M. Joseph Reinach, who was my companion upon the French front, was equally impressed by the stirring up and exchange of ideas in the villages due to the movement of the war. Charles Lamb's story of the discovery of roast pork comes into one's head with an effect of repartee. More than ideas are exchanged in the war zone, and it is doubtful how far the sanitary precautions of the military authorities avails against a considerable propaganda of disease. A more serious argument for the good of war is that it evokes heroic qualities that it has brought out almost incredible quantities of courage, devotion, and individual romance that did not show in the suffocating peace time that preceded the war. The reckless and beautiful zeal {{of the women in the}} British and French munition factories, for example, the gaiety and fearlessness of the common soldiers everywhere; these things have always been there--like champagne sleeping in bottles in a cellar. But was there any need to throw a bomb into the cellar? ...|$|E
