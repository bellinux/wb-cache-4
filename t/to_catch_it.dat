5|$|In South Asia, it is {{advisable}} {{to take the}} snake which has bitten a person, if it has been killed, and carry it along {{to the hospital for}} possible identification by medical staff using scale diagrams so that an informed decision can be taken them as to whether and which anti-venom is to be administered. However, attempts <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>it</b> or kill the venomous snake are not advised as the snake may bite more people.|$|E
5|$|He {{played in}} all four of England's games at the 1962 FIFA World Cup in Chile, scoring one goal in the 3–1 victory over Argentina before playing in the quarter-final defeat to Brazil. During the defeat to Brazil a stray dog ran onto the pitch and evaded all of the players' efforts <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>it</b> until Greaves got down on all fours to beckon the animal. The Brazilian player Garrincha thought the {{incident}} was so amusing that he took the dog home as a pet.|$|E

5|$|Specifically, {{the video}} {{opens with a}} boy with a {{basketball}} in his bag walking out of a car park. The basketball then begins to bounce out of the bag, jumps out of the city streets and gets into a Lada taxi. After that, it continues to bounce and causes troubles in an office. Its owner struggles to chase the ball but then manages <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>it</b> for a second. Unfortunately, the ball escapes and is run over by a truck driven by The Chemical Brothers. The basketball re-inflates after the accident, jumps into and eventually gets trapped inside an old phone booth near Baross Street, swells to an enormous size, and explodes.|$|E
5|$|The lead {{would be}} {{augmented}} {{in the sixth}} when Carl Crawford hit a line drive that just cleared the right field wall for a home run. Though it appeared a fan may have reached over the wall <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>it,</b> NL manager Tony La Russa did not challenge the umpires' call. The NL got a run back {{in the bottom of}} the inning when Carlos Beltrán led off with a triple and scored on a sacrifice fly by Griffey. The AL added some insurance runs in the eighth when Víctor Martínez hit a two-run home run just inside the left field foul pole to give the AL a 5–2 lead.|$|E
5|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{directed}} by director duo Ne-o and shot in 16 mm film in various places in Budapest, Hungary. The visual, which features a basketball bouncing around the streets with its owner running <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>it,</b> drew comparisons with the 1956 short film The Red Balloon. Another visual, created by director Adam Smith for an alternate version of the song, was donated to the charity group Good for Nothing's 50/50 Make or Break campaign in 2011. The track also received a remix from DFA, whose version received much acclaim from critics.|$|E

5|$|In most jumping spiders, {{the main}} eyes focus {{accurately}} on an object {{up to about}} 75cm away. However, P. schultzi does not react at all to objectives when the light is under 100lux. Between 100 and 500lux, it detects and approaches the objective from distances up to 6cm, from 500lux to 1500lux, its response distance increases gradually {{to a maximum of}} about 10cm, and stronger light causes no increase in the response distance. For comparison, Trite auricoma swivels towards a movement up to 75cm away and approaches targets from about 20cm. Perhaps P. schultzi gains little from being alerted to objectives at distances because this spider moves so slowly that it is very unlikely to reach a more distant target in time <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ash soon {{comes to}} realize that the Pikachu refuses to go inside his Poké Ball and prefers his independence. As Ash carries the {{reluctant}} Pikachu, he hopes that they can be friends, but Pikachu acts aloof and openly shows his distrust of Ash. Just then, the two stumble upon a Pidgey in the wild and Ash unsuccessfully tries <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>it</b> by throwing a Poké Ball. Ash uses his Pokédex and finds out that in order to catch a Pokémon, a trainer must first use their Pokémon to battle it, thereby weakening it, to be caught by a Poké Ball. With Pikachu being uncooperative, Ash tries to fight the Pidgey himself, but is easily beaten, which greatly amuses Pikachu. The Pidgey escapes and Ash finds a Rattata rummaging through his pack. He chases the Pokémon off as he hears cooing behind him. He turns to see several Pidgey gathered in the tall grass. Frustrated, Ash throws a rock at what he believes is the Pidgey. However, {{it turns out to be}} a Spearow, which starts attacking Pikachu and Ash. Pikachu shocks Spearow, and in the process alerts a whole flock. The angered Spearow flock gives chase and eventually catches up and attacks Pikachu. Ash quickly grabs Pikachu and dives down a waterfall in order to escape from the flock of Spearow, and the two are fished out down river by a young girl named Misty, who tells Ash to take the injured Pikachu to the Pokémon Center in Viridian City. Seeing the Spearow flock approaching, Ash escapes with Pikachu taking Misty's bike.|$|E
5|$|At dawn on June 14 the Spanish fleet {{bore down}} off the Giglio Island in a line astern with the galleons and the galleys at the {{forefront}} and 8 lagging vessels closing the formation. Admiral Brézé formed his fleet in a line shortly after, alternating galleons and galleys, and sailed westward in a gentle breeze, closed with Linhares' ships. At 9:00 PM. Brézé had approached four miles to the Spanish, when, due to the lightness of the wind, the galleons of the two fleets had to be towed by the galleys while awaiting to be at windward. Brézé, aboard his flagship Grand Saint-Louis, {{stood in front of}} the line flanked by Vice-admiral Louis de Foucault de Saint-Germain Beaupré, comte du Daugnon's la Lune and Rear-admiral Jules de Montigny's le Soleil. His ship was in tow of Lieutenant-General Vinguerre's Patrone galley. Fifteen other vessels composed the French line of battle, each one towed by a galley. Montade's six-ship division was left in reserve. Both fleets sailed along each other until Linhares, thanks to the superior number of galleys that he had, gained the windward and was able to move towards the French line, attempting to overrun its line <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>it</b> between two fires. Linhares had in tow Pimienta's flag galleon Santiago; don Álvaro de Bazán del Viso, general of the Neapolitan galleys, the galleon Trinidad, flagship of Admiral Pablo de Contreras; and Enrique de Benavides, general of the Sicilian galleys, other large Spanish galleons.|$|E

5|$|England resumed on {{the second}} day at 231/7 amid dark skies and the threat of rain; Australia was unable to break through despite taking the new ball. Bedser stubbornly defied the Australians, playing with a {{straight}} bat and stretching forward onto the front foot to block the ball. Tallon dropped Compton for the third time, off the bowling of Johnston when the batsman was on 73. Lindwall bowled well below his top pace in the morning session and the batsmen slowly accumulated their runs. Bedser was the more defensive of the two Englishmen, and Compton drove Toshack past mid on for a four to register his second century of the series, after 235 minutes of batting. Lindwall then beat Compton in each of his last three overs before lunch, but the Englishman survived. England reached lunch at 323/7 having added 92 runs without losing a wicket. Compton was on 123 and Bedser on 37, having brought up their century partnership. Five minutes were lost in the morning session when a stray dog invaded the playing arena and evaded policemen and a number of Australian fielders who attempted <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
5|$|Thompson was a {{stand-up}} goaltender, rarely falling on both knees {{to stop a}} puck. He {{was one of the}} first NHL goaltenders to catch the puck with his hand to make a save, and helped popularize the technique. Using gloves that were smaller than those of other players, he was among the best puck-catchers of his era. He stood in the way of the puck with minimal padding, risking being struck when moving <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>it</b> instead of simply deflecting it away from the net. His signature technique, very often featured in photographs of him, involved dropping to one knee with the paddle of his goalstick covering the five-hole, and extending his glove to cover the left side of the net. Although he caught the puck with his glove, he did so without gloves resembling the modern blocker and trapper glove combination. Thompson was described by Johnny Bower, a former goaltender who was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame, as a good puckhandler, and one of the best of his time at forward passing. In the 1935–36 season, Thompson became the first goaltender to get an assist by intentionally passing the puck with his stick to a fellow player.|$|E
5|$|The {{tactical}} {{decision that}} precedes almost every {{play in a}} baseball game involves pitch selection. By gripping and then releasing the baseball in a certain manner, and by throwing it at a certain speed, pitchers can cause the baseball to break to either side, or downward, as it approaches the batter. Among the resulting wide variety of pitches that may be thrown, the four basic types are the fastball, the changeup (or off-speed pitch), and two breaking balls—the curveball and the slider. Pitchers have different repertoires of pitches they are skillful at throwing. Conventionally, before each pitch, the catcher signals the pitcher what type of pitch to throw, {{as well as its}} general vertical and/or horizontal location. If there is disagreement on the selection, the pitcher may shake off the sign and the catcher will call for a different pitch. With a runner on base and taking a lead, the pitcher may attempt a pickoff, a quick throw to a fielder covering the base to keep the runner's lead in check or, optimally, effect a tag out. Pickoff attempts, however, are subject to rules that severely restrict the pitcher's movements before and during the pickoff attempt. Violation of any one of these rules could result in the umpire calling a balk against the pitcher, with the result being runners on base, if any, advance one base with impunity. If an attempted stolen base is anticipated, the catcher may call for a pitchout, a ball thrown deliberately off the plate, allowing the catcher <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>it</b> while standing and throw quickly to a base. Facing a batter with a strong tendency to hit {{to one side of the}} field, the fielding team may employ a shift, with most or all of the fielders moving to the left or right of their usual positions. With a runner on third base, the infielders may play in, moving closer to home plate to improve the odds of throwing out the runner on a ground ball, though a sharply hit grounder is more likely to carry through a drawn-in infield.|$|E

25|$|Table 1 shows a {{relationship}} of smaller peel angles correlating with a higher skill level of surfer. Smaller wave peel angles increase the velocities of waves.

25|$|Another {{tradition}} is the homecoming cane toss, which {{dates from the}} 1930s. Before the university's homecoming football game, third-year law students run from {{the north end of}} the football field at Camp Randall Stadium to the south end wearing bowler hats and carrying canes. When the students reach the goalpost on the south end of the field, they attempt to throw their canes over the goalpost. Legend has it that if the student successfully throws the cane over the goalpost and catches it, she will win her first case; if she fails <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>it,</b> the opposite will hold true.|$|E
25|$|Lacrosse has {{its origins}} in a tribal game played by eastern Woodlands Native Americans and by some Plains Indians tribes {{in what is now}} Canada.
