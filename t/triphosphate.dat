5|$|Coenzymes {{are small}} organic {{molecules}} {{that can be}} loosely or tightly bound to an enzyme. Coenzymes transport chemical groups from one enzyme to another. Examples include NADH, NADPH and adenosine <b>triphosphate</b> (ATP). Some coenzymes, such as flavin mononucleotide (FMN), flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), and tetrahydrofolate (THF), are derived from vitamins. These coenzymes cannot be synthesized by the body de novo and closely related compounds (vitamins) must be acquired from the diet. The chemical groups carried include the hydride ion (H−) carried by NAD or NADP+, the phosphate group carried by adenosine <b>triphosphate,</b> the acetyl group carried by coenzyme A, formyl, methenyl or methyl groups carried by folic acid and the methyl group carried by S-adenosylmethionine.|$|E
5|$|Helicases are {{proteins}} {{that are a}} type of molecular motor. They use the chemical energy in nucleoside triphosphates, predominantly adenosine <b>triphosphate</b> (ATP), to break hydrogen bonds between bases and unwind the DNA double helix into single strands. These enzymes are essential for most processes where enzymes need to access the DNA bases.|$|E
5|$|A third protein can {{sometimes}} be involved in type II toxin-antitoxin systems. In {{the case of the}} aforementioned MazEF addiction module, in addition to the toxin and antitoxin there is a regulatory protein involved called MazG. MazG protein interacts with E. colis Era GTPase and is described as a 'nucleoside <b>triphosphate</b> pyrophosphohydrolase,' which hydrolyses nucleoside triphosphates to monophosphates. Later research showed that MazG is transcribed in the same polycistronic mRNA as MazE and MazF, and that MazG bound the MazF toxin to further inhibit its activity.|$|E
50|$|Most {{transcripts}} originate using adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP) and, to {{a lesser}} extent, guanosine-5'-triphosphate (GTP) (purine nucleoside <b>triphosphates)</b> at the +1 site. Uridine-5'-triphosphate (UTP) and cytidine-5'-triphosphate (CTP) (pyrimidine nucleoside <b>triphosphates)</b> are disfavoured at the initiation site.|$|R
50|$|Note that, originally, {{biochemical}} nomenclature distinguished synthetases and synthases. Under {{the original}} definition, synthases {{do not use}} energy from nucleoside <b>triphosphates</b> (such as ATP, GTP, CTP, TTP, and UTP), whereas synthetases do use nucleoside <b>triphosphates.</b> However, the Joint Commission on Biochemical Nomenclature (JCBN) dictates that 'synthase' {{can be used with}} any enzyme that catalyzes synthesis (whether or not it uses nucleoside <b>triphosphates),</b> whereas 'synthetase' is to be used synonymously with 'ligase'.|$|R
40|$|Removal of {{nucleoside}} <b>triphosphates</b> from extracts prepared from bacteriophage T 7 -infected Escherichia coli {{results in}} a stringent requirement for added ATP to form infective phage particles by in vitro packaging of bacteriophage T 7 DNA. Optimal packaging efficiency was achieved at a concentration of about 1. 25 mM. Other nucleoside <b>triphosphates</b> could be substituted for ATP, {{but none of the}} common nucleoside <b>triphosphates</b> was as effective as ATP in promoting in vitro encapsulation...|$|R
5|$|Carbon dioxide (CO2), {{adenosine}} monophosphate (AMP) and phosphate groups (PP) are released as waste products. Luciferase catalyzes the reaction, {{which may be}} mediated by cofactors such as calcium (Ca2+) or magnesium (Mg2+) ions, and for some types of luciferin (L) also the energy-carrying molecule adenosine <b>triphosphate</b> (ATP). The reaction can occur either inside or outside the cell. In bacteria such as Aliivibrio, the expression of genes related to bioluminescence {{is controlled by the}} lux operon.|$|E
5|$|In some species, the {{luciferase}} requires other cofactors such as calcium or magnesium ions, {{and sometimes}} also the energy-carrying molecule adenosine <b>triphosphate</b> (ATP). In evolution, luciferins vary little: one in particular, coelenterazine, {{is found in}} eleven different animal (phyla), though in some of these, the animals obtain it through their diet. Conversely, luciferases vary widely between different species, and consequently bioluminescence has arisen over forty times in evolutionary history.|$|E
5|$|Oxidative {{phosphorylation}} (or OXPHOS in short) is {{the metabolic}} pathway in which cells use enzymes to oxidize nutrients, thereby releasing energy {{which is used}} to produce adenosine <b>triphosphate</b> (ATP). In most eukaryotes, this takes place inside mitochondria. Almost all aerobic organisms carry out oxidative phosphorylation. This pathway is probably so pervasive because it is a highly efficient way of releasing energy, compared to alternative fermentation processes such as anaerobic glycolysis.|$|E

40|$|Introduction Boiling ethanol {{extraction}} is a {{frequently used}} method for metabolomics studies of biological samples. However, {{the stability of}} several central carbon metabolites, including nucleotide <b>triphosphates,</b> {{and the influence of}} the cellular matrix on their degradation have not been addressed. Objectives To study how a complex cellular matrix extracted from yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) may affect the degradation profiles of nucleotide <b>triphosphates</b> extracted under boiling ethanol conditions. Methods We present a double-labelling LC-MS approach with a C- 13 -labeled yeast cellular extract as complex surrogate matrix, and (CN) -C- 13 -N- 15 -labeled nucleotides as internal standards, to study the effect of the yeast matrix on the degradation of nucleotide <b>triphosphates.</b> Results While nucleotide <b>triphosphates</b> were degraded to the corresponding diphosphates in pure solutions, degradation was prevented {{in the presence of the}} yeast matrix under typical boiling ethanol extraction conditions. Conclusions Extraction of biological samples under boiling ethanol extraction conditions that rapidly inactivate enzyme activity are suitable for labile central energy metabolites such as nucleotide <b>triphosphates</b> due to the stabilizing effect of the yeast matrix. The basis of this phenomenon requires further study...|$|R

5|$|When {{combined}} with oxygen and hydrogen, carbon can form many groups of important biological compounds including sugars, lignans, chitins, alcohols, fats, and aromatic esters, carotenoids and terpenes. With nitrogen it forms alkaloids, {{and with the}} addition of sulfur also it forms antibiotics, amino acids, and rubber products. With the addition of phosphorus to these other elements, it forms DNA and RNA, the chemical-code carriers of life, and adenosine <b>triphosphate</b> (ATP), the most important energy-transfer molecule in all living cells.|$|E
5|$|Another {{mechanism}} involves {{effects on}} the mitochondrial respiratory enzyme chain {{that is responsible for}} effective tissue utilization of oxygen. Carbon monoxide binds to cytochrome oxidase with less affinity than oxygen, so it is possible that it requires significant intracellular hypoxia before binding. This binding interferes with aerobic metabolism and efficient adenosine <b>triphosphate</b> synthesis. Cells respond by switching to anaerobic metabolism, causing anoxia, lactic acidosis, and eventual cell death. The rate of dissociation between carbon monoxide and cytochrome oxidase is slow, causing a relatively prolonged impairment of oxidative metabolism.|$|E
5|$|Archaea {{exhibit a}} great variety of {{chemical}} reactions in their metabolism and use many sources of energy. These reactions are classified into nutritional groups, depending on energy and carbon sources. Some archaea obtain energy from inorganic compounds such as sulfur or ammonia (they are lithotrophs). These include nitrifiers, methanogens and anaerobic methane oxidisers. In these reactions one compound passes electrons to another (in a redox reaction), releasing energy to fuel the cell's activities. One compound acts as an electron donor and one as an electron acceptor. The energy released is used to generate adenosine <b>triphosphate</b> (ATP) through chemiosmosis, the same basic process that happens in the mitochondrion of eukaryotic cells.|$|E
40|$|The {{reaction}} of phosphorylation and phosphonylation of an oligodeoxynucleotide 3 ′-terminal hydroxyl (oligodeoxynucleotidyl kinase activity) catalyzed by calf thymus terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TDT) was found. <b>Triphosphates</b> modified at Pα-, Pα,γ- or Pα,β,γ-residues served as low-molecular weight substrates. The reaction was TDT specific; human DNA polymerases α and β, {{as well as}} AMV reverse transcriptase did not catalyze it. The donor activity of modified <b>triphosphates</b> or triphosphonates depended on their structure and was increased {{with an increase in}} their hydrophobicity. The substrate activity of some modified <b>triphosphates</b> was up to one order of magnitude higher than that of ddTTP...|$|R

The reaction of adenosine phosphoropiperidate with uridine 5 ʹ- and cytidine 5 ʹ-diphosphates {{in the presence of}} 4, 5 -dicyanoimidazole (DCI) afforded the desired dinucleoside <b>triphosphates</b> in good isolated yields...|$|R
30|$|Chemically {{modified}} nucleotides provide several advantages, such as enhanced nuclease resistance, {{an improved}} binding affinity, increased oligonucleotide pool diversity and improved {{success rate of}} selection. Therefore a modified oligonucleotide pool is becoming more popular for aptamer selection. Although chemically modified nucleotides and deoxynucleotide <b>triphosphates</b> cannot be recognized by wild-type T 7 RNA polymerases and A-type DNA polymerases, such as Taq polymerase, fortunately, modified nucleotide <b>triphosphates</b> (2 ′-fluoro pyrimidines, 2 ′-O-methyl nucleotides) and functionalized 2 ′-deoxynucleotide <b>triphosphates</b> with AA-like residues (e.g., indole, benzyl, or alkyne moieties) can be recognized by some mutant RNA polymerases [137] and B-type polymerases, and Pwo and Vent (exo-) DNA polymerases [138], respectively.|$|R
5|$|Different glands are {{specialized}} {{for different}} pheromones to attract mates. Pheromones from species of Rutelinae are produced from epithelial cells lining the inner {{surface of the}} apical abdominal segments; amino acid-based pheromones of Melolonthinae are produced from eversible glands on the abdominal apex. Other species produce different types of pheromones. Dermestids produce esters, and species of Elateridae produce fatty acid-derived aldehydes and acetates. To attract a mate, fireflies (Lampyridae) use modified fat body cells with transparent surfaces backed with reflective uric acid crystals to produce light by bioluminescence. Light production is highly efficient, by oxidation of luciferin catalyzed by enzymes (luciferases) {{in the presence of}} adenosine <b>triphosphate</b> (ATP) and oxygen, producing oxyluciferin, carbon dioxide, and light.|$|E
5|$|Formation of the {{complexes}} of {{the type}} Cm(n-C3H7-BTP)3, where BTP stands for 2,6-di(1,2,4-triazin-3-yl)pyridine, in solutions containing n-C3H7-BTP and Cm3+ ions has been confirmed by EXAFS. Some of these BTP-type complexes selectively interact with curium and therefore are useful in its selective separation from lanthanides and another actinides. Dissolved Cm3+ ions bind with many organic compounds, such as hydroxamic acid, urea, fluorescein and adenosine <b>triphosphate.</b> Many of these compounds are related to biological activity of various microorganisms. The resulting complexes exhibit strong yellow-orange emission under UV light excitation, which is convenient not only for their detection, but also for studying the interactions between the Cm3+ ion and the ligands via changes in the half-life (of the order ~0.1 ms) and spectrum of the fluorescence.|$|E
5|$|One central {{coenzyme}} is adenosine <b>triphosphate</b> (ATP), {{the universal}} energy currency of cells. This nucleotide {{is used to}} transfer chemical energy between different chemical reactions. There {{is only a small}} amount of ATP in cells, but as it is continuously regenerated, the human body can use about its own weight in ATP per day. ATP acts as a bridge between catabolism and anabolism. Catabolism breaks down molecules, and anabolism puts them together. Catabolic reactions generate ATP, and anabolic reactions consume it. It also serves as a carrier of phosphate groups in phosphorylation reactions.|$|E

40|$|High {{performance}} {{liquid chromatography}} {{was used to}} measure ribonucleoside <b>triphosphates</b> in microbial samples. Anion exchange columns in a radial compression module were used to separate and quantify purine and pyrimidine ribonucleotides. Endogenous ribonucleoside <b>triphosphates</b> were extracted from Escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa using three different solvents, namely trifluorocetic acid (TFA; 0. 5 M), trichloroacetic acid (TCA; 6 per cent w/v) and formic acid (1. 0 M) Extracts were assayed for uridine 5 '-triphosphate (ATP), and guanosine 5 '-triphosphate (GTP) by using anion exchange radial compression high performance (pressure) liquid chromatography. The three extraction produres were compared for yield of <b>triphosphates.</b> E. coli, the TFA extraction procedure was more sensitive and reliable than TCA and formic acid extraction procedures, but, in P. aeruginosa, the best yields of ATP and GTP were obrained following extraction with TFA. Yields of UTP and CTP increased when extraction was performed in TCA. These data illustrate that different extraction produres produce different measures for different <b>triphosphates,</b> a point often overlooked...|$|R
5|$|Polymerases are {{enzymes that}} {{synthesize}} polynucleotide chains from nucleoside triphosphates. The sequence {{of their products}} is created based on existing polynucleotide chains—which are called templates. These enzymes function by repeatedly adding a nucleotide to the 3′ hydroxyl group {{at the end of}} the growing polynucleotide chain. As a consequence, all polymerases work in a 5′ to 3′ direction. In the active site of these enzymes, the incoming nucleoside <b>triphosphate</b> base-pairs to the template: this allows polymerases to accurately synthesize the complementary strand of their template. Polymerases are classified according to the type of template that they use.|$|E
5|$|Hydrogen cyanide is a {{poisonous}} gas that interferes with cellular respiration. Cyanide prevents the cell from producing adenosine <b>triphosphate</b> (ATP) by binding {{to one of}} the proteins involved in the electron transport chain. This protein, cytochrome c oxidase, contains several subunits and has ligands containing iron groups. The cyanide component of Zyklon B can bind at one of these iron groups, heme a3, forming a more stabilized compound through metal-to-ligand pi bonding. As a result of the formation of this new iron-cyanide complex, the electrons that would situate themselves on the heme a3 group can no longer do so. Instead, these electrons destabilize the compound; thus, the heme group no longer accept them. Consequently, electron transport is halted, and cells can no longer produce the energy needed to synthesize ATP. In a human weighing , death occurs within two minutes of inhaling 70mg of hydrogen cyanide.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, {{experiments}} using minced muscle cells {{demonstrated that}} cellular respiration using one oxygen atom can form two adenosine <b>triphosphate</b> (ATP) molecules, and, in 1941, {{the concept of}} the phosphate bonds of ATP being a form of energy in cellular metabolism was developed by Fritz Albert Lipmann. In the following years, the mechanism behind cellular respiration was further elaborated, although its link to the mitochondria was not known. The introduction of tissue fractionation by Albert Claude allowed mitochondria to be isolated from other cell fractions and biochemical analysis to be conducted on them alone. In 1946, he concluded that cytochrome oxidase and other enzymes responsible for the respiratory chain were isolated to the mitchondria. Eugene Kennedy and Albert Lehninger discovered in 1948 that mitochondria are the site of oxidative phosphorylation in eukaryotes. Over time, the fractionation method was further developed, improving the quality of the mitochondria isolated, and other elements of cell respiration were determined to occur in the mitochondria.|$|E

50|$|Other biologically {{important}} derivatives of deoxyribose include mono-, di-, and <b>triphosphates,</b> {{as well as}} 3′-5′ cyclic monophosphates.|$|R
5|$|In drug design it is {{important}} to consider the concentrations of substrates to which the target enzymes are exposed. For example, some protein kinase inhibitors have chemical structures that are similar to adenosine <b>triphosphate,</b> one of the substrates of these enzymes. However, drugs that are simple competitive inhibitors will have to compete with the high concentrations of ATP in the cell. Protein kinases can also be inhibited by competition at the binding sites where the kinases interact with their substrate proteins, and most proteins are present inside cells at concentrations much lower than the concentration of ATP. As a consequence, if two protein kinase inhibitors both bind in the active site with similar affinity, but only one has to compete with ATP, then the competitive inhibitor at the protein-binding site will inhibit the enzyme more effectively.|$|E
5|$|In human cells, and {{eukaryotic}} {{cells in}} general, DNA {{is found in}} two cellular locations— inside the nucleus and inside the mitochondria. Nuclear DNA (nDNA) exists as chromatin during non-replicative stages of the cell cycle and is condensed into aggregate structures known as chromosomes during cell division. In either state the DNA is highly compacted and wound up around bead-like proteins called histones. Whenever a cell needs to express the genetic information encoded in its nDNA the required chromosomal region is unravelled, genes located therein are expressed, and then the region is condensed back to its resting conformation. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is located inside mitochondria organelles, exists in multiple copies, and is also tightly associated {{with a number of}} proteins to form a complex known as the nucleoid. Inside mitochondria, reactive oxygen species (ROS), or free radicals, byproducts of the constant production of adenosine <b>triphosphate</b> (ATP) via oxidative phosphorylation, create a highly oxidative environment that is known to damage mtDNA. A critical enzyme in counteracting the toxicity of these species is superoxide dismutase, which is present in both the mitochondria and cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells.|$|E
5|$|Activation of AMPK was {{required}} for metformin's inhibitory effect on liver glucose production. AMPK is an enzyme that {{plays an important role}} in insulin signaling, whole body energy balance and the metabolism of glucose and fats. AMPK Activation {{was required}} for an increase in the expression of small heterodimer partner, which in turn inhibited the expression of the hepatic gluconeogenic genes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glucose 6-phosphatase. Metformin is frequently used in research along with AICA ribonucleotide as an AMPK agonist. Mouse models in which the genes for AMPKα1 and α2 catalytic subunits (Prkaa1/2) or LKB1, an upstream kinase of AMPK, had been knocked out in hepatocytes, have raised doubts over the role of AMPK, since the effect of metformin was not abolished by loss of AMPK function. The mechanism by which biguanides increase the activity of AMPK remains uncertain; however, metformin increases the concentration of cytosolic adenosine monophosphate (AMP) (as opposed to a change in total AMP or total AMP/adenosine <b>triphosphate).</b> Increased cellular AMP has been proposed to explain the inhibition of glucagon-induced increase in cAMP and activation of PKA. Metformin and other biguanides may antagonize the action of glucagon, thus reducing fasting glucose levels. Metformin also induces a profound shift in the faecal microbial community profile in diabetic mice and this may contribute to its mode of action possibly through an effect on glucagon-like peptide-1 secretion.|$|E

40|$|We have {{demonstrated}} that acylphosphatase possesses ATP-diphosphohydrolase (apyrase-like) activity. In fact, acylphosphatase first catalyses the hydrolysis of the gamma-phosphate group of nucleoside <b>triphosphates,</b> and then attacks the beta-phosphate group of the initially produced nucleoside diphosphates, generating nucleoside monophosphates. In contrast, it binds nucleoside monophosphates but does not catalyse their hydrolyses. The calculated k(cat) values for the nucleoside triphosphatase activity of acylphosphatase are of the same order of magnitude as those displayed by certain G-proteins. An acidic environment enhances the apyrase-like activity of acylphosphatase. The true nucleotide substrates of acylphosphatase are free nucleoside di- and <b>triphosphates,</b> {{as indicated by the}} Mg(2 +) ion inhibition of the activity. We have also demonstrated that, although nucleoside <b>triphosphates</b> are still hydrolysed at pH 7. 2 and 37 degrees C, in the presence of millimolar Mg(2 +) concentrations this occurs at a lower rate. Taken together with the previously observed strong increase of acylphosphatase levels during induced cell differentiation, our findings suggest that acylphosphatase plays {{an active role in the}} differentiation process (as well as in other processes, such as apoptosis) by modulating the ratio between the cellular levels of nucleoside diphosphates and nucleoside <b>triphosphates...</b>|$|R
