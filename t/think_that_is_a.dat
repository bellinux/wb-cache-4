The executive branch of our government approved 771 different export licenses for sale of dual-use technology to Iraq. I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> devastating record.|$|E

[...] He added, [...] "...Fate dealt us this card, and I don't think we've done particularly badly with it. Music today seems so very worthy, so very dull. Nobody wants to stick their neck out any more, and I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> great pity. We did, and we left our mark." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a paper {{published}} in 1988, John S. Michael reported that Samuel G. Morton's original 19th-century {{study was conducted}} with less bias than Gould had described; that [...] "contrary to Gould's interpretation ... Morton's research was conducted with integrity". Nonetheless, Michael's analysis suggested that there were discrepancies in Morton's craniometric calculations, that his data tables were scientifically unsound, and he [...] "cannot be excused for his errors, or his unfair comparisons of means". Michael later complained that some authors, including J. Philippe Rushton, selectively [...] "cherry-picked facts" [...] from his research to support their own claims. He lamented, [...] "Some people have turned the Morton-Gould affair into a all or nothing debate in which either one side is right or the other side is right, and I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> mistake. Both men made mistakes and proving one wrong does not prove the other one right." ...|$|E

25|$|The Mistralian orthography of Provençal {{is more or}} less phonemic but not diasystemic and {{is closer}} to the French {{spelling}} and therefore more specific to Provençal; its users are divided between the ones <b>that</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> Provençal <b>is</b> <b>a</b> part of Occitan and the ones <b>that</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> Provençal <b>is</b> <b>a</b> separate language.|$|R

2500|$|During the 2008 vice-presidential debate, Palin {{expressed}} {{support for}} a two-state solution to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, pledged to move the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and reiterated her support for Israel's survival. Specifically, Palin stated that [...] "Israel is our strongest and best ally in the Middle East. We have got to assure them that we will never allow a second Holocaust, despite, again, warnings from Iran and any other country that would seek to destroy Israel, {{that that is what}} they would like to see. We will support Israel. A two-state solution, building our embassy, also, in Jerusalem, those things that we look forward to being able to accomplish, with this peace-seeking nation, and they have a track record of being able to forge these peace agreements." [...] Regarding Joe Biden's support for Israel, Palin stated that [...] "I'm so encouraged to know that we both love Israel, and I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> good thing to get to agree on, Senator Biden. I respect your position on that." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 24 July, the Serbian government, expecting an Austrian {{declaration}} of war the next day, mobilized while Austria broke off diplomatic relations. The British Ambassador to Austria-Hungary reported to London: [...] "War is thought imminent. Wildest enthusiasm prevails in Vienna." [...] Asquith {{wrote in a letter}} to Venetia Stanley that he was worried that:"Russia is trying to drag us in. The news this morning is that Serbia had capitulated on the main points, but it is very doubtful if any reservations will be accepted by Austria, who is resolved upon a complete and final humiliation. The curious thing is that on many, if not most of the points, Austria has a good and Serbia a very bad case. But the Austrians are quite the stupidest people in Europe (as the Italians are the most perfidious), and there is a brutality about their mode of procedure, which will make most people <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> case of a big Power wantonly bullying a little one. Anyhow, it is the most dangerous situation of the last 40 years." [...] In order to stop a war, the Permanent Secretary of the British Foreign Office, Sir Arthur Nicolson, suggested again that a conference be held in London chaired by Britain, Germany, Italy and France to resolve the dispute between Austria and Serbia.|$|E

500|$|Despite the film's {{repeated}} use of Disney's {{characters and}} iconography, Wu explained, trademark law was not sufficient. [...] "Disney {{does not have}} some kind of general intellectual-property right in Disney World itself." [...] To make a trademark-infringement case against Moore, he continued, Disney would have to convince a court that the use of its protected imagery in the movie could reasonably lead viewers to believe that it had a role in the film's production, and he did not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> plausible argument. [...] "The scene where a Disney Princess attempts to crush a child seems to eliminate that possibility." ...|$|R
