5|$|Cats may bite humans when provoked, during play or when aggressive. Complications from cat bites can develop. A cat bite {{differs from}} the bites of other pets. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> teeth of a cat are sharp and pointed causing deep punctures. Skin usually closes rapidly over the bite and traps {{microorganisms}} that cause infection.|$|E
5|$|The blast {{furnaces}} {{used in the}} Imperial Smelting Process ("ISP") were developed from the standard lead blast furnace, but are fully sealed. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> zinc produced by these furnaces is recovered as metal from the vapor phase, {{and the presence of}} oxygen in the off-gas would result in the formation of zinc oxide.|$|E
5|$|A {{limitation}} of the radial velocity method used to detect Gliese 876 c is that only a lower limit on the planet's mass can be obtained. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> measured mass value depends on the inclination of the orbit, which is not determined by the radial velocity measurements. However, in a resonant system such as Gliese 876, gravitational interactions between the planets {{can be used to}} determine the true masses. Using this method, the inclination of the orbit can be determined, revealing the planet's true mass to be 0.72 times that of Jupiter.|$|E
50|$|NATO {{assigned}} its own reporting {{names to}} Soviet ships. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> official Soviet designation was unknown.|$|R
50|$|He was a (count (hakushaku) in the kazoku nobility system. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> head of <b>this</b> clan {{line and}} his heirs were ennobled in 1884.|$|R
50|$|The diary was not {{mentioned}} in the Ergenekon indictment. Görmüş said <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> diary <b>was</b> obtained illegally and therefore inadmissible in a court of law.|$|R
5|$|Another {{example is}} the Great Vowel Shift in English, which {{is the reason that}} the {{spelling}} of English vowels do not correspond well to their current pronunciation. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> vowel shift brought the already established orthography out of synchronization with pronunciation. Another source of sound change is the erosion of words as pronunciation gradually becomes increasingly indistinct and shortens words, leaving out syllables or sounds. This kind of change caused Latin mea domina to eventually become the French madame and American English ma'am.|$|E
5|$|At {{the base}} of the rank pyramid were the common soldiers: pedes (infantryman) and eques (cavalryman). Unlike his 2nd-century counterpart, the 4th-century soldier's food and {{equipment}} was not deducted from his salary (stipendium), but was provided free. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> stipendium, paid in debased silver denarii, was under Diocletian worth far less than in the 2nd century. It lost its residual value under Constantine and ceased to be paid regularly in mid-4th century.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, more recent work has {{suggested}} that the regular army of the 2nd century was considerably larger than the c. 300,000 traditionally assumed. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> 2nd-century auxilia were not just equal in numbers to the legions as in the early 1st century, but some 50% larger. The army of the Principate probably reached a peak of nearly 450,000 (excluding fleets and foederati) {{at the end of the}} 2nd century. Furthermore, the evidence is that the actual strength of 2nd-century units was typically much closer to official (c. 85%) than 4th century units.|$|E
25|$|During the mid-2000s, {{the club}} gained {{widespread}} attention in <b>the</b> Italian media, <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> Italian son of Diego Maradona, named Diego Sinagra {{was signed by}} the club.|$|R
50|$|Although the AllPeers {{client was}} open sourced in March 2007, the server source remains closed. AllPeers claimed <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> network {{must have a}} single, stable server {{instance}} to function reliably.|$|R
50|$|Cliff Richard, Melvyn Hayes and the Shadows were {{recalled}} to Elstree {{some weeks}} {{after completion of}} shooting to record Bachelor Boy. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> distributors felt the film was too short.|$|R
5|$|Because {{glass is}} very brittle in its solid state, {{it is often}} prone to {{cracking}} upon heating and cooling, especially if the heating and cooling are uneven. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> brittleness of glass {{does not allow for}} uneven thermal expansion. Glass that has been welded will usually need to be cooled very slowly and evenly through the glass transition, in a process called annealing, to relieve any internal stresses created by a temperature gradient.|$|E
5|$|Changes in {{the number}} of {{inhabitants}} is known throughout the population censuses conducted since 1793 in Calais. Note the massive growth in population from 13,529 in 1881 to 58,969 in 1886, a growth of 335.9%; <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> city of Saint Pierre merged with Calais in 1885. According to the census INSEE of 2008, Calais has 74,817 people (a decrease of 3% from 1999). The town's population ranked 60th nationally, down from 53rd in 1999.|$|E
5|$|For the Internet, the {{physical}} medium and {{data link protocol}} can vary several times as packets traverse the globe. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> Internet places no constraints on what physical medium or data link protocol is used. This leads {{to the adoption of}} media and protocols that best suit the local network situation. In practice, most intercontinental communication will use the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) protocol (or a modern equivalent) on top of optic fiber. This is because for most intercontinental communication the Internet shares the same infrastructure as the public switched telephone network.|$|E
50|$|The {{by-election}} was {{the last}} in the UK to date not held on a Thursday. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> opening game of the 1978 FIFA World Cup was on Thursday 1 June.|$|R
50|$|Initial {{copies of}} the release have a round sticker {{on the front of}} the CD jewel-case, stating 'Official Bootleg'. Whether <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> band had some issues with the sound-quality is unclear.|$|R
50|$|After {{their common}} goal had been reached, {{the two parties}} went their {{separate}} ways. In part, <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> liberal, business-friendly world-view on the one hand, and socialist ideas on the other, were irreconcilable.|$|R
5|$|From {{the figure}} 8, {{it is clear}} that an economy {{operating}} at a position where the MRS of either Crusoe or Friday is not equal to the MRT between coconuts and fish cannot be Pareto efficient. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> rate at which, say Friday is willing to trade coconuts for fish is different from the rate at which coconuts can be transformed into fish. Thus, {{there is a way to}} make Friday better off by rearranging the production pattern.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} iterations, no search {{algorithm}} that works only by comparing elements can exhibit better average and worst case performance than binary search. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> comparison tree representing binary search has the fewest levels possible as each level is filled completely with nodes {{if there are}} enough. Otherwise, the search algorithm can eliminate few elements in an iteration, {{increasing the number of}} iterations required in the average and worst case. This is the case for other search algorithms based on comparisons, as while they may work faster on some target values, the average performance over all elements is affected. This problem is solved by binary search, as dividing the array in half ensures that the size of both subarrays are as similar as possible.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} chapter Stace looks at mysticism and logic. He returns {{to the idea that}} {{theology}} and mystical philosophies (he gives the examples of Vedanta, Spinoza, Hegel, and Bradley) will always contain contradictions. Known as the doctrine of the Mystery of God, he maintains <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> intellect is inherently incapable of understanding the Ultimate. All attempts to state the nature of the ultimate necessarily produce contradictions.|$|E
50|$|Paget {{travelled}} to Dublin {{that night}} {{in a state of}} high excitement, having been given no written orders (it is unclear whether or not <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> politicians <b>were</b> reluctant to put anything in writing).|$|R
5|$|<b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> {{situation}} {{began to}} change in favour of the Allies. They had landed in North Africa while the Soviets were undertaking their great winter offensive, endangering, and eventually defeating, the German 6th Army around Stalingrad.|$|R
50|$|In 1997, Bombay duck {{was banned}} by the European Commission (EC). <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> EC {{prohibited}} fish imports from India other than from approved freezing and canning factories, and Bombay duck is not produced in a factory.|$|R
5|$|Metagenomics {{can provide}} {{valuable}} {{insights into the}} functional ecology of environmental communities. Metagenomic analysis of the bacterial consortia found in the defecations of Australian sea lions suggests that nutrient-rich sea lion faeces {{may be an important}} nutrient source for coastal ecosystems. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> bacteria that are expelled simultaneously with the defecations are adept at breaking down the nutrients in the faeces into a bioavailable form that can be taken up into the food chain.|$|E
5|$|No {{historical}} attestation of Sheshi {{is known}} for certain. Sheshi is absent from the Turin canon, a list of kings written on papyrus during the Ramesside period and which serves as the primary historical source for the second intermediate period. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> section of the papyrus covering the 13th to 17th Dynasties is heavily damaged {{and the problem of}} Seshi's chronological position cannot be resolved from the document.|$|E
5|$|P.exclamans {{tend to have}} smaller nests {{than other}} wasps, with {{typically}} fewer than one hundred individuals in a given nest. Because {{of the size of}} the nest, the queen tends to be the most active individual in the nest. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> queen has to monitor and directly control the activities of the nest. In addition to her reproductive role, the queen must also act as the pacemaker of the nest and synchronize the worker activity. These last two points have recently been disputed and the workers may be self organized. It has also been observed that the queen will act aggressively towards individuals that are the least active.|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} the 1941 {{season the}} club went into recess and did not field a team in the local {{competition}} until 1944. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> club lost so many members and players to the war effort.|$|R
25|$|General E. Kirby Smith {{recommended}} that Randal be promoted to brigadier general on November 8, 1863. No {{action was taken}} on the request. Historian Bruce S. Allardice says <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> brigade <b>was</b> well below brigade strength at the time.|$|R
50|$|Although {{public sector}} {{expanded}} very rapidly, {{the share of}} public sector in GDP and in total productive efforts <b>was</b> insignificant. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> agricultural sector <b>was</b> left to the private sector, which comprised about 80% of the national economy.|$|R
5|$|Structural {{coloration}} {{is responsible}} for the blues and greens of the feathers of many birds (the bee-eater, kingfisher and roller, for example), as well as many butterfly wings, beetle wing-cases (elytra) and (while rare among flowers) the gloss of buttercup petals. These are often iridescent, as in peacock feathers and nacreous shells such as of pearl oysters (Pteriidae) and Nautilus. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> reflected colour depends on the viewing angle, which in turn governs the apparent spacing of the structures responsible. Structural colours can be combined with pigment colours: peacock feathers are pigmented brown with melanin, while buttercup petals have both carotenoid pigments for yellowness and thin films for reflectiveness.|$|E
5|$|Tham Chee Ho contends that, {{based on}} the {{objective}} test set out in Chng Suan Tze, the fear that the courts will take over responsibility for national security matters is misplaced. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> courts do not review the actions taken by the executive for national security purposes, but merely determine whether the situation in fact involves national security issues. The Court of Appeal in Chng Suan Tze reflected this by holding that what was required to preserve national security was a matter solely for executive judgment.|$|E
5|$|The First Point of Aries, the {{location}} of the vernal equinox, is named for the constellation. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> Sun crossed the celestial equator from south to north in Aries more than two millennia ago. Hipparchus defined it in 130 BC. as a point south of Gamma Arietis. Because of the precession of the equinoxes, the First Point of Aries has since moved into Pisces and will move into Aquarius by around 2600 AD. The Sun now appears in Aries from late April through mid May, though the constellation is still associated with the beginning of spring.|$|E

50|$|Although {{this game}} {{produced}} Leaf, {{much of the}} staff for <b>this</b> game <b>was</b> outsourced. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> game <b>was</b> outside of the fantasy or true love scenario games that have become the companys backbone. Instead the game had twisted dark scenarios.|$|R
50|$|For {{many years}} after Gompers' attack, AFL {{officials}} largely ignored Brookwood. In part <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> college <b>was</b> independent, but in part it <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> AFL believed it could dominate (and thus control) workers' education efforts and turn them to its own purposes through the Workers' Education Bureau.|$|R
