[...] After initially exercising the stable's race {{horses in the}} early months of her pregnancy, she moved over to ponying and other activities. [...] , she and Sharp currently hope to have two children fairly close together, and after that, Napravnik has not ruled out a return to race riding but has not made any firm decisions. As she explained in February 2015, [...] "I'm satisfied with the accomplishments that I've made. If I feel like I really want to come back in a few years <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do it. The greatest thing is I don't have to." ...|$|E
500|$|Pilou Asbæk, who {{was cast}} to play Euron Greyjoy, spoke in an {{interview}} about the filming of the Kingsmoot saying [...] "We spent two days on the Kingsmoot itself, and then two days on the montage. We shot it chronologically, which helped. The water was freezing cold. We shot the drowning many, many times. I remember looking down the shore, after I {{had been there for}} five or six hours, and I saw two smiling faces, in the form of Gemma Whelan and Alfie Allen. They were just smiling their asses off, because they weren't cold! They just had to run to the boat." [...] In regards to stunts, Asbæk continued, [...] "I {{got a little bit of}} help, but not much. I think 95 percent of it was me. I like to do all of it when I can, because <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> feel it with the character." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} written by Lifehouse lead singer Jason Wade and was {{produced}} by American record producer Ron Aniello. When asked about his experience with making songs for No Name Face {{in an interview with}} Billboard, Wade said, [...] "DreamWorks has been amazing in letting us make the record. They're super-artist-friendly. They let us make our record the way we wanted to make it. It's the best label we could be on." [...] In an interview with MTV Radio, Wade explained the message behind [...] "Sick Cycle Carousel" [...] and said, [...] "It's one of those songs I'm really afraid to put an explanation to as far as what it's about for me personally. I don't want it to lose its mystery and mystique. Everyone interprets it differently. It's funny hearing people telling what's it's about to them because <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> go, 'Maybe that's what it's about.' It's got a weird mystique to me still." [...] It was released on March 25, 2002 by DreamWorks Records.|$|E

500|$|Lee {{insisted that}} he was not opposed to Malay special rights or Article 153, saying: [...] "if the {{immigrant}} communities ... do not see the problems, if they can't feel {{what it is like to}} be a poor Malay, and don't feel for him, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> say very soon he will manifest his disaffection in a very decisive way and the whole country will be thrown into turmoil." [...] Few from the Alliance took this claim seriously. UMNO politicians insisted that a [...] "Malaysian Malaysia" [...] implied total equality, entailing the removal of Malay privileges. Senu Abdul Rahman, a federal Minister, felt Lee's advocacy of equality would deny the Malays the possibility of economic participation: [...] "What we want is opportunity, the opportunity to obtain economic wealth for our people." [...] Condemning Lee for stating he was a Malaysian by his own right, Senu asked: [...] "The right which Lee is enjoying today did not fall from the sky or out of the blue. It was given to him. Doesn't he have some feeling of gratitude to the natives of this country?" [...] Lee answered: [...] "No, I am not enjoying anyone's hospitality. I am here as of right. And 61 per cent of the people of Malaysia have to stand by that or it is lost. Without it they would have no future." [...] Some, such as Syed Jaafar Albar, took Senu's stance further and referred to the Malays, as the Bumiputra, as [...] "masters of the house", whose hospitality was being abused by the bangsa asing (aliens) or orang tumpangan (lodgers) such as Lee. This provoked a response from Cabinet member Lim Swee Aun insisting [...] "we are co-owners, not lodgers, not guests." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{village had}} a deep {{emotional}} resonance with the Hmong, who traditionally traded their cash crop of opium there. It reputedly reminded them of a glorious past in which Hmong were literate urbanites. Vang Pao's call for recruits rallied entire Hmong villages to Padong so the eligible males could undergo guerrilla training. A common attitude among the recruits was, [...] "Just once in my life I want to kill a Vietnamese. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> die happy." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Swedish magazine Bon, Robyn announced that she had plans to release three new albums in 2010. She said, [...] "I got all these great songs so why not? [...] It's been 5 years since Robyn and I didn't want to wait with a release until they are all recorded, so I decided to start putting them out right away." [...] Robyn told Popjustice journalist Peter Robinson, [...] "It's {{been a long time}} since I actually made a record! And I was thinking of how to shorten that time down and Eric, my manager, came up with the idea of what if I just start releasing songs, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> tour them, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> make some more songs. We started working like that. I think once it starts it will make more sense– you can just keep releasing stuff without the long breaks." [...] Robyn collaborated with Swedish producer Max Martin on the song [...] "Time Machine". Martin was responsible for producing Robyn's US breakthrough hits [...] "Do You Know (What It Takes)" [...] and [...] "Show Me Love", which both charted inside the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100 in 1996 and 1997. She said of the collaboration: [...] "It was nostalgic to go back into the studio together. For me, it’s perfect timing– I’ve come full circle. It’s a way for me to show that I’m not trying to distance myself from where I come from. It’s still all about the songs." ...|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{their many}} {{disagreements}} Brooke and Churchill held an affection for each other. After one fierce clash Churchill told {{his chief of}} staff and military adviser, Sir Hastings Ismay, that he did not think he could continue to work any longer with Brooke because [...] "he hates me. I can see hatred looking from his eyes." [...] Brooke responded to Ismay: “Hate him? I don't hate him. I love him. But the first time I tell him that I agree with him when I don't will be the time to get rid of me, for <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> be no more use to him." [...] When Churchill was told this he murmured, ”Dear Brookie.” ...|$|E
