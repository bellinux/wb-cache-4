5|$|Mount Pleasant Road was {{constructed}} {{over the course}} of several years by interconnecting several existing streets as well as building a new road in other places; at that time, a road existed to the north and south of the cemetery. <b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south, running between Clarence Street (renamed Heath Street on April 7, 1913) and Moore Avenue, was known as Lyle Street and Kinsman Avenue. <b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north, running between Balliol Street and Merton Street, was known as Alberta Avenue.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} Great Pulteney Street is the Holburne Museum of Art, {{which was}} {{originally}} designed as the Sydney Hotel and was built by Charles Harcourt Masters in 1795–6. It stands on Sydney Place and within the Sydney Pleasure Gardens which stretch from <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Kennet and Avon Canal. Next to the church of St Mary the Virgin is Bathwick Hill which leads up to Claverton Down, including Claverton Manor which {{was built in the}} 1820s and is now home to the American Museum in Britain and the University of Bath.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the morning}} on 8 August the Georgian 4th Brigade from Vaziani Military Base {{advanced}} on the left flank of Tskhinvali; the 3rd Brigade advanced on the right flank. The aim of the flank operations was to advance northward after capturing key positions. The Georgian troops would take the Gupta bridge and <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Roki Tunnel, barring the Russian troops from moving southward.|$|E

5|$|Farthest South was {{the most}} southerly latitudes reached by explorers before the conquest of the South Pole in 1911. Significant steps on <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pole were the {{discovery}} of lands south of Cape Horn in 1619, Captain James Cook's crossing of the Antarctic Circle in 1773, and the earliest confirmed sightings of the Antarctic mainland in 1820. From the late 19th century onward, the quest for Farthest South latitudes became in effect a race to reach the pole, which culminated in Roald Amundsen's success in December 1911.|$|E
5|$|In the Wild Card Round, the sixth-seeded Jets {{beat the}} AFC South {{champion}} and third-seeded Colts 17–16 on January 8, 2011, at the Colts' home field, Lucas Oil Stadium, {{to qualify for}} the Divisional Playoffs. The following week, on January 16, they defeated the AFC East champion and first-seeded Patriots 28–21, ending New England's eight-game winning streak. The victory made the Jets the first team to win back-to-back road playoff games in consecutive seasons, and qualified them to advance to the AFC Championship Game for the second consecutive season, where they lost on <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> AFC North champion Pittsburgh Steelers 24–19.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} years, he was {{assisted}} {{by the man}} who had become his trusted prime-minister, Johan Göransson Gyllenstierna (1635–1680). Some sources say the king was basically dependent on Gyllenstierna,. His sudden death in 1680 opened up <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> monarch, and many men tried to get close to the king to take Gyllenstierna's place.|$|E

5|$|Oregon Caves National Monument and Preserve is open year-round, {{although}} snow sometimes blocks <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> park, and {{the visitor}} center is open when the cave is open for tours. Cave tours are usually offered from mid-April to early November, but the schedule depends in spring and fall on weather conditions. The Illinois Valley Visitor Center in Cave Junction, managed by the IVCDO under an NPS contract, also has information about the cave.|$|E
5|$|Route 57 {{begins at}} an {{interchange}} with US22 in Lopatcong Township, {{where the only}} movements possible here between the two highways are westbound Route 57 to westbound US22 and vice versa. The road heads to the east on the Morris and Essex Turnpike, a two-lane undivided road. The route heads through a mix of businesses and farm fields, with Norfolk Southern's Washington Secondary rail line paralleling <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south.

5|$|The {{southern}} {{portion of}} SR 125 from Otay Mesa Road to SR 54 near Chula Vista is a toll road called the South Bay Expressway. This portion {{was completed in}} 2007 {{after many years of}} planning and litigation related to concerns over the destruction of endangered species habitat. The toll road was operated by a public-private partnership known as South Bay Expressway LLC. However, the partnership declared bankruptcy in 2010 and sold <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) in 2011. Since then, following a decrease in the toll amount, traffic using the highway has increased.|$|E
5|$|The undefeated Buccaneers lost on <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> winless New York Giants. Giants quarterback Phil Simms, in {{his first}} NFL start, went 6–12 for 37 yards.

Doug Williams threw touchdown passes to Larry Mucker and Jimmie Giles, but also threw three interceptions and numerous incompletions.|$|E
5|$|Various owners {{operated}} the road until 1882. Ownership then {{passed to the}} Mount Hood & Barlow Road Company. E. Henry Wemme purchased that company in 1912, and made improvements to the road. Wemme's attorney, George W. Joseph, became the owner upon Wemme's death in 1914, in a probate dispute so contentious that it shaped the 1930 race for Governor of Oregon. Joseph and his wife donated <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> people of Oregon in 1919.|$|E

5|$|Following {{a stroke}} {{at a family}} reunion in Tallahassee, Florida, in September 1989, Roddenberry's health {{declined}} further, ultimately requiring him to use a wheelchair. Following another stroke in early October 1991, his right arm was paralyzed, causing him ongoing pain as the muscles began to atrophy. It also caused problems with the sight in his right eye and he found communicating in full sentences difficult. At 2:00pm, on October 24, he attended an appointment with his doctor, Dr. Ronald Rich. He arrived in the building with his staff, and began to travel up to the ninth floor in the elevator. As they reached the fifth floor, he began struggling for breath, and was wheeled into the doctor's office, where he was reclined and a nurse administered oxygen. Barrett was sent for. Upon her arrival, she held Roddenberry while encouraging him to breathe. He had a cardiopulmonary arrest, and {{he died in the}} doctor's office shortly afterwards. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was attempted with no effect, and paramedics arrived to take him across <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Santa Monica Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead.|$|E
5|$|Having {{left his}} command to General Belliard on 8 March, three days later, Nansouty {{was a part}} of a convoy of several officers, heading to Paris. On <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> capital, they were {{attacked}} by a pulk of Cossacks, which managed to disperse the convoy's escort. Nansouty and his officers fought their way out sabre in hand and made a run for it towards the river Aisne. Reaching the riverbanks, the General got isolated and, as he was preparing to cross the river on horseback, his horse was shot under him, throwing the General to the ground. Nevertheless, he stood up and swam to the other bank of the river and safety. This event, as well as his tireless activity during the campaign, seem to suggest that his health was not the main reason of his departure from the army. It is also unlikely that the Emperor himself decided to replace him, given Belliard's tentative approach at the Battle of Craonne and this General's subsequent provisional status as commander, after Nansouty's departure. It is thus more likely that Nansouty resigned, following his disputes with the Emperor.|$|E
5|$|In the {{southern}} {{half of the}} village, the highway follows a zig-zag routing as it leaves Fayette Street at River Road {{before returning to the}} north at Washington Street one block to the east. While on Washington Street, the route passes over the Cayuga–Seneca Canal and enters the village's center, changing names to Virginia Street in the process. Not far to the north, NY96 heads into Waterloo's central business district, built up around the junction of Virginia and Main (US20 and NY5) Streets. Past Routes5 and20, NY96 continues north as a residential street to the village line, where the route turns to the west with a slight trend to the north. At this point, the scenery surrounding NY96 shifts from house-lined streets to rural countryside once again, an appearance that follows <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northwest through the town of Waterloo and across the county line.|$|E
