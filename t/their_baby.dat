40|$|It {{should come}} as no {{surprise}} that when women who have raised babies in domestic violence come together to discuss the formation of relationships with <b>their</b> <b>babies</b> they raise issues of fear. Yet in current attachment stud-ies about the formation of relationships between women and <b>their</b> <b>babies,</b> knowledge of fear based in lived experiences is undervalued. This article draws on a qualitative study of such experiences to explore ways in which fear impacted on 16 women and <b>their</b> <b>babies.</b> From this study it is discerned that fear impacts in diverse ways on women, <b>babies,</b> and <b>their</b> relationships with each other. Women’s experiences show that fear is a complex emotion that cannot be understood outside of context, relations, and subjectivity. Furthermore, fear can be the motivation for protection, whereby actions by women are in the interests of safety of <b>their</b> <b>babies.</b> These insights look beyond attachment theory to the manifestations of and responses to fear identified by women who have raised babies while enduring domestic violence...|$|R
