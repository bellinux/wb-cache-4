5|$|The poetic {{versions}} of the story allude to additional matter within the tradition of Mac Da Thó's pig, including the names of Mac Da Thó's wife Maine Athrai, of his two sons, and of his grandson Léna. According to these accounts, Léna first found <b>the</b> <b>pig</b> in Slieve Bloom, and was responsible for its nourishment until it had seven inches of fat on its snout. Maine Athrai needed <b>the</b> <b>pig</b> for her husband's great feast; Léna refused, but he was killed when <b>the</b> <b>pig</b> grubbed up earth with its snout, burying him alive in his sleep. In {{this version of the}} tale, which shows how much may have been omitted from the narrow version of the saga, Mac Da Thó's swineherd Follscaide dutifully delivers <b>the</b> <b>pig</b> to his master's feast.|$|E

5|$|Pork steaks are {{generally}} {{cut from the}} shoulder of <b>the</b> <b>pig,</b> but can also be cut from the loin or leg of <b>the</b> <b>pig.</b> Shoulder steaks are cut from the same primal cut of meat most commonly used for pulled pork, and can be quite tough without long cooking times due to the high amount of collagen in the meat; therefore, pork shoulder steaks are often cooked slower than a typical beef steak, and may be stewed or simmered in barbecue sauce during cooking.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{swimming}} <b>pigs</b> {{are surrounded}} {{by a variety of}} local legends.

50|$|Once <b>the</b> {{first two}} <b>pigs</b> join <b>the</b> third <b>pig</b> in his brick house, the wolf again dresses up - {{this time as}} a {{homeless}} woman playing a violin, while it's snowing outside (the 'snow' actually talcum powder held above the wolf's head on a stick). <b>The</b> first two <b>pigs</b> have pity on the wolf, and despite <b>the</b> third <b>pig</b> blocking <b>the</b> door, <b>the</b> two other <b>pigs</b> let <b>the</b> wolf in.

5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} also reduces silica {{which has}} {{to be removed from}} <b>the</b> <b>pig</b> iron. The silica is reacted with calcium oxide (burned limestone) and forms a slag which floats {{to the surface of the}} molten pig iron. The direct contact of flue gas with the iron causes contamination with sulfur if it is present in the fuel. Historically, to prevent contamination from sulfur, the best quality iron was produced with charcoal.|$|E

After arriving in Hong Kong, the bristles would be shipped to Australia by sea.

Harris also dismissed the argument that Krajnc's actions created a safety risk via possible contamination, finding that the driver had delivered <b>the</b> <b>pigs</b> immediately afterwards with {{no mention of the}} incident because he did not think there was a real risk, and that in the past, despite knowing that <b>the</b> <b>pigs</b> had been given water, abattoirs had never refused them.|$|R

5|$|Most {{other mammals}} studied, {{including}} <b>the</b> <b>pig,</b> cow, cat, dog, bushbaby, macaque, chimpanzee and orangutan, {{have a single}} Mup gene. Some, however, have an expanded number: horses have three Mup genes and gray mouse lemurs have at least two. Insects, fish, amphibia, birds and marsupials appear to have disrupted synteny at the chromosomal position of the Mup gene cluster, suggesting the gene family may be specific to placental mammals. Humans are the only placental mammals found {{not to have any}} active Mup genes; instead they have a single Mup pseudogene containing a mutation that causes missplicing, rendering it dysfunctional.|$|E
