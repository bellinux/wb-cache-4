5|$|By 1931, many Duval County {{residents}} were warming <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> merging municipal and county governments to reduce bureaucracy, corruption and weak management. As a result, in 1932, citizens of both cities {{voted for the}} annexation of South Jacksonville into Jacksonville. While full city-county consolidation was voted down, {{the efforts of the}} 1930s set the stage for further attempts, ultimately resulting in the 1968 Jacksonville Consolidation.|$|E
5|$|Following in {{the path}} paved by {{linguist}} Noam Chomsky, Fodor developed a strong commitment <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> psychological nativism. Nativism postulates the innateness of many cognitive functions and concepts. For Fodor, this position emerges naturally out of his criticism of behaviourism and associationism. These criticisms also {{led him to the}} formulation of his hypothesis of the modularity of the mind.|$|E
5|$|He {{assumed the}} worst in people and he brought out {{the worst in}} them... He clung <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> being 'tough'. He thought that was what had {{brought him to the}} edge of greatness. But that was what betrayed him. He could not open himself to other men and he could not open himself to greatness.|$|E
50|$|In 1615, Vincenzo Scamozzi {{published}} the late Renaissance treatise L'Idea dell'Architettura Universale (<b>The</b> <b>Idea</b> <b>of</b> a Universal Architecture). He attempted <b>to</b> relate <b>the</b> design {{of cities and}} buildings <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> Vitruvius and <b>the</b> Pythagoreans, and <b>to</b> <b>the</b> more recent <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> Palladio.|$|R

5|$|He {{perceived}} {{books as}} permanent objects that were invested with power. This power was {{unique in that}} it could transmit ideas to people of different times, cultures, and interests, and do so in ways other art forms could not. This ambition laced all of his work, particularly in his later years. Lissitzky was devoted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> creating art with power and purpose, art that could invoke change.|$|E
5|$|Mugabe {{was opposed}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> a ceasefire, but under {{pressure}} from Machel he agreed to it. Mugabe signed the agreement, although felt cheated, remaining disappointed {{that he had never}} achieved a military victory over the Rhodesian forces.|$|E
5|$|The {{birth of}} the yellow, green, and red tricolor {{occurred}} during a drive by other European republics to change their flags. One example that gave life <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> the tricolor was the French blue, white and red flag adopted after the French Revolution. The only tricolor that existed for Lithuania before the yellow, green and red flag was a green, white and red flag used to represent Lithuania Minor.|$|E

5|$|After {{these talks}} with Rudd, Lobengula called an indaba (conference) of over 100 izinDuna {{to present the}} {{proposed}} concession terms to them and gauge their sympathies. It {{soon became clear that}} opinion was split: most of the younger izinDuna were opposed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> any concession whatsoever, while the king himself and many of his older izinDuna were open to considering Rudd's bid. The idea of a mining monopoly in the hands of Rudd's powerful backers was attractive to the Matabele in some ways, as it would end the incessant propositioning for concessions by small-time prospectors, {{but there was also a}} case for allowing competition to continue, so that the rival miners would have to compete for Lobengula's favour.|$|E
5|$|Alice again laid {{claim to}} the regency. However, most Antiochene lords {{remained}} hostile <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> a female ruler and sent envoys to BaldwinII's successor, Fulk of Anjou, who was Alice's brother-in-law. Alice made an alliance with Joscelin II, Count of Edessa, and Pons, Count of Tripoli, in early 1132. Fulk had to travel to Antioch by sea, because Pons did not allow him to march through the County of Tripoli. Fulk landed at St. Symeon where the Antiochene barons acknowledged him as regent. He appointed Reynald I Mazoir, Constable of Antioch, to administer the principality.|$|E
5|$|Behind the scenes, Welensky and the Rhodesians {{had been}} courting the Conservatives, while the native Africans {{had been doing}} the same with Labour. A British general {{election}} was held in 1951 and the Conservatives gained power. Labour, mindful of the overwhelming opposition of Africans from both Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland and of the Colonial Office mandate to oversee native interests, had been lukewarm at best <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> federation, and had been wholly opposed to amalgamation. After the election, the bipartisan approach to federation broke down and the British laws for its creation passed only {{with the support of}} the Conservatives, with both Liberal and Labour Parties now opposed.|$|E

50|$|Deulofeu's {{thoughts}} are related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> Oswald Spengler and Arnold J. Toynbee, who also theoried on the cyclical character of civilizations, {{but not in}} the same precise mathematical way as Deulofeu.|$|R
5|$|By late October, the German {{forces were}} worn out, {{with only a}} third of their motor {{vehicles}} still functioning, infantry divisions at third- to half-strength, and serious logistics issues preventing the delivery of warm clothing and other winter equipment to the front. Even Hitler seemed to surrender <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> a long struggle, since the prospect of sending tanks into such a large city without heavy infantry support seemed risky after the costly capture of Warsaw in 1939.|$|E
5|$|Construction began before {{completion}} of the design for the gaseous diffusion process. Due to {{the large amount of}} electric power that the K-25 plant was expected to consume, it was decided to provide it with its own electric power plant. While the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) believed that it could supply the Clinton Engineer Works' needs, there was unease about relying on a single supplier when a power failure could cost the gaseous diffusion plant weeks of work, and the lines to TVA could be sabotaged. A local plant was more secure. The Kellex engineers were also attracted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> being able to generate the variable frequency current required by the gaseous diffusion process without complicated transformers.|$|E
5|$|During {{his student}} years in England, Jinnah was {{influenced}} by 19th-century British liberalism, like many other future Indian independence leaders. This political education included exposure <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> the democratic nation, and progressive politics. He became an admirer of the Parsi British Indian political leaders Dadabhai Naoroji and Sir Pherozeshah Mehta. Naoroji had become the first British Member of Parliament of Indian extraction shortly before Jinnah's arrival, triumphing with a majority of three votes in Finsbury Central. Jinnah listened to Naoroji's maiden speech in the House of Commons from the visitor's gallery.|$|E

50|$|Johnstone {{travelled}} to Paris in his youth, {{which opened}} him <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> modernism. He also spent {{a large amount}} of time in the US, where he became interested in Indian cave paintings for their deemed naïve simplicity.|$|R
5|$|In the 1960s, the Soviet Union {{originated}} Project 1144 Orlan, {{a project}} intended {{to design and}} build a large, nuclear powered anti-submarine vessel. At the time, the Soviets did not envisage that arming surface ships with anti-ship missiles was required, as then current doctrine had it that submarines were the main platform for attacking enemy shipping. However, {{the sinking of the}} Israeli destroyer INS Eilat in 1967 by anti-ship missiles fired from an Egyptian missile boat led to a re-think of the use of surface ships in the role. The threat of US Navy surface ships, which were increasingly capable of a range of different missions, led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> a single ship combining anti-aircraft, anti-ship and anti-submarine capabilities crystalising.|$|E
5|$|Jan Henryk Dąbrowski, {{a former}} {{high-ranking}} {{officer in the}} army of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, began his work in 1796– a year after the total destruction of the Commonwealth. At that time he went to Paris, and later, Milan, where his idea received support from Napoleon Bonaparte, who saw the Poles as a promising source of new recruits, and who superficially appeared receptive <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> liberating Poland. Dąbrowski was soon authorized by the French-allied Cisalpine Republic to create the Polish Legions, which would be part of {{the army of the}} newly created Republic of Lombardy. This agreement, drafted by Napoleon, was signed on 9 January 1797, and marked the formal creation of the Legions.|$|E
5|$|Justice Stevens wrote a brief {{dissenting opinion}} {{arguing that the}} case should have been {{dismissed}} because the Illinois legislature has largely reduced penalties for marijuana possession, which made it ridiculous for the officers to rush to get a warrant. He said {{that even if he}} reached the merits of the question, he would affirm and hold the search unconstitutional because the majority misapplied a balancing of “privacy-related and law enforcement-related concerns". He wanted to give broader protection <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> the home as a place for protection, even if the home in this case was a trailer.|$|E

50|$|Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and in particular, Through the Looking-Glass, {{were used}} as direct inspirations due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> dream reversal, occultism, and dream {{symbolism}} that Carroll presents in his work and that author Marc Edmund Jones elaborates on.|$|R

5|$|Karim {{said the}} {{inspiration}} for YouTube first came from Janet Jackson's role in the 2004 Super Bowl incident, when her breast was exposed during her performance, and later from the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. Karim could not easily find video clips of either event online, which led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> a video sharing site. Hurley and Chen said that the original idea for YouTube was a video version of an online dating service, and had {{been influenced by the}} website Hot or Not.|$|E
5|$|On 28 September 2016, Hasselbaink {{was named}} and shown in The Daily Telegraphs sting {{operation}} involving the exposation of football management personalities engaging in improper conduct. Hasselbaink negotiated {{a deal to}} work with a fictitious Far Eastern firm looking to become involved in the transfer of footballers. Additionally, Hasselbaink, despite the conflict of interest, was open <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> signing players represented by the firm. Queens Park Rangers launched an internal investigation and went on to release a statement fully backing Hasselbaink and stated that The Daily Telegraph failed to provide sufficient evidence regarding their sting operation.|$|E
5|$|On 9 January 2011, Bristol East MP Kerry McCarthy {{gave her}} support <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> a public DNA {{screening}} process {{if the police}} found it useful. The Avon and Somerset Constabulary had conducted mass DNA screening during the 1995 investigation into the disappearance of Louise Smith. McCarthy suggested that the screening process should be extended beyond Clifton to the wider Bristol area. DNA that had been found on Yeates' body was tested for a potential profile. Detectives also began tracking the movements of several hundred registered sex offenders living within their jurisdiction to determine the individuals' whereabouts on 17 December.|$|E
