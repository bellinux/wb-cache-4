5|$|After the Berlin Wall {{was built}} in 1961, Zoologischer Garten became the West Berlin and Ostbahnhof the East Berlin de facto central station. The station Friedrichstraße now was the {{terminal}} point of the separated West and East Berlin S-Bahn lines and departure point for the Interzonenzug (Inter-zone train) services between West Berlin and West Germany. Friedrichstraße station was separated into Eastern and Western parts with steel walls, and enabled West Berliners <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>to</b> S-Bahn trains running on the Nord-Süd-Bahn and the U6 line of the Berlin U-Bahn without passing through GDR border controls. The station also featured a border crossing into East Berlin.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 12, Achebe {{moved away}} from his family {{to the village of}} Nekede, four {{kilometres}} from Owerri. He enrolled as a student at the Central School, where his older brother John taught. In Nekede, Achebe gained an appreciation for Mbari, a traditional art form that seeks to invoke the gods' protection through symbolic sacrifices in the form of sculpture and collage. (He would later suggest the name for the Mbari Writers and Artists Club that was founded in Ibadan by Ulli Beier and others in 1961.) When the time came <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>to</b> secondary school, in 1944, Achebe sat entrance examinations for and was accepted at both the prestigious Dennis Memorial Grammar School in Onitsha and the even more prestigious Government College in Umuahia.|$|E

5|$|During the 19th century, a {{significant}} part of the world's production of cobalt blue (a dye made with cobalt compounds and alumina) and smalt (cobalt glass powdered for use for pigment purposes in ceramics and painting) was carried out at the Norwegian Blaafarveværket. The first mines for the production of smalt in the 16th century were located in Norway, Sweden, Saxony and Hungary. With the discovery of cobalt ore in New Caledonia in 1864, the mining of cobalt in Europe declined. With the discovery of ore deposits in Ontario, Canada in 1904 and the discovery of even larger deposits in the Katanga Province in the Congo in 1914, the mining operations shifted again. When the Shaba conflict started in 1978, the copper mines of Katanga Province nearly stopped production. The impact on the world cobalt economy from this conflict was smaller than expected: cobalt is a rare metal, the pigment is highly toxic, and the industry had already established effective ways for recycling cobalt materials. In some cases, industry was able <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>to</b> cobalt-free alternatives.|$|E
5|$|Maroon: The university's {{official}} color {{used to be}} magenta, {{one which}} was shared by Harvard University. Since it was confusing for the two schools to be wearing the same color during athletic competitions, the matter of which school could lay claim to magenta was to be settled {{through a series of}} baseball games. Fordham won the games, but Harvard reneged on its promise. Both schools continued to use the color until 1874, when the Fordham student government unanimously agreed <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>to</b> maroon. Maroon was chosen because it was not widely used at the time. Sometime later, Harvard stopped using magenta in favor of crimson.|$|E
5|$|The LSWR M7 {{class is}} {{a class of}} 0-4-4 {{passenger}} tank locomotive built between 1897 and 1911. The class was designed by Dugald Drummond for use on the intensive London network of the London and South Western Railway (LSWR), and performed well in such tasks. Because of their utility, 105 were built and the class went through several modifications over five production batches. For this reason there were detail variations such as frame length. Many of the class were fitted with push-pull operation gear that enabled efficient use on branch line duties without the need <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>to</b> {{the other end of}} its train {{at the end of a}} journey.|$|E

5|$|The filmmakers {{knew from}} the {{beginning}} of production that the whales were their biggest effects concern; Dow recalled that they were prepared <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>to</b> another animal in case creating the whales proved too difficult. When Humphrey the Whale wandered into the San Francisco Bay, Dow and his camera crew attempted to gather usable footage of the humpback but failed to do so. Other footage of real humpbacks either did not exist on 35mm film or would have been difficult to match to specific actions required by the script. Compositing miniatures shot against bluescreen on top of water backgrounds would not have provided realistic play of light. Creating full-size mechanical whales on tracks would severely limit the types of angles and shots. To solve the whale problem, Rodis hired robotics expert Walt Conti. While Conti was not experienced in film, Rodis believed his background in engineering and design made him well-equipped for Rodis' planned solution: the creation of independent and self-contained miniature whale models.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the game}} {{involved}} two Canadian teams, the NHL {{hoped that the}} event would prove a successful draw in the U.S. To that end, the league scheduled the Heritage Classic as {{the only game in}} prime time, while NBC debuted its Hockey Day in America with a pair of regional doubleheaders that led into the telecast; throughout NBC's telecast, commercials advised viewers <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>to</b> Versus for the Heritage Classic once the American games finished. University of Alberta sports economist Brad Humphreys questioned the league's ambitions, arguing that a game without an American team would not appeal. He stated that the game was being held to placate the Canadian audience, but noted that it was important for the NHL to keep the league's Canadian audience happy.|$|E
5|$|Bottas, Ricciardo, Magnussen and Räikkönen made pit stops <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>to</b> {{intermediate}} tyres on lap 12. After {{his early}} pit stop, Button {{moved up to}} eighth place on the lap. Massa and Vettel made their pit stops the following lap, with Vettel moving in front of Massa and rejoining ahead of teammate Ricciardo. Rosberg made his pit stop on the 14th lap and rejoined in second position, 22 seconds behind Hamilton (who recorded fast sector times {{in an attempt to}} move ahead of Rosberg after the latter's pit stop). Hamilton went off the track at the Spoon Curve, rejoining the race at the run-off area. The mistake reduced the time deficit by one second. Rosberg reclaimed first position when Hamilton approached the exit of the pit lane after the latter's stop. He reported that his car was oversteering, and Button held a 6.5-second advantage over both Williams cars. The Red Bull cars reduced the gap to Massa in sixth by lap 16, and began a challenge for the position. Vettel moved to the inside lane and passed Massa with a narrow margin at the hairpin on the lap. Although Ricciardo attempted a similar manoeuvre on the outside at the Spoon Curve, Massa accelerated clear heading into 130R corner.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the first}} week of release, the PS3 version of A Realm Reborn placed second in Japan's sales charts, with 184,000 {{physical}} copies sold. In late October 2013, Square Enix announced that the game had one and a half million registrations. It was the 16th best selling personal computer game of 2013 in the United States. In Japan, the PlayStation 3 version was ranked 32 in sales, with 244,574 retail copies sold. Following an extremely poor fiscal year 2013, Square Enix executives commended the game's sales and subscriptions for its role in returning the company to profitability in 2014. As of July 2016, the game had over 6 million cumulative players, a figure which excludes free trial members. Yoshida has repeatedly emphasized that the robust success of A Realm Reborn was due to its traditional monthly subscription model. He sees the free-to-play model as an unreliable source of income predicated on devoting a lot of development resources to monthly consumable or cosmetic items in order to maintain profitability, leaving little time left for higher quality story and battle content. He also disclosed that over 80% of players are satisfied with the subscription model and theorized that this is due to players' confidence in a steady stream of quality content because of their subscription. With the traditional model, the player base grows over time as people see the game expand, unlike a free-to-play game which can boast a huge initial player base which changes dramatically in size and revenue from month to month. Yoshida has no plans <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>to</b> a free-to-play model in the near future.|$|E
5|$|Even {{after the}} {{election}} of Abraham Lincoln as president in 1860, Crittenden rejected the idea that secession was inevitable and continued {{to work for the}} preservation of the Union. He believed that the current sectional crisis could—like all past disagreements in U.S. history—be resolved through compromise. However, he believed that this compromise must not be a simple legislative action, which could be altered or even repealed by a successive Congress, but amendments to the U.S. Constitution, which would be much more difficult <b>to</b> <b>change.</b> <b>To</b> that end, he proposed the Crittenden Compromise—a package of six constitutional amendments and four congressional resolutions—in December 1860. Among the resolutions were a condemnation of Northern personal liberty laws and an assertion of the constitutionality of the fugitive slave law. The amendments would have restored the Missouri Compromise line and extended it to California as a line of demarcation between slave and free territories. Crittenden's other amendments would have further guaranteed that slavery would remain legal indefinitely in Washington, D.C., so long as it was legal in either Maryland or Virginia and that slaveholders would be reimbursed for runaway slaves. Also, the amendments denied Congress any power to interfere with the interstate slave trade or with slavery in the existing Southern states and made the fugitive slave law and Three-Fifths Compromise perpetual in duration.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Abzû {{lay in the}} {{development}} of Journey, an independent video game developed by Thatgamecompany and released in 2012. Abzûs creator, director and art director Matt Nava had previously worked as art director for Journey during its three-year development. Having worked in a game featuring a desert setting, Nava wanted <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>to</b> a more vibrant and populated setting for his next title. Nava began creating the pitch for Abzû before leaving Thatgamecompany and founding the game's developer Giant Squid Studios. One of the main elements Nava incorporated was his love for ancient cultures and their artwork, particularly relating to the myths surrounding the concept of Abzu. Nava's love of the ocean, which he explored through his hobby of scuba diving, also figured heavily in the design of Abzû. The team at Giant Squid Studios grew to ten developers from across the industry, mainly programmers who specialized in multiple aspects of game design from gameplay to graphics, in addition to a graphical and technical artist who helped create and animate the character models. The game was first announced at the 2014 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3). It was later previewed at E3 2016. The game was released digitally on PlayStation 4 via PlayStation Network and Microsoft Windows through Steam on August 2, 2016. It released on Xbox One through Xbox Live on December 6. The game received a physical release for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on January 31, 2017. All versions were published by 505 Games.|$|E

5|$|Torrential rain {{prevented}} {{the resumption of}} the Grand Prix for over two hours, until the rain eased at 15:50 local time. The race was restarted behind the safety car with the drivers in the positions held before the suspension. Vettel was first, followed by Kobayashi, Massa, Heidfeld, Petrov and di Resta. Webber was in seventh place with Alonso, de la Rosa and Button behind. The safety car remained out for seven laps, during which the circuit began drying enough to be suitable for intermediate tyres, and D'Ambrosio pitted on lap 33 to change from the full wets. Vettel began to extend the lead over Kobayashi once the safety car came in on lap 35, as Massa and Heidfeld fought for Kobayashi's second place. Schumacher led several cars into the pitlane <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>to</b> intermediate tyres, while Button, Heidfeld and di Resta were among those who pitted the next lap. Vettel and Karthikeyan were the only drivers not to change tyres by lap 37, when Button came upon tenth placed Alonso as he exited the pitlane. As Button attempted to pass at turn 3 the two cars touched, and Alonso's Ferrari spun and beached upon a curb, bringing out the safety car. When the race resumed three laps later, Vettel, Kobayashi and Massa retained their positions, as Heidfeld, di Resta, Webber and Schumacher fought for fourth place. Button had a punctured tyre after the collision and was in twenty-first and last place, but immediately began to make up positions and was 14th by lap 44. Di Resta damaged his front wing attempting to overtake Heidfeld; the subsequent pit-stop and drive-through penalty dropped him down to last. Schumacher, having overtaken Webber, passed Heidfeld in fourth place, and set the fastest lap of the race.|$|E
5|$|With rain {{shortly before}} the race, the start was taken behind the safety car, forcing all drivers to start the race on the full wet tyres. As Ricciardo led the field behind the safety car, Daniil Kvyat had {{to come into the}} pit lane on lap two, {{complaining}} of technical issues. He rejoined with a new steering wheel, being a lap down {{on the rest of the}} pack already. The race started in earnest on lap seven, with Ricciardo defending his lead at the restart. Kevin Magnussen made a pit stop for intermediate tyres at the end of the lap, but his teammate Jolyon Palmer proved just how slippery it still was when he crashed out just a lap later, being caught out by a wet zebra crossing and causing a virtual safety car period. More cars came into the pitlane for intermediate tyres over the following laps. On lap twelve, Kimi Räikkönen damaged his front wing on the guardrail at the Loews hairpin, resulting in his front wing getting caught under his front tyres, blocking Grosjean's way in the process. Räikkönen retired some corners later. Meanwhile, Ricciardo built a gap at the front, being ten seconds clear of Rosberg on lap 13. One lap later, Sebastian Vettel was the first of the front runners <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>to</b> intermediate tyres. Mercedes issued team orders demanding Rosberg let Hamilton past on lap 16, but the gap had by then grown to 13 seconds.|$|E
