2500|$|Bridle; a Western bridle {{usually has}} a curb bit and long split reins {{to control the}} horse in many {{different}} situations. Generally the bridle is open-faced, without a noseband, unless the horse is ridden with a <b>tiedown.</b> Young ranch horses learning basic tasks usually are ridden in a jointed, loose-ring snaffle bit, often with a running martingale. In some areas, especially where the [...] "California" [...] style of the vaquero or buckaroo tradition is still strong, young horses are often seen in a bosal style hackamore.|$|E
50|$|A {{relatively}} strong noseband, {{often on}} its own headstall, may be worn {{for the purpose of}} supporting a standing martingale or <b>tiedown.</b> It is generally adjusted to lie just below the cheekbones, but is adjusted loosely or may not be adjustable. It does not keep the horse's mouth shut, it only supports the <b>tiedown.</b>|$|E

50|$|A {{variation}} of the standing martingale, called a <b>tiedown,</b> is seen almost exclusively in the western riding disciplines. A <b>tiedown</b> is adjusted much shorter than a standing martingale and is intended primarily to prevent the horse from flipping its head up when asked to abruptly stop or turn in speed events. Users also claim that it gives the horse something to brace against for balance. It consists of an adjustable strap, one end which attaches to the horse's breastplate and the other which attaches to a noseband on the bridle. The noseband can be of leather, but may also be of lariat rope, or even plastic-covered cable, which can make the western <b>tiedown</b> considerably harsher than the English-style standing martingale. It is properly adjusted when it puts no pressure on the horse's nose when held at a normal position, but will immediately act if the horse raises its nose {{more than a few}} inches.|$|E

5000|$|The {{most common}} Passive {{trackers}} use a low boiling point compressed gas fluid that is driven {{to one side}} or the other (by solar heat creating gas pressure) to cause the tracker to move in response to an imbalance. As this is a non-precision orientation it is unsuitable for certain types of concentrating photovoltaic collectors but works fine for common PV panel types. These will have viscous dampers to prevent excessive motion in response to wind gusts. Shader/reflectors are used to reflect early morning sunlight to [...] "wake up" [...] the panel and tilt it toward the Sun, which can take nearly an hour. The time to do this can be greatly reduced by adding a self-releasing <b>tiedown</b> that positions the panel slightly past the zenith (so that the fluid does not have to overcome gravity) and using the <b>tiedown</b> in the evening. (A slack-pulling spring will prevent release in windy overnight conditions.) ...|$|E

40|$|Wheelchair {{transportation}} safety research has primarily addressed frontal impact consequences. This {{study is a}} first, examining effects of headrest use on pediatric injury measures under rear impact conditions. Two sets of three identical WC 19 transit-option manual pediatric wheelchairs were tested: three sled tests were conducted without a headrest and three with a headrest. All tests used a 26 km/h, 10 g rear impact test pulse, seated Hybrid III 6 -year old anthropomorphic test device (ATD), and 4 -point strap-type surrogate wheelchair <b>tiedowns</b> and 3 -point occupant restraints (WTORS). Results suggest a lower risk of head and neck injury with wheelchair headrest use...|$|R
