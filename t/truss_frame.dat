40|$|This paper {{presents}} a graphical {{method of analysis}} for preliminary design of horizontally loaded tall buildings which are laterally supported by vertical <b>trussed</b> <b>frames</b> and horizontal off-set riggers which {{are located in the}} exterior or facade skeletal frame structures {{in the direction of the}} lateral loading. The interaction between the <b>trussed</b> <b>frames</b> and these facade riggers is through the two floor structures adjacent to the top and bottom cords of the riggers. The method of analysis requires the calculation of seven planar stiffness parameters: bending and shear stiffness of the vertical <b>trussed</b> <b>frames,</b> the horizontal off-set riggers and the floor structures in addition to the bending stiffness of the exterior skeletal frame structures which support the riggers. The method allows a graphical procedure for obtaining the optimum level of the facade riggers in addition to a rapid assessment of the influence of the floor structures and facade riggers on the performance of the high-rise structure such as the reduction in lateral deflection at the top and the overturning moment at the base of the <b>trussed</b> <b>frames...</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Butterfly House {{is one of}} the {{earliest}} examples in Australia to use prefabricated structural steel in a domestic building. The structural core consists of two triangulated <b>truss</b> <b>frames,</b> bolted to large concrete footings at the inverted tip of the triangles. Steel ‘C’ section purlins and steel cross bracing form the base of the first floor, tying the triangulated <b>truss</b> <b>frames</b> together. The two dominant floor beams overlap the first floor truss supporting a series of timber floor joists that are cantilevered at each end forming the balcony and a portion of the living space floor. The ‘Butterfly’ roof is supported by a series of timber joists in a specific geometric configuration.|$|R
40|$|Staggered <b>truss</b> <b>framing</b> {{systems have}} been gaining {{popularity}} for use in structural engineering because they provide large, column-free openings and rapid construction. However, their performance during seismic events has not been fully investigated. The failure of the shear connection between the floor system {{and the top of}} the truss may cause building failure and is essential {{to the understanding of the}} behavior of staggered trusses during an earthquake. The shear connection will be tested by simulating a seismic event. The strong wall/floor at Valparaiso University will be utilized to test a scale model of the shear connection until failure. The results will be analyzed to create a standard seismic design guide for staggered <b>truss</b> <b>frames.</b> A 3 D interactive environment will also be produced from the test data to virtually recreate the tests for educational purposes...|$|R
