5|$|The {{cause of}} his death has been debated. Napoleon's physician, François Carlo Antommarchi, led <b>the</b> <b>autopsy,</b> which found {{the cause of death}} to be stomach cancer. Antommarchi did not sign the {{official}} report. Napoleon's father had died of stomach cancer, although this was seemingly unknown at the time of <b>the</b> <b>autopsy.</b> Antommarchi found evidence of a stomach ulcer; this was the most convenient explanation for the British, who wanted to avoid criticism over their care of Napoleon.|$|E

5|$|As MalcolmX and his bodyguards {{tried to}} quell the disturbance, a man rushed forward and shot him once in the chest with a sawed-off shotgun and two other men charged the stage firing {{semi-automatic}} handguns. MalcolmX was pronounced dead at 3:30pm, shortly after arriving at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital. <b>The</b> <b>autopsy</b> identified 21 gunshot wounds to the chest, left shoulder, arms and legs, including ten buckshot wounds from the initial shotgun blast.|$|E
5|$|During his {{military}} career he had blood vomits, such as before the Battle of Salta; {{he was almost}} too ill {{to participate in the}} battle. It is thought that those vomits originated in the digestive system and were caused by stress, and not in the respiratory system, because the vomits were sporadic, the condition did not become chronic, and it eventually cured itself. Nothing was revealed in <b>the</b> <b>autopsy.</b>|$|E

Einstein's remains were cremated and his ashes were scattered at an undisclosed location.|$|E
5|$|On March 4, <b>the</b> <b>autopsy</b> {{indicated}} Barker {{had nothing}} in her system since some chocolate milk {{the morning of}} her disappearance, and had not eaten since she vanished. There was no indication of foul play; no signs of violence or sexual molestation. It was found she must {{have lived in the}} closet for three days without food or drink. An inspection of the closet showed marks from her attempt to escape.|$|E
5|$|That night, Mulder {{talks to}} Dana Scully, {{telling her that}} he's {{thinking}} of leaving the FBI. He shoots down Scully's idea that he request a transfer to Quantico, believing the FBI doesn't want them working together.

5000|$|The Act of Seeing with One's Own Eyes is a 1971 American {{experimental}} film by Stan Brakhage.

50|$|Several researchers, {{including}} Karl Pflock, investigated Dennis’s {{claims and}} found a number of inconsistencies, including {{the identity of a}} nurse who Dennis claimed was a witness to <b>the</b> alleged alien <b>autopsies</b> and <b>the</b> need for Dennis's own involvement in any embalming process when qualified pathologists were said to have performed <b>the</b> <b>autopsies.</b> Pflock also questioned the validity of sketches of aliens provided by Dennis.|$|R
5|$|During <b>the</b> <b>autopsy,</b> Peter {{explains}} to Sheriff Mathis (Martha Plimpton) how removing {{a part of}} a brain could provide information to the killers. Mathis' partner, deputy officer Bill Ferguson (Patrick Gilmore), soon disappears. After they go to the scene of Krista's murder, Peter encounters Newton, but he escapes. Peter becomes suspicious of Mathis when he sees blood on her jacket; however, he believes her when she shows him her cut from a fall, which is bleeding normal blood, not the mercury typical of shapeshifters; he then explains the concept of shapeshifters to her.|$|E
5|$|Frank was autopsied twice, {{the second}} time to recover debris {{embedded}} in his body. <b>The</b> <b>autopsy</b> revealed that his lower extremities had been ripped off; his muscle tissue was extensively mutilated and torn; small pieces of wire, brass, and miscellaneous articles including a hat ornament were imbedded in various limbs; {{the fingers of his}} right hand were fractured and the bones splintered; and the distal phalanx of each finger on his left hand were missing. The coroner also observed numerous patches of blackened areas, similar to close-range gunshot residue. Four human finger bones were discovered among the wreckage at the primary crash site.|$|E
5|$|In 1865, Cancellor's {{death was}} used in a medical journal article {{discussing}} adult hydrocephalus. Despite Willis' statement that Cancellor had no pre-existing medical condition that would have caused or contributed to his death, author Samuel Wilks suggested not only that Cancellor had hydrocephalus, {{but that he was}} consequently more susceptible to physical injury as a result. He pointed to <b>the</b> <b>autopsy</b> finding of fluid in Cancellor's brain to support his assertions and argued that this effusion would have caused physical weakness.|$|E

2500|$|Another author, Todd Tucker, {{studied the}} {{incident}} and {{published a book}} detailing the historical aspects of nuclear reactor programs of the U.S. military branches. Tucker used the Freedom of Information Act to obtain reports, including <b>autopsies</b> of <b>the</b> victims, writing in detail how each person died and how parts of their bodies were severed, analyzed, and buried as radioactive waste. <b>The</b> <b>autopsies</b> were performed by the same pathologist known for his work following the Cecil Kelley criticality accident. Tucker explains the reasoning behind <b>the</b> <b>autopsies</b> and <b>the</b> severing of victims' body parts, one of which gave off 1,500 R/hour on contact. Because the SL-1 accident killed {{all three of the}} military operators on site, Tucker calls it [...] "the deadliest nuclear reactor incident in U.S. history." ...|$|R
50|$|In June 2005, the Chief Coroner of Ontario {{ordered a}} review of 44 autopsies carried out by Smith. Thirteen of these cases had {{resulted}} in criminal charges and convictions.

5|$|In January 2014, Knut's full autopsy {{results were}} {{published}} by the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research in the Journal of Comparative Pathology. It was the most in-depth post-mortem ever carried out on an animal. <b>The</b> <b>autopsy</b> revealed that {{the damage to the}} bear’s brain was so severe that even if he had not fallen into the water and drowned he would have died anyway. Experts hypothesized that he was suffering from a virus that caused the encephalitis.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to {{the damage done by}} the bullet, <b>the</b> <b>autopsy</b> also found that the President was suffering from cardiomyopathy (fatty degeneration of the heart muscle). This would have weakened his heart and made him less able to recover from such an injury, and was thought to be related to his overweight frame and lack of exercise. Modern scholars generally believe that McKinley died of pancreatic necrosis, a condition that is difficult to treat today and would have been completely impossible for the doctors of his time.|$|E
5|$|Kaminsky {{stands up}} Incanto while he waits at a restaurant. He leaves, murdering a {{slightly}} overweight prostitute who injures {{him in a}} struggle. Incanto is forced to flee before he can fully dissolve the body. At <b>the</b> <b>autopsy,</b> Scully finds that the body's airways are choked with the same substance that dissolved Lauren. The State Genetic Lab report reveals that the skin under the victim's nails contains no oils or fatty acids, convincing Mulder that the killer is sucking body fat from his victims.|$|E

5|$|Smith {{had trouble}} with alcohol and other drugs {{throughout}} his life, while suffering from depression, and these topics often appear in his lyrics. In 2003, aged 34, he died in Los Angeles, California, from two stab wounds to the chest. <b>The</b> <b>autopsy</b> evidence was inconclusive {{as to whether the}} wounds were self-inflicted. At the time of his death, Smith was working on his sixth studio album, From a Basement on the Hill, which was posthumously completed and released in 2004.|$|E
5|$|The corpse rotted quickly; the {{surgeons}} {{of the hospital}} refused to dissect it. Tessier, however, {{wanted to find out}} how Tarrare differed from the norm internally, and was also curious as to whether the gold fork was actually lodged inside him. At <b>the</b> <b>autopsy,</b> Tarrare's gullet was found to be abnormally wide and when his jaws were opened, surgeons could see down a broad canal into the stomach. His body was found to be filled with pus, his liver and gallbladder were abnormally large, and his stomach was enormous, covered in ulcers and filling most of his abdominal cavity.|$|E
5|$|Three {{months after}} Mulder's funeral, Doggett is offered a {{transfer}} from the X-Files. He realizes {{that if he}} leaves, the office will be closed, as Scully will soon be on maternity leave. Meanwhile, a fishing trawler finds the decomposing body of Billy Miles (Zachary Ansley)—an alien abductee who was taken {{at the same time}} as Mulder. When Miles revives on <b>the</b> <b>autopsy</b> table, Skinner, despite Doggett's objections, orders that Mulder's body be exhumed and brought to a hospital, fearing that he may have been buried alive. When the casket is opened, a decomposing Mulder, contrary to all scientific expectations, shows weak vital signs.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>autopsy's</b> {{preliminary}} report failed {{to identify a}} cause of death.
