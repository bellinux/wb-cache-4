25|$|On most feeds of BBC World News, {{when there}} are no {{commercials}} being inserted by the cable or satellite provider similar to other channels, the break filler shows promotions for upcoming programmes on the channel. During BBC News, a news story that has not been promoted airs during what would be <b>the</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>break.</b> This is the case on the broadband versions of BBC World News, and on versions of BBC World News aired in the United States on Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) stations. However, there are some global commercials and sponsorships which air throughout the network.|$|E

500|$|The Trivection oven’s {{inclusion}} in 30 Rock was {{widely seen as}} an example of product placement, especially as the product was later advertised during <b>the</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>break.</b> However, Tina Fey, the show’s creator and writer of the episode, stated the oven was actually included in the show purely as a joke and that GE {{had nothing to do with}} it, although she suspects that [...] "maybe somebody's taking credit for it." [...] Allison Eckelkamp, a spokesperson for GE, confirmed this and says that GE chose to run ads for the oven during <b>the</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>break</b> to make sure viewers knew it was a real product, rather than one invented by the screenwriters for the purposes of the joke.|$|E

During the commercial breaks in this episode, commercials for American Express were aired featuring 30 Rock cast members, {{who were in}} character. These commercials featured Kenneth giving out [...] "Secret Rodney" [...] Christmas gifts to various other 30 Rock characters.

500|$|... "Box Cutter" [...] {{was first}} {{publicly}} shown on June28,2011, at the Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood. During the scene when Gus killed Victor, Bryan Cranston's daughter Taylor fainted {{in her seat}} inside the theater {{at the sight of}} all the blood. This prompted theater officials to briefly interrupt the screening and ask for a doctor in the audience, causing a brief panic among the crowd. The violent scenes in [...] "Box Cutter" [...] proved so bloody that AMC included a disclaimer warning about the violence {{at the start of the}} episode and after <b>the</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>break</b> halfway through the episode.|$|E

500|$|The {{television}} show Bart watches, Tuesday Night Live, is {{a parody of}} NBC's Saturday Night Live. Krusty appears in a sketch called [...] "The Big Ear Family", and says that the sketch goes on for twelve more minutes, even though the joke's punchline has already been established. That was Jon Vitti's way of criticizing Saturday Night Live for having overlong sketches with thin joke premises. The sequence originally had a longer version of the Tuesday Night Live band playing into <b>the</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>break,</b> but it was cut because Vitti, who was a writer on Saturday Night Live during the 1985–86 season along with fellow The Simpsons writers, George Meyer and John Swartzwelder, {{did not want to}} come off as being bitter.|$|E
500|$|The Final Chase {{is played}} on a gameboard. The team {{receives}} a head start of one space for each member who advanced to this round. During <b>the</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>break,</b> the team chooses between two sets of questions, labeled [...] "A" [...] and [...] "B". The chaser plays the other set. The contestants have two minutes to answer as many questions as possible. After a question is asked, answers must be instantaneous, and contestants are only permitted to respond or pass a question after first ringing in. If a contestant rings in but another contestant answers, the answer is treated as wrong {{even if it was}} correct. If there is only one contestant in the Final Chase, then he or she does not ring in. Each question answered correctly within the time limit moves the team one space ahead on the board.|$|E

[...] Obama stated that if Colbert {{really wanted to be}} a soldier, along with his attendance to Basic Combat Training, he needed to have his hair shaved off. Obama then ordered General Odierno to [...] "shave that man's head". [...] General Odierno then began to shave Colbert's head; the job was finished during <b>the</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>break</b> by one of Colbert's staff members. One Army major said that [...] "shaving of the hair is an amazing show of support" [...] that was [...] "very touching". [...] The episode also featured a message to the troops from U.S. Senator John McCain with a friendly reminder to [...] "always remember to clean your muskets", a lesson he claimed to have learned at Valley Forge, as a reference to old age jokes that he faced during the 2008 Presidential Election. Several other prominent politicians, including former presidents Bill Clinton, George H. W. Bush, and George W. Bush, along with Vice President Joe Biden and then Alaska governor Sarah Palin recorded messages for the troops that were aired in the following episodes.|$|E

He served as a spokesman for Nike and {{was involved in a}} popular ad campaign called [...] "Bo Knows" [...] which envisioned Jackson attempting to take up a litany of other sports, including tennis, golf, luge, auto racing, and even playing blues music with Bo Diddley, who scolded Jackson by telling him, [...] "You don't know diddley!" [...] (in a later version of the spot, Jackson is shown playing the guitar expertly, after which an impressed Diddley says, [...] "Bo...you do know Diddley, don't you?") Serendipitously, the original spot first aired during <b>the</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>break</b> immediately following Jackson's lead-off home run in the 1989 Major League Baseball All-Star Game (as Vin Scully exclaimed, [...] "Look at that one!

2500|$|At {{the right}} of the screen above the ticker, three {{vertically}} stacked [...] "flippers", provides index and commodity prices (although during commercial breaks, the flippers relocate {{to the top of the}} ticker in a horizontal fashion to make room for the commercials themselves, which in turn, grow to four, except during the 30 minutes to the opening and closing bells, and during trading, where a bigger rectangular box, covering part of the ticker, usually shows the current trading status for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and the fourth flipper is replaced by the CNBC bug with the current time of the six different time zones). On weekdays, the flippers are hidden during <b>the</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>break</b> leading to, and including the last segment of Fast Money and throughout Mad Money, as the latter show uses different graphics which cover up the space (the three flippers however, remain in the right atop the ticker during weekend 6am ET replays of Options Action).|$|E

King asked her about the circumstances that led to it stating, [...] "I think many people were touched when the Miss America pageant issued an apology to you.” Williams credited Haskell (who was one of her judges during the Miss America 1984 pageant) for orchestrating her return. While both she and her mother initially responded with hesitation to the invitation, Williams finally agreed to participate on the condition that she could sing her song [...] "Oh How the Years Go By" [...] (to symbolize the passing of time since she was Miss America). She didn't know what Haskel would say, stating that she was simply told to stand and wait for him during <b>the</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>break</b> that would take place after her song. It was only when he arrived and placed his hand on her back (where she noticed that his hand was shaking) that Williams realized something significant was about to happen. Williams said {{that one of the most}} important outcomes of the apology was the positive impact that it had on her mother, who [...] "endured a lot" [...] during that period.|$|E
