This article presents a comprehensive analysis on working conditions of temporary agency workers. By using the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (GSOEP) the question will be answered, how precarious <b>temporary</b> agency <b>employment</b> really is. For this purpose seven dimensions will be defined and operationalised with subjective and objective items from the surveys in the years 2006 and 2007.

The evaluation of working conditions in <b>temporary</b> agency <b>employment</b> is a two-stage procedure. First, the results of the empirical analysis will be assessed from a comparative analytical perspective. This is to investigate whether temporary workers are disadvantaged in comparison to control subjects. Then, the question of whether <b>temporary</b> agency <b>employment</b> is precarious will be addressed by testing by means of objective criteria. The findings show that temporary agency workers are disadvantaged in a specific way. This applies to wages, employment stability and health related risks involved, as well as to work satisfaction. Furthermore, <b>temporary</b> agency <b>employment</b> is precarious due to employment instability.

In Veracruz, only 9helicopters were utilized to distribute food and water to isolated areas. About 948tons of medicine was also distributed. Helicopters assisted in transporting people to shelters. In Veracruz alone, 34people were rescued by boat and 1,131 by aircraft. In Puebla and Veracruz, 9,551troops were stationed to assist in relief work, utilizing 48helicopters, 4Hercules planes, and 10boats. Between Veracruz and Hidalgo, the Department of Social Development distributed about 18,500mattresses and other relief items. Workers quickly made repairs to highways, and by October19, all of the 28damaged federal highways were provisionally reopened; some of the reopened highways had to undergo additional construction work. The military worked to reopen other roads. In Veracruz, the Director of the Federal Electricity Commission noted that repairs to electrical systems were difficult {{in the immediate aftermath}} of the floods. Planes flew generators into Gutiérrez Zamora, Veracruz, mainly for hospitals, and by October20, 90% of the affected areas had their power restored. President Zedillo announced on October11 that the government would begin building new houses, part of the Emergency Housing Program initiative. In Puebla, the initial stages of the program would involve rebuilding 1,200houses and moving 500houses to safer lands. The Mexican government estimated that the housing program would help 37,000families. Mexico's agricultural ministry provided assistance for farmers to replant lost crops. Through the <b>Temporary</b> <b>Employment</b> Program, the federal government temporarily hired about 1million people who lost their homes or farms. Students gradually returned to school after repairs were made, and by October28, over 800,000students who were affected were able to return to school, including all of Oaxaca and Hidalgo. The area in Teziutlán, Puebla affected by the mudslide was never rebuilt, due to being labeled a high-risk area.|$|E

40|$|As a {{consequence}} of the rapid growth of <b>temporary</b> agency <b>employment</b> in Germany, the debate on the poor working conditions of temps, specifically their remuneration, has intensified recently. Using administrative data, the paper shows that the wage gap for German temp workers is rather large and varies between occupation and region. But temps already suffer from a marked wage decline before entering the temporary help sector. Nevertheless, <b>temporary</b> agency <b>employment</b> does not leave a long lasting scar. Two years after leaving the sector, temps no longer suffer from a wage penalty. A recent change in the law set a high incentive for temporary help agencies to pay their workers according to a sectoral collective agreement.

25|$|Although the {{government}} reduced its total spending, it managed {{to support a}} new public works program to provide <b>temporary</b> <b>employment</b> and to direct more resources to rural producers as intended in its program for structural change. Three lines of policy helped especially to raise rural incomes. The first was to use generous guaranteed prices for key food products. The second was to provide greatly increased agricultural credit, financed essentially by credit from the Central Bank. The third was to exempt most of the non-guaranteed agricultural prices from controls, allowing their prices to rise sharply relative to those of industrial products from the modern sector. From July 1985 to December 1986, prices {{of goods and services}} not under control increased more than three times as much as those under control.

25|$|Circular {{migration}} {{also plays}} an important role in international development, and policy initiatives have the potential to aid in this development. Many policy makers from both national and international institutions are advocating for policies that make the movement of migrant workers between their home and host countries easier. Ideally, established circular migration systems facilitated and protected by the law would allow for the “triple-win” scenario that benefits countries of origin, countries of destination and the migrants themselves. The International Organization for Migration advocates that destination countries should provide mechanisms that promote repeat and regular circular migration, while also providing incentives to return to their same job. There are several possible measures that would increase the ease and impact of circular migration. The provision of legal residential status and flexible work visas would likely allow for increased circular migration between countries. Giving returning migrants priority for residency permits for additional <b>temporary</b> <b>employment</b> over first-time migrants would make it easier for circular migrants to obtain official legal status, which has shown to be beneficial for migration. In addition, long-term multi-entry visas provided to return migrants would encourage multiple and repeated trips. Furthermore, one of the most simple policy recommendations is that governments should promote the free movement of individuals within the borders of their own countries. Lastly, in an effort to combat brain drain, the World Bank has called for developed countries to pay a tax to developing countries in order to make up for the loss of human capital.|$|E

Our purpose is also to understand what strategies they use to keep them selves employable and {{get an idea of}} what long-term consequences according to their experiences various <b>temporary</b> <b>employments</b> have had. To examine this, we conducted a study based of qualitative interviews. Six respondents aged between 29 - 35 years old, were interviewed about their experiences of a long period of various forms of <b>temporary</b> <b>employments.</b> The interviews were semi-structured and between 50 - 80 minutes long. We have built our analysis based on theories regarding: Flexibility, Employability, Job Insecurity, social capital, Emotional Labour. We then analysed our empirical data using thematic analysis. Our results show that the respondents experience an uncertainty about their future and a longing for security on many different levels. We also see that fierce competition in the labour market has contributed a feeling of having to do work beyond their employment agreement. Furthermore they seem to be using a combination of networking and Emotional Labour to make themselves indispensable to stay employable. Over time, this has contributed to several consequences such as; lack of confidence in both the system and the employers. Some respondents even expressed resignation and bitterness. Another consequence is how the respondents reflect on how to handle the challenge of choosing between security and their occupation. A theme that stands out is how to balance family life and employability in precarious employments. 3 Based on the results, it becomes clear just {{how difficult it is to}} conduct a good Systematic Work Environment Management, in respect to the prevention of psychosocial conditions linked to the work of these groups. In the new working environment regulation (AFS 2015 : 4), steps are taken to prevent an increase in work-related psychosocial health issues. We ask ourselves how effective this steps will be for our respondents, since they have mentioned attempt to hide weakness and disguise their emotions due to the interchange ability to make them selves employable. Creating security and sense of belonging for this group will become increasingly important as the number of <b>temporary</b> <b>employments</b> increase in the labour market, as does psychosocial health issues. This study contributes to the HR-field because the describing of how people with a long-term experience of insecure employments experience their situation will be important knowledge in the future.
