40|$|Abstract—Geometrical {{modeling}} of induction machines under eccentricity conditions involves {{a significant number}} of self and mutual inductances. These inductances are functions of rotor angular position, and calculating them at each time step requires solving computationally-intensive definite integrals. Conventional techniques use numerical look-up tables, or employ approximated analytical expressions such as limited-term Fourier series expression of <b>turn</b> <b>functions.</b> The former approach needs large memory volume given the size of inductance matrix. Moreover, numerical interpolations are needed upon model execution, which significantly slows down the simulation. The later technique is computationally tasking for a large set of Fourier series terms, or lacks sufficient accuracy if only a few terms are used. Alternatively, computationally efficient closed-form solutions for self- and mutual-inductance expressions are presented here. The step variations of <b>turn</b> <b>functions</b> are considered which streamlines the model formulation. The experimental results validate the proposed model. In particular, the frequency spectrum of the stator current illustrates the ability of proposed technique to detect eccentricity. 1...|$|R

30|$|These results {{illustrate}} {{the power of}} the image morphing and warping method, which directly benefit from the segmentation result and obtain a smooth transition between the original images. In the first example (Fig.  7), the shift of the cages (Definition 9) that best corresponds to a similarity using a <b>turning</b> <b>function</b> is found. Recall that the <b>turning</b> <b>function</b> returns the correspondence of points between the two cages that has the minimum turning distance. The intermediate interpolated image can then be obtained using the correspondence of cages. The second example (Fig.  8) has been obtained by avoiding the step of finding the shift of the cages. The morphing results show smoothness since the segmentation also are similar. In the third example (Fig.  9), we have an example of two images previously segmented with the CAC (see result in Fig.  6). Here, the morphing between the two different objects is smooth and the intermediate images clearly show the transition between the successive pairs. In the Additional file  1 we include an additional file video with an animation of a morphing result. In this animation one can appreciate the smooth transition between images.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} robust and {{efficient}} shape matching approach for Marker-less Motion Capture. Extracted features such as contour, gradient orientations and the <b>turning</b> <b>function</b> of the shape are embedded in a 1 -D string. We formulate shape matching as a Linear Assignment Problem and propose to use Dynamic Time Warping on the string representation of shapes to discard unlikely correspondences and thereby to reduce ambiguities and spurious local minima. Furthermore, the proposed cost matrix pruning results in robustness to scaling, rotation and topological changes and allows to greatly reduce the computational cost. We show that our approach can track fast human motions where standard articulated Iterative Closest Point algorithms fail. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} {{a set of}} users wishing to receive a service in an asynchronous distributed system. Such users declare their wishes and then wait to gain admittance to be served. Except for the initial transient period, at least one user must be waiting to be served, and the system should be as fair as possible for users. A procedure that ensures such a situation is called a <b>turn</b> <b>function.</b> It can be easily implemented in the asynchronous multi-writer/reader shared memory model. The turn func-tion is useful to solve some problems concerning temporal orders within an asynchronous distributed system (e. g., the mutual exclusion problem and the k-exclusion problem). In this paper we propose an algorithm for the <b>turn</b> <b>function</b> that can be implemented in the single-writer/multi-reader shared memory model. Its implementation is simpler than the general method of simulating operations of multi-writer/reader shared variables by using a bounded concurrent time-stamp scheme in the single-writer/multi-reader shared memory model. We show the correctness of our algorithm and discuss its efficiency. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a new document ranking system based on layout similarity. The user has a need represented by a set of ”wanted ” documents, and the system ranks documents in the collection according to this need. Rather than performing complete document analysis, the system extracts text lines, and models layouts as relationships between pairs of these lines. This paper explores three novel feature sets to support scoring in large document collections. First, pairs of lines are used to form quadrilaterals, which are represented by their <b>turning</b> <b>functions.</b> A non-Euclidean distance is used to measure similarity. Second, the quadrilaterals are represented by 5 D Euclidean vectors, and third, each line is represented by a 5 D Euclidean vector. We compare the classification performance and computation speed of these three feature sets using a large database of diverse documents including forms, academic papers and handwritten pages in English and Arabic. The approach using quadrilaterals and <b>turning</b> <b>functions</b> produces slightly better results, but the approach using vectors to represent text lines is much faster for large document databases. 1...|$|R
