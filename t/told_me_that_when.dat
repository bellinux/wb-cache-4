One {{could ask for}} clarification, but to even hint that one disagreed with him, or worse yet, to contradict him, would result in an immediate and permanent order to leave. One was tempted to ask such forbidden questions because Victor lived in mythic time and was totally uninterested in other people's concepts of logic or consistency... Another student <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> Victor read a new book and believed it was true, then he considered it to have always been true and would rethink his history accordingly." ...|$|E
2500|$|My husband <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> {{he was a}} lad of {{seventeen}} a thought struck him suddenly, which became the foundation of all his future discoveries. It was a flash of psychological insight into {{the conditions under which}} a mind most readily accumulates knowledge [...] For a few years he supposed himself to be convinced of the truth of [...] "the Bible" [...] as a whole, and even intended to take orders as a clergyman of the English Church. But by the help of a learned Jew in Lincoln he found out {{the true nature of the}} discovery which had dawned on him. This was that man's mind works by means of some mechanism which [...] "functions normally towards Monism." ...|$|E

60|$|That curious personage named John Dunn, an Englishman {{who became}} a Zulu chief, and who {{actually}} fought in this battle, as narrated by Mr. Quatermain, however, puts the number much lower. What the true total was will never be known; but Sir Melmoth Osborn <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> he swam his horse back across the Tugela that night it was black with bodies; and Sir Theophilus Shepstone also <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> he visited the scene {{a day or two}} later the banks of the river were strewn with multitudes of them, male and female.|$|E

60|$|That was the end, {{but they}} <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{afterwards}} <b>that,</b> <b>when</b> the great pyre had burned out, {{in it was}} found the head of Ki looking like a red-hot stone.

6000|$|... "Mr. Cossey <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> we married {{he would}} put those {{mortgages}} in the fire. It now seems that the mortgages were not his to dispose of, or else that he has since transferred them to Mr. Quest without informing us." ...|$|E
6000|$|Ford Obert {{has since}} <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> I {{came back to}} him there were tears in my eyes, and I didn't know at the moment how much the words with which he met me took for granted my {{consciousness}} of them. [...] "He looks a hundred years old!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Nobody but my sister,' pursued Charley, 'would {{have found}} out such an {{extraordinary}} companion. She has done it in a ridiculous fancy of giving herself up to another. She <b>told</b> <b>me</b> so, <b>that</b> night <b>when</b> we went there.' ...|$|R

6000|$|Phineas Colwell <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> he had {{informed}} Mrs. Perch that I {{was going to}} stop operations, she was in a dreadful state of mind.

6000|$|Whatever their exact title {{may have}} been, however, {{they made a}} great stand.

6000|$|... "Ah! {{that was}} the way we came to have you! I must tell you, dear Sir Stephen always guessed. Once when he had quite vexed poor mamma by {{preventing}} her from joking you in her way about young ladies, he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> once, <b>when</b> he was young, he had liked some one who died or was married, I don't quite know which, and he thought it was the same with you, from something <b>that</b> happened <b>when</b> you withdrew your application for leave after your wound." ...|$|R
6000|$|... [Footnote 1: Mr. Coleridge's {{admiration of}} Bull and Waterland as high theologians was very great. Bull {{he used to}} read in the Latin Defensio Fidei Nicaenae, using the Jesuit Zola's edition of 1784, which, I think, he bought at Rome. He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> once, <b>that</b> <b>when</b> he was reading a Protestant English Bishop's work on the Trinity, in a copy edited by an Italian Jesuit in Italy, he felt proud {{of the church of}} England, and in good humour with the church of Rome.--ED.] ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As {{a matter}} of fact," [...] said Walton, [...] "nearly all the best rags are played out.

6000|$|... "What the Gargoyles most dread is a noise," [...] {{said the}} man's voice. [...] "Our Champion <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> he shouted his battle-cry the creatures shuddered and drew back, hesitating to {{continue}} the combat.

6000|$|... (4) Mr. Booth {{refuses to}} {{guarantee}} his officers any fixed amount of salary. While {{he and his}} family of high officials live in comfort, if not in luxury, the pledged slaves whose devotion is the foundation of any true success the Army has met with often have [...] "hardly food enough to sustain life.

It has been as if a big gun were {{suddenly}} fired off behind her; she's feeling herself to see if she be hurt. It's but three days since she received a visit from the principal executor, who came in person, very gallantly, to notify her. He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> afterwards <b>that</b> <b>when</b> he had made his little speech she suddenly burst into tears.

He is mad about cats, and declares that the old Egyptians were right to worship them. He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> yesterday, <b>that</b> <b>when</b> his largest cat is dead he will canonise her, {{in spite of the}} Christians! And then he is so kind to his slaves! They are never whipped or punished, except when they neglect or disfigure themselves; for Vetranio will allow nothing that is ugly or dirty to come near him. You must visit his banqueting-hall in Rome. It is perfection!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Only ten years, {{and they}} have brought him from a barrack-room to the Tuileries. But he was born for it. You could not keep him down. De Bourrienne <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> {{he was a little}} fellow at Brienne he had the grand Imperial manner, and would praise or blame, glare or smile, exactly as he does now. Have you seen his mother, Monsieur de Laval? She is a tragedy queen, tall, stern, reserved, silent. There is the spring from which he flowed.' ...|$|E
60|$|He <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> he wak'd, {{he found}} himself in so violent a Sweat as he never had known the like; that his Pulse beat with that Heat and Rage, that it was like a Palpitation of the Heart to him, and that the Agitation of his Spirits was such, that he was not fully {{composed}} in some Hours; tho' the Satisfaction and Joy that attended him, when he found it was but a Dream, assisted much to return his Spirits to their due Temperament.|$|E
60|$|In {{such places}} {{squirrels}} use the ice for occasional journeys to the mainland. Sometimes also, when the waters are calm, they swim over. Hunters have <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> the breeze is fair they {{make use of}} a floating bit of wood, sitting tip straight with tail curled over their backs, making a sail of their bodies--just as an Indian, with no knowledge of sailing whatever, puts a spruce bush in a bow of his canoe and lets the wind do his work for him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Have {{you never}} heard?"

40|$|Professor Ping Sheng, {{who became}} one of the protagonists in the physics of random inhomogeneous media, <b>told</b> <b>me</b> once <b>that,</b> <b>when</b> he started {{research}} in this field thirty years ago, his senior colleagues tried to discourage him from studying “dirty ” materials and suggested he focused on traditional “nice” solids, such as crystals. Nowadays, it has become clear that disordered materials may possess unique physical properties that are significantly enhanced in comparison with their geometrically ordered counterparts. Among the traditional problems of the physics of random media are electron and photon localization, wave and particle transport through disordered systems, percolation, coherence and nonlinear effects. While there are well established theoretical approaches for the case of linear transport and optical properties, the nonlinear phenomena are still waiting for a complete theoretical description. In this book, I review recent advances in the nonlinear optics of random media. Significant progress in this field became possible, to a large extent...|$|R

"Then a stranger, a {{white man}} from Venezuela, came into our woods: {{this is the man}} that was bitten by a serpent, and his name is Abel; only I do not call him by that name, but by other names which I have told you.

For I must tell you, O mother, that after you died the priest at Voa <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{repeatedly}} <b>that</b> <b>when</b> I prayed, whether to you or to any of the saints, or to the Mother of Heaven, I must speak as he had taught me if I wished to be heard and understood.

Therefore listen to me now, O mother, and let nothing I say escape you.|$|R
