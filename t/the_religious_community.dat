5|$|Little Gidding was {{the home}} of an Anglican {{community}} established in 1626 by Nicholas Ferrar. The Ferrar household lived a Christian life according to High Church principles and the Book of Common Prayer. <b>The</b> <b>religious</b> <b>community</b> was dispersed during the English Civil War between Parliamentarians and Royalists but reformed, ending {{with the death of}} John Ferrar in 1657. Eliot had visited the site in May 1936.|$|E
5|$|Later medieval chroniclers, such as Roger of Wendover, {{gave some}} {{information}} about East Anglian events, but Yorke suggests that the annalistic format used forced these writers to guess the dates of the key events they recorded. Such later sources are therefore treated with caution. The Anglian collection, which dates from the late 8th century, contains an East Anglian genealogical tally, but Rædwald is not included. Rædwald is however {{referred to in the}} 8th century Vita of St Gregory the Great, written by a member of <b>the</b> <b>religious</b> <b>community</b> at Whitby. The Battle of the River Idle, in which Rædwald and his forces defeated the Northumbrians, is described in the 12th century Historia Anglorum, written by Henry of Huntingdon.|$|E
5|$|By tradition, Anna {{is said to}} {{have had}} a fourth daughter, Wihtburh, an abbess at Dereham (or {{possibly}} West Dereham), where there was a royal double monastery. She may never have existed: Bede fails to mention her and she first appears in a calendar in the late 10th century Bosworth Psalter. She may have been a character specifically created by <b>the</b> <b>religious</b> <b>community</b> at Ely, where her remains were supposed to have been taken after being stolen from Dereham and subsequently used as visual proof of the incorruptibility of a saint's body, a substitute for her sister Æthelthryth, whose body had to remain unexamined in her tomb. Manuscript F of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, which dates from about 1100, mentions Wihtburh's death when it records that her body was found uncorrupted in 798, 55 years after she died. The resulting date for her death of 743 is too far too late for her to have been a sister of Æthelthryth, who was born in 636.|$|E

5|$|The town {{developed}} {{around its}} 11th-century priory, a Benedictine monastery, {{the remains of}} which make {{up some of the}} early parts of Great Malvern Priory, now a large parish church. Several slightly different histories explain the actual founding of <b>the</b> <b>religious</b> <b>community.</b> Legend tells that the settlement began following the murder of St. Werstan, a monk of Deerhurst, who fled from the Danes and took refuge in the woods of Malvern, where the above-mentioned hermitage had been established. St Werstan's oratory is thought to have been located on the site of St Michael's Chapel which is believed to have stood on the site of Bello Sguardo, a Victorian Villa. Bello Sguardo was built on the site of Hermitage Cottage. The cottage was demolished in 1825 and ecclesiastical carvings were found within it. A Mediaeval undercroft, human bones and parts of a coffin were also uncovered. Although the legend may be monastic mythology, historians have however concluded that St. Werstan was the original martyr.|$|E
25|$|Soviet {{officials}} identified religion {{closely with}} nationality. The implementation of policy toward a particular religion, therefore, {{depended on the}} regime's perception of the bond between that religion and the nationality practicing it, the size of <b>the</b> <b>religious</b> <b>community,</b> {{the extent to which}} the religion accepted outside authority, and the nationality's willingness to subordinate itself to political authority. Thus the smaller <b>the</b> <b>religious</b> <b>community</b> and the more closely it identified with a particular nationality, the more restrictive were the regime's policies, especially if the religion also recognized a foreign authority such as the pope.|$|E

They have freely chosen to remain in that place, the custody {{of which has been}} entrusted to them by the Holy See, and which constitutes their home. The other 200 Palestinians besieged inside the Basilica have taken refuge there by force in order to flee from the sweep and search by the Israeli army, just as had happened to the 5 Italian journalists during {{the first day of the}} siege.

25|$|Abelard {{composed}} a hymnbook for <b>the</b> <b>religious</b> <b>community</b> that Héloïse joined.

25|$|Depending on <b>the</b> <b>religious</b> <b>community</b> a {{musician}} belonged to, {{it was more}} or less considered a sin to play this low-down music: blues was the devil's music. Musicians were therefore segregated into two categories: gospel singers and blues singers, guitar preachers and songsters. However, when rural black music began to be recorded in the 1920s, both categories of musicians used similar techniques: call-and-response patterns, blue notes, and slide guitars. Gospel music was nevertheless using musical forms that were compatible with Christian hymns and therefore less marked by the blues form than its secular counterpart.|$|E
25|$|At {{the outset}} of 1938, Gleizes learned that <b>the</b> <b>religious</b> <b>community</b> that owned Moly Sabata, a large house he had rented in Sablons, was ready to sell.

25|$|Governance and {{decision}} making is conducted at a special meeting for worship—often called a meeting for worship with a concern for business or meeting for worship for church affairs at which all members can attend, as in a Congregational church.

They believe this is the gathering of believers who wait upon the Lord to discover God's will, believing that they are not making their own decisions. They seek to understand God's will for <b>the</b> <b>religious</b> <b>community,</b> via the actions of the Holy Spirit within the meeting.|$|E
25|$|Mark Tauber, senior {{vice-president}} of HarperOne, {{has stated that}} the Green Bible was developed {{with the intention of}} being “the first ever specialty bible that takes the issues of sustainability, stewardship of the earth, what many in <b>the</b> <b>religious</b> <b>community</b> call ‘creation care’ very seriously”. He went further, exposing on the Green Bible’s purpose: “That the Bible has a profound message of sustainability—some might argue, the original message—is not all that surprising. What is surprising {{is that it is not}} one of the first things that comes to mind when most folks think about the Bible and its message... this Bible seeks to change that fact. We believe that the unique and specially added features by some of today's most important thinkers, writers and leaders, across the ecumenical spectrum make it a must-have for those who already find motivation, comfort and inspiration in it and for the many more who might see it freshly as a critical resource in their journey to sustain our planet”.|$|E
