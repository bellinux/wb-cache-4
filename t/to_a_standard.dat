5|$|Since {{forces are}} {{perceived}} as pushes or pulls, this can provide an intuitive understanding for describing forces.

5|$|The quick pace {{of change}} meant that many ships were {{obsolete}} {{as soon as they}} were finished, and that naval tactics were in a state of flux. Many ironclads were built to make use of the ram or the torpedo, which a number of naval designers considered the important weapons of naval combat. There is no clear end to the ironclad period, but towards the end of the 1890s the term ironclad dropped out of use. New ships were increasingly constructed <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>standard</b> pattern and designated battleships or armored cruisers.|$|E
5|$|A {{project to}} convert the former southbound-only Richards Boulevard access {{just south of the}} American River <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>standard</b> signalized {{intersection}} was completed in August 2007; this improves access to existing and future development in the area, including redevelopment of a former rail yard, while slowing northbound traffic heading for the bridge and freeway. Another project converting Freeport Boulevard and 21st Street south of Broadway into two-way streets was also completed. 21st Street has carried northbound traffic since 1974, when Caltrans took it over. This will calm traffic while improving the intersection {{at the south end of}} the former one-way pair, which the RT Light Rail now crosses 21st Street just to the north of. In addition, the three blocks of F Street that carried southbound SR 160 from 12th Street to 15th Street have been calmed by the addition of a roundabout at 13th Street.|$|E

Three days later, head coach Larry Krystkowiak and Harris met with Yi, attempting to influence him to play for Milwaukee, however, Yi's representatives requested that the team trade Yi to another team with a city that had a large Chinese presence. Chinese officials also required that any team Yi played for would have to give him sufficient playing time for him to improve for the 2008 Summer Olympics. Kohl made a special trip to Hong Kong to appeal to Yi personally and he assured Chinese officials that Yi would have sufficient playing time.

5|$|As bacon {{ice cream}} {{was created in}} 1992 and came to {{prominence}} in the 2000s, there is no traditional recipe. Recipes generally involve adding bacon <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>standard</b> sweet ice cream recipe, often vanilla but other suggestions include coffee, rum or pecan. The saltiness of the bacon highlights {{the sweetness of the}} ice cream. According to one Wired.com article, the bacon should be candied prior to addition, a process which involves baking the bacon in a sugar syrup. This has the benefit of sweetening the bacon, in a similar manner to pancakes {{in some parts of the}} United States.|$|E
5|$|Fantastic Adventures was {{initially}} published in bedsheet format, {{the same size}} as the early sf magazines such as Amazing, perhaps in order to attract fans who were nostalgic for the larger format. It started as a bimonthly, but in January 1940 began a monthly schedule. Sales were weaker than for Amazing, however, and with the June issue the schedule reverted to bimonthly. The size was also reduced <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>standard</b> pulp format, since that was cheaper to produce. Sales did not improve, and Ziff-Davis planned to make the October issue the last one. That issue carried Robert Moore Williams' Jongor of Lost Land, and had a cover by J. Allen St. John; the combination proved to be so popular that October sales were twice the August figures. This convinced Ziff-Davis that the magazine was viable, and it was restarted in January 1941as a bimonthly at first, but switching to monthly again in May of that year.|$|E

5|$|From 1891, more {{locomotives}} {{were needed}} {{for work on}} the extension line from Baker Street into the country. Four C Class (0-4-4) locomotives, a development of South Eastern Railway's 'Q' Class, were received in 1891. In 1894, two D Class locomotives were bought to run between Aylesbury and Verney Junction. These were not fitted with the condensing equipment needed to work south of Finchley Road. Four more were delivered in 1895 with condensing equipment, although these were prohibited working south of Finchley Road. In 1896, two E Class (0-4-4) locomotives were built at Neasden works, followed by one in 1898 to replace the original Class A No. 1, damaged in an accident. Four more were built by Hawthorn Leslie & Co in 1900 and 1901. To cope with the growing freight traffic on the extension line, the Met received four F Class (0-6-2) locomotives in 1901, similar to the E Class except for the wheel arrangement and without steam heat. In 1897 and 1899, the Met received two 0-6-0 saddle tank locomotives <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>standard</b> Peckett design. Unclassified by the Met, these were generally used for shunting at Neasden and Harrow.|$|E
5|$|Hood {{was due to}} be modernised in 1941 {{to bring}} her up <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>standard</b> {{similar to that of}} other modernised World War I-era capital ships. She would have {{received}} new, lighter turbines and boilers, a secondary armament of eight twin 5.25-inch gun turrets and six octuple 2-pounder pom-poms. Her 5-inch upper armour strake would have been removed and her deck armour reinforced. A catapult would have been fitted across the deck and the remaining torpedo tubes removed. In addition the conning tower would have been removed and her bridge rebuilt. The ship's near-constant active service, resulting from her status as the Royal Navy's most battle-worthy fast capital ship, meant that her material condition gradually deteriorated, and by the mid-1930s she was in need of a lengthy overhaul.|$|E
5|$|On January 9, 2006, the MTA Bus Company {{took over}} the {{operations}} of the Green Lines routes as part of the city's takeover of all the remaining privately operated bus routes. On February 20, 2006, the city {{took over the}} operations of Triboro Coach. Shortly after the takeover, in April 2006, the Q53 nonstop express was converted <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>standard</b> limited-stop service, with the MTA adding six stops along Woodhaven and Cross Bay Boulevards. In January 2007, the Q53 was routed away from the 63rd Drive subway station, running the entire length of Woodhaven and Cross Bay Boulevards. On August 31, 2008, the Q21 was extended north along Woodhaven Boulevard. These service changes led to an increase in ridership along the corridor. Due to the shift in ridership patterns, late night service on the Q11 after midnight was truncated to Pitkin Avenue on September 12, 2010. Q21 service was also adjusted to run for longer during the evenings.|$|E

5|$|On September 21, 2000, Universal Interactive Studios and Konami {{announced}} that they had entered an agreement that would enable Konami to publish a Crash Bandicoot game for next-generation game systems, with Universal Interactive handling {{the production of the}} games. The agreement served to break the Crash Bandicoot franchise's exclusivity to Sony-produced consoles and effectively made Crash Bandicoot a mascot character for Universal rather than Sony. After Universal fell out with Cerny and Sony, Traveller's Tales was forced to alter the game from a free-roaming title <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>standard</b> Crash title. Traveller's Tales had to begin development of the game from scratch and were given only twelve months to complete the game.|$|E

All iPad models have a special A/V adapter that converts Apple's data line <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>standard</b> HDMI (Type A) port. Samsung has a similar proprietary thirty-pin port for their Galaxy Tab 10.1 that can adapt to HDMI as well as USB drives. The Dell Streak 5 smartphone/tablet hybrid is capable of outputting over HDMI. While the Streak uses a PDMI port, a separate cradle is available which adds HDMI compatibility. Most of the Chinese-made tablets running Android OS provide HDMI output using a mini-HDMI (type C) port. Most new laptops and desktops now have built in HDMI as well.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} of current-day Route31 began around1916, when {{a portion of}} the highway, along the community of Hampton was taken over by the state and was repaired to state standards for $300 (1916USD). In1923, the state of New Jersey passed the Good Roads Act, which greatly expanded the state highway system in New Jersey. This act took over pre-existing highways and rebuilt them <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>standard</b> mandated by the state. Construction began on Route31 in1926, when the State Highway Department began work at the southern terminus in Trenton. A total of11 bridges were constructed along the highway during this time, signifying the route's construction northward. The oldest ones, dating back to1926, were located in Ewing Township and Oxford Township. The one in Ewing Township was along the first portion of the highway to be constructed.|$|E

5|$|While blank {{variety is}} the {{defining}} demarcation between one Balabushka cue and another, {{there are some}} shared features spanning Balabushka's fleeting 16-year career. Cue forearms were characteristically made with straight-grained maple, based on Balabushka's belief that a single-direction maple grain provided superior integrity to that of curly maple or birdseye maple. He used stainless steel joints and delrin butt caps almost exclusively. A small number of his cues feature ivory joints and ivory butt caps, making them highly valued collector's items. Balabushka used a distinguishing reddish-brown bumper, and employed Cortland Irish linen for many of his wraps, with the highly sought after leather wrap a rare departure for him and a distinct value enhancer. Unless a different length was specified, Balabushka made all his cues <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>standard</b> 57½ inches in length.|$|E
5|$|After the Falklands War, the UK {{government}} began upgrading the defences of the Falkland Islands {{to guard against}} any further aggression from Argentina. One of the measures taken was the deployment of an interceptor squadron to the islands, with 23 Squadron forming at RAF Stanley in October 1983. At the time, the air defence variant of the Panavia Tornado was still in development, meaning that the Phantom was the UK's primary air defence aircraft (supported by two remaining squadrons of Lightnings). The removal of a squadron of Phantoms to the Falkland Islands left {{a gap in the}} UK's air defences and nothing immediately available to fill it, given that the Tornado was still some years from service. As a result, the UK government decided to purchase another squadron of Phantoms. Because the aircraft in RAF service were a special production batch built to UK specifications, it would not be possible to obtain identical aircraft, so 15 second-hand airframes were procured from among the best of the ex-US Navy F-4Js stored at the Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Center at Davis–Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona and the Naval Air Rework Facility at NAS North Island. The F-4J was chosen because it was the variant from which the RAF's F-4Ks and F-4Ms were developed, and was thus the closest available to the British aircraft. The 15 that were selected were extensively refurbished and brought <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>standard</b> almost equivalent to the F-4S, which was the last variant in service with the US Navy, the only differences being the absence of leading-edge slats and a helmet gun sight.|$|E
5|$|The main {{creative}} {{force behind}} the overall 3D presentation was Kazuyuki Hashimoto, the general supervisor for these sequences. Being experienced in the new technology the team had brought on board, he accepted the post at Square as the team aligned with his own creative spirit. One of the major events in development was when the real-time graphics were synchronized to computer-generated full motion video (FMV) cutscenes for some story sequences, notably an early sequence where a real-time model of Cloud jumps onto an FMV-rendered moving train. The backgrounds were created by overlaying two 2D graphic layers and changing the motion speed of each to simulate depth perception. While {{this was not a}} new technique, the increased power of the PlayStation enabled a more elaborate version of this effect. The biggest issue with the 3D graphics was the large memory storage gap between the development hardware and the console: while the early 3D tech demo had been developed on a machine with over 400 megabytes of total memory, the PlayStation only had two megabytes of system memory and 500 kilobytes for texture memory. The team needed {{to figure out how to}} shrink the amount of data while preserving the desired effects. This was aided with reluctant help from Sony, who had hoped to keep Square's direct involvement limited <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>standard</b> API package, but they eventually relented and allowed the team direct access to the hardware specifications.|$|E
