5|$|During Easter in 1563, some {{priests in}} Ayrshire celebrated Mass, thus defying the law. Some Protestants tried <b>to</b> <b>enforce</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> {{themselves}} by apprehending these priests. This prompted Mary to summon Knox {{for the third}} time. She asked Knox to use his influence to promote religious toleration. He defended their actions and noted she was bound to uphold the laws and if she did not, others would. Mary surprised Knox by agreeing that the priests would be brought to justice.|$|E
5|$|Older {{accounts}} of the Whiskey Rebellion portrayed it as being confined to western Pennsylvania, yet there was opposition to the whiskey tax in the western counties of every other state in Appalachia (Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia). The whiskey tax went uncollected throughout the frontier state of Kentucky, where {{no one could be}} convinced <b>to</b> <b>enforce</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> or prosecute evaders. In 1792, Hamilton advocated military action to suppress violent resistance in western North Carolina, but Attorney General Edmund Randolph argued that there was insufficient evidence to legally justify such a reaction.|$|E
5|$|The {{careers of}} Brahmins usually related to education, the judiciary, astrology, mathematics, poetry and {{philosophy}} or {{the occupation of}} hereditary administrative posts. Also Brahmins increasingly practiced non-Brahminical professions (agriculture, trade in betel nuts and martial posts). Capital punishment, although widespread, was not given to the royal Kshatriya sub-castes or to Brahmins found guilty of heinous crimes (as {{the killing of a}} Brahmin in medieval Hindu India was itself considered a heinous crime). As an alternate punishment <b>to</b> <b>enforce</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> a Brahmin's right hand and left foot was severed, leaving that person disabled.|$|E

5|$|Clarke was {{appointed}} the first Resident Commissioner in Basutoland (today Lesotho) and took office on 16 March 1884. In the preceding years, Basutoland had become unruly. In 1879, an uprising by Chief Morosi was quelled but led to intertribal strife over {{the partition of}} his land. The Cape government sought to regain control in 1880 by extending the Cape Peace Preservation Act of 1878 to Basutoland, which provided for the disarmament of natives. Attempts <b>to</b> <b>enforce</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> resulted in the Basuto Gun War of 1880 to 1881. Unrest continued until it was agreed in 1884 to place the territory under direct British control.|$|E
5|$|In May 1871, Grant ordered {{federal troops}} to help marshals in arresting Klansmen. That October, Grant {{suspended}} habeas corpus {{in part of}} South Carolina and sent federal troops <b>to</b> <b>enforce</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> there. After prosecutions by Akerman and his replacement, George Henry Williams, the Klan's power collapsed; by 1872, elections in the South saw African Americans voting in record numbers. That same year, Grant signed the Amnesty Act, which restored political rights to former Confederates. Lacking sufficient funding, the Justice Department stopped prosecutions of the Klan in June 1873; civil rights prosecutions continued throughout Grant's second term but with fewer yearly cases and convictions. Additionally, Grant's Postmaster General John Creswell, using his patronage powers, integrated the postal system and appointed African American postmasters across the nation.|$|E
5|$|Usually, when {{a gunman}} {{was hired by}} a town as town marshal, they {{received}} {{the full support of}} the townspeople until order was restored, at which point the town would tactfully indicate {{it was time for a}} change to a less dangerous lawman who relied more on respect than fear <b>to</b> <b>enforce</b> <b>the</b> <b>law.</b> A good example was the 1882 decision by the El Paso, Texas, town council to dismiss Town Marshal Dallas Stoudenmire. He entered the council hall and dared the councilors to try to take his guns or his job, at which point they immediately changed their mind, saying he could keep his job. He resigned on his own a couple of days later.|$|E
