25|$|The {{new year}} began with no {{work at the}} {{convention}} center construction site. Mayor Celebrezze ordered city Law Director Ralph S. Locher to order Hunkin-Conkey to begin work in three days or be in default of its completion bond. These demands were communication on December 26 and 27, 1961. The construction company replied with a five-page letter outlining why it could not. William S. Hunsel, a consultant to Outcalt, Guenther & Van Buren, advised Hunkin-Conkey <b>to</b> <b>dewater</b> in sections, laying the foundation in sections. But the company refused, as this {{would be much more}} expensive. Implementing a new drainage system was the only solution, company officials said, and it would take four more months to finish the foundation. Hunkin-Conkey's reply was unacceptable to the city, so on January 11 Cleveland Properties Director Harold Lausche sent the bonding firm, Federal Insurance Co., noticed of failure to perform. Defending itself to the insurer, Hunkin-Conkey said its contract required all pumping to be complete before additional excavation could proceed. The company admitted that it had successfully tested a dragline excavator to remove watery soil at the site, but it would need written city approval to use the excavator for the remaining foundation work.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{objective}} of a belt press filter is <b>to</b> <b>dewater</b> process sludge {{and much of}} this dewatering occurs in the gravity drainage zone. The gravity drainage zone can achieve a 5 to 10 percent increase in solids concentration. The degree of dewatering in the gravity drainage zone is greatly dependent {{on the type of}} solids, the filter media and the sludge conditioning. The dewatering achieved in the gravity drainage zone is adversely affected if the sludge is poorly spread across the belt or the residence time is insufficient. Sludge conditioning is the addition of chemicals to promote flocculation of particles to form a thickened sludge and to promote dewatering. Dewatering can be promoted by the addition of surfactant and flocculation is achieved via the addition of high molecular weight polymer. Flocculation is improved with optimum polymer dosage, polymer dilution and mixing. The pH of the feed slurry must also be monitored and controlled as low pH decreases flocculation. It is important to find the optimum value for each conditioning parameter as too much polymer or mixing can {{have a negative impact on}} flocculation and greatly increase operating expenses. The effects of sludge conditioning are most apparent in the gravity drainage zone which can be easily replicated on a laboratory scale where the optimum conditioning strategy can be determined. For a belt press filter to be industrially viable it must be economically efficient and thus maximum throughput is desired. Without sufficient conditioning, the gravity drainage is generally the limiting process step, but with optimum dilution the limiting process step can be shifted to the compression zone.|$|E

2500|$|The {{existing}} ponds {{above and}} below the minor road from Pumsaint to Caeo, were probably part of a cascade for washing ore, the upper tank having yielded large quantities of Roman pottery from ca 78 to at least 300 AD (Lewis, 1977; Burnham 2004). The upper pool is known as Melin-y-Milwyr, or the soldiers' mill, an intriguing name that implies that watermills may have been used here during the Roman period. Alternatively, {{it may have been a}} sequence of washing tables for the crushed gold ore. A large-scale mill complex is known from Barbegal in southern France, where no less than 16 mills (in two lines of 8 each) were built into the side of a hill and supplied with water from a single aqueduct. There were two lines of parallel overshot mills, the outflow from one feeding the next below. The mill supplied flour to the region. Moreover, Roman engineers used sequences of reverse overshot water-wheels <b>to</b> <b>dewater</b> mines, and the deep workings at Dolaucothi produced a fragment of such a wheel during the 1930s when deep mining operations were resumed. Sequences of such wheels increased the lift, and one extensive sequence of 16 wheels was found in old Roman mine workings on the Rio Tinto river in the 1920s. The wheels were arranged in pairs and could lift water about [...] from the bottom of the mine there.|$|E
40|$|Many {{claims have}} been made {{regarding}} the effectiveness of chemical additives and amendments (A&As) to reduce the potential for odors from organic residuals.

This manuscript summarizes results for several A&As that was evaluated relative to their potential to reduce odors in staged and/or stored PDW biosolids. Conventional head space sampling from incubated biosolids samples and GC-MS analysis was coupled with human sensory evaluation. Of the A&As selected for study, none were effective for both staging and storage odor mitigation situations.

40|$|Lecturepg. 97 The {{features}} are discussed of a PLC based control scheme {{that was developed}} for a multipump pumping station {{to be used to}} supply oil field produced liquids (crude oil and associated water) from tanks through a dehydration facility <b>to</b> <b>dewatered</b> crude storage. The hydraulic resistance characteristic of this system exhibits substantial variation and the required flow is variable and covers a wide range from initial startup conditions to the eventual peak capacity requirement. The avoidance of unnecessary energy input to the product was of special importance, since it would promote the formation or stabilization of emulsion of the produced fluids, thereby complicating the dehydration process. The control scheme developed is applicable to any variable-speed, parallel pump station. With the optimum pump number fixed in this way, pump speed is simply controlled to provide the desired overall flow. As a minimum, values of Q and N (or excitation frequency) have to be measured and input to the control scheme. The individual values of Q/N, besides providing the basis of pump number optimization, also permit protection against excessively high or low flow, Additional practical aspects are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Although {{organophosphate}} esters (OPEs) in {{the ambient}} environment are from sewage treatment plants {{due to the}} discharge of effluent and application of sludge, the distribution, degradation and fate of OPEs in advanced municipal sewage treatment plants remain unclear. This work focused {{on the use of}} mass flow and mass balance analysis to understand the behaviors and fate of 14 OPEs in an advanced municipal sewage treatment plant. OPEs were detected in all sewage water and sludge samples with total OPEs (SOPEs) concentrations of 1399 +/- 263 ng/L in raw sewage aqueous phase, 833 +/- 175 ng/L in tertiary effluent aqueous phase, and 315 +/- 89 ng/g dry weight in dewatered sludge. The dissolved concentrations of SOPEs significantly decreased during biological treatment, whereas negligible decrease was observed in mechanical and physical-chemical treatments. For individual OPE, the chlorinated tris(2 -chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP) and tris(2 -chloroisopropyl) phosphate (TCPP) did not decrease but increased during both biological treatment and physical-chemical treatment. Mass flow analysis indicated the total removal efficiency of SOPEs in aqueous phase was 40. 5 %, and the polarity-specific removal efficiencies for individual OPE were positively related to their solid-water partition coefficients (K-d). Furthermore, mass balance results showed that 53. 1 % and 6. 3 % of the initial OPE mass flow were eventually transferred to the effluents and dewatered sludge, respectively, while the remaining 39. 9 % and 0. 7 % were lost due to biodegradation and physical-chemical treatment, respectively. It was indicated that the activated sludge treatment system with anaerobic/anoxic/aerobic bioreactors was {{a major factor in the}} removal of OPEs from the raw sewage, while transfer <b>to</b> <b>dewatered</b> sludge governed by hydrophobic interactions was limited during the sewage treatment. Meanwhile, the degradation difference of OPEs in activated sludge treatment was more related with their molecular structure over their hydrophobicity. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V.
