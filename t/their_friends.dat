When these pairs of users know each other offline, {{they are more likely}} to (1) respond to the online gesture of friendship from <b>their</b> <b>friend,</b> (2) share mutual online friends, (3) distribute and gather information in <b>their</b> <b>friend’s</b> Twitter network, (4) pay attention to <b>their</b> <b>friend’s</b> tweets, (5) post tweets that might be of interest to <b>their</b> <b>friend,</b> (6) post tweets similar to <b>their</b> <b>friend’s,</b> (7) respond to <b>their</b> <b>friend’s</b> tweet, (8) mention <b>their</b> <b>friend</b> in tweets, and (9) distribute <b>their</b> <b>friend’s</b> tweets.

40|$|Machiavellianism and {{emotional}} manipulation {{has not been}} investigated in friendships. The current studies investigated Machiavellianism, emotional manipulation, and six friendship functions in women's same-sex friendships. For study 1, women (N = 221) completed the Mach IV, emotional manipulation measure (with reference to their own behaviour and <b>their</b> <b>friend's</b> behaviour), mood worsening and use of inauthentic displays from the managing emotions of others scale, and the friendship function measure. Machiavellianism predicted the self-perceived ability to employ emotional manipulation towards a same-sex <b>friend</b> and perceiving <b>their</b> <b>friend</b> to use emotional manipulation towards them. Machiavellianism predicted lower scores on all six friendship functions. For study 2, women (N = 186) completed the Mach IV, the modified emotional manipulation measure (with reference to their own behaviour and <b>their</b> <b>friend's</b> behaviour), and the friendship function measure. Women high on Machiavellianism reported using emotional manipulation more frequently towards <b>their</b> same-sex <b>friend</b> and perceived <b>their</b> same-sex <b>friend</b> to frequently use emotional manipulation towards them. Machiavellianism predicted lower scores on five of the friendship functions. These studies demonstrated that women higher on Machiavellianism employ emotional manipulation in their same-sex friendships. Women with higher Machiavellianism scores also perceived that they themselves were manipulated by <b>their</b> <b>friend...</b>|$|R
