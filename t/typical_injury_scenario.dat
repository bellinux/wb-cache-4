40|$|Australian Rules {{football}} (ARF) is {{a common}} team sport played in Australia. Injury rates from ARF are higher than most sport and recreational activities in Australia, with substantial cost to the community from injuries. The aim {{of this research was}} to investigate if community level ARF sports trainers responsible for dealing with injuries have appropriate first aid qualifications, knowledge and confidence. There was no known research in this area for Australian football. A questionnaire was designed and distributed to two Melbourne metropolitan community level ARF leagues (65 clubs) via post. Sports trainers were invited to provide details of qualifications, injury recording and club rules for injuries, Trainers were also questioned on their responses to <b>injury</b> <b>scenarios</b> and their confidence in dealing with certain injuries. Only eight completed questionnaires were returned. Most respondents had first aid qualifications but did not record injury reports. Club injury recovery procedures were non-existent. Only 50 % of respondents correctly answered the "player choking" <b>injury</b> <b>scenario.</b> Many trainers reported not referring players and treatment injuries themselves, before acting outside their role and responsibilities as a trainer. {{the results of the study}} emphasize the need for providers of first aid training to reassess their teaching of various <b>injury</b> <b>scenarios</b> and the importance of referring injured players to appropriate health practitioners. Sporting leagues should regulate that all trainers complete an accredited sports first aid qualification to ensure confidence and competence of their trainers and potentially reduce complications from sports injuries. Further research in the area is needed. This minor thesis was written by a post-graduate student as part of the requirements of the Master of Health Science (Osteopathy) program...|$|R
40|$|Injuries to {{articular}} cartilage {{result in the}} development of lesions that form {{on the surface of the}} cartilage. Such lesions are associated with {{articular cartilage}} degeneration and osteoarthritis. The <b>typical</b> <b>injury</b> response often causes collateral damage, primarily an effect of inflammation, which results in the spread of lesions beyond the region where the initial injury occurs. We present a minimal mathematical model based on known mechanisms to investigate the spread and abatement of such lesions. In particular we represent the "balancing act" between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines that is hypothesized to be a principal mechanism in the expansion properties of cartilage damage during the <b>typical</b> <b>injury</b> response. We present preliminary results of in vitro studies that confirm the anti-inflammatory activities of the cytokine erythropoietin (EPO). We assume that the diffusion of cytokines determine the spatial behaviour of injury response and lesion expansion so that a reaction-diffusion system involving chemical species and chondrocyte cell state population densities is a natural way to represent cartilage injury response. We present computational results using the mathematical model showing that our representation is successful in capturing much of the interesting spatial behaviour of injury associated lesion development and abatement in articular cartilage. Further, we discuss the use of this model to study the possibility of using EPO as a therapy for reducing the amount of inflammation induced collateral damage to cartilage during the <b>typical</b> <b>injury</b> response. The mathematical model presented herein suggests that not only are anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as EPO necessary to prevent chondrocytes signaled by pro-inflammatory cytokines from entering apoptosis, they may also influence how chondrocytes respond to signaling by pro-inflammatory cytokines.

40|$|AbstractLaceration {{injuries}} in rugby union account for approximately 6 % of all injuries sustained during match play. Commentators often cite {{the design of}} studded footwear as a causal factor in laceration injuries. In order to assess the laceration injury risk of different stud designs, {{there is a need}} to develop a testing protocol that is able to replicate the laceration injury event. This study used a questionnaire to identify the play scenarios that result in laceration injuries. The questionnaire was answered by 191 rugby players, of which 72 % had experienced one or more stud injuries during their career which hindered them playing rugby. Half of the laceration injuries described by the respondents came from the ruck, and 27 % from a tackle. When analysing free-text responses, a deliberate stamp was described in 35 % of the responses and a tackle from behind was described in 14 % of responses. These <b>injury</b> <b>scenarios</b> are considered to be the dominant cause of laceration injuries. In future work the identified <b>injury</b> <b>scenarios</b> will be replicated in simulated play and kinetic and kinematic measurements will be recorded. This will inform test parameters for future assessment of laceration injury risk of stud designs...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND This article {{addresses}} <b>typical</b> <b>injury</b> patterns {{related to}} the traditional Swiss team sport of Hornussen. A small plastic disk is struck with a special elastic racket and then intercepted in the field. Severe injuries have occasionally been reported. We present a systematic review of all cases of Hornussen injuries treated in the University Hospital of Bern from 2000 to 2014. METHODS To assess the frequency, type and outcome of Hornussen injuries, we performed a database search of all inpatient and outpatient cases related to Hornussen and that were admitted to and/or treated in Bern University Hospital from 2000 to 2014. RESULTS A total of 28 such patients could be identified. Apart from 1 woman injured as a bystander and treated as an outpatient, all patients were male and active players. <b>Typical</b> <b>injury</b> patterns comprised midfacial fractures and severe ocular traumata, very often in combination. Almost all of these patients had to be hospitalised due to {{the severity of the}} trauma suffered and underwent surgery. 1 patient had to be admitted to the intensive care unit prior to the operation. CONCLUSIONS Eye and face injuries caused by Hornussen can be devastating. This resembles the potential risk of other bat-and-ball sports, such as cricket and baseball. Apart from the economic loss due to treatment costs and sick leave, these injuries can be disabling for life. It should therefore be mandatory for all players to wear protective gear, as is already the case for Hornussen players born in 1984 or later...|$|R

40|$|Mechanical or {{chemical}} stress to cartilage kills chondrocytes (i. e., cartilage cells) {{resulting in the}} development of lesions on the cartilage surface.

We describe our approach to the soft tissue and skeletal injury patterns seen in these injuries. Methods: We present a case report of a traumatic chainsaw injury to the face. Results: A literature review of the <b>typical</b> <b>injury</b> patterns seen in chainsaw injuries to the face is discussed. Fractures to the bony orbit are on {{of the most common}} findings. Traumatic orbital fractures are often associated with other facial fractures, including those of the maxillary sinus and naso-orbitalethmoid (NOE) region.
