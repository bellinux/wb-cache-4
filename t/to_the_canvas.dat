5|$|In {{the first}} round, Cotto landed a low blow that put Judah <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>canvas.</b> Referee Arthur Mercante, Jr. offered a stern warning to Cotto. In the third round, Judah took yet another low blow from Cotto, which {{resulted}} in Cotto receiving a point deduction.|$|E
5|$|Silva re-opened {{the action}} {{standing}} {{with a combination}} of punches and kicks. Jackson answered with a straight right hand, knocking Silva on <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>canvas.</b> Jackson followed Silva down and looked to finish the fight in Silva's closed guard. Jackson moved into side control shortly after and landed a clean knee strike to Silva's head followed by several punches, again to the head to end the round.|$|E
5|$|At 3:21 of the 1st round, after Wanderlei flurried {{and missed}} a punch {{with his right}} hand, Jackson countered with a left hook on Silva's jaw, sending the latter on <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>canvas</b> and {{rendering}} him unconscious. Jackson followed with three punches to Silva's head on the ground, two of which occurred after referee Yves Lavigne attempted to halt the contest. Wanderlei remained on the canvas for several moments, but appeared to be OK {{as he left the}} cage under his own power.|$|E
50|$|In {{traditional}} {{oil painting}} as {{practiced by the}} Renaissance painter, skin glue was used <b>to</b> coat <b>the</b> <b>canvas.</b> This is necessary because the linseed oil that forms the base of most oil paint contains linolenic acid that will destroy <b>the</b> <b>canvas</b> fibers over time. Though this did help <b>to</b> seal <b>the</b> <b>canvas,</b> they still had to cover it with another layer of a substance similar to paint in order <b>to</b> protect it. <b>The</b> primary purpose of Rabbit-skin glue is <b>to</b> stretch <b>the</b> <b>canvas.</b>|$|R

5|$|On April 10, 2004, at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino in Las Vegas, Judah fought Cory Spinks for the Undisputed Welterweight Championship. Judah {{had trouble}} {{at the start}} {{figuring}} out how to fight Spinks, the taller fighter. He could not move forward to get inside, but was having success moving laterally. Spinks scored a knockdown in the eleventh round, but Judah came back and put Spinks down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>canvas</b> in the final round. In the end, Spinks defeated Judah by unanimous decision with scores of 114–112 twice and 116–111.|$|E
5|$|On January 13, 2001, Judah {{defeated}} Reggie Green by tenth-round technical knockout at the Mohegan Sun in Connecticut. Judah {{had trouble}} landing punches effectively against Green {{for the majority}} of the fight, but in round ten, he knocked Green down with a left hook. Green beat the count, but Judah then ran across the ring and sent Green down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>canvas</b> with a right hand, forcing the referee to stop the fight.|$|E
5|$|On June 23, 2001, Judah {{defeated}} Allan Vester by third-round knockout in {{his fifth}} successful {{defense of the}} IBF title. In round two, Judah put Vester down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>canvas</b> twice. In the third round, Judah knocked out Vester with a left hand that connected on Vester's temple. Vester went {{down on his knees}} and nearly lost his mouthpiece. The referee stopped the fight right before the closing bell. The fight would set up a unification match between Judah and WBC and WBA Light Welterweight Champion Kostya Tszyu, who defeated Oktay Urkal on the undercard.|$|E

50|$|In 1603-1604 the {{painting}} was acquired by emperor Rudolf II together with Parmigianino's Cupid Making His Arch, and sent <b>to</b> Prague. <b>The</b> <b>canvas</b> was in Vienna since {{as early as the}} 1610s, when it is mentioned in the Habsburg imperial collections together with Io.|$|R
5|$|With 10seconds {{left to go}} {{in round}} two, Tszyu landed a right hand clean on Judah's chin and he backed away from Tszyu with his hands down. Tszyu went after Judah, {{throwing}} another right hand that landed on his chin and sent Judah crashing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>canvas.</b> Judah jumped up instinctively and tried to signal that he was fine to referee Jay Nady, but was still dazed by the punch and fell down a second time. When Judah collapsed, Nady waved the fight over, resulting in a technical knockout victory for Tsyzu and Judah's first professional loss.|$|E
5|$|Cotto and Judah {{delivered}} an all-action brawl, {{but after}} weathering some difficult early rounds as he figured out Judah's southpaw style and adjusted to his speed, Cotto {{took over the}} bout. In round seven, both fighters went toe-to-toe and in round eight he hurt Judah several times. In round nine, Judah took a knee to gain a breather from Cotto's aggressive style. By the tenth round, Judah was bleeding from a cut over his right eye and was hurt by an uppercut from Cotto that sent him retreating to the ropes, but Judah stayed upright. Early in the eleventh round, Cotto landed a combination that dropped Judah <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>canvas.</b> He managed {{to get to his}} feet, but Cotto went after Judah with a relentless attack, turning him sideways along the ropes as he continued to throw punches. That forced the referee to stop the fight.|$|E
5|$|The battle {{began as}} a {{long-range}} gunnery duel, during which the Russian ships hit the Japanese ships numerous times and forced Tōgō to temporarily disengage. Over two hours {{after the start of}} the battle, the Japanese fleet closed the range and started shooting again at 17:35. Forty minutes later a shell struck Retzivans forward turret near the gun ports, killing one turret crewman and wounding six others from the blast pressure. The impact knocked one 12-inch shell off its loading tray, crushing two other sailors and also setting fire <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>canvas</b> covering the gun ports. Fearing that the fire might spread, the surviving crewmen flooded the turret, knocking out its electrical system. The crew was able to get the turret partially functional within an hour.|$|E

50|$|Instead of {{painting}} <b>the</b> <b>canvas</b> with a brush, Noland’s style was <b>to</b> stain <b>the</b> <b>canvas</b> with color. This idea sought <b>to</b> remove <b>the</b> artist through brushstrokes. This made the piece about the art, not the artist. He emphasized spatial relationships {{in his work}} by leaving unstained, bare canvas as a contrast against the colors used throughout his paintings. Noland used simplified abstraction so the design would not detract {{from the use of}} color.|$|R
50|$|As <b>the</b> <b>canvas</b> rotates, {{centrifugal}} forces draw the wet paint outwards, creating intricate designs. The artist can drip more paint onto <b>the</b> <b>canvas</b> {{while it is}} spinning, thus layering paints {{on top of each}} other, creating different effects. Using different colors, a skilled spin artist can blend colors together into subtle designs. At any point during this process, the artist can stop <b>the</b> spinning platform <b>to</b> view <b>the</b> <b>canvas.</b> Since <b>the</b> <b>canvas</b> is usually rotating at a high rate, it is difficult if not impossible <b>to</b> view <b>the</b> image on <b>the</b> <b>canvas</b> until <b>the</b> platform has stopped spinning, thus creating a sense of surprise and uncertainty during the creation process.|$|R
5|$|On July 26, 2008, at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, Cotto {{suffered}} {{his first}} loss {{as a professional}} to Antonio Margarito in an unsuccessful title defense. Cotto had taken the early initiative, frequently landing a series of punches on Margarito during the early rounds while using his footwork to avoid danger. However, Margarito presented constant offensive pressure of Cotto and eventually began to wear down Cotto's resistance by trapping him against the ropes. Cotto was hurt in the seventh round after a pair of Margarito uppercuts caused his nose to bleed. Margarito continued to chase his opponent down and inflicted further damage {{towards the end of}} the tenth round. Margarito then threw a series of punches at the start of the eleventh round, with Cotto against the ropes and bleeding profusely. A combination from Margarito finally forced Cotto to his knee. He got up, but Margarito continued landing combinations. Evangelista Cotto threw in the towel after Cotto again fell <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>canvas</b> in the corner of the ring. Two judges had Margarito ahead by a score of 96–94 at the time of the stoppage, while the third scored the fight even. HBO analyst Harold Lederman had also scored the fight even. Cotto's loss to Margarito has since come under suspicion due to Margarito's subsequent attempted use of illegal hand-wraps in a fight against Shane Mosley.|$|E
5|$|Dyer was {{a popular}} choice with boxing promoters, helped {{by the fact that}} after each bout he would sing Thora, a popular hit of the day to the audience. His careers as a pugilist and {{baritone}} earned him the nickname, 'The Singing Boxer'. His first few bouts were all held in south Wales, but by the autumn of 1910 he was travelling to England to fight, and on 10 October 1910 he was invited to fight at the National Sporting Club in Covent Garden, London. On 15 May 1911 Dyer was scheduled to fight Dick Emden at The Ring in Blackfriars, London. To date, Dyer had recorded over 15 bouts and was unbeaten but the fight with Emden ended in defeat and affected his future boxing career. Dyer was easily ahead in the bout, when in the fifth round he dislocated his knee and fell <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>canvas</b> in agony. Emden, who taunted the fallen Dyer, was given the victory and Dyer would not fight for another six months. The injury to his right knee plagued Dyer throughout his entire boxing career, and also stopped him serving in the armed forces during the First World War. After the injury, Dyer always fought with a protector strapped around his knee, and was forced to change his fighting style. He would always stand on the toes of his right foot, as a quick back step could possibly dislocate his knee again. His return bout in November 1911 was a win against Young Lilley at The Ring, but this was again followed by a long absence. Dyer did not fight again until 1 June 1912.|$|E

25|$|After winning two minor bouts in Germany and enlisting the {{services}} of legendary boxing trainer Emanuel Steward, Klitschko again fought for the vacated WBO title on 10 April 2004, in Las Vegas, against Lamon Brewster. Klitschko sent Brewster <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>canvas</b> in the fourth round; however, things turned around in the fifth when Brewster's punches began backing him up. Not defending himself and leaning into ropes for support, Klitschko took a standing eight count. On unsteady legs, Klitschko fell <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>canvas</b> after the bell and the referee stopped the fight for his safety.|$|E
