40|$|OBJECTIVES: This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to test the}} effectiveness of <b>the</b> Stanford <b>Nutrition</b> Action Program, an experimental trial to reduce dietary fat intake among low-literacy, low-income adults. METHODS: Twenty-four paired adult education classes (351 participants, 85 % women, mean age = 31 years) {{were randomly assigned to}} receive a newly developed dietary fat curriculum (<b>the</b> Stanford <b>Nutrition</b> Action Program) or an existing general nutrition curriculum. Food frequency and nutrition-related data, body mass index, and capillary blood cholesterol were collected at baseline and at two postintervention follow-ups. RESULTS: <b>The</b> Stanford <b>Nutrition</b> Action Program classes showed significantly greater net improvements in nutrition knowledge (+ 7. 7), attitudes (/ 0. 2), and self-efficacy (- 0. 2) than <b>the</b> general <b>nutrition</b> classes; they also showed significantly greater reductions in the percentage of calories from total (- 2. 3 %) and saturated (- 0. 9 %) fat. There {{were no significant differences in}} body mass index or blood cholesterol. All positive intervention effects were maintained for 3 months postintervention. CONCLUSIONS: <b>The</b> Stanford <b>Nutrition</b> Action Program curriculum, tailored to the cultural, economic, and learning needs of low-literacy, low-income adults, was significantly more effective in achieving fat-related nutritional changes than <b>the</b> general <b>nutrition</b> curriculum...|$|R
5|$|The vegetal diet of the Sumatran {{rhinoceros}} is high {{in fiber}} and only moderate in protein. Salt licks {{are very important to}} <b>the</b> <b>nutrition</b> of the rhino. These licks can be small hot springs, seepages of salty water, or mud-volcanoes. The salt licks also serve an important social purpose for the rhinos—males visit the licks to pick up the scent of females in oestrus. Some Sumatran rhinos, however, live in areas where salt licks are not readily available, or the rhinos have not been observed using the licks. These rhinos may get their necessary mineral requirements by consuming plants rich in minerals.|$|E

5|$|The larvae grow {{through a}} series of four or five moults and enter the pupal stage. The pupa has the {{appendages}} free and not fused to the body as in a butterfly pupa. The differentiation into queens and workers (which are both female), and different castes of workers, is influenced in some species by <b>the</b> <b>nutrition</b> the larvae obtain. Genetic influences and the control of gene expression by the developmental environment are complex and the determination of caste continues to be a subject of research. Winged male ants, called drones, emerge from pupae along with the usually winged breeding females. Some species, such as army ants, have wingless queens. Larvae and pupae need to be kept at fairly constant temperatures to ensure proper development, and so often, are moved around among the various brood chambers within the colony.|$|E

40|$|At present, {{industries}} {{within the}} health and life science sector are moving towards one another resulting in new industries such as <b>the</b> medical <b>nutrition</b> industry. Medical nutrition products are specific nutritional compositions for intervention in disease progression and symptom alleviation. Industry convergence, described as the blurring of boundaries between industries, {{plays a crucial role}} in the shaping of new markets and industries. Assuming that <b>the</b> medical <b>nutrition</b> industry has emerged from the convergence between the food and pharma industries, it is crucial to research how and which distinct industry domains have contributed to establish this relatively new industry. The first two stages of industry convergence (knowledge diffusion and consolidation) are measured by means of patent analysis. First, the extent of knowledge diffusion within <b>the</b> medical <b>nutrition</b> industry is graphed in a patent citation interrelations network. Subsequently the consolidation based on technological convergence is determined by means of patent co-classification. Furthermore, <b>the</b> medical <b>nutrition</b> core domain and technology interrelations are measured by means of a cross impact analysis. This study proves that <b>the</b> medical <b>nutrition</b> industry is a result of food and pharma convergence. It is therefore crucial for medical nutrition companies to effectively monitor technological developments within as well as across industry boundaries. This study further reveals that although <b>the</b> medical <b>nutrition</b> industry’s core technology domain is food, technological development is mainly driven by pharmaceutical/pharmacological technologies Additionally, the result...|$|R
