5|$|From {{the start}} of 2010 to November 2014, 43 {{hospitals}} in rural areas closed. Critics claimed that the new law caused these hospitals to close. Many of these rural hospitals were built using funds from the 1946 Hill–Burton Act, to increase access <b>to</b> <b>medical</b> <b>care</b> in rural areas. Some of these hospitals reopened as other medical facilities, but {{only a small number}} operated emergency rooms (ER) or urgent care centers.|$|E
5|$|Rats {{that live}} {{their entire lives}} indoors usually are able to avoid disease-causing {{bacteria}} such as Salmonella and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; the latter is absent in treated water. They may also more easily avoid vectors like cockroaches, beetles, and fleas which are essential for the spread of endemic typhus and intestinal parasites like the Rat tapeworm. Additionally, pet or laboratory rats enjoy the intrinsic benefits of having a consistent and well-balanced diet, along with access <b>to</b> <b>medical</b> <b>care.</b>|$|E
5|$|Medical centers, dispensaries and {{hospitals}} are {{found throughout the}} island, although they are concentrated in urban areas and particularly in Antananarivo. Access <b>to</b> <b>medical</b> <b>care</b> remains {{beyond the reach of}} many Malagasy, especially in the rural areas, and many recourse to traditional healers. In addition to the high expense of medical care relative to the average Malagasy income, the prevalence of trained medical professionals remains extremely low. In 2010 Madagascar had an average of three hospital beds per 10,000people and a total of 3,150doctors, 5,661nurses, 385community health workers, 175pharmacists and 57dentists for a population of 22million. 14.6percent of government spending in 2008 was directed toward the health sector. Approximately 70percent of spending on health was contributed by the government, while 30percent originated with international donors and other private sources. The government provides at least one basic health center per commune. Private health centers are concentrated within urban areas and particularly those of the central highlands.|$|E

25|$|Economic {{circumstances}} {{also affect}} life expectancy. For example, in the United Kingdom, life expectancy in the wealthiest and richest areas is several years {{higher than in}} the poorest areas. This may reflect factors such as diet and lifestyle, as well as access <b>to</b> <b>medical</b> <b>care.</b> It may also reflect a selective effect: people with chronic life-threatening illnesses are less likely to become wealthy or to reside in affluent areas. In Glasgow, the disparity is amongst the highest in the world: life expectancy for males in the heavily deprived Calton area stands at 54, which is 28 years less than in the affluent area of Lenzie, which is only 8km away.|$|E
