Due to this status of ownership, property held as <b>tenants</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>entireties</b> is generally exempt or {{not subject to}} the claims of the creditors of one of the spouses in Florida. This common law exemption is generally applicable to real property as well as personal property, but must be relied upon with caution as {{it may be difficult to}} prove that the property is actually held as <b>tenants</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>entireties,</b> especially as to personal property, and as the application of this exemption various among different bankruptcy judges.|$|R
5000|$|Tenancy <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Entirety</b> (United States): [...] "TBE" [...] is a {{separate}} property system in which spouses are treated as one person, each having an equal ownership {{interest in the subject}} property. In some U.S. states, tenancy <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>entirety</b> is limited to realty (e.g. the couple take title to the family home as <b>tenants</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>entirety)</b> while other states make it available for both realty and personalty (e.g. the couple can also take title to the family automobile as <b>tenants</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>entirety).</b>|$|R

50|$|The four unities is {{a concept}} in the common law of real {{property}} describing conditions that must exist in order for certain kinds of property interests to be created. Specifically, these four unities must be met in order for two or more people to own property as joint tenants with right of survivorship, or for a married couple to own property as <b>tenants</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>entirety.</b> Some jurisdictions may require additional unities.|$|R
50|$|Property may {{be owned}} {{by more than one}} person either as joint tenants, tenants in common, and in some states <b>tenants</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>entirety.</b> <b>The</b> choice of which tenancy to enter into is made <b>by</b> <b>the</b> parties at the time of purchase. With each type of tenancy, each owner has the right to occupy the whole. That means that an owner is not allowed to {{designate}} certain rooms as their own and so on. Each element of the property is enjoyed fully by all parties.|$|R
5000|$|A tenancy <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>entirety</b> (sometimes {{called a}} tenancy <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>entireties)</b> {{is a type}} of {{concurrent}} estate formerly available only to married couples, where ownership of property is treated as though the couple were a single legal person. (In the State of Hawaii, <b>the</b> option of <b>Tenants</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Entirety</b> ownership is also available to domestic partners in a registered [...] "Reciprocal Beneficiary Relationship"; Vermont's Civil Union statute qualifies parties to a civil union for tenancy <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>entirety.)</b> Like a Joint Tenancy with Rights of Survivorship, <b>the</b> tenancy <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>entirety</b> also encompasses a right of survivorship, so if one spouse dies, the entire interest in the property is said to [...] "ripen" [...] in the survivor so that sole control of the property ripens, or passes in the ordinary sense, to the surviving spouse without going through probate.|$|R
5000|$|In some jurisdictions, {{to create}} a tenancy <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>entirety</b> <b>the</b> parties must specify in the deed that the {{property}} is being conveyed to the couple [...] "as <b>tenants</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> entirety," [...] while in others, a conveyance to a married couple is presumed {{to create a}} tenancy <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>entirety</b> unless <b>the</b> deed specifies otherwise. (see also Sociedad de gananciales) Also, besides sharing the four unities necessary to create a joint tenancy with right of survivorship time, title, interest, and possession there must also be the fifth unity of marriage. However, unlike a JTWROS, neither party in a tenancy <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>entirety</b> has a unilateral right to sever the tenancy. The termination of the tenancy or any dealing with {{any part of the}} property requires the consent of both spouses. A divorce breaks the unity of marriage, leaving the default tenancy, which may be a tenancy in common in equal shares. Many US jurisdictions no longer recognize tenancies <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>entirety.</b> [...] Where it is recognized, benefits can include the ability to shield the property from creditors of only one spouse, as well as the ability to partially shield the property where only one spouse is filing a petition for bankruptcy relief. If a non-debtor spouse in a tenancy <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>entirety</b> survives a debtor spouse, the lien can never be enforced against the property. On the other hand, if a debtor spouse survives a non-debtor spouse, the lien may be enforced against the whole property, not merely the debtor spouse's original half-interest.|$|R
5000|$|Unity of {{marriage}} : In order {{for there to}} be a tenancy <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>entirety</b> this fifth unity must be present. Marriage combined with the preceding four unities creates a tenancy <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>entirety.</b> A tenancy <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>entirety</b> gives rise to certain legal rights, such as rights of survivors, when one spouse is deceased that interest automatically passes to the surviving spouse.|$|R
50|$|In many states, tenancy <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>entireties</b> is {{recognized}} as a valid form of ownership for bank accounts and financial assets. One must be careful to ensure that <b>the</b> tenancy <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>entireties</b> designation is chosen as opposed {{to other forms of}} joint ownership such as joint tenancy with rights of survivorship, so that the benefits of tenancy <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>entireties</b> status is not lost. For example, under Florida law, if a bank account titling document allows for tenancy <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>entireties</b> and joint tenancy with rights of survivorship, if the account is opened as a joint tenancy with rights of survivorship account, the benefits of tenancy by entireties will not attach.|$|R
50|$|A special type {{of joint}} account with right of {{survivorship}}, called a tenancy <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>entireties</b> account, {{is used for}} survivorship accounts between spouses. This special type of tenancy <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>entireties</b> account will typically offer the account holders protection from creditors under applicable state law.|$|R

40|$|The law {{fails to}} {{accommodate}} the inconvenient fact that an individual’s identifiable genetic information is involuntarily and immutably shared with her close genetic relatives. Legal institutions have established that individuals have a cognizable interest in controlling genetic information that is identifying to them. The Supreme Court recognized in Maryland v. King that the Fourth Amendment is implicated when arrestees’ DNA is analyzed, and the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act protects individuals from genetic discrimination in the employment and health-insurance markets. But genetic information is not like other forms of private or personal information because it is shared — immutably and involuntarily — {{in ways that are}} identifying of both the source and that person’s close genetic relatives. Standard approaches to addressing interests in genetic information have largely failed to recognize this characteristic, treating such information as individualistic. While many legal frames may be brought to bear on this problem, this Article focuses on the law of property. Specifically, looking to the law of tenancy <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>entirety,</b> this Article proposes one possible framework for grappling with the overlapping interests implicated in genetic identification and analysis. Tenancy <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>entirety,</b> like interests in shared identifiable genetic information, calls for the difficult task of conceptualizing two persons as one. The law of tenancy <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>entirety</b> thus provides a useful analytical framework for considering how legal institutions might take interests in shared identifiable genetic information into account. This Article examines how this framework may shape policy approaches in three domains: forensic identification, genetic research, and personal genetic testing. In some of these domains, experts are already advocating for policies consistent with this framework...|$|R
