Spin magazine's Josh Kun wrote that Aguilera suggested Eminem [...] "Must <b>talk</b> <b>so</b> big / To make up for smaller things". According to Kelefa Sanneh writing for The New York Times, Aguilera referred to Eminem in the lyrics [...] "It's sad you only get your fame through controversy".|$|E
500|$|In 2009, Fallout {{designer}} Chris Taylor {{said they}} [...] "never expected that Dogmeat would {{become such a}} popular character." [...] Taylor said: [...] "I always intended that the various NPCs that joined up with the player would come to a violent end. I was shocked when I heard of all the work people went through to keep Dogmeat alive to the end – especially the hell that they went through with the force fields in the Military Base." [...] According to Fallout 2 and Fallout: New Vegas designer Chris Avellone, Dogmeat is [...] "arguably the most successful NPC companion ever" [...] for several reasons: [...] "One, he doesn't <b>talk,</b> <b>so</b> the players can project a personality on to him. Two, he's effective in combat ... and three, he's a dog that stays with you through thick-and-thin. I don't think there's a deeper 'awww' sentiment than people have in their hearts for their pets." ...|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mostly positive reviews from television critics. The {{authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote: [...] "Marge's mother Jackie is particularly nightmarish in her first real appearance. The final sequence on the rooftop with Lisa and Bart is lovely, and Homer's comment to Marge is a magical wrap-up to a good episode." [...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson said the episode [...] "maintained a nicely irreverent tone most of the time— irreverent {{enough to make it}} amusing, at least," [...] and added: [...] "The interaction of the Simpson and Bouvier families at dinner was terrific, and Bart’s experiences on skid row made their point while they still managed to be pointed and clever. 'Bart vs. Thanksgiving' was another winner." [...] Bryce Wilson of Cinema Blend said [...] "Bart vs. Thanksgiving" [...] and [...] "Lisa's Substitute", another season two episode, were the first episodes that [...] "asked [...] to truly care about the characters, and they work beautifully." [...] Both Dawn Taylor of The DVD Journal and Jacobson thought the most memorable line of the episode was Jackie's line to Marge: [...] "I have laryngitis and it hurts to <b>talk,</b> <b>so</b> I'll just say one thing— you never do anything right." [...] A reviewer for DVD.net, on the other hand, thought the best line was Homer's [...] "Oh Lord, be honest– are we the most pathetic family in the universe, or what?".|$|E

2500|$|In his autobiography, , Dylan {{describes}} first encountering Grossman at the Gaslight cafe: [...] "He {{looked like}} Sydney Greenstreet {{from the film}} The Maltese Falcon, had an enormous presence, always dressed in a conventional suit and tie, and he sat at his corner table.

Cowell warns him to not [...] "become the mean judge, like I did", since he himself does not have many friends. He tries to be more positive, but Cowell mocks his judgment of a contestant, he realizes that Cowell tricked him; angered, Moe threatens Cowell's life on air, but is apprehended by security and expelled from the building.|$|E
2500|$|Whether some {{qualities are}} virtues or vices depends on circumstance: [...] "The benevolence and open-handed {{generosity}} which adorn a rich man, {{may make a}} pauper of a poor one; the energy and courage to which the successful soldier owes his rise, the cool and daring subtlety to which the great financier owes his fortune, may very easily, under unfavorable conditions, lead their possessors to the gallows, or to the hulks. Moreover, it is fairly probable that the children of a [...] "failure" [...] will receive from their other parent just that little modification of character which makes all the difference. I sometimes wonder whether people, who <b>talk</b> <b>so</b> freely about extirpating the unfit, ever dispassionately consider their own history. Surely, one must be very [...] "fit," [...] indeed, not to know of an occasion, or perhaps two, in one's life, when {{it would have been}} only too easy to qualify for a place among the [...] "unfit."" ...|$|E

2500|$|Brigham Young {{denied that}} the Danites {{continued}} to exist. [...] However, on July 5, 1857, just {{before the start of}} the Utah War, Young used language similar to the fiery sermons that preceded the 1838 Mormon War. In the address Young demanded military action against former Mormon persecutors, mobocrats, and the [...] "priests, editors, and politicians" [...] who were then denouncing the Mormons. Young declared that if these provocateurs came to the Utah Territory, the Mormons would [...] "deal" [...] with them. [...] He stated that anyone who entered the territory and didn't [...] "behave themselves," [...] including any Mormon who [...] "unlawfully disturbs anyone," [...] would [...] "find a 'Vigilance Committee.'" [...] This was most likely a reference to the famous San Francisco Vigilance Committee of 1856, an organization that one writer called [...] "the largest and most influential vigilante group in American history." [...] Young also declared that any such men would find [...] "not only the Danites, whom they <b>talk</b> <b>so</b> much about, biting the horses (sic) heels, but the scoundrels will find something biting 'their' heels." ...|$|E
2500|$|Throughout {{his radio}} career, he {{performed}} entirely without scripts. His friend and WOR colleague Barry Farber marveled at {{how he could}} <b>talk</b> <b>so</b> long with very little written down. Yet during a radio interview, Shepherd once claimed that some shows took several weeks to prepare, but this {{would probably have been}} in the thinking and outlining stage rather than in anything like a script. On most of his Fourth of July broadcasts, however, he would read one of his most enduring and popular short stories, [...] "Ludlow Kissel and the Dago Bomb that Struck Back," [...] about a neighborhood drunk and his disastrous fireworks escapades. In the 1960s and 1970s, his WOR show ran from 11:15pm to midnight, later changed to 10:15pm to 11pm, so his [...] "Ludlow Kissel" [...] reading was coincidentally timed to many New Jersey and New York local town fireworks displays, which would traditionally reach their climax at 10pm. It was possible, on one of those July 4 nights, to park one's car on a hilltop and watch several different pyrotechnic displays, accompanied by Shepherd's masterful storytelling.|$|E

They follow his traces to a {{cemetery}} crypt, where Jasmine is devastated to find the scarab, believing Aladdin had died and Emma worried about her fate. When Emma and Henry have a conversation about what the future holds for them, Aladdin appears out of hiding, admitting that he used the scarab to throw them off, but heard them <b>talk</b> <b>so</b> he changed his mind. Aladdin explains that he ended up using the shears that ultimately doomed Agrabah. He gives the shears to Emma, letting her choose if she wants to use them someday. Emma and Henry then convince Aladdin to go back to Jasmine, but the reunion is cut short when Jasmine explains that she needs his help to defend Agrabah again, only to have Aladdin try to explain his reason why he might not. As for the fate shears, Emma gives them to Hook, who plans to bury them [...] "20,000 Leagues under the sea." [...] Unfortunately, after Emma kissed him as she is about to order dinner, Hook lied to her as he kept the fate shears inside his jacket.|$|E
