40|$|Aim: Small mammals were live-trapped in {{a primary}} rain forest to {{evaluate}} the relative distribution of species {{to each other and}} to microhabitat properties on the ground and in the canopy. Location: Kinabalu National Park in Borneo, Sabah, Malaysia. Methods: Seven trapping sessions were conducted along two grids with 31 trap points at distances of 20 m on the ground and in the lower canopy at an average height of 13. 5 m. Results: Species diversity and abundance of small mammals proved to be high: 20 species of the families Muridae, Sciuridae, Tupaiidae, Hystricidae, Viverridae and Lorisidae were trapped, with murids being dominant in both habitat layers. The <b>terrestrial</b> <b>community</b> was significantly more diverse with 16 captured species (Shannon-Wiener's diversity index H 0 terr 1 / 4 2. 47), while 11 species were trapped in the canopy (H 0 arb 1 / 4 1. 59). The Whitehead's rat, Maxomys whiteheadi, and the red spiny rat, Maxomys surifer, dominated the <b>terrestrial</b> <b>community</b> whereas the large pencil-tailed tree mouse, Chiropodomys major, was by far the most abundant species in the canopy. Other abundant species of the canopy community, the dark-tailed tree rat, Niviventer cremoriventer, and the lesser treeshrew, Tupaia minor, were also abundant on the ground, and there was no clear boundary between arboreal and terrestrial species occurrences. Main conclusions: As most species were not confined to specific microhabitats or habitat layers, species seemed to rely on resources not necessarily restricted to certain microhabitats or habitat layers, and separation of species probably resulted mainly from a species' concentrated activity in a preferred microhabitat rather than from principal adaptations to certain habitats. Ecological segregation was stronger in the more diverse <b>terrestrial</b> <b>community,</b> though microhabitat selection was generally not sufficient to explain the co-occurrences of species and the variability between local species assemblages. Constraints on small mammal foraging efficiency in the three-dimensional more complex canopy may be responsible for the similarity of microhabitat use of all common arboreal species. Community composition was characterized by mobile species with low persistence rates, resulting in a high degree of variability in local species assemblages with similar turnover rates in both habitats.

40|$|Climate change, land-use change, {{pollution}} and exploitation {{are among the}} main drivers of species’ population trends; however, their relative importance is much debated. We used a unique collection of over 1, 000 local population time series in 22 <b>communities</b> across <b>terrestrial,</b> freshwater and marine realms within central Europe to compare the impacts of long-term temperature change and other environmental drivers from 1980 onwards. To disentangle different drivers, we related species’ population trends to species- and driver-specific attributes, such as temperature and habitat preference or pollution tolerance. We found a consistent impact of temperature change on the local abundances of terrestrial species. Populations of warm-dwelling species increased more than those of cold-dwelling species. In contrast, impacts of temperature change on aquatic species’ abundances were variable. Effects of temperature preference were more consistent in <b>terrestrial</b> <b>communities</b> than effects of habitat preference, suggesting that the impacts of temperature change have become widespread for recent changes in abundance within many <b>terrestrial</b> <b>communities</b> of central Europe...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1983 Vegetation {{ecology of}} eight Oregon {{freshwater}} wetlands was described and net aerial primary productivity estimated in four wetlands. Plant cover samples {{were used to}} classify 37 wetland and 11 <b>terrestrial</b> <b>communities</b> by agglomerative hierarchical clustering. Samples and species were ordinated. Direct measurements were made of sample relative elevation, inundation duration, and soil saturation. Within- (alpha) and between- (beta) diversities were determined for communities. Alpha diversity was correlated with wetland elevation/ inundation-soil saturation gradient. Three coastal zone wetlands were studied: Daley Lake, Bayocean, and Rockaway within which 12 wetland and four <b>terrestrial</b> <b>communities</b> were identified. Alpha diversity for Daley Lake and Bayocean emergent wetlands increased with increasing elevation and decreasing inundation period (mean r² = 0. 51 and 0. 53 respectively). High beta diversities within these wetlands suggests community distinctiveness. Mean productivity at Daley Lake was 2872 g/m²/yr. Three Willamette Valley wetlands were studied: Frazier- Jackson, Gray Creek, and Fern Ridge within which 14 wetland and three <b>terrestrial</b> <b>communities</b> were identified. Alpha diversity increased with decreasing inundation (mean r² = 0. 54). High beta diversity reflected community homogenity. Mean productivity for the Fern Ridge wetland was 1837 g/m ² /yr. Seven wetland communities, including two wetland community types (tall perennial and prostrate perennial), and two terrestrial assemblages were identified within the Cascade Mountains' Davis Lake site. For the total wetland system, alpha diversity increased along the elevation/inundation gradient (mean r ² = 0. 52). Beta diversity of prominent communities suggests vegetative homogenity. Mean productivity for the tall perennial wetland type was 1325 g/m²/yr and for the prostrate perennial type 207 g/m ² /yr. The Lookout Creek wetland site in the Ochoco Mountains included four wetland and two <b>terrestrial</b> <b>communities.</b> Greatest overall alpha diversity was in the moderately saturated areas. The Lookout Creek wetland communities were vegetatively distinct. Mean productivity for the Lookout Creek wetland was 889 g/m²/yr. Floristic similarities among all 37 wetland communities were analyzed. Generally, communities within the same wetland were floristically more similar to each other than to communities of other wetlands. Emergent plant communities west of the Cascade Mountains {{tended to be more}} floristically similar to one another than to those of central Oregon.

40|$|ABSTRACT: During the Triassic, free {{dispersal}} of terrestrial vertebrates was possible in Pangaea; however provinciality appeared in Gondwana. Distribution of Triassic vertebrates {{may be explained}} even if the Earth diameter did not expand and if Pacifica did not exist. During the Jurassic, a free land communication persisted between Gondwana nd Laurasia, and provinciality is not demonstrated. A Gondwanan pattern emerged uring the Cretaceous, but since that ime {{it is not possible}} to identify aglobal difference between Gondwanan faunas and Laurasian ones. An African/South American <b>terrestrial</b> <b>community</b> developed until the Aptian. Subsequently, the opening of South Atlantic hindered interchanges between these two areas, but did not end them; exchanges might have taken place then via trans-Atlantic filter, or sweepstakes, routes. For the Cretaceous/Eocene time interval, crossings of the Tethys occurred intermittently, the major event being the interchange that took place between North and South America by latest Cretaceous. By the Cretaceous/Palaeocene transition, a terrestrial route probably linked the still southern Indian Plate to Laurasia. It is uncertain whether this route reached Madagascar.

40|$|A {{historical}} view of {{the research}} and development in photovoltaics from the perspective of both the terrestrial and the space communities is presented from the early days through the ' 70 s and ' 80 s and the ' 90 s and beyond. The synergy of both communities in the beginning and once again in the present and hopefully future are highlighted, with examples of the important features in each program. The space community which was impressed by the light-weight and reliability of photovoltaics drove much of the early development. Even up to today, nearly every satellites and other scientific space probe that has been launched has included some solar power. However, since the cost of these power systems were {{only a small fraction of}} the satellite and launch cost, the use of much of this technology for the terrestrial marketplace was not feasible. It was clear that the focus of the <b>terrestrial</b> <b>community</b> would be best served by reducing costs. This would include addressing a variety of manufacturing issues and raising the rate of production. Success in these programs and a resulting globalization of effort resulted in major strides in the reduction of PV module costs and increased production. Although, the space community derived benefit from some of these advancements, its focus was on pushing the envelope with regard to cell efficiency. The gap between theoretical efficiencies and experimental efficiencies for silicon, gallium arsenide and indium phosphide became almost non-existent. Recent work by both communities have focused on the development thin film cells of amorphous silicon, CuInSe 2 and CdTe. These cells hold the promise of lower costs for the <b>terrestrial</b> <b>community</b> as well as possible flexible substrates, better radiation resistance, and higher specific power for the space community. It is predicted that future trends in both communities will be directed toward advances through the application of nanotechnology. A picture is emerging in which the space and terrestrial solar cell communities shall once again share many common goals and, in fact, companies may manufacture both space and terrestrial solar cells in III-V materials and thin film materials. Basic photovoltaics research including these current trends in nanotechnology provides a valuable service for both worlds in that fundamental understanding of cell processes is still vitally important, particularly with new materials or new cell structures. It is entirely possible that one day we might have one solar array design that will meet the criteria for success in both space and on the Earth or perhaps the Moon or Mars...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Middle Miocene mammals {{are known}} from ~ 15 million-year-old sediments exposed along the Panama Canal of Central America, {{a region that}} {{otherwise}} has an exceedingly poor terrestrial fossil record. These land mammals, which represent {{a part of the}} ancient terrestrial herbivore community, include an oreodont Merycochoerus matthewi, small camel-like protoceratid artiodactyl Paratoceras wardi, two horses Anchitherium clarencei and Archaeohippus sp., and two rhinos Menoceras barbouri and Floridaceras whitei. Bulk and serial carbon and oxygen isotope analyses of the tooth enamel carbonate allow reconstruction of the ancient climate and ecology of these fossil mammals.

The middle Miocene <b>terrestrial</b> <b>community</b> consisted predominantly, or exclusively, of C 3 plants, i. e., there is no evidence for C 4 grasses. Statistically different mean carbon isotope values for the mammalian herbivores indicate niche partitioning of the C 3 plant food resources.

40|$|During the spring, when ozone {{depletion}} at the polar regions {{is at its}} maximum and consequently the environmental UV exposure is potentially high, many <b>terrestrial</b> <b>communities</b> are covered in snow and heterogeneous snow-encrusted ice that form near the edges of snowpack. Using field measurements and a theoretical radiative transfer model, we calculated the thicknesses of these covers {{that are necessary to}} reduce DNA-weighted dose to levels equal to or lower than those received later in the season in the absence of covers when there is no {{ozone depletion}}. This depth is approximately 4 cm for a 60 % depletion of the ozone column, suggesting that even thin snow-ice covers are enough to completely cancel the biological effects of ozone depletion. Loss of snow-ice covers during early summer can be rapid. The maximum rate of retreat of snow cover measured during November at Mars Oasis, Antarctica (71. 9 degreesS, 68. 2 degreesW), was 44. 1 cm/day, with a mean retreat of 15. 4 cm/day. Climate warming might increase UV-radiation damage by melting UV-protecting terrestrial snow-ice covers earlier in the season, when ozone depletion is more severe. Conversely, climate cooling could increase UV-protection afforded to <b>terrestrial</b> <b>communities</b> by increasing the extent of snow and ice covers. Even if anthropogenic ozone depletion is eventually reversed, these data suggest the importance of climate forcing in determining UV exposures of <b>terrestrial</b> microbial <b>communities</b> in snow- and ice-covered environments...|$|R

40|$|The {{availability}} of nutrients {{in the soil}} {{is key to the}} potential response of a plant to elevated CO 2 and is central to correctly predicting the response of terrestrial communities to climate change. In order for a plant to fully realise the potential of increased atmospheric CO 2, it must increase its nutrient uptake for the increased production of biomass as well as biochemical compounds. In this study the stable isotope 15 N was used to follow the fate of nitrogen contained in litter {{in order to determine the}} effect elevated atmospheric CO 2 had on the loss of nitrogen from decomposing litter and the eventual re-use of this nitrogen. During the decomposition study, on a mass basis more 15 N was transferred from the litter despite the litter grown in elevated CO 2 initially having a lower 15 N signal. This was primarily related to a higher decomposition rate of the elevated CO 2 grown litter. Despite more nitrogen entering the below-ground community under elevated atmospheric CO 2, the additional N did not stay within the <b>terrestrial</b> <b>community</b> and was not exploited by the plants.

40|$|Two {{population}} oscillations dominate <b>terrestrial</b> <b>community</b> {{dynamics in}} northern Canada. In the boreal forest, the snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus) fluctuates in cycles with an 8 – 10 year periodicity and in tundra regions lemmings typically fluctuate in cycles with a 3 – 4 year periodicity. I review 60 {{years of research}} that has uncovered many {{of the causes of}} these population cycles, outline areas of controversy that remain and suggest key questions to address. Lemmings are keystone herbivores in tundra ecosystems because they are a key food resource for many avian and mammalian predators and are a major consumer of plant production. There remains much controversy over the role of predation, food shortage and social interactions in causing lemming cycles. Predation is well documented as a significant mortality factor limiting numbers. Food shortage is less likely to be a major limiting factor on population growth in lemmings. Social interactions might {{play a critical role in}} reducing the rate of population growth as lemming density rises. Snowshoe hares across the boreal forest are a key food for many predators and their cycles have been the subject of large-scale field experiments that have pinpointed predation as the key limiting factor causing these fluctuations. Predators kill hares directly and indirectly stress them by unsuccessful pursuits. Stress reduces the reproductive rate of female hares and is transmitted to their offspring who also suffer reduced reproductive rates. The maternal effects produced by predation risk induce a time lag in the response of hare reproductive rate to density, aiding the cyclic dynamics...|$|E
40|$|With {{the recent}} {{explosion}} of the Internet and the enormous business opportunities available to communication system providers, great interest has developed in improving the efficiency of data transfer using the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) of the Internet Protocol (IP) suite. The satellite system providers are interested in solving TCP efficiency problems associated with long delays and error-prone links. Similarly, the <b>terrestrial</b> <b>community</b> is interested in solving TCP problems over high-bandwidth links. Whereas the wireless community is interested in improving TCP performance over bandwidth constrained, error-prone links. NASA realized that solutions had already been proposed {{for most of the}} problems associated with efficient data transfer over large bandwidth-delay links (which include satellite links). The solutions are detailed in various Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Request for Comments (RFCs). Unfortunately, most of these solutions had not been tested at high-speed (155 + Mbps).

40|$|Abstract – The end-Permian mass {{extinction}} is well-known {{as the most}} severe {{mass extinction}} of the Phanerozoic. <b>Terrestrial</b> <b>communities</b> {{appear to have been}} strongly affected by the event, but the cause of the extinction remains enigmatic. Here we explore whether primary producer disruption (e. g., extinction of terrestrial plants) could have led to a collapse of end-Permian terrestrial ecosystems, using models of probabilistic trophic networks. Based on a trophic network reconstructed for the Dicynodon Assemblage Zone community of the Karoo Basin, we show that late Permian <b>terrestrial</b> <b>communities</b> were vulnerable to collapse brought about by the disruption of primary producers. However, relatively high levels of primary producer loss are needed to account for observed levels of extinction among consumers in the Dicynodon zone fauna. Depending on network parameters, we predict that a shutdown of 69 % to 87 % of primary producers would be needed to generate observed extinction levels. A disruption of this magnitude is not unreasonable, given that terrestrial floras underwent a major turnover {{at the end of the}} Permian, and our predictions can be tested by further scrutiny of floras from this time...|$|R

40|$|The {{controversy}} about a Cambrian " explosion" of morphological disparity (followed by decimation), eladogenesis and fossilization is of central importanee {{for the history}} of life. This p aper revisits the controversy (with emphasis in onychophorans, which inelude emblematic organisms such as Hallucigenia), presents new data about the Chengjiang (Cambrian of China) faunal community and compares it and Ihe Burgess Shale (Cambrian of Canada) with an ecologically similar bul modern tropical marine site where onychophorans are absent, and with a modern neo tropical terrestrial onychophoran community. B i ovolume was estimated from material collected in Costa Rica and morphometric measurements were made on enlarged images of fossils. CaJTlbrian tropical mudflats were characterized by the adaptive radiation of two contrasting groups: the vagile arthropods and the sessile poriferans. Arthropods were later replaced as the dominant benthic laxon by polychaetes. Vagility and the exoskeleton may explain the success of arthropods from the Cambrian to the modern marine and terrestrial communities, both in population and biovolume. Food ecological displacement was apparen t i n the B. Shale, but not in Chengjiang or the <b>terrestrial</b> <b>community.</b> When only hard parts were preserved, marine and terrestrial fossil deposits of tropical origin are even less representative than deposits produced by temperate taxa, Chengjiang being an exception. Nutrient limitations might explain why deposit feeding is less important in terrestrial onychophoran communities, where carnivory, scavenging and omnivory (associated with high motility and life over the substrate) became moreimportant. Fossil morphometry supports the interpretation of "lobopod animal s" as onychophorans, whose abundance in Chengjiang was equal lo their abundance in modern communities. The extinction of marine onychophorans may reflect domination of the infaunal habitat by polychaetes. We conclude tha! (1) a mature ecological community structure was generalized during the Cambrian, and even biodiversity and equitability indices were surprisingly elose lo modern values; (2) the morphological diversity and geographic distribution of onychophorans indicate a significant pre-Cambrian evolutionary history which does no! support the "explosion" hypothesis; (3) disparity among phyla was not as important as the explosion-decimation model predicIs, bu! in the case of onychophorans, disparíty wÍlhin the phylum was greater than it is today and ¡ts reduction may have been associated with migration into the sedi ment when large predators evolved. Con base en nuevos hallazgos paleontológicos hechos en el sur de China se analiza la controversia sobre la "explosión del Cámbrico" que supuestamente incluyó un gran aumento en la diversidad morfológica, con la aparición de muchos filos que posteriormente se extinguieron. Se compara las comunidades fósiles de Cheng-yiang (China) y Burgess S hale (Canadá) con una comunidad marina similar moderna (Punta Morales, Costa Rica) y con una comunidad terrestre moderna (Coronado, Costa Rica) que al igual que los dos depósitos fosilíferos incluye al filo Onychophora. Se concluye que (1) durante el Cámbrico las comunidades costeras tropicales eran similares a las modernas al punto de que incluso los índices de biodiversidad y equitabilidad eran semejantes a los actuales; (2) la diversidad morfológica y distribución geográfica de los onicóforos indican una larga historia evolutiva precámbrica que no apoya el modelo de la "explosión"; (3) las diferencias morfológicas entre filos no eran tan importantes como predice el modelo de "explosión seguida de extinción", pero en la caso de los onicóforos, la diversidad morfológica dentro del jilo era mayor en el Cámbrico que en la actualidad, y su reducción puede haber estado asociada con la migración al interior del sedimento al evolucionar depredadores de tamaño relativamente grande...|$|E

Like small isolated <b>terrestrial</b> <b>communities,</b> the reef fish communities at Christmas and Cocos Islands were found to be species poor and contained a distinct taxonomic composition with an over-representation of species with high dispersal potential. Despite low species richness, {{there was no evidence of}} density compensation, with population densities on the islands similar to species-rich neighbouring mainland assemblages. In contrast to <b>terrestrial</b> <b>communities,</b> species at the edge of their range did not have lower abundance than species at the centre of their range, and endemic species had substantially higher abundance than widespread species. Overall, the observed patterns conform to predictions from terrestrial ecological hypotheses, indicating that similar processes are important in determining species richness and community composition in marine and <b>terrestrial</b> <b>communities</b> on isolated islands. However, observed patterns in abundance did not conform to expectations from terrestrial theory, and this appears to be due to the different life histories of marine and terrestrial species. Local environmental factors can also be important in structuring reef fish communities; however, few studies have examined their role on oceanic reefs. Regression tree analysis of angelfish and butterflyfish communities revealed that large physical gradients (island location, exposure, depth, habitat complexity) are more important than small-scale biotic factors (live coral cover, algal cover and habitat diversity) in determining the community structure of reef fishes at these oceanic islands. Christmas and Cocos Islands are also situated on the Indo-Pacific biogeographic border, and in the terrestrial environment, biogeographic borders represent important areas for hybridisation. Eleven hybrid coral-reef fishes (across six families) were identified at the islands: the most recorded hybrids of any marine location. In most cases, at least one of the parent species is rare ( 0. 98) and nucleotide diversity (Christmas π...|$|R

40|$|During the spring, when ozone {{depletion}} at the polar regions {{is at its}} maximum and consequently the environmental UV exposure is potentially high, many <b>terrestrial</b> <b>communities</b> are covered in snow and heterogeneous snow-encrusted ice that form near the edges of snowpack. Using field measurements and a theoretical radiative transfer model, we calculated the thicknesses of these covers {{that are necessary to}} reduce DNA-weighted dose to levels equal to or lower than those received later in the season in the absence of covers when there is no {{ozone depletion}}.

40|$|The {{vegetation}} in {{and around}} eleven estuaries flowing into False Bay was surveyed during 1980 and 1981. Use was made of colour aerial photographs and a combination of dominance and phytosocioiogical techniques. Of the communities established, three are aquatic and four are described as emergent or wetlands. Of the <b>terrestrial</b> <b>communities,</b> five are described as fynbos and four occur on coastal sands. One community consists solely of alien plants. The communities thus classified generally compare well with those discussed by other workers in the area. However, differences due to the destruction and disturbance of the vegetation are commented upon. </p...|$|R
