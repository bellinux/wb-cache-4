In early 2007, Phil and Leo put {{together}} a small team of people to create the Web 2.0 website allowing participation membership to a social science network with video and article upload. SciVee was named by combining the words [...] "science" [...] and [...] "video". After initial development, the website began accepting its first video uploads August 1, 2007. Nineteen days after going online in a pre-alpha <b>test</b> <b>state,</b> Slashdot dubbed SciVee the “YouTube for Science.” The official alpha site launch took place September 1, 2007. Based on the feedback received from the initial boom of new members from being Slashdotted, the SciVee team made updates to the website to accommodate customer demands and launched its beta release December 3, 2007. That day, CNN and USA Today featured articles about a video created by four UC San Diego science and film students showing [...] "a typical recrystallization experiment straight out of Chemistry 101." [...] Since then, SciVee has added more features to the site including discussions, blogging, extended profiles and other community options. On August 26, 2008, SciVee launched a new postercast capability. The same day, Paul Glazowski at Mashable referred to the release as [...] "a new option for users to upload feature material {{in the form of}} “postercasts” that enable users to complement their traditional video presentations with an interactive documentation component. The synchronous delivery of these is remarkably user-friendly.". The site abruptly disappeared around the end of 2015.|$|E
5000|$|Christian starts {{working at}} the local boxing club, and whilst there, 15-year-old Ben Mitchell (Joshua Pascoe) confides {{to him that he}} is gay. Christian gives advice to the teenager, but Ben {{develops}} a crush on Christian, which he discourages. Amira returns to Walford with hers and Syed's baby, Yasmin. She promptly tells Syed that she wants him {{to be a part of}} their baby's life but bans Christian from seeing her. Syed starts to secretly see Amira and Yasmin, and Ben reports this to Christian. Christian confronts Syed and declares that Syed has to choose between him and the baby. However, he relents and gives Syed his blessing to see his child. However, Yusef Khan (Ace Bhatti) suggests to Christian that Yasmin may not be Syed's child, casting doubt in Christian's mind. Christian then asks Yusef to perform a secret paternity test on Yasmin. The results of the <b>test</b> <b>state</b> that Syed is not the father of Yasmin, and Christian reveals this to Syed and Amira. Syed is devastated, but Amira continues to claim that he is the father. Syed doubts Christian, believing that he may have falsified the test. However, it emerges that it was Yusef who falsified the paternity test. Christian feels hurt that Syed suspected him of lying, but he reluctantly agrees to let Amira and Yasmin stay with him and Syed as they have nowhere else to go. Christian is annoyed to discover that Syed is helping Amira get a home in Walford. When Christian and Ben watch a film together, they talk about Christian and Syed's relationship and Ben misreads the signals, and tries to kiss Christian. Christian is horrified and Ben runs out of the flat, seen by Zainab and Yusef. Ben later lies to Yusef that Christian touched him inappropriately, and Yusef takes Ben to tell his father, Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden). Phil confronts Christian in the pub, and Christian punches Phil when he calls him a [...] "nonce". Phil leaves but later turns up at Christian's flat, smashing it up and hitting Christian with a baseball bat. Ben is forced to tell the truth so Phil leaves. However, Christian is upset with Syed for not trusting him, and when Amira tells Christian that he will be judged by the community, Christian decides to break up with Syed and leave Walford. Christian returns to Albert Square to spend Christmas with Jane. When he sees Syed and Amira, he mocks them for behaving like a couple. Syed is determined to win Christian back and asks Amira for a divorce. Christian and Syed reunite, but Amira vows to stay around. Amira later teases Christian that he will never be invited to Masood family occasions, and he tells her that her business with Syed is a smokescreen and she really wants him back.|$|E

Charter school law {{provides}} charter schools the freedom to innovate and maintain increased autonomy as long as internal and external accountability mandates are begin met. Despite {{the growing popularity of}} charter schools, little is known about charter schools in high stakes <b>testing</b> <b>states</b> and the way they negotiate the intersection of external accountability mandates and internal school mission. This qualitative case study examines a charter school for diverse students in an urban setting. The study describes the practices teachers and the head of school engage in to fulfill the school 2 ̆ 7 s mission of preparing all students for college using a rigorous curriculum integrated with an intensive service-learning component;Charter School Accountability Theory provided the framework for data collection, observations, finding, and implications. Findings indicate that charter schools in high stakes <b>testing</b> <b>states</b> negotiate the intersection of internal and external accountability mandates by utilizing state standards as a foundation for school curriculum. Charter school stakeholders must choose innovations that are compatible with external accountability mandates, and autonomy exists in the ways schools negotiate the best path to meeting the mandates. Charter school autonomy is constrained by external mandates, especially in high stakes <b>testing</b> <b>states.</b> Developing internal accountability is a challenge for charter schools as external mandates are already in place, and alignment with them is necessary for charter schools, especially those in high stakes <b>testing</b> <b>states...</b>|$|R

To protect these individuals, state laws provide for court appointment of guardians, who may be professionals or family members, to protect the incapacitated person's personal and/or financial welfare. State and local courts are responsible for overseeing guardians. In addition, federal agencies may appoint a representative payee, in some cases, the guardian, to manage federal benefits on behalf of incapacitated adults. Previous GAO reports have found that poor communication between state courts and federal agencies may allow guardians to continue abusing their victims. GAO was asked to (1) verify whether allegations of abuse by guardians are widespread; (2) examine the facts in selected closed cases; and (3) proactively <b>test</b> <b>state</b> guardian certification processes. To verify whether allegations are widespread, GAO interviewed advocates for seniors and reviewed court documents.
