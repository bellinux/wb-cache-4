Hot {{work tool}} steels {{generally}} consist of the tempered martensitic structure {{and they are}} high strength materials using all strengthening mechanisms, such as strain strengthening, grain refinement strengthening, solid solution strengthening and precipitation strengthening. It is necessary to use the grain refinement strengthening that can bring both higher {{strength at high temperature}} and toughness than those of conventional steels. In this study, hot work tool steels with ultra-fine grained structure were fabricated by the mechanical alloying treatment. The powder mixture of atomized AISI H 13 steel powders and Y 2 O 3 powders was mechanically alloyed by a planetary ball mill for 360 ks. The mechanically alloyed powders were packed in a stainless steel tube in a vacuum and then consolidated by hot rolling for full densification. The consolidated material was austenitized at 1293 K, which was general austenitizing temperature of H 13 steel, and then oil-quenched. Through this process, an ultra-fine grained H 13 steel with equiaxed grains of about 0. 3 microns in diameter could be obtained.

Furthermore, although <b>tempered</b> <b>hardness</b> of the M 2 steel decreases with increasing tempering temperature of 848 K or higher, that of the developed steel does not decrease so much.

50|$|Tempering - as {{mentioned}} above, steel can be hardened. When heated to red-hot, the iron and carbon {{in the steel}} arrange themselves into a lattice network. When quickly quenched, the lattice is frozen in place and forms a rigid structure; the more carbon, the greater the rigidity. When quenched, the steel is {{as hard as it}} will become. The harder the steel, the more brittle it is. A file is absolutely hard. It will cut lots of mild steel because it is so much harder - but put a file in a vise and hit it with a hammer and the file will readily snap in half. Same with a drill bit, cock the drill and the bit will easily snap. Tempering is a process of controlled heating of hardened steel that will relax the lattice within the iron and carbon, thereby softening the steel. The higher the temperature, the softer the steel becomes. A chisel for steel is tempered at a high temperature - softened enough so it won't snap, but still harder than the steel it will cut. A clean piece of steel will turn a very specific color based on the temperature to which it is raised. Heat one end of a piece of steel in a fire and you can easily see bands of color move up the steel coincidental with the heat migrating up the piece. It begins as a very light yellow, turns to a darker straw color, through red and on to purple. Blacksmiths have always used these colors to identify the temperature of the steel and thus control the <b>temper</b> (<b>hardness)</b> of the work piece. Spring steel is often a pretty bluish-purple color - because it's tempered to 750* and that's the associated color - soft enough to bend, but hard enough to retain “memory” and spring back to its original shape.|$|R

40|$|Martensitic and {{bainitic}} steels are {{two types}} of widely used steels with excellent mechanical behaviors in automatic industry. It’s universally acknowledged that as- quenched martensite possesses poor ductility and impact toughness, which should be tempered before putting into application. During tempering, as-quenched martensite changes from a hard and brittle microstructure to more ductile and softer microstructure, leading to improved mechanical properties for manufacturing. Bainitic microstructures is less sensitive to tempering in the improvement of mechanical properties, while the explicit tempering effects are still unknown. The primary goal of the current research is to study the effect of tempering on the microstructure and properties of martensitic and bainitic microstructures developed in the same low carbon steel with high content of silicon and manganese (0. 2 wt. %C- 2 wt. %Si- 3 wt. %Mn). Results show that for <b>tempered</b> martensite, the <b>hardness,</b> yield strength and tensile strength have a decreasing tendency with higher tempering temperatures. Through tempering, martensite became more ductile at the expense of strength. Based on the literatures, transitional carbide precipitation is expected to take place instead of cementite at early stage of tempering due to the retarding effect of high silicon content. Investigations also show that bainite is less sensitive to tempering compared to martensite.
