50|$|The binding may {{be traced}} to 18th century Germany. The {{originator}} of the binding is uncertain, but the name comes from a French binder working in Germany, Alexis-Pierre Bradel (also known as Bradel l'ainé or Bradel-Derome). The binding originally appeared as a <b>temporary</b> <b>binding,</b> but the results were durable, and the binding had great success in the nineteenth century.

50|$|Two {{separation}} {{methods are}} widely used. One method utilizes ion exchangers which extract native whey protein from the whey stream {{according to the}} surface charge characteristics of the molecule, {{also known as the}} zeta-potential. This method uses mild pH adjustments to activate and subsequently deactivate the attraction between the ion exchange resin and the protein molecules. In between the <b>temporary</b> <b>binding</b> of protein to the resin, non-protein components are thoroughly washed from the reactor. This process may or may not damage the proteins, but no scientific evidence exists to suggest that it does. Although strong acids and bases are used for the adjustment, the pH rise itself is quite small and within the range common in foods. Changes in protein conformation within this range are reversible and are not considered denaturation. Ion exchange is highly specific to native whey proteins and is generally more selective in what is retained during the process. This is why the process is best known for creating highly pure whey proteins.|$|E

40|$|The {{question}} ‘what {{is working}} memory capacity?’ can be approached from the individual-differences and the experimental perspective. The {{first part of}} the article reviews individual-differences research that aims to determine the source of common variance among tests of working memory and related complex cognitive activities, such as reasoning and text comprehension. I propose that the ability to build, maintain and update <b>temporary</b> <b>bindings</b> between content and context representations underlies the shared variance of these variables. Multiple bindings must be maintained simultaneously for building new structural representations that underlie reasoning and language comprehension. Interference between these bindings limits the complexity of these structural representations. The second part of the article reviews experimental work, informed by computational modelling of the mechanisms of working memory. I introduce an interference-based model of working memory, SOB-CS, and review experiments with complex-span tasks that test predictions from that model. The experiments support the assumption that the capacity of working memory is limited by two forms of interference: interference by superposition of multiple bindings between distributed representations, and interference by confusion of similar items, and of items bound to similar contexts...|$|R
40|$|Publisher's chapter description: Likewise {{with books}} bound after what manner you please. It is {{as well to}} {{remember}} this statement {{when looking at the}} work of the hundreds of binders active throughout the United Kingdom over the period covered by this volume, who would have laboured for much of the time on individual commissions from retail booksellers (if they did not serve this function themselves), institutional libraries or private individuals, seeking to have books bought in sheets, paper wrappers or other <b>temporary</b> <b>bindings</b> put into permanent ones. For most of the eighteenth century, only the very cheapest end of the trade, such as school-books, popular romances and devotional works, typically sold books bound and delivered direct to the end-user, though the sale of bound bibles and liturgical works was something of an exception to that. It is in the second decade of the nineteenth century that significant numbers of editions were for the first time issued bound in what were intended to be permanent bindings. It is also important to remember that the bindings we know best from the literature – generally the more extensively decorated bindings – formed only a very small part of the trade. This chapter will therefore take as its main focus the more standard types of binding and the more ephemeral protection offered to text blocks within the book trade; the reader is directed to the existing literature for a more detailed accountof the more extensively decorated books...|$|R

40|$|Luck and Vogel (1997) {{showed that}} the storage {{capacity}} of visual working memory is about four objects and that this capacity {{does not depend on}} the number of features making up the objects. Thus, visual working memory seems to process integrated objects rather than individual features, just as verbal working memory handles higher-order "chunks" instead of individual features or letters. In this article, we present a model based on synchronization and desynchronization of reverberatory neural assemblies, which can parsimoniously account for both the limited capacity of visual working memory, and for the <b>temporary</b> <b>binding</b> of multiple assemblies into a single pattern. A critical capacity of about three to four independent patterns showed up in our simulations, consistent with the results of Luck and Vogel. The same desynchronizing mechanism optimizing phase segregation between assemblies coding for separate features or multifeature objects poses a limit to the number of oscillatory reverberations. We show how retention of multiple features as visual chunks (feature conjunctions or objects) in terms of synchronized reverberatory assemblies may be achieved with and without long-term memory guidance...|$|E

40|$|The article {{investigates the}} {{mechanisms}} of selecting and updating representations in declarative and procedural working memory (WM). Declarative WM holds the objects of thought available, whereas procedural WM holds representations {{of what to do}} with these objects. Both systems consist of three embedded components: activated long-term memory, a central capacity-limited component for building structures through <b>temporary</b> <b>bindings,</b> and a single-element focus of attention. Five experiments test the hypothesis of analogous mechanisms in declarative and procedural WM, investigating repetition effects across trials for individual representations (objects and responses) and for sets (memory sets and task sets), as well as set-congruency effects. Evidence for analogous processes was obtained from three phenomena: (1) Costs of task switching and of list switching are reduced with longer preparation interval. (2) The effects of task congruency and of list congruency are undiminished with longer preparation interval. (3) Response repetition interacts with task repetition in procedural WM; here we show an analogous interaction of list repetition with item repetition in declarative WM. All three patterns were reproduced by a connectionist model implementing the assumed selection and updating mechanisms. The model consists of two modules, an item-selection module selecting individual items from a memory set, or responses from a task set, and a set-selection module for selecting memory sets or task sets. The model codes the matrix of binding weights in the item-selection module as a pattern of activation in the set-selection module, thereby providing a mechanism for building chunks in LTM, and for unpacking them as structures into working memory...|$|R

Around that time I went to the British Embassy, which was then still known as the Legation, and imposed myself on the Secretary Mr. (William George) Aston in his room. I was at the time {{occasionally}} babysitting Mr. Aston’s children. He had considerable understanding of Japanese literature. However Mr. Aston had brought into the Legation with him the scripts of various foreign plays. He had brought the complete works of Shakespeare though I doubted even though they were there that I would read them. So Mr. Aston, knowing the scripts of the various plays gave me readings, after all it was just the summary that I simply wanted to hear and as a consequence, based on that, I didn’t really end up appreciating the technique of playwriting.But that I didn’t appreciate the techniques of playwriting from just listening it was certainly kind of him and I certainly often went to his room to listen to and discuss drama.

40|$|Memory binding is a {{cognitive}} process that enables complex objects {{to be stored}} or retrieved coherently during perception, learning, or action. Binding functions are aimed at reducing the misattribution {{of the features of}} objects in crowded and changing sensory contexts, ensuring accurate representation in visual working memory. Binding is a relatively new concept in working memory research. However, as an integrative function it provides a rich context in which to investigate the mechanisms underlying memory deterioration. In this PhD project, a range of experimental <b>temporary</b> <b>binding</b> paradigms were used to investigate whether some of the memory impairments observed in patients with Alzheimer’s Disease could be accounted for by deficits in this memory function. A set of neuropsychological tasks were used to investigate binding operations across memory domains (i. e., verbal and nonverbal), sensory modalities (i. e., visual and auditory), types of information (e. g., objects and colours), and retrieval processes (i. e., recognition and recall) in healthy individuals, Alzheimer’s Disease patients and other clinical populations. The results suggest that the efficiency of short-term memory to store bound complex events depends {{on the nature of the}} information presented (e. g., type of information bound into objects) (Chapter 2). Short-term memory seems to be equipped with relatively separate mechanisms to store integrated objects and individual features (Chapter 4). It was also observed that the binding properties of short-term memory apply to healthy young and older people, and are functions which are preserved in the elderly (Chapter 3). In two additional experimental chapters (5 and 6) the preserved binding abilities of older people were compared with <b>temporary</b> <b>binding</b> in Alzheimer’s Disease. The latter group showed a very large impairment in binding that was distinct from their impairments in memory for individual features. These findings suggest that memory binding tasks could reliably separate the cognitive changes in normal ageing from those linked with Alzheimer’ Disease. Moreover, the results of Chapter 7 suggested that memory binding tasks may detect memory changes in people that will develop Alzheimer’ Disease (i. e., asymptomatic carriers of the gene defect E 280 A of the Preseniline- 1 gene) almost 10 years before the average age of onset. These results are relevant to our understanding of short-term memory and to the memory models currently available. Finally, it is suggested that the constructs of memory binding may increase the sensitivity of current assessment procedures for people at risk of developing Alzheimer’s Disease.

40|$|The {{ability to}} create <b>temporary</b> <b>binding</b> {{representations}} of information from different sources in working memory has recently been found {{to relate to the}} development of monolingual word recognition in children. The current study explored this possible relationship in an adult word-learning context. We assessed whether the relationship between cross-modal working memory binding and lexical development would be observed in the learning of associations between unfamiliar spoken words and their semantic referents, and whether it would vary across experimental conditions in first- and second-language word learning. A group of English monolinguals were recruited to learn 24 spoken disyllable Mandarin Chinese words in association with either familiar or novel objects as semantic referents. They also took a working memory task in which their ability to temporarily bind auditory-verbal and visual information was measured. Participants’ performance on this task was uniquely linked to their learning and retention of words for both novel objects and for familiar objects. This suggests that, at least for spoken language, cross-modal working memory binding might play a similar role in second language-like (i. e., learning new words for familiar objects) and in more native-like situations (i. e., learning new words for novel objects). Our findings provide new evidence for the role of cross-modal working memory binding in L 1 word learning and further indicate that early stages of picture-based word learning in L 2 might rely on similar cognitive processes as in L 1...|$|E

In addition to identifying compounds effective against a spectrum of sexually transmitted pathogens, {{it will be important}} to ensure that these compounds are safe. Avoiding toxicity, inflammatory responses, or alteration of the function of resident immune cells are important consid-erations for the development of vaginally applied microbicides. Studies were performed with two classes of candidate microbi-cide compounds to determine if they would interfere with the recognition of antigen by CD 41 and CD 81 T lymphocytes. The presence of nontoxic concentrations of the anionic detergent cholic acid or the sulfated polymer lambda carrageenan did not inhibit recognition of immune peptide by antigen-specific T cells. However, antigen recognition by both CD 41 and CD 81 T lymphocytes was inhibited {{in the presence of the}} naphthalene sulfonate polymer PRO 2000. Brief (4 -h) exposure of antigen-presenting cells or T cells to PRO 2000 did not result in inhi-bition of antigen uptake and processing by antigen-presenting cells or the ability of specific T cells to respond to antigen stim-ulation, suggesting that the inhibition was <b>temporary.</b> <b>Binding</b> of antibodies specific for CD 18, CD 8, and CD 3 was impaired in the presence of PRO 2000, suggesting that the mechanism by which this microbicide inhibits T cell recognition of antigenic peptide may involve masking or internalization of surface pro-teins involved in T cell signaling or stabilizing T cell-antigen-presenting cell interactions.

40|$|Summary: Before European settlement, {{most of the}} 750, 000 ha of land {{comprising}} the Canterbury Plains was under native tussock grassland with pockets of podocarp forest. The dominant land use today is mixed cropping in which cereals and cash crops are grown for 2 to 4 years followed by grass-clover pasture for 2 to 4 years. These cropping rotations are generally too short for either a substantial build-up in soil organic matter under pasture or its breakdown under arable cropping to occur. Nonetheless, there is a cyclic improvement in both N-supplying capacity and soil structure under pasture {{and a decline in}} both properties under arable. Large N inputs (e. g., 100 - 300 kg N ha- 1 yr- 1) occur through N 2 fixation by the clover component of the pasture, but the potential for leaching losses of nitrate is substantial after the pasture is ploughed in. During the pasture phase there is an increase in <b>temporary</b> soil <b>binding</b> agents in the topsoil layer and consequently an increase in aggregate stability. There is also a change in soil porosity caused by pasture root growth and earthworm activity. In contrast, soil physical properties rapidly deteriorate under the arable phase of the rotation...|$|R
40|$|Brain {{electric}} {{mechanisms of}} <b>temporary,</b> functional <b>binding</b> between brain regions are studied using computation of scalp EEG coherence and phase locking, sensitive to time differences of few milliseconds. However, such results if computed from scalp data are ambiguous since electric sources are spatially oriented. Non-ambiguous {{results can be}} obtained using calculated time series of strength of intracerebral model sources. This is illustrated applying LORETA modeling to EEG during resting and meditation. During meditation, time series of LORETA model sources revealed a tendency to decreased left-right intracerebral coherence in the delta band, and to increased anterior-posterior intracerebral coherence in the theta band. An alternate conceptualization of functional binding {{is based on the}} observation that brain electric activity is discontinuous, i. e., that it occurs in chunks of up to about 100 ms duration that are detectable as quasi-stable scalp field configurations of brain electric activity, called microstates. Their functional significance is illustrated in spontaneous and event-related paradigms, where microstates associated with imagery- versus abstract-type mentation, or while reading positive versus negative emotion words showed clearly different regions of cortical activation in LORETA tomography. These data support the concept that complete brain functions of higher order such as a momentary thought might be incorporated in temporal chunks of processing in the range of tens to about 100 ms as quasi-stable brain states; during these time windows, subprocesses would be accepted as members of the ongoing chunk of processing...|$|R
40|$|Medieval cartularies {{have been}} the focus of many studies in the past few decades. Rather than simply {{repositories}} for charter texts, cartularies are now regarded by those who study them as carefully curated collections of texts whose contents and arrangement reflect the immediate concerns and archival environment of the communities that created them. One feature of cartularies which has not received attention is the ‘growth’ of their manuscripts beyond the initial phase of creation. This growth refers not only to the addition of fresh gatherings but also to the piecemeal addition of texts into the available spaces, often in a haphazard order and by many scribes working across a number of decades. ‘Manuscript growth’ is not an uncommon feature of cartularies from the central middle ages, particularly from the thirteenth century onwards. As a phenomenon, however, it has not been recognised or studied, for the good reason {{that it is difficult to}} discuss haphazard manuscript growth in a systematic way. This thesis offers a new methodology which engages with multi-scribe contributions to ‘active’ cartularies. It takes a holistic approach which integrates the textual and ‘physical’ evidence of cartularies, and embraces all forms of scribal activity. By studying the growth of cartulary manuscripts, we can gain significant insights into the contemporary use and perception of these valuable objects. This thesis therefore takes a fresh look at the ‘genre’ of medieval cartularies through the eyes of the manuscript evidence itself, and what this can reveal about its medieval scribes and readers. Two manuscripts are taken as the basis of this study: the older cartulary of Glasgow Cathedral (AUL SCA MS JB 1 / 3) and the older cartulary of Lindores Abbey (in private ownership in Caprington Castle). Chapter 1 introduces the field of cartulary studies, with reference to new work in this area (particularly in relation to cartularies in France and England). Central questions in this field are introduced, such as the definition of a cartulary, their creation and function. It also discusses approaches to analysing complex codices and multi-scribe activity within other manuscript genres. In Chapter 2, a new methodology will be introduced for analysing manuscript growth. This involves rethinking our approach to some familiar elements of manuscripts: their codicology, binding history, the scribes, as well as the challenge of dating the various contributions to the cartularies. New concepts and terminology will be introduced (such as ‘relative dating’ and ‘series’) that have been developed in response to these two complex cartularies. By applying this new methodology, the creation and subsequent growth of each manuscript can be examined in detail in Chapter 3 (for Glasgow Cathedral’s cartulary) and Chapter 4 (for Lindores Abbey’s). It is shown that the contemporary experience of these two cartularies was as a collection of simultaneously ‘active’ units (either unbound or in <b>temporary</b> <b>bindings),</b> offering new scribes a choice of where to place their material. Chapter 5 draws together the analysis, and focuses on the initial creation of the cartularies, the nature of their growth by piecemeal additions, and the reasons for this growth. This reveals two communities that took an active approach to reading and extending their cartularies, treating these manuscripts as a shared space. The vexed question of ‘repeated’ texts within cartularies is reconsidered in this light. The analysis allows us to develop a deeper understanding of the cartularies’ function and the role of their scribes as primarily readers, whose interactions with the manuscript were responsive and dynamic. The institutional setting is also discussed. The thesis concludes by considering the implications of this study for our understanding of the function and typology of cartularies, their relationship to archives of single-sheet documents, and as sources for institutional identity, as well as the potential of the methodology to act as a starting point for studying scribal interactions and scribes as readers in other manuscript genres with multi-scribe growth...|$|R
