25|$|Since most Singaporean Chinese {{trace their}} ancestral home to {{southern}} China, their culture generally has a closer affinity with southern Chinese culture (predominantly that of Fujian, Guangdong and Hainan) <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> terms of various southern Chinese dialects, customs, cultural, and religious practices in Singapore.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the recent}} upsurge in {{the motif of}} heroic werewolves, unsympathetic portrayals of werewolves as monsters also {{continue}} to be common in popular culture. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> movies, which are only slowly incorporating trends in written fiction.

25|$|Fear {{of the pit}} getting filled: In some places, {{people are}} scared that their toilet pits will get filled very fast if all family members use it everyday.

25|$|Antimicrobial copper-alloy touch {{surfaces}} {{can prevent}} frequently touched surfaces from serving as reservoirs for {{the spread of}} pathogenic microbes. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> healthcare facilities, where harmful viruses, bacteria, and fungi colonize and persist on doorknobs, push plates, railings, tray tables, tap (faucet) handles, IV poles, HVAC systems, and other equipment.

25|$|The World Health Organization, {{looking at}} global public health, {{identifies}} fluoride {{as one of}} a few chemicals (along with the arsenic and nitrate, {{and to a lesser extent}} lead, selenium and uranium) that are found in excessive levels in many parts of the world and cause negative health effects; for fluoride <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> large regions of India, China, Central Africa and South America, and locally in many parts of the world. Only for fluoride does it recommend adjusting the level in places where the chemical is low to reach a threshold; this is because there is clear evidence that low concentrations provide protection against cavities, both in children and in adults.|$|E
25|$|The {{more the}} {{internet}} is incorporated into daily life, the greater the impact it has on formal language. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> modern Language Arts classes {{through the use of}} smart phones, tablets, and social media. Students are exposed to the language of the internet more than ever, and as such, the grammatical structure and slang of the internet are bleeding into their formal writing. Full immersion into a language is always the best way to learn it. Mark Lester in his book Teaching Grammar and Usage states, “The biggest single problem that basic writers have in developing successful strategies for coping with errors is simply their lack of exposure to formal written English...We would think it absurd to expect a student to master a foreign language without extensive exposure to it.” Since students are immersed in internet language, that is the form and structure they are mirroring.|$|E
25|$|Most gem-quality diamond {{crystals}} are octahedra {{in their}} rough state (see material properties of diamond). These crystals are usually cut into round brilliants {{because it is}} possible to cut two such stones out of one octahedron with minimal loss of weight. If the crystal is malformed or twinned, or if inclusions are present at inopportune locations, the diamond is more likely to receive a fancy cut (a cut other than a round brilliant). <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> the case of macle, which are flattened twin octahedron crystals. Round brilliants have certain requisite proportions that would result in high weight loss, whereas fancy cuts are typically much more flexible in this regard. Sometimes the cutters compromise and accept lesser proportions and symmetry in order to avoid inclusions or to preserve carat weight, since the per-carat price of diamond is much higher when the stone is over one carat (200 mg).|$|E

25|$|Furthermore, many cancers {{originate}} from a viral infection; <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> {{animals such as}} birds, but less so in humans. 12% of human cancers {{can be attributed to}} a viral infection. The mode of virally induced tumors can be divided into two, acutely transforming or slowly transforming. In acutely transforming viruses, the viral particles carry a gene that encodes for an overactive oncogene called viral-oncogene (v-onc), and the infected cell is transformed as soon as v-onc is expressed. In contrast, in slowly transforming viruses, the virus genome is inserted, especially as viral genome insertion is obligatory part of retroviruses, near a proto-oncogene in the host genome. The viral promoter or other transcription regulation elements, in turn, cause over-expression of that proto-oncogene, which, in turn, induces uncontrolled cellular proliferation. Because viral genome insertion is not specific to proto-oncogenes and the chance of insertion near that proto-oncogene is low, slowly transforming viruses have very long tumor latency compared to acutely transforming virus, which already carries the viral-oncogene.|$|E
25|$|Along {{with being}} the capital of Canada, Ottawa is {{politically}} diverse in local politics. Most of the city has traditionally supported the Liberal Party. Perhaps the safest areas for the Liberals are the ones dominated by Francophones, especially in Vanier and central Gloucester. Central Ottawa is usually more left-leaning, and the New Democratic Party have won ridings there. Some of Ottawa's suburbs are swing areas, notably central Nepean and, despite its francophone population, Orléans. The southern and western parts {{of the old city}} of Ottawa are generally moderate and swing to the Conservative Party. The farther one goes outside the city centre like to Kanata and Barrhaven and rural areas, the voters tend to be increasingly conservative, both fiscally and socially. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> the former Townships of West Carleton, Goulbourn, Rideau and Osgoode, which are more in line with the conservative areas in the surrounding counties. However, not all rural areas support the Conservative Party. Rural parts of the former township of Cumberland, with a large number of Francophones, traditionally support the Liberal Party, though their support has recently weakened.|$|E
25|$|In every {{surgical}} and non-surgical procedure, {{the risk}} of medical complications exists before, during, and after a procedure, and, given the sensitive biological nature of breast tissues (adipocyte, glandular), <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> the case of fat graft breast augmentation. Despite its relative technical simplicity, the injection (grafting) technique for breast augmentation is accompanied by post-procedure complicationsfat necrosis, calcification, and sclerotic noduleswhich directly influence the technical efficacy of the procedure, and of achieving a successful outcome. The Chinese study Breast Augmentation by Autologous Fat-injection Grafting: Management and Clinical analysis of Complications (2009), reported {{that the incidence of}} medical complications is reduced with strict control of the injection-rate (cm3/min) of the breast-filler volume being administered, and by diffusing the fat-grafts in layers to allow their even distribution within the breast tissue matrix. The complications occurred to the 17-patient group were identified and located with 3-D volumetric and MRI visualizations of the breast tissues and of any sclerotic lesions and abnormal tissue masses (malignant neoplasm). According to the characteristics of the defect or abnormality, the sclerotic lesion was excised and liquefied fat was aspirated; the excised samples indicated biological changes in the intramammary fat graftsfat necrosis, calcification, hyalinization, and fibroplasia.|$|E
