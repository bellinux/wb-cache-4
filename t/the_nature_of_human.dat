5|$|Extraterrestrial {{technology}} could have profound impacts on <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>human</b> culture and civilization. Just as television provided a new outlet {{for a wide}} variety of political, religious, and social groups, and as the printing press made the Bible available to the common people of Europe, allowing them to interpret it for themselves, so an extraterrestrial technology might change humanity in ways not immediately apparent. Harrison speculates that a knowledge of extraterrestrial technologies could increase the gap between scientific and cultural progress, leading to societal shock and an inability to compensate for negative effects of technology. He gives the example of improvements in agricultural technology during the Industrial Revolution, which displaced thousands of farm laborers until society could retrain them for jobs suited to the new social order. Contact with an extraterrestrial civilization far more advanced than humanity could cause a much greater shock than the Industrial Revolution, or anything previously experienced by humanity.|$|E
5|$|The 1890s were {{a period}} of {{remarkable}} creative output for Durkheim. In 1893, he published The Division of Labour in Society, his doctoral dissertation and fundamental statement of <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>human</b> society and its development. Durkheim's interest in social phenomena was spurred on by politics. France's defeat in the Franco-Prussian War led to {{the fall of the}} regime of Napoleon III, which was then replaced by the Third Republic. This in turn resulted in a backlash against the new secular and republican rule, as many people considered a vigorously nationalistic approach necessary to rejuvenate France's fading power. Durkheim, a Jew and a staunch supporter of the Third Republic with a sympathy towards socialism, was thus in the political minority, a situation that galvanized him politically. The Dreyfus affair of 1894 only strengthened his activist stance.|$|E
5|$|Wade {{asserts that}} there is a clear {{continuity}} from the earlier apes of five million years ago to the anatomically modern humans who diverged from them, citing the genetic and social similarities between humans and chimpanzees. He attributes the divergence of the two species from a common ancestor to a change in their ecological niche; the ancestors of chimpanzees remained in the forests of equatorial Africa, whereas the ancestors of humans moved to open woodland and were exposed to different evolutionary pressures. Although Wade posits that much of human evolution {{can be attributed to the}} physical environment, he also believes that one of the major forces shaping evolution has been <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>human</b> society itself.|$|E

25|$|Some theorists such as Raymond Kurzweil {{think that}} the pace of {{technological}} innovation is accelerating and that the next 50 years may yield not only radical technological advances, but possibly a technological singularity, which may fundamentally change <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>human</b> beings. Transhumanists who foresee this massive technological change generally maintain that it is desirable. However, some are also concerned with the possible dangers of extremely rapid technological change and propose options for ensuring that advanced technology is used responsibly. For example, Bostrom {{has written extensively on}} existential risks to humanity's future welfare, including ones that could be created by emerging technologies.|$|E
25|$|The last {{philosophy}} {{book that}} Feyerabend finished is The Tyranny of Science (written 1993, published May 13, 2011). In it Feyerabend challenges {{what he sees}} in his view as some modern myths about science, e.g., {{he believes that the}} statement 'science is successful' is a myth. He argues that some very basic assumptions about science are simply false and that substantial parts of scientific ideology were created on the basis of superficial generalizations that led to absurd misconceptions about <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>human</b> life. He claims that far from solving the pressing problems of our age, scientific theorizing glorifies ephemeral generalities at the cost of confronting the real particulars that make life meaningful.|$|E
25|$|Unger turns this {{question}} {{from one of}} general principles {{to one of the}} enactment of a vision or project of self-affirmation. For Unger, at issue here is not the pure speculation of philosophical inquiry into <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>human</b> beings and their activities, but rather a transformative project of self and society. In this way, the task is to realize a vision and enact a program of self-affirmation. The only alternative is to find a better one or fail at self-affirmation. The standards by which Unger confirms a project of self-affirmation are as follows: socially it is unstable if it fails to deal with behavior predispositions or material constraints, and existentially it fails if it disregards recurrent features of our experience, e.g. dependence upon others.|$|E

[...] Chatwin also hinted at his preoccupation over his own mortality in the text: [...] "I had a presentiment that the 'travelling' phase of my life might be passing... I should set down on paper a resume of the ideas, quotations, and encounters that amused me and obsessed me..." [...] Following this statement in The Songlines Chatwin included extensive excerpts from his moleskine notebooks.|$|E
500|$|Magoon's primary {{responsibilities}} {{within the}} Canal Zone were to improve sanitation and {{to deal with}} the all-too-common outbreaks of yellow fever and malaria. At first, he refused to believe that the diseases were carried by mosquitos because, he reasoned, the native population would have been more affected. At this time, <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>human</b> acquired immunity to diseases was not well understood. The Chicago Tribune, in an article about conditions in the canal, referred to the notion that yellow fever was carried by mosquitos as [...] "bugaboo". However, by January 1906, Magoon had long come to understand the role of mosquitos in the transmission of diseases, as evidenced in a New York Times article wherein Magoon addressed criticisms of his administration in detail; by then he had undertaken a vigorous and ambitious plan to eliminate the swamps that bred mosquitos.|$|E
