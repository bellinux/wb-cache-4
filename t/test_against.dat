5|$|Despite {{his failure}} to reach double figures at The Oval, Craig {{maintained}} his position in the playing XI on the tour of the Indian subcontinent en route to Australia in late 1956, playing Test matches against Pakistan and India. However, he failed to pass 40 in his five innings. He made a duck and 18 on a matting wicket in Australia's one-off <b>Test</b> <b>against</b> Pakistan in Karachi before playing in the First <b>Test</b> <b>against</b> India, scoring 40 in an innings win in Madras. He was dropped for the Second Test but returned to make 36 and 6 in the Third Test in Calcutta as Australia took a 2–0 series win. The matches were {{the first time that}} Australia had played a Test in Asia.|$|E

5|$|Davidson was {{selected}} for the 1954–55 tour of the West Indies, where he injured his right ankle in a tour match against Jamaica and missed the First <b>Test</b> <b>against</b> the West Indies. Upon his recovery, he could not break into the XI and did not play {{in any of the}} Tests, which Australia won 3–0. He scored 70 runs at 35.00 and took four wickets at 51.75 in three first-class outings.|$|E
5|$|In the First <b>Test</b> <b>against</b> India in Delhi, Davidson took 3/22 in {{the first}} innings, {{removing}} both openers Pankaj Roy and Nari Contractor, and captain Polly Umrigar to help Australia seize the initiative and bowl out the hosts for 135. He then contributed four catches in the second as Australia took a 1–0 series lead with an innings victory.|$|E
5|$|In the Third <b>Test</b> <b>against</b> New Zealand in 2000, Gilchrist {{recorded}} the third best Test performance ever by a wicketkeeper, {{and the best}} by an Australian, taking ten catches in the match. Although Gilchrist's batting was modest, yielding 144 runs at 36.00, Australia took a 3–0 clean sweep. In two home and away ODI series against South Africa, Gilchrist had a quiet time, scoring 170 runs at 26.66. South Africa won three of the six matches, with one tie.|$|E

5|$|Kartik then {{played in}} one <b>Test</b> <b>against</b> Bangladesh and Zimbabwe {{respectively}} in India, taking match totals of 1/42 and 2/66. He scored 43 in the nine-wicket win over Bangladesh {{but was not}} required to bat in the seven-wicket win over Zimbabwe. New captain Sourav Ganguly—who had taken over after Sachin Tendulkar resigned following the South African whitewash—did not show much confidence in him, by only affording him frequent but short spells. Kartik was dropped from the team after the First <b>Test</b> <b>against</b> Zimbabwe, {{and did not have}} an opportunity to immediately prove his captain wrong, as the one-day domestic circuit was in progress at the time. Kartik took nine wickets at 25.22 at an economy rate of 4.02, and then had a chance to stake his claims for a Test recall in the Duleep Trophy.|$|E
5|$|Ring {{made his}} Test debut in last {{international}} match of the 194748 Australian season, the Fifth <b>Test</b> <b>against</b> India. Australia rested {{a few of}} its players and some fringe cricketers such as Ring and Sam Loxton were given a debut so that their ability could be evaluated before the tour of England. Ring took six wickets for the match and was selected for the tour along with Loxton, who scored 80.|$|E
5|$|The most {{successful}} team in Test cricket, {{in terms of}} both wins and win percentage, is Australia, having won 362 of their 773 Tests (46.83%). Barring the ICC World XI, a rest of world team which played a single <b>Test</b> <b>against</b> Australia in 2005, the least successful team are Bangladesh who have struggled since their introduction to Test cricket in 2000, leading to questioning of their Test status.|$|E
2500|$|After the Second World War Australia began {{a record}} unbeaten runs of games; 14 <b>Tests</b> <b>against</b> England, 26 <b>Tests</b> <b>against</b> all {{countries}} and 96 games in all cricket, having lost their last game to England at the Oval in 1938.

Their record remained until England played 27 Tests without defeat in 1968-71.|$|R
50|$|The 1959 tour to Australia and New Zealand marked {{once again}} a very {{successful}} tour for the Lions, who only lost six of their 35 fixtures. The Lions easily won both <b>tests</b> <b>against</b> Australia and lost the first three <b>tests</b> <b>against</b> New Zealand, but did find victory (9-6) in the final test.|$|R
5|$|The purple patch {{ended on}} the tour of South Africa and then Bangladesh. He scored 206 runs at 29.42 in five Tests and 248 runs at 35.42 in eight ODIs, {{inflated}} by a 144 in the First <b>Test</b> <b>against</b> Bangladesh. Despite this, Australia won all five Tests. Gilchrist scored 130 runs at 26.00, including a 92 against the West Indies as Australia won the 2006 Champions Trophy in India.|$|E
5|$|They were {{defeated}} in their <b>Test</b> <b>against</b> Australia {{and in all}} three against the All Blacks. The All Blacks' side was particularly strong and won all its Tests between 1965 and 1970. France's touring losses presaged a string of defeats that did not end until they drew against Wales in the 1969 Five Nations (in which France finished last).|$|E
5|$|A 104 in the First <b>Test</b> <b>against</b> India in October 2004 {{proved to}} be a false renaissance; he scored only 104 runs in the {{remaining}} seven innings on the Indian tour and 139 runs in eight ODI innings {{towards the end of the}} 2004–05 season, which formed the lowest average period of Gilchrist's career until 2007. He took the captaincy of the Test team once again, in place of the injured Ricky Ponting, and led the Australian side to an historic 2–1 series victory in India, a feat last achieved in 1969. Ponting recovered to lead the team in the Fourth Test, Australia's only loss.|$|E

5|$|A minor {{knee injury}} which only left Hunt out {{for two weeks}} was enough to deny him the {{opportunity}} to regain the fullback position for Australia in the Centenary <b>Test</b> <b>against</b> New Zealand in May 2008. Hunt's place in the Queensland team for the 2008 State of Origin series was assured by Queensland coach Mal Meninga but there was speculation that Hunt could play five-eighth in place of injured teammate Darren Lockyer. While not the best five-eighth possibility for the Queensland representative team, his selection there would make way for the Australian fullback Billy Slater. Hunt, having never played a senior rugby league game at five-eighth, was controversially selected at the position for Queensland instead of the in-form Scott Prince.|$|E
5|$|As {{the matches}} were often played {{consecutively}} without a day between fixtures, Australia employed a rotation policy, {{and as a}} result, Hassett captained the team in nine tour matches while Bradman was rested. Under Hassett's watch, Australia won seven matches, five of these by an innings, while both draws were rain-affected fixtures {{in which more than}} half the playing time was lost. Hassett had two close encounters, both on damp pitches before the First <b>Test.</b> <b>Against</b> Yorkshire, Australia scraped home by four wickets in a low-scoring match with ten men after Sam Loxton succumbed to injury. In a later match against Hampshire, Australia ceded a first innings lead {{for the first time on}} tour, but recovered to win by eight wickets.|$|E
5|$|Australia then {{defeated}} South Africa {{in their}} first Test of the tournament. Macartney made 21 in an innings victory and did not bowl. Macartney's batting waned in the next seven tour matches, passing 50 only three times in ten innings. However, he did take 13 wickets, including 6/54 against Yorkshire. Macartney then scored 99 in a drawn <b>Test</b> <b>against</b> England at Lord's that did not reach the second innings. Wisden regarded the innings as his best for the season. Macartney added half-centuries in consecutive county matches and after three further matches without passing 21, the Tests resumed.|$|E

5|$|Between Tests, Loxton {{played in}} the match against Northamptonshire, which started the day after Trent Bridge. With pace {{spearhead}} Ray Lindwall injured and Keith Miller rested following a marathon effort in the opening Test, Loxton opened the bowling and took 2/22 from 15 overs the hosts were dismissed for 119. He made only 17 with the bat and took 0/7, again opening in the second innings as Australia cruised to victory by an innings. Loxton was rested for the second match before the Second <b>Test,</b> <b>against</b> Yorkshire; Brown scored a century in a drawn match.|$|E
5|$|Boycott {{began his}} Test career on 4 June 1964, {{only two years}} after his {{first-class}} debut, in the first <b>Test</b> <b>against</b> Australia. He top scored with 48 runs from 118 deliveries before he was bowled by Grahame Corling. The match ended as a rain-affected draw, and Boycott did not bat in the second innings as he had suffered a cracked finger. He made 58 at Old Trafford, and then hit 113 at The Oval, his maiden Test century. He finished his first Test series with 291 runs at 48.50.|$|E
5|$|Boycott {{has responded}} to these accusations by {{pointing}} out that Lillee had been out of cricket for 21 months suffering from a serious back complaint and that Thomson had not played in Tests for 23 months before the 1974–5 Ashes series, since an unsuccessful debut <b>Test</b> <b>against</b> Pakistan (Thomson's match figures were 0–110). Furthermore, he was dismissed for 99 in the first innings against the West Indies at Port-of-Spain in 1973–74 and scored 112 in the second, followed by a career-best 261 not out against a West Indies Board President's XI. All of these teams included Roberts, with a young Holding representing the Board XI.|$|E
