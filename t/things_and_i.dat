5|$|I fell in {{love with}} him as a ten-year-old boy. I saw him in a play in New York... a very well-staged melodrama which was an {{enormous}} hit for about a year—it was made as a movie later with somebody else. He had the leading role, and I never forgot him. And through the years I'd seen him in movies—little <b>things.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> could never forget that performance of his. He's always played very stereotyped parts in pictures but is one of the best actors I've ever known. I have such respect for him. You play next to him and you just feel the thing that you do with a big actor—this dynamo going on.|$|E
25|$|How did I {{think up}} my {{drawings}} and my ideas for painting? Well I'd {{come home to}} my Paris studio in Rue Blomet at night, I'd go to bed, and sometimes I hadn't any supper. I saw <b>things,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> jotted them down in a notebook. I saw shapes on the ceiling...|$|E
25|$|It sort of is {{a little}} puzzle and I guess it goes by - but they're all great things. 'I won't stop doing {{beautiful}} <b>things</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> won't do bad things.' It's very noble. I'm {{very proud of that}} song because it's very much like out of the world of Excalibur. To me, it's like Sir Lancelot or something - very noble and chivalrous. That's my favorite song on the record - it's very ambitious.|$|E

25|$|The Torah's {{story of}} {{creation}} {{is not intended}} as a scientific treatise, worthy of equal time with Darwin's theory of evolution in the curriculum of our public schools. The notes it strikes in its sparse and majestic narrative offer us an orientation to the Torah's entire religious worldview and value system. Creation is taken up first not because the subject has chronological priority but rather to ground basic religious beliefs in {{the very nature of}} <b>things.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> would argue that their power is quite independent of the scientific context in which they were first enunciated.|$|E
25|$|I get {{the tune}} and then I {{just keep on}} singing the tune until the words come out from the tune. It's kind of a {{hypnotic}} state that you reach after a while when you keep on playing it where words just evolve from it. So you take those words and just let them go whichever way they want...'Moonshadow'? Funny, that was in Spain, I went there alone, completely alone, {{to get away from}} a few <b>things.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> was dancin' on the rocks there... right on the rocks where the waves were, like, blowin' and splashin'. Really, it was so fantastic. And the moon was bright, ya know, and I started dancin' and singin' and I sang that song and it stayed. It's just the kind of moment that you want to find when you're writin' songs.|$|E
500|$|Cropper's {{recollection}} {{is supported}} by a 1968 Rolling Stone interview with Hendrix: [...] "He [...] showed me how to play lots of <b>things</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> showed him how I played 'Have Mercy' or something like that". [...] Cropper later recorded an instrumental version of the song with Booker T. & the M.G.'s for their 1965 Soul Dressing album.|$|E

500|$|I think I should {{rephrase}} {{myself from}} my previous letters when I {{was talking about}} taking a 'break'. What I meant was I am {{taking a break from}} being told what to do. ... It's cool when you look at someone and don't know whether they are at work or play since it's all the same to them. The things I've been doing for work lately have been so much fun, because it's not like work to me anymore. I've been even more 'hands on' in my management and the business side of <b>things,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> feel more in control than ever.|$|E
500|$|Lead singer Chester Bennington {{arrived late}} in the {{recording}} process of the album, having been chosen to replace Scott Weiland in the band Stone Temple Pilots, and then proceeded to record High Rise and tour with the band for most of 2013. When he eventually joined the band in the studio, {{he was surprised to}} find the band had reverted to their heavier rock-centric sound. Bennington stated in an interview with Kerrang!: [...] "Mike wrote tons while I was touring with Stone Temple Pilots last year. When I got home, there was a lot for me to catch up with, and he was playing me <b>things</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> was like, 'Dude, this is fucking awesome!' I was really surprised how heavy it was".|$|E
500|$|Radiohead {{returned}} to Canned Applause in October for rehearsals, and completed most of OK Computer in further sessions at St. Catherine's Court. By Christmas, they had narrowed the track listing to 14 songs. The string parts were recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London in January 1997. The album was mastered {{at the same}} location, and mixed {{over the next two}} months at various studios around the city. Godrich preferred a quick and [...] "hands-off" [...] approach to mixing, and said: [...] "I feel like I get too into it. I start fiddling with <b>things</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> fuck it up... I generally take about half a day to do a mix. If it's any longer than that, you lose it. The hardest thing is trying to stay fresh, to stay objective." ...|$|E

500|$|Timberlake {{revealed}} in 2013 that he originally asked rapper JAY-Z (Whom he would collaborate with extensively {{in his later}} career) {{to appear on the}} track before T.I. [...] "I wanted to do a record with him on FutureSex/LoveSounds..." [...] he explained [...] "...and he at that time had done a record with Beyoncé, it was 'Déjà Vu.' And he said—respectfully, I can't knock him for saying like I have this one feature, I think he was working on his own music as well so he didn't want to be on too many <b>things.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> said, 'I totally respect that. I'm obviously not gonna get into any domestic anything. That's your wife.' But the record was 'My Love.' And it ended up being an interesting blessing in disguise because I think Tip for that record—I mean his verse is phenomenal." ...|$|E
500|$|Timmons became {{best known}} as a member of Art Blakey's band the Jazz Messengers, which he was first part of from July 1958 to September 1959, {{including}} for a tour of Europe. He was recruited for the Messengers by saxophonist Benny Golson, who said that [...] "He was inventive, [...] He could play bebop and he could play funky – he could play a lot of <b>things,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> thought it was the element that Art needed. He hadn't had anybody quite like Bobby, who could go here or go there, rather than walking in a single corridor." [...] By late 1958 Timmons was sharing bandmate Morgan's East Sixth Street apartment and the pair had bought a piano, allowing Timmons to practice and Morgan to work on composing. From around the time he joined Blakey, Timmons, along with some of his fellow band members, was a heroin user. After leaving Blakey, Timmons joined Cannonball Adderley's band, in October 1959.|$|E
500|$|William IV had a {{short but}} eventful reign. In Britain, the Reform Crisis marked the {{ascendancy}} of the House of Commons and the corresponding decline of the House of Lords, and the King's unsuccessful attempt to remove the Melbourne ministry indicated {{a reduction in the}} political influence of the Crown and of the King's influence with the people. During the reign of George III, the King could have dismissed one ministry, appointed another, dissolved Parliament, and expected the people to vote in favour of the new administration. Such {{was the result of a}} dissolution in 1784, after the dismissal of the Fox-North Coalition, and in 1807, after the dismissal of Lord Grenville. But when William IV dismissed the Melbourne ministry, the Tories under Sir Robert Peel failed to win the ensuing elections. The monarch's ability to influence the opinion of the people, and therefore national policy, had been reduced. None of William's successors has attempted to remove a government or to appoint another against the wishes of Parliament. William understood that as a constitutional monarch he had no power to act against the opinion of Parliament. He said, [...] "I have my view of <b>things,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> tell them to my ministers. If they do not adopt them, I cannot help it. I have done my duty." ...|$|E

500|$|Hochuli's {{presence}} {{on the football field}} has created a cult following. His rise in popularity {{is believed to have been}} started by Phil Simms, a former NFL quarterback and current color commentator for the NFL on CBS, who made reference to the size of Hochuli's arms during a telecast. [...] On the Internet, websites that sell Hochuli merchandise as well as blogs with his namesake exist. He is often affectionately referred to as [...] "Hochules", a portmanteau of his last name and [...] "Hercules", in homage to his large biceps. While he is aware of his celebrity status, Hochuli does not understand it. He said in a USA Today interview, [...] "I get a kick out of the notoriety, because I'm just a referee. I'm not the players. The players are the game. They're what this is all about. I get notoriety because I explain <b>things,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> get notoriety because I have a decent physique, which is funny because I'm a shrimp, a peewee compared to those players. Neither one of those things has anything to do with whether I'm a good referee." [...] His recognition extends to the streets, in airports, and in the courtroom. He has been approached by notable athletes such as former National Basketball Association (NBA) player Charles Barkley at the airport. [...] "It never ceases to amaze me," [...] Hochuli told the Arizona Daily Star. [...] "The number of people that will just come up to me and recognize me." [...] He appreciates the attention, saying, [...] "I enjoy the fact that there are people who like me as a referee. I hear from a lot of people and I enjoy that. Like anybody, I like praise. Probably because of my personality, I thrive on that more than other people." ...|$|E
500|$|Madonna herself {{would later}} say: [...] "I wouldn't say I regret it. I've made {{mistakes}} and learned from them. Most {{people want to}} hear me say that I regret publishing my Sex book. I don't. What was the problem was releasing my Erotica album at the same time. I love that album and it got overlooked." [...] However, author Andy Koopmans in his book Madonna (2002) would comment that the singer regretted both publishing Sex and recording Erotica and that the book [...] "had affected everything she did later". It was not until 2003 that Madonna would once again declare that she regretted nothing; [...] "I'm not apologizing in any shape or form [...] I was interested in pushing buttons and being rebellious and being mischievous and trying to bend the rules. There was a lot of irony in the Sex book and I am poking fun at a lot of <b>things</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> am being kind of silly and adolescent and I am being very f you, if a man can do it, I can do it." [...] A year earlier on 2002, Naomi Campbell confessed to [...] "have {{a lot of respect for}} Madonna being bold enough to come out and do a book on sex. I've never reneged on that". However, in 2009, rapper Vanilla Ice, who was Madonna's boyfriend at the time of the book's creation, confessed to not being happy with the book once he saw it. [...] "My friends were like, 'Dude, that's cool man', but I was like, 'I'm dating her, it's not cool to see your girlfriend with all these other people' [...] It kinda ruined the whole thing. I wonder what her kids think of that book? Here she is writing kids' books now but they're going to see it and go, 'Mommy, what were you thinking?'" [...] Another of the book's models, actress Isabella Rossellini, told Out magazine that she regretted her participation on the book; [...] "I don't think the book worked, even though the photos were extraordinary, and some of them quite memorable. I think there was a little bit of a moralistic sort of 'I'll teach you how to be free!' – and that bothered the hell out of me." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{choosing}} {{his lead}} single, Drake told Rap-Up, [...] "It’s gotta {{be a real}} great song. It’s gotta be something that I feel is timeless and is better than anything that I’ve ever done." [...] Drake exclusively revealed to Rap-Up on February 15, 2010 that [...] "Over" [...] would be the lead single from his debut album, Thank Me Later, and would be produced by Boi-1da, producer of his previous singles [...] "Best I Ever Had" [...] and [...] "Forever". Drake chose to premiere the song on his hometown Toronto's radio station Flow 93.5. In an interview session with the station, Drake said, [...] "I went with 'Over' as the first look because of {{the words in the}} hook," [...] he said. [...] "The hook being the most repetitive part. I got a lot of great songs on my album. I got songs for women who wanna feel special. I got songs for dudes — if you ever thought my music was too soft, this is one you will enjoy. I got a lot of variety on there, but the biggest thing was that opening line on the hook: 'I know way too many people here right now that I didn't know last year'." [...] He went on to explain that the record sums up where he is in his career right now, and called it a [...] "great first impression". Drake did a lot of work for the song and also the album in Jamaica, during which he called the [...] "calm before the storm", and called [...] "Over" [...] the storm. He said, [...] "It's the moment. I wanted to emerge at first from this album and just let people know 'This is how I'm coming out in the public eye. I'm ready for anything." [...] He then went to explain that after the album people will be like [...] "he's still human" [...] or [...] "he's still thinking the same way", and said he wanted people to [...] "understand I could have lost it. He said, [...] "'Over' could have been my entire album. Just 'cause that's what this industry and game will do to you if you lose yourself." [...] Drake later said that the song was a [...] "warm-up record". He went on to say, [...] "I love the song. I love the message in the song. It's funny, because 'Over' is the fourth song on the album and it's the turning point in the album. It's like, you get three songs of me sort of trying to paint the picture of what the last year has been like for me — trying to fill you in, almost let you into my world as much as I can. 'Over' is that moment where you're almost worried on the album. 'Is this kid about to ... ? What's happening? Is he changing?' I wanted that to come out first. I wanted people to be a little nervous. This whole journey could have changed me drastically. Fortunately I'm able to step out of my shoes and reflect on it and give you some great music. 'Over' is a great alter-ego moment. It's the dark side of <b>things</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> really wanted that to come out first." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I don't," [...] Miss Annie answered. [...] "Cousin Junius {{would never}} have {{undertaken}} such a <b>thing,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> don't believe you would be cruel enough to ask him." ...|$|R

In a 1997 interview, James {{commented on the}} difference between works released under different names, saying [...] "There's really no big theory. It's just things that I feel right in doing {{at the time and}} I really don't know why. I select songs for certain <b>things</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> just do it. I don't know what it means".|$|E

2500|$|Troubled by new acts he {{felt were}} imitating Radiohead, Yorke {{believed}} his music had {{become part of}} a constant background noise he described as [...] "fridge buzz", and became hostile to the music media. He told The Guardian: [...] "I always used to use music as a way of moving on and dealing with <b>things,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> sort of felt like that the thing that helped me deal with things had been sold to the highest bidder and I was simply doing its bidding. And I couldn't handle that." [...] He suffered from writer's block, and could not finish writing songs on guitar.|$|E
