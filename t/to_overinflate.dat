50|$|Tires: Problems with a vehicle's tires {{may result}} in the {{unexpected}} loss of control of a vehicle, due to such problems as reduced traction or a sudden loss of tire pressure during operation of the vehicle. Defects in the design or manufacture of a tire {{may result in}} tire tread separation of sidewall failure, even during normal use. Incorrect maintenance information provided by a manufacturer may cause a vehicle owner <b>to</b> <b>overinflate</b> or underinflate tires, reducing safety.|$|E
30|$|The Nihon Kohden linear inflationary {{non-invasive}} {{blood pressure}} (iNIBP®) measurement technology is an oscillometric device {{used to measure}} blood pressure by detecting oscillations during inflation. We can read systolic blood pressures without the need <b>to</b> <b>overinflate</b> the cuff higher than the true systolic pressure. Thus, the total time taken for inflation and deflation is shorter than that taken by conventional deflationary devices.|$|E
5000|$|Devizes {{railway station}} opened on 1 July 1857, 21 {{years after its}} initial {{conception}} and one week ahead of schedule, much to the annoyance of the locals who were preparing a celebration. After starting with 7 trains a day services were reduced to four a day, most probably due <b>to</b> <b>overinflated</b> claims of traffic before it was built. Although Devizes opened as a branch line it was soon recognised as {{a stop on the}} route to London and received all kinds of traffic including passenger, freight goods and express trains. Devizes was later returned to Branch status in 1900 when the GWR opened the Stert and Westbury Railway between Patney and Chirton railway station and Westbury which by-passed the steep gradients of Devizes and got from London to [...] faster.|$|R
40|$|Acute {{tracheal}} dilatation, due <b>to</b> an <b>overinflated</b> cuff, {{has been}} reported early {{in the course of}} mechanical ventilation through an endotracheal tube. Tracheal stoma necrosis is a rare complication, but such can accompany acute tracheal dilation. Herein, we report a case of tracheal necrosis 9 days following tracheostomy placement in a 71 -year old woman associated with overinflation of the tracheal tube cuff. This case report aims to 1) add to the scant body of knowledge about the diagnosis and management for the patients with tracheal stoma necrosis and 2) raise awareness for error-traps in interpreting diagnostic images, specifically satisfaction of search error, inattentional blindness error, and alliterative error...|$|R
30|$|Having {{illustrated}} the metrics that our method requires, we now present the analytical approach. This {{is based on}} spatial linear regression, as it allows to directly compare and interpret regression coefficients, and thus to measure to what extent our metrics of urban form can explain of the variance of the socio-economic index relative to one another. The analytical approach consists of a four-step process: (i) selection of the areal unit of analysis and computation of the metrics of urban form and socio-economics for such unit; (ii) normalisation and scaling of the metrics to meet the assumption of linear regression and obtain comparable regression coefficients; (iii) test for collinearity <b>to</b> avoid <b>overinflated</b> regression coefficients and unexpected signs; (iv) test for spatial autocorrelation to check for this issue and use of spatial regression in case the phenomenon is present. We follow with more details next.|$|R

30|$|The {{choice of}} {{anaesthetic}} technique for laparoscopic surgery is predominantly general anaesthesia. However, {{penetration of the}} stomach may occur when the stomach is distended during the induction of anaesthesia. Some reports have implicated {{the use of a}} laryngeal mask as a cause for gastric distension, particularly if it is unknowingly malpositioned, and therefore an independent risk factor for gastric injury [7]. A laryngeal mask was used in our patient, and we believe that this may have been responsible for the hyperinflation of the stomach causing it to descend to a level below the umbilicus and {{in the path of the}} Veress needle and trocar. Care needs to be taken <b>to</b> avoid <b>overinflating</b> the stomach during ventilation. Where this is suspected to have occurred, due to upper abdominal distension or increased tympanism, a nasogastric tube should be inserted to evacuate the stomach prior to the creation of pneumoperitoneum in order to prevent injuries to the anterior surface of the stomach [4]. Should a complication occur, early recognition is essential.|$|R
25|$|Membership {{data on a}} {{relatively}} new, worldwide religion are difficult to arrive at. The religion is almost entirely contained in a single, organised community, but the Bahá'í population is spread out {{and not in a}} majority anywhere. Populations are not assigned a Bahá'í religious adherence by birth, {{as is the case with}} other major religions such as Islam and Christianity. Few religious surveys include the Bahá'í Faith due to the high sample size required to reduce the margin of error, and those that have included the Bahá'í Faith are known <b>to</b> underestimate or <b>overinflate</b> many proportionally small groups. Additionally, Bahá'í membership data does not break out active participation from the total number of people who have expressed their belief.|$|R
40|$|Large volume, low {{pressure}} endotracheal tube cuffs are {{claimed to have}} less deleterious effect on tracheal mucosa than high pressure, low volume cuffs. Low pressure cuffs, however, may easily be <b>overinflated</b> <b>to</b> yield pressures that will exceed capillary perfusion pressure. Various large volume cuffed endotracheal tubes were studied, including Portex Profile, Searle Sensiv, Mallinkrodt Hi-Lo, and Lanz. Tracheal mucosal blood flow in 40 patients undergoing surgery was assessed using an endoscopic photographic technique while varying the cuff inflation pressure. It was found that these cuffs when overpressurised impaired mucosal blood flow. This impairment of tracheal mucosal blood flow {{is an important factor}} in tracheal morbidity associated with intubation. Hence it is recommended that a cuff inflation pressure of 30 cm H 2 O (22 mm Hg) should not be exceeded...|$|R
40|$|Developmental {{studies suggest}} that marital quality {{improves}} in old age (e. g., Guilford 2 ̆ 6 Bengtson, 1979). However, many of the studies are replete with sampling biases that probably led <b>to</b> an <b>overinflated</b> positive report of marital satisfaction in older adults. Our review evaluated contemporary studies that have investigated interpersonal and psychological factors associated with dissatisfaction in long-term marriages. Recent investigations indicate that older marriages benefit from lower levels of conflict and greater sources of mutual pleasure following child-rearing cessation. Studies of social support in long-term marriages suggest that perceptions of spousal support are more strongly related to marital satisfaction and general well-being for older women than for men. A few investigations have found {{a significant relationship between}} depression and marital discord in older adult samples, and the causal flow between these two variables appears to be unidirectional in that depression has a detrimental impact on late-life marital quality. Indeed, depression has been found to mediate the link between many age-related stressors (e. g., ill health, retirement) and declines in marital adjustment. However, our preliminary analysis of marital adjustment within a depressed, older adult, outpatient sample of married individuals did not confirm statistically that marital discord is associated with depressive symptomatology. This, in part, was attributed to the very narrow range of older adults sampled (i. e., clinic patients suffering from depression). However, the majority of depressives characterized their marriages as discordant. The implications for these findings are discussed and future directions are offered...|$|R
40|$|Generic cost {{estimates}} {{are important in}} giving a general impression about {{the magnitude of the}} overall task of decommissioning. Site-specific {{cost estimates}}, however, are necessary for each individual power plant so that differences in design, site, and history will be reflected as accurately as possible. Thomas LaGuardia has more experience in preparing such estimates {{than anyone else in the}} U. S. In this chapter he gives an insider's view of cost estimates which will be valuable to the utility operator who wants to know whether an estimate is adequate without being <b>overinflated,</b> <b>to</b> the regulator who is responsible to the citizens, and to the public who ultimately will pay the bills. He discusses various types of contracts such as fixed price, time and materials, cost-plus -fixed-fee, and utility-to-DOC fixed price, recommending the use of fixed-price contracts for subcontractors and a cost-plus-fixed or incentive fee for the primary contractor. He stresses the need for site-specific estimates. ...|$|R
40|$|The Ares I ascent {{aerodynamics}} {{database for}} Design Cycle 3 (DAC- 3) was built from wind-tunnel test results and CFD solutions. The wind tunnel results {{were used to}} build the baseline response surfaces for wind-tunnel Reynolds numbers at power-off conditions. The CFD solutions were used to build increments to account for Reynolds number effects. We calculate the validation errors for the primary CFD code results at wind tunnel Reynolds number power-off conditions {{and would like to}} be able to use those errors to predict the validation errors for the CFD increments. However, the validation errors are large compared to the increments. We suggest a way forward that is consistent with common practice in wind tunnel testing which is to assume that systematic errors in the measurement process and/or the environment will subtract out when increments are calculated, thus making increments more reliable with smaller uncertainty than absolute values of the aerodynamic coefficients. A similar practice has arisen for the use of CFD to generate aerodynamic database increments. The basis of this practice is the assumption of strong correlation of the systematic errors inherent in each of the results used to generate an increment. The assumption of strong correlation is the inferential link between the observed validation uncertainties at wind-tunnel Reynolds numbers and the uncertainties to be predicted for flight. In this paper, we suggest a way to estimate the correlation coefficient and demonstrate the approach using code-to-code differences that were obtained for quality control purposes during the Ares I CFD campaign. Finally, since we can expect the increments to be relatively small compared to the baseline response surface and to be typically of the order of the baseline uncertainty, we find that it is necessary to be able to show that the correlation coefficients are close to unity <b>to</b> avoid <b>overinflating</b> the overall database uncertainty with the addition of the increments...|$|R
40|$|SummaryKlippel–Trénaunay {{syndrome}} (KTS) {{is a rare}} congenital {{disorder that}} consists of mixed vascular malformations. The management of KTS is challenging and multidimensional. Debulking or excisional surgery may be performed in certain patients with KTS. Tissue expansion is a widely used reconstruction technique in plastic surgery and facilitates the reconstruction of skin and soft tissue defects after the excision of large vascular anomalies. In children with lower extremity KTS, {{large areas of the}} involved skin and soft tissue can be removed safely and reconstructed by using expanded tissue. In this paper, we report two cases of pediatric lower limb KTS with large cutaneous involvement and substantial soft tissue hypertrophy around the knee. The placement of a tissue expander was planned preoperatively. For 18 weeks postimplantation, the expander was <b>overinflated</b> <b>to</b> 3 – 4 times its capacity. Partial excision of the malformed tissue around the knee was subsequently performed. The resultant defect was reconstructed using the expanded tissue. Both patients were postoperatively inspected regularly at our outpatient clinic. Neither patient had surgical or tissue expander-related complications. One year after surgery, {{there was no evidence of}} local recurrence. Both children retained full range of knee joint motion without limitations in activities of daily living. Tissue expansion is an effective and reliable method of reconstruction. It may be considered in addition to surgical excision in patients with KTS with substantial cutaneous involvement around the joints. Long-term management and close follow ups are necessary for achieving satisfactory outcomes...|$|R
40|$|Dust {{surveys were}} {{conducted}} at six underground mines {{to determine if}} deep-cut mining practices expose face workers {{to higher levels of}} respirable dust by comparing levels during the first 20 ft of advance (regular-cut depth) during the deep cut to levels during the final 10 to 20 ft of advance (deep-cut depth). The studies were conducted at mines where the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) had approved an extended curtain setback distance with operation of a flooded-bed scrubber to permit taking deep cuts of up to 40 ft. In general, all of the selected mines exercised good dust control practices by maintaining water sprays, scrubber airflows, proper curtain setback distances and providing sufficient airflow to the active faces. These practices minimized variability in dust levels related to factors other than the depth of cut. To ensure proper scrubber functioning, the scrubber screen was back-flushed before commencing each cut. Both exhausting and blowing face ventilation configurations were studied. All of the operations surveyed for this study were able to successfully implement deep-cutting methods without significantly increasing the dust exposures of face workers during the cutting and bolting cycles. For exhausting face ventilation, field data indicate that scrubber airflow is the most important factor for controlling dust. Clogging of the scrubber screen can result in lower airflows; therefore, the screen must be periodically tapped and back-flushed. Data collected for this study indicate that 20 -mesh screens should be cleaned for every 40 ft of advance because 22 % of the deep-cut sequences surveyed for this study experienced a 20 % to 35 % decrease in scrubber airflow {{over the course of the}} cut. For blowing face ventilation, field and laboratory data indicate that maintaining a proper curtain-to-scrubber airflow ratio of 1. 0 and a curtain setback distance that allows the miner operator to stand at the mouth of the curtain helps control dust. Curtain airflows should be measured before activation of the scrubber regardless of ventilation type (exhausting or blowing) <b>to</b> avoid erroneously <b>overinflating</b> the ratio. The curtain setback variance should be greater than the maximum cutting depth to allow miner operators to maintain their position at the mouth of the curtain when the miner is fully extended into the cut. Greater curtain setback distances associated with deep-cutting methods may result in cuts that do not require ventilation curtain, such as the initial heading developments beyond the last open crosscut. For these cuts, dust levels were generally lower during development of deep cuts when compared to regular cuts. However, adequate ventilation of cuts without ventilation curtain is dependent on a properly functioning scrubber. Dust levels on the bolting faces did not appear to be affected by the longer cycles associated with deep-cut mining practices when curtain airflow was measureable and the curtain was periodically advanced in sync with the bolting machine.
