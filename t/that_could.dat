5|$|A general problem {{existed in}} powerplants. The He 111 was {{equipped}} with BMW VI glycol-cooled engines. The German aviation industry lacked powerplants <b>that</b> <b>could</b> produce more than 600 hp. Engines of suitable quality were kept for military use, frustrating German airline Luft Hansa and forcing it {{to rely on the}} BMW VI or 132s.|$|E
5|$|A {{unique and}} native form of poetic {{literature}} in Kannada called Vachanas developed during this time.

5|$|According to Prof. Whittington, Cantril was {{the first}} {{challenge}} to a federal statute under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to be considered by the Court.

5|$|Although a 12th-century monastic chronicler at Worcester called Leofric Edward's {{chancellor}}, {{this is not}} correct, as Edward had no chancellor at this time.

5|$|Another {{innovation}} was {{a mobile}} pillbox <b>that</b> <b>could</b> be driven {{out onto the}} airfield. This {{was known as the}} Bison and consisted of a lorry with a concrete armoured cabin and a small concrete pillbox on the flat bed.|$|E

5|$|As {{frigatebirds}} rely {{on large}} marine predators such as tuna for their prey, overfishing threatens to significantly impact on food availability and jeopardise whole populations.

5|$|Bernard Lovell {{built the}} Transit Telescope at Jodrell Bank {{in the late}} 1940s. This was a -diameter radio {{telescope}} <b>that</b> <b>could</b> only point directly upwards; {{the next logical step}} was to build a telescope <b>that</b> <b>could</b> look at all parts of the sky so that more sources could be observed, as well as for longer integration times. Although the Transit Telescope had been designed and constructed by the astronomers that used it, a fully steerable telescope would need to be professionally designed and constructed; the first challenge was to find an engineer willing to do the job. This turned out to be Charles Husband, whom Lovell first met on 8 September 1949.|$|E

5|$|By the mid-1950s, HIAG {{established}} {{an image that}} separated the Waffen-SS from other SS formations and shifted responsibility for crimes <b>that</b> <b>could</b> not be denied to the Allgemeine-SS (security and police), the SS-Totenkopfverbände and the Einsatzgruppen.

5|$|Claims of {{short-lived}} lunar phenomena go back {{at least}} 1,000 years, with some having been observed independently by multiple witnesses or reputable scientists.
