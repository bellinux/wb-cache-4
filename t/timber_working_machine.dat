In presented work we deal with creation of four wheel drive model of mobile <b>working</b> <b>machine</b> with modular structure in MATLAB/Simulink environment. Simulation and analyzing of working conditions of selected mobile <b>working</b> <b>machine</b> is realized. 1 Model of mobile <b>working</b> <b>machine</b> in MATLAB/Simulink There are not too many authors who are writing about dynamic modeling of complex of mobile <b>working</b> <b>machines.</b> The dynamic models of powertrain are modeled in the thesis Carter [6], Prasetiawan [13] and Zangh [22]. Tinker [17] developed detailed mathematical and physical powertrain model of wheel loader. For dynamic modeling of mobile <b>working</b> <b>machines</b> can be used Vlk [18], Bauer [2], Kiencke and Nielsen [9], Rill [14]. Useful reference is work written by Guzzella and Amstutz [8]. Primary an object of above mentioned references is not <b>working</b> <b>machines,</b> but these works deal with vehicles in general.

40|$|The {{power demand}} of many mobile <b>working</b> <b>machines</b> such as mine loaders, {{straddle}} carriers and harvesters varies significantly during operation, and typically, the average power demand of a <b>working</b> <b>machine</b> is considerably {{lower than the}} demand for maximum power. Consequently, {{for most of the}} time, the diesel engine of a <b>working</b> <b>machine</b> operates at a poor efficiency far from its optimum efficiency range. However, the energy efficiency of dieseldriven <b>working</b> <b>machines</b> can be improved by electric hybridization. This way, the diesel engine can be dimensioned to operate within its optimum efficiency range, and the electric drive with its energy storages responds to changes in machine loading. A hybrid <b>working</b> <b>machine</b> can be implemented in many ways either as a parallel hybrid, a series hybrid or a combination of these two. The energy efficiency of hybrid <b>working</b> <b>machines</b> can be further enhanced by energy recovery and reuse. This doctoral thesis introduces the component models required in the simulation model of a <b>working</b> <b>machine.</b> Component efficiency maps are applied to the modelling; the efficiency maps for electrical machines are determined analytically in the whole torque–rotational speed plane based on the electricalmachine parameters. Furthermore, the thesis provides simulation models for parallel, series and parallel-series hybrid <b>working</b> <b>machines.</b> With these simulation models, the energy consumption of the <b>working</b> <b>machine</b> can be analysed. In addition, the hybridization process is introduced and described. The thesis provides a case example of the hybridization and dimensioning process of a <b>working</b> <b>machine,</b> starting from the work cycle of the machine. The selection and dimensioning of the hybrid system {{have a significant impact on}} the energy consumption of a hybrid <b>working</b> <b>machine.</b> The thesis compares the energy consumption of a <b>working</b> <b>machine</b> implemented by three different hybrid systems (parallel, series and parallel-series) and with different component dimensions.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} distributed statistical machine learning in adversarial settings, where some unknown and time-varying subset of <b>working</b> <b>machines</b> may be compromised and behave arbitrarily to prevent an accurate model from being learned. This setting captures the potential adversarial attacks faced by Federated Learning [...] a modern machine learning paradigm that is proposed by Google researchers and has been intensively studied for ensuring user privacy. Formally, we focus on a distributed system consisting of a parameter server and m <b>working</b> <b>machines.</b> Each <b>working</b> <b>machine</b> keeps N/m data samples, where N is {{the total number of}} samples. The goal is to collectively learn the underlying true model parameter of dimension d. In classical batch gradient descent methods, the gradients reported to the server by the <b>working</b> <b>machines</b> are aggregated via simple averaging, which is vulnerable to a single Byzantine failure. In this paper, we propose a Byzantine gradient descent method based on the geometric median of means of the gradients. We show that our method can tolerate q < (m- 1) / 2 Byzantine failures, and the parameter estimate converges in O(N) rounds with an estimation error of √(d(2 q+ 1) /N), hence approaching the optimal error rate √(d/N) in the centralized and failure-free setting. The total computational complexity of our algorithm is of O((Nd/m) N) at each <b>working</b> <b>machine</b> and O(md + kd ^ 3 N) at the central server, and the total communication cost is of O(m d N). We further provide an application of our general results to the linear regression problem. A key challenge arises in the above problem is that Byzantine failures create arbitrary and unspecified dependency among the iterations and the aggregated gradients. We prove that the aggregated gradient converges uniformly to the true gradient function...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Precision {{location}} {{technology is}} one of basic technologies to realize the farmland <b>working</b> <b>machine</b> automatic driving and prescription agriculture; {{it is an important}} content of modern intelligent agricultural machinery research. In order to study a low-cost and high-precision location system which can be applied in the small machine worked in the south paddy field, the study proposed a double laser sources location technology. With the known distance between two laser emitter, the dynamic emission angle of laser emitter can be acquired and the location coordinate of the moving machine can be accumulated. Then the real-time coordinate information and moving attitude also can be obtained. It lays a foundation for unmanned <b>working</b> <b>machine</b> and data acquisition from fixed-point in the paddy field. First, the principle of laser location was introduced in the paper, and it focused on the design of mechanical structure and controlling unit. Then, the automatic tracking and location experiment was carried when the system was fixed on the rice transplanter. And the experiment shows, the distance shifting of tracking curve is less than 7 cm in the measurement of 100 m, and the advantage of the high precision, low cost and high portability is very suitable for the location requirement of south farmland <b>working</b> <b>machine.</b> 0 Intorductio...|$|R

The dissertation presents a novel solution, which combines a two-step planetary gearbox and a tooth-coil permanent magnet synchronous machine with embedded magnets to solve the problem. The important boundary conditions in terms of the electromagnetic design, mechanics, and cooling are discussed. The high design flexibility offered by permanent magnet synchronous machines is utilized to the full to find a feasible integrated design. Furthermore, the dissertation presents a solution for a gear change mechanism, which is located inside an integrated electric motor gear assembly. The designed and measured performance of the integrated system meets the needs of many off-road <b>working</b> <b>machines.</b> The prototype motor has about 40 kW power and could be adapted for instance on each wheel of a farming tractor, bucket loader, or harvester. The same technology could also be used in on-road applications, such as buses or trucks, intended for difficult terrains...|$|R
