40|$|<b>The</b> anger <b>superiority</b> effect {{shows that}} an angry face is {{detected}} {{more efficiently than}} a happy face. However, it is still controversial whether attentional allocation to angry faces is a bottom-up process or not. We investigated whether <b>the</b> anger <b>superiority</b> effect is influenced by top-down control, especially working memory (WM). Participants remembered a colour and then searched for differently coloured facial expressions. Just holding the colour information in WM did not modulate <b>the</b> anger <b>superiority</b> effect. However, when increasing the probabilities of trials in which the colour of a target face matched the colour held in WM, participants were inclined to direct attention to the target face regardless of the facial expression. Moreover, the knowledge of high probability of valid trials eliminated <b>the</b> anger <b>superiority</b> effect. These results suggest that <b>the</b> anger <b>superiority</b> effect is modulated by top-down effects of WM, the probability of events and expectancy about these probabilities...|$|R

5|$|Most ALF vapor cells use {{alkali metals}} {{because of their}} high vapor pressures; many alkali metals also have {{absorption}} lines and resonance in the desired spectra.

40|$|<b>The</b> word <b>superiority</b> {{effect is}} one of the most robust {{findings}} in English word recognition. It is commonly believed that the coarse-scale configurational information in a lexical context is more familiar to readers and therefore facilitates the identification of its component letters. Aiming at reassessing <b>the</b> character <b>superiority</b> effect in <b>the</b> Chinese language, this thesis first reports an empirical study determining the fundamental factor of stimulus presentation size by establishing the optimal retinal image size in normal Chinese reading. It then presents a series of experiments which examined if <b>the</b> Chinese character <b>superiority</b> can be obtained by using the stringent Reicher-Wheeler task and carefully manipulated stimulus conditions which featured impairment of spatial configuration information of characters to various degrees. The thesis further presents a study which investigated <b>the</b> character <b>superiority</b> effect in lateralized display and its neural correlates by comparing the event-related potenials (ERPs) to characters versus character-like stimuli. The findings show <b>the</b> character <b>superiority</b> over pseudocharacters and several types of character-like stimuli in central and lateralized dispaly. More importantly, a temporal-spatial profile was established for Chinese character recognition. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

5|$|ASL {{originated}} in the early 19th century in the American School for the Deaf (ASD) in Hartford, Connecticut, from a situation of language contact. Since then, ASL use has propagated widely via schools for the deaf and Deaf community organizations. Despite its wide use, no accurate count of ASL users has been taken, though reliable estimates for American ASL users range from 250,000 to 500,000 persons, including a number of children of deaf adults. ASL users face stigma due to beliefs in <b>the</b> <b>superiority</b> of oral language to sign language, {{compounded by the fact}} that ASL is often glossed in English due to the lack of a standard writing system.|$|E

However, according to Winifred Friedman, who has researched the Boydell Gallery, it was probably Joshua Reynolds's Royal Academy lectures on <b>the</b> <b>superiority</b> of history painting that influenced Boydell the most.|$|E
5|$|From early 1942, Tirpitz posed a {{significant}} {{threat to the}} Allied convoys transporting supplies through the Norwegian Sea to the Soviet Union.

5|$|Initially Gazan made rapid progress, but {{he quickly}} {{recognized}} that the opposing force was much stronger than the typical rearguard of a retreating army. Realizing he had been duped and that Gazan's troops were tiring rapidly, Mortier sent orders to Dupont's division to hurry forward. By mid-morning the French momentum had stalled; Mortier committed most of his remaining forces to driving Miloradovich back, leaving a single battalion—perhaps 300troops—to cover his northern flank, and sent the rest to attack the Russian right. Within 30minutes he achieved <b>the</b> <b>superiority</b> of numbers he sought. His 4,500French opposed 2,600Russians and forced them back toward Stein while pressing an attack along the river. Miloradovich had no option, for neither Strik's nor Dokhtorov's flanking columns were to be seen.|$|E
5|$|Lydiard {{remained}} cruising off Havana, and on 15 September sighted the French 84-gun Foudroyant. The Foudroyant, {{carrying the}} flag of Vice-Admiral Jean-Baptiste Willaumez, had been dismasted in a storm and was carrying a jury-rig. Despite <b>the</b> <b>superiority</b> of his opponent and the nearness of the shore Lydiard attempted to close on the French vessel and opened fire. Anson came under fire from the fortifications at Morro Castle, while several Spanish ships, including the 74-gun San Lorenzo, came out of Havana to assist the French. After being unable to manoeuvre into a favourable position and coming under heavy fire, Lydiard hauled away and made his escape. Anson had two killed and 13 wounded during the engagement, while the rigging was badly cut. Foudroyant meanwhile had 27 killed or wounded.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, the Persians adopted war engines from the Romans. The Romans had {{achieved}} and maintained {{a high degree}} of sophistication in siege warfare and had developed a range of siege machines. On the other hand, the Parthians were inept at besieging; their cavalry armies were more suited to the hit-and-run tactics that destroyed Antony's siege train in 36BC. The situation changed with the rise of the Sasanians, when Rome encountered an enemy equally skilled in siegecraft, who made use of artillery, machines captured from the Romans, embankments, siege towers, and in one instance, even an early form of gas warfare inside tunnels. Recent assessments comparing the Sasanians and Parthians have reaffirmed <b>the</b> <b>superiority</b> of Sasanian siegecraft, military engineering, and organization, as well as ability to build defensive works.|$|E

40|$|In visual search tasks, {{an angry}} face {{surrounded}} by happy faces is more rapidly detected {{compared with a}} happy face surrounded by angry faces. This is called <b>the</b> anger <b>superiority</b> effect. <b>The</b> anger <b>superiority</b> effect has been mainly related to automatic attentional effects, but top-down mechanisms may also influence this effect. In a series of studies, we investigated the influence of holding emotional information in working memory (WM) on <b>the</b> anger <b>superiority</b> effect. In multiple experiments, participants were generally faster to find an angry target with happy distractors compared to a happy target with angry distractors. However, this anger superiority effect was diminished when holding angry information in WM, whereas the effect was still observed when holding happy information. These effects were not observed when participants did not remember emotional information other than {{the color of the}} emotional stimuli. The data indicate that enhanced processing of distractor facial expressions was observed when they matched the content of WM, facilitating target detection. However, when the contents of WM and distractor faces differed, the processing of distractor faces and detection of a target face were delayed. These results suggest that <b>the</b> anger <b>superiority</b> effect is modulated by top-down effects of WM and that interactions between contents of WM and perception of facial expressions determine the enhancement or reduction of <b>the</b> anger <b>superiority</b> effect...|$|R

Cornel Pewewardy (Comanche-Kiowa), Professor and Director of Indigenous Nations Studies at Portland State University, cites indigenous mascots as an example of dysconscious racism which, by placing images of Native American or First Nations people into an invented media context, continues to maintain <b>the</b> <b>superiority</b> of the dominant culture.
