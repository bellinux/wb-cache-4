The configurational entropies in respective regimes can also be obtained from this thermodynamic treatment that leads us to a new “characteristic entropy constant which {{also seems to be}} indicative of configurational entropy. Comparison has also been made for the configurational entropies of supercooled and superheated liquid states.

40|$|A {{systematic}} assessment scheme <b>for</b> {{determining the}} <b>alkali</b> reactivity of aggregates {{has been developed}} for international use. Expansion tests were conducted on Irish aggregates. Aggregates were subjected to a sequence of <b>tests</b> <b>for</b> <b>alkali</b> reactivity: petrographic examination and mortar bar and concrete prism expansion testing. No cases of damaging alkali-silica reaction have been identified to date in Ireland {{despite the presence of}} chert in significant commercial sources. Chert-bearing Irish aggregates performed poorly in expansion tests despite an exemplary service record. Chert crystallinity was examined through domain size and quartz crystallinity index. The crystallinity study helped explain the apparently anomalous behavior of the aggregates in tests. A preliminary study of the effect of alkali loading provided confirming evidence. It is suggested that enhanced crystallinity raises the <b>alkali</b> threshold value <b>for</b> reaction to one intermediate between that experienced in practice and in tests...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of different correlation functionals has been <b>tested</b> <b>for</b> <b>alkali</b> metals, Li to Cs, interacting with cluster models simulating different active {{sites of the}} Si(111) surface. In all cases, the ab initio Hartree-Fock density has been obtained and used as a starting point. The electronic correlation energy is then introduced as an a posteriori correction to the Hartree-Fock energy using different correlation functionals. By making use of the ionic nature of the interaction and of different dissociation limits {{we have been able}} to prove that all functionals tested introduce the right correlation energy, although to a different extent. Hence, correlation functionals appear as an effective and easy way to introduce electronic correlation in the ab initio Hartree-Fock description of the chemisorption bond in complex systems where conventional configuration interaction techniques cannot be used. However, the calculated energies may differ by some tens of eV. Therefore, these methods can be employed to get a qualitative idea of how important correlation effects are, but they have some limitations if accurate binding energies are to be obtained...|$|R

In Malaysia, less than 30 % of the glass was recycle and causing solid waste impact to the environment. Research on using waste glass as aggregate has been attempted decades ago and recent research shows that it can be used as aggregate under certain measures to avoid alkali silica reaction damaging effect. In this study, the effectiveness of waste glass used as fine aggregate in mortar was studied. Four mixes mortar was prepared accordance to the percentage of replacement of 0 %, 10 %, 20 % and 30 % of waste glass as fine aggregate.

It was found out that the compressive strength and the porosity of the mortar with waste glass as fine aggregate achieved optimum result at 10 % of replacement.

This shows that waste glass was suitable for partially replacing fine aggregate in mortar...|$|R
40|$|There {{is a great}} lack of {{uniformity}} in {{the methods}} of <b>testing</b> soils <b>for</b> <b>alkali</b> salts and in the forms of expressing the results {{in a way that}} will show the relative toxicity of the salts. This has been pointed out by numerous investigators and has been shown to complicate the determinations so much that the results of different investigators are hardly comparable. It is of further disadvantage in that the toxic limits of an alkali as worked out by one system of analysis are often difficultly applicable to a soil that has been tested by another system. However, it is not easy to establish an arbitrary standard method because each method has advantages and disadvantages and each investigator probably uses the method that is most adapted to his own problem. It is doubtful if any methods now in use really give an accurate conception of the actual alkali composition of the soil solution. This bulletin reports some comparisons of different methods of testing alkali soils both as to results and relative variability, a study of some of the irregularities in the water-extraction method of <b>testing</b> <b>for</b> sodium carbonate, and a study of crop germination as an indication of alkalinity.

The new concrete prism tests from RILEM appear to reflect well the effects of types of aggregates, cement and pozzolanas. The mortar bar test ASTM C 227 also reflects well the effect of pozzolanas, however, it exhibits very low expansion for mixes with low alkali cement.

40|$|Alkaline Surfactant Polymer (ASP) {{process is}} a {{tertiary}} method of oil recovery that has promising results for future development. It has already been implemented in {{different areas of the}} United States such as Wyoming, west Texas, also in Canada and China. The success of this process depends on the proper combination of alkali, surfactant, and polymer and their compatibility with a reservoir. Therefore, the main objective of the proposed research is to identify chemical interactions between ASP chemicals and reservoir fluids and rock. I hypothesize that testing different alkalis, polymers and surfactants will result not only in getting different profiles of rheological properties of ASP system, but also analyzing compatibility degrees of chemicals with formation fluids and rock properties such as rock wettability, oil mobility and sweep efficiency which will be affected by the designed ASP system. In this paper the results of chemical interactions between ASP chemicals and reservoir fluids are presented and the phenomena occurred are described. The experiments conducted are considered to be unique for a selected oil sample with certain values of API gravity, viscosity, and chemical composition. Lab experiments conducted show the effect of polymer, alkali and surfactant addition to an aqueous solution. Polymers were tested with alkali as a function of shear rate {{for the purposes of the}} buildup water viscosity in EOR. Different types of alkali at different concentrations are <b>tested</b> <b>for</b> <b>alkali</b> optimal concentration determination. The effect of adding surfactant at different concentrations has been tested, and acidic number of tested oil sample was identified. Polymers tested with alkali result in non-Newtonian behavior of the testing solution and display a shear thinning beneficial effect for the buildup water viscosity in EOR. The results show that acidic number of crude oil is a critical parameter that affects the optimal concentration for mixing chemicals and interfacial tension profile. The alkali and surfactant added to crude oil result in a significant reduction of interfacial tension and lead to increase of oil mobilization which is a desired output after ASP injection in EOR process...|$|R
40|$|Alkali silica reation (ASR) is {{a common}} {{deterioration}} mechanism of concrete. During ASR, reactive aggregate containing silicon oxide (SiO 2) can react with the alkaline fluid in the concrete pores. To test whether a concrete mix is prone to ASR, several concrete prism tests (CPT) are developed. Performance tests are defined as a CPT where the alkali content in the concrete is {{comparable to that of}} a conventional concrete. During CPT, leaching or ingress of alkalis can affect the result of the test, as proven by Lindgård et al. (2013 b). However, Lindgård measured leaching and ingress by testing the leachate, lining and wrapping in the <b>test</b> container <b>for</b> <b>alkali,</b> but not the prisms themselves. In my master thesis project, I have investigated four concrete prisms that have been tested with different concrete prism performance tests. The prisms had experienced different degrees of leaching or ingress according to Lindgårds measurements. The prisms were cut and ground to give concrete powder samples that I tested using cold water extraction (CWE) and hot acid extraction (HAE). Aggregates were also ground and tested with these methods to account <b>for</b> <b>alkali</b> contribution from the aggregates during CWE and HAE. All samples were tested with thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) to investigate the paste content. CWE and HAE produced solutions which were measured <b>for</b> <b>alkali</b> content using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The results were compared to the expected alkali content in the prisms given from the alkali content in the cement from the recipe, minus the measured leaching or ingress. I have investigated all measurements and calculations, and calculated the error based on these. The calculations of errors are based on the principle of error propagation, and I assume all errors are uncorrelated. My results show that HAE is not suitable <b>for</b> measuring total <b>alkali</b> content. CWE does not measure the expected 50 - 60 % of the expected alkali content, but gives consistent results that are not affected by contribution from the aggregates. Free alkali content measured CWE has low errors. Leaching and ingress is indicated in the bulk samples, but the ground profiles does not give any conclusive evidence because of alkali redistribution due to drying. However, transportation of alkali {{from the top of the}} prisms to the bottom is indicated, aswell as leaching in the top and bottom surfaces of the prisms. Because I have not been able to measure the total alkali content, I am not able to prove alkali release from aggregates, due to HAE not being able to measure total <b>alkali</b> content. <b>For</b> a future study XRF should be used for this...|$|R

40|$|The aim of my Master Thesis was {{developing}} a reliable adhesion <b>testing</b> method <b>for</b> natural fiber reinforced composites. Flax fiber, synthetic viscose fiber, two different thermoset matrix and chemical surface treatment {{were used in}} this investigation. Bio-based Epobiox and basic epoxy, Envirez G 8600 INF- 60, were used as thermoset matrix. Chemical surface treatment increased the adhesion between the natural fiber and ther-moset resin. This Master Thesis was divided in theoretical part and experimental part. The purpose of the theoretical part was determining the factors affecting on the adhe-sion in natural fiber composites and how to improve the adhesion and how the adhesion can be tested. The aim of the experimental part is to obtain adhesion testing results, which were able to compare with each other. Micro-bond test {{was used as an}} adhesion testing method in which small amount of thermoset resin was cured on the fiber surface. The droplet was pulled out of the fiber surface by micrometer, which was connected to the tensile testing machine. Low cross head speed and 1 - 5 N load cell were used so that the fibers did not break during the test. The microbond test was difficult, because single fiber broke easily during the test. Only a few samples per each fiber-matrix combination were successful, where the interfacial shear strength, IFSS, can be calculated. A single fiber tensile <b>test</b> was done <b>for</b> <b>alkali</b> and silane treated flax fiber, non-treated flax fiber, viscose fiber and glass fiber.
