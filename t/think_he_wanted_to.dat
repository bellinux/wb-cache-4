500|$|In {{the spring}} of 449 BC, Pericles {{proposed}} the Congress Decree, {{which led to a}} meeting ("Congress") of all Greek states in order to consider the question of rebuilding the temples destroyed by the Persians. The Congress failed because of Sparta's stance, but Pericles' intentions remain unclear. Some historians think that he wanted to prompt a confederation with the participation of all the Greek cities; others <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> assert Athenian pre-eminence. According to the historian Terry Buckley the objective of the Congress Decree was a new mandate for the Delian League and for the collection of [...] "phoros" [...] (taxes).|$|E
500|$|In {{an unconstitutional}} though {{widespread}} practice during the Communist witchhunts, the U.S. State Department refused to renew Rossen's passport. This, and {{his inability to}} find work, brought Rossen, like his friend, ex-Communist Elia Kazan, back to the committee in May 1953, where he named 57 people as Communists. [...] He explained to the committee why he chose to testify: [...] "I don't think, {{after two years of}} thinking, that any one individual can indulge himself in the luxury of personal morality or pit it against what I feel today very strongly is the security and safety of this nation." [...] Stephen Rossen later shed light on his father's decision: [...] "It killed him not to work. He was torn between his desire to work and his desire not to talk, and he didn't know what to do. What I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> know was, what would I think of him if he talked? He didn't say it in that way, though. Then he explained to me the politics of it—how the studios were in on it, and there was never any chance of his working. He was under pressure, he was sick, his diabetes was bad, and he was drinking. By this time I understood that he had refused to talk before and had done his time, from my point of view. What could any kid say at that point? You say, 'I love you and I'm behind you.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Michael McCoy's 'Insider challenge' for {{the week}} was to ensure that he was {{nominated}} by eight Housemates in the next week's nominations. [...] Success would mean immunity from eviction {{for the week}}. [...] He spun a complex and fictitious tale of a son called Reuben and a paternity test supposedly taken shortly before he entered the House that revealed he was not (as he had believed for nearly nine years) Reuben's biological father, {{in a bid to}} make other Housemates <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> leave the house.|$|E
2500|$|The song [...] "Battlefield", {{from the}} This Is My Battlefield 2004 Panzer AG album samples Captain Rhodes asking Sarah in {{reference}} to Miguel's zombie bite: [...] "You <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> walk around after <b>he's</b> dead? You <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> be one of these things?" [...] The line [...] "Sit down or so help me god I'll have you shot" [...] appears once {{near the end of}} the song.|$|R

2500|$|Pickard {{explained}} Tony's {{reason for}} marrying Cindy saying: [...] "he’s {{looking forward to}} someone {{not so much to}} fall in love with, but for more practical reasons – so he lets himself be swept off his feet by Cindy". Shortly before the wedding Tony becomes intoxicated and has sex with a woman who Darren has paid. Tony admits this to Cindy who in turn admits she and Darren had been planning to scam Tony. Waring said Tony has [...] "been a good man telling the truth and Cindy takes that as her opportunity to tell him the truth. All the cards are on the table". Pickard said he was [...] "surprised that Tony would go through with it because of their volatile relationship and the fact that Tony knows Cindy's into Darren. I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> just go for it with her, and hopefully it'll work out for him". Pickard later stated that he didn't think Cindy was right for Tony stating: [...] "I don't think she's the one for him, to be honest". Tony meets Gabby Sharpe (Phina Oruche) which allows him to realise [...] "his marriage is over and he intends to tell Cindy that as soon as he gets home".|$|E
60|$|I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> utter {{his half}} {{finished}} proposal, and so bind her.|$|E
60|$|He did {{not express}} himself quite like this. He used {{gestures}} instead of adjectives, and he halted. I have put {{into my own}} words what I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> say.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{mean about}} his letting me <b>think</b> <b>he</b> didn't ca'e for me, so long. But don't you <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> {{do what is}} right! Mr. Gregory, I mean." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, dear. I don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> {{quarrel with}} any one;--but above all {{he must not}} quarrel with me. Lord Fawn has quarrelled with him, and that's a misfortune,--just for the present." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Beatem, Beatem, {{come over}} to my room. This man is {{absolutely}} the biggest thing in America. For sheer calmness and nerve I never heard of anything to approach him. What do you <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> do?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Really, I <b>think,</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> see you, but I wasn't {{going to}} let him. Not until to-night, when you're going to burst upon every one like King Solomon in his glory! Come on! WE'RE GOING TO SHOP!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not matter?" [...] said Adam, gravely. [...] "You {{seemed very}} frightened about it. I'll hold it till you're {{ready to take}} it," [...] he added, quietly closing his hand over it, that she might not <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> look at it again.|$|E
6000|$|... "What do I make of it? Can't you see, Sam? Tom {{was trying}} to <b>think.</b> <b>He</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> get {{something}} that was hidden away in his memory--his own name, and mine and yours, and Nellie's, {{and the name of}} Brill. Maybe a flash of his real self came back to him." ...|$|E
50|$|Madge Capehorn née Edwards: {{passenger}} on the bus, pregnant, {{riding with}} her husband, forever {{jealous of the}} woman her husband married, and of Jackie, whom she thinks her husband <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> marry. She usually finds the worst interpretation of other people.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{not sure}} of {{anything}} but YOU. But I have, since last evening, a new hope. I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> give me an opening. I do believe that--poor little exquisite wretch!--he <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> speak. Last evening, in the firelight and the silence, he sat with me for two hours {{as if it were}} just coming." ...|$|R
50|$|After {{the girls}} are paid just $10 for a performance, Bobby Angel gambles with her sisters' money and wins $190. But she is conned out of it by Happy, whose band needs it to make a trip to Brooklyn to perform at a club. Bobby <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> both hire and romance her, neither of which is true.|$|R
6000|$|... "Miles {{has more}} pith in him than ever poor old Raymond had," [...] said Phil. [...] "Poor old Poynsett, I used to <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> be spoony on you, Joan, {{if he had}} only known his own mind. If he had, I suppose {{he would have been}} alive now!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Leslie {{passed her}} up the gangway," [...] said another man, adding, with a suggestive laugh as he {{answered}} another question: [...] "Why did he do it? Well, perhaps he's had his fortune told, or you can ask him. Anyway, although I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to,</b> he dared not turn her back." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, no! The rascal is {{come over}} to my side. What do you <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> say? That {{he had been to}} look at my grandfather's will, and he thinks you could drive a coach and horses through it; and he proposes to me to upset it, and come in as heir-at-law! The scoundrel!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'I don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> drive,' Bud says, considerin'. An' the rube says quick, 'You betcher life I do.' 'You're dead {{sure you}} want that job?' I says. Yes, he's dead sure. Nothin's goin' to keep him away from that job. Why, that job's what he come to town for, an' we can't lead him to it too quick.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Winters, whom I shall always hate for it, {{has been}} telling that at some battle in Virginia, where he got his hurt, you were seen {{crouching}} behind a tree. I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> injure you in my regard, which he knows the story would do if I believed it. I could bear to hear of my soldier lover's death, but not of his cowardice." ...|$|R
5000|$|Cody Custer - If you've got a bull that you're {{going to}} look at and say I'd like to own a bull like that, he's one that every guy <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> be stock {{contractor}} would want that a bull and every guy that <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> be a great bull rider would say that's the bull that I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> get on, that's the bull that I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> ride.|$|R
6000|$|I heard Cavor's {{voice in}} alarm and entreaty. Even then I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> {{compromise}} with these creatures. [...] "I say, Bedford," [...] he cried, [...] "I know a way!" [...] But {{the sting of}} that second stab seemed to set free some pent-up reserve of energy in my being. Instantly the link of the wrist-chain snapped, and with it snapped all considerations that had held us unresisting {{in the hands of}} these moon creatures. For that second, at least, I was mad with fear and anger. I took no thought of consequences. I hit straight out at the face of the thing with the goad. The chain was twisted round my fist.|$|E
60|$|He was so set in his {{own opinion}} on this point of position, that we were afraid we should be obliged to give the thing up. He used very good arguments, too. He {{said that he had}} been elected to his present office by his fellow Africans; that he had held it a long time; that he didn't think the rest of his people wanted him to give it up, and he didn't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> give it up himself. A prime {{minister}} might be all very well, but he didn't know anything about it. He knew what it was to be governor, and was very well satisfied to leave things as they were.|$|E
60|$|The {{truth of}} that was very soon in evidence. Cubby would not let well enough alone, {{and he would not}} have a slack rope. I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> choke himself or pull my arms out. When I {{realized}} that Cubby was three times as strong as I was I began to see that my work was cut out for me. The more, however, that he jerked me and hauled me along, the more I determined to hang on. I thought I had a genuine love for him up to the time he had almost knocked my head off, but it was funny how easily he roused my anger after that. What would have happened had he taken a notion to go through the brush? Luckily he kept to the trail, which certainly was rough enough. So, with watching the cub and keeping my feet free of roots and rocks, I had no chance to look ahead. Still I had no concern about this, for the old hunter was at my heels, and I knew he would keep a sharp lookout.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, now, that's very nice; you can't {{go beyond}} perfect, you know. I {{did do it}} pretty well, didn't I? Poor Mr. Brandreth! Have you seen him? You must say {{something}} comforting to him. He's really been sacrificed in this business. You know <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> Miss Chapley. She {{would have made a}} lovely Juliet. Of course she blames him for it. She <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> make up to Miss Northwick, when Miss Northwick was just flinging herself at Jack. Look at her!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because he is a brute," [...] she {{answered}} quietly. [...] "We have been separated {{for more than}} a year. I <b>think</b> that <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> marry again." ...|$|R

60|$|You are {{figuring}} me, I hope, as a {{dark and}} sullen lout in shabby, cheap, old-world clothes that are shiny at all the wearing surfaces, and with a discolored red tie and frayed linen. My left hand keeps in my pocket as though there is something it prefers to keep a grip upon there. Mr. Gabbitas was shorter than I, and the first note he struck in the impression he made upon any one was of something bright and birdlike. I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> be birdlike, he possessed {{the possibility of an}} avian charm, but, as a matter of fact, there was nothing of the glowing vitality of the bird in his being. And a bird is never out of breath and with an open mouth. He was in the clerical dress of that time, that costume that seems now almost the strangest of all our old-world clothing, and he presented it in its cheapest form--black of a poor texture, ill-fitting, strangely cut. Its long skirts accentuated the tubbiness of his body, the shortness of his legs. The white tie below his all-round collar, beneath his innocent large-spectacled face, was a little grubby, and between his not very clean teeth he held a briar pipe. His complexion was whitish, and although he was only thirty-three or four perhaps, his sandy hair was already thinning from the top of his head.|$|E
60|$|We {{made up a}} {{party and}} walked over. It's at {{the western end of}} the town, and about a mile from the hotel. Mr. and Mrs. Chipperton were with us, and a lady from Chicago, and Mr. Burgan. The other yellow-legs went out riding with his wife, but I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> go with us. The fort is {{on the top of a}} hill, and a colored {{shoemaker}} is in command. He sits and cobbles all day, except when visitors come, and then he shows them around. He lighted a lamp and took us down into the dark, quiet rooms and cells, that were cut out of the solid rock, down deep into the hill, and it was almost like being in a coal-mine, only it was a great deal cleaner and not so deep. But it seemed just as much out of the world. In some of the rooms there were bats hanging to the ceilings. We didn't disturb them. One of the rooms was called the governor's room. There wasn't any governor there, of course, but it had been made by the jolly old earl who had the place cut out,--and who was governor here at the time,--as a place where he might retire when he wanted to be private. It was the most private apartment I ever saw. This earl was the same old Dunmore we used to study about in our histories. He came over here when the Revolution threw him out of business in our country. He had some good ideas about chiselling rock.|$|E
6000|$|The {{work was}} put in hand at once, and Philip felt quite a thrill of {{satisfaction}} {{when he saw the}} costume completed. The buyer and Mrs. Hodges took all the credit of it; but he did not care, and when he went with them to the Tivoli to see Miss Antonia wear {{it for the first time}} he was filled with elation. In answer to her questions he at last told Mrs. Hodges how he had learnt to draw--fearing that the people he lived with would <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> put on airs, he had always taken the greatest care to say nothing about his past occupations--and she repeated the information to Mr. Sampson. The buyer said nothing to him on the subject, but began to treat him a little more deferentially and presently gave him designs to do for two of the country customers. They met with satisfaction. Then he began to speak to his clients of a [...] "clever young feller, Paris art-student, you know," [...] who worked for him; and soon Philip, ensconced behind a screen, in his shirt sleeves, was drawing from morning till night. Sometimes he was so busy that he had to dine at three with the 'stragglers.' He liked it, because there were few of them and they were all too tired to talk; the food also was better, for it consisted of what was left over from the buyers' table. Philip's rise from shop-walker to designer of costumes had a great effect on the department. He realised that he was an object of envy. Harris, the assistant with the queer-shaped head, who was the first person he had known at the shop and had attached himself to Philip, could not conceal his bitterness.|$|E

The woman though has an amazing singing voice. By meeting her, Kohei begins <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> make music again.|$|R
5000|$|In 2013 Varney {{generated}} controversy for his {{commentary on}} Pope Francis, who had criticized the wealth gap and denounced unfettered capitalism {{as a system}} which [...] "rules rather than serves." [...] Varney stated, [...] "I go to church to save my soul. It’s {{got nothing to do}} with my vote. Pope Francis has linked the two. He has offered direct criticism of a specific political system. He has characterized, negatively, that system. I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> influence my politics." ...|$|R
