500|$|According to Casting Crowns' lead vocalist Mark Hall, {{the concept}} for Come to the Well is the song [...] "The Well". Hall wrote the song {{based on the}} Biblical story of [...] "woman at the well {{and the fact that}} she was {{standing}} there talking to Jesus about water and Jesus was talking to her about water, but they weren't talking about the same water". Hall noted that, in his life, [...] "when I come to Jesus, I've already got my well figured out, I've already got what I <b>think</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to sustain me, I just need him to sprinkle some magic Jesus dust on it and make it work. We have our wells figured and we want Jesus to fix our wells, but our wells are really holes in the ground". Hall argued that instead of using that approach, Christians should [...] "start with Jesus, then we go to the world", and said that approach is what the album is about. In writing the album, Hall worked with outside songwriters Steven Curtis Chapman, Matthew West, and Tom Douglas on several tracks; he received writing credit on eleven out of the album's twelve tracks, the exception being [...] "Face Down", which was penned by Hector Cervantes and Marc Byrd.|$|E
500|$|Upon Burton's casting, it was {{revealed}} by MSN that Dylan, who was described as [...] "the mysterious ex Avery keeps bringing up" [...] by Jillian Bowe of Zap2it, {{would be involved in}} a love triangle with his ex-girlfriend Avery Bailey Clark (Jessica Collins) and her current lover, Nicholas Newman (Joshua Morrow). Of Dylan's storyline and involvement in the love triangle, Phelps said: [...] "Dylan does come to town to find Avery but this story has much more complexity than that [...] What you <b>think</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to happen is not what's going to happen." [...] She noted that Avery was the [...] "great love of his life", though she may not have [...] "the same feelings for him." [...] Avery believed that Dylan died during war; TVLine commented that [...] "such a resurrection" [...] would [...] "surely" [...] derail her romance with Nick. During an interview with MSN, Burton said, [...] "Nick and Dylan will definitely fight for her, but ultimately, it's going to be her choice." [...] Dylan and Avery had an affair while she was still married to her ex-husband, but still had a [...] "great relationship", which was shown through flashbacks. Dylan's primary goal in coming to Genoa City was to make sure she was happy, and if she wanted to get back together. Burton said that Dylan can't get Avery off his mind {{despite the fact that she}} had moved on.|$|E

500|$|In May 2011, it was {{revealed}} that Susan and Karl's marriage would be run into trouble, when Susan becomes emotionally involved with another man. Susan strikes up a friendship with local builder, Jim Dolan (Scott Parmeter), as he fights cancer, causing problems between herself and Karl. When asked by Channel 5 about her reaction to the storyline, Woodburne said [...] "I think it's a great story. Karl and Susan are both in their 50s; they've been married together; they've raised a bunch of kids; they’ve had careers and jobs. And to use the popular term 'empty nesters', that's what they’re looking at. For him he thinks, 'That's great, terrific! More time for us; we can travel.' But for her it's, 'Well, I don't know how to be that person. I know how to be this person, who's someone who's wrangling kids and busy doing things.' But her challenge I <b>think</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to be to find out who she is as one half of a couple, as opposed to being the hub of a wheel." [...] The actress revealed she and Fletcher were both worried about Susan and Karl breaking up and having to work with new people, but they believe any new development for the characters is good. Woodburne told Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy that she thought the new storyline was great and said any relationship which has been going {{for as long as the}} Kennedys' has, will have its [...] "turbulent patches". Woodburne said Susan develops a very strong attachment to Jim because of her desire to help and be needed. When asked if she was worried about revisiting old ground with the storyline, Woodburne said the new conflict, which arises within Karl and Susan's relationship, is [...] "very appropriate" [...] for the time of their lives and where they are at.|$|E

2500|$|During the {{off-season}} break after the 2016 season, Oliver failed a roadside random breath test whereby probationary (P-plate) drivers require a zero blood alcohol content; he escaped club suspension, but was fined an undisclosed amount. He lost five kilograms during pre-season training {{in which he}} credited his drink driving charge as a key driver behind wanting to improve his training standards. His drive during the pre-season drew public praise from his teammates including Aaron vandenBerg and Tom McDonald, and Melbourne's development and strategy coach, Brendan McCartney, who all stated they believed Oliver was the player to watch for the 2017 season as he could take his [...] "game to new heights." [...] Furthermore, former Melbourne captain, Garry Lyon, nominated Oliver as the player who could surpass all of his teammates {{in the future to}} become the club's best player by stating on SEN Breakfast's, [...] "they've got a great group of youngsters coming through ... and there's a boy called Clayton Oliver who I <b>think</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to be better than all of them ... this guy is so good and clean in tight that I don't think most people—and I'm not putting him down—but unless you take a particular interest in the kid, you can't see how good he is." ...|$|E
2500|$|Murray {{never played}} much {{basketball}} before the show, and was more into football while in high school. Because of this, a basketball coach was hired for Murray {{in order to}} improve his basketball skills. To go along with the character's personality, a [...] "sedate" [...] wardrobe was designed. Schwahn said of Lucas's wardrobe, [...] "...He was a Levi's guy. He was, you know, he wore a lot of, like, plain T-shirts and things because we just wanted him to represent the everyman." [...] Despite having the character start out this way, the series eventually let his wardrobe evolve. Starting from the fourth season on, he was given some [...] "wilder stuff". Schwahn clarified, [...] "You know, he can [...] rock something from Sean John, which normally would have been Nathan's department." [...] He said the style of the characters really does evolve on the show, especially with the four-year timeline jump. [...] "Diesel is so wonderful on [...] Diesel jeans. It's an Italian company. A lot of times, Italian designers cut much more slimly...for a really lean physique," [...] stated One Tree Hill's costume designer, Carol Cutshall. [...] "Also, this year, they’ve had nice long sleeves and nice long shirts and really slim clothing and that looks best on [...] He doesn’t need to be swallowed up. He's got his own style as a person. It's not just up to me. I try to bring in what I <b>think</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to fit him best." [...] With the timeline jump, Lucas’s main brands become Diesel, Guess menswear, and Juicy Couture for men.|$|E
