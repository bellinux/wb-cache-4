5|$|However, in non-technical {{contexts}} and in software for <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Wide</b> Web, the term URL remains widely used. Additionally, the term web address (which has no formal definition) often occurs in non-technical publications as {{a synonym for}} a URI that uses the scheme http or https. Such assumptions can lead to confusion, for example {{in the case of}} XML namespaces, which have a visual similarity to resolvable URIs.|$|E

The foundation collaborated with international institutions, British and Scandinavian bilateral aid organizations, and other NGOs such as <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Wide</b> Fund for Nature (WWF).

5|$|Over {{the next}} {{three and a half}} years, as <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Wide</b> Web's core {{technologies}} of HTML, HTTP, and web browsers developed, a need to distinguish a string that provided an address for a resource from a string that merely named a resource emerged. Although not yet formally defined, the term Uniform Resource Locator came to represent the former, and the more contentious Uniform Resource Name came to represent the latter.|$|E
5|$|Such {{identification}} enables {{interaction with}} {{representations of the}} resource over a network, typically <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Wide</b> Web, using specific protocols. Schemes specifying a concrete syntax and associated protocols define each URI. The {{most common form of}} URI is the Uniform Resource Locator (URL), frequently referred to informally as a web address. More rarely seen in usage is the Uniform Resource Name (URN), which was designed to complement URLs by providing a mechanism for the identification of resources in particular namespaces.|$|E
