5|$|On 13 August 2010, {{the country}} {{witnessed}} floods causing deaths of 1,600 people and affecting 14 million lives.

5|$|Following the United States' win at the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup, Rapinoe and her {{teammates}} {{became the first}} women's sports team to be honored with a ticker tape parade in New York City. Each player received {{a key to the}} city from Mayor Bill de Blasio. In October of the same year, the team was honored by President Barack Obama at the White House, and <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>made</b> note of the Northern California farm that had built a corn maze in the shape of Rapinoe's face.|$|E
5|$|The first White House Astronomy Night {{was held}} on the South Lawn on October 7, 2009. This first event coincided with the International Year of Astronomy. Science Advisor to the President John Holdren stood next to President Obama as <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>made</b> a speech wherein he {{emphasized}} the values of science education and how crucial it was to society to increase the interest of youth towards studying science. This was {{an attempt by the}} White House to increase motivation for children to enter science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. Only optical telescopes were used to peer at the heavens during the events. Over twenty such telescopes were placed on the South Lawn of the White House in addition to displays of Moon rocks, meteorites, and presentations of the Solar System.|$|E

25|$|As {{the meeting}} progressed, {{a new plan}} emerged, and Kennedy was slowly persuaded. The new plan called for him to ignore the latest message and instead to return to Khrushchev's earlier one. Kennedy was {{initially}} hesitant, feeling that Khrushchev would no longer accept the deal because a new one had been offered, but Llewellyn Thompson {{argued that it was}} still possible. White House Special Counsel and Adviser Ted Sorensen and Robert Kennedy left the meeting and returned 45minutes later, with a draft letter to that effect. <b>The</b> <b>President</b> <b>made</b> several changes, had it typed, and sent it.|$|E
25|$|The year 1848 was {{the year}} of {{revolution}} all over Europe; revolutions broke out in numerous countries, beginning in France. King Louis-Philippe, fearful of sharing the fate of Louis XVI, fled to England. The oath of allegiance was abolished, and the road to an academic appointment was finally clear for Cauchy. On March 1, 1849, he was reinstated at the Faculté de Sciences, {{as a professor of}} mathematical astronomy. After political turmoil all through 1848, France chose to become a Republic, under the Presidency of Louis Napoleon Bonaparte, nephew of Napoleon Bonaparte, and son of Napoleon's brother, who had been installed as the first king of Holland. Soon (early 1852) <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>made</b> himself Emperor of France, and took the name Napoleon III.|$|E
25|$|After many years, Asad {{was again}} invited by another President of Pakistan, General Zia ul-Haq, in 1983 {{and that was}} his last visit to this country. When he arrived at Islamabad, which {{he had not yet}} seen, he was {{received}} at the plane with great honour and escorted to the Presidency. During his sojourn in Islamabad, there was a series of meetings with members of the Ansari Commission in order to prepare a kind of programme for the President for the future. Asad agreed with some, and as usual disagreed with others, which he found retrograde. On one point he was firm and insistent that Muslim women should have exactly the same rights in the political sphere as had men, to the extent of becoming Prime Minister. Asad also spared some time to meet with his surviving friends in Lahore and Islamabad and at the request of <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>made</b> several radio and television appearances, as always spontaneous. On his return, he was besieged by letters from literally hundreds of admirers in Pakistan, offering him land, a house, everything but he refused politely, as his concept of Pakistan was beyond all these worldly trivialities.|$|E

25|$|In 1806 he {{negotiated}} the Monroe–Pinkney Treaty with Great Britain. It would have extended the Jay Treaty of 1794 which had expired after ten years. Jefferson had fought the Jay Treaty intensely in 1794–95 {{because he felt}} it would allow the British to subvert American republicanism. The treaty had produced ten years of peace and highly lucrative trade for American merchants, but Jefferson was still opposed. When Monroe and the British signed the new treaty in December 1806, Jefferson refused to submit it to the Senate for ratification. Although the treaty called for ten more years of trade between the United States and the British Empire and gave American merchants guarantees {{that would have been}} good for business, Jefferson was unhappy that it did not end the hated British practice of impressment, and refused to give up the potential weapon of commercial warfare against Britain. <b>The</b> <b>president</b> <b>made</b> no attempt to obtain another treaty, and as a result, the two nations drifted from peace toward the War of 1812. Monroe was severely pained by the administration's repudiation of the treaty, and he fell out with Secretary of State James Madison.|$|E
500|$|Although brief, the Philadelphia transit {{strike of}} 1944 had {{significant}} {{negative impact on}} the war effort, resulting in a loss of four million work hours in war plants alone. The War Manpower Commission estimated that the Philadelphia strike cost the nation's war production the equivalent of 267 Flying Fortresses or five destroyers. Malcolm Ross later characterized the strike as [...] "the most expensive racial dispute of World War II". The strike also exposed the limitations of the FEPC's power. The FEPC did not possess the final authority to enforce its decisions and only the executive intervention of <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>made</b> the resolution of the dispute possible. Nevertheless, the strike demonstrated that a combination of black activism, particularly by the NAACP, together with resolute federal policies, were able to break long standing racial barriers in employment.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{civil service}} reform, a {{president}} {{had a large}} number of posts to fill. [...] It was customary at the time to fill many of the lower level positions with party political workers. Hanna had a voice in some of McKinley's appointments, but <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>made</b> the final decision. [...] Hanna was allowed to recommend candidates for the majority of federal positions in Ohio, and was permitted a veto over Foraker's candidates. [...] Hanna was also dominant in the South, where there were few Republican congressmen to lobby the President. [...] He and McKinley decided on a system where many southern appointees were recommended by the state's member of the Republican National Committee and the defeated Republican congressional candidate for the area in question. [...] Hanna and McKinley gave few places to those who had served under Harrison, as the two presidents were not friendly. [...] "Silver Republicans", who had bolted the party at the convention or later, received nothing.|$|E
50|$|This was {{the single}} largest gain by any President's party in House midterm {{elections}} in US history, and the only time <b>the</b> <b>President's</b> party <b>made</b> gains of 10 seats or more in such an election.|$|R

500|$|In 1994, Paula Jones {{initiated}} {{a sexual harassment}} lawsuit against Clinton, claiming that he made unwanted advances towards her in 1991; Clinton denied the allegations. In April 1998, the case was initially dismissed by Judge Susan Webber Wright {{on the grounds that}} it lacked legal merit. Jones appealed Webber Wright's ruling, and her suit gained traction following Clinton's admission to having an affair with Monica Lewinsky in August 1998. In 1998, lawyers for Paula Jones released court documents that alleged a pattern of sexual harassment by Clinton when he was Governor of Arkansas. Robert S. Bennett, Clinton's main lawyer for the case, called the filing [...] "a pack of lies" [...] and [...] "an organized campaign to smear the President of the United States" [...] funded by Clinton's political enemies. Clinton later agreed to an out-of-court settlement and paid Jones $850,000. Bennett said that <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>made</b> the settlement only so he could end the lawsuit for good and move on with his life. During the deposition for the Jones lawsuit, which was held at the White House, Clinton denied having sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky – a denial that became the basis for an impeachment charge of perjury.|$|E
500|$|As {{the general}} {{election}} season began, Nixon focused his efforts on the [...] "big seven" [...] states: California, Illinois, Michigan, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Texas. He hired Roger Ailes, whom he had first encountered during an appearance on The Mike Douglas Show, to produce one hour television programs to advertise the campaign in strategic regions. The campaign also continued to use televised town hall segments throughout the campaign, which aired live, featuring real voters whom were instructed to ask tough questions, following the campaign's belief that Nixon would respond well to such questions. Starting the ground campaign tour, during his first stop in Springfield, Illinois, he discussed the importance of unity, stating that [...] "America [...] needs to be united more than any time since Lincoln." [...] He then traveled to Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania before returning to New York, meeting with Governor Rockefeller. In those Gallup polls following the convention, Nixon led Humphrey 45% to 29% and topped McCarthy 42% to 37%. At {{the end of the}} month, Hubert Humphrey narrowly won Democratic presidential nominee over McCarthy at the Democratic convention, which was filled with protest and riots. Analysts saw the Democrat's split, along with lacking [...] "law and order" [...] at the convention, positioning Nixon well. Shortly before the convention and throughout {{the general election}}, Nixon received regular briefings from President Johnson on developments in the Vietnam War. <b>The</b> <b>President</b> <b>made</b> it clear to Nixon {{that he did not want}} the war to be politicized, to which Nixon agreed, although questioning Humphrey's eventual compliance.|$|E
2500|$|On 4 January 2007, Bainimarama {{restored}} Ratu Josefa Iloilo to the Presidency. [...] <b>The</b> <b>President</b> <b>made</b> {{a broadcast}} endorsing {{the actions of}} the military.

2500|$|A further {{part of the}} {{misconception}} is {{that the}} audience to his speech laughed at his supposed error. They instead cheered and applauded both times the phrase was used. They laughed and cheered a few seconds after the first use of the phrase, only when <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>made</b> an intentional joke. Poking fun at his own pronunciation of the phrase, he said, [...] "I appreciate my interpreter translating my German!" ...|$|E

2500|$|According to two American {{officials}} {{who are involved in}} Afghan issues said that the senior American commander in Afghanistan, General John Allen wanted to keep a significant military capability through the fighting season ending in fall 2013, which could translate to a force of more than 60,000 troops until the end of that period. The United States has not [...] "begun considering any specific recommendations for troop numbers in 2013 and 2014," [...] said George Little, the Pentagon spokesman. [...] "What is true is that in June 2011 <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>made</b> clear that our forces would continue to come home at a steady pace as we transition to an Afghan lead for security.

2500|$|According to Lord Moran, {{during the}} war years Churchill sought solace in his tumbler of whisky and soda and his cigar. Churchill was also a very {{emotional}} man, unafraid to shed tears when appropriate. During some of his broadcast speeches it was noticed {{that he was trying to}} hold back the tears. Nevertheless, although the fall of Tobruk was, by Churchill's own account [...] "one of the heaviest blows" [...] he received {{during the war}}, there seem to have been no tears. Certainly, the next day Moran found him animated and vigorous. Field Marshal Alanbrooke, Chief of the Imperial General Staff, who had been present when President Roosevelt broke the news of the tragedy to Churchill, focused afterwards in his diary on the superbly well judged manner in which <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>made</b> his offer of immediate military assistance, despite Alanbrooke's being ever ready to highlight what he perceived to be Churchill's contradictory motivations and flawed character during the war.
