5|$|In {{the early}} years in western Virginia, pioneer {{settlers}} were primarily concerned with providing defense from Native American attacks, so little emphasis was placed upon education. Education {{was viewed as a}} religious duty, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>provided</b> <b>for</b> at home, where its quality was dependent upon the spare time and level of education of parents. With the growth of settlement in Pearsall's Flats, and later Romney, the need for educational facilities became apparent and the community began plans for the establishment of schools and churches.|$|E

Following reunification, the Berlin offices of the German Chancellery and the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs moved into the building. In January 1993, after a legal decision, the Federal Government returned the building to the Federal State of Berlin, which wished {{to use it for}} its original purpose of city administration. However, it first urgently required refurbishment; under the GDR, upkeep had been neglected and the plumbing facilities, for example, dated in part to the 1920s.

5|$|Although kings, {{rulers and}} {{powerful}} {{people have always}} been able to pay for entertainment <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>provided</b> <b>for</b> them and in many cases have paid for public entertainment, people generally have made their own entertainment or when possible, attended a live performance. Technological developments in the 20th century meant that entertainment could be produced independently of the audience, packaged and sold on a commercial basis by an entertainment industry. Sometimes referred to as show business, the industry relies on business models to produce, market, broadcast or otherwise distribute many of its traditional forms, including performances of all types. The industry became so sophisticated that its economics became a separate area of academic study.|$|E

5|$|Peter then {{returned}} to Constantinople with letters from Theodahad and the Roman Senate to the imperial couple, bearing pleas for a peaceful solution, {{but by the time}} he reached the imperial capital, Emperor Justinian had resolved on war and was preparing his forces. Consequently, Peter returned to Italy in the summer of 535 conveying an ultimatum: only if Theodahad abdicated and returned Italy to imperial rule, could war be averted. A two-pronged Byzantine offensive followed soon thereafter, attacking the outlying possessions of the Ostrogothic kingdom: Belisarius took Sicily, while Mundus invaded Dalmatia. Upon hearing these news, Theodahad despaired, and Peter was able to secure wide-ranging concessions from him: Sicily was to be ceded to the Byzantine Empire; the Gothic king's authority within Italy was severely restricted; a gold crown was to be sent as an annual tribute and up to 3,000 men were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>provided</b> <b>for</b> the imperial army, underlining Theodahad's subject status. Theodahad, however, fearing that his first offer would be rejected, then instructed Peter, under oath, to offer the cession of all Italy, but only if the original concessions were rejected by Justinian. In the event, Justinian rejected the first proposal, and was delighted to learn of the second one. Peter was sent back to Italy with Athanasius, bearing letters to Theodahad and the Gothic nobles, and for a time it seemed as if the cradle of the Roman Empire would return peacefully to the fold. It was not to be: upon their arrival in Ravenna, the Byzantine envoys found Theodahad in a changed disposition. Supported by the Gothic nobility and buoyed up by a success against Mundus in Dalmatia, he resolved to resist, and imprisoned the ambassadors.|$|E

25|$|The Royal Navy Dockyard was {{initially}} located around Dockyard Creek, and occupied {{several of the}} dockyard buildings formerly used by the Knights of Malta.

25|$|The third {{prototype}} to fly, {{serial number}} B9965, had modified wings, {{with a wider}} centre-section and a smaller cutout for the pilot, while the fuselage had a fully circular section, rather than the slab-sided {{one of the first}} two aircraft, and the tail was smaller. It was officially tested in December 1917, reaching a speed of 119mph (192km/h), and was then rebuilt with longer-span (30ft (9.14 m)) two-bay wings (compared with the 25ft 9in (7.85 m) single bay wings). This allowed the Snipe to compete for Air Board Specification A.1(a) for a high-altitude single-seat fighter. This specification required a speed of at least 135mph (225km/h) at 15,000ft (4,573 m) and a ceiling of at least 25,000ft (7,620 m) while carrying an armament of two fixed and one swivelling machine gun.

25|$|The {{renewal of}} serious Viking {{attacks in the}} reign of Æthelred the Unready led to a general muster of ships at London in 992 against the fleet of Olaf Tryggvason, but amid {{confusion}} and alleged treachery the English fleet suffered heavy losses. In 1008, Æthelred ordered a new programme of naval construction, under which one warship was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>provided</b> <b>for</b> every 310 hides {{of land in the}} kingdom. In 1009 the king took the new fleet out to Sandwich to guard against the threat of invasion (this port, near the junction of the North Sea and the English Channel and lying within the sheltered offshore anchorage of the Downs, appears frequently in the sources for this period as a position where fleets were stationed on guard). However, this deployment ended in disaster due to internal dissension. Accusations against the great Sussex thegn Wulfnoth (probably the father of Godwin, later Earl of Wessex) led to his flight from the fleet with 20 ships manned by his supporters. A force of 80 ships sent after him was wrecked by a storm and the beached ships burnt by Wulfnoth, after which the remainder of the fleet dispersed in confusion.|$|E
