5|$|At {{the time}} British law {{relating}} to marriage {{was based on}} the legal doctrine of coverture, in which a woman's legal rights and obligations were subsumed by those of her husband upon their matrimony. By law a woman had no separate legal existence, and all her property became her husband's; divorce initiated by a woman was difficult and complicated. In April 1868 Josephine and fellow suffragist Elizabeth Wolstenholme set up and became joint secretaries of <b>the</b> <b>Married</b> Women's Property Committee to pressure parliament into changing the law. Josephine remained on the committee until the campaign was successful, with the passing into law of <b>the</b> <b>Married</b> Women's Property Act 1882.|$|E

The Brittens are a nuclear family consisting of <b>the</b> <b>married</b> couple Michael and Hannah and their child son Rex. The family {{was involved in a}} car crash, which caused Michael, to live in two separate realities, one in which his wife Hannah was killed in the crash, and in the other his son Rex was killed.|$|E
5|$|The Country Wife is more neatly {{constructed}} {{than most}} Restoration comedies, but {{is typical of}} its time and place in having three sources and three plots. The separate plots are interlinked but distinct, each projecting a sharply different mood. They may be schematised as Horner's impotence trick, <b>the</b> <b>married</b> life of Pinchwife and Margery, and the courtship of Harcourt and Alithea.|$|E

5|$|First-wave {{feminism}} was {{a period}} of activity during the 19th century and early twentieth century. In the UK and eventually the US, it focused on the promotion of equal contract, marriage, parenting, and property rights for women. By the end of the 19th century, a number of important steps had been made with the passing of legislation such as the UK Custody of Infants Act 1839 which introduced the Tender years doctrine for child custody arrangement and gave woman the right of custody of their children for the first time. Other legislation such as <b>the</b> <b>Married</b> Women's Property Act 1870 in the UK and extended in the 1882 Act, these became models for similar legislation in other British territories. For example, Victoria passed legislation in 1884, New South Wales in 1889, and the remaining Australian colonies passed similar legislation between 1890 and 1897. Therefore, with the turn of the 19th century activism had focused primarily on gaining political power, particularly the right of women's suffrage, though some feminists were active in campaigning for women's sexual, reproductive, and economic rights as well.|$|E

His parents, William—a {{corporal}} in the Royal Garrison Artillery—and Marion Hammond (née Crisp), lived in <b>the</b> <b>married</b> quarters at Dover Castle where Walter was born.

5|$|In 1922, a workers' tent {{camp was}} erected {{on the eastern}} side of Stirling Ridge to house the men working on the main intercepting sewer. The {{following}} year saw the start of the construction of 62 small, four-room, unlined timber cottages, to be used as housing for <b>the</b> <b>married</b> tradesmen involved {{in the construction of the}} provisional Parliament House. Other camps were established at the eastern end of Stirling Park on the hills opposite modern Lotus Bay. The first of these was contractor John Howie's settlement (1922–30), consisting of 25 timber cottages for his married men and timber barracks (Hostel Camp) for his single men. Two other single men's tent camps were established nearby—Old Tradesmen's Camp (1923–27) and No 1 Labourers Camp (1924–27). The men from Howie's worked on the Hotel Canberra and the others on the construction of the provisional Parliament House and nearby administrative buildings.|$|E
5|$|It {{is often}} {{reported}} that Eva traveled to Buenos Aires by train with tango singer Agustín Magaldi. However, biographers Marysa Navarro and Nicholas Fraser maintain {{that this is}} unlikely, {{as there is no}} record of <b>the</b> <b>married</b> Magaldi performing in Junín in 1934 (and, even if he had, he usually traveled with his wife). Eva's sisters maintain that Eva traveled to Buenos Aires with their mother. The sisters also claim that Doña Juana accompanied her daughter to an audition at a radio station and arranged for Eva to live with the Bustamante family, who were friends of the Duarte family. While the method of Eva's escape from her bleak provincial surroundings is debated, she did begin a new life in Buenos Aires.|$|E
