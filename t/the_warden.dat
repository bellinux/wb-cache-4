5|$|Sawyer is in prison, {{trying to}} befriend Munson (Ian Gomez), {{a man who}} has hidden ten million dollars. He warns Munson that <b>the</b> <b>warden</b> (Bill Duke) is trying to con him out of his money. Eventually, Munson, worried that his wife will find where he has hidden the money, enlists Sawyer's help in moving the stash. Sawyer then reveals this {{information}} to <b>the</b> <b>warden</b> in exchange for a reduced sentence and a part of the money, which he puts in a bank account for Clementine Phillips, a baby that previous con victim Cassidy Phillips (Kim Dickens) has told him is his daughter. <b>The</b> <b>warden</b> sarcastically congratulates Sawyer on lying and cheating his way out of prison.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the regular cast and Lathan, actor Bob Gunton, voice actor Julius Sharpe, and actress Jennifer Tilly, who portrayed the sheriff, warden, UPS Guy and Bonnie Swanson, respectively, guest starred in the episode. Recurring guest voice actors Danny Smith, writer Alec Sulkin, voice actor Ralph Garman, and writer John Viener made minor appearances throughout the episode. Recurring cast members Adam West, and Patrick Warburton also appeared in the episode, portraying the characters of Adam West and Joe Swanson, respectively. Bob Gunton's voicing of <b>the</b> <b>warden</b> is probably a nod to his most famous role, that of <b>the</b> <b>warden</b> in the film The Shawshank Redemption.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Warden</b> of the Fleet Prison, who {{was also}} keeper of Westminster Hall, was tasked with keeping it clean and letting the shops and booths along the sides. Despite acting as gaoler to the Exchequer of Pleas, Court of Chancery and Star Chamber {{as part of his}} duties <b>the</b> <b>Warden</b> was {{considered}} an officer of the Court of Common Pleas. All court officers were appointed for life, and could only be removed for misbehaviour. Despite this, the sheer number of positions meant that several came up for reappointment in each Chief Justice's tenure, and selling them could be very profitable.|$|E
5|$|Although {{based on}} reality, Chain Gang changes the facts {{slightly}} {{to appeal to}} Depression-era audiences by making Allen's return home one to {{a country that is}} struggling economically, even though Burns returned to the roaring twenties. The film's bleak, anti-establishment ending shocked audiences. Laughter in Hell, a 1933 film directed by Edward L. Cahn and starring Pat O'Brien, was inspired in part by I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang. O'Brien plays a railroad engineer who kills his wife and her lover in a jealous rage, and is sent to prison. The dead man's brother ends up being <b>the</b> <b>warden</b> of the prison and torments O'Brien's character. O'Brien and several others revolt, killing <b>the</b> <b>warden</b> and escaping with his new lover (Gloria Stuart). The film, rediscovered in 2012, drew controversy for its lynching scene in which several black men were hanged. Reports vary if the blacks were hanged alongside other white men, or by themselves. The New Age (an African American weekly newspaper) film critic praised the filmmakers for being courageous enough to depict the atrocities that were occurring in some Southern states.|$|E

In 1956, Bomar was the first Vanderbilt football player elected to the College Football Hall of Fame.|$|E

5|$|The film {{portrays a}} {{struggle}} between inmates and <b>the</b> <b>warden</b> of a military prison, based on the United States Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth.

5|$|A tall tale was recounted by S.E. Schlosser, {{it states}} that hairy trout {{were the result}} of two bottles or four jugs of spilled hair tonic. To catch hairy trout, {{fisherman}} would act as barbers and lure fish from the waters with the offer of a free trim or shave. An intentionally fantastical story in Maine and claimed hairy trout were under catch and release policy that was enforced by wardens' carrying Brannock Devices. If a fish was caught, <b>the</b> <b>warden</b> would measure it against the fisher's foot. If the fish's length matched the fisher's foot size, the fish could be eaten and the outards made into furry slippers.|$|E

5|$|Between 1934 and 1963, {{the four}} wardens of Alcatraz resided here, {{including}} the first warden, James A. Johnston.

5|$|During the Middle Ages {{sheep farming}} for the wool trade came to {{dominate}} the economy of Exmoor. The wool was spun into thread on isolated farms and collected by merchants to be woven, fulled, dyed and finished in thriving towns such as Dunster. The land started to be enclosed and from the 17th century onwards larger estates developed, leading to establishment of areas of large regular shaped fields. During this period a Royal Forest and hunting ground was established, administered by <b>the</b> <b>Warden.</b> The Royal Forest was sold off in 1818.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, Stroud {{advertised in}} a {{publication}} {{that he had}} not received any royalties from the sales of Diseases of Canaries. In retaliation, the publisher complained to <b>the</b> <b>warden,</b> and, as a result, proceedings were initiated to transfer Stroud to Alcatraz, where he would not be permitted to keep his birds. In the end, however, Stroud was able to keep both his birds and canary-selling business at Leavenworth. Stroud avoided trouble for several more years, until it came to light that some of the equipment Stroud had requested for his lab was in fact being used as a home-made still to distill alcohol. Officials finally had the wedge they needed to drive Stroud out.|$|E

After an assault by the Sisters nearly kills Andy, Hadley beats Bogs severely. Bogs is then transferred to another prison. Warden Samuel Norton meets Andy and reassigns him to the prison library to assist elderly inmate Brooks Hatlen. Andy's new job is a pretext for him to begin managing financial matters for the prison employees. As time passes, <b>the</b> <b>warden</b> begins using him to handle matters for himself and variety of people, including guards from other prisons. Andy begins writing weekly letters to the state legislature requesting funds to improve the prison's decaying library.|$|E

5|$|The {{reign of}} Alexios III Angelos (r. 1195–1203) had been troubled from the outset: the {{aristocracy}} conspired against him, his pressing demand for {{new sources of}} revenue was blocked by the refusal of Senate, clergy and merchants to contribute, while the lower and middle classes of the imperial capital frequently displayed their discontent with riots against corrupt officials. The most notable of these was a large-scale uprising in February 1200 against <b>the</b> <b>warden</b> of the praetorium, Constantinople's chief prison, John Lagos, which was bloodily suppressed by imperial troops.|$|E

5|$|Attempts {{were made}} to {{photograph}} the corpse for the naval identity card Martin would have to carry, but the results were unsatisfactory, and {{it was obvious that}} the images were of a cadaver. Montagu and Cholmondeley conducted a search for people who resembled the corpse, finding Captain Ronnie Reed of MI5; Reed agreed to be photographed for the identity card, wearing Royal Marine uniform. As the three cards and passes needed looked too new for a long-serving officer, they were issued as recent replacements for lost originals. Montagu spent the next few weeks rubbing all three cards on his trousers to provide a used sheen to them. To provide a used look to the uniform, it was worn by Cholmondeley, who was about the same build. The only non-issue part to the uniform was the underwear, which was in short supply in war-rationed Britain, so a pair of good-quality woollen underwear, owned by the late Herbert Fisher, <b>the</b> <b>Warden</b> of New College, Oxford, was used.|$|E
