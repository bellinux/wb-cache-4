5|$|After Lieder, {{the first}} person to {{propagate}} her Planet X idea was Mark Hazlewood, {{a former member of the}} ZetaTalk community, who in 2001 published a book titled Blindsided: Planet X Passes in 2003. Lieder would later accuse him of being a confidence trickster. A Japanese cult called the Pana Wave Laboratory, which blocked off roads and rivers with white cloths to protect itself from electromagnetic attacks, also warned <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>would</b> end in May 2003 after the approach of a tenth planet.|$|E
5|$|The President of the United States, Franklin Roosevelt, and the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Winston Churchill, {{discussed}} {{the matter of}} command arrangements in the Pacific in Washington, D.C., on 9 March. Roosevelt proposed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>would</b> be divided into British and American areas of responsibility, with the United States having responsibility for the Pacific, where {{there would be an}} American supreme commander responsible to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Churchill responded favourably to the proposal, and the governments of Australia and New Zealand were then consulted. They endorsed the idea of an American supreme commander, but wanted to have some input into matters of strategy.|$|E
5|$|Higham theorises that Gregory {{believed}} {{that the end of}} the world was imminent, and that he was destined to be a major part of God's plan for the apocalypse. His belief was rooted in the idea <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>would</b> go through six ages, and that he was living at the end of the sixth age, a notion that may have played a part in Gregory's decision to dispatch the mission. Gregory not only targeted the British with his missionary efforts, but he also supported other missionary endeavours, encouraging bishops and kings to work together for the conversion of non-Christians within their territories. He urged the conversion of the heretical Arians in Italy and elsewhere, as well as the conversion of Jews. Also pagans in Sicily, Sardinia and Corsica were the subject of letters to officials, urging their conversion.|$|E

Accordingly, the Temple began moving to Redwood Valley, California, {{near the city of}} Ukiah.|$|E
25|$|In early February 2005, {{during the}} Pope's illness, Ağca {{sent a letter}} to the Pope wishing him well and also warning him <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>would</b> end soon.

25|$|Domitius was Consul in 32 and {{appointed}} by Tiberius as a commissioner in early 37. His son Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, later Emperor Nero, {{was born on}} 15 December 37 in Antium. According to Suetonius, when Domitius was congratulated by his friends {{for the birth of}} his son he replied that any child born to him and Agrippina would have a detestable nature and become a public danger, a fact that became true during the second part of Nero's reign. When Nero castrated a boy named Sporus and married him as a wife, Suetonius quoted one Roman who lived around this time who remarked <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>would</b> have been better off if Nero's father had married someone more like the castrated boy.|$|E

50|$|In November, it was {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> Open <b>would</b> not be held this season after the contract with the promoter was not renewed and a new venue was not found in time. But the intention was to bring the event back for the next season.|$|R
25|$|The {{idea of a}} {{planetary}} collision was inspired by websites with theories about such events. Von Trier decided from the outset {{that it would be}} clear from the beginning <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>would</b> actually end in the film, so audiences would not be distracted by the suspense of not knowing. The concept of the two sisters as main characters developed via an exchange of letters between von Trier and the Spanish actress Penélope Cruz. Cruz wrote that she would like to work with von Trier, and spoke enthusiastically about the play The Maids by Jean Genet. As von Trier subsequently tried to write a role for the actress, the two maids from the play evolved into the sisters Justine and Claire in Melancholia. Much of the personality of the character Justine was based on von Trier himself. The name was inspired by the 1791 novel Justine by Marquis de Sade.|$|E
500|$|Several {{prominent}} individuals representing Maya of Guatemala {{decried the}} suggestion <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>would</b> {{end with the}} 13th b'ak'tun. Ricardo Cajas, president of the Colectivo de Organizaciones Indígenas de Guatemala, said the date did not represent an end of humanity but that the new cycle [...] "supposes changes in human consciousness." [...] Martín Sacalxot, {{of the office of}} the Procurador de los Derechos Humanos (Guatemala's Human Rights Ombudsman, PDH), said {{that the end of the}} calendar has nothing to do with the end of the world or the year 2012.|$|E
500|$|Icke was a BBC {{television}} sports presenter and {{spokesman for}} the Green Party, when a psychic told him, in 1990, {{that he had been}} placed on Earth for a purpose and would begin to receive messages from the spirit world. The following year he announced that he was a [...] "Son of the Godhead", and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>would</b> soon be devastated by tidal waves and earthquakes, a prediction he repeated on the BBC's primetime show Wogan. The show changed his life, turning him from a respected household name into someone who was laughed at whenever he appeared in public.|$|E

500|$|... 2012 was marketed by {{the fictional}} Institute for Human Continuity, {{featuring}} {{a book by}} Jackson Curtis (Farewell Atlantis), streaming media, blog updates and radio broadcasts from zealot Charlie Frost on his website, This Is The End. On November12,2008, the studio released the first trailer for 2012. With a tsunami surging over the Himalayas and a purportedly-scientific message <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>would</b> end in 2012, the trailer's message was that international governments were not preparing their populations for the event. The trailer ended with a suggestion to viewers to [...] "find out the truth" [...] by entering [...] "2012" [...] on a search engine. The Guardian called the film's marketing [...] "deeply flawed", associating it with [...] "websites that make even more spurious claims about 2012".|$|E
500|$|To other reviewers, Captain Scarlet {{remains a}} [...] "camp classic" [...] that, in Bould's opinion, relates well to other Anderson {{productions}} {{due to a}} common depiction of [...] "a utopian future benefiting from world government, high technology, ethnic diversity, and a generally positive sense of Americanisation. They articulate the commonly made connection between technological developments and economic prosperity." [...] He also states that Captain Scarlet espouses [...] "Euro-cool consumerism". The concept of world government is common to Anderson's work and was inspired by his thoughts on the matter at the time: [...] "I had all sorts of fancy ideas about the future... we had the United Nations and I imagined <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>would</b> come together {{and there would be}} a world government." [...] Peter Wright, on the series' depiction of technology, notes the [...] "qualified technophilia" [...] that it shares with Thunderbirds.|$|E
500|$|The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) {{operates}} {{with five}} levels of language endangerment: [...] "safe", [...] "vulnerable" [...] (not spoken by children outside the home), [...] "definitely endangered" [...] (not spoken by children), [...] "severely endangered" [...] (only spoken by the oldest generations), and [...] "critically endangered" [...] (spoken by {{few members of}} the oldest generation, often semi-speakers). Notwithstanding claims <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>would</b> {{be better off if}} most adopted a single common lingua franca, such as English or Esperanto, there is a consensus that the loss of languages harms the cultural diversity of the world. It is a common belief, going back to the biblical narrative of the tower of Babel in the Old Testament, that linguistic diversity causes political conflict, but this is contradicted by {{the fact that many of}} the world's major episodes of violence have taken place in situations with low linguistic diversity, such as the Yugoslav and American Civil War, or the genocide of Rwanda, whereas many of the most stable political units have been highly multilingual.|$|E
50|$|In 1957, Davis {{predicted}} <b>that</b> {{population of}} <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>would</b> reach six {{billion by the}} year 2000. He was remarkably close; that population figure was reached in October 1999.|$|R

500|$|Oscar Ramiro Ortega-Hernandez, an {{unemployed}} 21-year-old man, left {{his home in}} Idaho Falls, Idaho on October 23, three weeks prior to the shooting. He told {{his friends and family}} {{that he was going to}} Utah for a business trip; his family reported him missing on October 31 after he failed to return. According to friends, Ortega-Hernandez had become increasingly paranoid before leaving, saying that the United States government was controlling citizens and that President Barack Obama [...] "had to be stopped". The mother of Ortega-Hernandez's former fiancée stated that he had been well-mannered for the four years she had known him, but had recently started making bizarre statements. On July 8, he had told an acquaintance that Obama was planning to put GPS tracking devices into children and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>would</b> end in 2012. In September, he made a video for Oprah Winfrey, explaining that he was Jesus and asking to appear on her television show. On his 21st birthday in October, he made a 45-minute speech on various topics including a warning of the dangers of secret societies. Ortega-Hernandez had a 2-year-old son with his former fiancée; it is unknown when or why they separated.|$|E
500|$|Those {{who opposed}} this {{resolution}} argued that its presence {{would cause the}} other, more rational resolutions to lose support. Others argued that only the social, civil and religious rights of women should be addressed, not the political rights. James and Lucretia Mott were against the resolution; Lucretia said to Stanton, [...] "Why Lizzie, thee will make us ridiculous." [...] Stanton defended the concept of woman suffrage, saying women would {{then be able to}} affect future legislation and gain further rights. Frederick Douglass, the only African American at the meeting, stood and spoke eloquently in favor; he said that he could not accept the right to vote himself as a black man if woman could not also claim that right. Douglass projected <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>would</b> be a better place if women were involved in the political sphere. [...] "In this denial of the right to participate in government, not merely the degradation of woman and the perpetuation of a great injustice happens, but the maiming and repudiation of one-half of the moral and intellectual power of the government of the world." [...] Douglass's powerful words rang true with many in attendance, and the resolution passed by a large majority. Lucretia Mott spoke to end the session.|$|E
500|$|Skeptics such as James Randi {{suggest that}} his {{reputation}} as a prophet is largely manufactured by modern-day supporters who fit his words to events that have either already occurred or are so imminent as to be inevitable, a process sometimes known as [...] "retroactive clairvoyance" [...] (postdiction). Thus, no Nostradamus quatrain is known to have been interpreted as predicting a specific event before it occurred, other than in vague, general terms that could equally apply to any number of other events. [...] This even applies to quatrains that contain specific dates, such as III.77, which predicts [...] "in 1727, in October, the king of Persia [...] captured by those of Egypt"—a prophecy that has, as ever, been interpreted retrospectively in the light of later events, in this case as though it presaged the known peace treaty between the Ottoman Empire and Persia of that year. Similarly, Nostradamus's notorious '1999' prophecy at X.72 (see Nostradamus in popular culture) describes no event that commentators have succeeded in identifying either before or since, other than by dint of twisting the words to fit whichever of the many contradictory happenings they are keen to claim as 'hits'. Moreover, no quatrain suggests, as is often claimed by books and films on the alleged Mayan Prophecy, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>would</b> end in December 2012. [...] In his preface to the Prophecies, Nostradamus himself stated that his prophecies extend 'from now to the year 3797'—an extraordinary date which, given that the preface was written in 1555, may have more than a {{little to do with the}} fact that 2242 (3797−1555) had recently been proposed by his major astrological source Richard Roussat as a possible date for the end of the world.|$|E

2500|$|Speculation <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>would</b> end in {{the year}} 1000 was {{confined}} to a few uneasy French monks.
