40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we present}} a {{cooperative}} mediationbased protocol that solves a distributed resource allocation problem while conforming to soft real-time constraints in a dynamic environment. Two central principles are used in this protocol that allow it to operate in constantly changing conditions. First, we frame the allocation problem as an optimization problem, similar to a partial constraint satisfaction problem (PCSP), and use relaxation techniques to derive conflict (constraint violation) free solutions. Second, by using overlapping mediation sessions to conduct the search, {{we are able to}} prune large parts of the search space by using a form of arc-consistency. This allows the protocol to both quickly identify situations when the problem is over-constrained, and to determine the appropriate repair. From the global perspective, the protocol has a hill climbing behavior and because it was designed to work in dynamic environments, is approximate. We describe the domain which inspired the creation of this protocol, as well as discuss experimental results. Index Terms—Artifical intelligence, distributed <b>traking,</b> resource management.

To investigate state estimation for target tracking, a typi cal vehicle model moving in 1 -D is used but the proposed method can be expanded for movements in 3 -D. Delay in both process and measurement is considered. The estimation of the states and their performances are analyzed under different scenarios including change in delay, input pattern, noise parameters etc. The results obtained by proposed H∞ optimal filtering are compared with the results obtained by H 2 filter and simulation results are shown. by Ezgi Ateş.

Analiza polazi od Reynoldsove diferencijalne jednadžbe za podmazivanje u koju je ugrađena poprečna hrapavost <b>trake.</b> U proračunu se uzima u obzir i visina maziva na traci te njezin utjecaj na visinu maziva na ulaznom presjeku zone deformacije. Istraživanja su pokazala da poprečna hrapavost ima dvojak utjecaj na visinu maziva na ulaznome presjeku zone deformacije. Za malu hrapavost <b>trake</b> visina mazivoga sloja ima tendenciju laganoga opadanja u odnosu na nominalnu visinu (kada se proces opisuje glatkoćom površina) da bi dalje s porastom hrapavosti debljina mazivoga sloja rasla. Pod nominalnom visinom maziva smatra se slučaj prijelaza konkavne plohe u konveksnu koja djeluje prividno ravnom kao da se proces opisuje glatkoćom površina. Izvršeno je i modeliranje mazivoga sloja za slučaj trenja nedovoljno ovlaženih površina. Okosnicu analize nosila je numerička metoda Monte-Carlo, a izvedeno je i približno analitičko rješenje koje je u usporedbi s numeričkom metodom dalo dobru podudarnost. Ova teorijska istraživanja mogu pojasniti neke pojave podmazivanja u plastičnoj deformaciji metala i činjenicu da oblik hrapavosti <b>trake</b> određuje oblik mazivoga sloja. In {{the paper}} the {{influence}} of transversal roughness of the strip on dressing processes with lubricants is analyzed. The analysis begins with Reynolds differential equation for lubrication, in which transversal roughness of the strip is incorporated. In the estimation, the height of lubricant on the strip is taken into account, {{as well as its}} influence on the height of lubricant at the inlet section of the deformation zone. The research has shown that transversal roughness has a twofold influence on the height of lubricant at the inlet section of the deformation zone. If roughness is small of the strip the height of lubricating layer has a tendency of slight decreasing related to the nominal height (when the process is described by smoothness of surfaces) but with an increase of roughness, the thickness of lubricating layer has a tendency to increase. The nominal height of lubricant is considered to be the case of changing the concave surface into the convex one, which seems to look straight as if the process is described by smoothness of surfaces. Lubricating layer modeling in the friction area on insufficiently lubricated surfaces was also performed. The basis of the analysis was the Monte-Carlo numerical method, and an approximate analytical solution, that gave good match in comparison with the numerical method, was established. The results of this theoretical research can clarify some phenomena of lubrication in plastic deformation of metal {{and the fact that the}} shape of strip roughness determines the form of lubricating layer...|$|E

Continuum images, longitudinal and transverse magnetic field maps and Dopplergrams obtained by IMaX onboard SUNRISE are analyzed by Local Correlation <b>Traking</b> (LCT), divergence calculation and time slices, Stokes inversions and numerical simulations are also employed. We characterize two mesogranular-scale exploding granules where ∼ 10 ^ 18 Mx of magnetic flux emerges. The emergence of weak unipolar longitudinal fields (∼ 100 G) start with a single visible magnetic polarity, occupying their respective granules' top and following the granular splitting. After a while, mixed polarities start appearing, concentrated in downflow lanes. The events last around 20 min. LCT analyses confirm mesogranular scale expansion, displaying a similar pattern for all the physical properties, and divergence centers match between all of them. We found a similar behaviour with the emergence events in a numerical MHD simulation. Granule expansion velocities are around 1 while magnetic patches expand at 0. 65. One of the analyzed events evidences {{the emergence of a}} loop-like structure. Advection of the emerging magnetic flux features is dominated by convective motion resulting from the exploding granule due to the magnetic field frozen in the granular plasma. Intensification of the magnetic field occurs in the intergranular lanes, probably because of being directed by the downflowing plasma. Comment: 7 pages, 6 figure...|$|R

It includes the Micro Vertex Detector (MVD) as innermost detector of the <b>traking</b> system, specially able to detect secondary vertices of short-live particles. Due to the forward boost the MVD layout is asymmetric with four barrels surrounding the interaction point and six disks in the forward direc-tion. The innermost layers are composed of hybrid epitaxial silicon pixels and the outermost ones of double-sided silicon strips, with 10. 3 x 106 pixels and 162 x 103 strip channels. PANDA fea-tures a triggerless architecture, therefore the MVD has to run with a continous data transmission at a high interaction rate (107 interaction/s) where hits have precise timestamps (the experiment clock is 160 MHz). In addition the energy loss of particles in the sensor should be measured. To cope with these requirements custom readout chips are under development for both pixel ans strip devices. The powering and cooling are challenging since the MVD volume is limited by the sur-rounding detectors and the routing is only foreseen in the backward direction.

40|$|Context. Eye {{tracking}} {{technology has}} been applied to video games, mainly, as an offline analysis tool or as an input for game control. Nevertheless, eye tracking systems applied to video games is a topic considered to be on an infant state that requires further development. The following study explore a different approach in how eye tracking systems can be used for video game interaction. Objectives. By implementing a gaze based interaction technique, a gaze aware space shooting game will be developed in order to provide in-game assistance that could improve player's performance. Method. With the help of a Tobii REX eye <b>traking</b> system, a set of 26 volunteers played two video games in a controlled environment. Both of the games had the same mechanics and elements, but only one of them implemented the gaze based interaction technique. The player performance was calculated in terms of the time needed by the players to finish each of the games. A statistic significance analysis was done in order to determine if the testing data provided sufficient evidence to conclude a performance improvement. Results. The results showed a reduction on the time needed to finish the game on the gaze aware prototype, having an average time difference of 74. 03 seconds and overcoming a confidence level of 99. 9 % when submitting the testing data to a paired t-Test. Also, the majority of the players chose the gaze aware game as the most enjoyable, in terms of their personal preferences. Conclusions.

40|$|Recovering the 3 D {{deformations}} of a non-rigid surface from {{a single}} viewpoint has applications in many domains such as sports, entertainment, and medical imaging. Unfortunately, without any knowledge of the possible deformations that the object of interest can undergo, it is severely under-constrained, and extremely different shapes can have very similar appearances when reprojected onto an image plane. In this thesis, we first exhibit the ambiguities of the reconstruction problem when relying on correspondences between a reference image for which we know the shape and an input image. We then propose several approaches to overcoming these ambiguities. The core idea is that some a priori knowledge about how a surface can deform must be introduced to solve them. We therefore present different ways to formulate that knowledge that range from very generic constraints to models specifically designed for a particular object or material. First, we propose generally applicable constraints formulated as motion models. Such models simply link the deformations of the surface from one image to the next in a video sequence. The obvious advantage {{is that they can}} be used independently of the physical properties of the object of interest. However, to be effective, they require the presence of texture over the whole surface, and, additionally, do not prevent error accumulation from frame to frame. To overcome these weaknesses, we propose to introduce statistical learning techniques that let us build a model from a large set of training examples, that is, in our case, known 3 D deformations. The resulting model then essentially performs linear or non-linear interpolation between the training examples. Following this approach, we first propose a linear global representation that models the behavior of the whole surface. As is the case with all statistical learning techniques, the applicability of this representation is limited by the fact that acquiring training data is far from trivial. A large surface can undergo many subtle deformations, and thus a large amount of training data must be available to build an accurate model. We therefore propose an automatic way of generating such training examples in the case of inextensible surfaces. Furthermore, we show that the resulting linear global models can be incorporated into a closed-form solution to the shape recovery problem. This lets us not only track deformations from frame to frame, but also reconstruct surfaces from individual images. The major drawback of global representations is that they can only model the behavior of a specific surface, which forces us to re-train a new model for every new shape, even though it is made of a material observed before. To overcome this issue, and simultaneously reduce the amount of required training data, we propose local deformation models. Such models describe the behavior of small portions of a surface, and can be combined to form arbitrary global shapes. For this purpose, we study both linear and non-linear statistical learning methods, and show that, whereas the latter are better suited for <b>traking</b> deformations from frame to frame, the former can also be used for reconstruction {{from a single}} image...|$|R
