Two issues formed the backdrop of the study: teacher migration and teacher shortages in South Africa. Key findings from the study showed that 27. 4 % of the student teachers were planning <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> abroad in 2005, 63. 3 % were planning <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> in South Africa, and the remainder (7. 2 %) were not planning <b>to</b> <b>teach.</b> However the vast majority of those planning <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> abroad indicated that they would be returning to South Africa within two years.
