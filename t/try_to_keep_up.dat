500|$|In the 1940s, {{radio was}} the {{electronic}} medium for family entertainment and information. In the 1950s, it was television {{that was the}} new medium and it rapidly became global, bringing visual entertainment, first in black and white, then in colour, to the world. By the 1970s, games could be played electronically, then hand-held devices provided mobile entertainment, and by {{the last decade of}} the 20th century, via networked play. In combination with products from the entertainment industry, all the traditional forms of entertainment became available personally. People could not only select an entertainment product such as a piece of music, film or game, they could choose the time and place to use it. The [...] "proliferation of portable media players and the emphasis on the computer as a site for film consumption" [...] together have significantly changed how audiences encounter films. One of the most notable consequences of the rise of electronic entertainment has been the rapid obsolescence of the various recording and storage methods. As an example of speed of change driven by electronic media, over the course of one generation, television as a medium for receiving standardised entertainment products went from unknown, to novel, to ubiquitous and finally to superseded. One estimate was that by 2011 over 30 percent of households in the US would own a Wii console, [...] "about the same percentage that owned a television in 1953". Some expected that halfway through the second decade of the 21st century, online entertainment would have completely replaced television—which didn't happen. The so-called [...] "digital revolution" [...] has produced an increasingly transnational marketplace that has caused difficulties for governments, business, industries, and individuals, as they all <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>up.</b> Even the sports stadium of the future will increasingly compete with television viewing [...] "...in terms of comfort, safety and the constant flow of audio-visual information and entertainment available." [...] Other flow on effects of the shift are likely to include those on public architecture such as hospitals and nursing homes, where television, regarded as an essential entertainment service for patients and residents, will need to be replaced by access to the internet. At the same time, the ongoing need for entertainers as [...] "professional engagers" [...] shows the continuity of traditional entertainment.|$|E

500|$|During 1880, Hiei visited {{ports in}} India, Persia, the Persian Gulf and various ports in Southeast Asia. The ship made annual port visits to Jinsen in Korea in 1881 through 1883. She was {{assigned}} to the Small Standing Fleet in 1886 and became a training ship in 1887 the following year. Together with her sister ship , Hiei sailed from Shinagawa, Tokyo on 13 August 1889 on a training cruise to the Mediterranean with cadets from the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy, returning on 2 February 1890. On 5 October the sisters departed Shinagawa for Kobe to pick up the 69 survivors of the wrecked [...] and continued on to Constantinople, Turkey to return them to their homeland. They arrived on 2 January 1891, and the ships' officers were received by Sultan Abdul Hamid II. The ships also carried a class of naval cadets. On the return voyage, they made a port visit at Piraeus where they were visited by King George I of Greece and his son, Crown Prince Constantine. Making stops at Alexandria, Port Said, Aden, Colombo, Singapore and Hong Kong, the sisters arrived at Shinagawa on 10 May.Hiei began another cadet cruise on 30 September 1891 and visited Australia and Manila before returning to Shinagawa on 10 April 1892. The ship was not in service in 1893, but she was recommissioned before the beginning of the First Sino-Japanese War in 1894. Hiei {{was assigned to}} the Standing Fleet on 2 July. She was the last ship in the Japanese line during the Battle of the Yalu River in September and was heavily damaged when her captain decided to pass through the Chinese fleet rather than <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> with the faster Main Squadron. The ship became the target of most of the Chinese ships and was forced to disengage to prevent further damage. Hiei was transferred to the West-Sea Fleet on 14 October, and the sisters were assigned to the Second Raiding Unit in December for operations against the Chinese port of Weihaiwei. The ships were present during the Battle of Weihaiwei in January–February 1895, although neither saw any significant combat. Hiei took part in the invasion of Formosa in 1895, and participated in the bombardment of the Chinese coastal forts at Takow (Kaohsiung) on 13 October 1895.|$|E
2500|$|In the United States, college-level {{sports is}} big business, valued at $16 billion, {{according}} to two estimates. The UNC basketball program earned a profit of $17 million in 2012. Collegiate sports, as a business, exists within a non-business framework of tax-exempt non-profit universities which are focused on research and education; in a sense, big-money athletics [...] "coexists uneasily" [...] with universities, according to one view. The success of college teams on playfields has a powerful impact on collegiate prestige, such that a college's winning team can stoke alumni donations as well as encourage higher levels of applicants. Further, collegiate sports, particularly at state flagship universities such as UNC, is a deep part {{of the lives of}} millions of alumni, fans, and students, practically [...] "sacrosanct", triggering deep-seated emotions, particularly when their school's teams compete on the national level. Basketball and football competitions between large public universities attract huge audiences and bring millions of dollars in revenue through advertising, ticket sales, brand merchandising, licensing arrangements, and video game contracts. For example, in 2012, UNC sports revenues were $82.4 million, less expenses of $81.9 million, but that the university ranked 25th behind many colleges with more sports revenue. While sports coaches at these colleges can earn million-dollar salaries, players are not paid salaries as such, but rather are given scholarships and tuition breaks and other perks instead. There is an implicit bargain in effect: in exchange for a player's sacrifice on the gridiron or basketball court, a player will receive an academically-competent college education, often subsidized with scholarships, that will help the athlete succeed after college. Yet playing at top levels is demanding physically, leading to questions whether it is sensible to expect hard-working athletes to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> with academics.|$|E
