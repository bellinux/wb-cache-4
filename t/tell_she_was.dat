500|$|James Douglas {{illustrated}} his {{denunciation of}} The Well with {{a photograph of}} Radclyffe Hall in a silk smoking jacket and bow tie, holding a cigarette and monocle. She was also wearing a straight knee-length skirt, but later Sunday Express articles cropped the photo so tightly that it became difficult to <b>tell</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not wearing trousers. Hall's style of dress was not scandalous in the 1920s; short hairstyles were common, and the combination of tailored jackets and short skirts was a recognised fashion, discussed in magazines as the [...] "severely masculine" [...] look. Some lesbians, like Hall, adopted variations of the style {{as a way of}} signalling their sexuality, but it was a code that only a few knew how to read. With the controversy over The Well of Loneliness, Hall became the public face of sexual inversion, and all women who favoured masculine fashions came under new scrutiny. Lesbian journalist Evelyn Irons– who considered Hall's style of dress [...] "rather effeminate" [...] compared to her own– said that after the publication of The Well, truck drivers would call out on the street to any woman who wore a collar and tie: [...] "Oh, you're Miss Radclyffe Hall". Some welcomed their newfound visibility: when Hall spoke at a luncheon in 1932, the audience was full of women who had imitated her look. But in a study of lesbian women in Salt Lake City in the 1920s and '30s, nearly all regretted the publication of The Well because it had drawn unwanted attention to them.|$|E
500|$|Initially, {{the song}} [...] "Everyone's at It" [...] was {{announced}} {{to be released}} as the lead single from the album, but it was ultimately decided on [...] "The Fear". While discussing It's Not Me, It's You, Allen stated that her intention was to make [...] "bigger sounding, more ethereal songs, real songs. [...] I think I've grown up a bit {{as a person and}} I hope it reflects that." [...] She released a demo version of the song, which was then called [...] "I Don't Know", onto her Myspace account, along with another song, [...] "I Could Say", in April 2008. The singer declared about the inspiration for the song, which has to do with materialism and the pressures of being rich and famous: [...] tell you where the inspiration for it came from. I was walking down this street, in this village {{in the middle of the}} countryside in the U.K., and there was this little girl who must have been eight or nine, walking down the street with her mum in, like, high-waisted hot pants and a little crop top. And I just thought, 'That's not really right.' And I could <b>tell</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> the kind of girl that would be trying out for Pop Idol in five years time, and wants to be famous when she grows up. And there's definitely the whole culture of that where I come from, and it's not necessarily a culture that I think is particularly healthy. But at the same time, I'm very aware that I am a part of that culture – but it's not something that I feel particularly comfortable with.|$|E

5000|$|The {{opening line}} lyric [...] "raised on promises" [...] echoes {{a line of}} {{dialogue}} in Francis Ford Coppola's 1963 film, Dementia 13. Referring to another woman, the character Louise says (at minute 22), [...] "Especially an American girl. You can <b>tell</b> <b>she's</b> <b>been</b> raised on promises." ...|$|R
50|$|When Brigitte <b>tells</b> Michel <b>she</b> went to Nice {{with the}} Prince for a swim, having {{just left the}} embassy, {{he does not believe}} her and thinks <b>she</b> <b>is</b> making a fool of him. The promise to always tell each other the truth, but when <b>she</b> again <b>tells</b> him <b>she</b> <b>was</b> with the Prince -- the truth -- he doesn't believe her. Ultimately, <b>she</b> <b>tells</b> him <b>she</b> <b>was</b> at the cinema with a friend and crosses her fingers.|$|R
60|$|Bertrade de Montfort did {{not know}} how to answer so ridiculous a sophistry; and, truth to <b>tell,</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> more than pleased to hear from the lips of Roger de Conde what bored her on the tongues of other men.|$|E
60|$|All {{the time}} Mrs. Bully {{sat in the}} little round doorway, {{encouraging}} him. She knew {{that as long as}} she sat there it would be impossible for either Jenny or Mr. Wren to get in. Truth to <b>tell,</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> enjoying it all, for she is as quarrelsome and as fond of fighting as is Bully himself.|$|E
6000|$|Therefore Dolly {{did not put}} out her candle, and arrayed {{herself for}} bed in the costume with which she was wont to make her nocturnal visits. She had {{perceived}} {{that her father had}} something on his mind which it would be necessary that he should <b>tell.</b> <b>She</b> <b>was</b> soon summoned, and having seated herself on the bed, began the conversation: [...] "I knew you would want me to-night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have just}} been {{thinking}} of Betty's sister, my dear. I should be very glad to get her so good a mistress. But whether she would do for a lady's maid, I am sure I can't <b>tell.</b> <b>She</b> <b>is</b> an excellent housemaid, and works very well at her needle. However, you will think of all that at your leisure." ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Cliff was on {{the point}} of <b>telling</b> Willy <b>she</b> <b>was</b> a fool, but she refrained.|$|R
6000|$|... "So am I, {{but it is}} {{like her}} not to <b>tell.</b> <b>She</b> <b>is</b> a strange, proud creature. Lady Howard's daughter! Upon my word, that is a discovery," [...] and Coventry felt his {{interest}} in his sister's governess much increased by this fact; for, like all wellborn Englishmen, he valued rank and gentle blood even more than he cared to own.|$|R
6000|$|So close no {{man might}} <b>tell</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not dead! [...] And then the Goddess took her zone,--where lies All her enchantment, love and lustihead, [...] And the glad {{converse}} that beguiles the wise, [...] And grace the very Gods may not despise, And sweet Desire that doth {{the whole world}} move,-- [...] And therewith touch'd she Helen's sleeping eyes And made her lovely as the Queen of Love.|$|E
6000|$|How was she to {{tell him}} that the cup of water never could have touched his lips? And yet if this were the only {{falsehood}} of which he had to <b>tell,</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> bound to let him know that it was so. That horrid story of Mrs Hurtle;--she would listen to that if she could hear it. She would be all ears for that. But she could not admit that her lover had sinned in loving her. 'But, Roger,' she said,--'it would have been the same.' ...|$|E
60|$|Her first {{attempts}} at usefulness {{were in an}} endeavour {{to find out who}} were the parents, but Harriet could not <b>tell.</b> <b>She</b> <b>was</b> ready to tell every thing in her power, but on this subject questions were vain. Emma was obliged to fancy what she liked--but she could never believe that in the same situation she should not have discovered the truth. Harriet had no penetration. She had been satisfied to hear and believe just what Mrs. Goddard chose to tell her; and looked no farther.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Nothing less so,' {{said the}} Doctor. 'One {{would think it}} was a naiad that had had an offer from the {{mountains}} next, for <b>she</b> has <b>been</b> shedding a perfect river of tears ever since; and all that the united discernment of the family has yet gathered <b>is,</b> that <b>she</b> cries rather more when we <b>tell</b> her <b>she</b> <b>is</b> right to say No than when we <b>tell</b> her <b>she</b> <b>is</b> right to say Yes.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "What {{is the use}} of it all?" [...] thought Deronda, as {{he threw}} down his grammar, and began to undress. [...] "I can't do {{anything}} to help her--nobody can, if she has found out her mistake already. And {{it seems to me that}} she has a dreary lack of the ideas that might help her. Strange and piteous to human flesh like that might be, wrapped round with fine raiment, her ears pierced for gems, her head held loftily, her mouth all smiling pretence, the poor soul within her sitting in sick distaste of all things! But what do I know of her? There may be a demon in her to match the worst husband, for what I can <b>tell.</b> <b>She</b> <b>was</b> clearly an ill-educated, worldly girl: perhaps she is a coquette." ...|$|E
60|$|There was a {{woman in}} the secret of this conspiracy, though how she {{obtained}} a knowledge of it no one seemed to know. Her name was Epicharis. While the execution of the plans of the confederates was delayed, Epicharis came to the principal conspirators privately, first to one and then to another, and urged them to action. None {{of the members of the}} plot would admit that they had given her any information on the subject, and how she obtained her information no one could <b>tell.</b> <b>She</b> <b>was</b> a woman of bad character, and as such women often are, she was violent and implacable in her hatred. She hated Nero, and was so impatient at the delay of the conspirators that she made repeated and earnest efforts to urge them on.|$|E
6000|$|No {{sentiment}} {{of a religious}} nature ever escaped Old Peg, but {{it was observed that}} she read her Bible regularly, and was occasionally found asleep on her knees--greatly to the amusement of that irritable old rascal, Duncan senior, and to the gratification of Elspie, who {{came to the conclusion that}} the old woman must have learned well off by heart such words as--"Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do; do it with thy might." [...] "Do good to all men as thy hand findeth opportunity." [...] "Be clothed with humility." [...] "Trust in the Lord at all times." [...] Probably Elspie was right, for she judged of people in the old-fashioned way, namely, [...] "by their fruits." [...] Her judgment of the two Duncans on this principle, by the way, could not have been very exalted, but we cannot <b>tell.</b> <b>She</b> <b>was</b> much too loyal and loving a daughter and sister to give any sign or opinion.|$|E
5000|$|Years later, Murray {{receives}} a telegram from Virginia, <b>telling</b> him <b>she</b> <b>is</b> sailing home from Europe {{and has a}} [...] "surprise". He <b>is</b> overjoyed, assuming <b>she</b> <b>is</b> coming back to him. However, <b>she</b> <b>tells</b> him that <b>she</b> <b>is</b> going to marry someone else. She asks him for her jewelry. He promises {{to give it to}} her in a week, though he is down on his luck and has pawned them.|$|R
60|$|ROSE. If {{you did n't}} come, I <b>was</b> to <b>tell</b> you <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{going to}} put you in the blue.|$|R
50|$|Robin {{is doing}} {{research}} in the United States. He goes into a bar where he meets Sylvan, and calls Jane; <b>she</b> <b>tells</b> him <b>she</b> <b>is</b> pregnant with his baby.|$|R
60|$|As for Rosek, {{she treated}} {{him as if}} that little scene had never taken place. The idea of {{appealing}} to her husband in a difficulty was gone for ever since the night he came home drunk. And she did not dare to tell her father. He would--what would he not do? But she was always on her guard, knowing that Rosek would not forgive her for that dart of ridicule. His insinuations about Daphne Wing she put out of mind, as she never could have if she had loved Fiorsen. She set up for herself the idol of pride, and became its faithful worshipper. Only Winton, and perhaps Betty, could <b>tell</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not happy. Fiorsen's debts and irresponsibility about money did not worry her much, for she paid everything in the house--rent, wages, food, and her own dress--and had so far made ends meet; {{and what he did}} outside the house she could not help.|$|E
60|$|Of Grizel's {{journey to}} London {{there are no}} {{particulars}} to <b>tell.</b> <b>She</b> <b>was</b> wearing her brown jacket and fur cap because Tommy had liked them, and she sat straight and stiff all the way. She {{had never been in}} a train since she was a baby, except two or three times to Tilliedrum, and she thought this was the right way to sit. Always, when the train stopped, which was at long intervals, she put her head out at the window and asked if this was the train to London. Every station a train stops at {{in the middle of the}} night is the infernal regions, and she shuddered to hear lost souls clanking their chains, which is what a milk-can becomes on its way to the van; but still she asked if this was the train to London. When fellow-passengers addressed her, she was very modest and cautious in her replies. Sometimes a look of extraordinary happiness, of radiance, passed over her face, and may have puzzled them. It was part of the thought that, however ill he might be, she was to see him now.|$|E
60|$|For {{some days}} after his seizure Lady Harman was glad {{to find in the}} stress of his necessities an excuse for {{disregarding}} altogether the crisis in the hostels and the perplexing problem of her relations to Mr. Brumley. She wrote two brief notes to the latter gentleman breaking appointments and pleading pressure of business. Then, at first during intervals of sleeplessness at night, and presently during the day, the danger and ugliness of her outlook began to trouble her. She was still, she perceived, being watched, but whether that was because her husband had failed to change whatever orders he had given, or because he was still keeping himself minutely informed of her movements, she could not <b>tell.</b> <b>She</b> <b>was</b> now constantly with him, and except for small spiteful outbreaks and occasional intervals of still and silent malignity, he tolerated and utilized her attentions. It was clear his jealousy of her rankled, a jealousy that made him even resentful at her health and ready to complain of any brightness of eye or vigour of movement. They had drifted far apart from the possibility of any real discussion of the hostels since that talk in the twilit study. To re-open that now or to complain of the shadowing pursuer who dogged her steps abroad would have been to precipitate Mr. Brumley's dismissal.|$|E
60|$|She laughed softly. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> looking full {{into his}} eyes and yet he could not <b>tell</b> whether <b>she</b> <b>was</b> angry with him or only amused.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Cartwright looked {{relieved}} and Cartwright resumed: [...] "All the same, I don't see her object for <b>telling</b> you <b>she</b> <b>was</b> a shareholder." ...|$|R
6000|$|Countess. My sister <b>tells</b> me, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> more {{collected}} [...] After {{her conversation}} with the Swede. [...] She has now retired to rest.|$|R
6000|$|Her {{heart sank}} like lead. A vow to keep. There was {{something}} ominous {{in the sound}} of those words. She stole a glance at him as they walked on in silence, and again her judgments seemed put to confusion and her hopes revived. His face, dimly seen {{in the shadows of}} the plantation, was suddenly illuminated by a pale quivering moonbeam, as they passed through a slight opening. Could these be the features of a murderer? Her whole heart rebelled against her understanding, and cried out [...] "No!" [...] For the first time she realized the æsthetic beauty of his face, scarred and wasted though it was by the deep lines of intellectual toil and consuming sorrow. There was not a line out of place, save where his cheek-bones projected slightly, owing to his extreme thinness, and left deep hollows under his eyes. Nor was his expression the expression of a guilty man, for, notwithstanding the intense melancholy which dwelt always in his dark eyes, and seemed written into every feature, there was blended with it a strange pride, the slight yet wholesome contempt of a man conscious of a certain superiority in himself, neither physical nor in any way connected with material circumstances, over the majority of his fellows. And as the realization of this swept in upon her, and her faith in him suddenly leaped up with a new-born strength, there came with it a passionate desire to hear him proclaim his innocence with his own lips, and, having heard it, to banish for ever doubts and suspicions, and give herself up to this new sweetness which was hovering around her life. She caught hold of his hand, but dropped it almost at once, for the fire which flashed into his face at the touch of her fingers half frightened her. He had come to a sudden standstill, and before his eyes she felt hers droop and the hot color burn her cheeks. What had come to her? She could not <b>tell.</b> <b>She</b> <b>was</b> nervous, almost faint, with the dawning promise of a bewildering happiness. Yet her desire still clung to her, and she found words to express it.|$|E
6000|$|But soon I {{found that}} there was good in her too. She used {{sometimes}} to give me pennies, so that once I had four in my pocket all at the same time; but the best part of her was the stories that she could <b>tell.</b> <b>She</b> <b>was</b> sore frightened of frogs, so I would bring one to her, and tell her that I would put it down her neck unless she told a story. That always helped her to begin; but when once she was started it was wonderful how she would carry on. And the things that had happened to her, they were enough to take your breath away. There was a Barbary rover that had been at Eyemouth, and he was coming back in five years in a ship full of gold to make her his wife; {{and then there was a}} wandering knight who had been there also, and he had given her a ring which he said he would redeem when the time came. She showed me the ring, which was very like the ones upon my bed curtain; but she said that this one was virgin gold. I asked her what the knight would do if he met the Barbary rover, and she told me that he would sweep his head from his shoulders. [...] What they could all see in her was more than I could think. And then she told me that she had been followed on her way to West Inch by a disguised prince. I asked her how she knew it was a prince, and she said by his disguise. Another day she said that her father was preparing a riddle, and that when it was ready it would be put in the papers, and anyone who guessed it would have half his fortune and his daughter. I said that I was good at riddles, and that she must send it to me when it was ready. She said it would be in the Berwick Gazette, and wanted to know what I would do with her when I won her. I said I would sell her by public roup for what she would fetch; but she would tell no more stories that evening, for she was very techy about some things.|$|E
5000|$|Tom Tiddler's Ground is {{also used}} in modern English as a {{euphemism}} for having an uncertain status, for example, [...] "I asked her why her performance review was late and I could <b>tell</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> on Tom Tiddler's Ground".|$|E

2500|$|After Rocky {{escapes from}} the spa, Velasco discovers {{there have been}} four recent bank robberies {{involving}} Cyprus Holdings, all carried out by two women. Prints taken at the crime scenes match those of a stripper named Gypsy (Debi Mae West). <b>She</b> <b>tells</b> Kang <b>she</b> <b>is</b> a driver for failed reality TV star Lola Gees (Grey Griffin). Kang goes undercover as Gees' new driver, and <b>she</b> <b>tells</b> him <b>she</b> <b>is</b> working for someone known as [...] "The General," [...] who is taking his money back from the Russian mafia. As Kang arrests her, a sniper kills her to stop her from talking.|$|R
