She became the first director of a new legal aid clinic at the school, where she secured support from the local bar association and gained federal funding. In one of her cases, she was mandated by the court to serve as defense counsel to a man accused of raping a 12-year-old girl. Clinton used an effective defense that led her client to plead guilty to a much lesser charge. Decades later, the victim said that the defense counsel had put her [...] "through hell" [...] during the legal process; Hillary Clinton has called the trial a [...] "terrible case". During her time in Fayetteville, Rodham and several other women founded the city's first rape crisis center. Rodham still harbored doubts about marriage, concerned that her separate identity would be lost and her accomplishments viewed in the light of someone else's.|$|E

500|$|The plot of Freelancers single-player {{campaign}} is illustrated with two hours worth of in-game cutscenes. [...] The story is linear in structurethe player {{is unable to}} effect a different storylineand broken down into stages. [...] Cutscenes inform players of background events and the goals in a stage. [...] Most stages have no time limits for their completion, and players can put the main story on hold while taking on missions (jobs) not crucial to it. [...] However, players can only proceed to {{other regions of the}} Sirius sector, where more advanced ships, weaponry, and equipment are obtained, after completing missions that advance the story. Some stages are not introduced until the character has achieved a certain level (based on total worth accumulated), and {{it is not possible to}} gain sufficient levels just through the story itself, so players must spend at least some time on side missions to gain money to advance to the level required for the next stage of the story. This is also necessary as some stages would be too <b>tough</b> <b>with</b> only the money and items collected in the story.|$|E

The base of the stipe is sparsely covered with sharp, straight, stiff hairs, and is the same color as the cap or paler. The mushroom is inedible.|$|E

2500|$|In late 1998 {{and early}} 1999, {{tensions}} between the Chrétien and Martin camps started {{to come out in}} the open with backbenchers loyal to the two men leaking unflattering stories to the press about their rival patrons. Chrétien rarely changed the composition of the Cabinet, and so as a result, there had emerged by the late 1990s a group of deeply disgruntled Liberal backbenchers, who believed themselves to be Cabinet-worthy MPs, and were extremely frustrated that the Prime Minister would not elevate them to the Cabinet. This group become Martin's strongest supporters as they believed that only by deposing Chrétien could they achieve the promotion to the Cabinet that they so desperately desired. A major advantage enjoyed by the Martin fraction was that in a process starting in 1995 they were able to take control of much of the Liberal Party apparatus reaching a point about 1999 where Martin supporters had an almost undisputed control of the Liberal party as opposed to the government. When asked in an interview about why Chrétien allowed this to happen, Sergio Marchi said: [...] "He just became complacent". Chrétien tended to focus his efforts on controlling the government via the PMO with one of his aides at the PMO Terry Mercer making the revealing remark during a meeting of the Liberal national executive in 1998 that: [...] "I don't work for the party, I work for Jean Chrétien". This tendency had become especially acute by the late 1990s when Chrétien was widely seen to have lost touch with the Liberal Party apparatus and caucus, and was described by Marchi as living in a [...] "bubble" [...] comprising himself and his people at the PMO with relations with those outside of the [...] "bubble" [...] growing more cold and distant as time went by. Chrétien was well aware of the Martin group and its ambitions, but as he believed that Martin had trouble making difficult decisions that the danger was minimal because [...] "Mr. Dithers" [...] Martin would never make up his mind. An additional problem for Martin in challenging Chrétien was that beyond the differences between Chrétien's [...] "hard federalist" [...] approach to Quebec and Martin's [...] "soft federalist" [...] approach, there were no major policy differences between him and the Prime Minister. Since the Clarity Act and Chrétien's entire [...] "Plan B" [...] approach to Quebec were very popular in English Canada, challenging Chrétien on that issue was considered to be unwise, and with no other issue to take a stand on, it was hard for Martin to make a case that Chrétien needed to go. Martin was not very likely to rally much support in English Canada on the thesis that Chrétien needed to be deposed because he was being too <b>tough</b> <b>with</b> the separatist government in Quebec City. Through Martin did not publicly oppose the Clarity Act, he also initially refused to voice support for it in public and several of his aides and Martinista MPs leaked the news to the media that the Finance Minister did not believe that the Clarity Act was a wise piece of legislation.|$|E

40|$|This thesis proposes an {{analysis}} of the tough construction in Japanese. It is proposed that there are actually two tough constructions, each derived by a different kind of movement. Three kinds of data which support the claim made here are presented: <b>tough</b> constructions <b>with</b> scrambling, <b>tough</b> constructions <b>with</b> reflexives, and nominals derived from tough constructions. It is argued that non-movement analysis is not appropriate and that both tough constructions are derived by movement. It is shown that <b>tough</b> constructions <b>with</b> a 'tend to' reading can also be accommodated by this analysis. The analysis accounts {{for a wide range of}} interactions between tough constructions and other phenomena, which have not been previously focused on in the literature...|$|R
