40|$|In severe maneuvers, out of {{necessity}} for a military aircraft or inadvertently for a civil aircraft, a helicopter airfoil will stall in a dynamic manner and provide lift beyond what would be calculated based on static airfoil tests. The augmented lift that occurs in dynamic stall is related to a vortex that is shed near {{the leading edge of}} the airfoil. However, directly related to the augmented lift that results from the dynamic stall vortex are significant penalties in pitching moment and drag.

40|$|In {{recent years}} large span {{suspension}} bridges with very thin and slender profiles {{have been built}} without proportional increasing torsional and bending stiffness. As a consequence large deformations at the mid-span can occur with risk of aeroelastic instability and structural failure. Analysis of aeroelastic stability also named flutter stability is mostly based on semi-empirical engineering models, where model specific parameters, the so-called flutter derivatives, need calibration from <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> tests or numerical methods. Several papers {{have been written about}} calibration of flutter derivatives using CFD models and the aeroelastic stability boundary has been successfully determined when comparing two-dimensional flow situations using <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> test data and CFD methods for the flow solution and two-degrees-of-freedom structural models in translation perpendicular to the flow direction and rotation around the span axis of the bridge section. These models assume that the main contributing modal modes of the bridge are the first bending mode and the first torsional mode. The present work focuses on numerical evaluation of the flutter instability using an arbitrary number of modes describing the structural deformation. Furthermore, flutter derivatives are evaluated by CFD models using forced motion of a bridge section in a <b>two-dimensional</b> virtual <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel.</b> The parameter region of critical values is shown to be outside measured values.

The use of a computer code rather than physical experiment has the advantage that test parameters such as wall characteristics and model chord can be varied widely at low cost. The aim of the investigation was to determine the relative merits of the various walls and to establish the limits of applicability of linear interference theory. The most favourable wall type was found to be an ideal slotted wall with the slot parameter appropriate for zero solid blockage (F = I 11844).

40|$|The wall {{interference}} effects present on three-dimensional models during <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> testing {{are difficult to}} correct using post-test model data correction methods. Further, at transonic speeds, {{with the use of}} ventilated test sections these corrections become complex to apply and inaccurate. The high quality of <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> testing that is required today means that such methods are no longer satisfactory. The flexible walled <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> has in recent years shown its ability to obtain two-dimensional aerofoil data free from the effects of wall boundary restraint. This work at Southampton was aimed at extending the use of the <b>two-dimensional</b> Transonic Self-Streaming <b>Wind</b> <b>Tunnel</b> to the relief of wall {{interference effects}} on three-dimensional models. The compromise of using only two-wall single curvature movement avoids the problems that are inherent with the additional complexity of fully three-dimensional adaptive tunnels. A method of assessing the wall-induced interference velocity components from tunnel boundary pressure data, without reference to the model, has been developed and validated against other wall interference assessment methods. The algorithm, suitable for use in adaptive tunnels, is used with a wall movement influence coefficient method of wall contour prediction resulting in the apparent removal of wall interference effects along a streamlining target line. The residual wall interference velocity components calculated to be present after streamlining on two half-wing models are significantly lower than their straight test section values. Providing the model span is not too large in comparison with the breadth of the test section, the spanwise interference velocity component is negligible. A calibrated force-balance wing-body model has been used to demonstrate the first successful streamlining around a three-dimensional model in the Transonic Self-Streamlining <b>Wind</b> <b>Tunnel.</b> The measured model force data obtained with streamlined walls compares favourably with that derived using a standard post-test model data correction method...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} how wall-induced velocities near {{a model in}} a <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> can be estimated from upwash distributions measured along two contours surrounding a model. The method is applicable to flows that can be represented by linear theory. It was derived by applying the Schwarz Integral Formula separately to the two contours and by exploiting the free-air relationship between upwashes along the contours. Advantages of the method are that only one flow quantity need by measured and no representation of the model is required. A weakness of the method is that it assumes streamwise interference velocity vanishes far upstream of the model. This method was applied to a simple theoretical model of flow in a solid-wall wind tunnel. The theoretical interference velocities and the velocities computed using the method were in excellent agreement. The method was then used to analyze experimental data acquired during adaptive-wall experiments at Ames Research Center. This analysis confirmed that the wall adjustments reduced wall-induced velocities near the model...|$|E

For the CER, predictions were made with a constant-chord/twisted blade and a hypothetical tapered/twisted blade. Results for the constant-chord/twisted blade were compared with CER data. Predicted performance using this empirical stall-delay method provided significant increases in peak power over 2 D post-stall airfoil characteristics. The predicted peak power increase due to stall delay for the CER was found to be quite large (20 % to 30 %) as a result of its high blade solidity. For a more typical, lower-solidity commercial blade the predicted peak power increase was 15 % to 20 %.
