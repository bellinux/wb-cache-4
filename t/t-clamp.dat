30|$|In {{contrast}} to acute correction, hemicallotasis is accomplished with an external fixator. Different types of external fixator {{can be used}} with this technique; a <b>T-clamp</b> fixator from the anterior position, a unilateral fixator from the medial side or a ring fixator can be used. Using the preserved lateral cortex as a hinge, the osteotomy is performed either under the TT. A fibular osteotomy is not necessary. The postoperative distraction starts 7 – 10  days at 1  mm per day until correction is achieved [40].|$|E
40|$|A temperature-jump {{technique}} for single nodes of Ranvier {{has been developed}} using a pulsed laser system. The temperature perturbation was accomplished by firing the laser beam obtained from a neodymium rod through the solution surrounding a single node. The temperature step was achieved within 1 msec using the laser in the normal mode of operation. During the voltage-clamped steady-state current a temperature jump from 4 °C increased the current to a new steady-state value within {{the time course of}} the T-jump. This finding suggests that the maximum potassium permeability PK has a rapid relaxation time and that the steady-state value of n (the value of potassium permeability divided by its maximum value) is relatively independent of temperature. T-jumps applied during the voltage-clamped sodium currents showed that the sodium permeability changed with a relaxation time that was also shorter than the duration of the normal mode laser output. T-jumps observed during a hyperpolarization or at the resting potential showed no detectable conductance change. When a T-jump immediately preceded a voltage clamp pulse the technique was then used to investigate the effect of changes in the steady-state temperature on the ionic conductances. It was found that the magnitude of the change in membrane current due to a <b>T-clamp</b> was directly related to the level of cathodal polarization...|$|E
30|$|Initially, in situ {{neurolysis}} of the {{ulnar nerve}} was performed between the arcade of Struthers and the Osborne fascia, using a curved incision over the cubital tunnel. The wound was left open to allow {{observation of the}} tension in the ulna nerve during distraction and reduction of the elbow. Closed reduction (pat. 1, 2) was carried out by distraction of the elbow and application of the hinged humero-ulnar fixator with motion capacity (Elbow fixator Orthofix Srl, Bussolengo, VR, Italy). Patient 3 required an open reduction due to heterotopic fibrous tissue and ossification, using a limited lateral approach as described previously [9, 10]. The elbow was positioned horizontally with the medial side down and a true lateral view of the elbow was obtained with fluoroscopy, showing the ring structures of the trochlea as a perfect circle. The tip of a 2.0  mm K-wire was placed on the proximal border of the circle and drilled through the lateral epicondyle. The part of the K-wire protruding out of the skin was bent if necessary to be parallel to the axis of rotation, appearing as a dot on the lateral view. The fixator was slid over the K-wire and used as its own template for positioning of the humeral and ulnar screws [11]. It was then removed and two temporary screws inserted into the lateral aspect of the olecranon for mounting the <b>T-clamp</b> of the distraction fixator. Using a standard Orthofix fixator and a standard compression–distraction unit, distraction of the humero-ulnar joint was performed twice over a period of 10  min upto a distraction distance of 15  mm confirmed by fluoroscopy. After the second distraction, the temporary olecranon screws were removed and the hinged elbow fixator mounted using a standard protocol [11]. The fixator was used to reduce the elbow in all cases. The definite and concentric distractions of the joint-space were adjusted using small in-built distractors on the humeral and ulnar links of the fixator. If there was impingement of the coronoid process or persisting subluxation, distraction along the ulnar fixator link was performed for perfect congruency. The fixator was locked in flexion while monitoring the tension of the ulnar nerve by direct vision.|$|E
40|$|The {{finite element}} method was used to study the effect of mount-induced aberrations on the optical surface of a {{lightweight}} double arch mirror subjected to cryogenic temperatures. The mount design was controlled by the requirements imposed on the optical surface quality and stress levels. The finite element {{analysis was used to}} define the feasible range of mount parameters and the selection of a design within the feasible region. The final design consisted of three spring-loaded Invar <b>T-clamps</b> that uniquely define the location of the mirror, three radially compliant parallel spring guides that remove the effect of radial contraction of structure in cryogenic temperatures, and a flexible baseplate that was used to reduce the effect of temperature-induced baseplate tilt errors. The experimental results from the application of this system to an existing 20 -inch fused silica double arch mirror are shown, and possible improvements in system performance are discussed...|$|R
