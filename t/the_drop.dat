40|$|This report {{presents}} {{a study of}} dissipation (irreversible production of entropy) in three-dimensional, temporal mixing layers laden with evaporating liquid <b>drops.</b> <b>The</b> {{purpose of the study}} is {{to examine the effects of}} evaporating <b>drops</b> on <b>the</b> development of turbulent features in flows. Direct numerical simulations were performed to analyze transitional states of three mixing layers: one without drops, and two that included drops at different initial mass loadings. Without <b>drops,</b> <b>the</b> dissipation is essentially due to viscous effects. It was found that in <b>the</b> presence of <b>drops,</b> <b>the</b> largest contribution to dissipation was made by heating and evaporation of <b>the</b> <b>drops,</b> and that at large length scales, this contribution is positive (signifying that <b>the</b> <b>drops</b> reduce turbulence), while at small scales, this contribution is negative (<b>the</b> <b>drops</b> increase turbulence). <b>The</b> second largest contribution to dissipation was found to be associated with the chemical potential, which leads to an increase in turbulence at large scales and a decrease in turbulence at small scales. The next smaller contribution was found to be that of viscosity. The fact that viscosity effects are only third in order of magnitude in the dissipation is in sharp contrast to the situation for the mixing layer without <b>the</b> <b>drops.</b> <b>The</b> next smaller contribution - that of the drag and momentum of the vapor from <b>the</b> <b>drops</b> - was found to be negative at lower mass loading but to become positive at higher mass loading...|$|R

5|$|Here the key {{difference}} to notice {{is that there}} is no surface tension between the solid and the vapor for the second surface tension component. This is because of the assumption that the surface of air that is exposed is under the droplet and is the only other substrate in the system. Subsequently, the equation is then expressed as (1 â€“ f). Therefore, the Cassie equation can be easily derived from the Cassieâ€“Baxter equation. Experimental results regarding the surface properties of Wenzel versus Cassieâ€“Baxter systems showed the effect of pinning for a Young angle of 180 to 90Â°, a region classified under the Cassieâ€“Baxter model. This liquid/air composite system is largely hydrophobic. After that point, a sharp transition to the Wenzel regime was found where <b>the</b> <b>drop</b> wets the surface, but no further than edges of <b>the</b> <b>drop.</b>|$|E
