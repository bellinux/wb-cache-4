[...] I can't tell you how painful the idea of singing 'Like a Virgin' or 'Material Girl' (1984) is <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>now.</b> I didn't write either of those songs, and wasn't digging very deep then. I also feel more connected emotionally to the music I'm writing now, so it's more of a pleasure to do it." ...|$|E

Wynter Gordon, the co-writer of [...] "What Is Love?", expressed her dismay at the [...] "unfinished and unmastered" [...] song's leak in a post on her official MySpace blog. She stated: [...] "I wrote this song from a deep place in my heart. If the world was gonna hear it, I wanted them to hear it right... It's as good as gone <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>now...</b> The story was given a Lifetime TV special instead of a movie... sad."

Atom Heart Mother sounds like we didn't have any idea between us, but we became much more prolific after it." [...] Similarly, in a 1984 interview on BBC Radio 1, Waters said [...] "If somebody said <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>now</b> – right – here's a million pounds, {{go out and play}} Atom Heart Mother, I'd say you must be fucking joking." [...] Alec Dubro of Rolling Stone gave Atom Heart Mother a negative review, ultimately stating [...] "if Pink Floyd is looking for some new dimensions, they haven't found them here." ...|$|E

500|$|James Arnold Taylor was Tidus' English-language voice. Taylor {{was offered}} the role by voice {{director}} Jack Fletcher (who believed that he would fit the character), and translator Alexander O. Smith explained Tidus to him. In contrast to Morita, Taylor made the character friendlier and less serious with the staff's approval. After recording Final Fantasy X, Taylor {{said that he would}} enjoy voicing Tidus again; the character was [...] "like an old friend <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>now.</b> I know so much more about him now than I did when we first started, knowing hardly anything about him. I would really hate it if anybody else voiced him". Recording the game took Taylor three-and-a-half months, and he enjoyed the experience. According to Taylor, it would be unrealistic for Tidus to hide emotion. He said that although there were things he would change about his performance (such as the scene where Tidus and Yuna begin laughing together), he was grateful for the warm fan reception of his work. Smith felt that the forced-laugh scene was adapted well from the original Japanese scene, because of how [...] "stilted and out of place" [...] it was in the original version. Smith was confused by Morita and Mayuko Aoki's performance, but after discussing it with Nojima he found it well done in both languages and called it [...] "awkward" [...] and [...] "funny". When Final Fantasy X was re-released in 2013, Taylor said that he was proud to be Tidus' voice.|$|E

2500|$|AC/DC: Iron Man 2 : Director Jon Favreau {{had used}} songs from hard rock band AC/DC {{in the first}} Iron Man film, and had been {{inspired}} at an AC/DC concert to introduce Iron Man in the sequel during a concert-like event. Favreau said on the band, [...] "What’s fun about them is they were the full-on real deal of heavy metal when I was in high school. They were as real deal as it got. They made some people nervous—people questioned whether they were devil worshipers or not. And now these days they put on the same show...and there’s {{a sense of humor}} about the whole thing....there’s even a strange gentleness to the music <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>now,</b> even though {{at the time it was}} as edgy as you get. It’s celebrating immaturity and youth" [...] in a similar way to the character of Tony Stark. In January 2010, Marvel announced that AC/DC's music would be featured heavily in Iron Man 2 in a collaboration with Columbia Records, who released a soundtrack album for the film featuring 15 classic AC/DC songs.|$|E

2500|$|Love? {{follows the}} {{footsteps}} of her least commercially successful album, Brave (2007), which just missed the top ten of the US Billboard 200, at position 12. Its beginnings date from late 2007 and early 2008, during Lopez's pregnancy with twins Emme and Max. While pregnant, and while at home after pregnancy, Lopez {{had been working on}} new music for future projects. In February 2009, a new song from those recording sessions titled [...] "Hooked on You" [...] leaked online. Lopez would address the leak on her official website in May 2009, where she said [...] "I'm always excited about my music and this [...] is one of a few tracks I'm currently working on. I'm flattered by everyone's interest in the track and really excited for you to hear the real thing..." [...] Songwriter Wynter Gordon also addressed another leak from the album, a song that Gordon wrote called [...] "What Is Love". In a personal blog through her official MySpace page, Gordon expressed her discontent that an unfinished, unmastered version of [...] "What Is Love" [...] had been leaked through the Internet. [...] "I wrote this song from a deep place in my heart. If the world was gonna hear it, I wanted them to hear it right... It's as good as gone <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>now...</b> The story was given a Lifetime TV special instead of a movie... sad." [...] Gordon did note that she was dissatisfied with the circumstances but was in [...] "no way dissing Lopez." [...] The following month Lopez told MTV's Larry Carol that she was keen to finish the album and several singles, with a potential release date for the end of 2009.|$|E
2500|$|Football pundits Johnny Giles, Eamon Dunphy and Graeme Souness, {{analysing}} {{the video}} replays on RTÉ Two, disputed whether Shay Given {{or anybody else}} was obscuring {{the view of the}} assistant referee from seeing the incident, although they were not certain the assistant could have flagged with certainty for handball even if he had a clear line of sight, due to the speed of the incident and flight of the ball. Former Irish international and football pundit Mark Lawrenson said [...] "The man cheated. He controlled the ball with the second handball. It is a Maradona moment". Another former Irish international Tony Cascarino wrote in The Times that Henry [...] "speaks so eloquently, but <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>now</b> he'll always be insincere, a faker, someone who cares only about himself". Former French international David Ginola said [...] "I'm very embarrassed by the situation...I don’t feel very proud to be French this morning. The Irish played very well and they deserved to go through as much as France, maybe more. I'm very surprised FIFA haven't mentioned anything about it – the whole world saw the handball. This is a pure injustice. Everyone in France, the press and everyone, says there should be a replay". Former Ireland captain Roy Keane said the attempt by the FAI to get a replay was [...] "rubbish", telling them to [...] "get over it", that France were there for the taking and Ireland should not have allowed Henry to be in such a good position in the first place. Keane later apologised to any Irish fans offended by his [...] "over the top" [...] comments.|$|E
