5|$|Production of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>version</b> of {{the opening}} episode took place in what {{was to have been}} a three-week break for the cast between {{production}} blocks. Gina McKee was initially very concerned about having her character's early life story changed when she had already based elements of her later performance on the previously-established version. Eccleston was also unhappy about the sudden changes. However, McKee felt that <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>version</b> of episode one eventually made for a much stronger opening to the story.|$|E

5|$|Joseph Cattarinich and Leo Dandurand, {{owners of}} the National Hockey League's Montreal Canadiens in the 1920s, led the {{participating}} ice hockey arena owners to introduce the new sport. In the 1930s, 6 v 6 indoor lacrosse came to be played in the summer in unused hockey rinks. Canadians adopted <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>version</b> of the sport quickly. Eventually it became the more popular version of the sport in Canada, supplanting field lacrosse. This form was also adopted as the primary version of the game played on Native American reservations in the US and Canada by Iroquois and other Native peoples., It is the only sport in which the American indigenous people are sanctioned to compete internationally, participating as the Iroquois Nationals. However, many field lacrosse enthusiasts viewed <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>version</b> of the sport with negativity.|$|E

In an attempt to reduce pad-play <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>version,</b> {{which is used to}} this day, allowed batsmen to be out lbw in some circumstances if they did not attempt to hit the ball with their bat. Since the 1990s, the availability of television replays and, later, ball-tracking technology to assist umpires has increased the percentage of lbws in major matches. However, the accuracy of the technology and the consequences of its use remain controversial.|$|E
5|$|Criticism of the game's {{handling}} of ground combat upon its initial release prompted Paragon {{to issue an}} updated version 3.0 {{of the game in}} late 1990 which featured an enhanced combat system. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>version</b> offered the ability for the player to pause repeatedly the real-time combat to order party members to change their positions or fire their weapons at a selected opponent. This update was made available without charge to everyone who had purchased an earlier version of the game.|$|E

5|$|The system expounded by Medhurst {{influenced}} later dictionary compilers {{with regard}} to tonal notation and initials, but both his complicated vowel system and his emphasis on the literary register of Southern Min were dropped by later writers.

5|$|After Stuart Urban {{left the}} {{production}} and the decision {{had been made to}} re-shoot some of the material that he had completed with Pedr James directing, producer Charles Pattinson suggested to Peter Flannery that the first episode should not simply be remade, but also rewritten. Flannery took the opportunity to completely change the opening storyline, introducing the love story element between Nicky and Mary earlier. This was introduced in later episodes of the television version, but had not been part of the original play. Other storyline and character changes were made with <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>version</b> of the first episode because it was the script that had most closely resembled the original stage play. Michael Wearing felt that the story could be expanded to a greater degree for television.|$|E
5|$|After the Reform Bill was {{rejected}} in the Lords, the House of Commons immediately passed a {{motion of confidence}} affirming their support for Lord Grey's administration. Because parliamentary rules prohibited {{the introduction of the}} same bill twice during the same session, the ministry advised the new king, William IV, to prorogue Parliament. As soon as the new session began in December 1831, the Third Reform Bill was brought forward. The bill was in a few respects different from its predecessors; it no longer proposed a reduction in the total membership of the House of Commons, and it reflected data collected during the census that had just been completed. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>version</b> passed in the House of Commons by even larger majorities in March 1832; it was once again sent up to the House of Lords.|$|E
5|$|After the play's initial run, Kooman {{revised the}} script, making {{prominent}} {{changes in the}} scenes involving Jason and Marta. In the version performed at the premiere, the two characters debate issues of human rights on a solely philosophical level, while in <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>version,</b> Marta makes real demands of Jason, making their interactions more dynamic. Kooman made Jason's wife Ali more patient and understanding in dealing with Jason's lengthy absences from home and removed the intermission. According to reviewer Lana Michelin of the Red Deer Advocate, Kooman's changes strengthened the emotional pull of the play. Because {{of the amount of}} interest in She Has a Name in 2011, not enough tickets were available for the initial run, and a second run was planned for the end of 2011. To finance a tour of the play, Burnt Thicket Theatre raised money through fundraisers, which included the 2011 Calgary Ride for Refuge.|$|E
