By the year 2010 Ethiopian had exceeded all goals set in “Vision 2010”, and the company's net {{profit for the}} fiscal year ended 2010-6-30 was million. <b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>were</b> attributed in part to an aggressive marketing campaign and major cost cutting measures.|$|E
5|$|However, the ABC {{received}} more than 250complaints, outweighing the 177 positive submissions. A spokesperson for the national broadcaster said that <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>were</b> misleading because people who enjoyed the show typically do not make comments. Around the country, around 80% of callers to talkback radio were supportive; and one third of all calls regarding APEC mentioned the stunt.|$|E
5|$|In January, Lee lost in {{the final}} of Korea Open to Chen Long, his fourth {{straight}} defeat by the Chinese. He recorded his tenth Malaysia Open title a week later.

5|$|McCartney had {{originally}} wanted a 90-piece orchestra, but this proved impossible. Instead, the semi-improvised segment was recorded multiple times, filling a separate four-track tape machine, {{and the four}} different recordings were overdubbed into a single massive crescendo. <b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>were</b> successful; in the final edit of the song, the orchestral bridge is reprised after the final verse.|$|E
5|$|On August 21, 1983, Marcos' chief rival, {{opposition}} leader Benigno Aquino, Jr., was assassinated {{on the tarmac}} at Manila International Airport. Marcos eventually called snap presidential elections in 1986. Marcos was proclaimed the winner, but <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>were</b> widely regarded as fraudulent, leading to the People Power Revolution. Marcos and his allies fled to Hawaii and Aquino's widow, Corazon Aquino was recognized as president.|$|E

5|$|After Arias' {{death in}} 1988, Endara became a leading {{opponent}} of the Manuel Noriega military dictatorship, heading the opposition coalition in the 1989 presidential election. Though his coalition was judged by international observers as having defeated pro-Noriega candidate Carlos Duque, <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>were</b> annulled by the government, and Endara and his running mates were attacked in the streets by the paramilitary Dignity Battalions. The assaults received widespread coverage in international media, helping to build support within the U.S. for military action against Noriega. Seven months later, the United States invaded Panama, and swore in Endara as the new president {{on the first night}} of the invasion on a U.S. military base.|$|E
5|$|After the French chemists Louis Nicolas Vauquelin, Louis Jacques Thénard, and Joseph-Louis Gay-Lussac {{approved}} the experiments {{of the young}} pharmacist Balard, <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>were</b> presented at a lecture of the Académie des Sciences and published in Annales de Chimie et Physique. In his publication, Balard states that he changed the name from muride to brôme on the proposal of M. Anglada. Brôme (bromine) derives from the Greek βρωμος (stench). Other sources claim that the French chemist and physicist Joseph-Louis Gay-Lussac suggested the name brôme for the characteristic smell of the vapors. Bromine was not produced in large quantities until 1858, when the discovery of salt deposits in Stassfurt enabled its production as a by-product of potash.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} other insects, P.exclamans use sexual pheromones to attract members of the {{opposite}} sex. Researchers have attempted to determine the exact role that sexual pheromones play in sexual attraction in paper wasps. They set up a wind tunnel where males and females were exposed to a sexual pheromone wick that was isolated from males and females. These pheromones were taken by hexane extracts from wholes bodies and thoraces of unmated females. The male extracts {{were taken from the}} ectal mandibular and seventh sternal glands. It was found that the opposite sex was attracted upwind of the scent and <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>were</b> intensified when a fan was turned on. The range of the scent was found to be around 2 metres.|$|E

5|$|Bigfin reef squids and {{the common}} octopus (Octopus vulgaris) were studied to resolve a century-long debate over whether {{cephalopods}} can hear. Unlike fishes, cephalopods do not possess air-filled swim bladders, which might amplify sound waves travelling in water. <b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>were</b> published in 2009. It showed that bigfin reef squids and octopuses utilise their statocysts for detecting vibrations, an organ primarily used for maintaining spatial orientation. The common octopus can hear sounds between 400Hz and 1000Hz. Bigfin reef squids have a slightly better hearing range of 400Hz to 1500Hz. Both hear best at a frequency of 600Hz. Relatively, their hearing is comparable to prawns and some other invertebrates but is less sensitive than that of most fishes.|$|E
5|$|By this time, Cushing {{was dead}} in the water, {{an easy target for}} {{repeated}} enemy shelling. <b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>were</b> disastrous and the order was given to abandon ship. Six officers and 53 men were lost. Of the survivors rescued, 56 had been wounded and ten of them suffered fatal injuries. The abandoned ship remained afloat until her magazines blew up. Cushing received three battle stars for her World War II service.|$|E
5|$|Chadwick {{was himself}} {{a critic of}} Big Science in general, and Lawrence in particular, whose {{approach}} he considered careless and focused on technology {{at the expense of}} science. When Lawrence postulated the existence of a new and hitherto unknown particle that he claimed was a possible source of limitless energy at the Solvay Conference in 1933, Chadwick responded that <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>were</b> more likely attributable to contamination of the equipment. While Lawrence rechecked his results at Berkeley only to find that Chadwick was correct, Rutherford and Oliphant conducted an investigation at the Cavendish that found that deuterium fuses to form helium-3, thereby causing the effect that the Lawrence had observed. This was another major discovery, but the Oliphant-Rutherford particle accelerator was an expensive state-of-the-art piece of equipment.|$|E

The near unanimous voter turnout and support for Diệm was replicated in highland and Mekong Delta swamp areas, which were not even {{under the control of}} the government and its Vietnamese National Army. In some districts of the Mekong Delta, overwhelming tallies for Diệm in excess of 90% of the registered voters were recorded, even though the Hòa Hảo warlord Ba Cụt and his army had prevented voting.|$|E
5|$|First {{discovered}} in March 1973, the tablets were initially {{thought to be}} wood shavings until one of the excavators found two stuck together and peeled them apart to discover writing on the inside. They {{were taken to the}} epigraphist Richard Wright, but rapid oxygenation of the wood meant that they were black and unreadable {{by the time he was}} able to view them. They were sent to Alison Rutherford at Newcastle University Medical School for multi-spectrum photography, which led to infra-red photographs showing the scripts for researchers for the first time. <b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>were</b> initially disappointing as the scripts were undecipherable.

Hugh also fought a long-running disagreement with his own cathedral chapter over the right to oversee the monks, a conflict that lasted about 40 years. This led to the monks forging many documents purporting to show that earlier bishops had granted the monks rights and privileges exempting them from episcopal oversight. He also fought with Archbishop Roger of York over lands they both held in each other's see.|$|E
