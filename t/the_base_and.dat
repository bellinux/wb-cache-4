5|$|The castle {{was built}} using the trace italienne style popular during the seventeenth century; its floor has a {{geometric}} design, and bastions {{are the main}} defensive elements. However, unlike other permanent bastioned fortifications, its defensive walls were designed as two sections: {{the lower part of}} the wall is vertical (perpendicular to <b>the</b> <b>base)</b> <b>and</b> the upper part, above the string course, is inclined inwards. This design makes the fort unique in Venezuela; in most castles, the lower portion of the walls inclines outwards at <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>and</b> the upper parts are vertical (perpendicular to the base).|$|E
5|$|The north half is an unornamented {{vertical}} mass of purple-brown brick, flaring gently out at <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>and</b> top, with vertically continuous bay windows projecting out. The south half is vertically {{divided by}} brickwork at <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>and</b> rises {{to a large}} copper cornice at the roof. Projecting window bays in both halves allow large exposures of glass, giving the building an open appearance despite its mass. The Monadnock {{is part of the}} Printing House Row District, which also includes the Fisher Building, the Manhattan Building, and the Old Colony Building.|$|E
50|$|A {{baseball}} field can {{be referred to}} as a diamond. The infield is a rigidly structured diamond of dirt containing <b>the</b> three <b>bases,</b> home plate, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> pitchers mound. The space between <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> <b>and</b> home is normally a grass surface, save for the dirt mound in the center. Some ballparks, like Toronto's Rogers Centre, have grass or artificial turf between <b>the</b> <b>bases,</b> <b>and</b> dirt only around <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> <b>and</b> pitcher's mound. Others, such as Koshien Stadium in Hyōgo Prefecture, Japan, have an entirely dirt infield.|$|R

5|$|Amphibians usually swallow food whole but may chew {{it lightly}} first to subdue it. They {{typically}} have small hinged pedicellate teeth, a feature unique to amphibians. <b>The</b> <b>base</b> <b>and</b> crown {{of these are}} composed of dentine separated by an uncalcified layer and they are replaced at intervals. Salamanders, caecilians and some frogs {{have one or two}} rows of teeth in both jaws, but some frogs (Rana spp.) lack teeth in the lower jaw, and toads (Bufo spp.) have no teeth. In many amphibians there are also vomerine teeth attached to a facial bone in the roof of the mouth.|$|E
5|$|An {{earlier version}} of the film that was edited before it was {{publicly}} screened had included a painting class on the lunar base that included Kubrick's daughters, additional scenes of life on <b>the</b> <b>base,</b> <b>and</b> Floyd buying a bush baby from a department store via videophone for his daughter. A ten-minute black-and-white opening sequence featuring interviews with actual scientists, including Freeman Dyson discussing off-Earth life, was removed after an early screening for MGM executives. The text survives in the book The Making of Kubrick's 2001 by Jerome Agel.|$|E
5|$|At {{positions}} west of Hill 881 South {{and north}} of Co Roc Ridge, {{across the border in}} Laos, the North Vietnamese established artillery, rocket, and mortar positions from which to launch attacks by fire on <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>and</b> to support its ground operations. The NVA 130mm and 152mm artillery pieces, and 122mm rockets, had a longer range than the Marine artillery support which consisted of 105mm and 155mm howitzers. This range overmatch was used by the North Vietnamese to avoid counter-battery fire. They were assisted in their emplacement efforts by the continuing bad weather of the winter monsoon.|$|E

At the same time, the 304th Division withdrew to the southwest. That did not mean, however that battle was over.

5|$|Clathrus ruber is {{the type}} species of the genus Clathrus, and {{is part of the}} group of Clathrus species known as the Laternoid series. Common {{features}} uniting this group include the vertical arms of the receptacle (fruit body) that are not joined together at <b>the</b> <b>base,</b> <b>and</b> the spongy structure of the receptacle. According to a molecular analysis published in 2006, out of the about 40 Phallales species used in the study, C.ruber is most closely related to Aseroe rubra, Clathrus archeri, Laternea triscapa, and Clathrus chrysomycelinus.|$|E

50|$|It is {{possible}} to connect a floating source between <b>the</b> two <b>bases,</b> but {{it is necessary to}} ensure paths for <b>the</b> biasing <b>base</b> currents. In <b>the</b> case of galvanic source, only one resistor has to be connected between one of <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ground. The biasing current will enter directly this <b>base</b> <b>and</b> indirectly (through <b>the</b> input source) the other one. If the source is capacitive, two resistors have to be connected between <b>the</b> two <b>bases</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ground to ensure different paths for <b>the</b> <b>base</b> currents.|$|R
5|$|During the 1970s, the {{population}} of the base declined due to the possible closure of <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>and</b> the draw down in personnel from the Vietnam War. In 1972, the base's population was around 12,000, while in 1975 {{the population}} was 10,758. In 1978, 9,233 persons resided on the base, which declined to 8,116 the next year.|$|E
5|$|In deposit, {{the spores}} are pale orange to {{yellowish}} orange. Ascospores are egg-shaped, measuring 20–24 by 14–16µm when mature, but smaller (14.5–19 by 9–10µm) in immature fruit bodies. They are thin-walled, hyaline (translucent), and inamyloid. The cylindrical asci (spore-bearing cells) are 300–360 by 16–20µm with walls up to 1.5µm thick. Paraphyses measure 90–184 by 10–18.5µm (6–9µm thick if immature); they are hyaline, have a septum at <b>the</b> <b>base,</b> <b>and</b> comprise either {{one or two}} cells.
