500|$|The Writers Guild of America went {{on strike}} on November 4, 2007 after the writers had only {{finished}} the first eight episodes of the season. Show runners Lindelof and Cuse wanted to hold the eight episodes until {{they were able to}} produce more of the season, but ABC decided that the eight episodes would be aired from January to March, regardless of whether any more episodes were produced in the 2007–2008 season. After the resolution of the strike, ABC decided to produce five more episodes for the fourth season. This conflicted with ABC's earlier plan to broadcast seasons four, five and six in uninterrupted blocks of sixteen episodes each. Despite <b>this,</b> <b>ABC</b> prioritized scheduling Grey's Anatomy, Ugly Betty and Losts returns all for April 24. The decision left the three unproduced episodes of season four [...] "in the bank" [...] to be used later in seasons five and six.|$|E

2500|$|In 2006, a {{few months}} after the couple's second wedding, the writers {{complicated}} JR and Babe's relationship by having JR try to kill Babe due to a mental breakdown and the belief that he would be saving their son. Not wanting Babe to unjustly die later in life and cause their son the same pain that he went through by losing mother Dixie, or the pain caused by lies, JR reasons that if their son were to lose Babe at an earlier age as opposed to later in life, it will hurt less due to significantly faded memories. In addition, JR was written to fear Babe targeting their son by running away with him and leaving JR without a wife and a child. JR's murder attempt on Babe was a controversial story arc by the writers (see below), further agitated by Babe's willingness to stand by JR even after the murder attempt, later welcome him into her bed, and stand up for him at his attempted murder trial. JR having accidentally harmed best friend Kendall Hart Slater, who subsequently became comatose as a result of the murder attempt, was also ill-received as viewers felt the character should receive jail time. The writers saw the story arc as an opportunity to further the theme of JR and Babe being true loves. To assist <b>this,</b> <b>ABC</b> ran promotional commercials to the original version of the song [...] "Listen to Your Heart" [...] of Babe voicing heartbreak at knowing JR tried to kill her interspersed with the couple enduring it all.|$|E

2500|$|Holman {{began his}} career in 1962 at KTBC-TV, Austin, TX, while {{attending}} the University of Texas, Austin, TX, where he was studying Radio & TV Broadcasting. [...] First as a Floor-crew member at KTBC-TV and {{worked his way up}} to being an award-winning TV director. In 1964 while still at KTBC-TV he produced, directed, choreographed & danced in a [...] "music video" [...] before music videos had even been know or become popular. [...] That short B 16mm film got Holman this first job in New York City that same year as an Associate Producer of national TV & Radio commercials with Norman, Craig & Kummel Advertising, one of the largest advertising agencies in the world. [...] Within 3 months Holman was made a producer and produced over 100 TV & Radio commercials, a few of which became [...] "classic" [...] including Ajax Laundry Detergent's [...] "White Knight" [...] and Hertz Rent-A-Car's [...] "The Flying Man". [...] After 3 years, ABC Sports hired Holman to be a Unit Manager for [...] "Wide World of Sports" [...] covering sporting events in the U.S. and England including NBA basketball, NCAA football, Track & Field, Swimming & Diving, and PGA Golf tournaments, including the British Open in Blackpool, England. [...] After 3 years Holman was promoted by ABC to be the first Production Administrator assigned to a multiple of TV series & specials including [...] "The Dick Cavett Show", [...] "The Tony Awards", [...] "The Grammy Awards" [...] & [...] "The EMMY Awards". [...] While in <b>this</b> <b>ABC</b> position in 1973 Holman met Jim Henson. [...] ABC was producing a Muppet TV Special called [...] "A Muppet Valentine Special" [...] with actress Mia Farrow as the only human guest star. [...] (Miss Piggy had not been [...] "born" [...] yet, nor was Kermit the Frog the host) [...] When ABC ordered a second TV special, [...] "The Muppet Show: Sex and Violence" [...] for a possible Muppet TV series in prime-time, Henson hired Holman away from ABC to be his associate producer for that second pilot. After the two Specials aired it was surprising to Henson and Holman to learn that the network [...] "passed" [...] on hiring the Muppets to be in prime-time. [...] The two other networks at the time – NBC and CBS – also [...] "passed". [...] "The Muppet Show" [...] was picked up as a syndicated TV series by several affiliates instead, and later became a hit in syndication. [...] "By the second season, the series was breaking syndication records and broadcasting in more than 100 countries. And it won several EMMY Awards." [...] Holman [...] worked as the production manager over-seeing Sesame Street, The Muppet Show, the first year of NBC's [...] "Saturday Night Live". [...] During these 6 years (1974-1979) Holman also produced 3 seasons of [...] "Big Bird's (of [...] "Sesame Street") Live Symphony Concerts" [...] all of the U.S. & Canada. [...] Also while at the Muppets Holman conceived the Parker Bros. [...] "The Muppet Show Board Game" [...] for Henson.|$|E
