5|$|Ala can “sneak” into humans, {{gaining a}} human form while {{retaining}} their own properties. A tradition {{has it that}} an ala sneaked into St. Simeon, which made him voracious, but St. Sava <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>out</b> of him. In a tale recorded in eastern Serbia and Bulgaria, a farmer killed an ala who possessed a skinny man living in a distant village, because the ala destroyed his vineyard. In another story, an ala gets into a deceased princess and devours the soldiers on watch.|$|E

25|$|Houghton was {{launched}} in 1782 and made six voyages as an East Indiaman for the British East India Company (EIC). In 1794 {{she was part of}} an EIC squadron that had some success against French privateers and naval vessels in the Sunda Strait, and then in 1796 she participated as a transport in the British capture of St Lucia. She was sold in 1799 and her owner <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>out</b> to India to work in the tea trade between India and China. She foundered in 1803.|$|E
25|$|On 1 January 1979, Vortigern was {{registered}} to Sealink. She {{served on the}} Folkestone - Boulogne route. On 16 January 1983, the ship suffered an engine fire, which <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>out</b> of service for four weeks. At 05:42 on 4 March 1982, Vortigern ran aground on a breakwater at Ostend, Belgium. Her passengers were disembarked by lifeboat. She was later refloated with assistance from five tugs. After repairs in Amsterdam, Netherlands, which cost over £1,000,000, she returned to service on 22 April. In July 1982, she ran aground at Folkestone.|$|E

25|$|Built at Lepe, Greenwich {{was one of}} {{a number}} of 50-gun ships {{designed}} to the dimensions laid down in the 1745 Establishment. She had only three British commanders during her career with the Royal Navy. Her first, John Montagu, commanded her during the end of the War of the Austrian Succession, after which she was surveyed and probably laid up. She was returned to active service under William Holburne with the outbreak of the Seven Years' War, though he was soon succeeded by Robert Roddam. Roddam <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>out</b> to the Caribbean, where in 1757 he fell in with a French squadron under Joseph de Bauffremont. Despite being heavily outnumbered, Roddam fought his ship for 12 hours before surrendering her.|$|E
25|$|Off the Cape Verde Islands they {{encountered}} two frigates and two merchant ships, one a brigantine {{and the other}} a schooner, all at anchor. The French frigates did not respond to the Portuguese and Spanish flags that the British set and instead set sail as the British frigates approached; the British frigates then pursued them. Astraea had problems with her sails so Creole pulled ahead. She exchanged some shots and eventually four broadsides with the rearmost French frigate, which {{would turn out to be}} Sultane. Astraea then sailed between Creole and her opponent, coming alongside the French frigate. Two broadsides from Astraea then temporarily silenced the French frigate as fires aboard Creole <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>out</b> of the action for a while. She re-engaged Sultane, but then disengaged and sailed towards Santiago.|$|E
25|$|At age 14, Coulter {{visited her}} older brother in New York City where he {{attended}} law school. While he was in class, he had his little sister read books by Milton Friedman and William E. Simon. When he got home from class, he quizzed Coulter. As a reward, {{he and his friends}} <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>out</b> to bars on the Upper East Side. Reading Republican books made Coulter dream about working as a writer. She graduated from New Canaan High School in 1980. Coulter's age was disputed in 2002 while she was arguing that she was not yet 40, yet Washington Post columnist Lloyd Grove cited that she provided a birthdate of December 8, 1961, when registering to vote in New Canaan, Connecticut, prior to the 1980 Presidential election. Meanwhile, a driver's license issued several years later allegedly listed her birthdate as December 8, 1963. Coulter will not confirm either date, citing privacy concerns.|$|E

25|$|In 1994, writer Scott Lobdell {{set up a}} {{relationship}} between Braddock and her teammate Archangel. The character is severely injured by a crazed Sabretooth in the Lobdell-written Uncanny X-Men #328. Her life is saved {{by the use of}} a mystic artifact known as the Crimson Dawn, the aftereffects of which granted Psylocke the ability to teleport in and out of shadows. Lobdell also temporarily <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>out</b> of the X-Men roster this issue. Braddock returns to the team in X-Men, vol. 2 #77–78, where she uses her Crimson Dawn-enhanced telepathy to trap the Shadow King in the astral plane. Any use of her telepathy would result in his release, so she forgoes the use of her telepathic ability. Some time later she would develop telekinesis for the first time instead. Psylocke's relationship with Archangel ends in the Claremont written X-Men, vol. 2 #109, where the character embarks upon {{a relationship}} with new Indian X-Men recruit Neal Shaara, also known as Thunderbird.|$|E
25|$|The warship {{remained}} at Leyte until 1 July {{when she and}} TG 38.4 got underway to join {{the rest of the}} fast carriers in the final series of raids on the Japanese home islands. By 10 July, she was off the coast of Japan launching air strikes on the Tokyo area of Honshū. After a fueling rendezvous on 11–12 July, she resumed strikes on Japan, this on the southern portion of the northernmost island Hokkaidō. Those strikes lasted from 13–15 July. A fueling retirement and heavy weather precluded air operations until 18 July, at which time her aviators attacked the Japanese naval base at Yokosuka. From 19–22 July, she made a fueling and underway replenishment retirement and then, on 24 July, resumed air attacks on Japan. For two days, planes of her air group pounded installations around the Kure naval base. Another fueling retirement came on 26 July, and on 27–28 July, her planes were in the air above Kure again. On 29–30 July, she shifted targets back to the Tokyo area before another fueling retirement and another typhoon <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>out</b> of action until the beginning of the first week in August. On 8–9 August, the carrier launched her planes at northern Honshū and southern Hokkaido. On 10 August, she sent them back to Tokyo. On 11 and 12 August, another fueling retirement and a typhoon evasion was scheduled. On 13 August, her aircraft hit Tokyo for the last time. On 14 August, she retired to fuel destroyers again; and on 15 August, Japan agreed to capitulate so that all strikes planned for that day were canceled.|$|E
500|$|Jim Abbott of the Orlando Sentinel {{described}} {{the book as}} [...] "a breathless new biography" [...] by Herbert. In a review in the Herald Sun, Blanche Clark was critical and said, [...] "Herbert's loose timeline is irritating, as is some of her glib commentary, such as: 'When her parents <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>out</b> to restaurants, she would use the breadsticks as drum batons—music was clearly in the blood.'" [...] St. Petersburg Times book critic Colette Bancroft said of the images in the book, [...] "I can tell you lots of the photos are fun, although a few are a little scary, {{like the one in}} which she looks like a space alien awaiting a gynecological exam." ...|$|E

500|$|As her {{popularity}} as {{a singer}} grew, the demands of Selena's performance and travel schedule began to interfere with her education. Her father <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>out</b> of school {{when she was in}} the eighth grade. Her teacher Marilyn Greer disapproved of Selena's musical career. She threatened to report Quintanilla, Jr. to the Texas Board of Education, believing the conditions to which Selena was exposed were inappropriate for a girl her age. Quintanilla, Jr. told Greer to [...] "mind her business". Other teachers expressed their concerns when they noticed how tired Selena appeared when she arrived at school. At seventeen, Selena earned a high school diploma from the American School of Correspondence in Chicago, and was also accepted at Louisiana State University. She enrolled at Pacific Western University, taking up business administration as her major subject.|$|E
500|$|The {{two ships}} formed {{the middle of}} the Chinese line of battle, with orders for them to act in support of each other. A shot from Dingyuan at a {{distance}} of [...] from the Japanese was the first attack of the Chinese fleet, which destroyed its own flying bridge and injured the Admiral and his staff. Her signalling mast was also disabled, causing the Chinese fleet to operate purely in the preassigned pairs throughout the battle. During the course of the battle, {{the main part of the}} Japanese fleet concentrated fire on the two ironclads, but the two vessels remained afloat following the Japanese withdrawal as darkness approached. Each ship had been hit by hundreds of shells, but their main armour belts were unpenetrated. Zhenyuan was damaged on 7 November after hitting an unmarked reef, which <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>out</b> of active service until the following January.|$|E
500|$|MacBride {{passed his}} lieutenant's {{examination}} on 6 October 1758, and received his commission on 27 October. He was {{moved into the}} hired cutter , and in August 1761 came across a French privateer anchored in the Dunkirk roadstead. MacBride made contact with the frigate [...] and asked her captain for four armed and manned boats. Maidstones captain readily agreed, and at 10 o'clock that night the boats left the British ships and approached the privateer with muffled oars. They came within pistol shot and hailed the French vessel, and on receiving no reply, boarded her. The British boarded {{on both sides of}} the vessel, and carried the ship with two men wounded. MacBride himself shot and killed the French lieutenant as he aimed a gun at the British boat. The total French losses were two dead and five wounded. Having secured the vessel, the British <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>out</b> to sea under the guns of a French battery.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} filmed at a former Chili's in the San Fernando Valley, {{in the city}} of Burbank. The episode was filmed [...] "from dawn, until very late at night", {{according}} to Kaling. During filming breaks, Kaling later joked that she took [...] "ladylike" [...] naps, while Paul Lieberstein made notes on the episode and its script. While filming, many parts of the script were changed so the restaurant would allow the shoot to continue. For instance, in the original script, Pam vomits at Chili's and Dwight responds, [...] "A woman has vomited!" [...] Because the completed script was not available for Chili's to review until shooting had already started, when they were finally given a chance to read it, they objected to a customer vomiting in their restaurant. Chili's withdrew its permission to shoot, but, after a few hours, Steve Carell developed a compromise: Pam would fall off her bar stool and Dwight would respond, [...] "A woman has had a seizure!" [...] In the original version, Pam was also to be over-served alcohol by the Chili's staff, but Chili's—feeling that this would reflect poorly on their character as a company—did not want this in the episode either. To solve this issue, the writers had Pam steal drinks off other tables. The writers and producers also agreed to include a scene in which the actual owner of the Chili's restaurant (Jon Bosshart, not an actor) makes it clear that the restaurant does not over-serve alcohol to its customers. [...] Since Jenna Fischer does not drink much in real life, B. J. Novak <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>out</b> so she could get drunk while Novak described to her how she was behaving and how it did not match her own perception. She drew upon this experience for her performance.|$|E

[...] Captain Ainsworth went along on the trip, which encountered rough weather. [...] By the time they reached San Francisco, Lot Whitcomb had three feet of water in her hold. [...] Once in California, Lot Whitcomb was pumped out, renamed Annie Abernathy and ran until 1868 on the Sacramento River.|$|E
