5|$|Within a {{month of}} the cabal's formation, the other team members started {{detailed}} game development, and within another month, began playtesting through Sierra. The cabal were intimately involved with playtesting, monitoring the player but otherwise not interacting, as to take the player's feedback, including any confusion or inability to solve a game's puzzle, into action items to be fixed on the next iteration of a game. Later, {{with most of the}} main adjustments made, the team included means <b>to</b> <b>benchmark</b> players' actions which they then collected and interpreted statistically to further fine-tune levels. Between the cabal and playtesting, Valve identified and removed parts that proved unenjoyable. Birdwell said that while there were struggles at first, the cabal approach was critical for Half-Lifes success, and was reused for Team Fortress 2 from the start.|$|E
25|$|Fortran is a general-purpose, procedural, and {{imperative}} {{programming language}} that is especially suited to numeric computation and scientific computing. Fortran came to dominate this area of programming early on {{and has been in}} continual use for over half a century in computationally intensive areas such as numerical weather prediction, finite element analysis, computational fluid dynamics (CFD), computational physics, and computational chemistry. It {{is one of the most}} popular languages in the area of High-performance computing and programs <b>to</b> <b>benchmark</b> and rank the world's fastest supercomputers are written in Fortran.

25|$|The {{coefficients}} ci {{were determined}} empirically for a 1 M KCl solution, using MD simulations <b>to</b> <b>benchmark</b> the ion radial distribution functions against Equilibrium Monte Carlo simulations. The effect of hydration shells {{was found to}} be important in simulations at higher salt concentrations where the conductance of many ion channels, porin among them, is observed to saturate as the salt concentration in the electrolyte baths is further increased. Earlier simulations that did not include a model of hydration shells did not reproduce the conductance saturation behavior. This suggests an additional repulsive potential acting to prevent ion crowding, and hence limiting the concentration of ions and current density in the confined space of the pore even at high bath salt concentration. When the repulsive potential was included moderate channel conductance was observed.|$|E
25|$|This Benchmark was post-peer {{reviewed}} and significantly expanded. The new set is diverse {{in terms of}} the biological functions it represents, with complexes that involve G-proteins and receptor extracellular domains, as well as antigen/antibody, enzyme/inhibitor, and enzyme/substrate complexes. It is also diverse {{in terms of the}} partners' affinity for each other, with Kd ranging between 10−5 and 10−14 M. Nine pairs of entries represent closely related complexes that have a similar structure, but a very different affinity, each pair comprising a cognate and a noncognate assembly. The unbound structures of the component proteins being available, conformation changes can be assessed. They are significant in most of the complexes, and large movements or disorder-to-order transitions are frequently observed. The set may be used <b>to</b> <b>benchmark</b> biophysical models aiming to relate affinity to structure in protein–protein interactions, taking into account the reactants and the conformation changes that accompany the association reaction, instead of just the final product.|$|E

Taking {{the example of the}} Sunday Times University League Table, the author re-analyses the descriptive data on UK universities. Using a linear programming technique, data envelope analysis (DEA) the author uses the re-analysis to demonstrate the major shortcomings of current league tables. Those shortcomings include the arbitrary allocation of weightings to performance indicators, the failure to differentiate between inputs and outputs, and the comparison of institutions with dissimilar comparators. DEA is used to exemplify how these three shortcomings could be overcome, and how a better approach <b>to</b> <b>benchmarking</b> could be developed. In particular, it is argued that a DEA approach <b>to</b> <b>benchmarking</b> allows for the recognition of diverse missions, which is more appropriate to universities...|$|R
