25|$|The First Rule of Logic {{pertains}} to the mind's presuppositions in undertaking reason and logic, presuppositions, for instance, that <b>truth</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> real do not depend on yours or my opinion of them but do depend on representational relation and consist in the destined end in investigation taken far enough (see below).

25|$|Like the Cambridge Apostles and the Metaphysical Society of {{the last}} century, the History of Ideas Club has set itself the {{threefold}} aim of intellectual stock-taking, the pursuit of new <b>truth,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ‘cross-fertilization’ of the various academic departments and disciplines.

25|$|Nothing about a {{personal}} connection between Gertrude Lawrence and Daphne du Maurier was published during Lawrence's lifetime.

25|$|Also {{strongly}} {{critical of}} reductionist accounts of mind (e.g., behaviorism), he maintained {{to the contrary}} that mind {{is the reality of}} which we are in fact most certain.

Such understanding comes about, in his view, through a grasp of necessity: to understand (or explain) something is to see it as necessitated within a system of which it is a part.|$|E
