2500|$|In August 2013, Schoolboy Q {{called the}} album his [...] "best work yet." [...] He also {{called it a}} classic, but hoped his fans will have the final say: [...] "It's a classic album I would like to say, but I would like the people to say it's a classic. But in my eyes it's a crazy album…I'm really proud of myself for this record." [...] Schoolboy Q further commented on the album as he {{compared}} it to past releases including 2012's Habits & Contradictions and his independent debut, Setbacks. The rapper stated that the major difference between the three projects is that he wasn't forced to compromise on Oxymoron: [...] "It's me. This album is really me. It's my life. Habits & Contradictions and Setbacks was more like—I compromised a little bit also with them projects. 'Hands on the Wheel' was like I really was like 'I'mma go to radio with this'…I made this project the way I wanted it to make. I wanted it to sound [...] So, this album is crazy. It's my best work. I {{know a lot of}} rappers say that when they dropping they albums, but I'm one of those dudes it ain't like I drop mixtapes. It ain't like I do that type of stuff. Drop songs every month to let you know I'm really in the studio perfecting things." [...] In addition to losing the need to compromise, Schoolboy Q hinted Oxymoron may boast a [...] "more comfortable Q." [...] While speaking exclusively with HipHopDX earlier in the year, the rapper shared a few words of advice for his fellow emcees as he touched on his increased comparability with music: [...] "I feel like all rappers, the more comfortable you are, the better your raps are gon' be. When I was in the studios , I wrote the verse, and I wasn't comfortable, but I just did it anyway. The more comfortable you are with your music, the iller you gon' get. You feel confident and comfortable in your voice and find yourself." [...] In September 2013, Schoolboy Q discussed how gang history would be included in his album: [...] "I've never said this in an interview," [...] Schoolboy Q {{said in an interview with}} Life+Times: [...] "This album is about me <b>taking</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> daughter and Crip history from 1969 to present." ...|$|E

60|$|My {{steadiness}} was owing, {{in a great}} measure, to {{the following}} circumstances. I fell in with two old acquaintances, {{who had been in}} prison with me, of the names of Tibbets and Wilson. This Tibbets was not the man who had been sent to Bermuda with me, but another of the same name. These men had belonged to the Gov. Tompkins privateer, and had received a considerable sum in prize-money, on returning home. They had used their money discreetly, having purchased an English prize-brig, at a low price, and fitted her out. On board the Tompkins, both had been foremost hands, and in prison they had messed in our bay, so that we had been hail-fellows-well-met; on Melville Island. After getting this brig ready, they had been to the West Indies in her, and were now about to sail for Ireland. They wished me to go with them, and gave me so much good advice, on the subject of <b>taking</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> money, that it produced the effect I have just mentioned.|$|E

6000|$|I {{liked the}} children. They were timid, {{but on the}} whole {{disposed}} to attach themselves to me. There was a nurse, however, in the house, a rosy-faced woman always making an obtrusive pretence of being gay and good-humoured, who had nursed them both, and who had secured their affections before I saw them. I could almost have settled down to my fate but for this woman. Her artful devices for keeping herself before the children in constant competition with me, might have blinded many in my place; but I saw through them from the first. On the pretext of arranging my rooms and waiting on me and <b>taking</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> wardrobe (all of which she did busily), she was never absent. The most crafty of her many subtleties was her feint of seeking to make the children fonder of me. She would lead them to me and coax them to me. 'Come to good Miss Wade, come to dear Miss Wade, come to pretty Miss Wade. She loves you very much. Miss Wade is a clever lady, who has read heaps of books, and can tell you far better and more interesting stories than I know. Come and hear Miss Wade!' How could I engage their attentions, when my heart was burning against these ignorant designs? How could I wonder, when I saw their innocent faces shrinking away, and their arms twining round her neck, instead of mine? Then she would look up at me, shaking their curls from her face, and say, 'They'll come round soon, Miss Wade; they're very simple and loving, ma'am; don't be at all cast down about it, ma'am'--exulting over me! ...|$|E

40|$|LTE-Advanced {{networks}} employ {{random access}} based on preambles transmitted ac-cording to multi-channel slotted Aloha principles. The random access is controlled through a limit W {{on the number}} of transmission attempts and a timeout period for uniform backoff after a collision. The LTE-Advanced random access system is mod-eled by formulating the equilibrium condition for the ratio of the number of requests successful within the permitted number of transmission attempts to those successful in one attempt. It is analytically proved that for W ≤ 8 there is only one equilib-rium operating point, and for W ≥ 9 there are three operating points if the request load ρ is between load boundaries ρ 1 and ρ 2. These load boundaries as well as the corresponding system operating points are analytically identified. Analytical expres-sions for the throughput and delay of successful requests at the operating points are found and validated through simulations. Further, the results are generalized using a steady-state equilibrium based approach and models for single-channel and multi-channel systems are developed, incorporating the barring probability PB. Ultimately, the de-correlating effect of parameters O, PB, and Tmaxo is identified and the Pois-sonization effect due to the backlogged requests in a slot is introduced. The impact of Poissonization on different traffic is studied. Further research directions are discussed at the conclusion. i DEDICATION I dedicate this thesis, To my grandparents, who are not alive to see this thesis come to completion, for their love and stories that are integral to myself.
