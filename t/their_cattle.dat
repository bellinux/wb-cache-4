5|$|Prior {{to modern}} {{settlement}} in villages, the nomadic indigenous peoples of Ethiopia provided easy hunting {{grounds for the}} bushcrow as they left loose, dung-covered soil behind as they moved <b>their</b> <b>cattle.</b> This provided a rich abundance of beetle larvae for the bushcrow to feed upon.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{prior to}} the {{restructuring}} of the French Limousin Herd Book in 2008, French breeders had two months to nominate the class (Pureblood or Purebred) in which they wanted <b>their</b> <b>cattle</b> to be registered. Pureblood cattle have higher business value than Purebreds because they are preferred by French breeders. Also, Full French cattle benefit under a branded meat marketing label known as Blason Prestige Label Rouge, which has around 800 outlets in France.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to this, cattle ranchers who observed condors feeding {{on the dead}} young of <b>their</b> <b>cattle</b> assumed that the birds killed the cattle. This fallacy led to the condor's extirpation {{in some parts of}} the western United States. This belief was so deeply ingrained that the reintroduction of condors to the Grand Canyon was challenged by some cattle ranchers, who mistakenly believed that the bird hunted calves and lambs.|$|E

5|$|The Welsh {{were also}} early adopters of {{roasting}} cheese. An early incarnation of Welsh rarebit {{was being made}} in medieval times, and {{by the middle of}} the 15th century Rarebit was considered a national dish. The acid soil of Wales meant that the milk produced by <b>their</b> <b>cattle</b> created a soft cheese, which was not as good for roasting, so Welsh people would trade for harder cheeses such as Cheddar.|$|E
5|$|After Kiev, the Red Army {{no longer}} outnumbered the Germans {{and there were}} no more trained {{reserves}} directly available. To defend Moscow, Stalin could field 800,000 men in 83 divisions, but no more than 25 divisions were fully effective. Operation Typhoon, the drive to Moscow, began on 30 September 1941. In front of Army Group Center was a series of elaborate defense lines, the first centered on Vyazma and the second on Mozhaysk. Russian peasants began fleeing ahead of the advancing German units, burning their harvested crops, driving <b>their</b> <b>cattle</b> away, and destroying buildings in their villages as part of a scorched-earth policy designed to deny the Nazi war machine of needed supplies and foodstuffs.|$|E

5|$|As {{the colonists}} fenced off more land, the Noongar were {{increasingly}} {{denied access to}} their traditional hunting grounds and sacred sites. In search of food, the Noongar raided the settlers' crops and killed <b>their</b> <b>cattle.</b> They also developed a taste for the settlers' supplies, and began to take flour and other food, which became a serious problem for the colony. In addition, the Noongar practice of firestick farming: firing the bush to flush out game and encourage germination of undergrowth for sustainability, threatened the settlers' crops and houses.|$|E
5|$|The Southeast Asian {{cultural}} {{influence is}} also evident in Malagasy cuisine, in which rice is consumed at every meal, typically accompanied by one {{of a variety of}} flavorful vegetable or meat dishes. African influence is reflected in the sacred importance of zebu cattle and their embodiment of their owner's wealth, traditions originating on the African mainland. Cattle rustling, originally a rite of passage for young men in the plains areas of Madagascar where the largest herds of cattle are kept, has become a dangerous and sometimes deadly criminal enterprise as herdsmen in the southwest attempt to defend <b>their</b> <b>cattle</b> with traditional spears against increasingly armed professional rustlers.|$|E

On September 26, two months after embarking on the cutoff, the Donner Party rejoined the traditional trail along a stream that became known as the Humboldt River. The shortcut had probably delayed them by a month.|$|E

5|$|While some culinary {{practices}} and dishes have been imported from its British neighbors, uniquely Welsh cuisine grew principally from {{the lives of}} Welsh working people, {{largely as a result}} of their isolation from outside culinary influences and the need to produce food based on the limited ingredients they could produce or afford. Welsh Celts and their more recent Welsh descendants originally practiced transhumance, moving <b>their</b> <b>cattle</b> to higher elevations in the summer and back to their home base in the winter. Once they settled to homesteads, a family would have generally eaten meat from a pig primarily, keeping a cow for dairy products.|$|E
5|$|Colonists {{arrived in}} the area where the park is located in the late 19th century. At this time, the Athi plains east and south of what is today Nairobi had {{plentiful}} wildlife. Nomadic Maasai lived and herded <b>their</b> <b>cattle</b> among the wildlife. Kikuyu people farmed the forested highlands above Nairobi. As Nairobi grew—it had 14,000 residents by 1910—conflicts between humans and animals increased. Residents of the city carried guns at night to protect against lions. People complained that giraffes and zebras walked on and ruined their flower beds. Animals were gradually confined to the expansive plains to the west and south of Nairobi, and the colonial government set this area aside as a game reserve. Settlers from Nairobi including Isak Dinesen, author of Out of Africa, rode horses among gazelles, impala, and zebras in this reserve.|$|E
5|$|Faced {{with one}} last push over {{mountains}} that {{were described as}} much worse than the Wasatch, the ragtag company had {{to decide whether to}} forge ahead or rest <b>their</b> <b>cattle.</b> It was October 20 and they had been told that the pass would not be snowed in until the middle of November. William Pike was killed when a gun being loaded by William Foster was discharged negligently, an event that seemed to make the decision for them; family by family, they resumed their journey, first the Breens, then Kesebergs, Stanton with the Reeds, Graveses, and Murphys. The Donners waited and traveled last. After a few miles of rough terrain, an axle broke on one of the Donners' wagons. Jacob and George went into the woods to fashion a replacement. George Donner sliced his hand open while chiseling the wood, but it seemed a superficial wound.|$|E

5|$|In East Africa, {{the blue}} {{wildebeest}} {{is the most}} abundant big game species; some populations perform an annual migration to new grazing grounds, but the black wildebeest is merely nomadic. Breeding in both takes place over {{a short period of}} time at the end of the rainy season and the calves are soon active and are able to move with the herd, a fact necessary for their survival. Nevertheless, some fall prey to large carnivores, especially the spotted hyena. Wildebeest often graze in mixed herds with zebra which gives heightened awareness of potential predators. They are also alert to the warning signals emitted by other animals such as baboons. Wildebeest are a tourist attraction but compete with domesticated livestock for pasture and are sometimes blamed by farmers for transferring diseases and parasites to <b>their</b> <b>cattle.</b> Some illegal hunting goes on but the population trend is fairly stable and some populations are in national parks or on private land. The International Union for Conservation of Nature lists both as least-concern species.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} home of Clan MacIntyre is likewise {{the subject of}} conjecture. There is general agreement that the clan arose in the Hebrides, the islands west of the Scottish mainland. Some accounts, however, identify Skye as the ancestral home, while another tradition holds Islay {{to have been the}} locale. The story of how the clan made its way to the mainland and settled along the shore of Loch Etive in the vicinity of Ben Cruachan is again shrouded in myth and magic. It is said that seeking fresh pastures for <b>their</b> <b>cattle</b> they were initially obstructed by a mountain spirit. After testing their perseverance and courage the spirit instructed them to make their new home where the white cow in their herd should first lie down to rest. This site became known as Glen Noe.|$|E
5|$|The {{religious}} historian R.C. Dhere, {{winner of}} the Sahitya Akademi Award for his book Sri Vitthal: Ek Mahasamanvaya, opines that Vithoba worship may be even older—"Vedic or pre-Vedic", hence pre-dating the worship of Krishna. According to this theory, Vithoba is an amalgam of various local heroes, who gave their lives to save <b>their</b> <b>cattle.</b> He was first worshipped by the Dhangar, the cattle-owning caste of Maharashtra. The rise of the Yadava dynasty, which had cowherd ancestry, could {{have led to the}} glorification of Vithoba as Krishna, who is often depicted as a cowherd. This Vaishnavization of Vithoba also led to conversion of the Shaiva Pundarika shrine to the Vaishnava shrine of the devotee Pundalik, who—according to legend—brought Vithoba to Pandharpur. There may have been an attempt to assimilate Vithoba into Buddhism; today, both are viewed as a form of Vishnu in Hinduism.|$|E
