40|$|We {{study the}} impact of gender quotas on the {{acquisition}} of human capital. We assume that individuals' formation of human capital {{is influenced by the}} prospect of landing high-pay <b>top</b> <b>positions,</b> and that these positions are regulated by gender-specific quotas. In the absence of quotas, women consider their chances of getting <b>top</b> <b>positions</b> to be lower than men 4 s. The lure of <b>top</b> <b>positions</b> induces even men of relatively low ability to engage in human capital formation, whereas women of relatively high ability do not expect to get <b>top</b> <b>positions</b> and do not therefore engage in human capital formation. Gender quotas discourage men who are less efficient in forming human capital, and encourage women who are more efficient in forming human capital. We provide a condition under which the net result of the institution of gender quotas is an increase in human capital in the economy as a whole...|$|R
