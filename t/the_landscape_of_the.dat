5|$|The Rhondda Valley {{is located}} in the upland, or Blaenau, area of Glamorgan. <b>The</b> <b>landscape</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rhondda was formed by glacial action during the last ice age, as slow moving glaciers gouged out the deep valleys that exist today. With the retreat of the ice sheet, around 8000BC, the valleys were further {{modified}} by stream and river action. This left the two river valleys of the Rhondda with narrow, steep sided slopes which would dictate the layout of settlements from early to modern times.|$|E

His family plan to establish a writers' retreat at his crib there. The film Two Little Boys, starring comedians Bret McKenzie and Hamish Blake, was filmed in the Catlins early in 2011.|$|E

5|$|In {{modern times}} the witches {{have become the}} {{inspiration}} for Pendle's tourism and heritage industries, with local shops selling a variety of witch-motif gifts. Burnley's Moorhouse's produces a beer called Pendle Witches Brew, {{and there is a}} Pendle Witch Trail running from Pendle Heritage Centre to Lancaster Castle, where the accused witches were held before their trial. The X43 bus route run by Burnley Bus Company has been branded The Witch Way, with some of the vehicles operating on it named after the witches in the trial. Pendle Hill, which dominates <b>the</b> <b>landscape</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> area, continues to be associated with witchcraft, and hosts a hilltop gathering every Halloween.|$|E
5|$|In {{more recent}} times, massive ice sheets {{at least one}} {{kilometer}} thick ravaged <b>the</b> <b>landscape</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state and sculpted its terrain. The Wisconsin glaciation left 12,000 years ago. These glaciers covered all of Minnesota except the far southeast, an area characterized by steep hills and streams that cut into the bedrock. This area {{is known as the}} Driftless Zone for its absence of glacial drift. Much of the remainder of the state outside the northeast has 50feet (15m) or more of glacial till left behind as the last glaciers retreated. Gigantic Lake Agassiz formed in the northwest 13,000 years ago. Its bed created the fertile Red River valley, and its outflow, glacial River Warren, carved the valley of the Minnesota River and the Upper Mississippi downstream from Fort Snelling. Minnesota is geologically quiet today; it experiences earthquakes infrequently, {{and most of them are}} minor.|$|E

5|$|Most of her {{commissions}} {{were carried}} out during the 12 years or so {{between the end of}} the First World War and the start of the Great Depression. She took on several major projects, including designing <b>the</b> <b>landscape</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> University of Delaware campus in 1919 at the recommendation of Sharp, who chaired the college's Buildings and Grounds Committee. From 1918 to 1952, Coffin was appointed the University of Delaware’s landscape architect, a position which required Coffin to unite the university’s two separate campuses (the former Delaware College to the north and the Delaware Women’s College to the south) into one cohesive design. This was a challenge since the linear mall design of each was out of alignment with the other. Coffin solved this problem by linking them via a circle instead of curving the straight paths (the university’s library faces this circle today) which rendered the misalignment unnoticeable to the pedestrian.|$|E
5|$|Of the Cadwgan Circle, {{the most}} notable of their number is Rhydwen Williams, {{the winner of the}} Eisteddfod Crown on two {{occasions}} who used <b>the</b> <b>landscape</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> industrial valleys as a basis for much of his work. Writing in the English language Peter George was born in Treorchy and is best known as the Oscar nominated screenwriter of Dr. Strangelove, based on his book Red Alert. Reflecting the lives of the residents of the Rhondda, both Gwyn Thomas and Ron Berry brought a realism to the industrial valleys which was missing in the more rose-tinted writings of Richard Llewellyn.|$|E
5|$|On 26 July, {{the day of}} the ceremony, pilgrims {{spent the}} morning and early {{afternoon}} exploring <b>the</b> <b>landscape</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> memorial park before congregating at the monument. For the ceremony, sailors from HMCS Saguenay provided the guard of honour. Also present were The Royal Canadian Horse Artillery Band, French army engineers, and French-Moroccan cavalry who had fought on the site during the Second Battle of Artois. The ceremony itself was broadcast live by the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission over shortwave radio, with facilities of the British Broadcasting Corporation transmitting the ceremony to Canada. Senior Canadian, British, and European officials, including French President Albert Lebrun, and a crowd of over 50,000 attended the event. Absent, though, was Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, it being well understood that he was generally not comfortable around veterans and felt it more appropriate for a war veteran in Cabinet to act as minister in attendance.|$|E

5|$|Red Dead Redemption spans two fictitious United States {{counties}} and a fictitious Mexican state: New Austin, West Elizabeth, and Nuevo Paraiso. New Austin and West Elizabeth are adjacent {{to each other}} and share a southern border with Mexico. Nuevo Paraiso is a Mexican state, separated from U.S. territory by the San Luis river. The game takes place primarily in the year 1911, featuring the final decade of the American Frontier and the cowboy and outlaw archetypes that shaped it. <b>The</b> <b>landscape</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Wild West is beginning to fade and modern technologies like automobiles, machine guns, and oil drilling projects are beginning to appear.|$|E
5|$|The sheer {{magnitude}} of the flood event in the Anilao–Malbasag watershed made the region more vulnerable to future flood events. Hillsides became more unstable and the rivers themselves were clogged with debris, raising their water levels and widening their banks. In a post-disaster assessment in October 1992, it was stated that swift cooperation of all agencies from local to governmental was necessary to prevent tragedies of similar caliber in the future. It was urged that residents still living along the river banks be relocated to safer areas; however, {{by the time of}} the report, people had already begun repopulating the area. As a way of avoiding similar breaching of the riverbank, it was suggested that the two rivers be dredged and possibly re-channeled. Several points were also brought up about rehabilitating <b>the</b> <b>landscape</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> watershed: reforestation, contoured farming, and redesigning of plantations to better retain rainwater. Long-term rehabilitation of the watershed was deemed necessary in addition to repairing infrastructure in Ormoc.|$|E
