In treatment-naïve patients chronically infected with HIV type 1 (HIV- 1), it was previously shown through Sanger sequencing that TDR was more common in {{men who have sex}} with men (MSM) than in other transmission risk groups. We aimed to compare two HIV- 1 <b>transmission</b> <b>groups</b> in terms of the presence of TDR mutations. Methods: We investigated, through Sanger sequencing and ultradeep sequencing (UDS), the presence of resistance mutations, both in majority (> 20 %) and in minority (1 − 20 %) proportions, in 70 treatment-naïve MSM and 70 treatment-naïve heterosexual patients who recently screened positive for HIV- 1. Results: The global prevalence of TDR was not significantly different between the two groups, either by Sanger or by UDS. Nevertheless, a higher frequency of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor TDR was observed among heterosexual patients (P = 0. 04). There was also a trend for a higher frequency of TDR among MSM infected with HIV- 1 subtype B compared with MSM infected with HIV- 1 non-B subtypes (P = 0. 06). Conclusions:Ultradeep sequencing UDS allowed sensitive monitoring of TDR, and highlighted some disparities between <b>transmission</b> <b>groups...</b>|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Current {{public health}} efforts often use {{molecular}} technologies {{to identify and}} contain communicable disease networks, but not for HIV. Here, we investigate how molecular epidemiology {{can be used to}} identify highly related HIV networks within a population and how voluntary contact tracing of sexual partners can be used to selectively target these networks. METHODS: We evaluated the use of HIV- 1 pol sequences obtained from participants of a community-recruited cohort (n = 268) and a primary infection research cohort (n = 369) to define highly related transmission clusters and the use of contact tracing to link other individuals (n = 36) within these clusters. The presence of transmitted drug resistance was interpreted from the pol sequences (Calibrated Population Resistance v 3. 0). RESULTS: Phylogenetic clustering was conservatively defined when the genetic distance between any two pol sequences was less than 1 %, which identified 34 distinct transmission clusters within the combined community-recruited and primary infection research cohorts containing 160 individuals. Although sequences from the epidemiologically linked partners represented approximately 5 % of the total sequences, they clustered with 60 % of the sequences that clustered from the combined cohorts (odds ratio 21. 7; P < or = 0. 01). Major resistance to at least one class of antiretroviral medication was found in 19 % of clustering sequences. CONCLUSION: Phylogenetic methods can be used to identify individuals who are within highly related <b>transmission</b> <b>groups,</b> and contact tracing of epidemiologically linked partners of recently infected individuals can be used to link into previously defined <b>transmission</b> <b>groups.</b> These methods could be used to implement selectively targeted prevention interventions...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — To {{save the}} {{precious}} wireless network resources, the mobile wireless networks demand high bandwidth efficiency of error-control schemes for mobile multicast services, which {{is defined as}} the average fraction of data packets among all the packets (including redundancy packets) transmitted. We derive an upper-bound of bandwidth efficiency and its supremum for hybrid ARQ-FEC schemes applied in mobile multicast with diverse reliability Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, which suggests that a large <b>transmission</b> <b>group</b> size is necessary and effective to achieve high bandwidth efficiency. By introducing the concept of effective packet-loss probability for mobile multicast, we explain the obtained upper-bound and develop a method to provide guidance for selection of the <b>transmission</b> <b>group</b> size. To achieve high bandwidth efficiency for mobile multicast, we propose an efficient correlated random mapping structure for the adaptive graph-code-based error-control scheme, which can closely approaching the least upper-bound of bandwidth efficiency with the increasing of <b>transmission</b> <b>group</b> size. Furthermore, by analyzing the effective packet-loss probability under burst losses, which frequently occur in mobile wireless networks, we apply the block interleaving scheme to improve the bandwidth efficiency for mobile multicast. Also conducted is a set of numerical and simulation results which evaluate the performance of our proposed schemes. Simulation results show that our proposed schemes can achieve high bandwidth efficiency for mobile multicast under various reliability-QoS requirements and channel conditions.

40|$|Abstract Background Feed-borne {{spread of}} Salmonella spp. to pigs has been {{documented}} several times {{in recent years in}} Sweden. Experiences from the field suggest that feed-associated serotypes might be less transmittable and subsequently easier to eradicate from pig herds than other serotypes more commonly associated to pigs. Four Salmonella serotypes were selected for experimental studies in pigs in order to study transmissibility and compare possible differences between feed-assoociated (S Cubana and S Yoruba) and pig-associated serotypes (S Derby and S Typhimurium). Methods Direct contact transmission was studied in four groups of pigs formed by six 10 -week-old salmonella negative pigs commingled with two fatteners excreting one of the four salmonella serotypes. Indirect transmission was studied by putting six 10 -week-old salmonella negative pigs in each of four salmonella contaminated rooms. Each room had previously housed a group of pigs, excreting one of the four selected serotypes. All pigs were monitored for two weeks with respect to the faecal excretion of salmonella and the presence of serum antibodies. At the end of the trial, eight samples from inner tissues and organs were collected from each pig at necropsy. Results In the four direct <b>transmission</b> <b>groups,</b> one pig shed Salmonella (Cubana) at one occasion. At necropsy, S Typhimurium was isolated from one pig. In the indirect <b>transmission</b> <b>groups,</b> two pigs in the Yoruba room and one pig in each of the other rooms were excreting detectable levels of Salmonella once during the study period of two weeks. At necropsy, S Derby was isolated from one of six pigs in the Derby room and S Typhimurium was isolated from four of the six pigs in the Typhimurium room. No significant serological response could be detected in any of the 48 pigs. Conclusions These results show that all four selected serotypes were able to be transmitted in {{at least one of these}} field-like trials, but the transmission rate was low in all groups and no obvious differences between feed-associated and pig-associated serotypes in the transmission to naïve pigs and their subsequent faecal shedding were revealed. However, the post mortem results indicated a higher detection of S Typhimurium in the ileocecal lymph nodes of pigs introduced into a contaminated environment in comparison with the other three serotypes. </p...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe precise {{effects of}} HIV- 1 on the gut {{microbiome}} are unclear. Initial cross-sectional studies provided contradictory associations between microbial richness and HIV serostatus and suggested shifts from Bacteroides to Prevotella predominance following HIV- 1 infection, {{which have not}} been found in animal models or in studies matched for HIV- 1 <b>transmission</b> <b>groups.</b> In two independent cohorts of HIV- 1 -infected subjects and HIV- 1 -negative controls in Barcelona (n= 156) and Stockholm (n= 84), {{men who have sex}} with men (MSM) predominantly belonged to the Prevotella-rich enterotype whereas most non-MSM subjects were enriched in Bacteroides, independently of HIV- 1 status, and with only a limited contribution of diet effects. Moreover, MSM had a significantly richer and more diverse fecal microbiota than non-MSM individuals. After stratifying for sexual orientation, there was no solid evidence of an HIV-specific dysbiosis. However, HIV- 1 infection remained consistently associated with reduced bacterial richness, the lowest bacterial richness being observed in subjects with a virological-immune discordant response to antiretroviral therapy. Our findings indicate that HIV gut microbiome studies must control for HIV risk factors and suggest interventions on gut bacterial richness as possible novel avenues to improve HIV- 1 -associated immune dysfunction...|$|E

We investigated the potential association between HIV- 1 genotypes and the risk behaviors. In the heterosexuals, the most predominant strains were CRF 01 _AE (58.8  %), followed by CRF 07 _BC (23.5  %). Similarly, in the homosexuals, the most predominant stains were also CRF 01 _AE (61.5  %), followed by CRF 07 _BC (23.1  %).

On its basis we define, for each subprocess, the dwell {{time as well as}} the local (exact) and asymptotic (extrapolated) group times. Our concept of the asymptotic <b>transmission</b> <b>group</b> time confirms the validity of the Wigner phase time in the opaque limit, as well as the existence of the usual and generalized Hartman effects predicted on its basis. On the energy scale, this concept is valid everywhere in the high energy region {{as well as in the}} low energy region, excepting resonance points and their neighborhoods. On the contrary, the Buttiker dwell time is valid, as the transmission time, just only at the resonance points. Our concept of the transmission dwell time predicts monotonous growth of the tunneling time when the distance between the opaque barriers increases. By our approach only this time scale yields the true time spent, on average, by transmitted particles in the region occupied by the system. We explain why the asymptotic and local <b>transmission</b> <b>group</b> times cannot play this role and why the concept of <b>transmission</b> <b>group</b> velocity lies beyond the scope of special relativity.

In both, geographical patterns of socio-demographic variables correlate with different patterns of the spread of the AIDS epidemic through the <b>transmission</b> <b>groups.</b> Recent trends of the AIDS epidemic in Brazil: the displacement toward medium sized cities and expansion frontiers, increasing report of AIDS cases among the poor and underprivileged, changes in the pattern of transmission with proportional augmentation of heterosexual transmission and IDUs as <b>transmission</b> <b>groups,</b> are described and analised. The geographical distribution of the AIDS cases registered between 1987 - 1993 in Brazil throughout the Brazilian States is evaluated by means of worksheets, maps, and non-parametric statistics. Results show that Gravimetric Centers (obtained by the use of the calculus spatial means) of AIDS in Brazil are situated within a triangle the sides of which are formed lines joining the three main metropolitan areas of the wealthiest region of Brazil - the southeast, i. e.

Mice from each group were sacrificed daily. Organ viral loads and gene expression profiles were evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR. Both groups of mice infected with high-dose POWV showed severe neurological signs of disease preceding death. The presence of SGE did not affect POWV transmission or disease outcome for mice infected with the high dose of POWV. Neu-roinvasion, paralysis, and death occurred for all mice infected with the low dose of POWV plus SGE; however, for mice infected with the low dose of POWV in the absence of SGE, there were no clinical signs of infection and nomice succumbed to disease. Although this group displayed low-level viremias, all mice were completely healthy, and it was the only group in which POWV was cleared from the lymph nodes.
