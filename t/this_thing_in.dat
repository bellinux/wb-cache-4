500|$|In a June 2011 Kerrang! interview, Lee {{said that}} the album would be self-titled and was [...] "about the band; it's more of a band record." [...] Lee {{explained}} that the concept [...] "to me is about falling back {{in love with this}} thing, with Evanescence, with what I've obsessed over for a decade, longer than that." [...] There were originally many album-title ideas, but Lee said that as the project became more collaborative [...] "it just felt like this is who we are, it's a band. And to have that feeling in the music where the band is so pumped up, it was just the only title that felt right. It's about falling back in love with <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> a major way." [...] In an MTV News interview, she said that 16 songs had been recorded but not all would be included on the album. It was later decided to release two versions of the album: a deluxe edition with all 16 songs and a standard edition with 12.|$|E

I really wanted that European feel of cold mountains, big forests, that sort of spirit was {{important}} to me. Luckily we did get to shoot it in Germany which is the homeland of the fairy tale. Shooting in natural outdoor sets {{is very important to}} me, compared to working on a sound stage." [...] It took place in Germany, at the Babelsberg Studio in Potsdam-Babelsberg, in a filming location at an old forest near Berlin (production designer Stephen Scott said that he searched for and found what he believed looked like a [...] "medieval forest" [...] free of human interference) and in the city of Braunschweig in Lower Saxony. After the film was delayed to 2013, the crew did a [...] "couple" [...] of re-shoots, including [...] "a little bit" [...] in the deserts of California (filming the post-ending scene, an extended version of which was also released in a promotional clip [...] "The Desert Witch").|$|E
500|$|The track [...] "Old Age", whose organ intro was {{featured}} on the band's cover of [...] "Credit In The Straight World" [...] from Live Through This, was revealed to have originally written by Kurt Cobain; Love stated in a 1997 interview that [...] "Old Age" [...] was [...] "partly someone else's composition. It's something somebody {{had a little bit}} of and I said 'let me have the rest of it' and I wrote <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> it and tried to make it goth. I found it, wrote it, and recorded it the same night." [...] It was later revealed that a version of the song was recorded by Nirvana during the Nevermind (1991) recording sessions, but Cobain threw the song out, later giving the melody to Love, who rearranged musical pieces and rewrote the lyrics. Two live cover versions were included on the album: [...] "Season of the Witch" [...] by Donovan, and [...] "He Hit Me (And It Felt Like a Kiss)", which was written by Carole King and recorded by The Crystals in the 1960s. Love referred to it as a [...] "feminist anthem" [...] after performing it during MTV Unplugged in 1995.|$|E

500|$|Several {{weeks before}} the gold {{certification}} of Fillmore East and their rehabilitation, the band headed to Miami's Criteria Studios with producer Tom Dowd {{to work on their}} third studio album. The band first began recording the album one month prior, when they laid down the initial tracks for [...] "Blue Sky". The band saved money on studio time by writing and debuting songs on the road. The band worked on three songs: [...] "Blue Sky", an instrumental titled [...] "The Road to Calico" [...] (which would eventually develop into [...] "Stand Back", with added vocals) and [...] "Little Martha", the only song solely credited to Duane Allman. The band laid down these three songs and went back on the road for a short run of shows, and at this point several checked into rehab. After Duane's death, the band held a meeting on their future; it was clear all wanted to continue, and after a short period, the band returned to the road. Drummer Butch Trucks later said, [...] "We all had <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> us and Duane put it there. He was the teacher and he gave something to us—his disciples—that we had to play out".|$|E

The band returned to Miami in December to complete work on their third studio album. Completing the recording of Eat a Peach raised each member's spirits; [...] "The music brought life back to us all, and it was simultaneously realized by every one of us. We found strength, vitality, newness, reason, and belonging as we worked on finishing Eat a Peach," [...] said Allman. [...] "Those last three songs [...] just kinda floated right on out of us [...] The music was still good, it was still rich, and it still had that energy—it was still the Allman Brothers Band." [...] Released in February 1972, Eat a Peach was the band's second hit album, shipping gold and peaking at number four on Billboard Top 200 Pop Albums chart. [...] "We'd been through hell, but somehow we were rolling bigger than ever," [...] said Gregg Allman.|$|E
500|$|As {{the record}} neared {{completion}} by August 2003, the band performed {{for a short}} time for the armed forces in the Middle East and premiered more new songs at their Reading and Leeds sets. The trio shot small, home-made videos for several songs on Blink-182, as well as the official music video for [...] "Feeling This", the song they picked as the first single. The band spent time to finalize the CD booklet and album artwork in September. Mark Hoppus stated that the album was so [...] "personal to all three of us that we really wanted to be involved in every aspect of it." [...] The release date kept getting missed and pushed back to the point where Jordan Schur, then-president of Geffen Records, made calls asking, [...] "What is the absolute last possible second that we can turn <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> and still make our release date?" [...] DeLonge described the final days of mixing the album as [...] "crazy stressful", with [...] "literally hours to turn [...] to have it come it out on time." [...] The album was in production so late that final mixes were still being judged by Hoppus, DeLonge, and Barker the night before the album was sent to the pressing plant. For Barker, he later considered it his favorite time in the band's history, commenting, [...] "That was a good time in my life. I was smoking just enough weed and taking just enough pills." ...|$|E
