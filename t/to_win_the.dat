5|$|At Bound for Glory, Anderson {{failed in}} his attempt <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> TNA World Heavyweight Championship when Jeff Hardy, with Hulk Hogan, and Eric Bischoff's assistance, pinned him in a {{three-way}} match (which also included Kurt Angle) <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> title, ending his partnership with Hardy in the process. On the October 21 edition of Impact!, Anderson was {{given an opportunity to}} earn a shot at Hardy and the TNA World Heavyweight Championship at Turning Point; {{all he had to do}} was survive an Ultimate X match with Fortune member Kazarian. Kazarian managed <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> match, following interference from his stable mates, but Anderson persevered and thus earned himself a World Heavyweight title shot against Hardy, who attacked him after the match. However, during the attack, Anderson suffered a legitimate concussion, which would sideline him for a few weeks and prevented him from taking part in the title match.|$|E
