5|$|Dutch {{explorer}} Abel Tasman sighted New Zealand in 1642 {{and called}} it Staten Landt, supposing it was connected to a landmass {{of the same name}} at the southern tip of South America.

5|$|Galileo {{initially}} {{called his}} discovery the Cosmica Sidera ("Cosimo's stars"), {{in honour of}} Cosimo II de' Medici (1590–1621). At Cosimo's suggestion, Galileo changed <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>to</b> Medicea Sidera ("the Medician stars"), honouring all four Medici brothers (Cosimo, Francesco, Carlo, and Lorenzo). The discovery was announced in the Sidereus Nuncius ("Starry Messenger"), published in Venice in March 1610, {{less than two months}} after the first observations.|$|E

5|$|The French {{astronomer}} Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille {{first described}} the constellation in French as la Machine Pneumatique (the Pneumatic Machine) in 1751–52, commemorating the air pump invented by the French physicist Denis Papin. De Lacaille had observed and catalogued almost 10,000 southern stars during a two-year {{stay at the}} Cape of Good Hope, devising fourteen new constellations in uncharted regions of the Southern Celestial Hemisphere not visible from Europe. He named all but one in honour of instruments that symbolised the Age of Enlightenment. Lacaille depicted Antlia as a single-cylinder vacuum pump used in Papin's initial experiments, while German astronomer Johann Bode chose the more advanced double-cylinder version. Lacaille Latinised <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>to</b> Antlia pneumatica on his 1763 chart. English astronomer John Herschel proposed shrinking <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>to</b> one word in 1844, noting that Lacaille himself had abbreviated his constellations thus on occasion. This was universally adopted. The International Astronomical Union adopted {{it as one of}} the 88 modern constellations in 1922.|$|E
5|$|The {{lake was}} known to French explorers as Lac des Prairies. Thomas Spence chose <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>to</b> refer to a new {{republic}} he proposed for the area south of the lake.

5|$|The name Pluto, {{after the}} god of the underworld, was {{proposed}} by Venetia Burney (1918–2009), an eleven-year-old schoolgirl in Oxford, England, who was interested in classical mythology.

Davidson's dogs descended from earlier terrier owning families, including the Allans of Holystone, Northumberland.|$|E

5|$|Although he {{was neither}} aesthetically nor {{technically}} {{among the best}} batsmen, Leyland {{had a reputation for}} batting well under pressure. He performed most effectively against the best teams and bowlers, and in difficult situations; his Test batting record is better than his first-class figures, and against Australia his average is even higher. Outside of Tests, he had some success with the ball, and {{had it not been for}} the depth of spin bowling in Yorkshire, he might have been a leading bowler. He was one of the first to bowl left-arm wrist-spin, and may have invented <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>to</b> describe such deliveries—"chinamen". Very popular with team-mates and spectators, Leyland had a reputation as a humorist, and many stories were told about him.|$|E
5|$|Although often {{assumed to}} be a debate of recent origins, local Washington, D.C. {{newspapers}} have published news items on the controversy many times since at least 1971, all in response to Native American individuals or organizations asking for <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>to</b> be changed. National protests began in 1988, after the team's Super Bowl XXII victory, prompting numerous Native Americans to write letters to Redskins owner Jack Kent Cooke; others boycotted Redskins products and protested, but Cooke rejected the possibility of change. There was a protest of about 2,000 people at the 1992 Super Bowl between the Redskins and the Buffalo Bills; the American Indian Movement's (AIM) Vernon Bellecourt {{was one of the main}} organizers of the protest.|$|E
5|$|As the SS grew in {{size and}} importance, so too did Hitler's {{personal}} protection units. Three main SS groups were assigned to protect Hitler. In 1933, his larger personal bodyguard unit (previously the 1st SS-Standarte) was called to Berlin to replace the Army Chancellery Guard, assigned to protect the Chancellor of Germany. Sepp Dietrich commanded the new unit, previously known as SS-Stabswache Berlin; the name was changed to SS-Sonderkommando Berlin. In November 1933, the name was changed to Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler. In April 1934, Himmler modified <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>to</b> Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler (LSSAH). The LSSAH guarded Hitler's private residences and offices, providing an outer ring of protection for the Führer and his visitors. LSSAH men manned sentry posts at the entrances to the old Reich Chancellery and the new Reich Chancellery. The number of LSSAH guards was increased during special events. At the Berghof, Hitler's residence in the Obersalzberg, a large contingent of the LSSAH patrolled an extensive cordoned security zone.|$|E

25|$|In 1969 <b>the</b> <b>naming</b> {{conventions}} for hurricanes {{were not}} strictly controlled {{as they are}} today.

5|$|In 1900, the English {{scientist}} George Ernest Shelley {{used the}} spelling Necrospa in a book, thereby creating a junior synonym; however, he attributed <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>to</b> zoologist Philip Sclater. In 1967, the American ornithologist James Greenway {{suggested that the}} Rodrigues starling should belong in the same genus as the hoopoe starling, Fregilupus, due to the similarity of the species. More subfossils found in 1974 added support to {{the claim that the}} Rodrigues bird was a distinct genus of starling. The stouter bill is mainly what warrants generic separation from Fregilupus. In 2014, the British palaeontologist Julian P. Hume described a new extinct species, the Mauritius starling (Cryptopsar ischyrhynchus), based on subfossils from Mauritius. It was shown to be closer to the Rodrigues starling than to the hoopoe starling, due to the features of its skull, sternum and humerus. Until then, the Rodrigues starling was the only Mascarene passerine bird named from fossil material.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, Bush {{established}} Arbusto Energy, a small {{oil exploration}} company, {{although it did}} not begin operations until the following year. He later changed <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>to</b> Bush Exploration. In 1984, his company merged with the larger Spectrum 7, and Bush became chairman. The company was hurt by decreased oil prices, and it folded into HKN, Inc., with Bush becoming a member of HKN's board of directors. Questions of possible insider trading involving HKN arose, but a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigation concluded that the information Bush {{had at the time}} of his stock sale was not sufficient to constitute insider trading.|$|E
5|$|In {{recent years}} the Ritz has taken {{measures}} to enforce their trademark against infringement. Lawyers have notified competitors using <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>to</b> surrender their websites and Facebook accounts marketing under the trademark, {{even though they had}} been using these names for many years. The Desborough Ritz, which had been using the name since the 1930s, changed its name in 2012 after being advised by solicitors to do so. That same year, a Northamptonshire wedding location named The Ritz changed its name to the Banqueting & Conference Suites at the Kettering Ritz after another notification. The Brighouse Ritz, which has operated under the name since 1938, was notified in 2017 to change its name or face legal action.|$|E
