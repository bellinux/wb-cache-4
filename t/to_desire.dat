5|$|The Dawn of Love {{intentionally}} {{presents a}} moral dilemma to viewers. By his open depiction of nudity and sensuality, Etty makes {{the same argument}} as that presented by Comus, that it is rational for the viewer to succumb to their lustful thoughts while in private. The picture presents the same moral challenge to the viewer as that which Comus presents to The Lady, that of remaining true to her better, moral and rational, nature, despite there being no apparent disadvantage in surrendering <b>to</b> <b>desire.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{work of the}} Westminster Assembly was repudiated by the Church of England {{during the}} Restoration in 1660. The Act of Uniformity 1662, a law {{requiring}} even greater adherence to the Book of Common Prayer and support for episcopalianism than had previously been required, forced Puritan ministers to leave the Church. Though some presbyterians continued <b>to</b> <b>desire</b> to be readmitted to the established church, restrictions on worship for non-conformists led to presbyterians putting aside differences with congregationalists and adopting congregational church orders.|$|E
5|$|In addition, Andriamasinavalona is {{credited}} with founding Ambohimanga, a site of spiritual and historical significance that was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2001. Oral history recounts that Andriamasinavalona first remarked a distant hill named Ambohitrakanga when he noticed a bonfire lit on its southern face 24 kilometers away from his rova at Antananarivo; the visibility of the site from his capital led Andriamasinavalona <b>to</b> <b>desire</b> the hill as a residence for his son, Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana. Andriamasinavalona gave the hill its current name, and when he divided the Kingdom of Imerina into four quadrants in 1710, he gave the eastern quadrant of Avaradrano to Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana, who transformed his rova at Ambohimanga into its capital.|$|E

5|$|Nietzsche {{rejected}} fundamental {{components of}} Kant's ethics, particularly his argument that morality, God, and immorality, {{can be shown}} through reason. Nietzsche cast suspicion {{on the use of}} moral intuition, which Kant used as the foundation of his morality, arguing that it has no normative force in ethics. He further attempted to undermine key concepts in Kant's moral psychology, such as the will and pure reason. Like Kant, Nietzsche developed a concept of autonomy; however, he rejected Kant's idea that valuing our own autonomy requires us to respect the autonomy of others. A naturalist reading of Nietzsche's moral psychology stands contrary to Kant's conception of reason and desire. Under the Kantian model, reason is a fundamentally different motive <b>to</b> <b>desire</b> because it has the capacity to stand back from a situation and make an independent decision. Nietzsche conceives of the self as a social structure of all our different drives and motivations; thus, when it seems that our intellect has made a decision against our drives, it is actually just an alternative drive taking dominance over another. This is in direct contrast with Kant's view of the intellect as opposed to instinct; instead, it is just another instinct. There is thus no self-capable of standing back and making a decision; the decision the self-makes is simply determined by the strongest drive. Kantian commentators have argued that Nietzsche's practical philosophy requires the existence of a self-capable of standing back in the Kantian sense. For an individual to create values of their own, which is a key idea in Nietzsche's philosophy, they must be able to conceive of themselves as a unified agent. Even if the agent is influenced by their drives, he must regard them as his own, which undermines Nietzsche's conception of autonomy.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} settlement at {{the height}} of Ambohimanga was most likely established in the 15th century, coinciding {{with the arrival of the}} Merina in the highlands. Rice paddies took the place of the original valley forests by the 16th century, and the growing population near the valleys around Ambohimanga became known by the clan name Tantsaha ("people of the cultivated land"). According to oral history, however, the first to settle the site of the Ambohimanga rova was Andriamborona, the dethroned prince of the highland territory of Imamo, who relocated to the then-unpopulated hilltop in around 1700 accompanied by his nephew, his wife, and his mother, Ratompobe. Merina king Andriamasinavalona (1675–1710), who reigned over Imerina from his royal compound in Antananarivo, noticed a bonfire lit by the family on the southern face of the hill 24 kilometers away. The visibility of the site from his capital led Andriamasinavalona <b>to</b> <b>desire</b> Ambohimanga as a residence for his son, Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana. Andriamborona and his family agreed to shift three times to different parts of the hill, including the future site of the royal compound of Bevato, in response to consecutive requests from the king. For a short time he and the prince lived in neighboring houses at Bevato before Andriamborona and his family finally left the hill for the distant highland village of Ambatolampy, where he lived the rest of his life; the king retrieved their bodies for burial at Ambohimanga.|$|E

25|$|Krems, Neel, Neuberg, Puts and Kenrick (2016) {{also found}} that women created larger social {{distance}} between themselves and a competing female, but only if she was ovulating and attractive. Similarly, this only occurred if the woman was partnered with a desirable mate. This is suggested to be because other females, especially those who are ovulating, are less likely <b>to</b> <b>desire</b> men that have limited resources.|$|E

The Yuezhi were agricultural people who produced strong horses and many unknown crops including alfalfa for animal fodder. However, the Yuezhi were too settled <b>to</b> <b>desire</b> war against the Xiongnu. Zhang spent a year in Yuezhi and the adjacent Bactrian territory, documenting their cultures, lifestyles and economy, before beginning his return trip to China, this time following the southern edge of the Tarim Basin.|$|E
25|$|In April 1795, Prince Michał Hieronim Radziwiłł and {{his wife}} {{traveled}} to Berlin with their daughter Christina and son Antoni; on 1 May, they were presented at the royal court at Bellevue Palace. The Radziwiłłs were a Polish Catholic family {{that belonged to the}} oldest and most renowned of dynasties in Poland, and were also in possession of much wealth. They were great favorites with Louise's parents, and frequently dined at their home. As time went by, Louise and Antoni began <b>to</b> <b>desire</b> to marry. While many of her family members were in favor of such a match, her mother, never close with Louise, disapproved. Her parents eventually gave their full consent on the assurance that she would live near them during her marriage.|$|E

Edwards got retaliation for his incident with Keselowski a lap later by spinning him out on the front stretch. Keselowski turned airborne, barrel-rolled once (despite both roof flaps on his car deploying), and crashed on the driver's side door on the catch-fence. The crash was instantly described by NASCAR on Fox commentators Mike Joy and Darrell Waltrip as being eerily similar to the finish of the 2009 Aaron's 499 at Talladega the year before, when Keselowski turned Edwards into the catch fencing in the tri-oval on the last lap to win the race, causing Edwards to get airborne.|$|E
25|$|Female {{resistance}} to mate guarding {{has also been}} researched {{in the context of}} the menstrual cycle. Pillsworth, Haselton and Buss (2004) found that women are more likely to want to mate with males they are not currently pair bonded with during the ovulation period of their menstrual cycle. They also show higher mate guarding resistance in general during oestrus. This is supported by the finding that during ovulation women who are both single or in a monogamous partnership with a man are more likely <b>to</b> <b>desire</b> to go to social gatherings where they may meet alternative mates. This is said to support the female dual mating strategy theory, as during oestrus women may be seeking out mates with strong genes.|$|E
25|$|As Janissaries {{became aware}} of their own {{importance}} they began <b>to</b> <b>desire</b> a better life. By the early 17th century Janissaries had such prestige and influence that they dominated the government. They could mutiny and dictate policy and hinder efforts to modernize the army structure. They could change Sultans as they wished through palace coups. They made themselves landholders and tradesmen. They would also limit the enlistment to the sons of former Janissaries {{who did not have}} to go through the original training period in the acemi oğlan, as well as avoiding the physical selection, thereby reducing their military value. When Janissaries could practically extort money from the Sultan and business and family life replaced martial fervour, their effectiveness as combat troops decreased. The northern borders of the Ottoman Empire slowly began to shrink southwards after the second Battle of Vienna in 1683.|$|E
