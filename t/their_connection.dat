5|$|A {{more mundane}} {{example is the}} {{presence}} of astrological symbols found on some shoes and sandals from the Roman Empire. The use of shoes and sandals is well known, but Carol van Driel-Murray has proposed that astrological symbols etched onto sandals gave the footwear spiritual or medicinal meanings. This is supported through citation of other known uses of astrological symbols and <b>their</b> <b>connection</b> to medical practice and with the historical records of the time.|$|E
5|$|After Molly's father died, {{her family}} {{returned}} to Canajoharie. On September 9, 1753, Molly's mother married Brant Kanagaradunkwa, a Mohawk sachem of the Turtle clan. Possibly to reinforce <b>their</b> <b>connection</b> to Brant Kanagaradunkwa, {{who was a}} prominent leader, Molly and Joseph took their stepfather's name as a surname, which was unusual for that time.|$|E

This, they hoped, would strengthen the legitimacy of their claim to the throne. In 1722, however, Richard Hay, a Scottish historian, presented strong evidence {{that not only was}} James not a descendant of Fleance, but also that neither Fleance nor Banquo ever even existed. Most modern scholars now agree that Fleance is not a real historical figure.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} 1940s, Coggins {{obtained}} more work producing war pictures for other magazines, including {{a series of}} double-page spreads for the controversial newspaper PM, and illustrations for The Saturday Evening Post. Throughout the war years, most of the output of many large corporations was reserved for materiel production; however, management were keen to promote <b>their</b> <b>connection</b> {{to the war effort}} and keep their name before the buying public until they could resume peacetime sales. Coggins received advertising commissions from such corporations including Elco, Koppers, US Steel, and Westinghouse. He also received commissions from the U.S. War Department for aircraft recognition charts, and he was intrigued to later find these charts used during his army basic training.|$|E

5|$|Heathen deities are {{not seen}} as perfect, omnipotent, and omnipresent, and are instead viewed as having their own {{strengths}} and weaknesses. Many practitioners believe that these deities will one day die, as did, for instance, the god Baldr in Norse mythology. Heathens view <b>their</b> <b>connection</b> with their deities not as being that of a master and servant but rather as an interdependent relationship akin {{to that of a}} family. For them, these deities serve as both examples and role models whose behavior is to be imitated. Many practitioners believe that they can communicate with these deities, as well as negotiate, bargain, and argue with them, and hope that through venerating them, practitioners will gain wisdom, understanding, power, or visionary insights.|$|E

At the same time, Jonas attempts to both aid them and look after himself after being captured by Whispers, who is now involved in a cat-and-mouse game with Will, each of them trying to outsmart the other.|$|E
5|$|Rose Hill {{is largely}} {{made up of}} nineteenth-century architecture, with some {{contemporary}} buildings. The campus is home to several structures on the National Register of Historic Places, such as the University Church built in 1845 as a seminary chapel and parish church for the surrounding community. It contains the altar from Old St. Patrick's Cathedral, as well as stained glass windows given to the university by King Louis Philippe I of France. The windows are particularly notable for <b>their</b> <b>connection</b> to a workshop in Sevres, France, locus of the earliest stages of the Gothic Revival. Adjacent to the church is a 138-plot cemetery where the university's nineteenth-century Jesuits, diocesan seminarians, students, and workers are interred, relocated in 1890 from its original location at today's New York Botanical Garden.|$|E

5|$|Sirri Amer {{was close}} to King Farouk, and was {{nominated}} for {{the presidency of the}} Officer's Club—normally a ceremonial office—with the king's backing. Nasser was determined to establish the independence of the army from the monarchy, and with Amer as the intercessor, resolved to field a nominee for the Free Officers. They selected Muhammad Naguib, a popular general who had offered his resignation to Farouk in 1942 over British high-handedness and was wounded three times in the Palestine War. Naguib won overwhelmingly and the Free Officers, through <b>their</b> <b>connection</b> with a leading Egyptian daily, al-Misri, publicized his victory while praising the nationalistic spirit of the army.|$|E
5|$|Some {{aspects of}} the mysteries of Isis and of other mystery cults, {{particularly}} <b>their</b> <b>connection</b> with the afterlife, resemble important elements of Christianity. The {{question of whether the}} mysteries influenced Christianity is controversial and the evidence is unclear; some scholars today attribute the similarities to a shared cultural background rather than direct influence. In contrast, Apuleius's account has had direct effects in modern times. Through his description of them, the mysteries of Isis have influenced many works of fiction and modern fraternal organizations, as well as a widespread, though false, belief that the ancient Egyptians themselves had an elaborate system of mystery initiations.|$|E
5|$|Stanton's {{position}} {{caused a}} significant rift {{between herself and}} many civil rights leaders, particularly Frederick Douglass, who believed that white women, already empowered by <b>their</b> <b>connection</b> to fathers, husbands, and brothers, at least vicariously had the vote. According to Douglass, their treatment as slaves entitled the now liberated African American men, who lacked women's indirect empowerment, to voting rights before women were granted the franchise. African American women, he believed, {{would have the same}} degree of empowerment as white women once African American men had the vote; hence, general female suffrage was, according to Douglass, of less concern than black male suffrage.|$|E

5|$|The {{challenges}} and quests {{were developed to}} keep players occupied while playing through the story. Molyeux told Leach about the ways {{of good and evil}} and the system's reflection of the player's behaviour, and provided him with a digital copy of the Bible with instructions to study the concepts due to <b>their</b> <b>connection</b> with gods and men. Leach decided to supplement the idea of evil with mischief, as he thought being completely evil by annoying or killing followers was senseless. Molyneux wanted a conflict between good and evil, and for the enemy gods to have the opposite alignment to the player. As a method of introducing the player to miracles and combat, a god whose alignment {{is the same as the}} player's was added.|$|E
5|$|Tintin investigates when a fetish {{created by}} the Arumbaya tribe of South America is stolen from Brussels' Museum of Ethnography, only to be {{returned}} the following day. Tintin realises that the replacement is a fake, and draws a connection to a local sculptor Jacob Balthazar, who has recently been murdered. Balthazar's parrot—a witness to the murder—is obtained by two Hispanic men, Alonso Pérez and Ramón Bada, who try to kill Tintin when he begins to investigate <b>their</b> <b>connection</b> to the crime. From the parrot, Alonso and Ramón discover that Balthazar was murdered by Rodrígo Tortilla, and they follow him aboard a ship bound for South America. There, they murder Tortilla, but find {{that he did not}} have the original fetish. Tintin arranges their arrest when the ship docks at Los Dopicos, capital of San Theodoros.|$|E
5|$|Gabriel {{taps into}} <b>their</b> <b>connection</b> and reveals {{that he has}} located McClane's estranged daughter, Lucy, and intends to kidnap her. McClane and Farrell race to the Woodlawn facility, where Farrell discovers that Gabriel's men are {{downloading}} all the information. He manages to encrypt the data just in time before he is captured. Gabriel kidnaps Farrell and takes him as well as Lucy, who had been kidnapped earlier, with him as his team flees from Woodlawn. McClane pursues Gabriel, hijacking his semi and enlisting Warlock to trace Gabriel's vehicle. Gabriel accesses the communication system of a U.S. Marine Corps F-35B Lightning II and, impersonating an air traffic controller, orders the pilot to attack the truck McClane is driving. McClane barely escapes, then {{makes his way to}} a nearby warehouse where Warlock has tracked Gabriel. There, Gabriel is installing the remaining files and holding Lucy and Farrell. Although McClane kills most of Gabriel's remaining henchmen, Emerson shoots him in the right shoulder.|$|E

5|$|The {{construction}} of the line was strongly opposed by the S, which put forward a rival proposal {{that led to a}} Parliamentary enquiry. The two companies each had part of their schemes accepted and part rejected. The Ward Jackson group was allowed to build a railway east from Guisborough to Skinningrove with a branch at Slapewath to reach the mine at Skelton. They were not permitted to build their own separate line to Middlesbrough and had to rely instead on the M for <b>their</b> <b>connection</b> to the Tees. The S was allowed to build an extension from Redcar to Saltburn but was not allowed to build a new bridge across the Tees. An Act permitting the {{construction of}} the railway was passed in July 1858. The company was capitalised with £120,000, half of which came from the WHH, with Ward Jackson as its first chairman.|$|E
5|$|Karl Marx {{distinguished}} {{social classes}} by <b>their</b> <b>connection</b> to {{the means of}} production in the capitalist system: the bourgeoisie own the means, but this effectively includes the proletariat itself as the workers can only sell their own labour power (forming the material base of the cultural superstructure). Max Weber critiqued Marxist economic determinism, arguing that social stratification is not based purely on economic inequalities, but on other status and power differentials (e.g. patriarchy). According to Weber, stratification may occur among at least three complex variables: (1) Property (class): A person's economic position in a society, based on birth and individual achievement. Weber differs from Marx in that he does not see this as the supreme factor in stratification. Weber noted how managers of corporations or industries control firms they do not own; Marx would have placed such a person in the proletariat. (2) Prestige (status): A person's prestige, or popularity in a society. This could be determined by the kind of job this person does or wealth. and (3) Power (political party): A person's ability to get their way despite the resistance of others. For example, individuals in state jobs, such as an employee of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, or a member of the United States Congress, may hold little property or status but they still hold immense power Pierre Bourdieu provides a modern example in the concepts of cultural and symbolic capital. Theorists such as Ralf Dahrendorf have noted the tendency towards an enlarged middle-class in modern Western societies, particularly in relation to the necessity of an educated work force in technological or service-based economies. Perspectives concerning globalization, such as dependency theory, suggest this effect owes to the shift of workers to the developing countries.|$|E
5|$|On Halloween, Michael and Elliott dress E.T. as a ghost so {{they can}} sneak {{him out of the}} house. That night, Elliott and E.T. head through the forest, where they make a {{successful}} call home. The next day, Elliott wakes up in the field, only to find E.T. gone. Elliott returns home to his distressed family. Michael searches for and finds E.T. dying next to a culvert, being investigated by a raccoon. Michael takes E.T. home to Elliott, who is also dying. Mary becomes frightened when she discovers her son's illness and the dying alien, just as government agents invade the house. Scientists set up a hospital at the house, questioning Michael, Mary and Gertie while treating Elliott and E.T. <b>Their</b> <b>connection</b> disappears and E.T. then appears to die while Elliott recovers. A grief-stricken Elliott is left alone with the motionless E.T. when he notices a dead chrysanthemum, the plant E.T. had previously revived, coming back to life. E.T. reanimates and reveals that his people are returning. Elliott and Michael steal a van that E.T. had been loaded into and a chase ensues, with Michael's friends joining them as they attempt to evade the authorities by bicycles. Suddenly facing a police roadblock, they escape as E.T. uses telekinesis to lift them into the air and toward the forest, like he had done for Elliott before.|$|E
