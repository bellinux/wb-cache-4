5000|$|The interior, {{a single}} large space, is divided along its central axis by {{a row of}} large timber posts {{supporting}} a timber beam which run from the front {{to the rear of}} the store. Male oriented departments are located to the east and female to the west of the axis. High level windows run along the upper part of the side wall which faces east southeast; the opposite wall has no window openings. Connecting the service areas on the easterly and westerly sides of the store with an elevated cash desk is a suspended wire system. The cash desk is located on the central axis near the rear of the store. An ornate metal and <b>timber</b> cash <b>carrier</b> known as a [...] "flying fox" [...] transports change between the service areas and the cash desk via this system of taut wires.|$|R

5|$|A western rock lobster fishery {{developed}} {{on the island}} in the early 20th century. There are records of the island {{being used as a}} base for crayfishers as early as 1902, and for many years it was used as an anchorage by anglers. It was not until 1947, however, that a seasonally inhabited permanent camp was established there. According to former crayfisher Ron Bertelsen, the first camp was established by skippers George Barker and George Nelson and deckhand John Long, who relocated there when lobsters around Pigeon Island grew scarce. They camped {{at the southern end of}} North Island in a camp initially built from packing case <b>timbers.</b> A local <b>carrier</b> boat, the Betty Margaret, serviced the camp. From about 40 seasonal inhabitants in 1940, the population grew to about 130 by 2003. An airstrip was built in 1979.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1800s many {{thousands}} of cargo ships were to pass between Lands End and Falmouth on their travels. Even in the early 1700s and 1800s there were still many Privateers on the water from countries including France and Spain out to capture a prize from around the Lizard. In September 1725, after a severe storm and South Westerly gales, six ships {{were lost in the}} Mounts Bay and most of the crew were drowned. Two of these ships were smugglers, three were coastal coal carriers and one was a Norwegian <b>Timber</b> <b>carrier.</b> Many of the English ships travelled in convoy with an armed Naval vessel on their journey around the English coast. In May 1781 a French Privateer, an armed Lugger Defiance under the command of Lieutenant Louis Le Ture with 45 men onboard was chased from Mullion Island by a Naval Vessel, under the charge of a Captain Curlyon placed there for the purpose by the Admiralty. The chase lasted for 14 hours before it was captured. The Privateer had sailed from St Malo two days earlier on a mission to capture ships off the Cornish Coast. Many of the French crew would have been placed on captured prize ships and returned them to France. In some storms here convoys could lose their armed escort and become easy targets for the Privateers. Witnesses onshore at Marazion could supply no help and could only watch as two Privateers took two unnamed large sailing ships,a schooner from St. Ives and a brig from Swansea in one day in February 1746. But it was not just on the sea that ships became vulnerable. In January 1817 the Resolution, a brigantine sailing from Oporto to London carrying wine and fruit was wrecked on the west Lizard Coast. Locals attacked the ship taking away all the property of the Captain and crew, and 4/5ths of the cargo of wine and in two days damaged the ship beyond repair. About 14 Dragoons were sent from Helston but failed to control the crowd. A Penzance Clergyman, believed to be Rev. G.C. [...] "Bosun" [...] Smith, wrote [...] "The dangers of the coast between St. Michaels Mount and the Lizard are too well known to need description...Natural depravity and the customs of centuries have inspired the inhabitants of the coast with a rapacity for plundering those wrecks and the name of wreckers applies therefore to vast numbers who look for the season of booty". [...] In December 1862 the Truro schooner Arwenack, 92 tons register, with a cargo of Copper Ore from Devoran, bound for South Wales lost her masts in a storm in the Mounts Bay. The crew were believed to have abandoned her. The coastguard at Mullion Cove saw a small boat capsize outside the breakers, the boat and oars coming ashore with no one aboard. The Arwenack, drifting in the southerly gale went aground in a cliff bound cove between Gunwalloe Church Cove and Poldhu. Within an hour 50 men were found to be in the process of taking away the cargo. Most of the boat had been stripped and less than one ton of the Copper Ore remained. The crew of 5, 4 Cornishmen and a Prussian were all drowned. The movement against [...] "wrecking" [...] (unauthorised removal of goods from a shipwreck), began in the 1740s with condemnation of the practice by Methodist Preacher John Wesley.|$|E
40|$|This thesis aims {{to develop}} a {{workable}} concept for a timber transporter to ease up the work with managing the log transport to and from a sawmill in Nyland, this with only the power source of one person.  The thesis {{is based on a}} requirement specification that was defined in collaboration with the client.                    The work began by analysing the scope and then a survey of commercial solutions was analysed, after that a creative process resulted in concept sketches. Different designs on the <b>timber</b> <b>carrier</b> were made and then by a selection one design concept was drawn up in a CAD software.  Through specific construction materials, certified by ISO 9001 standards, and analysis of specific load cases on the <b>timber</b> <b>carrier,</b> the strength was theoretically calculated and verified. These results were then compared with the results of a FE-analysis made by a FEM software. This method enables to investigate the critical points more closely by comparing the computer calculations with the manual calculations, which helps to form a deeper understanding of structural strength for the <b>timber</b> <b>carrier.</b> In this particular case, the results showed decent matching values.   This work resulted in a timber wagon on rails. It can handle the largest log the saw in Nyland probably can handle without any problems, i. e. a log with a diameter of 0. 7 meters and 6. 5 meters in length, with a weight of about 1. 3 tonnes. The timber transporter can withstand loads up to 15 tons over hundred thousand load cycles. The fatigue calculations show that the welds and the design have a very long lifespan...|$|E
30|$|To {{generate}} superclasses from vessel types, {{the first}} 50 major vessel types containing the largest amount of example images are selected and sorted {{according to their}} quantity. The vessel type with {{the largest number of}} images which is employed in our superclass generation, is general cargo, consisting of 324, 561 example images. The class with the smallest number of images is the <b>timber</b> <b>carrier,</b> accommodating only 1837 images. In this work, to investigate the visual similarities among vessel types, MatConvNet Toolbox [19] implementation of a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, VGG-F [20], is adopted. Features are extracted posterior to resizing images to 224 × 224. Utilizing the penultimate layer acctivations of VGG-F [20] as visual representations of images, each image is described by a 4096 -dimensional feature vector. Based on these feature vectors, we calculated a dissimilarity matrix for the 50 major vessel classes. To generate superclasses, 1 / 10 of all collected images belonging to 50 major classes are randomly selected (approximately 130, 000 images) and individual class statistics are estimated. Prior to calculating a dissimilarity matrix, we removed outliers following the preprocessing step explained below.|$|E
