5|$|In 1999, then-Emir (now King) Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa began {{a reform}} process and in 2001 exiles were told <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>come</b> back. Rejecting {{an offer to}} become a cabinet {{minister}} and leaving his leading position in the opposition, al-Jamri returned from the United Kingdom in December 2001, eight months after his father had obtained a consent from the Emir to establish two newspapers. Initially, he was sceptical about the king's reform plan, but al-Jamri received a personal invitation by the king and was given a large margin of freedom of expression. Al-Jamri, backed by 39 other private investors (US$5.3 million capital) had initially planned to establish two independent newspapers, Al-Wasat in Arabic and Gulf Observer in English.|$|E
5|$|Several {{other rooms}} {{neighbored}} the sanctuary. Many of these rooms {{were used to}} store ceremonial equipment, ritual texts, or temple valuables; others had specific ritual functions. The room where offerings {{were given to the}} deity was often separate from the sanctuary itself, and in temples without a barque in the sanctuary, there was a separate shrine to store the barque. In late temples the ritual areas could extend to chapels on the roof and crypts below the floor. Finally, in the exterior wall {{at the back of the}} temple, there were often niches for laymen to pray to the temple god, as close as <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>come</b> to its dwelling place.|$|E

5|$|Originally, the {{developers}} planned to only upgrade the graphics and tweak the gameplay. However, as development was {{getting closer to}} completion, Capcom started making more substantial changes in the game. For example, the inventory was expanded so that players could carry a standard item like Jill's lock picking, while defense items, which were initially {{not going to be}} separated from the main inventory, were introduced to make the game a bit easier than the original Resident Evil. The developers originally planned to make all enemies invisible but the idea was ultimately discarded because it would have made the remake very different from the original game. However, they designed the zombies so that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>come</b> back to life {{a certain amount of time}} after they are killed. The developers also added new areas for the player to explore, changed most of the puzzle designs, and included a new control scheme called Type C where players move their characters by pressing the R button of the GameCube controller and steer them with the analog stick. Another addition is the subplot involving the character Lisa Trevor, which was cut from the original game. Instead of using adjectives to describe difficulty levels, Mikami deliberately decided to have unique questions so that the player would pick the hard one.|$|E
25|$|Anaximander {{put forward}} {{the idea that}} humans had to spend part of this {{transition}} inside the mouths of big fish {{to protect themselves from}} the Earth's climate until <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>come</b> out in open air and lose their scales. He thought that, considering humans' extended infancy, we could not have survived in the primeval world in the same manner we do presently.|$|E
25|$|Walking {{for normal}} able bodied {{children}} is {{a lot different than}} walking for below-knee-amputees. Walking is less fluid and symmetrical for the children who are amputees. Research was conducted in order to find {{the best way to get}} the amputee children to develop a more symmetrical and fluid walking form like normal able bodied children. Because of the results of the study which showed that the normal bodied children can withstand a lot more external loading than the amputees, researchers are now looking into the manufacturing and design of the prosthetics that these amputees use. Potentially, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>come</b> up a new idea or a model that can improve the walking capabilities of these amputee children.|$|E

25|$|The {{influx of}} Chinese indentured {{immigrants}} aimed {{to replace the}} outlawed system of black slavery. It entailed signing a five-year contract that bound the labors physically to specific planters and their estates, and subjected them to physical and financial penalties whenever any contractural conditions were broken. The contracts consisted of a $4 wage for a 12-hour work day, also including food, clothing, medical care, and housing, although these contracts were regularly violated. Chinese immigrants could also arrive independent of the indentured system. These independent immigrants could come by paying their own way as an individual free migrant, or <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>come</b> sponsored and have their passage paid for reimbursement later. In 1917, the entire indentured immigration system was outlawed, largely due to pressure from Gandhi, who was then leading the nationalist movement in India.|$|E
25|$|Edward Shelley (who {{was one of}} {{the first}} English {{soldiers}} to be killed at the battle of Pinkie) reported that he had 40 thousand-weight of biscuit on 20 April. At Berwick, Shelley had problems getting enough coal or wood for baking and brewing. He had to ask permission to impress more supplies and hold sales to rotate his stock. 4000 border horsemen waited at Berwick for Hertford's signal. At first it was planned that they would make a diversionary attack on Haddington. Their commander Ralph Eure wrote from Alnwick on 28 April that these 'countrymen' were so poor he had to lend them money. He also asked for 1000 Yorkshire archers as reinforcement so that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>come</b> to Edinburgh to support the landing. In the event, it was agreed that Hertford would summon Eure when he had disembarked his troops. When Eure's men arrived in Edinburgh they would get their pay.|$|E
25|$|American Motors' major stockholder, Renault, {{was itself}} {{experiencing}} financial trouble in France. The investment in AMC (including {{construction of a}} new Canadian assembly plant in Brampton, Ontario) forced cuts at home, resulting in the closure of several French plants and mass layoffs. Renault was down to just three alternatives regarding its American holdings: (1) They could declare AMC officially bankrupt thereby lose its investment; (2) <b>They</b> <b>could</b> <b>come</b> up with more money, but Renault management perceived AMC as a bottomless pit; or (3) AMC could be put up for sale and the French could get back part of their investment. Against these detractions, Renault's chairman, Georges Besse, continued to champion the French firm's future in the North American market; pointing to the company's completion of the newest and most-advanced automotive assembly plant in North America, then known as Bramalea Assembly, as well as the recent introduction of the thoroughly modern, fuel-injected 4.0L and 2.5L engines. In addition, Jeep vehicles were riding an unprecedented surge in demand. It seemed to Besse and others that AMC was on course for profitability.|$|E

25|$|Ghazi sent an {{envoy to}} Éxarchos {{saying that he}} wanted to negotiate. The men met in Tripoli, Ghazi's capitol, but once Éxarchos arrived, Ghazi had him seized and hanged. When Éxarchos' mother heard the news she was infuriated. On Easter Sunday when {{everyone}} in Skoutari was at church she started calling the men women for not avenging her son's death. So the men of Skoutari under the command of Zanet dressed up as priests went to the Ottoman castle of Passavas, and asked the commander if <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>come</b> in and bless the castle. The commander agreed, and once all the men were inside, they took out their hidden weapons and slaughtered everyone inside the walls. None of the Ottomans made it out alive. After the massacre, Passavas was abandoned and never inhabited again. The Ottomans then tried to destroy Zanet in 1803 and 1807. The Ottomans tried to subdue Mani again in 1815 by capturing Skoutari but the men of Skoutari beat back the attack and in 1821 the rest of Greece declared their independence from the Ottomans.|$|E
25|$|In 1937 the Army, {{faced with}} the {{continuing}} supply problems with the Norden, once again turned to Sperry Gyroscope to see if <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>come</b> up with a solution. Their earlier models had all proved unreliable, but they had continued working with the designs throughout this period and had addressed many of the problems. By 1937, Orland Esval had introduced a new AC-powered electrical gyroscope that spun at 30,000 RPM, compared to the Norden's 7,200, which dramatically improved {{the performance of the}} inertial platform. The use of three-phase AC power and inductive pickup eliminated the carbon brushes, and further simplified the design. Carl Frische had developed a new system to automatically level the platform, eliminating the time-consuming process needed on the Norden. The two collaborated on a new design, adding a second gyro to handle heading changes, and named the result the Sperry S-1. Existing supplies of Nordens continued to be supplied to the USAAC's B-17s, while the S-1 equipped the B-24Es being sent to the 15th Air Force.|$|E
25|$|The wrong-way car chase on a Los Angeles freeway {{sequence}} {{was one of}} {{the last}} things shot in the film and it took six weeks to shoot. At this point, Friedkin was working with a very stripped down crew. He came up with the idea of staging the chase against the flow of traffic on February 25, 1963 when he was driving home from a wedding in Chicago. He fell asleep at the wheel and woke up in the wrong lane with oncoming traffic heading straight for him. He swerved back to his side of the road and for the next 20 years wondered how he was going to use it in a film. He told stunt coordinator Buddy Joe Hooker that if <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>come</b> up with a chase better than the one in The French Connection then it would be in the film. If not, he would not use it. Petersen did a lot of his own driving during this sequence and actor John Pankow's stressed out reactions were real. Three weekends were spent on sections of the Terminal Island Freeway near Wilmington, California that were closed for four hours at a time to allow the crew to stage the chaotic chase. With delays, the film ran a reported $1 million over budget.|$|E
50|$|All {{three members}} of the band are gay, but were told by Pete Waterman <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not <b>come</b> out as it would ruin their career.After disbanding, Creswick became a painter and decorator, and John {{returned}} to being a model booker and music manager.|$|R

500|$|They {{spent their}} final night in Nairobi at a YMCA, before they {{returned}} to London. The Beatles—according to McCartney—needed a new name, so on the flight back to England, Evans and McCartney played with words to see if <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>come</b> up with something new. Evans innocently asked McCartney what the letters [...] "S" [...] and [...] "P" [...] stood for on the pots on their meal trays, and McCartney explained that it was for salt and pepper, {{which led to the}} Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band name. They arrived back in London on 19 November 1966. Before the cover of Sgt. Pepper could be completed by Peter Blake, Evans and Aspinall were sent out to find photographs of all of the people that were to be shown on the front cover.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} {{developed}} in Los Angeles, where Gaga and her team were working on some other music before the singer became busy with her acting endeavor for A Star Is Born. Gaga utilized the free time from her schedule and asked Blair to meet up and see if <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>come</b> up with any new music. [...] "The Cure" [...] was released due to the positive nature and message in the track, although Gaga had already released Joanne, her fifth studio album, six months prior. According to Jocelyn Vena from Bravo, [...] "The Cure" [...] {{reminded her of the}} singer's dance-pop songs. Blair explained that the release happened after agreement between all the personnel involved: [...] "Joannes a great record... we weren't sitting there like, 'Oh, we need to make a song for the summertime and put it out this weekend'." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{people did}} confess to even a minor {{role in the}} rioting, such as {{throwing}} a few stones, they were charged with affray. One resident told the 1986 Gifford Inquiry into the rioting: [...] "You would go to bed and you would just lie there and you would think, {{are they going to}} come and kick my door, what's going to happen to my children?... It was that horrible fear that you lived with day by day, knowing <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>come</b> and kick down your door and hold you for hours." [...] The inquiry heard that 9,165 police officers were either deployed on the estate or held in reserve between 10 and 14 October 1985. Thus, argues Rose, the police created, or at least intensified, a climate of fear in which witnesses were afraid to step forward.|$|E
50|$|Gillian Armstrong {{had long}} wanted to film Peter Carey's novel but the rights were {{originally}} bought for John Schlesinger. However, {{after several years}} <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not <b>come</b> up with a script anyone was happy with; Schlesinger dropped out, Armstrong became involved and she brought in Laura Jones.|$|R

2500|$|In Vologda, Dmitry Konstantinovich {{took two}} rooms {{in a house}} owned by a local merchant, just {{opposite}} the river.

Shortly after they arrival, they learned that Grand Dukes Nicholas and Georgy Mikhailovich had also been exiled to the town. The prisoners enjoyed relative freedom; aside from having to report to Cheka Headquarters once a week, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>come</b> and go as they wished, and took long walks around the town, visiting and dining with each other frequently. In the middle of May, Colonel Alexander von Leiming, one of Dmitry Konstantinovich’s adjutants, arrived in Vologda with news that passage had been prepared to Finland, but the grand duke refused to leave Russia ...|$|E
2500|$|George Washington marched {{his army}} to Bedford in 1794 to subdue the Whiskey Rebellion. There {{was much more}} at stake than quieting the {{uprising}} of rebels angered by a tax on whiskey; Washington felt the Constitution itself was at risk. The rebellion mainly consisted of farmers who could, due to {{the high cost of}} pack mule transport to the eastern cities, earn more selling whiskey instead of grain. The rebellion spread fast, and when it reached Pittsburgh some rebels threatened to burn the city to the ground. Anarchy was on its way; the British and French watched every move hoping <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>come</b> back and take over. Washington knew he had to act and make a statement; the laws of America would be obeyed. 12,950 militiamen were called to Bedford leaving the rebels without many choices. One historian later stated, [...] "It was at Bedford that the new federal government was finally to establish itself as sovereign in its own time and place." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{continued}} to hound Drew after being elected. In {{the fall of}} 1948, Drew become {{the leader of the}} federal Progressive Conservatives. He needed a seat in the federal parliament and contested a by-election in the Ottawa-area electoral district of Carleton in order to win a seat in the House of Commons. [...] The federal Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) was determined to defeat him, so they ran Eugene Forsey as their candidate. [...] Temple was brought up from Toronto to appear at a political meeting in Richmond, Ontario's Town Hall, where Forsey and Drew were speaking. He accused the Tory leader of being [...] "a tool of the liquor interests" [...] and also made suggestions about Drew's sobriety. [...] Throughout the evening Drew grew more red-faced and explosive, every time Temple spoke. Finally, after Drew misheard Temple calling him dishonest, the two men were restrained before <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>come</b> to physical blows with each other. [...] A riot was barely averted, and the meeting had to be terminated. However, on 20 December 1948 Drew soundly defeated Forsey, and went on to sit in Parliament.|$|E

60|$|Here, at first, {{they found}} the shore steep too, and a great depth of water close to land, which made them very uneasy; for, if the least gale of wind had {{disturbed}} the water, especially blowing from off the lake, {{they would have been}} shipwrecked close to the shore. However, after they had gone for two days along the side, by the help of towing and setting as well as <b>they</b> <b>could,</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> to a flatter shore and a fair strand, to their great joy and satisfaction.|$|R
