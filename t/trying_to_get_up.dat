5|$|Before all the {{steerage}} passengers {{had even}} {{a chance of}} their lives, the Titanics sailors fastened the doors and companionways leading up from the third-class section... A crowd of men was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> to a higher deck and were fighting the sailors; all striking and scuffling and swearing. Women and some children were there praying and crying. Then the sailors fastened down the hatchways leading to the third-class section. They {{said they wanted to}} keep the air down there so the vessel could stay up longer. It meant all hope was gone for those still down there.|$|E

25|$|USS Saginaw 's {{crew was}} just putting the anchor {{down when the}} first shot burst in the water next to the ship. Surprised, the Americans first raised a white flag to show their {{friendly}} intentions but then a second shot was fired along with a third. <b>Trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> steam, the Saginaw turned around and withdrew slowly to 900 yards, by which time her crew were at station and ready for action. The American gunners returned fire with one of their 32-pounders and after only about twenty minutes the Vietnamese guns were silenced. A secondary explosion was observed and it was suspected that either the powder magazine of the fort, {{or one of the}} guns, blew up and killed their operators. After the explosion no further shots were fired from the fort. However, the Saginaw 's gunners continued their bombardment for another half-hour unopposed until the fort was in ruins. American forces suffered no damage or casualties and after the action, communicating with the natives proved fruitless so the Saginaw steamed back to Hong Kong.|$|E

500|$|Recorded at Westlake Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California by Josh Mosser, [...] "Circles" [...] {{was written}} by Christina Aguilera, Candice Pillay, Alexander Grant and Dwayne Abernathy, and it was {{produced}} by Alex da Kid. Aguilera's vocals were recorded by Oscar Ramirez at The Red Lips Room in Beverly Hills, California, while Aguilera and Pillay conducted the vocal production. Pillay also contributed additional vocals on the track, and J Browz added additional guitar. [...] "Circles" [...] is an alternative rock song, and runs for a duration of [...] (three minutes and twenty-five seconds). The lyrics of the [...] "rawky" [...] chorus, [...] "spin around in circles on my middle middle finger", has been likened to a [...] "'90s riot-grrrl". Andrew Hampp for Billboard thought as though it sounded like [...] "mini-Aguilera's" [...] were chanting the words [...] "round and round" [...] and [...] "motherfucker" [...] in childlike voices. [...] "Circles" [...] has a [...] "playground" [...] melodic structure, according to Robert Copsey of Digital Spy. He also thought the best lyrics in the song are [...] "Why you always <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> in my mixture?/ I think you're just bitter". At {{the end of the}} song, Aguilera speaks out loud the word [...] "motherfucker!".|$|E
2500|$|On 22 March 2003, RMS Mülheim was on {{a voyage}} from Cork, Republic of Ireland to Lübeck, Germany, {{transporting}} 2,200 tonnes of scrap car plastic. The ship ran aground at approximately 0500 GMT in Gamper Bay, between Land's End and Sennen Cove, during which time there was [...] "moderate visibility and fog patches". On investigation, {{it was discovered that}} the chief officer—who had been on watch at the time—had caught his trousers in the lever of his chair when <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up,</b> causing him to fall and rendering him unconscious. [...] By the time he regained consciousness, RMS Mülheim [...] was already bearing down on the shoreline. Although the Sennen Lifeboat and Land's End Coastguard Cliff Team were able to reach the wreck quickly, the six-man Polish crew of the vessel were airlifted to safety by a search and rescue helicopter from RNAS Culdrose. The members of the crew were treated for shock at the Sennen Cove Lifeboat Station.|$|E
2500|$|Wong {{descended from}} the rooftop to the street, where he got {{into his car and}} drove quickly toward the ruined railway station. When he arrived, he noted carnage and confusion: [...] "It was a horrible sight. People were still <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up.</b> Dead and injured lay strewn across the tracks and platform. Limbs lay all over the place. Only my work helped me forget what I was seeing. I stopped to reload my camera. I noticed that my shoes were soaked with blood. I walked across the railway tracks, and made many long scenes with the burning {{overhead}} bridge in the background. Then I saw a man pick up a baby from the tracks and carry him to the platform. He went back to get another badly injured child. The mother lay dead on the tracks. As I filmed this tragedy, I heard the sound of planes returning. Quickly, I shot my remaining few feet [...] on the baby. I ran toward the child, intending to carry him to safety, but the father returned. The bombers passed overhead. No bombs were dropped." ...|$|E
