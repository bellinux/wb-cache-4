5|$|The {{soldiers}} and police worked {{to keep the}} mob at bay, and drove them <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>end</b> of the station near Lee Street. There they assailed the buildings of the depot with stones. At 10:30pm the rioters set fire to passenger cars, the dispatcher's office, and the roundhouse. Some firefighters dispatched to the scene were driven off, and others had their hoses cut when they attempted to set up their pumps, but, {{under the protection of}} the police and soldiers, the flames were extinguished. The Sun reported the fires damaged one passenger car and engine, destroyed the dispatcher's office, and damaged the roof of the depot's shed. Two subsequent fires were started in the south of the city, but were dealt with without major damage.|$|E
5|$|On July 8, 1758, James Abercromby {{attacked}} Fort Carillon on Lake Champlain, but was repelled {{with heavy}} losses. In August, Montgomery and the 17th foot sailed to Boston, marched {{to join with}} Abercromby's forces in Albany and then moved to Lake George. On November 9, Abercromby was recalled; Amherst replaced him as commander-in-chief. The British high command, for the 1759 campaign, developed {{a plan for a}} three-pronged attack into Canada, in which forces including the 17th foot would assault Fort Carillon and also capture Fort St. Frédéric, near Crown Point, New York. Under Amherst's command, Montgomery and the 17th Foot participated in the capture of Fort Carillon. While the army was gathering prior to the battle, Montgomery's company was on guard duty; he ordered his men to remain vigilant for French and Indian ambush parties. On May 9 his suspicions proved correct when 12 men from the 17th were attacked. Montgomery and the 17th met stiff resistance at first. Montgomery ordered that his men were not to fire at night, fearing they would shoot their comrades. On July 21, the army began its movement toward Fort Carillon; by the 26th they were in position outside the fort's walls, from which the French had already withdrawn most of their forces to Fort St. Frédéric. That night, after some exchange of cannon fire during the day, the French blew up Carillon's powder magazine, and Fort St. Frédéric the next day, and withdrew <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>end</b> of Lake Champlain.|$|E

25|$|To {{sum up the}} defense: {{the defender}} should keep his king {{in front of the}} {{opposing}} pawn and keep his rook on the third rank until the pawn advances to that rank, then go <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>end</b> of the board (the seventh or eighth rank) and check the king from behind. If the attacker tries to get his king to his sixth rank by moving his rook to that rank first to block the checks, the defender simply exchanges rooks and has a drawn king and pawn versus king endgame.|$|E
25|$|Away {{fans for}} league matches were {{originally}} accommodated {{in the upper}} level, in the north west corner, which can hold a maximum of 3,000 fans. However, plans were made {{at the end of}} the 2007–2008 season to relocate the away supporters <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>end</b> of the upper level of the Leazes End. This location has attracted criticism due to the poor view offered by being so far from the pitch due the height of the stand, and the 14 flights of stairs to reach the upper level.

Tucker residents continued the tradition of expansion by maintaining and improving theses resources throughout the 1960s, 70s, and 80s.

Well aware of the surrounding dangers, Louis discussed the situation with his advisors. At about six o'clock in the evening, the king made a belated effort to quell {{the rising tide of}} insurrection: he announced that he would accept the August decrees and the Declaration of the Rights of Man without qualification. Adequate preparations to defend the palace were not made, however: the bulk of the royal guards, who had been deployed under arms in the main square for several hours facing a hostile crowd, was withdrawn <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>end</b> of the park of Versailles.

These lines of evidence strongly suggest that the April 16 mainshock was an example of the representative event anticipated for the Futagawa segment. On the other hand, the surface ruptures on the Takano-Shirahata segment of the Hinagu fault zone were only about 6  km long and were limited to its northernmost part. Understanding the implications of the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake sequence on the long-term behavior of the Takano-Shirahata segment will require further tectonic, geomorphic, and paleoseismic investigations.|$|R
