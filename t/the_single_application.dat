40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} the long-term outcomes of two-step versus single application of mitomycin-C (MMC) during photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) for high myopia. Methods: This randomized clinical trial included consecutive patients with high myopia (exceeding 7 D). Patients underwent PRK and were randomized to two methods of MMC 0. 02 % application as follows: in <b>the</b> <b>single</b> <b>application</b> group, MMC {{was applied for}} 45 seconds followed by irrigation; in the two-step group MMC was used identically followed by repeat application for another 15 seconds and corneal surface irrigation. Visual acuity, refractive error, pachymetry, topography, corneal haze and complications were compared {{between the two groups}} 18 months after surgery. Results: One hundred and forty patients (70 subjects in either study arm) underwent PRK according to the study protocol. Mean spherical equivalent refractive error was significantly reduced from baseline to - 1. 16 ΁ 0. 39 D in <b>the</b> <b>single</b> <b>application</b> group and to - 1. 07 ΁ 0. 39 D in the two-step group. Sixteen (11. 5 %) versus 8 (5. 7 %) eyes lost one or more line(s) of best corrected visual acuity in <b>the</b> <b>single</b> <b>application</b> group as compared to the two-step group (P= 0. 05).

This study was undertaken to investigate any changes which may occur to a soil environment after the application of fire fighting foam. A pilot study was carried out at RAF Manston in Kent to {{examine the effect of}} a spill of a protein foam on to uncontaminated soil. Three sites were analysed over the course of one year from the date of the spill. One site had received multiple applications of foam, the second had received a single application and the third was untouched by the spill and was used as the control site. Soil samples were taken from each site and biological and chemical analyses carried out. In the biological investigation, soil organisms were extracted, identified and counted. In the chemical investigation ionic fluoride, available and total metal concentrations, percentage total nitrogen and soil pH were analysed. More organisms were counted throughout the year on the multiple application site than on the other two sites. <b>The</b> <b>single</b> <b>application</b> site and the control had similar results, although the year after the spill, the control site showed a larger numbers of organisms than <b>the</b> <b>single</b> <b>application</b> site.

The soils had similar physical properties, but different soil P status (ammonium lactate-extractable P; P-AL) and degree of P saturation (DPS-AL).

The columns were irrigated in the laboratory five times before and five times after a <b>single</b> <b>application</b> of pig slurry (22 kg P ha- 1). Concentrations of dissolved reactive P (DRP), dissolved organic P and total-P (TP) in leachate and loads were significantly higher (p MinMellby (0. 41 - 0. 49 mg L- 1) > LowSlurryMellby (0. 31 - 0. 36 mg L- 1) > MinBöslid (0. 14 - 0. 15 mg L- 1), {{both before and after}} <b>the</b> <b>single</b> slurry <b>application.</b> DRP concentrations in leachate were positively correlated with DPS-AL values in the topsoil (R 2 = 0. 95, p< 0. 0001), and increased with greater DPS-AL values after <b>the</b> <b>single</b> slurry <b>application</b> (R 2 = 0. 79, p< 0. 0001).

Scalping of the turf was combined with various nitrogen and aerification treatments performed initially on May 22, 1997. Turfgrass aeration, either with or without extra nitrogen applications, when combined with an initial scalping operation, did not enhance bermudagrass transition by twenty-eight days after treatment (DAT), {{at the end of}} June 1997. Turfgrass color, quality and density were adversely affected from initial aerification treatments, especially when combined with initial scalping, The turf recovered best from multiple applications of nitrogen (applied at scalping and again at 7 DAT). Turfgrass density (visual estimates) showed that in conjunction with scalping, two applications of nitrogen, totaling 1. 5 lbs. /month, without aerification, provided a dense turf at 16 DAT, which was second only to the untreated control plot. At 27 DAT, scalping + N + N + aerification treated plots had the highest estimate of visual density, eventually showing a benefit from aerification.
