5|$|As a naturalistic writer, he was {{amongst the}} first English-language authors {{to absorb the}} lessons of the French realists, and was {{particularly}} influenced by the works of Émile Zola. His writings influenced James Joyce, according to the literary critic and biographer Richard Ellmann, and, although Moore's work is sometimes seen as outside the mainstream of both Irish and British literature, he is as often regarded as <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>great</b> modern Irish novelist.|$|E
5|$|During the 1730s and 1740s, the Presbyterian Church {{was divided}} over {{the impact of}} <b>the</b> <b>First</b> <b>Great</b> Awakening.

5|$|The {{significance}} of the events at Beaumont-Hamel {{on the first day}} of the Battle of the Somme was perhaps most strongly felt by the Dominion of Newfoundland, as it was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>great</b> conflict experienced by that dominion. Newfoundland was left with a sense of loss that marked an entire generation. The effects on the post-war generation were compounded by chronic financial problems caused both by Newfoundland's large debt from the war, and a prolonged post-war economic recession due to a decline in the fisheries.|$|E
5|$|With Harun al-Rashid's {{accession}} in 786, {{the raids}} launched {{over the next}} two years were relatively minor affairs; <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>great</b> invasion of the new reign occurred in 788, when a large expeditionary force crossed the Cilician Gates into the Anatolic Theme. Although the raid is not mentioned in Arabic sources, its description by the Byzantine chronicler Theophanes the Confessor points to a major invasion, as it was confronted by the forces of the two most powerful Byzantine thematic armies, those of the Anatolic Theme itself and of the Opsician Theme.|$|E
5|$|As {{kerosene}} {{and gasoline}} grew in importance, Rockefeller's wealth soared {{and he became}} the richest person in the country, controlling 90% of all oil in the United States at his peak.

Furthermore, Rockefeller gained enormous influence over the railroad industry, which transported his oil around the country. Standard Oil was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>great</b> business trust in the United States. Rockefeller revolutionized the petroleum industry, and along with other key contemporary industrialists such as steel magnate Andrew Carnegie, defined the structure of modern philanthropy.|$|E

5|$|Edmund Crouchback {{passed on}} the castle to his eldest son, Thomas, Earl of Lancaster, in 1298. Lancaster married Alice de Lacy, which made him the richest nobleman in England. Kenilworth became the primary castle of the Lancaster estates, {{replacing}} Bolingbroke, and acted as both a social and a financial centre for Thomas. Thomas built <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>great</b> hall at the castle from 1314 to 1317 and constructed the Water Tower along the outer bailey, as well as increasing {{the size of the}} chase. Lancaster, with support from many of the other English barons, found himself in increasing opposition to Edward II. War broke out in 1322, and Lancaster was captured at the Battle of Boroughbridge and executed. His estates, including Kenilworth, were confiscated by the crown. Edward and his wife, Isabella of France, spent Christmas 1323 at Kenilworth, amidst major celebrations.|$|E

5|$|Leicester possessed one of {{the largest}} {{collections}} of paintings in Elizabethan England, being <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>great</b> private collector. He was a principal patron of Nicholas Hilliard, as well as interested in all aspects of Italian culture. The Earl's circle of scholars and men of letters included, among others, his nephew Philip Sidney, the astrologer and Hermeticist John Dee, his secretaries Edward Dyer and Jean Hotman, as well as John Florio and Gabriel Harvey. Through Harvey, Edmund Spenser found employment at Leicester House on the Strand, the Earl's palatial town house, where he wrote his first works of poetry. Many years after Leicester's death Spenser wistfully recalled this time in his Prothalamion, and in 1591 he remembered the late Earl with his poem The Ruins of Time.|$|E

5|$|On Gates' advice, Rockefeller {{became one}} of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>great</b> benefactors of medical science. In 1901, he founded the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research in New York City. It {{changed its name to}} Rockefeller University in 1965, after {{expanding}} its mission to include graduate education. It claims a connection to 23 Nobel laureates. He founded the Rockefeller Sanitary Commission in 1909, an organization that eventually eradicated the hookworm disease, which had long plagued rural areas of the American South. His General Education Board made a dramatic impact by funding the recommendations of the Flexner Report of 1910. The study had been undertaken by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Yarmouk {{was a major}} {{battle between}} {{the army of the}} Byzantine Empire and the Muslim Arab forces of the Rashidun Caliphate. The battle {{consisted}} of a series of engagements that lasted for six days in August 636, near the Yarmouk River, along what today are the borders of Syria–Jordan and Syria–Israel, east of the Sea of Galilee. The result of the battle was a complete Muslim victory which ended Byzantine rule in Syria. The Battle of Yarmouk is {{regarded as one of the}} most decisive battles in military history, and it marked <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>great</b> wave of early Muslim conquests after the death of Prophet Muhammad, heralding the rapid advance of Islam into the then Christian Levant.|$|E
5|$|The Middle Colonies {{were the}} religiously diverse {{part of the}} British Empire, {{with a high degree}} of tolerance. The Penn family were Quakers, and the colony became a {{favorite}} destination for that group as well as German Lutherans, German Reformed and numerous small sects such as Mennonites, Amish and Moravians, not to mention Scotch Irish Presbyterians. The Dutch Reformed were strong in upstate New York and New Jersey, and Congregationalists were important in Long Island. <b>The</b> <b>First</b> <b>Great</b> Awakening invigorated religiosity and helped stimulate the growth of Congregational, Methodist and Baptist churches. Non-British colonists included Dutch Calvinist, Swedish Lutherans, Palatine Mennonites, and the Amish.|$|E
