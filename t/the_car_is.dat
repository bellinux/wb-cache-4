5|$|In September 2010, Citroën do Brasil {{launched}} the Citroën C3 Aircross in Brazil and Argentina. <b>The</b> <b>car</b> <b>is</b> a C3 Picasso-based mini Sport Utility Vehicle with styling differences including: raised suspension, chrome roof bars and mirror covers, side skirts, and a rear spare tyre.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{significant}} noise reduction typical of vehicles traveling in all-electric mode at low speeds, the Volt is {{fitted with a}} manually activated electronic warning sound system called Pedestrian-Friendly Alert System for use when <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>is</b> operating at low speeds to alert pedestrians to the car's presence.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>cars</b> <b>are</b> {{connected}} {{to one another}} by a mechanical type H tightlock knuckle coupler. All trainlined electrical connections between <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> <b>are</b> made through six trainline jumper cables. Air connections between <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> <b>are</b> made through two air hoses, brake pipe and main reservoir.|$|R
50|$|Before its {{production}} start, <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>was</b> in development for seven years. <b>The</b> <b>car</b> <b>was</b> designed by Canadian racing driver Antoine Bessette.|$|R
50|$|The {{friction}} between the upper driving pulley and the cable was insufficient to move <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> when <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> <b>were</b> unbalanced, i.e. <b>the</b> upper <b>car</b> <b>was</b> empty and <b>the</b> lower <b>car</b> <b>was</b> fully loaded. If the situation was reversed and <b>the</b> upper <b>car</b> <b>was</b> fully loaded, <b>the</b> cable slipped round the wheel so that the speed of <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> could not <b>be</b> controlled by braking the pulley.|$|R
5|$|In February 1970, {{the album}} was {{released}} by RCA Records. The cover art was completed by Dean Torrence, known for his teaming with Jan Berry to create {{the rock and roll}} duo Jan and Dean. Since Berry's near-fatal auto accident in 1966, Torrence had become a graphic artist; his sepia tone scene depicted Nilsson driving an old American car through the countryside with Newman in the back seat. <b>The</b> <b>car</b> <b>is</b> a 1938 Graham-Paige four-door sedan, rusty but working.|$|E
5|$|Maurer Söhne, a German {{roller coaster}} and steel manufacturer, has {{developed}} {{their own version of}} the Floorless Coaster called the X-Car Floorless. <b>The</b> <b>car</b> <b>is</b> the same as the original X-Car with the only difference being that there is no floor during the ride. As of 2012, no X-Car Floorless roller coasters have been manufactured.|$|E
5|$|The Leaf's {{electric}} warning sound had to {{be removed}} for cars delivered in the U.K., as the country's law mandates that any hazard warning sound must be capable of being disabled between 11:00 pm and 6:00 am, and the Leaf's audible warning system does not allow for such temporary deactivation. For the 2014 UK model of the car, the VSP system is enabled by default, though a button on the dash permits drivers to disable the system until the next time <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>is</b> switched on.|$|E

5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>is</b> {{disconnected}} {{from the rest of}} the train on a remote rail siding, Mulder questions the Red-Haired Man, who says that the patient is immune to biological warfare. Zama had tried to sneak the patient out of the country, but the government would rather see it destroyed than let their research fall into Japanese hands; the Red-Haired Man was sent to kill them both. Mulder, however, believes that the patient is an alien-human hybrid. With help from Scully, Mulder successfully unlocks the door of the railcar, but he is knocked unconscious by the Red-Haired Man. As the Red-Haired Man is about to leave, X appears and shoots him. Realizing that the bomb is about to explode and that there is not enough time to both save Mulder and secure the patient, X decides to save Mulder.

A screenshot of the video reveals a blurry figure who appears to be Howard Graves. The agents meet with Lauren at her home and after initially denying it, she admits to the incident but knows nothing about the murders. Upon leaving, the agents find their car going out of control on its own, leading it to crash into another car.

5|$|The REVA NXR {{exhibited}} in the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show and the Nissan Leaf SV trim both have roof-mounted solar panels. These solar panels are designed to trickle charge the batteries when <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>is</b> moving or parked. Another proposed technology is REVive, by Reva. When the REVA NXR's batteries are running low or are fully depleted, the driver is able to send an SMS to REVive and unlock a hidden reserve in the battery pack. Reva has not provided details on how the system will work. The Fisker Karma uses solar panel in the roof to recharge the 12-volt lead-acid accessory battery. The Nissan Leaf SL trim also has a small solar panel {{at the rear of}} the roof/spoiler that can trickle charge the auxiliary 12-volt lead-acid battery.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>car</b> <b>is</b> {{tracked down}} by a {{government}} gunship. Canaris arrives and reveals he will let the virus continue {{as a form of}} population control and profit.
