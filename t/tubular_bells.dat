5|$|The bells {{that draw}} the knights to the Grail {{ceremony}} at Monsalvat in acts 1 and 3 have often proved problematic to stage. For the earlier performances of Parsifal in Bayreuth, Wagner had the Parsifal bell, a piano frame with four strings, constructed {{as a substitute}} for church bells. For the first performances, the bells were combined with tam-tam and gongs. However, the bell was used with the tuba, four tam-tams tuned to the pitch of the four chime notes and another tam-tam on which a roll is executed by using a drumstick. In modern-day performances, the Parsifal bell has been replaced with <b>tubular</b> <b>bells</b> or synthesizers to produce the desired notes. The thunder machine is used in the moment of the destruction of Klingsor's castle.|$|E

The percussion consists of marimba, vibraphone, glockenspiel, crotales, <b>tubular</b> <b>bells,</b> cow bells, bass drum, tam-tam, sizzle cymbal, suspended cymbal, mark-tree, Chinese bell-tree and wind-machine.|$|E
5|$|In {{his early}} pieces for the Bouffes-Parisiens, {{the size of}} the {{orchestra}} pit had restricted Offenbach to an orchestra of 16 players. He composed for flute, oboe, clarinet, bassoon, two horns, piston, trombone, timpani and percussion and a small string section of seven players. After moving to the Salle Choiseul he had an orchestra of 30 players. The musicologist and Offenbach specialist Jean-Christophe Keck notes that when larger orchestras were available, either in bigger Paris theatres or in Vienna or elsewhere, Offenbach would compose, or rearrange existing music, accordingly. Surviving scores show his instrumentation for additional wind and brass, and even extra percussion. When they were available he wrote for cor anglais, harp, and, exceptionally, Keck records, an ophicleide (Le Papillon), <b>tubular</b> <b>bells</b> (Le carnaval des revues), and a wind machine (Le voyage dans la lune).|$|E

25|$|In late 1974, his {{follow-up}} LP, Hergest Ridge, was No.1 in the UK {{for three}} weeks before being dethroned by <b>Tubular</b> <b>Bells.</b> Although Hergest Ridge was released over a year after <b>Tubular</b> <b>Bells,</b> it reached No.1 first. <b>Tubular</b> <b>Bells</b> spent 11 weeks (10 of them consecutive) at No.2 before its one week at the top. Like <b>Tubular</b> <b>Bells,</b> Hergest Ridge is a two-movement instrumental piece, this time evoking scenes from Oldfield's Herefordshire country retreat. It was followed in 1975 by the pioneering world music piece Ommadawn released {{after the death of}} his mother Maureen.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the second}} section of the piece, the three {{performers}} in the rear gradually change their behavior {{at the sound of}} the <b>tubular</b> <b>bell</b> strike. They abandon their antique cymbals and glockenspiel for switches, which they whip in the air in all directions. The switches' whistling, hissing, and whipping cleans evil spirits from the air [...] When they hear two more strikes of the <b>tubular</b> <b>bell,</b> they approach Miron, while they continue to whip. They investigate Miron, occasionally whipping his body lightly. Slowly, they begin to circle Miron, hitting him more frequently, causing his bells to rattle. They work themselves into a frenzy, whipping Miron and dancing ecstatically as they circle him.|$|R
50|$|Nicotiana langsdorffii, Langsdorff's tobacco, is {{a species}} of the Nicotiana genus (tobacco). It is an annual plant with large leaves (up to 10 inches long) with tall 2 inch nodding long <b>tubular</b> <b>bell</b> shaped flowers that are apple green in colour, with blue anthers. N. langsdorfii lacks {{fragrance}} unlike {{some of the other}} tall species. It is grown as an ornamental garden plant.|$|R
50|$|In {{the first}} section, the {{performers}} play their {{instruments in the}} same doll-like manner. The three performers at the rear play the antique cymbals and glockenspiel rapidly, blurring together high overtones. The marimba attendants play independently of everyone, seeming {{to be in their}} own separate world. The klangplatten performer plays independently as well, but he eventually strikes a <b>tubular</b> <b>bell.</b>|$|R
25|$|What is now {{considered}} the Theme from The Exorcist, <b>Tubular</b> <b>Bells</b> by Mike Oldfield, became very popular after the film's release. Oldfield himself {{said he was not}} impressed with how his work was used in the film.|$|E

Taylor joined Oldfield once more for a BBC television broadcast in November 1973.|$|E
5000|$|The Stephen Foster Memorial Carillon, the park's 97-tubular bell {{carillon}} tower, {{was built}} in 1957 by the J.C. Deagan Company. Over four decades, the company built and installed in excess of 500 carillons worldwide based, on their own 1916 design. The setup at White Springs was their largest and last carillon. It is noted as the [...] "world's largest <b>tubular</b> <b>bell</b> instrument" [...] from the company.|$|R
50|$|Working in the lush, lyrical idiom {{reminiscent}} of fin de siècle Vienna, Korngold scored the concerto for elaborate instrumental forces. In {{addition to the}} solo violin, the concerto calls for two flutes (one doubling piccolo), two oboes (one doubling cor anglais), two clarinets, bass clarinet, two bassoons (one doubling double bassoon), four horns, two trumpets, trombone, harp, strings, {{as well as a}} colorful percussion section of timpani, bass drum, cymbals, gong, <b>tubular</b> <b>bell,</b> glockenspiel, vibraphone, xylophone, and celesta.|$|R
5000|$|De profundis {{is in one}} movement, set for a male choir in four parts, {{organ and}} percussion. The {{optional}} percussion might be bass drum, tam-tam and a single <b>tubular</b> <b>bell.</b> [...] The organ provides in deep registers a slow continuous ostinato pattern. Pärt built the voices from simple melodic phrases, increasing gradually to a climax. They begin in low register, rising and reaching a passage of unison of the four parts, before returning to silence, marked by a final sound of a bell.|$|R
