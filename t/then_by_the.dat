After Justinian I fought an almost continual war for forty years to recover the old Roman Empire, he seized Dalmatia, and Klis was from 537, a part of Byzantine Empire. The name of Klis (Kleisa or Kleisoura) was first described in chapter 29 of Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus' De Administrando Imperio. While describing the Roman settlement of Salona, Constantine VII speaks of the stronghold, which may have been designed or improved, to prevent attacks on the coastal cities and roads by Slavs.|$|E

5|$|The Fox terrier and Jack Russell terrier type dogs {{of today}} are all descended from dogs of that period, {{although}} documented pedigrees earlier than 1862 {{have not been}} found, although several records remain of documented breeding by John Russell between the 1860s and 1880s.

5|$|The artist's {{reputation}} {{was such that}} {{he had already been}} called to Rome a number of times in the early 1540s; first by Cardinal Pietro Bembo and <b>then</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Farnese family. By the mid-1540s Titian was the preferred portraitist for the Farnese. Following a number of earlier portraits of Pier Luigi and Paul, they commissioned a set to mark their ascendancy after Paul's papacy, all of which were– given their political awareness and ambition– clearly intended as public statements on their social elevation. Paul was aware of Titian's influence in Venice, and after 1538 allowed only Titian to portray him.|$|E

5|$|The concerto is {{innovative}} in many respects. In {{the first}} movement alone, Mendelssohn departs from the typical {{form of a}} Classical concerto in many ways, the most immediate being the entry of the soloist almost from the outset, which also occurs in his First Piano Concerto. Although the first movement is mostly in the conventional sonata form, Mendelssohn has the first theme played by the solo violin and <b>then</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> orchestra. Classical concertos typically opened with an orchestral introduction followed by a version of essentially the same material that incorporates the soloist.|$|E

5|$|The four hymns Bach {{inserted}} in the Magnificat for the Christmas vespers had a tradition in Leipzig. A setting by Bach's predecessor Kuhnau in a Christmas cantata is extant. They can be connected to scenic display of the Christmas story, representing the annunciation to the shepherds, first by one angel (A, B), <b>then</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> multitude (C), finally a cradle song (Kindleinwiegen, D). In Bach's autograph, the four movements are grouped {{at the back of}} the volume. They are written in older musical styles than most of the Magnificat movements.|$|E
