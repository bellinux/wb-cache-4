50|$|There {{seems to}} be no creditable {{information}} about Carver's childhood, as the contradictions in stories he told classify them as entertainment rather than fact. For most of his adult life Carver gave the year of his birth as 1840, but it is likely he did so in order <b>to</b> <b>enlarge</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> frame needed to create stories of frontier experience for his admiring audiences after he became a showman. Carver's biographer, Raymond Thorp, wrote that Carver left home at a young age to assert his family's right to land in Minnesota that the Sioux had supposedly granted his grandfather, Jonathan Carver, and that during this period of time he lived with the Santee Sioux. This contention, however, like other claims made by Carver about his early life and never investigated by his biographer, does not withstand the scrutiny of reputable historians.|$|E
40|$|Ground {{deformations}} {{in active}} volcanoes are considered precursors of eruptions {{according to the}} most tested models; therefore monitoring networks of ground deformations are installed on inhabited dangerous volcanoes. Direct measurements of such deformations are carried out since 1861 when Luigi Palmieri monitored the eruption at Mt. Vesuvius with levelings along the shoreline near the town of Torre del Greco. Relative sea level changes were measured at Serapeo in Pozzuoli in the middle of 19 th century to record soil uplifts which are locally known as bradyseism. <b>To</b> <b>enlarge</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> series of data on these phenomena it is necessary to utilize historical and prehistorical informations on the location of shore-line of human settlements. As regards the regions of active volcanoes as the Neapolitan one three processes contribute to sea level changes as eustatism, regional tectonics and local intrusive and effusive phenomena. Therefore {{at the same time the}} relative sea level should be different at far-away places only few kilometres according to the volcanic activity. In fact eustatic and tectonic processes contribute to sea level changes with very lesser rates than volcanic activity. The Neapolitan region for its geological history is an excellent laboratory for testing the validation of new paradigms for some natural phenomena...|$|E

We carried out new {{photometric}} observations of Apollo in April 2007 <b>to</b> <b>enlarge</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> line and to derive a more precise shape and spin state model. We also observed another YORP-candidate, asteroid (25143) Itokawa, in December 2006 and January 2007 to obtain a longer time line. An estimation of the YORP strength on Itokawa based on its precise shape model from the Hayabusa mission predicted the deceleration to be already observable during the 2007 apparition. Methods. We used the lightcurve inversion method to model the shape and spin state of Apollo. For Itokawa, the shape and pole direction are known to a high degree of accuracy from the Hayabusa mission, so we used a modified version of lightcurve inversion with only two free parameters - the rotation period and its linear change in time. Results. The new model of Apollo confirms earlier results. The observed acceleration of Apollo's rotation rate is, which is in agreement with the theoretically predicted value. For Itokawa, the theoretical YORP value is sensitive to the resolution of the shape model and lies in the range from to. This is inconsistent with results of lightcurve inversion that place an upper limit to the change of Itokawa's rotation rate.. Â© 2008 ESO...|$|E

Because teachers {{do not have the}} skills to bring oral language education to practise, the Combilist training was developed, to learn conversation and interaction skills in the classroom. In this study we want to investigate the effect of the Combilist training on teacher skills to bring oral language education in practice, focusing on questioning of the teachers and speaking time of teachers and children. In a pre-posttest study, twenty-four participants from four different schools were tested on total number of questions, number of closed questions, number of open questions, number of what-action-question (wav), speaking time of teachers and speaking time of children. These results show that the Combilist training is a good tool to narrow down the total number of questions and <b>to</b> <b>enlarge</b> <b>the</b> speaking <b>time</b> of children in the classroom, thereby creating opportunities for children to develop their language skills...|$|R
40|$|The {{numerical}} simulation of blade cutting of thin layered shell is a challenging task, involving complex phenomena, such as large deformations, nonlinear material behaviour, contact, crack propagation, delamination. In particular, three small geometrical scales need be resolved: {{the scale of}} layer thicknesses, the scale of blade radius of curvature, the scale of fracture and delamination process zones. In view of the problem nonlinearity, an explicit dynamics formulation with solid-shell elements is adopted to avoid convergence problems. A selective mass scaling approach [1, 2] is used <b>to</b> <b>enlarge</b> <b>the</b> critical <b>time</b> step size, dictated by the layers thickness. Crack propagation is modelled by inserting cohesive interfaces between adjacent elements placed along the prescribed blade trajectory. The problem {{of the interaction between}} the sharp blade and the cohesive process zone is addressed by using the so called “directional cohesive elements” proposed in [3]. Depending on the type of material and on the layer thickness, the problem may be characterized by very small process zone sizes. Techniques for the reduction of spurious oscillations in the presence of coarse discretization and for the improvement of overall accuracy are investigated. Numerical applications to engineering problems are used to assess the effectiveness of the proposed simulation approach...|$|R
40|$|In {{conventional}} phase-resolved OCT {{blood flow}} is detected from phase changes between successive A-scans. Especially in high-speed OCT systems {{this results in}} a short evaluation time interval. This method is therefore often unable to visualize complete vascular networks since low flow velocities cause insufficient phase changes. This problem was solved by comparing B-scans instead of successive A-scans <b>to</b> <b>enlarge</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> interval. In this paper a detailed phase-noise analysis of our OCT system is presented in order to calculate the optimal time intervals for visualization of the vasculature of the human retina and choroid. High-resolution images of the vasculature of a healthy volunteer taken with various time intervals are presented to confirm this analysis. The imaging was performed with a backstitched B-scan in which pairs of small repeated B-scans are stitched together to independently control the time interval and the imaged lateral field size. A time interval of ≥ 2. 5 ms was found effective to image the retinal vasculature down to the capillary level. The higher flow velocities of the choroid allowed a time interval of 0. 64 ms to reveal its dense vasculature. Finally we analyzed depth-resolved histograms of volumetric phase-difference data to assess changes in amount of blood flow with depth. This analysis indicated different flow regimes in the retina and the choroid. © 2012 Optical Society of America...|$|E
40|$|The {{comparison}} of Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) {{is a powerful}} tool for Earth surface deformation studies in landslide area. The use of DEMs allows in many cases a full description of the process, while the classical geodetic ground-based measurements give a sampling of deformation field at a limited number of points. Digital Elevation Models can be obtained by means of several techniques like digital photogrammetry, laser scanning and GPS methodology with its different measurement approaches. These techniques were applied on the Rocca Pitigliana landslide located in the Emilia-Romagna Region (Northern Italy). GPS kinematic surveys were performed to obtain DEMs at low costs, short execution time and high accuracy (decimetre level). The digital photogrammetry allowed <b>to</b> <b>enlarge</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> and the spatial domain of investigation, providing also historical images with precision strictly depending on the scale of the images, ranging, in this work, from few centimetres to sub-meter level. The terrestrial laser scanning, in many cases, assured the description of restricted zones with very high spatial accuracy (few centimetres). DEMs internal precision is strictly related to the selected surveying method, to the operative working conditions and to the morphological features of the studied area. The requirements for GPS kinematic surveying are the satellite visibility and the capability of walking along the landslide; aerial photogrammetry can model with high accuracy only surfaces without vegetation and shadowing effects; the terrestrial laser scanning requires good weather conditions. The results of measurements performed on the Rocca Pitigliana landslide, in the last two years, and the comparisons among the different observation techniques are describe...|$|E

We performed a kinematic analysis of the most accurate proper motions derived in this work, which allowed us to separate cluster members from field stars and to derive the mean properties of the cluster. From the kinematic analysis we derived a list of 68 members and 14 candidate members, comprising 26 new objects with a high membership probability. These new members are generally fainter than the known ones. We measured a mean proper motion of (mu_RA*, mu_DEC) =(- 8. 2, - 24. 3) +/- 0. 8 mas/yr for the L 1688 dark cloud.

50|$|Tarlov cysts {{are known}} to have <b>the</b> {{tendency}} <b>to</b> <b>enlarge</b> over <b>time.</b> <b>The</b> prominent theory that explains this phenomenon reasons the enlargement of the cysts is due to the cerebrospinal fluid being pushed into the cyst during systole pulsation, but unable to get out during the diastole phase, resulting in enlargement observed in clinical settings over time. Increased ICP from trauma or other injury, childbirth, and overextertion are thought to trigger enlargement along with inflammation and hemorrhagic infiltration. With the cysts often containing a valve like mechanism fluid becomes trapped, and the meningeal sac or nerve sheath grows in size. Some patients have been diagnosed for up to 20 years with little change in size, and those with small stable cysts may avoid much progression of symptoms.

The spots were observed <b>to</b> <b>enlarge</b> with <b>time.</b> <b>The</b> rate of enlargement of fluorescent spots was greater when fragments were applied than when divalent antibody was used.

The observations are consistent with the spread of fluorescent spots due to diffusion of surface protein antigens within the plane of a fluid membrane. From measurements of spot size against time, a diffusion constant of 1 - 3 X 10 - 9 cm 2 s I can be calculated for muscle plasma membrane proteins of mol wt approximately 200, 000. This value is consistent with other observations on the diffusion of surface antigens and of labeled lipid molecules in synthetic and natural membranes.
