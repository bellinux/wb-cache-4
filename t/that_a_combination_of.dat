5|$|In July 2013, {{scientists}} from the University of Maryland and the US Department of Agriculture found <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> pesticides has been contaminating the pollen bees use to feed their hives. When researchers collected pollen from hives on the east coast, they discovered that it was contaminated (on average) with 9 different fungicides and pesticides, although scientists found a blend of 21 different agricultural chemicals in one sample of pollen. Eight ag chemicals were identified {{to be associated with}} increased risk of infection by Nosema ceranae.|$|E
5|$|The FEFAP field surveys, {{excavations}} and exhumations spanned {{more than}} 10years. The {{results of this}} study from King William Island and Beechey Island artefacts and human remains showed that the Beechey Island crew had most likely died of pneumonia and perhaps tuberculosis, which was suggested by the evidence of Pott's disease discovered in Braine. Toxicological reports pointed to lead poisoning as a likely contributing factor. Blade cut marks found on bones from some of the crew were seen as signs of cannibalism. Evidence suggested <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> cold, starvation and disease including scurvy, pneumonia and tuberculosis, all made worse by lead poisoning, killed everyone in the Franklin party.|$|E
5|$|U-66 {{began her}} seventh {{and what was}} to be her final patrol on the morning of 2 September when she {{departed}} from Emden destined for operations in the North Channel. Shortly after noon on 3 September, U-66 reported a position in the North Sea that placed her beyond known British minefields, in what was her last known contact. A postwar German study offered no explanation for U-66s loss. British records suggest that U-66 may have either struck a mine in an older minefield in the Dogger Bank area, or <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> destroyers, submarines, and anti-submarine net tenders sank U-66 sometime between 1 and 11 October. Author Dwight Messimer discounts this latter theory as not being supported by operational details.|$|E

5|$|Anton is a {{special-purpose}} supercomputer {{built for}} molecular dynamics simulations. In October 2011, Anton and Folding@home {{were the two}} most powerful molecular dynamics systems. Anton is unique {{in its ability to}} produce single ultra-long computationally costly molecular trajectories, such as one in 2010 which reached the millisecond range. These long trajectories may be especially helpful for some types of biochemical problems. However, Anton does not use Markov state models for analysis. In 2011, the Pande lab constructed a MSM from two 100-µs Anton simulations and found alternative folding pathways that were not visible through Anton's traditional analysis. They concluded that there was little difference between MSMs constructed from a limited number of long trajectories or one assembled from many shorter trajectories. In June 2011 Folding@home began added sampling of an Anton simulation in an effort to better determine how its methods compare to Anton's. However, unlike Folding@home's shorter trajectories, which are more amenable to distributed computing and other parallelizing methods, longer trajectories do not require adaptive sampling to sufficiently sample the protein's phase space. Due to this, it is possible <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> Anton's and Folding@home's simulation methods would provide a more thorough sampling of this space.|$|E

DCS is an old antibiotic medication used for treating tuberculosis and does not have any anxiolytic properties per se.

It is uncertain where it was first discovered <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> hydrated non-hydraulic lime and a pozzolan produces a hydraulic mixture (see also: Pozzolanic reaction), but concrete made from such mixtures was used by the Ancient Macedonians and three centuries later on a large scale by Roman engineers.|$|E
25|$|Evidence shows <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> {{comprehensive}} {{sex education}} {{and access to}} birth control appears to decrease the rates of unintended pregnancies among teenagers.

Numerous studies show that curricula providing accurate information about condoms and contraception can lead to reductions in the risky behaviors reported by young people as well as reductions in unintended pregnancies and STIs. Programs that teach only abstinence have not been shown to be effective.|$|E
25|$|While Martin's {{record as}} finance {{minister}} was lauded {{in business and}} financial circles, there were undeniable costs. Some of these costs {{took the form of}} reduced government services, affecting the operations and achievement of the mandate of federal and provincial departments. This was probably most noticeable in health care, as major reductions in federal funding to the provinces meant significant cuts in service delivery. Martin's tactics, including those of using contributor's funds from RCMP, Military and Civil Service pension plans and Employment Insurance, created further controversy. CAW economist Jim Stanford said <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> a spending freeze at 1994 levels and lower interest rates would have eliminated the deficit in two years through economic growth alone, without the reduction in services.|$|E

He estimated that 25–33% of healthcare services are provided to those in the last months or year of life and advocated restrictions in cases where quality of life cannot be improved. He also recommended that a budget be established for government healthcare expenses, through establishing spending caps and pay-as-you-go rules that require tax increases for any incremental spending.

25|$|Instructional design, the {{systematic}} design of materials, activities and interactive environments for learning, is broadly informed by educational psychology theories and research. For example, in defining learning goals or objectives, instructional designers often use a taxonomy of educational objectives created by Benjamin Bloom and colleagues. Bloom also researched mastery learning, an instructional strategy in which learners only advance {{to a new}} learning objective after they have mastered its prerequisite objectives. Bloom discovered <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> mastery learning with one-to-one tutoring is highly effective, producing learning outcomes far exceeding those normally achieved in classroom instruction. Gagné, another psychologist, had earlier developed an influential method of task analysis in which a terminal learning goal is expanded into a hierarchy of learning objectives connected by prerequisite relationships.|$|E
25|$|Weather {{conditions}} during 1350-1600 CE {{were better}} suited for maize growing on the upper Ohio Valley and West Virginia's tributary valleys. In the same time frame, the central and southwest Ohio (Till Plains) had cooler and wetter conditions, which affected the 'silking', pollination and grain filling stages that likely caused lower yields. Corn consumption decreased in the middle Ohio valley. The following weather pattern had intermittent droughts. This research also includes isotope analysis of samples from 47 archaeological sites in West and South Ohio, and western West Virginia (Staller, Tykot and Benz 2006:219,220). The scientists point out that samples from associated faunal remains would also be useful to obtain a clearer understanding.
