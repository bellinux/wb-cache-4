5|$|Between 24 and 25° degrees {{southern}} latitude the Andean Dry Diagonal crosses the Andes. At this latitude, {{half of the}} precipitation falls in summer {{and the other half}} in winter. The formation of this dry diagonal is an effect both of the rainshadow effect of the Andes, air subsidence within South Pacific High, and the cold Humboldt Current off the Pacific coast. This is <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> Atacama Desert exists. The extremely arid climate at Llullaillaco is also a consequence of these climatic effects.|$|E
5|$|A {{claim was}} made on 17 January 2006, by now former {{developer}} Hartmut Birr on the ReactOS developers mailing list (ros-dev) that ReactOS contained code derived from disassembling Microsoft Windows. The code that Birr disputed involved the function BadStack in syscall.S. {{as well as other}} unspecified items. Comparing this function to disassembled binaries from Windows XP, Birr argued that the BadStack function was simply copy-pasted from Windows XP, given that they were identical. Alex Ionescu, the author of the code, asserted that while the Windows XP binary in question was indeed disassembled and studied, the code was not merely copy-pasted, but reimplemented; <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> functions were identical, Ionescu claimed, was because there was only one possible way to implement the function.|$|E
5|$|During 14April 1912, Titanics radio {{operators}} received six {{messages from}} other ships warning of drifting ice, which passengers on Titanic {{had begun to}} notice during the afternoon.

Not all of these messages were relayed by the radio operators. At the time, all wireless operators on ocean liners were employees of the Marconi's Wireless Telegraph Company and not members of their ship's crew; their primary responsibility was to send messages for the passengers, with weather reports as a secondary concern.|$|E

The building site, however, had already been known as a bathing place called Pacethokan Spring since Sunan Amangkurat IV’s reign (1719–1726). According to Kitab Mamana in Yogyakarta Kraton, the project leader for the construction of Taman Sari was Tumenggung Mangundipura.

5|$|Triton's orbit upon capture {{would have}} been highly eccentric, and would have caused chaotic {{perturbations}} in the orbits of the original inner Neptunian satellites, causing them to collide and reduce to a disc of rubble. This means {{it is likely that}} Neptune's present inner satellites are not the original bodies that formed with Neptune. Only after Triton's orbit became circularised could some of the rubble re-accrete into the present-day regular moons.

5|$|A {{special feature}} of the limestone, {{resulting}} from its weathering by water, is its karstic nature. During the large Middle Pleistocene glaciations, surface runoff from glacial meltwaters would have fed directly into the river channel network {{because much of the}} upland limestone terrain was covered by ice, and many conduits in the karst would have been choked with sediment or permanently frozen. As a result, the glacier snouts came close to the modern valley bottoms. In contrast, during interglacial and interstadial periods, more effective coupling occurred between the surface drainage network and the internal karst drainage system. Since limestone dissolves as the water percolates through its pores, an extended underground drainage system has developed, with caves and channels that enlarge with time when their roofs collapse, producing rocky exposures and perpendicular slopes, which is also <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> water is scarce. Only when an impenetrable stratum is met, does water appear on the surface.|$|E

5|$|From the company's inception, Takahashi and Sugiura {{wanted to}} give {{creative}} freedom to pursue projects outside genre standards, in addition to hiring young staff. An early aim was to encourage younger developers to make their mark in the industry, {{which at the time}} was dominated by people in the late 30s and up. This outlook was <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> Xenosaga series was provided to a younger group of developers. Kojima stated that younger developers were preferred as they could bring interesting ideas to a project. According to Sugiura, a major element during the period in which Monolith Soft was under Namco was the focus on creativity. They wanted to balance this with the financial logistics of game design rather than having budgetary concerns stifle the creative flare of the staff. When talking about their Wii U projects in 2012, Monolith Soft staff member Michihiko Inaba stated that the company wanted to show that Japan could keep up with the Western market in terms of ambitious games that pushed forward the industry, comparing Monolith Soft to Bethesda Softworks in this desire.|$|E
5|$|Some psychologists {{believe that}} 'while object {{permanence}} alone may not predict communicative achievement, object permanence {{along with several}} other sensorimotor milestones, plays a critical role in, and interacts with, the communicative development of children with severe disabilities'. This was observed in 2006, in a study recognizing where the full mastery of object permanence {{is one of the}} milestones that ties into a child's ability to engage in mental representation. Along with the relationship with language acquisition, object permanence is also related to the achievement of self-recognition. This same study also focused specifically on the effects that Down syndrome has on object permanence. They found that <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> children that participated were so successful in acquiring object permanence, was due to their social strength in imitation. Along with imitation being a potential factor in the success, another factor that could impact children with Down syndrome could also be the willingness of the child to cooperate.|$|E

BEF president Mike Cherry explained that Chaka III did not qualify for the event until June 30, the final day, which is <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> horse was not considered for Bermuda's Olympic slot. The BEF organized a final day of competition between Nisbett's Antille and Terceira's Chaka to give Terceira one last opportunity to qualify for an Olympic position.

5|$|The Tales of Ise portrays Narihira as {{falling in}} love with , a consort of Emperor Seiwa, and it is hinted that {{this was one of the}} reasons for his leaving the capital and {{travelling}} east. It has been speculated that this romantic affair with the consort of the emperor was <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> Sandai Jitsuroku describes his rank as going down from Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade to Senior Sixth Rank, Upper Grade, before again rising to Junior Fifth Rank, Upper Grade the following year. However, it has also been speculated that this may be an error in the Sandai Jitsuroku as a result of binding changing the order of events. Furthermore, Fujiwara no Takaiko reputedly had an affair with the monk , which may have formed the core of the otherwise fictional legend that she also had an affair with Narihira. Whether the affair was historical or not, the Reizei family's commentary on The Tales of Ise speculates that Emperor Yōzei was a product of this union, and not the previous emperor.|$|E
5|$|The stipulations {{contained}} in the Act caused significant controversy during debates over NATO's military command structure. Both Striking Fleet Atlantic and the United States Sixth Fleet have never been allowed to be placed anywhere but directly under American commanding officers—the Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic and Commander-in-Chief, Allied Forces Southern Europe—because the dominant legal interpretation of the McMahon Act has been that nuclear striking forces cannot be controlled by non-US commanders. This {{was the reason for}} the formation of Striking Fleet Atlantic as an independent entity, instead of being operationally subordinated to the UK Admiral serving as Commander-in-Chief, Eastern Atlantic, in October–November 1952. This was also <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> Sixth Fleet, in its NATO guise as Naval Striking and Support Force, South, was placed under American control rather than Allied Forces Mediterranean when the European commands were agreed at the same time.|$|E

Brahaspati invites Shiva and the royal family on an expedition to Mount Mandar, where the legendary Somras is manufactured using {{the waters of the}} Saraswati river. Shiva learns that the potion which made his throat turn blue was actually undiluted Somras, which can be lethal when taken in its pure form. However, Shiva was unaffected, which was the first sign that he was the Neelkanth. He also learns that Somras was <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> Meluhans lived for so many years.

Shiva and his troops reach the hill to find out that a large part of Mandar has been blasted off and many of the inventors killed. There is no sign of Brahaspati, but Shiva finds the insignia of the Nagas, confirming their involvement in the treacherous wars of the Chandravanshis.|$|E
5|$|Silver is {{a rather}} unreactive metal. This is because its filled 4d shell is not very {{effective}} in shielding the electrostatic forces of attraction from the nucleus to the outermost 5s electron, and hence silver is {{near the bottom of}} the electrochemical series (E0(Ag+/Ag) = +0.799V). In group 11, silver has the lowest first ionization energy (showing the instability of the 5s orbital), but has higher second and third ionization energies than copper and gold (showing the stability of the 4d orbitals), so that the chemistry of silver is predominantly that of the +1 oxidation state, reflecting the increasingly limited range of oxidation states along the transition series as the d-orbitals fill and stabilize. Unlike copper, for which the larger hydration energy of Cu2+ as compared to Cu+ is <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> former is the more stable in aqueous solution and solids despite lacking the stable filled d-subshell of the latter, silver is large enough that this factor has a much smaller effect, and furthermore the second ionisation energy of silver is greater than that for copper. Hence, Ag+ is the stable species in aqueous solution and solids, with Ag2+ being much less stable as it oxidizes water.|$|E
