During 1997, Period 1 (mPer1) and Period 2 (mPer2) genes were discovered (Sun <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 1997 and Albretch <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 1997). Through homology screens with the Drosophila per, these genes were discovered. It was independently discovered by Sun <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 1997, naming it RIGUI and by <b>Tei</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 1997, who named it hper {{because of the}} protein sequence similarity with Drosophila per. They found that the mouse homolog had the properties of a circadian regulator. It had circadian expression in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), self-sustained oscillation, and entrainment of circadian expression by external light cues.|$|R
40|$|Circadian, or near- 24 -h, {{rhythms of}} {{biological}} processes that {{persist in the}} absence of environmental cues, have been described in organisms ranging from photosynthetic bacteria to humans. The molecular clocks that control these rhythms are highly conserved across a broad range of species (King <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 1997; Sun <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 1997; <b>Tei</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 1997). Such clocks provide critical controls allowing organisms to adapt to daily cycles in environmental conditions. The interaction of endogenous clocks and external signals, such as temperature, time of feeding and light, coordinate physiological functions so that they occur at a particular phase of each day. In the present study, we have asked whether serotonin levels in the lobster brain are under circadian control. We are interested in this question because serotonin regulates a variety of functions in crustaceans (Beltz and Kravitz, 2003). Amon...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: The {{tricuspid valve}} (TV) {{is a complex}} {{structure}} (Lamers <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> (1995) [1]). The {{most common cause of}} pathologic tricuspid regurgitation is functional, due to annular dilatation with normal leaflet morphology (Sagie <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> (1994) [2]). Myxomatous disease of the tricuspid valve is often associated with mitral valve involvement but isolated tricuspid prolapse has been rarely reported (<b>Tei</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> (1983) [3]). Unlike the common combination between rheumatic mitral valve stenosis and functional tricuspid regurgitation, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, this is the first case of such combination between tricuspid valve prolapse and rheumatic mitral valve stenosis reported with three-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography (3 D-TEE). Case presentation: We are presenting a 43 -year-old female patient that had dyspnea on effort NYHA class III. A transthoracic echocardiography showed severe rheumatic mitral valve stenosis with severe tricuspid regurgitation. A routine preoperative 2 D-transesophageal echocardiography (2 D-TEE) showed severe rheumatic mitral valve stenosis with severe tricuspid regurgitation due to prolapse of one of the tricuspid valve leaflets. 3 D-TEE showed prolapse of the medial half of the posterior leaflet of the tricuspid valve. These findings were confirmed during surgery and had led to a change in the surgical plan from traditional mitral valve replacement with tricuspid valve annuloplasty, to mitral valve replacement with tricuspid valve anatomical repair. Conclusion: The tricuspid valve is a complex structure. 2 D-TTE and TEE is not usually enough for complete delineation of the anatomy and pathology of the tricuspid valve. 3 D-TEE has an incremental value in providing informative en-face view of the three leaflets of the tricuspid valve that facilitates precise determination of its anatomy and pathology. This is a rare case of unusual combination between tricuspid valve prolapse and rheumatic mitral valve stenosis...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{myocardial}} {{performance index}} (MPI), {{also known as}} the Tei index, was introduced by <b>Tei</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> to evaluate cardiac function in adults with dilated cardiomyopathy. This index is defined as the sum of isovolumic contraction time (ICT) and isovolumic relaxation time (IRT), divided by ejection time (ET). Objectives: To determine the correlation between pulsed Doppler (PD) - and tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) -derived Tei indices in fetuses. Patients and Methods: Right and left ventricle PD and TDI echocardiographic data were obtained from 59 fetuses (11 pregnant women who were positive for anti-SSA-Ro or anti-SSB-La antibodies, 18 women who were referred due to dysrhythmia, and 30 women who had normal clinical findings). Results: Mean fetal gestational age was 27 ± 6. 4 weeks. Mean PD Tei index of the mitral and tricuspid valve was 0. 58 ± 0. 05 and 0. 53 ± 0. 08, respectively. Mean TDI indices for the mitral and tricuspid valve were 0. 56 ± 0. 09 and 0. 55 ± 0. 08, respectively. There {{were no significant differences between}} mitral and tricuspid PD- and TDI-derived Tei indices (P = 0. 87, P= 0. 21), but the Bland-Altman diagrams showed no fine agreement between the indices (the mean difference ± 1 standard deviation of the right ventricular PD- and TDI-derived Tei indices was 0. 24 ± 0. 02 and 0. 29 ± 0. 04 for the left ventricle). There were no significant differences in PD- and TDI-derived Tei indexes between groups of evaluated fetuses (Mitral valve: PD-Tei P= 0. 69, TDI-Tei P= 0. 49; Tricuspid valve: PD-Tei P= 0. 41, TDI-Tei P= 0. 36).
