2500|$|In November 1965, {{an article}} was {{published}} involving an antique oak rocking chair {{said to have}} been previously owned by attorney Charlie Willett, a Bell descendant. <b>The</b> <b>rocking</b> <b>chair</b> was recently sold in an estate sale to Mrs. J. C. Adams, owner of an antique store on U.S. 41. A customer sat down in the chair, after learning it was not for sale, and while rocking in the chair asked Mrs. Adams if she believed in the supernatural. Two weeks later, the customer's daughter visited the home of Mrs. Adams and said after her mother had left and visited the Bell cemetery a voice told her to [...] "stand up and look around, you will find something of much value." [...] After some car trouble, the woman walked out into a field and found a black iron kettle turned over. She turned the kettle over and found a pearl buckle in the grass. The woman's daughter reported a jeweler estimated the buckle to be 160 to 200 years old.|$|E
2500|$|The Ford's Theatre Museum {{beneath the}} theater {{contains}} {{portions of the}} Olroyd Collection of Lincolniana. Most recently renovated and reimagined for a July 2009 reopening, the Museum is run through {{a partnership with the}} National Park Service and the private non-profit 501(c)(3) Ford's Theatre Society. The collection includes multiple items related to the assassination, including the Derringer pistol used to carry out the shooting, Booth's diary and the original door to Lincoln's theater box. In addition, a number of Lincoln's family items, his coat (without the blood-stained pieces), some statues of Lincoln and several large portraits of the President are on display in the museum. The blood-stained pillow from the President's deathbed is in the Ford's Theatre Museum. [...] In addition to covering the assassination conspiracy, the renovated museum focuses on Lincoln's arrival in Washington, his presidential cabinet, family life in the White House and his role as orator and emancipator. The museum also features exhibits about Civil War milestones and generals and about the building's history as a theatrical venue. <b>The</b> <b>rocking</b> <b>chair</b> in which Lincoln was sitting is now on display at The Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan.|$|E

2500|$|Klein's {{greatest}} achievement {{as a poet}} came in 1948 {{with the}} publication of <b>The</b> <b>Rocking</b> <b>Chair</b> and Other Poems. The book earned Klein a Governor General's Award in poetry and sold in numbers far exceeding the norm for a book of Canadian poetry. The success of the book owed much to Klein's new-found focus on domestic Canadian subjects, particularly the culture of French Canada, which Klein, fluent in French and sympathetic to their minority status in North America, understood better than most English-Canadian writers of his day. Along with the oft-anthologized title poem, [...] "The Rocking Chair," [...] a poem that uses the chair in a rural Quebec house as a synecdoche of French-Canadian heritage, the book included such poems as [...] "Lookout: Mont Royal," [...] "Grain Elevator," [...] and [...] "The Cripples," [...] all of which showed Klein {{at the height of his}} creative powers and survived long after as lyrical encapsulations of specific aspects and locations of Montreal. A lengthy elegy at the end of the book, [...] "Portrait of the Poet as Landscape," [...] reflected Klein's indignation at the general indifference of the Canadian public to its own literature.|$|E
2500|$|The {{family members}} all played music. [...] Mr. Scruggs had played an open back banjo using the frailing technique, though {{as an adult}} Earl had no {{recollection}} of his father's playing. Mrs. Scruggs played the pump organ. Earl's siblings, older brothers Junie and Horace, and older sisters Eula Mae and Ruby, all played banjo and guitar. Scruggs recalls a visit to his uncle's home at age six to hear a blind banjo player named Mack Woolbright, who played a finger picking style and had recorded for Columbia Records. This made an impression on Scruggs, who said, [...] "He'd sit in <b>the</b> <b>rocking</b> <b>chair,</b> and he'd pick some {{and it was just}} amazing. I couldn't imagine — he was the first, what I call a good banjo player." [...] Scruggs then took up the instrument — he was too small to hold it at first and improvised by setting his brother Junie's banjo beside him on the floor. He moved it around depending on what part of the neck he was playing. [...] After his father's death, Scruggs seemed to take solace in playing music, and when not in school or doing farm chores, spent nearly every spare moment he had practicing. His first radio performance was at age 11 on a talent scout show.|$|E

5|$|Though {{some stories}} {{attribute}} its invention to Benjamin Franklin, historians trace <b>the</b> <b>rocking</b> <b>chair's</b> origins to North America {{during the early}} 18th century. It arrived in England shortly after its development, although work continued in America. The production of wicker <b>rocking</b> <b>chairs</b> reached its peak in America {{during the middle of}} the 18th century.|$|R

6000|$|As {{she moved}} about, getting {{dinner on the}} table, Will sat with gloomy face, {{listening}} to the [...] "clack" [...] of the old man. The room was a poor little sitting room, with furniture worn and shapeless; hardly a touch of pleasant color, save {{here and there a}} little bit of Agnes's handiwork. The lounge, covered with calico, was rickety; <b>the</b> <b>rocking</b> <b>chair</b> matched it, and the carpet of rags was patched and darned with twine in twenty places. Everywhere was the influence of the Kinneys. The furniture looked like them, in fact.|$|E

60|$|She {{stayed for}} the sacrament, {{and it may}} here be remarked that on that {{afternoon}} she rated both the footman and housemaid because they omitted to do so. She thought, we must presume, that she was doing her duty, and must imagine her to have been ignorant that she was cheating her husband and cheating her friend. She took the sacrament with admirable propriety of demeanour, and then, on her return home, withdrew another chair from the set. There would still be six, including <b>the</b> <b>rocking</b> <b>chair,</b> and six would be quite enough for that little hole of a room.|$|E
6000|$|The {{house was}} in a woeful state. In <b>the</b> <b>rocking</b> <b>chair,</b> beside the high guard that {{surrounded}} the hearth, sat the mother, rocking, looking sadly shaken now her excitement was over. Lettie was nursing the little baby, and Emily the next child. George was smoking his pipe and trying to look natural. The little kitchen was crowded—there was no room—there {{was not even a}} place on the table for the stew-jar, so I gathered together cups and mugs containing tea sops, and set down the vessel of ignominy on the much slopped tea-cloth. The four little children were striped and patched with tears—at my entrance one under the table recommenced to weep, so I gave him my pencil which pushed in and out, but which pushes in and out no more. The sight of the stewpot affected the mother afresh. She wept again, crying: ...|$|E
