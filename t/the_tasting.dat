25|$|As part of <b>the</b> <b>tasting</b> process, {{and as a}} way of {{comparing}} the merits of the various wines, wines are given scores according to a relatively set system. This may be either by explicitly weighting different aspects, or by global judgment (although the same aspects would be considered). These aspects are 1) the appearance of the wine, 2) the nose or smell, 3) the palate or taste, and 4) overall. Different systems weight these differently (e.g., appearance 15%, nose 35%, palate 50%). Typically, no modern wine would score less than half on any scale (which would effectively indicate an obvious fault). It is more common for wines to be scored out of 20 (including half marks) in Europe and parts of Australasia, and out of 100 in the US. However, different critics tend to have their own preferred system, and some gradings are also given out of 5 (again with half marks).|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{structure}} of <b>the</b> <b>taste</b> organ and <b>the</b> physiological properties of <b>the</b> <b>taste</b> cell of <b>the</b> bullfrog (Rana catabeiana) after the glossopharyngeal nerve transaction were investigated. <b>The</b> frog <b>taste</b> organ {{is composed of}} taste, supporting and basal cells.

However, <b>the</b> <b>taste</b> cells still had resting potentials and responded to four basic taste stimuli by generating receptor potentials with the various lengths of duration, even 140 days after denervation.

Visitors can sample the smells of each Guinness ingredient in <b>the</b> <b>Tasting</b> Rooms, which are coloured with a unique lighting design that emits Guinness' gold and black branding. A pint of Guinness is offered which the visitor may pour after a demonstration by one of the staff. There are videos showing how Guinness is tested by a panel of tasters, and the visitor is instructed in tasting the beer. The tour includes such items as the historical coopering trade within Guinness, a section dedicated to advertising and merchandising by Guinness, and a section dedicated to historical artefacts and footage relating to Guinness. The tour finishes with a pint of Guinness (if it has not already been drunk at one of the other bars) in the Gravity Bar. Two other bars, a coffee shop and a restaurant, are available to visitors during the tour, and a range of Guinness merchandise is available to purchase.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Taste</b> buds contain <b>the</b> <b>taste</b> {{receptor}} cells, {{which are}} also known as gustatory cells. <b>The</b> <b>taste</b> receptors are located around the small structures known as papillae found on the upper surface of the tongue, soft palate, upper esophagus, the cheek and epiglottis.

[...] A popular myth assigns these different tastes to different regions of the tongue; in reality these tastes can be detected by any area of the tongue.

Locally produced or handcrafted cheeses can be found in puestos de queseros or cheesemongers’ stalls, packed into baskets and wooden hoops, wrapped in corn husks, or pressed into flat, white, wide disks. Some specialty cheese producers have been invited to compete internationally. The Carlos Peraza family won a medal at the Cofradía de Quesos de Saint Maure in Touraine, France. In Baja California’s wine country, a notable cheese-making concern is La Cava de Marcelo.

President and CEO David Duncan said {{at the opening of the}} new Silver Oak Oakville winery, [...] "Though the fire was devastating, it presented us with a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. We were able to take 35 years of experience in winemaking and hospitality and apply it to create an ideal space for making our Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon and entertaining our guests." [...] David Duncan said, [...] "The new winery is a winemaker's dream. We incorporated all the technological advancements of recent years into the winery's design but made sure we could accommodate changes down the line." [...] The rebuild included using some 550 tons of reclaimed stone from a 115-year-old dismantled mill in Coffeyville, Kansas, installing 1,464 solar panels to generate solar power for the facility, elevating the property 4.5 feet above the flood plain and moving their iconic water tower 12 feet. The Duncan Family was able to salvage the two stained glass windows in the original winery that had been created by local artist Diane Peterson in the theme of the Napa Valley. With the rebuild of the winery, they asked Diane Peterson to create two new stained glass windows. [...] Together, the windows represent the four seasons.
