A ball must completely cross a boundary line to be out of play, and a ball must wholly cross the goal line before a goal is scored.|$|E
5|$|The first section, {{entitled}} Definitions and Distinctions, {{consists of}} five chapters and details how Wellek and Warren define literature. This section also contrasts Wellek and Warren's definition {{with those of}} others, such views of literature as everything in print and as only belles-lettres (accepted literary canon). <b>They</b> <b>define</b> literary scholarship as beyond the personal ("super-personal") and contrasted with the literary arts by its more scientific approach. Wellek and Warren suggest that neither a purely objective nor a purely subjective approach {{would be able to}} properly describe literature. They note that literary scholarship should not only examine what makes a work or author unique, but also its general characteristics that allow it to be compared to other works.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} ways to {{classify}} climates into similar regimes. Originally, climes were defined in Ancient Greece to describe the weather depending upon a location's latitude. Modern climate classification methods can be broadly divided into genetic methods, which focus on the causes of climate, and empiric methods, which focus on the effects of climate. Examples of genetic classification include methods based on the relative frequency of different air mass types or locations within synoptic weather disturbances. Examples of empiric classifications include climate zones defined by plant hardiness, evapotranspiration, or more generally the Köppen climate classification which was originally designed to identify the climates associated with certain biomes. A common shortcoming of these classification schemes is that they produce distinct boundaries between the zones <b>they</b> <b>define,</b> rather than the gradual transition of climate properties more common in nature.|$|E

5|$|Business design {{management}} {{deals with the}} newly emerging field of integrating design thinking into management. In organisation and management theory, design thinking forms part of the Architecture / Design / Anthropology (A/D/A) paradigm which characterizes innovative, human-centered enterprises. This paradigm focuses on a collaborative and iterative style of work and an adductive mode of thinking, compared to practices associated with the more traditional Mathematics / Economics / Psychology (M/E/P) management paradigm. Since 2006, the term Business Design is trademarked by the Rotman School of Management; <b>they</b> <b>define</b> business design as the application of design thinking principles to business practice. The designerly way of problem solving is an integrative way of thinking that {{is characterized by a}} deep understanding of the user, creative resolution of tensions, collaborative prototyping, and continuous modification and enhancement of ideas and solutions. This approach to problem solving can be applied to all components of business, and the management of the problem solving process forms the core of business {{design management}} activity. Universities other than the Rotman School of Management are offering similar academic education concepts, including the Aalto University in Finland, which initiated their International Design Business Management (IDBM) program in 1995.|$|E
5|$|In summary, the Fab {{region of}} the {{antibody}} determines antigen specificity while the Fc {{region of the}} antibody determines the antibody's class effect. Since only the constant domains of the heavy chains make up the Fc region of an antibody, the classes of heavy chain in antibodies determine their class effects. Possible classes of heavy chains in antibodies include alpha, gamma, delta, epsilon, and mu, and <b>they</b> <b>define</b> the antibody's isotypes IgA, G, D, E, and M, respectively. This infers different isotypes of antibodies have different class effects due to their different Fc regions binding and activating different types of receptors. Possible class effects of antibodies include: Opsonisation, agglutination, haemolysis, complement activation, mast cell degranulation, and neutralisation (though this class effect may be mediated by the Fab region rather than the Fc region). It also implies that Fab-mediated effects are directed at microbes or toxins, whilst Fc mediated effects are directed at effector cells or effector molecules (see below).|$|E

25|$|There {{are three}} ligaments {{associated}} with the temporomandibular joints: one major and two minor ligaments.
