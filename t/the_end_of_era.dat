The objective of this thesis is to survey the post-war development of the Bayreuth festival, personal contacts between the heirs of Wagner's legacy with representatives of the Third Reich or the sincerity of "denazification" of Bayreuth in the 50 s.

40|$|Background/Objective: Donor right {{hepatectomy}} (DRH) {{was developed}} by master liver surgeons and has been applied in many liver transplant centers as the mainstay for adult living donor liver transplantation. It is a major and complex surgical operation performed on living liver donors {{for the benefit of}} liver recipients. The donors deserve the lowest though inevitable morbidity and mortality. In this study, the surgical outcomes of DRH performed by newer surgeons at an established center were studied to assess the transferability of the techniques of this standardized procedure. Methods: We studied 450 consecutive DRHs performed by 11 surgeons. Three surgeons initiated and developed the transplant program and performed the first 200 DRHs (Era I). The role of chief surgeon in the following 250 DRHs (Era II) was gradually taken up by four newer surgeons with close guidance initially. Results: Blood loss and operation time at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>Era</b> I versus the beginning of Era II were 251 vs. 341  mL and 391 vs. 497  minutes. The learning curve effect in Era I did not occur in Era II. The complication rates of the last 50 cases in Era I and Era II were 16 % and 24 %, respectively. Era I had one donor death whereas Era II had no donor death. Conclusion: At an established center, DRH can be carried out safely by newer surgeons with good outcomes...|$|E

A) [...] Conservatory of Music and Dance. University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2013 This {{research on the}} Brazilian composer Walter Burle Marx (b São Paulo, 1902; d Akron, Ohio, 1990) {{is part of an}} ambitious project, which aims at publishing a performing edition of all four of Burle Marx's symphonies. His Symphony No. 2 (“Brasiliana”), written in 1950, reflects Burle Marx's national and cosmopolitan influences. The main part of this dissertation consists of my edition of the symphony based on the original manuscript. This is followed by biographical information on the composer and his times and an analysis of the symphony. The early twentieth century in Brazil was an effervescent period when nationalism was the watchword. This climate caused some hesitation when it came to accepting Burle Marx into the Brazilian musical scene not only as a composer but also as a conductor. Burle Marx's musical background forged an undeniable bond between music tradition and artistic nationalism, which was imperative to the composers of the time. Nonetheless, for the Brazilian modernist movement in the 1920 s, Burle Marx's German training in the 1920 s {{turned out to be an}} anathema. This dissertation investigates two aspects of Brazil's cultural and political environment between 1922 and 1945, a critical period which had a great impact on the development of Burle Marx's career. This era embraces two major moments in the cultural and political history of Brazil: 1) A Semana de Arte Moderna (“The Week of Modern Art”), which was a watershed development toward a new aesthetic orientation for Brazilian artists, and 2) <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>Era</b> Vargas, Getúlio Vargas' dictatorship (1930 - 1945).
