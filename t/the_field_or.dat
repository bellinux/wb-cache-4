5|$|Even {{though the}} new king was {{initially}} met with goodwill from his subjects, {{it was not}} long before certain members of the nobility became disaffected with Gaveston and the special relationship he enjoyed with Edward. On 2 December 1307, exactly one month after Gaveston's marriage, the King organised a tournament in Gaveston's honour at Wallingford Castle. Here Gaveston and his companions in arms handed a humiliating defeat to the earls of Warenne, Hereford, and Arundel. Gaveston won, according to various accounts of the events, either by bringing too many knights to <b>the</b> <b>field,</b> <b>or</b> simply by having a better contingent. From this point on Warenne – and possibly also the other two earls – became hostile to Gaveston.|$|E

5|$|Over time, as Rome's empire grew, the two annual consuls {{ceased to}} be enough to command its many armies in <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>or</b> {{administer}} its many provinces. To solve this problem, it became normal to prorogue the authority of current consuls and praetors beyond their normal terms so they could continue to command in the field. Over time, however, with increasing need for competent generals and administrators, prorogation of magistrates became the norm; and the device was used, increasingly by the assemblies, to grant imperium to popular politicians.|$|E
5|$|The ensuing {{battle was}} bloody, but was decided when Li Shimin {{and a part}} of his cavalry broke through the Xia lines and reached the eastern escarpment, {{planting}} the Tang banners in full view of both armies. Possibly coupled {{with the arrival of the}} flanking Tang cavalry, this development caused the complete collapse of the Xia army: trapped between the Tang forces and the eastern cliffs, 3,000 Xia soldiers fell in <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>or</b> the subsequent pursuit, but more than 50,000 were taken prisoner. These included Dou Jiande himself, who was wounded and captured while trying to find a way to cross the Yellow River.|$|E
5|$|The larval {{stages of}} B. rufimanus occur inside the seeds, and are {{therefore}} protected from any control measures, including chemical control. Bruchus rufimanus is most vulnerable at the adult stage. Most control measures have therefore targeted adults either at colonization stage in <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>or</b> at emergence in storage facilities. Control measures have been focused on direct control with insecticides, but restrictions and removal from market due to environmental concerns have increased the need for alternative measures.|$|E

5|$|Winch {{launches}} {{are much}} cheaper than aerotows and permit a higher launch frequency. A winch {{may also be}} used at sites where an aerotow could not operate, because of the shape of <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>or</b> because of noise restrictions. The height gained from a winch is usually less than from an aerotow so pilots {{need to find a}} source of lift soon after releasing from the cable, otherwise the flight will be short. A break in the cable or the weak link during a winch launch is a possibility for which pilots are trained.|$|E
5|$|The female {{may begin}} feeding by biting off the male's head (as {{they do with}} regular prey), and if mating has begun, the male's {{movements}} may become even more vigorous in its delivery of sperm. Early researchers thought that because copulatory movement is controlled by a ganglion in the abdomen, not the head, removal of the male's head was a reproductive strategy by females to enhance fertilization while obtaining sustenance. Later, this behavior {{appeared to be an}} artifact of intrusive laboratory observation. Whether the behavior is natural in <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>or</b> also the result of distractions caused by the human observer remains controversial. Mantises are highly visual organisms and notice any disturbance in the laboratory or field, such as bright lights or moving scientists. Chinese mantises that had been fed ad libitum (so that they were not hungry) actually displayed elaborate courtship behavior when left undisturbed. The male engages the female in a courtship dance, to change her interest from feeding to mating. Under such circumstances, the female has been known to respond with a defensive deimatic display by flashing the colored eyespots on the inside of her front legs.|$|E
5|$|With the {{establishment}} of a dynastic union with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in 1386, it became customary to use two bannersPolish and Lithuanianas equally important insignia of royal authority. In the mid-16th century, before the creation of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (real union) in 1569, a single banner for the entire entity also came into use. The Commonwealth banner was initially plain white emblazoned with the arms of the Commonwealth which combined the heraldic charges of Poland (White Eagle) and Lithuania (Pursuer). During the 17th century, the banner was often divided into three or four horizontal stripes of white and red, ending with swallowtails. Elective kings' dynastic arms were often placed in an inescutcheon. Variants with the White Eagle and the Pursuer placed side by side without an escutcheon directly in <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>or</b> with the Eagle on the obverse and the Pursuit on the reverse side of the banner were also used.|$|E

5|$|Because {{of their}} larval {{development}} inside the seeds which {{are protected by}} the pods, most inventorying methods are based on population of B. rufimanus adult in <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>or</b> at emergence. Adult population density can be estimated by counts on plants at field colonization. The development semiochemical attractants trapping systems for both monitoring and pest control has received particular interest in ongoing research on the weevil. Egg density can be estimated on young developing pods (>2 cm) during the oviposition period. Eggs are however small (<1mm length), green-yellowish, therefore difficult to observe. In addition, population estimate are difficult to obtain as egg laying is spread over time until 5–10 days {{after the end of}} flowering (BBCH 77). After harvest, seed quality can be observed manually at harvest and characterized according to pest damage (healthy, with no trace of damage/containing developing larvae/trace of emerged B. rufimanus adult (a hole in the seed). Alternative methods exist to sort the seeds: sorting can be done using differences in seed density due to the presence of the developing larva or of the hole left by the emerged adult, estimation of damages seeds can be done by tomography analysis. Additionally, the end of larval and pupal diapause and therefore the emergence of B. rufimanus can be induced via a solution of NaOCl and chinosol in 7 days at 30 °C, allowing the estimation of an overall infestation rate can be assessed.|$|E
