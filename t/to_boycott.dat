5|$|Greece, Australia, France, and United Kingdom are {{the only}} {{countries}} to be represented at every Olympic Games since their inception in 1896. While countries sometimes miss an Olympics {{due to a lack}} of qualified athletes, some choose <b>to</b> <b>boycott</b> a celebration of the Games for various reasons. The Olympic Council of Ireland boycotted the 1936 Berlin Games, because the IOC insisted its team needed to be restricted to the Irish Free State rather than representing the entire island of Ireland.|$|E

PETA has stated that sheep exported to countries outside the jurisdiction of Australia's animal cruelty laws are treated inhumanely and that halal meat processing facilities exist in Australia, making the export of live animals redundant. Entertainer Pink has pledged <b>to</b> <b>boycott</b> all Australian sheep products in protest.|$|E

5|$|Taiwan {{also decided}} <b>to</b> <b>boycott</b> these Games because the People's Republic of China (PRC) exerted {{pressure}} on the Montreal organising committee to keep the delegation from the Republic of China (ROC) from competing under that name. The ROC refused a proposed compromise that would have still allowed them to use the ROC flag and anthem {{as long as the}} name was changed. Taiwan did not participate again until 1984, when it returned under the name of Chinese Taipei and with a special flag and anthem.|$|E
5|$|The ADL's National Director Abraham H. Foxman {{has accused}} him of anti-Semitism as has Rabbi Abraham Cooper, {{associate}} dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center.

On 2 October 2015, Waters published an open letter in Salon criticising the band Bon Jovi for performing in Tel Aviv, which led Howard Stern to criticise Waters on his radio show. In June 2017 an organization known as We Don't Need No Roger Waters started <b>to</b> <b>boycott</b> Waters for his support of the BDS.|$|E
5|$|While {{a boycott}} by the United States was {{suggested}} due to Germany's National Socialist regime, {{it was not}} implemented as the President of the United States Olympic Committee, Avery Brundage, felt that politics should be kept separate from sport. The other NOCs which threatened <b>to</b> <b>boycott</b> the Games {{for the same reason}} were the United Kingdom, France, Sweden, Czechoslovakia and the Netherlands. An alternative People's Olympiad was planned to take place in Barcelona, Spain, but was cancelled at the last moment following the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War after the athletes had already begun to arrive. The civil war also meant that Spain's NOC did not compete at the 1936 Games. While no NOCs ended up boycotting the Games on anti-Nazi grounds, a multinational Jewish-led boycott of the Games took place, with individual athletes refusing to take part. Also, the IAAFs' refusal to allow athletes from Northern Ireland to compete for the Irish Olympic Council in athletics events led the Irish Free State <b>to</b> <b>boycott.</b>|$|E
25|$|The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops offered Mass as an {{alternative}} <b>to</b> <b>boycotting,</b> and suggested that churches toll their bells in memory of immigrants who died {{trying to come to}} the U.S. The bishops, too, urged students to stay in school.|$|R

5|$|Amid PCC/ZAPU's {{calls for}} various strikes and protests, {{including}} an appeal for black children <b>to</b> <b>boycott</b> state schools, Smith's Justice Minister Clifford Dupont had Nkomo and other PCC/ZAPU leaders restricted at Gonakudzingwa {{in the remote}} south-east two days after Smith took office. The politically motivated killing of a white man, Petrus Oberholzer, near Melsetter by ZANU insurgents on 4 July 1964 marked the start of intensified black nationalist violence and police counteraction that culminated in the banning of ZANU and PCC/ZAPU on 26 August, {{with most of the}} two movements' respective leaders concurrently jailed or restricted. ZANU, ZAPU and their respective guerrilla armies—the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA) and the Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA)—thereafter operated from abroad.|$|E
5|$|Chelvanayakam was re-elected in the July 1960 {{parliamentary}} election {{in which the}} SLFP and its leftist allies achieved a majority in parliament. No longer needing ITAK's support in parliament, the SLFP reneged on its pledges to honour the B-C pact and commenced enacting anti-Tamil policies, announcing the full operation of the Sinhala Only Act from January 1961 and using Sinhala in courts of law throughout the country. ITAK launched a campaign of civil disobedience in January 1961, beginning in Jaffna. Chelvanayakam started distributing leaflets outside Jaffna Kachcheri in Old Park urging Tamil civil servants <b>to</b> <b>boycott</b> government offices and cease using Sinhala. The campaign was hugely successful and large crowds, including ITAK MPs, gathered {{in front of the}} Kachcheri and staged a protest rally.|$|E

This prompted officers and clerks from different organisations, including colleges, banks and the radio station, <b>to</b> <b>boycott</b> offices and join the procession. Protesters burned the offices of two leading pro-government news agencies, the Jubilee Press and the Morning News. Police fired on a major janaza, or mourning rally, as it was passing through Nawabpur Road.

The communication, directed to the Soviet Union's head of track and field, was prepared by Dr. Sergei Portugalov of the Institute for Physical Culture. Portugalov {{was also one of the}} main figures involved in the implementation of the Russian doping program prior to the 2016 Summer Olympics.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi {{expanded}} his nonviolent non-co-operation platform {{to include the}} swadeshi policy—the boycott of foreign-made goods, especially British goods. Linked to this was his advocacy that khadi (homespun cloth) be worn by all Indians instead of British-made textiles. Gandhi exhorted Indian men and women, rich or poor, to spend time each day spinning khadi {{in support of the}} independence movement. In addition to boycotting British products, Gandhi urged the people <b>to</b> <b>boycott</b> British institutions and law courts, to resign from government employment, and to forsake British titles and honours. Gandhi thus began his journey aimed at crippling the British India government economically, politically and administratively.|$|E
