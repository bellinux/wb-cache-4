5|$|In 1982, Ian Gillan {{announced}} the band would fold, as {{he needed to}} rest his damaged vocal cords. The <b>tone</b> <b>and</b> style of his singing changed considerably when he eventually returned. His voice had a more nasal <b>tone</b> <b>and</b> this can be heard on albums he has made from 1983 to the present day. His use of multi-tracked backing vocals also became highly prominent. The rest of the band Gillan, particularly McCoy and Towns, were not happy at the sudden disbanding of the group so soon after the success of Magic, and sued Gillan for royalties.|$|E

5|$|Although it {{surprised}} jazz listeners upon its release in 1977, Goin' Home was praised by music critics for its reverent <b>tone</b> <b>and</b> stylistic deviation from Shepp's previous free jazz works.

5|$|The novella won the Hugo Award in 1972, and was {{nominated}} for several other awards. It received generally positive reviews from reviewers and scholars, and was variously described as moving and hard-hitting. Several critics, however, stated that it compared unfavorably with Le Guin's other works such as The Left Hand of Darkness, due to its sometimes polemic <b>tone</b> <b>and</b> lack of complex characters.|$|E
5|$|Various {{changes to}} {{characters}} such as Gandalf, Aragorn, Arwen, Denethor, Faramir, Gimli, and Frodo, when considered together, were {{seen by some}} to alter the <b>tone</b> <b>and</b> themes found in the books.

5|$|Art {{historian}} Robert Koch remarked in 1988 on {{the similarity}} of provenance, material, technique, <b>tone</b> <b>and</b> colour of the four works described by Eastlake. He proposed that they were intended as wings of a five-part polyptych altarpiece. Based on the format of Bouts' 1464–67 Altar of Holy Sacrament, whose four wing panels are the same length as The Entombment, he believes the altarpiece would have comprised a large central panel with four works half its length and width positioned two at either side. His speculative reconstruction places The Entombment on the upper right-hand wing, above the Adoration.|$|E
