5|$|The genetic {{mutations}} seen in serous carcinoma are chromosomal instability and mutations in <b>TP53,</b> an important tumor suppressor gene.|$|E
5|$|Researchers are {{investigating}} the clinical significance of c-KIT mutations in AML. These are prevalent, and potentially clinically relevant because {{of the availability of}} tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as imatinib and sunitinib that can block the activity of c-KIT pharmacologically. It is expected that additional markers (e.g., RUNX1, ASXL1, and <b>TP53)</b> that have consistently been associated with an inferior outcome will soon be included in these recommendations. The prognostic importance of other mutated genes (e.g., DNMT3A, IDH1, IDH2) is less clear.|$|E
25|$|In humans, {{a common}} {{polymorphism}} involves {{the substitution of}} an arginine for a proline at codon position 72. Many studies have investigated a genetic link between this variation and cancer susceptibility; however, {{the results have been}} controversial. For instance, a meta-analysis from 2009 failed to show a link for cervical cancer. A 2011 study found that the <b>TP53</b> proline mutation did {{have a profound effect on}} pancreatic cancer risk among males. A study of Arab women found that proline homozygosity at <b>TP53</b> codon 72 is associated with a decreased risk for breast cancer. One study suggested that <b>TP53</b> codon 72 polymorphisms, MDM2 SNP309, and A2164G may collectively be associated with non-oropharyngeal cancer susceptibility and that MDM2 SNP309 in combination with <b>TP53</b> codon 72 may accelerate the development of non-oropharyngeal cancer in women. A 2011 study found that <b>TP53</b> codon 72 polymorphism was associated with an increased risk of lung cancer.|$|E
25|$|In humans, the <b>TP53</b> gene {{is located}} on the short arm of {{chromosome}} 17 (17p13.1). The gene spans 20 kb, with a non-coding exon 1 and a very long first intron of 10 kb. The coding sequence contains five regions showing a high degree of conservation in vertebrates, predominantly in exons 2, 5, 6, 7 and 8, but the sequences found in invertebrates show only distant resemblance to mammalian <b>TP53.</b> <b>TP53</b> orthologs have been identified in most mammals for which complete genome data are available.|$|E
25|$|Li–Fraumeni {{syndrome}} (germline <b>TP53</b> mutation) is a {{predisposing factor}} for osteosarcoma development.|$|E
25|$|The name p53 {{was given}} in 1979 {{describing}} the apparent molecular mass; SDS-PAGE analysis indicates {{that it is a}} 53-kilodalton (kDa) protein. However, the actual mass of the full-length p53 protein (p53α) based on the sum of masses of the amino acid residues is only 43.7 kDa. This difference is due to the high number of proline residues in the protein, which slow its migration on SDS-PAGE, thus making it appear heavier than it actually is. In addition to the full-length protein, the human <b>TP53</b> gene encodes at least 15 protein isoforms, ranging in size from 3.5 to 43.7 kDa. All these p53 proteins are called the p53 isoforms. The <b>TP53</b> gene is the most frequently mutated gene (>50%) in human cancer, indicating that the <b>TP53</b> gene plays a crucial role in preventing cancer formation. <b>TP53</b> gene encodes proteins that bind to DNA and regulate gene expression to prevent mutations of the genome.|$|E
25|$|It {{occasionally}} {{shows an}} abundant stromal reticulin network and presents a high frequency of <b>TP53</b> gene mutations.|$|E
25|$|Meta-analyses from 2011 {{found no}} {{significant}} associations between <b>TP53</b> codon 72 polymorphisms and both colorectal cancer risk and endometrial cancer risk. A 2011 study of a Brazilian birth cohort found an association between the non mutant arginine <b>TP53</b> and individuals without {{a family history of}} cancer. Another 2011 study found that the p53 homozygous (Pro/Pro) genotype was associated with a significantly increased risk for renal cell carcinoma.|$|E
25|$|Through genome {{sequencing}} of a Sonic- Hedgehog medulloblastoma (SHH-MB) brain tumour, a significant link between <b>TP53</b> mutations and chromothripsis in SHH-MBs has been found. Further {{studies on the}} association between <b>TP53</b> and chromothripsis has signified a role for p53, a tumour suppressor protein, in the massive genomic rearrangement which take place which takes place in chromothripsis. Hence {{there is a strong}} association between p53 status and chromothripsis, giving an insight into why some cancers are more aggressive.|$|E
25|$|Mutations in the <b>TP53</b> gene are {{important}} {{for the maintenance of}} genome stability has been seen to be a predisposing mutation for chromothripsis.|$|E
25|$|RAB11FIP1, <b>TP53,</b> PTEN and rs4973768 {{are also}} {{associated}} with increased risk of breast cancer. rs6504950 is associated with lower risk of breast cancer.|$|E
25|$|Part of the {{hereditary}} non-BRCA1 and non-BRCA2 breast tumors may {{be associated}} to rare syndromes, of which breast cancer is only one component. Such syndromes result notably from mutations in <b>TP53</b> (Li-Fraumeni syndrome), ATM (Ataxia Telangiectasia), STK11/LKB1(Peutz-Jeghers syndrome), PTEN (Cowden syndrome).|$|E
25|$|Kelavkar and Badr (1999) {{stated that}} the ALOX15 gene maps to 17p13.3 in close {{proximity}} to the tumor-suppressor gene <b>TP53</b> (191170). In humans, it is encoded by the ALOX15 gene located on chromosome 17p13.3. This 11 kilobase pair gene consists of 14 exons and 13 introns coding for a 75 kiloDalton protein composed of 662 amino acids. 15-LO is to be distinguished from another human 15-lipoxygenase enzyme, ALOX15B (also termed 15-lipoxygenase-2). Orthologs of ALOX15, termed Alox15, are widely distributed in animal and plant species but commonly have different enzyme activities and make somewhat different products than ALOX15.|$|E
25|$|Peto's Paradox is the observation, due to Richard Peto, that at {{the species}} level, the {{incidence}} of cancer {{does not appear to}} correlate with the number of cells in an organism. For example, the incidence of cancer in humans is much higher than the incidence of cancer in whales. This is despite the fact that a whale has many more cells than a human. If the probability of carcinogenesis were constant across cells, one would expect whales to have a higher incidence of cancer than humans. The same is true of elephants. In October 2015, two independent studies showed that elephants have 20 copies of a tumor suppressor gene <b>TP53</b> in their genome, where humans and other mammals have only one, thus providing a possible solution to the paradox.|$|E
25|$|Predictive and presymptomatic testing: Predictive and presymptomatic {{types of}} testing {{are used to}} detect gene {{mutations}} associated with disorders that appear after birth, often later in life. These tests can be helpful {{to people who have}} a family member with a genetic disorder, but who have no features of the disorder themselves at the time of testing. Predictive testing can identify mutations that increase a person's chances of developing disorders with a genetic basis, such as certain types of cancer. For example, an individual with a mutation in BRCA1 has a 65% cumulative risk of breast cancer. Hereditary breast cancer along with ovarian cancer syndrome are caused by gene alterations in the genes BRCA1 and BRCA2. Major cancer types related to mutations in these genes are female breast cancer, ovarian, prostate, pancreatic, and male breast cancer. Li-Fraumeni syndrome is caused by a gene alteration on the gene <b>TP53.</b> Cancer types associated with a mutation on this gene include breast cancer, soft tissue sarcoma, osteosarcoma (bone cancer), leukemia and brain tumors. In the Cowden syndrome there is a mutation on the PTEN gene, causing potential breast, thyroid or endometrial cancer. Presymptomatic testing can determine whether a person will develop a genetic disorder, such as hemochromatosis (an iron overload disorder), before any signs or symptoms appear. The results of predictive and presymptomatic testing can provide information about a person’s risk of developing a specific disorder, help with making decisions about medical care and provide a better prognosis.|$|E
500|$|The genetic events {{found in}} ductal {{adenocarcinoma}} {{have been well}} characterized, and complete exome sequencing has been done for the common types of tumor. Four genes have each {{been found to be}} mutated in the majority of adenocarcinomas: KRAS (in 95% of cases), CDKN2A (also in 95%), <b>TP53</b> (75%), and SMAD4 (55%). [...] The last of these are especially associated with a poor prognosis. [...] SWI/SNF mutations/deletions occur in about 10–15% of the adenocarcinomas. [...] The genetic alterations in several other types of pancreatic cancer and precancerous lesions have also been researched. Transcriptomics analyses and mRNA sequencing for the common forms of pancreatic cancer have found that 75% of human genes are expressed in the tumors, with some 200 genes more specifically expressed in pancreatic cancer as compared to other tumor types.|$|E
2500|$|It {{has also}} been shown that <b>TP53</b> {{mutation}} comprising cells show preference to low fidelity repair mechanisms such as non-homologous end joining. [...] <b>TP53</b> mutations have also been expressed in cells that exhibit shorter and are more end-end fusion prone. It is also hypothesized that <b>TP53</b> mutations may be implicated in premature chromosome condensation. <b>TP53</b> may also contribute to the ability of cells to survive the catastrophic event that normally would be considered to be too destructive to withstand.|$|E
2500|$|Tumor protein p53, {{also known}} as p53, {{cellular}} tumor antigen p53 (UniProt name), phosphoprotein p53, [...] tumor suppressor p53, antigen NY-CO-13, or transformation-related protein 53 (TRP53), is any isoform of a protein encoded by homologous genes in various organisms, such as <b>TP53</b> (humans) and Trp53 (mice). This homolog (originally thought to be, and often spoken of as, a single protein) is crucial in multicellular organisms, where it prevents cancer formation, thus, functions as a tumor suppressor. As such, p53 {{has been described as}} [...] "the guardian of the genome" [...] because of its role in conserving stability by preventing genome mutation. Hence <b>TP53</b> is classified as a tumor suppressor gene. (Italics are used to denote the <b>TP53</b> gene name and distinguish it from the protein it encodes.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The Proneural subtype {{often has}} {{high rates of}} {{alterations}} in <b>TP53</b> (p53), and in PDGFRA, the gene encoding a-type platelet-derived growth factor receptor, and in IDH1, the gene encoding isocitrate dehydrogenase-1.|$|E
2500|$|Classical : Ninety-seven {{percent of}} tumors in the 'classical' subtype carry extra {{copies of the}} {{epidermal}} growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene, and most have higher than normal expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), whereas the gene <b>TP53</b> (p53), which is often mutated in glioblastoma, is rarely mutated in this subtype.|$|E
2500|$|Research in {{patients}} with chromothripsis-associated cancers may provide some information about prognosis. <b>TP53</b> mutations and chromothripsis have been linked in SHH medulloblastoma patients. Poor clinical outcome in neuroblastomas (such as those caused by deletion of the FANC gene in Fanconi Anaemia) {{has been linked to}} the frequent occurrence chromothripsis. [...] Screening biopsy materials for chromothripsis in good prognosis estimates and better treatment of patients.|$|E
2500|$|HPV+OPC {{patients}} {{are less likely}} to develop other cancers, compared to other head and neck cancer patients. A possible explanation for the favourable impact of HPV+ is [...] "the lower probability of occurrence of 11q13 gene amplification, which {{is considered to be a}} factor underlying faster and more frequent recurrence of the disease" [...] Presence of <b>TP53</b> mutations, a marker for HPV- OPC, is associated with worse prognosis. High grade of p16 staining is thought to be better than HPV PCR analysis in predicting radiotherapy response.|$|E
2500|$|Kelavkar and Badr (1999) {{stated that}} the ALOX15 gene product is implicated in antiinflammation, {{membrane}} remodeling, and cancer development/metastasis. Kelavkar and Badr (1999) described experiments yielding data that supported the hypothesis that loss of the <b>TP53</b> gene, or gain-of-function activities resulting from the expression of its mutant forms, regulates ALOX15 promoter activity in human and in mouse, albeit in directionally opposite manners. These studies defined a direct link between ALOX15 gene activity and an established tumor-suppressor gene located in close chromosomal proximity. Kelavkar and Badr (1999) referred to this as evidence that 15-lipoxygenase is a mutator gene.|$|E
2500|$|Some basic conventions, such as (1) that animal/human homolog (ortholog) pairs {{differ in}} letter case (title case and all caps, respectively) and (2) that the symbol is {{italicized}} {{when referring to}} the gene but nonitalic when referring to the protein, are often not followed by contributors to public health journals. Many journals have the copyeditors restyle the casing and formatting to the extent feasible, although in complex genetics discussions only subject-matter experts (SMEs) can effortlessly parse them all. One example that illustrates the potential for ambiguity among non-SMEs is that some official gene names have the word [...] "protein" [...] within them, so the phrase [...] "brain protein I3 (BRI3)" [...] (referring to the gene) and [...] "brain protein I3 (BRI3)" [...] (referring to the protein) are both valid. The AMA Manual gives another example: both [...] "the TH gene" [...] and [...] "the TH gene" [...] can validly be parsed as correct ("the gene for tyrosine hydroxylase"), because the first mentions the alias (description) and the latter mentions the symbol. This seems confusing on the surface, although {{it is easier to}} understand when explained as follows: in this gene's case, as in many others, the alias (description) [...] "happens to use the same letter string" [...] that the symbol uses. (The matching of the letters is of course acronymic in origin and thus the phrase [...] "happens to" [...] implies more coincidence than is actually present; but phrasing it that way helps to make the explanation clearer.) There is no way for a non-SME to know this is the case for any particular letter string without looking up every gene from the manuscript in a database such as NCBI Gene, reviewing its symbol, name, and alias list, and doing some mental cross-referencing and double-checking (plus it helps to have biochemical knowledge). Most medical journals do not (in some cases cannot) pay for that level of fact-checking as part of their copyediting service level; therefore, it remains the author's responsibility. However, as pointed out earlier, many authors make little attempt to follow the letter case or italic guidelines; and regarding protein symbols, they often won't use the official symbol at all. For example, although the guidelines would call p53 protein [...] "TP53" [...] in humans or [...] "Tp53" [...] in rats, most authors call it [...] "p53" [...] in both (and even refuse to call it [...] "TP53" [...] if edits or queries try to), not least because of the biologic principle that many proteins are essentially or exactly the same molecules regardless of mammalian species. Regarding the gene, authors are usually willing to call it by its human-specific symbol and capitalization, <b>TP53,</b> and may even do so without being prompted by a query. But the end result of all these factors is that the published literature often does not follow the nomenclature guidelines completely.|$|E
50|$|Numb {{has been}} posited {{to have a}} role in tumor-suppression, through its ability to {{regulate}} Notch and <b>TP53.</b> Numb binds and inhibits the E3-ligase Mdm2 that is responsible for <b>TP53</b> ubiquitination and degradation. The ablation of Numb in a cell leads to a decrease in <b>TP53,</b> causing impaired apoptosis and cell cycle checkpoint response. Restoring Numb levels also restores <b>TP53</b> expression and tumor suppressant abilities.|$|E

50|$|A {{specific}} tumour protein 53 (<b>TP53)</b> expression {{pattern in}} the Fallopian tube epithelium - the ‘p53 signature’ - {{is thought to be}} a precursor marker of HGSC. TP53-/- mice (in which the <b>TP53</b> gene has been deleted) do not develop ovarian carcinomas. However, <b>TP53</b> mutations were found in 96% of HGSC cases. A local abnormal <b>TP53</b> expression may thus be indicative of HGSC. In women, pelvic HGSC show either a complete absence of P53 expression, or overexpression, suggesting that any aberration of P53 leads to tumour development. Additionally, overexpression of <b>TP53</b> is associated with better clinical outcome whereas an absence of the p53 protein is linked to an increased risk of HGSC tumour recurrence.|$|E
50|$|Physical {{exercise}} increases {{levels of}} eustress, or good stress, on the body. This eustress stimulates epigenetic modifications affecting the DNA genome of cancer cells. Environmental conditions, such as eustress, strongly induces {{expression of the}} tumor suppressor <b>TP53</b> gene by influencing epigenetic modifications {{to be made to}} the cancer cells genome. The <b>TP53</b> gene codes for the p53 protein, a protein important in the apoptotic pathway of programmed cell death. The p53 protein is important for the regulation of cell growth and apoptosis, so hypermethylation of the <b>TP53</b> promoter region are common markers associated with the development of cancer. Other than methylation patterns affecting expression of <b>TP53,</b> microRNAs and antisense RNAs control the levels of the p53 protein by regulating expression of the p53 coding <b>TP53</b> gene.|$|E
50|$|Most human cancers are {{characterized}} by the inactivation of the tumor suppressor gene <b>TP53</b> that encodes p53, either by mutation or loss of the gene. Genomic deletion of 17p13.1 <b>TP53</b> locus also involves co-deletion of neighbouring genes such as POLR2A. POLR2A encodes the catalytic subunit of RNA POLII complex and is susceptible to inhibition by alpha-Amanitin. In colorectal cancer with hemizygous deletion of <b>TP53</b> and POLR2A, inhibition of POLR2A leads to a selective inhibition of proliferation of the cancer cells independent of p53. POLR2A inhibition in POLR2A intact cells exerts no significant effect on cell proliferation, survival and tumorigenicity, but the inhibition is dramatic on POLR2A hemizygous cells. This suggests that collateral and therapeutic vulnerability exposed by <b>TP53</b> and POLR2A hemizygous deletion in colorectal cancer can be exploited to treat <b>TP53</b> deleted colorectal cancers using POLR2A inhibitors.|$|E
50|$|If the <b>TP53</b> gene is damaged, tumor {{suppression}} {{is severely}} compromised. People who inherit only one functional {{copy of the}} <b>TP53</b> gene will most likely develop tumors in early adulthood, a disorder known as Li-Fraumeni syndrome.|$|E
50|$|This {{is called}} <b>TP53,</b> a protein that stops the cell cycle if {{reproduction}} occurs rapidly. But, most cancerous cells inactivate the protein <b>TP53</b> and continue dividing {{at a high}} rate causing mutations in the human body.|$|E

5000|$|Mutant Conditions: Mutations of <b>TP53</b> can inhibit {{its normal}} function, and allow cells with damaged DNA to {{continue}} to divide.
