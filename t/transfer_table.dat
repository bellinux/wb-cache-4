The <b>transfer</b> <b>table</b> and most of the bays are only 15 m long. So, when ALRV streetcars with a length of 23 m were introduced, an addition was built on the easternmost tracks with direct access from outdoors to allow the ALRV cars to drive through the old building crossing the <b>transfer</b> <b>table</b> into a longer wing on the northeast side of the building where they are maintained.|$|E

5000|$|Turnouts are {{far more}} complex when the rack is at or {{below the level of}} the running rails. Marsh's first rack patent shows such an arrangement, and the {{original}} Mount Washington Cog Railway he built had no turnouts. It was not until 1941 that a turnout was constructed on this line. [...] There were more turnouts built for the line but all were hand operated. In 2003, a new automatic hydraulic turnout was developed and built at the base as a prototype. With the success of the new turnout, more new automatic hydraulic turnouts were built to replace the hand-operated ones. The new turnouts installed on the Mount Washington line in 2007 are essentially <b>transfer</b> <b>tables.</b> The Locher rack also requires <b>transfer</b> <b>tables.</b>|$|R

40|$|International audienceResearchers {{and network}} {{operators}} often say that BGP <b>table</b> <b>transfers</b> are slow. Despite this common knowledge, {{the reasons for}} slow BGP transfers are not well understood. This paper explains BGP <b>table</b> <b>transfer</b> delays by combining BGP messages collected at a large VPN provider backbone and controlled experiments with routers of three different vendors {{as well as a}} software BGP speaker. Our results show that <b>table</b> <b>transfers</b> both in the provider network and in the controlled experiments contain gaps, i. e., periods in which both the sending and receiving routers are idle, but no BGP routes are exchanged. Gaps can represent more than 90 % of the <b>table</b> <b>transfer</b> time. Our analysis of a software router and discussions with router vendors indicate that gaps happen because of the timer-driven implementation of sending of BGP updates. Hence, gaps represent an undocumented design choice that gives preference to more controlled router load over faster <b>table</b> <b>transfers...</b>|$|R

The tramcar shed {{connected to the}} Apelstraße was used to store vehicles belonging to the track construction department. The depot was reopened as an operating division in 1927. After the new main workshop at Heiterblick was opened, the majority of workshop activity could be moved there. In order to simply depot access, the <b>transfer</b> <b>tables</b> were removed in October 1928 and the former workshop shed was connected directly to the Wittenberger Straße.

40|$|BGP routing updates {{collected}} by monitoring {{projects such as}} RouteViews and RIPE have been a vital source {{to our understanding of}} the global routing system. The updates logged by these monitoring projects are generated either by individual route changes,or are part of BGP <b>table</b> <b>transfer.</b> In particular,a session reset between a monitoring station and its BGP peers can result in the peer sending its entire BGP routing table to the monitoring station. In this paper, we present a Minimum Collection Time (MCT) algorithm that accurately identify the start and duration of routing <b>table</b> <b>transfers.</b> Using three months of data from 14 different peers,MCT can identify routing <b>table</b> <b>transfers</b> triggered by BGP session resets with 100 % accuracy,and can pinpoint the exact starting time of <b>table</b> <b>transfers</b> in 90 % of the cases...|$|R

50|$|The LESt {{opened this}} depot, {{near the town}} center, on 20 May 1896. At first it had two tramcar sheds with a {{workshop}} in between. This could be accessed only {{by means of a}} <b>transfer</b> <b>table.</b> All facilities were at first connected only to the Wittenberger Straße. A <b>transfer</b> <b>table</b> {{at the rear of the}} facility, connecting all the tramcar shed tracks, was opened on 20 August 1898. At the same time the depot was connected to the tracks in the Apelstraße, because an additional small workshop and an additional tramcar shed were built, which did not have exits to the Wittenberger Straße. An open-air storage yard was established at the corner of the Apelstraße and the Berliner Straße. This was accessible only by <b>transfer</b> <b>table.</b> Only in October 1909 was the first connecting track opened between the Apelstraße and the Wittenberger Straße.|$|E

40|$|One of the {{weaknesses}} of SNMP is its lack of an efficient mechanism for transferring large amounts of data, specifically large tables (for example a large routing table on a router). SNMP runs over UDP. While UDP (enhanced with an application layer retransmit mechanism) is sufficient for retrieving and setting single attributes, it is inefficient when used for <b>transferring</b> large <b>tables.</b> Efficiently <b>transferring</b> large <b>tables</b> requires employing a sliding window mechanism {{such as the one}} implemented by TCP. The goal of this project is to define and implement an efficient mechanism for <b>transferring</b> large SNMP <b>tables.</b> This shall be done by additional software components both on the agent side and on the client side. The requirements of the mechanism are: 1. Should enable the efficient transfer of any SNMP table supported by the agent. 2. The mechanism should be generic, i. e. any standard SNMP client (with the additional client side components) should be able to leverage the efficient transfer mechanism...|$|R
50|$|On {{the site}} of today's Lindenau motorbus depot, a tram depot and {{workshop}} was established in 1899. The latter had a notable characteristic: {{only one of the}} four tracks was connected to the tram network. The others were accessed by <b>transfer</b> <b>table.</b> Within a year, a power plant and an additional tramcar shed had already been built. A third tramcar shed, with <b>transfer</b> <b>table,</b> was built in 1907. Following construction of the new depots, the last tramcars working Line P were relocated to Probstheida Depot. The oldest tramcar shed was converted into a trackless workshop building. Nevertheless, in the same year, a new workshop building was opened, which tramcars could access only on transfer tables. In 1924, another workshop was established at Hinterfeld, with most of the tracks connected by a new <b>transfer</b> <b>table.</b> These complicated facilities as well as the ever-growing number of buses made a new solution urgently necessary.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} behavior tables, {{an extension}} of register <b>transfer</b> <b>tables,</b> {{as a basis for}} system representation for reasoning about control, datapath, protocol, and data abstraction facets of system synthesis. The novelty in our approach is that it unifies different aspects of system synthesis and alleviates the need to change bases to reason about different facets of a design. Behavior tables can model indirection in system specification, by allowing names of registers and states to be treated as values. Behavior tables provide an environment for transformational design to derive a formally "correct" implementation from a specification. The emphasis of our work is on design correctness rather than design automation. Herein, we develop implementation relations over different facets of behavior tables. A set of transformations on the different facets of behavior tables, that preserve the implementation relations on the facets, are presented. Behavior tables and the transfor [...] ...|$|R

The unloading of coal laden cars {{is carried out}} by two modern high-technology railcar rotary dumpers allowing the simultaneous discharge of four gondola cars in a maximum of 3 minutes. Therefore, the method excludes any mechanical damages possible during a grab discharge to the movable equipment of railway system. For {{the first time in}} Russia the traversers were used and have been successfully utilized for the prompt formation of empty rolling stock. With the help of these <b>transfer</b> <b>tables</b> it is possible to expedite railcar supply to several parallel tracks without additional railroad switches. The railcar thawing system equipped with infrared transmitters operate to ensure uninterrupted discharge of loaded cars in the winter season. After discharge the coal is transferred to the conveyor belt through the grid with cells of 280 mm diameter. After that, having come through the aspiration equipment, the coal is automatically transported through the system of conveyor lines, to one of four warehouses or directly to a ship, depending on the loading scheme. The loading to the ships is performed by two high-technology loading machines on two berths, which enable simultaneous handling of two Panamax vessels.|$|R
