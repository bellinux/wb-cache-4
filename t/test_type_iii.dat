40|$|Abstract: The major {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the effects of non-normality on Type III error rates for ANOVA F its three commonly recommended parametric counterparts namely Welch, Brown-Forsythe, and Alexander-Govern test. Therefore these tests were compared in terms of Type III error rates across the variety of population distributions, mean difference (effect size), and sample sizes. At the end of 100, 000 simulation trials it was observed that the Type III error rates for four tests were affected by the effect size (δ) and sample size, whereas Type III errors were not affected from distribution shapes. Results of the simulation also indicated that increases in sample size and population mean difference decreased Type III error, and increased statistical test power. Across the all distributions, sample sizes and population mean differences (δ), the Alexander-Govern test obtained higher estimates for power, lower estimates of Type III error (γ).

40|$|Abstract. Study {{about the}} {{performance}} of the service brakes and the retardation systems of commercial vehicles during the descending speed control on roads with long length steep inclination in Brazil. Mathematical models, based in the equations of the energy balance during the vehicle braking process are used. The thermal performance of the service braking system, of the engine cooling system, and of retarders, are verified for the established maximum safety speeds for a vehicle traveling downhill. The simulations are performed with programs elaborated in the Matlab-Simulink platform and with the vehicles as per the European norm ECE R 13 requirements (test type II A) and the Brazilian norm requirement (NBR 10967) for the downhill functional test (<b>test</b> <b>type</b> <b>III).</b> The obtained results show {{that it is possible to}} have a forecast of the dissipated power in the engine and the retarder, of the capacity of dissipated heat of the radiator, and other parameters to guarantee the effective speed control of the vehicle, as per the requirements of the norms, even before the road test are performed...|$|E

40|$|Recently, {{interests}} in 3 D indoor modeling and positioning have been growing. Data fusion by using different sensors data {{is one of}} the 3 D model producing methods. For a data fusion between two kinds of sensors, precise system calibration is essential. If relative geometric location of each sensor can be accurately measured with a system-calibration, it is possible to locate a pixel that corresponds to the same object in two different images, and thus, produce a more precise data-fusion. Purpose of this study is finding more efficient method of system calibration between optical and range sensor. For this purpose, experiment was designed by considering following variables, i) system calibration method, ii) <b>testbed</b> <b>type,</b> <b>iii)</b> and distance data(whether use it or not). So, In this study, test-bed for system calibration was designed by considering the characteristics of sensors. Also, precise simulation was done to find efficient method of system calibration, and its results were reflected in real experiment. Results of simulation show that the bundle adjustment method is more efficient than single photo resection in system calibration between range and optical sensors. And the most efficient case was when using i) the bundle adjustment with ii) the simulated data set which were obtained between 2 m to 4 m away from the test-bed. These results of simulation were reflected in real system calibration. Finally, real system calibration were performed and its results were compared to results of simulation. And accuracy of system calibration was evaluated by producing fusion data between range and optical sensors. 1. INTRODUCTUION...|$|R

Background Circulating biomarkers potentially {{may be used to}} improve patient selection for atrial fibrillation ablation. Low voltage areas in the left atrium predict arrhythmia recurrence when mapped in sinus rhythm. This study <b>tested</b> <b>type</b> <b>III</b> procollagen N terminal peptide (PIIINP), galectin- 3 (gal- 3), fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF- 23), and type I collagen C terminal telopeptide (ICTP), and whether low voltage areas in the left atrium predicted atrial fibrillation recurrence, irrespective of the rhythm during mapping. Methods 92 atrial fibrillation ablation patients were studied. Biomarker levels in peripheral and intra-cardiac blood were measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Low voltage (< 0. 5 mV) was expressed as a proportion of the mapped left atrial surface area. Follow-up was one year. The primary endpoint was recurrence of arrhythmia. The secondary endpoint was a composite of recurrence despite two procedures, or after one procedure if no second procedure was undertaken. Results The biomarkers were not predictive of either endpoint. After multivariate Cox regression analysis, high proportion of low voltage area in the left atrium was found to predict the primary endpoint in sinus rhythm mapping (hazard ratio 4. 323, 95 % confidence interval 1. 337 – 13. 982, p = 0. 014) and atrial fibrillation mapping (hazard ratio 5. 195, 95 % confidence interval 1. 032 – 26. 141, p = 0. 046).

Five disease-associated alleles (G 90 E, V 94 M, D 103 G, N 34 S and L 183 P) and three artificial alleles (Y 105 C, N 268 D, and M 284 K) were tested {{for their ability to}} alleviate galactose-induced growth arrest in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain which lacks endogenous UDP-galactose 4 ′-epimerase. For all of these alleles, except M 284 K, the ability to alleviate galactose sensitivity was correlated with the UDP-galactose 4 ′-epimerase activity detected in cell extracts. The M 284 K allele, however, was able to substantially alleviate galactose sensitivity, but demonstrated near-zero activity in cell extracts. Recombinant expression of the corresponding protein in Escherichia coli resulted in a protein with reduced enzymatic activity and reduced stability towards denaturants in vitro. This lack of stability may result from the introduction of an unpaired positive charge into a bundle of three α-helices near the surface of the protein. The disparities between the in vivo and in vitro data for M 284 K-hGALE further suggest that there are additional, stabilising factors present in the cell.

40|$|Allergic fungal {{sinusitis}} (AFS), {{also referred to}} as allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (AFRS), is a noninvasive, eosinophilic form of recurrent chronic allergic hypertrophic rhinosinusitis. AFS has distinct clinical, histopathological, and prognostic findings that differentiate it from other forms of sinusitis. The core pathogenesis and optimum treatment strategies remain debated. Concerns surround the use of immunotherapy for AFS because allergen-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) induced by immunotherapy could theoretically incite a Gell and Coombs <b>type</b> <b>III</b> (complex mediated) reaction. Type I hypersensitivity is established by high serum levels of allergen-specific IgE to various fungal antigens and positive Bipolaris skin <b>test</b> results. <b>Type</b> <b>III</b> hypersensitivity is established by an IgG-mediated process defined by the presence of allergen-specific IgG that forms complexes with fungal antigen inducing an immunologic inflammatory response.

Knowing the serologically positive patients among the clinically negatives ones is important if a second collagen injection should be planned. In these cases, skin and blood tests have to be carefully checked to confirm reactivity. In connection with this, we have developed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for determining the response to GAX collagen injections.

Very {{little is known about the}} genetic makeup of the organism, especially with regard to the factors that contribute to its pathogenicity. Generally, bacterial pathogens directly inject the effector proteins into host cells via <b>Type</b> <b>III</b> secretion system (T 3 SS). In the attempts to identify and characterize the T 3 secreted effectors, different reporter plasmid systems have been used to study the secretion and translocation mechanisms the effectors employ during pathogenicity. The aim of the study was to generate a T 3 reporter plasmid system for X. ampelinus that will allow the identification and classification of potential pathogenicity factors as members of the <b>Type</b> <b>III</b> secretion class of effectors. First, the avrBs 1 family genes avrBs 1 and avrA were identified and characterized. The two avirulence genes induced HR on Nicotiana tabacum leaves. Due to the relatedness of the X. ampelinus avr sequences to those of xanthomonads, and the fact that Xanthomonas avrBs 1 has been successfully used in a number T 3 effector studies, it was decided to construct an X. ampelinus T 3 effector reporter vector based on the avrBs 1 gene. The minimal segment of the X. ampelinus AvrBs 1 protein C-terminus, sufficient for recognition inside host cells and also responsible for HR-induction was identified and characterized using Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression. The AvrBs 157 - 413 HR-inducing domain was cloned in-frame with the 3 x FLAG epitope, into a broad-host range vector. To test the reporter vector, the full length avrBs 1 sequences of X. ampelinus and Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris were cloned ahead of the 3 x FLAG epitope and the constructs were transferred into XaΔavrBs 1 knockout mutant to test for protein secretion. Furthermore, the reporter construct was <b>tested</b> for <b>Type</b> <b>III</b> protein translocation on Bs 1 resistant pepper cultivar STAR 6657.

Measurements of the thermal hysteresis were performed by applying ultrasound to initiate the crystallization process of the antifreeze protein solution. This ultrasound technique also allows a crystallization process to be performed at defined temperature.

A hallmark of all <b>type</b> <b>III</b> secretion systems studied to date is that expression of one or more of their components is induced upon cell contact. It has been proposed that this induction is controlled by a negative regulator that is itself secreted by means of the <b>type</b> <b>III</b> secretion machinery. Although candidate proteins for this negative regulator have been proposed in a number of systems, for the most part, a direct demonstration of their role in regulation is lacking. Here, we report the discovery of ExsE, a negative regulator of <b>type</b> <b>III</b> secretion gene expression in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Deletion of exsE deregulates expression of the <b>type</b> <b>III</b> secretion genes. We provide evidence that ExsE is itself secreted by means of the <b>type</b> <b>III</b> secretion machinery and physically interacts with ExsC, a positive regulator of the <b>type</b> <b>III</b> secretion regulon. Taken together, these data demonstrate that ExsE is the secreted negative regulator that couples triggering of the <b>type</b> <b>III</b> secretion machinery to induction of the <b>type</b> <b>III</b> secretion genes...|$|R
40|$|Simultaneous {{occurrences of}} <b>type</b> <b>III</b> solar radio bursts and auroral kilometric {{radiation}} were observed by Calvert (1981) using ISEE 1 spectrograms. Calvert presented {{evidence suggesting that}} the incoming <b>type</b> <b>III</b> burst stimulates the onset of auroral kilometric radiation (AKR). This paper presents a statistical study of the correlation between <b>type</b> <b>III</b> bursts and auroral kilometric radiation. A superposed epoch analysis was performed on as many as 186 <b>type</b> <b>III</b> events. The <b>type</b> <b>III</b> bursts were detected by the ISEE 3 spacecraft on the sunward side of the earth. At {{the same time the}} IMP 8 spacecraft was used to detect onsets of kilometric radiation on the nightside of the earth. For each event the intensities measured by ISEE 3 (<b>type</b> <b>III</b> intensities) were subtracted from the intensities measured by IMP 8 (<b>type</b> <b>III</b> and possible AKR intensities). The resulting intensities for each event were then added to determine if kilometric radiation was preferentially observed following a <b>type</b> <b>III</b> burst. This analysis was performed at frequencies of 100, 178, and 500 kHz. The results of this study show that a statistically significant correlation exists between incoming <b>type</b> <b>III</b> bursts from the sun and kilometric radiation from the earth...|$|R
40|$|<b>Type</b> <b>III</b> {{interferon}} (IFN) {{is a novel}} {{member of}} the interferon family. <b>Type</b> <b>III</b> IFN utilizes a receptor complex {{different from that of}} type I IFN, but both types of IFN induce STAT 1, STAT 2, and STAT 3 activation. Here we describe a detailed comparison of signal transduction initiated by type I and <b>type</b> <b>III</b> IFN. Gene expression array analysis showed that IFN <b>types</b> I and <b>III</b> induced a similar subset of genes. In particular, no genes were induced uniquely by <b>type</b> <b>III</b> IFN. Next, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis to investigate the promoter activation by <b>types</b> I and <b>III</b> IFN. The ChIP assays demonstrated that stimulation of cells with both type I and <b>type</b> <b>III</b> IFN resulted in the recruitment of ISGF 3 transcription factor components to the promoter region of responsive genes and in an increase of polymerase II loading and histone acetylation. Whereas IFN type I signaling was observed for a broad spectrum of cell lines, <b>type</b> <b>III</b> IFN signaling was more restricted. The lack of IFN <b>type</b> <b>III</b> signaling was correlated with a low expression of the IL 28 Ra component of the IFN <b>type</b> <b>III</b> receptor, and IL 28 Ra overexpression was sufficient to restore IFN <b>type</b> <b>III</b> signaling. We also tested the activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases by <b>type</b> <b>III</b> IFN and found that <b>type</b> <b>III</b> IFN relies strongly upon both p 38 and JNK MAP kinases for gene induction. Type I interferons (IFNs) are expressed as a first line of defense against viral infections. The primary role of type I IF...|$|R
40|$|Pseudomonas syringae strains deliver {{variable}} {{numbers of}} <b>type</b> <b>III</b> effector proteins into plant cells during infection. These proteins {{are required for}} virulence, because strains incapable of delivering them are nonpathogenic. We implemented a whole-genome, high-throughput screen for identifying P. syringae <b>type</b> <b>III</b> effector genes. The screen relied on FACS and an arabinose-inducible hrpL σ factor to automate the identification and cloning of HrpL-regulated genes. We determined whether candidate genes encode <b>type</b> <b>III</b> effector proteins by creating and testing full-length protein fusions to a reporter called Δ 79 AvrRpt 2 that, when fused to known <b>type</b> <b>III</b> effector proteins, is translocated and elicits a hypersensitive response in leaves of Arabidopsis thaliana expressing the RPS 2 plant disease resistance protein. Δ 79 AvrRpt 2 is thus a marker for <b>type</b> <b>III</b> secretion system-dependent translocation, the most critical criterion for defining <b>type</b> <b>III</b> effector proteins. We describe our screen and the collection of <b>type</b> <b>III</b> effector proteins from two pathovars of P. syringae. This stringent functional criteria defined 29 <b>type</b> <b>III</b> proteins from P. syringae pv. tomato, and 19 from P. syringae pv. phaseolicola race 6. Our data provide full functional annotation of the hrpL-dependent <b>type</b> <b>III</b> effector suites from two sequenced P. syringae pathovars and show that <b>type</b> <b>III</b> effector protein suites are highly variable in this pathogen, presumably reflecting the evolutionary selection imposed by the various host plants...|$|R
40|$|Yersinia <b>type</b> <b>III</b> {{machines}} secrete protein substrates {{across the}} bacterial envelope. Secretion signals of some substrates have been identified; however, the mechanisms whereby these signals interact with <b>type</b> <b>III</b> machines are not known. Here {{we show that}} fusion of YopR, an early secretion substrate, to the N terminus of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) or other tightly folded proteins generates impassable hybrids that cannot travel the <b>type</b> <b>III</b> pathway. YopR hybrids capture YscN, the ATPase that provides energy for <b>type</b> <b>III</b> transport reactions, in the bacterial cytoplasm. Eleven N-terminal residues function as the YopR secretion signal, which is required for both binding to YscN and blocking the <b>type</b> <b>III</b> pathway. When expressed during <b>type</b> <b>III</b> machine assembly, YopR-DHFR blocks all secretion. Delayed expression of YopR-DHFR, when yersiniae have already engaged the <b>type</b> <b>III</b> pathway, blocks secretion of early (YscP) but not of late (effector Yops) substrates. These observations support a model whereby <b>type</b> <b>III</b> machines are programmed to secrete a sequence of proteins that can be disrupted when an impassable early substrate interacts with the YscN ATPase and blocks the transport of late substrates...|$|R

The link between both emissions {{has been investigated}} in many previous studies, but no statistical studies have compared both coronal and interplanetary <b>type</b> <b>III</b> bursts with X-ray flares. Aims. Using events where the coronal radio emission above 100 MHz is exclusively from <b>type</b> <b>III</b> bursts, we revisited some long-standing questions regarding the relation between <b>type</b> <b>III</b> bursts and X-ray flares: Do all coronal <b>type</b> <b>III</b> bursts have X-ray counter-parts? What correlation, if any, occurs between radio and X-ray intensities? What X-ray and radio signatures above 100 MHz occur in connection with interplanetary <b>type</b> <b>III</b> bursts below 14 MHz? Methods. We analysed ten years of data from 2002 to 2011 starting with a selection of coronal <b>type</b> <b>III</b> bursts above 100 MHz. We used X-ray flare information from RHESSI > 6 keV to {{make a list of}} 321 events that have associated <b>type</b> <b>III</b> bursts and X-ray flares, encompassing at least 28 % of the initial sample of <b>type</b> <b>III</b> events. We then examined the timings, intensities, associated GOES class, and whether there was an associated interplanetary radio signature in both radio and X-rays. Results. For our 321 events with radio and X-ray signatures, the X-ray emission at 6 keV usually lasted much longer than the groups of <b>type</b> <b>III</b> bursts at frequencies > 100 MHz. The selected events were mostly associated with GOES B and C class flares. A weak correlation was found between the <b>type</b> <b>III</b> radio flux at frequencies below 327 MHz and the X-ray intensity at 25 – 50 keV, with an absence of events at high X-ray intensity and low <b>type</b> <b>III</b> radio flux. The weakness of the correlation is related to the coherent emission mechanism of radio <b>type</b> <b>IIIs</b> which can produce high radio fluxes by low density electron beams. Interplanetary <b>type</b> <b>III</b> bursts (10 3 SFU), relating to electron beams with more energetic electrons above 25 keV and events where magnetic flux tubes extend into the high corona. We also find that whilst on average <b>type</b> <b>III</b> bursts increase in flux with decreasing frequency, the rate of this increase varies from event to event...|$|R
40|$|It {{has proved}} {{possible}} to transform an extreme rough variant of pneumococcus {{back to the}} rough state {{by the action of}} the desoxyribonucleate fractions of either rough or <b>Type</b> <b>III</b> smooth pneumococci. In a second step, the rough pneumococci produced by this transformation were further changed to the <b>Type</b> <b>III</b> smooth state by means of the desoxyribonucleate fraction of <b>Type</b> <b>III</b> smooth organisms. With use of the <b>Type</b> <b>III</b> desoxyribonucleate, the two steps could be accomplished successively, but not simultaneously, during the growth of a single inoculum of the extreme rough form. These findings have been interpreted as indicating that the desoxyribonucleic acid fraction of <b>Type</b> <b>III</b> smooth pneumococci contains two transforming principles of differing specificity, while the same fraction of rough pneumococci contains but one of these principles. Two distinct spontaneous variants of <b>Type</b> <b>III</b> smooth pneumococci have been isolated which seem to differ from normal <b>Type</b> <b>III</b> smooth pneumococci in synthesizing smaller amounts of the specific polysaccharide. Tests have indicated that these variant <b>Type</b> <b>III</b> races differ from the normal in possessing altered <b>Type</b> <b>III</b> transforming principles. Each of the new transforming agents when influencing rough bacteria, is strictly specific in its action, inducing as it does the formation of the corresponding variant <b>Type</b> <b>III</b> pneumococci. Interaction between the two new transforming principles and rough pneumococci can lead to the production of normal <b>Type</b> <b>III</b> organisms, although neither principle alone can do it. This is interpreted as indicating that the two mutated <b>Type</b> <b>III</b> transforming principles are qualitatively different from each other. Another kind of two-step transformation was accomplished by converting rough pneumococci first into the variant <b>Type</b> <b>III</b> pneumococci which produced very little specific polysaccharide, and then by transforming these latter into normal <b>Type</b> <b>III</b> organisms. After the two-step transformation of the extreme rough pneumococcus, both transforming principles used to effect this can be recognized in the <b>Type</b> <b>III</b> smooth pneumococci finally recovered. By contrast, in the two-step transformation of the rough pneumococcus by way of an intermediate smooth form, only the second transforming principle can be obtained from the resulting fully smooth organisms. The meaning of these facts is discussed...|$|R

Methods : the aminoterminal propeptide (PIIINP) and telopeptide (IIINTP) of <b>type</b> <b>III</b> procollagen and collagen, respectively, were immunologically measured in the soluble and insoluble fractions of the extracellular matrix. The assay for PIIINP in the insoluble matrix was further validated. Results: the insoluble matrices of AAAs contained at least 12 times more incompletely processed <b>type</b> <b>III</b> pN-collagen than AOD specimens (0. 74 % and 0. 061 %, respectively). Also, the soluble extracts of AAAs tended to contain more non-processed <b>type</b> <b>III</b> pN-collagen than free, properly cleaved aminoterminal propeptide. Conclusions: the larger amount of <b>type</b> <b>III</b> pN-collagen suggests an alteration in the metabolism of <b>type</b> <b>III</b> collagen in AAAs. This may partially explain the decreased tensile strength of the aortic tissue...|$|R
40|$|SummaryThe {{signals that}} {{determine}} whether axons are ensheathed or myelinated by Schwann cells {{have long been}} elusive. We now report that threshold levels of neuregulin- 1 (NRG 1) <b>type</b> <b>III</b> on axons determine their ensheathment fate. Ensheathed axons express low levels whereas myelinated fibers express high levels of NRG 1 <b>type</b> <b>III.</b> Sensory neurons from NRG 1 <b>type</b> <b>III</b> deficient mice are poorly ensheathed and fail to myelinate; lentiviral-mediated expression of NRG 1 <b>type</b> <b>III</b> rescues these defects. Expression also converts the normally unmyelinated axons of sympathetic neurons to myelination. Nerve fibers of mice haploinsufficient for NRG 1 <b>type</b> <b>III</b> are disproportionately unmyelinated, aberrantly ensheathed, and hypomyelinated, with reduced conduction velocities. <b>Type</b> <b>III</b> is the sole NRG 1 isoform retained at the axon surface and activates PI 3 -kinase, which is required for Schwann cell myelination. These results indicate that levels of NRG 1 <b>type</b> <b>III,</b> independent of axon diameter, provide a key instructive signal that determines the ensheathment fate of axons...|$|R
