Instead, she used her lectures as a spontaneous discussion time with her students, <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>through</b> and clarify important cutting-edge problems in mathematics. Some of her most important results were developed in these lectures, and the lecture notes of her students {{formed the basis for}} several important textbooks, such as those of van der Waerden and Deuring.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the many}} values of {{dialogue}} journals is the opportunity {{for the teacher to}} provide informal counseling in a non-threatening, private context for individual students on their challenges and problems, whether about instructional or personal concerns. This use is closest to the goal and practice of Mrs. Reed, the original 6th grade teacher who had taken training with Dr. William Glasser on Reality Therapy for classroom teachers. The training led her to use the private written conversations to model the pragmatic, problem-solving perspective of Reality Therapy and to encourage students <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>through</b> issues and problems with her guidance. Of her writing with the students, she said, “I cannot think of any better way to learn so much about my students, myself, and my own teaching”.|$|E
25|$|Gerbert {{learned of}} Hindu–Arabic digits and applied this {{knowledge}} to the abacus, but probably without the numeral zero. According to the 12th-century historian William of Malmesbury, Gerbert got {{the idea of the}} computing device of the abacus from a Spanish Arab. The abacus that Gerbert reintroduced into Europe had its length divided into 27 parts with 9 number symbols (this would exclude zero, which was represented by an empty column) and 1,000 characters in all, crafted out of animal horn by a shieldmaker of Rheims. According to his pupil Richer, Gerbert could perform speedy calculations with his abacus that were extremely difficult for people in his day <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>through</b> in using only Roman numerals. Due to Gerbert's reintroduction, the abacus became widely used in Europe once again during the 11th century.|$|E

500|$|Nordby spent a {{significant}} amount of time shooting [...] "the articulating jaw" [...] scene because they had [...] "ultimate control over how the light was hitting the head". He said, [...] "This so-called jaw shot became a pivotal point, because for four months of the post, the filmmakers thought the film was getting too scary so MPC pulled back on the jaw and then they thought it wasn't scary enough." [...] Because of this, [...] "they pushed back and this jaw went back and forth quite a bit to help navigate where they wanted the tone on any given day". These different poses helped the two teams perfect the jaw scenes. [...] "From a marketing point of view, from all the test screenings they did", said Norby, [...] "there was a lot of work figuring out how to make this a scary film as well as a funny film." [...] Since the team was on a small budget, they [...] "relied more on skilled artists <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>through</b> shots rather than a brute force approach".|$|E
500|$|In 2003, The Portopia Serial Murder Incident ranked 19th {{in a poll}} to {{determine}} the thirty best Famicom games; the poll was conducted by the Tokyo Metropolitan Museum of Photography {{as part of its}} [...] "Level X" [...] exhibition. The English-language webzine Retrogaming Times Monthly compared the game to the later-released Shadowgate where the player must examine and collect objects and find their true purpose later on, and recommended Portopia to fans of [...] "slower paced games that require [...] <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>through</b> puzzles". John Szczepaniak praised its pacing and quality of writing, and considers the gameplay and plot to be sophisticated for its time. He noted that it contains elements found in a number of later titles, including Déjà Vu, Snatcher, , and Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors. 1UP also noted that Portopia is similar to ICOM Simulations' Déjà Vu released several years later. Nintendo's successful [...] series of adventure games were also inspired by Portopia. USgamer compared it to the later Police Quest adventure games and CSI television series, as well as classic Sherlock Holmes novels. According to Official Xbox Magazine, Portopias features, such as point-and-click, murder mystery plot, open world, suspect interrogations, nonlinear gameplay, dialogue choices, and alternate endings, are [...] "standard for 2015, but way ahead of its time in 1983", comparing it to L.A. Noire. Peter Tieryas gave Portopia a positive retrospective review, stating that, while its [...] "influence is undeniable, it's the tragic back story, the strange vicissitudes the characters face, the uncanny freedom to investigate, and the haunting uncovering of the killer that makes it so special." ...|$|E

2500|$|Prestige {{of colleges}} {{correlates}} with age, {{such that the}} oldest east-coast schools tend to have accumulated the most prestige {{by virtue of their}} longevity. There is widespread consensus that the fit between a student and a school is an important factor. Several reports suggest that [...] "fit should trump prestige every single time," [...] and that it is better for a school to match a student in terms of social, cultural, and academic qualities and not be chosen simply because of a school's prestige. Others see college admissions as essentially a choice between [...] "price and prestige". Elite colleges have been compared to designer labels, a valuable credential in the job market, and an entryway into top graduate schools. Some advisors specialize in helping students find a good fit—a suitable list of colleges—which helps students in the long run. They help students to explore their values and needs, and provide counseling to help both students and parents find a college or university program that helps students meet long-term goals. Questions include thinking about life goals, which activities a person likes best, and what style of learning works best for the student. Evaluating personal preferences is important and can take time. One advisor suggests it is important for a student <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>through</b> what is best, and choose on this basis, and [...] "do not listen to your friends" [...] since they have different needs and wants. [...] "One of the worst ways {{to make a decision about}} where to go to college is to follow a friend because he or she is having a good time at that school," [...] wrote one advisor.
