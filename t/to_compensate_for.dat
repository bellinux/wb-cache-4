50|$|With globalization, movie {{production}} has been clustered in Hollywood for several reasons: the United States {{has the largest}} single home market in dollar terms, entertaining and highly visible Hollywood movies have global appeal, {{and the role of}} English as a universal language contributes <b>to</b> <b>compensating</b> <b>for</b> higher fixed costs of production.|$|R

5|$|Nocturnal {{migrants}} minimize predation, avoid overheating, and {{can feed}} during the day. One cost of nocturnal migration {{is the loss}} of sleep. Migrants may be able to alter their quality of sleep <b>to</b> <b>compensate</b> <b>for</b> the loss.|$|E

50|$|In Canada, Stabilization {{payments}} are budgetary payments made <b>to</b> <b>compensate</b> Canadian farmers <b>for</b> falling farm prices and/or incomes.

30|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>compensating</b> <b>for</b> {{the dynamic}} {{nature of the}} field in the undersensing case, we would also like to eliminate any redundant sensing. Recall, that in the oversensing case, the field changes very slowly, yielding perfect reconstruction and detection.

5|$|A {{modified}} version of the standard MP 40 (sometimes erroneously called MP 40/II) with a dual side-by-side magazine holder (for a theoretical ammunition total of 64 rounds), designed for special operations troops on the Eastern Front <b>to</b> <b>compensate</b> <b>for</b> the enemies' PPSh-41 larger magazine capacity.

5|$|After the hurricane's passage, {{officials}} deployed the Florida National Guard to {{affected areas}} {{in order to}} maintain order and quell looting. Across Florida, a total of 3,897people filed damage claims after receiving damage from the hurricane, 80% of them in the Miami area. Insurance companies paid about $1million <b>to</b> <b>compensate</b> <b>for</b> the storm damage. Due to the loss in citrus crop, prices briefly increased, although they returned to normal levels by late October.|$|E

Highway412 opened alongside the extension of Highway407 (Highway407E) from Brock Road in Pickering to Harmony Road in Oshawa. The Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO) thus decided <b>to</b> <b>compensate</b> <b>for</b> delays by waiving all tolls until February 1, 2017.|$|E
50|$|In healthy individuals, REP1 {{is found}} {{throughout}} {{all of the}} cells of the body, however patients with choroideremia only experience vision loss, and not broader, systemic symptoms (with the exception of a study that found crystals and fatty acid abnormalities in leukocytes). REP2, a protein that is 75% identical and 90% similar to REP1, is able <b>to</b> significantly <b>compensate</b> <b>for</b> the loss of REP1 outside the eye. It is thought that REP2 is not able <b>to</b> fully <b>compensate</b> <b>for</b> the loss of REP1 in the retina. RAB27A, a Rab that has essential functions in the retina, {{has been shown to be}} preferentially prenylated by REP1. Additionally, the Rab27a-REP1 and Rab27a-REP2 complexes have different affinities for the Rab geranylgeranyltransferase enzyme, possibly explaining REP2's inability <b>to</b> fully <b>compensate</b> <b>for</b> REP1 in the retina.|$|R

5|$|Another nocturnal {{adaptation}} {{can be seen}} in kangaroo rats, which exhibit moonlight avoidance. These rodents forage {{in relatively}} open habitats and reduce their activity outside their nest burrows in response to moonlight. During a full moon, they shift their activity towards areas of relatively dense cover <b>to</b> <b>compensate</b> <b>for</b> the extra brightness. In controlled experiments, artificial moon-like illumination stimulates similar responses in their foraging behavior, suggesting that this behavior has evolved to reduce predation risk.|$|E
5|$|Horace Holly – protagonist and narrator, Holly is a Cambridge {{man whose}} keen intellect and {{knowledge}} was developed <b>to</b> <b>compensate</b> <b>for</b> his ape-like appearance.
