5|$|Scholars have {{suggested}} that oral traditions in general and poetry in particular was well placed to {{play a part in}} cultural resistance to apartheid. Music and poetry were more accessible to a large number of South Africans than written material (partly due to the restrictions placed by apartheid). Music, poetry, and storytelling also formed part of the everyday life of a number of South Africans, and protest songs emerged from these traditions. In addition, poetry was traditionally seen by some South Africans as a legitimate means of criticising authority, with poetic licence allowing artists <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>things</b> that would otherwise not be acceptable.|$|E
25|$|Australian actress Simone McAullay {{was cast}} as local hotelkeeper Becca Fisher, with whom Mark Latimer has an adulterous affair. Chibnall had long envisioned Becca as an Australian, {{which made her}} an {{outsider}} in the Broadchurch community. He also relied on the common assumption that Australians often seem bolder than most British, which gave the character license <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>things</b> others might not. McAullay received the first two scripts from her agent, and a short written sketch of the Dorset setting. She videotaped an audition {{at her home in}} Sydney, and sent it to Chibnall.|$|E

Two weeks into the live shows, a number of happy slapping videos of Emily Nakanda {{appeared in}} the media, apparently showing her beating another teenaged girl. On 17 November, Alisha Bennett was voted out of the competition, leaving Osbourne with no acts halfway through the competition.|$|E

500|$|At {{the time}} Allah jang Palsoe was written, stage {{performances}} were {{heavily influenced by}} orality. Contemporary theatres, such as bangsawan and stamboel, were unscripted and generally used fantastic settings and plotlines. Kwee Tek Hoay heavily disapproved of such whimsy, considering it [...] "better <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>things</b> as they are, than to create events out of nothing, which although perhaps more entertaining and satisfying to viewers or readers, are falsehoods and lies, going against the truth". After condemning contemporary playwrights who merely wrote down existing stories, Kwee Tek Hoay expressed the hope that ultimately a unique form of Chinese Malay theatre—inspired by European theatrical traditions but dealing with Chinese themes—could be developed. Allah jang Palsoe {{was intended to be}} the first published stage play in this new tradition.|$|E

[...] He was highly critical of contemporary writers who relied more on their fantasies than logic and truth. [...] Hoping to keep his story grounded in reality, Kwee researched {{the history of the}} Baduy, the geological formation of Krakatoa, and the events of 1883 and 1928; in total he consulted 15 books, all in English or Dutch. Writing began on 19 March 1928 and was completed on 28 May of that year. Drama dari Krakatau consists of sixteen chapters, which were spread over 125 pages in the first printing.|$|E
500|$|While {{recording}} for her thirteenth studio album, Madonna enlisted several collaborators; MoZella, Symbolyc One and Toby Gad {{were announced}} as new collaborators {{on the album}} in April 2014. Madonna posted {{a photograph of the}} trio working with her in a recording studio on her Instagram account. She said on the photograph, [...] "Having an Iconic Moment in the studio with Toby-Mozilla and S1. My throat hurts from singing, laughing and crying." [...] Gad worked with Madonna on fourteen songs, all of which appeared on the album. According to Gad, [...] "The first week she was quite intimidating. It was like a test phase. You have to criticize, but you can't really offend. But she also likes honest, harsh critics <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>things</b> as they are. It worked out really well and she got sweeter and sweeter." ...|$|E
500|$|Morris plays Brittany as [...] "literally insane", {{but also}} entirely well-meaning and goodhearted. She {{has said that}} Brittany [...] "love everybody, no matter who they are"; she is {{frequently}} smiling and being nice to people. Brittany's character traits include her finding recipes confusing, cheating off intellectually disabled classmates, thinking her cat, Lord Tubbington, is reading her diary, and not knowing her right hand from her left. These facts are often presented in one-liners delivered by Morris, many of which she has ad-libbed. Brittany's one-liners are regularly celebrated in reviews of Glee. The character's lack of intelligence and forthright manner of speaking means, as Morris puts it, that [...] "Brittany {{is used by the}} series' writers <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>things</b> no other character would". The character has also received positive reviews related to her romantic storyline with her closeted best friend Santana (Naya Rivera). While Brittany is bisexual, and is unashamed of that, Santana has trouble accepting her lesbianism. Brittany has continued to support Santana and urged her to be true to herself.|$|E

500|$|Docter {{noted that}} the film {{reflects}} his friendships with Disney veterans Frank Thomas, Ollie Johnston, and Joe Grant (who all died before the film's release and thus the film was dedicated to them). Grant gave the script his approval {{as well as some}} advice before his death in 2005. Docter recalled that Grant would remind him that the audience needed an [...] "emotional bedrock" [...] because of how wacky the adventure would become; here it is Carl mourning for his wife. Docter felt that Grant's personality influenced Carl's deceased wife Ellie more than the grouchy main character, and Carl was primarily based on Spencer Tracy, Walter Matthau, James Whitmore, and their own grandparents, because there was [...] "something sweet about these grumpy old guys". Docter and Jonas Rivera noted Carl's charming nature in spite of his grumpiness derives from the elderly [...] "hav this charm and almost this 'old man license' <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>things</b> that other people couldn't get away with [...] It's like how we would go to eat with Joe Grant and he would call the waitresses 'honey'. I wish I could call a waitress 'honey'." ...|$|E
500|$|During the {{recording}} process of Rebel Heart, Madonna enlisted several collaborators, including MoZella, Symbolyc One and Toby Gad. Madonna posted {{a photograph of}} the trio working with her in a recording studio on her Instagram account. She said on the photograph, [...] "Having an Iconic Moment in the studio with Toby-Mozilla and S1. My throat hurts from singing, laughing and crying." [...] Gad worked with Madonna on fourteen songs, twelve appeared on the album's multiple track lists, with one being [...] "Iconic". According to Gad, [...] "The first week she was quite intimidating. It was like a test phase. You have to criticize, but you can't really offend. But she also likes honest, harsh critics <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>things</b> as they are. It worked out really well and she got sweeter and sweeter." [...] For the track, she initially asked American rapper Jay Z to be featured on with verses about icons, however he called American rapper Chance the Rapper and said {{that it would be better}} if somebody that was a new person and that he thought that could be a new icon got on the record. Chance and Madonna had met before through American recording artist Frank Ocean in a concert and became friends, prompting the singer to accept Jay Z's suggestion.|$|E
500|$|Some of Brittany's {{most memorable}} lines are unscripted, and are instead devised by Murphy during filming, or improvised by Morris. Morris portrays Brittany as being [...] "literally insane." [...] She {{is used by}} the series' writers <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>things</b> no other {{character}} would, to the point that Morris considers some of her lines nonsensical. Brittany's character traits include her finding recipes confusing, cheating off intellectually disabled classmates, thinking her cat is reading her diary, and not knowing her right hand from her left. She is friendly towards all the other characters, and Morris has explained that Brittany [...] "love everybody, no matter who they are", so she is frequently smiling and being nice to people. Morris bases her portrayal of Brittany on the character Karen Smith from the film Mean Girls. She plays Brittany as being very innocent, rather than stupid. In the episode [...] "A Night of Neglect", Brittany participates in an academic decathlon as a seat warmer, but surprisingly ends up contributing to the win {{due to the fact that}} she is somewhat of an idiot savant on the topic of cat diseases. It is also revealed in [...] "Britney/Brittany" [...] that Brittany is also [...] "Britney Spears" [...] as her middle initial is [...] "S" [...] making her [...] "Brittany S. Pierce." ...|$|E

To avoid further leaks, Madonna released six completed tracks with the pre-order for the album on the iTunes Store on December 20, 2014, as an [...] "early Christmas gift". On February 9, 2015, the singer released three other finished tracks, including the final version of [...] "Joan of Arc", as well as the album's track list.|$|E
500|$|In 2009, before Rowland and Guetta collaborated for [...] "When Love Takes Over", {{the media}} {{reported}} that Columbia Records and Rowland were to part ways by mutual agreement.

After the release of [...] "When Love Takes Over" [...] she {{would go on to}} fire Matthew Knowles. It has since been suggested Rowland had fallen out with former fellow Destiny's Child singer Beyoncé Knowles. The media reported that Knowles' decision to release one more video ("Why Don't You Love Me") from her album I Am... Sasha Fierce just before Rowland released [...] "Commander" [...] was unfair on Rowland. These claims would be denied by the singer who said that despite the clip for [...] "Why Don't You Love Me" [...] airing several days before [...] "Commander", the media was [...] "making too much of a big deal of release schedules and trying to create a feud where it doesn't exist." [...] She also said, [...] "we all came out {{at the same time and}} it really doesn't matter... I think there's room for everybody... There's Bey, there's Ciara putting something out and [...] GaGa putting something out, but, because we started out together, people are going <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>things</b> like that.
