40|$|Noncentral {{distributions}} {{appear in}} two sample problems {{and are often}} used in several fields, for example, in biostatistics. A higher order approximation for a percentage point of the noncentral t-distribution under normality is given by Akahira (1995) and is also shown to be numerically better than others. In this article, without the normality assumption, we obtain a higher order approximation to a percentage point {{of the distribution of}} a noncentral t-statistic, in a similar way to Akahira (1995) where the statistic based on a linear combination of a normal random variable and a chi-statistic takes an important role. Its application to the confidence limit and the confidence interval for a noncentrality parameter are also given. Further, a numerical comparison of the higher order approximation with the limiting normal distribution is done and the former one is shown to be more accurate. As a result of the numerical calculation, the higher order approximation seems to be useful in practical situations, when the size of sample is not so small.

5|$|The first list {{fragment}} {{is followed}} by the canon <b>tables</b> of Eusebius of Caesarea. These <b>tables,</b> which predate the text of the Vulgate, were developed to cross-reference the Gospels. Eusebius divided the Gospel into chapters and then created <b>tables</b> that allowed readers to find where a given episode in the life of Christ was located in each of the Gospels. The canon <b>tables</b> were traditionally included in the prefatory material in most mediaeval copies of the Vulgate text of the Gospels. The <b>tables</b> in the Book of Kells, however, are almost unusable because the scribe condensed the <b>tables</b> {{in such a way as}} to make them confused. In addition, the corresponding chapter numbers were never inserted into the margins of the text, making it impossible to find the sections to which the canon <b>tables</b> refer. The reason for the omission remains unclear: the scribe may have planned to add the references upon the manuscript's completion, or he may have deliberately left them out so as not to spoil the appearance of pages.|$|E

5|$|The {{unity of}} the Gospels is further {{emphasised}} by the decoration of the Eusebian canon <b>tables.</b> The canon <b>tables</b> themselves inherently illustrate the {{unity of the}} Gospels by organising corresponding passages from the Gospels. The Eusebian canon <b>tables</b> normally require twelve pages. In the Book of Kells, the makers of the manuscript planned for twelve pages (folios 1v through 7r) but for unknown reasons, condensed them into ten, leaving folios 6v and 7r blank. This condensation rendered the canon <b>tables</b> unusable. The decoration of the first eight pages of the canon <b>tables</b> is heavily influenced by early Gospel Books from the Mediterranean, where it was traditional to enclose the <b>tables</b> within an arcade (as seen in the London Canon <b>Tables).</b> The Kells manuscript presents this motif in an Insular spirit, where the arcades are not seen as architectural elements but rather become stylised geometric patterns with Insular ornamentation. The four evangelist symbols occupy the spaces under and above the arches. The last two canon <b>tables</b> are presented within a grid. This presentation is limited to Insular manuscripts and was first seen in the Book of Durrow.|$|E
