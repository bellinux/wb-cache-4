5|$|The main {{intention}} of the tour was to transform Madonna's old hits musically and display her capacity for transformation and self-reflection. The tour was initially known as <b>the</b> <b>Whore</b> of Babylon World Tour, although Madonna later denied using this name. The idea was to portray Madonna as <b>the</b> <b>Whore</b> of Babylon, the figure of evil as mentioned in the Book of Revelation. However it was later changed to the Re-Invention World Tour, {{to make it a}} self-confident dig at all the critics and people who have expressed their views about Madonna re-inventing her image over the years. The official tour poster displayed Madonna in a vintage bolero gown and a large French Renaissance-like hair-bun. Air-conditioning was turned off during the tour on Madonna's request as she claimed it dried up her throat during singing.|$|E

25|$|The Damned {{are taken}} to Hell and {{received}} by Demons is {{in stark contrast to}} the previous one. Signorelli has gone to the extremes of his fantasy and evocative powers to portray his cataclysmic vision of the horrible fate, the agony and the despair of the damned. He uses the naked human body as his only expressive element, showing the isolated bodies entangling each other, merging in a convoluted mass. They are overpowered by demons in near-human form, depicted in colours of every shade of decomposing flesh. Above them, a flying demon transports a woman. This is probably a depiction of <b>the</b> <b>Whore</b> of the Apocalypse.|$|E
25|$|Anti-Catholicism in United States is {{historically}} {{deeply rooted in}} the anti-Catholic attitudes of Protestants in Great Britain and Germany after the Reformation. Immigrants brought that hostility with them to the American colonies. Two types of anti-Catholic rhetoric existed in colonial society and continued into the following centuries. The first, derived from the theological heritage of the Protestant Reformation and the religious wars of the sixteenth century, consisted of the Biblical Anti-Christ and <b>the</b> <b>Whore</b> of Babylon variety and dominated anti-Catholic thought until the late seventeenth century. The second type was a secular variety which derived in part from xenophobic and ethnocentric Nativist sentiments and distrust towards increasing waves of Catholic immigrants, particularly from Ireland, Italy and non-Northwestern European countries, and often focused on the alleged intrigues of Catholic states or Catholic peoples against the majority Protestant United States.|$|E

500|$|Erlewine {{commented that}} the [...] "Steven Meisel-shot cover... was as key to her reinvention as {{the music of the}} album itself." [...] William McKeen, author of Rock and roll is here to stay: an anthology, felt that the image was another trigger and {{testament}} to the fact that Madonna was the last word on fashion for women and young girls of that era, the epitome of cool. Costume designer Arianne Phillips commented of the Like a Virgin look: [...] "This {{was one of the most}} shocking, liberating and influential moments in pop culture/fashion history... Fashion has never been the same." [...] Madonna herself declared: [...] "I have always loved to play cat and mouse with the conventional stereotypes. My Like a Virgin album cover is a classic example. People were thinking who was I pretending to be—the Virgin Mary or <b>the</b> <b>whore?</b> These were the two extreme images of women I had known vividly, and remembered from childhood, and I wanted to play with them. I wanted to see if I can merge them together, Virgin Mary and <b>the</b> <b>whore</b> as one and all. The photo was a statement of independence, if you wanna be a virgin, you are welcome. But if you wanna be a whore, it's your fucking right to be so." ...|$|E
500|$|The Puritan {{leaders of}} the Massachusetts Bay Colony gloated over Hutchinson's {{suffering}} and also that of Mary Dyer, a follower who suffered the premature and stillbirth of a severely deformed infant. The leaders classified the women's misfortunes as the judgement of God. [...] Winthrop wrote, [...] "She brought forth not one, but thirty monstrous births or thereabouts", then continued, [...] "see how the wisdom of God fitted this judgment to her sin every way, for look—as she had vented misshapen opinions, so she must bring forth deformed monsters." [...] Massachusetts continued to persecute Hutchinson's followers who stayed in the Boston area. Laymen were sent from the Boston church to Portsmouth to convince Hutchinson of her errors; she shouted at them, [...] "the Church at Boston? I know no such church, neither will I own it. Call it <b>the</b> <b>whore</b> and strumpet of Boston, but no Church of Christ!" ...|$|E
500|$|In [...] "Abandon All Hope...", Castiel {{helps the}} Winchesters {{retrieve}} the Colt, and joins {{them on their}} hunt for Lucifer. However, he ventures off after discovering hundreds of Reapers {{are already in the}} town, hoping to discover what has called them there. He soon becomes imprisoned by Lucifer, who tries to tempt Castiel into joining him, pointing out they are both targets of Heaven, but Castiel refuses. He later manages to free himself, but finds he no longer has the power to kill demons. After Sam and Dean fail in their attempt to kill the Devil, Castiel teleports them to safety. After exhausting most of his remaining power to take Sam and Dean back in time to save their parents from renegade angel Anna, Castiel aids the Winchesters in their battle with Famine, the Horseman of the Apocalypse – the brothers having already defeated War – but his weakened powers render him susceptible to Famine's influence, Famine attacking Jimmy's hunger for red meat to make Castiel more interested in eating burgers than actually fighting. When the brothers are killed by vengeful hunters in [...] "Dark Side of the Moon", Castiel – unable to return to Heaven – briefly communicates with them. He tasks them with finding the angel Joshua, who communicates directly with God. Although Joshua reveals God is alive, he claims He is apathetic to the Apocalypse; having saved the brothers and Castiel, God feels He has done enough. When relayed to Castiel, his hopes and faith are shattered, leading him to drink heavily in the subsequent episode [...] "99 Problems" [...] when Sam summons him for answers about the actions of the people in a town. Castiel reveals that they are dealing with <b>the</b> <b>Whore</b> of Babylon and provides the stake that can kill her, but as he is no longer a true servant of Heaven, is unable to do it himself. He gets Pastor Gideon so they can have him do it and tries to hold <b>the</b> <b>Whore</b> in place so the Pastor can stab her. However, she casts a spell that causes him great pain and knocks him out of the fight. In the end, Dean stabs her with the stake, identifying himself as a true servant of heaven.|$|E

500|$|Many theorists, {{including}} Jacqueline Doyle, Jean Wyatt, Emma Perez and Cordelia Candelaria, {{have argued}} that the gender identity of Mexican and Chicana women is complexly constructed in reference to these three figures. La Virgen de Guadalupe, a Catholic icon of the manifestation of the Virgin Mary in the Americas, is revered in Mexico as a [...] "nurturing and inspiring mother and maiden". La Malinche, the indigenous mistress and intermediary of conquistador Hernán Cortés, has according to Wyatt [...] "become the representative of a female sexuality at once passive, [...] "rapeable," [...] and always already guilty of betrayal". Cisneros describes the problematic dichotomy of the virgin and <b>the</b> <b>whore</b> presented by these two figures: [...] "We’re raised in a Mexican culture that has two role models: La Malinche and la Virgen de Guadalupe. And you know that’s a hard route to go, one or the other, there’s no in-betweens." [...] Madsen has noted that these 'good' and 'bad' archetypes are further complicated by the perception, held by many Chicana feminists, that they would be guilty of betraying their people, like La Malinche, if they attempt to define their femininity in more [...] "Anglo" [...] terms. Through her work, Cisneros critiques the pressures Chicanas face to suppress their sexuality or channel it into socially acceptable forms so as to not be labeled [...] "Malinchista...corrupted by gringa influences which threaten to splinter [...] people".|$|E
500|$|In 1968, Cardinale {{featured}} opposite Franco Nero in The Day of the Owl, in a David di Donatello for Best Actress-winning performance. She {{reunited with}} Rock Hudson in the Italian-made criminal comedy A Fine Pair under director Francesco Maselli. She also appeared alongside Rod Taylor in The Hell with Heroes {{and starred in}} one of her best-known roles as former prostitute Jill McBain in Sergio Leone's epic Western Once Upon a Time in the West. Such was the power of her performance as <b>the</b> <b>whore</b> that Leone's biographer Robert C. Cumbow described her as [...] "permanently engraved in cinematic history" [...] and noted how suited to the role she was: [...] "Her sex-goddess appearance combines with her more mystical iconographic associations to ease the progress of Jill from tart to town builder, from harlot to earth mother, from sinner to symbol of America—the apotheosis of the harlot with a heart of gold". In 1969, Cardinale starred opposite Nino Manfredi in Luigi Magni's Nell'anno del Signore, based on the actual story of the capital execution of two carbonari in papal Rome. This was followed by a role as a telephone operator in Certo certissimo ... anzi probabile, and as a nurse opposite Sean Connery and Peter Finch in Mikhail Kalatozov's The Red Tent, based on the story of the mission to rescue Umberto Nobile and the other survivors of the crash of the Airship Italia.|$|E
500|$|Both {{during his}} life and after it, Crowley has been widely {{described}} as a Satanist, usually by detractors. Crowley stated he did not consider himself a Satanist, nor did he worship Satan, as he did not accept the Christian world view in which Satan was believed to exist. He nevertheless used Satanic imagery, for instance by describing himself as [...] "the Beast 666" [...] and referring to <b>the</b> <b>Whore</b> of Babylon in his work, while in later life he sent [...] "Antichristmas cards" [...] to his friends. In his writings, Crowley occasionally identified Aiwass as Satan and designated him as [...] "Our Lord God the Devil" [...] at one occasion. The scholar of religion Gordan Djurdjevic stated that Crowley [...] "was emphatically not" [...] a Satanist, [...] "if {{for no other reason}} than simply because he did not identify himself as such". Crowley nevertheless expressed anti-Christian sentiment, stating that he hated Christianity [...] "as Socialists hate soap", an animosity likely stemming from his experiences among the Plymouth Brethren. He was also accused of advocating human sacrifice, largely because of a passage in Book 4 in which he stated that [...] "A male child of perfect innocence and high intelligence is the most satisfactory victim" [...] and added that he had sacrificed about 150 every year. This was a tongue-in-cheek reference to ejaculation, something not realised by his critics, thus reflecting their own [...] "ignorance and prejudice" [...] toward Crowley.|$|E

500|$|Following Charles I's {{execution}} in 1649, the country's new republican regime remained undecided {{on how to}} treat 5November. [...] Unlike the old system of religious feasts and State anniversaries, it survived, but as a celebration of parliamentary government and Protestantism, and not of monarchy. Commonly the day was still marked by bonfires and miniature explosives, but formal celebrations resumed only with the Restoration, when Charles II became king. [...] Courtiers, High Anglicans and Tories followed the official line, that the event marked God's preservation of the English throne, but generally the celebrations became more diverse. [...] By 1670 London apprentices had turned 5November into a fire festival, attacking not only popery but also [...] "sobriety and good order", demanding money from coach occupants for alcohol and bonfires. [...] The burning of effigies, largely unknown to the Jacobeans, continued in 1673 when Charles's brother, the Duke of York, converted to Catholicism. [...] In response, accompanied by a procession of about 1,000 people, the apprentices fired an effigy of <b>the</b> <b>Whore</b> of Babylon, bedecked {{with a range of}} papal symbols. Similar scenes occurred over the following few years. [...] On 17 November 1677, anti-Catholic fervour saw the Accession Day marked by the burning of a large effigy of the pope—his belly filled with live cats [...] "who squalled most hideously as soon as they felt the fire"—and two effigies of devils [...] "whispering in his ear". [...] Two years later, as the exclusion crisis reached its zenith, an observer noted that [...] "the 5th at night, being gunpowder treason, there were many bonfires and burning of popes as has ever been seen". [...] Violent scenes in 1682 forced London's militia into action, and to prevent any repetition the following year a proclamation was issued, banning bonfires and fireworks.|$|E
500|$|Teetotal and a non-smoker, O'Hara {{rejected}} the Hollywood party lifestyle, and was relatively moderate in her personal grooming. In her earlier career {{she refused to}} appear to smoke and drink on screen, {{and it was only}} later that she relented to avoid being out of a job. O'Hara was considered to be prudish in Hollywood. Malone wrote that [...] "her attitude towards sex bordered on puritanical at times, which wasn't what one expected from a sex symbol". When asked why she would not pose for scantily clad photographs O'Hara remarked: [...] "I come from a very strict family, and I can't do some of the things other actresses can because my folks in Dublin would think I turned out bad", and in 1948 she stated that she wouldn't be photographed in a bathing suit [...] "Because I don't think I looked like Lana Turner in a bathing suit, frankly. O'Hara later commented that [...] "I'm not prudish but my training was strict". She believed that her squeaky-clean lifestyle took its toll on her career. She once said, [...] "I'm a helpless victim of a Hollywood whispering campaign. Because I don't let the producer and director kiss me every morning or let them paw me they have spread around town that I am not a woman, that I am a cold piece of marble statuary" [...] and [...] "I wouldn't throw myself on the casting couch, and I know that cost me parts. I wasn't going to play <b>the</b> <b>whore.</b> That wasn't me". She vented her frustration on not being given edgier roles in an interview with The Los Angeles Times, saying [...] "Producers look at a pretty face and think: 'She must have got this far on her looks'. Then comes along a girl with a plain face and they think, 'She must be a great actress, she isn't pretty'. So they give her the glamour treatment and the pretty girl gets left behind". O'Hara believed that she missed out on a number of roles in some of the classic black and white films because she aesthetically pictured so well in Technicolor productions. Such was her natural beauty that {{she was one of the}} few actresses in Hollywood during her career to not undergo cosmetic surgery, though she had one crooked tooth which she refused to part with.|$|E
