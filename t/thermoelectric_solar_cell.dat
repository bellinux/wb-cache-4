40|$|A large {{factor in}} the {{decision}} of using solar systems over readily available fossil fuels and other energy production methods is the upfront cost of solar systems. Therefore a potentially low cost energy harvesting device has been proposed {{in the form of}} a hybrid organic-inorganic <b>thermoelectric</b> <b>solar</b> <b>cell.</b> The proposed device uses two different inorganic materials as the top and bottom contacts, and an organic material between the two contacts as a light absorber. The two contacts proposed are Zinc Oxide (ZnO) nanowires and Bismuth Telluride (BiTe) nanowires, and the organic light absorber is a semiconductor porphyrin. To further develop and design this device, the two contact materials need to be characterized and further developed. This manuscript focuses on the growth and characterization of the ZnO nanowires as the top contact. Interestingly, during the development and characterization of the ZnO nanowires, another nanostructure was unexpectedly grown and was also characterized. The second structure was determined to be a two dimensional ZnO nanoplatelet. It was observed the two structures share the same crystal structure and both can be grown at atmospheric pressure in a low energy growth process. The characterization methods used to characterize the two ZnO structures were electron microscopy including Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM), diffraction pattern analysis via TEM, Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDS) via TEM, X-Ray Diffraction Analysis (XRD), absorption spectral analysis, and I-V curves via Contact Atomic Force Microscopy (CAFM).

40|$|The use of {{compression}} flows (CPF) for {{the formation}} of metal and silicide nanostructures for data storage devices, <b>thermoelectric</b> materials and <b>solar</b> <b>cells</b> is presented. The action of CPF with injected metallic powder results in the formation of coatings composed of spherical clusters with complex structure: each submicron cluster (0, 1 - 0, 2 μm radius) is formed from a number of nanosized ones (10 - 25 nm radius). The action of CPF on binary “metal-silicon” systems provides formation of branched silicon dendrites (tip radius 200 nm, primary spacing 1, 2 μm); interdendritic space is filled with nanostructured (50 - 100 nm) “silicide-silicon” and “monosilicide-disilicide” composite due to melting of the surface layer, rapid solidification (10 - 3 m/s) and constitutional overcooling.

40|$|Nanostructured {{materials}} have attracted extensive attention {{due to their}} small dimension and enhanced properties compared to bulk materials, and their large range of potential applications in energy harvesting devices. Among these materials, nanostructured chalcogenides {{play an important role}} in <b>thermoelectric</b> and <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> devices. Electrochemical techniques have drawn attention as an improved method for synthesizing nanostructured chalcogenide materials, since they provide a cost-effective, simple, and versatile method for depositing various kind of chalcogenides with tunable nanostructures and properties. The overall objective of this dissertation work is to develop the following electrochemical techniques: 1) 	to synthesize nanostructured chalcogenide materials (e. g. Bi x Te y, Pb x Te y and Cd x Te y) with well-controlled dimensions, surface morphologies and compositions 2) 	to systematically investigate the effect of experimental parameters on their nanostructures 3) 	to characterize their tunable properties 4) 	and ultimately to establish a guidance of experimental design for further synthesis of other nanostructured chalcogenide materials. In this dissertation, the viability of using electrochemical methods for synthesizing nanostructured three chalcogenide materials - Bismuth telluride (Bi x Te y) Lead telluride (Pb x Te y) and Cadmium telluride (Cd x Te y) was tested. An easy way to tune their size (nano to micro), surface morphology (from novel nanostructures to nanoparticles and core/shell hybrid nanostructure) and composition (excess either electropositive element or chalcogens) by tailoring the electrochemical parameters such as electrolyte composition, type and thickness of sacrificial materials, and reaction time of electrochemical techniques, including electrodeposition (ED) and galvanic displacement (GD), was demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, silicon {{nanowires}} (SiNW) {{have generated}} great {{interest for the}} fabrication of nanometre-scale transistors, <b>thermoelectric</b> devices, <b>solar</b> <b>cells,</b> and biological/chemical sensors. SiNWs, with minimum diameter ~ 10 nm, and lengths up to ~ 100 μm, may be prepared {{by a variety of}} growth, etching and high-resolution lithographic techniques. In particular, metal-assisted chemical etching (MACE) provides a low-cost method of producing large arrays of high aspect ratio SiNWs. This thesis investigates field-effect transistors (FETs) using SiNWs prepared by MACE. Source/drain contacts to the FET are defined by titanium silicide. FETs using large-area back-gates are found to be dominated by Schottky barriers (SB) at the source and drain. The ISD-VSD and ISD-VBG characteristics are determined by thermionic emission across the source SB, which may be lowered by the image-force potential, and by the local electric field generated by the source/drain and gate potentials. These results demonstrate that complete FET operation may be obtained by considering only the effect of SB lowering. An inverted-channel SiNW FET is also presented, where the characteristics are determined by both the contact SBs and the inversion layer in the NW. After subtracting the effect of the SBs from the data, a long-channel MOSFET model is used to find the field-effect electron mobility μFE ~ 100 cm 2 /Vs. FETs using parallel arrays of SiNWs are also investigated. These devices show similar source/drain relationship to single SiNW devices, but a weakened gate dependence, attributed to the aggregate response of multiple SiNWs in parallel. Low-temperature measurements of these multi-wire devices from 300 K to 20 K are used to extract the effective SB heights. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|Tailoring {{the solar}} {{absorptivity}} (alpha(sub s)) and thermal emissivity (epsilon(sub T)) of materials constitutes an innovative approach to solar energy control and energy conversion. Numerous ceramic and metallic materials are currently available for solar absorbance/thermal emittance control.

This research presents an alternate approach based on nanoparticle-filled polymers to afford mechanically durable solar-absorptive and thermally-emissive polymer nanocomposites. The alpha(sub s) and epsilon(sub T) were measured with various nano inclusions, such as carbon nanophase particles (CNPs), at different concentrations. Research has shown that adding only 5 wt% CNPs increased the alpha(sub s) and epsilon(sub T) by a factor of about 47 and 2, respectively, compared to the pristine polymer.
