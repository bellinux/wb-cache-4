5|$|After {{two weeks}} in Leipzig, before {{the second week of}} January 1793, Kościuszko set off for Paris, where he tried to gain French support for the planned {{uprising}} in Poland. He stayed there until summer, but despite <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> revolutionary influence there, the French paid only lip service to the Polish cause, and refused to commit themselves to anything concrete. Kościuszko concluded that the French authorities were not interested in Poland beyond what use it could have for their own cause, and he was increasingly disappointed in the pettiness of the French Revolution—the infighting among different factions, and <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> reign of terror.|$|E
5|$|Although the Norman {{invasion}} {{caused some}} damage as soldiers looted {{the countryside and}} land was confiscated for castle building, the English economy was not greatly affected. Taxes were increased, however, and the Normans established extensive forests that were exploited for their natural resources and protected by royal laws. The next two centuries saw huge growth in the English economy, driven {{in part by the}} increase in the population from around 1.5million in 1086 to between 4and 5million in 1300. More land, much of it {{at the expense of the}} royal forests, was brought into production to feed <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> population and to produce wool for export to Europe. Many hundreds of new towns, some of them planned communities, were built across England, supporting the creation of guilds, charter fairs and other medieval institutions which governed <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> trade. Jewish financiers played a significant role in funding <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> economy, along with the new Cistercian and Augustinian religious orders that emerged as major players in the wool trade of the north. Mining increased in England, with a silver boom in the 12th century helping to fuel the expansion of the money supply.|$|E
