5|$|A {{major change}} from The Two Towers is the {{interactive}} {{nature of the}} game environments. The player can operate machinery, for example bridges and catapults, to complete objectives, and use environmental objects as weapons, such as spears and cauldrons, to kill enemies. The levels are also <b>twice</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> of the largest level from The Two Towers and many are less linear. Unlike The Two Towers, The Return of the King features a co-op mode, allowing two players to play through the game together. The North American PlayStation 2 version also has an online multiplayer mode, with USB headset support, although this {{was removed from the}} European version of the game.|$|E

5|$|The 747 was {{conceived}} while air travel was increasing in the 1960s. The era of commercial jet transportation, {{led by the}} enormous popularity of the Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8, had revolutionized long-distance travel.

During this time, airport congestion, worsened by increasing numbers of passengers carried on relatively small aircraft, became a problem that Trippe thought could be addressed by a larger new aircraft.|$|E

5|$|The {{respective}} {{forces of}} the royal and baronial armies have been estimated to be 10,000 and 5,000 strong. Montfort, facing such unfavourable numbers, decided to concentrate his forces on {{the centre of the}} enemy’s front, hoping to drive a wedge through the line. Though the tactics were initially successful, the baronial forces soon lost the initiative, especially as the Welsh infantry provided by Llywelyn ap Gruffudd had proved unreliable, and deserted at an early point. The flanks of the royal army closed in on Montfort's, surrounding them. With Montfort confronted by a force <b>twice</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> of his own, on unfavourable ground, the battle rapidly turned into a massacre.|$|E

5|$|With the Battle of Lewes, Montfort had won {{control of}} royal government, {{but after the}} {{defection}} of several close allies and the escape from captivity of Prince Edward, he found himself on the defensive. Forced to engage the royalists at Evesham, he faced an army <b>twice</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> of his own. The battle soon turned into a massacre; Montfort himself was killed and his body mutilated. Though the battle effectively restored royal authority, scattered resistance remained until the Dictum of Kenilworth was signed in 1267.|$|E
5|$|Both {{species of}} Knoetschkesuchus {{have only two}} {{distinct}} types of teeth, uniquely among atoposaurids. Other atoposaurids have a third type of leaf-shaped teeth. The first type of teeth, found {{near the front of}} the jaw, are conical, slightly constricted at the base, and curved slightly inwards. A subtype is represented by the canine-like or pseudocaniniform teeth. They are the fourth and fifth maxillary teeth, and are enlarged (about <b>twice</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> of the other maxillary teeth), more pointed, and more constricted at the base. The second type of teeth, which constitutes the rest of the teeth, are shaped like thin lanceheads, with a wide base and a narrower tip; in K. guimarotae all of the tips are sharp, but in K. langenbergensis they gradually become blunter.|$|E

Ravard had a string of top-ten placings in the later season, coming third at Paris–Brussels, eighth at the Grand Prix d'Isbergues, and seventh at Paris–Bourges. Ravard was also the rider responsible for the team's lone single-day victory of the season at the Châteauroux Classic, where he raced as the defending champion and took his third career win in the event. Ravard won a large field sprint, a victory which he felt validated his career.

50|$|A figure {{prominent}} {{in the history of}} Measham was Joseph Wilkes, an entrepreneur during {{the early part of the}} industrial revolution. Wilkes bought Measham Manor from William Wollaston in 1777 and undertook extensive industrial and agricultural development, many signs of which are still visible today. He used larger bricks (<b>twice</b> <b>the</b> standard <b>size)</b> in much of his architecture to reduce the numbers used and thereby the amount of brick tax payable.|$|R

5|$|The {{second phase}} of {{construction}} added three salient bastions, each of which were over <b>twice</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> of the northern bastion. The new bastions were placed along the part of al-Rahba's citadel that faced the desert to the west. The builders {{in the second phase}} also reinforced al-Rahba's walls with roughly cut conglomerate blocks fixed together by high-quality mortar. In the third phase, higher quality mudbrick was used, the western curtain wall was elevated and the southwestern curtain wall was replaced and decorated with bands of Arabic inscriptions. In addition, a large, brick dome was built atop the ground-level chamber of the northwestern bastion. The external walls of the fortress reached their final form during the third phase, though there would be further restorations in later decades.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, {{a two-year}} project {{to rebuild the}} {{property}} above the shops on Ship Street was completed. As part of the work, {{carried out by the}} architects Maguire & Co., the bottom floor was converted from rooms occupied by students and fellows into a new Junior Common Room (JCR), to replace the common room in the second quadrangle, which was by then too small to cope with the increased numbers of students. The new JCR, about <b>twice</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> of the previous one, can be partitioned into smaller rooms or kept open for large meetings; there is also a kitchen, a student committee room and a glazed conservatory extending onto the adjoining terrace. Above the JCR are three floors of new student rooms. The two rooms of the old JCR, each of which contain war memorials, have been converted into seminar and meeting rooms, and are now known as the Harold Wilson Room and the Memorial Room.|$|E
5|$|Io plays a {{significant}} role in shaping Jupiter's magnetic field, acting as an electric generator that can develop 400,000 volts across itself and create an electric current of 3 million amperes, releasing ions that give Jupiter a magnetic field inflated to more than <b>twice</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> it would otherwise have. The magnetosphere of Jupiter sweeps up gases and dust from Io's thin atmosphere at a rate of 1tonne per second. This material is mostly composed of ionized and atomic sulfur, oxygen and chlorine; atomic sodium and potassium; molecular sulfur dioxide and sulfur; and sodium chloride dust. These materials originate from Io's volcanic activity, but the material that escapes to Jupiter's magnetic field and into interplanetary space comes directly from Io's atmosphere. These materials, depending on their ionized state and composition, end up in various neutral (non-ionized) clouds and radiation belts in Jupiter's magnetosphere and, in some cases, are eventually ejected from the Jovian system.|$|E

5|$|It was {{immediately}} {{agreed that the}} 1941 season of Proms should {{be held at the}} Albert Hall. It was <b>twice</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> of the Queen's Hall, with poor acoustics, but a six-week series was judged a success, and the Albert Hall remained the home of the Proms. Wood, aged seventy-two, was persuaded to have an associate conductor to relieve him of some of the burden. Basil Cameron undertook the task and remained a Prom conductor until his retirement, aged eighty, in 1964. The BBC brought its symphony orchestra back to London and resumed its backing of the Proms in 1942; Boult joined Cameron as Wood's associate conductor during that season. In early 1943, Wood's health deteriorated, and two days after the start of that year's season, he collapsed and was ordered to have a month in bed. Despite wartime vicissitudes, the 1943 season sold nearly 250,000 tickets, with an average audience of about 4,000 – many more than could have fitted into the Queen's Hall.|$|E
5|$|The ballad Master McGrath {{concerns}} a greyhound {{of that name}} from Lurgan which became an Irish sporting hero. The dog was bought in Lurgan by the Brownlow family, and the song also mentions his owner Charles Brownlow, {{referred to in the}} lyrics as Lord Lurgan. Master McGrath won the Waterloo Cup hare coursing competition three times in 1868, 1870 and 1871 at a time when this was a high-profile sport. A post mortem found that he had a heart <b>twice</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> of what is normal for a dog of his size. He is remembered all over the town, including in its coat of arms. The dog was named McGrath after the kennel boy responsible for its care. A statue of him was unveiled at Craigavon Civic Centre in 1993, over 120 years after his last glory in 1871. The statue was relocated to Lurgan town centre in 2013. A festival is also held yearly in his honour. A Lurgan pub was also named after Master McGrath, although it has been renamed in recent years.|$|E

5|$|Mount Rainier is {{currently}} {{listed as a}} Decade Volcano, {{or one of the}} 16 volcanoes with the greatest likelihood of causing great loss of life and property if eruptive activity resumes. If Mt. Rainier were to erupt as powerfully as Mount St. Helens did in its May18, 1980 eruption, the effect would be cumulatively greater, because of the far more massive amounts of glacial ice locked on the volcano compared to Mount St. Helens, the vastly more heavily populated areas surrounding Rainier, and the simple fact that Mt Rainier is a much bigger volcano, almost <b>twice</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> of St. Helens. Lahars from Rainier pose the most risk to life and property, as many communities lie atop older lahar deposits. According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), about 150,000 people live on top of old lahar deposits of Rainier. Not only is there much ice atop the volcano, the volcano is also slowly being weakened by hydrothermal activity. According to Geoff Clayton, a geologist with a Washington State Geology firm, RH2 Engineering, a repeat of the Osceola mudflow would destroy Enumclaw, Orting, Kent, Auburn, Puyallup, Sumner and all of Renton. Such a mudflow might also reach down the Duwamish estuary and destroy parts of downtown Seattle, and cause tsunamis in Puget Sound and Lake Washington. Rainier is also capable of producing pyroclastic flows and expelling lava.|$|E
5|$|With filming complete, MJZ {{contacted}} post-production company Asylum {{to begin}} work on the substantial visual effects component of The Life. The team, led by Visual Effects Supervisor Robert Moggach, tripled in size as {{the scale of the}} work required became apparent, given the deadline of three weeks. Work on the opening funeral scene was relatively easy, requiring the creation of only minor elements such as additional tombstones in the foreground and color correction on the actors. The same was true for the training sequence, where only minimal tracking work and compositing of matte backgrounds was required. The bulk of the visual effects work was in the battle sequence. This ranged from simple work such as wire removal to the creation of dynamic lighting and reflections from visors and armor, to particle effects for the background smoke and dust, plasma weapon fire and alterations to some of the filmed explosions to lend them the appearance given to plasma explosions within the Halo games. The entire background was a 3D projection of matte paintings and dramatic skies. While the Brute was partially animatronic, substantial adjustments such as scaling to almost <b>twice</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> and the enhancement of fine muscle movements of the creature were made. Other elements, such as the Banshee aircraft and the drop-pods, were created entirely through the use of CGI. Software used by Asylum FX included Flame and Nuke for compositing, Maya for animation, RenderMan and Mantra for rendering, SynthEyes for tracking, Silhouette Pro for rotoscoping work.|$|E

40|$|The bycatch of haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) below legal <b>size</b> in <b>the</b> pelagic {{longline}} fisheries for haddock {{off the coast}} of Finnmark, northern Norway, is often high. This project was aimed at reducing the bycatch of undersized haddock through alterations in gear technology and fishing strategy. Fishing experiments with commercial longline vessels were carried out in JuneIJuly 1995 and 1996. The following modifications of fishing gear and fishing technology were tested: longlines with increased sinking speed; hooks with an inedible plastic body attached to the shank; hooks with nylon bristles attached to the shank; restructured bait based on mackerel (Scomber scombrus) and sandeel (Ammodytes lancea); mackerel bait of <b>twice</b> <b>the</b> normal size; restructured mackerel bait of <b>twice</b> <b>the</b> normal <b>size.</b> None of <b>the</b> methods tested gave the desired improvements in <b>the</b> <b>size</b> distribution of <b>the</b> haddock catches. Traditional mackerel bait of <b>twice</b> <b>the</b> normal <b>size</b> about 40 % reduction in undersized fish, but an increase in bait costs due to larger bait size, will not be accepted by commercial fishermen. In the survival experiments, where 18 haddock were torn off the longline hooks at the sea surface and kept in sea water tanks for five days, no mortality was found. One of the fishes was in bad condition at day five, and would probably not have survived if it was released to the sea. Additional experiments have to be carried out to confirm these results...|$|R
