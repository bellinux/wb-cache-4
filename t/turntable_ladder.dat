25|$|In the United States, a tiller truck, {{also known}} as a {{tractor-drawn}} aerial, tiller ladder, or hook-and-ladder truck, is a specialized <b>turntable</b> <b>ladder</b> mounted on a semi-trailer truck. Unlike a commercial semi, the trailer and tractor are permanently combined and special tools are required to separate them. It has two drivers, with separate steering wheels for front and rear wheels.|$|E
25|$|A <b>turntable</b> <b>ladder</b> (TL) {{is perhaps}} the best-known form of special purpose aerial apparatus, and is used {{to gain access to}} fires {{occurring}} at height using a large telescopic ladder, where conventional ladders carried on conventional appliances might not reach. The name is derived {{from the fact that the}} large ladder is mounted on a turntable on the back of a truck chassis, allowing it to pivot around a stable base. To increase its length, the ladder is telescopic. Modern telescopic ladders are either hydraulic or pneumatic. These mechanical features allow the use of ladders which are longer, sturdier, and more stable. They may also have pre-attached hoses or other equipment.|$|E

50|$|In 1941, LPTB were {{allocated}} ten 'unfrozen'TD7 Titans (STD 101-11), {{which received}} early Ministry of Supply Utility Style bodies by Park Royal Vehicles. Their heavy flywheels and slow gearchanges made them umpopular with drivers.

50|$|The Andorran Fire Brigade, with {{headquarters}} at Santa Coloma, operates from four modern fire stations, {{and has a}} staff of around 120 firefighters. The service is equipped with 24 fire service vehicles - 16 heavy appliances (fire tenders, <b>turntable</b> <b>ladders,</b> and specialist four-wheel drive vehicles), 4 light support vehicles (cars and vans), and 4 ambulances. Service is provided full-time, with five fire crews on station on a shift basis, and other firefighters available on call.|$|R
25|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, means of {{reaching}} tall structures were devised. At first, manually extendable ladders were used; as these grew in length (and weight), {{they were put}} onto two large wheels. When carried by fire engines these wheeled escape ladders had the wheels suspended behind {{the rear of the}} vehicle, making them a distinctive sight. Before long, <b>turntable</b> <b>ladders</b> — which were even longer, mechanically extendable, and installed directly onto fire trucks — made their appearances.|$|R
5000|$|The final {{attendance}} involved 30 pumping appliances, 3 <b>turntable</b> <b>ladders,</b> 3 emergency tenders {{and other}} specialist vehicles such as hose layers for relaying water long distances, including the nearby Regents Canal at Little Venice.

The incident {{proved to be the}} largest fire in Central London that year, and resulted in one of the largest number of fire brigade bravery commendations from a single incident. Four of the firemen later received awards from the Queen.|$|R

50|$|A <b>Turntable</b> <b>Ladder</b> (TL) {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to a HP, however with a primary difference of instead of having a caged platform the TL is simply a large telescopic ladder, which can still be used to effect rescues from tall structures and pump water.|$|E
5000|$|London's main railway goods {{terminal}} at [...] was gutted by {{a spectacular}} fire in December 1964. Within 37 {{minutes of the}} first crews arriving on scene, {{the scale of the}} blaze was so intense and widespread that 40 fire engines had been mobilised. In addition, 12 <b>turntable</b> <b>ladders,</b> two hose layers, two emergency tenders, and 235 firefighters battled the fire which killed two customs officials and destroyed hundreds of railway wagons, dozens of motor vehicles and millions of pounds worth of goods. The site remained derelict for the next 30 years until being rebuilt as Shoreditch High Street railway station.|$|R
5000|$|On arrival, {{a chaotic}} scene greeted the senior officer, a serious fire in {{progress}} and numerous persons needing rescue. A priority message {{was made to}} control and a [...] "Make pumps 8" [...] message was sent (requesting a further 4 pumping appliances {{in addition to the}} original 4) within minutes of first arriving, whilst rescues (the priority) were being made from both the front and rear of the building. Access was impeded by parked cars. Further reinforcements were requested, first to 15 pumps, and then 20, and finally 30 with a further 2 <b>turntable</b> <b>ladders</b> requested.|$|R
5000|$|A {{roll call}} in the street showed who was missing, and further rescue {{attempts}} were made from ladders through the first floor windows. The first body was found at 1:48 PM, {{and when it was}} clear that no survivors were to be found, rescuers were ordered to withdraw from the building until the fire was under control. It was no longer justifiable to risk further men, as the building was in a hazardous condition. The fire was attacked externally from <b>turntable</b> <b>ladders,</b> hydraulic platform, and a [...] "Scoosher" [...] aerial monitor. By mid afternoon, with the fire under control, the bodies could be retrieved, with the last body, that of Fireman Rook, found at around 6:11 PM.|$|R

The tallest ladder in Mumbai (90m) can reach up to the 33rd floor.|$|E

5000|$|In {{meeting their}} Mission, Vision and Values Avon Fire & Rescue Service {{utilizes}} a large cadre of emergency equipment. These include 81 appliances, 51 pumping appliances, four <b>turntable</b> <b>ladders</b> and 16 special appliances. Adding to the available emergency response {{can also be}} their boats, pods, fork lift trucks, a Control Emergency Evacuation Vehicle and a telescopic handler.In 2009 & 2011 Avon Fire & Rescue added 2 - Polybilt bodied Combined Aerial Rescue Platforms (CARP). [...] The first began service at the Patchway fire station and was subsequently moved to the Speedwell fire station. The second {{was assigned to the}} Bedminster fire station. [...] However both of these appliances have been withdrawn from service by July 2016 and the bodywork has been removed from the chassis to allow for the chassis to be used for new specialist appliances.|$|R
5000|$|The alarm {{was raised}} at around 10:30, {{with the first}} crews {{arriving}} within five minutes. A serious fire was seen to be in progress, and a [...] "Make Pumps 10" [...] message was sent to control almost immediately (additional appliances required, which {{in addition to those}} already there would total 10). As part of this request for reinforcements, a [...] "Persons Reported" [...] message was sent, indicating persons were requiring urgent assistance and rescue. 70 firemen attended to fight the fire, with water poured onto the building from <b>turntable</b> <b>ladders.</b> It was found that efforts at rescue were futile due to the intense heat, and the difficulties in entering the building.Escape from the building had been prevented due to fire on the stairs, caused by polyurethane foam, and the escape doors from the first and second floors to the fire escape were found to have been locked from the inside. Eventually, no persons were seen at the windows, and any hopes of rescue for those inside ended when the roof of the building collapsed. Many attempts were made to enter the building where the employees were believed to be, but intense heat drove back the firemen. The Glasgow Fire Service personnel eventually gained access to the building, by cutting through the steel doors using oxy-propane cutting gear. The dead were found inside the factory to have died due to the inhalation of smoke, the burning of polyurethane foam resulting in poisonous fumes, fatal when inhaled.|$|R
