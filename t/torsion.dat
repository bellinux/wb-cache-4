5|$|The adult {{stage is}} usually short, its {{function}} only to mate and lay eggs. The genitalia of female flies are rotated to a varying {{degree from the}} position found in other insects. In some flies, this is a temporary rotation during mating, but in others, it is a permanent <b>torsion</b> of the organs that occurs during the pupal stage. This <b>torsion</b> {{may lead to the}} anus being below the genitals, or, in the case of 360° <b>torsion,</b> to the sperm duct being wrapped around the gut and the external organs being in their usual position. When flies mate, the male initially flies on top of the female, facing in the same direction, but then turns around to face in the opposite direction. This forces the male to lie on his back for his genitalia to remain engaged with those of the female, or the <b>torsion</b> of the male genitals allows the male to mate while remaining upright. This leads to flies having more reproduction abilities than most insects, and much quicker. Flies occur in large populations due to their ability to mate effectively and quickly during the mating season.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, a {{pterosaur}} neck vertebra from Brazil with a spinosaurid tooth {{embedded in}} it {{confirmed that the}} latter were not exclusively piscivorous. A 2007 finite element analysis of CT scanned snouts indicated that the biomechanics of Baryonyx were most {{similar to those of}} the gharial and unlike those of the American alligator and more-conventional theropods, supporting a piscivorous diet for spinosaurids. Their secondary palate helped them resist bending and <b>torsion</b> of their tubular snouts. A 2013 beam-theory study compared the biomechanics of CT-scanned spinosaurid snouts with those of extant crocodilians, and found the snouts of Baryonyx and Spinosaurus similar in their resistance to bending and <b>torsion.</b> Baryonyx was found to have relatively high resistance in the snout to dorsoventral bending compared with Spinosaurus and the gharial. The authors concluded (in contrast to the 2007 study) that Baryonyx performed differently than the gharial; spinosaurids were not exclusive piscivores, and their diet was determined by their individual size.|$|E

Geometric <b>torsions</b> are <b>torsions</b> of acyclic {{complexes}} of vector spaces which {{consist of}} differentials of geometric quantities {{assigned to the}} elements of a manifold triangulation.

In order to show this, they reversed the magnetization in an iron bar suspended on a <b>torsion</b> pendulum.

In this case, the <b>torsion</b> of the vine is related to the <b>torsion</b> of the pair of filaments (or equivalently the surface <b>torsion</b> of the ribbon connecting the filaments), and it reflects the difference between the length-maximizing (geodesic) configuration of the vine and its energy-minimizing configuration.|$|E
