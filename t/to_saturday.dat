5|$|As {{the crew}} {{worked through the}} {{procedures}} and checklists for entry on Friday, the managers on the ground closely examined the weather patterns around Florida, which were less than favorable. The crew was advised that there were low clouds and thunderstorms, both conditions that violated landing criteria, so managers waived the first opportunity. A second opportunity was also not taken, as the weather had not improved. Entry Flight Director Norm Knight called up Edwards Air Force Base shortly after the decision to delay <b>to</b> <b>Saturday</b> was made, which would give the crew {{a total of six}} Saturday landing opportunities, three at each location.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{regulations}} {{imposed by the}} Writers Guild of America, only those employed as writers for Saturday Night Live were allowed to write sketches for the program. Henson and his puppeteers merely performed the scripts for the segments—they {{were not involved in}} the writing process. Saturday Night Live cast members did not enjoy working with The Land of Gorch segments. Writing assignments for The Land of Gorch sketches were given <b>to</b> <b>Saturday</b> Night Live staff as a penalty for being the least-liked among the production team. Writers generally regarded the routines as childish.|$|E
5|$|The GNP's main route {{opened on}} 15 December 1906, but the Strand branch was not opened until 30 November 1907. Initially, shuttle trains {{operated}} to Holborn {{from the eastern}} platform into the through platform at Holborn. At peak times, an additional train operated alternately in the branch's western tunnel into the bay platform at Holborn. During {{the first year of}} operation, a train for theatregoers operated late on Monday <b>to</b> <b>Saturday</b> evenings from Strand through Holborn and northbound to Finsbury Park; this was discontinued in October 1908.|$|E
5|$|The Land of Gorch was a {{recurring}} skit {{that appeared in}} season one of the American comedy television program Saturday Night Live, featuring Jim Henson's Muppets. Prior to his work for children on Sesame Street, Henson had created puppetry work, including his show Sam and Friends, for adult audiences. His characters appeared regularly on the late-night comedy television programs, and The Ed Sullivan Show. After Sesame Street, Henson feared he would become typecast into working on children's television series. His talent agent Bernie Brillstein, who represented Gilda Radner, Dan Aykroyd, and John Belushi, helped him transition <b>to</b> <b>Saturday</b> Night Live.|$|E

5|$|The UK Singles Chart is {{a record}} chart {{compiled}} {{on behalf of the}} British record industry based on sales of singles in the UK. Since 1997, the chart has been compiled by The Official Charts Company and was based entirely on sales of physical singles from retail outlets until 2005, when digital downloads were included in the chart compilation. The UK Singles Chart originated in 1952, when New Musical Express (NME) published the first chart of singles sales. The positions of all songs are based on week end sale totals, from Sunday <b>to</b> <b>Saturday,</b> but pre-1987, the charts were released on a Tuesday due to the need for manual calculation.|$|E
5|$|The UK Singles Chart is {{compiled}} by the Official Charts Company (OCC) {{on behalf of the}} British record industry. In the 2000s the chart week ran from Sunday <b>to</b> <b>Saturday,</b> and the top 40 singles were revealed each Sunday on BBC Radio 1. Before the advent of music downloads, it was based entirely on sales of physical singles from retail outlets, but since 2005 permanent downloads have been included in the chart compilation.|$|E
5|$|The UK Singles Downloads Chart is {{a weekly}} music chart that ranks the most-downloaded singles in the United Kingdom. During the 2000s, the chart was {{compiled}} by The Official UK Charts Company (OCC) on behalf on the British music industry, and was {{based solely on}} non-subscription music downloads from selected online music stores. It was compiled using weekly sales from Sunday <b>to</b> <b>Saturday,</b> and was published each Wednesday afternoon, {{so as not to}} clash with the Sunday evening announcement of the UK Singles Chart.|$|E
50|$|Several Christian {{holidays}} traditionally {{falling on}} working days or on fixed dates {{have been moved}} <b>to</b> <b>Saturdays</b> and Sundays. In 1955, Midsummer day was moved <b>to</b> the <b>Saturday</b> following 19 June, {{the feast of the}} Annunciation to the Sunday following 21 March (or, if this coincides with Easter or with Palm Sunday, the Sunday before Palm Sunday), and All Saints' Day <b>to</b> the <b>Saturday</b> following 30 October. More holidays were moved in 1973: Epiphany <b>to</b> the <b>Saturday</b> following 5 January and Ascension Day <b>to</b> the <b>Saturday</b> before the traditional Thursday, but these revisions were reversed in 1991.|$|R

5|$|The final leg of Gloucestershire's {{northern}} {{tour was}} at Trent Bridge where they played Nottinghamshire from Thursday, 1 August, <b>to</b> <b>Saturday,</b> 3 August. This match was drawn after rain intervened. Gloucestershire scored 165 (Grace 9) and 253 (Grace 116). Nottinghamshire scored 258 (Grace 2–91) and 10 for 1 (Grace (1–2). So Grace finally {{made his first}} (and only) century of the 1878 season, surprisingly against arguably the strongest bowling attack in the country.|$|E
5|$|Each {{episode was}} {{predominantly}} live from Studio 1 of the BBC's Riverside Studios in Hammersmith, London. The episodes were rehearsed from Tuesday <b>to</b> <b>Saturday,</b> usually at the Mary Wood Settlement in Tavistock Place, London, with camera rehearsals {{in the morning}} and afternoon of transmission. Not every scene was live; a significant amount of material was on 35 mm film and inserted during the performance. Most filming involved scenes set on location or those too technically complex or expansive to achieve live. The latter were shot at Ealing Studios, acquired by the BBC in 1955, where Cartier worked with the cinematographer A. A. Englander. Pre-filming was also used to show the passage of time in the second episode; the archaeological dig at Ealing was shown to have dug deeper into the ground than the equivalent set at Riverside, enabling a sense of time having elapsed {{that would not have been}} possible in an all-live production.|$|E
5|$|Grace's first {{match was}} for the United South of England Eleven (USEE) against Twenty of Rochdale from Thursday, 2 May <b>to</b> <b>Saturday,</b> 4 May at Butcher's Meadow in Rochdale. The match was drawn after USEE had been behind on first innings. Although they saved the game, largely because Grace scored 57 in the second innings, {{it was not an}} auspicious {{performance}} by a team that included W. G. and Fred Grace along with five players who had taken part in the inaugural Test series in Australia the previous year: Henry Charlwood, Harry Jupp, James Lillywhite, Billy Midwinter and James Southerton. From Rochdale, Grace travelled by train to London for his next fixture on Monday, 6 May and Tuesday, 7 May which was for MCC at Lord's against a team called the Colts of England. It was another odds match with 11 against 22 and another draw. Grace made scores of 15 and 9. His team included A. N. Hornby, Alfred Shaw and Fred Morley.|$|E

5|$|KWGN and KPLR moved The CW's primetime lineup {{one hour}} later (to 8:00 p.m.) than the network-recommended timeslot, and shifted their evening newscasts to 7:00 p.m. (weekend {{editions of the}} evening newscasts were {{discontinued}} with the move; KPLR has since expanded its 7:00 p.m. newscast <b>to</b> <b>Saturday</b> and Sunday evenings) to avoid competing with KDVR and KTVI's 9:00 p.m. newscasts; KWGN retained its weekday morning newscast (which competes directly with KDVR's morning newscast), but canceled its 5:30 p.m. – and later, 11:00 a.m. – newscasts. In contrast, KPLR (which had run a primetime newscast for much of its history) eventually added hour-long midday and late afternoon newscasts. The two LMA arrangements became legal duopolies in December 2013, once Tribune finalized its acquisition of Local TV.|$|E
5|$|Monday <b>to</b> <b>Saturday</b> {{services}} are half-hourly {{in each direction}} until 20:00, with an hourly service provided after 20:00 and on Sundays. The first weekday service departs at 05:20 from Tweedbank with the last service leaving Edinburgh at 23:54. Departure times from Edinburgh are usually at 24 and 54 minutes past the hour, while from Tweedbank trains depart at 28 and 58 minutes past the hour; individual timings may vary by a minute or so. The trains starting close to on the hour do not call at Stow except in the peaks and evenings; the Sunday service stops at Stow. Most services operate between Edinburgh and Tweedbank {{except for a few}} morning peak services that continue to Glenrothes with Thornton via the Fife Circle Line and a few evening peak services that originate at Glenrothes with Thornton.|$|E
5|$|On 1 November 1941, Lent became acting Group Commander Gruppenkommandeur of {{the newly}} formed II./NJG2. Lent's first aerial victory as a Gruppenkommandeur, his 20th night-time, and his last in 1941, came during the night of Friday 7 November <b>to</b> <b>Saturday</b> 8 November. He shot down a Wellington 1C heading for Berlin, which came down near Akkrum. The six-man crew of the bomber, X9976 of No. 75 (New Zealand) Squadron, was killed in action. This {{achievement}} earned Lent a reference in the Wehrmachtbericht (his first of six in total), an information bulletin issued by {{the headquarters of the}} Wehrmacht. To be singled out individually in the Wehrmachtbericht was an honour and was entered in the Orders and Decorations' section of one's Service Record Book.|$|E
