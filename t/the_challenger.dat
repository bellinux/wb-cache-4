5|$|While similar lifeforms {{have been}} known to exist in {{shallower}} oceanic trenches (>7,000m) and on the abyssal plain, the lifeforms discovered in <b>the</b> <b>Challenger</b> Deep may represent independent taxa from those shallower ecosystems. This preponderance of soft-shelled organisms at <b>the</b> <b>Challenger</b> Deep may be a result of selection pressure. Millions of years ago, <b>the</b> <b>Challenger</b> Deep was shallower than it is now. Over the past six to nine million years, as <b>the</b> <b>Challenger</b> Deep grew to its present depth, many of the species present in the sediment of that ancient biosphere were unable to adapt to the increasing water pressure and changing environment. Those species that were able to adapt may have been the ancestors of the organisms currently endemic to <b>the</b> <b>Challenger</b> Deep.|$|E

50|$|Two players {{go to the}} {{baseline}} of {{one side of the}} court as the champs. Two other players go to the net {{on the opposite side of}} the champs. These are <b>the</b> <b>challengers.</b> <b>The</b> other players wait at the side of the net post in pairs ready to replace <b>the</b> <b>challengers.</b> <b>The</b> coach lobs a ball over <b>the</b> <b>challenger’s</b> heads and <b>the</b> <b>challengers</b> have to run down the lob and play out the point (after it bounces). If <b>the</b> <b>challengers</b> win <b>the</b> point, they replace the champs and the old champs go to the end of <b>the</b> <b>challengers</b> line. If they lose, they go to the back of <b>the</b> <b>challenger’s</b> line at <b>the</b> net post. This game is designed to practice running down a lob and getting back into the point. This game is also designed to promote net play and aggressiveness, and shot placement.|$|R
