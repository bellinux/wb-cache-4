He remembers Hikuc's words and pushes Fitzgerald downstream {{into the hands of}} the Arikara. The chief kills and scalps Fitzgerald and the Arikara spare Glass. Heavily wounded, Glass retreats into the mountains where he is visited by the spirit of his wife.|$|E
5|$|Commonly, prey-stealing occurs where larger females take {{food items}} stored in other spiders' webs. When they {{encounter}} other spiders {{of the same}} species, often {{including those of the}} opposite sex, <b>they</b> <b>engage</b> in battle, and the defeated spider is eaten. If a male redback is accepted by a female, it is permitted to feed on the victims snared in the female's web. Baby spiders also steal food from their mother, which she tries to prevent. They also consume sticky silk as well as small midges and flies. Spiderlings are cannibalistic, more active ones sometimes eating their less active siblings.|$|E
5|$|Grouped into cooperatives, women play {{a leading}} role in the island's economy. Notably through microcredit, <b>they</b> <b>engage</b> in fishing-related activities, such as smoking fish and {{processing}} shrimp, oysters, and shellfish in general. As there is no industrial activity on the island (the closest such activity is in Ziguinchor), the island is experiencing a rural exodus of young people. They return to help their parents in the rice fields and participate in religious ceremonies during the dry season, but they tend to settle off the island permanently.|$|E

5|$|Males of fly {{species such}} as Cuterebra, many hover flies, bee flies (Bombyliidae) and fruit flies (Tephritidae) {{maintain}} territories within which <b>they</b> <b>engage</b> in aerial pursuit to drive away intruding males and other species. While these territories may be held by individual males, some species form leks with many males aggregating in displays. Some flies maintain an airspace and still others form dense swarms that maintain a stationary location with respect to landmarks. Many flies mate in flight while swarming.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after birth, Bertram {{declares}} {{war with}} Stewie for {{control over the}} playground. They confront {{each other in the}} playground with F-117 Nighthawks and AH-1 Cobras, firing numerous bullets at each other. After the air battle ends with no winners, Bertram resorts to biological warfare, and infects Stewie with chickenpox. After recovering, an enraged Stewie confronts Bertram, and <b>they</b> <b>engage</b> in a sword fight in the play area. Stewie eventually wins by disarming Bertram, and later that night, is seen suspiciously digging a hole with Christopher Moltisanti, but the hole is actually for a young tree. Stewie explains to Christopher that Bertram admitted defeat to Stewie and ran away.|$|E
5|$|Adult elk usually stay in single-sex {{groups for}} most of the year. During the mating period known as the rut, mature bulls compete for the attentions of the cow elk and will try to defend females in their harem. Rival bulls {{challenge}} opponents by bellowing and by paralleling each other, walking back and forth. This allows potential combatants to assess the other's antlers, body size and fighting prowess. If neither bull backs down, <b>they</b> <b>engage</b> in antler wrestling, and bulls sometimes sustain serious injuries. Bulls also dig holes in the ground, in which they urinate and roll their body. A male elk's urethra points upward so that urine is sprayed almost at a right angle to the penis. The urine soaks into their hair and gives them a distinct smell which attracts cows.|$|E

5|$|After {{completing}} the game once, the player can access the Chrysler Building and {{have access to}} the final boss, who takes the form of Aya's sister, Maya. She explains to Aya that Klamp cultivated the liver cells of the original Eve to analyze. When Melissa was giving birth to the Ultimate Being, she created a nest there. In case Melissa and the Ultimate Being failed, the purebred would remain. Aya speaks with her sister, and <b>they</b> <b>engage</b> in battle against the purebred. After the purebred is defeated, the mitochondria inside Aya's body begin to rebel against her. It is explained that Aya's mitochondria have now reached a higher evolutionary stage than Mayaâ€™s, but Maya's personality has suddenly become dominant and begun to fight off the Eve persona. Maya eventually wins, purging the Eve persona from herself. Somehow, Maya protects Aya by preventing the original Eve from taking over her. Aya leaves the building by herself, although she apparently has gained some sort of connection with her dead sister.|$|E
5|$|As {{they enter}} the room, the man stands up and holds the briefcase. During the third chorus, <b>they</b> <b>engage</b> in battle and {{circulate}} the room for defence. Inter cut scenes have the group dancing to the song in the room. Perfume member Kashiyuka summons a mini version of herself, holding onto it, and casting a spell against the man, making him fall to the ground. As they celebrate, Perfume member Nocchi goes towards him and retrieves the briefcase. However, the man stands up and transforms into a polar bear; he then pushes Nocchi to the ground. Perfume member A-Chan throws an apple as a detraction, and the group attacks the bear by using laser beams. Defeated, the polar bear shrinks and transforms into a plush toy. A-Chan picks up the plush toy, and Kashiyuka opens the briefcase to witness a small gold ornament. The video ends with the group exiting the office.|$|E
5|$|At the secured facility, Fauxlivia is able {{to clear}} Peter, Astrid (Jasika Nicole) and Walter from the lab {{in order to allow}} Ray access to the lab. Ray {{continues}} to avoid shifting to a new body. Walter returns to the lab to confirm a theory and is interrupted by Ray. Ray successfully removes the data device, knocks out Walter, and flees to give it to Newton. When Ray requests to be able to return to his family, Newton kills him near his home, but by this time, the Fringe division has identified Ray and have converged on his address. On spotting Newton, <b>they</b> <b>engage</b> in a car chase, eventually damaging Newton's car. Fauxlivia recovers Van Horn's data disc from Newton and hides it before taking Newton into custody.|$|E

5|$|Many of the {{numerous}} human figures revel in an innocent, self-absorbed joy as <b>they</b> <b>engage</b> {{in a wide range}} of activities; some appear to enjoy sensory pleasures, others play unselfconsciously in the water, and yet others cavort in meadows with a variety of animals, seemingly at one with nature. In the middle of the background, a large blue globe resembling a fruit pod rises in the middle of a lake. Visible through its circular window is a man holding his right hand close to his partner's genitals, and the bare buttocks of yet another figure hover in the vicinity. According to Fraenger, the eroticism of the center frame could be considered either as an allegory of spiritual transition or a playground of corruption.|$|E
5|$|Most {{teachers}} {{are required to}} address HIV/AIDS in their curricula; although instructors are, for the most part, committed to helping their students understand and avoid the disease, they face many obstacles that prevent them from informing their students about HIV/AIDS in productive ways. For example, some teachers cannot advise their students to remain faithful to their sexual partners without seeming hypocritical because <b>they</b> <b>engage</b> in extramarital sexual relations themselves. Others feel uncomfortable discussing sexual matters with their students, and some believe that, due to their limited training, they are not knowledgeable enough about HIV/AIDS to direct classroom discussions about the disease. In addition, many teachers feel unsupported by community members, who often either deny {{the extent of the}} epidemic or believe that HIV/AIDS should not be addressed in the classroom.|$|E

After killing many villagers, he proceeds to the Nibelheim reactor where Jenova has been encased. Tifa, a resident of Nibelheim, attacks him soon after he arrives. Sephiroth knocks her aside and continues to Jenova's body, preserved in a large glass tank filled with liquid. Zack follows Sephiroth into the reactor and <b>they</b> <b>engage</b> in combat, but Sephiroth is able to disarm and incapacitate him.

5|$|Soldiers of {{the species}} Globitermes sulphureus commit suicide by autothysisâ€“ rupturing a large gland {{just beneath the surface}} of their cuticles. The thick, yellow fluid in the gland becomes very sticky on contact with the air, {{entangling}} ants or other insects which are trying to invade the nest. Another termite, Neocapriterme taracua, also engages in suicidal defence. Workers physically unable to use their mandibles while in a fight form a pouch full of chemicals, then deliberately rupture themselves, releasing toxic chemicals that paralyse and kill their enemies. The soldiers of the neotropical termite family Serritermitidae have a defence strategy which involves front gland autothysis, with the body rupturing between the head and abdomen. When soldiers guarding nest entrances are attacked by intruders, <b>they</b> <b>engage</b> in autothysis, creating a block that denies entry to any attacker.|$|E
5|$|The Prestige is a 2006 British-American mystery thriller film {{directed}} by Christopher Nolan, from a screenplay adapted {{by his brother}} Jonathan from Christopher Priest's 1995 novel of the same name. Its story follows Robert Angier and Alfred Borden, rival stage magicians in London {{at the end of}} the 19th century. Obsessed with creating the best stage illusion, <b>they</b> <b>engage</b> in competitive one-upmanship with tragic results. The film stars Hugh Jackman as Robert Angier, Christian Bale as Alfred Borden, and David Bowie as Nikola Tesla. It also stars Scarlett Johansson, Michael Caine, Piper Perabo, Andy Serkis, and Rebecca Hall. The film reunites Nolan with actors Bale and Caine from Batman Begins and returning cinematographer Wally Pfister, production designer Nathan Crowley, film score composer David Julyan, and editor Lee Smith.|$|E
5|$|The player flies {{around in}} a fighter with a first-person, in-cockpit view with a fully {{customizable}} fixed head-up display (HUD) as the visual interface. The HUD displays video communications and relevant data on the ship's status and performance, weapons, objectives, and targets. It can also warn players from which direction missiles are locking onto them from, thus becoming an aide for launching countermeasures or taking evasive maneuvers. Players have to maneuver into position and shoot through both shields and hull to destroy enemy ships. While hull damage is unrecoverable, shields recharge over time. With the game supporting force feedback technology, joystick players will find their controllers vibrating or putting up resistance when <b>they</b> <b>engage</b> the afterburners or collide with objects. Similarly, certain events, such as engaging afterburners and firing powerful weapons, will shake the screen {{as a form of}} visual feedback.|$|E

5|$|While The Hobbit {{has been}} adapted and {{elaborated}} upon in many ways, its sequel The Lord of the Rings is often {{claimed to be}} its greatest legacy. The plots share the same basic structure progressing in the same sequence: the stories begin at Bag End, the home of Bilbo Baggins; Bilbo hosts a party that sets the novel's main plot into motion; Gandalf sends the protagonist into a quest eastward; Elrond offers a haven and advice; the adventurers escape dangerous creatures underground (Goblin Town/Moria); <b>they</b> <b>engage</b> another group of elves (The Elvenking's realm/LothlÃ³rien); they traverse a desolate region (Desolation of Smaug/the Dead Marshes); they are received and nourished by a small settlement of men (Lake-town/Ithilien); they fight in a massive battle (The Battle of Five Armies/Battle of Pelennor Fields); their journey climaxes within an infamous mountain peak (Lonely Mountain/Mount Doom); a descendant of kings is restored to his ancestral throne (Bard/Aragorn); and the questing party returns home to find it in a deteriorated condition (having possessions auctioned off/the scouring of the Shire).|$|E
5|$|Climbing the tower, {{the party}} discovers {{the remains of}} a family that {{attempted}} to reach Paradise but failed, and a library suggesting Ashura is controlled by someone else. They encounter him at the top, guarding the final door; he offers each of them control of one of the worlds, but they refuse and defeat him. Before they can pass through the door, a trap drops them to the bottom floor. Encountering the allies they made along their journey, they decide to rescale the tower. As they climb stairs that wrap outside of the tower, <b>they</b> <b>engage</b> each of the fiends revived and defeat them. They find the Creator at the summit, and learn that the fiends and the tower itself are actually part of a game created by him to see heroes defeat evil; for succeeding they would be granted a wish as a reward. Angry at his manipulation, they reject the reward and challenge the Creator, who insists that because he created everything he was allowed to use them as he saw fit. They then attack and defeat the Creator in a fierce battle. The heroes then discover a door leading to an unknown location; they consider entering, but decide to return to their own world.|$|E
5|$|Vincent first {{appears in}} the December 16, 2004 episode as his alter-ego Valerie Davis. While working as an {{executive}} assistant to Crane Industries' vice president Theresa Lopez-Fitzgerald, Valerie is characterized through her connection with the Crane family and past sexual encounter with Chad Harris-Crane. Vincent had fabricated a backstory for Valerie to maintain the illusion that they were two separate people. Valerie joins Crane Industries to change its lack of minority employees. Initially appearing as a supporting character, Valerie helps Ivy Winthrop in her attempts to break up Fox Crane and Kay Bennett and supports Chad during their job. She gains more prominence when Eve catches her having sex with Julian; <b>they</b> <b>engage</b> in a catfight with Eve accusing Valerie of using sex to climb the corporate ladder. During this time, Whitney Russell suspects that Valerie is {{having an affair with}} Chad. Vincent is first seen outside of his split-personality when he introduces himself as a tabloid reporter at Chad and Whitney's wedding on December 26, 2006.

One hundred forty five students from two classes at a university in Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam participated in this one-term study. The students worked in mixedgender and heterogeneous achievement groups. The results show that when the students worked in small groups of 4 - 5 students, every group member had {{a better chance of}} being involved in discussions and interactions, providing a better opportunity to improve their cognition than when they worked in large groups of 8 - 9 students. The findings also show that the students worked more effectively and felt more relaxed when <b>they</b> <b>engaged</b> in inter-group peer assessment than when <b>they</b> <b>engaged</b> in intra-group peer assessment.
