Ironically, functionality like these [...] "finally" [...] clauses can be implemented by a goto to the single return point of the subroutine. An alternative solution is to use the normal stack unwinding (variable deallocation) at function exit to unallocate resources, such as via destructors on local variables, or similar mechanisms such as Python's [...] "with" [...] statement.|$|E

Rhetorical and discursive conventions across languages and cultures have been studied to help non-native English scholars to be successful in the difficult endeavour of being granted publication in international English-medium publications. The increasing competition to get one’s research published in international journals in English has resulted in the authors’ need to clearly spell out what their contribution to their discipline is, a rhetorical convention which seems to be currently crucial especially in some fields. It is the aim of this paper to <b>trace</b> <b>statements</b> of contribution in the Introduction and Conclusion sections of research articles published in two international journals in finance and to compare the results with those obtained from an analysis of three manuscripts written in English by a team of Spanish scholars sent to the same journals but which received major revision or rejection reports.

In turn, these insights can be useful for advocacy processes and collective problem-solving. In order to illustrate this statement a case study was conducted for the North Sea prawn (Pandalus borealis) in the West Coast of Sweden which was the main subject of a controversy that started in 2014 and ended in October 2015 with a Marine Stewardship Council labeling for the contested prawn. We used a method from the scientific humanities, 'controversy mapping', following the methodology suggested by Venturini (2010) and Latour (2012). The method enabled us to <b>trace</b> <b>statements,</b> literatures, and actors involved in the shrimp controversy. By assembling these elements over time, {{we were able to}} describe the process of the controversy and identify the networks that 'wrestled' over the scientific interpretation of the (same) data on shrimp population size along the Swedish West Coast. By using network visualisation and analysis software, the case study shows the extension of the network of actors that were part of the controversy, their roles, influence, perspectives and relationships. The material gathered on the controversy was subsequently analysed {{from the perspective of the}} production and consumption system of the shrimp. It shows how advocacy actors build alliances with selected product chain actors in order to gather momentum for change. Based on the findings from this research it is possible to suggest that controversy study can help the product chain actors understand their production and consumption system better and provide a basis for product chain roundtables for conflict resolution and problem solving.

Second, it assesses housing affordability using four hypothetical households to demonstrate which size of low-income household experiences the greatest challenge in securing suitable accommodations. In this analysis, average rent for rental accommodation is compared to the housing budget for low income households. The analysis identifies small, low income households as those that experience the greatest challenge in securing affordable housing. The third objective is to survey key informants for their insight into the issue. Representatives from market and non-market housing, municipal and provincial governments are interviewed for their insight into affordable housing conditions in Prince George. The thesis concludes that Prince George affordable housing policy should be based on consideration {{of the size of the}} low income family group, and that this should be factored into policy.
