40|$|Abstract. The {{structural}} approach (also {{known as the}} rm’s value approach) to the valuation of corporate debt was initiated in the pathbreaking papers by Black and Scholes [2] and Merton [9] in the 1970 s. In recent years, the so-called rst passage time approach, rst put forward by Black and Cox [3], has been studied and developed by several authors. The aim of this note is to derive the closed-form solution {{for the value of}} a zero-coupon defaultable bond {{within the framework of the}} rst passage time model with stochastic term structure of interest rates. It should be stressed that even in the Gaussian Heath-Jarrow-Merton framework, the availability of the closed-from solution for the price of a corporate debt hinges on a judicious choice of a default <b>triggering</b> <b>barrier</b> reflecting the safety covenants. Key words: credit risk, structural models, rst passage time, term structure models. 1 2 M. RUTKOWSK...|$|R

This specification has two motivations: First, there {{is the need to}} make the option more robust against short-term movements of the share price. This is achieved in Parisian options where it is ensured that a single outlier cannot <b>trigger</b> the <b>barrier.</b> In particular, it is far harder to a#ect the <b>triggering</b> of the <b>barrier</b> by manipulation of the underlying (see Taleb [4]). Second, classical barrier options present hedging problems close to the barrier because their Gamma becomes very large.

It is easy to implement and is universal: it {{can be applied to}} various structures of the contracts including derivatives on multi-asset correlated underlyings and can deal with various type of barriers. In contrast to the Brownian bridge techniques currently commonly used for pricing barrier options, the algorithm tested here does not require knowledge of trigger probabilities nor their estimates.

40|$|Late life {{suicide is}} a major public health problem in the U. S. with elderly white men at highest risk of {{completed}} suicide. This grounded theory study explored individual perspectives of suicidality with men aged 67 to 83 years. A basic social psychological process, Losing Connections, was identified from interviews. Three stages of this process were identified during which the effect of cumulative losses culminated in depression, prompted suicidal ideation, {{and led to a}} decision point for the individual. Loss was the key theme in stage one. Relationship, health, and role losses were identified with professional role loss being the most prominent. The second stage was characterized by depression and despair during which suicidal ideation was prominent. Progressive alienation and the resolution to die characterized this phase. In stage three, the struggle between wanting to die and deciding to do so presented a decision point. The decision point was surrounded by a balance of <b>triggers</b> and <b>barriers,</b> which was modulated by ambivalence. The informant perceived they had reasons to die (triggers), but made the decision not to die because of perceived consequences (<b>barriers).</b> <b>Triggers</b> prompting the decision point were thoughts of a deceased spouse, emotional pain, health problems, and feelings of uselessness and/or hopelessness. The most common barrier to suicide was consequences to family members. Religion was not a significant barrier. Instead, there was a general lack of religious connections among informants.

40|$|International audienceThe {{impact of}} large scale flows on {{turbulent}} transport in magnetized plasmas is explored {{by means of}} various kinetic models. Zonal flows are found {{to lead to a}} non-linear upshift of turbulent transport in a 3 D kinetic model for interchange turbulence. Such a transition is absent from fluid simulations, performed with the same numerical tool, which also predict a much larger transport. The discrepancy cannot be explained by zonal flows only, despite they being overdamped in fluids. Indeed, some difference remains, although reduced, when they are artificially suppressed. Zonal flows are also reported to <b>trigger</b> transport <b>barriers</b> in a 4 D drift-kinetic model for slab ion temperature gradient (ITG) turbulence. The density gradient acts as a source drive for zonal flows, while their curvature back stabilizes the turbulence.

However, the exact mechanism is unclear. We investigated {{the role of}} dephosphorylation of Y 685 -VE-cadherin in the AngII induced pulmonary microvascular endothelial barrier injury. Mice or pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs) were divided into control group, AngII group, AngII+PP 2 (Src kinase inhibitor) group, and PP 2 group. PP 2 was used to inhibit the phosphorylation of Y 685 -VE-cadherin. Pathological changes, infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils, and pulmonary microvascular permeability {{were used to determine}} the pulmonary microvascular endothelial barrier function. Flow cytometry was used to determine the apoptosis of PMVECs, and immunofluorescence was used to determine the skeletal arrangement. Transendothelial resistance was used to detect the permeability of endothelial barrier. Phosphorylation of Y 685 -VE-cadherin was significantly reduced after AngII stimulation (P< 0. 05), together with skeletal rearrangement, and elevation of endothelial permeability which finally induced endothelial barrier injury. After PP 2 interference, the phosphorylation of Y 685 -VE-cadherin was further reduced and the endothelial permeability was further elevated. These data indicated that AngII could induce pulmonary injury by <b>triggering</b> endothelial <b>barrier</b> injury, and such process {{may be related to the}} dephosphorylation of Y 685 -VE-cadherin and the endothelial skeletal rearrangement...|$|R

Reduced zonula occludens 1 expression was observed after HbG transfusion as evidenced by Western blot and confocal microscopy. Claudin- 5 distribution was altered in small- to medium-sized vessels. However, total expression of claudin- 5 and occludin remained unchanged except for a notable increase in occludin 72 hours after HbG transfusion. HbG-transfused animals also showed increased astrocytic glial fibrillary acidic protein expression and IgG extravasation after 72 hours. Increased HO activity and HO- 1 expression with prominent enhancement of HO- 1 immunoreactivity in CD 163 -expressing perivascular cells and infiltrating monocytes/macrophages were also observed.

40|$|Intestinal {{epithelial}} barrier defects, or increased paracellular permeability, {{were first}} reported {{in patients with}} Crohn's disease (CD) over 25 years ago. Although increased permeability may herald relapse to active disease, suggesting that impaired barrier function may contribute to progression, limited understanding of the mechanisms that create barrier defects in CD has {{made it impossible to}} determine whether increased permeability is a cause or effect of disease. It is now clear that inflammatory cytokines <b>trigger</b> intestinal <b>barrier</b> defects acutely, by cytoskeletal contraction, or chronically, via modulation of tight junction protein expression. Both mechanisms cause barrier dysfunction, but their effects on paracellular size and charge selectivity differ. The clinical ramifications of this distinction are not yet clear. Recent data using in vivo models demonstrate that cytoskeletally mediated barrier dysfunction is sufficient to activate innate and adaptive components of mucosal immunity. Consistent with the presence of increased permeability in some healthy first-degree relatives of CD patients, these barrier defects are insufficient to cause disease in the absence of other stimuli. However, cytoskeletally mediated barrier defects are sufficient to accelerate onset and increase severity of experimental inflammatory bowel disease. Thus, inflammatory cytokines can cause barrier defects and, conversely, barrier defects can activate the mucosal immune system. This raises the possibility that restoration of barrier function may be therapeutic in CD. Consistent with this hypothesis, emerging data indicate that inhibition of cytoskeletally mediated barrier dysfunction may be able to prevent disease progression. Barrier restoration may, therefore, represent a non-immunosuppressive approach to achieving or maintaining disease remission...|$|R

Recent studies on adaptive co-management have emphasized the importance of linking institutional and organizational structures at different scales for sustaining socio-ecological resilience and managing cross-scale problems of conservation. Extraordinary conservation accomplishments have been made in cases where government and local communities engage in partnerships for collaborative conservation management.

We show that, in the Cali-fornia endemic plant Collinsia sparsiflora, ecotypic adap-tation to two distinct soil types is associated with the expression of intrinsic F 1 hybrid sterility between ecotypes, over spatial scales of less than 1 km. First, we show that hybrids between soil-adapted ecotypes are less fertile than hybrids within soil ecotypes. Second, we show that between-ecotype postzygotic incompatibility is insensitive to soil growth environment, and can therefore operate under conditions relevant to both ecotypes in the wild. Third, we confirm there is little genetic differentiation between ecotypes using molecular markers, indicating that these postzygotic barriers are recently evolved. Finally, we explore specific soil attributes that might be the source of selective differentiation that confers hybrid sterility. Our results indicate that hybrid barriers are developing in response to strong adaptive differentiation between adja-cent and very recently diverged lineages, despite likely ongoing gene exchange...|$|R

40|$|SummaryMicrobial {{penetration}} of the intestinal epithelial <b>barrier</b> <b>triggers</b> inflammatory responses that include induction of the bactericidal C-type lectin RegIIIγ. Systemic administration of flagellin, a bacterial protein that stimulates Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR 5), induces epithelial expression of RegIIIγ and protects mice from intestinal colonization with antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Flagellin-induced RegIIIγ expression is IL- 22 dependent, but how TLR signaling leads to IL- 22 expression is incompletely defined. By using conditional depletion of lamina propria dendritic cell (LPDC) subsets, we demonstrated that CD 103 +CD 11 b+ LPDCs, but not monocyte-derived CD 103 −CD 11 b+ LPDCs, expressed high amounts of IL- 23 after bacterial flagellin administration and drove IL- 22 -dependent RegIIIγ production. Maximal expression of IL- 23 subunits IL- 23 p 19 and IL- 12 p 40 occurred within 60  min of exposure to flagellin. IL- 23 subsequently induced a burst of IL- 22 followed by sustained RegIIIγ expression. Thus, CD 103 +CD 11 b+ LPDCs, in addition to promoting long-term tolerance to ingested antigens, also rapidly produce IL- 23 in response to detection of flagellin in the lamina propria...|$|R

40|$|Expanding {{to foreign}} markets is {{increasingly}} popular for companies. The company {{has to decide}} which organisational structure, entry mode, {{to use in the}} new market. Factors affecting the change from one entry mode to another have obtained little attention. This thesis concerns Swedish companies’ changes of entry mode in Taiwan. The purpose is to investigate which factors that serve as <b>triggers</b> respectively <b>barriers</b> for the change of entry modes, to be able to examine which theories {{that can be used to}} explain and support mode changes. Different theories concerning choice and change of entry mode have been investigated. Based on the theories, a model including factors influencing entry mode changes was established. The model has contributed a foundation for the empirical findings as well as the analysis of the companies. As a method, a qualitative approach was conducted through interviews with five Swedish companies having a subsidiary in Taiwan. The criterion for the companies was that they should have a subsidiary in Taiwan, but entered the market with another entry mode. Considering the small number of companies and to obtain an understanding about the entry mode changes, a qualitative investigation was the most suitable. Conclusions that could be drawn were that the competitive Taiwanese market had triggered some of the companies to change their entry mode to a subsidiary in order to be present in the market. Increased sales volume did also have evident affect on why the companies changed their entry mode. The investigation also gives indications that barriers tend to be of internal and firm specific character. Concerning the theories explaining entry mode changes, no complete theory could explain the changes, but parts from different theoretical fields could be applied...|$|R
40|$|To realise {{the dream}} of the African Renaissance and a better life for all South Africans, the {{entrepreneurial}} energies of all people, including children, should be harnessed to contribute towards economic development, job creation and poverty alleviation. Entrepreneurship creates wealth and results in economic prosperity for a country. However, in South Africa, entrepreneurship still remains a dream yet to be realised. This is supported by the findings of Maas and Herrington (2006), who identified entrepreneurial activity in South Africa to be very weak as evidenced by a low Total Entrepreneurial Activity (TEA) rate. Youths are not engaging in entrepreneurial activity and are making the bulk of the unemployed in South Africa. The primary objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the perceived <b>triggers</b> and <b>barriers</b> to youth entrepreneurship in South Africa. Two sets of questionnaires were self- administered to high school students and university students. The respondents which consisted of three hundred and twenty three university students and two hundred and fifty six high school students, were selected using simple random sampling method. Five point Likert scale was used to measure the responses. Descriptive as well as inferential statistics were used to analyse the data. The results indicated that youth entrepreneurial intention is low in South Africa. The results also indicated that students perceived mainly extrinsic rewards, market opportunities as well as intrinsic rewards as the three top triggers towards entrepreneurial intention. Independence/autonomy and capital were also regarded as triggers to entrepreneurial intentions. The barriers to youth entrepreneurship included lack of capital, skill and support as well as lack of market opportunities and risk. The study recommends that in order to encourage youth entrepreneurial intentions, government and all stakeholders should ensure that all the perceived triggers are made available. In addition, the barriers to youth entrepreneurship should be minimised. National Research Foundatio...|$|R
40|$|Use of alcohol, {{tobacco and}} other {{addictive}} drugs (ATD) is a well-recognized public health concern {{and one of}} society's greatest problems. Evidence indicates that some youth begin and end drug use during adolescence. A grounded theory methodology was used to explore adolescents' views of their experience of beginning and ending ATD use. A Basic Social Psychological Process, Starting and Stopping, was identified from 12 interviews. Informants were age 14 to 18, had tried drugs at least 6 times and abstained for at least 6 months. Decision making about drug use was described. Three stages of use that led to decision points were found. If adolescents did not stop use during the beginning stage, Exploratory Use, the adolescents {{had the potential to}} progress through two additional stages of use, Purposeful Use and Intentional Use. The intensity of use increased with each stage. Each stage had identifiable <b>triggers</b> and <b>barriers</b> that had the potential to influence continued ATD use. Curiosity was a strong stimulus for beginning drug use and then exploring never-used-before drugs. An intervening dramatic event moved adolescents more quickly toward stopping. Future orientation was present as informants stopped drug use. Decisional points were characterized by the integration of what adolescents felt were benefits of use (friend relationships, liking the experience, learning about drugs, getting relief from perceived problems) and barriers to continued use (no continued interest, not liking the experience, goals obtained, effect on relationships, effect on future, dramatic event). A Basic Social Structural Process was beginning to emerge. The structural process included drug availability, peer drug use and societal environment. The theory of adolescent decision-making about ATD use provides an opportunity for health professionals to better understand adolescent drug use...|$|R
40|$|Performance-limiting {{magnetohydrodynamic}} (MHD) instabilities on ASDEX Upgrade are discussed. In {{the conventional}} H-mode scenario, the main MHD performance limitation {{is found to}} be the neoclassical tearing mode (NTM). The onset beta of NTMs in ASDEX Upgrade scales with the poloidal ion gyroradius, in agreement with theoretical expectations. At higher beta values, NTMs occur in a more benign form, the frequently-interrupted-regime NTMs, which lead to a smaller confinement degradation than normal NTMs. Active control of NTMs by electron cyclotron current drive in the island has been demonstrated on ASDEX Upgrade. In advanced tokamak regimes with reversed shear, a variety of performance-limiting instabilities has been observed. The shear reversal zone can be unstable to double tearing modes or to infernal modes; both have been identified in ASDEX Upgrade. Due to the broad current profile in advanced tokamak discharges, the ideal external kink mode can be unstable at relatively low beta(N) {{less than or equal to}} 2; this is a main limitation to strongly reversed shear discharges with peaked pressure profiles. Finally, it is shown that fast-particle-driven modes such as fishbones can also have beneficial effects, such as providing stationary current profiles or <b>triggering</b> internal transport <b>barriers...</b>|$|R
