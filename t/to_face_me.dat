25|$|In {{his recent}} book 'Back to the Mark' the fast bowler had written 'I try to hit a batsman in the rib-cage when I bowl a {{purposeful}} bouncer and I want it to hurt {{so much that the}} batsman doesn't want <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>me</b> any more'. How well he had succeeded in Edrich's case! The irony of his pyrrhic victory was that Edrich had not been felled by a bouncer...The English press greeted the incident with headlines such as: 'Licence to Kill!', 'Lillee should be banned' â€“ '007, James Bond cricket'. The atmosphere {{on and off the field}} was emotionally electric. Bodyline was freely discussed. In the background the crowd, lusting for more blood and guts, stirred the embers of controversy chanting for 'Lillee, Lillee'.|$|E
2500|$|Following the Test Jones criticised the Welsh referee Derek Bevan for disallowing a {{try that}} would have won Australia the Test and the series stating, [...] "When David Campese plays badly, he has <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>me.</b> Who does Derek Bevan have to answer to?" [...] Jones told the Australian press that Campese's {{mistakes}} [...] "stuck out like a lighthouse in a lily pond", adding, [...] "I {{have a very high}} estimation of David Campese. I hope I don't have to do any revision." ...|$|E
60|$|She swung round <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>me,</b> her dose-set eyes ablaze with anger.|$|E
60|$|The {{lady said}} nothing, {{and the child}} turned her <b>face</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> again.|$|R
6000|$|She {{turned away}} with a meek [...] "Thank you," [...] and found herself <b>face</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> with <b>me.</b> My heart smote me when I saw how poor were her clothes, and how thin her features.|$|R
6000|$|He {{touched her}} arm, and they stopped again, <b>face</b> <b>to</b> <b>face.</b> 'Tell <b>me</b> what {{difference}} exactly you see,' he said. 'I am quite myself again now, honestly; {{please tell me}} just the very worst you think.' ...|$|R
60|$|But, try as he would, {{the panel}} would yield neither to cunning nor force, so that {{eventually}} {{he gave it}} up and turned <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I thought I heard Hiram's voice," [...] Archie said, {{wheeling}} about <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>me,</b> for he {{had understood}} that I would have him believe a stranger had come.|$|E
6000|$|... "But then, I {{have plenty}} of time," [...] I said agreeably. [...] "And the real {{difficulty}} {{is to get the}} facts <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>me.</b> Dear me, if only, now, I had some of Miss Bowater's brains." ...|$|E
60|$|NORA [involuntarily]. Oh you brute! to tell <b>me</b> that <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>face.</b>|$|R
60|$|Verrall's fingers {{played on}} the cloth for a space. Then he turned his <b>face</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> again.|$|R
60|$|It made {{my blood}} run cold <b>to</b> have him <b>face</b> <b>me</b> with that vicious look and those glaring eyes. One prod of those horns and {{all would be}} over.|$|R
6000|$|... "Are you {{the son of}} that Samuel Wright who lately {{left home}} to go to Cambridge, and has not yet returned?" [...] the doctor asked, {{releasing}} his hold on Archie's collar that he might wheel about <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
60|$|At the {{announcement}} he straightened suddenly and wheeled round <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>me,</b> inquiry in his glance. My mother, too, half rose, and remained so, staring at me, her amazement at seeing me increased by the strange appearance I presented.|$|E
6000|$|... "So! He's the lad you {{believed}} {{might have a}} leaning toward Toryism," [...] Hiram said sharply as he wheeled about <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>me,</b> and on the instant I understood that he doubted the truth of Seth Jepson's excuse for leaving the company.|$|E
6000|$|... "Absolutely!" [...] {{rejoined the}} other. [...] "You may now leave {{the matter to}} me. And 'twill be friend Mole who will be {{surprised}} to-morrow," [...] he added with a harsh guffaw, [...] "when he finds himself <b>face</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> with <b>me,</b> before a Court of Justice." ...|$|R
60|$|Sir Percival had {{hitherto}} {{remained at}} the inner end of the boat-house with Count Fosco, while I spoke {{to him from the}} door. But the instant Mrs. Catherick's name passed my lips he pushed by the Count roughly, and placed himself <b>face</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> with <b>me</b> under the open daylight.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{thou art}} coward and niddering!" [...] said Eric. [...] "Ospakar Niddering I name thee here before all men! What! thou couldst plot against me--thou couldst waylay me, ten {{to one and}} two ships <b>to</b> one, but <b>face</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> with <b>me</b> alone thou dost not dare to stand? Comrades, look on your lord!--look at Ospakar the Niddering!" ...|$|R
6000|$|He was {{heavier than}} I by many pounds, and so {{weighted}} by the burden he carried that I easily overtook him; {{and at last}} he turned, snarling, <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>me.</b> It was Kho of the tribe of Tsa, the hatchet-men. He recognized me, and with a low growl he threw Lys aside and came for me. [...] "The she is mine," [...] he cried. [...] "I kill! I kill!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{battle is}} not yet fought, King," [...] {{answered}} Hokosa. [...] "To-day I met the lightnings without my medicines, {{and it was a}} little storm; when I am prepared with my medicines and the tempest is great, then I will challenge this white man <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>me</b> yonder, and then in that hour my god shall show his strength and his God shall not be able to save him." ...|$|E
60|$|The last {{traveller}} <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>me</b> was a {{very heavy}} man with a great bullet head and a shock of light hair. His blue eyes had a bold flash, his long mustache drooped, {{and there was something}} about him that I did not like. He wore a huge diamond in the bosom of his flannel shirt, and a leather watch-chain that was thick and strong enough to have held up a town-clock.|$|E
60|$|She {{smiled at}} me. It was {{wonderful}} {{what a difference}} the smile made in her <b>face.</b> <b>To</b> <b>me</b> she seemed at that moment radiantly beautiful.|$|R
6000|$|You {{turn your}} back, {{you turn your}} back, [...] And never your <b>face</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> Alone you take your homeward track, [...] And scorn my company.|$|R
60|$|The {{other night}} I lectured for a Vienna charity; {{and at the}} end of it Livy and I were {{introduced}} to a princess who is aunt to the heir apparent of the imperial throne--a beautiful lady, with a beautiful spirit, and very cordial in her praises of my books and thanks to me for writing them; and glad <b>to</b> meet <b>me</b> <b>face</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> and shake <b>me</b> by the hand--just the kind of princess that adorns a fairy tale and makes it the prettiest tale there is.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. It {{makes all}} the difference. When he tries to follow we, he is dangerous; {{when he tries to}} avoid me, it becomes my work in life to follow him. I must keep him in sight every minute now. I must quicken his conscience. I must make him FEEL his own desperate wickedness. He is afraid to face me: that means remorse. The more I compel him <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>me,</b> the more the remorse is sure to deepen." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{still held}} {{in my hand}} the long clasp-knife with which I had opened the shutter. I was unshaven and grimed from {{a week on the}} roads. Altogether, there are few people who would have cared <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>me</b> alone at one in the morning; but this woman, if I had been her lover meeting her by appointment, could not have looked upon me with a more {{welcoming}} eye. She laid her hand upon my sleeve and drew me into the room.|$|E
60|$|All this he boomed {{forth like}} a {{professor}} addressing his class. He had swung round his revolving chair so as <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>me,</b> and he sat all puffed out like an enormous bull-frog, his head laid back and his eyes half-covered by supercilious lids. Now he suddenly turned himself sideways, and all I could see of him was tangled hair with a red, protruding ear. He was scratching about among the litter of papers upon his desk. He faced me presently {{with what looked like}} a very tattered sketch-book in his hand.|$|E
60|$|All this time, Mr. Micawber had {{not known}} me in the least, though he had stood <b>face</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> with <b>me.</b> But now, seeing me smile, he {{examined}} my features with more attention, fell back, cried, 'Is it possible! Have I the pleasure of again beholding Copperfield!' and shook me by both hands with the utmost fervour.|$|R
6000|$|He {{turned his}} <b>face</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> smiling; and inquired if I {{had ever heard}} the phrase, [...] "the eyelids of the dawn." [...] "There's Night, too," [...] he said.|$|R
60|$|Ancient history, all, told me by Kim on {{the long}} ride, and he {{struggled}} with his <b>face</b> <b>to</b> hear <b>me</b> parrot his teaching.|$|R
60|$|She {{had been}} {{down on her}} knees for some little time past, {{carefully}} removing the last weather-stains left about the inscription while we were speaking together. The first sentence of the words I had just addressed to her made her pause in her occupation, and turn slowly without rising from her knees, so as <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>me.</b> The second sentence literally petrified her. The cloth she had been holding dropped from her hands--her lips fell apart--all the little colour that there was naturally in her face left it in an instant.|$|E
6000|$|I {{took care}} to place myself in such a {{position}} that <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>me</b> he had to turn {{his back on the}} hotel across the road. I believe he was glad I was there to talk to. But I thought there was some misapprehension in the first statement he shot out at me without loss of time, that Captain Anthony had been glad to see him. It was indeed difficult to believe that, directly he opened the door, his wife's [...] "sailor-brother" [...] had positively shouted: [...] "Oh, it's you! The very man I wanted to see." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, it is; and you'll find {{it to be}} {{the opinion}} of any man or woman that you may ask who knows {{anything}} about such things. And I'll tell you what, Master Maule, if you think you're going <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>me</b> down you'll find yourself mistaken. Stop a moment, and just listen to me. You haven't a much better friend than I am, and I'm sure she hasn't a better friend than my wife. All this has taken place under our roof, and I mean to speak my mind plainly. What do you propose to do about your marriage?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{instant she}} turned to thank me, I stood rooted to the spot. There was the {{original}} of the photographic portrait in the dressing-case! there was my husband's mother, standing <b>face</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> with <b>me!</b> I recognized the quaint little gray curls, the gentle, genial expression, the mole {{at the corner of}} the mouth. No mistake was possible. His mother herself! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He told <b>me</b> that, <b>face</b> <b>to</b> face--told <b>me</b> {{that it was}} {{the anniversary}} of the day on which you had consented to become his mistress!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, no. I don't {{believe he}} has the nerve to sail closer to the wind than the law allows, and really, at bottom, {{notwithstanding}} all I know of him, I think he's an honest man. It's only behind his back that I have any doubts about him; when he's there <b>face</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> with <b>me</b> I succumb to his charm. I can believe nothing to his discredit.' ...|$|R
