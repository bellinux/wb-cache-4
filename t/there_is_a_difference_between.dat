5|$|The school vacated {{the entire}} 199293 season and every game it played from the 199596 season through the 199899 season. This {{included}} the 1997 National Invitation Tournament title and the 1998 Big Ten Tournament title. It also vacated its two Final Four games in 1992 and its entire NCAA tournament record in 1993, 1996 and 1998. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> forfeiting {{a game and}} vacating a game; a vacated game does not result in the other school being credited with a win. This included virtually the entire career of Fisher's successor, Brian Ellerbe. However, it did not include all games that Webber played or was eligible because all but the final two games of his freshman year were retained.|$|E
5|$|A careful {{examination}} of Facsimile No. 2 shows that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> {{most of the}} hieroglyphic signs and the signs on the right third of the figure on the outer edge {{as well as the}} outer portions of the sections numbered 12–15. These signs are hieratic, not hieroglyphic, and are inverted, or upside down, {{to the rest of the}} text. In fact, they are a fairly accurate copy of lines 2, 3, and 4 of the Joseph Smith Papyrus XI, which contains a portion of the Book of Breathings. Especially clear is the word snsn, in section 14, and part of the name of the mother of the owner of the papyrus, (tay-)uby.t, repeated twice on the outer edge. An ink drawing of the hypocephalus in the Church Historian's office shows these same areas as being blank. It is likely that these portions were destroyed on the original hypocephalus and someone (the engraver, one of Joseph Smith's associates, or Joseph himself) copied the lines from the Book of Breathings papyrus for aesthetic purposes.|$|E

5|$|Standard cards can be {{purchased}} at vending machines within all Metrorail stations, at Metro sales offices, selected retail stores, and online. The purchase price includes $2 for the card itself plus an initial fare value, which varies depending on where they are purchased: cards purchased at stations cost $10 ($2 for the card and $8 fare value), while those purchased online cost either $10 or $30 ($2 for the card and $8 or $28 fare value). The cards can be reloaded using farecard vending machines or using cash at fareboxes onboard buses. Until 2016, riders could also add value to their SmarTrip cards by trading in paper farecards (a used farecard up to $20, or an unused farecard of any value). <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> SmarTrip and CharmCard on the maximum value that can be stored on the card. SmarTrip can store up to $300 in value, while CharmCard can store up to $200.|$|E

25|$|This thought {{experiment}} has two purposes. First, it {{is intended}} to show that qualia exist. If one agrees with the thought experiment, we believe that Mary gains something after she leaves the room—that she acquires knowledge of a particular thing that she did not possess before. That knowledge, Jackson argues, is knowledge of the quale that corresponds to the experience of seeing red, and it must thus be conceded that qualia are real properties, since <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> a person who has access to a particular quale and one who does not.|$|E
25|$|In Germany every {{federal state}} {{has its own}} civil {{protection}} laws thus they have different rank systems. Additionally <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> a rank and an official position. This is founded on the military traditions of the fire departments. Every firefighter can hold a high rank without having an official position. A firefighter can be promoted by years of service, training skills and qualifications. Official positions are partly elected or given by capabilities. These conditions allow that older ordinary firefighters have higher ranks than their leaders. But through this ranks are no authorities given (Brevet).|$|E
25|$|A {{systematic}} error or bias occurs when <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> the true value (in the population) and the observed value (in the study) from any cause other than sampling variability. An example of {{systematic error}} is if, unknown to you, the pulse oximeter {{you are using}} is set incorrectly and adds two points to the true value each time a measurement is taken. The measuring device could be precise but not accurate. Because the error happens in every instance, it is systematic. Conclusions you draw based on that data will still be incorrect. But the error can be reproduced in the future (e.g., by using the same mis-set instrument).|$|E

25|$|At {{the local}} level, there are 6,473 Episcopal congregations, {{each of which}} elects a vestry or bishop's committee. Subject to the {{approval}} of its diocesan bishop, the vestry of each parish elects a priest, called the rector, who has spiritual jurisdiction in the parish and selects assistant clergy, both deacons and priests. (<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> vestry and clergy elections – clergy are ordained members usually selected from outside the parish, whereas any member in good standing of a parish is eligible {{to serve on the}} vestry.) The diocesan bishop, however, appoints the clergy for all missions and may choose to do so for non-self-supporting parishes.|$|E
25|$|Ramsey in {{his article}} disagrees with Keynes's {{approach}} as for him <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> the notions of probability in physics and in logic. For Ramsey probability {{is not related to}} a disembodied body of knowledge but is related to the knowledge that each individual possesses alone. Thus personal beliefs that are formulated by this individual knowledge govern probabilities, leading to the notions of subjective probability and Bayesian probability. Consequently, subjective probabilities can be inferred by observing actions that reflect individuals' personal beliefs. Ramsey argued that the degree of probability that an individual attaches to a particular outcome can be measured by finding what odds the individual would accept when betting on that outcome.|$|E
25|$|Hauerwas {{believes}} that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> {{the concept of}} death and the criteria for death. The concept of death “involves a philosophical judgment of a significant change {{that has happened in}} a person” and therefore “is a correlative of what one takes to be the necessary condition of human life, e.g., … the potential for consciousness”. The criteria of death, however, are “those empirical measurements that can be made to determine whether a person is dead, such as cessation of respiration or a flat EEG”. Thus, brain death is a criterion of death that may serve “as a symbol of when it is time to die”. A person must not delay death so long that it is no longer possible to die a good death.|$|E

25|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> {{the form}} of Anglo-Cornish spoken in west Cornwall and that found in areas further east. In the eastern areas, {{the form of}} English that the {{formerly}} Cornish-speaking population learnt was the general south-western dialect, picked up primarily through relatively local trade and other communications {{over a long period}} of time. In contrast, in western areas, the language was learned from English as used by the clergy and landed classes, some of whom had been educated at the English universities of Oxford and Cambridge. English was learned relatively late across the western half of Cornwall (see map above) and this was a more Modern English style of language, since the standard form itself was undergoing changes. Particularly in the west, the Cornish language substrate left characteristic markers in the Anglo-Cornish dialect.|$|E
25|$|The European {{influence}} on Cuba's later musical development {{is represented by}} danzón, an elegant musical form that was once more popular than the Son in Cuba. It is a descendent of the creollized Cuban contradanza. The danzón marks the change from the communal sequence dance style of the late 18th century to the couple dances of later times. The stimulus for this was {{the success of the}} once-scandalous walz, where couples danced facing each other, independently from other couples and not as part of a pre-set structure. The danzón was the first Cuban dance to adopt such methods, though <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> the two dances. The walz is a progressive ballroom dance where couples move round the floor in an anti-clockwise direction; the danzón is a 'pocket-handkerchief' dance where a couple stays within a small area of the floor.|$|E
25|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> {{a barrel}} of oil, which {{is a measure of}} oil, and {{a barrel of}} oil {{equivalent}} (BOE), which is a measure of energy. Many sources of energy, such as fission, solar, wind, and coal, are not subject to the same near-term supply restrictions that oil is. Accordingly, even an oil source with an EROEI of 0.5 can be usefully exploited if the energy required to produce that oil comes from a cheap and plentiful energy source. Availability of cheap, but hard to transport, natural gas in some oil fields has led to using natural gas to fuel enhanced oil recovery. Similarly, natural gas in huge amounts is used to power most Athabasca tar sands plants. Cheap natural gas has also led to ethanol fuel produced with a net EROEI of less than 1, although figures in this area are controversial because methods to measure EROEI are in debate.|$|E
