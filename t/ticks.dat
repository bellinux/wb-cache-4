5|$|In general, <b>ticks</b> are to {{be found}} {{wherever}} their host species occur. Migrating birds carry <b>ticks</b> with them on their journeys; a study of migratory birds passing through Egypt found more than half the bird species examined were carrying <b>ticks.</b> The species of tick often differed between the autumn and spring migrations, probably because of the seasonal periodicities of the different species.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ticks</b> {{are small}} arachnids, {{part of the}} order Parasitiformes. Along with mites, they {{constitute}} the subclass Acari. <b>Ticks</b> are ectoparasites (external parasites), living by feeding on the blood of mammals, birds, and sometimes reptiles and amphibians. <b>Ticks</b> had evolved by the Cretaceous period, {{the most common form}} of fossilisation being immersed in amber. <b>Ticks</b> are widely distributed around the world, especially in warm, humid climates.|$|E
5000|$|The Asian blue <b>tick,</b> (Rhipicephalus microplus), is an {{economically}} important <b>tick</b> that parasitises {{a variety of}} livestock species.

5|$|<b>Ticks</b> {{have four}} stages to their lifecycle, namely egg, larva, nymph, and adult. Ixodid <b>ticks</b> have three hosts, taking {{at least a}} year to {{complete}} their lifecycle. Argasid <b>ticks</b> have up to seven nymphal stages (instars), each one requiring a blood meal. Because of their habit of ingesting blood, <b>ticks</b> are vectors of at least twelve diseases that affect humans and other animals.|$|E
5|$|Argasid <b>ticks,</b> unlike ixodid <b>ticks,</b> may {{go through}} {{up to seven}} nymphal stages (instars), {{requiring}} a meal of blood each time. Their life cycles range from months to years. The adult female argasid tick can lay a few hundred to over a thousand eggs {{over the course of}} her lifetime. Larvae feed very quickly and detach to molt into nymphs. Both male and female adults feed on blood, and they mate off the host. During feeding, any excess fluid is excreted by the coxal glands, a process which is unique to argasid <b>ticks.</b>|$|E
5|$|Both ixodid and argasid <b>ticks</b> {{have four}} {{lifecycle}} stages: egg, larva, nymph, and adult.|$|E
50|$|The Cattle <b>tick,</b> (Rhipicephalus annulatus), is a hard-bodied <b>tick</b> of {{the genus}} Rhipicephalus. It {{is also known as}} North American cattle <b>tick,</b> North American Texas fever <b>tick,</b> and Texas fever <b>tick.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Dermacentor reticulatus, {{also known}} as the ornate cow <b>tick,</b> ornate dog <b>tick,</b> meadow <b>tick</b> and marsh <b>tick,</b> is a species of <b>tick</b> from the family Ixodidae. It is the type species for the Dermacentor genus.|$|R
50|$|Colorado <b>tick</b> fever (CTF) (also called {{mountain}} <b>tick</b> fever, American <b>tick</b> fever, and American mountain <b>tick</b> fever) is a {{viral infection}} (Coltivirus) transmitted from {{the bite of}} an infected Rocky Mountain wood <b>tick</b> (Dermacentor andersoni). It {{should not be confused}} with the bacterial tick-borne infection, Rocky Mountain spotted fever.|$|R
5|$|Common {{blackbirds}} {{spend much}} of their time looking for food on the ground where they can become infested with <b>ticks,</b> which are external parasites that most commonly attach to the head of a blackbird. In France, 74% of rural blackbirds were found to be infested with Ixodes <b>ticks,</b> whereas, only 2% of blackbirds living in urban habitats were infested. This is partly because it is more difficult for <b>ticks</b> to find another host on lawns and gardens in urban areas than in uncultivated rural areas, and partly because <b>ticks</b> are likely to be commoner in rural areas, where a variety of tick hosts, such as foxes, deer and boar, are more numerous. Although ixodid <b>ticks</b> can transmit pathogenic viruses and bacteria, and are known to transmit Borrelia bacteria to birds, {{there is no evidence that}} this affects the fitness of blackbirds except when they are exhausted and run down after migration.|$|E
5|$|Common ixodid <b>ticks</b> {{collected}} from impala include Amblyomma hebraeum, Boophilus decoloratus, Hyalomma marginatum, Ixodes cavipalpus, Rhipicephalus appendiculatus and R. evertsi. In Zimbabwe, heavy infestation by <b>ticks</b> such as R. appendiculatus {{has proved to}} be a major cause behind the high mortality of ungulates, as they can lead to tick paralysis. Impala have special adaptations for grooming, such as their characteristic dental arrangement, to manage <b>ticks</b> before they engorge; however, the extensive grooming needed to keep the tick load under control involves the risk of dehydration during summer, lower vigilance against predators and gradual wearing out of the teeth. A study showed that impala adjust the time devoted to grooming and the number of grooming bouts according to the seasonal prevalence of <b>ticks.</b>|$|E
5|$|For an {{ecosystem}} to support <b>ticks,</b> it must satisfy two requirements: the population density of host {{species in the}} area must be high enough, and humidity must be high enough for <b>ticks</b> to remain hydrated. Due to their role in transmitting Lyme disease, ixodid <b>ticks,</b> particularly the North American I.scapularis, have been studied using geographic information systems to develop predictive models for ideal tick habitats. According to these studies, certain features of a given microclimate – such as sandy soil, hardwood trees, rivers, {{and the presence of}} deer – were determined to be good predictors of dense tick populations.|$|E
5000|$|The Yellow Dog <b>Tick,</b> (Haemaphysalis leachi), is a hard-bodied <b>tick</b> of {{the genus}} Haemaphysalis. It {{is also known as}} African dog <b>tick,</b> or simply as dog <b>tick</b> {{in many parts of the}} world.|$|R
25|$|In Europe, {{the vector}} is Ixodes ricinus, {{which is also}} called the sheep <b>tick</b> or castor bean <b>tick.</b> In China, Ixodes persulcatus (the taiga <b>tick)</b> is {{probably}} the most important vector. In North America, the black-legged <b>tick</b> or deer <b>tick</b> (Ixodes scapularis) is the main vector on the East Coast.|$|R
5000|$|Tick: An {{addition}} to a personal list (sometimes qualified as year <b>tick,</b> county <b>tick,</b> etc.). Life <b>tick</b> and lifer are synonymous. A tart's <b>tick</b> is a relatively common species added to one's list later than might be expected.|$|R
5|$|Mites and {{nematodes}} feed on <b>ticks,</b> {{which are}} also a minor nutritional resource for birds. More importantly, they carry diseases as the primary hosts of pathogens such as spirochaetes, and without their agency, the organisms could not reach their secondary hosts. The diseases caused may debilitate their victims, and <b>ticks</b> may thus be assisting in controlling animal populations and preventing overgrazing.|$|E
5|$|Not all <b>ticks</b> in an infective {{area are}} {{infected}} with pathogens, and both attachment of the tick and a long-feeding session seem to be necessary for transmission of these diseases to take place. Thus tick bites often do not lead to infection, especially if the <b>ticks</b> are removed within 36 hours. Adult <b>ticks</b> can be removed with fine-tipped tweezers or proprietary tick removal tools, disinfecting the wound. It is also possible to freeze them off with a medical wart remover. If the tick's head and mouthparts break off during removal, they can be removed with tweezers like a splinter.|$|E
5|$|Some species, {{notably the}} Australian {{paralysis}} tick, are also intrinsically venomous {{and can cause}} tick paralysis. Eggs can become infected with pathogens inside a female tick's ovaries, {{in which case the}} larval <b>ticks</b> are infectious immediately at hatching, before feeding on their first host. Tropical bont <b>ticks</b> transmit the rickettsial disease heartwater which can be particularly devastating in cattle. The <b>ticks</b> carried by migratory birds may act as reservoirs and vectors of infectious diseases. Over twenty strains of pathogenic virus were found in the autumn in the Egyptian migratory bird study.|$|E
50|$|Other genera with {{species that}} are often of high local {{importance}} to domestic animals include these examples: Ixodes (Ixodes ricinus, the deer <b>tick</b> of Europe; Ixodes scapularis, the black-legged <b>tick</b> of North America; Ixodes holocyclus, the paralysis <b>tick</b> of Australia). Haemaphysalis (Ha. leachii, the yellow dog <b>tick</b> of the tropics). Dermacentor (Dermacentor andersoni, the Rocky Mountain wood tick; Dermacentor variabilis, the American dog tick; D. reticulatus, the ornate dog <b>tick</b> of Europe). Dermacentor nitens the tropical horse <b>tick</b> of the Americas has a one-host lifecycle similar to the boophilids. Margaropus winthemi, the beady-legged <b>tick,</b> infests horses and cattle in South Africa. The soft <b>tick</b> Otobius megnini, the spinose ear <b>tick,</b> has its nymphs feeding within the ear canal of many species of domestic animals. Adults of Ot. megnini do not feed. This <b>tick</b> occurs in the Americas and has spread to Africa and Asia.|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} a rare clinical finding of conjunctival <b>tick</b> attachment in a child. A 10 -year-old boy {{presented to the}} clinic with right-eye itch. He {{was found to have}} a live <b>tick</b> firmly attached to his right temporal conjunctiva. The <b>tick</b> was identified as the larval stage of the paralysis <b>tick,</b> Ixodes holocyclus. The <b>tick</b> was removed completely by conjunctival excision. Although various methods of removing a <b>tick</b> have been described in the literature, the goal of treatment is the safe and complete removal of the <b>tick</b> to prevent further transmission of pathogens, allergens, and toxins to the patient...|$|R

5|$|Fleas and <b>ticks</b> {{are common}} causes of {{physical}} irritation. In {{a study in}} Egypt, a species of Hyalomma was dominant in dromedaries, comprising 95.6% of the adult <b>ticks</b> isolated from the camels. In Israel, the number of <b>ticks</b> per camel ranged from 20 to 105. Nine camels in the date palm plantations in Arava Valley were injected with ivermectin, which is not effective against Hyalomma tick infestations. Larvae of the camel nasal fly Cephalopsis titillator can cause possibly fatal brain compression and nervous disorders. Illnesses that can affect dromedary productivity are pyogenic diseases and wound infections caused by Corynebacterium and Streptococcus, pulmonary disorders caused by Pasteurella such as hemorrhagic septicemia and Rickettsia species, camelpox, anthrax, and cutaneous necrosis caused by Streptothrix and deficiency of salt in the diet.|$|E

50|$|The Asian {{tortoise}} <b>tick,</b> (Amblyomma clypeolatum) is a hard-bodied <b>tick</b> of {{the genus}} Amblyomma. The <b>tick</b> is a parasite of tortoises, such as Geochelone elegans, domestic dogs, buffaloes. It is found in India, Sri Lanka and Myanmar. Adult <b>tick</b> is about 3 cm in length.|$|R
25|$|The main {{species of}} Coltivirus, Colorado <b>tick</b> fever virus (CTF), infects the Rocky Mountain wood <b>tick</b> (Dermacentor andersoni). This species of <b>tick</b> {{can be found}} in areas with shrubs, lightly wooded locations, grasslands, and on hiking or biking trails. All life stages of this <b>tick</b> can infect {{vertebrates}} with Colorado <b>tick</b> fever virus (larva, nymph, and adult). Unfortunately, mature D. andersoni prefer to feed on medium or large mammals that are walking around the knee-high plants. Oftentimes, this infection takes place when the <b>tick</b> larvae feed on rodents, like squirrels, that are already infected with virus. The <b>tick's</b> saliva then contains the virus, and it becomes infectious for life. The adult <b>tick</b> then transmits the virus to humans through a bite, where it infects bone marrow cells.|$|R
5000|$|Originally, The <b>Tick's</b> costume {{was meant}} to be brown in color, but it was decided that blue looked better in print. In The <b>Tick</b> vs. The <b>Tick,</b> wherein The <b>Tick</b> is confronted by Barry, an {{unstable}} pseudo-hero who also calls himself [...] "The Tick", Barry wears a brown costume similar to The <b>Tick's.</b> The <b>Tick</b> is named after an arachnid, much like Spider-Man. The logo of the series also resembles that of the 1994 Spider-Man series. According to the live-action series, The <b>Tick</b> is 6 feet 6 inches tall, weighs 230 pounds (6 inches and 170 pounds less than his dimensions in the comic), and has blue hair and eyes.|$|R
5|$|Impala are symbiotically {{related to}} oxpeckers, which feed on <b>ticks</b> from {{those parts of}} the antelope's body which the animal cannot access by itself (such as the ears, neck, eyelids, {{forehead}} and underbelly). The impala is the smallest ungulate with which oxpeckers are associated. In a study it was observed that oxpeckers selectively attended to impala despite the presence of other animals such as Coke's hartebeest, Grant's gazelle, Thompson's gazelle and topi. A possible explanation for this could be that because the impala inhabits woodlands (which can have a high density of <b>ticks),</b> the impala could have greater mass of <b>ticks</b> per unit area of the body surface. Another study showed that the oxpeckers prefer the ears over other parts of the body, probably because these parts show maximum tick infestation.|$|E
5|$|Several ectoparasites {{which can}} affect both {{survival}} and reproductive fitness {{have been found}} on the yellow-faced honeyeater; the mites Ptilonyssus meliphagae and Ptilonyssus thymanzae and Ixodes species <b>ticks.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Ticks</b> {{are also}} widely {{distributed}} among host taxa, which include marsupial and placental mammals, birds, reptiles such as snakes, iguanas and lizards, and amphibians.|$|E
5000|$|... 35 & <b>Ticking</b> (also {{known as}} Russ Parr's 35 & <b>Ticking</b> or 35 and <b>Ticking)</b> is an American romantic comedy film written and {{directed}} by Russ Parr.|$|R
50|$|It is {{sometimes}} {{thought of as}} an animal disease. In humans, the primary concern from <b>tick</b> bites is often not the ectoparasitism itself, but {{the potential for the}} <b>tick</b> to transmit disease or <b>tick</b> paralysis.

5000|$|... µC/OS-II {{requires}} that a periodic time source {{be provided to}} keep track of time delays and timeouts. A <b>tick</b> should occur between 10 and 1000 times per second, or Hertz. The faster the <b>tick</b> rate, the more overhead µC/OS-II imposes on the system. The frequency of the clock <b>tick</b> depends on the desired <b>tick</b> resolution of an application. <b>Tick</b> sources can be obtained by dedicating a hardware timer, or by generating an interrupt from an alternating current (AC) power line (50 or 60 Hz) signal. This periodic time source is termed a clock <b>tick.</b>|$|R
