2500|$|However, {{there was}} concern that the GSEs' {{liquidity}} was insufficient to handle growing delinquency rates, such that although viable in September 2008, the scale of loss in the future would be sufficient that insolvency would occur and that knowledge of this future failure would induce immediate or near-immediate failure due to buyers refusing to buy debt. Both GSEs roll over large amounts of debt on a quarterly basis and failure to sell debt would lead to failure {{due to lack of}} liquidity. A slower form of failure would be the issuing of debt at high cost (to compensate buyers for risk), which would greatly diminish the earning power of both GSEs, rendering them unable to earn the money they would need to handle expected future losses. Both GSEs counted large amounts of deferred <b>tax</b> <b>assets</b> towards their regulatory capital, which were considered by some to be of [...] "low quality" [...] and not truly available capital. The deferred <b>tax</b> <b>assets</b> would only have value if the companies were profitable and could use the assets to offset future taxes.

40|$|Brett Jones is {{a senior}} {{accountant}} with the accounting firm of BGW. On a recent audit engagement, Brett was assigned the task of evaluating the deferred tax accounting for Packer Inc. The company, founded in 1962, is a large heavy machinery manufacturer. Packer’s balance sheet at December 31, 1997 includes a deferred <b>tax</b> <b>asset</b> of approximately $ 22 million related to net future deductible temporary differences. However, realization of the deferred <b>tax</b> <b>asset</b> is dependent upon profitable operations in the U. S. and abroad, and future reversals of existing temporary differences. Although realization is not assured, Packer management {{in the past has}} been pretty sure that such benefits will be realized through the reduction of future taxable income. Management has carefully considered various factors in assessing the probability of realizing these deferred tax benefits. Brett recalls the complexity surrounding the judgmental nature of accounting for deferred taxes under generally accepted accounting principles. Under Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 109 (FAS 109), Packer could be required to record a deferred <b>tax</b> <b>asset</b> for future deductible amounts and carry-forwards and record a valuation allowance, if {{it is likely that the}} <b>tax</b> <b>asset</b> will not be realized. Brett also recalls that FAS 109 provides some examples of negative evidence to support recording a valuation allowance, and positive evidence to avoid recording a valuation allowance.

40|$|South African {{companies}} have, in the past, not recognised {{an asset}} for unused Secondary Tax on Companies ("STC") credits. AC 501, Accounting for "Secondary Tax on Companies (STC) ", which is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2004, now requires South African companies to recognise a deferred <b>tax</b> <b>asset</b> for unused STC credits, {{to the extent}} that it is probable that an entity will declare dividends of its own, against which the unused STC credits can be utilised. In terms of AC 501 and IAS 12 (AC 102), Income Taxes (the local and international accounting standard on income taxes), the recognition of a liability to pay STC has to be postponed until the declaration of a dividend. Some accounting commentators have indicated that they find it anomalous to recognise a deferred <b>tax</b> <b>asset</b> in respect of unused STC credits, while no liability is recognised for the STC that would be payable on the future distribution of retained earnings. The objective of the study is to consider whether it is conceptually anomalous to recognise a deferred <b>tax</b> <b>asset</b> for unused STC credits while no liability is raised for the STC that would become payable on future dividend declarations on profits already recognised in the financial statements. The study concludes that it is conceptually anomalous to recognise a deferred <b>tax</b> <b>asset</b> for unused STC credits when no corresponding liability is raised...|$|R

40|$|The {{provisions}} of SFAS No. 109 allow U. S. companies {{to make an}} earnings big bath even bigger through {{the establishment of a}} deferred tax valuation allowance. At the time a firm recognizes a non-cash charge, it also recognizes a deferred <b>tax</b> <b>asset</b> to represent the future tax benefits of the charge. Recognition of the deferred <b>tax</b> <b>asset</b> partially mitigates the negative earnings impact of the special charge. However, if the firm does not expect to have sufficient future taxable income to utilize the future tax benefits of the charge, SFAS No. 109 requires the firm to establish a deferred tax valuation allowance, effectively eliminating the recognized deferred <b>tax</b> <b>asset.</b> Thus, the establishment of the valuation allowance amplifies the negative earnings impact of the non-cash charge. We use a valuation allowance prediction model to identify firms that create a larger-than-expected valuation allowance; these firms may be creating a large valuation allowance as a reserve to be used to manage earnings in a subsequent period. We find {{that the vast majority of}} these larger-than-expected valuation allowances apparently reflect informed management pessimism about the future in that these firms actually do have poorer operating performance in subsequent periods. Nonetheless, we also identify a specific set of firms that appear to have used a subsequent reduction in the valuation allowance to change a reported loss into a reported profit...|$|R
