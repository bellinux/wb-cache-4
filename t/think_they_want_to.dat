500|$|Barkley is {{an outspoken}} {{supporter}} of gay rights. In 2006, he told Fox Sports: [...] "I'm a big advocate of gay marriage. If {{they want to}} get married, God bless them." [...] Speaking to Wolf Blitzer on CNN two years later, he said: [...] "Every time I hear the word 'conservative,' it makes me sick to my stomach, because they're really just fake Christians, as I call them. That's all they are. ... I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be judge and jury. Like, I'm for gay marriage. It's none of my business if gay people want to get married. I'm pro-choice. And I think these Christians, first of all, they're not supposed to judge other people. But they're the most hypocritical judge of people we have in the country. And it bugs the hell out of me. They act like they're Christians. They're not forgiving at all." [...] During a 2011 Martin Luther King, Jr. Day double-header on TNT, Barkley responded to a statement made by Dr. King's daughter Bernice, by saying, [...] "People try to make it about black and white. [...] he talked about equality for every man, every woman. We have a thing going on now, people discriminating against homosexuality in this country. I love the homosexuality people.

The two writers tried to collaborate on a play, Mule Bone, but things went sour: “They fought over copyright issues, but I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> be friends,” says Shallal.

People were looking on, on either side, between the door and the cab--great crowds of people, peering eagerly forward; and two more men in blue suits were holding them off by main force from surging against me and incommoding me. I don't <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> hurt me: it was rather curiosity than anger I saw in their faces. But I was afraid, and shrank back. They were eager to see me, however, and pressed forward with loud cries, so that the men in blue suits had hard work to prevent them.|$|R

If they do stop, out of fear or whatever, they go at once into such a state of euphoria and well-being that they become over-confident.

However, in regards to musicians endorsing political candidates, Joel has said, [...] "People who pay for your tickets, I don't <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> hear who you're going to vote for and how you think they should vote."

40|$|Most biology {{students}} have limited exposure to research {{since this is}} not a public activity and the pace of science does not lend itself to television dramatization. In contrast, medicine is the subject of numerous TV shows, and students’ experience visiting doctors may lead them to <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> become physicians. One effective way to encourage these students to consider a research career is to invite engaging scientists to speak about their career paths and lives during class.

Frivolous, because the validity of any conclusions drawn from this statistic is undermined by many considerations. The number of times an article is accessed does not measure how many people actually read it, nor, for most articles, is it any indication of how much it will be cited (itself an imperfect measure of importance) : it is most likely to reflect what people <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> read about.

40|$|In Western culture, the pervading {{medical model}} of {{disability}} has characterized disability {{as a problem}} {{in need of a}} solution: an unwanted condition that demands a cure. Even the word “disability” is unavoidably negative: structurally it signifies a loss or a lack, a state that exists only because it falls short of something better. Contrary to mainstream thinking, disability is not a natural state of inferiority or a stroke of misfortune; rather, disability is a culturally fabricated narrative of embodiment. As Scully (2008) observes, representations of disability, created in the main by non-disabled people, tell normative bodies what they want to know – or <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> know about non-disabled people. Arts-based mediums have the potential to effect positive change and alter prevailing perceptions of embodiment. Disability arts provide individuals living with disabilities with opportunities to communicate their perspectives in sustainable ways and speak back to culturally dominant images and stories. One such initiative, Project Re•Vision, uses the power of arts-informed research to tell stories from the position and leadership of those who embody difference. In doing so, the project seeks to challenge conventional understandings of disability as an ailment to be cured. Although much academic discussion has focused on arts-informed research ethics, there has been little consideration of the ethics of conducting “disability” arts-informed research. Our paper will therefore explore what is distinct about disability arts-informed research, as well as the unique ethical issues that arise when working with non-normative bodies...|$|E
5000|$|In January 2014, Wilson {{clarified}} {{that he did}} {{not write}} any material with Beck, and that Beck would only be a guest performer. The next month, Beck intimated on the project's status: [...] "I’m not sure. As far as I know, they made a mistake by grabbing me for a tour and opening up the floodgates for a tour prematurely instead of finishing the tracks. And so we left the studio with half-finished tracks-three, four tracks I was supposed to be on and they’re still unfinished. And to me it was a bit stupid because they should have done the album, had a killer album, and then gone out on the road. But I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> grab me while I was still available. That’s about it." ...|$|R

Hurley later said, [...] "they absolutely hated it, I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> fire me, {{and they would have}} if I didn't have a guaranteed contract". He rewrote the script, and this version was filmed. Hurley was pleased with the result, saying that [...] "everything about that episode worked". The final version differed significantly from the original Reaves-Duane script; Duane later said that only two scenes remained: where Picard sees his mother, and where he nearly falls out of the turbolift into space. Reaves later said that the episode [...] "came together much better on the screen than we thought it would when we read the script. We were lucky, because it was out of our hands".|$|R
