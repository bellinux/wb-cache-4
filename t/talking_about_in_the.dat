500|$|Veronica Mars was one {{of roughly}} five series being {{considered}} for cancellation by the network in 2007. At The CW's upfront conference, critic Michael Ausiello asked Ostroff {{about the fate of}} the show. She responded that Thomas and Bell could work together on another show for the network, but she thought that this possibility was unlikely. She said that [...] "it could come back in some form, but I don't know what form that would be". Thomas responded, [...] "I assume that anything Dawn would be <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> realm of a Rob–Kristen project would involve a new from-scratch pilot as they don't have me in a deal, and they'll lose Kristen in a couple of weeks." ...|$|E

It's a movie about Hitchcock that ignores his best advice: 'Suspense is like a woman. The more left to the imagination, the more the excitement. Richard Brody of The New Yorker also gave the film a negative review, writing that, {{instead of being a}} drama, the film is an unoriginal work of criticism which [...] "points to what everyone ought already to have been <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first place: not least, that it's no surprise to learn that a filmmaker whose art is devoted to pain, fear, control, and sexual obsession also experienced and inflicted them in life". On the day of its UK premiere, James Rampton of The Independent wrote that The Girl was [...] "no mere black-and-white hatchet job on Hitch. It does not seek to portray him as an unambiguous monster; rather, it highlights the profound psychological damage that plagued the director throughout his life". The Guardians Deborah Orr was generally positive about the film: [...] "here was only one thing wrong with The Girl. There was no Hitchcock in the director's chair to make it the utterly compelling psychological drama that it could have been." ...|$|E

50|$|One day, Fe falls {{madly in}} love with Sergio Grimán (Jorge Reyes), a legal {{assistant}} who failed to finish Law school due to several family problems. Gloria's bitterness towards her friend intensifies when her mother Alicia (Loly Sanchez) reveals that Fe is her half-sister after she had an affair with Chon, Fe's father who previously worked for them as a chauffeur. Her hatred and envy for her friend grows everyday when she realizes that Fe will have everything that she cannot have: half of her fortune and the love of Sergio, with whom Gloria has also developed an attraction to. She therefore develops a plan to disinherit Fe and steal away the man that she loves. Considering that her late father put a clause in his will that she can only receive her inheritance once she is married, Gloria begins the process of seducing Sergio and steal him away from her friend. The only person who is a ware of her plans is Elias Grimán (Juan Carlos Vivas), a handsome young priest who tires to counsel Gloria to find it in her heart and forgive her friend. It is only later that Fr. Elias discovers that the woman Gloria has been <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> secrecy of confession is his brother's girlfriend and future fiance, Fe.|$|E

50|$|Peter Molyneux {{said the}} {{following}} on the issue:After Fable, {{there was a}} pretty dark time where people looked at the game and compared it with what I said in the press, and they felt cheated. I realised that we just couldn't keep on doing that. But that {{was very much a}} reflection of how we worked, because what I was <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> press was what we were experimenting with at that moment, and a lot of those experiments would sort of come out as you were making the game. So I'd be talking about trees growing, and then we'd cut trees growing, and people would, of course, feel cheated. So I made a rule: I will not talk about any concrete mechanics unless I can actually show you them in game. I'll talk about our ambitions to make the best role-playing game of all time, but if you see Fable 2 press you'll see that I talked about stuff as I demoed it. People understandably get enormously upset about it—it's like seeing a trailer for a film and seeing Batman die, but then he doesn't die in the film; it would just be wrong. So I think {{a lot of what we}} do is realise what we’ve done wrong and work to try and make that right. It's far better than thinking that we get things right all the time.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the summer}} of 2001 in Foligno, as the police was {{investigating}} an ongoing phone stalking case, some of the conversations they recorded included suggestions that Narducci's had been killed. Two individuals (one man and one woman) threatened a woman {{that if she did}} not pay what was owed she would end up like [...] "the doctor killed at the lake", and also mentioning links between Narducci and the suspects of the Monster of Florence cases. [...] Subsequent threatening phone calls to the same woman also referred to the [...] "murder of Pacciani" [...] (one of the suspects in the Monster of Florence case who was found dead in suspicious circumstances) and said that both had been killed by members of a secret society for betraying them. Foligno is under the jurisdiction of Perugia prosecuting office. As a matter of routine management inside the office, the investigation file had been handed over by prosecutor Silvia Della Monica, who had started it, to Mignini. The stalkers appeared to know details about the deaths Pacciani and Narducci which were not available to the public. A man was charged of the phone threats case, he pleaded guilty and was sentenced, ending the case (despite the fact that the voice of at least another woman was recorded among the phone stalkers). Mignini meanwhile became interested directly in the issue of Narducci's death, which they were <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> phone calls.|$|E

5000|$|In a February 2012 interview, Sal Abruscato {{confirmed}} that Life of Agony was no more. He explains, [...] "We're not gonna play anymore. We {{moved out of}} our studio. We all kind of feel like we're at the end. We're never gonna make another record, because {{of those kinds of}} problems I was <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> interview - we can't agree on writing a song. And Keith vocals wants to pursue his life and his lifestyle sic. And that's pretty much the reason why also I've moved on and I'm doing my own thing... to just keep going; I didn't want my career to stop with Life of Agony. Life of Agony doesn't tour, Life of Agony doesn't do much. And so we were at a point where it was like... We did the last three shows in July 2011 and then we moved out of our studio, and that's it. I don't foresee anything in the future; I highly doubt it. I don't know how that would happen."In a July 2012 interview with Revolver Magazine, Alan Robert described his attitude towards the state of the band. [...] "I actually don’t think Mina’s transition is the ultimate reason the band isn’t active right now. We’d been doing a lot less touring over the last bunch of years, way before she announced her personal news. I can only speak for myself, but I can say that starting a family has definitely made me want to tour and travel a lot less in general. For that reason in particular, I’m much happier being home working on my comics and film projects. It fulfills my creative needs and allows me to live the life I want to at this stage." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{step-by-step}} presentation {{which is used to}} unravel and to bring certain issues to the fore is not only didactic. It also has a philosophical function which consists in showing that favoured ideas about the relation between law and fact are not tenable if examined under the microscope. It is well known that some legal systems contrast law and fact : for example, they distinguish between legal and factual powers, powers de jure as opposed to powers de facto. By so doing they show {{that they do not have}} the same regard for the former as they do for the latter. This way of looking at the law may give the impression that it hovers in some outer region called by some the world of values, by others the world of « ought » as opposed to « is » (Sollen, Sein) in other words, that the law lies somewhere else than in the realm of facts. But the ways in which legal systems come to be expressed give information only on what they want. They reveal nothing about either their nature or the nature of what they are <b>talking</b> <b>about.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Cap des Tempêtes, the increasingly complicated structures of juridical systems emerge chapter by chapter and from facts alone. This « is » of fact is nothing other than the elementary particle described and analysed at length at the start of this work. Thus, the jureme is defined as follows : « Any appearance, produced by a human being, of a wish to obtain a certain behavioural response in another human being, appearance which is equipped with a mechanism such that as soon as one of the addressees resists, pressure by the threat of a sanction is exerted in the opposite direction ».|$|E
5000|$|The {{music video}} opens with two FBI detectives (played by Eric Roberts and Clarence Williams III) {{on the hunt}} for two diamond thieves (Ja Rule and Charli). It then cuts to Ja Rule and Charli ready to steal a diamond in a mansion at night (with Ja Rule rapping outside a car {{in-between}} scenes). They successfully found the diamonds hidden in the portrait. The owners, an actual married couple, were awakened by the alarm knowing that the hidden diamonds were stolen. The husband then pressed the alert button, calling the police. Ja Rule was able to escape, while his partner, Charli was arrested by the police. The scene then cuts to Charli's interrogation where the elder detective furiously asks the whereabouts of Ja Rule while another detective reveals the crime scene as well as Charli being the one who pulled the crime with Ja assisting her. He then asks where Ja is, along with the elder detective asking in a more furious manner. Charli replies that she doesn't know what they're <b>talking</b> <b>about.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> next verse, Charli, still in the interrogation room raps {{in front of the}} two detectives which then shifts to her in prison. Charli, then makes a phone call to Ja Rule, who is at his own home and replies to her by rapping and singing the next verse. Charli is then released from prison and rides a limo to the airport where she meets Ja Rule in an airplane. It then shifts to the two celebrating Charli's release from prison in a beach. The two were then spotted by the detectives (via binoculars) in the same beach, who were also in vacation. The music video ends with the detectives laughing, complimenting and telling each other that [...] "you are the man" [...] with the white detective saying [...] "I love my job" [...] just as they are about to approach Ja and Charli as the music video for Down 4 U starts.|$|E
5000|$|The Everlasting Man was {{released}} on January 20, 2009 on Strike First Records. The title of the album is taken from the G. K. Chesterton nonfiction work of the same name. The Everlasting Man added more atmospheric textures to their sound, using many different guitar effects and tones woven together with electronic backgrounds while still holding a strong drum and bass foundation. In an interview with Indie Vision Music, Keyboardist Eric Gerrard explained that [...] "We wanted to sing about and affirm value in things that aren’t often <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> current scene today" [...] and that [...] "a lot of our ideas lined up with what Chesterton <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> book (The Everlasting Man)".|$|R

Artists, scholars and activists are likely to face theoretical challenges, like the risk to fall into a ‘politics of recognition’, but also practical ones, from the difficulty for filmmakers to access both funding and the broadcasting industry, to the unequal internet coverage and the issues of the structural reproduction of power through computer-based technologies for digital media users.|$|E
