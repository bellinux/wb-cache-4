5|$|But it {{was also}} during the mint's second tour of duty that women began to find work at the New Orleans Mint.

Thirty-nine worked as adjusters – employees who weighed the unstamped coin planchets <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> were the proper weight before coining. These women would sit at long narrow tables, filing the planchets down to the proper weight, wearing special aprons with pouches attached to the sleeves and the waist to catch the excess dust. Five women served as counters and packers before the coins were shipped to Washington, D.C. Some women were eventually employed at the coining presses.|$|E
