40|$|The {{retinoic acid}} {{receptor}} (RAR) beta 2 (RARbeta 2) is a potent, retinoid-inducible tumor suppressor gene, {{which is a}} critical molecular relay for retinoid actions in cells.

Up to now, no primary mechanism underlying the repression of the RARbeta 2 gene expression, hence affecting cellular retinoid sensitivity, has been identified. Here we demonstrate that the PI 3 K/Akt signaling pathway affects cellular retinoid sensitivity, by regulating corepressor recruitment to the RARbeta 2 promoter. Through direct phosphorylation of the corepressor SMRT, Akt stabilized RAR/SMRT interaction, leading to an increased tethering of SMRT to the RARbeta 2 promoter, decreased histone acetylation, down-regulation of the RARbeta 2 expression and impaired cellular differentiation in response to retinoid.

40|$|International audienceThe Skagafjörður area counts {{several large}} slope mass {{movements}} {{especially on the}} eastern side of the fjord. They are initiated from the top of the rockwall where a more or less developed scars are still observed. A significant number of those landforms have been described by Jónsson (1957), who interpreted those landforms as a result of post-glacial rockwall debuttressing, following the shrinking of the large ice bodies in the early Holocene. However, no attempt of dating has yet been carried out on the debris masses. The aims of this research are to discuss its possible paraglacial origin by combining four dating benchmarks: (i) the dating of a succession of raised beaches on which the rock avalanche material lies. The higher beaches, exceeding 65 m a. s. l., have been dated older than 12000 BP. Beaches between 43 and 50 m a. s. l. have been dated older than 11300 and 9900 BP and beaches at 22 - 31 m a. s. l. between 9900 and 9600 BP. Regression below the present sea level occurred about 9000 BP (Rundgren et al., 1997). As the rock avalanche deposit does not display visible evidence of being impacted by the glacio-isostatic rebound (no inherited sea cliffs are seen at higher elevation than the actual sea level), we estimate the rock avalanche occurred later than 9000 BP. (ii) the tephrochronological dating from the excavations made in the upper part of the mass, where peat areas developed since the setting of the rock avalanche goes back to 4500 years BP, with the H 4 Hekla acid white thick layer found at 140 cm depth. The deposits from Hekla are well known in the area, and the five most common ash layers were discovered in the opened section, providing a significant time marker. (iii) 14 C dating of birches (Betula sp.) trunk and branches pieces found 80 cm below the H 4 layer. The results are not yet available, but the period around 8000 BP is considered at those latitudes as a warm period, favourable to tree development. (iv) basalt samples were collected on the rock avalanche deposit, at various elevations and settings on the deposit, to provide Cosmic Ray Exposure ages. To specify the age of the landslide, we will measure 10 Be within the pyroxene minerals constituting the basalt. Beryllium isotopic ratios will be measured at the laboratory of CEREGE by Accelerator Mass Spectrometry. The results are in progress. Collectively, those chronological benchmarks constrain the <b>trigerring</b> of the rock avalanche event between 9000 BP (present-day sea-level) and 4500 BP (tephrochronology oldest dating). The finding of a large amount of wood long before the H 4 tephra layer suggests that the occurrence of the rock avalanche was closer to the oldest extremity of this time period (so-called early birch period, just around 9000 BP, according to Einarsson 1991, and Óladóttir et al. 2001). Such results comfort the Ólafur Jónsson idea, proposing the occurrence of such mass movement as the result of a rapid paraglacial crisis following the deglaciation period, due to the combined effects of rockwall debuttressing and glacio-isostatic uplift. The cosmogenic and 14 C results will provide a more accurate data for the chronological scenario. References Einarsson Þ., 1991. Geology of Iceland, rocks and landscape.

40|$|Chronic {{lymphocytic}} leukemia (CLL) {{is the most}} common adult leukemia in the Western world. It is an incurable disease, yet very heterogeneous in terms of clinical course and outcome, most probably reflecting underlying biological heterogeneity. Over the last decades, it became obvious that CLL is subdivided in categories with distinct biological characteristics, regarding both the genomic and epigenetic profile (however without certain defects being detected in a large proportion of patients), as well as structural and signaling features of the clonotypic B-cell receptor immunoglobulin (BcR IG) 247. Immunogenetic analysis of the clonotypic BcR IG has proved to be instrumental, not only for understanding the pathogenesis of CLL but also for defining clinical subgroups with strikingly different behavior and outcome. That said, the full potential of the IG molecule was not immediately realized, rather initial studies 62 - 64 set in action a train of events culminating with the current notion that CLL is an antigen-driven disease 74, 76, 100. Nowadays, the successful development of drugs targeting the BcR signaling pathway is revolutionizing CLL therapeutics 214, 216. Besides BcR signaling, CLL clones appear to actively interact with their microenvironment, receiving prosurvival and proliferation signals {{while at the same time}} efficiently escaping immune surveillance 217, 219. Immunomodulatory drugs acting at the level of the immune synapse between clonal B cells and their cognate T cells are currently being tested in clinical trials with promising results 218, 231. The immunogenetic approach of CLL pathogenesis needs to be able to also explain the existence of CLL-like monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL). The term describes the presence of a clonal B cell expansion with CLL immunophenotype in the peripheral blood, at a size that does not reach the consensus cut-off for CLL diagnosis (i. e. < 5000 clonal B cells/μL). The incidence of CLL-like MBL in the general population is ~ 10 % and rises even further with age, or when more sophisticated flow cytometry protocols are applied. It is generally perceived as a premalignant condition of CLL, as it progresses to CLL requiring treatment at a 1 - 2 %/year rate 154. However, if MBL cells are CLL progenitors, why don't all MBL progress to CLL? We investigated CLL ontogenesis from an immunogenetic point of view, at three separate directions: (i) BcR IG immunoprofiling in MBL and comparison to CLL (especially early-stage disease), (ii) BcR IG immunoprofiling of IG-switched CLL in order to examine its ontogenetic relation to the common IgM/IgD variant, and, (iii) T-cell receptor (TR) immunoprofiling in order to gain insight into the possible role of antigen in the selection and activation of cognate T cells. We performed a detailed immunogenetic profiling of 333 CLL-like MBL cases (60 LC and 273 HC). Low-count (LC) and high-count (HC) MBL had distinct IG gene repertoires, whereas the HC-MBL IG gene repertoire exhibited clear similarities to early-stage CLL (CLL Rai stage 0, CLL- 0). Furthermore, we sought for the expression of stereotyped BcR IG through a cluster analysis of the MBL sequences together with all CLL sequences from our cohort and non-CLL IG sequences retrieved from the IMGT/LIGM-DB sequence database. Overall, only 5. 5 % LC-MBL rearrangements could be clustered with other sequences. In contrast, HC-MBL included a significantly higher frequency of ‘CLL-specific’ BcR stereotypes, with 23. 3 % of cases clustering together with either MBL or CLL cases. This frequency was similar to that observed in CLL- 0 (20. 2 %). Collectively, the frequency of BcR IG stereotypy seemed to increase in parallel with the absolute count of CLL-like cells, starting with 5. 5 % in LC-MBL, raising to 23. 3 - 20. 2 % in in HC MBL/CLL- 0 and peaking at 30. 4 % in the entire CLL cohort. Overall, these findings suggest that LC-MBL is not a true premalignant condition, but rather the result of chronic antigenic stimulation or immune senescence. In contrast, HC-MBL is just a step behind early-stage CLL, requiring either additional genetic hits or simply time to cross the numerical cut-off that discriminates it from CLL. Therefore, the identification of molecular biomarkers that may predict progression of HC MBL/CLL- 0 into CLL requiring treatment is strongly warranted. Next, we performed a comprehensive immunogenetic comparison of 169 IgG-switched CLL patients (G-CLL) versus 1087 IgM/IgD CLL patients (classic MD-variant, MD-CLL). The IG gene repertoire was significantly different among G-CLL and MD-CLL, with overrepresentation of the IGHV 4 - 34 and IGHV 4 - 39 genes and underrepresentaion of the IGHV 1 - 69, IGHV 3 - 21, IGHV 1 - 2 and IGHV 3 - 48 genes, respectively. G-CLL included significantly more cases with mutated IGHV genes compared to MD-CLL, and significantly more MD-CLL cases carried BcR IGs with no SHM compared to G-CLL. The extreme skewing of the G-CLL repertoire merely reflected the fact that almost one-third of all cases concerned three CLL subsets: mutated stereotyped subsets # 4 and # 16 utilizing the IGHV 4 - 34 gene, and truly unmutated subset # 8, utilizing the IGHV 4 - 39 gene (18. 3 %, 4 %, and 7. 3 % of all G-CLL, respectively). These subsets, especially subsets # 4 and # 8, are polar opposites in terms of prognosis, with subset # 4 cases exhibiting particularly indolent disease whereas subset # 8 cases experience an aggressive disease course often complicated by Richter’s syndrome. In clear contrast to these 3 subsets utilizing the IGHV 4 - 34 and IGHV 4 - 39 genes, all major CLL subsets utilizing the IGHV 1 - 69, IGHV 3 - 21, IGHV 1 - 2 and IGHV 3 - 48 genes were exclusively represented in MD-CLL. Even when restricting the comparison solely to cases with mutated BcR IGs, G-CLL still exhibits an overall distinct immunogenetic profile from MD-CLL, thus prompting speculations about distinct cell of origin and/or distinct immune <b>trigerring</b> and raising questions regarding the timing of CSR in regards to malignant transformation 21. That said, the paradigmatic case of truly unmutated, G-switched subset # 8 suggests that CSR and SHM may occur independently in CLL. Finally, considering the critical role of antigenic stimulation in CLL pathogenesis, we sought to gain insight into the immune pathways shaping the T-cell repertoire in CLL. Our preliminary approach entailed classic subcloning techniques, followed by Sanger sequencing. We analysed 58 CLL patients, selected upon their clonotypic BcR IG molecular characteristics so as to represent major stereotyped CLL subsets (namely subsets # 1, # 2, and # 4), where the CLL clone is most evidently selected by antigen. Our study revealed skewed TR repertoire and oligoclonality. Moreover, we identified common T-cell clonotypes among different patients, alluding to selection by a shared antigenic elements. However, low-throughput methods such as classic subcloning, despite widely used, are inherently limited in describing other than monoclonal immune repertoires, thus precluding definite conclusions. Therefore, we aimed to advance our analytical depth by employing high-throughput, next-generation sequencing techniques, in order to obtain a comprehensive profile of the T-cell repertoire in CLL. Considering PCR-based NGS limitations, we followed a strict experimental approach including multiple types of controls, and we developed in-house, purpose-built bioinformatics tools for the management, curation and interpretation of the produced (big) data. In total, 32 CLL patients were analyzed. Again, we focused on patients assigned to major stereotyped subsets (namely subsets # 1, # 2, and # 4),but we also included patients expressing heterogeneous clonotypic BcR IGs (mutated and unmutated), in order to seek for T-cell immunogenetic signatures that may be ubiquitous in CLL. The study confirmed TR repertoire skewing, with oligoclonality that came in sharp contrast to the polyclonal profile of age-matched healthy controls, alluding to antigenic selection. Longitudinal analysis showed that T-cell clones persist and expand over time, suggesting a persistent antigenic drive. Moreover, the identification of shared clonotypes among different patients, most specially patients assigned to the same stereotyped subset, indicates common antigenic stimulation, perhaps in a CLL subset-specific context. Figure 27. A common scenario for CLL ontogenesis. How could all these pieces of information contribute in a plausible scenario for CLL ontogenesis? There is no doubt that many aspects of disease pathogenesis remain elusive or debatable. However, we could postulate that, in a premalignant phase, B cells with or without genetic predisposition for unrestrained clonal expansion are subjected to persistent stimulation by exogenous or endogenous antigens and are driven to oligo/polyclonal expansion. In this context, they may undergo SHM/CSR depending on their origin (B 2, B 1, marginal zone B cells?) and/or the nature of antigenic <b>trigerring,</b> and while they proliferate, they may acquire genetic lesions that translate to aberrant (i. e. CLL) phenotype. Thereby they enter the LC-MBL state, which remains stable over time unless further genetic/epigenetic hits and/or the functional properties of the clonotypic BcR IG (e. g. polyreactivity or capability of autonomous cell signaling through homotypic BcR interactions) lead to HC-MBL, which, given time and appropriate microenvironmental signals will progress to CLL requiring treatment (Figure 27). ...|$|E
