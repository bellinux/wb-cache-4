5|$|Transportation infrastructure, {{including}} bridges, <b>tunnels,</b> <b>and</b> {{most notably}} transit centers for rail, sea, and air transportation. Oslo airport (by the Aviaplan consortium at Gardermoen) was Norway's largest construction project ever.|$|E
5|$|Crossing {{points in}} the defence network– bridges, <b>tunnels</b> <b>and</b> other weak spots– were called nodes or points of resistance. These were {{fortified}} with removable road blocks, barbed wire entanglements, and land mines. These passive defences were overlooked by trench works, gun and mortar emplacements, and pillboxes. In places entire villages were fortified using barriers of scaffolding, sandbagged positions and loopholes in existing buildings.|$|E
5|$|Evidence of PLC's wartime {{occupation}} remain, with <b>tunnels</b> <b>and</b> bomb shelters accessible {{from below}} {{the stage of}} College Hall. A plaque presented to the school by the RAAF, in commemoration of PLC's wartime involvement, {{can be found on}} the school verandah at the entrance to the Main School.|$|E
50|$|There are two tunnel {{projects}} planned: Ryfast (Ryfylke <b>Tunnel</b> <b>and</b> Hundvåg <b>Tunnel)</b> <b>and</b> Rogfast.|$|R
50|$|Notable tunnels {{include two}} interstate highway tunnels on I-376, Fort Pitt <b>Tunnel</b> <b>and</b> Squirrel Hill Tunnel; major traffic <b>tunnels</b> Armstrong <b>Tunnel</b> <b>and</b> Liberty Tunnels; the light rail tunnel, Mt. Washington Transit Tunnel, the Schenley Tunnel, the Wabash <b>Tunnel</b> <b>and</b> Corliss <b>Tunnel.</b>|$|R
50|$|At {{the time}} of setup of L2TP connection, many control packets are {{exchanged}} between server and client to establish <b>tunnel</b> <b>and</b> session for each direction. One peer requests the other peer to assign a specific <b>tunnel</b> <b>and</b> session id through these control packets. Then using this <b>tunnel</b> <b>and</b> session id, data packets are exchanged with the compressed PPP frames as payload.|$|R
5|$|Helium {{is used as}} a {{protective}} gas in growing silicon and germanium crystals, in titanium and zirconium production, and in gas chromatography, because it is inert. Because of its inertness, thermally and calorically perfect nature, high speed of sound, and high value of the heat capacity ratio, it is also useful in supersonic wind <b>tunnels</b> <b>and</b> impulse facilities.|$|E
5|$|In 1872, {{some time}} after they {{had taken over the}} Sikhs' territory, the British {{developed}} the mine further. They found the mining to have been inefficient, with irregular and narrow <b>tunnels</b> <b>and</b> entrances that made the movement of labourers difficult and dangerous. The supply of water inside the mine was poor, and there was no storage facility for the mined salt. The only road to the mine was over difficult, rocky terrain. To address these problems the government levelled the road, built warehouses, provided a water supply, improved the entrances and <b>tunnels,</b> <b>and</b> introduced a better mechanism for excavation of salt. Penalties were introduced to control salt smuggling.|$|E
5|$|In late 2001, OHSU {{purchased}} {{property in}} the South Waterfront (then known as North Macadam) area, with plans to expand there. After studying several ways, including shuttle buses, gondola lifts, <b>tunnels,</b> <b>and</b> even funiculars, to connect OHSU's primary campus on Marquam Hill with this area of planned expansion, the university sought city support of an aerial tram.|$|E
25|$|SMART Tunnel E38 (4km (2.5 miles)) is {{the longest}} {{motorway}} tunnel, {{as well as the}} first double-decked <b>tunnel</b> <b>and</b> the first <b>tunnel</b> that has a stormwater <b>tunnel</b> <b>and</b> a motorway <b>tunnel</b> in Malaysia.|$|R

50|$|The Southern railway line {{passes through}} Dalveen; the hilly terrain necessitated two tunnels {{known as the}} Dalveen <b>Tunnel</b> <b>and</b> the Cherry Gully <b>Tunnel</b> <b>and</b> a rail bridge over Old Stanthorpe Road. The line {{is no longer in}} active service.|$|R
5|$|In {{the predawn}} hours of July 29, the 7th Cavalry Regiment withdrew from No Gun Ri. That afternoon, North Korean {{soldiers}} arrived outside the <b>tunnels</b> <b>and</b> helped those still alive, about two dozen, mostly children, feeding them and sending them back toward their villages.|$|E
5|$|The Fourth Army {{strongly}} garrisoned Shunet Nimrin, the entrenched area in {{the foothills}} which had repulsed an attack by Chetwode on 18 April and a second attack {{at the end of}} April during the Second Transjordan attack. The Fourth Army also held substantial forces at Amman, and guarding <b>tunnels</b> <b>and</b> viaducts along the Hejaz railway near Amman.|$|E
5|$|The Inner Ring Road was {{constructed}} {{over the course}} of the 1960s. This was the most ambitious scheme of its kind in the UK with Leeds City Council subsequently promoting the city with the slogan Motorway City of the Seventies. The works involved the construction of many flyovers and <b>tunnels</b> <b>and</b> the Motorway construction is notable in itself.|$|E

5|$|When the British arrived, most Lam Tin {{residents}} travelled on foot or by boat {{to nearby}} villages such as Ma Tau Wai. Over the years, the government built roads, <b>tunnels</b> <b>and</b> railways in Lam Tin to facilitate transport between Lam Tin and other districts, making Lam Tin {{a bridge between}} different areas of Eastern Hong Kong.|$|E
5|$|An {{automatic}} {{traffic monitoring}} and guidance {{system is in}} place along the motorway. It consists of measuring, control and signaling devices, located in zones where driving conditions may vary—at interchanges, near viaducts, bridges, <b>tunnels</b> <b>and</b> in zones where fog and strong winds are known to occur. The system consists of variable traffic signs used to communicate changing driving conditions, possible restrictions and other information to motorway users.|$|E

5|$|At {{the south}} eastern {{corner of the}} eastern terrace is the former pumping station, {{associated}} <b>tunnels</b> <b>and</b> a set of 1850s workshops within an enclosing wall. Underneath parts of the eastern terrace, the adjacent Hampton Road, the pumping station and the workshops there are a complex series of shafts, drives and weirs cut from the rock during the 1890s and early twentieth century. The east workshops is a single storey limestone building {{on the western side}} with an enclosed area to the east. The entire workshops yard was roofed using a light steel truss on steel supports in 1960.|$|E
50|$|In 1911, the Canadian Northern Montreal <b>Tunnel</b> <b>and</b> Terminal Company was {{incorporated}} {{to build the}} <b>tunnel</b> <b>and</b> terminal. It was renamed Mount Royal <b>Tunnel</b> <b>and</b> Terminal Company in 1914, and was a wholly owned subsidiary of CNoR. Construction started at the west portal on July 8, 1912. On December 10, 1913, crews from {{the east and west}} portals met beneath Mount Royal; they were out of alignment by 1 in. The bore measures approximately 5 km and has an ascending grade of 0.6% westbound.|$|R

5|$|By {{the late}} 19th century, as salvage {{operations}} became deeper and longer, an unexplained malady began afflicting the divers; they would suffer breathing difficulties, dizziness, joint pain and paralysis, sometimes leading to death. The problem was already well known among workers building <b>tunnels</b> <b>and</b> bridge footings operating under pressure in caissons and was initially called caisson disease; {{it was later}} renamed the bends because the joint pain typically caused the sufferer to stoop. Early reports of the disease had been made {{at the time of}} Charles Pasley's salvage operation, but scientists were still ignorant of its causes.|$|E
5|$|During the 18th century, the island's {{location}} made it {{an ideal}} base for smuggling. It has been alleged that an old mine shaft {{on the north side}} of the island connects with a series of natural <b>tunnels,</b> <b>and</b> a concealed exit to the sea. Although Flat Holm was in full view of both the Welsh and English coasts, customs authorities were powerless to act as they had no boat to take them to the island. According to tradition, a small cave in the east cliff at Flat Holm was used for the storage of contraband, mainly tea and brandy.|$|E
5|$|Following {{repeated}} heavy bombing by Allied forces during Operation Crossbow, the Germans {{were unable}} to complete the construction works and the complex never entered service. It was captured by the Allies in September 1944, partially demolished on the orders of Winston Churchill to prevent its reuse as a military base, and then abandoned. It remained derelict until the mid-1990s. In 1997 it {{opened to the public}} for the first time, as a museum. Exhibits in the <b>tunnels</b> <b>and</b> under the dome {{tell the story of the}} German occupation of France during World War II, the V-weapons and the history of space exploration.|$|E
