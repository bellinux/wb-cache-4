40|$|An on-grid <b>solar</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> will {{distribute}} {{electric power}} to the grid in normal conditions. But when the supply of grid outages (islanding), on-grid <b>solar</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> also can’t operate because {{the loss of the}} reference signal that is used as a reference for the inverter in the synchronization process. So there is potential loss of <b>power</b> when <b>solar</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> {{can be used as a}} substitute source of electrical energy while PLN can’t serve consumers. In this r esearch developed a simulation model that refers to the off grid <b>solar</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> 500 Wp in the Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Udayana and can operate on-grid and off grid when islanding in matlab simulink. In this model made operation scenario where <b>solar</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> operates on grid at the beginning of the simulation and after that operate off-grid (not connected to the grid and supply the local load). The simulation results show the model off grid <b>solar</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> has been able to generate a voltage of 220 V and a frequency of 50 Hz in accordance with the <b>solar</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> at the research site. The simulation results also show model of on grid <b>solar</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> has been able to synchronize to the low voltage grid of PLN not loaded and loaded. On/off grid <b>solar</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> model can operate on-grid or off-grid that corresponds to the operation scenario and produce the same output.

40|$|There {{are a lot}} of {{different}} efficiency photovoltaic cells, which are used in <b>solar</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants.</b> All of these different photovoltaic cells are affected by different environment conditions. Maximum power point tracking is the main way to increase <b>solar</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> efficiency.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} {{the application of}} fuzzy pre-dictive control to a <b>solar</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant.</b> The proposed predictive controller uses fuzzy characterization of goals and constraints, based on the fuzzy optimization framework for multi-objective satisfaction problems. This approach enhances model based pre-dictive control (MBPC) allowing the specification of more complex requirements. A {{brief description of the}} <b>solar</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> and its simulator is given. Basic concepts of predictive control and fuzzy predictive control are introduced. Two fuzzy predictive controllers using different membership functions are designed for a <b>solar</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant,</b> and they are compared with a classical predictive controller. The simulation results show that the fuzzy MBPC formulation, based on a well proven successful algorithm, gives a greater flexibility to characterize the goals and constraints than classical control.
