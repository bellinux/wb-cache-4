5|$|In {{the late}} 17th century, <b>the</b> <b>Navajo</b> {{acquired}} the Iberian Churra, a {{breed of sheep}} from Spanish explorers. These animals were developed into a unique breed by <b>the</b> <b>Navajo,</b> today called the Navajo-Churro. These sheep were well-suited to the climate in Navajo lands, and that produced a useful long-staple wool. Hand-spun wool from these animals was {{the main source of}} yarn for Navajo blankets until the 1860s, when the United States government forced <b>the</b> <b>Navajo</b> people to relocate at Bosque Redondo and seized their livestock. The 1869 peace treaty that allowed <b>the</b> <b>Navajo</b> to return to their traditional lands included a $30,000 settlement to replace their livestock. The tribe purchased 14,000 sheep and 1,000 goats.|$|E

It is the only tribally owned zoological park in the United States and is notable among zoological {{facilities}} in that it labels its exhibits in a Native American Indian language.

5|$|In 1935, the United States Department of the Interior {{created the}} Southwestern Range and Sheep Breeding Laboratory {{to address the}} {{problems}} Rambouillet stock had caused for <b>the</b> <b>Navajo</b> economy. Located at Fort Wingate, New Mexico, the program's aim was to develop a new sheep bloodline that simulated the wool characteristics of the 19th-century Navajo-Churro stock and would also supply adequate meat. The Fort Wingate researchers collected old Navajo-Churro stock from remote parts of the reservation and hired a weaver to test their experimental wool. Offspring of these experiments were distributed among <b>the</b> <b>Navajo</b> people. World War II interrupted the greater part of this effort when military work resumed at Fort Wingate.|$|E
50|$|In 1890, a local rancher {{refused to}} pay <b>the</b> <b>Navajos</b> a fine of livestock. <b>The</b> <b>Navajos</b> tried to collect it, and whites in {{southern}} Colorado and Utah claimed that 9,000 of <b>the</b> <b>Navajos</b> were on a warpath. A small military detachment out of Fort Wingate restored white citizens to order.|$|R
50|$|Trade {{with men}} like Hubbell became {{increasingly}} important for <b>the</b> <b>Navajos.</b> <b>The</b> trader was {{in contact with}} the world outside the newly created reservation; a world which could supply <b>the</b> staples <b>the</b> <b>Navajos</b> needed to supplement their homegrown products. In exchange for the trader's goods <b>the</b> <b>Navajos</b> traded wool, sheep and, later, rugs, jewelry, baskets and pottery. It was years before cash was used between trader and Navajos.|$|R
50|$|Doniphan {{was eager}} to start south, but he first {{had to wait for}} Price to arrive. Kearny, and then Doniphan had tried to {{negotiate}} with <b>the</b> <b>Navajos,</b> together with <b>the</b> Ute tribe and Apaches, but had made little progress. After Price arrived with his force, Kearny, near the present-day border of Arizona and New Mexico, learned that <b>the</b> <b>Navajos</b> had attacked some sheepherders, killed them, and stolen their herd of 2,000 sheep. Kearny dispatched a message to Doniphan to attack <b>the</b> <b>Navajos</b> on October 2, 1846. Doniphan signed a peace treaty with the Utes, and then took three companies and headed west (toward present day Gallup) in pursuit of <b>the</b> <b>Navajos.</b>|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Navajo</b> {{may have}} learned to weave from their Pueblo Indian neighbors when they moved into the Four Corners region during the year 1000 A.D. Some experts contend that <b>the</b> <b>Navajo</b> were not weavers until after the 17th century. <b>The</b> <b>Navajo</b> {{obtained}} cotton through local trade routes {{before the arrival of}} the Spanish, after which time they began to use wool. The Pueblo and Navajo were not generally on friendly terms due to frequent Navajo raids on Pueblo settlements, yet many Pueblo sought refuge with their Navajo neighbors in the late 17th century to evade the conquistadors {{in the aftermath of the}} Pueblo Revolt. This social interchange is the probable origin of the distinctive Navajo weaving tradition. Spanish records show that Navajo people began to herd sheep and weave wool blankets from that time onward.|$|E
5|$|By {{the middle}} of the century, the palette had {{expanded}} to include red, black, green, yellow, and gray which signifies different aspects of the earth as defined by different locations of the reservation. Navajo used indigo to obtain shades from pale blue to near black and mixed it with indigenous yellow dyes such as the rabbit brush plant to obtain bright green effects. Red was the most difficult dye to obtain locally. Early Navajo textiles use cochineal, an extract from a Mesoamerican beetle, which often made a circuitous trade route through Spain and England on its way to <b>the</b> <b>Navajo.</b> Reds used in Navajo weaving tended to be raveled from imported textiles. <b>The</b> <b>Navajo</b> obtained black dye through piñon pitch and ashes.|$|E
5|$|In January 1999, {{outgoing}} Navajo Nation president Milton Bluehouse {{ordered the}} zoo closed after two women from Rock Ridge {{claimed to have}} been visited by the , traditional Navajo deities, who had given them a warning, saying that <b>the</b> <b>Navajo</b> people were not living according to tradition by keeping caged animals, specifically bears, snakes, and eagles, which are considered sacred.|$|E

5|$|Written records {{establish}} <b>the</b> <b>Navajo</b> as fine weavers for {{at least}} the last 300 years, beginning with Spanish colonial descriptions of the early 18th century. By 1812, Pedro Piño called <b>the</b> <b>Navajo</b> the best weavers in the province. Few remnants of 18th-century Navajo weaving survive; the most important surviving examples of early Navajo weaving come from Massacre Cave at Canyon de Chelly, Arizona. In 1804, a group of Navajo were shot and killed there, where they were seeking refuge from Spanish soldiers. For a hundred years the cave remained untouched due to Navajo taboos until a local trader named Sam Day entered it and retrieved the textiles. Day separated the collection and sold it to various museums. The majority of Massacre Cave blankets feature plain stripes, yet some exhibit the terraces and diamonds characteristic of later Navajo weaving.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Navajo</b> were an Athabaskan {{people who}} {{migrated}} {{from the north}} into the Colorado River basin around 1025 A.D. They soon established themselves as the dominant Native American tribe in the Colorado River basin, and their territory stretched over parts of present-day Arizona, New Mexico, Utah and Colorado – in the original homelands of the Puebloans. In fact, <b>the</b> <b>Navajo</b> acquired agricultural skills from the Puebloans before {{the collapse of the}} Pueblo civilization in the 14thcentury. A profusion of other tribes have made a continued, lasting presence along the Colorado River. The Mohave have lived along the rich bottomlands of the lower Colorado below Black Canyon since 1200 A.D. They were fishermen – navigating the river on rafts made of reeds to catch Gila trout and Colorado pikeminnow – and farmers, relying on the annual floods of the river rather than irrigation to water their crops. Ute peoples have inhabited the northern Colorado River basin, mainly in present-day Colorado, Wyoming and Utah, for at least 2,000 years, but did not become well established in the Four Corners area until 1500 A.D. The Apache, Cocopah, Halchidhoma, Havasupai, Hualapai, Maricopa, Pima, and Quechan are among many other groups that live along or had territories bordering on the Colorado River and its tributaries.|$|E

Upon being assigned the territory Carleton set boundaries in which <b>the</b> <b>Navajos</b> would not engage in any sort of conflict. They were prohibited from trespassing onto lands, raiding neighboring tribes, and engaging in warfare with both the Spaniards and Americans. A majority of <b>the</b> <b>Navajos</b> were abiding by these requirements but it was a band of Navajo freelancing raiding parties that would break these rules, for which the entire tribe would soon be penalized. In the eyes of Carleton, he was unsuccessful and would enlist outside resources for aid. General James Carleton would enlist famous Indian Fighter Colonel Christopher [...] "Kit" [...] Carson.

50|$|Beginning in {{the spring}} of 1864, around 9,000 Navajo men, women, and {{children}} were forced to embark on a trek of over 300 mi to Fort Sumner, New Mexico for internment at Bosque Redondo. The internment at Bosque Redondo was a failure for many reasons as the government failed to provide an adequate supply of water, wood, provisions, and livestock for 4,000-5,000 people. Large-scale crop failure and disease were also endemic during this time, as well as raids by other tribes and civilians. In addition, a small group of Mescalero Apaches, long enemies of <b>the</b> <b>Navajos,</b> had been relocated to the area, resulting in conflicts. In 1868, a treaty was negotiated between <b>Navajo</b> leaders and <b>the</b> federal government allowing <b>the</b> surviving <b>Navajos</b> to return to a reservation on a portion of their former homeland. <b>The</b> <b>Navajos</b> were not provided with much protection; other enemies of <b>the</b> <b>Navajos</b> would swoop in and take Navajo women and children back to their camps and force them to work as slaves. While at Bosque Redondo, the government did not provide <b>the</b> <b>Navajos</b> with food or shelter, and some <b>Navajos</b> froze during <b>the</b> winter because of poor shelters that they had to make on their own.|$|R
