500|$|Garfield did not {{consider}} Lincoln particularly worthy of re-election, but no viable alternative seemed available. [...] "He {{will probably be the}} man, <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> we could do better." [...] The Ohioan attended the party convention and promoted Rosecrans as Lincoln's running mate, but delegates chose Military Governor of Tennessee Andrew Johnson. Both Lincoln and Garfield were re-elected. By then, Chase had left the Cabinet and had been appointed Chief Justice, and his relations with Garfield became more distant.|$|E
500|$|Hopkins {{was asked}} in an {{interview}} on the subject of whether or not he believed the idea of Starling and Lecter heading off into the sunset as lovers (as happens in the book). [...] "Yes, I did. Other people found that preposterous. I suppose there's a moral issue there. I {{think it would have been}} a very interesting thing <b>though.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it would have been very interesting had she gone off, because I suspected that there was that romance, attachment there, that obsession with her. I guessed that a long time ago, at the last phone call to Clarice, at the end of SotL, she said, 'Dr. Lecter, Dr. Lecter...'." ...|$|E

500|$|Remi Aubuchon {{was hired}} as the showrunner for the second season in May 2011 before the first season premiere. Once Aubuchon entered the writer's room, he began {{speaking}} of the cliffhanger [...] "it became a really fun challenge." [...] Out of that cliffhanger, says Aubuchon, [...] "came some really positive things that propel {{a lot of the}} storytelling in the second season. And the writers came up with a pretty cool way for Tom Mason to get off that spaceship again." [...] "You'll always catch people after a huge trauma saying, 'Oh, it wasn't that bad.' Or, 'It was fun,' Or, 'It was cool falling off that cliff,'" [...] says Aubuchon. [...] "The truth is, at first it was like, 'Oh my God, should i just say I can't do this job?' Ultimately, <b>though,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it turned out cool." ...|$|E
500|$|Individual Beatles later commented {{about their}} {{memories}} of Hamburg, with Lennon reflecting, [...] "We'd outlived the Hamburg stage {{and wanted to}} pack that up. We hated going back to Hamburg those last two times. We'd had that scene. Brian [...] made us go back to fulfill the contract...". Harrison had positive memories of the period: [...] "I'd have to say with hindsight that Hamburg bordered on the best of Beatles times. We didn't have any luxury, we didn't have any bathrooms or any clothes, we were pretty grubby, we couldn't afford anything, {{but on the other}} hand we weren't yet famous, so we didn't have to contend with the bullshit that comes with fame." [...] McCartney was philosophical: [...] "Hamburg was certainly a great childhood memory. But I think all things are enhanced by time. It was very exciting, <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it felt better to me a little later in our career, once we'd started to get a bit of success with the records." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1996 Dibnah {{repaired}} the [...] chimney at Barrow Bridge—the same chimney he had scaled for a bet, in his youth. [...] He {{was also}} asked to install a peregrine falcon nest at the top. [...] He was later influential in ensuring the chimney was made a listed building. [...] As a notable raconteur he also became an after-dinner speaker and would wear his trademark flat cap with his dinner jacket. [...] He made an appearance in a 1996 television advertisement for Kelloggs, but the strain of living with a man so dedicated to his hobbies began to take its toll on his wife: [...] "Sometimes he'll have busted his thumb because he's hit it with a hammer; you couldn't really expect him then {{to come in and}} start doing things in the house. [...] I just don't think it's fair <b>though,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> you've got to strike a balance and I think ours is about 90/10. [...] Me for 90 per cent of the housework and Fred for 10." [...] Susan met another man and moved out, taking Roger with her and leaving Jack with Fred.|$|E

500|$|In 1908, Chamberlin {{was hired}} to lead the Biology Department at Brigham Young University (BYU), [...] a {{university}} {{owned and operated by}} The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), during a period which BYU president George H. Brimhall sought to increase its academic standing. LDS College professor J. H. Paul, in a letter to Brimhall, had written Chamberlin was [...] "one of the world's foremost naturalists, <b>though,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> he is only about 28 years of age. I have not met his equal... We must not let him drift away". Chamberlin oversaw expanded biology course offerings and led insect-collecting trips with students. Chamberlin joined a pair of newly hired brothers on the faculty, Joseph and Henry Peterson, who taught psychology and education. Chamberlin and the two Petersons worked to increase the intellectual standing of the University. In 1909 Chamberlin's own brother William H. Chamberlin {{was hired to}} teach philosophy. The four academics, all active members of the Church, were known for teaching modern scientific and philosophic ideas and encouraging lively debate and discussion. The Chamberlins and Petersons held the belief that the theory of evolution was compatible with religious views, and promoted historical criticism of the Bible, the view that the writings contained should be viewed from the context of the time: Ralph Chamberlin published essays in the White and Blue, BYU's student newspaper, arguing that Hebrew legends and historical writings were not to be taken literally. In an essay titled [...] "" [...] Chamberlin concluded: [...] "Only the childish and immature mind can lose by learning that much in the Old Testament is poetical and that some of the stories are not true historically." [...] Chamberlin believed that evolution explained not only the origin of organisms but of human theological beliefs as well.|$|E
2500|$|While campaigning, Clinton {{answered}} audience questions but did {{not give}} interviews or respond to press questions, including one from a nine-year-old Scholastic News reporter asking whether her father {{would be a good}} [...] "first man". She replied, [...] "I'm sorry, I don't talk to the press and that applies to you, unfortunately. Even <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> you're cute." [...] Philippe Reines, her mother's press secretary, intervened when the press attempted to approach Chelsea directly.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{he tried}} to {{complete}} a libretto for over a year, in a July 1961 letter to his cousin, Harriet Winslow, {{he admitted that he}} was writing the piece [...] "to satisfy my Ford [...] opera grant, <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of a play rather than anything that could be sung." [...] And by the end of 1961, Lowell had largely abandoned the idea of writing a libretto and instead redirected his energy to writing the three dramatic theater pieces that would make up the play The Old Glory. He finished writing a first draft of his play by early 1962, and by 1963, he'd begun working with the English director Jonathan Miller who'd expressed an interest in directing The Old Glory in New York.|$|E

2500|$|Punk in Drublic was {{followed}} by the 1996 CD Heavy Petting Zoo, whose LP companion featured different cover art and the name Eating Lamb. The artwork for the CD featured a man holding a sheep, while the LP depicted the same man in a 69 position with the sheep. The Eating Lamb version was banned from sale in Germany due to its obscene cover art. The LP version did not achieve the success of its predecessor, although it was the first NOFX record to achieve a position on the Billboard charts, reaching number 63. Fat Mike stated: [...] "Weird record. I thought it was the coolest record when we finished it, but a few months later I wasn't so sure. Some of those songs are kinda weird. I like the cover a lot <b>though.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it sold well in Belgium." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "It is {{customary}} {{to talk of}} Kelly as quintessentially an Irish rider. For my part, <b>though,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> {{it helps}} to place Kelly better as a cyclist {{to see him as}} the last of the Flemish riders. This is usually a title associated with the post-war rider, Briek Schotte who has become appropriately enough the man in day-to-day charge of the de Gribaldy teams. As exemplified by Schotte it stood for a certain type of mentality, willing to suffer, narrowly focussed, and hard, hard, hard. Kelly had all this in him from his Irish small-farm background: the outside loo; the dogs that have to be chained before you can step from your car; the one career possible, as a bricklayer on a construction site, stretching away and away into the grey mists. On the positive side, along with the self-reliance, came a physical strength that even by peasant standards is impressive. In a profession of iron wills, there is no one harder." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{its initial}} years {{the company had}} {{occasionally}} had to purchase wheat from other sources to meet the RAC demands. In 1840 John McLoughlin had to purchase 4,000 bushels of wheat from Alta California to supplement produce made by the PSAC. During the 1840s pastoral and agricultural produce shipped to New Archangel annually consistently was 30,000lbs of beef and from 40,000 to 80,000lbs of wheat. Governor Arvid Etholén praised wheat produced by the PSAC as [...] "incomparably cheaper" [...] than produced bought from American merchants and being of [...] "the best quality." [...] Despite the PSAC's initial growth, its principal manager, John McLoughlin didn't hold a favorable view of the venture. In a letter written to Douglas prior to the 1838 London meetings, McLoughlin criticized what eventually became the PSAC:"I will {{take this opportunity to}} state it is my opinion that, <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> individuals who would devote their attention to raising cattle in the Columbia might make a living at it still it is my opinion the Hudson's Bay Company will make nothing by it." ...|$|E
