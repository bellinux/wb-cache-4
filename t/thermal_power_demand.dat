The annual wind energy rejection percentage is calculated for Crete and Rhodes in this paper. The rejected wind energy {{is defined as the}} electric energy produced by the wind turbines and not absorbed by the utility network, mainly due to power production system's stability and dynamic security reasons. A parametric calculation of the annual wind energy rejection percentage, in terms of the installed wind <b>power,</b> the <b>power</b> <b>demand</b> and the maximum allowed wind power instant penetration percentage, is accomplished. The methodology takes into account (i) the wind power penetration probability, restricted by the thermal generators technical minima and the maximum allowed wind power instant penetration percentage over the instant <b>power</b> <b>demand,</b> and (ii) the wind power production probability, derived by the islands'wind potential.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 5 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, South Africa, 1 - 4 July, 2007. Combined heat and power (CHP) production gains more and more attention. Offices and public buildings often have a large <b>thermal</b> <b>power</b> <b>demand</b> in combination with a fairly large electrical power demand. On the other hand they are seldom occupied by night and in weekends, reducing the actual operational time of the heating system. This in turn brings down the financial benefits of investing in CHP. A second problem is that electrical and thermal demands are often shifted in time. The running time of the engine is again limited this way, as it is often not allowed to deliver electricity to the power grid. A possible solution is using heat storage. This way the CHP-engine can run when the electricity demand is high. In the paper a simulation model of CHP with gas engine and heat storage {{by means of a}} hot water vessel is developed. The model is validated through experiments on an engine and a vessel. This model is used to analyze the design, control and performance of cogeneration plants.

40|$|Calcium Looping (CaL) is an {{interesting}} post-combustion CO 2 capture and storage technique, but it requires the operation of an endothermal calciner through the oxy-combustion of an auxiliary fuel. The idea behind the present work is to couple a CaL process with a concentrated solar power system, in order to supply all the thermal energy required by the calciner through a renewable source. The integration of a CaL cycle with a concentrated solar power system would offer many technical, economical and environmental advantages.

Therefore, in the present work a process with some peculiarities has been designed, including two additional storage vessels, and making use of a different looping strategy between day and night.

40|$|Calcium Looping (CaL) is a {{promising}} post-combustion CO 2 capture and storage technique. Thermal input to the calciner, which {{is needed to}} sustain the endothermicity of sorbent regeneration, is usually accomplished via oxy-combustion of an auxiliary fuel. The idea behind {{the present study is}} to couple CaL with a Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) system, so that all the thermal energy required in the calciner is supplied by a renewable source. The integration of a CaL cycle with a CSP system offers several potential technical, economical and environmental advantages, but must cope with the inherently unsteady nature of incident solar power. The cyclic character of incident solar power as compared with steady CaL operation could be managed in different ways. In the present study a simple scheme of integrated CaL-CSP process is suggested, based on storage of the excess incident power during the daytime as calcined sorbent, which is eventually utilized in the CaL loop during the nighttime. A preliminary assessment of the performance of this integrated scheme is accomplished by means of model computations. The model is based on a population balance model on sorbent particles, which takes into account the cyclic operation of the system.

We have achieved the energy consumption of 2. 6 GJ/t-CO 2 at a condition of 90 % CO 2 capture ratio at our 10 t-CO 2 /day pilot plant in February 2011 using the flue gas from the coal fired boiler of the Mikawa power plant. This {{is the first time}} in the world that the consumed energy of much lower than 3. 0 GJ/t-CO 2 has been proved at a 10 t- CO 2 /day scale pilot plant using the actual flue gas of the coal fired power plant, not only by simulations. According to the heat loss test and analysis, it would be reduced more 0. 3 GJ/t-CO 2 by reinforcing the thermal insulation, which means 2. 3 GJ/t-CO 2 would be possible at larger scale commercial plant. Since the pilot plant had completed in September 2009, we have been operating it continuously using the flue gas from the coal fired boiler. Then we have reached the 6, 809 hour cumulative operating time which includes more than 3, 000 hour operating time exceeding the planning values of 10 t-CO 2 /day and 90 % CO 2 capture ratio.

The range of products and services covers important stages of vehicle production. As a systems supplier, Dürr plans and builds complete paint shops and final assembly facilities. Industrial Solar – formerly known as Mirroxx – is the leading manufacturer of Fresnel process heat collectors and can look back on seven years operating experience with its systems. Automotive industry is under considerable strain to make their products more environmentally sound. Not only the cars themselves, but also the whole value chain has to become more sustainable. One production process, which contributes a significant share to the carbon footprint of a car, is the curing of a car's paint. As the temperatures in the convection ovens are up to 200 °C the application of market available flatplate or vacuum tube collectors was not an option, as these collector types cannot provide such high temperatures. Also the thermal power needed for a convection oven is well above the typical power range of solar collectors, which were originally designed for domestic hot water applications. A pilot system of a solar driven convection oven has been installed on the Dürr Campus in Bietigheim-Bissingen near Stuttgart/Germany.
