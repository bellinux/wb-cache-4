5|$|<b>The</b> <b>hull</b> {{and single}} funnel {{amidships}} were both finished in black paint, {{with a single}} white stripe running the length of <b>the</b> <b>hull</b> highlighting a row of false gunports. <b>The</b> <b>hull</b> was flat-bottomed, with no external keel, and with bulges low on each side amidships which continued toward the stern in an unusual implementation of tumblehome—a result of the late decision to install propeller engines, which were wider at the base than the originally planned paddlewheel engines.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> double <b>hull</b> of a {{submarine}} {{is different from}} a ship's double <b>hull.</b> <b>The</b> external <b>hull,</b> which actually forms the shape of submarine, is called <b>the</b> outer <b>hull,</b> casing or light hull. This term is especially appropriate for Russian submarine construction, where <b>the</b> light <b>hull</b> is usually made of steel that is only 2 to 4 millimetres thick, as {{it has the same}} pressure on both sides. <b>The</b> light <b>hull</b> can be used to mount equipment, which if attached directly to <b>the</b> pressure <b>hull</b> could cause unnecessary stress. <b>The</b> double <b>hull</b> approach also saves space inside <b>the</b> pressure <b>hull,</b> as <b>the</b> ring stiffeners and longitudinals can be located between <b>the</b> <b>hulls.</b> These measures help minimise the size of <b>the</b> pressure <b>hull,</b> which is much heavier than <b>the</b> light <b>hull.</b> Also, in case the submarine is damaged, <b>the</b> light <b>hull</b> takes some of the damage and does not compromise the vessel's integrity, as long as <b>the</b> pressure <b>hull</b> is intact.|$|R

As no records of English shipbuilding techniques used in vessels like the Mary Rose survive, excavation of the ship would allow for a detailed survey of her design and shed {{new light on the}} construction of ships of the era. A full excavation also meant removing the protective layers of silt that prevented the remaining ship structure from being destroyed through biological decay and the scouring of the currents; the operation had to be completed within a predetermined timespan of a few years or it risked irreversible damage.

5000|$|All six {{of these}} {{submarines}} (and all subsequent U.S. Navy submarines {{up to the}} late 1940s) were built to a [...] "partial-double hull" [...] design.

5|$|Raising the Mary Rose meant {{overcoming}} {{a number}} of delicate problems {{that had never been}} encountered before. The raising of the Swedish warship Vasa 1959–61 was the only comparable precedent, but it had been a relatively straightforward operation since <b>the</b> <b>hull</b> was completely intact and rested upright on the seabed. It had been raised with basically the same methods as were in use in Tudor England: cables were slung under <b>the</b> <b>hull</b> and attached to two pontoons {{on either side of the}} ship which was then gradually raised and towed into shallower waters. Only one third of the Mary Rose was intact and she lay deeply embedded in mud. If <b>the</b> <b>hull</b> were raised in the traditional way, there was no guarantee that it would have enough structural strength to hold together out of water. Many suggestions for raising the ship were discarded, including the construction of a cofferdam around the wreck site, filling the ship with small buoyant objects (such as ping pong balls) or even pumping brine into the seabed and freezing it so that it would float and take <b>the</b> <b>hull</b> with it. After lengthy discussions it was decided in February 1980 that <b>the</b> <b>hull</b> would first be emptied of all its contents and strengthened with steel braces and frames. It would then be lifted to the surface with floating sheerlegs attached to nylon strops passing under <b>the</b> <b>hull</b> and transferred to a cradle. It was also decided that the ship would be recovered before the end of the diving season in 1982. If the wreck stayed uncovered any longer it risked irreversible damage from biological decay and tidal scouring.|$|E
