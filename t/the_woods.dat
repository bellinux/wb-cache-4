5|$|A tabloid {{paper offers}} a $10,000 reward for the tiger causing {{the town to}} be {{inundated}} with hunters and reporters. The sheriff forbids anyone from going in <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> and hunting the tiger, but while out with Deputy Sharon Weinman (Sarah Constible), he sees Roy in <b>the</b> <b>woods.</b> They give chase, but instead find a dead tabloid reporter. The National Guard is called in to help. The sheriff later sees Roy in <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> again and warns him to stay out before taking him home and giving Rose the same warning. After he leaves, she mistakenly believes Roy told the sheriff lies about there being a tiger and chastises him.|$|E
5|$|Following the Norman {{conquest of}} England in 1066, Ernulf de Hesdin {{was given the}} manor of Ruislip, which {{included}} <b>the</b> <b>woods,</b> in recognition of his service to William the Conqueror. In 1087, Ernulf de Hesdin passed the manor to the Bec Abbey. During the Abbey's ownership, timber from <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> {{was used in the}} construction of the Tower of London in 1339, Windsor Castle in 1344, the Palace of Westminster in 1346 and the manor of the Black Prince in Kennington. Locally, the Great Barn on the Manor Farm site was constructed of oak from <b>the</b> <b>woods.</b> King's College, Cambridge became lords of the manor in 1451.|$|E

5|$|On 21 May 1997, <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> {{became a}} {{national}} nature reserve, the first in an urban area of England.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>woods</b> were coppiced on {{rotation}} {{throughout the}} years with the timber being sold to local tanneries. By the time King's College took ownership of the manor, <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> were let out for pheasant shooting.

50|$|To {{properly}} bend a {{sheet of}} wood, {{there are a few}} techniques that will help. The hardness of <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> will determine how long is required to soak <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> in water. <b>The</b> harder <b>the</b> <b>wood,</b> <b>the</b> more time is needed to fully soak <b>the</b> <b>wood,</b> making it easier to bend and preventing <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> from springing back to its original form. Popular hardwoods are oak, maple, cherry, birch, walnut, ash and poplar. Common softwoods are pine, fir, spruce, hemlock, cedar and redwood.|$|R
2500|$|The French {{name for}} <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> was [...] (now [...] ) {{but to the}} British {{infantry}} it was known as High <b>Wood.</b> <b>The</b> <b>wood</b> is on <b>the</b> D 107 road, which runs from Martinpuich to Longueval. Before the Battle of <b>the</b> Somme <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> was behind <b>the</b> German second line, which lay in front of Bazentin-le-Grand and Bazentin-le-Petit. <b>The</b> <b>wood</b> crowned a ridge which was about [...] high which overlooked the ground around for a considerable distance. Any attack on <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> could be seen easily from the ridge which ran through {{the north end of}} <b>the</b> <b>wood.</b> Before <b>the</b> battle the trees in <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> were undamaged and the ground had not been damaged by shell-fire. <b>The</b> <b>wood</b> was about half-way between Bazentin-le-Petit and Bazentin-le-Grand to the south-west, Martinpuich to the north-west and Longueval to <b>the</b> south-east.

50|$|In the 1950s, Mr Pitcher sold <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> to Mr Deane.

At {{the eastern edge of}} <b>the</b> <b>wood,</b> he also introduced some Douglas firs.

5|$|Under the {{ownership}} of the Bec Abbey, timber from <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> around Ruislip – Park Wood, Mad Bess Wood and Copse Wood – {{was used in the}} construction of the Tower of London in 1339, Windsor Castle in 1344, the Palace of Westminster in 1346 and the manor of the Black Prince in Kennington. <b>The</b> <b>woods</b> were coppiced on rotation throughout the years with the timber sold to local tanneries.

Meanwhile, {{the man and the}} previous woman have sex in the missionary position. Soon after, the other woman joins them and the man has sex with her doggy style. Later, they have a threesome, and one of the women subsequently gives the man fellatio. After finishing the sexual acts, they return to the car.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Through <b>the</b> {{analysis}} of <b>wood</b> microstructure, <b>the</b> study revealed the reason of forming <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> zone line pattern, and analyzed <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> zone line pattern’s {{similarities and differences}} between the artificial cultivation and natural formation. And <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> zone line pattern was formed because that the fungal hyphae invaded into <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> inside. <b>The</b> research results showed that: (1) The causes for <b>the</b> formation of <b>wood</b> zone line pattern, took place when different fungi eroding the same tree, due to antagonism among the hyphae, and the zone line was formed on their against interface.

5000|$|An {{explanation}} of the term [...] "dry rot" [...] circles around boatyards periodically. In the age of wooden ships, boats were sometimes hauled for the winter and placed in sheds or dry dock for repair. The boats already had some amount of rot occurring in <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> members, but <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> cellular structure was full of water making it still function structurally. As <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> dried out, <b>the</b> cell walls would crumble. In other words, <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> was already rotten and as the boat dried, <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> collapsed and crumbled, causing the workers in the yard to determine it was [...] "dry rot", when in fact, <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> had been rotten all along.|$|R
