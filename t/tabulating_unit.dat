5000|$|The AAF Statistical Services Division (about 300 strong) {{moved to}} New Orleans in 1946 {{as part of}} the newly created New Orleans <b>Tabulating</b> <b>Unit.</b> This unit was a joint Weather Bureau, Air Force, and Navy climate center {{established}} after the war to unify U.S. civilian and military records, observing methods, and data management procedures. After the war, many punched card collections that were acquired from our allies or captured from our enemies were sent to New Orleans for processing (one set weighed 21 tons). The [...] "Kopenhagener Schlussel" [...] deck of 7 million captured German punched cards contained weather observations taken during WWII in Europe and the Middle East. Both the British Admiralty’s and the Deutsche Seewarte’s decks had millions of ship observations that went back to the 1850s.|$|E
50|$|Punched cards, {{which are}} pieces of stiff paper that contain digital {{information}} {{represented by the}} presence or absence of holes in predefined positions, were a technical marvel when they came into prominence in the United States. The cards, developed by Herman Hollerith for use in the 1890 U.S. Census, made the use of historical weather records a practical means for determining the probability of future weather events and patterns. The British used punched cards successfully in about 1920 to extract wind data from ships’ logs and to produce wind roses for ocean regions. The Dutch Meteorological Institute borrowed some of the British cards in 1922 and began their own weather analyses. Norway, France, and Germany soon followed. Then, in 1927, the Czech meteorologist, L.W. Pollak, placed small and inexpensive punch machines of his own design in every Czech weather station. As each observation was taken, it was punched on a card that was sent to a central <b>tabulating</b> <b>unit</b> for summary and analysis. Although the equipment for gathering and tabulating weather data has changed since then, the basic idea of the process has not.|$|E

40|$|The study aims at the {{professional}} development of teachers {{by looking at the}} process of how they plan their teaching acts. For that, didactic units designed and elaborated by teachers of Experimental Sciences in Secondary Education are analyzed. Once the information has been <b>tabulated,</b> the <b>units</b> of analysis have been chosen according to three scopes: the types of activities, the level of difficulty and their relevance for the students' learning. A descriptive study of the data obtained is offered and, finally, the results are contrasted in terms of the scientific topic of the didactic unit and the expertise of the teachers...|$|R
40|$|More than 40 chromatographic peaks {{representing}} carbohydrates {{have been}} separated from human urine by a carbohydrate analyzer that makes use of anion-exchange chromatography. Ten of these separated carbo-hydrates have been identified by gas chromatography of their trimethyl-silyl derivatives, which were formed by reaction with N-trimethylsilylimid-azole. The borate buffer from the anion-exchange separation {{was removed from the}} samples before the derivatives were made. Gas-chromatographic retention data have been determined for 37 carbohydrates, including pen-toses, hexoses, hexosamines, disaccharides, and trisaccharides, and are <b>tabulated</b> as methylene <b>unit</b> (MU) values. These various classes of carbo-hydrates elute within distinct MU regions, generally in the order of increas-ing molecular weight. More than one peak is obtained for those sugars existing in more than one anomeric form.

5000|$|In 2013, Forbes {{published}} a story titled [...] "Here's How You Buy Your Way Onto The New York Times Bestsellers List." [...] The article discusses how ResultSource, a San Diego-based marketing consultancy, specializes in ensuring books make a bestseller list, even guaranteeing a No. 1 spot for {{those willing to}} pay enough. The New York Times was informed of this practice and responded: “The New York Times comprehensively tracks and <b>tabulates</b> the weekly <b>unit</b> sales of all titles reported by book retailers as their general interest bestsellers. We will not comment beyond our methodology on the other questions." [...] The New York Times did not alert its readers to this, unlike The Wall Street Journal, which admitted that books had landed on its bestseller list due to ResultSource's campaign. Soren Kaplan, the source who admitted he had paid ResultSource to land his book, Leapfrogging, on The Wall Street Journal's bestseller list, revealed the methodology on his blog; he posted: [...] "If I could obtain bulk orders before Leapfrogging was released, ResultSource would purchase the books on my behalf using their tried-and-true formula. Three thousand books sold would get me on The Wall Street Journal bestseller list. Eleven thousand would secure {{a spot on the}} biggest prize of them all, The New York Times list." ...|$|R
