5|$|An {{online game}} {{based on the}} series was {{developed}} for GSN's website midway through the show's first season. The game allows online users to answer questions seen on the actual show. Answering {{a certain amount of}} questions correctly allows players <b>to</b> <b>level</b> up and face more difficult questions; a total of 34 levels are available.|$|E
5|$|Another {{interviewer}} further {{asked of}} the developers of the removals of other features from previous {{entries in the}} series, including dual screen play, leveling up, Survival mode, Combat mode, and Hard mode. The dual-screen play was removed, with the developers commenting that while {{it could have been}} implemented, it did not need to be, and the full use of the dual screens for viewing intel on units and terrain allowed the gameplay to proceed more seamlessly. The ability <b>to</b> <b>level</b> up players' Commanding Officers was introduced in Days of Ruins predecessor, , the developers commenting that the gameplay centered around how well players used their commanding officer. This mechanic was replaced by the ability <b>to</b> <b>level</b> up individual units, commenting that this mechanic required players to work strategically with how they deploy their units. The Survival and Combat modes were removed due to not fitting with the redesign of the world, preferring to have a more focused game. Finally, Hard mode was removed due to the developers feeling that the Normal mode was designed {{in such a way that}} a widespread audience could enjoy it. They also commented that earning a high ranking in this mode by doing a good job was effectively the same as Hard mode.|$|E
5|$|At {{approximately}} 8:13pm, the aircraft's {{tail section}} sustained a sudden upward movement, significant enough to require trimming {{to bring the}} plane back <b>to</b> <b>level</b> flight. At approximately 10:15pm, Scott and Rataczak landed the 727, with the aft airstair still deployed, at Reno Airport. FBI agents, state troopers, sheriff's deputies, and Reno police surrounded the jet, as it {{had not yet been}} determined with certainty that Cooper was no longer aboard; but an armed search quickly confirmed that he was gone.|$|E

5000|$|From {{the ground}} floor, {{there are three}} groups of lifts. The [...] "short haul" [...] group of 6 lifts take {{passengers}} <b>to</b> floors between <b>level</b> 2/3 and level 16/17. The [...] "mid haul" [...] group of six lifts take passengers <b>to</b> floors between <b>level</b> 18/19 and level 37/38. There is also a set of shuttle lifts that take passengers directly <b>to</b> <b>levels</b> 41/42. <b>To</b> get <b>to</b> <b>levels</b> above 41/42, passengers must take the shuttle lifts, then change to lifts to the upper floors. These connecting lifts are directly above the lifts that serve <b>levels</b> 2 <b>to</b> 38. The pattern now repeats with the upper levels, one set serving <b>levels</b> 43/44 <b>to</b> 57/58 and one set serving <b>levels</b> 59/60 <b>to</b> <b>levels</b> 73/74.|$|R
5|$|Brown again guided Scotland to {{qualification}} {{for a major}} {{tournament in}} 1998, and Scotland were drawn against Brazil in the opening game of the 1998 World Cup. John Collins equalised from the penalty spot <b>to</b> <b>level</b> the score at 1–1, but a Tom Boyd own goal led to a 2–1 defeat. Scotland drew their next game 1–1 with Norway in Bordeaux, but the final match against Morocco ended in an embarrassing 3–0 defeat.|$|E
5|$|D0g {{retrieves}} Gordon {{out from}} under some junk outside the Citadel, and Gordon reunites with Alyx, who is relieved to see him. Alyx contacts Eli Vance and Isaac Kleiner, who have escaped the city, and is informed the Citadel's core is at risk of exploding at any moment. Kleiner states the explosion could be large enough <b>to</b> <b>level</b> the whole of City 17, {{and the only way}} for them to survive is to re-enter the Citadel and slow the core's progression toward meltdown. Eli reluctantly agrees when he sees no other option.|$|E
5|$|Dirge of Cerberus is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} third-person shooter. Battles occur in real-time, with the HUD displaying {{information such as}} Vincent's hit points and magic points, the currently selected item and quantity thereof, and a cross-hair to aid in targeting enemies. The action is viewed from an over-the-shoulder perspective similar to Resident Evil 4, although players can switch to a first-person perspective if they wish. Defeating enemies yields EXP, {{and at the end}} of each stage, the player can either use that EXP <b>to</b> <b>level</b> up, increasing Vincent's stats, or convert it to Gil (the in-game currency), which can then be used to purchase items and equipment upgrades.|$|E

5|$|Elsewhere {{within the}} palace, three {{servants}} and guards were killed, and about thirty more staff were injured. Outside the palace grounds, an American contractor died after falling from a rooftop {{where he had}} been watching the bombing. Despite the confusion, most of the city's inhabitants went about their usual business, indifferent to the chaos. The attack lasted 30 minutes and though they carried enough bombs <b>to</b> <b>level</b> the palace, the pilots did not expend all their munitions.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{identification}} of a tropical disturbance on November6, a level four Typhoon Condition of Readiness (TCOR), {{the lowest level of}} alert, was raised for Guam. By November8, three days prior to Karen's arrival, this was raised <b>to</b> <b>level</b> three, prompting residents and military personnel to stock up on supplies. A public announcement was made that day as well, warning residents that the typhoon would likely strike the island. At 9:00p.m. on November10 (11:00UTC), a level two TCOR was put in place for Guam and a typhoon emergency was declared. Buildings were boarded up and emergency supplies were distributed. By 8:00a.m. (22:00UTC on November10), this was raised <b>to</b> <b>level</b> one, the highest level of warning. At this time, the USS Haverfield, USS Brister, USS Wandank, and USS Banner sought refuge from the storm over open waters. All personnel on the island were ordered to evacuate to typhoon-proof shelters and emergency rations were prepared. Strategic air command planes stationed on the island were relocated to avoid damage. Many residents on the island sought refuge in government buildings designed to withstand powerful storms while others evacuated to Wake Island. Roughly 24hours after the typhoon's passage, all warnings were discontinued.|$|E
5|$|From {{time to time}} special {{seasonal}} {{festivals and}} events are held. They last only for a set {{period of time and}} offer a variety of fun or useful rewards. Many events have changed over time, adding new features and eliminating old ones. These events are geared towards any level, often restricting players <b>to</b> <b>level</b> 1, so that veterans and novice players alike can join in together. Events celebrated are often thematically based on real life equivalents, for example: Valentione's Day in place of Valentine's Day, the Egg Hunt Egg-stravaganza in place of Easter, and the Starlight Celebration in place of Christmas.|$|E

5|$|In 1917, the 6th Aero Squadron {{was created}} in Honolulu, with Captain John F. Currey as its commander. Although 50 were assigned, only 49 arrived; one deserted en route. Currey chose Ford Island as the {{location}} for the new squadron and bought it from the John Papa ʻĪʻī land trust for $236,000, citing its access to water and winds as assets. When Currey was transferred to Washington, command of the squadron was given to Captain John B. Brooks and then Major Hugh J. Knerr, who built hangars and a runway. Early soldiers had <b>to</b> <b>level</b> the island, removing hills and boulders.|$|E
5|$|In August 1915, Spinks {{was tapped}} {{to join a}} consultative panel of notable players and major billiard hall proprietors to help develop a new handicapping system for balkline billiards, {{organized}} by the Brunswick-Balke-Collender Company, {{at that time the}} organizers of the World Championships. The inspiration for the new system was simply making it possible for the newly ascendant Willie Hoppe to be meaningfully challenged – his near-unassailability was hurting billiard tournament revenues, because the outcome was considered foreordained by many potential ticket-buyers. The system was expected <b>to</b> <b>level</b> the playing field in other ways, especially making it easier for skilled amateurs to enter the professional ranks.|$|E

5|$|In this installment, Link gains {{experience}} {{points to}} upgrade his attack, magic, and life by defeating enemies. This feature is exclusive to Zelda II {{in the game}} series. He can raise each of these attributes {{to a maximum of}} eight levels. Raising a life level will decrease the damage Link receives when hit, raising a magic level will decrease the magic points (MP) cost of spells, and raising an attack level will strengthen his sword's offensive power. Each attribute requires a different amount of experience <b>to</b> <b>level</b> up, with the life level requiring the least number of points <b>to</b> <b>level</b> and attack requiring the most. When enough points are acquired to raise an attribute, the player may choose <b>to</b> <b>level</b> up that attribute or to cancel and continue gaining experience points towards the next level in another attribute. Once Link has raised an attribute to the maximum level of eight, further advances in that attribute will earn Link an extra life, without advancing the attribute itself. Link begins the game with four Heart Containers and four Magic Containers and can acquire up to four more of each, permanently increasing his life points and magic points respectively. Other games in The Legend of Zelda series only allow Link to increase his strength through new weapons, items, and Heart Containers. Certain enemies drain Link's experience when they attack, but he will never lose a level once raised. When a game ends or is saved, the cartridge records Link's current ability levels and the number of experience points required for the next increase, but resets his accumulated points to zero.|$|E
5|$|It {{only took}} three minutes of extra {{time for the}} first goal to be scored. Thompson passed to Byrne, who cross was headed into the Leeds goal by Hunt.
