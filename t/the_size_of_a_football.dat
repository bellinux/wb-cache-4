Surgeons removed a tumor <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>football</b> that had crushed one kidney and his spleen. Further operations were performed in October 1986 and October 1987. He was again hospitalized at the UCLA Medical Center on February3, 1988. A ruptured duodenal ulcer caused kidney failure, and he declined to undergo the dialysis that might have prolonged his life for a few months. Watched over by his wife Gweneth, sister Joan, and cousin Frances Lewine, he died on February15, 1988.|$|E
25|$|Ordinarily, atoms {{are mostly}} {{electron}} clouds by volume, with very compact nuclei {{at the center}} (proportionally, if atoms were <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>football</b> stadium, their nuclei would be the size of dust mites). When a stellar core collapses, the pressure causes electrons and protons to fuse by electron capture. Without electrons, which keep nuclei apart, the neutrons collapse into a dense ball (in some ways like a giant atomic nucleus), with a thin overlying layer of degenerate matter (chiefly iron unless matter of different composition is added later). The neutrons resist further compression by the Pauli Exclusion Principle, in a way analogous to electron degeneracy pressure, but stronger.|$|E
25|$|On May 10, 1994, {{at the age}} of 30, McKagan became gravely ill due to acute alcohol-induced pancreatitis, {{which caused}} his {{pancreas}} to swell to <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>football</b> and leak digestive enzymes into his body. He was taken to Northwest Hospital and Medical Center in Seattle, where he was monitored until the swelling went down. He was told by his doctors that he would be dead within a month if he did not stop drinking. He had made previous efforts to curb his drinking, but this health crisis was his incentive to become sober for good. In his autobiography, he attributed his sobriety to exercise through first mountain biking, and later martial arts.|$|E

A natural subject for investigation {{is what happens}} when we parameterize such a problem by various other parameters, some of which may be the values of optimal solutions to different problems.

In this paper, we investigate seven natural vertex problems, along with their respective parameters: <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> maximum independent set, <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> minimum vertex cover, <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> maximum clique, <b>the</b> chromatic number, <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> minimum dominating set, <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> minimum independent dominating set and <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> minimum feedback vertex set.

40|$|We {{introduce}} a technique using linear programming {{that may be}} used to analyse the worst-case performance <b>of</b> <b>a</b> class <b>of</b> greedy heuristics for certain optimisation problems on regular graphs. We demonstrate the use of this technique on heuristics for bounding <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> minimum maximal matching (MMM), a minimum connected dominating set (MCDS) and a minimum independent dominating set (MIDS) in cubic graphs. As a result, we show that for n-vertex connected cubic graphs, <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> MMM is at most 9 n/ 20 + O(1), <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> MCDS is at most 3 n/ 4 + O(1) and <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> MIDS is at most 29 n/ 70 + O(1).

25|$|Wetlands {{in general}} are a {{valuable}} resource both economically and environmentally. For instance, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service determined wetlands covered only 5% of the land surface of the contiguous 48 United States, but they support 31% of the nation's plant species. These very biodiverse systems provide resources, shelter, nesting sites, and resting sites (particularly Louisiana’s coastal wetlands such as Grand Isle for migratory birds) to {{a wide array of}} wildlife. Human users also receive many benefits from wetlands, such as cleaner water, storm surge protection, oil and gas resources (especially on the Gulf Coast), reduced flooding, and chemical and biological waste reduction, to name a few. In Louisiana, rapid wetland loss occurs due to a variety of reasons; this state loses an estimated area about <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>football</b> field every hour.|$|E
25|$|That 1975 map, {{the first}} Cahill-Keyes projection, {{launched}} a decades long quest to perfect it. One of his goals is a map with a 1:1 million scale, about half <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>football</b> field. Each one degree geocell would {{be large enough}} to stand in. While the physical Master Map as he calls it, remains a dream, in 2010, his partner Mary Jo Graça, using Keyes's extensive calculations, plotted the entire projection and in 2011 digitized the entire map. Absent the physical version, a 9,000 square foot pdf of that full size map can be easily navigated on a home computer. It is the first contiguous world map at a resolution showing all one-degree geocells (except five degrees at the poles). Keyes likewise commissioned the first-ever one-degree globe from Joe Roubal in 2013.|$|E
25|$|Over the years, some of {{the most}} {{prominent}} projects at the University have been associated with the Department of Physics. In 1948, the university built the first betatron facility in Canada. Three years later, the world's first non-commercial cobalt-60 therapy unit was constructed. (The first female Chancellor of the University, Sylvia Fedoruk, {{was a member of the}} cobalt-60 research team. She also served as Saskatchewan's Lieutenant-Governor from 1988–1994.) The success of these facilities led to the construction of a linear accelerator as part of the Saskatchewan Accelerator Laboratory in 1964 and placed university scientists at the forefront of nuclear physics in Canada. Experience gained from years of research and collaboration with global researchers led to the University of Saskatchewan being selected as the site of Canada's national facility for synchrotron light research, the Canadian Light Source. This facility opened October 22, 2004 and is <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>football</b> field. The Plasma Physics Laboratory operates a tokamak on campus. The University used the SCR-270 radar in 1949 to image the Aurora for the first time.|$|E

40|$|Network {{controllability}} is {{an important}} topic in wide-ranging research fields. However, the relationship between controllability and network structure is poorly understood, although degree heterogeneity is known to determine the controllability. We focus on <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> minimum dominating set (MDS), <b>a</b> measure <b>of</b> network controllability, and investigate the effect of degree-degree correlation, which is universally observed in real-world networks, on <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> MDS. We show that disassortativity or negative degree-degree correlation reduces <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> MDS using analytical treatments and numerical simulation, whereas positive correlations hardly affect <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> MDS. This result suggests that disassortativity enhances network controllability. Furthermore, apart from the controllability issue, the developed techniques provide new ways of analyzing complex networks with degreedegree correlations...|$|R
