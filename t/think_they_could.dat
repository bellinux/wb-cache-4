Gates was enamored with APL but Allen did not <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> sell this product. Interest in the APL project faded and the software was never completed.|$|E
500|$|No {{business}} {{of any kind}} was being conducted downtown. Organizers planned to flood the downtown area businesses with black people. Smaller groups of decoys were set out to distract police attention from activities at the 16th Street Baptist Church. Protesters set off false fire alarms to occupy the fire department and its hoses. One group of children approached a police officer and announced, [...] "We {{want to go to}} jail!" [...] When the officer pointed the way, the students ran across Kelly Ingram Park shouting, [...] "We're going to jail!" [...] Six hundred picketers reached downtown Birmingham. Large groups of protesters sat in stores and sang freedom songs. Streets, sidewalks, stores, and buildings were overwhelmed with more than 3,000 protesters.

500|$|Pistrucci {{submitted}} a lengthy letter of advice {{to aid in}} hardening the dies, with commentary on other matters interspersed; he had the letter published in the numismatic press. The matrices were each submitted in two pieces, a ring and core, and Pistrucci cautioned that successfully making dies from them was no certainty, [...] "an accident produced by carelessness or inattention might in one moment entirely destroy the whole work, and without remedy". The matrices were [...] in diameter; Mint officials did not <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> be hardened and converted to dies without the likelihood of major damage. A few electrotypes were made from the matrices, along with some soft impressions, but no medals were struck. Improving relations between Britain and France made presentation of medals recalling Waterloo impolitic.

[...] He complimented Sherri Shepherd's guest spot, writing that it was a great way to bring her back [...] "into the mix". He also liked that this episode [...] "delivered some great work" [...] from Alec Baldwin. In conclusion, Canning gave the episode a 9.3 out of 10 rating. Television columnist Alan Sepinwall for The Star-Ledger appreciated Jenna's subplot as it was [...] "the first really work-centric one in a while." [...] He complimented Peter Dinklage's appearance, but was less enthusiastic about Salma Hayek being a love interest for Baldwin's Jack, citing that he did not buy her in the Elisa role. Kona Gallagher of AOL's TV Squad said that Dinklage, Hayek, and Shepherd [...] "fit into the episode, instead of feeling like the episode was written around them." [...] Gallagher noted that Dinklage was [...] "pretty awesome" [...] as Tina Fey's love interest, [...] "and I would have loved to see more of them together. I really <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> have done more with this storyline." [...] According to Gallagher, the only part of [...] "Señor Macho Solo" [...] that she was not [...] "crazy about" [...] was Jenna playing Janis Joplin.|$|E

Sukhdev Sandhu of The Daily Telegraph argued that [...] "Chigurh never develops as a character [...] with material as strong as this, one would <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> do better than impute to him a sprawling inscrutability, a mystery that is merely pathological." [...] He further accused it of being full of [...] "pseudo profundities in which [...] have always specialised." [...] In The Washington Post, Stephen Hunter criticized Chigurh's weapons as unintentionally humorous and lamented, [...] "It's all chase, which means that it offers almost zero in character development. Each of the figures is given, a la standard thriller operating procedure, a single moral or psychological attribute and then acts in accordance to that principle and nothing else, without doubts, contradictions or ambivalence." ...|$|E
