5|$|The Soviets shelled {{the area}} {{in and around the}} Reich Chancellery on and off during the afternoon. SS guards brought over {{additional}} cans of petrol to further burn <b>the</b> <b>corpses.</b> Linge later noted the fire did not completely destroy the remains, as <b>the</b> <b>corpses</b> were being burned in the open, where the distribution of heat varies. <b>The</b> <b>corpses</b> burned from 16:00 to 18:30. At approximately 18:30, Lindloff and Reisser covered up the remains in a shallow bomb crater.|$|E
5|$|According to Ian Kershaw, <b>the</b> <b>corpses</b> of Braun and Hitler {{were already}} {{thoroughly}} burned when the Red Army found them, {{and only a}} lower jaw with dental work could be identified as Hitler's remains.|$|E
5|$|At {{the funeral}} parlour, Rose wakes up {{along with the}} newly-reanimated corpses of Mrs. Peace and Mr. Redpath. The Doctor and Dickens arrive and break into the parlour {{just in time to}} rescue Rose. After hearing about the trouble with <b>the</b> <b>corpses,</b> the Doctor convinces Gwyneth to help him hold a séance to attempt to {{communicate}} with the dead. The blue vapors fill the room and reveal that they are the remains of the Gelth, a once-corporeal alien race until they were devastated by the Time War. They plead with the Doctor to open the rift that exists {{in the basement of the}} parlour and allow them to cross over. The Doctor offers the Gelth temporary use of <b>the</b> <b>corpses</b> until he can transport them to a place where they can build new bodies, using Gwyneth as a bridge to cross the Rift.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>corpse</b> is {{washed and}} placed on tiger or deer skin or a bed of kusha grass. The hair and feet of <b>the</b> <b>corpse</b> may be tied. <b>The</b> <b>corpse</b> is {{believed}} to be a vessel of power while the rite is performed and tying the hair ensures that the energy does not escape. Another interpretation states that the bondage reflects the practitioner's desire to control the spirit of <b>the</b> <b>corpse.</b> Then, <b>the</b> sadhaka will sit on <b>the</b> <b>corpse</b> for meditation. In Shakta narratives, betel nut is put into <b>the</b> <b>corpse's</b> mouth and it is turned on its back and smeared with sandalwood paste. Shakta sandhakas draw a yantra on the back of <b>the</b> <b>corpse</b> and sit on it. The 64 yoginis and the guardians of the directions are worshipped with vegetarian offerings. The corpse-seat is again worshipped and the practitioner mounts <b>the</b> <b>corpse</b> like one sits on a horse. Another tradition says that the practitioner is expected to sit in Virasana ("the heroic pose"). The Tantrasara narrates that the practitioner should get off <b>the</b> <b>corpse</b> to draw a triangle or protective circle around him and <b>the</b> <b>corpse</b> or again to scatter mustard or sesame seeds in all directions.|$|R

5|$|Harrison's troops buried {{their own}} {{dead on the}} site of their camp. They built large fires over the mass grave in an attempt to conceal it from the Native Americans. After Harrison's troops {{departed}} the area, the Native Americans returned to the grave site, digging up many of <b>the</b> <b>corpses</b> in retaliation and scattering the bodies.|$|E
5|$|Sonderkommando wearing {{gas masks}} then dragged the bodies from the chamber. The victims' glasses, {{artificial}} limbs, jewelry, and hair were removed, and any dental work was extracted so the gold could be melted down. <b>The</b> <b>corpses</b> were {{burned in the}} nearby incinerators, and the ashes were buried, thrown in the river, or used as fertilizer.|$|E
50|$|In Shakta ritual as {{described}} in <b>the</b> Tantrasara, <b>the</b> <b>corpse</b> is worshipped with flowers and invoked {{as a form of}} Bhairava (a form of Shiva) and the seat of the Goddess and requested to awaken to please <b>the</b> Goddess.The <b>corpse</b> is washed and placed on tiger or deer skin or a bed of kusha grass.

50|$|These {{containers}} {{slow the}} decomposition process by (partially) physically blocking decomposing bacteria and other organisms from accessing <b>the</b> <b>corpse.</b> An additional benefit of using containers {{to hold the}} body {{is that if the}} soil covering <b>the</b> <b>corpse</b> is washed away by a flood or some other natural process then <b>the</b> <b>corpse</b> will still not be exposed to open air.|$|R
5|$|Sonderkommandos (special work crews {{forced to}} work at the gas chambers) wearing gas masks then dragged the bodies from the chamber. The victims' glasses, {{artificial}} limbs, jewelry, and hair were removed, and any dental work was extracted so the gold could be melted down. If the gas chamber was crowded, which they typically were, <b>the</b> <b>corpses</b> were found half-squatting, their skin discolored pink with red and green spots, with some found foaming at their mouths, or bleeding from their ears. <b>The</b> <b>corpses</b> were burned in the nearby incinerators, and the ashes were buried, thrown in the river, or used as fertilizer. With the Soviet Red Army approaching through Poland, the last mass gassing at Auschwitz took place on 30 October 1944. In November 1944, Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler, head of the SS, ordered gassing operations to cease across the Reich.|$|E
5|$|The webs of spiders {{on which}} Portia species prey {{sometimes}} contain dead insects and other arthropods which are uneaten or partly eaten.

Despite Đôn's investigation, no one was ever charged with the killings.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} <b>the</b> ritual, <b>the</b> <b>corpse</b> is {{freed from}} his bondage of rope and bathed again. <b>The</b> <b>corpse</b> is buried or {{immersed}} in a body of water. All articles of worship are also cast into the water.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>corpse</b> reviver {{appears in}} {{literature}} {{as early as}} an issue of Punch in 1861. An early recipe for <b>the</b> <b>corpse</b> reviver is found in literature as early as 1903.|$|R

5|$|About 120 SS {{personnel}} {{were assigned to}} the gas chambers and lived on site at the crematoria. Several SS personnel oversaw the killings at each gas chamber, while the bulk of the work was done by the mostly Jewish prisoners known as Sonderkommandos (special squads). Sonderkommando responsibilities included guiding victims to the gas chambers and removing, looting, and cremating <b>the</b> <b>corpses.</b>|$|E
5|$|Causes {{of death}} of adult ibis {{are not well}} known. Alligators could feasibly prey on nesting ibises {{but there has been}} little {{research}} in the area. A flock of fifty adult American white ibis were killed in a fire in the Everglades. <b>The</b> <b>corpses</b> were found in a dense swathe of cattail (Typha angustifolia), which suggested they had taken shelter there. It is unclear why they {{had not been able to}} fly away from the fire, but one hypothesis was that they had been foraging for insects disturbed by the fire.|$|E
5|$|In the episode, alien time {{traveller}} the Doctor (Christopher Eccleston) and {{his companion}} Rose Tyler (Billie Piper) travel to Victorian Cardiff on Christmas, 1869 where {{there have been}} sightings of strange gas-like creatures. The Doctor and Rose team up with Charles Dickens (Simon Callow) to investigate Mr Sneed (Alan David), a man who runs a funeral parlour where it seems that corpses have come to life. It is revealed that the gaseous Gelth (voiced by Zoe Thorne) have entered Cardiff through a Rift, and wish to survive by taking over <b>the</b> <b>corpses.</b>|$|E

50|$|Days later, {{the priest}} figures that <b>the</b> <b>corpse</b> must be nearby, since he connects the strange lack of {{birds in the}} area with the ominous close {{presence}} of a cadaver. Using magic, he summons <b>the</b> <b>corpse</b> to his hut. Xixo and his family frantically chase <b>the</b> <b>corpse.</b> After <b>the</b> <b>corpse</b> reunites with his descendant, the priest proves to Xixo that it belongs to them, and Xixo eventually agrees. After {{a few more days}} of living together, they prepare to part ways with the bushmen and Xixo leads them to the main path to civilisation. However, the rival clan is still after what Xixo's homeland has as a natural abundance: diamonds, as they invade the huts and threaten <b>the</b> residents. <b>The</b> <b>corpse,</b> feeling obligated to aid Xixo and his family, goes back, with the priest and the descendant following. A battle takes place between the villains and Xixo's people, with <b>the</b> <b>corpse</b> managing to chase away one of the ruthless leaders. The priest even summons the spirit of the late Bruce Lee to aid Xixo, and the villains are finally defeated. The priest uses the radio left in the villains' Jeep to contact a helicopter. Before boarding, the priest, the descendant, and <b>the</b> <b>corpse</b> bid farewell to Xixo and his family.|$|R
50|$|The {{first step}} of {{preparing}} for burial is bathing <b>the</b> <b>corpse</b> by perfumed water and dressing it in the traditional death dress made of silk or sambe hempen fabric. Then, <b>the</b> <b>corpse</b> is wrapped up into a hemp quilt and bound with ropes seven times. After <b>the</b> <b>corpse</b> is fully dressed, the coffin's lid will be tightly sealed {{and placed in a}} dry and secure place within the house.|$|R
5|$|On 30 April 1945, when Soviet {{troops were}} within {{a block or}} two of the Reich Chancellery, Hitler shot himself and Braun bit into a cyanide capsule. Their bodies were carried outside to the bombed-out garden behind the Reich Chancellery, where they were placed in a bomb crater and doused with petrol. <b>The</b> <b>corpses</b> were set on fire as the Red Army {{shelling}} continued. Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz and Joseph Goebbels assumed Hitler's roles as head of state and chancellor respectively.|$|E
5|$|The Magyars buried their dead, {{laying the}} {{deceased}} {{on their backs}} with the arms resting along their bodies or upon their pelvises. A deceased warrior's tomb always contained material connected with his horse. These are most frequently its skin, skull, and the lower legs; these were put into its master's grave, but occasionally only the harness was buried together with the warrior, or the horse's skin was stuffed with hay. The Magyars rolled <b>the</b> <b>corpses</b> in textiles or mats and placed silver plates on the eyes and the mouth.|$|E
5|$|The {{bodies of}} Warwick and Montagu {{were laid out}} 'on the morrow after' and 'openly shewed and naked' in St. Paul's, to prevent rumour {{starting}} that they had in fact survived the battle; Warkworth too said that the King personally directed this, and arranged for <b>the</b> <b>corpses</b> 'to {{be put in a}} cart... to be laid in the church of Paul's, on the pavement, that every man might see them; and so they lay for three or four days' before granting permission to their brother George for their burial at Bisham Priory.|$|E
25|$|Ancient swords {{are often}} found at burial sites. The sword was often {{placed on the}} right side of <b>the</b> <b>corpse.</b> However, there are {{exceptions}} to this. A lot of times the sword was kept over <b>the</b> <b>corpse.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In 897, Pope Stephen VI had <b>the</b> <b>corpse</b> of Pope Formosus disinterred and put {{on trial}} during the Cadaver Synod. Found guilty, <b>the</b> <b>corpse</b> had three of its fingers cut and was later thrown in the Tiber.|$|R
5000|$|While {{many of the}} super-heroes {{realize that}} <b>the</b> <b>corpse</b> found is not Bruce's, Dick being unsure decides to carry out Jason's {{suggestion}} and revive Bruce's <b>corpse.</b> However, <b>the</b> creature that emerges is murderous and unintelligible, Darkseid's perfect clone of Batman, Dick fights <b>the</b> <b>corpse</b> but is severely overcome. Eventually, <b>the</b> <b>corpse</b> makes its way back to Gotham where it finds Damian, but before it can kill its [...] "sons", it collapses and dies.|$|R
5|$|The book {{accompanied}} {{an exhibition}} of 60 lynching postcards from 1880 to 1960, Witness: Photographs of Lynchings from the Collection of James Allen, which opened at the Roth Horowitz Gallery in New York in January 2000. Allen argued that lynching photographers were more than passive spectators. They positioned and lit <b>the</b> <b>corpses</b> {{as if they were}} game birds, he wrote, and the postcards became {{an important part of the}} act, emphasizing its political nature.|$|E
5|$|The entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae {{attacks and}} kills crickets {{and has been}} used as the basis of control in pest populations. The insects are also {{affected}} by the cricket paralysis virus, which has caused high levels of fatalities in cricket-rearing facilities. Other fatal diseases that have been identified in mass-rearing establishments include Rickettsia and three further viruses. The diseases may spread more rapidly if the crickets become cannibalistic and eat <b>the</b> <b>corpses.</b>|$|E
5|$|To provide {{realistic}} bodies while preventing <b>the</b> <b>corpses</b> from moving, after {{a lengthy}} casting process the crew chose extras who could lie as still as possible. For the bath house owner Tsuyako Yamashita, this was not possible owing {{to the need to}} see her alive first, and a search for a body double was unfruitful. Ultimately, the crew used digital effects to transplant a still image of the actor during the character's funeral scene, allowing for a realistic effect.|$|E
