5|$|Hughes {{insisted that}} there was nothing more they could do to deter Rhodesia directly; they had already {{threatened}} to expel Rhodesia's representative from the British Embassy in Washington, with no effect.

5|$|Meg asks Lois and Peter if she {{can have}} a {{birthday}} party, preferably a teenager-type party with a band playing at her house. Unfortunately, Peter and Lois don't even know how old Meg is going to be.

Meg notices that her birthday party is kiddie-type, with games such as Pin the Tail on the Donkey.|$|E

5|$|In March 2010, Blue Demon, Jr., the {{president}} of NWA Mexico, sent letters to CMLL, <b>telling</b> <b>them</b> to stop promoting the NWA-branded championships since they {{were not part of}} the NWA. NWA Mexico had previously tried to reclaim the three NWA-branded championships promoted by CMLL, but was ignored by CMLL. The promotion did not directly respond to the latest claim either; the NWA Welterweight Champion, Mephisto, commented, simply stating that the titles belonged to CMLL. Finally, on August 12, 2010, CMLL debuted the new NWA World Historic Light Heavyweight Championship and returned the old title to NWA.|$|E
5|$|On June 27, the Fillmore East closed, and {{the band}} were invited to play a final, invitation-only concert, along with Edgar Winter, the Beach Boys and Country Joe McDonald.

5|$|The Chartered Company's native commissioners {{began to}} fear a {{possible}} tribal rebellion during early 1915. Herbert Taylor, the chief native commissioner, believed that foreign missionaries were secretly encouraging rural black people {{to emulate the}} Chilembwe revolt in Nyasaland, and <b>telling</b> <b>them</b> (falsely) that the British were exterminating the natives there. There were few actual attempts to topple the administration in Southern Rhodesia, but the Company still took precautions. Aware that Mashona svikiro (spirit mediums) had been instrumental in inciting and leading insurgencies against Company rule during the late 1890s, the native commissioners enacted new legislation designed to imprison any svikiro who gained significant popularity.|$|E
5|$|The rumored Ho-Chunk {{attack on}} Fort Crawford never came, {{and so in}} October 1826, Colonel Snelling moved the {{garrison}} to Fort Snelling, where he hoped to reduce hostilities between the Dakotas (Sioux) and the Ojibwes (Chippewas). The two Ho-Chunk prisoners were also moved to Fort Snelling. In May 1827, after Dakotas attacked an Ojibwe party near Fort Snelling, Colonel Snelling arrested four of the Dakotas and turned {{them over to the}} Ojibwes, who killed them. This angered some Dakotas, who encouraged the Ho-Chunks to help them strike at the Americans, falsely <b>telling</b> <b>them</b> that the Ho-Chunks prisoners had also been turned over to the Ojibwes for execution.|$|E
