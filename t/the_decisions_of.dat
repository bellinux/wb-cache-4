5|$|World War II {{broke out}} shortly after Minton joined the court, {{creating}} {{a flood of}} cases in which legal precedent provided little guidance, including challenges to wartime measures, selective service laws, price controls, rationing and civil liberties. In {{the majority of these}} cases, the court affirmed <b>the</b> <b>decisions</b> <b>of</b> the district courts, but in several the court was required to establish a precedent. Minton stated on several occasions his personal preference to affirm <b>the</b> <b>decisions</b> <b>of</b> the lower courts. He believed that the court that heard the case and pronounced judgment was generally able to make a decision that was superior to appellate courts' decisions. He believed the appellate process should be reserved for the more serious cases and cases where the lower court had clearly made a mistake.|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this study are; 1) to analyze the influence of variable on political distribution to <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>of</b> selecting <b>the</b> candidate; 2) to analyze the influence of variable on political distribution to <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>of</b> selecting <b>the</b> political party; 3) to analyze the influence <b>of</b> variable on <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>of</b> selecting <b>the</b> candidate to <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>of</b> selecting <b>the</b> political party; and 4) to analyze {{the influence of the}} role of mediating variable on <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>of</b> selecting <b>the</b> candidate to <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> to <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>of</b> selecting <b>the</b> political party. This study is conducted by using an explanatory approach. Four hypotheses that are formulated from the goals of study will be proved in this study.

He later retracted his statement, commending Botija and referred to the disc as his best, only lamenting he could not record José's lesser known songs. José expressed satisfaction with the result.|$|E

Cuthbert sent his deacon Cynebert to Pope Gregory III after the council with a report on the council and its resolutions. This action may have been taken in response to Boniface's complaints about Cuthbert and Æthelbald to the papacy.

No popular observations on the necessity of protecting the citizen from executive oppression, no animated address calculated to enlist the passions or prejudices of an audience in defence of his motion, imposed on me the necessity of vindicating my opinion.

5|$|After Diocletian's {{reform of}} the provinces, {{governors}} were called iudex, or judge. The governor became responsible for his decisions first to his immediate superiors, {{as well as to}} the more distant office of the emperor. It was most likely at this time that judicial records became verbatim accounts of what was said in trial, making it easier to determine bias or improper conduct on the part of the governor. With these records and the Empire's universal right of appeal, Imperial authorities probably had a great deal of power to enforce behavior standards for their judges. In spite of Diocletian's attempts at reform, the provincial restructuring was far from clear, especially when citizens appealed <b>the</b> <b>decisions</b> <b>of</b> their governors. Proconsuls, for example, were often both judges of first instance and appeal, and the governors of some provinces took appellant cases from their neighbors. It soon became impossible to avoid taking some cases to the emperor for arbitration and judgment. Diocletian's reign marks the end of the classical period of Roman law. Where Diocletian's system of rescripts shows an adherence to classical tradition, Constantine's law is full of Greek and eastern influences.|$|E
