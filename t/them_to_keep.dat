5|$|The Brazilian {{team won}} the tournament {{for the third time}} in 1970, {{allowing}} <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the real trophy in perpetuity, as had been stipulated by Jules Rimet in 1930. It was put on display at the Brazilian Football Confederation headquarters in Rio de Janeiro in a cabinet with a front of bullet-proof glass.|$|E
5|$|From 1930 to 1970, the Jules Rimet Trophy {{was awarded}} to the World Cup winning team. It was {{originally}} simply known as the World Cup or Coupe du Monde, but in 1946 it was renamed after the FIFA president Jules Rimet who set up the first tournament. In 1970, Brazil's third victory in the tournament entitled <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the trophy permanently. However, the trophy was stolen in 1983 {{and has never been}} recovered, apparently melted down by the thieves.|$|E

5|$|The Hershey brothers, Jacob, Isaac, John, Paris, and Eli, founded Hershey Creamery Company in 1894, {{with the}} company {{originally}} operating out of the Hershey family's Lancaster County farmhouse. The ice cream was packed in metal-lined wooden containers that the Hershey brothers designed and built. The containers were loaded into trucks with ice packed around <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the ice cream fresh and cold. Salesmen traveled daily routes to deliver product to customers in the county and in surrounding areas.|$|E
5|$|The {{architect}} Jean-Nicolas Huyot gave {{very precise}} instructions to this section.

5|$|Gens and the Judenrat in {{the larger}} ghetto {{were aware of the}} executions in Ponary by the end of September 1941, when {{survivors}} began returning to the ghetto. The survivors, some of them wounded and all of them female, were mostly brought to Gens, and perhaps to the Judenrat, to whom they relayed their stories. Gens urged <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> quiet, and some of the wounded were kept in the hospital to prevent them from repeating their stories. Knowledge of the massacres at Ponary became common in the ghetto by late December 1941 or early January 1942.|$|E

5|$|Schwester Selma and Dr. Wallach adopted {{three girls}} who had been {{abandoned}} in the hospital. One was Samoohah Calderon, whose mother had died and whose father had been drafted into the Turkish army; the infant's grandparents asked <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the baby. The second adoptee, Bolissa, was given to them by her father, who had carried her {{all the way from}} Syria; her mother had died en route. Bolissa was killed in the 1948 Ben Yehuda Street bombing. The third adoptee was named Sarina. The girls grew up on hospital grounds and were sent to school; one of the girls became a nurse; another a dental technician.|$|E
5|$|After {{hosting the}} first few home matches of the {{campaign}} at Selhurst Park—1,054 saw them lose 4–2 to Wigan Athletic in their last home game in London—Wimbledon F.C. received Football League clearance to host matches at the National Hockey Stadium on 19 September 2003, and eight days later played their first match in Milton Keynes, against Burnley. The game drew a crowd of 5,639, including 893 away fans. Wimbledon F.C. went two goals down before coming back to draw 2–2; Dean Holdsworth scored the club's first goal in Milton Keynes. The team struggled {{on and off the}} pitch {{for the rest of the}} season, losing important players regularly as the administrators sold <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the club afloat, and eventually finished bottom of the second-tier First Division. Attendances at the National Hockey Stadium were higher than those at Selhurst Park during the 2002–03 season, but lower than those of the 2001–02 season. The 2–1 defeat to Sunderland on 7 April 2004 that confirmed Wimbledon F.C.'s relegation was attended by 4,800, of whom 2,380 were away fans.|$|E
5|$|Geoffrey is {{mentioned}} {{again in the}} campaigns of the early 1270s, when Palaiologos sent a new commander to the Morea, Alexios Doukas Philanthropenos. In 1270, Geoffrey and his neighbour, the Baron of Akova, joined the Prince's army with 150 horsemen and 200 infantry. The Latin force raided the Byzantine holdings in Laconia, but Philanthropenos avoided being drawn into a pitched battle. A period of relative peace followed due to the ongoing Second Council of Lyon, but in 1275, the mutual truce was broken by the Greeks. Prince William entrusted a force of 50 horse and 200 crossbowmen to Geoffrey, who stationed <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> watch over the defiles of Skorta, but he died of dysentery in late 1275. After his death, Karytaina was increasingly subject to the attacks of the Byzantines, and finally fell to them in 1320.|$|E

5|$|His death {{marked the}} {{effective}} {{end of the}} Bulgarian Empire. Ivan Vladislav's sons were young and inexperienced, and even the strongest Bulgarian leaders doubted the advisability of further resistance. Upon learning {{of the death of}} the Tsar, Basil II left Constantinople. In Adrianople he was met by the brother of Krakra who acknowledged Byzantine authority. His example was followed by the larger part of the Bulgarian nobility who pledged loyalty to Basil II, giving up their fortresses. In Serres, Krakra along with the commanders of 35 castles met the emperor and surrendered, and in Strumitsa he received a message sent by the Empress-dowager Maria to negotiate the surrender of the capital and the country. Basil II richly awarded those who surrendered, allowing <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> their lands, wealth and titles. Short-lived resistance continued under Ivan Vladislav's eldest son Presian II and his brothers, but they also surrendered by the end of 1018.|$|E
5|$|In Celtic folklore, {{the bird}} {{appears on the}} {{shoulder}} of the dying Cú Chulainn, and could also be a manifestation of the Morrígan, the wife of Tethra, or the Cailleach. This idea has persisted, and the hooded crow is associated with fairies in the Scottish highlands and Ireland; in the 18th century, Scottish shepherds would make offerings to <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> them from attacking sheep. In Faroese folklore, a maiden would go out on Candlemas morn and throw a stone, then a bone, then a clump of turf at a hooded crow – if it flew over the sea, her husband would be a foreigner; if it landed on a farm or house, she would marry a man from there, but if it stayed put, she would remain unmarried.|$|E
5|$|The Hamdanids' {{success and}} rule over the Abbasid capital lasted for {{little more than}} a year. They lacked funds and were {{politically}} isolated, finding little support among the Caliphate's most powerful vassals, the Samanids of Transoxiana and the Ikhshidids of Egypt. Consequently, when in late 943 a mutiny broke out among their troops (mostly composed of Turks, Daylamites, Carmathians and only a few Arabs) over pay issues, under the leadership of the Turkish general Tuzun, they were forced to quit Baghdad and return to their base, Mosul. Caliph al-Muttaqi now appointed Tuzun as amir al-umara, but the Turk's overbearing manner induced al-Muttaqi to once again seek refuge in the Hamdanid court. The Hamdanid forces under Sayf al-Dawla took the field against Tuzun's army, but were defeated. The Hamdanids now concluded an agreement with Tuzun which allowed <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the Jazira and even gave them nominal authority over northern Syria (which at the time was not under Hamdanid control), in exchange for an annual tribute of 3.6 million dirhams.|$|E

5|$|Fénix was {{stationed}} in Cádiz in January 1762 {{and spent the next}} two years serving in the Mediterranean Sea, the Straits of Gibraltar, and the Atlantic Ocean. Fénix underwent several large repairs at the Arsenal de la Carraca between 1764 and 1765, where she remained stripped of her armament until 1769, under the command of Francisco Cotiella. In 1778 Fénix was recommissioned under Captain Félix Ignacio deTejada, who was superseded by Captain Francisco Javier deMelgarejo y Rojas when Spain entered the American Revolutionary War in June 1779. Fénix immediately set sail for the English Channel, part of the fleet under Lieutenant General Luis de Córdova y Córdova, which was supposed to meet a French fleet at the Sisgaras Islands, off the northern coast of Spain. This Franco-Spanish Armada of 1779 of more than 60 ships-of-the-line was to escort an invasion force of 40,000 troops across the Channel in a bid to capture the British naval base at Portsmouth. Córdova's ships were delayed by contrary winds, which forced <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> close to the coast of Portugal. In consequence they did not arrive at the rendezvous until 22July, by which time the French, short of supplies, had left. Although the two fleets would eventually unite, Fénix left for the Azores on 23July with a squadron under Lieutenant General Antonio de Ulloa, to protect the Spanish anchorage and to face a British force of which the Spanish had received news.|$|E
5|$|Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) asks Dunder Mifflin CEO David Wallace (Andy Buckley) if he {{can work}} {{part-time}} so he can go to Philadelphia to help with his sports marketing job. David Wallace says {{that he might be}} needed in the office if there is a crisis with one of his clients, to which he responds that Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker) and Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith) have agreed to cover for him, though he in fact has not asked them yet. Stanley and Phyllis respond with their usual disinterest in helping others, so Jim offers to treat them to lunch. Stanley and Phyllis order extra side dishes and help themselves to an excess of wine, annoying Jim with drunken behavior and silencing him whenever he brings up the subject of their covering for him. When they arrive back at the office, a drunk Stanley and Phyllis are seemingly passed out in the backseat of Jim's car. When Jim puts his coat on <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> them warm, Phyllis and Stanley say they will cover for him as they care for Jim and his family, laughing as they reveal they were only pranking him. Jim gives both of them a hug.|$|E
5|$|On May 12, 1898, the United States Navy bombarded San Juan, {{initiating}} the Puerto Rican Campaign. Initially, the Liberal Party supported the Spanish government, although several members agreed with Barbosa. Muñoz Rivera took possession of Chief of the Cabinet's {{position for the}} Autonomous Government on July 21. Four days later, on July 25, the United States Army landed in Guánica led by Nelson A. Miles, beginning the land offensive. On August 13, {{the signing of the}} Treaty of Paris was made public, bringing a halt to all military offensives in Puerto Rico. As part of this amnesty, Spain ceded Cuba and Puerto Rico, converting the archipelago into a possession of the United States under military governorship. The Barbosistas welcomed the American government, but Muñoz Rivera expected <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> Puerto Rico as a possession. He refused to cooperate with the military government and returned to Barranquitas, where he wrote a poem titled Sísifo, comparing Puerto Rico's political situation to Sisyphus' punishment. He subsequently returned to San Juan, accepting a request made by John R. Brooke to continue in his office within the new cabinet. Muñoz Rivera assisted in establishing an insular police. Brooke was replaced by Guy Vernon Henry as military governor. Following this change, both men began having violent discussions, with each one trying to push their positions. Muñoz Rivera would vocally debate several of Brooke's decisions, with both communicating via an interpreter.|$|E

5|$|While some {{ships and}} units such as No 49 Squadron {{returned}} to the UK, most personnel had to remain on Christmas Island. The Minister of Supply gave assurances that no personnel would have {{to remain on the}} island {{for more than a year}} unless absolutely necessary, in which case home leave would be given. To maintain morale, units were given periodic briefings on the importance of their work. Junior officers took a keen interest in the welfare of the men and their families at home, since they were not permitted to bring them to the island. An efficient mail system was maintained to allow <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> in contact. The quality of Army rations was better than at any other British base. The men were given one day a week off work, and sports such as soccer, cricket, tennis, volleyball sailing, fishing and water skiing were organised. Leave was provided that could be taken in Fiji, Hawaii or the Gilbert Islands. To relieve the monotony, some Army personnel ashore exchanged places with some Navy personnel afloat. A Christmas Island Broadcasting Service was established with nightly radio programs.|$|E
