5|$|Aidoo was {{designated}} as the backup running back out of training camp in 2005, with the Tiger-Cats electing to keep only the trio of Troy Davis, Aidoo, and fullback Julian Radlein on the roster as running backs. In August, Aidoo briefly stepped in for Davis after the latter suffered an injured hamstring. Through the first 11 regular season games, Aidoo made two special teams <b>tackles</b> <b>and</b> rushed for 51 yards on six carries. This led The Hamilton Spectator to speculate he would be dropped from the active roster in favor of recently signed running back Jesse Lumsden. After Troy {{was traded to the}} Eskimos, this never came to pass, and Aidoo started as a fullback for the last few games of the season. The Tiger-Cats did not make the playoffs.

Adamm Oliver was a second-team All-ACC selection who was fourth on the team in total <b>tackles</b> <b>and</b> second on the team in tackles for loss. Oliver created the game-winning play for the Yellow Jackets against Miami when he forced a fumble that set up the game-clinching touchdown. Georgia Tech also had several important defensive backs. Safety Jamal Lewis was a first-team All-ACC selection and the team's leading tackler. During the Yellow Jackets' game against Samford University, Lewis returned an interception 97 yards for a touchdown. The return was the fourth-longest in Georgia Tech history and was the longest since a 102-yard return in 1969.|$|E
5|$|After {{losing to}} the New England Patriots in the American Football Conference Championship Game and losing Marcus Washington who joined the Washington Redskins, the Colts shuffled their linebacker lineup and June was listed as a starter when the Colts arrived at mini-camp. At the 2004 Colts {{training}} camp, June competed with Keyon Whiteside for the starting weakside linebacker position. By the end of training camp, June was the starter, and 2004 rookie Gilbert Gardner was the backup. June made his debut as a starter in the opening game against the 2004 Super Bowl champion New England Patriots. That season, the Colts used a 4-3 defense with a fourth linebacker on passing downs. In week 5, June had a team-high ten <b>tackles</b> <b>and</b> his first interception in a 3514 victory over the Oakland Raiders. In week 15, June returned an interception 71yards to the four-yard-line where {{he stepped out of}} bounds with 59seconds remaining in the game at the RCA Dome, the Colts' home stadium. This prompted the fans to chant for Peyton Manning to enter the game to attempt to tie Dan Marino's single-season touchdown pass record. Since the Colts led the game 2010 and had clinched the AFC South division, Manning took a knee instead. Coach Dungy's scheme is designed so that the weakside linebacker is supposed to make the most <b>tackles,</b> <b>and</b> June was the Colts' leading tackler by a wide margin that season. June started every game that season.|$|E
