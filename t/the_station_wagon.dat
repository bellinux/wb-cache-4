25|$|<b>The</b> <b>station</b> <b>wagon,</b> {{added to}} the range in November 1960, lacked the American version's {{extended}} rear overhang due to concern that {{the back of the}} car might scrape on rough roads and spoon drains.|$|E
25|$|Production for {{the model}} year was 31,788 and {{included}} 9 Deliveryman models in <b>the</b> <b>station</b> <b>wagon</b> body, 15,255 Country Club hardtops, 10,598 Convertible Landaus, 10,600 Custom station wagons (of which 3,536 were in the Greenbrier trim and 7,035 with 3M's DI-NOC simulated wood-grain trim), and 1,114 standard wagons.|$|E
25|$|On 1 July 2008, {{almost four}} years after the release of the first Logan, a facelifted version called the Dacia New Logan was announced. The new version {{features}} a more modern design and a more attractive and more comfortable interior. This facelift was adopted on <b>the</b> <b>station</b> <b>wagon</b> in October the same year.|$|E
5000|$|... 2004: For the 2004 model year, the LW200 and <b>the</b> LW300 <b>station</b> <b>wagons</b> {{were both}} renamed as <b>the</b> Saturn L300 <b>station</b> <b>wagon</b> {{so that it}} would match the Saturn L300 sedan. The L-Series had also adopted a type of a trim level {{structure}} that was similar to the trim level structure on the Saturn ION. The L300 sedan and <b>the</b> L300 <b>station</b> <b>wagon</b> models had both used the L300.1, the L300.2, and the L300.3 for both the L300 sedan and <b>the</b> L300 <b>station</b> <b>wagon</b> models. <b>The</b> Saturn L300 <b>station</b> <b>wagon</b> was discontinued after the 2004 model year.|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>Station</b> <b>Wagons</b> saw <b>the</b> first {{expansion}} of the Land Rover range. <b>Station</b> <b>Wagons</b> were fitted with a [...] "Safari Roof" [...] which consisted of a second roof skin fitted {{on top of the}} vehicle. This kept the interior cool in hot weather and reduced condensation in cold weather. Vents fitted in the roof allowed added ventilation to the interior. While they were based on the same chassis and drivetrains as <b>the</b> standard vehicles, <b>Station</b> <b>Wagons</b> carried different chassis numbers, special badging, and were advertised in separate brochures. Unlike <b>the</b> original <b>Station</b> <b>Wagon,</b> <b>the</b> new in-house versions were highly popular.|$|R
2500|$|Inside were revised {{instrument}} panels retaining the [...] "Mirrormatic" [...] speedometer and new upholstery trims. <b>The</b> <b>Station</b> <b>Wagons</b> received an all-vinyl interior as standard, with the regular cloth/vinyl combination interior available as an option.|$|R
25|$|In 1947 a new stamped grille with a {{separate}} upper bar was used. The Roadmaster name appeared in red-filled script on a chrome button within the bumper guard crossbars, front and rear. All new was an Estate wagon body style. It sold 300 units and instantly became {{the top of the}} line in <b>the</b> <b>station</b> <b>wagon</b> market.|$|E
25|$|By this time, <b>the</b> <b>station</b> <b>wagon,</b> panel van, and pickup {{body styles}} {{had all been}} dropped and 1965 was {{the last year for}} the Greenbrier window van, which was {{retained}} mainly for fleet orders, with 1,528 being built. In all, 235,528 Corvairs were built in 1965. Chevrolet replaced the Corvair-based vans with the Chevrolet Sportvan/GMC Handi-Van, which used a traditional front-engine/rear-drive axle borrowed from the Chevy II.|$|E
25|$|The 1988 model line-up was revised, with sport coupe dropped due to low sales. <b>The</b> <b>station</b> <b>wagon</b> line-up {{was reduced}} to one model, an eight-passenger wagon. Engines {{remained}} unchanged, but the four-speed automatic overdrive transmission was standard on all engines and models. Standard equipment for all models included tinted glass, a remote-control driver's mirror, automatic headlight on/off, and an AM/FM stereo. A police version of the Caprice wagon was made; it had the code 1A2 and was designed for special service use.|$|E
50|$|Because of tooling expenses, <b>station</b> <b>wagon</b> bodies — {{which were}} also shared with Chrysler models — {{did not receive}} all of the changes applied to non-wagon models. Most notably, wagons {{continued}} to feature the heavy rear horizontal blade stamping first seen on the 1961 Plymouth <b>wagons.</b> <b>The</b> <b>station</b> <b>wagons</b> continued in both pillared (880) and hardtop (Custom 880) models, although {{this would be the}} final year for the hardtop wagon — Dodge and Chrysler being the last American automotive brands to offer <b>the</b> style. <b>Station</b> <b>wagons</b> also received rectangular taillights that wrapped around the sides of the vehicle.|$|R

50|$|In a {{cost-saving}} decision, <b>the</b> <b>station</b> <b>wagons</b> {{carried over}} <b>the</b> 1966-67 bodies from the cowl back. The Ranch Wagon model name was deleted; Fairlane wagons had either the base or the 500 trim. Base hardtop sales more than doubled, to 44,683 units.|$|R
25|$|Two {{sedan and}} wagon body styles were {{available}} in two trims {{for the duration of}} the Medallion's run. The base models came in DL trim, while the up-level LX models featured more standard features. Standard equipment on all Medallions included a tachometer, digital clock, AM/FM stereo, tinted glass, tilt steering wheel, power steering and brakes, as well as a driver's seat-height adjuster for the reclining front seats. <b>The</b> <b>station</b> <b>wagon</b> also included a locking storage bin, as well as adjustable roof rack and a rear-window wiper.|$|E
25|$|The 1968 {{models were}} fully {{redesigned}} with an extensive restyle on a longer 111-inch wheelbase that gave Chevy's compacts a chassis {{that was just}} one inch shorter {{than that of the}} midsize Chevelle coupe. <b>The</b> <b>station</b> <b>wagon</b> and hardtop sport coupe were discontinued, the former in line with an industry trend which left AMC the only American maker of compact station wagons until Chrysler rejoined the market in 1976 (the 1966–70 Ford Falcon wagon was actually a midsize, using a bodyshell identical to the Fairlane wagon's).|$|E
25|$|In 1954 Land Rover {{launched}} a second iteration station wagon, this time {{aimed at the}} commercial user who needed an off-road vehicle for carrying passengers without car-like comforts. Based on the commercial panel van variant Land Rover, it had seats fitted to the load space and windows cut into the sides. While available with features such as an interior light, heater, door and floor trims and upgraded seats, <b>the</b> <b>station</b> <b>wagon</b> retained the base vehicle's tough and capable suspension - {{as well as its}} mediocre road performance.|$|E

25|$|Interior {{upgrades}} came in {{the form}} of reshaped seats and headrests, new colour schemes and switches. Third-row seating, a cargo barrier, and preinstalled wiring to accommodate mobile phone usage were made available as options for <b>the</b> <b>station</b> <b>wagon</b> variants. Additionally, all models were fitted with an advanced window film known as Smart Tint, which claimed to provide equivalent protection levels of SPF15 sunscreen. For improved vehicle refinement, thicker glass was installed to lessen wind noise and a further insulation was added in the dashboard to produce a quieter ride.|$|E
25|$|Surfers {{represent}} a diverse culture based on riding the waves. Some people practice surfing as a recreational activity while others {{make it the}} central focus of their lives. Surfing culture is most dominant in Hawaii and California because these two states offer the best surfing conditions. However, waves can be found wherever there is coastline, and a tight-knit yet far-reaching subculture of surfers has emerged throughout America. Some historical markers of the culture included the woodie, <b>the</b> <b>station</b> <b>wagon</b> used to carry surfers' boards, as well as boardshorts, the long swim shorts typically worn while surfing. Surfers also wear wetsuits in colder regions.|$|E
25|$|Accounts differ as to {{the next}} {{sequence}} of events. After the collision, Lifsh said that {{the first thing he}} did was to try to lift the car in order to free the two children beneath it. The EMS unit that arrived on the scene about three minutes after the accident said that Lifsh was being beaten and pulled out of <b>the</b> <b>station</b> <b>wagon</b> by three or four men. A volunteer ambulance from the Hatzolah ambulance corps arrived on the scene at about 8:23pm, followed by police and a City ambulance, which took Gavin Cato to Kings County Hospital, arriving at 8:32pm; Cato was pronounced dead shortly thereafter. Volunteers from a second Hatzolah ambulance helped Angela Cato, until a second City ambulance arrived and took her to the same hospital.|$|E

50|$|The new Ramblers {{came only}} as four-door models. Along {{with the usual}} four-door sedan and <b>station</b> <b>wagon</b> was a new four-door hardtop sedan. Rambler also {{introduced}} the industry's first four-door hardtop <b>station</b> <b>wagon</b> in 1956. <b>The</b> <b>station</b> <b>wagons</b> used <b>the</b> same rear doors as the sedans with the back roof dipped lower over the cargo area and featured a standard roof rack. The wagon models were called Cross Country. An innovation for <b>station</b> <b>wagons</b> was Rambler's roll-down tailgate window; competitors' models used upward-hinged windows.|$|R

25|$|As part of {{the shift}} in market {{strategy}} for VAM's Hornet-based compacts for 1975 that included advancements in the American base model and American Rally was {{the introduction of the}} new American ECD or Edición Cantos Dorados (Golden Edges Edition). It represented {{for the first time a}} VAM four-door compact was not an economy base model. The American ECD was VAM's first regular production luxury compact, before it were only the two-door hardtop 1963 and 1965 Rambler American Hardtop (Rambler American 440H in US and Canada) limited editions. The ECD was restricted to the four-door sedan while the 1975 American Rally took the role as the high trim two-door sedan. <b>The</b> <b>station</b> <b>wagon</b> remained a single-edition model. The American ECD was equivalent in the US as the 1975 four-door Hornet DL model.|$|E
25|$|In North America, Datsun marketed the 810 series Bluebird sold as the Datsun 810 from February 1977 to 1980—the direct {{ancestor}} {{of the long}} running Datsun/Nissan Maxima range. The Datsun 810 model line began with the six-cylinder Nissan Bluebird 2000G6 sold in Japan. With a longer nose than the regular Bluebird, to accommodate a longer inline-six engine, it was powered by {{two versions of the}} SOHC L-series I6 engine: a 2.0L displacement for the Japanese market and a 2.4L24E unit (as found in the Datsun 240Z) for the US market. The Bluebird G6 used a carburetor for the base model and fuel injection for the sporty version. The 2.0L engine was good for 122PS JIS (90kW), while the bigger American engine could reach 125hp SAE (93kW). The sport version channeled power through a four-speed manual transmission for the sedan and wagon, five-speed transmission for the coupe. These cars were rear-wheel drive and had a semi-trailing arm rear suspension. <b>The</b> <b>station</b> <b>wagon</b> variant, only sold in North America, had a rear live axle for load carrying reasons. Some fuel-injected versions had automatic transmissions.|$|E
25|$|A two-door Holden Monaro coupé and extended-length luxury Holden Brougham {{were also}} {{introduced}} in mid 1968. For HK, HT, HG and HQ the Holden Monaro carried the ID plate luxury level coding for a Kingswood but never wore Kingswood badges as a production car. HQ-HJ Monaro LS and HQ Monaro LS V8 shared luxury level coding with their respective Premier but also never wore Premier badges. HK-HJ Monaro GTS coupe, HJ Monaro GTS sedan, HT-HQ Monaro GTS V8 coupe and Monaro GTS327/350 coupe (HK-HQ) carried unique luxury level coding. HQ Monaro GTS sedan and HQ Monaro GTS350 sedan shared Kingswood luxury level coding with later examples actually displaying the GTS coupe's Q code on the VIN plate but still retaining the HQ V8 Kingswood's 80469 model coding {{on the body}} plate. The Brougham was replaced in 1971 by the Statesman brand, based upon <b>the</b> <b>station</b> <b>wagon</b> chassis of the then new HQ series. For a complete listing of the HK–WB series Holden cars, see: list of Holden vehicles by series.|$|E
50|$|Carrozzeria Colli {{also made}} <b>the</b> Giulietta <b>station</b> <b>wagon</b> variant called Giulietta Promiscua. Ninety-one {{examples}} of this version were built. Carrozzeria Boneschi also made a few <b>station</b> <b>wagon</b> examples called Weekendina.|$|R
50|$|In 1949, Plymouth {{introduced}} <b>the</b> first all-steel <b>station</b> <b>wagon</b> in <b>the</b> U.S., the two-door Suburban, {{based on}} an automobile platform. In 1950 Plymouth discontinued <b>the</b> woodie <b>station</b> <b>wagon,</b> converting to all steel bodywork. Buick discontinued production of the last North American wood bodywork after the 1953 model year. Morris of England continued to market its Morris Minor Traveller until the late 1960s.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> LA2VV <b>station</b> <b>wagon</b> entered {{production}} in September 1973. The wagon lasted until 1979, until {{being replaced by}} the LA4 wagon.|$|R
25|$|The Arkansas Razorbacks men's {{basketball}} team, who {{had originally}} {{qualified for the}} NCAA tournament, was victimized by an auto accident. Prior to the tournament, two of Arkansas' starters were injured when their station wagon broke down after returning from a scrimmage in Fort Smith, Arkansas. While attempting to fix a flat tire, Deno Nichols and Ben Jones were injured when another car rammed {{into the back of}} <b>the</b> <b>station</b> <b>wagon.</b> Both players were injured and the severity of the accident caused Arkansas to withdraw from the upcoming NCAA tournament. In need of a replacement, the NCAA committee turned to Utah, {{despite the fact that the}} Utes had four losses and had just lost their first round game in the NIT tournament. Utah had one player, Lyman Condie, a medical student, who quit the team to midway through the season to pursue medical school. Additionally, all of Utah's players were raised within 30 miles of the Utah campus. These players included Arnie Ferrin, Fred Sheffield, and Wat Misaka who was of Japanese descent.|$|E
25|$|Lee {{reaches the}} hotel where Clementine is captive where he comes {{face to face with}} her captor, who reveals that he was the owner of <b>the</b> <b>station</b> <b>wagon</b> that the group ransacked after leaving the dairy and lost his family to walkers as a result. Seeking revenge, the {{stranger}} found Clementine on his walkie-talkie and manipulated her into keeping tabs on the group under the guise that he had her parents and had been following them ever since. Realizing that the man is insane, Lee, with Clementine's help, kills him. As Lee and Clementine leave the hotel, Clementine spots her parents, both of whom have turned into walkers, and Lee falls unconscious. Awakening soon after, he realizes he is near conversion, and instructs her to escape the city and meet Omid and Christa at the edge of town. The player can choose to have Lee order Clementine to either kill him or leave him to become a walker, or can opt to do nothing, in which case Clementine will choose based on the culmination of the player's choices within the game.|$|E
25|$|For the North American market, Camrys were {{produced}} in Georgetown, Kentucky by Toyota Motor Manufacturing Kentucky. Introduced in 1991 as a 1992 model year, automatic transmission {{became the only}} option on all but the base and sport model Camrys, whereas previously, a manual transmission was available on the majority of trim levels. In addition to the DX and LE trims, 1992 saw the addition of an XLE luxury trim and the SE sport trim. The SE model differs from the LE and XLE in appearance {{with the addition of}} a standard V6 engine, alloy wheels, a rear spoiler, and black side mirrors as well as the sports suspension from the Lexus ES 300. The range-topping XLE was equipped with leather upholstery along with an electric sunroof and power adjustable driver's seat. <b>The</b> <b>station</b> <b>wagon</b> body styles were offered in a new seven-seat guise, compared to five in the regular wagon and sedan. These station wagon body variants were also made in right-hand drive configuration for export to Japan, badged as Scepter. Wagons were also produced in Australia. This generation of Camry was featured on Car and Driver magazine's Ten Best list for 1992 and 1993.|$|E
5000|$|Body {{styles of}} the Jeepster Commando {{included}} <b>station</b> <b>wagon,</b> convertible, pickup, and roadster. <b>The</b> deluxe <b>station</b> <b>wagon</b> included sliding rear windows and full interior trim [...] - [...] and available two-tone exterior.|$|R
50|$|The Suburban {{series was}} {{discontinued}} for 1962 with <b>the</b> Plymouth <b>Station</b> <b>Wagon</b> models now {{included in the}} Savoy, Belvedere and Fury lines.|$|R
5000|$|For 1970, the Chevelle 300 Deluxe {{series was}} simply called Chevelle and the inline-six engine {{was no longer}} {{available}} in <b>the</b> <b>station</b> <b>wagons.</b> In 1972 <b>the</b> series' model code was changed to 1C. The Nomad, Greenbrier, and Concours names were all dropped for 1973, when the Chevelle was redesigned and the wagons all began sharing series names with other body styles.|$|R
