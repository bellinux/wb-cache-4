25|$|In September 2007, they {{released}} Nil Recurring, an EP of four leftover tracks from the recording sessions for Fear of a Blank Planet. It {{was released on}} Transmission, the band's own record label as a limited edition of 5000 copies that did not <b>take</b> <b>long</b> <b>to</b> sell out through the band's online store, Burning Shed, forcing the band to keep printing more copies. Nevertheless, the EP was reissued on 18 February 2008 on Peaceville Records.|$|E

25|$|With Dublin's {{defeat at}} the hands of English adventurers, and the ongoing entrenchment of the English {{throughout}} Ireland itself, the Crovan dynasty found itself surrounded by a threatening, rising new power in the Irish Sea zone. Despite his original opposition to the English in Dublin, Guðrøðr did not <b>take</b> <b>long</b> <b>to</b> realign himself with this new power, as exemplified though the marital alliance between his daughter, Affrica (died 1219×), {{and one of the most}} powerful incoming Englishmen, John de Courcy.|$|E
25|$|Another World did not <b>take</b> <b>long</b> <b>to</b> {{establish}} {{itself as}} NBC's highest-rated daytime drama, {{although it was}} still behind the then-dominant CBS lineup which would usually occupy the first six places on the ratings chart. Making its debut at 3 p.m. Eastern/2 Central, Another World slowly chipped away at ABC's General Hospital and CBS' daytime version of To Tell the Truth. Its efforts resulted in a swift rise to second place in 1967–1968; the show would remain in {{the upper end of}} the ratings chart until 1978. CBS later tried The Secret Storm, a soap opera that reputedly served as the model for Another World, against it, but to no avail.|$|E
25|$|The {{invention}} of the wheel revolutionized trade and war. It did not <b>take</b> <b>long</b> <b>to</b> discover that wheeled wagons {{could be used to}} carry heavy loads. The ancient Sumerians used the potter's wheel and may have invented it. A stone pottery wheel found in the city-state of Ur dates to around 3429 BCE, and even older fragments of wheel-thrown pottery have been found in the same area. Fast (rotary) potters' wheels enabled early mass production of pottery, but it was the use of the wheel as a transformer of energy (through water wheels, windmills, and even treadmills) that revolutionized the application of nonhuman power sources. The first two-wheeled carts were derived from travois and were first used in Mesopotamia and Iran in around 3000 BCE.|$|E

[...] Levi Buchanan of IGN gave Ridge Racer 6.2/10, {{complaining about the}} problematic controls and saying that the game without the analogue control [...] "feels really lacking". In 2005, a version of Ridge Racer was released for mobile phones under the name Ridge Racer 3D (not {{to be confused with}} the later Ridge Racer 3D for the Nintendo 3DS). On 11 August 2009, this version was ported to Zeebo.|$|E

[...] Cliff Harris, safety for the Cowboys, recalled Campbell as [...] "the hardest-hitting running back I ever played against. He didn't have the elusiveness of an O. J. Simpson.

The show shifted to digital ink and paint animation during its second season in 2000. Executive producer Paul Tibbitt, in 2009, said [...] " [...] The first season of SpongeBob was done {{the old-fashioned way}} on cells, and every cell had to be part-painted, left to dry, paint some other colors.

500|$|Early {{on in the}} {{development}} process, the producers wanted to cast a [...] "brilliant actor" [...] with a strong screen presence. They discussed casting Rupert Penry-Jones {{for the role of}} Adam Carter early in the process, though it took months to finally decide to cast him. Though Penry-Jones was aware of Spooks and its success, he had never seen any episodes. To be interested in the role, he spent a weekend catching up on the entire first and second series. He did not <b>take</b> <b>long</b> <b>to</b> decide, since his last leading role was four years previously, in 2000 in the Channel 4 drama North Square. Adam was originally meant to be older, and more [...] "street." [...] When he found acting [...] "street" [...] was too difficult, Penry-Jones acted more like himself. He had to audition three times before the producers included him, four months before filming commenced.|$|E

500|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Lactarius sanguifluus are edible, and choice. This was noted by Paulet in his {{original}} {{description of the}} species, who wrote: [...] "This fungus is highly prized for use {{by those who are}} acquainted with it, it keeps well: I kept them for a whole year, it hardens without spoiling, then it takes on a taste of morels. The best way to eat is to cook it in the frying pan or on the grill with oil or butter & salt: it does not <b>take</b> <b>long</b> <b>to</b> cook". The mushrooms are sold in rural markets in France, Spain, Turkey, and Yunnan Province, China. They are also collected by locals in the upper valley of the Serchio River in central Italy. In Spain, where the mushroom is esteemed as a culinary delicacy in Catalan cuisine, it is known as níscalos (in Spanish) or rovelló (in Catalan). In Cyprus, it is known as γαιματάς (meaning [...] "the bloody one") and it is widely collected by the locals, but considered inferior to the saffron milk cap (Lactarius deliciosus). In India, young specimens are consumed along with L.deliciosus; and some consider L.sanguifluus to have a better flavor than its more well-known relative. Its English common name is the [...] "bloody milkcap".|$|E
500|$|Although forty-five {{cars were}} {{entered in the}} qualifier, {{according}} to NASCAR's qualifying procedure, only forty-three could race. Each driver ran two laps, with the starting order determined by the competitor's fastest times. Travis Kvapil clinched the first pole position of his career {{with a time of}} 51.109 seconds. He was joined on the grid's front row by Mears in his best qualifying performance of the season. Aric Almirola qualified third, his Dale Earnhardt, Inc. teammate Regan Smith was fourth, and Paul Menard started fifth. Mike Wallace, Joe Nemechek, Tony Raines, Vickers and Martin Truex Jr. rounded out the top ten qualifiers. Of the other drivers in the Chase, Edwards was twelfth, Burton 17th and Johnson 20th. The two drivers that failed to qualify were Sam Hornish Jr. and Patrick Carpentier. After the qualifier Kvapil said, [...] "Definitely qualifying doesn't really mean much as far as your chances to win the race after 500 miles, but we got a good pit selection and we'll have less chance {{to get caught up in}} a wreck early on in the race. It doesn't <b>take</b> <b>long</b> <b>to</b> get shuffled to the back and I'm sure I'll be shuffled in and out throughout the field.
