5|$|The VFD {{controller}} is a solid-state {{power electronics}} conversion system consisting of three distinct sub-systems: a rectifier bridge converter, a direct current (DC) link, and an inverter. Voltage-source inverter (VSI) drives (see 'Generic topologies' sub-section below) {{are by far}} {{the most common type of}} drives. Most drives are AC-AC drives in that they convert AC line input to AC inverter output. However, in some applications such as common DC bus or solar applications, drives are configured as DC-AC drives. The most basic rectifier converter for the VSI drive is configured as a three-phase, six-pulse, full-wave diode bridge. In a VSI drive, the DC link consists of a capacitor which smooths out the converter's DC output ripple and provides a stiff input to the inverter. This filtered DC voltage is converted to quasi-sinusoidal AC voltage output using the inverter's active switching elements. VSI drives provide higher power factor and lower harmonic distortion than phase-controlled current-source inverter (CSI) and load-commutated inverter (LCI) drives (see 'Generic topologies' sub-section below). The drive controller can also be configured as a phase converter having single-phase converter input and <b>three-phase</b> <b>inverter</b> output.|$|E
5000|$|A common {{variation}} of this circuit uses {{just the two}} transistors {{on one side of}} the load, similar to a class AB amplifier. Such a configuration is called a [...] "half bridge". The half bridge is used in some switched-mode power supplies that use synchronous rectifiers and in switching amplifiers. The half-H bridge type is commonly abbreviated to [...] "Half-H" [...] to distinguish it from full ("Full-H") H bridges. Another common variation, adding a third 'leg' to the bridge, creates a <b>three-phase</b> <b>inverter.</b> The <b>three-phase</b> <b>inverter</b> is the core of any AC motor drive.|$|E

40|$|In <b>three-phase</b> <b>inverters</b> used in {{uninterruptible}} {{power supplies}} (UPSs), three-limb inductors and three-limb transformers {{are commonly used}} in consideration of cost and size. However, magnetic coupling exists between the three phases of the inverter, which can result in complex models. When instantaneous feedback control strategies are introduced to achieve high quality output waveforms, the transient analysis of the closed-loop inverters becomes difficult. In this paper, the phenomenon of magnetic coupling in <b>three-phase</b> <b>inverters</b> due to three-limb inductors and three-limb transformers is analyzed. A decoupled dynamic model is derived based on the instantaneous symmetrical components transformation, which comprises three decoupled equivalent circuits of instantaneous symmetrical components. Analyses based on this model indicate that magnetic coupling may {{have a significant impact}} on the performance of <b>three-phase</b> <b>inverters</b> under unbalanced load conditions and transient responses. For <b>three-phase</b> <b>inverters</b> in UPSs with Proportional-Integral-Differential (PID) closed-loop control strategies, the interactive influence between instantaneous closed-loop regulation and magnetic coupling is researched. Finally, a method of reliability analysis and PID controller design for inverters with magnetic coupling is derived. Simulation and experiment results validate the model and conclusions...|$|R

50|$|It is {{important}} to contrast a native <b>three-phase</b> <b>inverter</b> with three single-phase micro-inverters wired to output in three-phase. The later is a relatively common feature of most inverter designs, allowing you to connect three identical inverters together, each across a pair of wires in a three-phase circuit. The result is three-phase power, but each inverter in the system is outputting a single phase. These sorts of solutions do {{not take advantage of}} the reduced energy storage needs outlined above.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{disadvantage}} of the <b>three-phase</b> <b>inverter</b> concept {{is that the}} only sites with three-phase power than can take advantage of these systems. Three-phase is easily available at utility-scale and commercial sites, and it was to these markets that the systems were aimed. However, the main advantages of the microinverter concept involve issues of shading and panel orientation, {{and in the case of}} large systems, these are easily addressed by simply moving the panels around, the benefits of the three-phase micro are very limited compared to the residential case with limited space to work in.|$|E

Each converter supplies two parallel connected traction motors; The traction motors are three phase induction designs with {{two sets of}} 'half' windings for each phase: an individual traction unit includes 8 four-quadrant converters (4QC), and two asynchronous motors. Under DC supply (3 kV, up to 4 kV peak) two <b>three-phase</b> <b>inverter</b> blocks are connected in series; each inverter block supplies one set of 'half' windings on two parallel connected motors. When under 25 kV AC the high voltage supply is stepped down to 2.8 kV, and rectified by four-quadrant converters to an intermediate DC link, which supplies an inverter block powering two parallel connected motors, with the 'half' windings connected in series.|$|E
50|$|Three-phase {{inverters}} {{are used}} for variable-frequency drive applications and for high power applications such as HVDC power transmission. A basic <b>three-phase</b> <b>inverter</b> consists of three single-phase inverter switches each connected {{to one of the}} three load terminals. For the most basic control scheme, the operation of the three switches is coordinated so that one switch operates at each 60 degree point of the fundamental output waveform. This creates a line-to-line output waveform that has six steps. The six-step waveform has a zero-voltage step between the positive and negative sections of the square-wave such that the harmonics that are multiples of three are eliminated as described above. When carrier-based PWM techniques are applied to six-step waveforms, the basic overall shape, or envelope, of the waveform is retained so that the 3rd harmonic and its multiples are cancelled.|$|E
