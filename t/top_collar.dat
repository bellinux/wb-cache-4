5|$|The current New Zealand {{jersey is}} entirely black (currently {{referred}} to as the 'blackest' jersey ever created) except the Adidas logo, the NZRU silver fern on the front and the AIG logo in the lower center (all of which are darkened from previously). The 1884 New Zealand tour to Australia was the first overseas New Zealand rugby tour, and featured clothing very different from today's jersey. Back then, the team donned a dark blue jersey, with gold fern on the left of the jumper. In 1893 the NZRU stipulated at its annual general meeting that the uniform would be black jersey with a silver fern and white knickerbockers. However historic photographs suggest white shorts may have been used instead during these early years. Sometime between 1897 and 1901 there was a change; by 1901 the team met NSW in a black jersey, a canvas <b>top</b> with no <b>collar,</b> and a silver fern.|$|R
30|$|Recycling gas {{drilling}} {{is a new}} drilling technology. This paper can {{be divided}} into three parts, with the purpose of introducing and analyzing the characteristics of this new technology. First, the major equipment characteristic of this technology was introduced. Secondly, compared with conventional gas drilling, Angel’s model was used to analyze the wellbore flow characteristics. Due to the closed loop and the effect of back pressure caused by the equipment, the gas ow rate decreases dramatically during drilling. Apart from this, it is also found that the kinetic energy at the casing shoe is always smaller than that at the <b>top</b> of the <b>collar.</b> The proposing of the drilling limit concept points out the basic difference between the two gas drilling technologies. Lastly, according to the results of the theoretical analysis, gas supplement operations for the wellbore must be conducted. Thus, two gas supplement schemes are presented in this paper, to provide some guidance for field operations.|$|R

5000|$|President Kennedy's death {{certificate}} places the bullet wound to Kennedy's back {{at about the}} third thoracic vertebra. [...] The {{death certificate}} was signed by Dr. George Burkley, the President's personal physician. As interpreted by the House Select Committee on Assassinations Forensic Pathology Panel, the autopsy photos and autopsy X-rays show a bullet hole at the first thoracic vertebra. [...] The bullet hole in the shirt worn by Kennedy and the bullet hole in the suit jacket worn by Kennedy both show bullet holes between 5 and 6 in below the <b>top</b> of Kennedy's <b>collar.</b> These do not necessarily correspond with bullet wounds, since Kennedy was struck with his arm raised, and multiple photos taken of the President during the motorcade show that his jacket was bunched in the rear below his collar. In addition, on February 19, 2007, the film shot by George Jefferies was released. This 8 mm film, taken approximately 90 seconds before the shooting, also clearly shows that President Kennedy's suit coat was bunched up around the neckline {{around the time of}} the assassination.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{dressing}} process {{is among the}} five basic activities of daily life that define the degree of autonomy and independence of an individual. Self-sufficiency is historically recent as a status symbol, since {{only at the end}} of the nineteenth century royalty and wealthy people are no longer assisted during the {{dressing process}}. In the 1970 s, the focus in fashion is indisputably youth, leaving aside everyone with symptoms incompatible with this youthful and healthy stereotype. Thus, the dressing process becomes essential for the maintenance of autonomy and social sustainability of individuals with some functional limitation. In this paper, we present a kinesiological analysis of the movements performed during the dressing process and identify the main difficulties experienced by twenty-six musculoskeletal patients. The movements required to put on different garments and parts of garments – i. e., dresses, <b>tops,</b> coats, <b>collars,</b> sleeves – as well as to fasten them and the variation of the implicated movements with reference to their position were directly observed and recorded. Among the main results obtained, we verified that, for the sampled target population, it is more difficult to perform movements with bigger ROM and gross motor skills than those requiring fine motor skills; also that the change of position of fastenings can make the dressing process easier, since they help combining two stages of the process – i. e., adjustment and fastening. Among the possible conclusions, we infer that maintaining autonomy is essential for the social sustainability of individuals with musculoskeletal pathologies. In association, the inclusion of users in the development of design products using a UCD process is imperative to enhance the products suitability for the end-user and it is also a means of social inclusion...|$|R

My God knows whether or no I love my daughter; but I would sooner that she and I should both beg, than that she should live in comfort on money which is truly the property of the poor. It may seem strange to you, Sir Abraham, it is strange to myself, that I should have been ten years in that happy home, and not have thought of these things till they were so roughly dinned into my ears. I cannot boast of my conscience, when it required the violence of a public newspaper to awaken it; but, now that it is awake, I must obey it. When I came here, I did not know that the suit was withdrawn by Mr Bold, and my object was to beg you to abandon my defence. As there is no action, there can be no defence; but it is, at any rate, as well that you should know that from to-morrow I shall cease to be the warden of the hospital. My friends and I differ on this subject, Sir Abraham, and that adds much to my sorrow; but it cannot be helped." [...] And, as he finished what he had to say, he played up such a tune as never before had graced the chambers of any attorney-general. He was standing up, gallantly fronting Sir Abraham, and his right arm passed with bold and rapid sweeps before him, as though he were embracing some huge instrument, which allowed him to stand thus erect; and with the fingers of his left hand he stopped, with preternatural velocity, a multitude of strings, which ranged from the <b>top</b> of his <b>collar</b> {{to the bottom of the}} lappet of his coat. Sir Abraham listened and looked in wonder. As he had never before seen Mr Harding, the meaning of these wild gesticulations was lost upon him; but he perceived that the gentleman who had a few minutes since been so subdued as to be unable to speak without hesitation, was now impassioned,--nay, almost violent.|$|R
