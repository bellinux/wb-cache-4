5|$|The U.S. KAL007 Victims' Association, {{under the}} {{leadership}} of Hans Ephraimson-Abt, successfully lobbied U.S. Congress and the airline industry to accept an agreement that would ensure that future victims of airline incidents would be compensated quickly and fairly by increasing compensation and lowering <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> of airliner misconduct. This legislation has had far reaching effects for the victims of subsequent aircraft disasters.|$|E
5|$|The not-guilty verdict led to {{widespread}} dismay, and, as a result, the U.S. Congress {{and a number}} of states rewrote laws regarding the insanity defense. The old Model Penal Code test was replaced by a test that shifts <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> regarding a defendant's sanity from the prosecution to the defendant. Three states have abolished the defense altogether.|$|E

5|$|Writing for a {{majority}} of the Court, Justice Harry Blackmun held that natural parents have a right to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment, and that <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> used by New York State is not stringent enough to satisfy the constitutional requirements of the due process clause. In striking down New York's burden, the Court utilized the Mathews test to determine what burden of proof was due.|$|E
5|$|According to the Court of Appeal, <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> of {{justifying}} the lawfulness of the appellants' detention was, {{in the first}} instance, on the detaining authority. This burden of proof could be discharged by evidence that the President, acting in accordance with advice of the Cabinet or an authorized minister, was satisfied that the detention was necessary for national security purposes, and by {{the production of the}} detention order. Once the detaining authority had discharged the initial burden of proof, a burden of proof fell on the appellants to challenge their detention on GCHQ grounds.|$|E
5|$|Presumed Innocent premiered at the Fox Bruin Theater in Los Angeles, California on July 25, 1990, {{before being}} {{released}} in North America on July 27, 1990. The film has an approval rating of 86% at Rotten Tomatoes, with critics praising its directing, acting, and writing. It grossed $221 million worldwide, {{and became the}} eighth-highest-grossing film of 1990. The film {{was followed by a}} television miniseries titled <b>The</b> <b>Burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>Proof</b> in 1992 that takes place after the events of Presumed Innocent, and a television film sequel titled Innocent in 2011.|$|E

5|$|Presumed Innocent was {{followed}} by a two-part television miniseries, <b>The</b> <b>Burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>Proof</b> (1992). Based on Turow's 1990 novel, the miniseries focuses on defense attorney Sandy Stern (played by HÃ©ctor Elizondo), who investigates his wife's past following her apparent suicide. Presumed Innocent co-star Brian Dennehy appeared in a separate role as Stern's brother-in-law. Part one of the miniseries aired on the ABC network on February 9, 1992, with part two airing the following night on February 10.|$|E
5|$|Several legal {{developments}} {{occurred on}} the eve of the settlement. First, the First Circuit held in Bottomly v. Passamaquoddy Tribe (1979) that the Passamaquoddy were entitled to tribal sovereign immunity (see supra). Second, the Maine Supreme Judicial Court held in State v. Dana (1979) that the state had no jurisdiction to punish on-reservation arson because of the federal Major Crimes Act. Third, in Wilson v. Omaha Indian Tribe (1979), the U.S. Supreme Court held that the provision of the Nonintercourse Act placing <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> in land claims on non-Indians did not apply to U.S. state defendants (but did apply to corporate defendants); further, language in Wilson threatened to confine the applicability of the Act to Indian country. The tribes persuaded the U.S. Solicitor General to file a motion asking the Court to delete that language from its opinion. The Court denied the motion. Maine unsuccessfully sought certiorari in Dana on the basis of Wilson.|$|E
5|$|The federal jury convicted Cisneros of {{the murder}} on May 12 after three hours of deliberation. The {{prosecution}} introduced witnesses, including the motel manager and those at the crime scene, who stated that they saw a white car driven by the suspected assassins coming from Mexico {{the day before the}} shooting. The defense told the jurors that there was not enough evidence to uphold the conviction under federal requirements of reasonable doubt. The government concluded that it met <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> for interstate or foreign commerce charges in two ways: through Garza's phone calls from Mexico, and through the matching license plates of the Mexican car that crossed into the U.S. and registered at the motel, which matched the description of the vehicle seen at the murder scene. In order to find Cisneros guilty, they were not required to prove that she intended to use interstate or foreign commerce, or even that she knew it would be used. They were required to prove that someone involved in Fischer's murder used interstate or foreign commerce or caused another person to use it. On July 27, the jury rendered their final verdict and sentenced Cisneros to life in prison. Two years later, the United States Attorney Office recognized two local police officers and three FBI agents for assisting in her prosecution.|$|E

25|$|The {{party that}} does not carry <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> carries the benefit of {{assumption}} of being correct, they are presumed to be correct, until the burden shifts after presentation of evidence by the party bringing the action. An example is in an American criminal case, {{where there is a}} presumption of innocence by the defendant. Fulfilling <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> effectively captures the benefit of assumption, passing <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> off to another party.|$|E

2500|$|However, in England and Wales, the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980, s.101 {{stipulates}} that where a defendant relies on some [...] "exception, exemption, proviso, excuse or qualification" [...] in his defence, <b>the</b> legal <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> as to that exception {{falls on the}} defendant, though only on the balance of probabilities. For example, a person charged with being drunk {{in charge of a}} motor vehicle can raise the defence that there was no likelihood of his driving while drunk. The prosecution has <b>the</b> legal <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant exceeded the legal limit of alcohol and was in control of a motor vehicle. Possession of the keys is usually sufficient to prove control, even if the defendant is not in the vehicle and is perhaps in a nearby bar. That being proved, the defendant has <b>the</b> legal <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> on <b>the</b> balance of probabilities that he was not likely to drive.|$|R

The defense argued that the state could not prove that the shackles did no harm. Ultimately, the defense felt that the shackling of Deck was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, meaning shackling {{made a difference in}} the decision that the jury made. The defense argued that this alone was a violation against the constitution and due process.|$|E

5000|$|The {{satisfaction}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> evidential <b>burden</b> {{has sometimes}} been described as [...] "shifting <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> proof", a label which has been criticized because <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> placed on a defendant is not <b>the</b> legal <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> resting on <b>the</b> prosecution.|$|R
