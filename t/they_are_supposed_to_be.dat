Their initial sessions are very antagonistic, with Toyo complaining about Kobayashi's lack of English skills, and Kobayashi complaining about Toyo's pickiness about food. Eventually they become friendlier, but then Naru confesses her feelings to Kobayashi, though she knows he is gay. He gently rejects her, and despite Kobayashi's worries, Toyo does not get mad at him. Their friendship continues deepening, and Toyo realizes that Kobayashi is always watching him. After confirming with Naru that Kobayashi is gay, Toyo confronts him and Kobayashi confirms {{that he is in}} love with him. Due to an incident in his past, Toyo initially rejects his feelings, but one night during a storm Kobayashi is hurt protecting Toyo and they go back to Kobayashi's house to treat the wound. Toyo tells him about a man he was in love with, but rejected publicly out of fear of his friend's reactions and because the man was moving away. Toyo finally accepts Kobayashi's feelings. They initially keep their relationship secret from Naru, afraid of hurting her, but she quickly realizes what is going on. She yells at Kobayashi for lying because <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> friends, then tells him she is okay with their relationship.

[...] The propeller subsequently failed due to overstress, 1 to 2 seconds later. [...] When the propeller failed, the blades were hurled through the cabin, severing control cables as well as the structural integrity of the plane itself.

Such a change from ad-valorem to specific duties is in itself by no means objectionable; but it has usually been made a pretext on the part of protectionists for a considerable increase in the actual duties paid. When protectionists make a change of this kind, they almost invariably make the specific duties higher than the ad-valorem duties for which <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an equivalent...The Morrill tariff formed no exception to the usual course of things in this respect. The specific duties which it established were in many cases considerably above the ad-valorem duties of 1846.

2500|$|Albrecht Dürer {{considered}} printmaking {{to be one}} of {{the most}} important art forms, possibly even equal to the art of painting. His technical skill is well demonstrated in St. Michael Fighting the Dragon. The influence of Dürer's training under Michael Wolgemut on the quality of Dürer's works can be seen in the vast amount of detail in the print. Dürer includes details ranging from the small trees surrounding the town to details of St. Michael’s face. [...] Dürer uses atmospheric perspective to create the illusion of space by depicting the mountains with less detail the farther away <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> He creates different light and dark tones through his use of lines. In respect to the poses of the figures, especially Archangel Michael, Dürer broke with the traditional pose for a hero fighting against evil that was more elegant and instead put St. Michael in a pose that captures the magnitude of the task at hand. St. Michael’s eyebrows are furrowed with concentration and his hands are on the sword, about to fiercely attack the dragon. All original woodcuts in the series were made on pear wood.|$|E
