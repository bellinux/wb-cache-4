40|$|The {{zebrafish}} {{system is}} an excellent vertebrate genetic model to study hemostasis and thrombosis because saturation mutagenesis screens can identify novel genes that {{play a role in}} this vital physiologic pathway. To study hemostatic mutations, {{it is important to understand}} the physiology of zebrafish hemostasis and thrombosis. Previously, we identified zebrafish <b>thrombocytes</b> and have shown that they participate in arterial thrombus formation. Here, we recognized 2 populations of <b>thrombocytes</b> distinguishable by DiI-C 18 (DiI) staining. DiI+ <b>thrombocytes</b> have a high density of adhesive receptors and are functionally more active than DiI– <b>thrombocytes.</b> We classified DiI+ <b>thrombocytes</b> as young and DiI– <b>thrombocytes</b> as mature <b>thrombocytes.</b> We found young and mature <b>thrombocytes</b> each formed independent clusters and that young <b>thrombocytes</b> clustered first. We have also shown that young <b>thrombocytes</b> initiate arterial thrombus formation. We propose that due to the increased adhesive receptor density on young <b>thrombocytes,</b> they adhere first to the subendothelial matrix, get activated rapidly, release agonists, and recruit more young <b>thrombocytes,</b> which further release more agonists. This increase in agonists activates the less active mature <b>thrombocytes,</b> drawing them to the growing thrombus. Since arterial thrombus formation is a fundamental hemostatic event, this mechanism may be conserved in mammals and may open new avenues for prevention of arterial thrombosis...|$|R

We show that, ex vivo, <b>thrombocytes</b> from healthy carp express {{a large number of}} immune-relevant genes, among which several cytokines and Toll-like receptors, clearly pointing at immune functions of carp <b>thrombocytes.</b> Few studies have described the role of fish <b>thrombocytes</b> during infection. Carp are natural host to two different but related protozoan parasites, Trypanoplasma borreli and Trypanosoma carassii, which reside in the blood and tissue fluids. We used the two parasites to undertake controlled studies on the role of fish <b>thrombocytes</b> during these infections. In vivo, but only during infection with T. borreli, <b>thrombocytes</b> were massively depleted from the blood and spleen leading to severe thrombocytopenia. Ex vivo, addition of nitric oxide induced a clear and rapid apoptosis of <b>thrombocytes</b> from healthy carp, supporting a role for nitric oxide-mediated control of immune-relevant <b>thrombocytes</b> during infection with T. borreli. The potential advantage for parasites to selectively deplete the host of <b>thrombocytes</b> via nitric oxide-induced apoptosis is discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserve...|$|R
40|$|The {{functional}} relationship between fish and mammalian <b>thrombocytes</b> is relatively unknown. In this study, {{a panel of}} monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) was used to investigate the functional properties of rainbow trout <b>thrombocytes.</b> The mAbs recognize cell-surface molecules on <b>thrombocytes</b> with molecular weights ranging from 17 to 160 kDa. Flow cytometric and immuno-electron microscopic analyses demonstrate that these molecules are expressed at different levels and that surface expression increased upon activation with bovine collagen. Two of these cell-surface molecules (17 and 21 kDa) were directly involved in collagen-induced aggregation of <b>thrombocytes</b> since aggregation was, blocked upon pre-treatment with mAbs that recognize the two surface markers. Interestingly, the percentage of <b>thrombocytes</b> in blood increased after stimulation using different antigens. The transcriptional profile of trout <b>thrombocytes</b> was then examined after immuno-magnetic enrichment using the described mAbs to assess potential roles of trout <b>thrombocytes</b> in immune functions. Trout <b>thrombocytes</b> express components of the MHC class Ia pathway, IL 1 beta, TNFalpha, TGFbeta, the interleukin receptor common gamma chain as well as CXC and CC chemokines. MHC class IIB and TNFalpha were expressed at low levels in resting <b>thrombocytes.</b> No evidence was found {{for the expression of}} TCRalphabeta, Ig heavy chain, CD 8 alpha or CK 1 mRNA. Taken together, these results suggest that rainbow trout <b>thrombocytes</b> express molecules involved in activation, aggregation and genes encoding proteins, that are involved in antigen presentation and immune regulation.

The aim of our study is {{to examine the effects of}} <b>thrombocytes</b> on liver hypertrophy after portal vein embolization (PVE). Methodology: This retrospective cohort study comprised 75 patients with liver metastases from colorectal cancer subjected to PVE in preparation for major liver resection. Patients were divided into 2 groups depending On if chemotherapy was given within 6 weeks before PVE or not. Results: The chemotherapy group Showed-lower levels of <b>thrombocytes</b> (p= 0. 003) and lower degree Of hypertrophy (p= 0. 030) as Compared to the group without chemotherapy. No correlation within groups between level of <b>thrombocytes</b> and degree of hypertrophy was found. However, in the chemotherapy group, a positive linear correlation between the degree of hypertrophy and the difference in <b>thrombocytes</b> between the time points of PVE and 2 months preceding PVE was found (p= 0. 0006). Discussion: Preprocedural chemotherapy results in decreased hypertrophy of the liver after PVE and lower levels of <b>thrombocytes</b> at the time for PVE. The absolute number of <b>thrombocytes</b> does not influence liver regeneration after PVE.

In the present study, we demonstrate the active phagocytic ability of <b>thrombocytes</b> in lower vertebrates using teleost fishes and amphibian models. Ex vivo, common carp <b>thrombocytes</b> were able to ingest live bacteria as well as latex beads (0. 5 – 3 μm in diameter) and kill the bacteria.

Phagocytosis efficiency was further enhanced by serum opsonization. Particle internalization led to phagolysosome fusion and killing of internalized bacteria, pointing to a robust ability for microbe elimination. We find that this potent phagocytic activity is shared across teleost (Paralichthys olivaceus) and amphibian (Xenopus laevis) models examined, implying its conservation throughout the lower vertebrate lineage. Our results provide novel insights into the dual nature of <b>thrombocytes</b> in the immune and homeostatic response and further provide {{a deeper understanding of the}} potential immune function of mammalian platelets based on the conserved and vestigial functions...|$|R

After activation of wild type <b>thrombocytes</b> by B 16 F 10 melanoma cells there is a rapid increase in acid sphingomyelinase activity and ceramide production as compared to acid sphingomyelinase-deficient <b>thrombocytes</b> or P-selectin-deficient <b>thrombocytes.</b> A lack of interaction of B 16 F 10 melanoma cells and <b>thrombocytes</b> was excluded by activation of PLCγ, JNK and MAP kinase, indicating that these signaling events are stimulated in both, wild-type and P-selectin-deficient platelets, proving that B 16 F 10 melanoma cells interact with and activate P-selectin-deficient <b>thrombocytes.</b> The molecular mechanisms of tumor metastasis are currently fairly incomplete, though metastasis plays a crucial clinical role in cancer patients.

Specifically, we describe the ontology of erythro-thrombopoiesis during adult hematopoiesis with focus on the phylogenetic origin of mammalian erythrocytes and <b>thrombocytes</b> (also termed platelets). Although the evolutionary relationship between mammalian and nonmammalian erythroid cells is clear, the appearance of mammalian megakaryocytes is less so.

Based upon extensive studies in mammals, platelet cohesion resulting in the formation of the "hemostatic plug" is known to be mediated by the mammalian platelet glycoprotein IIb-IIIa complex in concert with fibrinogen and calcium. The immunological and biochemical technology already developed for the analyses of mammalian platelet glycoproteins has never been applied to avian <b>thrombocytes.</b> By indirect immunofluorescence, we now show that a polyclonal rabbit antibody specific for human glycoproteins IIb plus IIIa and the well-characterized murine monoclonal anti-IIb-IIIa complex antibody, AP 2, both crossreact with IIb and IIIa analogs on intact chicken <b>thrombocytes.</b> By two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, we also demonstrate that chicken <b>thrombocytes</b> will incorporate [35 S]methionine into several proteins, including the glycoprotein IIb and IIIa analogs during short-term (4 hr) incubation in vitro. This finding indicates that peripheral blood nucleated <b>thrombocytes</b> of the chicken, unlike their mammalian counterparts, retain the capacity to synthesize protein. The significance of these findings is 2 -fold. First, we provide biochemical and immunological evidence that those proteins responsible for platelet cohesion in humans are structurally conserved in cells of analogous function in chickens despite the fact that these species have diverged from a common ancestor more than 200 - 250 million years ago.
