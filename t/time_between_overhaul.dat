25|$|The 150 was {{succeeded in}} the summer of 1977 by the closely related Cessna 152. The 152 is more {{economical}} to operate due to the increased TBO (<b>time</b> <b>between</b> <b>overhaul)</b> of the Lycoming O-235 engine. The 152 had its flap travel limited to 30 degrees from the 150's 40 degree deflection for better climb with full flaps and the maximum certified gross weight was increased from 1,600lb (726kg) on the 150 to 1670lb (757kg) on the 152. Production of the 152 ended in 1985 when manufacturing of all Cessna piston singles was suspended.|$|E
25|$|The {{cockpit of}} the SH09 is {{designed}} to provide pilots with a generous field of view and simplify the act of operating the rotorcraft. A Sagem-built ICDS-8A glass cockpit suite is an integrated part of the SH09's standard avionics and instrumentation package. The rotorcraft has been designed with a condition-based maintenance policy, specifying {{that there should be no}} <b>time</b> <b>between</b> <b>overhaul</b> (TBO) limits on its various components and systems, including the engine; instead, maintenance is performed based upon condition, which is continuously monitored at all times by an onboard health and usage monitoring system (HUMS). Ease of maintenance and access to systems was an active consideration during the design phase, aiming to deliver lower overall maintenance costs.|$|E
500|$|With {{the end of}} the war, work on {{improving}} Merlin power output was halted and the development effort was concentrated on civil derivatives of the Merlin. Development of what became the [...] "Transport Merlin" [...] (TML) commenced with the Merlin 102 (the first Merlin to complete the new civil type-test requirements) and was aimed at improving reliability and service overhaul periods for airline operators using airliner and transport aircraft such as the Avro Lancastrian, Avro York (Merlin 500-series), Avro Tudor II & IV (Merlin 621), Tudor IVB & V (Merlin 623), TCA Canadair North Star (Merlin 724) and BOAC Argonaut (Merlin 724-IC). By 1951 <b>time</b> <b>between</b> <b>overhaul</b> (TBO) was typically 650â€“800 hours depending on use. By then single-stage engines had accumulated 2,615,000 engine hours in civil operation, and two-stage engines 1,169,000.|$|E
