50|$|In {{response}} to an offhand comment made by Dunlap during Episode 174 about setting up some kind of March Madness bracket in which the various sponsors of the podcast compete against each other, listener DJ Bowles created such a bracket featuring the following sponsors: Tee <b>Tee</b> <b>Slot,</b> Grace Sayers, Fox-Faced Cats, Wizardbeards, Longhorns Dancin Parlor, Dollar Cart, Hose Water, Pillsauce, Mr. Slaw, Snake Bells, Bug Spray, Pre-Greeters, 3 Sticks of Candy, I Go Heaven, Dom Podge Tax Wiz, Old Fish Fellow Inn, Dr. Birdman/Lady, Thickset Pants, Rooster Curtains, Snakehead 2s, Bag Cup or Handful, Old Books, Peanut Pockets, Kitty Pillows, Wet Breads, Cobbler Gobbler, Horse Gravy, The Glory Shelf, Skunkys, Farmboyâ€™er, Coleys Christian Cinema, and Jickies. Listeners and viewers were encouraged {{to vote in the}} bracket, which started in March 2016 and went on through April 2016, with elimination rounds taking place each week. Of course, as Jackie and Dunlap observed throughout the competition, Mr. Slaw was never technically a sponsor, but Jackie announced his intention in Episode 179 to pay for a sponsor slot for Mr. Slaw so {{that he would not be}} in the violation of any rules of the bracket. Mr. Slaw appeared in Episode 180, recorded on April 17, 2016, when it was also announced that he lost in the competition against Tee <b>Tee</b> <b>Slot</b> (although this information was kept from Mr. Slaw, who never really understood what the bracket was in the first place). As a result, the first ever sponsors of the podcast, Tee <b>Tee</b> <b>Slot</b> and Dr. Birdlady, faced off against each other, with Tee <b>Tee</b> <b>Slot</b> being announced the victor in Episode 181.|$|E
5000|$|Tee Tee Slott. Tee Tee Slott was {{originally}} a prostitute advertising her sexual {{services to the}} Murfreesboro community. However, she soon left prostitution and soon moved into childcare, setting up a mobile daycare in a van. When that failed, she moved into the beverage business, hiring other former prostitutes to produce such drinks as Slott Soda, Slott Water, and Slott Juice (which originally came in the following flavors: Grape, Apple, Grape-Apple, Pink, and Clear), as well as seasonal beverages such as Slott Cider and Slott Nog. She also branched out into the movie rental business with Slott Box (her version of Redbox) and a Halloween haunted house, filled with prostitutes in old dresses, called Tee Tee Slott's Horror House, which was later transformed into a brothel as Tee Tee had leased the old house past Halloween. Due to her position with the Murfreesboro Bottled Water Association, Tee <b>Tee</b> <b>Slot</b> was able to oust the mayor of Murfreesboro due to his dereliction of duty {{in the face of}} the ongoing McKinley-Sullivan feud (see below).|$|E
5000|$|Hosewater. Hosewater was a {{bottled water}} company {{started by the}} local McElroy family. Using the slogan [...] "One sip keeps it simple," [...] Hosewater offers water that has been run through a garden hose so as to bring back {{memories}} of youth and summertime, when children will often drink from the outdoor hose. After succeeding wildly with original Green Hose flavor, Hosewater branched out into Black Hose, Hosewater Light, and Energy Plus flavors. Once local beverage competitor Tee-Tee Slott began offering a new product, Slott Juice Hose, Hosewater retaliated by selling Hosejuice. After the patriarch of the McElroy family, Reo McElroy, was caught making online racist comments regarding the company his mistress was keeping, the Murfreesboro Bottled Water Association confiscated the McElroy family hose. However, shortly thereafter, Dom Podge returned from the Bundy Ranch standoff with the actual Bundy ranch hose, Reo McElroy began offering a new product, Freedom Water. He also founded his own bottled beverage association, the Murfreesboro Water Bottle Association. In the wake of Tee <b>Tee</b> <b>Slot</b> assuming mayoral power following the McKinley-Sullivan feud (see below), Reo McElroy has threatened to secede {{from the city and}} establish his own municipality of Hoseboro.|$|E
5000|$|Sullivan's Auto Parts and McKinley Air Conditioning. These two {{businesses}} {{sponsored the}} podcast beginning with Episode 88, a rare episode {{in which the}} sponsor segment lasted less than ten minutes. Everything seemed straightforward; however, Jackie's recollection that Sullivan and McKinley seemed to be friends, visiting his store together, awoke a longstanding grudge between Sullivan and McKinley, the origin of which lay in McKinley's discovery of {{a picture of his}} sister, Lynette, standing with a man who had his hand on her boob. McKinley insisted that the man in question was Sullivan due to an apparent scar visible in the picture, which Sullivan insisted was simply a fleck on the photograph. Making the issue particularly contentious was the fact that Lynette was married, though her husband was in a wheelchair and participated in sports for the disabled. Episodes subsequent to Episode 88 reveal a town coming apart at the seams as individuals align with either [...] "Team McKinley" [...] or [...] "Team Sullivan." [...] Sullivan even ran Jim Beavers with Comcast Cable (see above) off the road after catching sight of him servicing McKinley's house. The ongoing violence led to the mayor of Murfreesboro being ousted and replaced by Tee <b>Tee</b> <b>Slot</b> (see above).|$|E
