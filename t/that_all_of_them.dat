5|$|En {{route to}} Isabella, Clear {{and the other}} realize <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> are still alive due to the Flight 180 {{survivors}} having gotten off the plane. While driving to the hospital, {{they are involved in}} a car accident that leaves Eugene needing medical help and eventually leads to the deaths of Kat and Rory. Following their deaths, Clear, Kimberly and Thomas go to the hospital to save Isabella. While they do succeed in finding her in time and ensuring her infant survives, Kimberly has another premonition that reveals to her Isabella was never meant to die in the pileup, meaning they're still in danger. Understanding the situation, Clear tries to find Eugene's room. Finding him contained by an oxygenated room, she opens the door, subsequently loosening the plug of Eugene's defibrillator, creating a spark that incinerates Eugene's room, burning her and Eugene.|$|E

25|$|Formerly, other {{anonymous}} panegyrics of the Panegyrici Latini {{have been}} attributed to Eumenius, too. The most extreme position was that by Otto Seeck, who held <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> were by Eumenius. That view has been largely abandoned today, and Eumenius is regarded as the author of only Pro instaurandis scholis.|$|E
25|$|In Vergara, General Espartero and his {{constitutional}} troops were waiting. When the Castilian battalions and squadrons arrived, {{as well as}} the Biscayans and Guipuzcoans, Espartero gave a speech in which he gave them the option of continuing in the Queen's service or returning to their homes.

25|$|The NOCs {{are still}} allowed to select athletes {{using their own}} rules, on the {{condition}} <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> have made the qualifying time. For example, the United States selects athletes based on {{the result of the}} 2016 United States Olympic Trials event, but has a policy of entering every athlete so qualified. Sweden only enters athletes good enough to reach at least the eighth position, based on an assessment by the Swedish NOC.|$|E
25|$|The Viking runestones are runestones that mention Scandinavians {{who participated}} in Viking expeditions. This article treats the runestone that refer to people {{who took part in}} voyages abroad, in western Europe, and stones that mention men who were Viking warriors and/or died while {{travelling}} in the West. However, it is likely <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> do not mention men who took part in pillaging. The inscriptions were all engraved in Old Norse with the Younger Futhark.|$|E

It is likely <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> have been used, {{at one time}} or another, to decorate kurtas. However, the most common decoration is embroidery. Many light summer kurtas feature Chikan embroidery, a speciality of Lucknow, around the hems and front opening. This embroidery is typically executed on light, semi-transparent fabric in a matching thread. The effect is ornate but subtle.|$|E
25|$|None of the Cherokee in the North {{were present}} at the treaty. Later that month, Gen.

In response, Long Hair replied <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> would return south as soon as they finished the harvest. However, they did not all do so; at least one, called Shoe Boots (Dasigiyagi), stayed in the area until 1803, so it's likely others did as well.|$|E
25|$|Lanfranc {{accelerated}} {{the process of}} substituting Normans for Englishmen in all preferments of importance; and although his nominees were usually respectable, it cannot be said <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> were better than the men whom they superseded. For this admixture of secular with spiritual aims there was considerable excuse. By long tradition the primate was entitled to a leading position in the king’s councils; {{and the interests of}} the Church demanded that Lanfranc should use his power in a manner not displeasing to the king. On several occasions when William I was absent from England Lanfranc acted as his vicegerent.|$|E

25|$|But ASR is {{not limited}} to the {{intertidal}} environment. Most tropical and temperate fish species living in stagnant waters engage in ASR during hypoxia. One study looked at 26 species representing eight families of non-air breathing fishes from the North American great plains, and found that all but four of them performed ASR during hypoxia. Another study looked at 24 species of tropical fish common to the pet trade, from tetras to barbs to cichlids, and found <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> performed ASR. An unusual situation in which ASR is performed is during winter, in lakes covered by ice, at the interface between water and ice or near air bubbles trapped underneath the ice.|$|E
25|$|Fire and Darkness was {{developed}} by Singularity Software, an American studio composed of seven individuals. David Scherer, Adam Stubblefield and David Rosenthal started working on the game as early as 1996, with Mark Feghali helping them craft the networking engine featured in the game. Ari Heitner later joined the team, focusing on the game's user interface, sound code and scenario design. Ian Dale served as the main artist of the game, and Austin Huang provided the music. According to Scherer and Rosenthal, the game was done within three years, with the team mostly working in summer given <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> attended either high school or college. According to Next Generation magazine, no money was spent producing the game.|$|E
25|$|Turkish Air Force — Not entirely unlike Finland's Ilmavoimat air {{arm of the}} World War II years, the Turkish Air Force was {{the only}} air force, other than the Finns, who {{operated}} both Allied and Axis aircraft throughout World War II. Beginning in mid-1942, received 72 examples of the Fw 190 A-3a (export model of A-3, a stood for ausländisch—foreign) from Germany to modernize their air force. These aircraft were basically Fw 190 A-3s, with BMW 801 D-2 engines and FuG VIIa radios and an armament fit of four MG 17s, with the option of installing two MG-FF/M cannon in the outer wing positions. The export order was completed between October 1942 and March 1943. The Fw 190 remained in service {{until the end of}} 1947 after <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> had to be retired because of lack of spare parts.|$|E

500|$|Public {{reaction}} {{to the design of}} the building has been mixed. In the first 6 months of the building being open to the public, 250,000 people visited it, which Presiding Officer George Reid has said showed the public were [...] "voting with their feet". Critics of the building, such as Margo MacDonald MSP, have pointed out that the high number of visitors does not prove <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> like the building. As well as cost, criticisms of the building stem primarily from the modernist and abstract architecture, the quality of the building work and the location of the building.|$|E
500|$|Soon {{after he}} became the king in Ruhuna, Dutthagamani {{launched}} a campaign against Elara {{with the intention of}} [...] "restoring and glorifying Buddhism" [...] in the country. After setting out from Magama and crossing the Mahaweli river, Dutthagamani captured a number of forts and cities that were under Elara, and killed several of his generals. The ancient chronicles refer to all of the chieftains or generals defeated by Dutthagamani as Demalas (Tamils). However, it is unlikely <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> were indeed Tamils, and it is possible that one of themwhose name is given as Dighabayamay even have been a stepbrother of Dutthagamani himself who had later joined Elara.|$|E

Upon this he hesitated for some time about destroying them all with fire and sword, but at last leaping from his throne and running {{along the edge of the}} lake with his ridiculous tottering gait, he induced them to fight, partly by threats and partly by promises.
