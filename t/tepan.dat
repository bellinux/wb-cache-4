50|$|<b>Tepan</b> (تپان, also Romanized as <b>Tepān)</b> is {{a village}} in Zamkan Rural District, in the Central District of Salas-e Babajani County, Kermanshah Province, Iran. At the 2006 census, its {{population}} was 427, in 89 families.|$|E
5000|$|Wajxaklajun means [...] "eighteen" [...] in the Chuj language; {{this has}} been {{interpreted}} as deriving from the site originally consisting of eighteen mounds. This is a modern interpretation however, {{and it is possible}} that the name originally derived from a Maya calendrical name. A longer form of the name has been recorded as Chonjab <b>Tepan</b> Wajxaklajun; this translates as [...] "town and temple eighteen", from chonhap [...] "town", and <b>tepan</b> [...] "church". Alternative names for the site include Yolku (meaning [...] "in the sun") and El Calvario, sometimes contracted to Carvao, or Curvao. At the time of the Spanish conquest of Guatemala, Wajxaklajun was given the Nahuatl name Ystapalan (meaning [...] "place of salt"); this was later modified to Ystatlan ("abundance of salt" [...] in Nahuatl).|$|E
5000|$|The name [...] "Tepanecas" [...] is a {{derivative}} term, corresponding {{to their original}} mythical city, Tepanohuayan (the passing by), also known as Tepano. Ideographically is represented as a stone, as it's etymology comes from <b>Tepan</b> (over the stones). Their conquered territories received the name Tepanecapan (land of the tepanecas) (lit. [...] "over the tepanecas").|$|E
40|$|TREPAN is {{decision}} tree algorithm that utilises artificial neural networks (ANNs) {{in order to}} improve partitioning conditions when sample data is sparse. When sample sizes are limited during the tree-induction process, TREPAN relies on an ANN oracle in order to create artificial sample instances. The original TREPAN implementation was limited to ANNs that were designed to be classification models. In other words, TREPAN was incapable of building {{decision tree}}s from ANN models that were continuous in nature. Thus, the objective of this research was to modify the original implementation of TREPAN in order to develop and test decision trees derived from continuous-based ANN models. Though the modification were minor, they are significant because it provides researchers and practitioners an additional strategy to extract knowledge from a trained ANN regardless of its design. This research also explores how <b>TEPAN's</b> adjustable settings influence predictive performances based on a dataset's complexity and size. multi-class classification; decision trees; artificial neural networks; ANNs; TREPAN; C 4. 5; multilayer perceptron; MLP; generalised feed-forward; GFF; modular networks; genetic algorithms; techniques; strategies; continuous oracle; data analysis. ...|$|R
5000|$|Name is a {{derivation}} of {{the real}} people name, from their original mythic city, Tepanohuayan [...] "the pasadero", also called Tepano whose name is tepaneca (tl). Graphically it is represented by a stone, hence the etymology of <b>Tepan</b> is created [...] "on the stones". Tepanec conquered territories were called “Tepanecapan” (“tepanecas land", literally [...] "over the tepanecas").|$|E
40|$|Capturing CO 2 {{emissions}} {{generated from}} fossil fuel-based power plants has received widespread attention {{and is considered}} a vital course of action for CO 2 emission abatement. Efforts are underway at the Department of Energy’s National Energy Technology Laboratory to develop viable energy technologies enabling the CO 2 capture from large stationary point sources. Solid, immobilized amine sorbents (IAS) formulated by impregnation of liquid amines within porous substrates are reactive towards CO 2 and offer an alternative means for cyclic capture of CO 2 eliminating, to some degree, inadequacies related to chemical absorption by aqueous alkanolamine solutions. This paper describes synthesis, characterization, and CO 2 adsorption properties for IAS materials previously tested to bind and release CO 2 and water vapor in a closed loop life support system. Tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA), acrylonitrile-modified tetraethylenepentamine (<b>TEPAN),</b> and a single formulation consisting of <b>TEPAN</b> and N, N’-bis(2 -hydroxyethyl) ethylenediamine (BED) were individually supported on a poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) substrate and examined. CO 2 adsorption profiles leading to reversible CO 2 adsorption capacities were obtained using thermogravimetry. Under 10 % CO 2 in nitrogen at 25 °C and 1 atm, TEPA supported on PMMA over 60 minutes adsorbed ~ 3. 2 mmol/g{sorbent} whereas, <b>TEPAN</b> supported on PMMA along with <b>TEPAN</b> and BED supported on PMMA adsorbed ~ 1. 7 mmol/g{sorbent} and ~ 2. 3 mmol/g{sorbent} respectively. Cyclic experiments with a 1 : 1 weight ratio of <b>TEPAN</b> and BED supported on poly (methyl methacrylate) beads utilizing a fixed-bed flow system with 9 % CO 2, 3. 5 % O 2, nitrogen balance with trace gas constituents were studied. CO 2 adsorption capacity was ~ 3 mmols CO 2 /g{sorbent} at 40 °C and 1. 4 atm. No beneficial effect on IAS performance was found using a moisture-laden flue gas mixture. Tests with 750 ppmv NO in a humidified gas stream revealed negligible NO sorption onto the IAS. A high SO 2 concentration resulted in incremental loss in IAS performance and revealed progressive degrees of “staining” upon testing. Adsorption of SO 2 by the IAS necessitates upstream removal of SO 2 prior to CO 2 capture...|$|E
40|$|To {{face the}} {{worldwide}} threat of Surra caused by Trypanosoma evansi, international organizations have {{stressed the need}} to evaluate and standardize diagnostic tools. PCR detection of T. evansi has known a great expansion during the last 20 years, but primer sets are often insufficiently assessed and compared. In this work, we compared the performances of six primer pairs-TBR 1 / 2 (Masiga et al., 1992), ESAG 6 / 7 (Holland et al., 2001 a, b), <b>TEPAN</b> 1 / 2 (Panyim et al., 1993), pMUTEC F/R (Wuyts et al., 1994), TRYP 1 R/S (Desquesnes et al., 2001) and TRYP 4 R/S (Desquesnes et al., unpublished) -tested with purified T. evansi DNA serial dilutions, T. evansi-infected rat blood serial dilutions and Thai dairy cattle samples. TBR 1 / 2 primer set was able to detect 0. 01 pg of purified DNA, and a parasitaemia below one parasite per ml in rat blood. They presented the highest sensitivity in cattle samples {{as well as a}} high specificity, without non-specific products nor false positive reactions out of 84 negative cattle samples tested. ESAG 6 / 7 showed equivalent results with purified DNA and rat samples but presented non-specific products with Thai dairy cattle samples, leading to non interpretable results. <b>TEPAN</b> 1 / 2 was not able to detect less than 0. 1 pg of purified DNA or 50 trypanosomes/ml in rat blood. In cattle, <b>TEPAN</b> 1 / 2 primers detected only 36 % of the positives detected by TBR 1 / 2. Given the parasitemic level detected, pMUTEC F/R, TRYP 1 R/S and TRYP 4 R/S were not more sensitive than classical microscopic examination of the buffy coat. TBR 1 / 2, <b>TEPAN</b> 1 / 2, pMUTEC F/R and TRYP 4 R/S did not cross-reacted with Babesia sp., Trypanosoma theileri and Anaplasma marginale. TBR 1 / 2 was the most sensitive primer set to detect T. evansi in purified DNA, rodent blood and cattle blood, and did not show cross reaction with the other pathogens tested: it should be therefore preferred for epidemiological surveys. These results confirmed that TBR 1 / 2 primers remain the reference for the detection of Trypanozoon DNA and should therefore be included in subsequent evaluations of new diagnosis tools based on DNA detection.
