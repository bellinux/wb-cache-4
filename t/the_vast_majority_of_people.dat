5|$|Although {{romantic love}} was not discouraged, marriages were {{arranged}} as agreements and bonds formed between two clans (with property {{as the chief}} concern), not necessarily two individuals. A father's input on who his sons and daughters should marry carried more weight than the mother, although a grandfather could override a father's decision. Once a couple had married, the new wife was obligated to visit the family temple so she could {{become part of the}} husband's clan and be properly worshipped by her descendants after death. However, she retained her natal surname. <b>The</b> <b>vast</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> during Han practiced monogamy, although wealthy officials and nobles could afford to support one or many concubines in addition to their legal wife.|$|E
5|$|Smallpox {{vaccination}} {{within three}} days of exposure will prevent or significantly lessen the severity of smallpox symptoms in <b>the</b> <b>vast</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>people.</b> Vaccination four to seven days after exposure can offer some protection from disease or may modify the severity of disease. Other than vaccination, treatment of smallpox is primarily supportive, such as wound care and infection control, fluid therapy, and possible ventilator assistance. Flat and hemorrhagic types of smallpox are treated with the same therapies used to treat shock, such as fluid resuscitation. People with semi-confluent and confluent types of smallpox may have therapeutic issues similar to patients with extensive skin burns.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>vast</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> with aphthous {{stomatitis}} have minor {{symptoms and}} do not require any specific therapy. The pain is often tolerable with simple dietary modification during an episode of ulceration such as avoiding spicy and acidic foods and beverages. Many different topical and systemic medications have been proposed (see table), sometimes showing little or no evidence of usefulness when formally investigated. Some {{of the results of}} interventions for RAS may in truth represent a placebo effect. No therapy is curative, with treatment aiming to relieve pain, promote healing and reduce the frequency of episodes of ulceration.|$|E

5|$|Statutes {{passed in}} 1430 and 1432, {{during the reign}} of Henry VI, {{standardised}} property qualifications for county voters. Under these Acts, all owners of freehold property or land worth at least forty shillings in a particular county were entitled to vote in that county. This requirement, known as the forty shilling freehold, was never adjusted for inflation; thus the amount of land one had to own in order to vote gradually diminished over time. The franchise was restricted to males by custom rather than statute; on rare occasions women had been able to vote in parliamentary elections as a result of property ownership. Nevertheless, <b>the</b> <b>vast</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> were not entitled to vote; the size of the English county electorate in 1831 has been estimated at only 200,000. Furthermore, the sizes of the individual county constituencies varied significantly. The smallest counties, Rutland and Anglesey, had fewer than 1,000 voters each, while the largest county, Yorkshire, had more than 20,000. Those who owned property in multiple constituencies could vote multiple times; there was usually no need to live in a constituency in order to vote there.|$|E
5|$|Starting {{with the}} parish of Olney, Buckinghamshire in 1714 several dozen {{small towns and}} {{individual}} parishes established their own institutions without any specific legal authorization. These were concentrated in the South Midlands and in the county of Essex. From the late 1710s the Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge began to promote the idea of parochial workhouses. The Society published several pamphlets on the subject, and supported Sir Edward Knatchbull in his successful efforts to steer the Workhouse Test Act through parliament in 1723. The act gave legislative authority {{for the establishment of}} parochial workhouses, by both single parishes and as joint ventures between two or more parishes. More importantly, the Act helped to publicise the idea of establishing workhouses to a national audience. By 1776 some 1,912 parish and corporation workhouses had been established in England and Wales, housing almost 100,000 paupers. Perhaps one million people were receiving some kind of parish poor relief {{by the end of the}} century. Although many parishes and pamphlet writers expected to earn money from the labour of the poor in workhouses, <b>the</b> <b>vast</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> obliged to take up residence in workhouses were ill, elderly, or children whose labour proved largely unprofitable. The demands, needs and expectations of the poor also ensured that workhouses came to take on the character of general social policy institutions, combining the functions of creche, and night shelter, geriatric ward and orphanage. In 1782, Thomas Gilbert finally succeeded in passing an Act that established poor houses solely for the aged and infirm and introduced a system of outdoor relief for the able-bodied. This was the basis for the development of the Speenhamland system, which made financial provision for low-paid workers. Settlement Laws were altered by the Removal Act 1795 which prevented non-settled persons from being moved on unless they had applied for relief.|$|E
