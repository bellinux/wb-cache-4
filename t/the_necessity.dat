5|$|During the 1730s and 1740s, the Presbyterian Church {{was divided}} over {{the impact of}} the First Great Awakening.

5|$|In early 1811, Shelley and Hogg {{published}} <b>The</b> <b>Necessity</b> of Atheism, which outraged the Oxford authorities.

5|$|In {{the case}} of Burford I {{was one of the}} members who {{constituted}} the court. I owe it to my own consistency to declare that the court were then apprized of my objections to the issuing of the writ of habeas corpus. I did not then comment at large on the reasons which influenced my opinion, and the cause was this: The gentleman who argued that cause confined himself strictly to those considerations which ought alone to influence the decisions of this court. No popular observations on <b>the</b> <b>necessity</b> of protecting the citizen from executive oppression, no animated address calculated to enlist the passions or prejudices of an audience in defence of his motion, imposed on me <b>the</b> <b>necessity</b> of vindicating my opinion. I submitted in silent deference to the decision of my brethren.|$|E

5|$|Utmost {{necessity}} may {{be invoked}} where an interest {{protected by the}} Criminal Code (such as right to property or right to life) is endangered. An example of necessity would be a defense against a raging dog (unless the dog was directly sent by the owner, which would be case of necessary defense). <b>The</b> <b>necessity</b> may be invoked only in case of imminent danger and only {{if there is no}} other way of avoiding it (subsidiarity), such as locking oneself behind a fence or calling the police. Also, the consequence of <b>the</b> <b>necessity</b> must be less serious than the consequence of the endangering act (proportionality).|$|E

5|$|Antibodies are protein {{components}} of an {{adaptive immune system}} whose main function is to bind antigens, or foreign substances in the body, and target them for destruction. Antibodies can be secreted into the extracellular environment or anchored in the membranes of specialized B cells known as plasma cells. Whereas enzymes are limited in their binding affinity for their substrates by <b>the</b> <b>necessity</b> of conducting their reaction, antibodies have no such constraints. An antibody's binding affinity to its target is extraordinarily high.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, Havelock {{moved away}} from the socialist organisations he had been {{associated}} with, and in 1944 was elected founding president of the Ontario Classical Association. One of the association's first activities was organising a relief effort for Greece, which had just been liberated from Nazi control. Havelock continued to write about politics, however, and his political and academic work came together in his ideas about education; he argued for <b>the</b> <b>necessity</b> of an understanding of rhetoric for the resistance to corporate persuasiveness.|$|E

I again earnestly urge upon men of all classes in our city <b>the</b> <b>necessity</b> of sober, careful thought and the criminal folly of any precipitate action.|$|E

5|$|In 1398 Richard summoned {{a packed}} Parliament to Shrewsbury—known as the Parliament of Shrewsbury—which {{declared}} all {{the acts of}} the Merciless Parliament to be null and void, and announced that no restraint could legally {{be put on the}} king. It delegated all parliamentary power to a committee of twelve lords and six commoners chosen from the king's friends, making Richard an absolute ruler unbound by <b>the</b> <b>necessity</b> of gathering a Parliament again.|$|E
5|$|In 1785, a {{proposal}} {{for the creation of}} a General Assembly went before the Synod, yet the convening of one was delayed due to <b>the</b> <b>necessity</b> of having to write a constitution, a constitution which officers could not initially agree upon. In 1788, the Synod adopted a constitution modeled on the Church of Scotland in which power was centralized in the General Assembly. The constitution also included provisions of the Church of Scotland's Barrier Act of 1697, which required the General Assembly to receive the approval of a majority of presbyteries before making major changes to the church's constitution and doctrine.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, in 1902, Scott, {{a native}} commissioner, brought to Clarke's {{attention}} that many work-seekers were suffering great privation yet {{were unable to}} find work while some businesses were short of labour. Clarke took up the cause: 'This indicates <b>the</b> <b>necessity</b> of the organisation of an Association for bringing those wanting labour and those seeking employment into contact and prevent, what I have myself seen, gangs of destitute natives wandering about the country.' In 1903, a Rhodesian Native Labour Bureau was proposed.|$|E

5|$|Leclerc heeded {{the advice}} {{he was given}} by United States General of the Army Douglas MacArthur to bring as many {{soldiers}} as possible. He broke the Vietminh blockade around Saigon, then drove through the Mekong delta and up into the highlands. This was possible because Ho feared Chinese domination far more than French colonialism, which he perceived to be in decline. Ho's first priority was {{getting rid of the}} Chinese, and for this he needed French help. Leclerc quickly perceived <b>the</b> <b>necessity</b> for a political solution to the conflict.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, President Bartlet {{tries to}} persuade Ellie {{to speak to}} the press to contain the incidence, but Ellie insists she is not as {{comfortable}} with the spotlight as {{the other members of the}} family.

5|$|The 1973 war {{convinced}} the Israelis of <b>the</b> <b>necessity</b> of {{negotiations with the}} Arabs. This unprecedented willingness, coupled with Sadat's diplomatic initiatives and intercession by the United States to break barriers of mistrust between Egypt and Israel, made possible the long series of discussions between both nations. The negotiations ultimately resulted in the 1978 Camp David Agreements, and the peace treaty between Egypt and Israel in 1979. Thus, without resorting to another major war, Sadat {{had been able to}} regain the Sinai through diplomatic means.|$|E
