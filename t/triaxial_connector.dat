40|$|Microfission {{chambers}} (MFCs) will {{measure the}} total neutron source strength in ITER. The MFCs will be installed behind blanket modules in the vacuum vessel (VV). Triaxial mineral insulated (MI) cables will carry {{signals from the}} MFCs. The joint connecting triaxial MI cables in the VV must be considered because the MFCs and the MI cables will be installed separately at different times. Vacuum tight <b>triaxial</b> <b>connector</b> of the MI cable has been designed and a prototype has been constructed. Performance tests indicate that the connector {{can be applied to}} the ITER environment. A small bending-radius test of the MI cable indicates no observed damage at a curvature radius of 100 mm...|$|E

50|$|Triaxial (also {{known as}} triax) {{connectors}} are a variant on BNC that carry a signal and guard {{as well as}} ground conductor. These are used in sensitive electronic measurement systems. Early <b>triaxial</b> <b>connectors</b> were designed with just an extra inner conductor, but later <b>triaxial</b> <b>connectors</b> also include a three-lug arrangement to rule out an accidental forced mating with a BNC connector. Adaptors exist to allow some interconnection possibilities between <b>triaxial</b> and BNC <b>connectors.</b> The <b>triaxial</b> may also {{be known as a}} Trompeter connection.|$|R
50|$|MIL-PRF-49142 (formerly MIL-C-49142) is a {{performance}} specification describing the general {{requirements and tests}} for RF, <b>triaxial,</b> <b>connectors.</b> These connectors and fittings are intended for use with biaxial cable {{and can be used}} for RF applications when more shielding is required, and they can also be used for serial digital transfer.|$|R

40|$|The Custom J 1 Backplane is a {{full length}} (21 slot) user {{specified}} custom 3 U backplane {{to be used in}} the J 1 position. Slot spacing is identical to that used for VME (0. 8 -inch), and each backplane shall fit into a standard Eurocard VME style crate. The purpose of the Custom J 1 Backplane is to: (1) Provide + 5 volt power to slots 1 through 21; (2) Provide - 5. 2 volt power to slots 1 through 21; (3) Provide five bits of geographic addressing to slots 2 through 21. Slot 2 will have all five bits pulled low; slot 21 will have the value 10100. See Appendix A; (4) Route a differential 1553 signal from a <b>triaxial</b> bulkhead <b>connector</b> to slots 2 through 11. This differential signal is bussed as a daisy chain. A 75 ohm resistor to ground shall be located near the last destination slot for each of these two signals; (5) Route a second differential 1553 signal from a <b>triaxial</b> bulkhead <b>connector</b> to slots 12 through 21. This differential signal is bussed as a daisy chain. A 75 ohm resistor to ground shall be located near the last destination slot for each of these two signals; (6) Route two NRZ signals and two Clock signals from slot 1 to each of slots 2 through 21. These are individual signals, not bussed...|$|R
