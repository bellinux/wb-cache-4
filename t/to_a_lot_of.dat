25|$|The Austrians went <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> {{trouble to}} conceal the {{strength}} of Davidovich's corps from their enemies. The ruse was so successful that Bonaparte ordered Vaubois to advance and defeat his opponent {{so that he could}} shift 3,000 troops to help fight Alvinczi. On 2 November, Vaubois attacked Davidovich near Cembra, inflicting 1,116 casualties before retiring. Though the French suffered only 650 killed and wounded, this included 280 soldiers of the 85th Line Infantry Demi Brigade. This loss seems to have seriously damaged the unit's morale. The next day, Vaubois pulled back to Calliano.|$|E

25|$|The {{majority}} of the events are categorized as seemingly peaceful by many students, stating that they consist mainly of students standing around, chanting and singing.

Nevertheless, each event is met with police interference due to a fear of the unsafe environments that large unattended crowds could create. In the past there has been friction between members of the student body and the UMass Police Department around their methods of crowd control; students have been displeased with what they see as unnecessary force.|$|E

25|$|Statement {{measures}} tend {{to comprise}} more words, and hence consume more research instrument space, than lexical measures. Respondents are asked {{the extent to}} which they, for example, Talk <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> different people at parties or Often feel uncomfortable around others. While some statement-based measures of extraversion/introversion have similarly acceptable psychometric properties in North American populations to lexical measures, their generally emic development makes them less suited to use in other populations. For example, statements asking about talkativeness in parties are hard to answer meaningfully by those who do not attend parties, as Americans are assumed to do. Moreover, the sometimes colloquial North American language of statements makes them less suited to use outside America. For instance, statements like Keep in the background and Know how to captivate people are sometimes hard for non-native English-speakers to understand except in a literal sense.|$|E
25|$|Much of {{the serial}} was filmed on {{location}} in Aldbourne, Wiltshire. The location shoot was awarded two weeks' filming, {{more than double the}} usual amount at the time, leading <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> the finished story being set outside, rather than in studio. Membury airfield in Berkshire and Bridge Farm, Ramsbury, were also used briefly as locations. Filming began on 19 April 1971 and saw pleasant, sunny weather for the first week, leading to sudden overnight snow in the second week - causing filming to be delayed. Some episode one scenes were filmed at night - a rarity for the show, although some of these scenes were filmed during daylight with a dark filter put over the camera lens. Other dark indoor scenes were filmed in a disused aircraft hangar at Bridge Farm, Ramsbury. Filming for the serial caused great excitement in Aldbourne, {{with a lot of the}} village residents appearing as extras, as well as the Headington Quarry Morris dancers performing a routine in episode four.|$|E
25|$|I {{had watched}} Ken Barrington – a great Test batsman – {{as a boy}} and when I broke into the England side in the late Seventies he became a father figure. In fact, he was a mentor <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> us then – myself, David Gower, Ian Botham, Mike Gatting. Ken was an England {{selector}} and assistant manager on the West Indies tour of 1981. There were no official coach in those days but it was to Ken {{that most of us}} turned. Unlike many retired pros, he never used the words, 'In my day...' On the first night of the Test, he suffered a heart attack in our hotel. I was woken the next morning at around 8am by tour manager Alan Smith and captain Ian Botham. I knew something was wrong, because Both was never up before then. They told me the news. I had tears in my eyes when we went out on to the pitch for the minute's silence and again when I was batting in the second innings. We needed over 500 to win and it soon became apparent that we weren't going to get them. But I kept thinking of him and managed to make a hundred. Kenny was a counsellor, a friend and an inspiration.|$|E

25|$|Mariano's first {{experience}} with art was at fours years old with his cousin, teaching him how to draw simple shapes. He and his brother, Jonathan Ching who would also grow up to become an artist, would spend their time to draw instead of playing outside. He was greatly influenced by the anime Mazinger Z and Voltes V which was widely popular during his youth. They would significantly affect his future works. Reaching his high school years, his parents reminded him to think carefully about his life career. They {{said there is no}} money in art and should consider medicine or engineering as career and to make art as a hobby. But despite his parents' constant reminder, Mariano still pursued the road of becoming an artist. He enrolled <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> art workshops to hone his skills. One of the workshops that he attended became the turn point of his life. At the art workshop which is headed by Elemer Borogan and Gina Morales, the art style of the paintings has touched him and made him to decide to switch from his fourth year engineering major to painting major in University of the Philippines. During his years in University of the Philippines, he co-founded the art group Surrounded by Water. There, he found his future wife, Yasmin Sison which {{is also a member of}} Surrounded by Water. Mariano Ching, at that time, was still new at the art scene and he has not garnered any recognition yet.|$|E
