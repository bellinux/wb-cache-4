25|$|Livestock {{production}} {{is by far}} the biggest cause of land use, as it accounts for 30% of the global land surface. It is probably the leading player in biodiversity loss, as it causes deforestation, land degradation, pollution, climate change, overfishing, and invasions by alien species. Livestock is also responsible for at least 20% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, which are the main cause of the current climate change. This is due to feed production, enteric fermentation from ruminants, manure storage and processing, and transportation of animal products. The greenhouse gas emissions from livestock production greatly exceeds the greenhouse gas emissions of any other human activity. Some authors argue that by far <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> can do to slow climate change is a global shift towards a vegetarian or vegan diet.|$|E
500|$|With the {{publication}} of A Manual of North American Birds in 1887, Robert Ridgway condensed what was known about the continent's birds into a relatively compact 642 pages and 464 outline drawings. [...] A prototype of today's field guides, it was quite successful, going into a second edition in 1896, and was described by Montague Chamberlain as [...] "far away <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> have for the working naturalist." [...] Nevertheless, its bulk was unwieldy {{for use in the}} field, and its identification keys depended on characteristics of the bird in the hand, not field marks. [...] Harry Oberholser characterized the quality of the illustrations as [...] "rarely equaled, never excelled" [...] in beauty and accuracy.|$|E
500|$|Recording {{completed}} in March 1999 and all parties involved were enormously {{proud of the}} record. [...] "When it was done, we were so stoked. It was like a masterpiece for our band," [...] remembered DeLonge. [...] "We knew {{this was going to}} be <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> ever did." [...] Hoppus felt the band achieved the purest, cleanest sound on the record that they had been striving for. Finn felt similarly, proud of his work on the record and believing in retrospect that the album would appeal to the masses. As the album was recorded on analog tape, the trio put enormous trust into Finn to give the record the polished pop sound they wanted, recalled DeLonge in 2012. [...] "The Party Song" [...] was the final song to be completed, and the three were mixing the song coincidentally when lead single [...] "What's My Age Again?" [...] premiered on Los Angeles-based radio station KROQ. Roger Joseph Manning, Jr., best known for his work with Beck, played keyboards for several songs on the album. After production completed, the album was mastered by Brian Gardner at Bernie Grundman Mastering in Hollywood. In 2013, Hoppus referred to Enema of the State as [...] "the heart of Blink-182's musical sensibilities," [...] singling out [...] "its simplicity, its purity, its singularity of purpose between the three of us." [...] According to Barker, the album's title stemmed from DeLonge, who was worried about his diet at the time and using enemas.|$|E
6000|$|There {{was another}} long pause; for <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> each {{say to the}} other are said in the pauses. Then Frida relapsed once more into speech: [...] "But what about the children?" [...] she asked rather timidly.|$|R
5000|$|His {{work was}} greatly praised by the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein who {{recommended}} him to Bertrand Russell as {{really a great}} poet and his poems are among <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> have...the beauty of Mörike's work is very closely related to Goethe's.|$|R
5000|$|Plato further {{described}} Divine Madness {{as a gift}} of god, with Socrates stating in Phaedrus, [...] "in fact <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> have {{comes from}} madness", and expounds upon the concept in Plato's Ion. In eastern cultures, it has been deployed as a catalyst and means for the deeper understanding of spiritual concepts.|$|R
2500|$|In a New Scientist {{interview}} {{published on}} 21 January 2015, Wilson said that [...] "Religion 'is dragging us down' {{and must be}} eliminated '{{for the sake of}} human progress, and [...] "So I would say that for the sake of human progress, <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> could possibly do would be to diminish, to the point of eliminating, religious faiths." ...|$|E
2500|$|Other writers {{including}} Maj Edward Palm, who {{was once}} a CAP Marine, thought otherwise. [...] "I would like to believe, with some, that combined action was <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> did.....In my experience, combined action was merely one more untenable article of faith. The truth, I suspect, is that where it seemed to work, combined action wasn't really needed, and where it was, combined action could never work. [...] ".|$|E
2500|$|..... {{for many}} years, the revenue derived was so trifling, {{compared}} with the great outlay of capital, that the shareholders almost despaired of its ever proving a profitable investment. It is said that in 1805, when {{the annual meeting of}} shareholders took place, presided over by Mr Colt of Gartsherrie, at the conclusion, murmurs of dissatisfaction prevailed among the members at the very cheerless report. Many propositions were made, and, after discussion, abandoned. At last a question was put to the chairman as to what he thought should be done; he replied, [...] "Conscience, lads! <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> can dae, is for ilka ane o' us to fill up the sheugh on his ain lands and let it staun." ...|$|E

2500|$|Socrates {{begins by}} {{discussing}} madness. If madness is all bad, then the preceding speeches {{would have been}} correct, but in actuality, madness given as a gift of the gods provides us with some of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> have. There are, in fact, several kinds of divine madness (theia mania), of which he cites four examples: ...|$|R
5000|$|Though no proper series finale was created, {{the concept}} of Wildboyz was {{somewhat}} revisited during Jackass Number Two, which was filmed after Wildboyz had ended. Jackass 2.5, director Jeff Tremaine says, [...] "We shot {{some of the most}} amazing stuff Wildboyz we've ever made. And so one of the ideas with Number Two was to recreate some of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> ever shot for Wildboyz. Unfortunately, it didn't always work out." ...|$|R

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Sound of Boston, Sam revealed that the sample {{at the beginning of}} [...] "Texas" [...] was discovered while digging for records; it was [...] "one of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> ever found in those record bins." [...] The band [...] "worked with a bunch of different producers and had a really good connection with Alex Aldi", who helped craft the album and track listing in the studio. The drummer, Joey Sulkowski, and bassist, Gabe Goodman of Magic Man at the time did not record (their parts are performed by Larry Gorman and Daniel Radin, respectively).|$|R
60|$|I was {{a little}} put to it for a mast for her, having not {{anything}} on board we could spare that was fit for a main-mast; but resolving at last to mast her not as a sloop, but as a brigantine, we made shift with what pieces we had, and a spare foretop-mast, {{which one of the}} Dutch ships helped me to; so we fitted her up very handsomely, made her carry twelve guns, and put sixty men on board. One of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> found on board her, were casks, which we greatly wanted, especially for barrelling up beef and other provisions, which we found very difficult; but our cooper eked them out with making some new ones out of her old ones.|$|R

5000|$|The 1991 Cappagh killings {{took place}} on 3 March, when a unit from the Mid-Ulster Brigade went {{to the village of}} Cappagh, County Tyrone, intent on killing an entire Provisional IRA unit based in the village. Taking up a {{position}} outside Boyle's Bar, the gunmen waited for a car to pull up containing republicans and opened fire on them as they exited the vehicle. The UVF men succeeded in killing IRA volunteers John Quinn, Dwayne O'Donnell and Malcolm Nugent before entering the bar and opening fire. One more man, Thomas Armstrong, was killed in the pub but he was {{not a member of the}} IRA, while their intended target, Brian Arthurs, survived by crouching behind the bar. A member of the Mid-Ulster Brigade staff would later claim that the Cappagh attack was [...] "one of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> did militarily in thirty years" [...] as it proved they could strike directly at the Provisional IRA in an area which was a republican stronghold. Because of the lack of a security force presence in an area where it was usually heavy, republicans and journalist Peter Taylor have alleged security force collusion in the killings, with Taylor suggesting the UDR.|$|R
