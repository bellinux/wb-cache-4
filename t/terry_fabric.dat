In this study, before shipping of two different <b>terry</b> <b>fabric</b> orders, defects were detected by inspection of fabric rolls on a lighted control board by experienced experts. Number of the defects and dimensions of the defects seen during the inspection were noted on quality control charts. Detected defects were defined and scored according to different demerit point systems. In this way, the fabric rolls were classified according to the demerit point systems before being shipped to garment enterprises. Disputes can be avoided with classification made by a demerit point system on which manufacturer and the customer have agreed. </span...|$|E

Extremely large <b>terry</b> <b>fabric</b> range is designed for bath and sauna products, home textiles, baby products. The main reasons for determining terry fabrics popularity of the products mentioned are their properties: the absorption of moisture, drying speed, air permeability, a fibre composition. To design terry fabrics {{must take into account}} many parameters, which are determined by the fibre composition, structure parameters, the final finish. For this reason, it has done a lot of research to be able to predict the behavior of designed fabrics. A completely new theme terry fabrics cover microcapsules filled with essential oils. Essential oils - is concentrated essences derived from various plant parts. It's subtle, very complex structure material with specific scent and healing properties. So combining terry fabrics with good absorption properties and essential oils with healing properties, we obtained by the perfect combination. The final work researched microcapsules containing essential oils (lavender and eucalyptus) and terry fabrics with microcapsules. Defined <b>terry</b> <b>fabric</b> weft density and air permeability varying binder concentration. There was also defined weft density and surface density by varying the concentration of the binder containing. It was found that different weft density by applying a different amount of binder change phycical properties of terry fabric: air permeability and surface density...|$|E
40|$|Terry fabrics {{are very}} popular {{materials}} {{which may be}} used for home textile, of baby clothes {{and as a result of}} the large scale of production of medicine and hygiene products. The structure of the <b>terry</b> <b>fabric</b> is characterized by its complex weave which is obtained through interlacing two systems of warp and one system of weft. The loop pile is one of the most important elements of the terry woven fabric structure because the appearance of the product and many other properties depend on the loops formed on the surface of terry fabrics. Water absorption is important for terry fabrics as well. Consequently, in this study, water vapour absorption and water evaporation from terry fabrics are investigated. Other extremely important physical properties of terry woven fabrics are their permeability properties. Absorption and desorption properties of woven fabrics depend on their air permeability. Mechanical properties of terry fabrics are among the most important characteristics determining the service capability of the product; the strength properties of the products are influenced by the fabric strength and durability. <b>Terry</b> <b>fabric</b> finishing methods are being developed seeking not only to improve the fabric’s appearance or to provide it with additional functional properties but also in order to increase the demand for terry woven fabrics. The assessment of <b>terry</b> <b>fabric</b> wear was determined investigating the changes in mechanical properties after abrasion impact. The analysis also includes the predicting of the quality of terry fabrics: the dependencies of indices are expressed by mathematical equations and evaluated as complex; the determination of the influence of water, heat, mechanical, and chemical impacts/finishing on the properties of the fabrics is performed...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this work is to study the various moisture absorption characteristics of <b>terry</b> towel <b>fabrics</b> based on 100 % cotton fibres available in the market. Five types of cotton <b>terry</b> <b>fabrics</b> were purchased and studied their water absorption, absorption time, absorption rate (static absorption), dynamic, and vertical wicking. The {{results showed that the}} moisture absorption related behaviour of the <b>terry</b> towel <b>fabrics</b> were based on their fabric weight, thickness and pile yarn twist.

5000|$|French <b>Terry</b> is a <b>fabric,</b> used in men's, women's and children's clothes. One of {{its sides}} is flat, {{while the other}} side is with cross loops.

40|$|A {{study on}} <b>Terry</b> woven <b>Fabrics?</b> Dimensional {{stability}} and Areal Density during Wet processing,is a published article of the textile technology department. Experimental work on three fabrics, made from 100 % cotton, with different pile ratios and yarn densities was conducted during wet processing. Areal density, dimensional stability, yarn crimp and yarn densities were investigated at three {{different stages of}} wet processing namely greige state, bleached state and dyed state. Results showed an increase in dimensional contractions as pile ratio was increased. Fabric dimensions were measured after each processing stage, and the widthwise contractions were between 2. 4 % and 7. 9 % for all the fabrics whereas the lengthwise contractions were between 9. 7 % and 14. 6 %. Areal density was determined using two methods thus by manual measurement and also by calculation. The measure and calculated result both showed that the areal density for each fabrics increased during all stages of wet processing. Generally warp crimp was higher than weft crimp for all the three fabrics, at all three stages of fabric ion. Weft crimp was between 2 % and 7 % whereas warp crimp was between 6 % and 14 %. The measured and calculated results were compared and analyzed using regression analysis methods, and {{it was found that}} there was a correlation between the measured and the calculated results. It was concluded that wet processes {{have a significant effect on}} dimensional stability and areal density. Also it was concluded that the effect of wet processing is dependent on the fabric construction parameters which include the pile ratio and yarn density...|$|R
