5|$|Although {{its origins}} are obscure, {{the site of}} the present ancient church has been used for Christian worship since it was settled in the early sixth century, {{probably}} by Saint Padarn, after whom it was named.

5|$|His {{antiquarian}} studies led Planché to take {{an interest}} in heraldry. He had published several papers on heraldic topics in the Journal of the British Archaeological Association before publishing in 1852 The Pursuivant of Arms, or, Heraldry founded upon facts. As indicated by the subtitle, Planché was concerned with verifiable facts, as opposed to the unfounded theories perpetuated by many earlier heraldic writers. In the view of eminent herald Sir Anthony Wagner, Planché rewrote <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>history</b> of heraldry.|$|E
5|$|Many of the regnal {{dates of}} the East Anglian kings are {{considered}} unreliable, often being based upon computations.

The main source of information about <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>history</b> of the kingdom's rulers is Bede's Ecclesiastical History of the English People.|$|E

5|$|The 4:1 orbital {{resonance}} with Jupiter, at a radius 2.06AU, can {{be considered}} the inner boundary of the asteroid belt.

The Hungaria asteroids lie closer to the Sun than the 4:1 resonance, but are protected from disruption by their high inclination.|$|E
