500|$|In the song, Jackson {{tells the}} media to stop {{pressuring}} him and to stop misrepresenting the truth. Jon Pareles of The New York Times observed, [...] "fear has turned to aggression. The music has polarized; it's either clipped, choppy and electronic or glossy and sumptuous, only occasionally trying to combine the two. Most of the time, Jackson sounds as if he's singing <b>through</b> <b>clenched</b> teeth, spitting out words in defiance of any and all persecutors". He believed that [...] "Scream" [...] had a similar sound {{to the music of}} Janet's acclaimed Rhythm Nation. It was Michael Jackson's first song that contained the word [...] "fucking" [...] in the lyrics [...] "Stop pressuring me/Stop pressuring me/Stop fucking with me"—which was thought of as an unusual choice for Jackson, considering his appeal with the younger audience. Other songs on HIStory contained words such as kike, shit, and from The Notorious B.I.G., the word [...] "nigga". [...] "Scream" [...] incorporates elements of pop, R, hip-hop, funk and rock.|$|E
500|$|A {{distinctive}} deliberate mispronunciation of [...] "come on", used frequently by Jackson, occasionally spelled [...] "c'mon", [...] "cha'mone", or [...] "shamone", is also {{a staple}} in impressions and caricatures of him. The turn of the 1990s saw {{the release of the}} introspective album Dangerous. The New York Times noted that on some tracks, [...] "he gulps for breath, his voice quivers with anxiety or drops to a desperate whisper, hissing <b>through</b> <b>clenched</b> teeth" [...] and he had a [...] "wretched tone". When singing of brotherhood or self-esteem the musician would return to [...] "smooth" [...] vocals. Of Invincible, Rolling Stone was of the opinion that, at age 43, Jackson still performed [...] "exquisitely voiced rhythm tracks and vibrating vocal harmonies". Nelson George wrote: [...] "The grace, the aggression, the growling, the natural boyishness, the falsetto, the smoothness—that combination of elements mark him as a major vocalist". Cultural critic Joseph Vogel notes that Jackson had a [...] "distinctive styles is his ability to convey emotion without the use of language: there are his trademark gulps, grunts, gasps, cries, exclamations; he also frequently scats or twists and contorts words until they are barely discernible." [...] Neil McCormick notes that Jackson's unorthodox singing style [...] "was original and utterly distinctive, from his almost ethereal falsetto to his soft, sweet mid-tones; his fluid, seamless control of often very fast moving series of notes; his percussive yet still melodic outbursts, ululations and interjections (from those spooky [...] "tee-hee-hees" [...] to grunts and wails). Unusually for someone coming from a black American soul tradition, he did not often sing straight, unadorned ballads, though when he did (from 'Ben' to 'She's Out of My Life') the effect was of a powerful simplicity and truth." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am going}} to cling to mine to the end, Antonia," [...] he answered, <b>through</b> <b>clenched</b> teeth, then bowed very low, a little distantly.|$|E

60|$|The chained prisoners {{had been}} {{watching}} the combat in tense silence; not a sound had fallen in the room other than the clashing of our contending blades, the soft shuffling of our naked feet and the few whispered words we had hissed at each other <b>through</b> <b>clenched</b> teeth the while we continued our mortal duel.|$|E
60|$|The {{result was}} a little unexpected. The man gave a start that was almost a leap, and the pallor of his face became a sickly white. His eyes, as he swung round, met Mr Birdsey's for an instant before they dropped, and there was panic fear in them. His breath whistled softly <b>through</b> <b>clenched</b> teeth.|$|E

6000|$|He waited. Before {{his eyes}} the engines turned with slow labour, {{that in the}} moment of going off into a mad fling would stop dead at Mr. Rout's shout, [...] "Look out, Beale!" [...] They paused in an {{intelligent}} immobility, stilled in mid-stroke, a heavy crank arrested on the cant, as if conscious of danger and the passage of time. Then, with a [...] "Now, then!" [...] from the chief, and the sound of a breath expelled <b>through</b> <b>clenched</b> teeth, they would accomplish the interrupted revolution and begin another.|$|E
6000|$|The young man's {{face was}} very red; he was forgetting {{to hide it}} now. Then it went white, and he said <b>through</b> <b>clenched</b> teeth: [...] "She sends me mad! I don't know how not to--If I don't get her, I shall shoot myself. I shall, you know--I'm that sort. It's her eyes. They draw you right out of yourself--and leave you--" [...] And from his gloved hand the smoked-out cigarette-end fell to the floor. [...] "They say her mother was like that. Poor old Johnny! D'you think I've got a chance, Mr. Lennan? I don't mean now, this minute; I know she's too young." ...|$|E
60|$|Sir Terence was no psychologist. But {{he found}} it {{difficult}} to believe in so much of self-sacrifice from a woman for a woman's sake, however dear. Therefore he held to the first alternative. To confirm it came the memory of Sylvia's words to him on the night of Tremayne's arrest. And it was to such a man that she gave the priceless treasure of her love; for such a man, and in such a sordid cause, that she sacrificed the inestimable jewel of her honour? He laughed <b>through</b> <b>clenched</b> teeth at a situation so bitterly ironical. Presently he would talk to her. She should realise what she had done, and he would wish her joy of it. First, however, there was something else to do. He flung himself wearily into the chair at his writing-table, took up a pen and began to write.|$|E
6000|$|... "No?" [...] said Linda, <b>through</b> her <b>clenched</b> teeth. [...] "Is he not? Well, then, look to it; because {{father has}} been walking about with a loaded gun at night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Coward, lache, poltroon, runaway!" [...] {{he hissed}} <b>through</b> his <b>clenched</b> teeth, {{and was about}} to make a thrust in tierce which must infallibly have been fatal, when the Princess Jaqueline, in her shape as a wasp, stung him {{fiercely}} on the wrist.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, let's all sit down," [...] said my uncle, {{suddenly}} whistling <b>through</b> his <b>clenched</b> teeth, and briskly {{rubbing his}} hands together. He {{put up a}} chair for my mother, raised the blind of the little window, lowered it again, {{and returned to his}} hearthrug. [...] "I'm sure," [...] he said, as one who decides, [...] "I'm very glad to see you." ...|$|R
6000|$|Not heaving from my ribbed breast only; Not in sighs at night, in rage, {{dissatisfied}} with myself; Not in those long-drawn, ill-suppressed sighs; Not in many an oath and promise broken; Not in my wilful and savage soul's volition; Not in the subtle nourishment of the air; Not in this beating and pounding at my temples and wrists; Not in the curious systole and diastole within, which {{will one day}} cease; Not in many a hungry wish, told to the skies only; Not in cries, laughter, defiances, thrown from me when alone, far in the [...] wilds; Not in husky pantings <b>through</b> <b>clenched</b> teeth; Not in sounded and resounded words--chattering words, echoes, dead words; Not in the murmurs of my dreams while I sleep, Nor the other murmurs of these incredible dreams of every day; Nor in the limbs and senses of my body, that take you and dismiss you [...] continually--Not there; Not in {{any or all of}} them, O Adhesiveness! O pulse of my life! Need I that you exist and show yourself, any more than in these songs.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Pett was by {{this time}} heartily regretting the impulse which had caused her to {{telephone}} to Mr. Sturgis. In a career which had had {{more than its share}} of detectives, both real and fictitious, she had never been confronted with a detective like this. The galling thing was that she was helpless. After all, one engaged a detective for his or her shrewdness and efficiency, not for suavity and polish. A detective who hurls speech at you <b>through</b> <b>clenched</b> teeth and yet detects is better value for the money than one who, though an ideal companion for the drawing-room, is incompetent: and Mrs. Pett, like most other people, subconsciously held the view that the ruder a person is the more efficient he must be. It is but rarely that any one is found who is not dazzled by the glamour of incivility. She crushed down her resentment at her visitor's tone, and tried to concentrate her mind on the fact that this was a business matter and that what she wanted was results rather than fair words. She found it easier to do this when looking at the other's face. It was a capable face. Not beautiful, perhaps, but full of promise of action. Miss Trimble having ceased temporarily to speak, her mouth was in repose, and when her mouth was in repose it looked more efficient than anything else of its size in existence.|$|E
6000|$|The barber's pole I {{successfully}} {{extracted from}} David's mouth, but the difficulty (not foreseen) {{of knowing how}} to dispose of a barber's pole in the Kensington Gardens is considerable, there always being polite children hovering near who run after you and restore it to you. The young man, again, had said that anyone would lend me a bottle or a lemon, but though these were articles on which he seemed ever able to lay his hand, I found (what I had never noticed before) {{that there is a}} curious dearth of them in the Gardens. The magic egg-cup I usually carried about with me, and with its connivance I did some astonishing things with pennies, but even the penny that costs sixpence is uncertain, and just when you are saying triumphantly that it will be found in the egg-cup, it may clatter to the ground, whereon some ungenerous spectator, such as Irene, accuses you of fibbing and corrupting youthful minds. It was useless to tell her, <b>through</b> <b>clenched</b> teeth, that the whole thing was a joke, for she understood no jokes except her own, of which she had the most immoderately high opinion, and that would have mattered little to me had not David liked them also. There were times when I could not but think less of the boy, seeing him rock convulsed over antics of Irene that have been known to every nursemaid since the year One. While I stood by, sneering, he would give me the ecstatic look that meant, [...] "Irene is really very entertaining, isn't she?" ...|$|E
60|$|Stoutenburg cast a quick, almost furtive {{glance in}} the {{direction}} of the house where he had experienced such dire humiliation a brief half hour ago. A curious whistling sound escaped <b>through</b> his <b>clenched</b> teeth, a sound such as many a wild beast makes when expectant of prey. Then he drew Jan further away from the house, fearful lest his words were wafted toward it on the wind.|$|R
60|$|He {{felt her}} stretch {{out her arms}} and {{presently}} he saw this wonderful thing: the eyes of Swanhild glowing in the darkness as the embers glowed upon the hearth. Now they glowed brightly, so brightly {{that he could see}} the outstretched arms and the hard white face beneath them, and now they grew dim, of a sudden to shine bright again. And all the while she hissed words <b>through</b> her <b>clenched</b> teeth.|$|R
6000|$|... "Forgive me," [...] {{he mumbled}} <b>through</b> pain <b>clenched</b> teeth, as they drew {{in their first}} air again. [...] "And leave me." [...] He spoke jerkily, with pain-filled pauses between his sentences. [...] "There {{is no need for}} both of us to drown. I've got to go. It will be in my stomach, at any moment, and then I'll drag you under, and be unable to let go of you. Please, please, dear, keep away. One of us is enough. You've plenty to live for." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{horror of}} the {{bystanders}} began now {{to give way to}} indignation, and the sight of a favourite companion murdered in the midst of them, the provocation being, in their opinion, so utterly inadequate to the excess of vengeance, might have induced them to kill the perpetrator of the deed even upon the very spot. The constable, however, did his duty on this occasion, and with the assistance of some of the more reasonable persons present, procured horses to guard the prisoner to Carlisle, to abide his doom at the next assizes. While the escort was preparing, the prisoner neither expressed the least interest, nor attempted the slightest reply. Only, before he was carried from the fatal apartment, he desired to look at the dead body, which, raised from the floor, had been deposited upon the large table (at the head of which Harry Wakefield had presided but a few minutes before, full of life, vigour, and animation), until the surgeons should examine the mortal wound. The face of the corpse was decently covered with a napkin. To the surprise and {{horror of the}} bystanders, which displayed itself in a general AH! drawn <b>through</b> <b>clenched</b> teeth and half-shut lips, Robin Oig removed the cloth, and gazed with a mournful but steady eye on the lifeless visage, which had been so lately animated that the smile of good-humoured confidence in his own strength, of conciliation at once and contempt towards his enemy, still curled his lip. While those present expected that the wound, which had so lately flooded the apartment with gore, would send forth fresh streams at the touch of the homicide, Robin Oig replaced the covering with the brief exclamation, [...] "He was a pretty man!" ...|$|E

60|$|There was a {{momentary}} look of deep slyness in Job Trotter's eye, {{as he said}} this, which ran a thrill <b>through</b> Mr. Weller's <b>clenched</b> fist, as he burned {{with a desire to}} make a demonstration on his ribs. Sam constrained himself, however, and replied that his master was extremely well.|$|R
6000|$|But {{he let it}} lie {{carelessly}} in {{his open}} hand, as the gondola moved off, and there it still lay as he stood watching the boat slip under a bridge at the next corner, and disappear. While he stood there gazing at the empty arch, a man of a wild and savage aspect approached. It was said that this man's brain had been turned {{by the death of}} his brother, who was betrayed to the Austrians after the revolution of '48, by his wife's confessor. He advanced with swift strides, and at the moment he reached Don Ippolito's side he suddenly turned his face upon him and cursed him <b>through</b> his <b>clenched</b> teeth: [...] "Dog of a priest!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{he never}} reached the boats. As {{he passed the}} bush Gurnet sprang on him like a tiger and seized him round the throat with both hands, choking a shout that was coming up, and causing his eyes to start almost out of his head. Without uttering a word, and only giving {{now and then a}} terrible hiss <b>through</b> his <b>clenched</b> teeth, Gurnet pushed the Spaniard before him, keeping {{carefully}} {{out of sight of the}} beach, and holding him fast by the nape of the neck, so that when he perceived the slightest symptom of a tendency to cry out he had only to press his strong fingers and effectually nip it in the bud.|$|R
5000|$|Carter Dotson of TV Fanatic {{gave the}} episode {{four out of}} five stars, saying [...] "In reality, this whole episode seemed very self-aware.

5000|$|His little uniform was spic and span, close-fitting, {{his feet}} turned outwards, his hair {{smoothed}} down and greased, his nails perfectly cut, his hands well groomed like a lord's. His manners were elegant, aristocratic: his speech likewise, delivered <b>through</b> somewhat <b>clenched</b> teeth, interspersed with French phrases, rather precious. There was a touch—though very moderate—of foppishness. His politeness and good manners were exceptional. The ladies made a fuss of him. He {{sat at the}} piano and, throwing up his hands coquettishly, played with extreme sweetness and grace (etc) extracts from Trovatore, Traviata, and so on, and around him buzzed in chorus: [...] "Charmant, délicieux!"

He, too, felt that hideous red mist enveloping him and blurring his sight. He hated Andor with all his might, and would have strangled him if he had felt that he had the physical power to do it as well as the moral strength.

He crouched down under the impending blow, his hair bristling, but his teeth still keeping tight hold of the rabbit. But the blow did not fall. The sapling remained bent above him. When he moved it moved, and he growled at it <b>through</b> his <b>clenched</b> jaws; when he remained still, it remained still, and he concluded it was safer to continue remaining still. Yet the warm blood of the rabbit tasted good in his mouth.|$|R
