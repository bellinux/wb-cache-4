60|$|But more: these sad <b>thoughts</b> <b>make</b> <b>us</b> see {{ourselves}} as God sees us. For {{if we see}} faults in ourselves, we may {{be sure that the}} pure and holy God, in whose sight the very heavens are not clean, and who charges his angels with folly, sees our faults with infinitely greater clearness, and in infinitely greater number. So let us face those sad night thoughts, however painful, however humiliating they may be; for by them God is calling us to repentance, and forcing us to keep Lent in spirit and in truth, whether we keep it outwardly or not.|$|E

25|$|Some of his assertions seem {{paradoxical}} {{and difficult}} to understand at first glance, {{not only because they}} are taken out of context, but above all because our habits of <b>thought</b> <b>make</b> <b>us</b> reduce everything to its visible appearance in the world instead of trying to attain its invisible reality in life. It is this separation between visible appearance and invisible reality which allows the dissimulation of our real feelings and which grounds the possibility of sham and hypocrisy, which are forms of lies.|$|R

60|$|The life of Man, viewed outwardly, {{is but a}} {{small thing}} in {{comparison}} with the forces of Nature. The slave is doomed to worship Time and Fate and Death, because they are greater than anything he finds in himself, and because all his thoughts are of things which they devour. But, great as they are, to think of them greatly, to feel their passionless splendour, is greater still. And such <b>thought</b> <b>makes</b> <b>us</b> free men; we no longer bow before the inevitable in Oriental subjection, but we absorb it, and make it a part of ourselves. To abandon the struggle for private happiness, to expel all eagerness of temporary desire, to burn with passion for eternal things--this is emancipation, and this is the free man's worship. And this liberation is effected by a contemplation of Fate; for Fate itself is subdued by the mind which leaves nothing to be purged by the purifying fire of Time.|$|R

The failure to identify meaningful common genetic variation in relation to breast cancer should give us pause for <b>thought</b> and <b>make</b> <b>us</b> reconsider our current research strategies. The most recent directions of pooling samples to increase statistical power and pursuing whole genome screens may overcome some obstacles while also creating new challenges. Future studies should perhaps also consider alternative designs such as using surrogate (preferably continuous) markers of breast cancer, focusing on high-risk populations, and defining pathologically distinct outcomes...|$|R

6000|$|Now, {{just because}} this text is so important, {{the devil is}} {{particularly}} busy {{in trying to make}} people forget it. For what is his plan? Is it not to <b>make</b> <b>us</b> forget God, to put God OUT of all our <b>thoughts,</b> to <b>make</b> <b>us</b> acknowledge God in none of our ways, to <b>make</b> <b>us</b> look at ourselves and not at God, that so we may become first earthly and sensual, and then devilish, like Satan himself? Therefore he tries to <b>make</b> <b>us</b> disbelieve this text. He puts into our hearts such thoughts as these:--'Ay, all good gifts may come from God; but that only means all spiritual gifts. All those fine, deep doctrines and wonderful feelings that some very religious people talk of, about conversion, and regeneration, and sanctification, and assurance, and the witness of the indwelling Spirit,--all those gifts come from God, no doubt, but they are quite above us. We are straightforward, simple people, who cannot feel fine fancies; if we can be honest, and industrious, and good- natured, and sober, and strong, and healthy, that is enough for us,-- and all {{that has nothing to do}} with religion. Those are not gifts which come from God. A man is strong and healthy by birth, and honest and good-natured by nature. Those are very good things; but they are not gifts--they are not GRACES--they are not SPIRITUAL blessings--they have nothing to do with the state of a man's soul. Ungodly people are honest, and good-tempered, and industrious, and healthy, as well as your saints and your methodists; so what is the use of praying for spiritual gifts to God, when we can have all we want by nature?' ...|$|R
40|$|Chronic {{intestinal}} pseudoobstruction (CIPO) {{is a rare}} entity {{characterized by}} recurrent clinical episodes of intestinal obstruc-tion in which no mechanical cause is identified. There are multiple causes for this syndrome but two main groups can be distin-guished: a) secondary to a systemic non-gastrointestinal disease; and b) primary or idiopathic originated from alterations in {{the components of the}} intestinal wall. The latter forms are the most uncommon and their diagnosis is generally difficult. In the present article, we describe nine patients with CIPO that were diagnosed in our center over the last six years. Four of them were diagnosed with primary or idiopathic form of CIPO and another four were clearly secondary to a systemic disease. The ninth case, which was initially diagnosed as secondary, is probably also a primary form of the disease. The number of patients diagnosed in our cen-ter, even <b>thought</b> small, <b>makes</b> <b>us</b> to hypothesize that the preva-lence of CIPO is probably greater than is generally believed and that the reasons of its rarity are the incomplete understanding of its physiopathology and the difficulties to achieve a correct diag-nosis.

5000|$|Apart {{from his}} idylls and his elegies, Chénier also experimented with didactic and philosophic verse, {{and when he}} {{commenced}} his Hermès in 1783 his ambition was to condense the Encyclopédie of Denis Diderot into a long poem somewhat after the manner of Lucretius. Now extant only in fragments, this poem was to treat of man's place in the universe, first in an isolated state, and then in society.

50|$|It can be {{wondered}} why {{we continue to}} think in counterfactual ways if these <b>thoughts</b> tend to <b>make</b> <b>us</b> feel guilty or negatively about an outcome. One of the functional reasons for this is to correct for mistakes and to avoid making them again in the future. If a person is able to consider another outcome based on a different path, they may take that path {{in the future and}} avoid the undesired outcome. It is obvious that the past cannot be changed, however, it is likely that similar situations may occur in the future, and thus we take our counterfactual thoughts as a learning experience. For example, if a person has a terrible interview and thinks about how it may have been more successful if they had responded in a more confident manner, {{they are more likely to}} respond more confidently in their next interview.|$|R

40|$|Today’s society demands {{increasingly}} more from organizations’ ability to innovate and perform. “Resistance to change” {{is seen as}} an obstacle that stands in the way of change implementation, and as {{something that needs to be}} overcome. These challenges are often explained as coming solely from the behavior and attitudes of the change recipients, while the change agents are the ones that are forced to tackle it. The objective of this study is to provide a perspective on some of the knowledge that exists regarding this particular topic. A selective literature review, and rich case citations from my previous Bachelor’s Thesis (2012) in Tourism management, creates the data collection of this thesis. The problem formulation is: “What does research based knowledge say about the underlying nature of resistance to change in organizations?”. The findings from the case study and the literature review are interpreted and analyzed in light of the systems thinking perspective. The findings show that resistance not only exists among the recipients, but at all levels of the organization. They also show that resistance can enhance the quality of the change process. The resistant behaviors, can be explained by the underlying forces of human reasoning. Behavior and attitudes are reflected by these limited thought patterns, and can explain why organizational change often is challenged. The expressed features of these underlying forces, can contribute to sustaining a poor culture for innovation and learning. The findings show that the underlying generic structures of our <b>thought</b> patterns, <b>makes</b> <b>us</b> susceptible for interpreting behaviors, attitudes and events in light of our previous experiences. This limited reasoning can contribute to less creative change processes. The purpose of this research is to provide an explanatory perspective on the underlying nature of the phenomenon of “resistance to change”, that often complicates change implementation...|$|R
60|$|Now {{what makes}} it natural to call this {{principle}} a law of thought {{is that it is}} by thought rather than by outward observation that we persuade ourselves of its necessary truth. When we have seen that a tree is a beech, we do not need to look again in order to ascertain whether it is also not a beech; <b>thought</b> alone <b>makes</b> <b>us</b> know that this is impossible. But the conclusion that the law of contradiction is a law of thought is nevertheless erroneous. What we believe, when we believe the law of contradiction, is not that the mind is so made that it must believe the law of contradiction. This belief is a subsequent result of psychological reflection, which presupposes the belief in the law of contradiction. The belief in the law of contradiction is a belief about things, not only about thoughts. It is not, e.g., the belief that if we think a certain tree is a beech, we cannot at the same time think {{that it is not a}} beech; it is the belief that if the tree is a beech, it cannot at the same time be not a beech. Thus the law of contradiction is about things, and not merely about thoughts; and although belief in the law of contradiction is a thought, the law of contradiction itself is not a thought, but a fact concerning the things in the world. If this, which we believe when we believe the law of contradiction, were not true of the things in the world, the fact that we were compelled to think it true would not save the law of contradiction from being false; and this shows that the law is not a law of thought.|$|R
