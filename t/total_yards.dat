5|$|Jones {{made the}} Pro Bowl again in 1952, {{when he had}} 952 <b>total</b> <b>yards</b> and six touchdowns.

In 1953, Jones's production declined: he had just 401 <b>total</b> <b>yards</b> and no touchdowns, and he decided to retire after the Browns reached and lost another championship game. He went back to Ruston to work at a lumber business he ran in the offseason, but Brown asked him to return in 1954, saying the team needed him. Jones played for two more years, winning two more championships with the Browns before retiring for good. He pulled his hamstring in an exhibition game before the 1955 season, an injury that caused him to miss several games and bothered him all season.|$|E

5|$|As Cannon—along {{with most}} of the {{defensive}} starters—returned, LSU was expected to compete for another title in 1959.

Cannon showed his versatility in those games; he led the team in <b>total</b> <b>yards</b> on offense, returned an interception for a touchdown on defense, and averaged 40 yards per punt while also returning punts and kickoffs.
