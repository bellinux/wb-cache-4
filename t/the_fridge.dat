5|$|While Walter and Agent Astrid Farnsworth (Jasika Nicole) {{ensure that}} the witness is safe at the hospital, Olivia takes Peter back to the lab. Peter, {{suffering}} from a headache, takes an aspirin and drinks out of what he believes to be an ordinary bottle of milk from <b>the</b> <b>fridge.</b> In reality, the milk contains a serum developed by Walter {{in order to help}} him recover his full mental function. However, the serum was incorrectly prepared, which causes Peter to begin convulsing. Over the phone, Walter directs Olivia to inject Peter with the correct compounds in order to save his life. Walter realizes that the serum would have killed him if he had consumed it, and that this was another step in the Observer's plot. Later that evening, September meets with another Observer, and identifies the fact that Walter was able to let Peter go, despite believing that he may not survive, and that when the time comes, they can expect Walter to do it again.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Fridge</b> Gate {{method is}} a {{theoretical}} application {{of using a}} single logic gate to drive a refrigerator in the most energy efficient way possible without violating the laws of thermodynamics. It operates {{on the fact that}} there are two energy states in which a particle can exist: the ground state and the excited state. The excited state carries a little more energy than the ground state, small enough so that the transition occurs with high probability. There are three components or particle types associated with <b>the</b> <b>fridge</b> gate. The first is on the interior of <b>the</b> <b>fridge,</b> the second on the outside and the third is connected to a power supply which heats up every so often that it can reach the E state and replenish the source. In the cooling step on the inside of <b>the</b> <b>fridge,</b> the g state particle absorbs energy from ambient particles, cooling them, and itself jumping to the e state. In the second step, on the outside of <b>the</b> <b>fridge</b> where the particles are also at an e state, the particle falls to the g state, releasing energy and heating the outside particles. In the third and final step, the power supply moves a particle at the e state, and when it falls to the g state it induces an energy-neutral swap where the interior e particle is replaced by a new g particle, restarting the cycle.|$|E

25|$|Many {{techniques}} {{exist for}} removing established bad habits, e.g., withdrawal of reinforcers—identifying and removing factors that trigger and reinforce the habit. The basal ganglia appears {{to remember the}} context that triggers a habit, so habits can be revived if triggers reappear. Recognizing and eliminating bad habits {{as soon as possible}} is advised. Habit elimination becomes more difficult with age because repetitions reinforce habits cumulatively over the lifespan. According to Charles Duhigg, there is a loop that includes a cue, routine and reward for every habit. An example of a habit loop is TV program ends (cue), go to <b>the</b> <b>fridge</b> (routine), eat a snack (reward). The key to changing habits is to identify your cue and modify your routine and reward.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} the first to be filmed, in September 2010. It was mainly filmed on a council estate in Bath, Somerset, while the scenes in the dollhouse were filmed in Dyrham Park. The Bristol estate was chosen because of its [...] "crisp architecture". The country house of Dyrham Park was chosen because of its {{staircase}} and checked flooring. The antiques were stripped out of the building and replaced with [...] "child-like" [...] furniture that was placed to look {{as though it had been}} played with. Several designs of the dolls were made, trying to achieve the desired balance of a normal doll and a scarier, more [...] "crude"-looking one.

In the scene in which Alex and the Doctor are in the kitchen they open and close <b>the</b> <b>fridge</b> as they are talking; this was not in the script, but improvised by Smith and Mays on set. Mays was invited to guest-star in the episode, and was drawn to the story because of the family element; he has a young son like George.

500|$|Many {{scenes from}} the {{original}} episode were seen as vulgar and {{were removed from the}} television broadcast. [...] One of the scenes removed was {{from the beginning of the}} episode when Stewie, Chris, and his friends were watching Genital Hospital, a reference to the television show General Hospital. The original scene had included the doctor on the film undoing his zipper after discussing the patient's health problems. The edited version cut away before the doctor could undo his zipper, but the sound can still be heard when it cuts back to Chris and his friends watching the porno. Another scene edited was a naked Peter shown crouched on top of Lois's head (attempting ear sex) (even though it was shown on Adult Swim every time the episode repeats). On the TV version, Peter is still naked, but it is implied (through sound effects) that Lois forcibly pushed him to the floor and she has a hand on her ear (impling Peter attempted ear sex). In this scene, Peter refers to the Grimace as Ronald McDonald's autistic friend, which was originally penned as [...] "retarded friend" [...] (and is included in the uncut version). A scene in which Brian, wearing a robe, informs Lois of the weird tasting Smuckers jelly in <b>the</b> <b>fridge</b> leads Peter to reveal that the Smuckers was on his penis was edited on TV so that way he states that the jelly was on his crotch. In a scene added later to the episode, Mel Gibson apologizes to the Jewish community after being offensive while continuing to offend them. The scene was added after the episode had been made but prior to broadcasting. When Peter joins Meg in her quest to be abstinent, the TV version has a gag where Peter keeps mispronouncing the word, Meg corrects him, and Peter punishes her by sending her to her room. The Adult Swim and DVD version replaces that scene with one that was edited for being insensitive to Asian people in which Peter tells Meg that now that he is abstinent, he will be as untouched as the turn signal on an Asian woman's car, followed by a cutaway of an Asian lady causing an accident on an eight-lane highway. In the scene involving Stewie entering Herbert's house, a picture of Chris with the body of a model was in the animatic, but not shown on TV. The original ending of this episode (with the [...] "choose your own ending" [...] text message contest) was supposed to have Lois and Peter throw Brian out the window instead of giving Cleveland his one and only appearance in the episode. This deleted scene is featured in the episode animatic on the season five DVD set.|$|E

2500|$|Less {{than three}} months after the murder of Smith, Dahmer {{encountered}} a 22-year-old Chicago native named Ernest Miller on the corner of North 27th Street. Miller agreed to accompany Dahmer to his apartment for $50 and further agreed to allow him to listen to his heart and stomach. When Dahmer attempted to perform oral sex upon Miller, he was informed: [...] "That'll cost you extra," [...] whereupon Dahmer gave his intended victim a drink laced with two sleeping pills. On this occasion, however, he had had only two sleeping pills to give his victim; therefore, he killed Miller by slashing his carotid artery with the same knife he used to dissect his victims' bodies. Miller bled to death within minutes. Dahmer then posed the nude body for various suggestive Polaroid photographs before placing the body in his bathtub for dismemberment. Dahmer repeatedly kissed and talked to the severed head while he dismembered the remainder of the body. He wrapped Miller's heart, biceps, and portions of flesh from the legs in plastic bags and placed them in <b>the</b> <b>fridge</b> for later consumption.

40|$|Increased use of {{variable}} energy {{and integration of}} electricity markets in the European Union have led to new challenges when balancing supply and demand in the grid. Load management is a possible way to manage these challenges by adjusting electricity consumption in order to balance the power system. Household appliances {{can be used for}} this purpose, for example by providing automatic frequency control. The aim of this master thesis is to investigate the potential of load management from private households and to examine how the power system is affected by a more flexible electricity consumption. The thesis focuses on fridges as automatic frequency control reserves and <b>the</b> ability of <b>fridges</b> to balance <b>the</b> power system. Attributes such as capacity, activation time, persistence and the effect of load reconnection has been modelled in Simulink, Matlab. Complementary interviews with actors from the electricity industry have been done to summarize their insights on demand response. The results indicate that fridges {{can be used as a}} part of the automatic frequency controlled reserve FCR-N, based on assumptions made in this study. However, current requirements imposed on balancing resources are not fully met by <b>the</b> <b>fridges.</b> In order for household appliances to provide the needed flexibility, some requirements might need to be rephrased. The results also show that the capacity for providing balancing services differs for positive and negative imbalances, as consumption can be reduced with 30 MW and increased with 66 MW. When controlling <b>the</b> <b>fridges</b> by moving <b>the</b> reference temperature, there is a risk that the appliances will synchronize with each other, i. e. reconnect or disconnect at the same time, resulting in frequency oscillations. It is therefore important that load management is designed to avoid this kind of behavior...|$|R
