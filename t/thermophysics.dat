40|$|Some known {{results from}} {{statistical}} <b>thermophysics</b> {{as well as}} from hydrology are revisited from a different perspective trying: (a) to unify the notion of entropy in thermodynamic and statistical/stochastic approaches of complex hydrological systems and (b) to show the power of entropy and the principle of maximum entropy in inference, both deductive and inductive. The capability for deductive reasoning is illustrated by deriving the law of phase change transition of water (Clausius-Clapeyron) from scratch by maximizing entropy in a formal probabilistic frame. However, such deductive reasoning cannot work in more complex hydrological systems with diverse elements, yet the entropy maximization framework can help in inductive inference, necessarily based on data.

40|$|Molecular {{dynamics}} simulation is {{an important}} method for the research of <b>thermophysics.</b> But {{it is difficult to}} implement the simulation with traditional serial algorithms because of a complex numerical calculation. A cluster-based spatial decomposition algorithm for solving large-scale Molecular Dynamics simulation of <b>thermophysics</b> is proposed in this paper. With the efficient strategy of domain decomposition and the fast method of neighboring particle location, we greatly reduce the calculating and communicating cost and successfully process the MD simulation for PVT property calculation of a large-scale system with 4, 000, 000 particles. The spatial decomposition algorithm is implemented on 125 processors with the speedup(Sp) of 86. 4 and the efficiency(E) of 69. 1 %.
