5|$|Filming {{took place}} {{throughout}} April 2009. Before it began, production designer Anthony Ainsworth partly reconstructed the Grid set {{to give it}} more of a concrete, underground bunker, feel. Though more television series in the UK are adopting high-definition cameras, the Spooks producers decided to continue using hand held standard-definition ones, which were more compact and flexible; the producers felt that using high-definition cameras would sacrifice the filming style of the series. For instance, a hand held camera would allow the crew to film one long take following cast members through tight spaces, like an average London flat. High-definition cameras would lose <b>that</b> <b>ability.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to gaining levels, Guardian Forces earn Ability Points (AP) after battles, which are automatically allocated to special abilities that Guardian Forces can learn. When a Guardian Force has learned an ability, <b>that</b> <b>ability</b> becomes available for any character or the character party, {{as is the}} case with field abilities. These abilities allow characters to attack more efficiently, refine magic spells from items, receive stat bonuses upon leveling up, access shops remotely and use additional battle commands.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examines}} whether this congru-ence model applies to entity and incremental {{theories about the}} malleability of personal attributes (Dweck, 1999). Dweck has shown that people who believe <b>that</b> <b>abilities</b> and traits are fixed (“entity theorists”) are moti-vated to pursue different goals than those who believe <b>that</b> <b>abilities</b> and traits are malleable (“incremental the-orists”). El-Alayli and Baumgardner (2003) proposed a model that suggests that {{in the face of}} failure, entity and incremental theorists may show the strongest achievement strivings in contexts that facilitate the pur-suit of their own goals of interest. The present research provides a comprehensive test of this congruence model and investigates the possible moderating effects of competence valuation (Harackiewicz & Mander-link, 1984) and achievement motivation (McClelland...|$|R
5|$|Taylor was {{the first}} Compulsory Process Clause case since Washington v. Texas to provide a {{specific}} limitation {{on the right of}} defendants to force their witnesses to testify. In that case, the Court construed a defendant's right very broadly in his ability to present a defense. Here, however, the Court restricted <b>that</b> <b>ability</b> to comply with court rules, especially if those rules were of equal consequence upon both the prosecution and the defense. This decision was reached over the dissent of three Justices, all of whom felt a defendant's case should not be limited based on an error solely by the defendant's attorney to list appropriate witnesses.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy X-2 reintroduces the series' classic {{character}} class system (seen previously in Final Fantasy III, Final Fantasy V and Final Fantasy Tactics) through {{the inclusion of}} dresspheres. Because the party never grows beyond three characters, switching characters during battle is unnecessary. Instead, the player can switch {{character class}}es, providing access to different abilities. The playable characters are allowed to equip one dressphere at a time, each providing different battle functions and abilities. Characters can learn new skills for each dressphere {{with the use of}} Ability Points (AP). AP is obtained by defeating enemies and by the use of items and abilities for that sphere. Abilities to be learned are chosen in the main menu. During battle, AP is given to <b>that</b> <b>ability</b> until it is learned. Each character can access as many as six dresspheres at a time, depending on the specific properties of the Garment Grid they are wearing. The Garment Grid is a placard featuring a geometric shape connected by nodes. These nodes are slots that can be filled with dresspheres, allowing characters to change character classes during their turn in battle. Most Garment Grids possess Gates that when passed through grant the user a complimentary buff.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the way of career {{education}} in moral education from the viewpoint of "social inclusion". At first, we examined the meaning of work in modern society, because exclusion from work often falls into the loss of role in society, i. e. "social exclusion", in modern society. Next, we examined the efforts of Fujisato-machi Social Welfare Council (at Akita Prefecture), which is making good results in employment support for people in "social exclusion" such as "Hikikomori (Social Withdrawal) ". Finally, based on the result of that effort, we suggested <b>that</b> <b>abilities</b> to cope with severe realities is important for children, and we have to educate for being acquired <b>that</b> <b>abilities</b> as career education in moral education...|$|R

25|$|New {{research}} is surfacing that suggests <b>that</b> <b>ability</b> EI measures might be measuring personality {{in addition to}} general intelligence. These studies examined the multivariate effects of personality and intelligence on EI and also corrected estimates for measurement error (which is often not done in some validation studies). For example, a study by Schulte, Ree, Carretta (2004), showed that general intelligence (measured with the Wonderlic Personnel Test), agreeableness (measured by the NEO-PI), as well as gender could reliably be used to predict the measure of EI ability.|$|E

The equivalent Marriage and Civil Partnership (Scotland) Act 2014 does not grant <b>that</b> <b>ability,</b> but includes provision for its later introduction, and does permit those already in civil partnership with one another to marry without first dissolving the mutual civil partnership.|$|E

25|$|Toothed {{whales are}} capable of making {{a broad range of}} sounds using nasal airsacs located just below the blowhole. Roughly three {{categories}} of sounds can be identified: frequency-modulated whistles, burst-pulsed sounds, and clicks. Dolphins communicate with whistle-like sounds produced by vibrating connective tissue, similar to the way human vocal cords function, and through burst-pulsed sounds, though {{the nature and extent of}} <b>that</b> <b>ability</b> is not known. The clicks are directional and are used for echolocation, often occurring in a short series called a click train. The click rate increases when approaching an object of interest. Toothed whale biosonar clicks are amongst the loudest sounds made by marine animals.|$|E
25|$|Planeswalkers' {{abilities}} {{are based on}} their loyalty, which is tracked with counters. The number printed in the lower right corner indicates how many loyalty counters the planeswalker enters the battlefield with. Planeswalkers' loyalty abilities each have a positive or negative loyalty cost; this is how many counters must be added (if positive) or removed (if negative) to activate <b>that</b> <b>ability.</b> Abilities with negative loyalty costs may only be activated if there are enough loyalty counters to remove. Regardless of the loyalty costs, a single planeswalker may only use one loyalty ability once per turn, and only on its controller's turn during his or her main phase.|$|E

25|$|At {{very high}} doses, AZT's {{triphosphate}} form may also inhibit DNA polymerase used by human cells to undergo cell division, {{but regardless of}} dosage AZT has an approximately 100-fold greater affinity for HIV's reverse transcriptase. The selectivity has been proven {{to be due to}} the cell's ability to quickly repair its own DNA chain if it is broken by AZT during its formation, whereas the HIV virus lacks <b>that</b> <b>ability.</b> Thus AZT inhibits HIV replication without affecting the function of uninfected cells. At sufficiently high dosages, AZT begins to inhibit the cellular DNA polymerase used by mitochondria to replicate, accounting for its potentially toxic but reversible effects on cardiac and skeletal muscles, causing myositis.|$|E
500|$|There are 34 [...] "jobs" [...] in Tactics Advance {{that govern}} a character's stats, equipment, and abilities. Most items {{that can be}} {{equipped}} have various abilities assigned to them, each available for use by characters of a certain job while the item is equipped. When a battle is completed, characters will receive Ability Points (AP) distributed over their currently equipped weapons or items (such as armor). Once a target amount of AP has been accumulated for a given ability, the character will master <b>that</b> <b>ability,</b> allowing the character to use them at any time, regardless of items equipped and job chosen. Mastery of abilities in different jobs will eventually allow the character access to more jobs. For example, if a human unit wishes to change jobs to Paladin, it needs to master at least two [...] "action" [...] abilities from the Soldier job.|$|E
500|$|A skill {{unique to}} Zael is Gathering: when activated, all enemies within an area will focus their {{attention}} on him, allowing other team members to act without interruption. As the game progresses, Zael can issue commands to the other team members, with the perspective switching to a top-down view for this action. In addition to standard combat, players can switch to a behind-the-shoulder perspective for manually firing Zael's crossbow, which can launch a variety of ammunition at enemies and objects. Enemies in Zael's sights will have their weaknesses and abilities revealed. In battle, destructible objects in the environment {{can be used by}} the party to defeat enemies; these objects regenerate after a time rather than remaining destroyed. Magic cast by characters with <b>that</b> <b>ability</b> leave the casting area temporarily imbued with a spell's elemental properties. These circles' environmental effects can be combined and spread by using another spell, such as Zael using his [...] "Wind" [...] magic to spread the area of effect while the magic circle is active. In addition, characters can imbue their weapons with elemental properties from the circles.|$|E

500|$|In the model, {{domestic}} {{social welfare}} {{can be defined}} as the home firm's profit net of the subsidy (the model can be extended so that social welfare includes the firm's monopoly profit as well as the wages paid to the firm's workers; the results are qualitatively the same). It can be shown that the profit function evaluated at equilibrium quantity levels is concave in s and eventually negatively sloped. As a result, there is an [...] "optimal subsidy" [...] which maximizes the domestic firm's profits and hence domestic social welfare. As it turns out, if the government sets the subsidy exactly at the optimal level, the resulting equilibrium is {{the same as that of}} the [...] "leader and follower" [...] Stackelberg model. In that case one of the firms (in this case the domestic firm) has the ability to choose its output first. This creates the ability to credibly commit to a particular action, resulting in [...] "first mover advantage". In the Brender–Spencer model, the government's subsidy creates this credible commitment even when the private firm does not have <b>that</b> <b>ability.</b>|$|E
