5|$|British Prime Minister Winston Churchill was {{concerned}} that, given the enormous size of Soviet forces deployed in Europe {{at the end}} of the war, and the perception <b>that</b> <b>Soviet</b> leader Joseph Stalin was unreliable, there existed a Soviet threat to Western Europe.|$|E
5|$|In {{dealing with}} Stalin, Truman {{decided to give}} the Soviet leader vague hints about the {{existence}} of a powerful new weapon without going into details. However, the other Allies were unaware <b>that</b> <b>Soviet</b> intelligence had penetrated the Manhattan Project in its early stages, so Stalin already knew of the existence of the atomic bomb but did not appear impressed by its potential.|$|E
5|$|Sexist attitudes still prevailed across Soviet society. Men in the {{leadership}} often did not take women or their ideas seriously, and excluded them from many discussions. Domestic violence and sexual harassment continued to exist. Yet, sociological studies at the time found <b>that</b> <b>Soviet</b> women tended not to see their inequality as a problem.|$|E
25|$|The Yugoslav {{party on}} its side claimed <b>that</b> the <b>Soviets</b> had {{corrupted}} the conference documentation, <b>that</b> the <b>Soviets</b> had tried to portray {{a greater degree of}} unity between the parties than what had actually been the case at the conference.|$|R

25|$|Modern Polish historians {{maintain}} <b>that</b> the <b>Soviet</b> partisans were despised {{by local}} populations, as {{they engaged in}} plunder and terrorised the inhabitants. Bogdan Musial also suggests <b>that</b> the <b>Soviet</b> partisans preferred to assault the less challenging Belarusian and Polish self-defense units rather than German military and police targets.|$|R
5|$|Although the Wehrmacht's {{offensive}} {{had been}} stopped, German intelligence estimated <b>that</b> <b>Soviet</b> forces {{had no more}} reserves left and thus {{would be unable to}} stage a counteroffensive. This estimate proved wrong, as Stalin transferred over 18 divisions, 1,700 tanks, and over 1,500 aircraft from Siberia and the Far East. The Red Army had accumulated a 58-division reserve by early December, when the offensive proposed by Zhukov and Vasilevsky was finally approved by Stalin. Even with these new reserves, Soviet forces committed to the operation numbered only 1,100,000 men, only slightly outnumbering the Wehrmacht. Nevertheless, with careful troop deployment, a ratio of two-to-one was reached at some critical points.|$|E
5|$|It must {{be taken}} into account <b>that</b> <b>Soviet</b> T-26 was one the most modern tanks of the world when it arrived to Spain, and Soviet Army tank {{doctrine}} was really advanced. Unfortunately for the Spanish Government during these years Stalin decided to eliminate all those generals that supported modern tank warfare and sent to Spain the officers that he liked. This meant Soviet tanks potential was never exploited in Spain as it could.|$|E
5|$|Sea {{trials for}} Petropavlovsk were {{scheduled}} to begin sometime in late 1941, {{and according to the}} training program, the Soviet crew would not begin training until a month before the trials. It was decided <b>that</b> <b>Soviet</b> officers would train at German naval schools in the Fall of 1941, and that five officers would train aboard Seydlitz when the ship was commissioned for trials. German instructors would also be sent to Leningrad to train engine-room personnel. At the time of the commissioning of Petropavlovsk, the relevant German training and technical manuals would be sent to the Soviet Navy, albeit in German only.|$|E
2500|$|OKL {{estimated}} <b>that</b> the <b>Soviets</b> {{possessed a}} workforce of 250,000, 50 fuselage/airframe factories, 15 aero engine factories, 40 factories building aircraft equipment and appliances, and 100 auxiliary factories. It {{was believed that}} the purges of the 1930s had severely affected the Soviet aeronautics industry, and <b>that</b> the <b>Soviet</b> Union did not possess the ability to copy foreign models, while lacking the electrometals required to do so. They based this largely on the fact <b>that</b> the <b>Soviets</b> were importing electrometals from Germany, {{as part of the}} Nazi-Soviet pact, August 1939. A report from 1938 concluded; ...|$|R

5000|$|The initial CIA mistake {{proved to}} be regrettable, however the British would later share {{intelligence}} from Penkovsky with their American allies. For the following eighteen months, Penkovsky supplied {{a tremendous amount of}} information to his British Secret Intelligence Service handlers in Moscow, Ruari and Janet Chisholm, and to CIA and SIS contacts during his permitted trips abroad. Most significantly, he was responsible for arming President John F. Kennedy with the information <b>that</b> the <b>Soviet</b> nuclear arsenal was much smaller than previously thought, <b>that</b> the <b>Soviet</b> fueling systems were not fully operational, and <b>that</b> the <b>Soviet</b> guidance systems were not yet functional.|$|R
5|$|Soviet {{intelligence}} reports issued from 8 to 9 July reported that defensive works were being constructed by German infantry on the flanks of the 4th Panzer Army, and that German armoured formations were {{not present in}} these locations, despite the fact <b>that</b> <b>Soviet</b> armoured formations were situated opposite these flanks. Voronezh Front headquarters supposed the Germans must be reaching their limit, and on 10 July decided to set its counterattack {{to coincide with the}} planned Soviet counteroffensive on the northern side of the Kursk salient, Operation Kutuzov, which was set for 12 July.|$|E
5|$|Accounts differ as to {{the cause}} of death; one version stated that he died by poison only and another view claimed he died by a self-inflicted gunshot while biting down on a cyanide capsule. Contemporary historians have {{rejected}} these accounts as being either Soviet propaganda or an attempted compromise in order to reconcile the different conclusions. One eyewitness stated that Hitler's corpse showed signs of having been shot through the mouth, but this has been proven unlikely. There is also controversy regarding the authenticity of skull and jaw fragments that were recovered. In 2009, American researchers performed DNA tests on a skull <b>that</b> <b>Soviet</b> officials had long believed to be that of Hitler. The tests and examination revealed that the skull was actually that of a woman less than 40 years old. The recovered jaw fragments were not tested.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the {{involvement}} of the Kersten committee and of Kersten and Hillings caused concern for the CIA. Dulles constantly worried that their investigation would damage CIA operations, particularly when Hillings visited Guatemala shortly before PBSUCCESS was to begin. Additionally, Congresspeople had not officially been informed of the CIA's role in the coup, and Dulles wished to keep them uninformed. By supplying them with PBHistory documents, Dulles hoped to forestall them from inadvertently exposing the CIA's other projects. Following the hearings, a subcommittee headed by Hillings produced a final report. In addition to stating without evidence that the Guatemalan government had been acting under orders from the Soviet Union, this report also falsely claimed <b>that</b> <b>Soviet</b> weapons had been brought covertly to Guatemala by submarine. This unintentionally drew attention to Operation WASHTUB, a CIA effort to foist incriminating weapons on the Guatemalan government.|$|E

5000|$|The Warren Commission {{reported}} that they found no evidence <b>that</b> the <b>Soviet</b> Union {{was involved in the}} assassination of President Kennedy. The House Select Committee on Assassinations also wrote: [...] "The committee believes, {{on the basis of the}} evidence available to it, <b>that</b> the <b>Soviet</b> Government was not involved in the assassination of President Kennedy".|$|R

5|$|The Japanese government's pre-war {{plans to}} protect the country from air attack focused on {{neutralizing}} enemy air bases. Before the war it was believed <b>that</b> <b>Soviet</b> aircraft based in the Russian Far East posed the greatest threat. The Japanese military planned to destroy the air bases within range of the home islands if Japan and the Soviet Union ever went to war. When the Pacific War began, the Japanese government believed {{that the best way}} to prevent American air raids was to capture and hold the areas in China and the Pacific from which such attacks could be launched. It was expected that the Allies would not be able to re-capture these bases. However, the Japanese anticipated that the Allies might still make small-scale attacks against the home islands using naval aircraft flying from aircraft carriers. The government chose not to develop strong defenses to meet the threat of air attack as the country's industrial resources were unable to maintain offensive air forces in China and the Pacific as well as a defensive force in the home islands.|$|E
5|$|As {{test flights}} {{conducted}} by No. 617 Squadron proved {{that it was}} not possible to make a return trip to Kaafjord from Scotland, and an evaluation of the main airstrip in the Shetlands determined that it was unsuitable for Lancasters, No. 5 Group's staff officers judged that it would be necessary for the aircraft to refuel in the Soviet Union. Detailed investigation of the airstrips near Murmansk found that they were at best marginal for heavy bombers and had almost no accommodation or aircraft servicing facilities. Moreover, the airstrips were vulnerable to attack from fighters operating from nearby German bases. Instead, it was decided that the attack force should fly over northern Sweden and Finland after raiding Kaafjord and refuel at Yagodnik airstrip, which was located on an island near Arkhangelsk. This plan was accepted by the Air Ministry on 6 September. Soviet Naval Aviation offered to attack German fighter bases at the same time as the British bombers arrived over the target area, but No. 5 Group rejected this proposal and requested <b>that</b> <b>Soviet</b> aircraft not fly near Kaafjord, to avoid alerting the Germans.|$|E
5|$|Despite the parties' ostensibly cordial relations, {{each side}} was highly {{suspicious}} of the other's intentions. For instance, the Soviet invasion of Bukovina in June 1940 went beyond their sphere of influence as agreed with Germany. After Germany entered the Axis Pact with Japan and Italy, it began negotiations about a potential Soviet entry into the pact. After two days of negotiations in Berlin from 12 to 14 November 1940, Germany presented a written proposal for a Soviet entry into the Axis. On 25 November 1940, the Soviet Union offered a written counter-proposal to join the Axis if Germany would agree to refrain from interference in the Soviet Union's sphere of influence, but Germany did not respond. As both sides began colliding {{with each other in}} Eastern Europe, conflict appeared more likely, although they did sign a border and commercial agreement addressing several open issues in January 1941. Historian Robert Service avows <b>that</b> <b>Soviet</b> leader Joseph Stalin was convinced that the overall military strength of the USSR was such that he had nothing to fear and anticipated an easy victory should Germany attack; moreover, Stalin believed that since the Germans were still fighting the British in the west, Hitler would be unlikely to open up a two front war and subsequently delayed the reconstruction of defensive fortifications in the border regions. When German soldiers swam across the Bug River to warn the Red Army of an impending attack, they were treated like enemy agents and shot. Some historians believe that Stalin, despite providing an amicable front to Hitler, did not wish to remain allies with Germany. Rather, Stalin might have had intentions to break off from Germany and proceed with his own campaign against Germany to be followed by one against the rest of Europe.|$|E

5|$|In {{his article}} of 2002, Alan A. Stone, {{who as a}} member of team had {{examined}} Pyotr Grigorenko and found him mentally healthy in 1979, disregarded the findings of the World Psychiatric Association and the later avowal of Soviet psychiatrists themselves and put forward the academically revisionist theory that there was no political abuse of psychiatry as a tool against pacific dissidence in the former USSR. He asserted {{that it was time for}} psychiatry in the Western countries to reconsider the supposedly documented accounts of political abuse of psychiatry in the USSR in the hope of discovering <b>that</b> <b>Soviet</b> psychiatrists were more deserving of sympathy than condemnation. In Stone's words, he believes that Snezhnevsky was wrongly condemned by critics. According to Stone, one of the first points the Soviet psychiatrists who have been condemned for unethical political abuse of psychiatry make is that the revolution is the greatest good for the greatest number, the greatest piece of social justice, and the greatest beneficence imaginable in the twentieth century. In the Western view, the ethical compass of the Soviet psychiatrists begins to wander when they act in the service of this greatest beneficence.|$|E

Baryshnikov cites {{the former head of the}} Office of Information of the Finnish General Staff, Kalle Lehmus, and other Finnish sources to show that the Finnish leaders already knew of the limited Soviet plans for Finland in the first half of July 1944, after intelligence indicated <b>that</b> some <b>Soviet</b> divisions were to be transferred to reserve in Leningrad.|$|R
