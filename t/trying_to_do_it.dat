25|$|Šarūnas {{started going}} to school in Jonas Jablonskis Middle School in 1982 and {{attended}} it till 1987. He {{had to take the}} bus to go to school even though the thermometer outside read minus twenty and he knew {{that the most important thing}} for his parents was that he spent as little time as possible with the toughest people of Partizanai Street. From 1987 to 1993, he was studying at Kaunas 4th Middle School. His first trip destination was Moscow, which he visited before the tournament. Jasikevičius's greatest youth memory in the city was the opening of the first McDonald's in Russia. He remembers that his classmates were listening with their mouths gaping when he was narrating about the French fries, bread rolls with minced beef and fizzy drinks. One of his childhood passions was history, especially about the Native Americans, as well as books about basketball as he was capable of reading a book of more than four hundred pages on basketball in two days. He was also curious about politics, especially when Perestroika began, because of which he was able to travel to Berlin with his father and brother, and was amazed by the visit to the Checkpoint Charlie Museum. His childhood favorite Lithuanian player was Arvydas Sabonis, which he admired more than other Lithuanian superstars, such as Rimas Kurtinaitis and Valdemaras Chomičius, due to his passing. However, his idol was Dražen Petrović, and he wished to be as good as him, watching matches of him over and over again, dozens of times, for hours and hours, and later started imitating him in workouts. After one of his trips, his dad came back with a videocassette recorder, using which he was able to record an NBA All-Star Game with Michael Jordan, Clyde Drexler, Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, David Robinson, and later to watch it for couple of years, more than hundred times. Jasikevičius also started to record games of Žalgiris and Petrović every time he was able to. Thanks to the video recorder, he discovered the existence of a no-look pass of Magic Johnson. For him, he was the NBA, not Michael Jordan. His unselfishness, imagination and the way he dribbled, passed between his opponent's legs bewitched Jasikevičius. Consequently, his favorite element of basketball quickly became assisting his teammates, and he was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> like Petrović or Johnson.|$|E

500|$|... "Simpson Tide" [...] {{was one of}} two season nine episodes {{that was}} {{executive}} produced by Al Jean and Mike Reiss, who together were the showrunners for the third and fourth seasons. Although Jean would later return to run the show the following season, it was the last episode that Reiss received an executive producer credit for. Joshua Sternin and Jeffrey Ventimilia, the episode writers, were working on Jean and Reiss's show The Critic at the time, and pitched an episode where Homer joins the Naval Reserve. Although the episode is partly based on the film Crimson Tide, the original episode pitch was made before the film was released. After the release of the film, the writers decided to start incorporating things from the movie in the script. In the original draft, Bart sneaked on board the submarine with Homer. They were <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> [...] "for the comedy of it", but could not get the draft to work, so it was cut. It was difficult for them {{to figure out how to}} get the captain off of the sub and they eventually decided to have him shot out of the torpedo tube, which in the DVD commentary, Al Jean says that Steiger claimed that he really did get stuck in a torpedo tube once.|$|E
500|$|Following Tahil's departure, plots were {{abandoned}} and many scripts {{had to be}} rewritten. EastEnders scriptwriter Tony Jordan revealed that it was intended that Dan would be murdered by his children after prolonged bullying and abuse, saying [...] "The family arrived in Albert Square in what {{was expected to be}} a huge storyline. The father [...] was an oppressive and violent bully – eventually his children were going to kill him. It was all scripted – how they buried him in a shallow grave, how they dealt with it, and how it all exploded. And then Dalip got bloody deported. He was actually on the studio floor and they marched him off. Broken legs, nervous breakdowns – we can deal with that. But when actors are physically taken away by the government and deported, there's not much you can do. Fifty scripts had to be reworked. And because all the episodes had been written around this big storyline, we had to keep the same amount of Ferreira material." [...] The murder storyline was replaced with one concerning a kidney transplant between Ronny and his newly discovered half brother Tariq. Jordan admitted they could have recast the character of Dan, but it may have looked [...] "tacky": [...] "We couldn't go, 'Tonight, the part of Mr Ferreira will be played by Michael French with a suntan'. We were <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> with integrity. Then somebody said, 'What if Ronnie Ferreira's mate Tariq turns out to be his half-brother and we do the whole kidney transplant thing?' And, of course, it was like watching paint dry. 'Can I have your kidney?' 'No. Oh, go on then...'" [...] Jordan told the Daily Mirror the Ferreiras were [...] "the least successful characters I created – through no fault of their own." ...|$|E

2500|$|In January 2011, the Armenian National Cinema Center {{announced}} that it was holding talks with world-known film director Steven Spielberg and Armenian American screenwriter Steven Zaillian to produce a full-length feature film about the Armenian Genocide.

We want more than the films Mayrig or Ararat." [...] Over a year later, in February 2012 the center declined the claims that Spielberg is involved in producing such on the 100th anniversary of the genocide. Vardan Abovian, the deputy director of the Armenian National Film Academy, said that they [...] "indeed have plans on a movie on the Armenian genocide, however, this is still in the 'idea' phase and nothing has been decided yet. We are trying to find the budget." [...] Ruzanna Bagratunyan, spokesperson for the center, stated that the movie [...] "is a huge load of work, and we are <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> in time; all of us understand what this date [...] means for the whole Armenian nation." ...|$|E

60|$|There are, of course, a few, a very few, of our {{greatest}} authors who have striven forward to the first place in our Valhalla {{without the help of}} the largest reading-class among us; but I should say that these were chiefly the humorists, for whom women are said nowhere to have any warm liking, and who have generally with us come up through the newspapers, and have never lost the favor of the newspaper readers. They have become literary men, as it were, without the newspaper readers' knowing it; but those who have approached literature from another direction have won fame in it chiefly by grace of the women, who first read them; and then made their husbands and fathers read them. Perhaps, then, {{and as a matter of}} business, it would be well for a serious author, when he finds that he is not pleasing the women, and probably never will please them, to turn humorous author, and aim at the countenance of the men.
