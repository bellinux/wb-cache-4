5|$|To {{allow the}} Sa'iqa company to perform its landing, the Port Said Sector {{was to be}} {{supplied}} 24 assault dinghies. Only ten were received however, and on October 3, Second Army informed Khalid {{that there were no}} more dinghies available, and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> improvise. Khalid resorted to renting two fishing boats. Consequently, the Sa'iqa company was tasked with simply isolating the fort; no attack from the east would be carried out.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{infusion}} of cash, the banks of New York were reluctant to make the short-term loans they typically provided to facilitate daily stock trades. Prices on the exchange began to crash, owing {{to the lack of}} funds to finance purchases. At 1:30p.m. Thursday, October 24, Ransom Thomas, the president of the New York Stock Exchange, rushed to Morgan's offices to tell him <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> close the exchange early. Morgan was emphatic that an early close of the exchange would be catastrophic.|$|E
5|$|In June 2011 {{he signed}} a two-year deal with Micky Adams' Port Vale. The League Two club had to pay Hyde a small {{undisclosed}} fee, as the Conference North side secured his contract from their partnership with the Glenn Hoddle Academy. He missed {{the start of the}} 2011–12 season with a knee injury, and in November 2011 it was revealed <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> undergo surgery to correct the problem. He did not feature in matchday squads {{for the rest of the}} season, and was transfer listed in May 2012. The door to the first team remained open though, after Burge had an encouraging and injury-free pre-season.|$|E

5|$|RTÉ {{received}} a letter from Lee confirming his intentions to return after his leave of absence. The Sunday Tribune said on 14 February 2010 <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> wait for three months before returning to RTÉ. Exactly a year after leaving RTÉ, he returned to the broadcaster on 5 May 2010. He worked as an advisor on the RTÉ business desk. He presented Mind Your Business on RTÉ Radio 1 on Saturday Mornings as a summer replacement for The Business.|$|E
5|$|The {{backward}} {{condition of}} shipyards in the seceding states convinced Mallory <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> look abroad {{to obtain the}} vessels that he thought {{would be able to}} challenge the U.S. Navy. He selected two men as his primary representatives: James D. Bulloch and Lieutenant James H. North of the Confederate States Navy. North was a disappointment, but Bulloch proved {{to be one of the}} most effective agents for the Confederacy in Europe. He sought diligently and discreetly in England to acquire ships for the purposes of his government while working within or around the framework of the neutrality laws of the host nation.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{reaction}} of Branham's followers {{to his death}} was one of shocking disbelief. In the confusion immediately following his death, expectations developed that he would rise from the dead. His funeral was held on December 29, 1965, but his burial was delayed indefinitely. The press surmised {{that this was a}} result of Branham's expected resurrection. He was finally buried on April 11, 1966, the day after Easter Sunday, which was accepted reluctantly by his followers. Most believed <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> return to fulfill a vision that he had regarding future tent meetings.|$|E
60|$|If Ginger Kemp {{had been}} asked to enumerate his good qualities, it is not {{probable}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> drawn up a very lengthy list.

5|$|Young's {{claims that}} the new decipherments were merely a {{corroboration}} of his own method, meant that Champollion would have to publish more of his data to make clear {{the degree to which}} his own progress built on a systematicity that was not found in Young's work. He realized <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> make it apparent to all that his was a total system of decipherment, whereas Young had merely deciphered a few words. Over the next year he published a series of booklets about the Egyptian gods, including some decipherments of their names.|$|E
5|$|Hooper and Kim Henkel cowrote the {{screenplay}} and formed Vortex, Inc. with Henkel {{as president and}} Hooper as vice president. They asked Bill Parsley, a friend of Hooper, to provide funding. Parsley formed a company named MAB, Inc. through which he invested $60,000 in the production. In return, MAB owned 50% of the film and its profits. Production manager Ron Bozman told most of {{the cast and crew}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> defer part of their salaries until after it was sold to a distributor. Vortex made the idea more attractive by awarding them a share of its potential profits, ranging from 0.25 to 6%, similar to mortgage points. The cast and crew were not informed that Vortex owned only 50%, which meant their points were worth half of the assumed value.|$|E
5|$|In 1514, Las Casas was {{studying}} {{a passage in}} the book Ecclesiasticus (Sirach) 34:18–22 for a Pentecost sermon and pondering its meaning. Las Casas was finally convinced that all {{the actions of the}} Spanish in the New World had been illegal and that they constituted a great injustice. He made up his mind to give up his slaves and encomienda, and started to preach that other colonists should do the same. When his preaching met with resistance, he realized <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> go to Spain to fight there against the enslavement and abuse of the native people. Aided by Pedro de Córdoba and accompanied by Antonio de Montesinos, he left for Spain in September 1515, arriving in Seville in November.|$|E

5|$|Kenney assumed {{command of}} the Allied Air Forces on 4 August. Three days later, he instituted a {{sweeping}} reorganization of the Allied Air Forces. The Australian components were assigned to RAAF Command under Air Vice Marshal William Bostock, while the American components were consolidated into the reformed Fifth Air Force under Kenney's personal command. On paper, the organization followed the orthodox pattern, consisting of V Fighter Command under Brigadier General Paul Wurtsmith, V Bomber Command under Walker, and an Air Services Command under Major General Rush B. Lincoln. But Kenney realized <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> maintain his headquarters near MacArthur's GHQ, which moved to Brisbane on 20 July, while the fighting was {{thousands of miles away}} in New Guinea, with the Fifth Air Force's principal forward bases around Port Moresby. Moreover, Walker's headquarters was in Townsville, as heavy and medium bombers were based there and only staged through Port Moresby. Accordingly, Kenney appointed Whitehead as deputy Fifth Air Force commander, and commander of the Advanced Echelon (ADVON) in Port Moresby.|$|E
5|$|The {{pay-per-view}} {{opened with}} an in-ring segment featuring Raw General Manager William Regal and WWE Chairman Vince McMahon, who awarded the WWE Championship to Randy Orton due to John Cena's injury, causing Cena to vacate the title. McMahon informed Orton <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> defend the title that night; Triple H then {{came to the}} ring and challenged Orton to a match for the title, which Orton rejected. McMahon, however, relented to Triple H's request and made the match, which became the opening contest of the event. The first match, therefore, pitted WWE Champion Randy Orton defending his title against Triple H. During the match, Orton attempted an RKO, but the move was countered by Triple H into a Pedigree attempt, only for Orton to counter with a back body drop. The match ended shortly after when Orton placed Triple H in the ring turnbuckle and tried to tackle him; Triple H {{moved out of the}} way and rolled up his opponent for the pinfall. In result, Triple H became WWE Champion.|$|E
5|$|They {{considered}} {{creating an}} Allied plan {{to counter the}} danger, but Whiteley said <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> consult with the British command before this could be approved. Colonel G. S. Eyster from G-3 was then ordered to prepare an American plan, under the codename Operation Peppermint. Further briefings were given to Admiral Harold Stark, and Lieutenant Generals Carl Spaatz and John C. H. Lee, and Eisenhower also wrote to Lieutenant General Hastings Ismay, the Chief of Staff of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Winston Churchill to inform the British Chiefs of Staff, but no British or American commanders actually participating in Operation Overlord were informed. The British subsequently adopted a similar plan to Operation Peppermint, and SHAEF assumed responsibility for coordinating the British and American efforts. Scientific assistance {{was provided by the}} Cavendish Laboratory.|$|E

5|$|Mini Metro was {{developed}} by Dinosaur Polo Club, a two-man independent video game development studio based in New Zealand. It is the first game from the studio, {{which was founded in}} 2013 by brothers Peter and Robert Curry. They had previously worked at video game developer Sidhe, but left in 2006 to pursue a career in developing indie games. Following a series of abandoned projects, Peter Curry recognised <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> restrict the scope of his projects in order to complete them, and with hopes of releasing a finished product, the brothers set a number of constraints while proposing ideas for a prototype game. Minimising the amount of production art was a necessary restriction, as they had little experience in creating art assets. Likewise, they did not want the game's concept to rely on audio content, due to lack of skills in producing music. They also did not want to hand-build each level in the game. Imposing these constraints meant that they could discard most of their potential game ideas immediately, and led to them concentrating on concepts that involved procedurally generated levels and abstract visual styles.|$|E
5|$|Norman {{was born}} in Ulverston, Lancashire (now part of the {{administrative}} county of Cumbria), on 6 September 1883 to Thomas Birkett, a draper, and his wife Agnes, who died in 1884 of tuberculosis. He attended the Wesleyan primary school in Ulverston until 1894, {{when he moved to}} Barrow-in-Furness Grammar School. Although intelligent, Birkett was not noted as a particularly academic student and spent as much time on practical jokes as he did on his studies. He left school in 1898, starting work as an apprentice in one of the draper's shops owned by his father and beginning to preach. He was a popular local preacher on the local Methodist circuit, and, on deciding that he was unlikely to be a good draper, his father allowed him to leave the business in 1904 to become a minister under Charles Bedale. In 1905, Bedale suggested Birkett should go to Cambridge University to study history and theology. Birkett liked the idea, having previously conversed with A. C. Benson, the Master of Magdalene College, and applied to Emmanuel College, Cambridge. The college offered him a place, with the condition <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> pass an entrance examination and complete the responsions to be accepted into the university as a whole. He spent three months learning Latin and Greek and was accepted into the university in October 1907.|$|E
5|$|This {{time the}} mere {{presence}} of the Theban army was not enough to cow the opposition. Since time was passing and the Mantinean alliance showed no signs of capsizing, Epaminondas decided <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> break the stalemate. Hearing that a large Lacedaemonian force was marching to Mantinea, and that Sparta was practically undefended, he planned an audacious night-time march on Sparta itself. However, the Spartan king Archidamus was alerted to this move by an informant, probably a Cretan runner, and Epaminondas arrived to find the city well-defended.* Stylianou, Diodorus Siculus, 508510 Although he did attack the city, he seems to have drawn off relatively quickly on discovering that he had not, after all, surprised the Spartans. Furthermore, the Lacedaemonian and Mantinean troops which had been stationed at Mantinea had marched to Sparta {{during the course of the}} day, and dissuaded Epaminondas from attacking again. Now hoping that his adversaries had left Mantinea defenseless in their haste to protect Sparta, Epaminondas counter marched his troops back to his base at Tegea, and then dispatched his cavalry to Mantinea. However, a clash outside the walls of Mantinea with Athenian cavalry foiled this strategy as well.* Stylianou, Diodorus Siculus, 510512 Realising that the time allotted for the campaign was drawing to a close, and reasoning that if he departed without defeating the enemies of Tegea, Theban influence in the Peloponnesus would be destroyed, he decided to stake everything on a pitched battle.|$|E
