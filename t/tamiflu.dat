5|$|An example {{he gives}} of the {{difficulty}} of obtaining missing data from drug companies is that of oseltamivir (<b>Tamiflu),</b> manufactured by Roche to reduce the complications of bird flu. Governments spent billions of pounds stockpiling this, based in large part on a meta-analysis that was funded by the industry. Bad Pharma charts the efforts of independent researchers, particularly Tom Jefferson of the Cochrane Collaboration Respiratory Group, to gain access to information about the drug.|$|E
25|$|Both <b>Tamiflu</b> and Relenza are {{in short}} supply, and {{production}} capabilities are limited in the medium term. Some doctors say that co-administration of <b>Tamiflu</b> with probenecid could double supplies.|$|E
25|$|Stocks of <b>Tamiflu</b> and Relenza are 33 million.|$|E

For the moment, we cannot by any means count on a potential vaccine to prevent the spread of a contagious influenza virus, whose various precedents in the past 90 years have been highly pathogenic. However, it is crucial that countries in the Middle East invest and start developing their own research and technical facilities, where they can produce their own drugs when the time comes rather than wait to import expensive medicines from abroad at the risk of their population.|$|R
25|$|<b>Tamiflu</b> was {{originally}} discovered by Gilead Sciences and licensed to Roche for late-phase development and marketing.|$|E
25|$|On 2 July, {{the first}} case of oseltamivir-resistant virus in Asia was {{announced}} in Japan, in {{a woman who had}} been taking <b>Tamiflu</b> prophylactically.|$|E
25|$|Another {{death was}} {{confirmed}} on 24 August 2009. Death toll now increased to 69. The patient, a 38-year-old teacher, {{who was also}} obese, tested positive for H1N1 by a private clinic. <b>Tamiflu</b> was not administered but only gave her symptomatic treatment. Five days later, on 18 August, she {{was admitted to the}} hospital after suffering from breathing difficulties and cyanosis. She was referred to KL Hospital and <b>Tamiflu</b> was administered. However, the woman died on 19 August due to pneumonia with AVDS. One more death was confirmed on 25 August 2009. Confirmed by the Mortality Review Committee, the 3-year-old boy who had febrile convulsion and cough was hospitalised on 12 August. The boy was then transferred to ICU after his condition deteriorate and <b>tamiflu</b> was administered. He tested positive for the flu on 17 August. However, he died on the next day due to H1N1 encephalitis with Cerebral oedema and multiorgan failure.|$|E
25|$|On 3 July, {{a case of}} Tamiflu-resistant {{virus was}} discovered. The woman had not {{previously}} taken <b>Tamiflu,</b> so concern has been expressed {{that she may have}} contracted an already resistant virus from someone else.|$|E
25|$|There is no highly {{effective}} treatment for H5N1 flu, but oseltamivir (commercially marketed by Roche as <b>Tamiflu),</b> can sometimes inhibit the influenza virus from spreading inside the user's body. This drug {{has become a}} focus for some governments and organizations trying {{to prepare for a}} possible H5N1 pandemic. On April 20, 2006, Roche AG announced that a stockpile of three million treatment courses of <b>Tamiflu</b> are waiting at the disposal of the World Health Organization to be used in case of a flu pandemic; separately Roche donated two million courses to the WHO for use in developing nations that may be affected by such a pandemic but lack the ability to purchase large quantities of the drug.|$|E
25|$|On 3 July, {{a case of}} Tamiflu-resistant {{virus was}} {{discovered}} in a woman suffering from the flu. The woman had not previously taken <b>Tamiflu,</b> so concern has been expressed {{that she may have}} contracted an already resistant virus from someone else.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two groups}} of {{antiviral}} drugs available for the treatment and prophylaxis of influenza neuraminidase inhibitors such as Oseltamivir (trade name <b>Tamiflu)</b> and Zanamivir (trade name Relenza) as well as adamantanes such as amantadine and rimantadine. Due to {{the high rate of}} side effects and risk of antiviral resistance, use of adamantanes to fight influenza is limited.|$|E
25|$|Dell Children's Medical Center in Austin, Texas, erected two tents in its {{parking lot}} to handle {{emergency}} room visits, and hospitals around Colorado Springs recorded a 30 percent spike in flu visits. As pediatric cases were increasing, the Dept. of Health and Human Services released 300,000 courses of children's liquid <b>Tamiflu</b> from the national pandemic stockpile in late September, with the first batches sent to Texas and Colorado.|$|E
25|$|It was {{announced}} that on 11 September, {{the death of the}} 19-year-old man brought the total number of death cases to 74. The patient was brought to Gerik Hospital after flu symptoms persisted for 4 days. On 20 August, he was transferred to Ipoh Hospital where he was administered <b>Tamiflu.</b> Despite given antiviral drugs, he died on 23 August due to Acute Pulmonary Oedema with Underlying Influenza A(H1N1) infection.|$|E
25|$|The {{death of}} a 24-year-old woman brought {{the number of cases}} in Malaysia to 71. The patient, having fever, cough and {{headache}} was admitted to a private hospital in Kuantan on 10 August and received viral pneumonitis treatment. She was then referred to a government hospital after her condition worsened and placed in ICU. Her condition still deteriorate, albeit <b>Tamiflu</b> was administered. On 19 August, she was confirmed dead due to H1N1 secondary to ARDS.|$|E
25|$|South Australia has {{recorded}} 28 deaths, plus a 'clinical positive' where {{the test was}} inconclusive and, after swine-flu-like symptoms were reported, <b>Tamiflu</b> was administered, thus making a future positive confirmation unlikely. Adelaide high schools Eynesbury Senior College and Blackfriars Priory School closed for a week. The first confirmed death from swine flu in Australia was a 26-year-old Aboriginal man from Kiwirrkurra Community in the Western Desert of Western Australia who died in Royal Adelaide Hospital on 19 June.|$|E
25|$|The {{final stage}} in {{the life cycle of}} a virus is the release of {{completed}} viruses from the host cell, and this step has also been targeted by antiviral drug developers. Two drugs named zanamivir (Relenza) and oseltamivir (<b>Tamiflu)</b> that have been recently introduced to treat influenza prevent the release of viral particles by blocking a molecule named neuraminidase that is found on the surface of flu viruses, and also seems to be constant across a wide range of flu strains.|$|E
25|$|However, {{when the}} antigenicities of the seed strains and wild viruses do not match, {{vaccines}} fail {{to protect the}} vaccinees. In addition, {{even when they do}} match, escape mutants are often generated. Drugs available for the treatment of influenza include Amantadine and Rimantadine, which inhibit the uncoating of virions by interfering with M2, and Oseltamivir (marketed under the brand name <b>Tamiflu),</b> Zanamivir, and Peramivir, which inhibit the release of virions from infected cells by interfering with NA. However, escape mutants are often generated for the former drug and less frequently for the latter drug.|$|E
25|$|On 20 August 2009 one new {{death was}} confirmed. The victim was a 34-year-old {{woman who was}} in the 34th week of pregnancy. The patient was treated and {{admitted}} into a private hospital in Johor Baru on 8 Aug after developing fever and cough for a day. She was subsequently, referred and admitted to the intensive care unit of the Sultanah Aminah Hospital in Johor Baru for breathing difficulties five days later. <b>Tamiflu</b> was administered. However, she died on next day due to severe pneumonia and respiratory failure.|$|E
25|$|From January 1997 until being {{sworn in}} as the 21st Secretary of Defense in January 2001, Rumsfeld served as Chairman of Gilead Sciences, Inc. Gilead Sciences is the {{developer}} of <b>Tamiflu</b> (Oseltamivir), which {{is used in the}} treatment of bird flu. As a result, Rumsfeld's holdings in the company grew significantly when avian flu became a subject of popular anxiety during his later term as Secretary of Defense. Following standard practice, Rumsfeld recused himself from any decisions involving Gilead, and he directed the Pentagon's General Counsel to issue instructions outlining what he could and could not be involved in if there were an avian flu pandemic and the Pentagon had to respond.|$|E
25|$|If {{a person}} becomes sick with swine flu, {{antiviral}} drugs {{can make the}} illness milder and make the patient feel better faster. They may also prevent serious flu complications. For treatment, antiviral drugs work best if started soon after getting sick (within two days of symptoms). Beside antivirals, supportive care {{at home or in}} a hospital focuses on controlling fevers, relieving pain and maintaining fluid balance, as well as identifying and treating any secondary infections or other medical problems. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the use of oseltamivir (<b>Tamiflu)</b> or zanamivir (Relenza) for the treatment and/or prevention of infection with swine influenza viruses; however, the majority of people infected with the virus make a full recovery without requiring medical attention or antiviral drugs. The virus isolated in the 2009 outbreak have been found resistant to amantadine and rimantadine.|$|E
25|$|In Malaysia, health {{screenings}} {{were carried}} out on passengers traveling to and from Mexico via sea, air and land beginning 17 April. The Health Ministry's disease control division activated its operations room to monitor the situation and informed medical practitioners treating suspicious cases to inform the district health office immediately. Thermal scanners were installed at Kuala Lumpur International Airport. Screenings were imposed in Pengkalan Hulu, at the border with Thailand, in late April. Quarantine rooms were allocated in 28 hospitals and the country stockpiled more than 2 million doses of <b>Tamiflu,</b> as of May 2009. Schools were issued strict hygiene procedures on 16 May to contain any outbreak. On 15 May, the Health Ministry confirmed Malaysia's first case: a male student who had arrived via air from Newark. The first death was reported on 23 July. As of 11 August there were 2,253 confirmed cases. As of 12 August {{the total number of}} deaths in Malaysia stood at 44.|$|E
25|$|According to the Malaysian Ministry of Health, {{headed by}} Liow Tiong Lai, health {{screenings}} {{were carried out}} on passengers travelling to and from Mexico via sea, air and land beginning 17 April 2009. The Health Ministry's disease control division has activated its operations room to monitor the swine flu situation and informed medical practitioners who are treating cases with symptoms of influenza-like illness or severe pneumonia and persons who had visited Mexico, California or Texas to inform the district health office immediately for preventive and control measures. As has several Asian countries, thermal scanners had been installed at entry points at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) following {{the start of the}} global alert on the flu. Screenings were imposed in Pengkalan Hulu, at the border with Thailand, in late April. Quarantine rooms had been allocated in 28 hospitals, and the country has stockpiled more than 2 million doses of <b>Tamiflu,</b> as of May 2009.|$|E
25|$|On 31 August, a 30-year-old Filipino housemaid {{died after}} {{contracting}} the H1N1 virus, becoming Bahrain's first confirmed {{death as a}} result of the virus. On 3 September, it was reported that a 24-year-old Bahraini man died after succumbing to the H1N1 virus, being the first Bahraini to die of the disease. He was pronounced dead at BDF Hospital and there were allegations that he had been earlier misdiagnosed by a private hospital. On 8 September, it was announced that patients with flu-like symptoms would be treated with <b>Tamiflu</b> nationwide, regardless of having a fever or not. It was also announced that a million doses of the swine flu vaccine were ordered. The Bahraini Ministry of Education had decided to postpone the opening of schools until October as a precaution, a decision that drew criticism from the World Health Organisation. In November 2009, the government stated that up to 1,346 cases of the H1N1 virus were confirmed in the country, along with 15,000 suspected cases of the virus.|$|E
25|$|The 2009 Swine Flu {{epidemic}} struck Mexico and {{was labeled}} a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The administration {{declared a state}} of emergency and acted firmly in giving open information to the world about the swine flu epidemic, and it acted with tough measures to contain its spread by shutting down many public services including schools. President Calderón appeared on television explaining the situation and demonstrating basic precautionary measures to take during the epidemic such as coughing into one's elbow rather than into the air. <b>Tamiflu</b> and vaccines were used in 2009 and in 2010 during flu season, and some deaths were undoubtedly prevented by the strong measures that were taken as well as due to a reduction in the spread and severity of the disease. Policies keeping people home and awareness of effective strategies may have helped prevent virulent forms of the virus from spreading as easily as minor forms that were harder to detect and identify. Criticism of Calderón's handling varied from early claims that his administration was not doing enough to later claims that the administration had exaggerated the measures that it had taken.|$|E
25|$|On 27 April, Bahrain's health {{ministry}} {{declared the}} country {{to be free from}} the flu, citing that pig farms do not exist in the country and that live pork is not imported into the country. On 28 April, Bahraini MPs from the Al Asalah Salafi party called for the prohibition of pork products in the country. On 30 April, Bahrain banned pork imports from the United States and Mexico where the bulk of its imports originate from, with the Ministry of Health stating that the country is taking extra precautions despite the World Health Organisation stating that the flu cannot be contracted via the consumption of pork. The Ministry announced the creation of isolation wards in the country's main hospitals and also recommended that people should avoid hugging and kissing, so as to avoid contact with infected individuals. Also on the same day, it was announced that passengers arriving through the Bahrain International Airport would be screened and would also send suspicious flu patients to isolation wards. It was also announced that pharmacies in the country were stockpiled with enough <b>Tamiflu</b> to cover 20% of the population. A special hotline was also set up.|$|E
25|$|Shelf {{life is not}} {{significantly}} studied during drug development, and drug manufacturers have economic and liability incentives to specify shorter shelf lives so that consumers are encouraged to discard and repurchase products. One major exception is the Shelf Life Extension Program (SLEP) of the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), which commissioned a major study of drug efficacy from the FDA starting in the mid-1980s. One criticism is that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) refused to issue guidelines based on SLEP research for normal marketing of pharmaceuticals even though the FDA performed the study. The SLEP and FDA signed a memorandum that scientific data could not be shared with the public, public health departments, other government agencies, and drug manufacturers. State and local programs {{are not permitted to}} participate. The failure to share data has caused foreign governments to refuse donations of expired medications. One exception occurred during the 2010 Swine Flu Epidemic when the FDA authorized expired <b>Tamiflu</b> based on SLEP Data. The SLEP discovered that drugs such as Cipro remained effective nine years after their shelf life, and, as a cost-saving measure, the US military routinely uses a wide range of SLEP tested products past their official shelf life if drugs have been stored properly.|$|E
500|$|The British House of Commons Public Accounts Committee {{produced}} {{a report in}} January 2014, after hearing evidence from Goldacre, Fiona Godlee, editor-in-chief of the British Medical Journal, and others, about the stockpiling of <b>Tamiflu</b> and the withholding of data about the drug by its manufacturer, Roche. The committee said it was [...] "surprised and concerned" [...] to learn that information from clinical trials is routinely withheld from doctors, and recommended that the Department of Health take {{steps to ensure that}} all clinical-trial data be made available for currently prescribed treatments.|$|E

2500|$|... 1 August: First death {{recorded}} {{at the main}} regional hospital of Brest. Number of cases crosses one thousand. France has finally ordered 94 millions vaccines doses (2 by person are necessary), {{there is also a}} stock of more than 30 million anti-virus care doses (<b>Tamiflu)</b> and around 1.7 billion masks.|$|E
2500|$|... 24 November: The H1N1 {{virus is}} the main {{circulating}} flu virus in France. The circulation of the virus accelerates: 22 persons had died in one week, from a total of 68 {{since the beginning of}} the pandemic. A first case of a mutation of the virus which is resistant to oseltamivir (<b>Tamiflu)</b> has been reported.|$|E
2500|$|In the U.S., on April 27, 2009, the FDA issued Emergency Use Authorizations to make {{available}} Relenza and <b>Tamiflu</b> antiviral drugs to treat the swine influenza virus in cases {{for which they are}} currently unapproved. The agency issued these EUAs to allow treatment of patients younger than the current approval allows and to allow the widespread distribution of the drugs, including by [...] volunteers.|$|E
2500|$|Animal and lab {{studies suggest}} that Relenza (zanamivir), {{which is in the}} same class of drugs as <b>Tamiflu,</b> may also be {{effective}} against H5N1. In a study performed on mice in 2000, [...] "zanamivir was shown to be efficacious in treating avian influenza viruses H9N2, H6N1, and H5N1 transmissible to mammals". In addition, mice studies suggest the combination of zanamivir, celecoxib and mesalazine looks promising producing a 50% survival rate compared to no survival in the placebo arm. While no one knows if zanamivir will be useful or not on a yet to exist pandemic strain of H5N1, it might be useful to stockpile zanamivir as well as oseltamivir {{in the event of an}} H5N1 influenza pandemic. Neither oseltamivir nor zanamivir can currently be manufactured in quantities that would be meaningful once efficient human transmission starts. In September, 2006, a WHO scientist announced that studies had confirmed cases of H5N1 strains resistant to <b>Tamiflu</b> and Amantadine. Tamiflu-resistant strains have also appeared in the EU, which remain sensitive to Relenza.|$|E
2500|$|Bioengineering is {{also seen}} as a {{promising}} technique for achieving green chemistry goals. A number of important process chemicals can be synthesized in engineered organisms, such as shikimate, a <b>Tamiflu</b> precursor which is fermented by Roche in bacteria. Click chemistry is often cited as a style of chemical synthesis {{that is consistent with}} the goals of green chemistry. [...] The concept of 'green pharmacy' has recently been articulated based on similar principles.|$|E
