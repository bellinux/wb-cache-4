Her inaugural success coincided with the {{commencement}} of the first clinical placement for the newest group of Enrolled Nurses who were presented with their Notre Dame clinical placement uniform shirt. For Cindy {{the completion of the}} course was proof students could succeed despite living away from the campus. Cindy lives in Kununurra, more than 1000 km from Broome, but travelled to the Broome Campus regularly to complete her on-campus study requirements. Support was also provided to her by staff outside the study blocks. Whilst on campus, Cindy stayed in the on-site accommodation and with the assistance and care of Notre Dame staff, and her own dedication, Cindy has now completed the course. To acknowledge Cindy’s achievements the School of Nursing at the Broome Campus held a Blessing Ceremony to wish her well on her journey. The ceremony also acknowledged the latest group of Enrolled Nurses set to embark on their first practical placement. During their placement these students will put their skills into practice in the Broome and Derby hospitals. Broome Campus nursing lecturer, Mrs Kay Stringer, said new ground had been broken in the Kimberley with the introduction of the Enrolled Nursing course. “I am proud to have been involved in this new initiative and in witnessing Cindy’s personal growth and achievement in her desire to be a qualified Enrolled Nurse. This has been a very rewarding experience for all concerned. ” Mrs Stringer said. “We wish Cindy well in her future endeavours. ” Media contact Mike Doyle 9192 066...|$|E
