5|$|Difficulties {{arise in}} tracing {{the history of}} design {{management}}. Even though design management as an expression is first mentioned in literature in 1964, earlier contributions created <b>the</b> <b>context</b> <b>in</b> which the expression could arise. Throughout its history, design management was influenced {{by a number of}} different disciplines: architecture, industrial design, management, software development, engineering; and movements such as system theory, design methodologies. It cannot be attributed directly to either design nor to management.|$|E

Different meanings may {{be attached to the}} term, depending on <b>the</b> <b>context.</b> <b>In</b> metallurgy, for example, a heavy metal may be defined on the basis of density, whereas in physics the distinguishing criterion might be atomic number, and a chemist would likely be more concerned with chemical behaviour.|$|E
5|$|A {{thorough}} stylistic {{analysis of}} the ornamentation of the monument, in particular of the figures within the circles of the Battle scene and the Scene of sacrifice reveal a surprising sensitivity to bronze {{on the part of}} Cairano, and considerable scope for reinterpretation and commingling of styles. This stemmed from a sensible response to <b>the</b> <b>context</b> <b>in</b> which the mausoleum was designed and implemented. Unprecedented in Brescia was the combination of bronze and stone, the former under the supervision of Bernardino delle Croci who certainly had a vast catalogue of references to ancient and contemporary works, all of which are cited in the major and minor rounds on the base. It is difficult to exclude Cairano from the influence of so much classicism, but the sole Scene of sacrifice attests to the sophistication of his chisel and the innovative combination of sculpture and bronzes around 1510, to which date much of the remaining lapidary apparatus can also be placed.|$|E

25|$|Function {{overloading}} allows {{programs to}} declare multiple functions {{having the same}} name but with different arguments (i.e. ad hoc polymorphism). The functions are distinguished by the number or types of their formal parameters.

25|$|Recently, {{aesthetic}} and literary modes of interpretation have developed, which focus on Revelation {{as a work}} of art and imagination, viewing the imagery as symbolic depictions of timeless truths and the victory of good over evil. Elisabeth Schüssler Fiorenza wrote Revelation: Vision of a Just World from the viewpoint of rhetoric. Accordingly, Revelation's meaning is partially determined by the way John goes about saying things, partially by <b>the</b> <b>context</b> <b>in</b> which readers receive the message and partially by its appeal to something beyond logic.|$|E
25|$|It is {{important}} to consider <b>the</b> <b>context</b> <b>in</b> which these terms appear in the stories since, as a writer of fiction, Tolkien's primary purpose is to engage and entertain the reader while not being tied to a set terminology the way a military historian must be. Tolkien sometimes adopts just that historian stance going into great detail about tactical movements, weapons and formations as he does in The Battles of the Fords of Isen, or Cirion and Eorl. He can apply the same attention to detail to the drill of a shield-wall formation as to the intricacies of family relationships of the Sackville-Baggins.|$|E
