25|$|In the UK and Europe, {{the years}} 1987 to 1989 {{were marked by}} a {{large-scale}} revival of many characteristics of the hippie movement. This later movement, composed mostly of people aged 18 to 25, adopted much of the original hippie philosophy of love, peace and freedom. The summer of 1988 {{became known as the}} Second Summer of Love. Although the music favored by this movement was modern electronic music, especially house music and acid house, one could often hear songs from the original hippie era in <b>the</b> <b>chill</b> out rooms at raves. In the UK, many of the well-known figures of this movement first lived communally in Stroud Green, an area of north London located in Finsbury Park. In 1995, The Sekhmet Hypothesis attempted to link both hippie and rave culture together in relation to transactional analysis, suggesting that rave culture was a social archetype based on the mood of friendly strength, compared to the gentle hippie archetype, based on friendly weakness. The later electronic dance genres known as goa trance and psychedelic trance and its related events and culture have important hippie legacies and neo hippie elements. The popular DJ of the genre Goa Gil, like other hippies from the 1960s, decided to leave the US and Western Europe to travel on the hippie trail and later developing psychedelic parties and music in the Indian island of Goa in which the goa and psytrance genres were born and exported around the world in the 1990s and 2000s.|$|E

500|$|Edge of Darkness {{continues}} to be well regarded to this day. When it was repeated on BBC2 in 1992, Sean Day-Lewis wrote in The Daily Telegraph, “Edge of Darkness is a masterpiece. It {{is one of those}} very rare television creations so rich in form and content that the spectator wishes there was some way of prolonging it indefinitely”. Andrew Lavender, writing in British Television Drama in the 1980s, has said that Edge of Darkness “captured the spirit of its age but went far beyond the drama of its time. [...] It pushed against expectations attaching to the thriller form, often transcending the limits of the genre”. Fred Inglis, in his analysis of the serial in Formations: 20th Century Media Studies, takes it “as {{one of the most remarkable}} works of art made for British television”. According to Lez Cooke, in British Television Drama: A History, “In a reactionary climate, when the possibilities for the production of 'social issue' drama were limited, Edge of Darkness proved that, by adapting to changed circumstances and adopting a serialised thriller format, it was still possible to produce ambitious and progressive television drama in Britain in the mid-1980s”, a view echoed by Sean Cubit in EcoMedia who notes that “the series neatly echoed <b>the</b> <b>chill</b> that descended on radical politics in the Thatcher years in the United Kingdom”. The television historian Andrew Pixley has described the series as “possibly the finest BBC drama ever made” and “one of the few television programmes where every element can be said to have worked to complete effect”; John Hartley, in Tele-ology: Studies in Television, called it [...] "the best police drama series ever made for television" [...] and said that [...] "its method of investigative drama can unravel some of the complexities of public life more truthfully than investigative journalism".|$|E
