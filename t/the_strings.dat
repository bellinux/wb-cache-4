5|$|Chordophones, {{which produce}} sound by {{vibrating}} {{one or more}} strings; they are sorted into according {{to the relationship between}} <b>the</b> <b>string(s)</b> and the sounding board or chamber. For example, if <b>the</b> <b>strings</b> are laid out parallel to the sounding board and there is no neck, the instrument is a zither whether it is plucked like an autoharp or struck with hammers like a piano. If the instrument has strings parallel to the sounding board or chamber and <b>the</b> <b>strings</b> extend past the board with a neck, then the instrument is a lute, whether the sound chamber is constructed of wood like a guitar or uses a membrane like a banjo.|$|E

50|$|A backward, reverse or release bend {{involves}} pressing <b>the</b> <b>string</b> to <b>the</b> fingerboard, pulling or {{pushing it}} up to stretch <b>the</b> <b>string</b> first, then striking <b>the</b> <b>string</b> and relaxing <b>the</b> <b>string</b> to normal position. This causes the note to go flat, the reverse direction of straight bend.|$|R
5|$|Frith {{recorded}} the album at David Vorhaus's Kaleidophon Studios in London on 11–13 and 15 July 1974, {{where he played}} a modified 1936 Gibson K-11. He added an extra pickup over <b>the</b> <b>strings</b> at the nut, enabling him to amplify sound {{from both sides of}} the fretted note. He then split the fretboard in two with a capo, effectively giving him two guitars, each amplified separately that he could play independently with each hand. To split the sounds further he attached alligator clips at various positions on <b>the</b> <b>strings.</b> The net result was a guitar with multiple sound sources that could be channelled to a mixer and distributed across the stereo soundscape.|$|E
5|$|The first {{recordings}} {{were made}} during the European leg of Garbage's Version 2.0 world tour. After listening to the orchestral demo, the band worked on the key and tempo. Garbage used a portable studio {{from a number of}} European cities to record material for Arnold, keeping in touch by phone as he produced the song's string arrangement in London. Since <b>the</b> <b>strings</b> carried the structure of the song, they had to be finalised and recorded before Manson could sing her parts. Arnold recorded <b>the</b> <b>strings</b> with a 60-piece orchestra in one day at London's Metropolis Studios.|$|E
5|$|The second aria is {{accompanied}} by <b>the</b> <b>strings</b> and the two oboes da caccia in unison as obbligato instruments, thus both arias are dominated by instruments with a relatively low range (oboes de caccia having a pitch below that of a normal oboe).|$|E
5000|$|Release {{the fingers}} and swing the i finger to <b>the</b> <b>string.</b> <b>The</b> finger swings on a hinge (the first knuckle) {{and goes to}} <b>the</b> <b>string.</b> <b>The</b> finger lands {{directly}} on the nail and flesh at the same time.

Further, the nail lands {{on the side of}} the nail, not flat on the nail, but at an angle to <b>the</b> <b>string.</b> <b>The</b> nail then crosses <b>the</b> <b>string</b> in exactly one point on <b>the</b> <b>string</b> and on <b>the</b> nail, avoiding the sound of [...] "wiping" [...] <b>the</b> <b>string</b> with <b>the</b> nail. Once the finger is on <b>the</b> <b>string,</b> landing on <b>the</b> nail, the finger pushes (not pulls), the tip joint releases, and a clean 'snap' occurs, without ticking or wiping sounds.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>string</b> can be plucked (or picked) at {{any point}} between the bridge and {{the point where the}} {{fretting}} hand is holding down <b>the</b> <b>string</b> on <b>the</b> fingerboard; different timbres (tones) are produced depending on where along <b>the</b> <b>string</b> it is plucked. When plucked closer to <b>the</b> bridge, <b>the</b> <b>string's</b> harmonics are more pronounced, giving a brighter tone. Closer to the middle of <b>the</b> <b>string,</b> these harmonics are less pronounced, giving a more mellow, darker tone.|$|R

5|$|After {{recording}} drums, {{bass and}} most of the guitars, the band, Giordano and Parker moved to Water Music in Hoboken, New Jersey. The rest of the guitars and the vocals, strings and cowbells were recorded there, and recording was complete by April. Giordano, Parker and Ted Young mixed the recordings, and Ted Jensen did the mastering; Mike Sapone contributed programming to the songs. Girl Next Door String Quartet provided <b>the</b> <b>strings,</b> arranged by conductor Ray Zu-Artez (who played piano). Neil Rubenstein of These Enzymes and Nick Torres of Northstar contributed vocals to some songs. In retrospect, Fred Mascherino considered the sessions rushed.|$|E
5|$|Eastwood {{composed}} Changelings jazz-influenced score. Featuring lilting {{guitars and}} strings, it remains largely low-key throughout. The introduction of brass instruments evokes film noir, {{playing to the}} film's setting in a city controlled by corrupt police. The theme shifts from piano to a full orchestra, and as the story develops, <b>the</b> <b>strings</b> become more imposing, with {{an increasing number of}} sustains and rises. Eastwood introduces voices reminiscent of those in a horror film score during the child murder flashbacks. The score was orchestrated and conducted by Lennie Niehaus. It was released on CD in North America on , 2008, through record label Varèse Sarabande.|$|E
5000|$|Consider {{the process}} of {{repeatedly}} flipping a fair coin until the sequence (heads, tails, heads) appears.

Although in reality, the coin flips cease after <b>the</b> <b>string</b> [...] "HTH" [...] is generated, {{the perspective of the}} absorbing Markov chain is that the process has transitioned into the absorbing state representing <b>the</b> <b>string</b> [...] "HTH" [...] and, therefore, cannot leave.|$|R
50|$|The end of <b>the</b> <b>string</b> that mounts to the instrument's tuning {{mechanism}} (the {{part of the}} instrument which can be turned to tighten or loosen the tension of <b>the</b> <b>string)</b> is usually plain. Depending on <b>the</b> instrument, <b>the</b> <b>string's</b> other, fixed end may have either a plain, loop, or ball end (a short brass cylinder) that attaches <b>the</b> <b>string</b> at <b>the</b> end opposite the {{tuning mechanism}}. When a ball or loop is used with a guitar, this ensures that <b>the</b> <b>string</b> stays fixed in {{the bridge of the}} guitar. When a ball or loop is used with a violin-family instrument, this keeps <b>the</b> <b>string</b> end fixed in the tailpiece. Fender Bullet strings have a larger cylinder for more stable tuning on guitars equipped with synchronized tremolo systems. Strings for some instruments may be wrapped with silk at the ends to protect <b>the</b> <b>string.</b> <b>The</b> color and pattern of the silk often identifies attributes of <b>the</b> <b>string,</b> such as manufacturer, size, intended pitch, etc.|$|R

Tubman once disguised herself with a bonnet and carried two live chickens to give the appearance of running errands. Suddenly finding herself walking toward a former owner in Dorchester County, she yanked <b>the</b> <b>strings</b> holding the birds' legs, and their agitation allowed her to avoid eye contact. Later she recognized a fellow train passenger as another former master; she snatched a nearby newspaper and pretended to read. Since Tubman was known to be illiterate, the man ignored her.|$|E
5|$|Herrmann {{used the}} lowered music budget to his {{advantage}} by writing for a string orchestra rather than a full symphonic ensemble, contrary to Hitchcock's request for a jazz score. He thought of the single tone color of the all-string soundtrack {{as a way of}} reflecting the black-and-white cinematography of the film. <b>The</b> <b>strings</b> play con sordini (muted) for all the music other than the shower scene, creating a darker and more intense effect. Film composer Fred Steiner, in an analysis of the score to Psycho, points out that string instruments gave Herrmann access to a wider range in tone, dynamics, and instrumental special effects than any other single instrumental group would have.|$|E
5|$|In July 1961, Sutcliffe {{decided to}} leave the group to {{continue}} painting. After being awarded a postgraduate scholarship he enrolled at Hochschule für bildende Künste Hamburg, where he studied under the tutelage of Eduardo Paolozzi. He briefly lent McCartney his bass until the latter could earn enough to buy a specially made smaller left-handed Höfner 500/1 bass guitar of his own in June 1961, but specifically asked McCartney (who is left-handed) not to change <b>the</b> <b>strings</b> around or restring the instrument, so McCartney had to play the bass as it was. In 1967, a photo of Sutcliffe was among those {{on the cover of the}} Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album (extreme left, in front of fellow artist Aubrey Beardsley).|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis study {{presents}} the theoretical modeling {{of the part}} - pedaling effect in the piano. Part  pedaling means a common use of the sustain pedal where the pedal is not fully depressed, but pressed somewhere between the two extremes. The model implies to consider the distributions of <b>the</b> <b>string</b> deflection and <b>the</b> <b>string</b> velocity along <b>the</b> <b>string</b> as functions created by the traveling nondispersive waves generated by the hammer impact and moving in both directions. The damper restricts the amplitude of <b>the</b> <b>string</b> deflection in <b>the</b> region of its position, and also suppresses the "up" velocity of <b>the</b> <b>string.</b> Such nonlinear model gives possibility to calculate the spectrograms of <b>the</b> <b>string</b> vibration tone, and to compare the numerical calculations with the measured example tones of <b>the</b> <b>string.</b> To obtain <b>the</b> appropriate decay rates of <b>the</b> <b>string</b> vibrations, <b>the</b> damping factor at one termination of <b>the</b> <b>string</b> is induced. <b>The</b> modeling confirms that in the bass range the nonlinear amplitude limitation causes energy transfer from the lower partials to higher partials, which can excite missing modes during the damper-string interaction...|$|R
50|$|A {{line level}} is a level {{designed}} {{to hang on}} a builder's <b>string</b> line. <b>The</b> body of the level incorporates small hooks {{to allow it to}} attach and hang from <b>the</b> <b>string</b> line. <b>The</b> body is lightweight, so as not to weigh down <b>the</b> <b>string</b> line, it is also small in size as <b>the</b> <b>string</b> line in effect becomes the body; when the level is hung in the center of <b>the</b> <b>string,</b> each leg of <b>the</b> <b>string</b> line extends <b>the</b> level's plane.|$|R
50|$|Lightly {{touching}} <b>the</b> <b>string</b> with a fingertip at a harmonic node while bowing {{close to}} the bridge can create harmonics.

A responsive instrument will provide numerous possible harmonic nodes along the length of <b>the</b> <b>string.</b>|$|R
5|$|Instrumentally, the {{two worlds}} {{represented}} within the opera are distinctively portrayed. The pastoral world of the fields of Thrace is represented by <b>the</b> <b>strings,</b> harpsichords, harp, organs, recorders and chitarroni. The remaining instruments, mainly brass, {{are associated with the}} Underworld, though there is not an absolute distinction; strings appear on several occasions in the Hades scenes. Within this general ordering, specific instruments or combinations are used to accompany some of the main characters—Orpheus by harp and organ, shepherds by harpsichord and chitarrone, the Underworld gods by trombones and regal. All of these musical distinctions and characterisations were in accordance with the longstanding traditions of the Renaissance orchestra, of which the large L'Orfeo ensemble is typical.|$|E
5|$|Moman {{moved away}} from the usual Presley pop {{recordings}} aimed at an established audience. A developer of the Stax Records sound, he incorporated a Memphis sound integrating soul, country, gospel and rural and electric blues. Many arrangements lean heavily on the rhythm section, with lesser contributions from strings, brass and woodwinds. Arrangers Green Spreen and Mike Leech changed Presley's image on the tracks with the addition of violas, cellos and French horns. The arrangers intended to blend the tracks for a distinctive sound; <b>the</b> <b>strings</b> are used in counterpoint, rising when the track fades and vice versa. The violas play the same lines as the French horns, with cello used for darker tones. Syncopation was incorporated by bowing.|$|E
5|$|Nine {{hours after}} this all-night session, the band {{returned}} to Abbey Road {{to carry out}} overdubs. Harrison added a second vocal and another acoustic guitar part, the latter consisting of riffs that recall {{the sound of a}} sitar, due to <b>the</b> <b>strings</b> buzzing against the frets. During the same session, McCartney overdubbed bass guitar onto the track. The recording was finished on 9 October, {{with the addition of a}} brief harmony vocal from McCartney and piano, over the middle eight, played by Chris Thomas.|$|E
50|$|Theoretically, {{vibration}} {{over half}} <b>the</b> <b>string's</b> length will be twice as fast, and vibration over one-third of <b>the</b> <b>string</b> will be {{three times as}} fast, as the fundamental vibration over <b>the</b> whole <b>string's</b> length.

50|$|In a {{phenomenon}} called sympathetic vibration, a string seems to vibrate by itself. This happens when sound waves strike <b>the</b> <b>string</b> at a frequency close to <b>the</b> <b>string's</b> fundamental pitch {{or one of}} its overtones. <b>The</b> <b>string</b> is connected to this similar sound wave through the air, which picks up the vibrations of the sound waves at the same frequency, and in turn causes <b>the</b> <b>string</b> to vibrate on its own.
