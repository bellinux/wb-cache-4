5|$|Benjamin Ryan Tillman (August 11, 1847– July 3, 1918) was a {{politician}} of the Democratic Party {{who served as}} Governor of South Carolina from 1890 to 1894, and a United States Senator from 1895 {{until his death in}} 1918. A white supremacist who opposed civil rights for blacks, Tillman led a paramilitary group of Red Shirts during South Carolina's violent 1876 election. On the floor of the U.S. Senate, he frequently ridiculed blacks, and boasted of having helped to kill them during <b>that</b> <b>campaign.</b>|$|E
5|$|Etty {{retained}} close {{connections with}} York throughout his life.

5|$|In later years, Wilberforce {{supported}} {{the campaign for}} the complete abolition of slavery, and continued his involvement after 1826, when he resigned from Parliament because of his failing health. <b>That</b> <b>campaign</b> led to the Slavery Abolition Act 1833, which abolished slavery {{in most of the}} British Empire; Wilberforce died just three days after hearing that the passage of the Act through Parliament was assured. He was buried in Westminster Abbey, close to his friend William Pitt.|$|E
5|$|The French {{invasion}} of Russia, where poor traction conditions for ill-shod horses {{made it difficult}} for supply wagons to keep up with troops. <b>That</b> <b>campaign</b> was also strongly affected by cold, whereby the retreating army reached Neman River in December 1812 with only 10,000 of the 420,000 that had set out to invade Russia in June of the same year.|$|E
5|$|The {{campaign}} {{plays out}} through 26 missions, with story scenes that tie the plot together occurring between {{and during the}} battles. In addition, 38 training missions are unlocked as the missions are completed. The training missions are more challenging, entirely optional, and can be played separately from the campaign. One new feature in Days of Ruin is <b>that</b> <b>campaign</b> missions can now be played individually as the player completes them.

5|$|Born in Konstanz, Mayer, {{volunteered for}} {{military}} service in the Luftwaffe (air force) of Nazi Germany in 1937. He was posted to Jagdgeschwader 2 (fighter wing, JG2) in 1939. He fought in the Battle of France and claimed his first aerial victory in <b>that</b> <b>campaign</b> on 13 June 1940. Mayer was appointed squadron leader of the 7th squadron of JG2 in June 1941. Two months later, following his 21st aerial victory, he received the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross on 1 August 1941. In November 1942, Mayer was appointed commander of the III. Gruppe (3rd group) of JG2.|$|E
5|$|Immediately after <b>that</b> <b>campaign,</b> Simeon {{sought to}} punish the Serbian ruler Petar Gojniković who had {{attempted}} to betray him by concluding an alliance with the Byzantines. Simeon sent an army led by two of his commanders, Theodore Sigrica and Marmais, to Serbia. The two managed to persuade Petar to attend a personal meeting, during which he was enchained and carried off to Bulgaria, where he died in a dungeon. Simeon put Pavle Branović, prior to that an exile in Bulgaria, on the Serbian throne, thus restoring the Bulgarian influence in Serbia for a while.|$|E
5|$|In the end, the Baedeker raids {{failed to}} cause any {{reduction}} in the RAF's raids over Germany. Civilian losses were considerable, with 1,637 killed, 1,760 injured, and 50,000 homes destroyed or damaged. In comparison to The Blitz this was relatively minor; 30,000 civilians were killed and 50,000 injured {{by the end of}} <b>that</b> <b>campaign.</b> Luftwaffe losses were 40 bombers and 150 aircrew. Although the night fighters were not particularly successful, accounting for perhaps 22 aircraft from late April to the end of June, their shortcomings were on the way to being addressed.|$|E

5|$|Nixon {{retained}} Chotiner as {{a consultant}} to his first congressional campaign in 1946. In an era when the perceived threat of communism was a major domestic issue, Chotiner advised the future president to link his liberal opponent, Representative Jerry Voorhis, to a political organization which was believed to be communist-dominated. Nixon was elected, and hired Chotiner to run his 1950 Senate campaign against Representative Helen Gahagan Douglas. Chotiner used a similar strategy in <b>that</b> <b>campaign,</b> stressing Douglas' liberal voting record and printing the accusations on pink paper to hint at communist sympathy. Congressman Nixon easily defeated Douglas, and Chotiner next managed Nixon's 1952 vice presidential campaign and counseled Nixon through allegations of antisemitism and revelations that there were privately run funds to pay Nixon's political expenses—revelations that the candidate decisively overcame with his televised Checkers speech.|$|E
5|$|Scott's army moved farther inland from Puebla unopposed and {{attacked}} Mexico City from the south. During <b>that</b> <b>campaign</b> in 1847, Hancock first encountered battle at Contreras and Churubusco. He was appointed a brevet first lieutenant for gallant and meritorious service in those actions. Hancock {{was wounded in}} the knee at Churubusco and developed a fever. Although he was well enough to join his regiment at Molino del Rey, fever kept Hancock from participating in the final breakthrough to Mexico City, something he would regret {{for the rest of his}} life. After the final victory, Hancock remained in Mexico with the 6th Infantry until the treaty of peace was signed in 1848.|$|E
5|$|Sherman's {{military}} {{record in}} 1862–63 was mixed. In December 1862, forces {{under his command}} suffered a severe repulse at the Battle of Chickasaw Bayou, just north of Vicksburg, Mississippi. Soon after, his XV Corps was ordered to join Maj. Gen. John A. McClernand in his successful assault on Arkansas Post, generally regarded as a politically motivated distraction from the effort to capture Vicksburg. Before the Vicksburg Campaign {{in the spring of}} 1863, Sherman expressed serious reservations about the wisdom of Grant's unorthodox strategy, but he went on to perform well in <b>that</b> <b>campaign</b> under Grant's supervision.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Marengo was {{the victory}} that sealed {{the success of}} Bonaparte's Italian {{campaign}} of 1800 and is best understood {{in the context of}} <b>that</b> <b>campaign.</b> By a daring crossing of the Alps with his Army of the Reserve (officially commanded by Louis Alexandre Berthier) in mid-May 1800 almost before the passes were open, Bonaparte (who crossed on a mule) had threatened Melas's lines of communications in northern Italy. The French army then seized Milan on 2 June, followed by Pavia, Piacenza and Stradella, Lombardy, cutting the main Austrian supply route eastward along the south bank of the Po river. Bonaparte hoped that Melas's preoccupation with the Siege of Genoa, held by General André Masséna, would prevent the Austrians from responding to his offensive. However, Genoa surrendered on 4 June, freeing a large number of Austrians for operations against the French.|$|E
5|$|With the Confederacy defeated, South Carolina {{ratified}} a {{new constitution}} in 1865 that recognized the end of slavery, but basically left the pre-war elites in charge. African-American freedmen, who were the majority of South Carolina's population, were given no vote, and their new freedom was soon restricted by Black Codes that limited their civil rights and required black farm laborers to bind themselves with annual labor contracts. Congress was dissatisfied with this minimal change and required {{a new constitution}}al convention and elections with universal male suffrage. As African Americans generally favored the Republican Party at the time, that party controlled the biracial state legislature beginning with the 1868 elections. <b>That</b> <b>campaign</b> was marked by violence—19 Republican and Union League activists were killed in South Carolina's 3rd congressional district alone.|$|E
5|$|According to Matteo Villani, Louis {{launched}} an expedition against the Golden Horde {{at the head}} of an army of 200,000 horsemen in April 1354. The young Tatar ruler, whom historian Iván Bertényi identified as Jani Beg, did not want to wage war against Hungary and agreed to sign a peace treaty. Although no other primary source mentioned <b>that</b> <b>campaign</b> and treaty, the Tatars made no plundering raids in Transylvania after 1354, which suggests that Villani's report is reliable. In the same year, Louis invaded Serbia, forcing Stefan Dušan to withdraw from the region along the river Sava. Under duress, Dušan initiated negotiations with the Holy See for acknowledgement of the popes' primacy. The following year, Louis sent reinforcements to Casimir III to fight against the Lithuanians, and Hungarian troops supported Albert II, Duke of Austria, against Zürich. The Venetian delegates offered Louis 6–7,000 golden ducats as a compensation for Dalmatia, but Louis refused to give up his plan to reconquer the province. He signed an alliance with Albert II of Austria and Nicolaus of Luxemburg, Patriarch of Aquileia, against Venice. Upon his order, Croatian lords besieged and captured Klis, a Dalmatian fortress that Stefan Dušan's sister, Jelena, had inherited from her husband, Mladen Šubić.|$|E

5|$|Although Suffolk was {{receiving}} minimal financial {{benefit from the}} new regime, he still took conspicuous part in all the major state ceremonies. Such events ranged from the 1465 royal wedding to tournaments such as that between Lord Scales and the Bastard of Burgundy in 1467. By this time the king's relations with the powerful Earl of Warwick had soured {{to the point that}} the discontented earl was fomenting rebellion against Edward. Suffolk remained loyal to his brother-in-law, and appears to have taken no part in the Neville/Woodville feud that occupied much of the second half of the decade. Suffolk particularly helped the king crush the Lincolnshire Rebellion in 1469 and participated at the Battle of Empingham early the following year. Edward was subsequently forced into exile however, and Suffolk appears not to have been trusted by the resurgent Lancastrian government, possibly because he refused to come to London to meet the chancellor, even if he appears to have come rapidly to terms with the new government personally. His wife kept in touch with her exiled brothers in Burgundy. When Edward IV returned to England in March 1471, de la Pole joined him on <b>that</b> <b>campaign,</b> in which Edward regained his throne. Thus Suffolk also took part in the battles of Barnet (at which Warwick was killed) and Tewkesbury (at which the House of York finally crushed the remnants of the Lancastrian army).|$|E
5|$|In 1936, the British Secret Intelligence Service Chief of Air Intelligence, Wing Commander F. W. Winterbotham, {{developed}} {{aerial photograph}} techniques {{in collaboration with}} the French. The task was to gather a record of German targets. By the summer, 1939, RAF Bomber Command's No. 2 Group RAF was carrying out this role. However, various problems with standard equipment {{led to the formation of}} specialist formations for this duty. One of the first squadrons to act as a PR (Photographic reconnaissance) unit was No. 212 Squadron RAF, which saw service in the campaigns in Western Europe, in May and June 1940 under Fighter Command's control. However, at the end of <b>that</b> <b>campaign,</b> the Admiralty pressed its case for the need for coastal and sea reconnaissance. With operations now over, owing to the evacuation of northern Europe by the Allies, these reconnaissance operations were given to Coastal Command on 18 June 1940. This included the Interpretation Unit, which analysed photographic evidence. The organisation was called the PRU (Photographic Reconnaissance Unit). It was administered by No. 16 Group RAF, but under the operational control of Coastal Command.|$|E
5|$|Later {{that year}} Czarniecki {{received}} territories from the king, {{along with the}} office of Crown oboźny. In 1653 he led a unit to Ukraine, ransacking much of the Cossack-held lands, although the attrition among the troops was high. During <b>that</b> <b>campaign</b> Czarniecki was wounded at Monastyryska. He continued his suppression campaign in 1654, and the following January took part in the battle of Okhmativ. In May 1655 he was called from Ukraine to Warsaw, as the king John Casimir Vasa, respected his experience and requested his presence at a new war council, convened to discuss the looming thread of the war with Sweden. At that time his reputation was significant; Sejm often passed resolutions applauding him for his efforts to reclaim Ukraine, and he was even held in much consideration by the Ottomans, then temporarily allied with the Commonwealth. On 14 May 1655 he received the office of the castellan of Kiev, a position that made him a member of the Senate of Poland.|$|E
