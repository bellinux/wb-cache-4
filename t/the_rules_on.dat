5|$|After the referendum, {{the ballot}} for Quebec {{elections}} was redesigned {{to reduce the}} size of the space where voters could indicate their choice and <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> <b>on</b> allowable markings were relaxed, so that Deputy Returning Officers would have fewer grounds for rejecting ballots. The Quebec government also changed the Electoral Act so that voters would need to show a Canadian passport, Quebec drivers' licence or Quebec provincial health care card at the polling station for identification purposes in future elections.|$|E

He was accused by the Scottish Football Association of placing 44 bets on matches between 1 July and 15 September 2016.

5|$|Virdon's career {{managerial}} record, {{over all}} {{or parts of}} 13 seasons, was 995–921 (.519). He also managed {{in the minor leagues}} for the Cardinals and the Astros. In June 2012, the Pirates attempted to add Virdon and Mazeroski to their coaching staff, but were rebuffed by MLB for violating <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> <b>on</b> uniformed coaching staffs after one game. Virdon continues to serve as a special outfield instructor for the Pirates during spring training.|$|E

5|$|Allowing the enpassant capture, {{together}} {{with the introduction of}} the two-square first move for pawns, {{was one of the last}} major rule changes in European chess, and occurred between 1200 and 1600. Other relatively recent rule changes were castling, the unlimited range for queens and bishops (Spanish master Ruy López de Segura gives the rule in his 1561 book Libro de la invencion liberal y arte del juego del axedrez) and a change to <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> <b>on</b> pawn promotion. In most places the en passant rule was adopted at the same time as allowing the pawn to move two squares on its first move, but it was not universally accepted until the Italian rules were changed in 1880.|$|E
5|$|Innocent {{gave some}} dispensations as the crisis progressed. Monastic {{communities}} {{were allowed to}} celebrate Mass in private from 1209 onwards, and late in 1212 the Holy Viaticum for the dying was authorised. <b>The</b> <b>rules</b> <b>on</b> burials and lay access to churches {{appear to have been}} steadily circumvented, at least unofficially. Although the interdict was a burden to much of the population, it did not result in rebellion against John. By 1213, though, John was increasingly worried about the threat of French invasion. Some contemporary chroniclers suggested that in January Philip II of France had been charged with deposing John on behalf of the papacy, although it appears that Innocent merely prepared secret letters in case Innocent needed to claim the credit if Philip did successfully invade England.|$|E
5|$|Smoking {{legislation}} in North Korea has tightened in recent years, {{although it is}} still relatively lax and has not had any really meaningful effect on curtailing smoking rates. <b>The</b> <b>rules</b> <b>on</b> where people can or cannot smoke are complex, with smoking prohibited on sidewalks, ferries, airplanes and at stations, in health-care and educational facilities, kindergartens and nurseries, shops, theaters, cinemas, culture halls and conference rooms, historic and battle sites, and hotel lobbies. However, smoking is not prohibited in either private or work vehicles or on-board trains, at bus stops, near entrances to buildings, in universities, government offices, workplaces, restaurants, cafes, bars, or nightclubs.|$|E

The bill {{moved back to the}} House but was indefinitely postponed by a voice vote initiated by House Speaker Calvin Say, requiring a vote of two-thirds of Representatives to be taken up again in 2010, and was considered dead. In April 2010, {{on the last day of}} the legislative session, the House suspended <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> <b>on</b> the Senate bill and passed it with a majority, sending the bill to Governor Linda Lingle, who vetoed it in July 2010.|$|E
5|$|The {{laws are}} {{concerned}} with setting and enforcing the penalties for transgressions {{at all levels of}} society; the severity of the fine depended on the social rank of the victim. The king had a financial interest in enforcement, for part of the fines would come to him in many cases, but the king also was responsible for law and order, and avoiding blood feuds by enforcing <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> <b>on</b> compensation for injury was part of the way the king maintained control. Æthelberht's laws are mentioned by Alfred the Great, who compiled his own laws, making use of the prior codes created by Æthelberht, {{as well as those of}} Offa of Mercia and Ine of Wessex.|$|E
5|$|After {{participating}} in Canada's Olympic summer camp before the season, Iginla again set new personal highs in 2001–02 when he registered 52goals and 96points. This season elevated Iginla to superstar status. He earned the Art Ross and Maurice Richard trophies as the NHL's leading point and goal scorer, respectively. He was also awarded the Lester B. Pearson Award as the league's {{most valuable player}} as voted by his peers, and was a nominee for both the Hart Memorial Trophy and the King Clancy Memorial Trophy. The Hart Trophy voting proved to be controversial: Iginla tied Canadiens goaltender José Théodore in voting points, but received fewer first place votes than Théodore. However, one voter, rumoured to be from Quebec—Théodore and the Canadiens' home province—inexplicably left Iginla off his ballot. As {{a result of the}} controversy that followed, the Professional Hockey Writers Association changed <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> <b>on</b> how its members voted for the award to prevent a recurrence.|$|E
