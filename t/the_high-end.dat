Estimates of the total Manche Ch'ol population in the mid-17th century vary from 10,000 to 30,000, with prominent 20th-century Mayanist J. Eric S. Thompson preferring the lower figure as opposed to <b>the</b> <b>high-end</b> estimates by 17th-century chroniclers. The Dominican penetration of Mopan territory alarmed the Itza, who started to harass the Manche Ch'ol, driving them away from the mission towns.|$|E
