25|$|The first {{dedicated}} war galleys {{fitted with}} rams were built with a {{mortise and tenon}} technique, a so-called shell-first method. In this, the planking of the hull {{was strong enough to}} hold the ship together structurally, and was also watertight without the need for caulking. Hulls had sharp bottoms without keelsons in order to support the structure and were reinforced by transverse framing secured with dowels with nails driven through them. To prevent the hull from hogging there was a hypozoma, a <b>thick</b> <b>cable</b> that connected bow with stern. It was kept taut to add strength to the construction along its length, but its exact design or the method of tightening is not known. The ram, the primary weapon of ancient galleys from around the 8th to the 4th century, was not attached directly on the hull but to a structure extending from it. This way the ram could twist off if got stuck after ramming rather than breaking the integrity of the hull. The ram fitting consisted of a massive, projecting timber and the ram itself was a thick bronze casting with horizontal blades that could weigh from 400kg up to 2 tonnes.|$|E
60|$|After {{a minute}} or two he rose, unfastened the line from his waist, and began to haul it ashore. To {{the other end of the}} small line the men in the ship {{attached}} a <b>thick</b> <b>cable,</b> the end of which was soon pulled up, and made fast to a large rock.|$|E
60|$|He {{was soon}} on board, and saw {{at a glance}} what was the matter. The crew of the brig, being benumbed by long exposure, had not {{strength}} to tie the heavy cable round the mast. This the Coastguardsman did for them at once, and, as he did so, observed {{that there were two}} little girls among the crew. Then he gave a well-understood signal with a ship's lantern to the men on shore, who fastened a slung lifebuoy to their whip line, hung it by a block to the <b>thick</b> <b>cable,</b> and ran it quickly out to the wreck.|$|E
50|$|Increasing the {{diameter}} of a copper cable increases its electrical energy efficiency (see: Copper wire and <b>cable).</b> <b>Thicker</b> <b>cables</b> reduce resistive (I2R) loss, which affects lifetime profitability of PV system investments. Complex cost evaluations, factoring extra costs for materials, the amount of solar radiation directed towards solar modules per year (accounting for diurnal and seasonal variations, subsidies, tariffs, payback periods, etc.) are necessary to determine whether higher initial investments for <b>thicker</b> <b>cables</b> are justified.|$|R
50|$|Litz wire has {{a higher}} {{impedance}} per unit cross-sectional area but litz wires can be used at <b>thicker</b> <b>cable</b> sizes, hence reducing or maintaining cable impedance at higher frequencies.|$|R
50|$|Currents {{stronger}} than 60A are rarely used, since 60A current already requires 8 AWG or even <b>thicker</b> <b>cables.</b> Cables are dimensioned to prevent 5% or higher voltage drop. Larger voltage drop {{could lead to}} excessive power losses and increased danger of fire.|$|R
60|$|By {{means of}} the endless fall our hero now hauled a heavy rope or cable from the wreck, {{the end of which}} he {{fastened}} round a large boulder. This rope, being hauled taut, remained suspended between the wreck and the cliffs some feet above the sea. Previous to fixing it a large block had been run upon it, and to this block was suspended one of those circular cork life-preservers which one usually sees attached to the bulwarks of ships. It was made into a sort of bag by means of a piece of canvas. The endless fall was then attached to this bag so that it could travel with its block backwards and forwards on the <b>thick</b> <b>cable.</b>|$|E
60|$|Her figure looked {{singularly}} {{tall and}} imposing {{as she stood}} in her long white nightgown, a <b>thick</b> <b>cable</b> of twisted dark hair hanging straight down {{her back to her}} waist. The kindly dimness of the weak candle abstracted from her form and features the little blemishes which sunlight might have revealed--the stubble scratches upon her wrists, and the weariness of her eyes--her high enthusiasm having a transfiguring effect upon the face which had been her undoing, showing it as a thing of immaculate beauty, with a touch of dignity which was almost regal. The little ones kneeling round, their sleepy eyes blinking and red, awaited her preparations full of a suspended wonder which their physical heaviness at that hour would not allow to become active.|$|E
6000|$|Again {{the light}} burst forth, and the rocket sprang {{out in the}} teeth of the gale. It fell beyond the brig, and the line caught in the rigging! The wrecked crew seemed to {{understand}} what was required of them, for they immediately began to haul on the rocket-line. To the shore-end of it was fastened, by the men on the rocks, a block or pulley with a double or endless line, called a [...] "whip," [...] through it. When the men in the brig had hauled this block on board they fastened it to the stump of the main mast. Then the rescuers on shore tied a <b>thick</b> <b>cable</b> or hawser to their double line and ran it out to the wreck, but when this thick rope reached the crew, they did not seem {{to know what to do}} with it, for it was not hauled upon, but continued to hang loose.|$|E
50|$|At {{the base}} of the TV tower, follow the huge, <b>thick</b> <b>cables</b> down to the {{transmitter}} building. Leading up the mountain from the valley floor, is a still-operating cable car that is used to ferry broadcasting equipment to the building. The cable car also ferries engineers during bad weather, for mandatory transmitter work.|$|R
50|$|In 2008 a {{new version}} of the tikit {{replaced}} the pair of brake cables with a single, and much <b>thicker,</b> <b>cable,</b> plus other improvements to the handlebar stem and to the rear seat pin assembly. The resulting bike is much stiffer. Bike Friday provides an upgrade path for 2007 tikits which provides some of the 2008 features, notably the new cable assembly.|$|R
40|$|Electrical, {{mechanical}} and magnetic phenomena do matter in audio. Some visitors of my pages certainly do remember the loudspeaker cable debate which started around 1978. The first experiments were {{done by a}} few freaks who would buy the <b>thick</b> <b>cables</b> used to connect car batteries, then isolate them and connect them between amplifier and luidspaker cabinet, at best directly to the circuit board of the power amp and the loudspeaker filter, eliminating bananas, sockets and binding posts. They reported abou...|$|R

50|$|Around 1655, the wharfs of the Admiralty of Amsterdam {{were moved}} to the islands of Kattenburg and Oostenburg. The Admiraliteitslijnbaan was {{constructed}} on Oostenburg in 1660 as a ropewalk and warehouse for the ships of the Admiralty. The area stretched some 500 meters and was surrounded by thick stone walls, as the tar pots and tarred wood used in the ropewalk were a serious fire hazard. There were two separate ropewalks: a large ropewalk where <b>thick</b> <b>cables</b> where made and a smaller one for ropework and other activities. The attics were used for storage.|$|R
50|$|Additional attractions and {{features}} of Idora Park included Kooky Castle, a haunted house; Laffin Lena's, a funhouse (which featured a hall of mirrors); a small passenger train which traveled through the park; and a spinning ride with four bus-sized stainless steel open-air rocket ships which were attached by <b>thick</b> <b>cables.</b> The {{base of the}} rocket ride housed a french fry stand {{which was one of}} the most popular and famous items sold at Idora Park. Midway games, including a shooting gallery, were present in several locations of the park.|$|R
50|$|Climbing tree stands have {{a couple}} of {{different}} styles to connect to the tree. The part that wraps around the tree can be made from a <b>thick</b> <b>cable</b> or boomerang shaped piece of metal. The part that wraps around the tree is fastened to the stand with a bolt or pin for easy adjustment for different tree sizes.|$|E
50|$|A telco cable, {{also known}} as a Telecom cable or Amphenol cable, is a <b>thick</b> <b>cable</b> used for {{connecting}} multiple voice or data lines for LANs or telecommunications. The ends use 25 pairs of polarized pins (50 pins total). This cable handles up to 25 data channels or phone lines. The name Amphenol comes from the company that first manufactured it.|$|E
50|$|Remotely {{operated}} vehicles (ROVs) repair {{offshore oil}} platforms and attach cables to sunken ships to hoist them. Such {{remotely operated vehicles}} are attached by a tether (a <b>thick</b> <b>cable</b> providing power and communications) to a control center on a ship. Operators on the ship see video images sent back from the robot and may control its propellers and manipulator arm. The wreck of the Titanic was explored by such a vehicle, {{as well as by}} a manned vessel.|$|E
5000|$|The {{airborne}} {{side of the}} Gee Mk. II system {{consisted of}} two portions, the R1355 radio receiver, and the Indicator Unit Type 62 (or 62A) oscilloscope. The two were attached together by two <b>thick</b> <b>cables,</b> one of which carried the video signal, and the second carried the power to the Indicator, the power supply being built into the receiver to save space on the display side. A [...] "tropicalized" [...] version of the system was also produced, with the R3645 receiver and Indicator Unit Type 299, which moved the later's power supply into the display unit.|$|R
50|$|About {{fourteen}} smaller grey cables {{emerge from}} the top of this box; they are fixed to the wall by a bracket. Above this, twelve of the cables turn and run horizontally to the east, over two rusted metal brackets. Six of the cables are draped over these brackets and hang towards the floor. The other six run further to the left to a point immediately above the two <b>thick</b> <b>cables</b> at the eastern end of the wall. At this point, they turn towards the floor meeting the two cables coming up from the floor. They are fastened to the wall on a block of wood.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Experimental {{analysis}} {{on the effects of}} atmospheric Pollution and environmental degradation on the electrical properties of un-protected high tension cables, using copper and Aluminum wires of various diameters as case study, has been advanced. The analysis of the various data obtained {{in the course of the}} experiment, using the Aitken Interpolation model, shows that exposure of electrical conducting cables to humid, highly polluted and toxic atmosphere, decreases the I – V (current – voltage) characteristic as well as the conductivity of the cable due to increase in the amount of degradation and weight losses. Further analysis indicates that <b>thicker</b> <b>cables</b> suffer less degradation and power loss compare to thinner ones...|$|R
5000|$|The Post Office team {{developed}} a Bombe attachment for a standard three-wheel Bombe containing high speed wheels and an electronic sensing unit. It {{was attached to}} the Bombe by a very <b>thick</b> <b>cable</b> and was dubbed the Cobra Bombe. [...] Twelve were made at the Mawdsley engineering factory in Dursley, Gloucestershire, but turned out to be unreliable, so the other stream of development at the British Tabulating Machine Company at Letchworth was preferred. Both machines were subsequently overshadowed by the great success of the US Navy Bombes.|$|E
5000|$|Since {{knitted fabric}} is {{generally}} elastic, it conforms readily to the wearer's body without shaping. However, some shaping {{may be necessary}} when the knitted fabrics are unusually stiff (e.g., <b>thick</b> <b>cable</b> designs or heavily overstitched designs) or in regions of high curvature (e.g. sock heels). Ironically, shaping is much easier and less obvious with knitted fabrics than with woven cloth. Instead of cutting out wedges and sewing the edges together, knitters can add or subtract stitches; work short rows; or, most subtly of all, change the needle size to produce smaller/larger stitches in the desired [...] "wedge" [...] region.|$|E
5000|$|An audio {{multicore}} cable (often colloquially {{referred to in}} the US and Canada as a snake cable or just a snake) is a <b>thick</b> <b>cable</b> which contains from four to 64 individual audio cables inside a common, sturdy outer jacket. Audio {{multicore cable}}s are widely used whenever multiple audio signals, for example from a number of microphones, need to be conveyed between common locations. Typical professional audio applications include audio recording, sound reinforcement, PA systems and broadcasting. The [...] "snake" [...] is typically used {{to make it easier to}} route many signals from the location of the microphones or other input transducers, to the location of the audio console and sound recording, broadcasting and/or sound reinforcement equipment is located.|$|E
50|$|The procon-ten {{system used}} <b>thick</b> <b>cables,</b> similar to winch cables, {{running around the}} rear of the engine, and linked to it. In the event of a frontal impact, the force and {{momentum}} of the impact would shift the engine rearwards, tensioning and pulling the cables, which were in turn connected to the steering column and seat belt mounts. When the cable was pulled tight by the engine, the cables would pull the steering wheel towards the front of the car, clear of the driver, and also remove any slack in the seat belts, holding the occupants more firmly in their seats until the accident had finished.|$|R

50|$|Today, utility poles {{may hold}} {{much more than}} the {{uninsulated}} copper wire that they originally supported. <b>Thicker</b> <b>cables</b> holding many twisted pair, coaxial cable, or even fibre-optic, may be carried. Simple analogue repeaters or other outside plant equipment have long been mounted against poles, and often new digital equipment for multiplexing/demultiplexing or digital repeaters may now be seen. In many places, as seen in the illustration, providers of electricity, television, telephone, street light, traffic signal and other services share poles, either in joint ownership or by renting space to each other. In the United States, ANSI standard 05.1.2008 governs wood pole sizes and strength loading. Utilities that fall under the Rural Electrification Act must also follow the guidelines set forth in RUS Bulletin 1724E-150 (from the US Department of Agriculture) for pole strength and loading.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} {{communication}} cables found on utility poles are copper or {{fibre optic cable}} (FOC) for telephone lines and coaxial cable for cable television (CATV). Coaxial or optical fibre cables linking computer networks are also increasingly found on poles in urban areas. The cable linking the telephone exchange to local customers is a <b>thick</b> <b>cable</b> lashed to a thin supporting cable, containing hundreds of twisted pair subscriber lines. Each twisted pair line provides a single telephone circuit or local loop to a customer. There may also be fibre optic cables interconnecting telephone exchanges. Like electrical distribution lines, communication cables connect to service drops when used to provide local service to customers.|$|E
5000|$|The {{keyboard}} had flat tops, {{similar to}} the HP 9800 series desktop computers rather than the curved contours now considered to be ergonomic. It featured three keypad areas: Alphabetic, numeric, {{and an array of}} cursor positioning and editing keys somewhat similar to modern PC keyboard layouts. There were also a number of smaller function and feature control keys arrayed in two rows above the normal keypad areas. The keyboard chassis was separate from the main body, connected via a <b>thick</b> <b>cable.</b> The keyboard used a bit-paired layout (similar to that on a teleprinter machine) rather than the typewriter-paired arrangement on DEC's VT100. Although large, users loved the keyboard because [...] "it had a key for everything".|$|E
