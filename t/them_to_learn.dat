5|$|By 1982, Sims {{was part}} of a promotional tour {{reviving}} interest in No Maps on My Taps with co-stars Bunny Briggs and Chuck Green, their pre-screening performances backed by Cab Calloway. Even as booked performances were coming more regularly, Sims never stopped participating in street-corner challenges, encouraging younger generations of dancers and inviting <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> his moves.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with items}} and money earned from battles, winning battles earns {{experience}} points which increases each party member's level and allows <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> skills from their weapons. Performing well in battles, such as achieving quick victories or successful Session Attacks, increases party members' Stage Level, which unlock Performa for Radiant Skills and opens up new side stories. The game ends, sending the player {{back to the}} title screen, if all party members are knocked unconscious by running out of HP.|$|E

50|$|Stevens was a keen entomological {{collector}} {{for much}} of his life. He ran a natural history agency from his shop at 24 Bloomsbury Street, London, from 1848 until 1867. Two of his earliest, and best known, clients were Alfred Russel Wallace and Henry Walter Bates, supporting their joint collecting expedition to the Amazon and then Wallace's journeys in the 'Malay Archipelago' by buying their specimens and displaying <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>learned</b> societies.|$|R
5|$|Apart from {{development}} of cultural intelligence, life skills are also {{incorporated into the}} curriculum {{to prepare students for}} the future, by assisting students in the acquisition of various life skills that will be useful as they become part of the 21st century workforce. The Learning for Life Programme (LLP) provides a unique cognitive-aesthetic domain of learning through drama, public speaking, debate, puppetry and creative Chinese lyrical composition, to strengthen self-expression and nurtures aesthetics appreciation in students, as well as to allow <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> and embrace cultural diversity.|$|E
5|$|Loading at Australian ports was {{frequently}} disorganised and sloppy. Manifests were not flown ahead, so New Guinea Force {{did not know}} the contents of a shipment beforehand. Some ships arrived without manifests. The labelling of contents was also poor, and boxes often had to be broken into to determine their contents. Even then it was not always apparent who the intended recipient was. Much of the problem was poor staff work by the inexperienced Movement Control staff at Advanced Allied Land Forces Headquarters (LHQ) in Brisbane. The Australian Army had never had to handle such work before. Men with experience in the shipping industry were appointed as Movement Control officers, but it took time for <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> about military cargoes and procedures.|$|E
5|$|Students explore broad {{learning}} themes at {{each level}} that allow <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> across subjects and engage them in creative and collaborative projects. The second group, for example, spends much of their year {{on the study of}} trees, using trees as a focus for biology, mathematics, art, and creative writing. Students adopt and study a personal space in the nearby forest preserve. The year culminates with the tapping of maple trees to make syrup, which they share {{with the rest of the}} school. Each group engages different themes and group projects. Lower school students simulate an airplane flight to Paris and host a Japanese luncheon. The fourth group holds a Native American Fair, the fifth group creates an original Egyptian style mastaba, the sixth group presents a World's Fair, and the eighth group organizes an Immigration and Ethnic Fair.|$|E
50|$|Instead of {{traditional}} assignments, PAKs (Personal Activity Kit) are administered for each class. PAKs {{include all the}} work for the unit. They inform students of the objectives, direct <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> materials, and prepare them for tests/quizzes. The PAK system encourages {{students to participate in}} teamwork, seminars, and large groups to provide opportunities for teacher-directed and group learning. After the PAK is turned in, a test is given over the material of that PAK.|$|R

25|$|In the US, it is {{sometimes}} the practice to have some fox cubs chased but allowed to escape in order for <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> evasion techniques and {{so that they can}} be tracked again in the future.

25|$|Autonomous {{education}} {{helps students}} develop their self-consciousness, vision, practicality {{and freedom of}} discussion. These attributes serve to aid the student in his/her independent learning. However, a student must not start their autonomous learning completely on their own. It is said, that by first having interaction with someone who has more knowledge in a subject, will speed up the student's learning, and hence allow <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> more independently.|$|E
25|$|General {{relativity}} predicts gravitational waves, as {{does any}} theory of gravitation in which {{changes in the}} gravitational field propagate at a finite speed. Since gravitational waves can be directly detected, {{it is possible to}} use <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> about the Universe. This is gravitational-wave astronomy. Gravitational-wave astronomy can test general relativity by verifying that the observed waves are of the form predicted (for example, that they only have two transverse polarizations), and by checking that black holes are the objects described by solutions of the Einstein field equations.|$|E

In 1862, {{the effects of}} another smallpox outbreak on the StÃ³:lÅ were limited in comparison with that related to northern indigenous people, {{because they had been}} inoculated with the vaccine. Although deadly smallpox epidemics broke out at least once more (and possibly in 1824 and 1862), it was, however, only {{one of a number of}} serious diseases that would strike the region. Measles, mumps, tuberculosis, influenza, and venereal diseases also caused high fatalities among the StÃ³:lÅ population.|$|E

25|$|Though {{hopeful that}} {{humanity}} will ultimately prosper {{by the use}} of automatons, he mentions a few ways this relationship with technology could be detrimental. Automatons must not be taken for granted, because with advances in technology that allow <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn,</b> the machines may be able to escape human control if humans do not continue proper supervision of them. We might become entirely dependent on them, or even controlled by them. There is danger in trusting decisions to something which cannot think abstractly, and may therefore be unlikely to identify with intellectual human values which are not purely utilitarian.|$|E
25|$|As {{an example}} of a Made-Over Classroom, Davidson {{discusses}} an experimental school Quest 2 Learn. Q2L is a school whose curriculum is based on the principles of gaming. There students don't just go from class to class, completing regular assignments, they participate in quests, aimed at solving complex problems, advancing from one level to another, culminating in a final project. This model, according to Davidson, has the potential {{to address the needs of}} children who are diagnosed with learning disabilities, such as ADHD or autism, allowing <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> in ways that focus on their individual strengths without forcing them into a standardized learning structure, which could be detrimental to their engagement and future achievements.|$|E
25|$|After {{realizing how}} many Greek and Roman myths {{he had left}} {{untouched}} as well the immense success of the original series, Riordan began writing a second series, using inspiration for his storyline from experiences {{that he and his}} children had while playing video and role-playing games such as World of Warcraft and Scion. After creating the storyline, Riordan created three new main charactersâJason, Piper, and Leoâbut continued to use the previous main characters such as Annabeth and Grover as secondary characters. Unlike the Percy Jackson & the Olympians series which uses first-person narration solely from Percy's point of view, the second series is told in third-person, with the point of view alternating between various main characters. In The Lost Hero, those characters are Jason, Piper, and Leo. Although initially uncertain how fans would react, Riordan later found that they enjoyed the new format, as it allowed <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> more about each character.|$|E
