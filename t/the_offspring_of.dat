5|$|Silkies {{most likely}} {{made their way}} to the West via the Silk Route and {{maritime}} trade. The breed was recognized officially in North America with acceptance into the Standard of Perfection in 1874. Once Silkies became more common in the West, many myths were perpetuated about them. Early Dutch breeders told buyers they were <b>the</b> <b>offspring</b> <b>of</b> chickens and rabbits, while sideshows promoted them as having actual mammalian fur.|$|E
5|$|The Mahabharata (Adi Parva book) {{records that}} Kamadhenu-Surabhi {{rose from the}} {{churning}} of the cosmic ocean (Samudra manthan) by the gods and demons to acquire Amrita (ambrosia, elixir of life).

She was ordered by the creator-god Brahma to give milk, and supply it and ghee ("clarified butter") for ritual fire-sacrifices.|$|E
5|$|The Polled Dorset is a {{breed of}} sheep {{developed}} for meat at the North Carolina State University Small Ruminant Unit in 1956.

After some years of breeding work, a strain of Dorset was developed which had lost the characteristic horns and which bred true.|$|E

5|$|The ponies {{are most}} {{commonly}} bay, chestnut, or grey. Few coat colours are excluded: piebald, skewbald, and blue-eyed cream are not allowed; palomino and very light chestnut are only {{accepted by the}} stud book as geldings and mares. Blue eyes are never accepted. White markings {{on the head and}} lower legs are allowed, unless they appear behind the head, above the point of the hock in the hind leg, or above the metacarpal bone at the bend in the knee in the foreleg. Ponies failing to pass these standards may not be registered in the purebred section of the stud book, but are recorded in the appendix, known as the X-register. <b>The</b> <b>offspring</b> <b>of</b> these animals may not be registered as purebred New Forest ponies, as the stud book is closed and only <b>the</b> <b>offspring</b> <b>of</b> purebred-approved registered ponies may be registered as purebred.|$|E

5|$|Bovidae have {{featured}} in stories {{since at least}} the time of Aesop's fables from Ancient Greece around 600 BC. Fables by Aesop include The Crow and the Sheep, The Frog and the Ox, and The Wolf and the Lamb. The mythological creature Chimera, depicted as a lion, with the head of a goat arising from its back, and a tail that might end with a snake's head, was one of <b>the</b> <b>offspring</b> <b>of</b> Typhon and Echidna and a sibling of such monsters as Cerberus and the Lernaean Hydra. The sheep, synonymous with the goat in Chinese mythology, is the eighth animal of the Chinese zodiac, and a symbol of filial piety.|$|E
5|$|Folk {{tales and}} myths {{sometimes}} contain mythological hybrids; the Minotaur was <b>the</b> <b>offspring</b> <b>of</b> a human, Pasiphaë, {{and a white}} bull. More often, they are composites of the physical attributes {{of two or more}} kinds of animals, mythical beasts, and humans, with no suggestion that they are the result of interbreeding, as in the centaur (man/horse), chimera (goat/lion/snake), hippocamp (fish/horse), and sphinx (woman/lion). The Old Testament mentions a first generation of half-human hybrid giants, the Nephilim, while the apocryphal Book of Enoch describes the Nephilim as the wicked sons of fallen angels and attractive women.|$|E
5|$|Halvdan Koht {{was born}} on 7 August 1873 in Tromsø, {{one of the larger}} cities in Northern Norway. He was the second of four {{children}} born to Paul Steenstrup Koht (1844–1892), an educator and politician, and Betty Giæver (1845–1936), a part-time teacher with a penchant for singing, languages and drawing. Betty's antecedents were mixed: she was maternally descended from Northern Germany, yet on her father's side she was of Norwegian origin—a distinguished forebear on that side was her great-grandfather, the civil servant Jens Holmboe from Tromsø. Through <b>the</b> <b>offspring</b> <b>of</b> his maternal grand-uncle, Halvdan Koht was a third cousin of the parliamentarian Ola Krogseng Giæver. In Paul Koht's lineage, Kjeld Stub was a distant ancestor. The name Koht stems from German immigrants to Norway in the 17th century.|$|E

5|$|In 1998, a {{complete}} prehistorical skeleton found in Portugal, the Lapedo child, had features of both anatomically modern humans and Neanderthals. Some ancient human skulls with especially large nasal cavities and unusually shaped braincases represent human-Neanderthal hybrids. A 37,000- to 42,000-year-old human jawbone found in Romania's Oase cave contains traces of Neanderthal ancestry from only {{four to six}} generations earlier. All genes from Neanderthals in the current human population are descended from Neanderthal fathers and human mothers. A Neanderthal skull unearthed in Italy in 1957 reveals Neanderthal mitochondrial DNA, which is passed on through only the maternal lineage, but the skull has a chin shape similar to modern humans. It is proposed that it was <b>the</b> <b>offspring</b> <b>of</b> a Neanderthal mother and a human father.|$|E
5|$|In Serbia, men {{believed}} to possess properties of an ala were called aloviti (ala-like) men, {{and they were}} given several explanations. An ala may have sneaked into them; these were recognized by their voracity, because the ala, {{in order to satisfy}} her excessive hunger, drove them to eat incessantly. They may also have survived an ala blowing on them– an ala’s breath is usually lethal to humans. These people would then become exceptionally strong. Alternatively, they could be <b>the</b> <b>offspring</b> <b>of</b> an ala and a woman, or could have been born covered with the caul. It was believed that aloviti men could not be killed with a gun or arrow, unless gold or silver was used.|$|E
