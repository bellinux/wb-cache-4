40|$|In {{this chapter}} I discuss the {{theoretical}} {{issues and the}} aesthetic consequences of dubbing, both in general – when the <b>translation</b> is faithful <b>and</b> the <b>dubbing</b> {{is a good one}} – and in peculiarly bad cases – when either the translation or the dubbing, or both, are inaccurate. Dubbing is widely used in European countries such as Germany, France, the ex-Soviet countries and Italy. Being a film scholar with a specialization in Hollywood cinema, I am used to watching Hollywood films in their original versions. Being a native Italian speaker, I cannot help but noticing the differences between the original films and the Italian dubbed versions. Inaccurate <b>translations</b> <b>and</b> bad <b>dubbing</b> can severely harm the film's original meaning on the one hand, and lead to aesthetics changes on the other– e. g., an actor's persona or a character's characterization can be modified if dubbed with a voice that is radically different from the original. The case of Marilyn Monroe is exemplary: the Italian dubbing was designed to make her sound definitely more stupid than in the original version – by changing her dialogue, and by choosing a more “goose-like” voice timbre and tone...|$|R

By means of a contrastive analysis of the <b>translation</b> for <b>dubbing</b> <b>and</b> subtitling of a specific audio-visual text, the film The Nightmare before Christmas, this paper sets two objectives: to identify the characteristics <b>and</b> restrictions of <b>dubbing</b> <b>and</b> subtitling as well as the tendencies that prevail in their <b>translation</b> <b>and</b> to observe whether the norm has been correctly applied in both cases according to the literature consulted. For the purposes of this study, the film has been watched in order to spot the most representative excerpts so as to build up a corpus of examples in which four translation problems have been analyzed: song translation, proper names, cultural referents and idiolects. One of the most important observations carried out is that the translation in each modality is very different. A possible reason to explain this phenomenon could be that <b>dubbing</b> <b>and</b> subtitling pursue different goals that have been influenced to some extent by the specific characteristics and restrictions of each modality, {{as well as by the}} musical genre of the fil...|$|R

This article is based on the related scientific information analysis, deep research, personal author?s observations and data resulting from the conducted survey. Due to the skilled professional use of the qualitative research methods and statistical data analysis the author has managed to make important findings about state of film translation and show how it influences on the lives of ordinary people. The stated goal is to develop nonexistent before classification of causes of mistranslations in the English speaking movies adjusted to the Ukrainian viewers. The systemized reasons of mistakes are sustained by vivid examples. Furthermore, the frequency of these causes is determined and shown in the chart.

40|$|Disney {{works and}} their {{original}} soundtracks are extremely popular in Japan. This study examines {{the differences between}} the subtitled and the dubbed songs featured in Disney’s Aladdin from 1992. The field of Audiovisual <b>Translation,</b> which subtitling <b>and</b> <b>dubbing</b> are a part of, has not been researched enough. Hence, more studies of the unique differences and challenges of these translation forms are necessary. This thesis seeks to answer {{the question of whether the}} different limitations in <b>dubbing</b> <b>and</b> subtitling produce differences in the resulting translations, or if there are any differences between the source text <b>and</b> the <b>translations</b> that are specific to the Japanese language or Japanese translation. In order to do this, the songs were analyzed through a quantification of characters and syllables, and discussed in detail through the extraction of examples. The quantitative results showed that the dubbing was considerably shorter than the subtitles in character count, and nearly identical to the English lyrics in syllable count, in order to match rhythm and musical notes. The subtitles contained mostly literal <b>translations</b> <b>and</b> favored foreignization in the translation of cultural elements. The dubbing tended to omit most culture-specific items and was more liberal in its translation, often neglecting the original syntactic structure in the English version in favor of semantic interpretation, with phrasing suitable to the lyrical nature of the translation...|$|R

By carrying out a quantitative study, we answered questions such as whether the practice is acceptable amongst audiences, or whether some language choices alter the perception of certain characters. We measured the perception of ten opposed personality traits amongst native audiences in English, Spanish and Catalan using a Semantic Differential Scale, and assessed the global impression of characters that had been translated with and without the use of varieties. The results show that characters overall are perceived the same way across languages regardless of whether they use varieties in or outside the mainstream, and conclude that this tool can be used to quantify and compare the same characters across languages...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{barriers}} to the reuse of Open Educational Resources (OER) is language (OLnet, 2009). OER may be available but in a language that users cannot access, so a preliminary step to reuse is their translation or localization. One of the obvious solutions to the vast effort required to translate OER is to crowd-source the translation, as exemplified by Wikipedia (Wikipedia Translation) or TED (Ted Open Translation Project). From October to December 2012 the Department of Languages at the Open University UK ran a MOOC on Open <b>Translation</b> Tools <b>and</b> Practices (OT 12). Participants explored a range of online open translation tools (Amara, Transifex, Google Translator Toolkit) that enable and facilitate the crowdsourcing of <b>translation,</b> <b>dubbing</b> <b>and</b> subtitling. For this MOOC, participants collaborated in the <b>translation</b> <b>and</b> subtitling of OER mainly to and from English and Spanish, but also Portuguese, French, Greek, German and Catalan. Forum discussions, synchronous online sessions, recorded podcasts and the tasks themselves were designed to provide input, facilitate discussion and share views {{not only on the}} linguistic specificities of translating different languages, but also on issues such as quality assurance in open <b>translation</b> <b>and</b> the ethics and practicalities of openness in education <b>and</b> <b>translation.</b> Data for this paper is drawn from online surveys covering participants' backgrounds and their prior experience as translators; their expectations and motivation for participating in the OT 12 MOOC; and their evaluation of the outcomes of the MOOC. We understand MOOCs as events (Cormier, 2010) or, following the principles of connectivism, catalysts for starting conversations within a network (Downes, 2011), and therefore feel that they might be a suitable way of engaging online communities of translators, language teachers and learners, and those interested in the crowdsourcing of translations for OER. This paper attempts to open up a debate on how the world of open education can harness crowdsourcing <b>and</b> existing open <b>translation</b> models to further the openness agenda. ...|$|R
