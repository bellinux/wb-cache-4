The value dropped {{somewhat}} when the boom in commemorative coins burst in late 1936, but quickly recovered and the coins are valuable today. Melish has been assailed by numismatic writers for greed.|$|E
5|$|Critics like Edwin Cameron accused Mandela's {{government}} of doing little {{to stem the}} HIV/AIDS pandemic in the country; by 1999, 10% of South Africa's population were HIV positive. Mandela later {{admitted that he had}} personally neglected the issue, in part due to public reticence in discussing issues surrounding sex in South Africa, and that he had instead left <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>for</b> Mbeki to deal with. Mandela also received criticism for failing to sufficiently combat crime; South Africa had one of the world's highest crime rates, and the activities of international crime syndicates in the country grew significantly throughout the decade. Mandela's administration was also perceived as having failed {{to deal with the problem}} of corruption.|$|E
5|$|Mansukhani {{conceived}} {{the film as}} a tale of three friends living together, drawing inspiration by his own experience. Wanting to add something different to the script, he later decided to introduce homosexuality (which he thought was unexplored by Bollywood) {{to shed light on}} <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>for</b> the Indian audience. Manish Malhotra designed Chopra's costumes, and Aki Narula designed costumes {{for the rest of the}} cast. The soundtrack was composed by Vishal–Shekhar and Anvita Dutt Guptan; Kumaar and Vishal Dadlani wrote its lyrics.|$|E

5|$|The 1951 charter reforms {{included}} {{consolidation of}} {{city and county}} offices. When all of the municipalities in Philadelphia County were consolidated into one city in 1854, the surviving county offices often duplicated the efforts of city offices. The new charter allowed for their consolidation, but litigation ensued about which county offices were actually state offices, and thus immune from the city's jurisdiction. A State Supreme Court case decided in 1953 settled <b>the</b> <b>issue,</b> <b>for</b> the most part, leaving the Register of Wills as an independently elected official.|$|E
5|$|The British {{continued}} their policy of stalling Smith. At {{the end of}} August 1965, they did not consider a Rhodesian UDI an immediate threat, and therefore focussed on the colony's maintained defiance of the mother country regarding Reedman and Lisbon. On 30 August, Johnston summarised Britain's stand on <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>for</b> Bottomley's Commonwealth Relations Office. According to his understanding, he said, Rhodesia had been told just before Federal dissolution that it would retain the Federation's former powers regarding external affairs, but that this entrustment was subject to British discretion, {{and could not be}} exercised without extensive prior consultation and conformity to Britain's line.|$|E

Currently any company issuing a security may select the company that evaluates the security. The amendment was passed; however, the financial industry lobbied to have Franken's amendment removed from the final bill. Negotiations between the Senate and House, whose version of financial reform did not include such a provision, resulted in the amendment's being watered down to require only {{a series of studies}} being done upon <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>for</b> two years.

5|$|Ultimately decided {{under the}} title O'Grady v. Superior Court, the suit filed by Apple against unnamed bloggers raised <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>for</b> the first time of whether bloggers hold the same protections against {{revealing}} sources that journalists have. In November 2004, three popular weblog sites featuring Apple rumors publicly revealed information about two unreleased Apple products, the Mac mini and an as yet unreleased product code-named Asteroid, also known as Project Q97. Apple subpoenaed three sites {{to force them to}} identify their confidential sources: Apple Insider, Power Page, and, separately, Think Secret, which did no original reporting on the case and thus had no sources to reveal. In February 2005, a trial court in California decided that website operators {{do not have the same}} shield law protection as do other journalists. The journalists appealed and, in May 2006, the California Court of Appeal reversed the trial court's decision, ruling that activities in question were covered by the shield law.|$|E
5|$|Edward 'Ned' Trickett {{sought to}} win the Australian Championship from Rush. Trickett was outclassed by Rush at the 1874 and 1875 events, but {{afterwards}} competed at numerous regattas and in private matches, and his form was consistently improving. Trickett and his backers demanded that Rush contest the title on the Parramatta River where he won it from Hickey. Rush declined to row anywhere but on the Clarence River, and demanded that the stakes be not less than £500. By 1875, Rush had a wife and five children to support, {{as well as many}} business commitments, and could not afford to undertake a sporting endeavour involving a major investment in time and money, unless there was a chance of an adequate financial return. Dozens of letters and articles in the Australian press debated <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>for</b> nearly two years, as Trickett and his supporters became increasingly incensed at Rush's stalling. Finally, former champion sculler and now a prosperous publican and backer of sculling events, offered to finance an attempt by an Australian sculler to topple the current holder of the World Sculling Championship, Englishman Joseph Sadler. Rush declined to travel to London. Trickett agreed to the journey, went to the Thames, beat Sadler, and brought home the World Championship to Australia. Rush challenged Trickett for the World title. Trickett demanded that the race be rowed on the Parramatta River, and the match came off on the afternoon of 30 June 1877.|$|E
