25|$|The rolling blackouts {{brought on}} by the crises at the nuclear power plants in Fukushima had a {{profound}} effect on the rail networks around Tokyo starting on 14 March. Major railways began running trains at 10–20minute intervals, rather than the usual 3–5minute intervals, operating some lines only at rush hour and completely shutting down others; notably, the Tōkaidō Main Line, Yokosuka Line, Sōbu Main Line and Chūō-Sōbu Line were all stopped for the day. This led to near-paralysis within the capital, with long lines at train stations and many people unable <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> or get home. Railway operators gradually increased capacity over the next few days, until running at approximately 80% capacity by 17 March and relieving the worst of the passenger congestion.|$|E
