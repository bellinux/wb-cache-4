40|$|A signal {{interface}} circuit with selectable {{signal interface}} parameters for a <b>telephone</b> <b>subscriber</b> <b>line</b> includes an impedance circuit having a selectable impedance value, signal terminals having an associated, definable termination impedance, a transmitter circuit having a definable transmitter transfer function and a receiver circuit having a definable receiver transfer function. The signal terminals connect to an external signal line pair having an associated line impedance for conducting outgoing and incoming signals therefrom and thereto, respectively. The transmitter circuit receives the outgoing {{signal from the}} signal terminals and provides a transmit signal in accordance with its transmitter transfer function. The receiver circuit, which includes a differential transconductance amplifier, receives an input signal and the transmit signal and provides the incoming signal to the signal terminals in accordance with its receiver transfer function. The termination impedance, transmitter transfer function and receiver transfer function are all defined by the selectable impedance, with the termination impedance defined to match the line impedance...|$|E

50|$|The modem {{for this}} service was the Bell 101 dataset, {{which is the}} direct {{ancestor}} of the Bell 103 modem that launched computer time-sharing. The 101 was revolutionary because it ran on ordinary unconditioned <b>telephone</b> <b>subscriber</b> <b>lines,</b> allowing the Bell System to run TWX along with POTS on a single public switched telephone network.|$|R
50|$|Certain {{services}} {{offer to}} check telephone numbers alongside other personal details, gained from various public sources e.g. the Electoral roll {{and from the}} imprints left on by their activities, for examples from transactions made using credit cards. The advantage of a database check is that the lookup can be very quick (sub 1s), however no databases exist to cover all <b>telephone</b> <b>subscriber</b> <b>lines</b> internationally, with mobile telephones being particularly problematic to trace - especially Pay as you go (phone) (non contract) arrangements which often have no registered owner. Some databases are very detailed and can correlate telephone numbers with physical addresses, e-mail addresses, ownership and sometimes even personal details. Such detail can help with combating fraud as well as allowing greater understanding of a customer base.|$|R
40|$|MULTIPLE-INPUT MULTIPLE-OUTPUT (MIMO) CHANNELS {{constitute}} a unified way of modeling {{a wide range}} of different physical communication channels, which can then be handled with a compact and elegant vector-matrix notation. The two paradigmatic examples are wireless multi-antenna channels and wireline Digital <b>Subscriber</b> <b>Line</b> (DSL) channels. Research in antenna arrays (also known as smart antennas) dates back to the 1960 ’s. However, the use of multiples antennas at both the transmitter and the receiver, which can be naturally modeled as a MIMO channel, has been recently shown to offer a significant potential increase in capacity. DSL has gained popularity as a broadband access technology capable of reliably delivering high data rates over <b>telephone</b> <b>subscriber</b> <b>lines.</b> A DSL system can be modeled as a communication through a MIMO channel by considering all the copper twisted pairs within a binder as a whole rather than treating each twisted pair independently. This dissertation considers arbitrary MIMO channels regardless of the physical nature of the channels themselves; as a consequence, the obtained results apply to any communication system that can be modeled as such. After an extensive overview of MIMO channels, both fundamental limits and practical communication aspects of such channels are considered...|$|R
50|$|This is {{the process}} whereby a <b>telephone</b> <b>subscriber</b> whose <b>telephone</b> <b>line</b> is {{maintained}} by one company, usually a former monopoly provider (e.g. BT), can choose {{to have some of}} their calls automatically routed across a different telephone company's network (e.g. Talk Talk) without needing to enter a special code or special equipment.|$|R
50|$|The total REN load on a <b>subscriber</b> <b>line</b> {{is the sum}} of the REN {{loads of}} all devices (phone, fax, a {{separate}} answerphone, etc.) connected to the line; this number expresses the overall loading effect of the subscriber equipment on the central office ringing current source. <b>Subscriber</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>lines</b> are usually limited to support a load of 5 REN or less.|$|R
25|$|Later exchanges {{consisted}} {{of one to}} several hundred plug boards staffed by switchboard operators. Each operator {{sat in front of}} a vertical panel containing banks of ¼-inch tip-ring-sleeve (3-conductor) jacks, each of which was the local termination of a <b>subscriber's</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>line.</b> In front of the jack panel lay a horizontal panel containing two rows of patch cords, each pair connected to a cord circuit.|$|R
50|$|For example, when {{downloading}} a web page, the {{packets of}} web page data travel over optical fiber Internet lines {{directly to the}} DSLAM at the neighborhood telephone exchange. At the DSLAM they are split into as many as 247 parallel data streams. Each is modulated onto a separate carrier signal and sent through a separate frequency channel over the <b>subscriber's</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>line</b> to the DSL modem. The modem demodulates the carrier, extracting the data stream from each carrier signal, performs error correction, puts the data together again in the proper order, and sends it to the computer over the Ethernet line.|$|R
50|$|A DSL router {{consists}} of a box which has an RJ11 jack to connect to a standard <b>subscriber</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>line.</b> It has several RJ45 jacks for Ethernet cables to connect it to computers or printers, creating a local network. It usually also has a USB jack {{which can be used}} to connect to computers via a USB cable, to allow connection to computers without an Ethernet port. A wireless DSL router also has antennas to allow it to act as a wireless access point, so computers can connect to it forming a wireless network. Power is usually supplied by a cord from a wall wart transformer.|$|R
5000|$|The General Post Office {{placed the}} entire {{estate in the}} Dagenham post town, {{including}} the Barking and Ilford sections, giving all residents postal addresses of [...] "Dagenham, Essex". It is perhaps {{for this reason that}} Becontree and Dagenham became synonymous. In 1927 the LCC was reluctant to agree that the Postmaster General should provide <b>subscriber</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>lines</b> to the estate, as it was considered incongruous for residents of a subsidised housing scheme {{to be able to afford}} such a luxury. Lines were connected from nearby exchanges until the DOMinion exchange was opened within the estate. In 1954 it had 1,337 lines, increasing to 1,620 in 1955 and by 1958 it had 2,700 lines.|$|R
50|$|When the <b>subscriber</b> <b>line</b> is called, a relay on the <b>subscriber</b> <b>line</b> card {{connects the}} ringing {{generator}} to the <b>subscriber</b> <b>line.</b> The exchange also sends a ringback tone to the calling party. When the called party answers {{by taking the}} telephone handset off the switchhook, the <b>subscriber's</b> <b>telephone</b> draws direct current from the central office battery. This current is sensed by the line card and the ringing relay is de-energized.|$|R
40|$|Characteristics of {{the methods}} for {{detecting}} unauthorized connections to a <b>subscriber</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>line</b> are presented. They ensure the confidentiality of telephone conversations, protect from eavesdropping of rooms and prevent the unauthorized use of telephone connection. The classification of threats of confidentiality violation in telephone channels was done and methodology for eliminating of unauthorized interception of information was proposed. For the most perfect protection of transmitted data channels it is advisable to use cryptographic algorithms for encryption of voice information. However, implementation of this method requires {{the presence of the}} same devices for signal encoding and decoding (scrambler) in all communicating subscribers. Only complex using of a range of listed technical equipment allows to avoid using of communication channels for wiretapping and eavesdropping in rooms through which they are passing. ??????????? ???????? ?????????? ???????, ????????? ? ????????? ?????????? ??????????? ?????? ?????????? ?? ???????? ?????????????? ????????????. ???????? ????? ??????? ? ??????? ??????????? ??????????????????? ??????????? ? ??????????? ?????????? ?????? ? ?????????? ?????? ?????? ? ??????? ??????? ?????????? ? ?????????????? ?????????? ??????????? ????????? ??????...|$|R
50|$|A {{subscriber}} loop carrier or <b>subscriber</b> <b>line</b> carrier (SLC) provides telephone exchange-like telephone interface functionality. An SLC remote terminal is typically {{located in an}} area with a high density of <b>telephone</b> <b>subscribers,</b> such as a residential neighborhood, that is remote from the telephone company's central office. Two or four T1 circuits (depending on the configuration) connect the SLC remote terminal to the central office terminal (COT), {{in the case of}} a universal {{subscriber loop}} carrier (USLC). An integrated subscriber loop carrier (ISLC) has its T-spans terminating directly in time division switching equipment in the telephone exchange.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Crosstalk from {{adjacent}} <b>telephone</b> <b>subscriber</b> loops is {{a primary}} impairment for digital <b>subscriber</b> <b>line</b> (DSL) service. This paper proposes a novel solution to identify various crosstalk sources in the current ADSL system. The algorithm takes the base power spectrum density (PSD) as a prior {{for each type of}} crosstalk, and compute a MSE solution based on the overall noise PSD. However, in a practical situation, the model mismatch and other unknown interference may greatly degrade the accuracy of the result. The major contribution of the paper is to provide a robust solution for the crosstalk identification in the presence of radio frequency interference (RFI) and other unknown interference. Simulation result is provided at the end...|$|R
