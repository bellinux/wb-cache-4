500|$|More than 50 {{species of}} exotic plant have been {{documented}} in the park, with almost 20 of those considered to be pest species which may displace native plants and possibly alter the ecological balance. Green iguanas, cane toads, black rats, lionfish, fire ants, oscars and brown basilisk lizards are common in the park. The lionfish (Pterois volitans and Pterois miles) is a tropical fish from the Indian-Pacific Ocean area. It {{is known for its}} voracious appetite and its ability to establish itself in new waters, rapidly replacing other species. Researchers theorized that the introduction of this species in the park occurred during Hurricane Andrew in 1992. Sightings in Biscayne Bay at that time were believed to have been from home aquariums that were destroyed during the hurricane, though the researcher who first proposed the theory has since retracted the assertion. [...] More recent lionfish sightings are probably from more established populations in the Florida Keys to the south of the park. Also likely originating from human captivity, Burmese pythons have been observed near the park's boundary along the mainland. Exotic plant species which pose the highest risk to native plant communities include Brazilian-pepper, <b>torpedo</b> <b>grass,</b> tuberous sword fern, guava and portiatree.|$|E
50|$|Burkholderia bannensis is a Gram-negative, aerobic, nonspore-forming {{bacterium}} of {{the genus}} Burkholderia and the family Burkholderiaceae, which was isolated from highly acidic swamps from <b>torpedo</b> <b>grass</b> (Panicum repens) in Thailand. It has the ability toneutralize acid.|$|E

These marshland invasives are accelerating the siltation process and may eventually result in necessity of raising {{the height of the}} dam to compensate for loss of storage due to siltation.|$|E

40|$|The United States Geological Survey lists over 30 {{non-native}} {{aquatic plant}} species colonizing water bodies in Louisiana. Some {{have been here}} for decades and remain fairly rare (such as Asian duck lettuce) while others (such as common salvinia, Salvinia minima), have covered hundreds of thousands of acres in the last 20 years. Common salvinia, along with alligator weed, water hyacinth, hydrilla, <b>torpedo</b> <b>grass</b> and water lettuce are the six most troublesome non-native species in Louisiana. Common salvinia can be controlled with herbicides but relief is temporary and repeated applications are often uneconomical. Biological control could offer a cheaper and more permanent solution...|$|E
40|$|Rice, as {{a widely}} and intensively {{cultivated}} crop, {{should be a}} target for parasite host shifts and a source for shifts to co-occurring weeds. Magnaporthe oryzae, of the M. grisea species complex, {{is the most important}} fungal pathogen of rice, {{with a high degree of}} host specificity. On the basis of 10 loci from six of its seven linkage groups, 37 multilocus haplotypes among 497 isolates of M. oryzae from rice and other grasses were identified. Phylogenetic relationships among isolates from rice (Oryza sativa), millet (Setaria spp.), cutgrass (Leersia hexandra), and <b>torpedo</b> <b>grass</b> (Panicum repens) were predominantly tree like, consistent with a lack of recombination, but from other hosts were reticulate, consistent with recombination. The single origin of rice-infecting M. oryzae followed a host shift from a Setaria millet and was closely followed by additional shifts to weeds of rice, cutgrass, and <b>torpedo</b> <b>grass.</b> Two independent estimators of divergence time indicate that these host shifts predate the Green Revolution and could be associated with rice domestication. The rice-infecting lineage is characterized by high copy number of the transposable element MGR 586 (Pot 3) and, except in two haplotypes, by a loss of AVR-Co 39. Both mating types have been retained in ancestral, well-distributed rice-infecting haplotypes 10 (mainly temperate) and 14 (mainly tropical), but only one mating type was recovered from several derived, geographically restricted haplotypes. There is evidence of a common origin of both ACE 1 virulence genotypes in haplotype 14. Host-haplotype association is evidenced by low pathogenicity on hosts associated with other haplotypes...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} {{was set in}} order to estimate aquatic plants evapotranspiration, (ET) in Edfina drain, Nile Delta, Egypt, which had an in-stream treatment wetland that was taken as a case study. A simple field scale approach is presented to measure drain water evaporation and water consumption of five aquatic plants, cultivated in floating tanks. Plants ET, (ETp) values were obtained by measuring the daily quantity of water required to renovate the tank’s initial volume. Crop coefficients (Kc) were obtained and water loss from the drain wetland was calculated due to evaporation and plants cells ETp. Results presented values of ETp and Kc which were controlled by plant leaf area and growing stage. The major ETp was for Hyacinth followed by Cattail, Reeds, <b>Torpedo</b> <b>grass,</b> and then duckweeds. All ETp values exceeded twice the adjacent non-vegetated water evaporation. The obtained Kc values referenced to the drain water evaporation were almost twice the Kc values of FAO Penman–Monteith ET, due to the landscape effects, as hot dry air can cause extra heat input and water loss. Total losses from in-stream treatment series of pond, 4 plants reaches and open disinfection zone did not exceed 0. 55 % of drain discharge...|$|E
