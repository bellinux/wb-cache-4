25|$|Traditional depth-of-field {{formulas}} {{and tables}} assume equal circles of confusion for {{near and far}} objects. Some authors, such as Merklinger (1992), have suggested that distant objects often need to be much sharper to be clearly recognizable, whereas closer objects, being larger on the film, {{do not need to}} be so sharp. The loss of detail in distant objects may be particularly noticeable with extreme enlargements. Achieving this additional sharpness in distant objects usually requires focusing beyond the hyperfocal distance, sometimes almost at infinity. For example, if photographing a cityscape with a <b>traffic</b> <b>bollard</b> in the foreground, this approach, termed the object field method by Merklinger, would recommend focusing very close to infinity, and stopping down to make the bollard sharp enough. With this approach, foreground objects cannot always be made perfectly sharp, but the loss of sharpness in near objects may be acceptable if recognizability of distant objects is paramount.|$|E
500|$|In 1989 or 1990, a San Francisco city worker dumped an unused granite bollard {{amid the}} monastery stones; the [...] tall bollard was once {{used as a}} traffic barrier. Some self-styled Hindu park users led by {{performance}} artist Michael Bowen, calling himself Guru Baba Kali Das, began to worship the phallus-shaped bollard as a lingam; they wrestled some of the monastery's stones into a religious circle, calling the circle Shiva Linga. The city sued to reclaim the area in 1993, but lost the battle in court. In January 1994 the city arranged to move the <b>traffic</b> <b>bollard</b> to Bowen's garage, serving as his temple. Bowen later offered the granite bollard for sale and admitted that the whole episode was a performance piece.|$|E

5000|$|Internally {{illuminated}} traffic bollards {{have been}} in existence throughout the United Kingdom since the 1930s, although the term [...] "bollard" [...] only seems to {{have been in}} common use since the late 1940s. An illuminated bollard has a recessed base light unit in the foundation which illuminates the <b>traffic</b> <b>bollard</b> from all angles. The main components are housed {{below the surface of the}} improvement (typically a concrete surface). Therefore, if a vehicle strikes the <b>traffic</b> <b>bollard,</b> the units below the surface are not damaged.|$|E

5000|$|Guard {{stones were}} {{developed}} as {{an item of}} street furniture during the era of horse-drawn vehicles, but some are still in use today. They are sometimes used as <b>traffic</b> <b>bollards,</b> but are generally positioned to protect a specific object, such as a corner of a building or {{the side of a}} gate. In Paris, they are usually metal in the shape of an arc, ball or cone. There are also models in hard stone with a sloping back to guide errant wheels away from impacting a building. Guard stones made of stone were sometimes surrounded by a metal ring to reduce wear.|$|R
5000|$|An Amsterdammertje (...) is {{the typical}} red-brown steel <b>traffic</b> <b>bollard</b> {{that is used}} to {{separate}} the sidewalk from the street in Amsterdam. Amsterdammertje is Dutch for 'little one from Amsterdam'. The bollards have the three Saint Andrew's Crosses from the coat of arms of Amsterdam.|$|E
50|$|Unlike many {{existing}} traffic bollards {{found in}} the UK, most new modern traffic bollards installed along roadways today are made of materials that make them completely collapsible. When struck by a vehicle at low or high speed, the <b>traffic</b> <b>bollard</b> shell reverts to its original position with minimal to no damage to the unit.|$|E
50|$|In 1989 or 1990, a San Francisco city worker dumped an unused granite bollard {{amid the}} monastery stones; the 4 ft tall bollard was once {{used as a}} traffic barrier.

5000|$|Retractable or [...] "rising" [...] {{bollards}} can {{be lowered}} entirely below the road surface (generally using an electric or hydraulic mechanism) to enable traffic to pass, or raised to block <b>traffic.</b> Rising <b>bollards</b> {{are used to}} secure sensitive areas from attack, or to enforce traffic rules that are time related, or to restrict access to particular classes of traffic.|$|R
50|$|Mandatory {{signs are}} {{a subset of the}} {{regulatory}} sign group as defined by the United Nations Economic and Social Council in the Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals of 1968, and are often seen not just on their own, but used in conjunction with other signs, <b>traffic</b> lights and <b>bollards</b> as a form of visual shorthand within these objects. In Vienna Convention signatories, the mandatory sign is either a light blue circle with a white border (Type A) or a white circle with a red border (Type B). The sign must be at least 60 cm (1.96 ft) across on rural roads, or 40 cm (1.31 ft) in built-up areas, although mandatory signs incorporated in <b>traffic</b> lights, <b>bollards</b> or larger road signs can be as little as 30 cm (0.98 ft) in diameter.|$|R
5000|$|A {{more recent}} {{development}} in bollard technology are bollard covers. They {{are used by}} many industries and communities as a cost effective way to increase safety and refresh old and worn out looking bollards without having to completely replace the original bollard. They slip over the existing bollard and can {{come in a variety}} of shapes and styles. Because they are easily removable they can be replaced quickly and depending on their material they may never need painting and are resistant to scratching and other wear and tear. <b>Traffic</b> <b>bollard</b> covers are typically made of tough recycled plastic and have high visibility colors to ensure motorists see them. Decorative bollards are used in street areas to enhance display and may come with LED lights to increase visibility and safety at night.|$|E

5000|$|Road traffic {{accidents}} usually involve impact loading, {{such as when}} a car hits a <b>traffic</b> <b>bollard,</b> water hydrant or tree, the damage being localized to the impact zone. When vehicles collide, the damage is proportionate to the relative velocity of the vehicles, the damage increasing as {{the square of the}} velocity since it is the impact kinetic energy (1/2 mv2) which is the variable of importance. Much design effort is made to improve the impact resistance of cars so as to minimize user injury. It can be achieved in several ways: by enclosing the driver and passengers in a safety cell for example. The cell is reinforced so it will survive in high speed crashes, and so protect the users. Parts of the body shell outside the cell are designed to crumple progressively, absorbing most of the kinetic energy which must be dissipated by the impact.|$|E
5000|$|Cycle tracks may be one-way or two-way, {{and may be}} at road level, at {{sidewalk}} level, or at {{an intermediate}} level. They all have in common some separation from motor <b>traffic</b> with <b>bollards,</b> car parking, barriers or boulevards. [...] Barriers may include curbs, concrete berms, posts, planting/median strips, walls, trenches, or fences. They are often accompanied by a curb extension or other features at intersections to simplify crossing.|$|R
50|$|Street {{furniture}} is a collective term (used in the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada) for objects {{and pieces of}} equipment installed along streets and roads for various purposes. It includes benches, <b>traffic</b> barriers, <b>bollards,</b> post boxes, phone boxes, streetlamps, traffic lights, traffic signs, bus stops, tram stops, taxi stands, public lavatories, fountains, watering troughs, memorials, public sculptures, and waste receptacles. The design and placement of furniture takes into account aesthetics, visual identity, function, pedestrian mobility and road safety.|$|R
2500|$|In spring 2004, she {{was offered}} the annual Unilever series {{commission}} to produce a piece for Tate Modern's vast Turbine Hall, delaying acceptance for five to six months until she was confident she could conceive of a work to fill the space. Throughout {{the latter half of}} September 2005 and mid-way into October her work Embankment was installed and was made public on 10 October. It consists of some 14,000 translucent, white polyethylene boxes (themselves casts of the inside of cardboard boxes) stacked in various ways; some in very tall mountain-like peaks and others in lower (though still over human height), rectangular, more levelled arrangements. They are fixed in position with adhesive. She cited the end scenes of both Raiders of the Lost Ark and Citizen Kane as visual precursors; she also spoke of the death of her mother and a period of upheaval which involved packing and moving comparable boxes. It is also thought that her recent trip to the Arctic is an inspiration, although critics counter that white is merely the colour the polyethylene comes in, and it would have added significantly to the expense to dye them. [...] The boxes were manufactured from casts of ten distinct cardboard boxes by a company that produces grit bins and <b>traffic</b> <b>bollards.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{main pier}} of the 1953 road bridge {{is the largest}} {{cofferdam}} built on a state highway since {{the construction of the}} San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge. The bascule span is 125 ft long and carries a counterweight of 1100 ST. Interlocks are provided so that <b>traffic</b> gates and <b>bollards</b> must be raised before the draw can be opened.|$|R
5000|$|Delineators are tall pylons (similar to <b>traffic</b> cones or <b>bollards)</b> {{mounted on}} the road surface, or {{along the edge of}} a road, and are used to {{channelize}} traffic. These are a form of raised pavement marker but unlike most such markers, delineators are not supposed to be hit except by out-of-control or drifting vehicles. Unlike their smaller cousins, delineators are tall enough to impact not only a vehicle's tires but the vehicle body itself. They usually contain one or more retroreflective strips. They can be round and open in the center or curved (45-degree sections) of plastic with a reflective strip. They are also used in low reflective markers in a [...] "T" [...] shape. They {{can also be used to}} indicate lane closures as in cases where the number of lanes is reduced.|$|R
