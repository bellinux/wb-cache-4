5|$|Gorgosaurus <b>teeth</b> <b>were</b> {{typical of}} all known tyrannosaurids. The eight premaxillary teeth {{at the front}} of the snout were smaller than the rest, closely packed and D-shaped in cross section. In Gorgosaurus, the first tooth in the maxilla was also shaped like the premaxillary teeth. The rest of the <b>teeth</b> <b>were</b> oval in cross section, rather than blade-like as in most other theropods. Along with the eight premaxillary teeth, Gorgosaurus had 26 to 30maxillary teeth and 30 to 34teeth in the dentary bones of the lower jaw. This number of teeth is similar to Albertosaurus and Daspletosaurus but is fewer than those of Tarbosaurus or Tyrannosaurus.|$|E
5|$|In 1856, Joseph Leidy {{described}} two tyrannosaurid premaxillary teeth from Montana. Although {{there was}} no indication of what the animal looked like, the <b>teeth</b> <b>were</b> large and robust, and Leidy gave them the name Deinodon. Matthew and Brown commented in 1922 that these <b>teeth</b> <b>were</b> indistinguishable from those of Gorgosaurus, but in the absence of skeletal remains of Deinodon, opted not to unequivocally synonymize the two genera, provisionally naming a ?Deinodon libratus. Although Deinodon teeth are very similar to those of Gorgosaurus, tyrannosaurid teeth are extremely uniform, so it cannot be said for certain which animal they belonged to. Deinodon is usually regarded as a nomen dubium today. Additional likely synonyms of G. libratus and/or D. horridus include Laelaps falculus, Laelaps hazenianus, Laelaps incrassatus, and Dryptosaurus kenabekides.|$|E

Torbjörn Lundström in Sweden reported that about 45-50% of 25000 horses had wolf <b>teeth.</b> They <b>are</b> much less common in the mandible (lower jaw) than the maxilla (upper jaw) although mandibular wolf <b>teeth</b> <b>are</b> found very occasionally.|$|R
5|$|Stegosaurus madagascariensis from Madagascar {{is known}} solely from teeth and was {{described}} by Piveteau in 1926. The <b>teeth</b> <b>were</b> variously attributed to a stegosaur, the theropod Majungasaurus, a hadrosaur or even a crocodylian, but is now considered a possible ankylosaur.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} fossils of megalodon are its teeth. Diagnostic {{characteristics}} include a triangular shape, robust structure, large size, fine serrations, {{a lack of}} lateral denticles, and a visible V-shaped neck (where the root meets the crown). The tooth met the jaw at a steep angle, similar to the great white shark. The tooth was anchored by connective tissue fibers, and the roughness of the base may have added to mechanical strength. The lingual side of the tooth, the part facing the tongue, was convex; and the labial side, {{the other side of}} the tooth, was slightly convex or flat. The anterior <b>teeth</b> <b>were</b> almost perpendicular to the jaw and symmetrical, whereas the posterior <b>teeth</b> <b>were</b> slanted and asymmetrical.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{the very}} high-crowned (hypsodont) sudamericids, ferugliotheriid <b>teeth</b> <b>were</b> low-crowned (brachydont). Furthermore, sudamericid molariforms {{tend to be}} larger and are {{supported}} by one large root, but the smaller ferugliotheriids {{have at least two}} roots under their molariforms. Ferugliotherium is estimated to have weighed 70g (2.5oz).|$|E
25|$|As {{a general}} rule, extant herbivores with low-crowned <b>teeth</b> <b>are</b> {{predominantly}} browsers and species with high-crowned <b>teeth</b> <b>are</b> predominantly grazers.|$|R

50|$|Pointed <b>teeth</b> <b>are</b> {{best suited}} to grazing on algal tissue, whereas blunt <b>teeth</b> <b>are</b> {{preferable}} if feeding habits entail scraping epiphytes from surfaces.|$|R
5|$|In 2010, Whitlock et al. {{described}} a juvenile skull {{at the time}} referred to Diplodocus (CM11255) that differed greatly from adult skulls of the same genus: its snout was not blunt, and the <b>teeth</b> <b>were</b> {{not confined to the}} front of the snout. These differences suggest that adults and juveniles were feeding differently. Such an ecological difference between adults and juveniles had not been previously observed in sauropodomorphs.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the teeth}} found with the holotype {{specimen}} were not {{attached to the}} skull; a few remained in the upper jaw, and only small replacement <b>teeth</b> <b>were</b> in the lower jaw. The teeth had the shape of recurved cones, flattened somewhat sideways. The larger <b>teeth</b> <b>were</b> less recurved than the smaller ones, but were otherwise uniform. The roots were very long, and the teeth slender. The carinae (edges) of the <b>teeth</b> <b>were</b> finely serrated with denticles {{on the front and}} back. There were seven narrow, uniform denticles per millimetre (0.039in), more than in most theropods. Some of the <b>teeth</b> <b>were</b> fluted, with six to eight ridges along the length of their inner sides and fine-grained enamel. The inner side of each tooth row had a bony wall. The number of teeth was large, with seven teeth in the right premaxilla (other theropods have three to five) and thirty-two in the dentary, where sixteen is typical. The lower jaw would have had sixty-four teeth, and the difference between the number of teeth in the upper and lower jaws is more pronounced than in other theropods. The teeth in the dentary were more densely packed than those in the maxilla, and probably smaller. The terminal rosette in the upper jaw had thirteen dental alveoli (tooth sockets), six on the left and seven on the right side; the first four were large (with the second and third the largest), while the fourth and fifth progressively decreased in size. The diameter of the largest was twice that of the smallest. The first four alveoli of the dentary (corresponding to the tip of the upper jaw) were the largest, with the rest more regular in size. Interdental plates were between the alveoli.|$|E

They grew in columns, with an observed maximum of six in each, {{and the number of}} columns varied based on the animal's size. Known column counts for the two species are: 51 to 53columns per maxilla and 48 to 49 per dentary (teeth of the upper jaw being slightly narrower than those in the lower jaw) for E. regalis; and 52columns per maxilla and 44 per dentary for E. annectens (an E. saskatchewanensis specimen).|$|E

40|$|The {{incidence}} of natal <b>teeth</b> <b>is</b> approximately 1 : 2, 000 to 1 : 3, 000 live births. The most commonly affected <b>teeth</b> <b>are</b> the lower primary central incisors.

The majority of natal teeth represent the early eruption of normal primary deciduous dentition. Less than 10 % of natal <b>teeth</b> <b>are</b> supernumerary. Natal <b>teeth</b> might resemble normal primary dentition in size and shape; however, the <b>teeth</b> <b>are</b> often smaller, conical and yellowish, and have hypoplastic enamel and dentin with poor or absent root formation. Complications include discomfort during suckling, sublingual ulceration, laceration of the mother's breasts and aspiration of the teeth.

5|$|Tyrannosaur teeth could crush bone, and {{therefore}} could extract as much food (bone marrow) {{as possible from}} carcass remnants, usually the least nutritious parts. Karen Chin and colleagues have found bone fragments in coprolites (fossilized feces) that they attribute to tyrannosaurs, but point out that a tyrannosaur's <b>teeth</b> <b>were</b> not well adapted to systematically chewing bone like hyenas do to extract marrow.|$|E
5|$|Tyrannosaur tooth marks are {{the most}} {{commonly}} preserved feeding traces of carnivorous dinosaurs. They have been reported from ceratopsians, hadrosaurs and other tyrannosaurs. Tyrannosaurid bones with tooth marks represent about 2% of known fossils with preserved tooth marks. Tyrannosaurid <b>teeth</b> <b>were</b> used as holdfasts for pulling meat off a body, rather than knife-like cutting functions.

5|$|Young et al. (2012) used biomechanical {{modelling}} {{to examine the}} performance of the diplodocine skull. It was concluded that the proposal that its dentition was used for bark-stripping was not supported by the data, which showed that under that scenario, the skull and teeth would undergo extreme stresses. The hypotheses of branch-stripping and/or precision biting were both shown to be biomechanically plausible feeding behaviors. Diplodocine <b>teeth</b> <b>were</b> also continually replaced throughout their lives, usually in less than 35 days, as was discovered by Michael D'Emic et al. Within each tooth socket, as many as five replacement <b>teeth</b> <b>were</b> developing to replace the next one. Studies of the teeth also reveal that it preferred different vegetation from the other sauropods of the Morrison, such as Camarasaurus. This may have better allowed the various species of sauropods to exist without competition.|$|E

50|$|The {{condition}} {{is thought to}} be due to trauma or possibly a delay in tooth eruption relative to bone remodeling gradients during the period in which <b>tooth</b> <b>is</b> forming.

5|$|A {{specimen}} of Pinacosaurus preserves large paraglossalia (triangular bones or cartilages {{located in the}} tongue) which show signs of muscular stress, and it is {{thought this was a}} common feature of ankylosaurs. The researchers who examined the specimen suggested that ankylosaurs relied heavily on muscular tongues and hyobranchia (tongue bones) when feeding, since their <b>teeth</b> <b>were</b> fairly small and were replaced at a relatively slow rate. Some modern salamanders have similar tongue bones, and use prehensile tongues to pick up food. Based on the broadness of the ribcage, Ankylosaurus may have digested through a hindgut fermentation system like modern herbivorous lizards, which have several chambers in their enlarged colon.|$|E
5|$|A {{study of}} D. horneri skulls suggest that unlike many depictions of tyrannosaurids, this genus and likely other tyrannosaurids did not possess lips. Comparisons {{of the skull}} of this species with modern {{crocodiles}} show the same rugose bone structure that indicates the presence of large flat scales as opposed to lips. As the rough texture descends almost to the tooth line, it is theorized that Daspletosaurus <b>teeth</b> <b>were</b> not covered by lips, as {{there would have been}} no room for such soft tissue.|$|E
5|$|Archaeologic records {{indicate}} that dogs {{were present in}} the Society Islands from the period of initial settlement up to the point of European contact. Modern digs in Tahiti and the other Society Islands have uncovered few surviving remains of the Tahitian Dog. In 1960, a few canine <b>teeth</b> <b>were</b> uncovered at Ana Paia shelter, on Mo'orea. In 1962, a complete skull, limbs, and vertebrae were discovered at a marae site on Mo'orea along with a jawbone at another site on the same island.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tooth</b> loss <b>is</b> {{a process}} in which one or more teeth come loose and fall out. <b>Tooth</b> loss <b>is</b> normal for {{deciduous}} teeth (baby <b>teeth),</b> when they <b>are</b> replaced by a person's adult teeth. Otherwise, losing <b>teeth</b> <b>is</b> undesirable and is the result of injury or disease, such as dental avulsion, tooth decay, and gum disease.

50|$|This dinosaur {{also had}} heterodont {{dentition}} {{in the upper}} jaw, meaning that the <b>teeth</b> <b>are</b> differently shaped depending on {{their position in the}} jaw.

5|$|Lavanify is a {{mammalian}} genus {{from the}} late Cretaceous (probably Maastrichtian, about 71 to 66 million years ago) of Madagascar. The only species, L.miolaka, is known from two isolated teeth, {{one of which is}} damaged. The <b>teeth</b> <b>were</b> collected in 1995–1996 and described in 1997. The animal is classified as a member of Gondwanatheria, an enigmatic extinct group with unclear phylogenetic relationships, and within Gondwanatheria {{as a member of the}} family Sudamericidae. Lavanify is most closely related to the Indian Bharattherium; the South American Sudamerica and Gondwanatherium are more distantly related. Gondwanatheres probably ate hard plant material.|$|E
5|$|The {{lower jaw}} was slender {{and had no}} mandibular fenestra, {{a hole in the}} side of the lower jawbone {{commonly}} seen in archosaurs. The <b>teeth</b> <b>were</b> small but sharp, suited for its diet of small vertebrates and possibly other small animals, such as insects. Its frontmost teeth (those on the premaxilla) were unserrated, unlike those further back in the jaw which were flattened and more strongly recurved. Scientists have used these dental characteristics to identify Compsognathus and its closest relatives. Reisdorf and Wuttke (2012) described the taphonomical phenomena of the German specimen of Compsognathus.|$|E
