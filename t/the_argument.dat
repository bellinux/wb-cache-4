5|$|<b>The</b> <b>argument</b> from {{morality}} {{is an argument}} {{for the existence of}} God. Arguments from morality tend to be based on moral normativity or moral order. Arguments from moral normativity observe some aspect of morality and argue that God is the best or only explanation for this, concluding that God must exist. Arguments from moral order are based on the asserted need for moral order to exist in the universe. They claim that, for this moral order to exist, God must exist to support it. <b>The</b> <b>argument</b> from {{morality is}} noteworthy in that one cannot evaluate the soundness of <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> without attending to almost every important philosophical issue in meta-ethics.|$|E
5|$|Critics of <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> include Averroes, who {{objected to}} its methodology, Al-Ghazali, who {{disagreed}} with its characterization of God, and modern critics who state that its piecemeal derivation of God's attributes {{allows people to}} accept parts of <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> but still reject God's existence. There is no consensus among modern scholars on the classification of the argument; some {{say that it is}} ontological while others say it is cosmological.|$|E

40|$|The {{precondition}} of "lifelong learning" and "adult education" since 1980 s in Japan {{has been}} "diversification of learning opportunity". But {{the concept of}} "diversification of learning opportunity" has been unclear. So it must be examined in detail. To examine it, <b>the</b> <b>arguments</b> from 1930 s (which influenced <b>the</b> <b>arguments</b> after World War II) to 1970 s about adult education need to be reexamined. Concretely, <b>the</b> following <b>arguments</b> need to be reexamined : <b>the</b> <b>arguments</b> about <b>the</b> relation between "Education" and "Society", <b>the</b> <b>arguments</b> about "Structure" of adult education, and <b>the</b> <b>arguments</b> about integrating "Subject of education and learning" "Con tents of education" and "Methods of educating"...|$|R

5|$|Plantinga's {{free will}} defense begins by asserting that Mackie's {{argument}} failed {{to establish an}} explicit logical contradiction between God {{and the existence of}} evil. In other words Plantinga shows that (1-4) are not on their own contradictory, and that any contradiction must originate from an atheologian's implicit unstated assumptions, assumptions representing premises not stated in <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> itself. With an explicit contradiction ruled out, an atheologian must add premises to <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> for it to succeed. Nonetheless, if Plantinga had offered no further argument then an atheologian's intuitive impressions that a contradiction must exist would have remain unanswered. Plantinga sought to resolve this by offering two further points.|$|E
5|$|Related to <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> from {{morality}} is <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> from conscience, associated with eighteenth-century bishop Joseph Butler and nineteenth-century cardinal John Henry Newman. Newman {{proposed that the}} conscience, as well as giving moral guidance, provides evidence of objective moral truths which must be supported by the divine. He argued that emotivism is an inadequate explanation of the human experience of morality because people avoid acting immorally, even when it might be in their interests. Newman proposed that, to explain the conscience, God must exist.|$|E

5|$|Thomas Aquinas, while proposing five proofs of God's {{existence}} in his Summa Theologica, objected to Anselm's argument. He suggested that people cannot know {{the nature of}} God and, therefore, cannot conceive of God in the way Anselm proposed. The ontological argument would be meaningful only to someone who understands the essence of God completely. Aquinas reasoned that, as only God can completely know His essence, only He could use <b>the</b> <b>argument.</b> His rejection of the ontological argument caused other Catholic theologians to also reject <b>the</b> <b>argument.</b>|$|E

5|$|A related {{objection}} is {{that evolution}} {{is based on}} unreliable evidence, claiming that evolution is not even well-evidenced.

5|$|All {{variations}} of <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> from morality {{begin with an}} observation about moral thought or experiences and conclude with the existence of God.

5|$|Another {{possible}} {{argument that}} has been proposed by C. S. Lewis is <b>the</b> <b>Argument</b> from Reason: if, as monism implies, all of our thoughts are the effects of physical causes, then {{we have no reason}} for assuming that they are also the consequent of a reasonable ground. Knowledge, however, is apprehended by reasoning from ground to consequent. Therefore, if monism is correct, there would be no way of knowing this—or anything else—we could not even suppose it, except by a fluke.|$|E
40|$|Functional logic {{programming}} languages have a functional syntax and use narrowing as operational semantics.

[HLW 92, JMM 92]) also use this idea, but they sacrify laziness in order to avoid inefficiency.
