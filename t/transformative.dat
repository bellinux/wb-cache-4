5|$|Haley's {{contribution}} to the work is notable, and several scholars discuss {{how it should be}} characterized. In a view shared by Eakin, Stone and Dyson, psychobiographical writer Eugene Victor Wolfenstein writes that Haley performed the duties of a quasi-psychoanalytic Freudian psychiatrist and spiritual confessor. Gillespie suggests, and Wolfenstein agrees, that the act of self-narration was itself a <b>transformative</b> process that spurred significant introspection and personal change in the life of its subject.|$|E
5|$|Integral {{elements}} of sustainability are {{research and innovation}} activities. A telling example is the European environmental research and innovation policy. It aims at defining and implementing a <b>transformative</b> agenda to greening {{the economy and the}} society as a whole so to make them sustainable. Research and innovation in Europe are financially supported by the programme Horizon 2020, which is also open to participation worldwide.|$|E
5|$|The {{application}} of the Johnson–Corey–Chaykovsky reaction in organic synthesis is diverse. The reaction has come to encompass reactions of many types of sulfur ylides with electrophiles well beyond the original publications. It has seen use {{in a number of}} high-profile total syntheses, as detailed below, and is generally recognized as a powerful <b>transformative</b> tool in the organic repertoire.|$|E
5|$|The {{war was a}} <b>transformative</b> {{experience}} for Truman that brought out his leadership qualities. He had entered the service in 1917 as a family farmer who had worked in clerical jobs that did not require the ability to motivate and direct others, but during the war he gained leadership experience and a record of success that greatly enhanced and supported his post-war political career in Missouri.|$|E
5|$|Arkham Origins was {{considered}} an incremental installment for the series, rather than a <b>transformative</b> one. GameSpot said that Arkham City expanded on Arkham Asylum by applying the game mechanics to a larger open-world setting, but criticized Arkham Origins for replicating Arkham City without moving the series forward. Other critics agreed, saying that the game's well-received elements from the previous game were not significantly developed or augmented and it was routine rather than inspired. However, other reviewers rated it {{on a par with}} Arkham City.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1930s, the talkies were a global phenomenon. In the United States, they helped secure Hollywood's {{position}} {{as one of}} the world's most powerful cultural/commercial centers of influence (see Cinema of the United States). In Europe (and, to a lesser degree, elsewhere), the new development was treated with suspicion by many filmmakers and critics, who worried that a focus on dialogue would subvert the unique aesthetic virtues of soundless cinema. In Japan, where the popular film tradition integrated silent movie and live vocal performance, talking pictures were slow to take root. In India, sound was the <b>transformative</b> element that led to the rapid expansion of the nation's film industry.|$|E
5|$|Clinton {{traveled}} to 79countries during this time, breaking the mark for most-traveled first lady held by Pat Nixon. She {{did not hold}} a security clearance or attend National Security Council meetings, but {{played a role in}} U.S. diplomacy attaining its objectives. A March 1995 five-nation trip to South Asia, on behest of the U.S. State Department and without her husband, sought to improve relations with India and Pakistan. Clinton was troubled by the plight of women she encountered, but found a warm response from the people of the countries she visited and gained a better relationship with the American press corps. The trip was a <b>transformative</b> experience for her and presaged her eventual career in diplomacy.|$|E
5|$|Like many of Verne's novels, {{the play}} is deeply imbued with themes of initiation, echoing the {{traditional}} mythic pattern of a young hero coming of age and reaching maturity through a dangerous and <b>transformative</b> journey. In Journey Through the Impossible, the young Georges, initially trapped by obsessions {{similar to those that}} drove his father mad, resolves his inner torments during a harrowing series of experiences in which Ox and Volsius compete as substitute father-figures. Both father-figures are highly symbolic: Ox is a sinister tempter representing knowledge and science, balancing the Guardian Angel Volsius.|$|E
5|$|On October 26, 1996, a {{well-known}} gaming clan, the Rangers, surprised the Quake community with Diary of a Camper, the first widely known machinima film. This short, 100-second demo file contained {{the action and}} gore of many others, but {{in the context of}} a brief story, rather than the usual deathmatch. An example of <b>transformative</b> or emergent gameplay, this shift from competition to theater required both expertise in and subversion of the game's mechanics. The Ranger demo emphasized this transformation by retaining specific gameplay references in its story.|$|E
5|$|The 2012 {{phenomenon}} was a {{range of}} eschatological beliefs that cataclysmic or otherwise <b>transformative</b> events would occur on or around 21 December 2012. This date was regarded as the end-date of a 5,126-year-long cycle in the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar, and as such, festivities to commemorate the date took place on 21 December 2012 in the countries {{that were part of}} the Maya civilization (Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador), with main events at Chichén Itzá in Mexico, and Tikal in Guatemala.|$|E
5|$|The most {{prominent}} themes are the anti-war and environmental {{focus of the}} film. Nausicaä, the heroine, believes {{in the value of}} life regardless of its form and through her actions stops a war. Loy and Goodhew state there is no evil portrayed in the film, but the Buddhist roots of evil: greed, ill will and delusion. Fear is what drives the conflicts, the fear of the poisoned forest results in the greed and resentment. Nausicaä, {{in addition to being a}} <b>transformative</b> force, leads people to understand and respect nature which is portrayed as welcoming, spiritual, and restorative for those who enter it peacefully.|$|E
5|$|Cloud Gate is {{described}} as a <b>transformative,</b> iconic work. It is similar to many of Kapoor's previous works in the themes and issues it addresses. While the sculpture's mirror effects are reminiscent of fun-house fairground mirrors, they also have a more serious intent; they help dematerialize this very large object, making it seem light and almost weightless. Cloud Gate is considered Kapoor's most ambitious use of complex mirrored form dynamics. Kapoor challenges his viewers to internalize his work through intellectual and theoretical exercise. By reflecting the sky, visiting and non-visiting pedestrians and surrounding architecture, Cloud Gate limits its viewers to partial comprehension at any time. The interaction with the viewer who moves to create his own vision gives it a spiritual dimension. The sculpture {{is described}} as a disembodied, luminous form, which is also how his earlier 1000 Names (197980) was described when it addressed the metaphysical and mystical.|$|E
5|$|During the 1960s and 1970s, as {{a result}} of both {{production}} peaks in some nations and political instability in others, the world's supply of petroleum tightened leading to an energy crisis during the 1970s and early 1980s. Petroleum prices rose dramatically, greatly benefiting Texas, particularly as compared {{to other parts of the}} U.S. that faced recession during this time. A new economic boom emerged which, though not as <b>transformative</b> as the early 1900s, pushed the population of Texas to the point that, by the end of the century, Texas was the second most populous state in the nation. Some sources, in fact, use the phrase Texas oil boom to refer to this later period rather than the earlier period that followed Spindletop.|$|E
5|$|Scientific {{investigation}} {{has resulted in}} several culturally <b>transformative</b> shifts in people's view of the planet. In the West, belief in a flat Earth was displaced {{by the idea of}} spherical Earth, credited to Pythagoras in the 6th century BC. Earth was further believed {{to be the center of}} the universe until the 16th century when scientists first theorized that it was a moving object, comparable to the other planets in the Solar System. Due to the efforts of influential Christian scholars and clerics such as James Ussher, who sought to determine the age of Earth through analysis of genealogies in Scripture, Westerners before the 19th century generally believed Earth to be a few thousand years old at most. It was only during the 19th century that geologists realized Earth's age was at least many millions of years.|$|E
5|$|Bewick {{made use}} of his close {{observation}} of nature, his remarkable visual memory, and his sharp eyesight to create accurate and extremely small details in his wood engravings, which proved to be both a strength and a weakness. If properly printed and closely examined, his prints could be seen to convey subtle clues {{to the character of}} his natural subjects, with humour and feeling. This was achieved by carefully varying the depth of the engraved grooves to provide actual greys, not only black and white, as well as the pattern of the marks to provide texture. But this subtlety of engraving created a serious technical difficulty for his printers; they needed to ink his blocks with {{just the right amount of}} ink, mixed so as to be of exactly the right thickness, and to press the block to the paper slowly and carefully, to obtain a result that would satisfy Bewick. Not surprisingly, this made printing slow and expensive. It also created a problem for Bewick's readers; if they lacked his excellent eyesight, they needed a magnifying glass to study his prints, especially the miniature tail-pieces. But the effect was <b>transformative,</b> and wood engraving became the main method of illustrating books for a century. The quality of Bewick's engravings attracted a far wider readership to his books than he had expected: his Fables and Quadrupeds were at the outset intended for children.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect of}} the {{maritime}} fur trade on native Hawaiians {{was similar to that}} of the North West Coast natives, but more powerfully <b>transformative.</b> The Hawaiians were generally receptive to Western incursion and settlement. The rise of King KamehamehaI and the unification of the islands under his rule were made possible in part by the effects of the maritime fur trade and its larger Pacific scope. The influx of wealth and technology helped make the new Kingdom of Hawaii relatively strong, in political and economic terms. Many non-native foodstuffs were introduced to the Hawaiian Islands during the early trading era, including plants such as beans, cabbage, onions, squash, pumpkins, melons, and oranges, as well as cash crops like tobacco, cotton, and sugar. Animals introduced included cattle, horses, sheep, and goats. Due to its high fertility Oahu became the most important of the islands. By the 1820s the population of Honolulu was over 10,000. The native Hawaiian population suffered waves of epidemic disease, including cholera. The availability of alcohol, especially grog and gin, led to widespread boozing and an increased use of traditional kava intoxication. These health issues, plus warfare related to the unification of the islands, droughts, and sandalwooding taking precedence over farming all contributed to an increase in famines and a general population decline. By 1850 the native population had dropped by perhaps 50%.|$|E

25|$|Critical and <b>transformative</b> perspective. Citizenship {{is defined}} by being a member with rights and responsibilities. Therefore, GCED must {{encourage}} active involvement. GCED can be taught from a critical and <b>transformative</b> perspective, whereby students are thinking, feeling, and doing. In this approach, GCED requires students to be politically critical and personally <b>transformative.</b> Teachers provide social issues in a neutral and grade-appropriate way for students to understand, grapple with, and do something about.|$|E
25|$|Mann wrote Seven Components of <b>Transformative</b> Organizing Theory and Playbook for Progressives: 16 Qualities of the Successful Organizer. His {{theory of}} <b>transformative</b> {{organizing}} is when organizers work to radically transform the system, {{to transform the}} consciousness of the people they are organizing, and are transformed in the struggle to change the society.|$|E

25|$|Two of {{the most}} <b>transformative</b> {{technologies}} of the century were widely introduced during the early decades: electrification, powered by high pressure boilers and steam turbines and automobiles and trucks powered by the internal combustion engine.|$|E
25|$|By {{contrast}} to Europe, the flexible nature of US copyright law, {{and in particular}} fair use means that content mining in America, {{as well as other}} fair use countries such as Israel, Taiwan and South Korea is viewed as being legal. As content mining is <b>transformative,</b> that is it does not supplant the original work, it is viewed as being lawful under fair use. For example, as part of the Google Book settlement the presiding judge on the case ruled that Google's digitisation project of in-copyright books was lawful, {{in part because of the}} <b>transformative</b> uses that the digitisation project displayed - one being text and data mining.|$|E
25|$|In eastern Cameroon, {{the term}} used for {{witchcraft}} among the Maka is djambe and {{refers to a}} force inside a person; its powers may make the proprietor more vulnerable. It encompasses the occult, the <b>transformative,</b> killing and healing.|$|E
25|$|Often subtractive, additive, deformative, or <b>transformative</b> {{methods are}} {{combined}} in whatever ways are advantageous.

25|$|Many modern {{theories}} of syntax do not acknowledge {{movement in the}} <b>transformative</b> sense, nonetheless the term wh-movement (or wh-fronting or wh-extraction) survives and is widely used to denote the observed phenomenon even by those theories that do not acknowledge movement.|$|E

25|$|So, in {{a period}} just over 30 years, the early {{dramatic}} rise of nuclear power went into equally meteoric reverse. With no other energy technology {{has there been a}} conjunction of such rapid and revolutionary international emergence, followed so quickly by equally <b>transformative</b> demise.|$|E
25|$|Giddens also {{stressed}} the importance of power, which is means to ends, and hence is directly involved in the actions of every person. Power, the <b>transformative</b> capacity of people to change the social and material world, is closely shaped by knowledge and space-time.|$|E
25|$|Like many American {{educators}} of his era, Davis firmly {{believed in}} the <b>transformative</b> power of scientific progress, frequently expressing effusive pride in the role Cooperative Extension had played as a change agent in mechanizing Southern farming and rendering it more efficient and profitable.|$|E
25|$|Linear {{operators}} are ubiquitous {{in the theory}} of quantum mechanics.
