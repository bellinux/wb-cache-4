By the mid-20th century, however, they had lost their preeminent position. The private automobile had replaced the railroad for short passenger trips, while the airplane had usurped it for long-distance travel, especially in the United States. Railroads remained effective, however, for transporting people in high-volume situations, such as commuting between the centres of large cities and their suburbs, and medium-distance travel of less than about 300 miles between urban centres.|$|E

25|$|Self-sufficiency had {{traditionally}} been a powerful stimulus for exploring and developing the country's huge, yet widely dispersed, resource base. It remained {{a source of}} national pride that the Soviet Union, alone among <b>the</b> <b>industrialized</b> <b>countries</b> of the world, could claim the ability to satisfy almost all the requirements of its economy using its own natural resources. The abundance of fossil fuels supplied not just the Soviet Union's domestic needs. For many years, an ample surplus was exported to consumers in Eastern Europe and Western Europe, where it earned most of the Soviet Union's convertible currency.|$|E
25|$|Starting in the 1880s, {{birth rates}} began to drop {{steadily}} in <b>the</b> <b>industrialized</b> <b>countries,</b> as women married later {{and families in}} urban living conditions increasingly favoured having fewer children. This trend was particularly acute in the United Kingdom, where birth rates declined from almost 35.5 births per 1,000 in the 1870s to about 29 per 1,000 by 1900. While the cause is uncertain, the 29% decline within a generation shows that the birth control methods Victorian women used were effective. Many women were educated about contraception and how to avoid pregnancy. While the rhythm method was not yet understood, condoms and diaphragms made of vulcanized rubber were reliable and inexpensive.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the main}} {{concerns}} for <b>the</b> newly <b>industrialized</b> <b>countries</b> toward trade liberalization is that technology spillover from exporting the high-tech intermediate goods will benefit the final goods production in other developing countries. Furthermore, those developing countries will then compete with <b>the</b> newly <b>industrialized</b> <b>countries</b> in exporting <b>the</b> final goods to other countries. This paper establishes a three-country theoretical model that has considered those “side effects” mentioned above to simulate the effects of trade liberalization on a newly <b>industrialized</b> <b>country,</b> which has <b>the</b> comparative advantage in producing high-tech intermediate goods. The model shows that when <b>the</b> newly <b>industrialized</b> <b>country</b> liberalizes <b>the</b> export of the high-tech intermediate goods to the developing country, the latter’s export of the final good to the third country becomes more competitive and the global welfare level goes up. However, the welfare level for <b>the</b> newly <b>industrialized</b> <b>country</b> might go down since its export of the final good is hampered. To partially internalize the benefit from the specialization, <b>the</b> newly <b>industrialized</b> <b>country</b> can also liberalize the import of the final good from the developing country at the same time. The model also shows that when both countries play a simultaneous move game on their respective trade policies, there are many possible policy combinations that are welfare-improving for both countries compared to the Nash equilibrium outcome. This suggests that instead of letting both countries interact strategically without negotiation, the role of some trade agreements would be crucial...|$|R

Emissions in Russia and Ukraine have decreased fastest since 1990 due to economic restructuring in these countries.|$|E
