De Gray received a 1203 missive from Innocent III decrying the marriages of some secular clergy, in contravention of canon law. In more secular matters, he granted the town of Bishop's Lynn (now King's Lynn) the right to hold a weekly market and two fairs per year. He also built a palace at Gaywood.|$|E

5|$|Experimental research: The {{researcher}} isolates {{a single}} social process and reproduces it {{in a laboratory}} (for example, by creating a situation where unconscious sexist judgements are possible), seeking {{to determine whether or}} not certain social variables can cause, or depend upon, other variables (for instance, seeing if people's feelings about traditional gender roles can be manipulated by the activation of contrasting gender stereotypes). Participants are randomly assigned to different groups that either serve as controls—acting as reference points because they are tested with regard to <b>the</b> <b>dependent</b> variable, albeit without having been exposed to any independent variables of interest—or receive one or more treatments. Randomization allows the researcher to be sure that any resulting differences between groups are the result of the treatment.|$|E
5|$|Harrison quickly saw the {{enactment}} of <b>the</b> <b>Dependent</b> and Disability Pension Act in 1890, a cause he had championed while in Congress. In addition to providing pensions to disabled Civil War veterans (regardless of the cause of their disability), the Act depleted some of the troublesome federal budget surplus. Pension expenditures reached $135million under Harrison, the largest expenditure of its kind to that point in American history, a problem exacerbated by Pension Bureau commissioner James R. Tanner's expansive interpretation of the pension laws. An investigation into the Pension Bureau by Harrison's Secretary of Interior John W. Noble found evidence of lavish and illegal handouts under Tanner. Harrison, who privately believed that appointing Tanner had been a mistake, due to his apparent loose management style and tongue, asked Tanner to resign and replaced him with Green B. Raum. Raum was also accused of accepting loan payments in return for expediting pension cases. Harrison, having accepted a dissenting Congressional Republican investigation report that exonerated Raum, kept him in office {{for the rest of}} his administration.|$|E
5|$|Possessive pronouns {{exist in}} {{dependent}} and independent forms; <b>the</b> <b>dependent</b> form {{functions as a}} determiner specifying a noun (as in my chair), while the independent form can stand alone {{as if it were}} a noun (e.g. the chair is mine). The English system of grammatical person no longer has a distinction between formal and informal pronouns of address, and the forms for 2nd person plural and singular are identical except in the reflexive form. Some dialects have introduced innovative 2nd person plural pronouns such as y'all found in Southern American English and African American (Vernacular) English or youse and ye found in Irish English.|$|E

5|$|The Mycenaean economy, {{given its}} pre-monetary nature, {{was focused on}} the {{redistribution}} of goods, commodities and labor by a central administration. The preserved Linear B records in Pylos and Knossos indicate that the palaces were closely monitoring a variety of industries and commodities, the organization of land management and the rations given to <b>the</b> <b>dependent</b> personnel. The Mycenaean palaces maintained extensive control of the nondomestic areas of production through careful control and acquisition and distribution in the palace industries, and the tallying of produced goods. For instance, the Knossos tablets record c. 80,000-100,000 sheep grazing in central Crete, and the quantity of the expected wool from these sheep and their offspring, as well as how this wool was allocated. The archives of Pylos display a specialized workforce, where each worker belonged to a precise category and was assigned to a specific task in the stages of production, notably in textiles.|$|E

40|$|The {{linguistic}} {{notions of}} head and dependents (arguments and adjuncts) {{are central to}} essentially all theories of syntax.

40|$|Introduction: The {{convalescence}} units (CU) of the National Network for Continuous Care (NNCC) are {{a health}} resort whose main {{objective is to}} promote the autonomy reconstruction for dependent people. Objectives: 1) To know the evolution of <b>the</b> <b>dependents</b> hospitalized in CU; 2) identify significant relationships among the main variables defining <b>the</b> <b>dependents</b> health profile. Methods: An exploratory study of quantitative and longitudinal profile. The sample includes all <b>the</b> <b>dependents</b> hospitalized in two CU of the coverage area of a Local Coordinator Team at Health Center Cluster of northern Portugal (N = 124), referenced in the timeline of March 1 to July 31, 2014. Applied the form “Profile of <b>the</b> <b>dependents</b> Integrated on Care Providers of the NNCC” on admission and at clinic discharge. Results: The most referenced medical diagnoses were osteoarthrosis/arthropathy/hip fracture (41. 9 %) and stroke (31. 5 %). Of the 97 cases in the sample {{in which it was}} possible to assess the level of dependency and bodily processes, between admission and clinic discharge: 1) 1 % worsened, 3. 1 % remained and 95. 9 % improved the dependency level; 2) 6. 2 % worsened, 17. 5 % remained and 76. 3 % improved bodily processes. The overall average of the “dependent autonomy reconstruction potential” and “family caregiver potential to take care” were respectively, 20. 3 and 35. 4. Performed tests of inferential analysis statistically significant between the main variables of the study. Conclusions: The results of this study confirm the importance of the work done by health professionals at CU, where nurses {{play an important role in}} rebuilding <b>the</b> <b>dependents</b> autonomy...|$|R
