5|$|Two large reservoirs, Shasta Lake and Trinity Lake, {{are formed}} {{by a pair}} of dams in the {{mountains}} north of the Sacramento Valley. Water from both of these lakes are released into the Sacramento River, which flows to the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, at controlled rates. There, before it can flow on to San Francisco Bay and the Pacific Ocean, some of the water is intercepted by a diversion channel and transported to the Delta-Mendota Canal, which conveys water southwards through <b>the</b> <b>San</b> <b>Joaquin</b> Valley, supplying water to San Luis Reservoir (a SWP-shared facility) and <b>the</b> <b>San</b> <b>Joaquin</b> River at Mendota Pool in the process, eventually reaching canals that irrigates farms in the valley. Friant Dam crosses <b>the</b> <b>San</b> <b>Joaquin</b> River upstream of Mendota Pool, diverting its water southwards into canals that travel into the Tulare Lake area of <b>the</b> <b>San</b> <b>Joaquin</b> Valley, as far south as the Kern River. Finally, New Melones Lake, a separate facility, stores water flow of a San Joaquin River tributary for use during dry periods. Other smaller, independent facilities exist to provide water to local irrigation districts.|$|E

5|$|About 1.22million years ago, <b>the</b> <b>San</b> <b>Joaquin</b> Hills {{along the}} Orange County coast began their uplift along a blind thrust fault (<b>the</b> <b>San</b> <b>Joaquin</b> Hills blind thrust) {{extending}} south from the Los Angeles Basin. As Aliso Creek was an antecedent stream, {{or one that}} had formed prior to the mountains' uplift, it cut a water gap through the rising mountains that today is Aliso Canyon. The same phenomenon occurred to the north with Laguna Canyon and San Diego Creek, and to the south at San Juan Creek. The uplift also caused Aliso Creek's largest tributary, Sulphur Creek, to turn north to join Aliso Creek instead of flowing south to Salt Creek. The Wisconsinian era was responsible for shaping the watershed to its present-day form, with deep side canyons and broad alluvial valleys.|$|E

50|$|With {{the help}} of <b>the</b> South <b>San</b> <b>Joaquin</b> Chamber of Commerce, the Bulletin {{expanded}} into a standard-size weekly newspaper on June 3, 1910, when it was moved from Stockton to Ripon.

5|$|The CVP {{also has}} several dams on <b>the</b> <b>San</b> <b>Joaquin</b> River—which has far less average flow than the Sacramento—in order to divert its water to {{southern}} Central Valley aqueducts. The Friant Dam, completed in 1942, {{is the largest}} component of the Friant Division of the CVP. The dam crosses <b>the</b> <b>San</b> <b>Joaquin</b> River where it spills out of the Sierra Nevada, forming Millerton Lake, which provides water storage for San Joaquin Valley irrigators {{as well as providing}} a diversion point for a pair of canals, the Friant-Kern Canal and the Madera Canal. The Friant-Kern Canal sends water southwards through the Tulare Lake area to its terminus at Bakersfield on the Kern River, supplying irrigation water to Tulare, Fresno, and Kern counties. The Madera Canal takes water northwards to Madera County, emptying into the Chowchilla River.|$|E

5|$|In recent years, a {{combination}} of drought and regulatory decisions passed based on the Endangered Species Act of 1973 have forced Reclamation to turn off much of the water for {{the west side of}} <b>the</b> <b>San</b> <b>Joaquin</b> Valley {{in order to protect the}} fragile ecosystem in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and keep alive the dwindling fish populations of Central Valley rivers.|$|E

5|$|Irrigation {{with water}} from the Merced River {{continued}} to grow substantially until most of the arable land around the river, some , was under cultivation. By the late 1950s and early 1960s, irrigation in <b>the</b> <b>San</b> <b>Joaquin</b> Valley was {{to such an extent}} that many of the rivers ran dry in sections. Upriver of the Merced River confluence with <b>the</b> <b>San</b> <b>Joaquin,</b> the latter river was usually dry, only regaining flow where the Merced River enters. In the mid-20th century, the flow in the Merced River diminished to such a degree that very few salmon returned to spawn in the lower section of the Merced River. In 1991, a fish hatchery, the Merced River Hatchery, was built beside the Merced River just downstream of the Crocker-Huffman Diversion Dam, the lowermost Merced River dam. Fall chinook salmon travel up a fish ladder into the hatchery's pools, which are supplied with water diverted from the Merced River.|$|E

5|$|In 1874 and 1875, Alexander was {{assigned}} to a board examining the problem of keeping the Mississippi River Delta from silting up and becoming an impediment to ship traffic. During {{the course of his}} tenure on the board, he traveled to Europe in order to examine European solutions to the problem. At the end of 1875, Alexander was asked by the state government of California to examine a proposed irrigation project in <b>the</b> <b>San</b> <b>Joaquin</b> Valley. Busy with other projects, Alexander appointed an associate, William Hammond Hall, to head the project.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to these environmental problems, Congress passed in 1992 the Central Valley Project Improvement Act (CVPIA), Title 34 of Public Law 102-575, to change water management practices in the CVP in order to lessen the ecological impact on <b>the</b> <b>San</b> <b>Joaquin</b> and Sacramento Rivers. Actions mandated included the release of more water to supply rivers and wetlands, funding for habitat restoration work (especially for anadromous fish spawning gravels), water temperature control, water conservation, fish passage, increasing the service area of the CVP's canals, and other items.|$|E
5|$|Large-scale {{irrigation}} {{was introduced}} to <b>the</b> <b>San</b> <b>Joaquin</b> Valley in the late 19th century, {{and led to the}} construction of numerous state, federal and privately owned dams, which blocked migrating salmon and caused a large decline in riparian habitat. Diversion of water for irrigation often reduces the river to a small stream by the time it reaches its mouth. Efforts to mitigate environmental damage include habitat conservation work, re-establishment of historic streamflow patterns, and the construction of a salmon hatchery.|$|E

5|$|Although European foxes were {{introduced}} to portions of the United States in the 1900s recent genetic investigation indicates an absence of European fox haplotypes in any North American populations.

5|$|Cagney {{was accused}} of being a {{communist}} sympathizer in 1934, and again in 1940. The accusation in 1934 stemmed from a letter police found from a local Communist official that alleged that Cagney would bring other Hollywood stars to meetings. Cagney denied this, and Lincoln Steffens, husband of the letter's writer, backed up this denial, asserting that the accusation stemmed solely from Cagney's donation to striking cotton workers in <b>the</b> <b>San</b> <b>Joaquin</b> Valley. William Cagney claimed this donation was the root of the charges in 1940. Cagney was cleared by U.S. Representative Martin Dies Jr., on the House Un-American Activities Committee.|$|E
