[...] The Gripen, like the Viggen, was designed to operate as one component of a networked national defence system, which allows for automatic exchange of information in real-time between Gripen aircraft and ground facilities. [...] According to Saab, the Gripen features [...] "the world's most highly developed data link". The Gripen's Ternav tactical navigation system combines information from multiple onboard systems such as the air data computer, radar altimeter, and GPS to continuously calculate the Gripen's location.|$|E

40|$|An {{evaluation}} method is developed for single blow experiments with liquids on heat exchangers. The method {{is based on}} the unity Mach number dispersion model.

Calculations on an example confirm that one single blow test alone cannot provide reliable values of the unknowns. A second test with a liquid of differing heat capacity is required, or a tracer experiment for the measurement of the Peclet number. A modified method is developed for gases.

The low bandgap metal-containing polymers were synthesized by Suzuki cross-coupling polycondensation or Stille coupling polymerization.

These functionalized charge <b>transfer</b> <b>units</b> not only broadened the absorption spectrum, but also functioned as a bidentate ligand. Upon the complexation of rhenium(I) pentacarbonyl chloride, the absorption spectrum of the resulting polymers was further boardened, and the bandgap was reduced. The material design of this work has opened up a new approach in developing low bandgap metal-containing polymers as light harvesting materials. (Reprented Fig.) © 2010 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

40|$|In this paper, an {{algebraic}} formulation which {{expresses the}} dimensionless rate of entropy generation {{as a function}} of the heat exchanger geometry (number of <b>transfer</b> <b>units),</b> the thermal-hydraulic characteristics (friction factor and Colburn j-factor), and the operating conditions (heat transfer duty, core velocity, coil surface temperature, and fluid properties) is derived. It is shown that for heat exchanger with constant wall temperature (i. e., condensers and evaporators), there does exist a particular number of <b>transfer</b> <b>units</b> which minimizes the dimensionless rate of entropy generation. An algebraic expression for the optimum heat exchanger effectiveness, based on the working conditions, heat exchanger geometry and fluid properties, is also presented. The theoretical analysis led to the conclusion that a high effectiveness heat exchanger does not necessarily provide the best thermal-hydraulic design...|$|R
40|$|A strong analogy {{exists between}} heat {{exchangers}} and osmotic mass exchangers. The effectiveness-number of <b>transfer</b> <b>units</b> (ε-NTU) method is well-known for the sizing and rating of heat exchangers. A similar method, called the effectiveness-mass <b>transfer</b> <b>units</b> (ε-MTU) method, is developed for reverse osmosis (RO) mass exchangers. Governing equations for an RO mass exchanger are nondimensionalized assuming ideal membrane characteristics and a linearized {{form of the}} osmotic pressure function for seawater. A closed form solution is found which relates three dimensionless groups: the number of mass <b>transfer</b> <b>units,</b> which is an effective size of the exchanger; a pressure ratio, which relates osmotic and hydraulic pressures; and the recovery ratio, which is the ratio of permeate to inlet feed flow rates. A novel performance parameter, the effectiveness of an RO exchanger, {{is defined as a}} ratio of the recovery ratio to the maximum recovery ratio. A one-dimensional numerical model is developed to correct for the effects of feed-side external concentration polarization and nonlinearities in osmotic pressure as a function of salinity. A comparison of model results to experimental data found in the literature resulted in an average error of less than 7. 8 %. The analytical ε-MTU model can be used for design or performance evaluation of RO membrane mass exchangers. Center for Clean Water and Clean Energy at MIT and KFUPMNational Science Foundation (U.
