40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Boston UniversityWhen tertrahydrofurfuryl alchohol {{is passed}} over alumina at {{temperatures}} between 300 and 360 degrees celcius a unique rearrangement occurs. Instead {{of a simple}} dehydration of the alcohol, a ring expansion is observed. The product is dihydropyran. If {{it is assumed that}} the first step involves the removal of the hydroxyl group from the <b>tetrahydrofurfuryl</b> <b>alcohol</b> by the alumina to give a carbonium ion, then shift of the heterocyclic oxygen atom followed by loss of a proton would give the six-membered ring product, dihydropyran. It is also possible that instead of the oxygen atom migrating the carbon atom at the 3 -position of the <b>tetrahydrofurfuryl</b> <b>alcohol</b> might shift to the external methylene carbon. Loss of a proton would also give dihydropyran. The path of the rearrangement can be followed if <b>tetrahydrofurfuryl</b> <b>alcohol</b> labeled with carbon- 14 in the external methylene group is utilized. If the heterocyclic oxygen shifts the resulting dihydropyran will be labeled at the 2 -position. On the other hand, if the 3 -carbon atom shifts the dihydropyran will be labeled at the 3 -position. It was considered possible that both paths might be operativen, so that the dihydropyran would be labeled at the 2 - and 3 -positions.
