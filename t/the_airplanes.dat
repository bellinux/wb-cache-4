5|$|In June 1915, {{passengers}} on Batavier II witnessed {{an attack by}} two German airplanes against a British steamship between the Galloper and the North Hinder Lightships. The attack was broken off when two British airplanes arrived over the ship to engage the German aircraft; none of <b>the</b> <b>airplanes</b> were destroyed, and the ship was unscathed.|$|E
5|$|During {{the night}} of 21 January 1971, a force of 100 PAVN/Viet Cong commandos {{attacked}} Pochentong airfield, the main base of the Khmer Air Force. In this one action, the raiders destroyed almost the entire inventory of government aircraft, including all of its fighter planes. This {{may have been a}} blessing in disguise, however, since the air force was largely composed of old (even obsolete) Soviet aircraft. The Americans soon replaced <b>the</b> <b>airplanes</b> with more advanced models. The attack did, however, stall a proposed FANK offensive. Two weeks later, Lon Nol suffered a stroke and was evacuated to Hawaii for treatment. It had been a mild stroke, however, and the general recovered quickly, returning to Cambodia after only two months.|$|E
5|$|Formerly {{known as}} the Kamloops Aero Club, the Kamloops Flying Club {{operates}} at the airport, which is a club where children receive a flight in an airplane with the pilot and learn about <b>the</b> <b>airplanes</b> themselves. In addition, the flight school Canadian Flight Centre is based on site; the branch based in Boundary Bay, Delta opened a location in Kamloops in May2012 and uses Cessna aircraft for its lessons. Canadian Helicopters operates a training facility for the Kamloops Airport Other related facilities include Astaris Canada, CC Helicopters, Highland Helicopters and WestAir Aviation. Formerly, Flight Discovery operated as a flight school at the airport, but the owner was deemed a fraud artist.|$|E
50|$|An {{aircraft}} {{propulsion system}} must achieve two things. First, the thrust from the propulsion system must balance the drag of <b>the</b> <b>airplane</b> when <b>the</b> <b>airplane</b> is cruising. And second, the thrust from the propulsion system must exceed the drag of <b>the</b> <b>airplane</b> for <b>the</b> <b>airplane</b> to accelerate. In fact, {{the greater the}} difference between the thrust and the drag, called the excess thrust, <b>the</b> faster <b>the</b> <b>airplane</b> will accelerate.|$|R
50|$|As {{the pilot}} applied <b>the</b> brakes, <b>the</b> <b>airplane</b> veered to <b>the</b> left, {{and he was}} unable to keep the plane on the runway surface. <b>The</b> <b>airplane</b> {{continued}} off <b>the</b> left side of the runway, and the nose of <b>the</b> <b>airplane</b> struck a drainage ditch. <b>The</b> <b>airplane</b> sustained substantial damage to the fuselage.|$|R
50|$|During {{the high}} speed taxi, the pilot raised {{the nose of}} <b>the</b> <b>airplane</b> and it became airborne. <b>The</b> <b>airplane</b> climbed with a high angle of attack to {{approximately}} 100 feet. The pilot then reduced the power to idle and lowered <b>the</b> <b>airplane</b> nose. <b>The</b> <b>airplane</b> collided with <b>the</b> ground as the pilot attempted {{to recover from the}} inadvertent flight. During the collision with the ground the ballistic recovery parachute was deployed, and <b>the</b> <b>airplane</b> was dragged 200 feet off the runway.|$|R
5|$|Kennedy {{was in his}} Senate offices {{meeting with}} First Lady Laura Bush when the September 11, 2001, attacks took place. Two of <b>the</b> <b>airplanes</b> {{involved}} had taken off from Boston, and in the following weeks, Kennedy telephoned each of the 177 Massachusetts families who had lost members in the attacks. He pushed through legislation that provided healthcare and grief counseling benefits for the families, and recommended the appointment of his {{former chief of staff}} Kenneth Feinberg as Special Master of the government's September 11th Victim Compensation Fund. Kennedy maintained an ongoing bond with the Massachusetts 9/11 families in subsequent years.|$|E
5|$|The Penticton Flying Club {{operates}} at the airport, {{which is a}} club where children receive a flight in an airplane with the pilot, and learn about <b>the</b> <b>airplanes</b> themselves. In addition, the flight school Southern Skies Aviation is based on site; the school closed in 2011 and was reopened shortly after, when it was bought by Kittyhawk A/C Services. The former is also at the airport, serving as an aircraft maintenance centre. There is a radio navigation aid provided at the Penticton Regional Airport which is used by pilots on aircraft coming from other nearby airports to determine their location. The navigation system is owned by Nav Canada. The local and upcoming weather of Penticton is observed at this airport's weather station. Nav Canada has noted {{that most of the}} aircraft winds at the Penticton Regional Airport blow north and south.|$|E
5|$|On 23 March 1998, Braathens SAFE {{changed its}} name and {{corporate}} identity to Braathens. It introduced a new livery with a blue bottom, and replaced the Norwegian flag on the tail with an abstract, silver wing, that became the company's new logo. The re-branding {{was an attempt to}} create an international identity, and tone down the Norwegian national symbols that had been on <b>the</b> <b>airplanes</b> since 1946. At the same time, a two-class configuration was introduced: the 'Best' section, accounting for 70% of the planes capacity, received higher seat pitch, complimentary in-flight drinks, meals and newspapers, priority boarding and refundable tickets. The 'Back' section was for discount ticket holders, who received a no-frills service with a smaller seat pitch, and were located {{at the back of the}} aircraft behind a curtain. Best tickets became NOK300 more expensive, while it became easier to purchase discounted tickets. The scheme was, according to Erik G. Braathen, an attempt to differentiate between the full-fare customers, with whom Braathens was competing with SAS, and the low-fare customers, who Braathens was competing with Ryanair and the to-be established Color Air. The scheme as first introduced on the first 737-700 that was delivered.|$|E
50|$|In a {{straight}} flight, {{the tail of}} <b>the</b> <b>airplane</b> aligns <b>the</b> fuselage into the relative wind. However, {{in the beginning of}} a turn, when the ailerons are being applied in order to bank <b>the</b> <b>airplane,</b> <b>the</b> ailerons also cause an adverse yaw of <b>the</b> <b>airplane.</b> For example, if <b>the</b> <b>airplane</b> is rolling clockwise (from the pilot point of view), <b>the</b> <b>airplane</b> yaws to <b>the</b> left. It assumes a crab-like attitude relative to the wind. This is called a slip. The air is flowing crosswise over the fuselage. In order to correct this adverse slip, the pilot must apply rudder (right rudder in this example). If the pilot applies too much rudder, <b>the</b> <b>airplane</b> will then slip to the other side. This is called a skid.|$|R

5|$|The {{greatest}} number of fatalities involving one aircraft occurred in 1985 when 520 {{people died in the}} crash of Japan Airlines Flight 123. The most fatalities in an aircraft collision occurred during 1977 in the Tenerife airport disaster when 583 people were killed. The {{greatest number}} of fatalities from a midair collision occurred at the Charkhi Dadri mid-air collision, to the west of New Delhi, India on 12 November 1996 when a Saudi Arabian Airlines Boeing 747-100B en route from Delhi to Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, collided with Kazakhstan Airlines Ilyushin Il-76 en route from Chimkent, Kazakhstan to Delhi, killing all 349 people aboard both <b>the</b> <b>airplanes.</b> The 11 September 2001 (9/11) coordinated attack of the World Trade Center claimed not only 157 passengers and crew, but an estimated additional 2,500 victims. In 2012, Boeing released a study of worldwide commercial jet airplane accidents between 1959 and 2011 reporting 1,798 accidents, 603 categorized as fatal, which accounted for 29,025 on-board fatalities and an additional 1,173 ground or non-commercial aircraft collision deaths. The Boeing analysis suggests a decrease of commercial aviation accident fatality rates {{toward the end of the}} study period.|$|E

40|$|Abstract â€” In this paper, {{a visual}} servoing scheme is {{proposed}} to control an airplane during its landing. A linearized model of <b>the</b> <b>airplane</b> dynamics and decoupled visual features {{are used to}} build the control scheme. A desired trajectory which takes into account <b>the</b> <b>airplane</b> dynamic is designed. Coupling this trajectory and the control law enables <b>the</b> <b>airplane</b> to join its desired path. Then <b>the</b> <b>airplane</b> is controlled to follow the glide path, realize the flare manoeuvre and finally touchdown. Simulation results are obtained with a quite realistic flight simulator {{which is based on}} a non linear airplane dynamic model. They show that <b>the</b> <b>airplane</b> is able to land automatically by using visual data. I...|$|R

25|$|Schweizer {{produced}} the Grumman G-164 Ag Cat, a single-engine biplane agricultural aircraft originally developed by Grumman in the 1950s. Under {{the contract with}} Grumman the airplane was built almost continuously between 1957 and 1981. During {{this period of time}} Schweizer built 2,455 of <b>the</b> <b>airplanes.</b>|$|E
25|$|The pilot, who had VIP {{green card}} {{certification}} {{for excellence in}} flying, had switched <b>the</b> <b>airplanes</b> before the flight after having realized that the cockpit was not in order. The statement of the Chief of the General Staff, Gen. DoÄŸan GÃ¼reÅŸ, that the accident on that snowy day was caused by atmospheric icing was denied by the crash investigators.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{problems}} with this analysis. Surviving officers from the Japanese ships state there was no radio traffic to have been overheard by anyone: their radio operators had been left in Japan to send fake traffic, and all radio transmitters aboard the ships (even those in <b>the</b> <b>airplanes)</b> were physically disabled to prevent any inadvertent or unauthorized broadcast.|$|E

5000|$|The skid is more {{dangerous}} than the slip if <b>the</b> <b>airplane</b> is close to a stall. In the slip, the raised wing [...] - [...] the left one if <b>the</b> <b>airplane</b> is turning to the right [...] - [...] will stall before the lowered one, and <b>the</b> <b>airplane</b> will reduce <b>the</b> bank angle, which prevents the stall. In the skid, the lowered wing will stall before the raised one, and <b>the</b> <b>airplane</b> will tighten <b>the</b> turn, and the stall can develop to a spin.|$|R
40|$|The {{probable}} {{spin and}} recovery {{characteristics of the}} XSN 2 J- 1 air-plane have been estimated {{on the basis of}} the results of brief test a performed on a model of an airplane of somewhat similar design. The spin-recovery tail-parachute requirements for <b>the</b> <b>airplane</b> were also determined end, in addition, an analysis was made to determine the best method of emergency pilot escape during a spin. The results of the investigation indicate that the recovery characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>airplane</b> will be satisfactory for all probable loading conditions of <b>the</b> <b>airplane.</b> A 6 -foot-diameter tall parachute attached to a 30 -foot tow-line will be satisfactory as a spin-recovery device for emergency recovery from demonstration spins. If the occupants of <b>the</b> <b>airplane</b> decide to abandon <b>the</b> <b>airplane</b> in a spin, they should leave <b>the</b> <b>airplane</b> from <b>the</b> outboard side of the cockpit and as far rearward as possible...|$|R
25|$|In September 1952, Feightner {{returned}} to flight test as the development officer for Air Development Squadron Three (VX-3). VX-3 was located at NAS Atlantic City, New Jersey, and {{was responsible for}} testing fighter aircraft, systems, and munitions. In this new role, he tested aircraft systems (rather than <b>the</b> <b>airplanes</b> themselves) and determined what tactics would most effectively utilize those systems.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>airplanes</b> had no radios or navigational instruments. Only a {{very few}} of the large cities had landing fields. In summer the planes were {{equipped}} with pontoons for landing on lakes and rivers. Lake Spenard was the Anchorage pontoon base.

25|$|On September 11, 2001, Islamic {{terrorist}} hijackers {{linked to}} the jihadist organization Al-Qaeda piloted two hijacked passenger airliners into each of the twin 110 story World Trade Center towers. <b>The</b> <b>airplanes,</b> designated for transcontinental flights and therefore fully loaded with jet fuel, were hijacked mid-flight and intentionally crashed into the towers {{in the early morning}} hours of September 11. The crashes caused massive structural damage during impact, ripping gaping holes into the towers, and ignited raging fires, that caused both weakened towers to collapse in less than two hours. Together with a simultaneous attack on the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, and a failed plane hijacking that resulted in a plane crash in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, 2,977 victims died in the attacks.|$|E
25|$|After the war, having saved {{most of his}} wages, Kerkorian spent $5,000 on a Cessna. He {{worked as}} a general {{aviation}} pilot, and made {{his first visit to}} Las Vegas in 1944. After spending much time in LasVegas during the 1940s, Kerkorian quit gambling and in 1947 paid $60,000 for Trans International Airlines, which was a small air-charter service that flew gamblers from Los Angeles to Las Vegas. He then bid on some war surplus bombers, using money on loan from the Seagram family. Gasoline, and especially airplane fuel, was in short supply at the time, so he sold the fuel from the planes' tanks, paid off his loan, and still had <b>the</b> <b>airplanes.</b> He operated the airline until 1968 when he sold it for $104million to the Transamerica Corporation.|$|E
25|$|Both {{buildings}} collapsed symmetrically {{and more}} or less straight down, though there was some tilting of {{the tops of the}} towers and a significant amount of fallout to the sides. In both cases, the section of the building that had been damaged by <b>the</b> <b>airplanes</b> failed, which allowed the floors above the impact zone to fall onto the undamaged structure below. As the collapse progressed, dust and debris could be seen shooting out of the windows several floors below the advancing destruction, caused by the sudden rush of air from the upper levels. The first fragments of the outer walls of the collapsed North Tower struck the ground 11 seconds after the collapse started, and parts of the South Tower after 9 seconds. The lower portions of both buildings' cores (60 stories of WTC 1 and 40 stories of WTC 2) remained standing for up to 25 seconds after the start of the initial collapse before they too collapsed.|$|E
50|$|In the {{sideslip}} condition, <b>the</b> <b>airplane's</b> {{longitudinal axis}} remains {{parallel to the}} original flightpath, but <b>the</b> <b>airplane</b> no longer flies straight along its original track. Now, the horizontal component of lift forces <b>the</b> <b>airplane</b> to move sideways toward the low wing. This is the still-air, headwind or tailwind scenario. In case of crosswind, if the wing is lowered into the wind, the wind may push <b>the</b> <b>airplane</b> downwind and <b>airplane</b> may fly <b>the</b> original track. This is the sideslip approach technique used by many pilots in crosswind conditions without slipping. Other method is the crab-technique in which nose is pointed into {{the wind and the}} resulting drift keeps <b>the</b> <b>airplane</b> on <b>the</b> desired track. Wings are maintained level all the time.|$|R
5000|$|A {{rejected}} takeoff {{is normally}} performed {{only if the}} aircraft's speed is below the takeoff decision speed known as V1, which for larger multi-engine airplanes is calculated before each flight. Below the decision speed <b>the</b> <b>airplane</b> {{should be able to}} stop safely {{before the end of the}} runway. Above the decision speed, <b>the</b> <b>airplane</b> may overshoot <b>the</b> runway if the takeoff is aborted and therefore a rejected takeoff is normally not performed above this speed, unless there is reason to doubt <b>the</b> <b>airplane's</b> ability to fly. If a serious failure occurs or is suspected above V1 but <b>the</b> <b>airplane's</b> ability to fly is not in doubt, the takeoff is continued despite the (suspected) failure and <b>the</b> <b>airplane</b> will attempt to land again as soon as possible.|$|R
