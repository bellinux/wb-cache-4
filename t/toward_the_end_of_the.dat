5|$|Jurisprudence {{was taught}} in Latin, {{even in the}} law schools of the East, but <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fourth and the {{beginning}} of the 5th century, Latin was supplanted by Greek at Beirut, which was the long-established lingua franca of the eastern territories of the Roman Empire.

5|$|The {{original}} Mamilla Street {{extended from}} the Mamilla Pool to Jaffa Gate. Along this street, wealthy Arabs constructed homes, offices and stores in the 1800s. <b>Toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 19th century, and especially during the British Mandate era, the street became a fashionable commercial district. Both Arab and Jewish businessmen operated high-end shops for furniture, textiles, housewares, art, photography, and automobile showrooms.|$|E
5|$|A 2012 {{study on}} the effects of {{rainfall}} patterns and parasite infections on the body of the springbok in Etosha National Park observed that males and juveniles were in better health <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rainy season. Health of females was more affected by parasites than by rainfall; parasite count in females peaked prior to and immediately after parturition. Studies show that springbok host helminths (Haemonchus, Longistrongylus and Trichostrongylus), ixodid ticks (Rhipicephalus species), lice (Damalinia and Linognathus species). Eimeria species mainly affect juveniles.|$|E

5|$|In 1709, Abraham Darby I {{established}} a coke-fired blast furnace to produce cast iron, replacing charcoal, although continuing to use blast furnaces. The ensuing availability of inexpensive iron {{was one of}} the factors leading to the Industrial Revolution. <b>Toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 18th century, cast iron began to replace wrought iron for certain purposes, because it was cheaper. Carbon content in iron was not implicated as the reason for the differences in properties of wrought iron, cast iron, and steel until the 18th century.|$|E

Upset at being eliminated from the tournament, Jarrett responded by performing three piledrivers on The Kid after the match.|$|E

5|$|The {{source of}} many of these stories of Elagabalus's depravity is the Augustan History (Historia Augusta), which {{includes}} controversial claims.
