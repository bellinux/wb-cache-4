5|$|It {{was written}} in the L.A. sun on an {{afternoon}} with my friend David Poe. We were talking about how you sometimes know <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> better at love if only you were older. But you can't rush old. You have to be young and dumb and let time do its thing before you get the experience you need to handle love right.|$|E
2500|$|Filming did {{not begin}} immediately, but in a September 2006 interview, {{executive}} producer Mike Richardson said that 30 Days of Night would be shot on 35 mm film, though there had been discussion to shoot the film on Genesis. [...] In an interview prior to filming, Slade explained that the illustrations of the graphic novel's illustrator, Ben Templesmith, would be reflected in production design. Slade also considered Nelson's draft {{to be the most}} faithful to the graphic novel. He also stated his intention to make a [...] "scary vampire film", of which he didn't think there were many. [...] "The rest of them, they fall into all kinds of traps. We're {{going to try to do}} our best... and one of the ways we have to do it is be more naturalistic than the graphic novel, because it's very over-the-top," [...] said Slade. [...] There was also concern expressed that while the vampires needed to communicate, talking might lessen the effect. To counter this, a fictional vampire language, with click consonants, was constructed with the help of a professor of linguistics and the nearby University of Auckland. [...] Slade explained [...] "we designed this really simple language that didn't sound like any particular accent <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> aware of, that was based around really simple actions, eating, hunting, yes, no, really basic, because that's what vampires do." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Well, Jobson,' exclaims {{another member}} of the committee, with a sigh, 'who could have {{supposed}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> an enemy?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He told me <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> sure to {{come and}} walk with us, and we have all been saying <b>that</b> <b>you</b> had disappeared." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I <b>would</b> steer <b>you</b> so {{straight}} {{a course}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> soon <b>be</b> beyond his reach. Let us be off; I {{feel as if}} danger was near.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Do you know,' Stephen continued, 'I {{could almost}} have sworn <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> married before this time, from what I saw?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Welcome! I have {{expected}} you. You could not surprise old Miriam. The teraph {{told me last}} night <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> here....' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Indeed no. I {{have never}} turned against you. I have thought <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> better here than at Folking for the present.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Only that I {{should have}} thought <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> too guarded to have--have cared for any gentleman till--till he had shown that he cared for you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So am I, for {{the matter}} of <b>that.</b> Have <b>you</b> gone to your father's house to-day, so <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> able {{to see me in}} Queen's Gate?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, faithless one, we {{may have}} to wait the longer; though I feel <b>that</b> <b>you</b> alone <b>would</b> <b>be</b> happiest {{fighting}} up the hill with me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As {{much time}} as you can spare," [...] she promised him. [...] "I thought, though, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> busy tearing Miller bone from bone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... [Illustration: [...] "You believe, maybe, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> struck dead if {{you said}} the things that I do; but why ain't I struck dead?"] ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This is {{very unusual}} dissipation, isn't it?" [...] he asked. [...] "I never dreamed <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{likely to come}} into our little theatre." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a {{great deal}} of money to me. But <b>you</b> <b>would</b> want to get it back again. And in <b>that</b> way <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{regularly}} on the turf." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Well, not exactly. But he said <b>that</b> {{probably}} <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> glad {{to obtain}} {{a position on the}} stage. He said you were a very fair gymnast and tumbler.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By no means, sir," [...] the man replied. [...] "I {{told him}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> back until {{three or four}} o'clock, and he is quite content to wait." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear Watson," [...] {{said the}} well-remembered voice, [...] "I owe you a {{thousand}} apologies. I {{had no idea}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> so affected." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No;--only why did {{you stay}} all the evening with that stupid old woman, when you promised me <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> back in ten minutes?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes,--there was {{a promise}}, Lady Lovel; a promise as firmly spoken {{as when you}} told the late lord <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> his wife." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I don't {{know exactly}} what he says. He told me he would {{introduce}} me to <b>you,</b> and <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would,</b> he <b>was</b> sure, do your best to put me through." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My cousin {{insisted on}} my coming with him, prince, and assured me <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> displeased at the liberty. But of course, I intend to quarter {{myself in the}} town." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "One would think," [...] {{said his}} lordship, [...] "that <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{glad to have}} the means of {{securing}} your mother from beggary. I imagined <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> in some measure gratified by my--my--my good intentions towards your family." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You have {{provoked}} the retort--were you convinced <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> happy with Arthur Carew, when you made {{up your mind}} to marry him so suddenly?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I knew that," [...] said Mrs. Tolbridge, [...] "when {{you told}} me in your note <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> obliged {{to stay with him}} all night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Welcome back, Oswald!" [...] {{the latter}} said, {{as he opened}} his door on hearing his footsteps. [...] "I had thought <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> longer away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'From all {{we hear it}} is not a {{very easy}} service,' said my cousin. 'I should have thought <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> very much more {{comfortable}} in England--and then <b>you</b> <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> so much safer also.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You don't seem energetic. I {{should have}} thought, {{even if you}} weren't {{supposed}} to buy or sell, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> all round the markets, enquiring about B. & I.'s this morning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now Jacques," [...] he {{said when}} he had finished, [...] "I thought <b>that</b> perhaps <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> more likely than any other man on board the three ships to {{volunteer}} for this work." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Lord!" [...] gasped Eustace, [...] "I had no {{idea that}} you were so particular; I thought perhaps <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> glad of the job." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Precisely. For instance, if {{you were}} to become {{absolutely}} discredited, I think <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> effectually out of my way. Your people do not forgive." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{all this}} is due to your intellect, Jav?" [...] asked Carthoris. [...] "I should think <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> high in the councils of your people." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Love!" [...] she said. It was {{too dark}} to see her face, but her voice sounded unpleasantly scornful. [...] "I shouldn't have thought <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> so {{conventional}} as <b>that.</b> <b>You</b> seemed different." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear Rose," [...] he said, [...] "you are an angel; {{and from}} my soul I congratulate the man <b>that</b> has got <b>you.</b> He <b>that</b> has <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> rich, if he lost the whole world." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And I {{ought to}} forgive you," [...] said Edmund, [...] "in {{consideration}} of the fulfilment of my prediction <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> able to leave the Lyddells when I was ready to receive you." ...|$|R
