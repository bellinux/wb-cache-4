50|$|Centrifugal casting is a {{metal casting}} {{technique}} {{that uses the}} forces of centripetal acceleration to distribute the molten material in the mold. Molten metal is typically fed into the mold using a spout. The process is then completed using rollers that rotate the mold about its axis causing the liquid metal to form to the mold and harden as the rotation continues. Rotation speeds and pouring rates are specific to the material being used and the design specifications. The <b>true</b> <b>centrifugal</b> <b>casting</b> technique can be performed using both vertical as well as horizontal rotation. The vertical rotation technique is generally used for the smaller parts whereas the longer parts are formed using the horizontal technique.|$|E

It has been reported that centrifugal technique is very useful for production of functionally graded porous membranes for gas permeable applications.

Micropores with diameters of 50, 100, and 200 m were machined at different linear densities in decellularized small intestine submucosa (SIS) planar sheets and tubular SIS scaffolds using an argon laser.

Three casting processes ?gravity <b>casting,</b> <b>centrifugal</b> <b>casting</b> and {{low pressure casting}} ?were compared {{in order to get}} the best process. The heat transfer coefficient of the casting/mold interface was determined using a reverse method. The simulated results of velocity, temperature and shrinkage porosity distribution were discussed in detail for the three casting processes. A smooth filling was found in all three casting processes, especially the low pressure casting exhibiting a better filling performance than the other two, but the solidification processes were different. The casting did not experience the sequential solidification, and the feeding paths were blocked, leading to shrinkage porosity defects in the riser and the bottom of the casting in gravity casting and in the upper zone of the casting in low pressure casting. While, the sequential solidification was well controlled in the solidification process of <b>centrifugal</b> <b>casting,</b> and majority of the shrinkage porosity defects can only be observed in the riser.
