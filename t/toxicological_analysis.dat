40|$|Introduction. Calcium channel {{blockers}} (CCBs) {{drugs are}} widely used {{in the treatment of}} cardiovascular diseases. CCB poisoning is associated with significant cardiovascular toxicity and is potentially fatal. Currently, there is no specific antidote and the treatment of CCB poisoning is supportive; however, this supportive therapy is often insufficient. We present a clinical case of severe diltiazem poisoning and the therapeutic approaches that were used. Case Report. A 55 -year-old male was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) after voluntary multiple drug intake, including extended release diltiazem (7200 [*]mg). The patient developed symptoms of refractory shock to conventional therapy and required mechanical ventilation, a temporary pacemaker, and renal replacement therapy. Approximately 17 hours after drug intake, hyperinsulinaemia-euglycaemia with lipid emulsion therapy was initiated, followed by progressive haemodynamic recovery within approximately 30 minutes. The <b>toxicological</b> serum <b>analysis</b> 12 [*]h after drug ingestion revealed a diltiazem serum level of 4778 [*]ng/mL (therapeutic level: 40 – 200 [*]ng/mL). Conclusions. This case report supports the therapeutic efficacy of hyperinsulinaemia-euglycaemia and lipid emulsion in the treatment of severe diltiazem poisoning...|$|R

40|$|A simple, {{fast and}} {{low-cost}} liquid–liquid extraction (LLE) method without a derivatization step for quantification of N-benzylpiperazine (BZP) in human plasma using a gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) technique was developed. Among the tested extraction agents {{the best results}} were obtained {{with the use of}} ethyl acetate at pH 12. Optimization of the gas chromatography conditions was conducted including split ratio, temperature gradient of the analytical column and injection volume. The main validation parameters of the proposed method were determined. The extraction recovery was 68 % with intra-day and inter-day precision (RSD%) below 5 % (n = 3). The limit of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) of BZP was 24. 8 and 82. 7 ng mL− 1, respectively. A linear calibration curve in the range from LOQ to 1000 ng mL− 1 was obtained {{with the use of the}} selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode with determination coefficient (r 2) higher than 0. 999.

Case report: A 58 -year-old man was referred to our hospital because of behavioral and cognitive changes formerly diagnosed as bvFTD.
