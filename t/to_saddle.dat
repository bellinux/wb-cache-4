5000|$|The {{sport is}} the one {{with one of the}} highest rates of injury and illness among all Paralympic sports.

[...] There is also a constant balance in developing equipment for para-equestrian to assure that the rider remains in control, and that they are not dragged along by the horse. One of the adaptions made <b>to</b> <b>saddles</b> for para-equestrian is extra padding. One of the companies that specializes in making saddles for people with disabilities is Superacor, Inc.

[...] "The Column Commander wishes to emphasise the necessity for the most vigorous aggressive action and to remind all commanders that their horses enable them to get quickly to the flank of the enemy - which should be the sole object in any operation."

2500|$|The first {{concerns}} a raider from Galloway, who {{set out to}} steal a horse. His mother warned him against theft on the land of St Bega, but her son was scornful and moving his hands to the private parts of his buttocks he tauntingly said, [...] "what can that little old woman do to me?" [...] As he escaped on the horse, arrows were fired after him as he crouched low, and the inevitable happened. The third concerns Godard of Millom, whose men would not remove their horses from the monks' pasture to which they had strayed. When the men came <b>to</b> <b>saddle</b> the horses, they found the hooves almost severed, and in penance Godard gave the field to the Monks. The seventh miracle tells of three men of Workington, who were imprisoned in Egremont Castle for killing {{a man in a}} drunken brawl, but having confessed their sins to St Bega, were rescued by her and found sanctuary at St Bees. The ninth miracle tells of two sick brothers who, after seeing a vision at Tynmouth, travelled to St Bees in a cart, and were healed; leaving the cart as thanks.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{debate has}} {{occurred}} {{over whether or}} not the goddess was an invention of Bede's, particularly in the 19th century before more widespread reconstructions of the Proto-Indo-European dawn goddess. Writing in the late 19th century, Charles J. Billson notes that scholars before his writing were divided about the existence of Bede's account of Ēostre, stating that [...] "among authorities who have no doubt as to her existence are W. Grimm, Wackernagel, Sinrock , and Wolf. On the other hand, Weinhold rejects the idea on philological grounds, and so do Heinrich Leo and Hermann Oesre. Kuhn says, 'The Anglo-Saxon Eostre looks like an invention of Bede;' and Mannhardt also dismisses her as an etymological dea ex machina." [...] Billson says that [...] "the whole question turns , upon Bede's credibility", and that [...] "one is inclined to agree with Grimm, that it would be uncritical <b>to</b> <b>saddle</b> this eminent Father of the Church, who keeps Heathendom at arms' length and tells us less of than he knows, with the invention of this goddess." [...] Billson points out that the Christianization of England started {{at the end of the}} 6th century, and, by the 7th, was completed. Billson argues that, as Bede was born in 672, Bede must have had opportunities to learn the names of the native goddesses of the Anglo-Saxons, [...] "who were hardly extinct in his lifetime." ...|$|E
