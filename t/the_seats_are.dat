5|$|Sabah (together {{with its}} {{neighbour}} of Sarawak) {{has a certain}} level of autonomy in administration, immigration, and judiciary which differentiates it from the West Malaysian Peninsula states. The Yang di-Pertua Negeri sits {{at the top of the}} hierarchy followed by the state legislative assembly and the state cabinet. It is the head of state although its functions are largely ceremonial. The chief minister is the head of government as well the leader of the state cabinet. The legislature is based on the Westminster system and therefore the chief minister is appointed based on his or her ability to command the majority of the state assembly. While local authorities being fully appointed by the state government owing to the suspension of local elections by the federal government. Legislation regarding state elections are within the powers of the federal government and not the state. The assembly meets at the state capital, Kota Kinabalu. Members of the state assembly are elected from 73 constituencies which are delineated by the Election Commission of Malaysia and may not necessarily result in constituencies of same voter population sizes. A general election representatives in the state assembly must be held every five years, when <b>the</b> <b>seats</b> <b>are</b> subject of universal suffrage for all citizens above 21 years of age. Sabah is also represented in the federal parliament by 25 members elected from the same number of constituencies.

40|$|Abstract. A new {{integrated}} {{child safety}} <b>seat</b> <b>is</b> {{presented in this}} paper. <b>The</b> <b>seat</b> <b>is</b> a two-mode <b>seat</b> for a motor vehicle cooperable with an adult seat belt assembly to provide two modes operation including an adult seat mode and a child <b>seat</b> mode. <b>The</b> <b>seat</b> locates in <b>the</b> center of <b>the</b> rear <b>seat.</b> <b>The</b> structure of <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>was</b> designed in detail. The height of the booster of <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> can <b>be</b> adjusted continuously according to <b>the</b> <b>seated</b> shoulder height of the child passenger. The depth of booster cushion also can be changed according {{to the size of}} the passenger. The sled test with <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>was</b> conducted. <b>The</b> <b>seat</b> simulation models with different booster heights were developed using MADYMO software and validated. Then, these models were used to study the performance of <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> in frontal impact. Some key parameters of <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>were</b> studied in simulation test. The results of the test and simulation show that <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> can provide effective protection for the children aged from 3 to 10 years in frontal impact...|$|R
