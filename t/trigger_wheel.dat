5000|$|The EDIS system's {{relative}} simplicity, {{in particular}} {{the fact that it}} does not require a cam sensor, makes it a popular choice for custom car builders and classic car owners looking to retrofit a modern ignition system to their vehicle. The crankshaft-mounted <b>trigger</b> <b>wheel,</b> VR sensor, EDIS Module and an ignition control computer can all be easily fitted to most older engines that originally used a traditional distributor for ignition.|$|E
5000|$|The A588 is the SOHC version {{found in}} most post 2001 Chrysler products. The ECB SOHC version, found in earlier models, is {{identical}} except for the crank <b>trigger</b> <b>wheel.</b> When equipped with the newer crank wheel for the new NGC engine computer, the A588 version cannot be directly transplanted into a vehicle originally equipped with the earlier style engine using an SBEC (Single Board Engine Controller). Output is [...] SAE (98 kW) at 5600 rpm with 130 lb·ft (177 N·m) of torque at 4600 rpm. It has an aluminum SOHC cylinder head. It uses a reinforced plastic intake manifold (although {{a few of the}} 1995 and 1996 engines received an aluminum intake manifold due to a shortage of the plastic parts). They were painted black, but it's easy to see the casting marks and prints on the manifold. The aluminum version is prized among enthusiasts as it's easy to port and polish for improved airflow characteristics.|$|E
5000|$|The M40 {{is shaped}} like a long tube with an M8C [...]50 cal {{spotting}} rifle above. The spotting rifle fires a round whose trajectory closely matches that of the 105 mm round and gives off {{a puff of smoke}} on impact with the target. On the left side, there is an elevating wheel, in the center of which is the <b>trigger</b> <b>wheel</b> used to fine adjust the elevation {{and at the same time}} firing the spotting rifle when pulled, and the gun when pushed. The mounting is a tripod, but the front leg has a castering wheel. On top of the mount is a traverse wheel. On the center of the traverse wheel is a locking wheel, when the wheel is down, the rifle is locked in traverse, and can only be moved right and left with the traverse wheel. When the wheel is raised, the rifle can be traversed by hand. Austria produced a two-wheeled mount for the M40.|$|E

50|$|In October 2012, Grosvenor {{introduced}} a new product to the casino industry, Pinball Roulette machines. The new machine offers single player roulette game and the ball is launched by a pinball-style <b>trigger</b> into the <b>wheel.</b> The main feature of the product is that it offered the player control over when they wished to spin the ball. Thirty of the machines, developed by Austrian Gaming Industries, were installed at 22 clubs across the UK.|$|R
5000|$|MS1/Extra is a {{firmware}} modification to {{the original}} Bowling and Grippo MegaSquirt written by Philip Ringwood and James Murray (with contributions from many more). As the name implies it adds ignition management, {{as well as a}} large number of other features such as boost control, nitrous, fan control, programmable outputs, water injection and more to MegaSquirt. Hardware modifications are required to run ignition and the learning curve is steeper than a fuel-only implementation, but many hundreds of users use the [...] "MS1/Extra" [...] firmware. The firmware was very actively developed and is now a stable alternative to the base MS code. Most MegaSquirt vendors ship the MS1/Extra firmware as standard on MS1 boards. The firmware is designed to operate using either a supported ignition system, such as GM HEI, or Ford EDIS, or it can decode certain <b>trigger</b> <b>wheel</b> signals from crank/cam sensor pickups and directly run wasted spark or coil on plug.|$|E
50|$|FSAE Michigan 2011 Dynamic EventsThe {{day before}} the {{competition}} was the first drive of RFR11 which {{ended up with the}} Electromotive ECU crank position sensor to move slightly inside the crank case, hitting the crank <b>trigger</b> <b>wheel,</b> which led to an engine failure. The sensor was replaced overnight and a new wheel was welded on. The engine was not fired until the 2nd day of the competition after the technical inspections. On the 3rd day, the engine fired ok for the first acceleration event but the starter wheel gave out (possibly due to a misalignment during installation). The team replaced the engine within 1.5 hours {{to make it to the}} AutoX event in the afternoon, but had to skip Skid-Pad event. First driver successfully completed the AutoX run and the second driver did not complete his 2nd run after the engine started over-heating due to an electrical failure on the radiator fan. FSAE Michigan 2011 EnduranceThe first driver completed the first half of the event with no problems. As he was getting out of the car, he instructed the second driver to be cautious and take it slow. The second driver conducted his stint at mainly part throttle and through corners would hold the clutch in and then keep the RPMs high due to the belief that the engine was dying. The car was running ok but the 2nd driver was black flagged and had to pull in because of a malfunctioning brake light switch. As pulling in the pit lane, the driver quickly realized the problem and was able to pull back the brake pedal with his foot in order to be able to finish the rest of the race. For the remaining of the race, the driver pulled the brake pedal back with his foot every time he hit the brakes, which resulted him with very slow laptimes. Since the car was not tuned well for the RPM range that the driver was keeping the car at, the car ran out of fuel and DNF'ed from Endurance 2 laps before it could finish.|$|E

50|$|After {{studying}} various all-wheel {{and four}} wheel drive systems offered by {{the wide variety of}} pickups on the market today, Honda engineers concluded that virtually every one had functional shortcomings and was undesirably bulky, and heavy. The direct result of that research was to use Honda's innovative fully automatic VTM-4 system. This system provides front-wheel drive for dry pavement cruising conditions and engages all-wheel drive when needed to improve stability or maneuverability. Unlike many competitive systems that use an engagement strategy <b>triggered</b> by <b>wheel</b> slippage, the Ridgeline's VTM-4 system anticipates the need for all-wheel drive and engages the rear wheels before slippage begins. Additional torque is redistributed to the rear for improved performance during acceleration, especially on low friction surfaces and during towing. The VSA system provides a limited-slip differential effect by applying braking force to a slipping front wheel thereby directing driving force to the wheel with more grip.|$|R
50|$|Lufthansa Flight 2904 {{was cleared}} to land at Okęcie International Airport Runway 11 and was {{informed}} {{of the existence of}} wind shear on the approach.http://www.rvs.uni-bielefeld.de/publications/Incidents/DOCS/ComAndRep/Warsaw/warsaw-report.html To compensate for the crosswind, the pilots attempted to touch down with the aircraft banked slightly to the right. Additionally they landed with a speed about 20 kn faster than usual. According to the manual, this was the correct procedure for the reported weather conditions, but the weather report was not up-to-date. At the moment of touchdown, the assumed crosswind {{turned out to be a}} tailwind. Due to the tailwind of approximately 20 kn and the increased speed, the airplane hit the ground at approximately 170 kn and far beyond the normal touch down point. The aircraft's right gear touched down 770 m from the runway 11 threshold. The left gear touched down 9 seconds later, 1525 m from the threshold. Only when the left gear touched the runway did the ground spoilers and engine thrust reversers start to deploy, these systems depending on oleo strut (shock absorber) compression. The <b>wheel</b> brakes, <b>triggered</b> by <b>wheel</b> rotation being equal to or greater than 72 kn, began to operate about 4 seconds later.|$|R
25|$|A {{fire alarm}} box is an outdoor device used for notifying a fire {{department}} of a fire. Early boxes used the telegraph system and were the main method of calling the fire department to a neighborhood {{in the days before}} people had telephones. When the box is <b>triggered,</b> a spring-loaded <b>wheel</b> spins and taps out a signal onto the fire alarm telegraph wire, indicating the box number. The receiver at a fire station then can match the number to the neighborhood. The municipal fire alarm system got its start in Massachusetts. It was invented by Moses G. Farmer, an engineer, and Dr. William Channing, a Harvard-educated Bostonian. Their revolutionary creation was installed in 1851 and consisted of 40 miles of wire and 45 boxes in Boston.|$|R
40|$|The New Small Wheel Upgrade for the ATLAS {{experiment}} {{will replace}} the innermost station of the Muon Spectrometer in the forward region {{in order to maintain}} its current performance during high luminosity data-taking after the LHC Phase-I upgrade. The New Small Wheel, comprising Micromegas and small Thin Gap Chambers, will reduce the rate of fake triggers coming from backgrounds in the forward region and significantly improve the Level- 1 muon trigger selectivity by providing precise on-line segment measurements with ∼ 1 mrad angular resolution. Such demanding precision, together with the short time (∼ 1 μs) to prepare trigger data and perform on-line reconstruction, implies very stringent requirements on the design of trigger system and trigger electronics. This paper presents an overview of the design of the New Small <b>Wheel</b> <b>trigger</b> system, trigger algorithms and processor hardware...|$|R
40|$|The Simon effect {{refers to}} an {{advantage}} when a stimulus 2 ̆ 7 spatial location corresponds to that of its response, even though stimulus location is irrelevant to the task. The Simon effect is typically attributed to spatial coding of the stimuli and responses. It is assumed that a stimulus automatically activates its spatially corresponding response, with this activation facilitating responding when that response is correct and interfering when it is not. Though the instructed action effect is usually produced {{in response to a}} stimulus, multiple irrelevant/unintended action effects associated with other response features may be activated as well, and the spatial codes of these actions can be in opposition. ^ Five experiments were conducted to investigate how irrelevant action effects influence response selection with a wheel in an auditory Simon task. Experiment 1 showed that a cursor <b>triggered</b> by the <b>wheel</b> response did not yield an overall Simon effect even with instructions emphasizing the cursor. Experiment 2 indicated that experience with a controlled cursor yielded an overall Simon effect even when the cursor was <b>triggered</b> by the <b>wheel</b> response, suggesting that subjects coded their responses in terms of cursor movement. A combined action effect hypothesis was proposed to account for the size change of the Simon effect with an opposite action effect. ^ Experiments 3, 4, and 5 were designed to test the hypothesis that the combined result of the action effects (relevant hand-movement and irrelevant cursor-movement) determines the direction {{and the size of the}} Simon effect. In Experiment 3, all six sequences of three display conditions were used, and a carryover effect from the controlled cursor to the triggered cursor was found. Thus, a sequence with increasing cursor involvement (no-cursor, triggered-cursor, and controlled-cursor) was selected for Experiments 4 and 5. The Simon effect was reduced in both experiments when there was a conflicting action effect. In Experiment 4, the reduction was due in part to individual differences in response-selection strategy. However, in Experiment 5, the reduction was due to the combination of conflicting action effects, supporting the hypothesis that this combination determines the direction and size of the Simon effect. ...|$|R
40|$|M. Ing. Adaptive {{traction}} control can greatly enhance {{the mobility of}} vehicles on varying road surfaces. Traction control includes Antilock Braking Systems (ABS) and Antislip Regulation Systems (ASR). During braking, wheel slip is controlled with ABS, while wheel slip during acceleration is controlled by an ASR. Since the friction between a vehicle's tyre and the road surface {{is a function of}} wheel slip, there is an optimum wheel slip value at which the best road holding performance can be achieved. This optimum wheel slip value will however change with differing road surfaces and vehicle speeds. Optimising the wheel slip values has several advantages: both vehicle stopping and acceleration distances can be optimised, vehicle handling during in-turn braking and acceleration are optimised and tyre wear is reduced. Currently there are various ABS and ASR systems available, with the common goal of optimising wheel slip. These systems are however mechanically complex, while the operation of both these systems is usually <b>triggered</b> when some <b>wheel</b> slip value is exceeded. Differing road surfaces can greatly influence the effectiveness of these systems. The central theme of this research is the development of a fuzzy logic control algorithm for vehicle {{traction control}}. The control algorithm is tested with an experimental setup. The operating conditions experienced by an ABS are closely simulated in order to study the feasibility of fuzzy logic for traction control. The results obtained indicates the viability of fuzzy logic for wheel slip control. Confirmation of these results, obtained with the experimental ABS, have to be validated during vehicle testing. The main goal is to improve the performances of existing traction control systems and the feasibility of fuzzy controllers in automobile applications...|$|R
40|$|The ABS (Anti-lock Braking System) is {{an active}} safety system that is {{designed}} for emergency braking situations. In an emergency braking scenario, the ABS instructs the disk-pad braking force to achieve the maximum available tyre-road braking force without locking the wheels. The maximum available tyre-road braking force helps to achieve the optimal braking distance, while the rotating wheels allow the vehicle to retain directional control capability, which allows the driver to avoid dangerous obstacles during an emergency braking scenario. This research has delivered a new and novel approach to ABS design, which could be developed at a low cost {{in a way which}} will benefit specialist and niche vehicle manufacturers alike. The proposed ABS control method combines the control logic from both theory-based ABS and commercialised ABS. Therefore, it is more practical compared to the theory-based ABS and less complex compared to a commercialised ABS. The control method only has two control phases with simple decrease, hold, and increase control actions. The proposed ABS control method uses representable tyre-road braking force data from an in-wheel-hub force measurement sensor as well as wheel angular acceleration data from a wheel angular speed sensor as control references. It uses the detected peak tyre-road braking force and its relative predefined drop percentage as control activation and control phase alternation <b>triggers.</b> It uses <b>wheel</b> angular acceleration to identify the control phase and implement the correct control actions. Zero wheel angular acceleration is used to trigger the hold control action in the first control phase, while wheel angular acceleration is used as an aid to increase the accuracy of the in-wheel-hub force sensor. An ADAMS full vehicle model based on a Subaru Impreza and a Simulink ABS control logic model have been used to establish a co-simulation environment to test the performance of the proposed ABS control method using high, low friction and split-mu road surfaces. The co-simulation results demonstrate that the proposed novel ABS control method satisfies the ABS control target, and its control results are similar to commercialised ABS...|$|R
