5|$|The idea {{of using}} aspirin to prevent {{clotting}} diseases (such as heart attacks and strokes) was revived in the 1960s, when medical researcher Harvey Weiss found that aspirin had an anti-adhesive effect on blood platelets (and unlike other potential antiplatelet drugs, aspirin had low toxicity). Medical Research Council haematologist John O'Brien picked up on Weiss's finding and, in 1963, began working with epidemiologist Peter Elwood on aspirin's anti-thrombosis drug potential. Elwood began a large-scale trial of aspirin as a preventive drug for heart attacks. Nicholas Laboratories agreed to provide aspirin tablets, and Elwood enlisted heart attack survivors in a double-blind controlled study—heart attack survivors were statistically {{more likely to suffer}} a second attack, greatly reducing the number of patients necessary to reliably detect whether aspirin had an effect on heart attacks. The study began in February 1971, though the researchers soon had to break the double-blinding when a study by American epidemiologist Hershel Jick suggested that aspirin prevented heart attacks but suggested that the heart attacks were more deadly. Jick had found that fewer aspirin-takers were admitted to his hospital for heart attacks than non-aspirin-takers, and one possible explanation was that aspirin caused heart attack sufferers to die before reaching the hospital; Elwood's initial results ruled out <b>that</b> <b>explanation.</b> When the Elwood trial ended in 1973, it showed a modest but not statistically significant reduction in heart attacks among the group taking aspirin.|$|E

Given <b>that,</b> <b>explanation</b> has been sought to account for the change in culture of the Britons to one where by the 8th Century the majority of people in southern Britain saw themselves as heirs to the Anglo-Saxon culture. Whilst the developments were rather complicated, there are two competing theories.|$|E
25|$|Science and {{religion}} {{are based on}} different aspects of human experience. In science, explanations {{must be based on}} evidence drawn from examining the natural world. Scientifically based observations or experiments that conflict with an explanation eventually must lead to modification or even abandonment of <b>that</b> <b>explanation.</b> Religious faith, in contrast, does not depend on empirical evidence, is not necessarily modified in the face of conflicting evidence, and typically involves supernatural forces or entities. Because they are not a part of nature, supernatural entities cannot be investigated by science. In this sense, science {{and religion}} are separate and address aspects of human understanding in different ways. Attempts to put science and religion against each other create controversy where none needs to exist.|$|E

500|$|The most {{commonly}} given {{answer is that}} we attribute consciousness to other people because we see that they resemble us in appearance and behavior; we reason that if they look like us and act like us, they must be like us in other ways, including having experiences {{of the sort that}} we do. [...] There are, however, a variety of problems with <b>that</b> <b>explanation.</b> [...] For one thing, it seems to violate the principle of parsimony, by postulating an invisible entity that is not necessary to explain what we observe. [...] Some philosophers, such as Daniel Dennett in an essay titled The Unimagined Preposterousness of Zombies, argue that people who give this explanation do not really understand what they are saying. [...] More broadly, philosophers who do not accept the possibility of zombies generally believe that consciousness is reflected in behavior (including verbal behavior), and that we attribute consciousness on the basis of behavior. [...] A more straightforward way of saying this is that we attribute experiences to people because of what they can do, including the fact that they can tell us about their experiences.|$|E

40|$|Much {{research}} on explanation {{has focused on}} the ability of explanations to draw upon relevant knowledge to aid in understanding some event or observation. However, explanations may also structure our understanding of events and related tasks more generally, even when they add no relevant information. In three experiments, we show <b>that</b> <b>explanations</b> affect performance in simple, binary decision tasks where they could not possibly add relevant information. Whereas people with no explanation for differences in event probabilities tended to “probability-match, ” people with an explanation tended to “over-match ” (behave more normatively).

40|$|A longstanding {{debate in}} the {{philosophy}} of action opposes causalists to anti-causalists. Causalists claim the authority of Davidson, who offered powerful arguments to the effect <b>that</b> intentional <b>explanations</b> must be causal explanations. Anti-causalists claim the authority of Wittgenstein, who offered equally powerful arguments to the effect that reasons cannot be causes. My aim in this paper is to achieve a rapprochement between Davidsonian causalists and Wittgensteinian anti-causalists by showing how both sides can agree that reasons are not causes, but <b>that</b> intentional <b>explanations</b> are causal explanations. To this end, I first defuse Davidson’s Challenge, an argument purporting to show <b>that</b> intentional <b>explanations</b> are best made sense of as being explanatory because reasons are causes. I argue that Wittgenstein furnishes anti-causalists with the means to resist this conclusion. I then argue that this leaves the Master Argument for the claim <b>that</b> intentional <b>explanations</b> are causal <b>explanations,</b> but <b>that</b> by distinguishing between a narrow and a wide conception of causal explanation, we can resolve the stalemate between Wittgensteinian anti-causalists impressed by the thought that reasons cannot be causes and Davidsonian causalists impressed by the thought <b>that</b> intentional <b>explanations</b> must be causal explanations...|$|R
40|$|It is {{reasonably}} well accepted <b>that</b> the <b>explanation</b> of intentional action is teleological explanation. Very roughly, {{an explanation of}} some event, E, is teleological only if it explains E by citing some goal or purpose or reason that produced E. Alternatively, teleological explanations of intentional action explain “by citing the state of affairs toward which the behavior was directed” thereby answering questions like “To what end was the agent’s behavior directed?” Causalism—advocated by causalists—is the thesis <b>that</b> <b>explanations</b> of intentional action are both causal and teleological. By contrast, non-causalism—advocated by non-causalists—is the thesis <b>that</b> <b>explanations</b> of intentional action are teleological but not causal. Familiarly, the problem of causal deviance plagues causalism. But while some have supposed {{that the problem is}} grave enough that causalism is bound to suffer a global breakdown, the rumors of causalism’s demise are greatly exaggerated. In what follows, I note that every instance of causal deviance is also an instance of teleological deviance and that teleological deviance is a problem for causalist and non-causalist alike, a problem that causalists may be better able to deal with. Or so I argue...|$|R
