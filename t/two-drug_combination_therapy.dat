40|$|Objectives of the Study: The aim of {{the study}} was to compare the {{efficacy}} and tolerability of different classes of antihypertensive drugs in diabetic and nondiabetic patients (NDPs) with essential hypertension. Material and Methods: The study was conducted in Mayo Hospital, Punjab Institute of Cardiology, and National Defence Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan, on 200 hypertensive patients with diabetes and 230 hypertensive patients without (Three hospitals) diabetes. Both male and female patients of age between 30 and 80 years with systolic blood pressure (SBP) above 130 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) above 80 mmHg were enrolled in the study. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), beta-blocker (βB), calcium-channel blocker (CCB), diuretics (D), angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) as well as α-blocker classes of antihypertensive drugs were used. These drugs were used as monotherapy as well as combination therapy. The study was conducted for 4 months (July–October). After 4 months, patients were assessed for efficacy by monitoring blood pressure (BP) and tolerability by assessing safety profile on renal function, liver function as well as lipid profile. Results: Significant control in mean BP by all drug groups was observed in “both groups that is patients with diabetes and without diabetes. ” The efficacy and tolerability data revealed that in diabetic patients with hypertension, the highest decrease in SBP and DBP was observed using monotherapy with ACEI, <b>two-drug</b> <b>combination</b> <b>therapy</b> with ACEI plus diuretic, ARBs plus diuretic, ACEI plus CCBs, three-drug combination therapy with ACEI plus CCBs plus diuretic, and four drug combination therapy with ACEI plus CCBs plus diuretic plus βBs, ARB's plus CCBs plus diuretic plus βBs while in NDPs, monotherapy with diuretic, <b>two-drug</b> <b>combination</b> <b>therapy</b> with ACEI plus CCBs, ACEI plus βBs, three-drug combination therapy with βBs plus ACEI plus D was found more effective in controlling SBP as well as DBP. Adverse effects observed were dry cough, pedal edema, dizziness, muscular cramps, constipation, palpitations, sweating, vertigo, tinnitus, paresthesia, and sexual dysfunction. Conclusion: All classes of antihypertensives were found to control blood pressure significantly in both groups of patients that is diabetic patients with hypertesion and non-diabetic patients with hypertension...|$|E

Methods: Using {{the data from the}} 2001, 2004, and 2008 Research on East Asia Psychotropic Prescription (REAP) studies, we compared the proportions of acute inpatients (stay < 6 months), new long-stay patients (6 months to 3 years), and old long-stay patients (≥ 3 years), the rates of excessive dosing (more than chlorpromazine 1, 000 mg equivalent) and polypharmacy (the coprescription of more than 1 antipsychotic). Findings: While the proportion of long-term inpatients increased over time in Chinese mainland and Taiwan, it decreased in Japan, Singapore and Hong Kong. The proportion of acute inpatients receiving more than one drug was highest in Singapore, followed by Japan, Korea and Chinese Mainland. <b>Two-drug</b> <b>combination</b> <b>therapy</b> was especially high in Singapore.

40|$|PURPOSE. This study {{describes}} the treatment in ordinary clinical practice in Spain {{of patients with}} glaucoma with a <b>two-drug</b> <b>combination</b> <b>therapy.</b> The authors present the treatment outcome as end-of-period intraocular pressure (IOP) and the calculated direct medical costs over a 2 -year period. METHODS. Data were extracted retrospectively from patient charts recording the use of all medical resources related to glaucoma. Costs were estimated using unit costs from public sources (2005). Descriptive cost analysis according to combination treatment at baseline was performed. RESULTS. The study included 216 patients from 21 centers. Around half of the patients were started on a beta-blocker/prostaglandin analogue combination, while the rest received various other combinations containing either an alpha 2 -agonist or a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. Across the seven groups considered, there was {{a statistically significant difference}} in the costs of the least and the two most costly groups, while the confidence intervals were overlapping in all other pairwise comparisons. The least costly drug combination was brimonidine/timolol. Assessing IOP at the end of follow-up, all the groups were equally effective (overlapping confidence intervals). In a multivariate regression analysis, the drug combination did not have an independent, significant impact on total direct medical costs, drug costs, or end-of-period IOP. Significant determinants of these variables were surgical interventions and one or more changes of drug combination during the follow-up. CONCLUSIONS. Costs are determined by the response to treatment. Inadequate response triggers treatment changes and sometimes eventually surgical interventions, thereby increasing costs significantly...|$|E

Manual correction of this mal-alignment has been associated with reduced arterial pressure. This pilot study tests the hypothesis that correcting mal-alignment of the Atlas vertebra reduces and maintains a lower BP. Using a double blind, placebo-controlled design at a single center, 50 drug naı̈ve (n 26) or washed out (n 24) patients with Stage 1 hypertension were randomized to receive a National Upper Cervical Chiropractic (NUCCA) procedure or a sham procedure. Patients received no antihypertensive meds during the 8 -week study duration. The primary end point was changed in systolic and diastolic BP compar-ing baseline and week 8, with a 90 % power to detect an 8 / 5 mm Hg difference at week 8 over the placebo group. The study cohort had a mean age 52. 779. 6 years, consisted of 70 % males. At week 8, there were differences in systolic BP (1779 mm Hg, NUCCA versus 3711 mm Hg, placebo; Po 0. 0001) and diastolic BP (10711 mm Hg, NUCCA versus 277 mm Hg; P 0. 002). Lateral displacement of Atlas vertebra (1. 0, baseline versus 0. 041 week 8, NUCCA versus 0. 6, baseline versus 0. 51, placebo; P 0. 002).

Due to incomplete equilibrium, retrodialysis is a method used to correct for relative recovery. The impact of <b>two-drug</b> <b>combinations</b> on probe recovery, however, remains unknown. Methods: In vitro microdialysis was conducted for five antibiotics (avibactam, cefepime, ceftaroline, piperacillin-tazobactam, and vancomycin), representing three empiric antimicrobial regimens, {{to assess the impact}} of <b>two-drug</b> <b>combinations</b> on probe recovery. Recoveries were compared between single and two-drug treatments. Results: Recoveries by gain and loss were linear with their molecular weight. During all gain experiments, recoveries were similar when tested alone or in combination with another antibiotic. Unacceptable differences in recovery by loss were observed for cefepime in the presence of vancomycin (- 21 %) and vancomycin in the presence of piperacillin-tazobactam (- 22 %). Conclusion: Differences among in vitro recovery by loss suggest <b>two-drug</b> <b>combinations</b> may impact dialysate recovery during in vivo retrodialysis procedures, particularly when larger molecular weight drugs (ie, vancomycin) are involved.

Secondary endpoint was: increase of physical performance tested by grip strength and 6 -min walk test. METHODS: Sixty eligible patients were randomly assigned to: arm 1, l-carnitine 4 g/day + Celecoxib 300 mg/day or arm 2, l-carnitine 4 g/day + celecoxib 300 mg/day + megestrol acetate 320 mg/day, all orally. All patients received as basic treatment polyphenols 300 mg/day, lipoic acid 300 mg/day, carbocysteine 2. 7 g/day, Vitamin E, A, C. Treatment duration was 4 months. Planned sample size was 60 patients. RESULTS: The results did not show a significant difference between treatment arms in both primary and secondary endpoints.

Materials and Methods: A retrospective study was carried out by evaluating 600 prescriptions of antidiabetic drugs over a period of 2 month obtained from pharmacy database of five general family clinics. The study assessed prescribing pattern for six classes of antidiabetic drugs: insulin, biguanides, sulfonylureas, glitazones, α-glucosidase inhibitors, and dipeptidyl peptidase- 4 (DPP- 4) inhibitors. Results: Of 600 prescriptions evaluated, 349 were of male patients and 251 were of female patients.

40|$|Most {{pathological}} processes involve complex molecular pathways {{that can}} only be modified or blocked by a combination of medications. <b>Combination</b> <b>therapy</b> has become a common practice in medicine. In ophthalmology, this approach has been used effectively to treat bacterial, fungal, proliferative/neoplastic, and inflammatory eye diseases and vascular proliferation. <b>Combination</b> <b>therapy</b> also encompasses the synergistic effect of electromagnetic radiation and medications. However, <b>combination</b> <b>therapy</b> can augment inherent complications of individual interventions, therefore vigilance is required. Complications of <b>combination</b> <b>therapy</b> include potential incompatibility among compounds and tissue toxicity. Understanding these effects will assist the ophthalmologist in his decision to maximize the benefits of <b>combination</b> <b>therapy</b> while avoiding an unfavorable outcome...|$|R

40|$|Moxifloxacin {{activity}} against Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) {{was evaluated}} in vitro against 25 strains. The MIC {{was determined to}} range from 0. 125 to 2. 0 μg/ml. In addition, U 937 macrophage monolayers infected with MAC strain 101 (serovar 1) were treated with moxifloxacin (0. 25 to 8 μg/ml) daily, {{and the number of}} intracellular bacteria was quantitated after 4 days. Moxifloxacin showed inhibitory activity at 0. 5 μg/ml and higher. To assess the activity of moxifloxacin containing regimens in vivo, we infected C 57 BL bg+/bg+ mice with 3 × 107 MAC strain 101 bacteria intravenously. One week later treatment was begun with the following: (i) moxifloxacin (50 mg/kg/day or 100 mg/kg/day), ethambutol (100 mg/kg/day), or a combination of moxifloxacin and ethambutol; or (ii) moxifloxacin (100 mg/kg/day), azithromycin (200 mg/kg/day), or rifabutin (40 mg/kg/day) as oral monotherapy; or (iii) all permutations of two-drug therapy or all three drugs in combination. All groups contained at least 14 animals, and the control group received the drug vehicle. After 4 weeks, quantitative blood cultures were obtained and the number of bacteria in liver and spleen was quantitated. Moxifloxacin, ethambutol, and azithromycin were active as single agents in liver, spleen, and blood. Rifabutin showed inhibitory activity only in the blood. <b>Two-drug</b> <b>combinations</b> containing azithromycin were no more active than azithromycin alone. Similarly, the three-drug combination was not more active than azithromycin alone in the spleen. Rifabutin did not add to the activity of any other single agent or <b>two-drug</b> <b>combination.</b> Moxifloxacin at both concentrations in combination with ethambutol was significantly more active than each drug alone...|$|R
40|$|Nelfinavir mesylate (formerly AG 1343) is {{a potent}} and selective, nonpeptidic {{inhibitor}} of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) protease that was discovered by protein structure-based design methodologies. We evaluated the antiviral and cytotoxic effects of <b>two-drug</b> <b>combinations</b> of nelfinavir with the clinically approved antiretroviral therapeutics zidovudine (ZDV), lamivudine (3 TC), dideoxycytidine (ddC; zalcitabine), stavudine (d 4 T), didanosine (ddI), indinavir, saquinavir, and ritonavir and a three-drug combination of nelfinavir with ZDV and 3 TC against an acute HIV- 1 strain RF infection of CEM-SS cells in vitro. Quantitative assessment of drug interaction was evaluated by a universal response surface approach (W. R. Greco, G. Bravo, and J. C. Parsons, Pharm. Rev. 47 : 331 - 385, 1995) and by the method of M. N. Prichard and C. Shipman (Antiviral Res. 14 : 181 - 206, 1990). Both analytical methods yielded similar results and showed that the <b>two-drug</b> <b>combinations</b> of nelfinavir with the reverse transcriptase inhibitors ZDV, 3 TC, ddI, d 4 T, and ddC and the three-drug combination with ZDV and 3 TC resulted in additive to statistically significant synergistic interactions. In a similar manner, the combination of nelfinavir with the three protease inhibitors resulted in additive (ritonavir and saquinavir) to slightly antagonistic (indinavir) interactions. In all combinations, minimal cellular cytotoxicity was observed with any drug alone and in combination. These results suggest that administration of combinations of the appropriate doses of nelfinavir with other currently approved antiretroviral therapeutic agents in vivo may result in enhanced antiviral activity with no associated increase in cellular cytotoxicity...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACTThe {{in-vitro}} {{activity of}} nikkomycin Z {{was investigated in}} combination with polyenes, triazoles or echinocandins against 20 clinical isolates of Aspergillus fumigatus with the fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) method. The drug interactions were classified as synergic (FICI ≤ 0. 5), no interaction (FICI > 0. 5, but FICI ≤ 4) or antagonistic (FICI > 4). The fungicidal activity of nikkomycin Z alone and in combination with a representative echinocandin (caspofungin) or triazole (voriconazole) was also examined with time-kill experiments and fungal cell viability assays. <b>Two-drug</b> <b>combinations</b> of nikkomycin Z with amphotericin B (FICI 3. 59 ± 0. 57), amphotericin B lipid complex (FICI 3. 95 ± 0. 74), liposomal amphotericin B (FICI 3. 62 ± 0. 98), itraconazole (FICI 2. 0 ± 0. 0), voriconazole (FICI 1. 07 ± 0. 37), posaconazole (FICI 2. 20 ± 0. 44) or ravuconazole (FICI 1. 76 ± 0. 44) showed no interactions, but the pairwise combination of nikkomycin Z with caspofungin (FICI 0. 22 ± 0. 19) or micafungin (FICI 0. 35 ± 0. 27) showed synergic activity against A. fumigatus. Time-kill studies and fungal cell viability assays showed that neither nikkomycin Z nor caspofungin alone possessed fungicidal activity against A. fumigatus, whereas {{a combination of these}} two drugs at concentrations ≥ 2 mg/L (≥ 0. 031 × the concentration of drug that produced no visible growth) killed germinated conidia within 24 h in a concentration-dependent manner. These data suggest that <b>two-drug</b> <b>combinations</b> of nikkomycin Z with echinocandins, but not with polyenes and triazoles, have a synergic effect against A. fumigatus...|$|R

50|$|In general, {{a person}} is {{considered}} to be a potential candidate for surgery if adequate trials of two first-line seizure medicines (ones that are commonly effective in controlling the type of seizures the person is experiencing) and one <b>two-drug</b> <b>combination</b> all have failed to control the seizures. A trial of a medication is considered adequate when it has been increased gradually to the maximum dosage that does not cause serious side effects and then is given for a long enough period. If the person has frequent seizures, any improvement will be obvious after a short time. If the seizures generally occur far apart, however, it may take months to determine whether the time between seizures is increasing.|$|R
