In a Svalbard prison, she learns Asriel is a prisoner of King Ragnar Sturlusson, although he is allowed to carry on his experiments at the special request of Coulter. Lyra learns from the Alethiometer that Iorek {{is on his way to}} rescue her. She tricks her way in to see Ragnar and claims she is Iorek's dæmon, created in an experiment at Bolvangar. As panserbjørne do not have dæmons, Ragnar is furious that Iorek should have something he cannot possess, and so Lyra tells him <b>that</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> to become his dæmon, he must kill Iorek in single combat. As such, Ragnar orders the guards to allow Iorek to approach. Iorek and Ragnar fight, and Iorek kills Ragnar.|$|E
25|$|Fisher was {{considered}} {{by those who}} met {{her to be a}} strong, witty businesswoman who was not afraid to speak her mind. In 1919, Fisher gave a speech {{at a meeting of the}} National Negro Business League. In her speech, Fisher told those assembled how to make a profit from catering and about her life growing up. She said she was a 57 year old woman who was not afraid to tell her age. In 1907, Fisher divorced her husband William and offered him a little over 100 dollars to not contest the divorce in court. William refused and was awarded nothing by the court system. Fisher said that her marriage wasn't a success and <b>that</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> to be successful she had to believe in herself and no one else. Fisher put her daughter Lucille through college and a music conservatory with the profits from her catering business. Fisher's first home was a 16 room house on Park Avenue which stood until 1960. In the 1920s she had a house built along Old Highway 63. During construction, she bought the materials, hired her own workers, and stayed on the property in a tent to oversee construction. Fisher was a celebrated personality in Columbia, with multiple articles written about her in the University Missourian. One particularly interesting article was her suggestions for Thanksgiving dinner. Fisher rented her properties out to black families who couldn't find housing easily in 1913. Annie gave out her recipes freely, but noted that she couldn't teach the common sense needed to cook her food. In a 1927 article in the Springfield Leader, Fisher's estimated net worth was approximately 100,000 dollars. Fisher was buried in a modest grave in 1938 at the Memorial Park Cemetery in Columbia.|$|E

[...] A career highlight for the model, it led to a three-year contract with Ratnani to feature her on his annual calendar.

To achieve her desired sound, she chose to work with multiple songwriters, including singer-songwriter Chloe Angelides. In an interview with Time, Gomez stated <b>that</b> <b>for</b> <b>her,</b> the track was not inspired by a single person, but instead about her experiences with drinking and social awkwardness, saying: [...] "I would hang out with people and they would drink and they’re so fun, {{then the next day}} it would be weird." [...] "Sober" [...] was initially conceived during a late-night conversation between the singer and Angelides in a hotel hallway, where the pair exchanged their own personal stories on the topic. After Gomez left the hotel, Angelides wrote the lyrics to [...] "Sober", and presented it to Gomez the following day.|$|E

500|$|Elizabeth I and Longford led {{directly}} to Hooper being selected by Tom Hanks to direct the epic miniseries John Adams for Playtone and HBO. Hooper {{had been working on}} a biographical film with Joan Didion about Katharine Graham, publisher of The Washington Post, since 2006 when he was asked by Hanks to helm the programme. The miniseries, starring Paul Giamatti as John Adams, was based on David McCullough's Adams biography and was Hooper's first wholly American production. He was surprised to learn that the American Revolutionary War was not a well-documented period in film and television; Abigail Adams actress Laura Linney told him <b>that,</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> generation, the musical 1776 was the most well-known depiction of the era. He worked on the miniseries for a total of 16 months; principal photography lasted 110 days on locations in the United States, France, England and Hungary and he controlled a $100million budget. The Boston Globes Matthew Gilbert complimented Hooper's style of direction in the first two episodes [...] "Join or Die" [...] and [...] "Independence": ...|$|E
500|$|The second {{series of}} Inside No. 9 {{was written in}} 2014, and then filmed {{from the end of}} 2014 into early 2015. As each episode {{features}} new characters, the writers were able to attract actors who might have been unwilling to commit to an entire series. Jack Whitehall, who was a fan of the show, says that he [...] "may or may not have nagged Reece and Steve to find a Jack Whitehall-shaped hole in the second series", and was [...] "very thankful" [...] when they did. In addition to Pemberton, Shearsmith and Whitehall, [...] "La Couchette" [...] stars Julie Hesmondhalgh, Mark Benton, Jessica Gunning and George Glaves. Hesmondhalgh commended the cast, saying <b>that,</b> <b>for</b> <b>her,</b> it was a [...] "no brainer" [...] to appear in the episode. For Whitehall, working with Hesmondhalgh was [...] "very exciting, but also quite weird", given the then-recent suicide of Hesmondhalgh's Coronation Street character, Hayley Cropper. Whitehall called Benton and Hesmondhalgh [...] "an amazing little double act". The pair had previously played a husband and wife on the radio.|$|E
500|$|The {{production}} of Debut was [...] "long and laborious", as it required Björk to realise her compositional {{ideas from the}} past ten years in a creatively autonomous fashion. Thus, after Debuts release, she was free to concentrate on her present life for new musical clues for her following album. Once again, she contacted Nellee Hooper to produce the album. He refused initially, encouraging her to produce the album herself, but agreed when she insisted. However, Björk agreed to contribute to the album's production as a co-producer and to enlist other producers; [...] "to make it stay fresh, she had to think about other people being involved". With Hooper's confirmation, Björk commenced work on the album almost immediately at the Bahamas' legendary Compass Point Studios. The picturesque locale inspired the singer to meld the recording process with the exotic natural environment. Biographer Mark Pytlik writes: [...] "The tales surrounding these recording sessions are appropriately evocative". For example, Rolling Stone wrote <b>that</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> vocals: [...] "Björk extended her mic cord to a beach so she could sing to the sea". Additionally, the first version of [...] "Cover Me" [...] was recorded entirely from a nearby cave, and rumours have persisted that Björk recorded [...] "Possibly Maybe" [...] in the nude.|$|E

500|$|The New Directions set {{of three}} Jackson family numbers was favorably {{reviewed}} by most critics, though they didn't necessarily agree on which songs were most effective. Bell couldn't decide whether she enjoyed these three songs or the Troubletones mash-up more, and West felt the [...] "choreography on {{the whole thing was}} stellar", and graded it an [...] "A+". Votta singled out [...] "ABC", which demonstrated [...] "what a lovely singer Tina is", and Kubicek said he enjoyed it [...] "mostly because Tina deserves more singing time, and I love the fact that Mike is now an actual singer who gets his own solos". Chaney called it [...] "a solid performance" [...] and gave it a B+, while Futterman wrote that it [...] "felt like a flashback to the New Directions' group performances of yesteryear, when it was all about an over-the-top, feel-good attitude". The dancing in [...] "Control" [...] was highlighted in many reviews: Hyman and Slezak were complimentary, but Chaney wrote that the [...] "choreography seemed a little awkward and occasionally out of synch", that it was [...] "the least effective of the three Jackson numbers" [...] and added <b>that</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> [...] "this felt dated when it could have been retro-fresh"; she graded the song a [...] "C". However, Futterman made mention of the [...] "slick dance moves", and Votta noted that the [...] "jazz band guys" [...] were [...] "holding their own with the background dancing through the whole number". However, for Kubicek, the song [...] "definitely brought down the energy at the middle of their performance". Bell characterized the final song as [...] "an amazing 'Man in the Mirror' cover", and Chaney said it was [...] "the best of their three songs", and gave it an [...] "A−". However, Slezak wrote that it [...] "proved to be a tonally jarring ending to the performance".|$|E
