40|$|Direct {{alcohol fuel}} cells are a {{promising}} option for portable power supply. Currently, direct methanol fuel cells {{are the best}} known direct alcohol fuel cells.

The Goondi Mill 2 foot gauge tramway, which connected the cane fields of the Johnstone district with the Mill near Innisfail, provided a <b>temporary</b> <b>transport</b> link connecting a [...] "missing section" [...] of the north coast railway between Garradunga and Daradgee. The rail link transported a large number of passengers in the early 1920s (108,458 during 1921-22) but passenger use declined dramatically due to the advent of motorcars and during the Great Depression. By 1935 passenger use had dropped to 5-6,000 per year. The rail continued to provide an important transport link between the cane farms, the mills and the port at Mourilyan. In 1929, 92% of goods carried on the tramway were sugar or cane.|$|R

40|$|Different culture {{conditions}} for {{cartilage tissue engineering}} were evaluated {{with respect to the}} supply of oxygen and glucose and the accumulation of lactate. A computational approach was adopted in which the bioreactor was modeled as a batch process and transport was considered within constructs seeded at high cell concentrations and of clinically relevant dimensions. To assess the extent to which mass transfer can be influenced theoretically, extreme cases were distinguished in which the culture medium in the bioreactor environment was assumed either completely static, or well mixed and fully oxygenated. It can be concluded that severe oxygen depletion and lactate accumulation can occur within cartilage tissue engineering bioreactors. However, the results also indicate that <b>transport</b> <b>restrictions</b> are not insurmountable, providing that the medium is well homogenized and oxygenated and the construct's surfaces are sufficiently exposed to the medium.

40|$|This {{working paper}} aims at {{assessing}} {{the prospects for}} a more liberal air passenger transport regime in the Asia Pacific region under the auspices of APEC. The decades-old bilateral air services regime has been under pressure to reform for several years; yet notwithstanding the critical role that international air transport plays in the ongoing integration of Asia Pacific economies, the airline industry remains one of the region’s most heavily regulated. A detailed analysis of bilateral air service agreements (ASAs) concluded by APEC economies reveals that, although some progress has been made, key restrictions on market access and on ownership links remain largely in place. Some more headway is being achieved in plurilateral ASAs, which have been proliferating in the APEC region. Estimates from the gravity equation employing the Air Liberalisation Index (ALI) developed by the WTO Secretariat find a positive and statistically significant relationship between relaxing bilateral air services restrictions and air passenger traffic. The estimates imply that if APEC economies eased air <b>transport</b> <b>restrictions</b> to double the ALI scores with their aviation partners, both within and outside the APEC region, traffic would increase by at least 5 - 7 %...|$|R
40|$|The {{possible}} {{existence of}} endemism among microorganisms resulting from and preserved by geographic isolation {{is one of}} the most controversial topics in microbial ecology. We isolated 31 strains of "Spumella-like" flagellates from remote sampling sites from all continents, including Antarctica. These and another 23 isolates from a former study were characterized morphologically and by small-subunit rRNA gene sequence analysis and tested for the maximum temperature tolerance. Only a minority of the Spumella morpho- and phylotypes from the geographically isolated Antarctic continent follow the worldwide trend of a linear correlation between ambient (air) temperature during strain isolation and heat tolerance of the isolates. A high percentage of the Antarctic isolates, but none of the isolates from locations on all other continents, were obligate psychrophilic, although some of the latter were isolated at low ambient temperatures. The drastic deviation of Antarctic representatives of Spumella from the global trend of temperature adaptation of this morphospecies provides strong evidence for geographic <b>transport</b> <b>restriction</b> of a microorganism; i. e., Antarctic protistan communities are less influenced by transport of protists to and from the Antarctic continent than by local adaptation, a subtle form of endemism...|$|R
