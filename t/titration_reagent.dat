40|$|Thermometric {{detection}} {{is one of}} {{the less}} usual methods for the objective titration end- point detection. The temperature change at the reaction between an analyte and a <b>titration</b> <b>reagent</b> is monitored by a thermistor. Break-response to the volume of an added titrant indicates reaching the end point of the titration. Subject of this work is to develop a method for the titrimetric determination of acids and bases with this detection method...|$|E
40|$|By {{means of}} {{synchronously}} controlled micropumps linear concentration gradients are generated. The precisely defined gradients {{can be used}} for flow titrations and the continuous calibration of flow injection analytical methods. A versatile computer interface for the simultaneous control of up to six stepper motor drived pumps was developed. Linear gradients generated by mixing a standard stock solution with a blank stock solution have been used to calibrate an enzyme reactor combined with a fluorescence detector in reversed FIA configuration. A more sophisticated method allows the implementation of so called digital flow titrations. Continuous flow titrations can be implemented by mixing linear concentration gradients of a <b>titration</b> <b>reagent</b> with a suitable sample solution. Both titrations techniques allow absolute determinations. (orig.)

40|$|We present here anion-exchange nanospheres as novel <b>titration</b> <b>reagents</b> for anions. The nanospheres {{contain a}} {{lipophilic}} cation {{for which the}} counterion is initially Cl−. Ion exchange takes place between Cl− in the nanospheres and a more lipophilic anion in the sample, such as ClO 4 − and NO 3 −. Consecutive titration in the same sample solution for ClO 4 − and NO 3 − were demonstrated. As an application, the concentration of NO 3 − in spinach was successfully determined using this method...|$|R
50|$|The iso-electric {{point is}} one such property. The iso-electric point is the pH value at which the zeta {{potential}} is approximately zero. At a pH near the iso-electric point (± 2 pH units), colloids are usually unstable; the particles tend to coagulate or flocculate. Such titrations use acids or bases as <b>titration</b> <b>reagents.</b> Tables of iso-electric points for different materials are available. The attached figure illustrates results of such titrations for concentrated dispersions of alumina (4% v/v) and rutile (7% v/v). It is seen that iso-electric point of alumina is around pH 9.3, whereas for rutile it is around pH 4. Alumina is unstable in the pH range from 7 to 11. Rutile is unstable in the pH range from 2 to 6.|$|R

40|$|Colloid {{titration}} {{was originally}} devised by Terayama (I 948) for studying the colloidal polyelectrolytes. However, the potential of this technique was not fully exploited until Senju (1969) introduced <b>titration</b> <b>reagents</b> of higher molecular weight and adequate purity, and confirmed its usefulness. It {{has now become a}} valuable analytical technique for many colloidal polyelectrolytes such as agar, lignin, pectin and some proteins. Recently, colloid titration was used to determine the surface charge of some yeasts (Imahara, Iwai & Naka-hama, 1971) and of Micrococcus lysodeikticus (Katayama et al., 1975). To learn more about the mechanism of germination of bacterial spores, we have inves-tigated the surface structure of two types of Bacillus megaterium spores that differ in their response to germinants and inhibitors. We found that the spores of Q M- B I ~ ~ I strain (desig-nated GN spores), which respond germinatively to glucose and KN 03, have more ionizable groups than those of A T C C I ~ ~ I ~ strain (AL spores), which respond to L-alanine and inosine; and that the buffer action of GN spores against a change in hydrogen-ion concentration is substantially stronger than that Of AL spores (Watanabe & Takesue, 1970). Since the surface charge of spores may affect the initiation of germination, we examined whether colloid titration could be used to determine the surface charge of bacterial spores, and then determined the surface charge in terms of the colloid titration value of the two types of Bacillus megaterium spores.

40|$|Yellow fever virus (YFV) is endemic in {{tropical}} and sub-tropical {{regions of the}} world, with around 180, 000 human infections a year occurring in Africa. Serologic testing is the chief laboratory diagnostic means of identifying an outbreak and to inform the decision to commence a vaccination campaign. The World Health Organization disseminates the reagents for YFV testing to African reference laboratories, and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is charged with producing and providing these reagents. The CDC M-antibody capture ELISA is a 2 -day test, requiring <b>titration</b> of <b>reagents</b> when new lots are received, which leads to inconsistency in testing and wastage of material.

40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} a multijunction microfluidic device for the injection of a substrate into {{an array of}} preformed plugs carried by an immiscible fluid in a microchannel. The device uses multiple junctions to inject substrate into preformed plugs without synchronization {{of the flow of}} substrate and the array of preformed plugs of reagent, which reduces cross-contamination of the plugs, eliminates formation of small droplets of substrate, and allows a greater range of injection ratios compared to that of a single T-junction. The device was based on a previously developed physical model for transport that was here adapted to describe injection and experimentally verified. After characterization, the device was applied to two biochemical assays, including evaluation of the enzymatic activity of thrombin and determination of the coagulation time of human blood plasma, which both provided reliable results. The reduction of cross-contamination and greater range of injection ratios achieved by this device may improve the processes that involve addition and <b>titration</b> of <b>reagents</b> into plugs, such as high-throughput screening of protein crystallization conditions...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1987 A kinetics-based {{enzyme-linked}} immunosorbent assay (KELA) for {{detection of}} serum IgG antibody against bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) was developed and optimized. Optimization factors tested included brand of microELISA plate, length of incubation periods at various temperatures, type of conjugate, purified versus precipitated antigen preparations, type of dilution buffer as well as various blocking regimes. Factors crucial to good, reproducible KELA results were careful <b>titration</b> of <b>reagents,</b> antigen adsorption time of 72 hours, use of Tween in serum and conjugate dilution buffers, along with washing procedures using a Tween-free wash solution. Fifty per cent endpoints were determined for 32 sera tested by KELA and were converted to a "serum-virus neutralization-equivalent 50 % endpoint". These KELA endpoints were then compared to 50 % endpoints of neutralization determined by the serum-virus neutralization assay. Coefficient of correlation (R²) was equal to 0. 58. Sensitivity of KELA was 100 %. A discussion of the factors affecting {{the correlation between the}} two is presented as well as the feasibility of KELA in the clinical laboratory...|$|R
40|$|Titrimetric {{estimation}} of calcium with disodium ethylene diamine tetra-acetate (E. D. T. A., sodium edetate), as performed on serum (Baron and Bell, 1957), cannot be applied directly to most other biological specimens {{because of their}} high concen-tration of phosphate. A high ratio of phosphate to calcium in the material titrated causes a drawn-out and inaccurate endpoint. A rapid procedure for calcium determination has been devised which gives accurate results after separation of phos-phate.

40|$|First {{published}} as an Advance Article {{on the web}} 1 st July 2004 Droplet-based programmable processors promise to offer solutions {{to a wide range}} of applications in which chemical and biological analysis and/or small-scale synthesis are required, suggesting they will become the microfluidic equivalents of microprocessors by offering off-the-shelf solutions for almost any fluid based analysis or small scale synthesis problem. A general purpose droplet processor should be able to manipulate droplets of different compositions (including those that are electrically conductive or insulating and those of polar or non-polar nature), to control <b>reagent</b> <b>titrations</b> accurately, and to remain free of contamination and carry over on its reaction surfaces. In this article we discuss the application of dielectrophoresis to droplet based processors and demonstrate that it can provide the means for accurately titrating, moving and mixing polar or non-polar droplets whether they are electrically conductive or not. DEP does not require contact with control surfaces and several strategies for minimizing surface contact are presented. As an example of a DEP actuated general purpose droplet processor, we show an embodiment based on a scaleable CMOS architecture that uses DEP manipulation on a 32 3 32 electrode array having built-in control and switching circuitry. Lastly, we demonstrate the concept of a general-purpose programming environment that facilitates droplet software development for any type of droplet processor...|$|R
40|$|Chapter 1 : Photoredox Activation of SF₆ for Fluorination [chemical formula] We {{report the}} first {{practical}} use of SF₆ as a fluorinating reagent in organic synthesis. Photoredox catalysis enables the in situ conversion of SF 6, an inert gas, into an active fluorinating species using visible light and photoredox catalysis. Under these conditions, deoxyfluorination of allylic alcohols is affected with high chemoselectivity and is tolerant {{of a wide}} range of functional groups. Application of the methodology in a continuous-flow setup achieves comparable yields to those obtained with a batch setup, while providing drastically increased material throughput of valuable allylic fluoride products. Further studies are necessary to reveal mechanistic details but preliminary experiments indicate that the mechanism of this deoxyfluorination may share features with that of the chlorination of alcohols with thionyl chloride proceeding through activation of the alcohol and subsequent substitution. Although several substrates exhibit a preference for retention of stereochemistry, similar to reactions with thionyl chloride, additional investigations revealed that this selectivity is also dependent on the structure of the substrate. Chapter 2. Automated On-demand <b>Titration</b> of Organometallic <b>Reagents</b> in Continuous Flow [chemical formula] The development of the first automated organometallic titration system using continuous flow is described. In this system, the desired organometallic reagent at variable flow rate is combined with a constant stream of colorimetric indicator and the end-point of the titration is monitored via inline UV/Vis spectroscopy and LabVIEW interface. Through an iterative process, precisions of 2 ±% can be achieved. In the described configuration, three titrants (N-pivaloyl-o-toluidine, 4 -phenylbenzylidene benzylamine, salicylaldehyde phenylhydrazone) can be used for the titration of a wide array of organometallic species (RLi, RMgX, MHMDS) in molarities ranging from 0. 1 M to 4. 9 M. In removing user intervention from the titration process, the developed system greatly reduces the safety hazards associated with handling pyrophoric organometallics and minimizes user-related error. Additionally, the UV/Vis spectrometer enables a level of precision to be achieved that is unattainable with the naked eye. The system also provides the possibility to be integrated with batch and continuous flow reactions, allowing organometallic reagents to be used in at highly accurate concentrations and without re-exposure to the user. Chapter 3. Progress Toward an Enantioselective Synthesis of Bedaquiline [chemical formula] Herein we describe progress toward an enantioselective synthesis of bedaquiline, a novel pharmaceutical used for the treatment of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis. In our efforts, several provisional routes have been investigated and assessed for feasibility. Although decarboxylative arylation, hydrogen atom-transfer, and sulfur-ylide epoxidation proved ineffective for the in these routes, our latest efforts are focused on a much more precedented asymmetric epoxidation which will be the subject of future work. During these investigations, the synthesis of the final epoxide intermediate of our route has been achieved on multi-gram scale, albeit in a racemic fashion. Our proposed route uses readily available, inexpensive starting materials, and would afford bedaquiline in six steps. by T. Andrew McTeague. Thesis: Ph.
