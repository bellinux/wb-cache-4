40|$|Introduction: Stabilisation. of {{fractures}} with an intramedullary nail is {{a widespread}} technique {{in the treatment of}} femoral shaft fractures in adults. <b>To</b> <b>ream</b> or not <b>to</b> <b>ream</b> is still debated. The primary objective of this Study was to determine the incidence of non-union following unreamed intramedullary stabilisation of femoral fractures. Secondary objectives were intra- and postoperative complications and implant failure. Methods: Between March 1995 and June 2005, 125 patients with 129 traumatic femoral shaft fractures were treated with as unreamed femoral nail. From this retrospective single centre Study, 18 patients were excluded due to insufficient follow up data, including 1 patient who died within 2 days after severe head injury. Sixty-six patients had suffered multiple injuries. 21 fractures were open. According to the AO classification, there were 54 type A, 42 type B, and 14 type C fractures. Dynamic proximal locking was performed in 44 cases (36 type A and 8 type B fractures). Results: Non-union occurred in two patients (1. 9 %; one type B and one type C fractures). Intra-operative complications were seen in three patients (2. 8 %). Postoperative in-hospital complications occurred in 29 patients (27 %). Local superficial infection occurred in two patients (1. 9 %), there were no cases of deep infection. Implant failure occurred in three patients (2. 8 %) : nail breakage was seen in two patients. Conclusion: In this study, the incidence of non-union following unreamed intramedullary nailing is low (1. 9 %) and comparable with the best results of reamed nailing in the literature.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the accuracy of used and new reamer systems for both hemispherical and minimally invasive (MIS) acetabular reamers. MethodsNew and used hemispherical and MIS acetabular reamers were tested on a computer numerical control machine <b>to</b> <b>ream</b> holes in special machinable wax blocks. Each reamer was tested 3 times in sizes 48 mm through 55 mm. ResultsThe used reamers significantly underreamed by an average of 1. 33 vs 0. 28 mm compared to new reamers. Hemispherical reamers underreamed significantly more than MIS reamers, with a mean difference of 0. 99 vs 0. 63 mm, respectively. Used hemispherical reamers showed an average ream undersize of 1. 61 vs 0. 37 mm, compared to new hemispherical reamers. Used MIS reamers showed an average ream undersize of 1. 06 vs 0. 20 mm for the new MIS reamers. ConclusionsFor a manufacturer-specified reamer size, both hemispherical and MIS reamers underream. Newer reamers cut truer to expected values than used ones. MIS reamers performed more accurately than hemispherical reamers. Used acetabular reamer systems may negatively affect the sizing of prepared acetabular beds; therefore, awareness of this potential inaccuracy should be considered when performing total hip arthroplasty...|$|E

So we have conducted a study to compare the functional outcomes, rate of infection and time needed for union in reamed and unreamed interlocking nailing on open tibia frac tures. METHODOLOGY: This study was carried out as a prospective, comparative study. 100 patients with open fractures of tibial shaft admitted in our hospital between J une 2011 and January 2013 {{were enrolled in the}} study. Patients outside the age group of 20 - 50 years of age, severely ommuniated fractures and fractures classified under Gustilo Anderson type III b and IIIc were excluded. 100 fractures were divided into two groups (reamed nailing and unreamed nailing) n= 50 in each with simple randomization techn ique. Evaluation in the form of radiological union was done with serial x - rays and functional grading according to Klemm & Borner’s criteria for tibial shaft fractures was done at the end of 6 months. RESULTS: A verage fracture healing time was 16 - 20 weeks in both in undreamed nailing radiologically. Also, differences in rates of clinical union, clinical outcome, time for weight bearing and complication in both groups were not significant. Post - operative infection was found in 5 cases in reamed group and 3 c ases in unreamed group.

40|$|Only {{abstract}} of poster available. Track I: Power GenerationIn {{order to}} extract {{heat from the}} high temperature rocks that lie relatively {{close to the surface}} {{in different parts of the}} world, wells must first be drilled down into those rocks. Once the wells are established then either natural fissures or artificially induced fractures are generated to create an underground network of channels in the hot rock. Either existing steam in the rock, or injected water is then pumped through this network as a way of extracting the heat, turning it into steam, and bringing it to the surface. At the surface the steam, depending on temperature, can be used to drive generators, and/or to provide district heating. The rocks through which the wells must be drilled are generally igneous, and thus of a high strength, tough and very hot, and conventional methods of drilling are difficult and slow. The use of high-pressure fluid jets to drill the wells has been shown to be faster than conventional drilling, and since the jets cut away from the bit, there are not the wear problems that are associated with conventional drilling tools. Further the jets have the potential to be re-oriented in the production zone <b>to</b> <b>ream</b> out the well from a radius of 4. 5 inches to some 36 inches. This increases the productivity of individual wells, and reduces the number that may need to be drilled. Abrasive can also be introduced into the water-jet stream as it is pumped down the borehole, and it is also possible to create a cutting jet that can notch the walls of the borehole so that, under controlled pressurization, cracks can be grown out in preferred directions, and the process of heat extraction simplified...|$|E

The use of an analytical technique such as remote sensing that consents the remote survey of the research zones is advisable especially considering the great land surveying difficulties in hazardous zones such as the studied one. The arid and semi-arid environments are considered an ideal objective for the use of remote interpretative tools since the absence of vegetation does not inhibit the lithological and structural discrimination.

Prior to seeking Ethical Committee approval for the first MITCH PCRTM Cup clinical study, validation that the acetabulum could be prepared in a manner which would allow the MITCH PCRTM Cup to be implanted safely, was undertaken. This study describes the four phases of the validation process and the modification made to the cup design in order to ensure safe acetabular preparation. The first study investigated the effect of interference fit on cup deflection. An interference fit of O. 5 mm or less was required to ensure polar contact necessary for safe tribological performance. The second study examined the variability of socket dimensions achieved in foam blocks, using reamers provided by five different commercial manufacturers. Excessive socket undersizing was a common finding with all but the EPM reamers. These reamers were validated for accuracy and precision. In the third study, EPM reamers were used <b>to</b> <b>ream</b> cadaveric bone. The socket dimensions obtained were variable with an interference fit of up to 1. 8 mm obtained. Bony protrusions were observed which could also increase cup deflection and compromise proper cup seating. As a consequence, the cup internal geometry was modified to accommodate the spectrum of findings observed. The fourth study used the modified cups and a new reaming strategy comprising both conventional and custom MITCH PCRTM finishing reamers to achieve safe acetabular preparation. The results showed satisfactory clearance was achieved at the cup side arms in all cases. The reaming solution was appropriate for progression to the first clinical implantation.

40|$|Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Washcore 147 - 895 D- 10 W is {{the last}} core taken in Hole 895 D. It {{represents}} accidental recovery of drilling rubble during hole reaming, and therefore represents a mix of lithologies {{that could have been}} derived from 0 to 93. 7 meters below seafloor (mbsf). It consists of 15 distinct pieces of serpentinized ultramafic and gabbroic rocks, with numerous gravel-sized pieces of mixed ultramafic material with small amounts of clay occurring {{at the bottom of the}} core. More uncurated rubble was sampled when trying <b>to</b> <b>ream</b> the hole. This uncurated rubble is not described in the Initial Reports volume, but was collected by one of the authors (H. P.). Petrographic inspection of the uncurated rubble showed it to be serpentinized olivine with margins of chrysotile asbestos, small amounts of spinels and gabbroic fragments. It was expected that the rubble composition represents well peridotites of the marine mantle, especially in relation to platinum group elements (PGE) (Prichard et al., this volume). It was decided by the shipboard party to use this uncurated material as a reference for post-cruise geochemical analysis. On board, approximately 4 kg of the uncurated material (Sample 147 - 895 D- 10 WReference 1) was washed clay-free with demineralized water, dried at 110 °C, and then ground in a motor-driven agate mortar. Because the grain size was not yet suitable after this procedure for preparing powder pellets aboard ship for X-ray fluorescence (XRF) trace-element analysis, three small splits were ground in tungsten carbide containers in a shatter box. The results of shipboard XRF-analysis with an Applied Research Laboratories (ARL) machine gave preliminary trace elements only. The data are given in Table 1. At the end of the cruise, small samples of approximately 200 g of 147 - 895 D- 10 W-Reference 1 were distributed to interested cruise participants. H.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to evaluate {{the sources of the}} differences between the NO 2 satellite retrieval products provided by the Royal Dutch Meteorological Institute (KNMI) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Ground studies have shown that although both products use the same satellite, these products yield different observations for NO 2 tropospheric columns concentrations. This study does not validate either retrieval product, but rather indentifies the main sources for the discrepancy. There are several parameters which allow successful retrieval of NO 2 vertical columns. For this study, only the difference between the radiative models and the a priori NO 2 chemical transport models were considered relevant. All other parameters, such as cloud properties, slant columns, stratospheric serration and their assumptions, were held constant. Here, the models are referred to by their proprietor's acronym: "TOMRAD" refers to the radiative model used by NASA, "DAK" refers to the radiative model used by KNMI, "TM 4 " refers to the a priori chemical transport model used by KNMI, and "REAM" refers to the a priori chemical transport model maintained by the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Mixing these parameters creates four retrievals for comparison. Many significant differences were identified after comparing these four retrievals. First, there are viewing geometry biases between the port side and the starboard side of the satellite retrieval for each swath. These viewing geometry biases lead to artificial periodicities in the retrievals of NO 2 tropospheric vertical columns over a specific coordinate or site, such as a city. Furthermore, there were significant differences found after using different a priori NO 2 chemical transport models. The low horizontal resolution of TM 4 and the satellite retrieval/TM 4 coupling effect compared <b>to</b> <b>REAM</b> leads to considerable questioning of the near real time application of the KNMI NO 2 retrieval product. Though the TM 4 model performs poorly, TM 4 retrievals do perform nearly as well as REAM retrievals at capturing day-to-day variability and the spatial variability of the cities used as examples here. The retrievals using TOMRAD outperformed the retrievals using DAK when compared to the high resolution, hourly REAM a priori chemical transport model. In sum, these findings should lead to better optimizations of both the KNMI and NASA retrievals, and thus make their publicly available data products more reliable and accurate for general use. M. S.

40|$|Drilling with casing and liner are {{unconventional}} drilling methods {{developed to}} reduce both the non-productive {{time spent on}} drilling operations and drilling time in general. A casing or liner string is used as the drillstring, {{and the number of}} operations is therefore reduced from two to one as drilling and casing of the wellbore are performed in one operation. Even though there are many benefits with this drilling method, there are also some drawbacks and operational considerations. Statoil and Baker Hughes have developed a rotary steerable liner drilling system, called the Steerable Drilling Liner (SDL). Two offshore test wells have been drilled with this system, and Statoil is now planning to utilize it on more wells in the North Sea. The Oseberg field is a candidate field for liner drilling due to stability problems in the Draupne and Ness formations. Two wells on the Oseberg field have therefore been chosen as the candidate wells for this thesis. The case histories of the test wells show that the limitation may be the low flow rate circulated through the liner, which may cause cuttings accumulation on top of the liner where the flow area suddenly expands. A flow diverter is therefore developed to have more flexibility in the choice of flow rate above the liner. The flow diverter and other solutions to improve the hole cleaning have been evaluated in this thesis. The high annular circulating pressure is another issue with the liner drilling technique. Many of the factors which improve hole cleaning also increase the annular pressure. The ECD must also be taken into consideration when optimizing the hole cleaning of the candidate wells. The simulations of hole cleaning and annular circulating pressure for the SDL system have been performed in WellPlan. The recommended flow rate for hole cleaning in the sections above the liner is at least 500 lpm higher than the maximum possible flow rate through the liner. By circulating this recommended rate through the liner, the equivalent circulating density increases. The circulating pressure exceeds the fracture pressure of the formation for the 7 ” SDL system. It is therefore not an alternative to come up with solutions to be able to circulate with a higher flow rate through the SDL system. A flow diverter above the liner is the best solution to increase the flow rate in the critical part of the well. With the flow diverter above the liner, the flow rate can be increased to the minimum required rate for hole cleaning {{and at the same time}} keep the equivalent circulating density at an acceptable level. The increased flow rate above the flow diverter will have minimal effect on the annular circulating pressure below the previous casing shoe. The simulations also showed that this minimum rate can be significantly reduced by changing the drilling fluid parameters. If the flow rate is kept constant, the bed height of cuttings can be reduced by optimizing the fluid parameters. Optimization of the drilling fluid is also important to make sure the cleaning in the annulus outside the liner is good. The required rate could be reduced further by increasing the rotation of the string and increasing the size of the drillpipe above the liner, and these solutions have been evaluated. Future work should include the development of a simulation program that can include all the downhole tools and components required for the Steerable Drilling Liner system, including two flow split components. The simulation program should also be able to handle the combination of a pilot bottom hole assembly and an underreamer <b>to</b> <b>ream</b> the hole to full size, and then calculate the correct amount of cuttings in the annulus. The drilling fluids should also be optimized to improve the hole cleaning in liner drilling operations further. </p...|$|E

5000|$|The {{tunnel system}} {{known today as}} the Ohio Caverns was {{discovered}} August 17, 1897 by Robert Noffsinger, a farmhand {{who worked on the}} land. A sinkhole had been forming on land owned by Abraham William Reams over a period of about 10 years. In August 1897, this sink hole measured 50 feet across by 10 feet deep. One particular night, the sinkhole was filled completely with water during a hard rain. By morning, the water was completely gone. <b>Reams</b> reported <b>to</b> the local newspaper that he lost [...] "several hundred barrels of water." [...] Reams had recently hired Robert Noffsinger, a young man from Virginia, to work on his farm. By Reams' orders, Noffsinger and Jordan <b>Reams</b> (unknown relation <b>to</b> William <b>Reams)</b> began <b>to</b> dig in the sinkhole. Noffsinger dug a few feet of soil until he hit the top of the ground's limestone layer. After finding a crack in the limestone, Noffsinger broke through this rock as well. Immediately feeling the caverns' [...] air, Noffsinger was even more curious. He lowered himself into the caverns and became the first living creature inside of the Ohio Caverns system. After crawling 8 feet into the caverns, Noffsinger called back out <b>to</b> Jordan <b>Reams</b> <b>to</b> fetch him an oil lantern. After Noffsinger received the lantern, he explored 802 feet on his first trip into the caverns.|$|R
