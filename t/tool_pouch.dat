500|$|Both the Xindi landing pod and {{the alien}} {{spaceship}} {{were designed by}} John Eaves. He also produced a series of designs for a Vulcan shuttle which ended up being written out of the episode. The Xindi pod went through three designs being approved, while the alien spaceship was accepted on the first submission. However Eaves regretted this, as he had submitted a spaceship design which he strongly disliked, calling it [...] "by far my least favorite of anything I have ever drawn". It {{was based on a}} hatchet housed in a <b>tool</b> <b>pouch.</b> Eaves also developed the concept artwork for the alien temple.|$|E
50|$|The {{standard}} issue accoutrement today, {{dependent upon}} the branch of service, was changed to the capacity of two front pouches (Pouch, Ammunition, Universal, DPM, IRR.) instead of one. To this, privately purchased water bottle or utility pouches and hip pads are often added. The entrenching <b>tool</b> <b>pouch</b> (Carrier, Entrenching Tool Case, DPM, IRR.) is sometimes used as an alternative water bottle pouch.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The murine air pouch {{membrane}} {{represents an}} easily accessible tissue {{for studies on}} gene regulation in acute inflammation. Considering that acute inflammation may affect expression of molecular reference genes, we evaluated the expression of glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and prolylpeptidyl isomerase A (PPIA) in the air pouch membrane during a complete time course of urate crystal inflammation and correlated the results with expression of interleukin (IL) - 1 β and hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) - 1 α. In addition, we aimed to identify alternate potential reference genes. Methods Using custom microfluidic real-time PCR arrays, the expression of 96 genes including GAPDH, PPIA, IL- 1 β, and HIF- 1 α was determined in dissected air pouch membranes 1, 4, 9, 18, 27, and 50 hours (h) after injecting monosodium urate (MSU) crystals into the pouch. One-way ANOVA was used to detect differential gene expression throughout the time course. Using the genes on these arrays as a convenience sample, alternate candidate reference genes were sought (1) with a biostatistical approach and (2) using the geNorm software <b>tool.</b> Results <b>Pouch</b> leukocytes peaked at t = 9 h and declined toward t = 50 h. PPIA expression was not differentially regulated (p = 0. 52, ANOVA). In contrast, GAPDH mRNA increased steadily after crystal injection, reaching a maximal 2. 8 -fold increase at t = 18 h (p = 0. 0006, t test), which followed a marked induction of IL- 1 β (max., 208 -fold at t = 4 h, p = 8. 4 × 10 - 5, t test) and HIF- 1 α (max., 6. 6 -fold at t = 4 h, p = 0. 00025, t test). Fifteen genes were artifactually identified as "significantly regulated" when Ct values were normalized against GAPDH expression. The biostatistical approach and the geNorm analysis identified overlapping sets of candidate reference genes. Both ranked PPIA as the best candidate, followed by defender against cell death 1 (DAD 1) and high-mobility group B 1 (HMGB 1). Conclusions GAPDH mRNA expression is up-regulated in urate crystal inflammation, possibly due to inflammation-associated hypoxia. Using GAPDH mRNA for molecular normalization resulted in significant artifacts in the calculated expression of the target mRNAs. PPIA and other stably expressed genes promise to be more appropriate reference genes in this model. </p...|$|R
