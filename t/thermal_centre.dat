40|$|Chilling {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} branches of food preservation under low temperature as it retains, more closely than any other means, the "fresh" quality and appearance of the food. No simple method to predict chilling times for a wide range of geometric shapes without major disadvantages was found in the literature. Investigation via a set of test problems showed that for each available method, there were ranges of conditions under which accuracy of prediction reduced significantly. This justified development and testing of a new method. A theoretical and experimental study of methods for predicting the chilling times of both regularly and irregularly shaped foods was carried out. Using the sphere as a reference shape and based on the first term of the series analytical solution, empirical mathematical expressions for extending the existing concept of equivalent heat transfer dimensionality E to take account of the effect of geometry on unsteady state heat conduction processes, which has been successfully applied in freezing time prediction, were derived. These cover a wide range of heat transfer environmental conditions and multi-dimensional regular and irregular geometries. Empirical formulae for the lag factor, L, as a function of object geometric shape were also developed for the <b>thermal</b> <b>centre</b> and mass-average temperatures. Guidelines to define object geometry for irregular shapes were established. The recommended dimensional measurement approach uses actual measurements of the three dimensions of an irregular geometry to define the dimensional ratios for an equivalent ellipsoid. The neglect of sharp protrusions and of hollows in taking measurements is recommended. Experimental chilling data for foods found in the literature, were limited in usefulness for model testing because the experimental conditions were usually not sufficiently accurately measured, described or controlled. Therefore, a comprehensive set of 3879 analytical solution simulations, 351 finite element method procedures and 165 experiments of chilling processes were made over a wide range of conditions. The chilling experiments were carried out using sixteen different two- and three-dimensional irregularly shaped objects made of Tylose, a food analogue, or of Cheddar cheese. Experiments for bricks of Cheddar cheese with uniformly distributed voids were also conducted because of the scarcity of published experimental data for chilling of products with voids. For regular geometries (short cylinder, squat cylinder, infinite rectangular rod, rectangular brick, oblate and prolate spheroids), and across a wide range of conditions and product shape ratios the methodology predicted chilling times to within - 7. 6 to 5. 6 % of the theoretical solutions for the <b>thermal</b> <b>centre</b> position and ± 9. 4 % for the mass-average condition. For many commonly encountered conditions the lack of fit was considered acceptably low when likely data uncertainties are taken into account. When the guidelines for defining an equivalent ellipsoid and the simple method were tested, the 95 % confidence interval of the percentage difference comparing predictions with the experimentally measured chilling times for <b>thermal</b> <b>centre</b> temperatures of two-dimensional irregular geometries was - 3. 1 to 14. 4 %. For three-dimensional irregular geometries, the equivalent interval was - 6. 4 to 11. 6 %. No experimental testing of predicted mass-average temperatures was carried out. The simple prediction method failed to match the experimental data in a similar manner to the finite element method. Lack of fit was probably more due to experimental error than errors in the form of geometric approximation and the prediction method itself. In situations where the product contains significant uniformly distributed voids, either the simple empirical prediction method or any relevant analytical solution can be applied if an "equivalent thermal conductivity" is defined. Keey's method, with a distribution factor dependent on voidage fraction, is recommended for calculating the equivalent thermal conductivity on the basis of best fit to experimental data but ranges of applicability require further investigation. It could not be established whether natural convection in the voids was a significant enhancer of the cooling rate. In many industrial applications, data such as heat transfer coefficients and thermal properties are difficult to estimate, and non-uniformity of chilling conditions is difficult to avoid. The overall accuracy of predictions in such applications is unlikely to be significantly increased through further reduction in the inherent inaccuracy of the proposed methodologies. The methodologies are therefore suitable for routine industrial use...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{this work}} {{the meaning of}} a {{migrating}} hot spot during solidification will be discussed. Initially, just after mould filling, global as well as local <b>thermal</b> <b>centres,</b> or hot spots, are established. This occurs at mass concentrations and heavy sections as the mould wall initially is at ambient temperature. However, these hot spots are found to be migrating during solidification. This migration influences any temperature measurement and subsequent thermal analysis, introducing uncertainties. It has also been found that common casting defects such as shrinkage porosity and metal expansion penetration can be associated with a migrating hot spot. In these cases the final position of the hot spot is located across the interface between the casting and the mould. The solidification starts at the mould walls and {{it was found that the}} columnar zone is affected by the migrating hot spot. The macrostructure was preserved using DAAS technique and it was revealed that an otherwise normal columnar zone because of the migrating hot spot had been affected. Based on these findings it is suggested that the migrating hot spot is making the columnar zone weaker and more susceptible for pressure differences arising during solidification...|$|R

40|$|The {{site of the}} “Sassi di Matera” {{classified}} by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) as World Heritage in 1993, is an exceptional example of traditional bioclimatic Mediterranean architecture. This site is located in Basilicata in southern part of Italy and is characterized as having a Mediterranean climate, with hot dry summers and temperate and humid winters. The average seasonal temperature is 4 _C in winter and 32 _C in summer, which often has high values close to 40 _C. Moreover winter is mild with rare frosts. Rains are mostly concentrated in autumn and winter. Within this immense artistic heritage, the study regars hypogea habitations and stone buildings (half-hypogeum and half-built), throught monitoring a surface hypogeum and a deep hypogeum. The research focus upon {{the evaluation of the}} energy and microclimatic performance of recovered hypogeous structures today used as a <b>thermal</b> <b>centre</b> (SPA). The analysis performed a dynamic parametric simulation using the software EnergyPlus to quantify the energetic balance of the hypogeous structures during one calendar year. The energetic valuation of the surface hypogea shows that these environments, once restored and in a condition of normal use, give indoor comfort within the limits of comfort thermo-hygrometrics. The methodology used in the research is that of empirical research, i. e. a direct study “in situ”, where the designer is an experimenter and a researcher at the same time. This methodological approach was used on particularly representative case studies: “Locanda di San Martino” <b>thermal</b> <b>centre</b> (SPA). The huge thermal mass of the walls ensures that the microclimate indoor conditions are regular throughout the seasons, without differences in the daily thermal oscillation. Deep hypogea with an air change system cannot reach thermal-hygrometric comfort values. The most important {{thing to do is to}} regulate indoor microclimate, before eliminating the humidity from the walls. The same environments used under normal conditions reach indoor comfort. During the summer season the indoor temperature is in the comfort. Then these buildings often need to be heated during the summer season to shorten the huge indoor/outdoor thermal gradient. Deep hypogeous architectures without an air change system cannot reach thermal-hygrometric comfort values. This system is useful in increasing the indoor temperature and reducing the indoor–outdoor thermal gradient. A dynamic analysis permitted us to quantify the energy balance of the hypogeous structures during a period of one calendar year. In this way, we can state that these structures have a null thermal balance during mid-season, while in summer the floor loses heat and cools the room with the opposite occurring in winter. It can conclude that these buildings were designed as bioclimatic. In fact they can be used, after restoration, with limited use of technology systems...|$|E

40|$|Toowoomba Foundry {{is seeking}} {{help with the}} design of tall tapered feeders, which supply extra molten iron to poured {{castings}} as they cool. There {{is a problem with}} the reliability of the feeders, particularly for thicker castings of the newer spheroidal graphite irons. An effective feeder remains molten until the casting has set. The setting of the melt in the feeder is delayed by making it large enough to retain its heat for longer than the casting, and by placing it close to the <b>thermal</b> <b>centre</b> of the casting. So a larger feeder is more reliable. But any metal remaining in the feeder is recycled, and has an associated energy cost. If a feeder is too small, it will set too soon, and the casting will have unwanted holes in it that may require the entire casting to be recycled. Thus there is a tension between making the feeder smaller so as to minimise recycled metal, and having the feeder large enough that the casting is good. Existing design methods use purely conductive models of heat transport. We investigate the relevance of convection in the cooling feeder, and set up a boundary-layer model of flow driven by density differences. We find that convection is a significant factor in the design of a feeder, effectively maintaining constant temperature across it. The height of the feeder is important mainly in providing the driving force for this flow...|$|E

40|$|The {{presence}} of shrinkage defects is of major {{concern in the}} production of grey iron castings. This type of defect can penetrate through the casting as a three-dimensional network. The aim of the present work is to develop knowledge and understanding about the foundry process in order to increase product quality by minimising the {{presence of}} shrinkage porosity. The general reason for shrinkage defects are the contractions which arise during solidification, {{but in the case of}} grey iron the situation is further complicated as graphite, a phase having lower density compared to the iron, expands when it precipitates. Besides these volumetric changes, the evolution of gases dissolved in the melt is another consideration as their solubility decreases with temperature. It will be shown how the solubility of oxygen depends on the temperature but not on the method used to produce the iron. On the other hand, the total amount of oxygen depends on process but not on temperature. The hydrogen concentration depends on holding time, approaching equilibrium due to exchanges between the melt and its environment. Events inside the mould are important for the formation of porosity and it will be shown how the concentration of hydrogen increases after mould filling. The amount of dissolved nitrogen also increases inside the mould, but not to the same extent. The solidification of grey iron starts with the precipitation of primary austenite and Dendrite Arm Spacing (DAS) can be related to the volumetric number of equiaxed crystals. The subsequent eutectic solidification depends on the primary solidification as the eutectic cell size is found to increase with increasing DAS. The columnar zone on the other hand is related to the equiaxed crystals through Columnar-to-Equiaxed Transition (CET). Shrinkage porosity is normally considered to be found in the areas last to freeze, and inter-dendritically. However, this work shows that shrinkage porosity also can be confined between grains in the primary structure. It will also be discussed how the columnar zone is suppressed because of a moving <b>thermal</b> <b>centre</b> and how this weak surface will constitute ingates for atmospheric gases compensating for the volumetric contractions...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, {{a variety}} of {{different}} cold seep systems (mud volcanoes and a gas seep) were investigated using a multidisciplinary approach to gain a more systematic understanding of these, methane-driven biogeosystems. The main goals were the detection and quantification of hot spots of methane oxidation as well as an assessment of environmental factors determining the activity and the distribution of methanotrophic communities. Furthermore, key microbial players were identified and the impact of Anaerobic Oxidation Of Methane (AOM) and Aerobic Oxidation Of Methane (MOx) on the surrounding, marine environment was studied. The investigations revealed the following: 1. Submarine mud volcanoes are colonized by specialized microbial communities utilizing the fluxes of reduced substrates such as methane and sulphide as energy source. At the actively methane-seeping Haakon Mosby mud volcano (HMMV, Barents Sea), a distinct spatial zonation of several novel clades of free-living and symbiotic aerobic and anaerobic methanotrophs was found. The main selection mechanism determining vertical and horizontal distribution and dominance of the methanotrophic communities were fluid flow rates controlling access to electron acceptors for methane oxidation. 2. The analysis of archaeal and bacterial specific lipid concentrations and their associated delta 13 C-values from three seepage areas at HMMV (<b>thermal</b> <b>centre,</b> grey mats and Beggiatoa site) showed a distinct distribution of methanotrophic biomass. At the centre, MOx mediated by a type I methanotroph was the primary biomass-generating process in surface sediments. In patches of reduced sediment, covered by greyish, thiotrophic, microbial mats at the boundary of the centre, a four-fold increase in 13 C-depleted lipids specific for anaerobic methanotrophs, gave evidence of active microbial communities, which mediate AOM in the upper 20 cm of sediment. Further away from the centre, in the zone covered by Beggiatoa mats, sharp, vertical gradients of 13 C-depleted archaeal and bacterial lipids indicate that AOM communities were restricted to a narrow surface horizon of no more than 4 cm. A combination of molecular techniques (DAPI, FISH, gene libraries) and biomarker fingerprints provided evidence that the AOM community was dominated by a novel strain of archaea (termed ANME- 3) and SRB of the Desulfobulbus cluster. 3. Biogeochemical investigations at HMMV revealed a high upward flow of sulphate-free subsurface fluids in the centre, strongly limiting the penetration of sulphate and oxygen from seawater. Here, MOx was restricted to the top sediment layer with rates of 0. 9 mol m- 2 yr- 1 and AOM was absent. In the patches of reduced sediments covered with grey mats, a deeper penetration of sulphate was observed, fueling AOM activity down to > 12 cm with rates of 12. 4 mol m- 2 yr- 1. Adjacent to the centre at the Beggiatoa site, decreased upward fluid flow allowed for an AOM zone of ca 4 cm at the sediment surface with rates of 4. 5 mol m- 2 yr- 1. At the outer rim of the HMMV, bioventilation of the pogonophoran worms irrigated a much deeper zone with oxygen- and sulphate-rich seawater. Just beneath the roots of the worms, aOM activity was high with 7. 1 mol m- 2 yr- 1. With respect to the area size of the different habitats at HMMV, microbial consumption reduces the methane efflux of HMMV by ca 7 * 10 - 5 Tg yr- 1, i. e. 22 to 55 %. 4. The mud volcanoes of the Gulf of Cadiz are currently much less active than the HMMV. Here, thermogenic methane was completely consumed anaerobically in subsurface sediments. AOM and SR rates showed maxima in distinct subsurface sediment horizons between 20 to 200 cm below sea floor. In comparison to other methane dominated environments of the world oceans, AOM activity and diffusive methane fluxes (< 0. 4 mol m- 2 yr- 1, respectively) were low to mid range. AOM was generally exceeded by SRR, most likely because methane related, higher hydrocarbons were oxidised anaerobically by SR microbes. Lipid biomarker and 16 S rDNA clone library analyses gave evidence that AOM was mediated by a mixed community of ANME- 2 and ANME- 1 archaea and associated SRB (Seep-SRB 1 group). 5. The Tommeliten gas seep is located in the central North Sea. Here, cracks in a buried marl horizon allow methane to migrate into overlying clay-silt sediments. Hydroacoustic sediment echosounding showed several gas flares coinciding with the apex of the marl domes where methane is released into the water column and potentially to the atmosphere. Carbonates {{in the vicinity of the}} gas seep contained 13 C-depleted, archaeal lipids indicating long-term AOM activity. In the sediment, the zone of active methane consumption was restricted to a distinct horizon of no more than 20 cm. Diagnostic, 13 C-depleted archaeal and bacterial lipids as well as 16 S rDNA clone libraries provided evidence that AOM was mediated by ANME- 1 b archaea and SRB most likely belonging to the Seep-SRB 1 cluster...|$|E

In order to predict the thermal behaviour of a mud the analysis of its physical properties is required; among these, those that have bigger influence are the specific heat capacity, the thermal conductivity and the density. This work focuses on the study of the behaviour of the specific heat of a bentonitic clay (composed mainly of 55 % Na-saturated smectite, 28 % sepiolite, and 15 % illite) mixed with distilled water or sea water {{as a function of the}} water concentration in the temperature range 293. 15 - 317. 15 K. The experimental data were measured using a Calvet calorimeter, SETARAM BT 2. 15, which permits studying with high precision all kind of substances and materials (oils, polymers, hydrates, powders) and simulate almost any process condition (reactions, crystallisation, freezing, etc.). The obtained specific heat values in the studied temperature range are between 851 and 889 J kg - 1 K - 1 for mineral phase, 3479 and 3505 J kg - 1 K - 1 for 19. 9 % bentonite + distilled water, and 2724 and 2758 J kg - 1 K - 1 for 39. 8 % bentonite + sea water. The results of this study can be used in the spas or <b>thermal</b> <b>centres</b> to determine the suitability and quality of the bentonitic muds for pelotherapy...|$|R

A fuzzy algorithm makes the decision which ensures the optimal energy-management based on PVP generation and appliances states with respect to energy-saving criteria. Validation is driven on a 1 Â kW peak (kWp) PVP and domestic appliances of different powers installed at the Energy and <b>Thermal</b> Research <b>Centre</b> (CRTEn) {{in the north of}} Tunisia. Results confirm that energy saved during daylight is 80 - 90 % of the PVP generated energy. Energy management Fuzzy decision Photovoltaic Energy saves...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. It is {{well known}} that {{microstructure}} evolution during rapid solidification depends on the rate between undercooling and solidification velocity. Microstructural evolution in a non-equilibrium solidification process depends critically on the melt undercooling and growth (solidification) velocities of competing phases. One way of obtaining metastable structures is by Thermal Spray Technology. Metastable coatings can be produced starting from microstructured powders through Atmospheric Plasma Spray (APS) technique, followed by a quenching route. The initial powders are melted during the spraying and deposited over a substrate that is quenched with nitrogen feeders, producing metastable coatings. The obtained coatings were characterized using XRD, SEM, FESEM and TEM in the <b>Thermal</b> Spray <b>Centre</b> (CPT) of the University of Barcelona. The properties of such coatings were studied by hardness, obtaining promising results...|$|R
