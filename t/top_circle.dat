40|$|One {{of us has}} {{frequently}} chosen a pot lid that was too big. Hypothesizing the error {{was a problem with}} foreshortening, we depicted a cylinder in parallel perspective, tilted 30 °, with the <b>top</b> <b>circle</b> foreshortened to a 2 D ellipse. Parallel projection provides foreshortening without convergence. Observers judged which of two 2 D ellipses was identical to the one depicting the cylinder’s top. One had the same dimensions as the ellipse depicting the cylinder top, 40 mm wide and 15 mm tall, and the other one was bigger, 41 x 18. The observers chose the bigger ellipse. An ellipse depicting a cylinder’s top may look bigger because of crosstalk from perceptual information for a circle in perspective. This information for a tilted 3 D surface “biases” perception [...] merely biasing the 2 D ellipse towards the circle. The 2 D ellipse’s apparent eccentricity is simply lessened [...] it does not {{go all the way to}} a perfect circle.

40|$|Elegant {{composite}} copy of Kâtip Çelebi's {{collection of}} chronological tables (through 1059 [1649]) intended as an index to his Fadhlakat al-tawārīkh [فذلكة التواريخ, or Fezleke], with continuation. The chronological tables are preceded by an introduction, followed by tables {{of the various}} pre-Islamic (see p. 141) and Islamic (see pp. 142 - 147) dynasties, and tables for the Ottoman sultans (see pp. 150 - 156), Şeyhülislam (pp. 167 - 175), Grand Viziers (pp. 180 - 193), etc. and closing matter (pp. 209 - 211). Final entry in the chronological tables is for the year 1277 [1861] {{with the death of}} Sultan Abdülmecid I and ascension of Sultan Abdülaziz I (see p. 129), though the tables are ruled and headed through the year 1321 [1903 - 4] (see p. 137). Origin: As appears at close of final table on p. 241, transcription of that section completed 1267 [1850 or 51]. Other sections continuing the tables likely date from around the same time, though later additions (by subsequent readers / owners) also appear (see final entry on p. 129 dating to 1277 [1861]). Many sections including the opening matter, opening of the chronological and other tables, khātimah, etc. appear to date much earlier, likely the late 17 th century given that the chronological matter for these sections ends around 1080 [1669 or 70] (see p. 95).
