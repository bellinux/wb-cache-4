25|$|In July 2007, it was {{reported}} that many taxi drivers were engaged in rampant illegal price-cutting in their competition with call-cab drivers for passengers. Rates offered were up to 20% lower than the metered fares on long-distance trips, with competition being particularly fierce on the airport route. The warring factions took turns to blockade Hong Kong International Airport to air their grievances. Andrew Cheng Kar-foo, chairman of the Legislative Council's transport panel, proposed cutting taxi fares to deal with illicit discounting. Representatives of call-cab drivers and taxi owners were opposed to the idea. Urban taxi groups have been lobbying for permission to impose a HK$1 per <b>trip</b> <b>fuel</b> surcharge when the price of liquefied petroleum gas per litre is between HK$3.10 and HK$4. Legislative Councillors unanimously passed a motion urging the government to allow taxis to impose the surcharge. However, the vote was non-binding on the Government. The Transportation Secretary rejected the appeal.|$|E
500|$|After the {{oil price}} rises of the 1970s, Airbus needed to {{minimise}} the <b>trip</b> <b>fuel</b> costs of the A320. To that end, it adopted composite primary structures, centre-of-gravity control using fuel, glass cockpit (EFIS) and a two-crew flight deck. The end result was that the A320 consumed 50% less fuel than the 727. According to a study cited by the Stockholm Environmental Institute, the A320 burns [...] of jet fuel flying between Los Angeles and New York City, which is about [...] per passenger in an A320 with 150 seats.|$|E
50|$|An {{alternative}} approach to fuel calculation is to calculate alternate and holding fuel as above and obtain some {{estimate of the}} total <b>trip</b> <b>fuel</b> requirement, either based on previous experience with that route and aircraft type, or by using some approximate formula; neither method can take much account of weather. Calculation can then proceed forward along the route, waypoint by waypoint. On reaching the destination, the actual <b>trip</b> <b>fuel</b> can {{be compared with the}} estimated <b>trip</b> <b>fuel,</b> a better estimate made, and the calculation repeated as required.|$|E

The trip {{experiences}} several dramatic delays such as car trouble, run-ins with law enforcement, unforeseen medical mishaps, and intervening locals. Additionally, it is revealed that Nate caused some professional trouble before leaving Syracuse and has ulterior motives for the Florida <b>trip,</b> <b>fueling</b> flashbacks and a framing device involving several law-enforcement agencies and an interrogation into his unspecified crimes.|$|R

50|$|Some {{iteration}} {{is generally}} required {{due to the}} need to calculate interdependent values. For instance, reserve fuel is often calculated as a percentage of <b>trip</b> <b>fuel,</b> but <b>trip</b> <b>fuel</b> cannot be calculated until the total weight of the aircraft is known, and this includes the weight of the reserve fuel.|$|E
5000|$|Calculation of fuel {{requirements}} (especially <b>trip</b> <b>fuel</b> and reserve fuel) {{is the most}} safety-critical aspect of flight planning. This calculation is somewhat complicated: ...|$|E

3000|$|The {{required}} {{power can be}} simplified as [...] P_iq = R_iq v_iq.

50|$|Landing {{weight is}} {{the weight of}} an {{aircraft}} as it lands at the destination. This is the brake release weight minus the <b>trip</b> <b>fuel</b> burned. It includes the zero fuel weight, unusable fuel, and all alternate, holding, and reserve fuel.|$|E
50|$|The maximum {{achievable}} saving {{depends on}} {{the position of the}} reclear fix. This position cannot be determined theoretically since there are no exact equations for <b>trip</b> <b>fuel</b> and reserve fuel. Even if it could be determined exactly, there may not be a waypoint at the right place.|$|E
50|$|For {{the flight}} from origin to {{destination}}, the weight on arrival at the destination can be taken as zero fuel weight plus alternate holding plus alternate fuel plus alternate reserve plus destination holding. A flight planning system can then work back along the route, calculating the <b>trip</b> <b>fuel</b> and reserve fuel one waypoint at a time, with the fuel required for each inter-waypoint segment forming part of the aircraft weight for the next segment to be calculated.|$|E

5000|$|The LeBaron was {{available}} with a <b>trip</b> & <b>fuel</b> economy computer and full instrumentation. For 1990, the LeBaron's interior was refreshed, featuring an all new dashboard, gauge cluster, door panels, and center console design.

50|$|A more {{detailed}} {{outline of the}} calculation follows. Several (possibly many) iterations are usually required, either to calculate interdependent values such as reserve fuel and <b>trip</b> <b>fuel,</b> or to cope with situations where some physical constraint has been exceeded. In the latter case it is usually necessary to reduce the payload (less cargo or fewer passengers). Some flight planning systems use elaborate systems of approximate equations to simultaneously estimate all the changes required; this can greatly {{reduce the number of}} iterations needed.|$|E
50|$|The {{hydraulic}} system is ineffective with heavy or viscous oils and {{not recommended for}} greater than 15-degree Baumé. Heating coils must be placed {{near the top of}} tanks, where they are less efficient. An hydraulic tanker requires a larger volume of void space for buoyancy than conventionally loaded tanks, because the empty, or ballasted, condition of tanks filled with water is heavier than the loaded condition of tanks filled with oil. A heavier ballasted condition may also increase round <b>trip</b> <b>fuel</b> consumption.|$|E

50|$|The Fusion CN250 found instant {{popularity}} in Japan. In Europe, the Japanese put Italian makers {{under pressure to}} improve their scooters' capabilities and reliability. In the U.S., the Helix was a hit with middle-aged and older people.

The CN250 was a capable machine complete with <b>trip</b> odometer, <b>fuel</b> and temperature gauges, glove compartment and trunk.|$|R
50|$|When {{fuel prices}} differ between airports, {{it might be}} worth putting in more fuel where it is cheap, even {{taking into account the}} cost of extra <b>trip</b> <b>fuel</b> needed to carry the extra weight. A flight {{planning}} system can work out how much extra fuel can profitably be carried. Note that discontinuities due to changes in flight levels can mean that a difference of as little as 100 kg (one passenger with luggage) in zero fuel weight or tankering fuel can make the difference between profit and loss.|$|E
5000|$|The basic {{purpose of}} a flight {{planning}} system is to calculate how much <b>trip</b> <b>fuel</b> is needed in the air navigation process by an aircraft when flying from an origin airport to a destination airport. Aircraft must also carry some reserve fuel to allow for unforeseen circumstances, such as an inaccurate weather forecast, or air traffic control requiring an aircraft to fly at a lower-than-optimal altitude due to congestion, or the addition of last-minute passengers whose weight was not accounted for when the flight plan was prepared. The way in which reserve fuel is determined varies greatly, depending on airline and locality. The most common methods are: ...|$|E

40|$|Hybrid Laminar Flow Control (HLFC) is {{an active}} drag {{reduction}} technique that permits extended laminar flow on an aircraft surface at chord Reynolds numbers normally associated with turbulent flow. The operational effectiveness of HLFC aircraft relates to {{the probability of a}} partial or complete loss of laminar flow. Four factors were considered: (1) Ice particles in cirrus clouds; (2) Insect contamination; (3) Mechanical failure; and (4) Damage to the suction surfaces. Two computer programs capable of determining the required fuel for a given mission profile have been developed for aircraft in the classes of the B 757 - 200 and the A 330 - 200. The programs were validated against published payload-range data, and modified to emulate the installation of a HLFC system, by incorporating changes to the drag polar, Specific Fuel Consumption (SFC) and Operating Empty Weight (OEW). Sensitivity studies were conducted. The results permit estimates to be determined of the <b>trip</b> <b>fuel</b> reduction of HLFC aircraft compared to equivalent turbulent aircraft. A conceptual design of a HLFC system has been developed for the reference aircraft. A SFC penalty of 1. 6 % was determined for the B 757 - 200 class aircraft (range: 3272 nm, payload: 19147 kg) and 2. 1 % for the A 330 - 200 class aircraft (range: 5980 nm, payload: 24035 kg) for a system capable of reducing the drag by approximately 14 %. The installed system weight represents 2. 0 % and 1. 6 % of the OEW for the B 757 - 200 and A 330 - 200 classes of aircraft respectively. The reduction in <b>trip</b> <b>fuel,</b> compared to the turbulent baseline vehicles, was estimated to be 7. 4 % for these conditions. To obtain the greatest benefit for a HLFC aircraft, the fuel planning must consider the probable time-in-cloud that will result in a loss of laminar flow. An optimised fuel planning approach, which requires a forecast of en route cirrus cloud, has been estimated to further reduce the <b>trip</b> <b>fuel</b> for long-range missions by 2. 5 - 3. 8 %...|$|E
40|$|Air routes {{are largely}} {{determined}} by the interaction of geographical, political, economic and social factors. And airlines use their aircraft for a diversity of missions. Because of both factors the actual utilization of transport aircraft is well inside the payload-range envelope, {{which means that the}} designs are oversized for most flights. The objective {{of this paper is to}} evaluate the savings that could be achieved if transport aircraft were designed for shorter ranges; i. e., closer to the actual utilization pattern. In this design scenario, the maximum take-off weight and the operating empty weight would be remarkably reduced. This would lead to a reduction in aircraft price, <b>trip</b> <b>fuel,</b> maintenance cost, and landing and navigation charges as well as environmental impact. Direct operating cost as will be used as figure of merit of the reduced range approach...|$|E
40|$|Choice {{behaviour}} studies typically assume passive bounded rationality, {{suggesting that}} decision makers process all information {{given to them}} with equal attention.

Utilising data from a study of urban road freight stakeholders evaluating alternative packages of component <b>trip</b> times, <b>fuel</b> costs and variable user charges, this paper shows that accounting for APS heterogeneity associate with each alternative in each choice set results in differing marginal disutilities and willingness to pay for components of travel time, compared to a model which assumes passive bounded rationality.
