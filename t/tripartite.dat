5|$|At {{the end of}} September 1940, the <b>Tripartite</b> Pact united Japan, Italy and Germany to formalise the Axis Powers. The <b>Tripartite</b> Pact {{stipulated that}} any country, with the {{exception}} of the Soviet Union, not in the war which attacked any Axis Power would be forced to go to war against all three. The Axis expanded in November 1940 when Hungary, Slovakia and Romania joined the <b>Tripartite</b> Pact. Romania would make a major contribution (as did Hungary) to the Axis war against the USSR, partially to recapture territory ceded to the USSR, partially to pursue its leader Ion Antonescu's desire to combat communism.|$|E
5|$|Aircraft for the <b>tripartite</b> {{evaluation}} squadron, nine built, six later {{transferred to}} the United States where they were designated XV-6A.|$|E
5|$|Taoism on {{the other}} hand also {{incorporated}} Buddhist elements during the Tang period, such as monasteries, vegetarianism, prohibition of alcohol, the doctrine of emptiness, and collecting scripture in <b>tripartite</b> organisation.|$|E
5|$|Under the <b>Tripartite</b> System, {{there were}} to be three types of schools, with pupils sitting an eleven plus exam to {{determine}} which type of school they would be sent to.|$|E
5|$|Brunei {{received}} {{an invitation from}} the <b>Tripartite</b> Commission to send a badminton player in the men's singles event, signifying the nation's Olympic debut in the sport. The <b>Tripartite</b> Commission is made in collaboration of the individual countries' committees, the International Olympic Committee, {{as well as the}} Badminton World Federation. Jaspar Yu Woon Chai participated in the men's singles event. Yu was seeded in group D together with Hu Yun of Hong Kong and Pablo Abián of Spain. Yu lost both sets against Hu on 12 August, the first 16–21 and the second 15–21. The following day, Yu also lost both sets against Abián. The first was 12–21 and the second 10–21. Hu went on to beat Abián on 14 August with two close sets, the former 21–18 and the latter 21–19.|$|E
5|$|Central Fighter Establishment - Kestrel (P.1127) Evaluation Squadron (also {{known as}} the <b>Tripartite</b> Evaluation Squadron), nine Kestrel {{aircraft}} allocated for evaluation in 1965. One aircraft was lost in an accident, six aircraft later passed to the United States Army, one to the Royal Aircraft Establishment and one to Hawker Siddeley for further trials.|$|E
5|$|During the Interwar, Belgium {{pursued a}} policy of {{political}} neutrality and attempted to avoid confrontation with Nazi Germany. When the Phony War broke out, Pierlot became {{the leader of a}} <b>tripartite</b> national government of Catholics, Liberals and Socialists which stayed in power until the German invasion in May 1940.|$|E
5|$|The Communist Party of Yugoslavia {{played no}} part in the coup, {{although}} it made {{a significant contribution to}} the mass street protests in many cities that signalled popular support for the coup after it occurred. The coup was successful and overthrew the three-member regency: Prince Paul, Dr. Radenko Stanković and Dr. Ivo Perović, as well as the government of Prime Minister Dragiša Cvetković. Two days before the coup, the Cvetković government had signed the Vienna Protocol on the Accession of Yugoslavia to the <b>Tripartite</b> Pact (Axis). The coup had been planned for several months, but the signing of the <b>Tripartite</b> Pact spurred the organisers to carry it out, encouraged by the British Special Operations Executive.|$|E
5|$|The Marshall Islands {{received}} {{an invitation from}} the <b>Tripartite</b> Commission for Mathlynn Sasser {{to compete in the}} women's lightweight category (58 kg), signifying the nation's Olympic weightlifting debut. Sasser had a total score of 199, placing eleventh. The medals in the event went to athletes from Thailand and Chinese Taipei.|$|E
5|$|The Nine Ministers, {{who were}} {{supervised}} by the Three Excellencies but not direct subordinates of the cabinet, each headed a specialized government ministry {{and held a}} salary-rank of Fully 2,000-dan. Along with the <b>tripartite</b> cabinet members, these ministers usually attended court conferences.|$|E
5|$|The {{proteasome}} is {{also involved}} in Intracellular antibody-mediated proteolysis of antibody-bound virions. In this neutralisation pathway, TRIM21 (a protein of the <b>tripartite</b> motif family) binds with immunoglobulin G to direct the virion to the proteasome where it is degraded.|$|E
5|$|When the <b>tripartite</b> {{agreements}} were signed, the Belgian Government {{said that}} it had {{serious questions about the}} compatibility of this agreement with the Schengen Convention and the principle of free movement of people enshrined in various European Treaties.|$|E
5|$|After the war, the Selarang Barracks {{became the}} home {{for most of the}} Australian Army units of ANZUK, a <b>tripartite</b> force formed by Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom to defend the Asia-Pacific region, until its disbandment in 1974. Today, Selarang Barracks is the {{headquarters}} for the 9th Division of the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF), and access to the camp is restricted.|$|E
5|$|Byzantine {{education}} {{was the product}} of an ancient Greek educational tradition that stretched back to the 5th century BC. It comprised a <b>tripartite</b> system of education that, taking shape during the Hellenistic era, was maintained, with inevitable changes, up until the fall of Constantinople. The stages of education were the elementary school, where pupils ranged from six to ten years, secondary school, where pupils ranged from ten to sixteen, and higher education.|$|E
5|$|Grenada sent one boxer to the Olympic boxing tournament. Rolande Moses {{had fought}} nine boxing matches, {{including}} {{one at the}} 2007 World Championships for boxing in Chicago, since starting before he attempted the Olympic qualification event in Trinidad and Tobago. He lost in the qualifying event, although was selected by the <b>Tripartite</b> Commission to attend the Beijing Olympics to supplement the Grenada Olympic team, which historically had had less than six people and thus qualified for the aid.|$|E
5|$|In February 1941, the German Afrika Korps {{arrived in}} Libya {{to aid the}} Italians in the North African Campaign and attempt to contain Commonwealth forces {{stationed}} in Egypt. On 6 April, Germany launched the invasion of Yugoslavia and the battle of Greece. German efforts to secure oil included negotiating a supply from their new ally, Romania, who signed the <b>Tripartite</b> Pact in November 1940.|$|E
5|$|Leonardo Bruni was {{the first}} to use <b>tripartite</b> periodization in his History of the Florentine People (1442). Bruni's first two periods were based on those of Petrarch, but he added a third period because he {{believed}} that Italy was no longer in a state of decline. Flavio Biondo used a similar framework in Decades of History from the Deterioration of the Roman Empire (1439–1453).|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, as the Fatimids regrouped, the Kalb {{had been}} {{repelled}} from Damascus, and in 1028, their emir died. He {{was replaced by}} his nephew, Rafi ibn Abi'l Layl, who defected to the Fatimids, thus weakening the <b>tripartite</b> Bedouin alliance. In November 1028, Anushtakin returned to Palestine with a large Fatimid army and additional horsemen from the Kalb and Banu Fazara to drive out the Tayy, and also to evict the Mirdasids from central Syria.|$|E
5|$|On 27 September 1940, the <b>Tripartite</b> Pact {{was signed}} in Berlin by Saburō Kurusu of Imperial Japan, Hitler, and Italian foreign {{minister}} Ciano, and later expanded to include Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria, thus yielding the Axis powers. Hitler's attempt to integrate the Soviet Union into the anti-British bloc failed after inconclusive talks between Hitler and Molotov in Berlin in November, and he ordered preparations for {{the invasion of the}} Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|Once the Regular Army {{had been}} {{organised}} as a continental Expeditionary Force, {{it would be}} necessary to provide forces for home defence. Haldane's proposal anticipated that the existing <b>tripartite</b> division of the Army - the Regular Army, the Volunteers/Yeomanry and the Militia - should be changed into a two-part structure, with an Expeditionary Force and a home-defence Territorial Force based on County Associations.|$|E
5|$|Pilophorus acicularis is a <b>tripartite</b> lichen—containing a fungus, a green alga, and a cyanobacterium. Cephalodia (lichenized aggregations of nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria) {{are present}} on the primary thallus; smaller cephalodia {{are also on the}} pseudopodetia. Hemispherical to irregularly shaped, and light to dark brown in color, they contain species from the genus Nostoc. The green algal {{photosynthetic}} symbiont (photobiont) associated with P.acicularis is Asterochloris magna (formerly Trebouxia magna).|$|E
5|$|Prince Paul {{was found}} guilty of war crimes in September 1945 {{for his role in the}} Yugoslav {{accession}} to the <b>Tripartite</b> Pact. In 2011, a High Court in Serbia found the sentence to be politically and ideologically motivated and Prince Paul was officially rehabilitated. A similar decision had been made in 2009 to rehabilitate Cvetković for war crimes charges relating to the signing of the pact.|$|E
5|$|Tanzania {{competed in}} Olympic judo {{for the first}} time in 2016. The nation {{received}} an invitation from the <b>Tripartite</b> Commission to send one judoka to the Games in the men's 73 kg category and selected Andrew Thomas Mlugu. He had previous international experience from having competed at the 2014 Commonwealth Games. In Rio, Mlugu was defeated in his opening bout by Jake Bensted of Australia and eliminated from the tournament.|$|E
5|$|The Tempest can be {{interpreted}} as Shakespeare's last treatise on the human soul, in particular the Renaissance conception of the <b>tripartite</b> soul divided into vegetative, sensitive, and rational spheres, as described in Plato's <b>tripartite</b> theory of soul and Christian Philosophy. This was later also described in Sigmund Freud's id, ego and super-ego which was first linked to The Tempest in the 1956 screenplay for Forbidden Planet by Cyril Hume, Irving Block, and Allen Adler. The film presents Caliban reinterpreted as the 'monster from the Id', although the theory is dismissed as 'obsolete' in that imagined future, and was also dismissed by James E Phillips in 1964. Prospero is exiled to an island with a symbol of his baser, 'vegetative' nature – Caliban – and his higher, 'sensitive' or supernatural side – Ariel. Some productions have seen the same actor play all three roles, making them symbols of the conflict within a fully actualised or awakened Prospero – that between crude selfish physicality and a higher, mystical side.|$|E
5|$|The {{resulting}} skyscrapers reflected these debates: the Railway Exchange, the Peoples Gas and the Illinois Continental and Commercial Bank Buildings {{were each}} substantial, quarter-block wide palazzo cubes of common height, their facades divided into a classical <b>tripartite</b> design, and sporting classical columns and other features. Despite the apparent uniformity of design, individual buildings varied considerably in the detail {{of their designs}} in effort to express their particular identities, the Peoples Gas Building using texture and the Railway Exchange Building white terracotta, for example.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} moved to Wilhelmshaven over the summer under British control while the {{division}} of the surviving warships was decided among the victorious Allies. While this was being argued the ships were overhauled with a small maintenance crew aboard to preserve their value. The Allied <b>Tripartite</b> Commission allocated Steinbrinck to the Soviet Union at the end of 1945 and she sailed for Libau on 2 January 1946.|$|E
5|$|The {{status was}} {{introduced}} by the Education Act 1944 as a modification of an existing direct grant scheme to privately endowed schools. There were 179 direct grant grammar schools, which, together with over 1,200 grammar schools maintained by local authorities, formed the most academic tier of the <b>Tripartite</b> System. They varied greatly in size and composition, but, on average, achieved higher academic results than either maintained grammar schools or independent schools.|$|E
5|$|Wilton's last {{appearance}} in 2008 coincided with producer Phil Collinson's final episodes; she was keen {{to make a}} final return {{as she had been}} there for Collinson's first episodes as producer. Harriet is killed off in the penultimate episode of the show's fourth series in which she sacrifices her own life to help prevent a Dalek takeover of Earth. Harriet's final scenes were designed to complete a <b>tripartite</b> story arc and to give the character redemption.|$|E
5|$|After much discussion, Harrison, who {{coordinated the}} meetings, {{determined}} that a design based on Niemeyer's project 32 and Le Corbusier's project 23 would be developed for the final project. Le Corbusier's project 23 consisted of a large block containing both the Assembly Hall and the Council Chambers {{near the center of}} the site with the Secretariat tower emerging as a slab from the south. Niemeyer's plan was closer to that actually constructed, with a distinctive General Assembly building, a long low horizontal block housing the other meeting rooms, and a tall tower for the Secretariat. The complex as built, however, repositioned Niemeyer's General Assembly building to the north of this <b>tripartite</b> composition. This plan included a public plaza as well.|$|E
5|$|After unrelenting {{political}} pressure from Adolf Hitler, Yugoslavia signed the <b>Tripartite</b> Pact on 25 March 1941. On 27 March, {{a military coup}} d'état overthrew the government that had signed the pact, and a new government was formed under {{the commander of the}} VVKJ, Armijski đeneral Dušan Simović. A general mobilisation was not initiated by the new government until 3 April 1941, out of fear of offending Hitler and thus precipitating war. However, on the same day as the coup, Hitler issued Führer Directive 25 which called for Yugoslavia to be treated as a hostile state, and on 3 April, Führer Directive 26 was issued, detailing the plan of attack and command structure for the German-led Axis invasion.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of the Games, Fred Yannick Uwase was the {{youngest}} male competitor representing Rwanda at the age of 18. He was the country's sole representative in Judo and had not taken part in any previous Olympic Games. Uwase was issued with a wildcard by the <b>Tripartite</b> Commission to compete in the Games after being defeated in the third round of the 2012 African Judo Championships by Mazou Abaker Mbairo. He became the first Rwandan judoka to qualify for the Olympic Games. Uwase received a bye in the first round and faced Brazilian athlete Bruno Mendonça on 30 July. He was defeated by his opponent in a 53-second match and thus was unable to advance to the third round of the competition.|$|E
5|$|Belize {{received}} a universality invitation from the <b>Tripartite</b> Commission {{to send a}} judoka competing in the men's middleweight category (90kg) to the Olympics. This was Renick James's Olympic debut. He participated in the men's 90 kilograms event. Only six judokas participated in the round of 64, and James {{was not one of}} them. He lost 100-000 in the round of 32 against Ovini Uera of Nauru. Uera went on to lose his next bout against Varlam Liparteliani of Georgia. Liparteliani also went on to win a silver medal.|$|E
5|$|Bulgaria's {{relationship}} with its neighbours since 1990 {{has generally been}} good. The country also {{plays an important role}} in promoting regional security. Bulgaria has an active <b>tripartite</b> economic and diplomatic collaboration with Romania and Greece, maintains strong relations with EU members, the United States, and Russia, and continues to improve its traditionally good ties with China and Vietnam. The HIV trial in Libya, which followed after the imprisonment of several Bulgarian nurses in Benghazi in 1998, had a significant impact on relations between Bulgaria, the European Union, and Libya. It resulted in the release of the nurses by Muammar Gaddafi's government, which was granted a contract to receive a nuclear reactor and weapons supplies from France in exchange.|$|E
5|$|Decorative tiles {{designed}} by Henry Chapman Mercer—one {{of the leading}} figures of the Arts and Crafts Movement in the U.S.—are placed throughout the building. These tiles (known as Moravian tiles after Mercer's Moravian Pottery and Tile Works) feature deep colors and a handmade appearance that complement the simple brick buildings. The tiles on the fireplaces and entry floors boast patterns in literary and educational themes, such as The Canterbury Tales in the old library. A large, <b>tripartite</b> tile mural on the north wall of the courtyard, also by Mercer, depicts the eastern and western hemispheres united by a ship on an allegorical journey of education.|$|E
5|$|Eddermys Sanchez {{represented}} Belize in men's judo. He qualified {{by being}} awarded an invitational {{place by the}} <b>Tripartite</b> Commission in June 2012. Sanchez {{took part in the}} men's half-lightweight class, which included athletes under 66 kilograms in weight. He was the oldest person to represent Belize at the London Games at the age of 32, and made his first appearance in the quadrennial event. Sanchez faced Miklós Ungvári of Hungary in the Round of 32 after receiving a bye and was defeated by his opponent after 19 seconds and therefore eliminated from the competition.|$|E
