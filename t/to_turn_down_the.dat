The role was recast with Kathy Bates. In 1998, she starred as Lizzie Brooks in Forever Love, which was based upon McEntire's hit single of the same name.|$|E
5|$|The Finns {{had many}} reasons <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Soviet proposals. Finland had started {{negotiations}} {{for a military}} co-operation with Sweden, and the Finns had great hopes for the joint Finnish–Swedish defense for the Ålands islands {{and did not want}} to jeopardize these negotiations. In addition, the violent collectivization, purges, show trials and executions in Stalin's Soviet Union had given the country a bad reputation. Furthermore, most of the Finnish Communist leadership in the Soviet Union was executed during the Great Purge. The Soviet Union did not therefore seem to be a reliable contracting party. The Soviet envoys sent to negotiate with Finns were officially of relatively low rank, but as Väinö Tanner put it later, the Finns assumed rightly that they represented of some higher organ of State, probably the Soviet secret police NKVD.|$|E

The 5th Light Horse Brigade was still at Jenin on 25 September, {{the last day of}} the Battle of Megiddo, when it was ordered to send a regiment to reinforce the 4th Light Horse Brigade's pre-dawn attack on Samakh.

25|$|Sparhawk-Jones' {{first love}} was Morton Livingston Schamberg, {{who was a}} fellow artist and student at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts.

25|$|The {{shock of}} losing to Sunderland {{and the manner}} of defeat in Greece caused Revie <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Everton {{managers}} job, and inspired his team to attempt {{to go through the}} following league season unbeaten. In Revie's final season in charge, Leeds won the 1973–74 title going 29 matches unbeaten, eventually losing away to Stoke. This was still a record unbeaten start to a league campaign in the 20th century, and not bettered until Arsenal's 2003–04 campaign.

25|$|With the BLRC now {{halfway through}} the door, Britain sent a team to the Tour de France in 1955. It was the first team ever sent since the {{previous}} riders, Bill Burl and Charles Holland had competed as private entrants before the war. <b>To</b> <b>turn</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Tour was something the NCU wouldn't do and yet it couldn't select riders who were BLRC members. To leave out BLRC members, however, would be to send a weakened team and antagonise a wavering UCI. Yet the BLRC could not select a team because the Union Cycliste Internationale didn't formally recognise it. The conundrum was solved by asking a panel of newspaper reporters {{to do the job}} instead.|$|E
25|$|Wing was set {{to appear}} in a stage play of Adrian Mole, which would have clashed with the filming of EastEnders.
