5|$|A study {{published}} in the Neuropsychopharmacology journal in 2013 revealed the finding that the flavour of beer alone could provoke dopamine activity in the brain of the male participants, who wanted to drink more as a result. The 49 men in the study were subject to positron emission tomography scans, while a computer-controlled device sprayed minute amounts of beer, water and a sports drink onto their tongues. Compared with the <b>taste</b> <b>of</b> the sports drink, the <b>taste</b> <b>of</b> beer significantly increased the participants desire to drink. Test results indicated that the flavour of the beer triggered a dopamine release, even though alcohol content in the spray was insufficient for the purpose of becoming intoxicated.|$|E

40|$|Taste aversion {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that rats conditioned to avoid monosodium glutamate (MSG) with amiloride added to reduce the intensity of the sodium component <b>of</b> MSG <b>taste,</b> generalize this aversion to aspartic acid and to L-AP 4, but not to ionotropic glutamate receptor agonists. That is, MSG, L-AP 4 and aspartate have similar tastes to rats. However, conditioned taste aversion methods are unable to show to what extent the <b>tastes</b> <b>of</b> two substances are different. If two substances activate the same afferent processes (e. g. taste receptors), they are likely to produce the same tastes, but if they activate different afferent processes, the subject may detect differences between the <b>tastes</b> <b>of</b> the substances. In this study, rats were tested to determine if they could discriminate between the <b>tastes</b> <b>of</b> these agonists and MSG. We also established the detection thresh-olds for NMDA, aspartic acid and L-AP 4, with and without amiloride (a sodium channel antagonist). Taste threshold values were 1 – 4 mM for NMDA and aspartic acid and 0. 5 – 2. 5 µM for L-AP 4. None were affected by 30 µM amiloride. Rats could readily distinguish between the <b>tastes</b> <b>of</b> MSG and NMDA but they had difficulty discriminating between the <b>tastes</b> <b>of</b> aspartic acid and MSG. Rats could also easily distinguish between 10 – 100 mM MSG and 0. 01 – 5 mM L-AP 4. However, in two separate experiments error rates increased significantly when L-AP 4 concentrations were between 10 – 100 mM, indicating that the <b>tastes</b> <b>of</b> L-AP 4 and MSG were similar at these concentrations...|$|R
