50|$|Cylindromatosis (<b>turban</b> <b>tumor</b> syndrome), {{also known}} as CYLD, is a human gene.|$|E
5000|$|Multiple cylindromas {{may grow}} {{together}} in a [...] "hat-like" [...] configuration, {{sometimes referred to as}} a <b>turban</b> <b>tumor.</b> Cylindromas are uncommon dysplasias of skin appendages.|$|E
40|$|Cylindromas are benign tumors {{appearing}} as small solitary slow growing nodules {{on the head}} and neck. Multiple cylindromas may form a <b>turban</b> <b>tumor.</b> Here, we report an unusual case of multiple cylindroma with transformation to cylindrocarcinoma. The patient is a 61 -year-old woman who developed a cylindrocarcinoma on a pre-existing cylindroma of head and neck, with deformity of head due to soft tissue masses, lytic lesions of scalp with invasion to brain, and destruction of orbit leading to unilateral visual loss...|$|E
40|$|Cylindroma is {{a benign}} skin adnexal tumor of eccrine differentiation. Clinically, they are disfiguring lesions that can mimic a malignancy. Cylindromas can be single or {{multiple}} and commonly involve the scalp (<b>turban</b> <b>tumor)</b> and face. Multiple cylindromas {{can have a}} syndromic association as seen in Brooke–Spiegler syndrome and familial cylindromatosis. We present a case of non familial cylindroma of the face that clinically mimicked a basal cell carcinoma. The histopathology was confirmatory. Herein we also highlight the utility of a simple and inexpensive histochemical stain Periodic Acid Schiff in supporting the diagnosis...|$|E
40|$|Brooke–Spiegler {{syndrome}} (BSS, familial cylindromatosis or <b>turban</b> <b>tumor</b> syndrome) is {{an inherited}} disease characterized by neoplasms {{of the skin}} appendages such as cylindroma, trichoepithelioma, and spiradenoma. The disease has been mapped to 16 q 12 - 13, and mutations in the CYLD gene {{have been identified in}} families with this disorder. Of interest, multiple familial trichoepithelioma (MFT) {{has been described as a}} distinct disorder characterized by the familial occurrence of trichoepitheliomas. MFT has been mapped to 9 p 21; however, to date a candidate gene has not been identified. In this report, we describe a four-generation family with BSS presenting predominantly with trichoepitheliomas (resembling MFT phenotype). We identified a novel missense mutation in the CYLD gene, designated E 474 G, in the affected individuals of this family. Our findings exemplify clinical heterogeneity within BSS and extend the body of evidence that mutations in CYLD are implicated in this disease. Although not conclusive, these findings suggest that BSS and MFT may represent a single entity...|$|E
40|$|Familial cylindromatosis (<b>turban</b> <b>tumor</b> syndrome; Brooke–Spiegler syndrome) (OMIM numbers 123850, 132700, 313100, and 605041) {{is a rare}} {{autosomal}} dominantly inherited tumor syndrome. The disorder {{can present}} with cutaneous adnexal tumors such as cylindromas, trichoepitheliomas, and spiradenomas, and tumors preferably develop in hairy areas of the body such as head and neck. In affected families, mutations have been demonstrated in the CYLD gene located on chromosome 16 q 12 – 13 and reveal the characteristic attributes of a tumor suppressor. Here, we studied familial cylindromatosis in a multigeneration family of German origin. Clinically, some individuals only revealed discrete small skin-colored tumors localized in the nasolabial region whereas one family member showed expansion of multiple big tumors on the trunk and in a turban-like fashion on the scalp. Histologically, cylindromas as well as epithelioma adenoides cysticum were found. We detected a frameshift mutation in the CYLD gene, designated 2253 delG, underlying the disorder {{and were able to}} show that a single mutation can result in distinct clinical and histologic expression in familial cylindromatosis. The reasons for different expression patterns of the same genetic defect in this disease remain elusive, however. Identification of mutations in the CYLD gene enable us to rapidly confirm putative diagnoses on the genetic level and to provide affected families with genetic counseling...|$|E
40|$|In vivo {{resistance}} to first-line chemotherapy, including to glucocorticoids, {{is a strong}} predictor of poor outcome in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Modulation of cell death regulators represents an attractive strategy for subverting such drug resistance. Here we report complete resensitization of multidrug-resistant childhood ALL cells to glucocorticoids and other cytotoxic agents with subcytotoxic concentrations of obatoclax, a putative antagonist of BCL- 2 family members. The reversal of glucocorticoid resistance occurred through rapid activation of autophagy-dependent necroptosis, which bypassed the block in mitochondrial apoptosis. This effect was associated with dissociation of the autophagy inducer beclin- 1 from the antiapoptotic BCL- 2 family member myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (MCL- 1) and with a marked decrease in mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activity. Consistent with a protective role for mTOR in glucocorticoid resistance in childhood ALL, combination of rapamycin with the glucocorticoid dexamethasone triggered autophagy-dependent cell death, with characteristic features of necroptosis. Execution of cell death, but not induction of autophagy, was strictly dependent on expression of receptor-interacting protein (RIP- 1) kinase and cylindromatosis (<b>turban</b> <b>tumor</b> syndrome) (CYLD), two key regulators of necroptosis. Accordingly, both inhibition of RIP- 1 and interference with CYLD restored glucocorticoid resistance completely. Together with evidence for a chemosensitizing activity of obatoclax in vivo, our data provide a compelling rationale for clinical translation of this pharmacological approach into treatments for patients with refractory ALL...|$|E
40|$|Background The {{differential}} pathophysiologic {{mechanisms that}} trigger {{and maintain the}} two forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn disease (CD), and ulcerative colitis (UC) are only partially understood. cDNA microarrays {{can be used to}} decipher gene regulation events at a genome-wide level and to identify novel unknown genes that might be involved in perpetuating inflammatory disease progression. Methods and Findings High-density cDNA microarrays representing 33, 792 UniGene clusters were prepared. Biopsies were taken from the sigmoid colon of normal controls (n = 11), CD patients (n = 10) and UC patients (n = 10). 33 P-radiolabeled cDNA from purified poly(A) + RNA extracted from biopsies (unpooled) was hybridized to the arrays. We identified 500 and 272 transcripts differentially regulated in CD and UC, respectively. Interesting hits were independently verified by real-time PCR in a second sample of 100 individuals, and immunohistochemistry was used for exemplary localization. The main findings point to novel molecules important in abnormal immune regulation and the highly disturbed cell biology of colonic epithelial cells in IBD pathogenesis, e. g., CYLD (cylindromatosis, <b>turban</b> <b>tumor</b> syndrome) and CDH 11 (cadherin 11, type 2). By the nature of the array setup, many of the genes identified were to our knowledge previously uncharacterized, and prediction of the putative function of a subsection of these genes indicate that some could be involved in early events in disease pathophysiology. Conclusion A comprehensive set of candidate genes not previously associated with IBD was revealed, which underlines the polygenic and complex nature of the disease. It points out substantial differences in pathophysiology between CD and UC. The multiple unknown genes identified may stimulate new research in the fields of barrier mechanisms and cell signalling in the context of IBD, and ultimately new therapeutic approaches...|$|E
40|$|International audienceBackground: Asthma is a {{heterogeneous}} disease in which age-of-onset {{plays an important}} role. Objective: We sought to identify the genetic variants associated with time-to-asthma onset. Methods: We conducted a large-scale meta-analysis of nine genome-wide association studies of time-to-asthma onset (total of 5, 462 asthmatics with {{a broad range of}} age-of-asthma onset and 8, 424 controls of European ancestry) performed using survival analysis techniques. Results: We detected five regions associated with time-to-asthma onset at genome-wide significant level (P< 5 x 10 - 8). We evidenced a new locus in 16 q 12 region (near cylindromatosis <b>turban</b> <b>tumor</b> syndrome gene (CYLD)) and confirmed four asthma risk regions: 2 q 12 (IL 1 RL 1), 6 p 21 (HLA-DQA 1), 9 p 24 (IL 33) and 17 q 12 -q 21 (ZPBP 2 -GSDMA). Conditional analyses identified two distinct signals at 9 p 24 (both upstream of IL 33) and at 17 q 12 -q 21 (near ZPBP 2 and within GSDMA). These seven distinct loci explained together 6. 0 % of the variance in time-to-asthma onset. In addition, we showed that genetic variants at 9 p 24 and 17 q 12 -q 21 were strongly associated with an earlier onset of childhood asthma (P≤ 0. 002) whereas 16 q 12 SNP was associated with a later asthma onset (P= 0. 04). A high burden of disease risk alleles at these loci was associated with earlier age-of-asthma onset (4 years versus 9 - 12 years, P= 10 - 4). Conclusion: The new susceptibility region for time-to-asthma onset at 16 q 12 harbors variants that correlate with the expression of CYLD and NOD 2 (nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 2), two strong candidates for asthma. This study demonstrates that incorporating the variability of age-of-asthma onset in asthma modeling is a helpful approach in the search for disease susceptibility genes...|$|E
