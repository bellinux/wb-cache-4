40|$|Unfocused for sensing diffuse surface • Low cost {{plastic housing}} • Enhanced {{signal to noise}} ratio • Reduced ambient light {{sensitivity}} Product Photo Here Description: OPB 608 reflective switches consist of an infrared emitting device (LED or VCSEL) and a NPN silicon phototransistor mounted “side-by-side ” on a parallel axis in a black opaque plastic housing. All OPB 608 ’s (except OPB 608 R) have an emitting device and a phototransistor that are encapsulated in a visible filtering epoxy. The phototransistor responds to radiation from the emitter only when a reflective object passes within its field of view. The phototransistor has enhanced low current roll-off to improve the contrast ratio and immunity to background irradiance. LED versions are designed for near-field applications. The VCSEL version is designed for longer distances. OPB 608 A, OPB 608 B and OPB 608 C devices are designed for applications with reflective distances between 0. 050 ” (1. 270 mm) and 0. 375 ” (9. 525 mm). OPB 608 V is designed for applications with reflective distances between 0. 050 ” (1. 270 mm) and 1. 200 ” (30. 480 mm). All of these are designed for light patterns not visible to the human eye. By utilizing the night enhancement function of a camera, the near infrared light pattern can be seen. This allows a user to see the pattern shining on the reflective object. OPB 608 R is designed for applications with reflective distances between 0. 050 ” (1. 270 mm) and 0. 300 ” (7. 620 mm). It is designed for light patterns visible to the human eye. The efficiency of this sensor is lower for optical wavelengths in the visible range, thus reducing the distance that can be used. Reflective distances are dependent upon the drive current for the light emitting device, the wavelength of the light source, and the type of reflective material; therefore, each application should be checked for the ability to meet each requirement.

40|$|Abstract. The {{automation}} {{of mobile}} working equipment used in farming, forestry {{and the construction}} industry has great market potential. Tasks of a highly complex nature could be executed without intervention of the operator. Despite the potential significance of this topic, only very few results of international research projects in robotics have heretofore been applied in the serial production of commercial vehicles. The joint project AMoBa (Autonomer Mobiler Bagger, Autonomous Mobile Excavator) of Kaiserslautern University and Volvo CE aims to transfer knowledge and experience {{from the field of}} robotics to the area of mobile excavators. The objective is the realization of fully autonomous operation in basic construction activities, such as terrain modeling or trenching. For this purpose a prototype is being prepared by modifying an 18 t Volvo Mobile Excavator to meet the project’s requirements. It is being equipped with electronic interfaces to control all relevant functions; i. e. the hydraulic arm cylinders, thereby employing sensor devices for the acquisition of the kinematics (i. e. <b>travel</b> <b>sensors</b> or angular sensors) and sensors for the acquisition of the environment surrounding the robotic excavator. For example, 2 -D laser scanning devices and 3 D cameras. Mechanical and hydraulic simulation models are being created to enable studies of suitable algorithms for trajectory control of the excavators’ kinematics. Algorithms concerning the global task of processing the automation task are developed and tested in the software framework MCA 2 before they are ported to the prototype. The MCA 2 framework combines the simulation of the excavator and its environment, including the simulation of environment sensors. On completion of this project, the algorithms developed in the simulation will be verified on the prototype. ...|$|R

In this paper, to improve localization accuracy when GPS fails, we propose a sequential state estimation method that fuses data from a GPS device, an electronic compass, a video camera, and wheel encoders using a particle filter. We process images from the camera using a color histogram-based method to identify the road and non-road regions in the field of view in front of the vehicle. In two experiments, in simulation and on a real vehicle, we demonstrate that, compared to a standard extended Kalman filter not using image data, our method significantly improves lateral localization error during periods of GPS inaccuracy.
