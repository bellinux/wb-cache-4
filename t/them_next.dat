5|$|The {{original}} {{bridge was}} {{built over the}} Lakhish River (Wadi Sukrir/Wadi Fakhira) during the Roman period, and re-built by the Ottoman Empire {{at the end of}} the 19th century. A parallel railway bridge was added when the coastal railway (Lebanon–Egypt) was laid. After numerous armed raids in the area during the 1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine, the British authorities set up a series of pillboxes in the area, one of <b>them</b> <b>next</b> to the bridges.|$|E

5|$|All {{four main}} Einsatzgruppen {{took part in}} mass shootings {{from the early days}} of the war. Initially the targets were adult Jewish men, but by August the net had been widened to include women, children, and the elderly—the entire Jewish population. Initially there was a semblance of {{legality}} given to the shootings, with trumped-up charges being read out (arson, sabotage, black marketeering, or refusal to work, for example) and victims being killed by a firing squad. As this method proved too slow, the Einsatzkommandos began to take their victims out in larger groups and shot <b>them</b> <b>next</b> to, or even inside, mass graves that had been prepared. Some Einsatzkommandos started to use automatic weapons, with survivors being killed with a pistol shot.|$|E

25|$|While Favorite was sailing under Commander John Davie, L'Hermite's {{squadron}} captured her on 6 January 1806.

Favourite cast off her tow and attempted to move to windward of the strangers but lost track of <b>them.</b> <b>Next</b> morning Favourite saw {{what appeared to be}} three large East Indiamen with a brig as escort, sailing towards her. As they closed, Davie realized that the strange vessels were a ship of the line, two frigates and a sloop. He tried to sail away, but eventually had to surrender when he found himself trapped between Régulus and Président. The French brought their prize into service as Favorite.|$|E
25|$|Stateless musical {{style is}} often {{described}} as a cross between Radiohead and DJ Shadow, as well as reminiscent to that of bands as Portishead, Coldplay, UNKLE and Massive Attack. When growing up they state to have drawn influence from the Britpop movement and many other more guitar-oriented bands. Coming from this more traditional rock background, Stateless got heavily influenced by electronic music, dance music, hip hop and trip hop. It was planned from the start not to be a guitar oriented band. They left guitars behind and started playing with turntables and samplers, using them as an instrument as in a regular band and incorporating <b>them</b> <b>next</b> to more conventional instruments as keyboards, bass guitar and drums for creating their sound.|$|E

25|$|In some fonts, if the {{lowercase}} letters fi {{are placed}} adjacently, the dot-like {{upper end of}} the f would fall inconveniently close to the dot of the i, and therefore a ligature glyph is provided with the top of the f extended to serve as the dot of the i. A similar ligature for ffi is also possible. Since the unligatured forms are unattractive and the ligatures make the i dotless, such fonts are not appropriate for use in a Turkish setting. However, the fi ligatures of some fonts do not merge the letters and instead space <b>them</b> <b>next</b> to each other, with the dot on the i remaining. Such fonts are appropriate for Turkish, but the writer must be careful to be consistent in the use of ligatures.|$|E
25|$|On {{the north}} facing cornice and {{from left to}} right are depictions of Jesus praying in Gethsemane with Saint John next to him, Saint Peter and James, son of Zebedee, a guard {{restraining}} Saint Peter who holds the sword with which he has just cut off the ear of Malchus, Jesus and Judas with Malchus on the ground before <b>them.</b> <b>Next,</b> come statues depicting the three soldiers who helped with the arrest of Jesus and a fourth who holds a rope this followed by Jesus' being brought before Caiaphas. Above the frieze we firstly see some soldiers carrying whips, then Jesus tied to a column with two more soldiers in attendance. The scene is set for his flagellation. Next the crown of thorns is pressed on to Christ's head whilst at his feet, a soldier taps him with a reed. Jesus is now presented to Pontius Pilate and a Jew who stands to Jesus' right and makes his accusations.|$|E
25|$|Initially {{the rebels}} {{concealed}} their motives, declaring that {{they intended to}} join the campaign. Yet their failure to arrive ultimately forced Köprülü Mehmed to depart without them, and he set off toward the frontier on 24 June 1658. It {{was only then that}} Abaza Hasan and his compatriots revealed their true intentions by sending an emissary to Sultan Mehmed IV, and declaring that continuing to serve the state was intolerable so long as Köprülü Mehmed was not killed. They stated that their revolt was a response to the grand vizier having killed so many innocent men, and their fear that he would turn on <b>them</b> <b>next.</b> The rebel army then began its march from Konya to Bursa, the premier city of Ottoman Anatolia. Along the way Abaza Hasan issued orders preventing his troops from looting the countryside in an attempt to establish his public image as a fighter for justice. Yet even when his army surrounded Bursa and occupied the nearby towns and villages, the sultan continued to decisively stand behind his grand vizier and reject the demands of the rebels, referring to them as the servants of the Devil. Bursa successfully resisted the rebels throughout thirty days of siege, despite the defection of its commander Kenan Pasha to the rebel side. Abaza Hasan's failure to capture this city proved decisive in undermining the long-term viability of his revolt.|$|E

500|$|Rotheram's command {{lasted for}} two and half years, until he was {{superseded}} on 8 June 1808 by Captain Samuel Warren. Warren was ordered to take Bellerophon and join the fleet in the North Sea, blockading the Dutch ports. She formed part of Rear-Admiral Alan Gardner's squadron. By 1809 the strategic situation in the Baltic had deteriorated after Russia signed the Treaties of Tilsit and began to support France. Bellerophon was ordered to join the fleet stationed in the Baltic under Admiral Sir James Saumarez. Saumarez dispatched Bellerophon and [...] north to the Gulf of Finland in June, and on 19 June the two ships came across three suspicious looking luggers, anchored off Hango. The water was too shallow {{to allow them to}} approach the luggers, so a boat party was dispatched under Bellerophons Lieutenant Robert Pilch. The British boarded the luggers, but found themselves in a trap, when numerous Russian shore batteries and several gunboats opened fire on them. Pilch promptly ordered the luggers to be burnt, reboarded his men and landed <b>them</b> <b>next</b> to the nearest Russian shore battery. The battery, defended by 100 sailors, was stormed and carried, the British spiked the guns and destroyed the magazine, before returning to the ships with only five men wounded.|$|E
