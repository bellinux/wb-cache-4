EPA met both the second and third of the short-term goals in August 1998. A Federal Register notice dated August 6, 1998 published the list of compliance technologies that systems can use to comply with all of the other NPDWRs and the findings concerning variance <b>technologies</b> <b>for</b> the contaminants regulated before 1996.
