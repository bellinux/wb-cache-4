Only men are allowed to enter this floor. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>big</b> stupas and mani walls at the entry to the monastery. A small room above the temple is exclusively used as a school room to teach local boys of the villages and some of these boys are chosen as Lamas. The top floor is also the official residence of the incarnate lama of the monastery. A large pillar engraved with the Buddha's teachings is also located here. The monastery complex has a number of white washed huts, which house the Lamas.|$|E
25|$|Hybrids of dingoes {{and other}} {{domestic}} dogs {{are considered to}} exist in all populations worldwide today. Their proportion is regarded as increasing and completely “pure” populations may no longer exist. However, the exact extent of this interbreeding is unknown. This process might have reached such a high extent that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>big</b> populations that consist entirely of hybrids. Traditional methods for the identification for dingoes, dingo-hybrids and other domestic dogs (based on skull features, breeding patterns and fur colour) also indicate that interbreeding is widespread and occurs in all populations of Australia, especially in the East and the South of the continent. Based on skull features {{there are only a}} few “pure” dingoes left in New South Wales and the “pure” form might be locally extinct in the highlands of the Southeast. Even in areas that were once regarded as safe for “pure” dingoes, like the Kakadu national park or parts of the Northern Territory, dingo-hybrids now exist respectively appear on the border zones of bush and settlements. In addition, hybrids have been spotted in northern Australia and in remote regions.|$|E

500|$|The {{morning of}} the operation, General Sir Charles Guthrie, Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS)—the {{professional}} head of the British Armed Forces—was coincidentally due to appear on Breakfast with Frost, a Sunday morning political television programme hosted by Sir David Frost. The first public knowledge of Operation Barras came from Guthrie's interview with Frost, which took place while the operation was still concluding. Guthrie told Frost [...] "e didn't {{want to have to}} assault, because it's a very difficult operation, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>big</b> risks in it but we have done it [...] because our negotiations were getting nowhere. The hostages had been there [...] for three weeks, they [...] were threatening to kill them, or they were threatening to move them to other parts of Sierra Leone and once they'd done that we'd never be able to recover [...] with ease, which I hope we've done this morning". The MoD issued a press release with more details later in the day.|$|E
500|$|The Beast of Exmoor is a cryptozoological cat (see phantom cat) that is {{reported}} to roam Exmoor. There have been numerous reports of eyewitness sightings. The BBC calls it [...] "the famous-yet-elusive beast of Exmoor". Sightings were first reported in the 1970s although it became notorious in 1983, when a South Molton farmer claimed to have lost over 100 sheep {{in the space of}} three months, all of them apparently killed by violent throat injuries. Descriptions of its colouration range from black to tan or dark grey. It is possibly a cougar or black leopard which was released after a law was passed in 1976 making it illegal for them to be kept in captivity outside zoos. In 2006, the British Big Cats Society reported that a skull found by a Devon farmer was that of a puma; however, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) states, [...] "Based on the evidence, Defra does not believe that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>big</b> cats living in the wild in England." ...|$|E

2500|$|However, Sadoveanu's {{stories of}} the period often {{returned}} to a naturalistic perspective, particularly {{in a series of}} sketch stories and novellas which portray the modest lives of Romanian Railways employees, of young men drafted into the Romanian Land Forces, of Bovaryist women who playfully seduce adolescents, or of the provincial petite bourgeoisie. At times, they confront the morals of barely literate people with the stern authorities: a peasant obstinately believes that the 1859 union between Wallachia and Moldavia was meant to ensure the supremacy of his class; a young lower-class woman becomes the love interest of a boyar but chooses a life of freedom; and a Rom deserts from the Army after being told to bathe. In La noi, la Viișoara ("At Our Place in Viișoara"), the life of an old man degenerates into bigotry and avarice, {{to the point where he}} makes his wife starve to death. Sadoveanu's positive portrayal of hajduks as fundamentally honest outlaws standing up to feudal injustice, replicates stereotypes found in Romanian folklore, and is mostly present in some of the stories through (sometimes recurrent) heroic characters: Vasile the Great, Cozma Răcoare, Liță Florea etc. In the piece titled Bordeenii (roughly, [...] "The Mud-hut Dwellers"), he shows eccentrics and misanthropes presided upon by the dark figure of Sandu Faliboga, brigands who flee all public authority and whom commentators have likened to settlers of the Americas. Lepădatu, an unwanted child, speaks for the entire group: [...] "What could I do [...] wherever <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>big</b> fairs and lots of people? I'd have a better time with the cattle; it is with them that I have grown up and with them that I get along." [...] Romanticizing the obscure events of early medieval history in Vremuri de bejenie ("Roving Times", 1907), Sadoveanu sketches the improvised self-defense of a refugee community, their last stand against nomadic Tatars.|$|E
