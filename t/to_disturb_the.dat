5|$|Silicon carbide fibers {{are used}} to measure gas {{temperatures}} in an optical technique called thin filament pyrometry. It involves the placement of a thin filament in a hot gas stream. Radiative emissions from the filament can be correlated with filament temperature. Filaments are SiC fibers with a diameter of 15 micrometers, about one fifth that of a human hair. Because the fibers are so thin, they do little <b>to</b> <b>disturb</b> <b>the</b> flame and their temperature remains close {{to that of the}} local gas. Temperatures of about 800–2500 K can be measured.|$|E
5|$|Depicting the {{eyepiece}} of the microscope is Gamma Microscopii, which—at magnitude of4.68—is {{the brightest star}} in the constellation. Having spent much of its 620-million-year lifespan as a blue-white main sequence star, it has swollen and cooled to become a yellow giant of spectral type G6III, with a diameter ten times that of the Sun. Measurement of its parallax yields a distance of 229±4 light years from Earth. At around 2.5 times the mass of the Sun, it likely passed within 1.14 and 3.45 light-years of the Sun some 3.9 million years ago, possibly massive enough and close enough <b>to</b> <b>disturb</b> <b>the</b> Oort cloud. Alpha Microscopii is also an ageing yellow giant star of spectral type G7III with an apparent magnitude of 4.90. Located 380±30 light-years away from Earth, it has swollen to 17.5times the diameter of the Sun. Alpha has a 10th magnitude companion, visible in 7.5cm telescopes, though this is a coincidental closeness rather than a true binary system. Epsilon Microscopii lies 182±2 light years away, and is a white star of apparent magnitude 4.7, and spectral type A1V. Theta1 and Theta2 Microscopii make up a wide double whose components are splittable to the naked eye. Both are white A-class magnetic spectrum variable stars with strong metallic lines, similar to Cor Caroli. They mark the constellation's specimen slide.|$|E

25|$|The tracker {{needs to}} record {{particle}} paths accurately yet be lightweight so as <b>to</b> <b>disturb</b> <b>the</b> particle {{as little as}} possible. It does this by taking position measurements so accurate that tracks can be reliably reconstructed using just a few measurement points.

It is also the inner most layer of the detector and so receives the highest volume of particles: the construction materials were therefore carefully chosen to resist radiation.|$|E

These 5 extra days were named the Gatha days and had a practical as well as religious use. However, they were still kept apart from the 'religious year', so as not <b>to</b> <b>disturb</b> <b>the</b> long-held observances of the older Zoroastrian calendar.|$|E

25|$|The {{equivalence}} principle, in its simplest form, {{asserts that}} the trajectories of falling bodies in a gravitational field should be independent of their mass and internal structure, provided they are small enough not <b>to</b> <b>disturb</b> <b>the</b> environment or be affected by tidal forces. This idea has been tested to extremely high precision by Eötvös torsion balance experiments, which look for a differential acceleration between two test masses. Constraints on this, and {{on the existence of}} a composition-dependent fifth force or gravitational Yukawa interaction are very strong, and are discussed under fifth force and weak equivalence principle.|$|E

This led him {{to work on his}} most famous novel, Fight Club, which he wrote as an attempt <b>to</b> <b>disturb</b> <b>the</b> publisher even more for rejecting him. Palahniuk wrote this story in his spare time while working for Freightliner. After initially publishing it as a short story (which became chapter 6 of the novel) in the 1995 compilation, Pursuit of Happiness, Palahniuk expanded it into a full novel, which—contrary to his expectations—the publisher was willing to publish. While the original hardcover edition of the book received positive reviews and some awards, it had a short shelf life.|$|E

25|$|The arm ball {{has also}} been {{employed}} {{with a great deal}} of success over the years by left arm orthodox bowlers. In this case, the stock ball will turn away from the right handed batsman and the arm-ball would swing in, allowing the bowler to beat the inside edge of the bat and attack the stumps. Hedley Verity in particular was well known for his fast inswinging arm-ball, often bowled at yorker length. Ravindra Jadeja provided an amazing display of arm balls against England and Australia during India's 2016-17 home season. His arm balls were hugely effective on some of the flat pitches where there were little turn, and while playing for that little turn, batsmen got deceived and edged it, In spinning pitches he utilised the rough for his spinning deliveries, occasionally getting an arm ball in <b>to</b> <b>disturb</b> <b>the</b> batsman.|$|E
25|$|Within {{two decades}} the new church was already {{reaching}} its capacity, with {{over a thousand}} congregants. In 1848, a group of parishioners broke away when the Classis of Ulster denied permission for a new building and formed the Second Reformed Dutch Church of Kingston two blocks away on Fair Street, ending the Old Church's hegemony over Kingston. This did not adequately relieve the overcrowding. In 1850 the church resolved to replace the old building, which was still suffering {{the effects of the}} lightning strike. The next year the church bought another nearby parcel to enlarge its cemetery, in preparation {{for the construction of a}} new building. How they chose Lafever is not known, but in 1852 they began construction of his church, grounding the building in trenches instead of excavating a full cellar, so as not <b>to</b> <b>disturb</b> <b>the</b> graves in the area. The cornerstone was laid in May.|$|E
25|$|The Ellengowan {{shipwreck}} {{was discovered}} in 1991 by local scuba divers following the assistance of historical research conducted by Margaret Clinch. The shipwreck's discovery and identity was later verified by archaeologists from the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory in 1994, making it the oldest known shipwreck in Darwin Harbour and the only known Norwegian built iron steamer in Australian waters. The shipwreck lies {{at a depth of}} approximately 14 metres, in the channel between Wickham Point and Channel Island, in Darwin Harbour's middle arm. The wreck is the largest feature to appear on a depth sounder in the area, standing about 3 metres off the harbour floor. Her exact location is given at: 12°32'28"S, 130°52'08"E. The Ellengowan is a protected shipwreck under the Northern Territory Conservation Act 1991.
