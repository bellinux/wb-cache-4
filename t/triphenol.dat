The proposed structures were confirmed by IR, mass spectra, NMR spectra, and epoxy-equivalent-weight titration. The synthesized dopotep or dopotcy was copolymerized with diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (DGEBA), 6 ', 6 -bis(3 -phenyl- 3, 4 -dihydro- 2 H- 1, 3 -benzoxazineyl) methane (F-a), or dicyanate ester of bisphenol A (BADCY). Thus, copolymers based on DGEBA/dopotep/diphenylmethane (ddm), F-a/dopotep, BADCY/dopotcy, and DGEBA/dopotcy were developed. The thermal properties, dielectric properties, and flame retardancy of these copolymers were investigated. The curing kinetics of dopotep/ddm and dopotep/diamino diphenylsulfone were studied with differential scanning calorimetry. The microstructure of DGEBA/dopotcy was studied with IR.

40|$|Endangered (lUCN 1994) taxon {{with a total}} {{population}} in Victoria of approximately 130 plants. P. correctum regenerates from seed, and occasionally by tuber division, but little recruitment has been observed in the wild. Seed viability, isolation of fungal symbiont, and germinability of seed at 5 days, 90 days, 150 days, 270 days and 365 days after collection, using symbiotic and asymbiotic methods, were investigated. Future efforts to increase population size in Victoria may rely on ex-situ cultivation and translocation, so that methods to evaluate the propagation potential of the taxon are required. Results from viability tests using flurorescein diacetate (FDA) were lower overall than germinability. <b>Triphenol</b> tetrazolium chloride (TTC) tests were difficult to prepare and interpret, and the method was abandoned. Mycorrhizal fungus (Basidiomycetes) was isolated from P. correctum roots and effectively promoted germination of fresh (5 days old) seed (38 %). However, it was not effective using 90, 150 or 270 day old seed. Germination trials using 365 day old seed were destroyed by mites. Sporulation could not be induced in culture and the fungus remained unidentified...|$|E
40|$|The Folin-Ciocalteu (FC) {{test and}} cyclic voltammetry (CV) at a glassy carbon {{electrode}} {{were used to}} quantify phenolic antioxidants {{in a set of}} 17 Croatian wines and express them in gallic acid (GAE) and catechin equivalents (CE). The total phenolic index (TPI) values for red wines expressed in GAE ranged from 18. 851 to 26. 905 mM, while TPI for white wines ranged from 1. 722 to 2. 869 mM. The levels of phenolics derived from CV measurements were markedly lower than those of TPI, since these values include only those phenolic compounds that get oxidised up to 500 mV and contain ortho -diphenol and <b>triphenol</b> groups. The free radical scavenging ability of the same set of wines was evaluated according to the Brand-Williams assay and expressed in equivalents of catechin, gallic acid, vitamin C and Trolox. Ivan Dolac barrique 2002 exhibited the highest antioxidant activity. The DPPH radical scavenging ability of the wines was also evaluated and correlated to the TPI values. Better correlation was observed between the TPI and the antioxidant activity for red wines (r 2 = 0. 826) as opposed to white wines (r 2 = 0. 686). The highest correlation (r 2 = 0. 970) was found between the TPI and the antioxidant activity measured when the whole set of samples was considered. ...|$|E
40|$|Two {{melanotic}} human melanoma {{cell lines}}, IRE 1 and IRE 2, and the lymphoma- and leukaemia-derived cell lines Raji and K 562, {{were exposed to}} different concentrations (from 5 X 10 (- 3) M to 10 (- 5) M) of phenols, both substrates (s) and non-substrates (ns) of tyrosinase, in {{the presence or absence}} of the oxygen-radical-scavenger enzymes superoxide dismutase, catalase and peroxidase. Monophenols were tyrosine (s), 4 -hydroxyanisole (s) and butylated hydroxyanisole (ns); diphenols were L- 3, 4 -dihydroxyphenylalanine (s), dopamine (3, 4 -dihydroxyphenethylamine) (s), terbutylcatechol (s), hydroquinone (s) and resorcinol (ns); <b>triphenols</b> were 6 -hydroxydopa (3, 4, 6 -trihydroxyphenylalanine) (s) and methyl gallate (s). <b>Triphenols</b> and o- and p-diphenols underwent complete oxidation in culture medium within 24 h of incubation and were significantly more toxic than monophenols and the m-diphenol resorcinol, which, under the same cultural conditions, were much more stable. No significant differences in percentage survival were found among the different cell lines for each drug tested. The major component of toxicity up to 24 h of di- and tri-phenols is due to toxic oxygen species acting outside the cells and not to cellular uptake of these phenols as such. In fact the addition of oxygen-radical-scavenger enzymes significantly (P less than 0. 01) decreased the adverse effect of these drugs on all cell lines. The lower toxicity of monophenols and resorcinol as compared with that of di- and tri-phenols is due, in our opinion, to the fact that they are less oxidized under the conditions existing in the culture medium, and therefore do not produce sufficient levels of oxygen radicals. For these compounds, a primary intracellular action has to be taken into account to explain their cytotoxicity...|$|R
30|$|The rates (k) of hydroxymethylation of phenol, resorcinol, phloroglucinol, {{and several}} methylphenols in diluted 10 % {{dimethylformamide}} aqueous alkaline solution were calculated {{based on the}} consumption of phenols and formaldehyde. Thek values of phloroglucinol and resorcinol relative to that of phenol were about 62000 and 1200 times, respectively. The phenols that have methyl or hydroxyl groups at the C- 3 or C- 5 position (or both) have larger rate constants than phenols with substituents at other positions. Several kinds of atomic charge of the carbons on the aromatic ring of phenols were calculated using the semiempirical orab initio method. The correlations between the averagek (Ave.k) and average electrostatic charges (Ave.q) at the carbons were fairly good. Highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO) were observed. The best correlation between Ave.k and Ave.q was obtained when diphenols and <b>triphenols</b> were assumed to exist in solution as their respective di-anion.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the preparation of}} a biomimetic Langmuir-Blodgett film of tyrosinase incorporated in a lipidic layer {{and the use of}} lutetium bisphthalocyanine as an electron mediator for the voltammetric detection of phenol derivatives, which include one monophenol (vanillic acid), two diphenols (catechol and caffeic acid) and two <b>triphenols</b> (gallic acid and pyrogallol). The first redox process of the voltammetric responses is associated with the reduction of the enzymatically formed o-quinone and is favoured by the lutetium bisphthalocyanine because significant signal amplification is observed, while the second is associated with the electrochemical oxidation of the antioxidant and occurs at lower potentials in the presence of an electron mediator. The biosensor shows low detection limit (1. 98 × 10 - 6 - 27. 49 × 10 - 6 M), good reproducibility, and high affinity to antioxidants (KM in the range of 62. 31 - 144. 87 μM). The excellent functionality of the enzyme obtained using a biomimetic immobilisation method, the selectivity afforded by enzyme catalysis, the signal enhancement caused by the lutetium bisphthalocyanine mediator and the increased selectivity of the curves due to the occurrence of two redox processes make these sensors exceptionally suitable for the detection of phenolic compounds.

40|$|We propose three {{approaches}} to obtain flame-retardant benzoxazines. In the first approach, we synthesize a novel benzoxazine (dopot-m) from a phosphorus-containing <b>triphenol</b> (dopotriol), formaldehyde, and methyl amine. Dopot-m is copolymerized with a commercial benzoxazine [6 ', 6 -bis(3 -phenyl- 3, 4 -dihydro- 2 H- 1, 3 -benzoxazineyl) methane (F-a) ] or diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (DGEBA). The thermal properties and flame retardancy of the F-a/dopot-m copolymers increase with {{the content of}} dopot-m. As for the dopot-m/DGEBA curing system, the glass-transition temperature of the dopot-m/DGEBA copolymer is 252 degrees C, which is {{higher than that of}} poly (dopot-m). The 5 % decomposition temperature of the dopot-m/DGEBA copolymer increases from 323 to 351 degrees C because of the higher crosslinking density caused by the reaction of phenolic OH and epoxy. In the second approach, we incorporate the element phosphorus into benzoxazine via the curing reaction of dopotriol. and F-a. After the curing, the thermal properties of the F-a/dopotriol copolymers are almost the same as those of neat poly(F-a), and this implies that we can incorporate the flame-retardant element phosphorus into the polybenzoxazine without sacrificing any thermal properties. In the third approach, we react dopo with electron-deficient benzoxazine to incorporate the element phosphorus. After the curing, the glass-transition temperatures of polybenzoxazines decrease slightly with the content of dopo, mainly because of the smaller crosslinking density of the resultant polybenzoxazines.

40|$|Stem slices (1 -mm thick) {{cut from}} apple microshoots were cultured on a {{modified}} Murashige-Skoog medium with indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA) or α-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA), and increasing concentrations of various phenolic compounds. Both auxins were added at a concentration suboptimal for rooting. Indole- 3 -acetic acid is metabolized through oxidation and conjugation but NAA through conjugation only; {{which might have}} affected the results. With IAA, all tested orthodiphenols, paradiphenols and triphenols promoted adventitious root formation from the stem slices. Ferulic acid (FA, a methylated orthodiphenol) had the largest effect and {{increased the number of}} adventitious roots from 0. 9 to 5. 8. With NAA there was little or no promotion after addition of phenolics. Phloroglucinol (a <b>triphenol)</b> and FA were examined in detail. Their effects on the dose–response curve of IAA and the timing of their action indicated that both acted as antioxidants protecting IAA from decarboxylation and the tissue from oxidative stress. Experiments with carboxyl-labelled IAA showed that IAA was massively decarboxylated by the slices and that decarboxylation was strongly reduced by phenolics. Decarboxylation was to a great extent attributable to the wound response and did not occur to such an extent in non-wounded plant tissues. In shoots, FA promoted little rooting. Slices were cultured on top of the medium and shoots were stuck into the medium. Possibly, the anaerobic conditions in the medium near the basal part of the stem of shoots reduced the wound response and consequently decarboxylation of IAA. The monophenolic compound salicylic acid (SA) promoted IAA decarboxylation. Accordingly, SA reduced rooting when added during the initial days of the rooting process (the period during which auxin enhances rooting), and promoted outgrowth of root primordia later on (the period during which auxin inhibits rooting) ...|$|E

40|$|Tyrosinases and laccases are copper-containing oxidoreductases, which {{catalyze}} oxidation {{of various}} mono- and polyphenolic compounds. Tyrosinases oxidize p-monophenols and o-diphenols to quinones, whereas laccases {{are capable of}} oxidizing a larger variety of aromatic compounds, such as substituted mono- and polyphenols, aromatic amines and thiol compounds, with subsequent production of radicals. Both tyrosinase and laccase generate reaction products which are prone to react further non-enzymatically, which may lead to polymerization. In addition to the low molecular mass phenolic compounds, the phenolic moieties present in certain biopolymers are susceptible to oxidation by tyrosinase and laccase, which enables crosslinking of the biopolymers. The biochemical properties of a novel fungal tyrosinase from Trichoderma reesei (TrT) were characterized in this work. The substrate specificity and protein crosslinking ability of TrT were compared to other tyrosinases of plant and fungal origin. Furthermore, the suitability of TrT and laccase from Trametes hirsuta (ThL) was examined for hetero-crosslinking of carbohydrates and proteins and for improving wheat breadmaking quality. TrT was over-expressed in its original host under a strong cbh 1 promoter and purified with a three step purification procedure, consisting of desalting by gel filtration, and cation exchange and gel filtration chromatography. The purified TrT showed a molecular weight of 43. 2  kDa as analyzed by mass spectrometry. TrT {{was found to be}} processed from the C-terminus by cleavage of a peptide fragment of about 20  kDa. TrT was active both on L-tyrosine and L-dopa, thus showing typical characteristics of a true tyrosinase. TrT had broad substrate specificity, and the enzyme showed the highest activity and stability in the neutral and alkaline pH range, with an optimum at pH  9. TrT retained its activity relatively well at temperatures of 40  °C and below. When tyrosinases from apple (AT), potato (PT), the white rot fungus Pycnoporus sanguineus (PsT) and the edible mushroom Agaricus bisporus (AbT) were compared to TrT, {{it was found that the}} tyrosinases had clearly different features in terms of substrate specificity, inhibition and their ability to crosslink the model protein α-casein. Generally the tyrosinases had lower activity on monophenols than on di- or <b>triphenols.</b> PsT had the highest monophenolase/diphenolase ratio for the oxidation of monophenolic L-tyrosine and diphenolic L-dopa. However, TrT had the highest activity on most of the tested monophenols, and showed clearly shorter lag periods prior to the oxidation of the monophenols than the other enzymes. The activity of AT and PT on tyrosine was undetectable which explains the poor crosslinking ability of α-casein by these enzymes. AbT was also unable to crosslink α-casein, although it could oxidize tyrosine of di- and tri-peptides. Conversely, the activity of PsT on the model peptides turned out to be relatively low, although the enzyme could crosslink α-casein. Of the analyzed tyrosinases, TrT clearly had the best ability to directly crosslink α-casein. However, by after addition of a small molecular weight phenolic compound, L-dopa, to the reaction mixture, the other tyrosinases were also able to crosslink α-casein. It is assumed that L-dopa acted as a bridging compound between the α-casein subunits. The capability of the two different fungal oxidative enzymes, the TrT tyrosinase and the ThL laccase, to catalyze formation of hetero-conjugates between tyrosine side-chains of α-casein and phenolic acids of hydrolyzed oat spelt xylan (hOSX) was studied. TrT was able to crosslink α-casein more efficiently than ThL, whereas only ThL was able to polymerize hOSX. The radical- and quinone-mediated protein crosslinking clearly differed, which was indicated by enhancement of crosslinking by the presence of phenolic acids with ThL, and by inhibition with TrT. Despite the notable differences between the oxidative enzymes in their ability to crosslink the biopolymers, both ThL and TrT were observed to be able to catalyze oxidative hetero-crosslinking of α-casein and xylan. The effects of TrT and ThL were also compared in wheat flour breadmaking. The enzymes were found to act in wheat dough and bread via different crosslinking mechanisms. Both ThL and TrT improved the bread quality, especially when used in combination with xylanase, as indicated by an increase in bread volume and bread crumb softness during storage. The effect of ThL is assumed to be based mainly on the crosslinking of ferulic acid -substituted arabinoxylan with subsequent arabinoxylan network formation, and thus indirectly also strengthening the gluten network of dough. ThL may also have directly oxidized the tyrosyl residues of gluten proteins or enhanced the disulphide bridge formation in gluten polymers via ferulic acid-derived radicals, thus assisting protein aggregation in dough. The effects of TrT in dough and bread are suggested to be due mainly to polymerization of gluten proteins via production of reactive quinones by oxidation of the protein-bound tyrosine residues with consequent formation of crosslinks in the gluten proteins. Tyrosinase may also have influenced the texture properties of dough and bread by oxidizing other phenolic compounds as well as tyrosine of wheat flour, such as p-coumaric and caffeic acids. The oxidative enzymes, tyrosinase and laccase, were shown to have potential in crosslinking of food biopolymers. The T. reesei tyrosinase was found to be an efficient protein crosslinker, especially when compared to the T. hirsuta laccase or to the tyrosinases of plant and fungal origin. On the other hand, ThL was observed to be more efficient in catalyzing the formation of hetero-crosslinks between proteins and carbohydrates, as compared to TrT. It was shown in this work that both types of oxidative enzymes, tyrosinase and laccase, can be applied to generate food biopolymers with added functionalities or novel food structures from diverse raw materials. Tyrosinaasit ja lakkaasit ovat entsyymejä, jotka katalysoivat mono- ja polyfenolisten yhdisteiden hapettumisreaktioita. Reaktio¬tuotteiden jatkoreaktiot voivat johtaa substraattien polymeroitumiseen. Tyrosinaasit ja lakkaasit pystyvät hapettamaan myös biopolymeerirakenteissa esiintyviä fenolisia yhdisteitä, minkä johdosta kyseisten biopolymeerien entsyymiavusteinen ristisilloittaminen on mahdollista. Tässä työssä karakterisoitiin uutta Trichoderma reesei -homeesta peräisin olevaa tyrosinaasia. T. reesei -tyrosinaasin substraattispesifisyyttä sekä kykyä ristisilloittaa maitoproteiini α-kaseiinia verrattiin home- ja kasviperäisiin tyrosinaaseihin. T. reesei -tyrosinaasin kykyä muodostaa heterokonjugaatteja proteiinien ja hiilihydraattien välille sekä entsyymin vaikutuksia vehnäleivonnassa verrattiin Trametes hirsuta -lakkaasiin. T. reesei -tyrosinaasi tuotettiin ylituottomenetelmällä alkuperäisessä tuottoisännässään. Entsyymi puhdistettiin kolmivaiheisella kromatografisella prosessilla. T. reesei -tyrosinaasin molekyylipainoksi määritettiin 43, 2  kDa, ja polypeptidin C-terminaalisesta päästä todetiiin katkenneen noin 20  kDa -kokoinen peptidi. T. reesei -tyrosinaasi oli aktiivinen neutraalilla ja emäksisellä pH-alueella. Verrattaessa T. reesei -tyrosinaasia omenasta, perunasta, Pycnoporus sanguineus sekä Agaricus bisporus -homeista peräisin oleviin tyrosinaaseihin havaittiin entsyymeiden substraattispesifisyyden ja kyvyn ristisilloittaa maitoproteiinia eroavan toisistaan huomattavasti. T. reesei -tyrosinaasi hapetti monofenolisia yhdisteitä ja ristisilloitti kaseiinia selvästi tehokkaimmin. Myös P. sanguineus -tyrosinaasi kykeni polymeroimaan kaseiinia. Kun reaktioseokseen lisättiin pienimolekyylipainoista di-fenolia, kaikki tyrosinaasit kykenivät ristisilloittamaan kaseiinia. T. reesei -tyrosinaasia ja T. hirsuta -lakkaasia verrattiin suhteessa niiden kykyyn katalysoida polymerointireaktioita α-kaseiinin ja ksylaanin fenolisten sivuryhmien kautta. Tyrosinaasi kykeni polymeroimaan α-kaseiinia lakkaasia paremmin. Toisaalta lakkaasi kykeni polymeroimaan ksylaania, mutta tyrosinaasi ei. Huolimatta havaituista eroista sekä lakkaasin että tyrosinaasin osoitettiin muodostavan heteroristisidoksia maitoproteiinin ja ksylaanin välillä. Vehnäleivonnassa molemmat entsyymit lisäsivät leivän ominaistilavuutta sekä pehmeyttä. Lakkaasin vaikutus johtui ilmeisesti pääosin vehnän arabinoksylaanin ristisiloittumisesta ja tyrosinaasin gluteeniproteiinien ristisilloitumisesta. Saavutettujen tulosten perusteella voidaan todeta, että T. reesei -tyrosinaasi ja T. hirsuta -lakkaasi soveltuvat elintarvikkeiden rakenne- ja funktionaalisten ominaisuuksien muokkaamiseen. reviewe...|$|R
