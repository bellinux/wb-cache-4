25|$|In English, V {{is unusual}} in {{that it has not}} {{traditionally}} been doubled to indicate a short vowel, the way for example P is doubled to indicate the difference between 'super' and 'supper'. However, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>changing</b> with newly coined words, such as 'divvy up' and 'skivvies'. Like J, K, Q, X, and Z, V is not used very frequently in English.

V is the only letter that cannot be used to form an English two-letter word in the Australian version of the game of Scrabble. C also cannot be used in the American version.|$|E
25|$|The {{meanings}} of part-of-speech affixes {{depend on the}} inherent part of speech of the root they are applied to. For example, brosi (to brush) {{is based on a}} nominal root (and therefore listed in modern dictionaries under the entry broso), whereas kombi (to comb) is based on a verbal root (and therefore listed under kombi). Change the suffix to -o, and the similar {{meanings of}} brosi and kombi diverge: broso is a brush, the name of an instrument, whereas kombo is a combing, the name of an action. <b>That</b> <b>is,</b> <b>changing</b> verbal kombi (to comb) to a noun simply creates the name for the action; for the name of the tool, the suffix -ilo is used, which derives words for instruments from verbal roots: kombilo (a comb). On the other hand, changing the nominal root broso (a brush) to a verb gives the action associated with that noun, brosi (to brush). For the name of the action, the suffix -ado will change a derived verb back to a noun: brosado (a brushing). Similarly, an abstraction of a nominal root (changing it to an adjective and then back to a noun) requires the suffix -eco, as in infaneco (childhood), but an abstraction of an adjectival or verbal root merely requires the nominal -o: belo (beauty). Nevertheless, redundantly affixed forms such as beleco are acceptable and widely used.|$|E
