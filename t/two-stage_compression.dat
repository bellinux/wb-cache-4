40|$|A cooler {{consisting}} of a sorption compressor with a Joule-Thomson (JT) cold stage has several advantages. These coolers have no moving parts which is attractive {{for a variety of}} reasons. Unfortunately, the efficiency of sorption-based JT coolers is in many cases relatively small. This paper presents a thermodn. description of the compressor and the cold stage sep. Their efficiencies are optimized individually. Besides, an optimization of the total cooler is performed. Furthermore, the thermodn. impact of design changes to improve these efficiencies is discussed. The efficiency of the sorption compressor can be increased significantly by incorporating <b>two-stage</b> <b>compression.</b> The efficiency of the cold stage can largely be increased by precooling. Generally, a TE cooler is used for this purpose. <b>Two-stage</b> <b>compression</b> opens the opportunity to integrate a JT precooler into the cold stage that is driven by the pressure difference created by the second compression stage. Also an addnl. sorption cooler can be used for this purpose. A case study is performed for nitrogen as the working gas and both Saran and Maxsorb as the adsorbent. Four cooler configurations are thermodynamically compared. In this study, the cooler efficiency increases by a factor of 3 by the application of <b>two-stage</b> <b>compression</b> compared to single-stage compression. Another factor of 3 is obtained by using an internal JT precooler. Incorporating an external sorption cooler as a precooler gives a further improvement with nearly a factor of 2, resulting in a 17 times larger efficiency compared to single-stage compression. Depending on the configuration, a Saran-based cooler has a 1. 5 - 2 times better efficiency than a cooler operating with Maxsorb. [on SciFinder (R) ...|$|E

Design/methodology/approach: The study was performed {{with the use of}} Gleeble 3800 simulator. Stressstrain curves were determined during continuous compression test in a temperature range from 900 to 1100 °C and at a strain rate of 1, 10 and 50 s- 1. In order to determine recrystallization kinetics of plastically deformed austenite, discontinuous compression tests of specimens were done with a given strain at the rate of 10 s- 1, in a temperature range from 900 to 1100 °C, with isothermal holding of samples between successive stages of deformation for 2 to 100 s. Recrystallization kinetics of plastically deformed austenite was described using the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami equation. The observations of microstructures of thin foils were done using JEOL JEM 3010 transmission electron microscope. Findings: Basing on the analysis of the form and the course of curves obtained in the compression test, it was found that in the studied range of parameters of hot plastic deformation, the decrease of strain hardening of studied steels is caused by the process of continuous dynamic recrystallization. This is also confirmed by calculation results of activation energy of plastic deformation process. Performed <b>two-stages</b> <b>compression</b> tests revealed that microadditions introduced into steel considerably influence the kinetics of static recrystallization.
