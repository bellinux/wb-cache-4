Featured in the brand’s goggles and sunglasses, these lenses {{use a variety}} of <b>tinted</b> <b>dyes</b> that are tailored to the prevailing light conditions and activities for which the goggles or sunglasses are designed.|$|R
5000|$|The word {{appears in}} the Rigveda, where it means [...] "colour, outward appearance, exterior, form, figure or shape". The word means [...] "color, <b>tint,</b> <b>dye</b> or pigment" [...] in the Mahabharata. Varna contextually means [...] "colour, race, tribe, species, kind, sort, nature, character, quality, property" [...] of an object or people in some Vedic and medieval texts. Varna refers to four social classes in the Manusmriti.|$|R

25|$|Dyeing: the skeins are scoured again, and {{discoloration}} removed with a sulphur process. This {{weakens the}} silk. The skeins are now <b>tinted</b> or <b>dyed.</b> They are dried and rewound onto bobbins, spools and skeins. Looming, and the weaving process on power looms {{is the same}} as with cotton.|$|R

50|$|During the interwar period, the {{building}} belonged to Jan Ostrowski, a co-owner of Behring shoe factory. Since the 1920s, the pharmacy Central {{is standing on}} the ground floor. Jakub Hechliński, a local furniture designer, worked entirely on its original decor. During this time, {{the building}} housed the medical facility of Dr. Szymanski, including baths, massage facilities and gymnasium. Later on, in the 1930s, the company Sanitas used the premises to offer ordinary baths, therapeutics and hydrotherapy. The building also housed <b>Tint,</b> a <b>dye</b> workshop run by the family Kłamajski.|$|R
6000|$|You {{who take}} the moon as in a sieve, and sift Her flake by flake and spread her meaning out; You who roll the stars like jewels in your palm, So {{that they seem to}} utter {{themselves}} aloud; You who steep from out the days their colour, Reveal the universal <b>tint</b> that <b>dyes</b> Their web; who shadow the sun's great gestures [...] and expressions So that he seems a stranger in his passing; Who voice the dumb night fittingly; Sea, you shadow of all things, now mock us to [...] death with your shadowing.|$|R
50|$|The {{compulsory}} uniform {{consists of}} white blouse or shirt (which {{does not need}} to be tucked in) and beige bottoms. A maroon coloured school tie must be worn for morning assembly on Mondays for the school. Boys in secondary 1 and secondary 2 must wear short trousers, graduating to long pants in secondary 3 (typically the year in which students turn 15). Female students' skirts must be at knee level. Students are not allowed to <b>tint</b> or <b>dye</b> their hair. Boys must have short hair. Girls wear pleated beige skirt. All students must wear white socks, which must be clearly visible. Student councillors or simply referred as Councillors or SCs must wear a dark blue tie every day.|$|R
30|$|Two {{adsorbents}} potato {{peel and}} neem bark are selected as suitable adsorbents. Potato peel is obtained from mess of BMIET, while neem bark is collected from surrounding {{area of the}} same institute. Both the adsorbents are first washed with water and air dried in oven at 65  °C for 24  h. After drying, they are grinded and further treated with formaldehyde to restrict the integration of adsorbent’s own colour with the <b>dye</b> <b>tint.</b>|$|R
50|$|Other {{crafts and}} {{works of art}} are less common, but still {{contribute}} to community's economy. The majority of textile workers are women. The use of thread, <b>tinted</b> with natural <b>dyes</b> is common in producing items such as bags, scarves, blankets, and wallets. The Brunca are the only indigenous group in Costa Rica that weave, although only in small amounts (Stone 1949: 17). Daggers or puñales are sold as decorative objects, but carry historical reference to past chiefs or caciques. Often adorned with nene beads, thread, and feathers of birds (namely toucans), these puñales were used to capture game.|$|R
60|$|In {{advancing}} {{along this}} path {{it was very}} curious to observe the totally {{different aspects of the}} water on the two sides of it. On the one side it was turbid and gray, and perfectly opaque. You could not have seen the pollywogs in the shallowest places along the margin. On the other side it was so clear and transparent that you could have seen fishes swimming where it was ten feet deep. It was of such a rich and beautiful blue color, too, {{as if it had been}} <b>tinted</b> with a <b>dye,</b> and the color was of so rich and brilliant a hue, that Mrs. Holiday was continually admiring and praising it.|$|R
50|$|BPI {{was founded}} in 1971 by Dr. Herbert Wertheim. At that time, the {{material}} used for eyeglass lenses was in transition from glass to plastic. Dr. Wertheim realized that an advantage to plastic lenses over glass is that plastic can be <b>tinted</b> with <b>dyes</b> like those used for textiles to make sunglasses {{in a wide range}} of colors, after the lenses have been cut, surfaced, and finished. That put the choice of color in the hands of the local optometrist, speaking directly to the customer. He then formulated dyes to meet the special requirements of tinting a single, smooth plastic surface, as opposed to the bundle of fibers that is the target of textile dyes.In the early 1980s, recognizing that ultraviolet light (UV) is a significant cause of various eye diseases, including macular degeneration and cataracts, BPI built on its experience with lens tinting to make UV-absorbing dyes that improve on the inherent UV-blocking ability of the plastic material and eliminate UV transmission right up to the edge of the visible spectrum. More recently, the company has stressed the blocking of high-energy visible light for the same conditions.|$|R
6000|$|We do well, in our {{examinations}} {{into this}} subject, to note carefully the various {{applications of the}} word baptize, and not always attach the use of water to the term. There is a being baptized in a cloud, and in the sea, to protect God's Israel from their deadly foes; a baptism in sufferings; a baptism in water unto repentance; a baptism in fire, or the Holy Ghost; a baptism into {{the doctrine of the}} Trinity (Matt 28:19). Bunyan had no doubt upon this subject; he deemed water baptism an important personal duty; and that a death to sin, and resurrection to newness of life--a different <b>tint,</b> or <b>dye,</b> given to the character--was best figured by immersion in water: still he left it to every individual to be satisfied in his own mind as to this outward sign of the invisible grace. 'Strange,' he says, 'take two Christians equal on all points but this; nay, let one go far beyond the other for grace and holiness; yet this circumstance of water shall drown and sweep away all his excellencies; not counting him worthy of that reception that with hand and heart shall be given to a novice in religion, because he consents to water.' ...|$|R
6000|$|But here a voice, I {{know not}} whence, Thrills clearly through my inward sense, Saying: 'See where she sits at home While thou {{in search of}} her dost roam! All summer long her ancient wheel [...] Whirls humming by the open door, Or, when the hickory's social zeal [...] Sets the wide chimney in a roar, [...] 100 Close-nestled by the tinkling hearth, It modulates the {{household}} mirth With that sweet serious undertone Of duty, music all her own; Still as of old she sits and spins Our hopes, our sorrows, and our sins; With equal care she twines the fates Of cottages and mighty states; She spins the earth, the air, the sea, The maiden's unschooled fancy free, [...] 110 The boy's first love, the man's first grief, The budding and the fall o' the leaf; The piping west-wind's snowy care For her their cloudy fleeces spare, Or from the thorns of evil times She can glean wool to twist her rhymes; Morning and noon and eve supply To her their fairest <b>tints</b> for <b>dye,</b> But ever through her twirling thread There spires one line of warmest red, [...] 120 Tinged from the homestead's genial heart, The stamp and warrant of her art; With this Time's sickle she outwears, And blunts the Sisters' baffled shears.|$|R
6000|$|... 2. In general, {{the three}} great, or fine, Arts of Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture, are {{thought of as}} {{distinct}} from the lower and more mechanical formative arts, such as carpentry or pottery. But we cannot, either verbally, or with any practical advantage, admit such classification. How are we to distinguish painting on canvas from painting on china?--or painting on china from painting on glass?--or painting on glass from infusion of color into any vitreous substance, such as enamel?--or the infusion of color into glass and enamel from the infusion of color into wool or silk, and weaving of pictures in tapestry, or patterns in dress? You will find that although, in ultimately accurate use of the word, painting must be held to mean only the laying of a pigment on a surface with a soft instrument; yet, in broad comparison of the functions of Art, we must conceive of {{one and the same}} great artistic faculty, as governing every mode of disposing colors in a permanent relation on, or in, a solid substance; whether it be by <b>tinting</b> canvas, or <b>dyeing</b> stuffs; inlaying metals with fused flint, or coating walls with colored stone.|$|R
30|$|Infrared & Raman Users Group (IRUG, [URL] {{database}} {{showed that}} {{the main component of}} the reddish pigments (Fig.  5 a) was basic white lead. It was a very useful white pigment as base and could be applied in painting with various organic <b>dye</b> <b>tints</b> [11]. Two mineral phases, cerussite (PbCO 3) and hydrocerussite (Pb 3 (CO 3) 2 (OH) 2), were the main composition of basic white lead [17]. In the fingerprint region at 1500 – 650  cm− 1, the peaks occurring at 1415, 1046, 681  cm− 1 corresponded to the strong stretching vibrations of CO 32 − for neutral lead carbonate (cerussite), calcium carbonate (aragonite) and basic lead carbonate (hydrocerussite), the weak absorbance band near 3537  cm− 1 was attributable to OH stretching for the latter [13, 18]. The strongest absorbance band near 1415  cm− 1 suggested the presence of more than one carbonate [9]. The three C–O bands at 1162, 1094 and 1046  cm− 1 occurred in a maple leaf pattern were characteristic of drying oils; moreover, because of containing ester group, the absorbance peak of C=O appeared at ca. 1736  cm− 1 [19]. While combining with other characteristic peaks of 2920, 2850  cm− 1 (CH 2), 1650  cm− 1 (Amide I band) and 1540  cm− 1 (Amide II band), the existence of organic binding medium was also proved which may be associated with protein, drying oils or the beeswax [20].|$|R
