40|$|This thesis commences {{with the}} {{proposition}} that the first limb of the doctrine of privity causes injustice to <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> in Malaysia, particularly in commercial contracts. The doctrine of privity {{has been the subject of}} criticism by the judiciary and academic commentators in common law jurisdictions, mainly directed at the first limb of the doctrine, whereby only parties to a contract can sue and be sued. The first limb prevents a <b>third</b> <b>party</b> from enforcing benefits conferred on them by those contracts thereby resulting in <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> suffering loss and injustice to those parties. In several common law countries, such as England, Australia, New Zealand and Singapore, legislative reform of the doctrine has occurred. The legislative reform has abrogated to a significant extent the doctrine of privity in commercial contracts. Malaysia is a common law country, where the doctrine of privity is still applied to contracts. An analysis of Malaysian case law demonstrates that the most affected <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> are those seeking to enforce insurance and construction contracts. While a small number of other <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> to commercial contracts, such as agreements to pay for work done, sale and purchase agreements and tenancy agreements are also affected, the detriment is not as significant. As a consequence, this thesis focuses primarily on the impact of the doctrine of privity on commercial contracts in the areas of insurance and construction in Malaysia The thesis aims to recommend appropriate reforms to address the injustices arising from the privity doctrine for <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> seeking to obtain the benefit of insurance and construction contracts, which may also benefit <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> to other types of commercial contracts. While the Malaysian insurance, consumer protection, negotiable instruments and agency laws allow <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> to enforce benefits in contracts, the rights are found to be inadequate. As not all <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> seeking to enforce an insurance or construction contract can rely upon the legislation, the injustice arising from the doctrine of privity remains and needs to be addressed. To achieve this aim, a comparative analysis of the rights of <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> under insurance and construction contracts in Malaysia, Australia and England is undertaken. The results of the analysis are used to identify appropriate elements for a legislative framework guided by the three essential criteria for effective law reform developed in the thesis. The three criteria are certainty, public interest and justice. The thesis recommends first the enactment of general legislation applicable to all commercial contracts including insurance contracts. Secondly, the thesis recommends specific targeted legislation to address the injustice faced by <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> in construction contracts...|$|R

5000|$|The {{traditional}} phrase signed, sealed {{and delivered}} {{refers to the}} practice of seals; however, attesting witnesses have replaced seals to some extent. Agreements under seal are also called contracts by deed or specialty; in the United States, a specialty is enforceable without consideration. In some jurisdictions, specialties have a liability limitation period of double that of a simple contract and allow for a <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>beneficiary</b> to enforce an undertaking in the deed, thereby overcoming the doctrine of privity.

5000|$|Another theory {{asserts that}} it is {{feasible}} to typify letter of credit as a collateral contract for a third-party beneficiary because three different entities participate in the transaction: the seller, the buyer, and the banker. Because letters of credit are prompted by the buyer’s necessity and in application {{of the theory of}} Jean Domat the cause of a LC is to release the buyer of his obligation to pay directly to the seller. Therefore, a LC theoretically fits as a collateral contract accepted by conduct or in other words, an implied-in-fact contract under the framework for <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>beneficiary</b> where the buyer participates as the <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>beneficiary</b> with the bank acting as the stipulator and the seller as the promisor. The term [...] "beneficiary" [...] is not used properly in the scheme of an LC because a beneficiary (also, in trust law, cestui que use) in the broadest sense is a natural person or other legal entity who receives money or other benefits from a benefactor. Note that under the scheme of letters of credit, banks are neither benefactors of sellers nor benefactors of buyers and the seller receives no money in gratuity mode. Thus is possible that a “letter of credit” was one of those contracts that needed to be masked to disguise the “consideration or privity requirement”. As a result, this kind of arrangement, would make letter of credit to be enforceable under the action assumpsit because of its promissory connotation.|$|E

50|$|Assignment {{of rights}} under a {{contract}} is the complete {{transfer of the}} rights to receive the benefits accruing {{to one of the}} parties to that contract. For example, if Party A contracts with Party B to sell Party A's car to Party B for $10, Party A can later assign the benefits of the contract - i.e., the right to be paid $10 - to Party C. In this scenario, Party A is the obligee/assignor, Party B is an obligor, and Party C is the assignee. Such an assignment may be donative (essentially given as a gift), or it may be contractually exchanged for consideration. It is important to note, however, that Party C is not a <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>beneficiary,</b> because the contract itself was not made for the purpose of benefitting Party C. When an assignment is made, the assignment always takes place after the original contract was formed. An Assignment only transfers the rights/benefits to a new owner. The obligations remain with the previous owner. Compare Novation.|$|E

40|$|DURING 1950 and 1951, the Ford Motor Company {{systematically}} {{laid off}} women employees in its Dearborn stamping plant while retaining men of lesser seniority.

40|$|The article {{addresses}} the vexing problem of holding corporations liable for assisting in the sovereign abuse of human rights. Currently domestic human rights litigation against corporations {{appears to be}} a proxy fight in which the accomplice is pursued while the principal evades punishment. Typically the principal malfeasor - the sovereign - is immune from suit because of foreign sovereign immunity. But corporations can be found liable for aiding and abetting those violations. This article suggests a solution to this problem, drawing on principles from contract law and arbitration. If a corporation is found liable for aiding and abetting sovereign abuse, it may invoke contractual provisions in the agreement with the sovereign to arbitrate the question of shared responsibility. While the victims may not pursue the sovereign because of immunity, there is no impediment for a corporate joint malfeasor to pursue the sovereign in arbitration to secure its share of liability, either in the form of contribution or indemnification. In short, human rights litigation against the corporation could lead to who pays cross-claim arbitration against the sovereign. Using Guido Calabresi 2 ̆ 7 s scheme of cost avoidance, this approach establishes a system of cost avoidance for human rights, in which corporations incur costs, and then seek to transfer those costs to the cheapest cost avoider - the sovereign. But the tools of contract law and arbitration are not simply for the corporation that aids and abets human rights abuse. They also are available to the majority of corporations that are good corporate citizens. For these corporations, contract law and arbitration procedures create opportunities to impose human rights obligations on transnational contractors, vendors, and suppliers. Human rights obligations can be internalized by contract and subjected to effective dispute resolution procedures, including international arbitration. Finally, some corporations may wish to go even further and create opportunities for non-contracting parties - such as employees or NGOs - to invoke <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>beneficiary</b> rights to facilitate compliance with human rights obligations embedded in the contract. These corporations thereby can incorporate a mechanism for those third parties to initiate an effective dispute resolution process to address core human rights concerns...|$|E

Instead, under the Dutch legal system, notaries are required to act impartially on behalf of all parties to a contract or transaction. For example, when real property is conveyed, notaries act for both the seller and buyer. They are subject to legal professional privilege and are therefore duty-bound not to betray client confidentiality, thereby giving them the right to withhold information in court as would an attorney or doctor.

"Pay it forward" [...] is {{implemented}} in contract law of loans {{in the concept}} of <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>beneficiaries.</b> Specifically, the creditor offers the debtor the option of paying the debt forward by lending it to a third person instead of paying it back to the original creditor. This contract may include the provision that the debtor may repay the debt in kind, lending the same amount to a similarly disadvantaged party once they have the means, and under the same conditions. Debt and payments can be monetary or by good deeds. A related type of transaction, which starts with a gift instead of a loan, is alternative giving. Pay it forward is an action made.|$|R
40|$|Investment {{treaties}} are triangular treaties. Investment treaties are {{entered into}} by two states {{but they are}} unusual because they provide enforceable protections to investors as <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>beneficiaries.</b> State A (the host state) agrees to provide certain protections to investors coming from State B (the home state). If the investor considers that these protections have been violated, investment treaties also grant the investor permission to bring an arbitral claim directly against the host state. Investment treaties clearly protect investors against certain unilateral actions by host states, such as expropriation without compensation. But do they also protect investors against unilateral actions by home states and collective actions by the treaty parties? For instance: can a home state settle an investor’s claim without the investor’s consent; can a host state rely on inter-state countermeasures as a defense in an investor-state dispute; and can the treaty parties jointly terminate the treaty with immediate effect? Investment treaties tend not to answer these questions, yet these second and third order questions are beginning to plague the field. These issues are important because they strike {{at the heart of}} the investment treaty system, requiring us to confront fundamental and unanswered questions about the nature and limits of investment treaty rights. In particular, what rights have been given to investors? And what powers have been retained by home and host states acting individually and the treaty parties acting collectively? Instead of following the existing path of analyzing whether investment treaties create procedural and/or substantive rights, I contend that investment treaties should be reconceptualized as agreements between sovereign states that create enforceable benefits for investors as non-sovereign, <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>beneficiaries.</b> This triangular approach produces a hybrid theory that draws on principles from public international law, domestic contract law, and public law, which can be used to create appropriate default rules for resolving the three controversies listed above...|$|R
