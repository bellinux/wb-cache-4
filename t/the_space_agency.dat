25|$|The Canadian Space Agency has no {{indigenous}} launch {{system capability}} beyond upper atmospheric sounding rockets. Canada relies on other countries, {{such as the}} U.S., India and Russia, to launch its spacecraft into orbit, but both the Defence Department and <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>agency</b> {{are looking at the}} option of constructing a Canadian-made launcher.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>space</b> <b>agency</b> {{had planned}} the launch on 28 October 2013 but was {{postponed}} to 5 November following {{the delay in}} ISRO's spacecraft tracking ships to take up pre-determined positions due to poor weather in the Pacific Ocean. Launch opportunities for a fuel-saving Hohmann transfer orbit occur every 26 months, {{in this case the}} next two would be in 2016 and 2018.|$|E

The first satellite, PALAPA A1 was first launched on 8 July 1976 Florida time, or on 9 July 1976 Western Indonesian Time on a US rocket, Delta 2914, from the Kennedy Space Center. , Indonesia has launched 11 satellites to connect alongside the archipelago. <b>The</b> <b>space</b> <b>agency</b> has expressed a desire to put Indonesian satellites in orbit with native launch vehicles by 2040.|$|E

Nowak was released on bail, and initially {{pleaded not guilty to}} the charges, which included attempted kidnapping, burglary with assault, and battery. Her assignment to <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>agency</b> as an astronaut was terminated by NASA effective March 8, 2007. On November 10, 2009, Nowak agreed to a plea deal with prosecutors and pleaded guilty to charges of felony, burglary of a car and misdemeanor battery.|$|E

500|$|When {{the novel}} was first published, NASA invited Weir {{to tour the}} Johnson Space Center and Jet Propulsion Laboratory. When Scott began {{preparing}} the film, Weir contacted NASA to collaborate on the film. When Scott and producer Mark Huffam had their first production meeting, they called NASA and spoke with its film and television liaison Bert Ulrich. NASA decided to assist the filmmakers with depicting the science and technology in The Martian since it saw potential in promoting space exploration. Key NASA staff members that joined the partnership were James L. Green, the Director of the Planetary Science Division, and Dave Lavery, the Program Executive for Solar System Exploration. Scott conversed with Green twice before filming started. Over {{a period of a}} month, NASA answered hundreds of questions—on a weekly basis—on everything from radioisotope systems to the look of potential [...] "habs"—the residences for future Mars astronauts. The questions were answered by Green or passed on to the right expert, and then came back to Scott's team to make their way into the production. <b>The</b> <b>space</b> <b>agency</b> also sent hundreds of files of real images of Mars and images of control centers, down to what the computer screens look like, to the production team. Green arranged a tour of the Johnson Space Center in Houston for production designer Arthur Max, who met with individual specialists, taking hundreds of photos as he went for eight hours. The production designers created a futuristic, heavily modernized Mission Control as a studio set; Ars Technica described its depiction as [...] "the space agency that we all dream of" [...] and the opposite of the real Johnson Center's appearance as [...] "a run down college campus".|$|E

2500|$|Griffin {{has been}} criticized by space {{research}} organizations such as NASA Ames Research Center life sciences group for shifting portions of NASA's budget from science to manned spaceflight. Griffin had stated {{that he would not}} shift [...] "one thin dime" [...] of funding from science to human spaceflight, but less than six months later, in February 2006, after NASA Constellation funding did not reach requested levels, NASA revealed a budget that reduced space research funding by about 25%, including indefinite deferrals of planned programs such as the Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter, the Terrestrial Planet Finder, and the Space Interferometry Mission. The logic was that funding Project Constellation, a presidentially mandated program, was the top priority of <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>agency.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The Constellation Program (abbreviated CxP) was a manned spaceflight program {{developed}} by NASA, <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>agency</b> of the United States, from 2005 to 2009. The major {{goals of the}} program were [...] "completion of the International Space Station" [...] and a [...] "return to the Moon no later than 2020" [...] with a crewed flight to the planet Mars as the ultimate goal. The program's logo reflected the three stages of the program: the Earth (ISS), the Moon, and finally Mars—while the Mars goal also found expression in the name given to the program's booster rockets: Ares (The Greek equivalent of the Roman god Mars). The technological aims of the program included the regaining of significant astronaut experience beyond low Earth orbit {{and the development of}} technologies necessary to enable sustained human presence on other planetary bodies.|$|E
50|$|In November 2013, India {{launched}} its first interplanetary mission, the Mars Orbiter Mission, {{popularly known as}} Mangalyaan, to Mars and, was successful, so ISRO on 24 September 2014, became <b>the</b> fourth <b>space</b> <b>agency</b> to reach Mars, after <b>the</b> Soviet <b>space</b> program, NASA, and <b>the</b> European <b>Space</b> <b>Agency.</b> ISRO also became <b>the</b> first <b>space</b> <b>agency</b> and India <b>the</b> first country to reach Mars on its maiden attempt.|$|R
50|$|In addition, the DPT adopted {{scientific}} {{exploration and}} new discoveries {{as the primary}} justification for NASA and modeled <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>agency’s</b> mission on <b>the</b> goals that President Thomas Jefferson established for the Lewis and Clark Expedition almost exactly two centuries earlier. As such, the DPT remains <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>agency’s</b> most ambitious strategic planning effort to combine explicitly NASA’s science programs with human spaceflight.
