There were terrible moments that encompassed a lifetime, an endlessness, when terror was so strong in me, that I could feel idiocy replace reason. (Yet,) I have never left my position, nor have I shirked hazardous duty. Fear {{did not make a}} coward out of me.|$|E
500|$|Although Bond's {{life as a}} {{performer}} in the theatre had ended at age 44, she occasionally gave charity concerts thereafter. [...] Unlike Bond's first marriage, her second was a happy one. Initially reluctant to leave London, Bond reported, [...] "We entertained a good deal, and gave hunt lunches and shooting parties of our own, so my time was well filled up, and I missed London less <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have believed." [...] She founded and directed the Newark Amateur Dramatic Society, an amateur dramatic club, whose performances supported local charities. [...] The couple also often visited London and did some travelling abroad.|$|E

He could figure them out faster <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>could.</b> He would open a gate, and go for a stroll." [...] Lightning Bar sired 148 foals in his eight {{breeding}} seasons, and 118 of those foals went on to either race or show careers. Of his foals, 108started races, and 77won, earning a total of $476,949. The most successful of his foals, Lightning Belle, earned $60,134 (approximately $ as of [...] ).|$|E

500|$|On {{leaving the}} Royal Academy of Music in 1888, Wood taught singing privately {{and was soon}} very successful, {{attracting}} [...] "more singing pupils <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> comfortably deal with" [...] at half a guinea an hour. He also worked as a répétiteur. According to his memoirs, he worked in that capacity for Richard D'Oyly Carte during the rehearsals for the first production of The Yeomen of the Guard at the Savoy Theatre in 1888. His biographer Arthur Jacobs doubts this and discounts exchanges Wood purported to have had with Sir Arthur Sullivan about the score. Jacobs describes Wood's memoirs as [...] "vivacious in style but factually unreliable".|$|E
500|$|On March 5, Washington {{moved more}} of the Ticonderoga cannon and several {{thousand}} men overnight to occupy Dorchester Heights, overlooking Boston. Since it was winter the ground was frozen, making the digging of trenches impractical. [...] Rufus Putnam, {{who had been a}} millwright, developed a plan to fortify the heights using defenses made of heavy timbers and fascines. [...] These were prefabricated {{out of sight of the}} British, and brought in overnight. [...] General Howe is said to have exclaimed, [...] "My God, these fellows have done more work in one night <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> make my army do in three months." [...] The British fleet was within range of the American guns on Dorchester Heights, putting it and the troops in the city at risk.|$|E
500|$|On February 16, 1975, Cher {{returned}} to television with a solo show on CBS. Called Cher, {{it began as}} a highly rated special with guests Flip Wilson, Elton John, and Bette Midler. The show was produced by Geffen and centered on Cher's songs, monologues, comedy performance, and her variation of clothing, which was the largest for a weekly TV show. Early critical reception was favorable; the Los Angeles Times exclaimed that [...] "Sonny without Cher was a disaster. Cher without Sonny, on the other hand, could be the best thing that's happened to weekly television this season." [...] Cher lasted for less than a year, replaced by a new show in which she professionally reunited with ex-husband Sonny; she said, [...] "doing a show alone was more <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> handle." ...|$|E

500|$|Hand {{took the}} defeat in his stride. He {{considered}} the election {{merely as a}} first step in a reform campaign for [...] "real national democracy". Though he had limited his public involvement in the election campaign, he now took part in planning a party structure. He also accepted the Progressive nomination for chief judge of New York Court of Appeals, then an elective position, in September 1913. He refused to campaign, however, and later admitted that [...] "the thought of harassing the electorate was more <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> bear". His vow of silence affected his showing, and he received only 13% of the votes. Hand came to regret his candidacy: [...] "I ought to have lain off, as I now view it; I was a judge and a judge has no business to mess into such things." ...|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weekly Ken Tucker {{enjoyed the}} episode, writing that [...] "this week's Fringe {{contained}} everything I love about the show, from LSD {{to the great}} villain Thomas Jerome Newton. [...] didn't use its Philip K. Dick-shifted title as a coy joke — it really was about the dreams of shapeshifters, dreams and hopes which took a variety of forms". Open Salon praised Torv's performance this season, {{and thought it was}} a [...] "very thought-provoking episode, with some major implications for Peter and Olivia's relationship moving forward". Alex Zalben of UGO Networks, however, called the episode the [...] "first clunker of the season" [...] because despite approving of the plot and the acting, the [...] "writing was uniformly obvious, stilted and kind of terrible... there were more head-slappingly stupid moments <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> count". SFScope's Sarah Stegall noted similarities to the film Blade Runner, and predicted that the consummation of their relationship would cause Peter to discover Fauxlivia's true identity.|$|E
500|$|After {{publishing}} the book, Chang received hate mail, primarily from Japanese ultranationalists, and threatening notes on {{her car and}} also believed her phone was tapped. Her mother said the book [...] "made Iris sad". Suffering from depression, Chang was diagnosed with brief reactive psychosis in August 2004. She began taking medications to stabilize her mood. She wrote: I can never shake my belief that I was being recruited, and later persecuted, by forces more powerful <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have imagined. Whether it was the CIA or some other organization I will never know. As long as I am alive, these forces will never stop hounding me. Chang committed suicide on November 9, 2004. A memorial service was held in China by Nanking Massacre survivors coinciding with her funeral in Los Altos, California. The Memorial Hall of the Victims in the Nanjing Massacre, a memorial site in Nanjing built to commemorate {{the victims of the}} Nanking Massacre, added a wing dedicated to her in 2005.|$|E

500|$|The imposed {{regimen of}} asylum life gave van Gogh a hard-won stability: [...] "I feel happier {{here with my}} work <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> be outside. By staying here a good long time, I shall have learned regular habits {{and in the long}} run the result will be more order in my life." [...] While his time at Saint-Rémy forced him to manage his vices, such as coffee, alcohol, poor eating habits and {{periodic}} attempts to consume turpentine and paint, his stay was not ideal. [...] He needed to obtain permission to leave the asylum grounds. The food was poor; he generally ate only bread and soup. [...] His only apparent form of treatment were two-hour baths twice a week. During his year there, van Gogh had periodic attacks, possibly due to a form of epilepsy. By early 1890, when the attacks worsened, he concluded that his stay at the asylum was not helping him to recover, which led him to move to Auvers-sur-Oise just north of Paris in May 1890.|$|E
500|$|... "Yours" [...] is a pop {{song with}} {{a length of}} six minutes and thirty-nine seconds. It is set in common time in the key of F major and has a tempo of 100 beats per minute. Chapman's vocal range in the song spans from the low note of C4 to the high note of G5. The radio edit of the song has a length of four minutes and fifty seconds and {{contains}} a new verse (I’ve walked the valley of death’s shadow/So deep and dark that I could barely breathe/I’ve had {{to let go of}} more <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> bear/And questioned everything that I believe/But still even here/in this great darkness/A comfort and hope come breaking through/As I can say in life or death/God we belong to you) which Chapman wrote in the weeks following the death of his daughter Maria, who had died on May 21, 2008 after having been accidentally hit by a car driven by her brother. Lyrically, the song describes the omnipotence of God and how [...] "God owns everything and is ever present in every place".|$|E
500|$|Uncle Tom's Cabin {{is written}} in the sentimental and melodramatic style common to 19th century sentimental novels and {{domestic}} fiction (also called women's fiction). These genres were the most popular novels of Stowe's time and tended to feature female main characters and a writing style which evoked a reader's sympathy and emotion. Even though Stowe's novel differs from other sentimental novels by focusing on a large theme like slavery and by having a man as the main character, she still set out to elicit certain strong feelings from her readers. The power {{in this type of}} writing {{can be seen in the}} reaction of contemporary readers. Georgiana May, a friend of Stowe's, wrote a letter to the author, saying: [...] "I was up last night long after one o'clock, reading and finishing Uncle Tom's Cabin. I could not leave it any more <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have left a dying child." [...] Another reader is described as obsessing on the book at all hours and having considered renaming her daughter Eva. Evidently the death of Little Eva affected a lot of people at that time, because in 1852, 300 baby girls in Boston alone were given that name.|$|E

500|$|... "Immortality" [...] {{generally}} received positive {{reviews from}} television critics. Noel Murray of The A.V. Club graded the episode an A-, explaining that [...] "after last week’s semi-misfire, it was reassuring to see Fringe back in good form this week, with a creepy case, a great villain, and a pertinent plot twist". Andrew Hanson from the Los Angeles Times enjoyed the [...] "fun" [...] {{scenes in the}} parallel universe, and stated he would not mind watching an entire show about their Fringe Division. IGN's Ramsey Isler called the victims' method of death in [...] "Immortality" [...] "one of the nastiest in recent memory," [...] and rated the episode 8.5/10. He concluded that he was [...] "quite surprised by this episode. The storyline with the Dr. Silva [...] and his beetles didn't hold my interest at all, but everything else in this installment was fascinating material that expanded the mythos of the series far more <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have imagined." [...] Den of Geek's Billy Grifter wrote, [...] "What this show is now quite good at is lulling us into {{a false sense of}} security, before pulling away the rug rather smartly. If you follow the show, like me, you probably got a slightly déjà vu feeling to the plot, as it rode the previously saddle worn concept of a scientist who has lost the perspective to realise that he's killing people for science." ...|$|E
500|$|Many of {{the methods}} that Playford used were {{described}} by economic conservatives as 'socialism', drawing opposition from within his own party, especially in the Legislative Council. It is even said that the Liberal leader in that chamber—Sir Collier Cudmore—once referred to Playford as a 'Bolshevik'. The unique economic intervention earned Playford scorn from his own colleagues, but the Labor movement was much more receptive. Indeed, Labor leader Mick O'Halloran would dine with Playford {{on a weekly basis}} to discuss the development of the state, and the pair were on close personal terms. At a dinner party, O'Halloran remarked that [...] "I wouldn't want to be Premier even if I could be. Tom Playford can often do more for my own voters <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> if I were in his shoes." [...] O'Halloran's lack of ambition was mocked in a political cartoon, but the Labor leader took the piece as a compliment and had it framed and put on display. As Playford had more opposition from his LCL colleagues in the upper house than Labor, O'Halloran was often described as the premier's 'junior partner". Playford called Labor [...] "our Opposition", in comparison to opponents in his party, which he decried as being [...] "critical without being helpful". This cooperative nature of party politics would not change until Don Dunstan's prominence in the late 1950s, when Playford would be assailed not for his economics, but for his government's comparatively low expenditure on public services such as education and healthcare.|$|E
500|$|Shakira was {{mindful of}} the many critics who would judge her second album, because of the [...] "phenomenon" [...] label applied to her. She knew that some would say that [...] "she had changed too much" [...] and others would reproach her if she {{remained}} the same. [...] "All I could do was to be myself. I understood that all I {{had to do was}} write the music I knew how to write and to write from the heart when I was compelled to. In that way, everything developed naturally, more so <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have imagined", she said. In addition, Shakira insisted on perfection, working on the material to the point of exhaustion. [...] "I made two or three demos of each song. I became a human being so demanding of myself that until the song made my hair stand on end, I wouldn't stop". For the recording of Dónde Están los Ladrones? they were used old amplifiers to achieve a better sound, a German microphone with more than 40 years of existence and made several innovations in the instrumental mixes. Dónde Están los Ladrones? took nine months to produce in total, since more people worked on the album compared with her previous record. Shakira commented, [...] "To me it's a normal time, the gestation period for a baby. But many people wag their finger and tell me that the next one cannot take so long..." ...|$|E
