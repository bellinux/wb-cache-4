River Song (Alex Kingston), whom the Silence had programmed to kill the Doctor, refuses, and they end up in an alternative timeline where all of <b>time</b> <b>is</b> <b>running</b> simultaneously and beginning to disintegrate. The Doctor tries to restore the universe with the help of River and the alternative universe versions of his companions Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) and Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill).

5|$|The {{portrait}} {{depicts the}} tensions and manoeuvrings of 16th century court politics. The deep red background and heavy brushstrokes establish an anxious and tense atmosphere, and the uneasy {{relationship between the}} Pope and his suitors. The pope is old, ill and tired and, to some critics' eyes, glares at Ottavio in an accusatory manner. His hat or camauro cloaks his baldness, but there are tell-tale signs of age in his long nose, dark beady eyes, stooped shoulders and long uneven beard. He is noticeably older than in the second Naples portrait of 1543. This fact {{is reinforced by the}} clock placed on the table beside him, which serves both as a memento mori and a reminder that <b>time</b> <b>is</b> <b>running</b> out. Given this, the presence of his grandsons indicates that the commission was prompted by thoughts of succession.|$|E

The city would then try to recoup its costs for the facility from lease payments by Cirrus over time. The city is concerned that without the government support Cirrus will locate jet production elsewhere due to better incentives. This was confirmed by Cirrus CEO Dale Klapmeier and Duluth Mayor Don Ness, who both indicated that <b>time</b> <b>is</b> <b>running</b> out for the state to commit funds.|$|E

500|$|In [...] "Time Is On My Side", Dean discovers Bela {{no longer}} has the Colt. He later gets her {{criminal}} record from England and learns her true name is Abbie. Almost ten years prior, when she was 14, she had her parents killed in exchange for her soul as part of a ten-year deal made with a Crossroads Demon; though Dean believes that she killed them to inherit their fortune and Bela supports this story, the audience is shown a flashback that suggests that she had actually agreed to the deal to escape abuse from her father. Now desperate because her <b>time</b> <b>is</b> <b>running</b> out, Bela tries to kill the Winchesters, but they anticipate her and escape ahead of time. Dean then calls her a few minutes before her deal is up and she confesses to him she tried {{to get out of the}} deal with the Crossroads Demon by trading the Colt. Once she gave it up, however, the deal changed so she had to kill Sam as well. Though Dean refuses her pleas for help, she reveals to him the demon Lilith holds all the contracts brokered by Crossroads Demons, including his own. Bela's deathand her soul's resulting descent into Hellis inevitable, but not shown.|$|E

He promises Lynsey that if she works out who his next victim is he will confess his crimes to the police, but if she fails another girl will die. Lynsey has {{to go along with}} Silas's mind game after everyone still refuses to believe her claims about him. Hassan explained that Silas does not care if he gets caught or perishes in the process. He reminds Lynsey of his plan by sending her clues and presents, such as a chess queen and a pumpkin containing the message [...] "Tick tock, <b>time</b> <b>is</b> <b>running</b> out". Lynsey confides in Doug and tells him what Silas is doing. Silas picks out four potential victims: Lynsey, Texas, Theresa and Amy Barnes (Ashley Slanina-Davies).

[...] He added that there are [...] "lots of other women" [...] whose morals Silas would find questionable.|$|E
2500|$|Arriving in the Underworld, Emma is {{contacted}} by Neal Cassidy, who warns to turn back, advice Emma chooses to ignore. She {{and the others}} later discover that the Underworld is for those with unfinished business, and they decide to help others move on, while they search for Hook. With the help of Hook's ex-girlfriend Milah, Emma manages to retrieve Hook from Hades's captivity. However, she is unable to split her heart, as Hades has decided that she, Regina, and Snow are to remain behind for freeing the souls of Prince Henry, Hercules, and Megara. It is discovered {{that the only way}} they would have a chance to return to the [...] "Overworld" [...] with Hook is by overthrowing Hades. In order to defeat Hades, Emma and Hook receive help from Hook's brother Liam; however, it is soon discovered that Liam betrayed them after being blackmailed by Hades. Fortunately, Henry agrees to help undo Liam's work by using his powers as the Author. Later, when Emma and Hook try to perform the heartsplit, they are informed by Hades that Hook's body has been dead for too long and is decaying, making him unable to come back to life. When Emma and Hook go into the depths of the Underworld to find ambrosia, something that would save Hook, they are faced with a True Love test, which they pass when Emma chooses Hook over her own heart, only to realize that Hades had tricked them and destroyed the ambrosia, and Hook tells Emma to leave him in the Underworld, as <b>time</b> <b>is</b> <b>running</b> out for her to go through the open portal. Emma objects, saying that she came to the Underworld to save Hook, and she wasn't leaving without him. Hook eventually gets her to say her goodbyes and she does, only to find out that Hades had trapped her and her family in the library using magic. Emma and Regina work together to use their own magic to counteract it. They all go through the portal, and while Emma has second thoughts about leaving Hook, she is persuaded to go by her father. When they get back to Storybrooke, Zelena is informed by Regina and Robin that Hades tried to trap them in the Underworld, but she brushes off the information and is upset with her sister. She talks to Hades about having the life she wants, which is just a simple picket fence life. However, Hades wants a whole kingdom. Robin and Regina break into the mayor's house, where Zelena and Hades are, trying to get Robin's daughter back from Zelena. Emma, distraught and unable to grieve Hook's death, tries to break down the protection spell surrounding the house, but Zelena uses her magic to stop her. Hades is about to use the Olympian Crystal to [...] "end" [...] Regina, but Robin steps in front of her, taking the blow, which kills him. Hades tries to pressure Zelena into killing Regina, but she stabs Hades instead.|$|E

6000|$|This day, whate'er the Fates decree, Shall {{still be}} kept with joy by me: This day then {{let us not}} be told, That you are sick, and I grown old; Nor think on our {{approaching}} ills, And talk of spectacles and pills; To-morrow will be time enough To hear such mortifying stuff. Yet, since from reason may be brought A better and more pleasing thought, Which can, {{in spite of all}} decays, Support a few remaining days; From not the gravest of divines Accept for once some serious lines. [...] Although we now can form no more Long schemes of life, as heretofore; Yet you, while <b>time</b> <b>is</b> <b>running</b> fast, Can look with joy on what is past. [...] Were future happiness and pain A mere contrivance of the brain; As atheists argue, to entice And fit their proselytes for vice; (The only comfort they propose, To have companions in their woes;) Grant this the case; yet sure 'tis hard That virtue, styled its own reward, And by all sages understood To be the chief of human good, Should acting die; nor leave behind Some lasting pleasure in the mind, Which, by remembrance, will assuage Grief, sickness, poverty, and age; And strongly shoot a radiant dart To shine through life's declining part. [...] Say, Stella, feel you no content, Reflecting on a life well spent? Your skilful hand employ'd to save Despairing wretches from the grave; And then supporting with your store Those whom you dragg'd from death before? So Providence on mortals waits, Preserving what it first creates. Your generous boldness to defend An innocent and absent friend; That courage which can make you just To merit humbled in the dust; The detestation you express For vice in all its glittering dress; That patience under torturing pain, Where stubborn stoics would complain: Must these like empty shadows pass, Or forms reflected from a glass? Or mere chimeras in the mind, That fly, and leave no marks behind? Does not the body thrive and grow By food of twenty years ago? And, had it not been still supplied, It must a thousand times have died. Then who with reason can maintain That no effects of food remain? And is not virtue in mankind The nutriment that feeds the mind; Upheld by each good action past, And still continued by the last? Then, who with reason can pretend That all effects of virtue end? [...] Believe me, Stella, when you show That true contempt for things below, Nor prize your life for other ends, Than merely to oblige your friends; Your former actions claim their part, And join to fortify your heart. For Virtue, in her daily race, Like Janus, bears a double face; Looks back with joy where she has gone And therefore goes with courage on: She at your sickly couch will wait, And guide you to a better state. [...] O then, whatever Heaven intends, Take pity on your pitying friends! Nor let your ills affect your mind, To fancy they can be unkind. Me, surely me, you ought to spare, Who gladly would your suffering share; Or give my scrap of life to you, And think it far beneath your due; You, to whose care so oft I owe That I'm alive to tell you so.|$|E
