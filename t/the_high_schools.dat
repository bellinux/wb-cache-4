5|$|Khrushchev also {{proposed}} to restructure Soviet high schools. While <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>schools</b> provided a college preparatory curriculum, in fact few Soviet youths {{went on to}} university. Khrushchev wanted to shift the focus of secondary schools to vocational training: students would {{spend much of their}} time at factory jobs or in apprenticeships and only a small part at the schools. In practice, what occurred is that schools developed links with nearby enterprises, and students went to work for only one or two days a week; the factories and other works disliked having to teach, while students and their families complained that they had little choice in what trade to learn.|$|E
5|$|Davenport {{public schools}} serve nearly 17,000 {{students}} in the communities of Davenport, Blue Grass, Buffalo, and Walcott.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} how the {{curriculum}} and educational contents of <b>high</b> <b>schools</b> in Japan changed before and after <b>the</b> <b>High</b> <b>School</b> System Reform in 1918. The reform aimed at closing <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>school</b> preparatory program for the Imperial Universities {{and replacing it with}} another program for Higher General Education. Previous studies claimed that there were no changes in <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>school</b> system before and after the reform in 1918; they had not examined <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>school</b> curriculum carefully. However, this study examines the process of developing <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>school</b> curriculum and degree of recognition of the reform change by the teacher. Before <b>the</b> <b>High</b> <b>School</b> System Reform in 1918, most of the principals and teachers thought <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>school</b> educational contents should be changed. They recognized a part of the purpose of <b>the</b> <b>High</b> <b>School</b> System Reform to complete <b>the</b> <b>Higher</b> General Education and made new syllabi. However, they did not fully comprehend <b>the</b> <b>Higher</b> General Education so that they intended to prioritize basic education of universities as they had done in the preparatory course education...|$|R

25|$|Admission {{for senior}} high schools, {{especially}} selective high schools, is somewhat {{similar to the}} one for universities in China. Students will go through an application system where they may choose <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>schools</b> at which they wish to study in an order to their preference before <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>schools</b> set out their entrance requirements. Once this is completed and <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>schools</b> will announce their requirements based on this information and the places they will offer in that year. For instance, if the school offers 800 places in that year, the results offered by the 800th intake student will be the standard requirements. So effectively, this ensures the school selects the top candidates in all the students who have applied to said school in that academic year. However, the severe competition only occurs in the very top high schools, normally, most students will have sufficient results for them to continue their secondary education if they wish to.|$|E
