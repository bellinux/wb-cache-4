5|$|Alex's extratropical {{remnants}} sank the Pink Lady, a rowboat carrying four British rowers {{attempting to}} break the record for fastest crossing from St. John's, Newfoundland to Falmouth, Cornwall. They were rescued by a Danish cargo ship, and injuries were limited to a mild concussion and a case of hypothermia. The rowers were roughly two weeks and 370miles (595km) from <b>their</b> <b>destination.</b> The group had been on track {{to break the}} 1896 record of 54days by 10days.|$|E
5|$|Along with immense {{improvements}} to machinery and construction techniques over its six-year course, the war provided planners {{an opportunity to}} conduct a survey of 375,000drivers, asking them about their preferred route to travel to <b>their</b> <b>destination.</b> Using this information, a course was plotted from Windsor to Quebec, bypassing all towns along the way.|$|E
5|$|As {{the fare}} {{system has been}} {{integrated}} by TransitLink, commuters need to pay only one fare and pass through two fare gates (once on entry, once on exit) for an entire journey for most interchange stations, even when transferring between lines operated by different companies. Commuters can choose to extend a trip mid-journey, and pay the difference when they exit <b>their</b> <b>destination</b> station.|$|E

5|$|Crazy Taxi and its sequels are score attack {{games that}} all employ the same {{fundamental}} rules and mechanics. The player controls {{one of several}} taxi drivers in a fictional city, looking for fares and then taking them to <b>their</b> <b>destination</b> in the fastest time possible. The player must perform this while time still remains on an overall gameplay clock. Passengers looking for rides are indicated by an overhead marker that is colored to represent the distance to their intended destination. The color marker ranges from red indicating short trips, to yellow for intermediate distances, and to green indicating long ones. When a passenger is picked up, the player is awarded additional time on the countdown time. Furthermore, a second countdown timer is started, representing how quickly the passenger needs to be at <b>their</b> <b>destination.</b> While a passenger is in the taxi, a large green arrow is shown on the player's HUD that points {{in the general direction}} of the passenger's destination to help guide the player through the map.|$|E
5|$|In 1897, 1,800 {{travellers}} attempted {{this route}} {{but the vast}} majority were caught along the river when the region iced over in October. Only 43 successfully reached the Klondike before winter and of those 35 had to return, having thrown away their equipment en route to reach <b>their</b> <b>destination</b> in time. The remainder mostly found themselves stranded in isolated camps and settlements along the ice-covered river often in desperate circumstances.|$|E

5|$|The first {{official}} communications between Western Europe and the Mongol Empire occurred between Pope Innocent IV (fl. 1243–1254) and the Great Khans, via letters and envoys that were sent overland and {{could take years}} to arrive at <b>their</b> <b>destination.</b> The communications initiated {{what was to become}} a regular pattern in European–Mongol communications: the Europeans would ask the Mongols to convert to Christianity, and the Mongols would respond with demands for submission.|$|E
5|$|The poem {{discusses}} {{the nature of}} time and what humanity's place is within time. Life is described metaphorically as travelling in a boat and humanity's fixation on science and future gain keeping the travellers from reaching <b>their</b> <b>destination.</b> Within the poem, Eliot invokes the image of Krishna to emphasise the need to follow the divine will instead of seeking personal gain.|$|E

5|$|These {{observations}} {{argue against}} traditional theories that white sharks are coastal territorial predators, {{and open up}} the possibility of interaction between shark populations that were previously {{thought to have been}} discrete.

5|$|They {{travelled}} with a Baedeker guidebook, but the {{two women}} soon became lost after missing the turn for the main avenue, Allée des Deux Trianons. They passed this road, and entered a lane, where unknown to them they passed <b>their</b> <b>destination.</b> Moberly noticed a woman shaking a white cloth out of a window and Jourdain noticed an old deserted farmhouse, outside of which was an old plough.|$|E
5|$|Bonventre {{was called}} to a meeting with Rastelli in Queens. He {{was picked up by}} Vitale and Attanasio and driven to a garage. En route, Attanasio shot Bonventre twice in the head but only wounded him; he would kill Bonventre with two more shots when they reached <b>their</b> <b>destination.</b> The task of {{disposing}} of Bonventre's corpse was handed to Gabriel Infanti, who promised Vitale that Bonventre's remains would disappear forever. However, after a tipoff, the remains were discovered on April 16, 1984, in a warehouse in Garfield, New Jersey, stuffed into two 55-gallon glue drums.|$|E

These foramina and canals may contain more than one cranial nerve, and may also contain blood vessels.|$|R
5|$|Journey is Thatgamecompany's latest game.

Players cannot communicate verbally, but may help each other or not as they wish. The game was released for the PlayStation 3 on March 13, 2012. Austin Wintory {{was nominated for a}} Grammy Award in 2013 for Best Score Soundtrack for Journey, the first such nomination for a full video game score, but lost to Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross for The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.|$|E
5|$|On 29 November 1942, Armidale {{set out for}} an {{operation}} to Betano, Timor, along with HMAS Castlemaine. The two ships were attacked by Japanese aircraft along the way, and were subsequently late in arriving at <b>their</b> <b>destination,</b> missing a planned rendezvous with HMAS Kuru. While returning to Darwin, the pair encountered Kuru south of Betano and it was decided by Castlemaines commanding officer—as the senior officer—that Armidale and Kuru should make for Betano. The two ships took different routes to Betano, during which both vessels came under aerial assault.|$|E
