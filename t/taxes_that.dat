The present Dukes of Buccleuch, Richmond, Grafton and St Albans descend from Charles in unbroken male line. Diana, Princess of Wales, was descended from two of Charles's illegitimate sons: the Dukes of Grafton and Richmond.

5|$|In the English towns the {{burgage tenure}} for urban {{properties}} was established {{early on in}} the medieval period, and was based primarily on tenants paying cash rents rather than providing labour services. Further development of a set of <b>taxes</b> <b>that</b> could be raised by the towns included murage for walls, pavage for streets, and pontage, a temporary tax for the repair of bridges. Combined with the lex mercatoria, which was a set of codes and customary practices governing trading, these provided a reasonable basis for the economic governance of the towns.|$|E
5|$|Some of the temple's {{supplies}} {{came from}} direct donations by the king. In the New Kingdom, when Egypt was an imperial power, these donations often {{came out of}} the spoils of the king's military campaigns or the tribute given by his client states. The king might also levy various <b>taxes</b> <b>that</b> went directly to support a temple.

50|$|One type of <b>tax</b> <b>that</b> {{does not}} create a large excess burden is the {{lump-sum}} tax. A lump-sum tax is a fixed <b>tax</b> <b>that</b> must be paid by everyone and the amount a person is taxed remains constant regardless of income or owned assets. It does not create excess burden because these taxes do not alter economic decisions. Because the tax remains constant, an individual’s incentives and a firm’s incentives will not fluctuate, {{as opposed to a}} graduated income <b>tax</b> <b>that</b> <b>taxes</b> people more for earning more.|$|R

5|$|Dio {{maintains}} that one purpose for Caracalla issuing the edict was {{the desire to}} increase state revenue; at the time, Rome was in a difficult financial situation and needed {{to pay for the}} new pay raises and benefits that were being conferred on the military. The edict widened the obligation for public service and gave increased revenue through the inheritance and emancipation <b>taxes</b> <b>that</b> only had to be paid by Roman citizens. The provincials also benefited from this edict because they were now able {{to think of themselves as}} equal partners to the Romans in the empire. However, few of those that gained citizenship were wealthy, and while it is true that Rome was in a difficult financial situation, it is thought that this could not have been the sole purpose of the edict.|$|E
5|$|The Persian traveller, Nasir-i-Khusron, {{wrote of}} the exotic and {{beautiful}} wares in the Fustat markets: iridescent pottery, crystal, and many fruits and flowers, even during the winter months. From 975 to 1075, Fustat was a major production centre for Islamic art and ceramics, {{and one of the}} wealthiest cities in the world. One report stated that it paid <b>taxes</b> <b>that</b> were equivalent to US$150,000 per day, to the administration of Caliph Mo'ezz. Modern archaeological digs have turned up trade artefacts {{from as far away as}} Spain, China, and Vietnam.

5|$|The top 10% paid 51.8% {{of total}} federal taxes in 2009, {{and the top}} 1%, with 13.4% of pre-tax {{national}} income, paid 22.3% of federal taxes. In 2013 the Tax Policy Center projected total federal effective tax rates of 35.5% for the top 1%, 27.2% for the top quintile, 13.8% for the middle quintile, and −2.7% for the bottom quintile. The incidence of corporate income tax has {{been a matter of}} considerable ongoing controversy for decades. State and local taxes vary widely, but are generally less progressive than federal taxes as they rely heavily on broadly borne regressive sales and property <b>taxes</b> <b>that</b> yield less volatile revenue streams, though their consideration does not eliminate the progressive nature of overall taxation.|$|E
5|$|With Brownlee as premier and Reid as Provincial Treasurer, {{government}} deficits ceased: {{the budget}} showed a surplus in {{every year from}} 1925 until 1930, except for 1927. In 1929, Reid predicted that Alberta was {{on the cusp of}} a period of economic expansion; instead, he was soon confronted with the Great Depression. He drastically cut provincial spending and raised taxes, in part by creating a new income tax. He reluctantly accepted that these measures could not prevent a return to deficit spending. His willingness to outspend revenues was due less to any Keynesian desire to stimulate the economy than to a belief that there was no further spending to be cut or further <b>taxes</b> <b>that</b> could reasonably be raised. Conversely, he rejected calls from the opposition Liberals to cut taxes as a stimulus measure.|$|E
5|$|Justinian's {{ambition}} {{to restore the}} Roman Empire to its former glory was only partly realized. In the West, the brilliant early military successes of the 530s were followed by years of stagnation. The dragging war with the Goths was a disaster for Italy, even though its long-lasting effects may have been less severe than is sometimes thought. The heavy <b>taxes</b> <b>that</b> the administration imposed upon its population were deeply resented. The final victory in Italy and the conquest of Africa and the coast of southern Hispania significantly enlarged the area over which the Empire could project its power and eliminated all naval threats to the empire. Despite losing much of Italy soon after Justinian's death, the empire retained several important cities, including Rome, Naples, and Ravenna, leaving the Lombards as a regional threat. The newly founded province of Spania kept the Visigoths {{as a threat to}} Hispania alone and not to the western Mediterranean and Africa.|$|E
40|$|Using a {{model of}} {{nonlinear}} decay of the stock pollutant, and starting from the same initial conditions, the paper shows <b>that</b> a <b>tax</b> <b>that</b> only corrects for stock externalities can, at the steady state, be higher than a <b>tax</b> <b>that</b> corrects for both stock and flow externalities. The {{results indicate that the}} possibility exists that the optimal corrective tax (correcting for both externalities) may result in a steady state with fewer emissions and lower tax payments than a <b>tax</b> <b>that</b> only corrects for stock externality. Thus, a failure to consider flow externalities may have important implications fior the time path and steady states of production, emissions and taxes, and not just in terms of transitory consumption...|$|R

5|$|The co-rule between Eystein, Sigurd and Olaf entailed {{a shared}} kingship, and the kingdom itself was not divided into fixed borders. During {{the early years}} of their reign, Eystein is {{nonetheless}} said to have stayed mostly in Western Norway and Trøndelag, while Sigurd was in Viken. In practice, only Eystein and Sigurd ever ruled as kings, as Olaf was considerably younger and died when he was only seventeen years old, and virtually nothing is known about him beyond his name. One of the earliest acts by the kings was passing a retterbot, a special law ordained by the king, which among other things abolished various royal <b>taxes</b> <b>that</b> originated from the Danish rule of Sweyn Knutsson and Ælfgifu (under Cnut the Great) in the early 1030s. The kings became very popular because of this. According to some sources, the main motivation for abolishing the taxes was to gain the support of the population for Sigurd's planned crusade.|$|E
5|$|The {{unitary state}} {{was not an}} end in itself, but a means to higher ends. The {{republic}} had been in dire financial straits even before the revolution of 1795. The system of public finance {{that had been the}} envy of the world in its Golden Age, enabling it to throw far beyond its weight in world politics up to the Peace of Utrecht in 1713, had become a millstone around its neck. By 1713 the public debt of the province of Holland had reached 310 million guilders; the debt of the Generality was 68 million; and the debts of the smaller provinces, and of the cities came on top of this. The debt service of Holland alone in that year required 14 million guilders, which exceeded its regular tax revenue. Most of this humongous public debt was held by Dutch private citizens, so in a sense it merely engendered an internal money circuit in the Dutch economy. However, it was mostly concentrated {{in the hands of the}} rentier class, while the debt was serviced by mainly regressive <b>taxes</b> <b>that</b> weighed on the working population. Most importantly, these were taxes levied by the individual provinces, who serviced their own debt, and paid into the Generality coffers according to a repartition schedule last changed in 1616. Attempts to reform this structure during the 18th century were mainly fruitless.|$|E
