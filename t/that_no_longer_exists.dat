25|$|As {{a result}} of the PPACA, {{hospitals}} and medical care facilities are forced to rethink the demand for nurses and non-physician providers. This is mainly because this new Act drew millions of people the opportunity at medical attention that did not have it before, and {{because there are so many}} new people in need of medical attention, the need for medical professionals also grows. With the combination of this new Act, and the aging Baby Boomer population, there is expected to be a large increase in the need for medical staff, especially physicians. Unfortunately, the Act did not account for the need for increased physician residency expansion thus creating an artificial shortage of physicians in an already-overloaded system. According to a study published in American Medical News (an online publication <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>exists),</b> nurse practitioners' jobs are expected to grow up to 130 percent from 86,000 in 2008 to 198,000 in 2025 through aggressive lobbying. Though there is some skepticism to these vast figures, they are backed up by many studies and the opinions of very well known medical professionals.|$|E
25|$|At {{its maximum}} extent in 1942, MD 216 mostly {{followed}} its present alignment from Highland to Scaggsville. The highway continued along {{what is now}} Old Scaggsville Road, which is now broken into two parts by the I-95 interchange. MD 216 crossed the Patuxent River in line with 9th Street in Laurel on a bridge <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>exists.</b> The highway turned east onto Main Street, which it followed through its intersection with US 1. MD 216 passed under the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad (now CSX's Capital Subdivision) and curved east to cross the Patuxent River on another defunct bridge. The highway passed {{along the edge of}} Laurel Park Racecourse and intersected Brock Bridge Road near the latter road's modern intersection with MD 198. MD 216 continued along a path generally to the north of what is now MD 198; several pieces of the old highway remain in Maryland City and {{on the east side of}} the BaltimoreWashington Parkway. The state highway's eastern end was at the entrance to Fort Meade near the Little Patuxent River.|$|E

500|$|Writing in 1862 (but before Kennedy's rebuilding), the clergyman and {{antiquarian}} Harry Longueville Jones recorded {{that the}} church was [...] internally, divided by some woodwork into a nave and chancel.

He {{also noted that the}} 12th-century font had an ornamental design similar to other fonts elsewhere in Anglesey.

500|$|In {{obscuring}} reality, truth becomes unclear. As {{literary critic}} Mireille Rosello notes, {{it is the}} President who decides what is true, denying any other opinion, even if other characters witness an event with their own eyes or ears. Unlike {{the characters in the}} novel, readers are aware that the characters are relying on a notion of truth or reality <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>exists</b> under the dictatorship of the President. [...] "Truth" [...] does not exist before the President puts it into words, and even at that, the only [...] "truth" [...] under dictatorial rule is the words the President is speaking at any given momentone cannot even safely repeat the President's versions of events. The characters are thus left unaware of what constitutes the [...] "truth".|$|E
500|$|Marinus Willett Memorial is a {{monument}} to Colonel Marinus Willett commemorating his combat and character during the French and Indian Wars. It consists of a [...] boulder from the [...] "scenes of conflict" [...] he fought in, and the plaque is dedicated to his [...] "patriotic services in defense of Albany {{and the people of}} the Mohawk". The boulder was placed by the Sons of the American Revolution in 1907, facing towards an entrance to the park from the corner of State and Willett streets, an entrance <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>exists.</b> The boulder's back faced Henry Johnson Boulevard (formerly Northern Boulevard) and was the scene of many vehicular accidents as drivers missed a sharp curve. In 2006, as part of the 200th anniversary of the park, the boulder was moved [...] to the corner of State and Willett.|$|E
2500|$|Peaslake School {{was founded}} by George Cubitt (the 1st Lord Ashcombe), Mr. Justice Bray, the Misses Spottiswoode, and others in 1870. [...] John Bartholomew {{mentions}} the place in his gazetteer of 1887 as a village in Shere parish, Surrey [...] "4½ miles SE. of Guildford". In {{the last decade of}} the 19th century a road from Ewhurst, practicable for wheels, was the first one brought into Peaslake as district councils were instituted. It was formerly accessible from the north, but was on the edge of the accessible country with no real road beyond. A Working Men's Institute <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>exists</b> was built in 1891 by the Misses Spottiswoode of Drydown, multiple benefactors to the neighbourhood. Most of the oldest extant houses were built in the brief Edwardian period (1901–1911).|$|E

2500|$|The first {{segment of}} MD 201, {{which was then}} known as River Road, was {{constructed}} as a [...] concrete road from the District of Columbia boundary to Tuxedo Road (now MD 459) in Cheverly in 1926 and 1927. The highway was extended north to US 50 (now MD 450) in Bladensburg in 1929. MD 201 was widened {{with a pair of}} [...] bituminous shoulders along its entire length in 1941. The state highway originally followed what is now MD 965 north from Eastern Avenue along the northbound side of the modern highway. MD 201 continued along a road <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>exists</b> across Beaverdam Creek and the Pennsylvania Railroad (now Amtrak Northeast Corridor). North of what is now US 50, the highway followed the Kenilworth Avenue portion of MD 459 to its junction with MD 201, where the route was broken by modern MD 201 and the BaltimoreWashington Parkway. MD 201 continued along what are today MD 769D and MD 769C (52nd Avenue, Quincy Street, and 48th Street) to US 50 in Bladensburg.|$|E
2500|$|The film {{takes place}} in August 2011, {{one year after the}} events of the anime series. After going through a {{painstaking}} journey across multiple 'World Lines' due to the invention of 'D-Mail', text messages that can be sent to the past, Rintarō Okabe has assumedly landed in the [...] "Steins Gate" [...] World Line, in which he was able to prevent the deaths of both Mayuri Shiina and Kurisu Makise, as well as prevent a future ruled by SERN due to the invention of a time machine <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>exists.</b> On August 3, Kurisu arrives in Japan for a press conference and reunites with {{all the members of the}} Future Gadget Laboratory. Meanwhile, Rintarō starts having intense side effects from his time travels, seeing visions of alternate Worldlines. The next day on August 4, a mysterious visitor shows up at Kurisu's hotel, telling her to remember three things: a cell phone, a microwave oven, and SERN. Later that day, as Kurisu is talking to Rintarō about how her own instances of déjà vu may be similar to Rintarō's 'Reading Steiner' ability to remember things from other World Lines, Rintarō suddenly disappears before Kurisu's eyes. Furthermore, no one else seems to remember Rintarō ever existed, with Kurisu barely retaining a faint memory of someone.|$|E
2500|$|This initial garden {{allotment}} soon proved insufficient for {{the purposes}} {{for which it was}} intended, and in 1786 it was decided to move to the present site, right next to the Piano di Sant'Erasmo, best remembered for the [...] unfortunate events that occurred there during the Spanish Inquisition. In 1789 construction of {{the main part of the}} administrative buildings of the garden commenced in a neoclassical style. It is constructed with a central building, the Gymnasium, and two side buildings, the Tepidariumand the Caldarium, designed by the Frenchman Léon Dufourny, who had also designed a part of the oldest section of garden, right next to the Gymnasium. Its rectangular layout is divided into four quadrangles, within which the species are categorised according to Carl Linnaeus' system of classification. The new garden was opened in 1795; [...] in the ensuing years it was improved, [...] with the Aquarium (1798), a great pool [...] hosting numerous species of aquatic plants, and the serra Maria Carolina (or Maria Carolina glasshouse), completed in 1823. The huge Ficus macrophylla, which is an emblem and a well-known attraction of the modern garden, was imported from Norfolk Island (Australia), in 1845. [...] Today's area, some 10 hectares, was reached in 1892, following successive extensions. In 1913 the Giardino coloniale (Colonial garden) was developed alongside the botanic gardens, but <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>exists.</b> [...] The gardens have been managed by the Department of Botany since 1985.|$|E

60|$|His most {{important}} hint {{was on the}} moneys {{of this part of}} the world. There is something in the simplicity of a decimal coinage which is revolting to the human mind; thus the French, in small affairs, reckon strictly by halfpence; and you have to solve, by a spasm of mental arithmetic, such posers as thirty-two, forty-five, or even a hundred halfpence. In the Pacific States they have made a bolder push for complexity, and settle their affairs by a coin that no longer <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>exists</b> - the BIT, or old Mexican real. The supposed value of the bit is twelve and a half cents, eight to the dollar. When it comes to two bits, the quarter-dollar stands for the required amount. But how about an odd bit? The nearest coin to it is a dime, which is, short by a fifth. That, then, is called a SHORT bit. If you have one, you lay it triumphantly down, and save two and a half cents. But if you have not, and lay down a quarter, the bar-keeper or shopman calmly tenders you a dime by way of change; and thus you have paid what is called a LONG BIT, and lost two and a half cents, or even, by comparison with a short bit, five cents. In country places all over the Pacific coast, nothing lower than a bit is ever asked or taken, which vastly increases the cost of life; as even for a glass of beer you must pay fivepence or sevenpence-halfpenny, as the case may be. You would say that this system of mutual robbery was as broad as it was long; but I have discovered a plan to make it broader, with which I here endow the public. It is brief and simple - radiantly simple. There is one place where five cents are recognised, and that is the post-office. A quarter is only worth two bits, a short and a long. Whenever you have a quarter, go to the post-office and buy five cents worth of postage-stamps; you will receive in change two dimes, that is, two short bits. The purchasing power of your money is undiminished. You can go and have your two glasses of beer all the same; and you have made yourself a present of five cents worth of postage-stamps into the bargain. Benjamin Franklin would have patted me on the head for this discovery.|$|E
