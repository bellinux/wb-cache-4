5|$|Chastain's {{final two}} {{roles of the}} year were in Wilde Salomé, a {{documentary}} based on her 2006 production of Salome, and the critically panned crime-thriller Texas Killing Fields. The latter, co-starring Sam Worthington and Jeffrey Dean Morgan, was a partly fictionalized version of the events in <b>the</b> <b>killing</b> <b>fields</b> of Texas, in which she played a homicide detective. Los Angeles Times Betsy Sharkey praised Chastain's polished Texas drawl, but criticized the film. Chastain's work in 2011, especially in The Help, Take Shelter and The Tree of Life, gained her awards from several critics' organizations, including the New York Film Critics Circle, the National Society of Film Critics and the Los Angeles Film Critics Association.|$|E
5|$|In 1980 Waterston's {{portrayal}} of American theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer {{in the television}} miniseries Oppenheimer saw him earn another Golden Globe nomination. Two years later, Waterston played American journalist Sydney Schanberg in the 1984 British drama <b>The</b> <b>Killing</b> <b>Fields,</b> opposite Haing S. Ngor and John Malkovich – for his performance Waterston received an Academy Award for Best Actor nomination. His other biographical roles include Heaven's Gate as Old West figure Frank Canton (1980) and as President Abraham Lincoln in the miniseries Lincoln (1988), the 1990 documentary miniseries The Civil War, and the play Abe Lincoln in Illinois. His performance {{in the last of}} these garnered him a nomination for the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play.|$|E
50|$|A <b>killing</b> <b>field</b> was an {{area between}} the main wall and a {{secondary}} wall, so when the first wall was breached the attackers would run into <b>the</b> <b>killing</b> <b>field</b> to be confronted by another wall from which soldiers bombarded them. Soldiers would be positioned atop the second wall and armed with any variety of weapons, ranging from bows to crossbows to simple rocks.|$|R
50|$|Shuvalov's gun had an unusual, oval bore, {{which was}} {{designed}} to facilitate shot dispersal while firing canisters and therefore to increase <b>the</b> <b>killing</b> <b>field.</b> A special canister round produced for the cannon contained 168 balls; a grapeshot version, with 48 larger balls, was also provided for shooting at 300-600 yards distance.|$|R

5|$|By December 1989, Stone began {{approaching}} studios to {{back his}} film. While in pre-production on The Doors, {{he met with}} three executives at Warner Bros. who wanted {{him to make a}} film about Howard Hughes. However, Warren Beatty owned the rights and so Stone pitched JFK. Studio president and Chief Operating Officer Terry Semel liked the idea. He had a reputation for making political and controversial films, including All the President's Men, The Parallax View and <b>The</b> <b>Killing</b> <b>Fields.</b> Stone made a handshake deal with Warner Bros. whereby the studio would get all the rights to the film and put up $20 million for the budget. The director did this so that the screenplay would not be widely read and bid on, and he also knew that the material was potentially dangerous and wanted only one studio to finance it. Finally, Stone liked Semel's track record of producing political films.|$|E
25|$|Dith Pran (1942-2008), {{his life}} was portrayed in the movie <b>The</b> <b>Killing</b> <b>Fields.</b> He was a photojournalist with The New York Times, a human rights activist and a {{survivor}} of <b>the</b> <b>killing</b> <b>fields</b> of Cambodia.|$|E

25|$|When the Communist Party of Cambodia, the Khmer Rouge (1951–81), {{established}} their regime as Democratic Kampuchea (1975–1979) in Cambodia, their anti-intellectualism which idealised {{the country and}} demonised the cities was immediately imposed on the country {{in order to establish}} agrarian socialism, thus, they emptied cities in order to purge the Khmer nation of every traitor, enemy of the state, and intellectual, often symbolised by eyeglasses (see <b>the</b> <b>Killing</b> <b>Fields).</b>|$|E
25|$|Many Cambodians recall {{spending}} some time at KID, including Dr Haing S. Ngor of <b>The</b> <b>Killing</b> <b>Fields,</b> who (as a refugee) was employed in 1979 in the 400-bed ICRC hospital. The final scene in the movie was filmed at KID in 1983, in the surgical ward where Dr. Ngor had worked. Former refugees who have described their experiences in Khao-I-Dang include Molyda Szymusiak, Chanrithy Him, Oni Vitandham and Mohm Phat.|$|E
25|$|Totalitarian governments {{manipulate}} {{and apply}} anti-intellectualism to repress political dissent. During the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939) {{and the following}} right-wing dictatorship (1939–1975) of General Francisco Franco, the reactionary repression of the White Terror (1936–1945) was notably anti-intellectual, {{with most of the}} 200,000 civilians killed being the Spanish intelligentsia, the politically active teachers and academics, artists and writers of the deposed Second Spanish Republic (1931–1939). In the Communist state of Democratic Kampuchea (1975–1979), the Khmer Rouge régime of Pol Pot condemned most of the non–Communist intelligentsia to death in <b>the</b> <b>Killing</b> <b>Fields.</b>|$|E

25|$|The 30th Punjabis {{served with}} {{distinction}} in the German East Africa, while their 2nd Battalion {{served in the}} Palestine Campaign. The regiment raised {{a total of three}} new battalions during the war. Another regiment that raised three battalions was the 9th Bhopal Infantry, who were dispatched to <b>the</b> <b>killing</b> <b>fields</b> of France and Flanders in 1914. The regiment suffered heavy losses at the Battles of Neuve Chapelle, Festubert, Givenchy and the Second Ypres. In 1915, they arrived in Mesopotamia, where Sepoy Chatta Singh was awarded the Victoria Cross for exceptional valour. By the time they returned home, only fifteen men remained of those who had sailed for France in 1914.|$|E
25|$|In Cambodia, a {{genocide}} {{was carried}} out by the Khmer Rouge (KR) regime led by Pol Pot between 1975 and 1979 in which an estimated one and a half to three million people died. The KR group had planned to create a form of agrarian socialism which was founded on the ideals of Stalinism and Maoism. The KR policies of forced relocation of the population from urban centers, torture, mass executions, use of forced labor, malnutrition, and disease led to the death of an estimated 25 {{percent of the total population}} (around 2 million people). The genocide ended following the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia. At least 20,000 mass graves, known as <b>the</b> <b>Killing</b> <b>Fields,</b> have since been uncovered.|$|E
500|$|In one scene, Homer tells Marge: [...] "We were {{so close}} to winning the championship. Now, thanks to Burns, it's never going to happen.

In the original Fox broadcast, the name in the inscription on the Academy Award was Haing S. Ngor. In American syndication and the season seven DVD, the name was changed to Don Ameche (who had won for Cocoon). Ngor, who won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for the 1984 film <b>The</b> <b>Killing</b> <b>Fields,</b> was murdered on February 25, 1996, between the original and the syndicated broadcast. Producers were concerned the syndicated episode would imply Homer had murdered Ngor to steal the statue.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Bangla College <b>killing</b> <b>field</b> {{is located}} in the Mirpur area of Dhaka, Bangladesh. In 1971, during the Bangladesh Liberation War, the Pakistani army killed 3 million Bangladeshis with the help of some local collaborators. It has been claimed to be the largest {{genocide}} after World War II. Bangladesh officially became independent on 16 December 1971, but the neighborhood of Mirpur was liberated from Pakistan Army and local Bihari people on 31 January 1972, 45 days after the declaration of independence was signed. Mirpur was largely inhabited by Biharis who were against the secession movement, so genocide took place on a large scale. Mirpur was the last battlefield of the war. Bangla College is one of <b>the</b> largest <b>killing</b> <b>fields</b> in Bangladesh.|$|R
5|$|The Maratha cannonade {{intensified}} as the British redeployed. Although British artillery {{was brought}} forward to counter, it was ineffective against the mass firepower of the Maratha guns and quickly disabled through {{the weight of}} shot directed against it. British casualties mounted as the Maratha guns {{turned their attention to}} the infantry and subjected them to a barrage of canister, grape and round shot. Wellesley decided that his only option to neutralise the artillery and get his men out of <b>the</b> <b>killing</b> <b>field</b> was to advance directly into the mouth of the Maratha artillery. He ordered his cannon to be abandoned and gave the command for his infantry to march forward with bayonets fixed.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> Sandarmokh <b>killing</b> <b>field</b> {{was only}} found in July 1997 after lengthy {{searches}} {{and at first}} it was not known how many thousands had been shot and buried there.

500|$|During the Vietnam War, North Vietnam invaded and {{occupied}} parts of Cambodia {{to use as}} military bases, which contributed to {{the violence of the}} Cambodian Civil War between the pro-American government of Lon Nol and communist Khmer Rouge insurgents. Documents uncovered from the Soviet archives reveal that the North Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia in 1970 was launched {{at the request of the}} Khmer Rouge after negotiations with Nuon Chea. [...] US and South Vietnamese forces responded to these actions with a bombing campaign and ground incursion, the effects of which are disputed by historians. [...] Under the leadership of Pol Pot, the Khmer Rouge would eventually kill 1–3 million Cambodians in <b>the</b> <b>killing</b> <b>fields,</b> out of a 1975 population of roughly 8 million. Martin Shaw described these atrocities as [...] "the purest genocide of the Cold War era." [...] Backed by the Kampuchean United Front for National Salvation, an organization of Khmer pro-Soviet Communists and Khmer Rouge defectors led by Heng Samrin, Vietnam invaded Cambodia on 22 December 1978. The invasion succeeded in deposing Pol Pot, but the new state would struggle to gain international recognition beyond the Soviet Bloc sphere —despite the previous international outcry at Pol Pot's DK regime's gross human rights violations, and it would be bogged down in a guerrilla war led from refugee camps located in the border with Thailand. Following Khmer Rouge's destruction, Cambodia's national reconstruction would be severely hampered and Vietnam would suffer a punitive Chinese attack.|$|E
