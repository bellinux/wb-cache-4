5|$|In Reformed theology, baptism is {{a sacrament}} {{signifying}} the baptized person's union with Christ, or {{becoming part of}} Christ and being treated {{as if they had}} done everything Christ had.

Sacraments are believed to have their effect through the Holy Spirit, but these effects are only believed to be beneficial <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> faith in Christ.|$|E

5|$|In Reformed theology, baptism is {{the sacrament}} of {{initiation}} into the visible church, or body of people who publicly claim faith in Christ. Baptism also signifies regeneration and remission of sin. Reformed Christians believe that the children of those who express faith in Christ should be baptized. Because baptism {{is believed to be}} beneficial only <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> faith in Christ, infants are baptized {{on the basis of the}} promise of faith which will come to fruition later in life.|$|E

Subsequently, three more Disaster Recovery Centers became scheduled to open on July 16.|$|E

5|$|Genetics {{may play}} a role in a person's {{disposition}} to SAH; risk is increased three- to fivefold in first-degree relatives of people having had a subarachnoid hemorrhage. However, lifestyle factors are more important in determining overall risk. These risk factors are smoking, hypertension (high blood pressure), and excessive alcohol consumption. Having smoked in the past confers a doubled risk of SAH compared <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> never smoked. Some protection of uncertain significance is conferred by caucasian ethnicity, hormone replacement therapy, and diabetes mellitus. There is likely an inverse relationship between total serum cholesterol and the risk of non-traumatic SAH, though confirmation of this association is hindered by a lack of studies. Approximately 4 percent of aneurysmal bleeds occur after sexual intercourse and 10 percent of people with SAH are bending over or lifting heavy objects at the onset of their symptoms.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Rowling and MEP Emma Nicholson {{founded the}} Children's High Level Group (now Lumos). In January 2006, Rowling went to Bucharest to {{highlight}} the use of caged beds in mental institutions for children. To further support the CHLG, Rowling auctioned one of seven handwritten and illustrated copies of The Tales of Beedle the Bard, a series of fairy tales referred to in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. The book was purchased for £1.95million by on-line bookseller Amazon.com on 13 December 2007, becoming the most expensive modern book ever sold at auction. Rowling gave away the remaining six copies <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> a close connection with the Harry Potter books. In 2008, Rowling agreed to publish the book with the proceeds going to Lumos. On 1 June 2010 (International Children's Day), Lumos launched an annual initiative – Light a Birthday Candle for Lumos. In November 2013, Rowling handed over all earnings {{from the sale of}} The Tales of Beedle the Bard, totalling nearly £19 million.|$|E

5|$|The {{territory}} of Belarus {{is divided into}} discrete regions, called oblasts. The oblasts are further divided into districts which are in turn subdivided into cities. The Constitution also allows for special regions to be created, which are {{to be controlled by}} legislation. Citizens of Belarus are also promised protection and sponsorship, regardless of whether they are inside Belarusian borders or in a foreign country. With some exceptions, those who do not have a nationality and foreigners are, under the Constitution, granted the same status and rights as citizens of Belarus. Belarus also has the power to grant asylum <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> been subject to persecution due to their ethnic background, political ideology or religious affiliation.|$|E
5|$|An {{association}} with the folliculin (FLCN) gene was first reported in 2002. This 14-exon gene {{is located on the}} short arm of chromosome 17 (17p11.2) and has a cytosine-rich region in exon 11 particularly susceptible to mutation. The most common mutation in this region is the insertion or deletion of a cytosine residue, found in 53% of Birt–Hogg–Dubé families. There is {{no significant difference in the}} symptoms experienced by families with an insertion at that location compared <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> a deletion. However, mutations in FLCN associated with Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome are heterogeneous, and are often nonsense mutations or frameshift mutations that cause early truncation of the protein product at the carboxy-terminus. Very rarely, missense mutations are observed. Mutations are often passed from one generation to the next in an autosomal dominant fashion but can occur as a new mutation in an individual with no prior family history (a de novo mutation). The children of an affected parent each have a 50% chance of having the disease. Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome has very high penetrance. A correlation between different FLCN genotypes and phenotypes has not been discovered.|$|E
5|$|After Indian Independence in 1947, all the non-princely {{states were}} subject to a test of {{religious}} majority in which the Muslim majority areas formed the Dominion of Pakistan, while the other regions formed the Dominion of India. Murshidabad (the capital city for both, the Nawabs of Bengal and the Nawabs of Murshidabad) {{became a part of}} East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) for two days, as it had a Muslim majority. However, it became a part of India on 17 August 1947. The Pakistani flag was brought down from the Hazarduari Palace and the Indian tricolour was hoisted atop the palace. The Nawabs, after the takeover by the British had no actual power and after merging with India too, they had yielded power, as the Government of India took over control of all the areas that merged with India. Furthermore, with the promulgation of the Indian Constitution on 26 January 1950, the Dominion of India was transformed into the Republic of India, and the Article 18 of the Indian Constitution (which {{is a part of the}} Right to Equality, a fundamental right in India), titles were abolished. The Article prevents the state from confirming any title except those titles given by the Government <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> made their mark in military and academic fields. Such titles and awards include the Bharat Ratna, the Padma Shri and the Padma Vibhushan (the Supreme Court of India, on 15 December 1995, upheld the validity of such awards). Thus, with the promulgation of the Constitution, the title of the Nawab Bahadur of Murshidabad was abolished. And although, the Nawab Waris Ali Meerza held titles such as Raes ud-Daulah, they were not officially or legally recognised.|$|E
