5|$|Morales had {{not taken}} {{a leading role in}} these protests, but did use them to get across his message that the MAS was not a single-issue party, and that rather <b>than</b> <b>simply</b> {{fighting}} for the rights of the cocalero it was arguing for structural change to the political system and a redefinition of citizenship in Bolivia.|$|E
5|$|The American {{historian}} Gary Clayton Anderson of the University of Oklahoma published Sitting Bull and the Paradox of Lakota Nationhood (2010), a revisionist {{examination of}} the Lakota medicine man. Anderson stresses the Little Big Horn in light of past successes of the Lakota Nation and the merits of Sitting Bull himself, rather <b>than</b> <b>simply</b> a mishap by Custer.|$|E
5|$|The {{first day}} at Gettysburg, more {{significant}} <b>than</b> <b>simply</b> a prelude to the bloody second and third days, ranks as the 23rd biggest battle of the war by number of troops engaged. About one quarter of Meade's army (22,000 men) and one third of Lee's army (27,000) were engaged.|$|E

5|$|There {{are also}} {{paintings}} on {{the north and south}} walls depicting the Camoys family. Camoys was the lord of the manor and it appears he had the church built primarily for his family. This would explain the unusual detail in the paintings. They were intended as rich decoration rather <b>than</b> <b>simply</b> for educating an illiterate congregation.|$|E
5|$|With {{the release}} of their 1990 debut LP, No Depression, the Belleville, IL, trio Uncle Tupelo {{launched}} more <b>than</b> <b>simply</b> their own career—by fusing the simplicity and honesty of country music with the bracing fury of punk, they kick-started a revolution which reverberated throughout the American underground.|$|E

5|$|He {{had been}} {{influenced}} by Marxist frameworks for analysing society, for instance in developing the belief that British colonialism had to be destroyed rather <b>than</b> <b>simply</b> reformed. However, he disagreed with the Marxist attitude that tribalism was backward and retrograde; his positive attitude toward tribal society frustrated some of Kenyatta's Marxist Pan-Africanist friends in Britain, among them Padmore, James, and Ras T. Makonnen, who regarded it as parochial and un-progressive. He appears to have had no further involvement with the communist movement after 1934.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Vargas Llosa wrote The Bad Girl (Travesuras de la niña mala), which {{journalist}} Kathryn Harrison argues is a rewrite (rather <b>than</b> <b>simply</b> a recycling) of Gustave Flaubert's Madame Bovary (1856). In Vargas Llosa's version, {{the plot}} relates the decades-long obsession of its narrator, a Peruvian expatriate in Paris, {{with a woman}} with whom he first fell in love when both were teenagers.|$|E
5|$|In the off-season, Ottawa's {{president}} Llewellyn Bate {{proposed to}} suspend the team's operations {{until the end of}} the war. Gate receipts had declined 17 per cent. The other NHA owners refused {{to suspend the}} league. Rather <b>than</b> <b>simply</b> cease operations, Bate and the other directors of the team turned it over to Ted Dey, owner of the Arena. Dey cut player salaries and let players go, including Art Ross to the Wanderers. Dey also fired manager Alf Smith, saving on his $750 salary.|$|E

5|$|Life's Shop Window was {{the first}} film produced, rather <b>than</b> <b>simply</b> distributed, by William Fox's Box Office Attractions Company, the {{corporate}} predecessor to Fox Film. Several reviewers approved of the film's expurgated treatment of the novel's plot, although opinions {{of the quality of}} the film itself were mixed. It proved very popular upon its initial release in New York, and that success was used to advertise the film elsewhere. Like many of Fox's early works, it was likely lost in the 1937 Fox vault fire.|$|E
5|$|Rather <b>than</b> <b>simply</b> {{quell the}} mutiny however, Germanicus rallied the mutineers {{and led them}} on a short {{campaign}} across the Rhine into Germanic territory, stating that whatever treasure they could grab would count as their bonus. Germanicus's forces crossed the Rhine and quickly occupied all of the territory between the Rhine and the Elbe. Additionally, Tacitus records the capture of the Teutoburg forest and the reclaiming of Roman standards lost years before by Publius Quinctilius Varus, when three Roman legions and its auxiliary cohorts had been ambushed by Germanic tribes.|$|E
5|$|The Wreck {{experienced}} a major transition of ownership after the Centennial Celebration. Since Reck Club had financially maintained {{the vehicle for}} so long and Reck Club fell under the Dean of Students rather than the Athletic Association, the vehicle was sold from the Athletic Association to the Institute for zero dollars in 1987. The transaction further solidified Reck Club's responsibilities over the car but also made the car more <b>than</b> <b>simply</b> a football mascot. The Old Ford was officially an Institute icon.|$|E

5|$|The other {{significant}} {{difference is that}} the Lutheran calendar commemorates a wider variety of individuals than does either of its counterparts. Included on the calendar are musicians and artists who are associated with the Church, but are not typically thought of as “saints” in the classical sense. The intent is to provide a wider venue for commemoration of outstanding individuals who have served the Church through their vocations rather <b>than</b> <b>simply</b> commemorating the outstanding among the religious.|$|E
5|$|You {{have more}} to do <b>than</b> <b>simply</b> abstain from riotous proceedings. You must not stand behind riots and let violators of the law promote the {{destruction}} of property. You are responsible for the violence that has been done, whether you were actually engaged in it or not. You on your part must drive away from you the evil-disposed people who have done so much harm, and discountenance in the plainest way everything tending to violence.|$|E
5|$|Dialogue {{heard in}} the dream {{sequence}} uses a distinctive reversed manner of speech. This was achieved by recording the actors' line phonetically reversed, and playing this audio backwards. David Lynch had begun experimenting with the technique in 1971, and had originally planned {{to use it in}} his 1977 debut feature, Eraserhead, before it finally found use in this episode. Describing the process of learning his lines backwards, Anderson notes that he first worked out the phonemes of each word rather <b>than</b> <b>simply</b> reading it back to front, and disregarded the inflection of any given word as this helped bolster the discordant effect of the end result. The reversed audio was also altered with a slight reverb effect. The actors were required to perform their movements backwards, as elements of the scene would be reversed entirely.|$|E
50|$|A concept search can {{overcome}} these challenges by employing {{word sense disambiguation}} (WSD), and other techniques, to help it derive the actual meanings of the words, and their underlying concepts, rather <b>than</b> by <b>simply</b> matching character strings like keyword search technologies.|$|R

50|$|In March 1980, the multiple-key reboot concept {{had been}} {{introduced}} for the Apple II by Videx in its VideoTerm display card add-on, requiring Control-Reset, rather <b>than</b> just <b>simply</b> Reset, to reboot the machine. The innovation was noted and well received at the time.|$|R
5|$|During the Han Dynasty, silk became {{progressively}} more valuable {{in its own}} right, and became more <b>than</b> <b>simply</b> a material. It was used to pay government officials and compensate citizens who were particularly worthy. By the same token that one would sometimes estimate the price of products according to a certain weight of gold, {{the length of the}} silk cloth became a monetary standard in China (in addition to bronze coins). The wealth that silk brought to China stirred envy in neighboring peoples. Beginning in the 2nd century BCE, the Xiongnu regularly pillaged the provinces of the Han Chinese for around 250 years. Silk was a common offering by the emperor to these tribes in exchange for peace.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} war strategy, Lincoln {{articulated}} two priorities: {{to ensure that}} Washington was well-defended, and to conduct an aggressive war effort that would satisfy the demand in the North for prompt, decisive victory; major Northern newspaper editors expected victory within 90 days. Twice a week, Lincoln would meet with his cabinet in the afternoon, and occasionally Mary Lincoln would force {{him to take a}} carriage ride because she was concerned he was working too hard. Lincoln learned from reading the theoretical book of his chief of staff General Henry Halleck, a disciple of the European strategist Jomini; he began to appreciate the critical need to control strategic points, such as the Mississippi River. Lincoln saw the importance of Vicksburg and understood the necessity of defeating the enemy's army, rather <b>than</b> <b>simply</b> capturing territory.|$|E
5|$|The Audubon Naturalist Society also {{actively}} opposed such spraying programs, and recruited Carson to {{help make}} public the government's exact spraying practices and the related research. Carson began the four-year project of what would become Silent Spring by gathering examples of environmental damage attributed to DDT. She also attempted to enlist others to join the cause: essayist E. B. White, {{and a number of}} journalists and scientists. By 1958, Carson had arranged a book deal, with plans to co-write with Newsweek science journalist Edwin Diamond. However, when The New Yorker commissioned a long and well-paid article on the topic from Carson, she began considering writing more <b>than</b> <b>simply</b> the introduction and conclusion as planned; soon it was a solo project. (Diamond would later write one of the harshest critiques of Silent Spring).|$|E
