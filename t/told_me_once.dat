2500|$|In June 1949, Hardwick {{died of a}} {{heart attack}} while clamming at Church's Beach on Cuttyhunk Island off the coast of Massachusetts. [...] A friend {{reported}} that Hardwick suddenly toppled into the water as they walked along the shore. [...] Shortly after Hardwick's death, sports columnist Grantland Rice wrote a column about Hardwick in which he observed:"Tack Hardwick has been a close friend of mine for 35 years. [...] Of all the college football players I've ever known since 1900, I would say he was top man in the matter of flaming spirit. [...] He loved football with an intensity beyond belief. [...] Tack was a great halfback and a great end. [...] But above all, as a real tribute, he was a greater blocker and a greater tackler. [...] He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>once</b> that he would rather block or tackle than carry the ball to a touchdown. … If football had a weakness for Hardwick it was that the game was not quite rough enough." ...|$|E
2500|$|Working with Bing Crosby {{proved to}} be {{problematic}} from the start. Between scenes he barely interacted with leading lady Joan Fontaine, on loan from RKO Radio Pictures, who later recalled, [...] "Crosby wasn't very courteous to me ... There was never the usual costar rapport. I was a star at that time, but he treated me like he'd never heard of me." [...] The singer tended to ignore his director as well. According to Fontaine, [...] "It wasn't that he had anything against Mr. Wilder. He just didn't {{pay much attention to}} him. He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>once</b> that he had some trouble understanding his funny accent." [...] Worst of all, Crosby tended to alter his dialogue, saying it [...] "as he felt it at the moment," [...] and Wilder was known for insisting his lines be delivered exactly as written. [...] "Bing Crosby operated for himself, not for the group or the film," [...] Wilder recalled. [...] "He was a big star, the biggest, and he thought he knew what was good for him." ...|$|E

2500|$|Wolfe has {{an aversion}} to {{physical}} contact, even shaking hands. Early in the first novel Archie explains why there is a gong under his bed that will ring upon any intrusion into or near Wolfe's own bedroom: [...] "Wolfe <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>once</b> ... that he really had no cowardice in him, he only had an intense distaste for being touched by anyone …" [...] When Jerome Berin, creator of saucisse minuit, repeatedly taps Wolfe on the knee, Archie grins at [...] "Wolfe, who didn't like being touched, concealing his squirm {{for the sake of}} sausages." [...] In Prisoner's Base, Wolfe speaks coldly as he tells the DA and Inspector Cramer that the despised Lieutenant Rowcliff [...] "put a hand on me. ... I will not have a hand put on me, gentlemen. I like no man's hand on me, and one such as Mr. Rowcliff's, unmerited, I will not have." [...] Wolfe's prejudices make it all the more surprising when, in [...] "Cordially Invited to Meet Death", Archie finds Wolfe in the kitchen with a woman who has solved the problem of preparing corned beef: [...] "Standing beside him, closer to him than I had ever seen any woman or girl of any age tolerated, with her hand slipped between his arm and his bulk, was Maryella." ...|$|E
2500|$|David Cantwell {{recalled}} in 2013, [...] "His approach to singing, he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>once,</b> {{was to call}} up those memories and feelings of his own that most closely corresponded to those being felt by the character in whatever song he was performing. He {{was a kind of}} singing method actor, creating an illusion of the real." [...] In the liner notes to Essential George Jones: The Spirit of Country Rich Kienzle states, [...] "Jones sings of people and stories that are achingly human. He can turn a ballad into a catharsis by wringing every possible emotion from it, making it a primal, strangled cry of anguish". [...] In 1994, country music historian Colin Escott pronounced, [...] "Contemporary country music is virtually founded on reverence for George Jones. Walk through a room of country singers and conduct a quick poll, George nearly always tops it." [...] In the wake of Jones's death, Merle Haggard pronounced in Rolling Stone, [...] "His voice was like a Stradivarius violin: [...] one of the greatest instruments ever made." [...] Emmylou Harris wrote, [...] "...when you hear George Jones sing, you are hearing a man who takes a song and makes it a work of art - always," [...] a quote that appeared on the sleeve of Jones' 1976 album The Battle. In the documentary Same Ole Me, several country music stars offer similar thoughts. Johnny Cash: [...] "When people ask me who my favorite country singer is, I say, 'You mean besides George Jones?'"; [...] Randy Travis: [...] "It sounds like he's lived every minute of every word that he sings and there's very few people who can do that"; Tom T. Hall: [...] "It was always Jones who got the message across just right"; and Roy Acuff: [...] "I'd give anything if I could sing like George Jones". [...] In the same film, producer Billy Sherrill states, [...] "All I did was change the instrumentation around him. [...] I don't think he's changed at all." ...|$|E
