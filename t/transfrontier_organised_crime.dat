40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} relationship between some features of the American criminal justice system and the infiltration of <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> groups into New York's financial district to commit securities fraud. The primary focus {{of the study is}} to determine if and to what extent the present criminal justice strategies designed to counter <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> activities have {{had an impact on the}} entry of New York's five Italian-American crime families and Russian-origin criminals into the securities market. There are scattered works and articles on <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> related frauds in the stock market, but there is no thorough empirical study on the movement of <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> groups from traditional rackets into the securities market in New York.

40|$|This study {{addresses}} transnational <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> and illicit {{financial flows}} in Nigeria, West Africa and the Global North (i. e. Europe). Based on extensive documentary analysis and expert interviews conducted in the four countries (i. e. Nigeria, Ghana, Senegal and the Gambia). It reveals the contemporary changes of <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> in a global context. Having outlined the dynamics of global transnational <b>organised</b> <b>crime,</b> the study examines three specific <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> groups in Nigeria. These are; human trafficking; drug trafficking and advance fee fraud (AFF) cybercrime related. Having considered the phenomenon of <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> and its contemporary problems in Nigeria, the study turns to {{an evaluation of the}} regime against money laundering from a global perspective. It assesses some relevant global initiatives and instruments which combat the proceeds of <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> in West Africa and Nigeria. The study introduces the conceptual frameworks using the rational choice theory to ‘frame’ <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> offenders from Nigeria and the author uses Value, Accessability and Transaction (VAT) Model to explain the routine activities of the rational criminal actors from Nigeria before considering the anti-money laundering framework (i. e. the Financial Action Task Force 40 Recommendations) as the instruments to decrease the risk of <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> financial transactions within the global jurisdictions. The exploration of cybernetics in this study offers a scientific model called AntiMoney Laundering Transaction Validation Model with aim of providing a solution which strengthens the effectiveness of the anti-money laundering (AML, hereinafter) regimes in Nigeria, developing economies and globally. Finally, the thesis concludes that those international initiatives, recommendations and the instruments of soft-laws from developed countries to combat the {{illicit financial flows}} of <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> in developing economies cannot be effective without providing solutions to the impediments affecting the curbing of illicit financial flows from <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> in developing countries, such as Nigeria...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the end of}} the Cold War; wide spread political, economic, {{social and}} {{technological}} changes have enabled organised criminal groups to develop transnational activities. Encouraged by the United States, the world has conceived transnational <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> as a 'new' and serious security threat. The international community has acknowledged the inherent incapability of national strategies, alone, to combat transnational <b>organised</b> <b>crime.</b> Therefore, concerted efforts have been taken to develop a global and uniformed response. Efforts to combat transnational <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> have been underpinned by a perceived necessity to protect national borders. This reaction is based on traditional, inaccurate, conceptions of <b>organised</b> <b>crime,</b> which focuses on structured, ethnically defined 'outsider' groups as a serious threat to security and the very fabric of society. This concept of <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> is overly simplistic and fails to grasp the complexity of modern <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> and its interaction with legal and illegal markets. <b>Organise</b> <b>crime</b> is a multifaceted phenomenon, characterised by loose networks of criminals, who are primarily motivated by profit and operate based on particular 'opportunities'. Strategies to combat <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> have been preoccupied with traditional, repressive, criminal justice measures; at the expense of developing a comprehensive understanding of the root problems that allow illicit markets and <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> to flourish, in communities and society in general. It is essential that the international community, through the United Nations, realistically assess the effectiveness of its current approach, to aid the development of comprehensive strategies for the future. New Zealand has taken promising steps to combat transnational <b>organised</b> <b>crime.</b> Although in its infancy, NZ has developed a comprehensive strategy which not only utilises traditional criminal justice tools, but also seeks to engage with communities to develop effective prevention measures...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a high-level evaluation of <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> and the threats arising from online <b>organised</b> <b>crime,</b> within a multi-disciplinary perspective. It draws {{on a range}} of academic, industry and other materials to distinguish the key characteristics of online <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> and to identify some of the multi-disciplinary resources which are available to counter it. Real-life case studies and other examples, together with the Tables in the Appendices, are used to demonstrate how contemporary online <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> is profit-driven and has a strong commercial focus. The paper is accompanied by a series of Appendices and Glossaries and a comprehensive Reference list (provided within a separate document to facilitate crossreferencing with this paper) that includes suggestions for further reading and research. Section Three begins by demonstrating how there are many possible approaches which can be taken towards <b>organised</b> <b>crime,</b> which may at first appear confusing, contradictory or overwhelming. It mentions that law enforcement is adopting a multidisciplinary approach and working in partnership with other sectors, including the business sector, to counter the problem. Next, the paper attempts to separate the ‘fact from the fiction’ of <b>organised</b> <b>crime,</b> highlighting the pitfalls of relying on any single source (for instance, media reports or statistics) when analysing the subject. It identifies reliable sources for information about <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> (for instance, the United Nations Convention on Transnational <b>Organised</b> <b>Crime</b> and several established, academic sources) and aggregates some of the key <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> characteristics from the sources within Tables 1 to 6 in Appendix A. Having established that, despite initial impressions, it is possible to obtain a consensus view about theoretical <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> characteristics within carefully-defined parameters, the project aligns the theoretical criteria against real-life online <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> case studies. This establishes that, although there are many similarities between terrestrial and online <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> groups (OOCGs), the online groups also display characteristics which are unique to them, for instance a high dependence {{on the use of the}} Internet and transnational strategies. With regard to online involvement by ‘traditional’ <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> groups such as the Mafia, the paper highlights that, although there is some indication in both the theoretical literature and the case studies that traditional <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> groups are targeting the Internet, the evidence in the case studies suggests that involvement of traditional <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> groups is not a dominant feature at the moment. In Section Four, the paper assumes a non-technical IS perspective and describes some of the vulnerable elements within information technology, especially within the structures of the Internet and the Web, which all offenders, including OOCGs, are exploiting. It explains some of the reasons why these vulnerabilities exist and why they are attractive to offenders. In particular, it highlights the serious threat which crimeware, which is often sold and distributed by OOCGs, poses to the Web environment. In Section Five, the paper shifts to a business perspective, emphasising the importance of understanding online <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> business models and mentioning the work of particular authors whose work in this field adopts a multi-disciplinary approach. The paper then uses Morphological Analysis (MA) to demonstrate how a multidisciplinary approach to strategic analysis can utilise the skills and experience of IS/business professionals, as well as assisting them to manage the threat which OOCGs may pose to their business. The paper concludes with the observation from academic and industry sources that directly targeting the profit-making aspects of an online <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> business may be one of the most effective responses to the problem...|$|R
