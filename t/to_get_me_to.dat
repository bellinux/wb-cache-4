500|$|In 1982, {{an investigative}} {{reporter}} named Gary Moore from the St. Petersburg Times drove from the Tampa area to Cedar Key looking for a story. When he commented to a local on the [...] "gloomy atmosphere" [...] of Cedar Key, and questioned why a Southern town was all-white when {{at the start of}} the 20th century it had been nearly half black, the local woman replied, [...] "I know what you're digging for. You're trying <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> talk about that massacre." [...] Moore was hooked. He was able to convince Arnett Doctor to join him on a visit to the site, which he did without telling his mother. Moore addressed the disappearance of the incident from written or spoken history: [...] "After a week of sensation, the weeks of January 1923 seem to have dropped completely from Florida's consciousness, like some unmentionable skeleton in the family closet".|$|E
500|$|Though Townsend {{was proud}} {{of what he had}} {{accomplished}} so early in his career, he was discouraged by his experience with the music industry. [...] "I was becoming a product of somebody else's imagination, and it was mixing with my own personality," [...] he later reflected. [...] "This combination was appalling." [...] He pushed to get his own projects off the ground. Despite getting notable touring gigs with other musicians, however, Townsend continued to face rejection of his own music. Relativity Records dropped Noisescapes from their label shortly after Townsend accepted Vai's offer, seeing no commercial appeal in Townsend's music. [...] "I have a hunch they only offered me a deal <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> sing with Steve," [...] he mused. While touring with the Wildhearts, Townsend {{received a phone call from}} an A representative for Roadrunner Records, expressing an interest in his demos and an intention to sign him. The offer was ultimately rescinded by the head of Roadrunner, who regarded Townsend's recordings as [...] "just noise".|$|E
2500|$|... when I {{was living}} in England, I was putting the young women in a frenzy with my songs. I was often forced {{to stay at the}} house on Sunday {{afternoon}} because there were so many of them coming after me. And I was serving them all on the same plate. When I would be writing a song to one, she would be reading it to her comrades and they would be all striving to get acquaintance with me, and <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do a song for themselves until they were bothering my head." ...|$|E

2500|$|Suárez {{began dating}} Sofía Balbi at age 15 in Montevideo; the Balbi {{family moved to}} Barcelona in 2003, and Suárez's focus on {{football}} strengthened as a result as he wanted to follow them to Europe to join Sofía again. Suárez married her in 2009, and the couple have a daughter and a son. On 11 July 2014, Suárez joined FC Barcelona, allowing him to live closer with his wife Sofía's family. On the move, Suárez said, [...] " [...] did all they could <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> stay, but playing and living in Spain, where my wife's family live, is a lifelong dream and ambition. I believe now the timing is right." ...|$|E
2500|$|Walter Pincus, a Washington Post columnist, has {{reported}} that he was told in confidence by an unnamed Bush administration official on July 12, 2003, two days before Novak's column appeared, that [...] "the White House had not paid attention to former Ambassador Joseph Wilson's CIA-sponsored February 2002 trip to Niger because it was set up as a boondoggle by his wife, {{an analyst with the}} agency working on weapons of mass destruction." [...] Because he did not believe it to be true, Pincus claims, he did not report the story in The Washington Post until October 12, 2003: [...] "I wrote my October story because I did not think the person who spoke to me was committing a criminal act, but only practicing damage control by trying <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> stop writing about Wilson. Because of that article, The Washington Post and I received subpoenas last summer from Patrick J. Fitzgerald." ...|$|E
2500|$|... “I’m pretty surprised, I didn’t {{expect to}} {{actually}} podium. I thought top five {{would be a}} really good ride for me. Jim Miller (USA Cycling vice president of athletics) and I met before and I really wanted Jim in the car talking to me {{because he was in}} the car at Nationals with me when I won. I just buried myself in the last 500 meters. I {{knew it was going to}} hurt, but it hurts for everyone. With 100 meters to go I wanted to quit, but I did one more click down on my gears and I just counted the pedal strokes <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> the finish. This hurt worse than I’ve ever hurt before." [...] She also felt sorry for Evelyn Stevens who missed a place on the podium by 0.04 seconds. [...] "It's a very bittersweet feeling for me. Evelyn is a good friend, a teammate and a fellow countryman. We've spent a lot of time together this season and it's hard to have been beaten and have it be so close".|$|E

2500|$|Novak {{received}} an Alumni Achievement Award from the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign in 1997. Novak frequently visited {{his alma mater}} and interacted with students, establishing a scholarship in his name to support English and rhetoric majors in 1992. He spoke at the college’s May 1998 commencement, urging graduates to use their education as a [...] "bulwark against tyranny." [...] Novak {{also served as a}} Radford Visiting Professor of Journalism for Baylor University in 1987. He was the 2001 winner of the National Press Club’s 'Fourth Estate Award' for lifetime achievement in journalism as well. Novak appears in the 2008 award-winning documentary on political strategist Lee Atwater, [...] In the film, Novak says [...] "He tried <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> write about Governor Dukakis having psychiatric problems but it really was a slander. He thought my weakness was that if I could get an exclusive story, I would jump at it, bite at it and not be as careful as I should be. That may be true, but I was careful enough not to get involved in that one." ...|$|E
2500|$|Volpe sought {{re-appointment}} {{as chair}} of the Natural Resources committee in 2001, but did not receive the position. [...] He became increasingly critical of the Chrétien government during the next two years, and made no secret of his support for Paul Martin to replace Chrétien as party leader. [...] Volpe criticized the Chrétien government for moving too slowly to replace Canada's aging Sea King helicopters, and encouraged the government to purchase the EH-101 Cormorant helicopters recommended by the previous Progressive Conservative government of Brian Mulroney. [...] In November 2002, he called for the government to provide compensation for all victims of Hepatitis C who were infected through the national blood supply system, and criticized the Chrétien government's more restrictive settlement. [...] He also expressed skepticism about the Chrétien government's plans to decriminalize cannabis, saying [...] "I believe it's a gateway drug. [...] It's going to be a pretty convincing argument <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> vote for it." [...] He was an opponent of the government's plans to legalize same-sex marriage during this period, and voted to retain the traditional definition of marriage in 2003.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{commentators}} {{have said that}} the harassment associated with Gamergate springs from this existing well of deep-seated misogyny, and that it was merely brought to the fore by the anonymity of the Internet. Regarding the false allegations against Quinn, Amanda Marcotte in an article for The Daily Beast accused the video game world of being [...] "thick with misogynists who are aching to swarm" [...] with hate on any [...] "random woman held up for them to hate, no matter what the pretext". She related these attacks to harassment sent to a woman who criticized a Teen Titans cover and to a community manager of the Mighty No. 9 game because she drew a feminine Mega Man, and virtual rapes committed against women's player avatars in Grand Theft Auto V and DayZ. In an interview with the BBC, Quinn stated that [...] "Before [...] had a name, it was nothing but trying <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> kill myself, trying to get people to hurt me, going after my family. ... There is no mention of ethics in journalism at all outside of making the same accusation everybody makes towards any successful woman; that clearly she got to where she is because she had sex with someone." [...] Danielle Citron of the University of Maryland wrote that the intent of this type of harassment is to demean the victim, make them doubt their own integrity, and to redefine the victim's identity in order to [...] "fundamentally distort who she is".|$|E

And I find myself up against a lot of men, subtle men, sharp men, obstinate men, prejudiced men, able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> round <b>me,</b> able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> over <b>me,</b> able <b>to</b> blockade <b>me....</b> Clever men--yes, {{and all of them}} ultimately damned--oh! utterly damned--fools.
