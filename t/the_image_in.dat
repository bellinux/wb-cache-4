5|$|The Mahamnuni {{image and}} its precincts {{suffered}} damage from fires in 1879 and 1884. In {{the fire that}} broke out {{during the reign of}} King Thibaw, the seven-tiered spire on the brick temple, devotional halls, causeways and others were burnt down, although the Great Image itself was saved. Gold recovered after the fire was made into a robe that currently adorns <b>the</b> <b>image.</b> <b>In</b> 1887, Minister Kinwun Mingyi U Kaung took charge of the site and in 1896 constructed the present temple around the original shrine built by King Bodawpaya.|$|E
5|$|The {{material}} of the Philomela myth {{has been used}} in various creative works—artistic and literary—for the past 2,500 years.

5|$|Another legend narrated in the Arakanese chronicle {{relates to}} the nine {{phenomena}} that occurred when the image was consecrated in the temple and continued to occur after the Buddha had departed. These nine phenomena were: holy water used for washing the image would not overflow the collecting vessels; {{the water from the}} tank that was used for washing the Buddha's head would retain its quality throughout the year; six coloured rays appeared when the devotees worshipped <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>in</b> the evenings; the rays faded in the presence of non-believers; the space in the temple would automatically accommodate any number of devotees; the leaves of trees would tilt {{in the direction of the}} Buddha image; birds would not fly over the temple; and the stone guardians at the entrance would sense the presence of evil doers and prevent them from entering the temple.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, {{two giant}} murals of Evita were {{unveiled}} {{on the building}} facades of the current Ministry of Social Development, located on 9 de Julio Avenue. The works were painted by Argentine artist Alejandro Marmo. On 26 July 2012, to commemorate the sixtieth anniversary of Evita's death, notes were issued in a value of 100 pesos. The controversial effigy of Julio Argentino Roca was replaced by that of Eva Duarte, making her the first actual woman to be featured on the currency of Argentina. <b>The</b> <b>image</b> <b>in</b> the notes {{is based on a}} 1952 design, whose sketch was found in the Mint, made by the engraver Sergio Pilosio with artist Roger Pfund.

40|$|Abstract — A wavelet based multiresolution fuzzy {{clustering}} {{of digital}} images is described. We have applied wavelet transforms to decompose <b>the</b> <b>images</b> into different subbands in multiple resolutions, thereby eliminating noise in each low frequency subband. Then a partitive fuzzy clustering technique is proposed {{to be applied}} in multiple resolutions of <b>the</b> transformed <b>image,</b> <b>in</b> order to find coarser to finer clustering of <b>the</b> <b>images</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> database. <b>The</b> relevance of the proposed multiresolution technique to clustering and retrieval of <b>images</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> compressed domain is also highlighted. A combination of texture, shape, topology and fuzzy geometric features, that is invariant to orientation, scale and object deformation, are extracted from the low frequency subbands of <b>the</b> transformed <b>image</b> <b>in</b> coarser to finer resolutions. Partitive fuzzy clustering is performed, to group these images according to similarity {{at different levels of}} resolution. We use clustering validity indices to determine the optimal number of <b>image</b> categories. <b>The</b> <b>images</b> <b>in</b> each cluster are graded based on their distances from the corresponding centroid. The use of wavelet transform eliminates the need for any other preprocessing for noise removal, to make it amenable for feature extraction. The extracted features serve as the signature of <b>the</b> <b>images,</b> <b>in</b> terms of their content. Their use <b>in</b> content based <b>image</b> retrieval i...|$|R

5|$|The Jokhang {{was founded}} {{during the reign}} of King Songtsen Gampo. According to tradition, the temple was built for the king's two brides: Princess Wencheng of the Chinese Tang dynasty and Princess Bhrikuti of Nepal. Both are said to have brought {{important}} Buddhist statues and images from China and Nepal to Tibet, which were housed here, as part of their dowries. The oldest part of the temple was built in 652. Over the next 900 years, the temple was enlarged several times with the last renovation done in 1610 by the Fifth Dalai Lama. Following the death of Gampo, <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>in</b> Ramcho Lake temple was moved to the Jokhang temple for security reasons. When King Tresang Detsan ruled from 755 to 797, the Buddha image of the Jokhang temple was hidden, as the king's minister was hostile to the spread of Buddhism in Tibet. During the late ninth and early tenth centuries, the Jokhang and Ramoche temples were said to have been used as stables. In 1049 Atisha, a renowned teacher of Buddhism from Bengal taught in Jokhang.|$|E
5|$|The most {{prominent}} temple of Varaha is the Sri Varahaswami Temple in Tirumala, Andhra Pradesh. It {{is located on}} the shores of a temple pond, called the Swami Pushkarini, in Tirumala, near Tirupati; {{to the north of the}} Tirumala Venkateswara Temple (another temple of Vishnu in the form of Venkateswara). The region is called Adi-Varaha Kshestra, the abode of Varaha. The legend of the place is as follows: at the end of Satya Yuga (the first in the cycle of four aeons; the present one is the fourth aeon), devotees of Varaha requested him to stay on earth, so Varaha ordered his mount Garuda to bring his divine garden Kridachala from his abode Vaikuntha to Venkata hills, Tirumala. Venkateswara is described as having taken the permission of Varaha to reside in these hills, where his chief temple, Tirumala Venkateswara Temple, stands. Hence, pilgrims are prescribed to worship Varaha first and then Venkateswara. In the Atri Samhita (Samurtarchanadhikara), Varaha is described to be worshipped in three forms here: Adi Varaha, Pralaya Varaha and Yajna Varaha. <b>The</b> <b>image</b> <b>in</b> the sanctum is of Adi Varaha.|$|E

Based on this observation, we present the similarities of all <b>the</b> <b>images</b> <b>in</b> a graph structure, and find the largest densest component of the graph, corresponding to the largest set of most similar subset of images.
