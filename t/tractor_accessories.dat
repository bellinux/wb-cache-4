40|$|The Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo Agricultural Mechanics Project Show is {{the largest}} show of it kind in Texas, and perhaps {{the largest in the}} nation. This extracurricular {{activity}} provides students and agricultural education programs an opportunity to display skills developed in agricultural mechanics laboratories by exhibiting projects constructed entirely by students. Projects such as gooseneck trailers, bulk feeders, cattle chutes, truck bumpers, and <b>tractor</b> <b>accessories</b> are designed, constructed and exhibited. It is perhaps the most comprehensive opportunity for authentic assessment in agricultural education. The primary method of data collection for this descriptive study was a survey completed and collected during the 2003 Project Show. Results of the study revealed that an overwhelming percentage of students in the activity were white males. Surprisingly over one-third indicated the FFA was the only extracurricular activity in which they participated. Regarding safety, more than 90 % indicated they had taken a safety exam and received instruction in topics such as fire, ear/hearing, tool, chemical, greenhouse, and eye safety. Unfortunately, just over three-fourths had learned about electrical safety, and even lower percentages had received instruction on electrical and equipment safety. More than two out of five students indicated they were not required to wear eye protection in the agricultural mechanics laboratory, and almost four out of five were not required to wear ear/hearing protection...|$|E

5000|$|Between 1990 and 2000, {{changing}} {{economic circumstances}} led to {{significant changes in}} production. A long-term co-operation was established with the Perkins company, and the first engines complying to the EU 2000/25/EC standards were built in 2005. In 2008, the Serbian Privatisation Agency launched a tender process {{for the sale of}} IMT. [...] In 2012, IMT introduced a new [...] "S" [...] series of tractors. Offer of the new generation of tractors together with purchasing power demanded customisation of <b>tractor</b> <b>accessory.</b> Mostly new models have join of traditional and modern look, thanks to the Belgrade professional schools, Faculties of Design and IMT design studio.|$|R
25|$|ABC {{promoted}} {{and sold}} the program as prime family entertainment. Sponsors included the American Chicle Co., Rolaids, Anacin (1956), Williamson-Dickie (195760), Massey Ferguson (195860), Arrid, Postum (1958), Carter's Little Pills and Sargent's Dog Care Products (1960); and was sold nationally by Ted Bates & Company. Joe Slattery handled station breaks and some commercials, often appearing during Jubilee USA with Massey Ferguson farm <b>tractors</b> and <b>accessories</b> in film clips or on stage.|$|R
50|$|Since 1949 Nanchang {{has been}} {{extensively}} industrialized. It is now a large-scale producer of cotton textiles and cotton yarn. Paper making is also a major industry, as is food processing (especially rice milling). Heavy industry began to gain prominence in the mid-1950s. A large thermal-power plant was installed and uses coal brought by rail from Fengcheng to the south. A machinery industry also grew up, at first mainly concentrating on the production of agricultural equipment and diesel engines. Nanchang then became a minor centre of the automotive industry in China, producing trucks and <b>tractors</b> and also <b>accessories</b> such as tires. An iron-smelting plant helping to supply local industry was installed in the later 1950s. There is also a large chemical industry, producing agricultural chemicals and insecticides as well as pharmaceuticals.|$|R
