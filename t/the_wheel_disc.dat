40|$|Decarburisation {{is present}} on all new rails and unless ground off, {{will be on}} the running surface once installed. This paper {{presents}} a detailed investigation into the effect of decarburisation of rolling contact fatigue and wear. Twin disc testing has been used to study the phenomenon under water-lubricated rolling/sliding contact. Rail discs have been cut from grade 220 rail and heat-treated to give samples with varying depths of decarburisation. It was found that as the depth of decarburisation increased the wear rate of the rail disc increased while that of <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>disc</b> decreased. The effect of decarburisation on rolling contact fatigue was to increase the crack growth rate of samples with increasing depth. Cracks under rolling contact fatigue were propagated by contact stresses via the fluid pressure mechanism and influenced by microstructure. The effect of decarburisation was predicted to have little effect on rail/wheel contact when scaled from the laboratory tests using the depth of maximum shear stress...|$|E

Plank and Kuhn criterion is used to decide whether crack will either kink and follow mode I controlled (tensile mode) path, or it will propagate coplanar mode II controlled (shear mode). If mode I controlled crack growth is more probable then a direction of crack propagation is predicted using the maximum tensile stress range criterion. In this way a relationship between stress intensity factors and crack geometry is obtained. For comparison, crack behaviour in a solid railway wheel which is not subjected to pre-stress loading is also analysed.

40|$|White etching layer (WEL) is {{a surface}} {{metallurgical}} feature that is commonly present on rail {{when it is}} in service. An investigation of its behaviour under rolling sliding conditions has been conducted within the laboratory using twin disc testing. This has focussed on the rolling contact fatigue behaviour of the rail with the wear of both discs also being discussed. White etching layer has been simulated by spot welding, which creates a patch of martensite by heat treatment, and also by severe plastic deformation of the rail disc. This paper details the numerical results found from the crack growth and wear behaviour of the samples, while the accompanying paper describes the crack morphology. The results show that crack growth is dependant on the subsurface deformation of the pearlite, with longer cracks present for samples with a WEL than for those samples without, for {{the same number of}} cycles.

40|$|Purpose. Taking {{into account}} the traffic safety {{priority}} on the railway transport the search of factors promoting increase of derailment stability coefficient is an actual task. Purpose of {{the paper is the}} influence researches of the high-frequency vibrations on the train traffic safety parameter. In this case the special form of the wheel rim, at which its rigidity changes according to the harmonious law, was considered as a source of vibrations. Methodology. For the analysis of the vibration influence on the change of friction coefficient values the methods of so called vibrational mechanics were used. For determination of vibration amplitudes through moving the wheel flange points the finite-elements method was also used in the paper. Findings. During calculations it was established that the derailment stability coefficient to a great extent depends on the friction coefficient between wheel and rail. The paper shows that the friction coefficient in turn is influenced by the high-frequency vibrations. The form of the wheel rim was considered as a vibration source and the parameters characterizing vibration were calculated. It was given the quantitative estimation of the friction coefficient change under the vibration influence. It was also scientifically based the high-frequency vibration influence on the derailment stability coefficient. Originality. The paper proved the possibility of high-frequency vibration influence on the derailment stability coefficient.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{deliverable}} is {{an improved}} model for the influence of vehicle conditions on the loading and subsequent deterioration of rails. In particular, this report focuses on: 1. 	Wear data from SUROS twin-disc tests with CORUS 260 and premium grade pearlitic rail steels (CORUS 400, VA 350 and VA 400), and metallurgical analysis (micro-hardness and shear strain measurement) of section disc samples. 2. 	The effect of wheel hardness on rail wear rate, and vice versa: findings from the academic literature, and observations from InnoTrack SP 4 SUROS twin-disc tests. 3. Development, calibration and validation of Newcastle University’s wear and crack initiation model (dynarat, a. k. a. the ‘brick’ model) : a. development of material models {{for each of the}} tested rail steels; b. calibration of the wear model against the results of the CORUS 260 dry tests; and c. validation of the wear model against the results for the premium grade steels. 4. 	Wear modelling (using the calibrated wear model) of wheel-rail contact on top of the rail head, focussing on the effects of load and traction; develop a method for quickly estimating wear. 5. 	The effect of out-of-round (OOR) wheels on wear and crack initiation. Wear-Hardness Correlation Four pearlitic rail steels were tested against VAS R 7 wheel steel. Three twin-disc tests were performed for each rail steel: 5000 cycles dry; 5000 cycles dry followed by 5000 cycles wet (i. e., water-lubricated); and 15000 cycles dry. In general, the harder the rail disc material becomes at the surface, the harder <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>disc</b> material becomes at the surface. Rail disc wear decreases when rail steel hardness increases. In wet tests, wheel disc wear rate drops as rail disc hardness increases. In the system as a whole (i. e., considering both wheel and rail discs), using harder CORUS 400 and VA 400 rail steels lowers the total wear rate. From a review of the academic literature, there is no conclusive finding that harder rails wear wheels more, or vice versa. In general, harder materials wear less, but material hardness is not the only determining factor of wear performance; microstructure and strain-hardening behaviour are critical factors, and rolling contact fatigue performance is equally important. However, as a fairly general rule: →	To reduce system wear, harder steel grades should be used for both wheel and rail. Wear Model Development, Calibration and Validation The mixed (dry-wet) SUROS tests caused severe rolling contact fatigue, affecting hardness readings and wear rates, but the dry tests have provided an excellent resource for wear model development and calibration. Test specimens have been sectioned and analysed. Microhardness measurements have suggested a possible softening effect at very small strains, and a new strain-hardening equation is used to fit to the strain-hardness data {{for each of the four}} steels. Wear model calibration has led to a number of core developments to the model itself. The wear rate predictions for the premium grade rail steels match measured values (approximately) for the 5000 cycles dry tests, but over-predict the wear rate for the 15000 cycles dry tests by a factor of 2 - 3. (The dry-wet test predictions do not match, but are not expected to, since the ratcheting wear model does not account for major surface deterioration caused by significant surface cracking.) → Following major development, the wear model has been calibrated successfully for CORUS 260 rail steel under dry contact conditions. →	The wear model has been partly validated for the premium grades. Additional test work and metallurgical analysis should lead to improved material hardening models. Effect of Vehicle Characteristics: Rail Wear Predictions The wear model, calibrated for CORUS 260 and dry contact, was used to study the effect on rail wear of vehicle characteristics through their effect on the wheel-rail contact. The patch was assumed to be elliptical and the pressure distribution to be Hertzian; in addition, the contact was assumed to be on the top the rail, suitable for straight track, not curves, and the traction to be longitudinal only. Traction coefficient has a significant effect on the wear rate. For distributed traction systems the traction coefficient may often be about 0. 1, i. e., an average wear rate of about 0. 75 nm/cycle. For locomotives the traction coefficient may be 0. 3 or even higher, i. e., an average wear rate of 1. 5 nm/cycle or more. →	There was a very clear linear trend of wear rate against peak contact pressure (for the range of pressures studied). → Wear equations, giving wear rate for a given pressure and traction coefficient, have been extrapolated which can be used for quick estimation of rail wear. Out-of-Round Wheels The effect of pressure variation (with wavelengths above about 20 mm) on rail wear rate was studied by considering each wheel pass as an independent event. Wear simulations were thus performed by varying the normal load with each passing wheel, and the predictions compared with the constant average-load case. No significant difference was observed. →	Out-of-round pressure variations do not affect rail wear significantly. The effect of periodic variation of wheel-rail contact patch pressure on propagation of semi-circular cracks up to 12 mm radius (i. e., penetrating to a depth of about 6 mm at 30 °angle to the surface) was studied using the ‘ 2. 5 D’ Green’s-function-based model. The following conclusions were reached: → For pressure variations with a wavelength less than about 2 mm, the maximum pressure should be used to calculate crack growth rate. →	For pressure variations with a wavelength greater than about 20 mm, there is no advantage to modelling pressure variation within a single load pass, and that modelling successive wheel passes with different static pressures would be sufficient. → Out-of-round wheels with roughness features between these two wavelengths would accelerate crack propagation, but would require more detailed modelling. Rail crack growth and rail breaks For an analysis of long crack growth and rail breaks numerical simulations validated and calibrated towards full-scale field tests featuring flatted wheels have been employed. The main conclusions from the simulations were the detrimental influence of rail temperature and low ballast stiffness (where hanging sleeper(s) is an extreme case. The influences of the most important parameters have been quantified. The results are presented in Annexes 4, 5 and 6 and summarized in Section 6. 2. The main conclusions and operational recommendations are: →	Critical crack sizes (i. e., crack sizes for which fracture is likely) for rail head and foot cracks depend significantly on the temperature (or rather the temperature below the stress free temperature). For cold conditions, critical crack sizes of roughly 1 and 3 cm are found for rail foot and rail head cracks respectively. → Crack growth rates are significantly increased close to fracture. Consequently, operationally allowed crack sizes need to be much smaller. Exactly how much smaller depends on the accuracy of inspections (i. e., how small cracks can with certainty be detected) and inspection intervals. To guide in this decision, crack growths evaluated for different operational conditions and presented in Annex 6 can be employed. →	A decrease in the assured largest crack size after an inspection (i. e., the size of a crack that with full certainty can be found at an inspection) will have a major influence on the needed length of the inspection intervals. →	Low ballast stiffness will normally lead to higher rail bending moments. To avoid this influence the ballast stiffness per half sleeper should be kept above some 30 MN/m. Hanging sleepers will remove the beneficial effect of high ballast stiffness and should be avoided. In particular this seems to be the case for high-speed operations (200 km/h in the current study). →	It is recommended to combine the mitigation of a hanging sleeper with an inspection for rail head and rail foot cracks. →	The temperature will have a very significant effect on both crack growth rates and risk of final fracture. To this end it is recommended that the magnitude of allowed wheel–rail impact forces be related to the temperature. Further, inspection intervals need to be significantly reduced during cold periods. Guidance in defining alarm limits and inspection intervals can be obtained from the results presented in Annex 6. →	Due to the significant increase in crack growth rates in cold climate, it is recommended that there is an inspection before a cold period to minimize the occurrence of larger cracks that may propagate to fracture. →	The wheel–rail impact force will have an effect on the risk of fracture. To establish alarm limits is a balance between allowed forces and allowed crack sizes. Due to this, a higher alarm limit can be allowed if shorter crack sizes are assured (e. g., by more frequent inspections). →	It is wise to introduce multiple alarm levels for several reasons: o A wheel that induces a high impact load is likely to cause damage on the vehicle (in the wheel, in the roller bearing, etc.). This may lead to increased costs and operational disturbances. o Also, wheels that induce impact loads below an alarm limit corresponding to rail breaks may cause smaller, arrested cracks to start growing. In particular, this is likely to be an issue for rail head cracks where a higher load may cause a crack to deviate transversally, which eventually may lead to a rail break. o The introduction of low-level alarms is likely to give the maintenance organisation improved possibilities of planning and optimising maintenance procedures. If only a one-level alarm exists there is an obvious risk that a vehicle that just passes the limit may fail in a subsequent control where operational conditions are slightly different. This will, obviously, result in unnecessary costs and operational disturbances. o For the same reason as outlined above, it is recommended that the low-level alarm limit is gradually decreased over a period before the introduction of “cold climate” alarm limits...|$|E

40|$|This work {{studies the}} effect of desert sand at the wheel-rail contact {{interface}} on two standard railway wheel steels (ER 8 and CLASS C) and two upgraded steels (SANDLOS® S and SANDLOS® H) specifically designed for sandy environments. Rolling contact tests were carried out {{by means of a}} two-disc testing machine with and without sanding at the contact interface. The tests were performed for various durations in order to study the disc damage evolution. The response of the steels to the same contact pressure, rolling speed, sliding/rolling ratio and sand feed rate was evaluated in terms of wear rate, strain hardening and surface and subsurface damage. The ER 8 discs performed worst, incorporating sand into the subsurface layer by extremely high plastic flow and were, therefore, subject to material detachment by rolling contact fatigue. The SANDLOS® H discs performed best, with a wear rate 2. 5 times lower than that of ER 8 discs, due to the steel having the highest mechanical properties, and thereby restricting the sand embedding mechanism to a thin surface layer. The sanding increased the wear rate of <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>discs</b> by a factor which varies from 1. 4 for SANDLOS® H discs to 2. 2 for ER 8 and CLASS C discs. The damage mechanisms were qualitatively studied by finite element simulations, which recognised two different layers for the plastic strain.

40|$|INTRODUCTION In 1838 peat-cutters found a {{one-piece}} <b>disc</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>the</b> very clumsiness {{of which}} roused the curiosity of journalists and authorities, {{so that it}} was saved from destruction. Eventually the wel 1 known Leiden antiquarian L. J. F. Janssen (1848, pp. 94 - 97) examined and commented upon this wheel. Its close resemblance to what was known of the tympana of the Roman plaustra, coupled with a fallacious chain of tempting arguments, led him to the misconception that this wheel (and a second one of different type) was of Roman origin. Once labelled they were labelled forever; and in so far as they were not thought to represent giant lids or even table tops (Pleyte, 1882, p. p), these <b>wheels</b> and <b>the</b> more recent comparable finds continued to be considered of Roman origin. It was only in 1955, when still another <b>wheel</b> of <b>the</b> Same type turned up in direct connection with a Neolithic trackway at Nieuw-Dordrecht (then under excavation), that Dr. W. van Zeist {{came to the conclusion that}} at least this wheel was to be considered of Neolithic origin. Even so, it remained questionable whether al 1 wheels of this type were of Neolithic age, or whether these spanned a much longer period. Since 1955 five more one-piece <b>disc</b> <b>wheels</b> have been found in the peat. On the basis of the palynological evidence (dealt with by Mrs. M. R. van der Spoel-Walvius in a recent paper, 1964) and C 14 measurements, <b>the</b> <b>wheels</b> al 1 proved to be contemporary with <b>the</b> Nieuw-Dordrecht <b>wheel.</b> This was inducement enough to study the. whole group of one-piece oak <b>disc</b> <b>wheels</b> found in <b>the</b> Northern Provinces of the Netherlands, and to collect as much information on these finds as possible. We now know that a total of ten finds, comprising in al 1 thirteen one-piece <b>disc</b> <b>wheels</b> of <b>the</b> Same type, have been recovered from the peat deposits of the provinces of Groningen, Drenthe and Overijssel; of these ten finds, six could be dated, with the help of C 14 measurements and pollen analysis, to the end of the third millennium R. C. No comparable finds are known from other regions in the Netherlands. This study deals with the origin, dating, and implications of <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> finds. Some later bi- and tripartite <b>disc</b> <b>wheel</b> finds are also discussed, notably those from the excavations at Ezinge in the years 1924 - 1934 (very kindly made available for publication by their excavator, Prof. Dr. A. E. van Giffen). In an introductory section, a brief survey is given of the present state of knowledge concerning the Neolithic cultures met with in the northern provinces of the Netherlands, to serve as a background for the discussion. The paper concludes with a complete catalogue of Dutch <b>disc</b> <b>wheel</b> finds. <b>The</b> historiography of <b>wheeled</b> traction sprang from the study of the representational art and the treatises of the ancients. As early as 1817, J. C. Ginzroth(1 nspector of Wagon-building to the King of Bavaria) published his magnificent work Die Wagen und Fahrwerke der Griechen und Römer und anderer alten Völker. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>disc</b> <b>wheel</b> became known from ancient art, and even such problems as <b>wheels</b> turning with <b>the</b> axles or on the axles were discussed, long before <b>the</b> first actual <b>disc</b> <b>wheel</b> find was recorded. In fact, the finds from Gasselterboerveen and Valthe, registered by L. J. F. Janssen in 1848, might wel 1 be the first authentic prehistoric <b>disc</b> <b>wheels</b> to enter scientific literature. The lack of actual finds must have been responsible for the often theoretical character of the discussions, which centred, for instance, on the question as to the invention of <b>the</b> <b>wheel.</b> Was <b>the</b> cart developed out of the sledge, which eventually might have been used with rollers underneath to carry stones (as Ginzroth had suggested), or was the vehicle invented in ritual context, and had spindle whorls been the prototypes for <b>the</b> <b>wheel?</b> Mötefindt (1918) gives a survey of the different opinions on this point, but he als 0 presents a classification of disc and early spoked wheels based on a realistic discussion of the available evidence, still largely derived from classica 1 sources. In the last half century, the multiplication of finds of actual remains and models of prehistoric wheels and vehicles has pushed the problems of theoretical character into the background; the centre of invention of <b>wheeled</b> vehicles and <b>the</b> history of their diffusion became the main points of interest. These problems have been specially dear to Childe, whose studies on the subject are of primary importance (1951, 1954, 1955). The most recent publication is by I. Bóna (1960), who, in a searching study, takes int 0 account new finds from Southeastern and Eastern Europe and their implications. Thus, at the outset of our discussion, the following synoptic picture can be drawn. <b>The</b> solid <b>disc</b> <b>wheel</b> can be traced back as far as the Uruk period (late 4 th millennium B. C.) in Mesopotamia, where script signs on pictographic tablets represent both sledges and vehicles which are identical to these sledges but for <b>the</b> <b>wheels</b> that are added underneath. From the early 3 rd millennium onward, wheeled vehicles (both wagons and carts) appear in the Royal tombs of Southern Mesopotamia serving as hearses (at Kish, Susa, Khafaje, and Ur) and in the representational art. <b>The</b> <b>wheels</b> present themselves already as compound plankbuilt discs with separate naves and tyres. By the beginning of the 3 rd millennium models of carts, wagons and wheels occur in Assyria (Tepe Gawra VIII) and Turkmenia (Anau I 11 and Shah Tepe ILI), demonstrating the rapid spread of wheeled traction. Still in the first half of the 3 rd millennium, model <b>disc</b> <b>wheels</b> make their appearance in some of the settlements of the Kuro-Araxes Culture in the Southern Caucasus and Eastern Asia Minor. <b>The</b> first <b>disc</b> <b>wheel</b> and wagon models of the Danubian area are hardly to be dated later. In the second half of the 3 rd millennium, solid <b>disc</b> <b>wheels</b> appear in <b>the</b> South-Russian steppe area, and, far to the East, in the Indus valley. Further afield in temperate Europe, the picture was by no means clear. Of the ambiguous engravings on the slabs of the portholed stone cist at Lohne-Zuschen (Hessen) in Germany, neither the date nor the fact that ox-drawn carts are really represented is agreed upon. The date secured by pollen analysis for a wooden <b>disc</b> <b>wheel</b> found at Beckdorf (Lower Saxony) in Germany at the end of the Neolithic or in the Early Bronze Age was but hesitantly accepted. Only <b>the</b> tripartite <b>disc</b> <b>wheels</b> from <b>the</b> North-Italian lakeside dwellings of Castione and Mercurago and from the Wasserburg Buchau in Southern Germany, datable to the 13 th century and c. 1000 B. C. respectively, gave a firm hold. Thus, it would even have been possible to believe that <b>the</b> spoked <b>wheel</b> had made its appearance in temperate Europe at an earlier date than <b>the</b> <b>disc</b> <b>wheel.</b> <b>The</b> spoked <b>wheel</b> is likely to have originated in connection with the adoption of the horse as a draught animal, when vehicles of lighter construction and greater manoeuvrability, such as war chariots, had to be constructed. Its centre of origin in the Near East, somewhere near the eastern border of Anatolia, is not yet clear, but the date of its first appearance may have been shortly after 2000 B. C. <b>The</b> earliest spoked <b>wheel</b> evidence from continental European soil is furnished by clay models from VëteFov settlements in Moravia and Slovakia, datable about I 500 B. C. (according to Bóna, shortly after 1400 B. C.). The history of spoked wheels in Europe can then be continued down int 0 the Iron Age by a series of models and actual bronze wheels belonging to votive wagons, wheeled cauldrons, wagons serving as hearses on the pyre and by representations of chariots on rock engravings. Thus, <b>the</b> spoked <b>wheel</b> was connected with ritual, burial and warfare. But ordinary transport in Europe probably remained true to <b>disc</b> <b>wheels</b> up to <b>the</b> beginning of. our era, as <b>the</b> <b>disc</b> <b>wheel</b> finds suggest. In the present study, the view is presented that <b>the</b> first <b>disc</b> <b>wheels</b> found their way into Northwestern Europe as an element of a specific group of cultures - the Battle Axe Cultures. The evidence seems to support this conception. It is based, however, on a limited number of chance finds, and future discoveries might conceivably show that <b>the</b> turning <b>wheel</b> was rather propagated by diffusion, independent of cultural barriers.

50|$|SLS (single leading shoe) brakes {{are still}} used for <b>the</b> rear <b>wheel</b> of many motorcycles, and for <b>the</b> front <b>wheel</b> of smaller bikes and scooters. An SLS brake is less {{powerful}} than a TLS, {{but that is}} not an issue for a motorcycle's rear brake. Compared to cars, bikes are higher and have a shorter wheelbase, so weight-transference under braking is much more pronounced. Excessive braking force can cause <b>the</b> rear <b>wheel</b> to lock, so it is normal for a bike's rear brake to be much less powerful than the front. Since 1969, modern motorcycles tend to have disc brake(s) on <b>the</b> front <b>wheel,</b> and sometimes a smaller disc brake on <b>the</b> rear <b>wheel.</b> Before <b>disc</b> brakes became commonplace on bikes, performance machines tended to have twin-leading-shoe drum brakes, and some racing machines even had four-leading shoe drum brakes.|$|R
25|$|Motorcycle {{construction}} is the engineering, manufacturing, and assembly of components and systems for a motorcycle {{which results in}} the performance, cost, and aesthetics desired by the designer. With some exceptions, construction of modern mass-produced motorcycles has standardised on a steel or aluminium frame, telescopic forks holding <b>the</b> front <b>wheel,</b> and <b>disc</b> brakes. Some other body parts, designed for either aesthetic or performance reasons may be added. A petrol powered engine typically consisting of between one and four cylinders (and less commonly, up to eight cylinders) coupled to a manual five- or six-speed sequential transmission drives <b>the</b> swingarm-mounted rear <b>wheel</b> by a chain, driveshaft or belt.|$|R
2500|$|Unlike car {{disc brakes}} that are buried within <b>the</b> <b>wheel,</b> bike <b>disc</b> brakes {{are in the}} {{airstream}} and have optimum cooling. Although cast iron discs have a porous surface which give superior braking performance, such discs rust {{in the rain and}} become unsightly. Accordingly, motorcycle discs are usually stainless steel, drilled, slotted or wavy to disperse rain water. Modern motorcycle discs tend to have a floating design whereby the disc [...] "floats" [...] on bobbins and can move slightly, allowing better disc centering with a fixed caliper. A floating disc also avoids disc warping and reduces heat transfer to <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> hub. Calipers have evolved from simple single-piston units to two-, four- and even six-piston items. Compared to cars, motorcycles have a higher center of mass:wheelbase ratio, so they experience more weight transfer when braking. Front brakes absorb most of the braking forces, while the rear brake serves mainly to balance the motorcycle during braking. Modern sport bikes typically have twin large front discs, with a much smaller single rear disc. Bikes that are particularly fast or heavy may have vented discs.|$|R
