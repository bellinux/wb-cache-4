5|$|By 2 p.m. on 16 July, the rioters {{had left}} Birmingham and were heading towards Kings Norton and the Kingswood Chapel; it was {{estimated}} that one group of the rioters totalled 250 to 300people. <b>They</b> <b>burned</b> Cox's farm at Warstock and looted and attacked the home of a Mr. Taverner. When they reached Kingswood, Warwickshire, <b>they</b> <b>burned</b> the Dissenting chapel and its manse. By this time, Birmingham had shut down—no business was being conducted.|$|E
5|$|The Lenni Lenape tribe was {{the first}} Native American tribe to inhabit {{the area in the}} {{vicinity}} of Darby Creek. They fished, hunted, and used the creek for transportation via canoe. At the time, the area was forested, so <b>they</b> <b>burned</b> clearings in the forest in order to farm and for security purposes.|$|E
5|$|During their {{retreat from}} Quebec, the Americans {{carefully}} took or destroyed all ships on Lake Champlain that might prove {{useful to the}} British. When Arnold and his troops, making up the rear guard of the army, abandoned Fort Saint-Jean, <b>they</b> <b>burned</b> or sank all the boats they could not use, and {{set fire to the}} sawmill and the fort. These actions effectively denied the British any hope of immediately moving onto the lake.|$|E
50|$|The poem {{deals with}} how the dead Sigurd and Brynhildr are burnt on two pyres. First <b>they</b> <b>burn</b> Sigurd and then <b>they</b> <b>burn</b> Brynhildr who is lying on a richly clad wagon. This wagon takes Brynhildr on her journey to the afterlife. During her journey, she passes a house where a giantess (gýgr) lived.|$|R

5|$|Anderson {{left the}} Centralia area on September 27, pursued {{for the first}} time by Union forces {{equipped}} with artillery. Anderson evaded the pursuit, leading his men into ravines that the Union troops would not enter for fear of ambush. In the aftermath of the attacks, Union soldiers committed several revenge killings of Confederate-sympathizing civilians. <b>They</b> <b>burned</b> Rocheport to the ground on October 2; the town was under close scrutiny by Union forces, owing to the number of Confederate sympathizers there, but General Fisk maintained that the fire was accidental. Anderson watched the fire from nearby bluffs.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{fought in}} the Raid on St Malo in June 1758. The British landed near St Malo, at first {{planning}} to attack the town. However, they decided to destroy shipping first and attack the town later. Finding that to occupy the town would require a full siege, for which they had insufficient troops, they occupied St Servan, where <b>they</b> <b>burned</b> over one hundred vessels including thirty privateers. British ships retreated after seeing a large French force, but sailed around the coast {{for a few weeks}} seeking another place to attack. Even though the Raid on St Malo was small and little damage was done, it is considered a British victory.|$|E
5|$|Mason's {{successor}} Horner {{proved to}} be extremely unpopular as governor and his tenure was very short. Residents disliked him so much <b>they</b> <b>burned</b> him in effigy and pelted him with vegetables upon his entry into the territorial capital. In the October 1835 elections, voters approved the draft constitution and elected the popular Mason as state governor. The same election saw Isaac E. Crary chosen as Michigan's first U.S. Representative to Congress. Because of the dispute Congress refused to accept his credentials and seated him as a non-voting delegate. The two U.S. Senators chosen by the state legislature in November, Lucius Lyon and John Norvell, were treated with even less respect, being allowed to sit only as spectators in the Senate gallery.|$|E

5|$|The K Foundation {{was an art}} {{foundation}} set up by Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty (The KLF) in 1993, {{following their}} 'retirement' from the music industry. The Foundation served as an artistic outlet for the duo's post-retirement KLF income. Between 1993 and 1995, they spent this money {{in a number of}} ways, including on a series of Situationist-inspired press adverts and extravagant subversions in the art world, focusing in particular on the Turner Prize. Most notoriously, when their plans to use banknotes as part of a work of art fell through, <b>they</b> <b>burned</b> a million pounds in cash.|$|E
5|$|When the rioters {{arrived at}} John Taylor's other house at Moseley, Moseley Hall, they {{carefully}} moved {{all of the}} furniture and belongings of its current occupant, the frail Dowager Lady Carhampton, a relative of George III, {{out of the house}} before <b>they</b> <b>burned</b> it: they were specifically targeting those who disagreed with the king's policies and who, in not conforming to the Church of England, resisted state control. The homes of George Russell, a Justice of the Peace, Samuel Blyth, one of the ministers of New Meeting, Thomas Lee, and a Mr. Westley all came under attack on the 15th and 16th. The manufacturer, Quaker, and member of the Lunar Society Samuel Galton only saved his own home by bribing the rioters with ale and money.|$|E
5|$|Despite Governor Catts' {{change of}} attitude, white mob action {{frequently}} occurred in towns throughout north and central Florida and went unchecked by local law enforcement. Extrajudicial violence against black residents was so common that it seldom {{was covered by}} newspapers. In 1920, whites removed four black men from jail, who were suspects accused of raping a white woman in Macclenny, and lynched them. In Ocoee the same year, two black citizens armed themselves {{to go to the}} polls during an election. A confrontation ensued and two white election officials were shot, after which a white mob destroyed Ocoee's black community, causing as many as 30 deaths, and destroying 25 homes, two churches, and a Masonic Lodge. Just weeks before the Rosewood massacre, the Perry Race Riot occurred on 14 and 15 December 1922, in which whites burned Charles Wright at the stake and attacked the black community of Perry, Florida after a white schoolteacher was murdered. On the day following Wright's lynching, whites shot and hanged two more black men in Perry; next <b>they</b> <b>burned</b> the town's black school, Masonic lodge, church, amusement hall, and several families' homes.|$|E

5|$|Egyptian naval defences were weak. The Egyptian fleet had {{declined}} from its Umayyad-era peak and was mostly {{employed in the}} Nile {{rather than in the}} Mediterranean. Fortifications along the coastal marshes, which had been manned by volunteer garrisons, had been abandoned in the later 8th century. The Byzantines had exploited this in 811/12 and again in ca. 815 launching raids against the coasts of Egypt. The Byzantine fleet arrived at Damietta on 22 May 853. The city garrison were absent at a feast for the Day of Arafah organized by the governor Anbasah ibn Ishaq al-Dabbi in Fustat. Damietta's inhabitants fled the undefended city, which was plundered for two days and then torched by the Byzantines. The Byzantines carried off some six hundred Arab and Coptic women as well as large quantities of arms and other supplies intended for Crete. The fleet then sailed east and attacked the strong fortress of Ushtun. Upon taking it, <b>they</b> <b>burned</b> the many artillery and siege engines found there before returning home.|$|E
5|$|López de Salcedo moved Trujillo upslope {{from its}} {{previous}} swampy location. In 1528, López de Salcedo {{spent a month}} in the Olancho Valley, which at this time was likely to have been inhabited by Pech. He attempted to bring the inhabitants under his control, spurring them into preparation to resist further Spanish incursions. He hanged several indigenous leaders who taken part in the attack on Natividad de Nuestra Señora, and imposed such harsh obligations upon the natives that <b>they</b> <b>burned</b> their villages and their crops and fled into the mountains. In Olancho, López de Salcedo unsuccessfully clashed with rival Spaniards that he found still there. Unrest among the natives spread widely, from Comayagua to as far south as Nicaragua, causing difficulties in procuring provisions, and presenting constant danger to the expedition. Nevertheless, he continued onwards to León, in Nicaragua. At about this time, Pedrarias was appointed governor of Nicaragua after vigorously protesting his loss of governorship over Castilla del Oro.|$|E
25|$|On 7 May 1778, Viper {{was part}} of a {{squadron}} that accompanied some gallies, barges and troops up the Delaware River from Philadelphia to Trenton. Over a three-day period <b>they</b> <b>burned</b> 44 American vessels and captured a battery of six guns, all without suffering a single casualty. Among the vessels <b>they</b> <b>burned</b> was {{what was left of the}} American frigates Washington and Effingham. Seven of the vessels were privateers, pierced for from 10 to 18 guns.|$|E
