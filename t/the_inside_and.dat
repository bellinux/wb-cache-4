5|$|A {{variety of}} artwork is {{displayed}} on {{the exterior of the}} building. Sculptor Leo Friedlander used Vermont marble for the large relief sculptures {{on both sides of the}} main entrance. One sculpture depicts Meriwether Lewis, William Clark, and Sacagawea, with a map of their expedition's route on the reverse (Lewis and Clark); the other (Covered Wagon) shows pioneers and a covered wagon, with a map of the Oregon Trail on the reverse. Additionally, Ellerhusen created five marble relief sculptures on the exterior, and a metal sculpture by Tom Morandi sits above the south entrance. Ellerhusen also cast six bronze sculptures arranged above the building's main entrance, three on <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> <b>and</b> three on the outside.|$|E
5|$|An {{approximation}} to {{the curve}}-shortening flow can be computed numerically, by approximating the curve as a polygon {{and using the}} finite difference method to calculate the motion of each polygon vertex.

5|$|As a defence {{against the}} cold, {{a colony of}} emperor {{penguins}} forms a compact huddle (also known as the turtle formation) {{ranging in size from}} ten to several hundred birds, with each bird leaning forward on a neighbour. As the wind chill is the least severe {{in the center of the}} colony, all the juveniles are usually huddled there. Those on the outside upwind tend to shuffle slowly around the edge of the formation and add themselves to its leeward edge, producing a slow churning action, and giving each bird a turn on <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> <b>and</b> on the outside.|$|E

5|$|In 1873, {{the arsenal}} was renamed Little Rock Barracks {{and the main}} {{building}} used as married officers' quarters. The building was drastically altered <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> <b>and</b> outside. Prior to renovation, a rear basement door provided the only entrance, while the tower served as a hoist to move munitions between floors. By 1868, front and rear porches had {{been added to the}} building, as well as interior walls and stairs, some of which remain today, including the central staircase. In 1880, Douglas MacArthur was born on the northwest upper floor of this building while his father, U.S. Army Captain Arthur MacArthur, was stationed there.|$|E
5|$|Integrity {{was laid}} down in September 1802 at the newly opened King's Dockyard in the colony of New South Wales. Governor Philip Gidley King ordered that {{construction}} proceed as swiftly as possible, {{in order to test}} the Dockyard's capacity. A team of two shipwrights, two apprentice shipwrights and two sawyers were assigned the task and delivered the finished cutter in thirteen months. During construction shipwright Thomas Moore tested that the hull was watertight by filling it with water from <b>the</b> <b>inside,</b> <b>and</b> repairing any visible leaks. Her hold also incorporated a partition that her crew could move to or away from the forecastle bulkhead to vary her cargo capacity.|$|E
5|$|Ugg boots (sometimes called uggs) in Australia and New Zealand are a unisex {{style of}} {{sheepskin}} boot. In many other countries, however, UGG boots are a well-known brand of footwear owned by Deckers. The boots {{are made of}} twin-faced sheepskin with fleece on <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> <b>and</b> with a tanned outer surface, often with a synthetic sole. The boots originated in Australia and New Zealand, initially as utilitarian footwear worn for warmth and comfort. UGG boots emerged as a fashion trend in the United States in the late 1990s and as a world-wide trend in the late 2000s.|$|E

5|$|Around 1800, Caernarfon's local {{corporation}} {{undertook a}} programme of modernisation work, inserting several new gateways {{in the town}} walls; other changes were also made to the walls during the period, with some towers being converted for use as administrative buildings and the gatehouses altered to accommodate more modern offices. During the 19th century the town of Caernarfon grew considerably, prompted by the slate trade {{and the construction of}} the Chester to Holyhead railway line. As a result of this population pressure, by the 20th century housing had encroached along <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> <b>and</b> outside of the town walls, so that in many places the walls had vanished from view. During the 20th century the walls were gradually acquired by the state and these houses demolished.|$|E
5|$|Giovinazzi quickly caught Marciello and overtook him (with {{the help}} of DRS and drafting) {{at the start of}} lap 18 to take over the lead. Giovinazzi began to pull away from Maricello. The safety car was {{deployed}} for the fourth (and final) time after Nato attempted to pass teammate King around <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> <b>and</b> retired from the race having been squeezed into the turn three barrier by him. The area was cleared of Nato's damaged car over the next five laps which meant the race would finish under a time limit. Giovinazzi accelerated as late as possible to limit the slipstream effect and remained the leader at the lap-25 restart despite locking-up his tyres heading into the first turn. King retired from the race following contact with Eriksson. Giovinazzi remained the leader for the remaining two laps to clinch his first, and his team's maiden, victory in the GP2 Series. Siroktin overtook Rowland for third place and clinched second position from Marciello by drafting behind him on the start/finish straight. Rowland finished in fourth place, ahead of Evans and Matsushita whom he defended from in the final two laps. Gelael, de Jong, Ghiotto, and Malja rounded out the point-scoring positions. Eriksson and King were the last of the classified finishers. The attrition race was high, with ten drivers reaching the end of the race.|$|E
5|$|Instead of {{alerting}} the police, {{the family}} took the silencer to Boutflour's sister's home. Boutflour said it felt sticky. They found red paint and blood on it, {{and the surface}} of it had been damaged. When the police collected the silencer from them on 12 August, {{five days after the}} murders, an officer reportedly noticed an inch-long grey hair attached to it, but this had gone by the time the silencer arrived at the Forensic Science Service at Huntingdon. A scientist at the Forensic Science Laboratory, Mr. Hayward, found blood on <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> <b>and</b> outside surface of the silencer, the latter not enough to permit analysis. The blood inside was found to be the same blood group as Sheila's, although {{it could have been a}} mixture of Nevill's and June's. A firearms expert, a Mr. Fletcher, said the blood was backspatter, caused by a close-contact shooting.|$|E

5|$|The {{accident}} {{began on}} the front straightaway as the field headed into turn one. Wade Cunningham, Wheldon's teammate in the No. 17 Dallara, clipped James Hinchcliffe, driving the No. 06 Dallara, and then made contact with J. R. Hildebrand in the No. 4 Dallara. Then Cunningham swerved and Hildebrand drove over the rear of his car, causing his to go airborne. Cunningham collected Jay Howard in the No. 15 Dallara on <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> <b>and</b> then Townsend Bell in the No. 22 Dallara on the outside before colliding with the retaining wall. Attempting to avoid the crash ahead, Vitor Meira lost control of his No. 14 Dallara and spun inward, collecting both Charlie Kimball's No. 83 Dallara and E. J. Viso's No. 59 Dallara. Tomas Scheckter, in the No. 57 Dallara, was also attempting to avoid the crash by rapidly slowing down on the outside. Following that, Paul Tracy ran {{into the back of}} his car with his No. 8 Motegi Wheels Dallara and Pippa Mann, rapidly approaching in the No. 30 Dallara, went over the top of him after jerking to the outside to avoid crashing into Alex Lloyd in the No. 19 Dallara.|$|E

The arm-tefillin is {{tightened}} with the thumb, the blessing is said, and the strap is immediately wrapped around the upper arm in the opposite direction it came from {{in order to keep the}} knot tight without having to hold it. Some wrap it around the upper arm for less than a full revolution (the bare minimum to keep the knot tight) and then wrap it around the forearm seven times, while others wrap it around the upper arm an additional time before wrapping it around the forearm. Many Ashkenazim wear the knot to be tightened (not to be confused with the knot on the base which is permanently tied and always worn on the inside, facing the heart) on <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> <b>and</b> wrap inward, while Nusach Sephard Ashkenazim and all Sephardim wear it on the outside and wrap outward.|$|E
5|$|The {{lack of an}} heir for Uriel Septim {{has broken}} an old covenant—the barrier to Oblivion: a {{dangerous}} realm that is in another dimension. Multiple gates to Oblivion open, and an invasion of Tamriel begins by magical creatures known as Daedra, killing and destroying anything in their path. Jauffre tells the player {{that the only way}} to close the gates permanently is to find someone of the royal bloodline to retake the throne and relight the Dragonfires—with the Amulet of Kings—in the Imperial City. Fortunately, there is an illegitimate son named Martin, who is a priest in the city of Kvatch. Upon arriving at Kvatch, the player finds that the Daedra have destroyed the city and very few survivors remain. A massive Oblivion Gate is obstructing the main city entrance, and the player must venture through the gate into the Deadlands—one of the planes of Oblivion—in order to close it from <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> <b>and</b> allow access to the city. After closing the gate, the player enters Kvatch and takes it back from the Daedra with the assistance of surviving guardsmen. Fortunately, Martin has survived and the player persuades him to come to Weynon Priory.|$|E

5|$|To {{the west}} of the nave is a small narthex, which is topped by an unusual {{rectangular}} tower. The tower was used either as a bell tower or watchtower, or possibly both. It was accessible via wooden ladders on <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> <b>and</b> the outside. It features four wide vaulted windows in its upper part and a rectangular dome covered with roof tiles. According to art historian Robert G. Ousterhout, the tower of the Church of the Holy Mother of God is the earliest example of a belfry integrated into a church building and arranged above the narthex in Balkan architecture. This design would later establish itself as standard in the Balkans. The construction of an integrated tower has been attributed to either Western European or oriental (Syriac or Armenian) influences.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{years of}} {{self-government}} were difficult and unstable. A majority of ACT residents had opposed self-government {{and had it}} imposed upon them by the federal parliament, and at the first election, 4 of the 17 seats were won by anti-self-government single-issue parties due to a protest vote by disgruntled territorians, {{and a total of}} 8 were won by minor parties and independents. Follett and Labor won only four seats and had to form a minority government, as seven groups were represented in total. Some of the anti-self-government representatives sought to disrupt the territory's legislature from <b>the</b> <b>inside,</b> <b>and</b> a no-confidence motion toppled Labor after only seven months. Trevor Kaine and the Liberals ruled for 18 months before being deposed, and Follett's Labor returned, the third government in 25 months. In 1992, Labor won eight seats, and the minor parties and independents won only three. Stability increased, and in 1995, Kate Carnell became the first elected Liberal chief minister. In 1998 Carnell became the first chief minister to be re-elected. She was regarded as a proactive leader but resigned in 2000 after two independents who had supported her minority government withdrew their support. At the time, she had been embroiled in controversy over the funding of the Canberra Stadium and an accidental fatality caused by the Royal Canberra Hospital implosion. Labor have won the three elections since 2001, and in 2004 formed the first majority government in the territory, but after the 2008 election were forced into minority government with the Greens.|$|E
5|$|The safety {{car came}} back in on lap 32, with Rosberg leading the field at the flying restart, quickly pulling out a two-second {{advantage}} over Hamilton. Sergio Pérez was {{the winner of the}} restart, moving up three places into 11th and moving up another position several laps later. On lap 39, Button moved ahead of Felipe Nasr into seventh position. After keeping the gap at around two seconds for a number of laps, a mistake by Rosberg saw Hamilton close back up to him, allowing him to use the drag reduction system to attempt an overtake manoeuvre. Several drivers decided to change tyres for a second time around lap 50, including Valtteri Bottas on lap 52, while Nico Hülkenberg took his third stop a lap before, serving a five-second time penalty for speeding in the pitlane in the process. On lap 55, Hamilton {{was the first of the}} leading duo to come in for a pitstop, followed by Rosberg a lap later. A quicker stop for Rosberg and a mistake by Hamilton on his lap after pitting saw Rosberg emerge from his stop ahead. Verstappen was in the lead, soon followed closely by the two Mercedes drivers. On lap 58, Räikkönen overtook Ricciardo for fourth place, while Verstappen was staying in the lead with soft compound tyres he fitted on lap 15. He lost the lead to Rosberg however on lap 61, with Hamilton getting past him as well soon after. As the Mercedes duo battled for the race win, several drivers retired in the closing stages of the race, including Hülkenberg and Massa. Räikkönen was closing in to Verstappen in third, while Pascal Wehrlein edged closer to Bottas in tenth place as well. On the last lap, Hamilton attempted to overtake Rosberg into turn two. Hamilton went to the outside but Rosberg turned into the corner late on <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> <b>and</b> both cars touched, damaging Rosberg's front wing and pushing Hamilton off the track. They almost touched again as Hamilton rejoined the track. Hamilton eventually got ahead into turn three as Rosberg nursed his damaged car to the finish line. He was relegated to fourth position as both Verstappen and Räikkönen moved past him over the course of the lap. Further behind, Pérez retired, elevating Wehrlein into the last point-scoring position in tenth.|$|E
