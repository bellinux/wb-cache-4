5|$|Vegetables {{have been}} part of the human diet from time immemorial. Some are staple foods but most are {{accessory}} foodstuffs, adding variety to meals with their unique flavors and at the same time, adding nutrients necessary for health. Some vegetables are perennials but most are annuals and biennials, usually harvested within a year of sowing or planting. Whatever system is used for growing crops, cultivation follows a similar pattern; preparation of the soil by loosening it, removing or burying weeds, and adding organic manures or fertilisers; sowing seeds or planting young plants; tending <b>the</b> <b>crop</b> while it grows to reduce weed competition, control pests, and provide sufficient water; harvesting <b>the</b> <b>crop</b> when it is ready; sorting, storing, and marketing <b>the</b> <b>crop</b> or eating it fresh from the ground.|$|E
5|$|A case {{somewhat}} similar to Batesian mimicry {{is that of}} mimetic weeds, which imitate agricultural crops.

40|$|The {{economic}} exploitation of agricultural resources {{is one of}} the main goals of agricultural policy to achieve sustainable agricultural development. On the other hand, the method of linear programming {{is one of the}} most important mathematical techniques designed to distribute economic resources among alternative uses so as to achieve the optimal use. Accordingly, this study aims at characterizing <b>the</b> <b>cropping</b> patterns that maximizes the net return per feddan, minimizes water requirements and maximizes the net return per water unit for <b>the</b> <b>cropping</b> pattern of <b>the</b> year 2006. To accomplish the study main goals, three linear programming models were applied as a tool for economic planning. The main objectives of these scenarios are maximizing the total net revenues for <b>the</b> <b>cropping</b> pattern calculated, maximizing the total net revenues for <b>the</b> <b>cropping</b> pattern, minimizing water irrigation requirements, and maximizing the total net revenues for <b>the</b> <b>cropping</b> pattern in case of achieving higher self-sufficiency ratios for <b>the</b> major <b>crops.</b> <b>The</b> results of solving the linear programming models for <b>the</b> <b>cropping</b> pattern found out that the optimum combination of crops can be produced according to the third scenario, since it achieves an increase in the total net revenue for <b>the</b> <b>cropping</b> pattern of about 0. 13 %. Moreover, it saves about 4. 28 % of the water irrigation, as well as achieving greater return per unit of water resources of about 4, 61 % as compared to those achieved by <b>the</b> <b>cropping</b> pattern of <b>the</b> year 2006 in addition to achieving suitable self-sufficiency ratios of most major crops...|$|R
50|$|Soil defertilisation is done {{by growing}} {{specific}} cover crops (e.g., Phacelia, Sinapis alba, Lolium multiflorum) on them and then, instead of ploughing them under, removing them from the soil.

The risings on <b>the</b> <b>crop</b> of the female may have covered glands that produced <b>the</b> <b>crop</b> milk.

50|$|Roughly, <b>the</b> <b>cropped</b> area {{occupies}} 30% of {{the land}} each season, while 70% is left fallow. <b>The</b> winter <b>crops</b> are mainly wheat and barley, while <b>the</b> summer <b>crops</b> are cotton and melons.

5|$|The {{digestive}} system of beetles is primarily adapted for a herbivorous diet. Digestion takes place {{mostly in the}} anterior midgut, although in predatory groups like the Carabidae, most digestion occurs in <b>the</b> <b>crop</b> by means of midgut enzymes. In the Elateridae, the larvae are liquid feeders that extraorally digest their food by secreting enzymes. The alimentary canal basically consists of a short, narrow pharynx, a widened expansion, <b>the</b> <b>crop,</b> and a poorly developed gizzard. This {{is followed by the}} midgut, that varies in dimensions between species, with a large amount of cecum, and the hindgut, with varying lengths. There are typically four to six Malpighian tubules.|$|E
5|$|The onion {{plant has}} {{a fan of}} hollow, bluish-green leaves and its bulb {{at the base of}} the plant begins to swell when a certain day-length is reached. The bulbs are {{composed}} of shortened, compressed, underground stems surrounded by fleshy modified scale (leaves) that envelop a central bud at the tip of the stem. In the autumn (or in spring, in the case of overwintering onions), the foliage dies down and the outer layers of the bulb become dry and brittle. <b>The</b> <b>crop</b> is harvested and dried and the onions are ready for use or storage. <b>The</b> <b>crop</b> is prone to attack by a number of pests and diseases, particularly the onion fly, the onion eelworm, and various fungi cause rotting.

5|$|Bowman v. Monsanto Co., 569 U.S. ___ (2013) was a United States Supreme Court patent {{decision}} {{in which the}} Court unanimously affirmed {{the decision of the}} Federal Circuit that the patent exhaustion doctrine does not permit a farmer to plant and grow saved, patented seeds without the patent owner's permission. The case arose after Vernon Hugh Bowman, an Indiana farmer, bought transgenic soybean crop seeds from a local grain elevator for his second crop of the season. Monsanto originally sold the seed from which these soybeans were grown to farmers under a limited use license that prohibited the farmer-buyer from using the seeds for more than a single season or from saving any seed produced from <b>the</b> <b>crop</b> for replanting. The farmers sold their soybean crops (also seeds) to the local grain elevator, from which Bowman then bought them. After Bowman replanted <b>the</b> <b>crop</b> seeds for his second harvest, Monsanto filed a lawsuit claiming that he infringed on their patents by replanting soybeans without a license. In response, Bowman argued that Monsanto's claims were barred under the doctrine of patent exhaustion, because all future generations of soybeans were embodied in the first generation that was originally sold.|$|E
