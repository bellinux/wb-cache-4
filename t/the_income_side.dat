50|$|Social {{protection}} measures {{to ensure that}} piped water remains affordable can be broadly classified into income support measures and tariff-related measures. Income support measures address the individual customer’s ability to pay from <b>the</b> <b>income</b> <b>side</b> (through income assistance, water services vouchers, tariff rebates and discounts, bill re-phasing and easier payment plans, arrears forgiveness). An example of income assistance to poor users is the subsidy system applied in Chile. Tariff-related measures keep the size of water bills low for certain groups (e.g. refinement of increasing-block tariffs, tariff choice, tariff capping). Examples of increasing block tariffs with a price of zero in the first block are found in Flanders and South Africa. Another measure is the cross-subsidization using different tariffs for different neighborhoods, as practiced in Colombia. A similar approach has been used {{at the national level}} in Portugal. The Portuguese economic water regulator carried out an affordability study that found out that 10.5% of the population paid more than 3% of their income for water and wastewater services. As a result, the regulator showed flexibility concerning tariff increases and tariff solutions in municipalities where affordability was a particular issue.|$|E

40|$|Like most {{macroeconomic}} variables, real {{gross domestic}} product is subject to measurement error. Because the U. S.

S. output on <b>the</b> <b>income</b> <b>side</b> of the national accounts. 3 Conceptually, GDP on the expenditure side should equal GDP on <b>the</b> <b>income</b> <b>side,</b> and there should be no choice to make between the two series. As a practical matter, however, the two measures can differ by a significant amount because each measure is constructed using “largely independent ” source data, which themselves are “less than perfect ” [BEA (2014) ]. Since November 2013, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s Real-Time Data Research Center has been publishing GDPplus, a new measure of U.

Based on the work of Aruoba, Diebold, Nalewaik, Schorfheide, and Song (2013, henceforth ADNSS), GDPplus represents an appealing complement to the BEA’s official estimates because it combines information in those estimates in a statistically optimal manner.

Our {{results show that the}} current account deficits had an income convergence effect in the area, more specifically they contributed to a higher economic growth in the countries with lower levels of initial GDP per capita. As a consequence, compliance with the indicative thresholds established by the European Commission through the Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure – according to which the current account balances should be maintained within the range (- 4 % GDP, + 6 % GDP) – would be equivalent to a maximum value of the convergence parameter of - 1. 833. However, exceeding the lower limit of the interval (of - 4 % GDP), through the increase in the current account deficits, would lead to gains on <b>the</b> <b>income</b> convergence <b>side</b> within <b>the</b> European Union.
