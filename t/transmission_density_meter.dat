The PTG material was coated onto the PET film and then exposed by UV-meter. Effects {{of the amount}} of TiO 2 and PHZ on the image properties were investigated by means of ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV) and <b>transmission</b> <b>density</b> <b>meter.</b> The formation of silver image was confirmed from the absorption peak around 430 nm and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. The results show that the optimum content is that PHZ of 0. 5 g and titanium dioxide of 0. 03 g. The Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) showed that the triangle-like grains with size of 43 nm and height of 10 nm grew uniformly {{on the surface of the}} exposed PTG film...|$|E

Final analysis of the influence by temperature and pressure on the vibration frequency shows that the influence by pressure is very little which can be omitted, but the influence by temperature is remarkable and needs to be compensated.
