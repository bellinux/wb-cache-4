5|$|Alright, {{the main}} titles. Why the change? As you'll see here, the {{previous}} titles {{were such a}} high school aesthetic.

And in season one when we first did the titles, the network was very clear on wanting to sell it as a high school show rather than a noir show. But once we went <b>to</b> <b>college</b> <b>and</b> had a chance to redo the titles I wanted it to feel noir. For the new theme song, Thomas asked The Dandy Warhols to commission a remix of their original track, which Thomas reported enjoying upon first listening.|$|E
