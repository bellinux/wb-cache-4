This paper presents the applicability of air and spaceborne earth observation data in the estimation of planimetric and elevation changes of the Barnes ice cap, located on Baffin Island, Nunavut in Northern Canada. Historic aerial photography, Landsat 7 imagery, NASA airborne LiDAR data and ICESat satellite LiDAR data were used to generate time series data consisting of orthoimages, DEM and <b>terrain</b> <b>profiles.</b> Indicative planimetric changes of the boundary edge of the ice cap were determined at sampled locations based on the available 1958 aerial ortho-images and the 2000 - 2002 Landsat 7 satellite ortho-image. These preliminary {{results indicate that the}} ice cap edge has retreated with an average rate of about 3 - 15 m/yr during for the last 40 years. The elevation changes of the ice cap were estimated at the <b>terrain</b> <b>profiles</b> of the ICESat and NASA LiDAR elevation points, respectively using as reference 1958 photogrammetrically and contour generated DEMs. The comparison of the temporal <b>terrain</b> <b>profiles</b> indicates that the ice cap elevations have been lowered mostly at the sides of the ice cap and at the lower elevations, where the dropping average rate of the ice elevations is reaching approximately the 1 m/yr during the last 40 years.

Ground-based modeling process results in a detailed model of the building facades.

The flat and hilly terrains were examined in administrative borders of fourteen provinces. It was not reference data for mountainous terrains. For the analysis of accuracy of the SRTM model 332 <b>terrain</b> <b>profiles</b> and 29, 308 points have been measured. The accuracy of SRTM model presented by RMSE was computed on the basic of the height differences between profiles and models homolog points. The analyses have been done in Modular GIS Environment Intergraph software. The absolute accuracy of SRTM model on Polish area RMSE Z = 2. 9 m for flat regions and RMSE Z = 5. 4 m for hilly regions were achieved. It was affirmed that this accuracy is depend on the resolution of grid points of DEM and terrain inclination. The statistic estimation showed systematic shift between SRTM data and reference profiles.
