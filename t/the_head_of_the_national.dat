25|$|There were {{fears that}} the plane's {{tracking}} equipment and emergency locator beacon could have been damaged after the crash or weakened by interference, and that this would hamper the search. <b>The</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>National</b> Search and Rescue Agency told the Associated Press that he believed the aircraft was probably lost at sea. From 5 January 2007, {{the main focus of}} the search was relocated to areas south of Manado, after Manado's Sam Ratulangi Airport reported detecting a signal from the plane a day before. However, the rugged terrain coupled with thick and low hanging clouds continued to hamper the search efforts, and three relatives of missing passengers who overflew part of the area on a military reconnaissance plane admitted that the chances of finding the plane were slim. Officials said that it was unlikely any bodies had survived in one piece. On 14 January, at Indonesia's request, Singapore sent four towed underwater locator beacon detectors, sometimes called Towed Pinger Locators, and six consultants in their use to aid in the search. These would successfully locate the black boxes. On 24 January, the British ship MN Endeavour joined the search. The ship is operated by local mining firm PT Gema Tera Mustikawati and is usually used by oil and gas drilling companies to map the seabed. By 24 January, the Indonesian government had spent an average of Rp 1 billion (about US$110,000) a day on the search.|$|E
