40|$|To {{decrease}} auto use {{and encourage}} public transit usage, transit-oriented {{development has been}} growing in importance. However, a few existing {{studies have examined the}} travel modes to <b>transit</b> <b>stations.</b> This research addresses this gap of knowledge by examining multi-level factors, including socio-demographic factors of individuals, socioeconomic characteristics, built environment attributes, and safety factors influencing walking to <b>transit</b> <b>stations</b> in the city of Los Angeles, California. This study primarily relies on travel survey data from the Post-Census Regional Household Travel Survey conducted from 2001 to 2003 by the Southern California Association of Governments. In the first phase, this research uses bivariate linear regression models to examine the disparities of the built environment across the station areas. The results indicate that the street light density and sidewalk completeness are lower in neighborhoods with higher percentages of Blacks or Hispanics. The density of tree coverage is higher in neighborhoods with higher median household income. The second phase of this study employs four binary logistic regression models to predict the odds of walking to <b>transit</b> <b>stations.</b> The results indicate that the distance to <b>transit</b> <b>stations</b> and the availability of transit parking have significant negative impacts on the likelihood of walking to <b>transit</b> <b>stations.</b> Pedestrian amenities, such as street lights, tree shade, and sidewalk completeness increase the odds of walking to stations. Land use mixture is a positive factor for predicting walking to <b>transit</b> <b>stations.</b> The greater diversity of land uses increase the chances of walking to <b>transit</b> <b>stations.</b> In summary, for promotion of walking to <b>transit</b> <b>stations,</b> this study suggests the strategies, such as increasing sidewalk completeness, street light density, street tree density, and land use mixture. Decreasing the parking lots around stations would discourage driving to stations. Meanwhile, more public attention is necessary to improve the pedestrian facilities in the minority or poor neighborhoods...|$|R

The {{decision}} to build the station was made in 1998, and it opened in 1999, replacing the former station Vestgrensa, and allowed interchange between the metro and the tramway. The Ullevål Hageby Line was at the same time extended to serve the new Rikshospitalet. Forskningsparken is served by lines 3, 4 and 6 of the metro, each operating every 15minutes and providing services along both the Sognsvann Line and the Ring Line.

5|$|Storo {{is a mixed}} {{residential}} and commercial area. It has traditionally been easily accessible by car due to being located along Ring 3, a major highway. The shopping center Storo Storsenter is located just beside the station. Following {{the opening of the}} rapid <b>transit</b> <b>station,</b> a new housing complex was built {{on the west side of}} the station, on a former freight yard owned by the Norwegian State Railways. The first stage with 260 apartments was finished in 2006; when finished, it will feature 900 apartments. The area, named Stasjonsbyen ("the Station City") was developed by ROM Eiendom. Ridership at Storo increased from 2,060 per day to 3,630 per day from 2003 to 2007.|$|E

5|$|By 1994, {{the tram}} {{route to the}} new {{hospital}} appeared to have political support, but by 1996 local politicians instead wanted to use Gaustad Station and buses to serve the hospital. There also arose a disagreement between {{the city and the}} state as to who should be paying for the light rail line, should it should be built. Not until 1998 were the necessary political agreements in place to allow construction to start. The new light rail started services on 1 June 1999, and the rapid <b>transit</b> <b>station</b> opened on 22 August. With the opening, line 4 was extended from Blindern, via Forskningsarken, to Ullevål stadion. There were complaints from local residents that the increased traffic on the line was causing too much noise, and neighbors demanded that noise shields be built. On 20 August 2003, the Ring Line of the metro opened, and line 4 started to also serve Nydalen and Storo.|$|E
5|$|Far Rockaway is {{notably the}} oldest station {{currently}} in {{operation in the}} New York City Subway, having originally opened over 145 years ago, on July 29, 1869, as a Long Island Rail Road station. However, Gates Avenue on the BMT Jamaica Line in Brooklyn is the oldest station in the subway system to have been built as a rapid <b>transit</b> <b>station,</b> {{and has been in}} continuous operation for over 130 years. The Far Rockaway station was converted from Long Island Rail Road trackage to subway loading gauge and has only operated for 57 years in this capacity. Therefore, Far Rockaway is actually the fifteenth newest station in the subway system (behind Grand Street; Harlem–148th Street; 57th Street; the three Archer Avenue Line stations; the three IND 63rd Street Line stations; the new South Ferry station; 34th Street–Hudson Yards; and the three Second Avenue Subway stations).|$|E
5|$|Following the 1991 {{decision}} {{to build a}} new Rikshospitalet at Gaustad, it was decided to extend the Ullevål Hageby Line of the tramway there, which would pass under the Sognsvann Line. Plans called for a transfer station at Blindern, but this was later discarded in favor of a new station, Forskningsparken. It would replace Vestgrensa, which was considered too far away to be a suitable transfer point. Forskningsparken would also serve {{the northern part of the}} Blindern campus. Not until 1998 were the necessary political agreements in place to allow construction to start. The new light rail started services on 1 June 1999, and the rapid <b>transit</b> <b>station</b> opened on 22 August.

5|$|On June 11, 2008, the CTA {{board was}} {{scheduled}} to hear the city's plan of a three-phase bailout {{of the construction of}} the rapid <b>transit</b> <b>station</b> under block 37. The plan included $20million in additional tax increment financing. This comes on top of an extra $60–70million in excess of its budgeted amount that the CTA has been forces to expend. The building developer, Joseph Freed & Associates, has agreed to accept $19million of cost overruns. This round of assistance only covers costs that have been incurred to date. No further funds have been committed and the station's development is being halted until such funds arise. The original budget was $213million ($173 from CTA) and costs to date have been $320million. As of last year the costs were $150million over budget and the city is seeking private investment. Construction finally began on the third building, the hotel and residences in the end of 2009.|$|E
