5|$|Although {{geographical}} {{names have been}} formally changed in Turkey, their native names persist and continue in local dialects throughout the country. At times, Turkish politicians have also used <b>the</b> <b>native</b> names of cities during their speeches. In 2009, when addressing a crowd {{in the town of}} Güroymak, president Abdullah Gül used <b>the</b> <b>native</b> name Norşin. Also that year, when talking about his family origins, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan used <b>the</b> <b>native</b> Greek name of Potamya instead of Güneysu.|$|E
5|$|Harrison's troops buried {{their own}} {{dead on the}} site of their camp. They built large fires over the mass grave in an attempt to conceal it from <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> Americans.

5|$|Pontiac's War has {{traditionally}} been portrayed as a defeat for <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> Americans, but scholars now usually {{view it as a}} military stalemate: while <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> Americans had failed to drive away the British, the British were unable to conquer <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> Americans. Negotiation and accommodation, rather than success on the battlefield, ultimately brought an end to the war. <b>The</b> <b>Native</b> Americans had in fact won a victory of sorts by compelling the British government to abandon Amherst's policies and instead create a relationship with <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> Americans modeled on the Franco-Native alliance.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} persons who {{associated}} themselves with Europeans and proved themselves useful to white people achieved positions in <b>the</b> <b>native</b> society through fraud and extortion.

5|$|Although rare, {{deposits}} of native chromium exist. The Udachnaya Pipe in Russia produces samples of <b>the</b> <b>native</b> metal. This mine is a kimberlite pipe, rich in diamonds, and the reducing environment helped produce both elemental chromium and diamond.|$|E
5|$|An {{estimated}} 8000 Normans {{and other}} continentals settled in England {{as a result}} of the conquest, although exact figures cannot be established. Some of these new residents intermarried with <b>the</b> <b>native</b> English, but the extent of this practice in the years immediately after Hastings is unclear. Several marriages are attested between Norman men and English women during the years before 1100, but such marriages were uncommon. Most Normans continued to contract marriages with other Normans or other continental families rather than with the English. Within a century of the invasion, intermarriage between <b>the</b> <b>native</b> English and the Norman immigrants had become common. By the early 1160s, Ailred of Rievaulx was writing that intermarriage was common in all levels of society.|$|E

50|$|The first American came to {{this town}} in the year 1900 under Captain Mane. The people did not offer {{resistance}} to the occupation of the Americans, {{so there was no}} fighting between <b>the</b> <b>natives</b> and <b>the</b> Americans. <b>The</b> <b>natives</b> were at first afraid of the American soldiers. They thought that the Americans might abuse them. When <b>the</b> <b>natives</b> observed <b>the</b> Americans began their policy of attraction by giving their foods to <b>the</b> <b>natives.</b> They offered cakes and candies to the children.|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "Filipino" [...] {{originally}} {{referred to}} <b>the</b> <b>natives</b> of <b>the</b> Philippines themselves. It was Pedro Chirino, a Spanish Jesuit, who first called <b>the</b> <b>natives</b> [...] "Filipinos," [...] {{in his book}} Relación de las Islas Filipinas (Rome, 1604). However, during their 333-year rule of the Philippines, the Spanish rulers preferred to call <b>the</b> <b>natives</b> Indios.|$|R

5|$|As {{culturally}} and religiously tolerant as the Parthians were, they adopted Greek as their official language, while Aramaic remained the lingua franca in the empire. <b>The</b> <b>native</b> Parthian language, Middle Persian, and Akkadian were also used.|$|E
5|$|As potent as the {{military}} power of the Normans from the 1070s were the ideas and practices introduced into Wales, particularly {{in the sphere of}} ecclesiastical affairs; these were adopted and adapted by <b>the</b> <b>native</b> elites.|$|E
50|$|In {{both areas}} (New Bombay & Noida), Governmental ignorance and paternalistic {{attitude}} {{resulted in the}} creation of workers' colonies for immigrants when <b>the</b> <b>natives</b> refused to surrender their longheld and comfortable rustic lifestyles to work in an industrial milieu, resulting in exclusive, gated communities for the privileged immigrants at the cost of barring natives' right to access routes and to resources, and resulting in a mutual contempt and demonization between <b>the</b> <b>natives</b> and <b>the</b> immigrants, the government, business investors and immigrant workers portraying <b>the</b> <b>natives</b> as lazy and thieving and demanding privileges without earning them, and <b>the</b> <b>natives</b> portraying <b>the</b> immigrants as hustlers being unduly favored and privileged by the government over <b>the</b> <b>natives</b> in <b>the</b> natives' own historic homelands, denying them their ancient rights and privileges.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to {{leading to the}} distribution of too much land at the lax secretary's discretion, the headright system increased tensions between Native Americans and colonists. Indentured servants were granted land inland, which was near <b>the</b> <b>natives.</b> This migration produced conflict between <b>the</b> <b>natives</b> and <b>the</b> indentured servants. Later, Bacon's Rebellion was sparked by tensions between <b>the</b> <b>natives,</b> settlers, and indentured servants.|$|R

5|$|As {{the militia}} fell back, {{the three men}} who had set out in search of their horses {{returned}} and they too were killed by <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> American forces.

Finally, <b>the</b> <b>native</b> forces withdrew, leaving nine of their own dead behind. The June 25 battle {{was the last of}} the Black Hawk War on Illinois soil. Dement's company lost five men with another three were wounded, many horses were killed as well.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the cemetery's use {{in the latter part of}} the 7th century, Britain was divided into a number of kingdoms ruled by {{different}} ethnic groups– <b>the</b> <b>native</b> Picts in the north (in what is now Scotland), <b>the</b> <b>native</b> Britons in the west of what is now England, Wales and south-western Scotland, and the immigrant Angles, Saxons, and Jutes in the east and south of modern England and south-eastern Scotland. Until the early 7th century, the north-east of England and parts of Scotland were ruled by two Saxon kingdoms: Deira in modern Yorkshire, and Bernicia from north of the River Tees to the Firth of Forth. By {{the time of}} the burials the two kingdoms had merged to form the powerful kingdom of Northumbria.|$|E
5|$|British troops {{proceeded}} {{to occupy the}} various forts in the Ohio Country and Great Lakes region previously garrisoned by the French. Even before the war officially ended with the Treaty of Paris (1763), the British Crown began to implement changes in order to administer its vastly expanded North American territory. While the French had long cultivated alliances among certain of <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> Americans, the British post-war approach was essentially to treat <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> Americans as a conquered people. Before long, Native Americans who had been allies of the defeated French found themselves increasingly dissatisfied with the British occupation and the new policies imposed by the victors.|$|E
50|$|This {{leads the}} settler {{to call the}} “Dagandagan”.

They agreed to call the barrio Dangcagan in honor of <b>the</b> <b>natives.</b>|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>natives</b> can be {{attacked}} simply by moving onto them.

5|$|Collecting centres {{for native}} {{foodstuffs}} and tracks {{leading from the}} coast were bombed by the US Fifth Air Force.

5|$|During the night, {{three of}} the militia's horses wandered off; the next day, June 25, three men {{went in search of}} the animals while the rest stayed behind. At the cabin, seven Native American braves {{appeared}} in the distance. The troops immediately began pursuing the natives, who fled into the woods, instead of reporting the sighting to Dement. <b>The</b> <b>Native</b> American warriors, as had been done other times {{during the course of the}} war, set an ambush for the militia men in the forest. The militia pursued the natives into the woods and, as they entered the forest, the natives opened fire, the volley instantly killed two militia men and wounded another. The militia retreated and formed a battle line but <b>the</b> <b>native</b> forces would not relent. The rest of Dement's company attempted to rescue the outmatched militia men but were unable to beat back <b>the</b> <b>native</b> warriors. Black Hawk's band attacked the militia men, again forcing the beleaguered force to fall back to the Kellogg cabin and barn.|$|E
50|$|In general, Bota's Malay {{population}} can {{be divided}} into three main groups, <b>the</b> <b>natives</b> of Perak, <b>the</b> <b>natives</b> of Kedah and the Banjar people. <b>The</b> <b>natives</b> of Perak constitute the majority of Bota's populace, particularly along the left and rights banks of the Perak River. <b>The</b> Kedah <b>natives</b> in Bota moved to this town in the 1960s, and they primarily reside in some areas of Titi Gantung.
