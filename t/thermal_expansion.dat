5|$|There {{are many}} types of glass, and it is most common to weld using the same types. Different glasses often have {{different}} rates of <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion,</b> which can cause them to crack upon cooling when they contract differently. For instance, quartz has very low <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion,</b> while soda-lime glass has very high <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion.</b> When welding different glasses to each other, it is usually important to closely match their coefficients of <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion,</b> to ensure that cracking does not occur. Also, some glasses will simply not mix with others, so welding between certain types may not be possible.|$|E
5|$|The {{physical}} properties of gallium are highly anisotropic, i.e. have different values along {{the three major}} crystallographical axes a, b, and c (see table), producing {{a significant difference between}} the linear (α) and volume <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> coefficients. The properties of gallium are strongly temperature-dependent, particularly near the melting point. For example, the coefficient of <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> increases by several hundred percent upon melting.|$|E

40|$|International audienceEffective thermoelastic {{properties}} [...] elasticities, <b>thermal</b> <b>expansions,</b> heat capacities [...] of composites with temperature-dependent constituents {{are derived}} {{all at the}} same time using a unified thermodynamic treatment within Kovalenko's thermoelasticity theory, which assumes the strain to be small but places no restrictions on temperature variations. Known results on elasticities and <b>thermal</b> <b>expansions</b> are rederived in a new way and new results on <b>thermal</b> <b>expansions</b> and heat capacities are obtained. In addition, the temperature-independent framework is revisited and expressions for the effective properties are obtained that are free of the restrictions placed on temperature variations within linear thermoelasticity...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDry cutting is an {{important}} issue with regard to the economy and ecology of machining. The absence of the cutting fluid reduces both the costs for machining and the risk of ecological hazards. However, the missing convection through the cutting fluid increases the temperatures of the workpiece and the tool, and thus their <b>thermal</b> <b>expansions.</b> As a result, remarkable deviations from the nominal workpiece geometry occur. To enhance the accuracy of machining when dry turning, the <b>thermal</b> <b>expansions</b> of the tool and the workpiece can be calculated prior to actual turning using finite element (FE) models in order to adapt the nominal depth of cut accordingly. Therefore, an experimentally validated (using aluminum as the workpiece material) FE model is presented. The FE model inputs the heat flux into the tool and the workpiece as boundary conditions. The heat flux is applied locally and temporally discretized to the workpiece and the tool in the chip formation area. Their <b>thermal</b> <b>expansions</b> can thus be calculated in terms of the cutting condition used and the tool position, whereby process planning regarding the machining accuracy is facilitated...|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to about 75% SiO2 and 8-12% B2O3, these glasses contain up to 5% alkaline earths and alumina (Al2O3). This is a subtype of slightly softer glasses, which have <b>thermal</b> <b>expansions</b> {{in the range}} (4.0-5.0) × 10−6 K−1.|$|R
5|$|Of all {{metals in}} pure form, {{tungsten}} {{has the highest}} melting point (3422°C, 6192°F), lowest vapor pressure (at temperatures above 1650°C, 3000°F), and the highest tensile strength. Although carbon remains solid at higher temperatures than tungsten, carbon sublimes at atmospheric pressure instead of melting, so it has no melting point. Tungsten has the lowest coefficient of <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> of any pure metal. The low <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> and high melting point and tensile strength of tungsten originate from strong covalent bonds formed between tungsten atoms by the 5d electrons.|$|E
5|$|Adobe {{walls were}} {{historically}} made by laying the bricks with mud mortar, which swells and shrinks {{at the same}} rate as the bricks when wetted or dried, heated or cooled. Modern adobe may be stabilized with cement and bonded with cement mortars, but cement mortars will cause unstabilized adobe bricks to deteriorate due to the different rates of <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> and contraction.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{is thought}} to have a body-centered cubic crystal {{structure}} from absolute zero to its melting point, high-resolution measurements of the <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> along the three crystallographic axes reveal anisotropies which are inconsistent with a cubic structure.

5|$|At room temperature, {{protactinium}} crystallizes in the body-centered tetragonal structure {{which can}} be regarded as distorted body-centered cubic lattice; this structure does not change upon compression up to 53 GPa.

5|$|Thorium fuels {{also result}} in a safer and better-performing reactor core because thorium dioxide has a higher melting point, higher thermal conductivity, lower {{coefficient}} of <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> and is more stable chemically than the now-common fuel uranium dioxide, which can further oxidise to triuranium octoxide (U3O8).|$|E
5|$|Yttrium {{has been}} studied as a nodulizer in ductile cast iron, forming the {{graphite}} into compact nodules instead of flakes to increase ductility and fatigue resistance. Having a high melting point, yttrium oxide is used in some ceramic and glass to impart shock resistance and low <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> properties. Those same properties make such glass useful in camera lenses.|$|E
5|$|Because {{glass is}} very brittle in its solid state, {{it is often}} prone to {{cracking}} upon heating and cooling, especially if the heating and cooling are uneven. This is because the brittleness of glass {{does not allow for}} uneven <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion.</b> Glass that has been welded will usually need to be cooled very slowly and evenly through the glass transition, in a process called annealing, to relieve any internal stresses created by a temperature gradient.|$|E

5|$|Phreatomagmatic eruptions are eruptions {{that arise}} from {{interactions}} between water and magma. They are driven from thermal contraction (as opposed to magmatic eruptions, which are driven by <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion)</b> of magma when it comes in contact with water. This temperature {{difference between the two}} causes violent water-lava interactions that make up the eruption. The products of phreatomagmatic eruptions are believed to be more regular in shape and finer grained than the products of magmatic eruptions because of the differences in eruptive mechanisms.|$|E
5|$|The Pipeline Authorization Act {{required}} the pipeline {{to be able}} to withstand the maximum earthquake ever recorded in the area it was built. When crossing the Denali Fault, Teflon-coated sliders were designed to allow the pipeline to move side-to-side in an earthquake. To protect against forward-and-backward shocks and to allow for <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion,</b> the pipeline wasn't designed as a straight line. Instead, it was intended to be laid in an S-shape, and the bends would allow for expansion and movement without breaking.|$|E
5|$|The {{safety issues}} for {{cryogenic}} helium {{are similar to}} those of liquid nitrogen; its extremely low temperatures can result in cold burns, and the liquid-to-gas expansion ratio can cause explosions if no pressure-relief devices are installed. Containers of helium gas at 5 to 10 K should be handled as if they contain liquid helium due to the rapid and significant <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> that occurs when helium gas at less than 10 K is warmed to room temperature.|$|E

5|$|Because of its {{excellent}} thermal {{and chemical}} stability, boron nitride ceramics are traditionally used {{as parts of}} high-temperature equipment. h-BN can be included in ceramics, alloys, resins, plastics, rubbers, and other materials, giving them self-lubricating properties. Such materials are suitable for construction of e.g. bearings and in steelmaking. Plastics filled with BN have less <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> as well as higher thermal conductivity and electrical resistivity.
