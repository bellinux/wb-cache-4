25|$|Some {{students}} {{suffer from}} test anxiety. Test anxiety applies to standardized tests as well, where students {{who may not}} have test anxiety regularly feel immense pressure to perform when <b>the</b> <b>stakes</b> <b>are</b> so high. High stakes standardized testing includes exams like the SAT, the PARCC, and the ACT, where doing well is required for grade passing or college admission.|$|E

He is first seen in Albert Square in June 1985 when he takes part in one of Ali's regular late-night poker games. Like his brother, Mehmet is a serial gambler and whenever he gambles <b>the</b> <b>stakes</b> <b>are</b> often foolishly high.

But this time, <b>the</b> <b>stakes</b> <b>are</b> larger than just the lives of the soldiers. Lord Sumner, with the Spear of Ragnarok, plans to destroy the world, which he believes to be corrupt, in order for it to be reborn.

25|$|When backgammon {{is played}} for money, {{the most common}} {{arrangement}} is to assign a monetary value to each point, and to play to a certain score, or until either player chooses to stop. <b>The</b> <b>stakes</b> <b>are</b> raised by gammons, backgammons, {{and use of the}} doubling cube. Backgammon is sometimes available in casinos. Before the commercialization of neural network programs, proposition bets on specific positions were very common among backgammon players and gamblers. As with most gambling games, successful play requires a combination of luck and skill, as a single dice roll can sometimes significantly change the outcome of the game.|$|E
25|$|Consistent {{with the}} {{conservation}} hypothesis, people can exert self-control despite ego depletion if <b>the</b> <b>stakes</b> <b>are</b> high enough. Offering cash incentives or other motives for good performance counteracts {{the effects of}} ego depletion. This may seem surprising {{but in fact it}} may be highly adaptive. Given the value and importance of the capacity for self-control, it would be dangerous for a person to lose that capacity completely, and so ego depletion effects may occur because people start conserving their remaining strength. When people do exert themselves on the second task, they deplete the resource even more, as reflected in severe impairments on a third task that they have not anticipated.|$|E
50|$|Mаtchеd bеtting (also {{known as}} lay bеt {{matching}} or double bеts) {{is a technique}} used to profit from bookmаkеrs, where two bookmаkеrs are pitted against each other when their predicted outcomes vary greatly, where (regardless of the outcome or who wins) the bеttor is guaranteed at least some profit. A typical return for a matched bet where <b>the</b> <b>stake</b> <b>is</b> returned is 85%+ of the free bet offer amount, and 70%+ where <b>the</b> <b>stake</b> <b>is</b> not returned. Most free bets <b>are</b> <b>stake</b> not returned.|$|R

500|$|The actual {{efficacy}} of jury consultants {{may not be}} very important because the demographic composition of the jury has {{little effect on the}} verdict it renders, usually causing only a 5%–15% variance in verdicts. The evidence presented at trial has far more impact on what the verdict will be. As Kressel and Kressel indicate, [...] "when the evidence is strong, nothing else matters much" [...] and even when the evidence is ambiguous, demographic characteristics of jurors are a relatively minor influence. Some researchers argue that a significant improvement in jury selection, however small, may be worthwhile when <b>the</b> <b>stakes</b> <b>are</b> high, like for a defendant accused of a capital crime or a corporation that stands to lose millions of dollars in a civil suit.|$|E
500|$|The lyrics try to {{illustrate}} Bond's psyche in Casino Royale, described by Cornell as a conflicted and tough spy with more emotional depth, not the [...] "superconfident, seemingly invincible, winking kinda ladies' man superspy" [...] {{of the previous}} incarnations.

[...] The song also served as an introduction to the character, even though he was featured in many other movies before - hence the title [...] "You Know My Name" [...] - dealing with Bond's action such as his first assassination, [...] "introducing himself to what may be {{the rest of his life}} and how he will live it and what it will mean." ...|$|E

2500|$|High-stakes {{tests are}} often given {{as a single}} long exam. [...] Some critics prefer {{continuous}} assessment instead of one larger test. For example, the American Psychological Association (APA) opposes using a one-time high school exit examination as the single determinant of whether a student should graduate, saying, [...] "Any decision about a student's continued education, such as retention, tracking, or graduation, should not {{be based on the}} results of a single test, but should include other relevant and valid information." [...] Since <b>the</b> <b>stakes</b> <b>are</b> related to consequences, not method, however, short tests can also be high-stakes.|$|E
2500|$|A test may be [...] "high-stakes" [...] {{based on}} {{consequences}} for others beyond the individual test-taker. [...] For example, an individual medical student who fails a licensing exam {{will not be}} able to practice his or her profession. [...] However, if enough students at the same school fail the exam, then the school's reputation and accreditation may be in jeopardy. [...] Similarly, testing under the U.S.'s No Child Left Behind Act has no direct negative consequences for failing students, but potentially serious consequences for their schools, including loss of accreditation, funding, teacher pay, teacher employment, or changes to the school's management. [...] <b>The</b> <b>stakes</b> <b>are</b> therefore high for the school, but low for the individual test-takers.|$|E

2500|$|High-stakes testing may {{encourage}} teachers to omit {{material that is}} not tested. [...] "Teaching to the test" [...] {{can result in a}} narrow curriculum and lower skills. [...] For example, if a driving exam does not test parallel parking skills, then driving instructors may stop teaching that skill to a driving student, in favor of focusing instruction time on the material that will be tested, such as determining which vehicle has the right of way at a four-way stop. [...] The result is that the student will be able to pass the test, but may be unable to park a car safely in some places. [...] According to Campbell's law, the higher <b>the</b> <b>stakes</b> <b>are</b> (for the test taker or for the school), the more likely this is to happen.|$|E
2500|$|In 1963, U.S. Senator and Republican presidential {{candidate}} Barry Goldwater {{was quoted in}} a Saturday Evening Post article by Stewart Alsop as saying, [...] "You know, I {{think we ought to}} sell TVA." [...] He had called for the sale to private companies of particular parts of the Authority, including its fertilizer production and steam-generation facilities, because [...] "it would be better operated and would be of more benefit for more people if it were part of private industry." [...] Goldwater's Saturday Evening Post quotation was used against him in a TV ad by Doyle Dane Bernbach for President Lyndon Johnson's 1964 campaign, which depicted an auction taking place atop a dam. It was voiced over as follows: [...] "In a Saturday Evening Post article dated August 31, 1963, Barry Goldwater said, 'You know, I think we ought to sell TVA.' This is a promise: President Johnson will not sell TVA. Vote for him on November 3. <b>The</b> <b>stakes</b> <b>are</b> too high for you to stay home." ...|$|E

In August 2014, D'Onofrio stated that after the [...] "series stuff with Netflix", Marvel has [...] "a bigger plan to branch out".
