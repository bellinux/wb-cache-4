5|$|Measurements of <b>the</b> <b>interaction</b> between {{energetic}} photons and hadrons {{show that}} <b>the</b> <b>interaction</b> {{is much more}} intense than expected by <b>the</b> <b>interaction</b> of merely photons with the hadron's electric charge. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>interaction</b> of energetic photons with protons is similar to <b>the</b> <b>interaction</b> of photons with neutrons {{in spite of the}} fact that the electric charge structures of protons and neutrons are substantially different. A theory called Vector Meson Dominance (VMD) was developed to explain this effect. According to VMD, the photon is a superposition of the pure electromagnetic photon which interacts only with electric charges and vector meson. However, if experimentally probed at very short distances, the intrinsic structure of the photon is recognized as a flux of quark and gluon components, quasi-free according to asymptotic freedom in QCD and described by the photon structure function. A comprehensive comparison of data with theoretical predictions was presented in a review in 2000.|$|E

40|$|The axiomatic {{design is}} a general design method, which {{provides}} a theoretical framework for design evaluation.

In this research, analytic network process (ANP) theory is applied to study <b>the</b> <b>interactions.</b> A general model of ANP for <b>the</b> <b>interactions</b> is proposed. An algorithm for measuring <b>the</b> <b>interactions</b> is also developed. Two methods and corresponding criteria of identifying whether or not <b>the</b> <b>interactions</b> can be ignored are proposed.

5|$|A third {{component}} of motion that occurs relatively infrequently involves <b>the</b> <b>interaction</b> of multiple tropical cyclones. When two cyclones approach one another, their centers will begin orbiting cyclonically about a point {{between the two}} systems. Depending on their separation distance and strength, the two vortices may simply orbit around one another or else may spiral into the center point and merge. When the two vortices are of unequal size, the larger vortex will tend to dominate <b>the</b> <b>interaction,</b> and the smaller vortex will orbit around it.

5|$|Close {{examination}} of the spectral lines reveals that some display a fine structure splitting. This occurs because of spin–orbit coupling, which is an interaction between the spin and motion of the outermost electron. When an atom is in an external magnetic field, spectral lines become split into three or more components; a phenomenon called the Zeeman effect. This is caused by <b>the</b> <b>interaction</b> of the magnetic field with the magnetic moment of the atom and its electrons. Some atoms can have multiple electron configurations with the same energy level, which thus appear as a single spectral line. <b>The</b> <b>interaction</b> of the magnetic field with the atom shifts these electron configurations to slightly different energy levels, resulting in multiple spectral lines. The presence of an external electric field can cause a comparable splitting and shifting of spectral lines by modifying the electron energy levels, a phenomenon called the Stark effect.|$|E
