Criticizing the Air Force cost analysis, the DSB found that among other things, the Air Force failed <b>to</b> <b>account</b> <b>for</b> the cost of aerial refueling; the DSB estimated that refueling in the air cost $17.50 per gallon, whereas the Air Force had failed <b>to</b> <b>account</b> <b>for</b> the cost of fuel delivery and so had only priced fuel at $1.20 per gallon.|$|E

The volatility of Internet company share prices during the last two years has prompted scrutiny by the financial press as well as the US Securities and Exchange Commission. In late 1999 the Chief Accountant of the SEC requested the US Financial Accounting Standards Board's Emerging Issues Task Force to address a number of issues related <b>to</b> <b>accounting</b> <b>for</b> Internet activities.
