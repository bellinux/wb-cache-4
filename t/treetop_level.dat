25|$|During the war Yugoslav strike {{aircraft}} J-22 Oraos and G-4 Super Galebs performed some 20–30 combat missions against the KLA in Kosovo at <b>treetop</b> <b>level</b> causing some casualties. During {{one of those}} missions on March 25, 1999, Lt. Colonel Života Ðurić was killed when his J-22 Orao hit a hill in Kosovo. It was never firmly established whether an aircraft malfunction, pilot error or an enemy action (by KLA) was the cause (NATO never claimed it shot it down).|$|E
25|$|The 5,000th Lightning built, a P-38J-20-LO, 44-23296, {{was painted}} bright {{vermilion}} red, {{and had the}} name YIPPEE painted {{on the underside of}} the wings in big white letters as well as the signatures of hundreds of factory workers. This and other aircraft were used by a handful of Lockheed test pilots including Milo Burcham, Jimmie Mattern and Tony LeVier in remarkable flight demonstrations, performing such stunts as slow rolls at <b>treetop</b> <b>level</b> with one prop feathered to dispel the myth that the P-38 was unmanageable.|$|E
25|$|Flying a Tempest, French ace Pierre Clostermann {{claimed the}} first Allied combat {{encounter}} with a Dornier 335 in April 1945. In his book The Big Show (pp.273–274) he describes leading a flight of four Hawker Tempests from No. 3 Squadron RAF over northern Germany, when he intercepted a lone Do 335 flying at maximum speed at <b>treetop</b> <b>level.</b> Detecting the British aircraft, the German pilot reversed course to evade. Despite the Tempests' considerable low altitude speed, the Royal Air Force fighters {{were not able to}} catch up or even get into firing position.|$|E

5000|$|... ==Helicopter NOE flying== The lowest NOE flying is by {{helicopters}} {{because they}} have lower speeds and more maneuverability than fixed-wing aircraft, particularly fast-jets. Helicopters can fly at <b>treetop</b> <b>levels</b> or even below the height of surrounding trees where there are clear areas (such as in river gullies), flying under wires (such as electricity cables) rather than over them. Attack helicopters can hide behind trees or buildings, [...] "popping up" [...] just enough to use their (rotor mast-mounted) radar or other sensors and then minimally exposing themselves to launch weapons. The required altitude depends {{on the type of}} terrain, such as low vegetation or low buildings, tree canopy layer of less than 45 m, presence of tall buildings or concrete pylons with heights of up to 25 m international standard, or emergent tree layer canopy and lattice steel electricity pylons to 100 m being present. Over populated areas with tall radio transmission towers, an altitude of 150 m AGL applies.|$|R

25|$|Before takeoff {{the pilot}} {{requested}} a weather report by phone and decided weather {{along the route}} was safe for visual flying. No flight plan was required and none was filed. Air traffic control at Peachtree cleared the fight and the aircraft departed at 09:10 EST. As the flight continued, weather conditions deteriorated, and two hours twenty minutes after take off, at 11:30 several residents of Galax, Virginia (60 miles due west of Martinsville), reported seeing the Aero Commander flying circles {{in and out of}} the clouds at approximately 150 feet above ground level (AGL). Shortly afterward the aircraft unsuccessfully attempted to land on a four-lane highway northwest of Galax. After making a pass over the town at near <b>treetop</b> <b>level,</b> the aircraft left the area heading west towards the Blue Ridge Mountains.|$|E
25|$|The {{arrival of}} the German {{aircraft}} over Dombås {{came as a surprise}} to the Norwegian forces who nonetheless soon opened fire on the Ju 52s with all available arms. Gunners aboard the Ju 52s returned fire while flying at <b>treetop</b> <b>level.</b> Soon after, the first paratroopers were dropped over the area and took heavy fire while descending to the ground. The ground fire took a heavy toll on the German transport aircraft, with only five out of the original 15 Ju 52s making it back to Fornebu, with another two landing at Værnes Airbase near Trondheim, all seven surviving aircraft riddled with bullet holes. The remaining eight transports were shot down or made forced landings. One Ju 52 made an emergency landing on Vänern Lake near Mariestad, Sweden, where it later broke through the ice and sank. The aircraft was salvaged and returned to the Luftwaffe by the Swedish authorities in January 1941. Many of the paratroopers that had been on the shot-down aircraft died in the crashes, or were killed or captured by Norwegian patrols soon after.|$|E
25|$|In {{accordance}} with division policy, artillery marching fire had been preceding {{the company as}} it moved east; it was being fired by the 2d Battalion, 33d Artillery (105-mm.), located at Artillery Base II at Prek Klok. As soon as contact was made the artillery forward observer ordered the shells to be trained on the communist position. Within minutes one of the command and control Huey helicopters of the division was flying above the battle scene and in touch with both the division tactical operations center and, {{in the absence of}} the brigade and battalion commanders, the company on the ground. The tactical operations center was alerted to get a forward air controller airborne over the area and to be prepared to get air strikes into the area once every fifteen minutes. Since the enemy was not dug in, the ordnance requested was cluster bombs, delivered almost at <b>treetop</b> <b>level</b> with a bursting radius of 30 meters. They could be delivered very close to friendly units and were highly lethal against troops in the open, even in the jungle.|$|E
50|$|The {{same process}} {{is used to}} measure the height of the base of the tree above or below eye level. If the base of the tree is below eye level, then the height of the tree below eye level is added to the height above eye level. If the base of the tree is above eye level, then the height of the base of the tree above eye level is {{subtracted}} from the height of the <b>treetop</b> above eye <b>level.</b> It may be difficult to directly measure the horizontal distance at eye level if that distance is high off the ground or if the base of the tree is above eye level. In these cases the distance {{to the base of the}} tree can be measured using the tape along the slope from eye level to the base of the tree and noting the slope angle Θ. In this case the height of the base of the tree above or below eye level is equal to the (sin Θ x slope distance) and the horizontal distance to the tree is (cos Θ x slope distance).|$|R
2500|$|Hussein was {{a trained}} pilot, flying both {{airplanes}} and helicopters as a hobby. In a 1999 interview Henry Kissinger described being flown by Hussein, saying that [...] "...he was a daring pilot, {{and he would}} be zooming along at <b>treetop</b> <b>level,</b> and my wife, in order to be politely insistent would say, 'You know I didn't know helicopters could fly so low.' 'Oh!' said the King, 'They can fly lower!' and went below tree top level just skimming along on the ground. That really aged me rapidly." ...|$|E
2500|$|The F-15's {{versatile}} APG-63 and 70 pulse-Doppler {{radar systems}} {{can look up}} at high-flying targets and look-down/shoot-down at low-flying targets without being confused by ground clutter. These radars can detect and track aircraft and small high-speed targets at distances beyond visual range down to close range, and at altitudes down to <b>treetop</b> <b>level.</b> The APG-63 has a basic range of [...] [...] The radar feeds target information into the central computer for effective weapons delivery. For close-in dogfights, the radar automatically acquires enemy aircraft, and this information is projected on the head-up display. The F-15's electronic warfare system provides both threat warning (radar warning receiver) and automatic countermeasures against selected threats.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "St. Clair Triangle", [...] "UFO Over Illinois", [...] "Southern Illinois UFO", or [...] "Highland, Illinois UFO" [...] {{sighting}} {{occurred on}} January 5, 2000 over {{the towns of}} Highland, Dupo, Lebanon, Shiloh, Summerfield, Millstadt, and O'Fallon, Illinois, beginning shortly after 4:00 am. Five on-duty police officers around these locales, along with various other eyewitnesses, sighted and reported a massive, silent, triangular craft operating at an unusual <b>treetop</b> <b>level</b> altitude and speeds. The incident was examined in various television shows including the ABC special [...] with Peter Jennings, an hour-long Discovery Channel special UFOs Over Illinois, an episode of the Syfy series Proof Positive and a half-hour-long independent documentary titled The Edge of Reality: Illinois UFO, January 5, 2000 by Darryl Barker Productions.|$|E
2500|$|In early 1919, a United States Marine Corps (USMC) JN-4 {{was also}} {{credited}} {{with what is}} believed to be the first successful [...] "dive bombing" [...] attack during the United States occupation of Haiti. [...] USMC pilot Lt Lawson H. Sanderson mounted a carbine barrel in front of the windshield of his JN-4 (previously, an unarmed trainer that had a machine gun mounted in the rear cockpit) as an improvised bomb sight that was lined up with the long axis of his aircraft, loaded a bomb in a canvas mail bag that was attached to the JN-4's belly, and launched a single-handed raid at <b>treetop</b> <b>level,</b> in support of a USMC unit that had been trapped by Haitian Cacos rebels. Although the JN-4 almost disintegrated in the pullout, the attack was effective and led to Sanderson in 1920 developing further dive-bombing techniques to provide Marine pilots with close aerial support to infantry comrades.|$|E
2500|$|The {{material}} {{effects of}} these missions may be regarded as minor, but the psychological effect on German troops was noticeable. They typically attacked by surprise {{in the middle of}} the night, denying German troops sleep and keeping them on their guard, contributing to the already high stress of combat on the Eastern front. The usual tactic involved flying only a few meters above the ground, rising for the final approach, throttling back the engine and making a gliding bombing run, leaving the targeted troops with only the eerie whistling of the wind in the wings' bracing-wires as an indication of the impending attack. Luftwaffe fighters found it extremely hard to shoot down the Kukuruznik because of two main factors: the pilots flew at <b>treetop</b> <b>level</b> where they were hard to see or engage and the stall speed of both the Messerschmitt Bf 109 and the Focke-Wulf Fw 190 was similar to the U-2s maximum speed, making it difficult for the fighters to keep a Po-2 in weapons range for an adequate period of time. The success of the Soviet night harassment units inspired the Luftwaffe to set up similar Störkampfstaffel [...] "harassment combat squadrons" [...] on the Eastern Front using their own obsolete 1930s-era, open cockpit biplanes (most often the Gotha Go 145 and Arado Ar 66 biplanes) and parasol monoplane aircraft, eventually building up to larger Nachtschlachtgruppe (night attack group) units of a few squadrons each.|$|E
2500|$|While their American opponents enjoyed air superiority, PAVN forces {{continuously}} challenged them, deploying {{an impressive}} array of ordnance to liquidate enemies from the air. The sophisticated missile defense system built with Soviet and Chinese assistance is well known, but PAVN made extensive use of anti-aircraft guns and even volume firing by ordinary soldiers. At the lowest level, one study noted that PAVN gunners were trained to use small arms against all types of aircraft, and special firing cells were established that could shoot up to 1000 rounds in 3 to 5 seconds at fast-moving jets. The volume of such firepower made life hazardous at the low levels for US planes, forcing them to move to higher altitudes, where the specialized anti-aircraft cannon took over. Special [...] "bait" [...] areas, ringed with hidden anti-craft batteries were also established to lure US aircraft. Barrage firing of many guns, mixed at various levels was also sometimes effective. Sensitive areas, such as Hanoi, were the most heavily defended. Most US aircraft losses were caused by heavy automatic weapons and 14mm, 35mm 57mm and 85mm anti-aircraft guns. Flak batteries forced some US aircraft even higher, where they would be within reach of the deadly SA-2 missile batteries. Positioning automatic weapons at <b>treetop</b> <b>level</b> also aided in the struggle against US helicopters. Air losses were to cause a dip in the morale of American pilots, some of whom felt they were being called to risk their lives against targets of relatively little value. Appeals to US Defense Secretary McNamara to remove restrictions on more lucrative targets were often drastically pared down or vetoed. The inability of US airpower to take a decisive toll on communist forces is testimony not only to US failures, but to the tenacity of the ordinary PAVN soldier in direct combat with aerial enemies and in the massive effort spent in constructing sophisticated fortifications and tunnel systems.|$|E
