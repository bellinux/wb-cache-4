5|$|Michael (Steve Carell) {{is asked}} to visit the Dunder Mifflin {{branches}} to lecture about his success in Scranton. He and Pam (Jenna Fischer), who is coming along as his assistant and driver, plan to visit every branch except Nashua because Michael {{is not ready to}} face his ex-girlfriend Holly, who works there. They first visit the Utica branch, where former Scranton employee Karen (Rashida Jones) is now regional manager. Pam, who is engaged to Karen's ex-boyfriend Jim (John Krasinski), fears the encounter will be awkward. But Karen is now married and pregnant, and the two get along very well – when Pam reveals her and Jim's engagement, Karen even offers genuine congratulations. Michael's lecture in Utica proves to be a disaster when he tries to teach the employees a trick for how to memorize names and ends up insulting everybody. Nevertheless, Pam is ecstatic to have found closure with Karen. Later, on the road, Michael tells Pam that he never found closure with Holly and, at Pam's suggestion, they decide <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>off</b> the other lectures and drive to Nashua to find Holly.|$|E
25|$|To {{reach the}} quays, No.42 had first to pass over a short tramway from the BNCR goods yard to the Belfast Harbour Commissioners' tramway. To {{accomplish}} this feat required three persons {{to drive and}} conduct her, and if more than two wagons were attached, a fourth to look after them. Two of these people were equipped with red flags. While on the tramway her driver {{was not allowed to}} sound the whistle, open the cylinder drain taps or allow the engine <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>off.</b> The maximum speed was to be three miles per hour.|$|E
25|$|A team of Vatican-sponsored vampire hunters led by Jack Crow rids an {{abandoned}} house of vampires {{in the middle}} of New Mexico during a daylight raid. The team uses a coordinated method of using battle pikes as harpoons, spearing vampires within the house so that a mechanical winch can pull them outside into the daylight. After clearing the house, the team celebrates at a local motel with drinking and prostitutes, to the disapproval of the Priest assigned to the team. Jack Crow defends the celebration, stating that given the horrors the team witnesses on a daily basis, this is an effective way <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>off</b> steam. During the height of the party, with most of the team drunk, they are attacked swiftly by a master vampire called Valek, who kills most of the team and their priest. Only two members of the team survive, Jack Crow and Tony Montoya, as well as a prostitute named Katrina who was bitten by Valek. Crow later meets his boss, Cardinal Alba, who introduces him to Father Adam Guiteau.|$|E

6000|$|Burke {{and most}} of the other men now {{gathered}} on deck, watching the Dunkery Beacon. She was still lying <b>to,</b> <b>blowing</b> <b>off</b> steam, and {{there seemed to be a}} good deal of confusion on her deck. Suddenly Burke saw a black object in the water near her starboard quarter. Gazing at it intently, his eyes began to glisten. In a few moments he exclaimed, [...] "Look there! It's Shirley! He's swimming to the yacht!" ...|$|R

2500|$|Having got {{on to the}} Harbour Commissioners' tramway she {{was still}} not allowed <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>off</b> or to have the {{cylinder}} drain taps opened.

One other rather peculiar regulation forbade her from being closer than [...] to any other train approaching or preceding her on the same line of rails.|$|E
2500|$|The first D-21 was {{completed}} {{in the spring of}} 1964 by Lockheed. After four more months of checkouts and static tests, the aircraft was shipped to Groom Lake and reassembled. It was to be carried by a two-seat derivative of the A-12, designated the [...] "M-21". When the D-21/M-21 reached the launch point, the first step would be <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>off</b> the D-21's inlet and exhaust covers. With the D-21/M-21 at the correct speed and altitude, the LCO would start the ramjet and the other systems of the D-21. With the D-21's systems activated and running, and the launch aircraft at the correct point, the M-21 would begin a slight pushover, the LCO would push a final button, and the D-21 would come off the pylon".|$|E
2500|$|The siege {{ended in}} a fierce battle on March 6. [...] As the Mexican army overran the walls, most of the Texians fell back to the long barracks (convent) and the chapel. During the siege, Texians had carved holes {{in many of the}} walls of these rooms so that {{they would be able to}} fire. [...] Each room had only one door which led into the {{courtyard}} and which had been [...] "buttressed by semicircular parapets of dirt secured with cowhides". Some of the rooms even had trenches dug into the floor to provide some cover for the defenders. [...] Mexican soldiers used the abandoned Texian cannon <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>off</b> the doors of the rooms, allowing Mexican soldiers to enter and defeat the Texians.|$|E

60|$|At {{the foot}} of our own companion, just where I found Blackwood, Jones and the bo’s’un were now engaged in talk. This last was a gruff, cruel-looking seaman, who must have passed near half a century upon the seas; square-headed, goat-bearded, with heavy blond eyebrows, and an eye without radiance, but inflexibly steady and hard. I had not {{forgotten}} his rough speech; but I remembered also that he had helped us about the lantern; and now seeing him in conversation with Jones, and being choked with indignation, I proceeded <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>off</b> my steam.|$|E
60|$|Now in no sort {{of general}} popular mental {{activity}} is there so much froth and waste as in religious excitements. This {{has been the}} case in all periods of religious revival. The number who are rather impressed, who for a few days or weeks take to reading their Bibles or going to a new place of worship or praying or fasting or being kind and unselfish, is always enormous in relation to the people whose lives are permanently changed. The effort needed if a contemporary is <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>off</b> the froth, is always very considerable.|$|E

He was the drag upon the wheel, and an Americanised Irishman of the second generation, despising his own race and hating the other. He had learned caution.|$|R
60|$|Towards sunset the sea-breeze {{dropped and}} the mist {{gathered}} thicker about the hills. Faint puffs of hot wind began <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>off</b> the land, which faded suddenly as darkness rolled down. A thin haze drifted {{out across the}} water and the speed slackened as the vessel closed with the shore. Then dim lights blinked out ahead, the engines stopped, and a detonating rocket burst high up in the sky. Soon afterwards a steam launch came off, and the purser stopped near Dick on his way to his room.|$|E
60|$|All {{this was}} very doleful, and had a {{tendency}} to depress the spirits of a man awake and alone in a good-sized house. But I shook off this depression. It was, not agreeable to be up here by myself in such a terrible storm, but {{there was nothing to be}} afraid of, as my house was new and very strongly built, being constructed of logs, weather-boarded outside and ceiled within. It would require a hurricane <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>off</b> the roof, and I believed my shutters to be hail-proof. So, as there was no reason to stay awake, I turned over and went to sleep.|$|E
