25|$|It is {{uncertain}} {{who wrote the}} note. Leach has said that <b>the</b> <b>handwriting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> front of the document most closely resembles that of either Menella or Violet Dodgson, Dodgson's nieces. However, Morton N. Cohen says {{in an article published}} in the Times Literary Supplement in 2003 that in the 1960s, Dodgson's great-nephew Philip Dodgson Jacques told him that Jacques had written the note himself based on conversations he remembered with Dodgson's nieces. Cohen's article offered no evidence to support this, however, and known samples of Jacques' handwriting do not seem to resemble the writing of the note.|$|E
25|$|On March 3, 2007, an American Greetings Christmas card {{sent to the}} Chronicle, postmarked 1990 in Eureka had {{recently}} been discovered in their photo files by editorial assistant Daniel King. Inside the envelope, with the card, was a photocopy of two U.S. Postal keys on a magnet keychain. <b>The</b> <b>handwriting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> envelope resembles Zodiac's print, but was declared inauthentic by forensic document examiner Lloyd Cunningham. However, not all Zodiac experts agree with Cunningham's analysis. There is no return address on the envelope nor is his crossed-circle signature to be found. The card itself is unmarked.

500|$|Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{are brought}} in to {{investigate}} Surnow's death. Scully notes that {{another member of the}} research team, Arthur Grable, had mysteriously died several months earlier, and believes it to be a case of industrial espionage. Mulder examines <b>the</b> <b>handwriting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> team's whiteboard and concludes that it has been written by at least four different people, leading him to suspect that a fourth individual was present. Keats and Nollette both inform the agents that Roland Fuller was the only one left in the facility at the time of Surnow's death, but do not believe him to be capable of murder.|$|E
500|$|Given the {{high-profile}} of the case, the police received several tips from citizens. Police theorized that Fischer {{was killed by}} a drug gang that had mistaken him for someone else. They questioned a man alleged to be the intended victim, but the rumors turned out to be false. They also investigated an abandoned vehicle near the U.S.-Mexico border they suspected was used in the shooting. The car was reported stolen in South Padre Island, but detectives determined that it was not the vehicle the murderers used. The police continued to pursue the lead from the bail office in McKinney. They called the office and asked for recent bail applications from South Texas locations. The office gave them Cuellar's full name, his Dallas address, and faxed a copy of the application. Investigators noticed that the man's handwriting, specifically how the [...] "4" [...] was written, matched <b>the</b> <b>handwriting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> yellow business card found at the murder scene.|$|E

500|$|Historically, {{much of what}} {{is written}} about the Gunpowder Plot is derived from Thomas's confession, signed on 23 November 1605; details of the {{so-called}} Spanish Treason were added three days later. [...] One of only two confessions printed in the King's Book (a highly partial contemporary account of the affair), Thomas Wintour's was the only account the government had of a plotter who had been involved from the beginning; Guy Fawkes, weakened by days of torture, may have been {{at the heart of the}} group, but he was not at its first meetings. [...] However, Antonia Fraser views the document with suspicion, not least because Thomas's signature, 'Thomas Winter', differs from his normal signature, 'Thomas Wintour' (it was the former that was invariably used by the government). [...] The signature, possibly forged by lieutenant of the Tower of London William Waad, was made only weeks after Thomas had been shot in the shoulder during the siege at Holbeche House. [...] Biographer Mark Nicholls views the difference in signatures as a significant and puzzling lapse, if a [...] "master forger" [...] is presumed to be responsible for the document. [...] He views <b>the</b> <b>handwriting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> confession as [...] "convincingly that of Winter [...] ", pointing out that it appears to be the work of an author, not an editor, and written as a draft for the King's Book. [...] This is a view that generally, Alan Haynes agrees with: [...] "no one has ever made a solid and sensible suggestion about why a government-employed forger (say Thomas Phelippes) would deliberately make such an error in a crucial state document".|$|E
500|$|In 1934, Birkett {{acted as}} {{counsel for the}} second of the two Brighton trunk murders, a case which was {{described}} as [...] "his greatest triumph in a capital case". In June 1934, a woman's torso was found in a suitcase in Brighton railway station. The legs were discovered at King's Cross station the next day, but her head and arms were never found, and the case is still unsolved. A woman by the name of Violette Kaye had disappeared, and the appearance of the first woman's body prompted greater scrutiny on Kaye's case. On 14 July, they interviewed Toni Mancini, Kaye's boyfriend, who convinced them that the dead woman could not possibly be Kaye; the dead woman had been identified as around thirty five years old and five months pregnant, while Kaye was ten years older. Kaye was last seen alive on 10 May looking distressed in the doorway to her house and had been scheduled to visit her sister in London who received a telegram on 11 May reading [...] "Going abroad. Good job. Sail Sunday. Will write. Vi." [...] in block capitals. The post office clerks could not remember who sent it, but experts testified that <b>the</b> <b>handwriting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> telegram had similarities to that on a menu written by Mancini. On 14 May, with the help of another man, Mancini moved his belongings from the house he shared with Kaye, which included a large trunk which was too heavy to move by hand. Mancini had told people that he had broken up with Kaye and she had moved to Paris, and that before she left he had beaten her. He later said to a friend, [...] "What is the good of knocking a woman about with your fists? You only hurt yourself. You should hit her with a hammer same as I did and [...] her up." [...] A hammerhead was later found in the rubbish at his old house.|$|E

The show went unnoticed by WABC management, however, and Howard exited the station when he was replaced by WABC's first full-time talk show, Dr. Judith Kuriansky.|$|R
2500|$|A {{possible}} {{window into}} the killer's motives appeared nearly {{a month after the}} event. An apartment manager of a complex about a mile from Huff's residence called police about a possible bomb he found while inspecting dumpsters, although that bomb turned out to be just modeling clay and wires. In the investigation afterwards, police found a handwritten note in the dumpster apparently written by Huff. On June 6, the police released the letter, not yet authenticated, to the media. A week later, the Washington State Patrol's State Crime Lab concluded that it was [...] "highly probable" [...] that the letter was authentic. Arguments in favor of authenticity included the fact that the letter was written on stationery from the apartment complex where the Huff brothers lived and matched several known samples of the killer's writing, according to crime lab experts. The Stranger, an alternative weekly, earlier claimed that <b>the</b> <b>handwriting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> letter appeared to be identical to samples from a job application of Huff's that the periodical had obtained.|$|E

Carroll also provided Grant with a handwriting practice note that she found in Love's backpack that was left at her home.

5000|$|Kishore also criticizes Pushpa Prasad's {{conclusions}} about Inscription No. 53.4 as [...] "full of fancies and fictions". He disagrees with her contention that <b>the</b> <b>handwritings</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> two fragments look different. According to him, the topmost {{letters in the}} upper fragment are the smallest, and their size gradually increases towards {{the bottom of the}} upper fragment. The size increases further in the lower fragment. Kishore concludes that the engraver probably started with small letters, but then realized that the remaining space was more than sufficient, and therefore, gradually enlarged the letters. He further points out that several other historical inscriptions also feature variations in letter size, presenting the Prayaga prashasti of Samudragupta as an example. Kishore further notes that four letters broken in the upper fragment continue in the lower fragment, which clearly indicates that the two fragments belong to the same inscription. The surviving text appears to be Sanskrit verse written in the shardulavikridita metre. The surviving text, as deciphered by Bhavanath Jha, is unintelligible because the sentences are not complete. The extant words in each verse form only one-fourth of a typical shardulavikridita metre verse. Based on this, Kishore theorizes that the portion containing these two fragments formed the left part of a four-times larger inscription. The surviving text does not offer any evidence to show that the upper portion describes a land grant, or that the lower part describes invocation to a deity, thus invalidating Prasad's claim.|$|R
