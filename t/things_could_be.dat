5|$|Later {{chapters}} {{provide evidence}} that evolution has occurred, supporting the idea of branching, adaptive evolution without directly proving that selection is the mechanism. Darwin presents supporting facts drawn from many disciplines, showing that his theory could explain a myriad of observations from many fields of natural history that were inexplicable under the alternate concept that species had been individually created. The structure of Darwin's argument showed the influence of John Herschel, whose philosophy of science maintained that a mechanism could be called a vera causa (true cause) if three <b>things</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> demonstrated: its existence in nature, its ability to produce the effects of interest, {{and its ability to}} explain a wide range of observations.|$|E
25|$|Aurangzeb became viceroy of the Deccan {{again after}} he was {{replaced}} by Dara Shikoh {{in the attempt to}} recapture Kandahar. Aurangzeb regretted this and harboured feelings that Shikoh had manipulated the situation to serve his own ends. Aurangbad's two jagirs (land grants) were moved there as a consequence of his return and, because the Deccan was a relatively impoverished area, this caused him to lose out financially. So poor was the area that grants were required from Malwa and Gujarat {{in order to maintain the}} administration and the situation caused ill-feeling between father and son. Shah Jahan insisted that <b>things</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> improved if Aurangzeb made efforts to develop cultivation. Aurangzeb appointed Murshid Quli Khan to extend to the Deccan the zabt revenue system used in northern India. Murshid Quli Khan organised a survey of agricultural land and a tax assessment on what it produced. To increase revenue, Murshid Quli Khan granted loans for seed, livestock, and irrigation infrastructure. The Deccan returned to prosperity, but too slowly to satisfy the emperor.|$|E
500|$|In {{speculative}} fiction, extrapolation allows {{writers to}} focus {{not on the}} way things are (or were), as non-genre literature does, but on the way <b>things</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> different. It provides science fiction with a quality that science fiction critic Darko Suvin has called [...] "cognitive estrangement": the recognition that what we are reading is not the world as we know it, but a world whose differences force us to reconsider our own with an outsider's perspective. When the extrapolation involves sexuality or gender, it can force the reader to reconsider his or her heteronormative cultural assumptions; the freedom to imagine societies different from real-life cultures makes SF an effective tool for examining sexual bias. In science fiction, such estranging features include technologies that significantly alter sex or reproduction. In fantasy, such features include figures such as mythological deities and heroic archetypes, who are not limited by preconceptions of human sexuality and gender, allowing them to be reinterpreted. SF has also depicted a plethora of alien methods of reproduction and sex, some of which can be viewed as homo- or bisexual through a human binary-gender lens.|$|E

500|$|On January 15, 1996, Yankovic began {{recording}} the lead single for the album, [...] "Amish Paradise". Yankovic felt that parodying Coolio would pay off, because Coolio had [...] "such an identifiable image {{that a lot}} of <b>things</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> done [...] ". He noted, [...] "I like to play around with people that have some- you know, a lot of style as opposed to somebody who's kind of homogonized [...] and bland and has no personality, and Coolio certainly kind of sticks out in a crowd." [...] Yankovic felt that juxtaposing the original song's [...] "gangsta" [...] themes with the Amish lifestyle would produce a humorous end result. After Yankovic revealed to his label that he would be doing a Coolio parody, they requested that the album artwork for the release also parody Coolio. Yankovic had been toying with the name Bad Hair Day for a time and felt that he could adequately use the name and lampoon Coolio – who was known for his distinct hair style – at the same time. The final parody recorded for the album, [...] "Syndicated Inc.", is a parody of [...] "Misery" [...] by Soul Asylum, a loving ode to syndicated television.|$|E
500|$|E. H. Carr {{writes of}} Dostoevsky's {{character}} the young student Raskolnikov {{in the novel}} Crime and Punishment who decides to murder a 'vile and loathsome' old woman money lender {{on the principle of}} transcending conventional morals: [...] "the sequel reveals to us not the pangs of a stricken conscience (which a less subtle writer would have given us) but the tragic and fruitless struggle of a powerful intellect to maintain a conviction which is incompatible with the essential nature of man." [...] Hermann Hesse wrote his Siddhartha to describe how a young man in the time of the Buddha follows his conscience on a journey to discover a transcendent inner space where all <b>things</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> unified and simply understood, ending up discovering that personal truth through selfless service as a ferryman. J. R. R. Tolkien in his epic The Lord of the Rings describes how only the hobbit Frodo is pure enough in conscience to carry the ring of power through war-torn Middle-earth to destruction in the Cracks of Doom, Frodo determining at the end to journey without weapons, and being saved from failure by his earlier decision to spare the life of the creature Gollum. Conor Cruise O'Brien wrote that Albert Camus was the writer most representative of the Western consciousness and conscience in its relation to the non-Western world. Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird portrays Atticus Finch (played by Gregory Peck in the classic film from the book (see To Kill a Mockingbird (film))) as a lawyer true to his conscience who sets an example to his children and community.|$|E

Actuality is a realization of the way a <b>thing</b> <b>could</b> <b>be,</b> while potency refers simply to the way a <b>thing</b> <b>could</b> <b>be.</b> There are two levels to each: matter itself can be anything, and becomes something actually by causes, making it something which then {{has the ability to}} be in a certain way, and that ability can then be realized. The matter of an ax can be an ax, then is made into an ax. The ax thereby is able to cut, and reaches a new form of actuality in actually cutting.|$|R

2500|$|Lily Brett (born Lilijahne Brajtsztajn 5 September 1946, Feldafing {{displaced}} persons camp, Bavaria) is an Australian novelist, essayist and poet. She lived in North Carlton, Melbourne from 1948 to 1989 {{and then in}} New York City. In Australia she had an early career as a pop music journalist, including writing for teen magazine Go-Set from May 1966 to September 1968. From 1979 she started writing poems, prose fiction and non-fiction. As a daughter of Holocaust survivors, her works include depictions of family life including living in Melbourne and New York.

2500|$|Brett's first work of fiction, <b>Things</b> <b>Could</b> <b>Be</b> Worse, {{appeared}} in 1990.

[...] Green's fellow reviewer, Helen Elliott, felt Just Like That (1994) showed that [...] "The joke, and the entire seriousness of this brilliant novel, lies in the way Brett has turned the anguish of generations into art... has created an unusually lovely woman , full of laughter, torn with anxiety, capable of malice and brimming with love." ...|$|E
2500|$|Zuckerberg {{founded the}} Start-up: Education foundation. On September 22, 2010, it was {{reported}} that Zuckerberg had donated $100 million to Newark Public Schools, the public school system of Newark, New Jersey. Critics noted the timing of the donation as being close to the release of The Social Network, which painted a somewhat negative portrait of Zuckerberg. Zuckerberg responded to the criticism, saying, [...] "The thing that I was most sensitive about with the movie timing was, I didn't want the press about The Social Network movie to get conflated with the Newark project. I was thinking about doing this anonymously just so that the two <b>things</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> kept separate." [...] Newark Mayor Cory Booker stated that he and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie had to convince Zuckerberg's team not to make the donation anonymously.

2500|$|Another {{influence}} on Woolf was the American writer Henry David Thoreau, with Woolf {{writing in a}} 1917 essay that her aim as a writer was to follow Thoreau by capturing [...] "the moment, to burn always with this hard, gem-like flame" [...] while praising Thoreau for his statement [...] "The millions are awake enough for physical labor, but only one in hundreds of millions is awake enough to a poetic or divine life. To be awake is to be alive". Woolf praised Theoreau for his [...] "simplicity" [...] in finding [...] "a way for settling free the delicate and complicated machinery of the soul". Like Thoreau, Woolf {{believed that it was}} silence that set the mind free to really contemplate and understand the world. Both authors believed in a certain transcendental, mystical approach to life and writing, where even banal <b>things</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> capable of generating deep emotions if one had enough silence and {{the presence of mind to}} appreciate them. Woolf and Thoreau were both concerned with the difficulty of human relationships in the modern age.|$|E
2500|$|Acts deemed {{insulting}} to Bhumibol's image {{are also}} considered as criminal offences under {{the doctrine of}} [...] lèse-majesté in Thailand. This includes placing photographs of anybody on a website {{in such a way}} as to appear above photographs of the king. In March 2007 Oliver Jufer, a Swiss man, was sentenced to 10 years in jail for daubing black paint on portraits of Bhumibol while drunk in Chiang Mai, although he received a royal pardon the following month. Suwicha Thakor was arrested and sentenced to 20 years in prison, later commuted to 10, for posting a picture on an Internet web board that was deemed insulting to Bhumibol, thereby violating section 112 of the Criminal Code and violating the Computer Crime Act (CCA) of 2007. The CCA was passed by the military junta following the 2006 coup. Suwicha's conviction was the first time that it had been successfully used to prosecute lèse-majesté. A nurse wearing black on Bhumibol Adulyadej's birthday was charged with lèse majesté. In 2015, Prachatai published an infographic showing that bathroom graffiti, a hand gesture, a hearsay report of a taxi conversation, and not standing during the playing of the royal anthem, among other <b>things,</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> punished as acts of lèse-majesté.|$|E
2500|$|On the Raw Is War after Austin won the WWF Championship, Vince McMahon {{presented}} him with a new title belt and warned Austin {{that he did not}} approve of his rebellious nature and that <b>things</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> done [...] "the easy way or the hard way". Austin gave his answer in the form of another Stone Cold Stunner. This led to a segment a week later where Austin had pledged a few days prior in a meeting to [...] "play ball" [...] with McMahon, appearing in a suit and tie, with a beaming McMahon taking a picture of himself and his new corporate champion. The entire thing was a ruse by Austin who {{in the course of the}} segment proceeded to tear off the suit, tell McMahon it was the last time he would see Austin dressed like this, punch his boss in the [...] "corporate grapefruits" [...] and take another picture of the two of them while McMahon was doubled over in pain. In April 1998, it appeared Austin and McMahon were going to battle out their differences in an actual match, but the match was declared a no contest when Dude Love made an appearance. This led to a match between Dude Love and Austin at , where Austin hit McMahon with a steel chair, then the following month they had a rematch at [...] for the WWF Championship. Austin managed to retain the title despite McMahon acting as the referee and his [...] "Corporate Stooges" [...] (Gerald Brisco and Pat Patterson) as timekeeper and ring announcer, respectively. McMahon continued to do everything he could to ruin Austin and he finally scored a big victory for his side at King of the Ring, where Austin lost the WWF Championship to Kane in a First Blood match after the Undertaker intervened and hit him with a chair while the ref was incapacitated, despite Austin having knocked Kane unconscious and thwarted an earlier intervention by Mankind.|$|E
