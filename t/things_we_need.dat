25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} <b>things</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> to note in this myth is that the underworld controls the death of people.

If the Bible does not say these <b>things,</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> to fear God and be frightened of adding to His Word.|$|E

On 25 May, the DTRA issued the 5th Bomb Wing an [...] "unsatisfactory" [...] rating, the lowest rating possible, from the inspection. The 5th passed the inspection in nine of ten areas, but failed {{in the area of}} nuclear security. Following the inspection, Westa stated, [...] "Overall, their assessment painted a picture of some <b>things</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> to work on in the areas of training and discipline". The 5th Bomb Wing Security Forces Squadron Commander, Lieutenant Colonel John Worley, was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Stephen Weaver on 16 June 2008. In spite of failing the NSI, the wing kept its nuclear certification. Said Hans Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists about the 5th's failure in the inspection, [...] "It makes you wonder what's going on elsewhere, like the nuclear weapons stationed at bases overseas, and at Barksdale Air Force Base and Whiteman Air Force Base." [...] Minot passed the follow-up inspection on 15 August 2008.|$|E

2500|$|In {{one of his}} 1988 columns, Steimel aimed his pen at the United States Congress and {{the liberal}} {{majority}} elected in 1986 {{in the last two}} years of the administration of U.S. President Ronald W. Reagan. Steimel objected to an increase in the minimum wage, a measure which he said would [...] "wreak havoc [...] with the very individuals it is designed to help most -- new entrants into the work force and new minority workers in particular." [...] He called the 1988 legislative session the [...] "John Galt Congress", borrowing from Ayn Rand's novel Atlas Shrugged, in which uninformed people merely shrug their shoulders and ask [...] "Who is John Galt"?" [...] whenever they are questioned about the grip of expanded government on their lives and liberty. A few days later, Steimel wrote that in the United States [...] "political power usually gravitates to where public money is most available. ... We need our own money spent in our own community for <b>things</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> or want to improve our quality of life." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Huskies, with a 5–2–1 {{record to}} this point, entered their November 4–5 home series against Minnesota State ranked #16 in the USCHO.com poll. It {{was the first}} time the team had been nationally ranked in four years. The first game turned into a [...] "battle [...] two hot goaltenders", and the only goal {{occurred}} on a Michigan Tech power play when Ryan Furne's 90‑foot shot toward Mavericks goaltender Austin Lee [...] "took a strange hop just outside the crease" [...] and crossed the goal line. Minnesota State failed to score on six power play opportunities and Josh Robinson stopped all 29shots. In the second game, Huskies goals from Jacob Johnstone, Blake Pietila and Tanner Kero were matched by Minnesota State, and the game was tied 3–3 after two periods. The Mavericks took advantage of Michigan Tech's penalties and sloppy defensive play in the third period and scored two more goals against Josh Robinson, plus an empty-net goal, to win the game 6–3. [...] "It's tough to lose at home like that, but we're going into an off week, and we have a lot of time to fix <b>things</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> to get better at", said Brett Olson.|$|E

60|$|And {{so far as}} {{deficiencies}} go, {{there is}} a great multitude of modern problems--problems that enter intimately into the moral life of all of us, with which the Bible does not deal, the establishment of American Independence, for example, and the age-long feud of Russia and Poland that has gone on with varying fortunes for four centuries. That is much more important to our modern world than the ancient conflict of Assyria and Egypt which plays so large a part in the old Bible record. And {{there are all sorts of}} moral problems arising out of modern conditions on which the Bible sheds little or no direct light: the duties of a citizen at an election, or the duties of a shareholder to the labour employed by his company, for example. For these <b>things</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> at least a supplement, if we are still to keep our community upon one general basis of understanding, upon one unifying standard of thought and behaviour.|$|E

60|$|Well, you may say, {{no doubt}} {{this is right}} {{so far as it}} goes; {{existing}} local government areas do not represent real countries, but still these local government devices are of service for cutting up and distributing administrative work. But that is exactly what they are not. They are worse when you consider them in regard to function, than when you consider them in regard to representation. Since our conceptions of what constitutes a local administrative area were developed there has arisen the problems of water supply and of organized sewage, of railways, tramways, and communications generally, and of lighting and telephonic intercourse; there hangs over us, though the average local authority has no eyes to see it, the necessity of adapting our roads to accommodate an increasing new traffic of soft-tyred vehicles, and it is not improbable that heating by wholesale, either by gas or electricity, will presently be also possible and desirable. For all these <b>things</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> wide views, wide minds and wide areas, and still more do we want wide views for the business of education that is now also coming into the sphere of local administration.|$|E

"In {{the end of}} November, Marechal Duc de Belleisle, {{with his}} Brother the Chevalier (now {{properly}} the Count, there having been promotions), and a great retinue more, alights at Munchen; holds counsel with the poor Kaiser for certain days:--Money wanted; many things wanted; and all <b>things,</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> not doubt, much fallen out of square. 'Those Seckendorf troops in their winter-quarters,' say our French Inspectors and Segur people, as usual, 'do but look on it, your Excellency! Scattered, along the valleys, into {{the very edge of}} Austria; Austria will swallow them, the first thing, next year; they will never rendezvous again except in the Austrian prisons. Surely, Monseigneur, only a man ignorant of war, or with treasonous intention [or ill-off for victuals],--could post troops in that way? Seckendorf is not ignorant of war!' say they. [Valori, i. 206.] For, in fact, suspicion runs high; and there is no end to the accusations just and unjust; and Seckendorf is as ill treated as any of us could wish. Poor old soul. Probably nobody in all the Earth, but his old Wife in the Schloss of Altenburg, has any pity for him,--if even she, which I hope. He has fought and diplomatized and intrigued in many countries, very much; and in his old days is hard bested. Monseigueur, whose part is rather that of Jove the Cloud-compeller, is studious to be himself noiseless amid this noise; and makes no alteration in the Seckendorf troops; but it is certain he meant to do it, thinks Valori." ...|$|E
6000|$|In this matter, then, {{as in all}} {{the other}} matters treated in this book, our main {{conclusion}} {{is that it is}} a fundamental point of view, a philosophy or religion which is needed, and not any change in habit or social routine. The <b>things</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> most for immediate practical purposes are all abstractions. We need a right view of the human lot, a right view of the human society; and if we were living eagerly and angrily in the enthusiasm of those things, we should, ipso facto, be living simply in the genuine and spiritual sense. Desire and danger make every one simple. And to those who talk to us with interfering eloquence about Jaeger and the pores of the skin, and about Plasmon and the coats of the stomach, at them shall only be hurled the words that are hurled at fops and gluttons, [...] "Take no thought what ye shall eat or what ye shall drink, or wherewithal ye shall be clothed. For after all these things do the Gentiles seek. But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you." [...] Those amazing words are not only extraordinarily good, practical politics; they are also superlatively good hygiene. The one supreme way of making all those processes go right, the processes of health, and strength, and grace, and beauty, the one and only way of making certain of their accuracy, is to think about something else. If a man is bent on climbing into the seventh heaven, he may be quite easy about the pores of his skin. If he harnesses his waggon to a star, the process will have a most satisfactory effect upon the coats of his stomach. For the thing called [...] "taking thought," [...] the thing for which the best modern word is [...] "rationalizing," [...] is in its nature, inapplicable to all plain and urgent things. Men take thought and ponder rationalistically, touching remote things--things that only theoretically matter, such as the transit of Venus. But only at their peril can men rationalize about so practical a matter as health.|$|E
