5|$|One day Narendra {{requested}} Ramakrishna to pray to goddess Kali {{for their}} family's financial welfare. Ramakrishna suggested {{him to go}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>temple</b> himself and pray. Following Ramakrishna's suggestion, he went <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>temple</b> thrice, but failed to pray {{for any kind of}} worldly necessities and ultimately prayed for true knowledge and devotion from the goddess. Narendra gradually grew ready to renounce everything for the sake of realising God, and accepted Ramakrishna as his Guru.|$|E

5|$|The Chariot {{festival is}} the most {{prominent}} festival of the temple, and for the surrounding villages.

Verses from Nalayira Divya Prabandham are recited {{by a group of}} temple priests amidst music with nagaswaram (pipe instrument) and tavil (percussion instrument). The chariot festival is unique in the state as a community feast is offered by several individuals and committees, a custom many centuries old. The processional idols of Pundarikakshan and Pankajavalli are brought <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>temple</b> car early in the morning amidst religious chanting.

5|$|The Royal Stoa {{was built}} upon the artificially raised {{portion of the}} Temple Mount platform. Arches {{underneath}} supported the columns of the Stoa, and provided service areas for the structures above. The Huldah Gates {{at the bottom of}} the southern wall led through corridors beneath the Stoa, rising <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Temple</b> plaza, and served as the main entrance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Temple</b> compound for worshipers. Additional passages led to storage areas, and possibly provided secondary access to the Stoa and the Temple beyond. An arched overpass on the eastern side of the Temple Mount led to a gate which opened into the so-called Solomon's Stables just beneath the eastern end of the Stoa. It is widely assumed that at least part of this area was used as a storage area in conjunction with business conducted in the Stoa.|$|E

5|$|A boat draws up on {{the beach}} bearing the veiled figure of Leila, the virgin priestess whose prayers are {{required}} {{to ensure the safety of}} the fishermen.

As Zurga is explaining her duties, she recognises Nadir, but she says nothing and shortly afterwards is led up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>temple</b> by the high priest Nourabad. Zurga and the fishermen go down to the sea, leaving Nadir alone. In a troubled soliloquy before he sleeps he recalls how, in Kandy, he had broken his vows to Zurga and pursued his love for the veiled woman (""). It was the rumour that she might be found in this place that brought him here. Alone in the temple, Leila prays and sings. Nadir wakes and, recognising the voice of his long-desired lover, traces it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>temple.</b> Leila briefly draws her veil aside, he sees it is she and the pair declare their renewed passion. On the beach, the fishermen plead with her to continue protecting them, but she tells Nadir she will sing for him alone ("").|$|E
