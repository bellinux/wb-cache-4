25|$|Since the 1980s, {{claims have}} arisen that quilt designs {{were used to}} signal and direct slaves to escape routes and assistance. According to advocates of the quilt theory, ten quilt {{patterns}} were used to direct slaves to take particular actions. <b>The</b> <b>quilts</b> were placed {{one at a time}} on a fence as a means of nonverbal communication to alert escaping slaves. The code had a dual meaning: first to signal slaves to prepare to escape, and second to give clues and indicate directions on the journey.|$|E
500|$|Beresford, {{known for}} {{carefully}} planning every shot in his films, drew his own storyboards {{as well as}} detailed drawings of how he envisioned the sets. Jeannine Oppewall was hired as art director. Beresford praised her as [...] "absolutely brilliant", especially for her attention to very small details, [...] "going from the curtains {{to the color of}} <b>the</b> <b>quilts</b> on the floors." [...] It was Oppewall who named the motel Mariposa, Spanish for [...] "butterfly", which symbolizes the spiritual resurrection Mac Sledge would experience there. Beresford chose the Australian Russell Boyd as cinematographer and the Irish William Anderson, who had worked on all of the director's previous features, as editor. He selected Elizabeth McBride as costume designer. It was her first time in the position on a feature film, and she went on to build a reputation for costuming Texan and other Southern characters.|$|E

2500|$|James {{describes}} <b>the</b> <b>quilts</b> he {{made between}} 1992 and 1995 as a “last hurrah” for the strip-pieced panel technique, {{and it is}} for the work that he produced during this period that he is best known. [...] David Lyon and Patricia Harris wrote in Art & Inspirations: Michael James, a retrospective published by C Publishing in 1998, that <b>the</b> <b>quilts</b> from this period “capture the artist {{at the height of his}} form.” [...] Beginning with Bourrée and Lush Life, James arrived upon a strategy that allowed for greater freedom of design. [...] The shapes were looser, more fluid and more dynamic. [...] In Art Quilt, Robert Shaw describes the quilt surfaces as being “built from graffiti-like forms” that are “large, interlocking” and “abstract” and have moved beyond the “repeating motif.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Many {{consider}} strip-piecing to be James’s signature style. [...] His pieced panels eventually grew {{to encompass}} 36 strips of fabric, each measuring ¾ to 1 inch wide, and were arranged in “luminous” [...] runs of graded color and value. [...] <b>The</b> <b>quilts</b> themselves could include up to 150 different colors with increasingly intricate compositions that required dozens of templates. [...] It was for this work, too, that {{he earned his}} reputation as a colorist.|$|E
2500|$|He {{experimented with}} digital imagery and {{produced}} his own fabric using images from photographs that he modified in CAD programs, like Photoshop and Illustrator. [...] The subjects varied from textured walls and graffiti, to fish, faces, leaves and grass, particularly from his trips to Japan. [...] <b>The</b> <b>quilts</b> were assembled {{in a fashion}} similar to the pieces in his Icon-era, using distinct, often “visually paradoxical” panels. [...] They had become less formal and more “poetic." ...|$|E

2500|$|One of {{her earlier}} movies was Tender Mercies, a 1983 film about an {{alcoholic}} country singer played by Robert Duvall. Director Bruce Beresford praised Oppewall as [...] "absolutely brilliant," [...] especially for {{her attention to}} very small details, [...] "going from the curtains {{to the color of}} <b>the</b> <b>quilts</b> on the floors." [...] A large portion of the movie was filmed in the home of Duvall's character, which Beresford created from an old house that had been sitting abandoned by a highway in Waxahachie, Texas, where the majority of the movie was filmed.|$|E
2500|$|As James’s work progressed {{through the}} mid to late 1980s, the grid {{composition}} in his designs became increasingly obscure. [...] He strove to eliminate the traditional quilt block construction method from his work completely, as he felt that it was becoming “too predictable.” [...] By 1988, his quilts were still designed upon a gridded foundation, but the construction of the quilt tops no longer relied upon square blocks. [...] The shapes were more irregular. [...] Between 1986 and 1989, he experimented with the overall silhouette of the quilt, as well, breaking out of the standard, rectangular format. [...] He had made a small series of Suntreader quilts in the late 70s that were circular in shape, but <b>the</b> <b>quilts</b> of the late 80s took greater liberties with the frame. [...] His work was being described by newspapers and magazine articles of the time as “spacially complex," [...] “airy”, and “full of light and movement.” ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{remarkable}} occurrence, which attracted wide-spread interest, {{was connected}} with the family of John Bell, who settled near what is now Adams Station about 1804. So great was the excitement that people came from hundreds of miles around to witness the manifestations of what was popularly known as the [...] "Bell Witch." [...] This witch {{was supposed to be}} some spiritual being having the voice and attributes of a woman. It was invisible to the eye, yet it would hold conversation and even shake hands with certain individuals. The freaks it performed were wonderful, and seemingly designed to annoy the family. It would take the sugar from the bowls, spill the milk, take <b>the</b> <b>quilts</b> from the beds, slap and pinch the children, and then laugh at the discomfiture of its victims. At first {{it was supposed to be}} a good spirit, but its subsequent acts, together with the curses with which it supplemented its remarks, proved the contrary. A volume might be written concerning the performances of this wonderful being, as they are now described by contemporaries and their descendants. That all this actually occurred will not be disputed, nor will a rational explanation be attempted. It is merely introduced as an example of superstition, strong in the minds of all but a few in those times, and not yet wholly extinct.|$|E
25|$|Before {{actually}} quilting fabrics, some quilters baste <b>the</b> <b>quilt.</b> Basting is <b>the</b> {{practice of}} making long, loose stitches in a grid format {{across the surface}} of <b>the</b> <b>quilt</b> to hold <b>the</b> layers of <b>the</b> <b>quilt</b> together and to prevent them from shifting during the quilting process. Basting can also be done using large curved safety pins rather than machine or hand basting.|$|R

25|$|There are {{generally}} three layers in a quilt: <b>the</b> <b>quilt</b> top, <b>the</b> middle layer of batting, and the fabric backing. <b>The</b> <b>quilt</b> top is <b>the</b> design layer. The cotton or polyester batting {{in the middle}} layer is what determines the warmth of <b>the</b> <b>quilt.</b> Batting comes in different thicknesses depending on the purpose of <b>the</b> final <b>quilt,</b> and multiple layers of batting can be combined to increase {{the warmth of the}} final product. The bottom layer is often a simple layer of solid fabric, in a neutral or complimentary color and design scheme, though some quilters use the extra or spare fabric from <b>the</b> <b>quilt</b> top to make a secondary design for the backing.|$|R

From four {{o'clock in the morning}} till nearly noon they toiled across the sod, now ploughing through the deep snow where the unburned grass had held it, now scraping across the bare, burned earth, now wandering up or down the swales, seeking the shallowest places, now shovelling a pathway through.|$|E
60|$|Often {{at night}} {{as he saw}} her lying asleep, her long lashes upon her {{roughened}} sun-burned skin, his heart went out {{to her in a}} great gush of tenderness. His throat ached and his eyes grew wet as he thought how unresponsive he had been that day. His remorseful memory went back over her eager questions to which he had not replied. Dear, sweet, restless little heart! And then he vowed never to lose patience with her again. And sometimes standing there beside her bed his arms closed about the little mound under <b>the</b> <b>quilts,</b> and his lips touched the round, sleep-enraptured face. At such times his needy soul went out in a cry to his dead wife for help to care for his child.|$|E

But {{there was no one in}} sight, and no one was likely to be; so he returned, and summoning all his resolution, took one of <b>the</b> <b>quilts</b> from the bed and placed it in the bottom of the box.

Each had a perceptible thickness and a rounded loglike edge; and when the time came for turning in on top of the lot, I was always reminded of the latter end of a Grecian hero, the structure looked so like a funeral pyre. When to the above indispensables were added clothes, camera, dry plates, books, and sundries, it made a collection of household gods quite appalling to consider on the march. I had no idea I owned half so much in the world from which it would pain me to be parted. As my property lay spread out for packing, I stared at it aghast.|$|E
