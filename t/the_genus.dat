40|$|We {{introduce}} a new link invariant called <b>the</b> algebraic <b>genus,</b> which gives an upper bound for <b>the</b> topological slice <b>genus</b> of links. In fact, <b>the</b> algebraic <b>genus</b> is an upper bound for another version of <b>the</b> slice <b>genus</b> proposed here: <b>the</b> minimal <b>genus</b> of a surface in the four-ball whose complement has infinite cyclic fundamental group. We examine the relationship of <b>the</b> algebraic <b>genus</b> and <b>the</b> Seifert form, the algebraic unknotting number, and other knot invariants. One of the strengths of <b>the</b> algebraic <b>genus</b> is that it yields simply computable good upper bounds for <b>the</b> topological slice <b>genus.</b> <b>The</b> paper also contains {{a discussion of the}} optimality of slice genus bounds, employing Casson-Gordon invariants.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>genus</b> Ochetellus {{was first}} {{described}} by Steve Shattuck in 1992, {{placing it in}} the subfamily Dolichoderinae.

5|$|The {{hooded pitohui}} {{was placed in}} <b>the</b> <b>genus</b> Pitohui with five other species, and <b>the</b> <b>genus</b> was thought to reside within the Australasian {{whistler}} family (Pachycephalidae). A 2008 examination of <b>the</b> <b>genus,</b> however, {{found it to be}} polyphyletic (meaning that <b>the</b> <b>genus</b> contained unrelated species), with some purported members of <b>the</b> <b>genus</b> not actually falling within the whistlers. The hooded pitohui and the closely related variable pitohui were both found {{to be related to the}} Old World orioles (Oriolidae). A 2010 study by the same team confirmed that the hooded pitohui and variable pitohui were orioles and indeed were sister species, and that together with the figbirds they formed a well defined basal clade within the family. As the variable pitohui was the type species for <b>the</b> <b>genus</b> Pitohui, the hooded pitohui was retained in that genus and the four remaining species were moved to other genera.|$|E
5|$|The rufous-crowned sparrow was {{described}} in 1852 by American ornithologist John Cassin as Ammodramus ruficeps. It has also been described as belonging to <b>the</b> <b>genus</b> Peucaea, which contains several sparrows in <b>the</b> <b>genus</b> Aimophila that share characteristics, such as a larger bill and a patch of yellow under the bend of the wing, that other members of <b>the</b> <b>genus</b> do not. However, splitting the Peucaea sparrows into a separate genus is not generally recognized. A 2008 phylogenetic analysis of <b>the</b> <b>genus</b> Aimophila divided it into four genera, with the rufous-crowned sparrow and its two closest relatives, the Oaxaca sparrow and rusty sparrow, being maintained as <b>the</b> <b>genus</b> Aimophila. In addition, this study suggested that the rufous-crowned sparrow may be {{more closely related to}} the brown towhees of <b>the</b> <b>genus</b> Pipilo than {{the other members of the}} historical genus Aimophila.|$|E
5|$|Amylostereaceae {{species were}} {{for a long}} time {{classified}} in <b>the</b> <b>genus</b> Stereum, based primary on the layered structure of the fruit body and the similar physiological activity. Mycologist Jacques Boidin separated Amylosterum from Stereum in 1958, justifying this decision by explaining that microscopic differences such as amyloid spores and encrusted cystidia were sufficiently distinct to warrant recognition as a new genus. Although the type species of <b>the</b> <b>genus</b> (today called A.chailletii) was initially named Trichocarpus ambiguus, the name Trichocarpus had already been used for a genus in the flowering plant family Malvaceae. Boidin thus chose <b>the</b> <b>genus</b> name Amylostereum, referring to the amyloid spores.|$|E
