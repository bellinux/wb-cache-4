5|$|Inducted members, {{known as}} Arrowmen or Brothers, are {{organized}} into local youth-led lodges that harbor fellowship, promote camping, and render service to Boy Scout councils and their communities. Members wear identifying insignia on their uniforms, most notably <b>the</b> <b>OA</b> pocket flap that represents their individual OA lodge and <b>the</b> <b>OA</b> sash worn at official OA functions. <b>The</b> <b>OA</b> program sponsors several events, awards, and training functions.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to training courses available at a NOAC or section conclave, <b>the</b> <b>OA</b> offers specialized leadership training as weekend events for members: Lodge Leadership Development (LLD), National Leadership Seminars (NLS), and National Lodge Adviser Training Seminar (NLATS). LLD is a one-day or two-day event {{conducted by a}} lodge to train their officers and advisers. NLS's are conducted by regions for lodge officers and advisers. Many lodges send key officers to receive training. Typically, each region schedules three or four NLS weekends annually, at geographically dispersed locations within the region. NLATS is a training event for adults, usually held in conjunction with an NLS and conducted by regions, {{on the role of}} advisers in <b>the</b> <b>OA.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Order of the Arrow (OA) is {{a program}} of the Boy Scout {{division}} of the BSA. It is the BSA's national honor society for experienced campers, based on Native American traditions, and dedicated to the ideal of cheerful service. Scouts and Scouters must belong to a troop or team to become OA members. <b>The</b> <b>OA</b> is run by youths {{under the age of}} 21 with adult Scouters serving as advisers.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>OA</b> Universal Ribbon is worn {{suspended}} from the right uniform shirt pocket button. Vigil Honor recipients may add the Vigil Honor pin to the ribbon. Lodge affiliation is indicated by the wearing of the lodge emblem (commonly known as a lodge flap), an embroidered patch is worn on the right pocket flap of the uniform shirt. Each lodge flap has a unique design, generally reflecting the name, geography or history of the lodge. Special issues of flaps may be created to commemorate anniversaries and other events and are a popular item for those who engage in Scouting memorabilia collecting.|$|E
5|$|Arrowmen are {{identified}} {{by a white}} sash bearing a red arrow that is worn over their right shoulder. An Ordeal member wears a sash with a lone arrow.

A Vigil Honor member wears a sash with the same bars of as the Brotherhood sash {{at each end of the}} arrow, and a Vigil Honor triangle on the center of the shaft. Members wear the sash at Order of the Arrow functions and special Scouting activities when members need to be identified as Arrowmen rendering special services. <b>The</b> <b>OA</b> sash is not worn at the same time as the merit badge sash, nor worn folded in the belt. The sash as a form of recognition dates to the founding of the Order and has a long history of changes in usage and design.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{investigate}} anti-endotoxin {{action of}} four OAs reacted with endotoxin by the LAL assay with KTA. MethodsUsing a incubating kinetic tube reader and kinetic turbidimetric assay (KTA), the concentration-response time curve of endotoxin reacted with {{limulus amebocyte lysate}} (LAL) at 37 °C were obtained and the action of four organic acids (OAs) on it were investigated. <b>The</b> four <b>OAs</b> were benzoic acid, salicylic acid, syringic acid and 2 -amino-benzoic acid from Radix isatidis. Meanwhile, the temperature variation caused by endotoxin with <b>the</b> four <b>OAs</b> was studied by the rabbit pyrogen test (RPT). ResultsIt was showed that a low concentration (1 mg/mL) of <b>the</b> four <b>OAs</b> had a little effect of anti-endotoxin, and when the concentrations of <b>the</b> four <b>OAs</b> were 30 mg/mL, the endotoxin was neutralized completely. The relationships between the concentrations of endotoxin and <b>the</b> <b>OAs</b> were all linear with correlation coefficients of greater than 0. 9995, indicating that <b>the</b> four <b>OAs</b> all had strong anti-endotoxin action, while syringic acid had the strongest action among <b>the</b> four <b>OAs</b> with IC 50 of 12. 84 mg/mL. ConclusionThe investigations of KTA agreed well with the results obtained by means of RPT...|$|R
30|$|In TOAT, two OAs—called <b>the</b> inner <b>OA</b> {{and outer}} OA—are usually {{employed}} for the tests. <b>The</b> inner <b>OA</b> is for generating combinations of controllable variables, and <b>the</b> outer <b>OA</b> is for uncontrollable variables. These two OAs simultaneously determine {{a combination of}} variables. For simplicity and clarity, the test results are separately discussed for these two OAs hereinafter.|$|R
5|$|The National Order of the Arrow Conference (NOAC) is a multi-day event {{which usually}} {{takes place on}} a {{university}} campus, bringing together thousands of delegates from OA lodges around the nation for training and activities. NOACs are held every two years, with exceptions made to align the event with significant anniversaries. As a youth-led organization, these national conferences are organized and directed by the elected section and region youth officers, who serve on committees responsible for various conference aspects {{under the leadership of}} the conference vice-chief. Events include training for programs, leadership and American Indian culture; competitions in athletics, ceremonies, cooking and American Indian dances; and exhibits on OA history, outdoor activities, and camping. There are also opportunities to talk with national leaders, perform service work and trade patches. Evening shows have different themes, including American Indian culture and recognition of dance competition winners, presentations of awards including <b>the</b> <b>OA</b> Distinguished Service Award and other entertainment.|$|E

The majority (95 %) of T. solium tapeworm carriers had antibodies to these OAs, while only 20 % of active neurocysticercosis cases were positive. No antibodies to <b>the</b> <b>OAs</b> were found in healthy controls, subjects infected with Hymenolepis nana, patients with hydatid disease, T. saginata tapeworm carriers, hamsters infected with immature T. solium tapeworms, or dogs infected with Echinococcus granulosus. <b>The</b> <b>OAs</b> are stage and species specific to T. solium and antibodies to OAs are usually present in tapeworm carriers...|$|R
