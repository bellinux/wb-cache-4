(Political) order is not understood as an artificial man-made construct, but as an intelligible structure of the whole, which is to be attuned to. Disastrous experiences of the last century led Voegelin to the attempt at rediscovery of the science of order: politiké epistemé. To this end he pursued a detailed study concerning history, i. e. the subject in which he hoped to find structures of order and, in particular, the experience of order in soul of man. Therefore it is possible -in his view- to reflect on political order adequately only after we have attended to philosophical anthropology which should facilitate the detection of constants of human nature. These appear against a background of unexceeded <b>tension</b> between <b>poles</b> of God and man. In the first chapter of the main part, I discuss the relationship between the human and transcendent pole and I try to clarify Voegelin's conception of metaxy (also participation of the human on the transcendent pole).

50|$|During the {{different}} stages of mitosis, one could see that survivin follows a certain localization pattern. At prophase and metaphase, survivin is mainly nuclear in location. During prophase, as the chromatin condenses {{so that it is}} visible under the microscope, survivin starts to move to the centromeres. At prometaphase when the nuclear membrane dissociates and spindle microtubules cross over the nuclear region, survivin stays put at the centromeres. At metaphase, when the chromosomes align at the middle plate and are pulled with high <b>tension</b> to either <b>pole</b> by the kinetochore attachments, survivin then associates with the kinetochores. At anaphase as separation of the chromatids happens, the kinetochore microtubules shorten as the chromosomes move towards to the spindle poles and survivin also moves along to the midplate. Survivin thus accumulates at the midplate at telophase. Finally, survivin localizes to the midbody at the cleavage furrow.|$|R

After briefly outlining the pioneering {{role played by}} Unigwe’s “Afro-European” fiction in Belgium, the essay argues that the author’s latest book presents its heroines, four African prostitutes working in Antwerp, as individuals caught between two forces: on the one hand, {{the social and economic}} pressures that lead to their subjection and, on the other, their wish to satisfy their own aspirations, which relates to the expression of their subjectivity. The article attempts to demonstrate that Unigwe’s novel explores the <b>tension</b> between these <b>poles</b> in at least four different ways: first of all, by using cultural stereotypes in an original manner; secondly, by developing the themes of renaming, slavery and objectification to point to the characters’ exploitation; thirdly, by hinting at the potential role of storytelling in the restoration of the prostitutes’ identity; and finally, by suggesting that the women’s very quest for subjectivity sometimes inadvertently induces their subjection. The essay concludes that Unigwe’s subtle treatment of these issues emphasises the complexity both of the novel’s protagonists and of their relationship with each other. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Proof and {{deductive}} method in mathematics have their {{origin in the}} classic model of exposition developed by Euclid in his famous book on Elements. The attitude of mathematicians towards this method has certainly evolved in the past centuries, but the relationship between understanding and acceptability of mathematical statements has not dramatically changed and still constitutes a characterising element of this discipline. This paper is aimed at explaining and discussing some aspects which may be considered at the origin of difficulties related to proof; in particular, it focusses on the <b>tension</b> between two <b>poles,</b> that of production and that of systematisation of mathematical knowledge. Some examples drawn from different research projects are presented with the aim of illustrating the complementarity of various aspects and problems concerning proof. In the first part, the theoretical construct of Cognitive Unity is used to analyse and interpret the relationship between the production of a conjecture and its proof. In the second part, we present two long-term teaching experiments that are part of a research project whose principal goal is to introduce pupils to theoretical thinking and to study the role of particular microworlds in the teaching/learning processes. Assuming a Vygotskian perspective, attention is focussed on the semiotic mediation accomplished through cultural artefacts; in the case of Geometry the microworld is Cabri-géomètr, in the case of algebra the microworld is the prototype "L'Algebrista" (designed and realized by our team) ...|$|R
40|$|The spindle {{checkpoint}} {{ensures that}} newly born cells receive one copy of each chromosome by preventing chromosomes from segregating {{until they are}} all correctly attached to the spindle. The checkpoint monitors tension to distinguish between correctly aligned chromosomes and those with both sisters attached to the same spindle <b>pole.</b> <b>Tension</b> arises when sister kinetochores attach to and are pulled toward opposite poles, stretching the chromatin around centromeres and elongating kinetochores. We distinguished between two hypotheses for where the checkpoint monitors tension: between the kinetochores, by detecting alterations in the distance between them, or by responding {{to changes in the}} structure of the kinetochore itself. To distinguish these models, we inhibited chromatin stretch by tethering sister chromatids together by binding a tetrameric form of the Lac repressor to arrays of the Lac operator located on either side of a centromere. Inhibiting chromatin stretch did not activate the spindle checkpoint; these cells entered anaphase at the same time as control cells that express a dimeric version of the Lac repressor, which cannot cross link chromatids, and cells whose checkpoint has been inactivated. There is no dominant checkpoint inhibition when sister kinetochores are held together: cells expressing the tetrameric Lac repressor still arrest in response to microtubule-depolymerizing drugs. Tethering chromatids together does not disrupt kinetochore function; chromosomes are successfully segregated to opposite poles of the spindle. Our results indicate that the spindle checkpoint does not monitor inter-kinetochore separation, thus supportin...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} Irish modernist literature {{in order to}} complicate established critical modes which read modernist movements as reflective of distinctly vernacular or cosmopolitan aesthetic and political commitments. I argue that neither recent models of vernacular modernism nor older models of cosmopolitan modernism entirely account for the stylistic innovations and formal experiments of modernist literature. Instead, modernist writers negotiate a field of <b>tension</b> between the <b>poles</b> of cosmopolitan and vernacular, and demonstrate that their works represent forms of identity that accommodate elements of both national belonging and cosmopolitan individualism. Examining works by four authors - William Butler Yeats, Elizabeth Bowen, Samuel Beckett, and Raymond Queneau - this project argues that modernist literature represents a set of idiosyncratic, dynamic efforts to negotiate the tensions between {{the limits of the}} nation-state system and a variety of emerging transnational modes of cultural exchange {{in the late nineteenth and}} early twentieth centuries. The nature of modernist writers' efforts to negotiate a period of passage between national and global systems of exchange is, I think, especially visible in the case of Irish modernism. Ireland's transition from a part of the United Kingdom to an independent nation-state in the interwar period makes that nation's literature an exemplary case for my argument, as does the critical importance of Irish writing in the modernist canon. By examining these and other critical and historical perspectives alongside a sampling of plays, novels, short stories, and memoirs, this study makes the case that modernist literary aesthetics spring from writers' efforts to make sense of competing desires for national belonging and cosmopolitan autonomy. Focusing on works that cross categorical boundaries between Irish and cosmopolitan modernism, this study traces the ways in which modernist aesthetics construct dynamic, adaptive relationships between the global and the national, and suggest that we can imagine them as something other than static, exclusive alternatives.

This {{section of the}} movement merged into the larger Ukrainophile current, which brought together partisans and sympathizers of Ukrainian nationalism irrespective of cultural or ethnic background. Russian scholar Aleksei I. Miller defines the social makeup of some chłopomania groups (whose members are known as chłopomani or khlopomany) in terms of reversed acculturation: [...] "Khlopomany were young people from Polish or traditionally Polonized families who, due to their populist convictions, rejected social and cultural belonging to their stratum and strove to approach the local peasantry." [...] Similarly, Canadian researcher John-Paul Himka describes the Ukrainian chłopomani as [...] "primarily Poles of Right Bank Ukraine", noting that their contribution was in line with a tradition of [...] "Ukrainophile" [...] cooperation against the Russians and the Russophiles. In reference to the cultural crossover between the two ethnic versions of chłopomania, French historian Daniel Beauvois noted that [...] "in certain numbers", chłopomani from within the Polish gentry contributed to [...] "reinforcing the Ukrainian movement". Miller however focuses on the movement's role in exacerbating <b>tensions</b> between Ukrainians, <b>Poles</b> and the Russian administrators. He writes: [...] "The government could not but rejoice {{at the fact that}} some khlopomany renounced their Catholic faith, converted to Orthodoxy, and refused to support the Polish national movement. However, the Polish ill-wishers were quick to draw the government's attention to the subversive flavor of the khlopomanys social views and their pro-Ukrainophile orientation. The authorities were more often than not inclined to pay heed to these accusations, being guided more by the instinct of social solidarity with Polish landowners than by the strategy of national confrontation with the Poles." ...|$|R

For it searches in one hand {{to piece together the}} history of the living beings from their origins and in another hand to explain the working biological mechanisms in this process.

Thus the patterns of evolution are studied in the framework of an historical science and the process in the one of an experimental science. In this article, we will try to know how the scholar institution integrates these different focuses. The analysis of the programs of studied subjects in Biology and Geology for Secondary School puts light on the epistemological positions of the scholar institution {{on the nature of the}} Sciences of the Living as well as its implication in the proposed processings of teaching. We will see if these modes of the experimental sciences are approved in these programs, those of the historical sciences appearing only veiled and in the form of a didactical avoidance.

This thesis examines the multi-dimensional nature of talk surrounding the social phenomenon of performing. Informed by the conversational interview discussions of those closely involved with stand up comedy, the five primary discursive dimensions are considered. These dimensions have been labelled 'Art and Occupation', 'Self and Persona', 'Spontaneous and Rehearsed', 'Talent and Effort', and 'Truth and Believability'. Collectively these dimensions contribute {{to our understanding of}} performing, although this understanding is not exclusive to the performers and performance of the stand up comedy environment. The concerns of the particular participants are not necessarily regarded as fundamentally different from our own as we exist as performers in the performance of our own lives. The five dimensions are not only similar in that they each contribute to our understanding of performers and performance, they are also similarly dyadic in nature, being constructed around the juxtaposition of two ostensibly oppositional concepts, as suggested by the labels given to them. Though participants do not necessarily treat all of them as straightforwardly oppositional, each dimension displays a certain <b>tension</b> between the <b>poles.</b> The theoretical conception informing this work has developed in two ways: ethnographically, as the result of working with interview data, and through a close analysis of other pre-existing theoretical conceptions around the issues of knowledge, ideology and discourse. Specifically, five theoretical approaches are considered: Mannheimian sociology of knowledge; Foucauldian discourses; social representation theory; interpretative repertoires; and ideological dilemmas. It was found that these approaches divide (roughly) into group consensus theories and dilemmatic theories. The latter group was found to be more pertinent for the analysis of the material here. Nevertheless, neither dilemmatic theory alone, nor a simple combination of the two, did justice to the specifics under consideration. Thus, this thesis remains eclectic in terms of its theoretical underpinnings. The tensions and oppositions that are evident in the talk around stand up comedy are clear indications of equivalent tensions inherent in performance, and the practice of performers, more generally. Indeed, it would appear that performing of all kinds is intrinsically paradoxical. Thus the results presented here have resonance and relevance beyond the world of stand up comedy alone...|$|R
40|$|Critics {{have found}} {{polarities}} in works like Dryden 2 ̆ 7 s Absalom and Achitophel, Johnson 2 ̆ 7 s Life of Savage, and Fielding 2 ̆ 7 s Tom Jones, between time and eternity, Fortune and Providence, imagination and reason, sympathy and judgment, and {{have argued that}} these authors choose one pole, not the other, or that they are confused, or that they suspend the works in <b>tension</b> between the <b>poles.</b> Such readings undervalue the dynamic coherence of these works. The thesis argues that these authors were sustained in their handling of these polarities in historical and psychological thought by the Renaissance literary tradition, by {{the way in which}} writers like More, Burton, and Milton evaluated inadequate and polarized ideas in dynamic, circumstantial mimeses.;Chapter I examines historical and psychological ideas during the Renaissance, demonstrating the continuity of polarities between Fortune and Providence, imagination and reason, from Erasmus through Machiavelli, Bacon, Hobbes, and Locke to Hume. Then follows a description of mimesis, using examples from Utopia, The Anatomy of Melancholy, and Paradise Lost. These fictions represent God working providentially through the distorted actions of men in time, and they draw the readers into a reintegrative psychological process.;The following chapters examine the case studies. Dryden 2 ̆ 7 s mimesis of various responses to God 2 ̆ 7 s justice and mercy is sustained by Renaissance psychology and by the historical mimesis of Paradise Lost. The King and the narrator at first confuse liberty with libertinism, but in response to the history represented in the poem, the King speaks at the end with truly Godlike mercy based on justice. Richard Savage is a melancholic whose fantasies disjoined from memory exacerbate the extremes of his experience. Like Democritus Junior, Johnson the narrator enacts and draws his readers into the process of harmonizing imagination and memory in response to Savage 2 ̆ 7 s history. In Tom Jones various characters, including the narrator, express a range of ideas about Fortune and Providence which are evaluated {{in the context of the}} mimesis. The readers, like Tom, learn an imaginative prudence by observing God 2 ̆ 7 s providence working through particular yet typical individuals and events in a community in time...|$|R
40|$|Rapidly {{assembled}} tent {{structures are}} temporary enclosures used to house people or goods. Their uses vary to include recreation, refugee housing, and military shelters. The structural concepts applied in these shelters are as variable as their uses. Some {{make use of}} a <b>tensioned</b> fabric and <b>pole</b> system to provide structural strength. Others have a load-bearing frame with attached fabric skin. Further variants make use of inflatable arches or consist of modular containers. Analysis {{of a number of}} different types of rapidly assembled tent structures reveals an area where innovation can occur. Conflicts {{in the last ten years}} suggest that rapidly assembled shelters for both military purposes and humanitarian relief have the greatest need for innovative solutions. Existing shelters used by the military lack the versatility and speed of deployment necessary in modern conflict. The lack of scalability in the designs makes it difficult to use an existing tent in different situations. They are slow to construct, heavy, and difficult to transport in large numbers. These problems suggest that there is a need for new shelters that better meet the needs of the military. The application of deployable structures technology meets military's needs for structures with the advantages of a small compacted volume, rapid assembly, and ease of deployment. This makes them ideal for application to shelter structures. The aim of this dissertation was to develop a new type of deployable, long-span shelter frame based upon tiled Bennett mechanisms. An overlapping combination of equilateral Bennett mechanisms yields a structure that opens into a half-cylinder shape, providing an enclosed space useful and applicable to the problem of deployable shelters. The specific application considered in the design portion of this process will be a long-span deployable shelter capable of housing military helicopters. This report details the development of the Bennett Shelter concept. Its deployed and compacted geometries are explored, and a procedure for determining structural properties and dimensions is presented. The full concept for the structure, from outer covering to foundation support is then detailed. Loads affecting the structure are determined, and the process of modelling and analysing the structure is then considered. Optimisation of the structure with respect to weight and serviceability requirements is conducted using a number of different materials, and full analysis of the optimal geometries is completed. As no method exists for evaluating the effect of imperfections on the deployment of overconstrained mechanisms, a procedure is derived. The effects of manufacturing imperfections on deployment of the Bennett mechanism are then explored using the method. A full examination of the variation of energy within the Bennett Shelter during deployment provides valuable insight into the performance of the structure. With the above analysis complete, it is shown that the Bennett Shelter is viable as a long-span deployable shelter. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
