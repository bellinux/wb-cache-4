40|$|Three {{different}} types of orange packing systems (packing table, box filler, and net filler) were analysed using an instrumented sphere IS 100 (7 cm.) in four orange packing lines {{in the region of}} Levante (Spain). Four packing tables, three box fillers, and three net fillers were tested by analysing impacts inflicted to fruit at the entrance and outlet <b>transfer</b> <b>points</b> of the machine. In general, entrance <b>transfer</b> <b>points</b> were more aggressive than outlet <b>transfer</b> <b>points.</b> Box filler was the least aggressive machine...|$|R

5|$|This express {{station has}} four tracks and two island platforms. The F train {{stops on the}} outer local tracks at all times while the E stops on the center express tracks weekdays (Manhattan-bound from {{approximately}} 6:00a.m. to 6:00p.m., Jamaica-bound from 7:30a.m. to 7:45p.m.) and on the outer tracks at all other times. During weekdays this is the easternmost <b>transfer</b> <b>point</b> between the E and F trains before they branch off toward their eastern terminals.|$|E
5|$|This is {{the only}} subway station serving the island of Broad Channel, which is located in Jamaica Bay. The island only has about 3,000 residents, and as a result, this is the least-used station in the subway system not {{counting}} the closed Cortlandt Street station. However, this station serves an important role. It is the <b>transfer</b> <b>point</b> between the Rockaway Park Shuttle, which runs to Rockaway Park–Beach 116th Street, and the A train, which runs through Brooklyn and Manhattan.|$|E

This extension uses four-carriage trains as opposed to the eight-carriage trains used west of Guanglan Road, which serves as the <b>transfer</b> <b>point.</b>|$|E
5|$|Reading {{is a major}} {{junction}} point of the National Rail system, and hence Reading station is a major <b>transfer</b> <b>point</b> and terminus. In a project that finished in 2015, Reading station was redeveloped {{at a cost of}} £850m, with grade separation of some conflicting traffic flows, and extra platforms, to relieve severe congestion at this station. Railway lines link Reading to both Paddington and Waterloo stations in London. Other stations in the Reading area are Reading West, Tilehurst and Earley. Green Park railway station is planned on the Reading to Basingstoke Line to serve Green Park Business Park.|$|E
5|$|The {{downtown}} transit tunnel {{is expected}} to lose bus service in 2019, due to construction at Convention Place station; the tunnel would become served exclusively by light rail trains after that point. International District/Chinatown station will become the <b>transfer</b> <b>point</b> between the north–south Central Link light rail line and east–west East Link light rail line when the latter opens in 2023, connecting Seattle to Mercer Island, Bellevue, and Redmond. The new line will include {{the construction of a}} turnback track within the station, as well as reconfiguration of other tracks.|$|E

5|$|The station {{opened on}} December 31, 1936 {{as the new}} {{terminal}} for the Independent Subway System's Queens Boulevard Line. The opening of the station brought significant growth to the adjacent communities of Forest Hills and Kew Gardens, transforming them from quiet residential communities to active population centers. Today, the station serves as a major <b>transfer</b> <b>point</b> between the subway and local buses. Bus service to eastern Queens or southern-central Queens {{is provided by the}} Q46, and the Q10 and Q37, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Broad Channel is a {{small island}} with fewer than 3,000 residents, and as a result, it has {{historically}} {{been one of the}} least-used stations in the system. In 1985, the station had only 224 paying daily riders on a typical weekday not counting farebeaters (people not paying their fare) {{making it one of the}} least used stations in the system. The station has the second-lowest ridership in the subway system as of 2015, with 91,766 annual riders, or 310 riders per weekday. In terms of annual ridership, it was only trailed by Cortlandt Street, a station that is closed to be rebuilt as a result of damage from the September 11 attacks. Overall, Broad Channel is the least used of any fully operating subway station in the city, although on weekdays it has on average 5 more riders than the Beach 105th Street station. However, it is the only <b>transfer</b> <b>point</b> between the A train and the Rockaway Park Shuttle, and some 2,700 daily riders use it in this capacity. As a result, the platforms are sometimes packed.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{started at}} this station in 1969, {{and as a}} result of the New York City fiscal crisis in 1975, the station did not open until 1989. Originally, the station was {{intended}} to be a <b>transfer</b> <b>point</b> between passengers from the Sixth Avenue–Queens service and from the Broadway–Second Avenue service. This station was designed to allow for cross-platform transfers. However, in 1975, while the station was being built, construction was halted on the Second Avenue Subway. As a result, the side of the station intended for service to Second Avenue, the BMT side, was walled off with a temporary orange brick wall. Also, space intended for an exit at Third Avenue was left unused. While the Sixth Avenue side opened for service in 1989, the other side was only used for storing Broadway Line trains. The station appeared as if it had one side platform on each level.|$|E

5|$|Following the 1991 {{decision}} {{to build a}} new Rikshospitalet at Gaustad, it was decided to extend the Ullevål Hageby Line of the tramway there, which would pass under the Sognsvann Line. Plans called for a transfer station at Blindern, but this was later discarded in favor of a new station, Forskningsparken. It would replace Vestgrensa, which was considered too far away to be a suitable <b>transfer</b> <b>point.</b> Forskningsparken would also serve {{the northern part of the}} Blindern campus. Not until 1998 were the necessary political agreements in place to allow construction to start. The new light rail started services on 1 June 1999, and the rapid transit station opened on 22 August. With the opening, Line 4 of the metro was extended from Blindern, via Forskningsparken, to Ullevål stadion. There were complaints from local residents that the increased traffic on the line was causing too much noise, and neighbors demanded that noise shields be built.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to connecting the BMT Nassau Street and IND Sixth Avenue Lines, {{as well as}} the Sixth Avenue Line to the Manhattan Bridge, the Chrystie Street Connection {{is one of the few}} completed sections of the SAS. The Grand Street station was built to serve as a <b>transfer</b> <b>point</b> between the Sixth Avenue and Second Avenue lines. The connection was built this way because the original 1960s plans for the SAS had Second Avenue and Sixth Avenue Line trains sharing two island platforms in a four-track layout, with connections from the Second Avenue Line to the Sixth Avenue Line and the Manhattan Bridge. Because Second Avenue Subway construction was halted in 1975, this station has only served Sixth Avenue Line trains since its opening. As part of the contemporary Second Avenue Subway construction, a new station is planned for construction below the current station during the fourth and final phase of the project; Phase 1 of the project on the Upper East Side opened on January 1, 2017, with Phase 2 in planning and two other phases with no funding commitments.|$|E
