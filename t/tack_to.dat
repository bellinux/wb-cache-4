25|$|Good {{began working}} for Les Thatcher at the Heartland Wrestling Association (HWA) as a {{teenager}} by selling popcorn and setting up the ring before beginning to train {{at the age of}} 18 (Thatcher refused to train Good until he was 18 years old) as a professional wrestler under Thatcher and Cody Hawk. Using the ring name Jon Moxley, he made his debut in June 2004. Less than a year into his career, Moxley teamed up with Jimmy Turner as Necessary Roughness and on May 11, 2005 they defeated the team of Extreme Desire (Mike Desire and <b>Tack)</b> <b>to</b> win the HWA Tag Team Championship. After Ala Hussein and Quinten Lee, who made up the team Foreign Intelligence, defeated Necessary Roughness for the HWA Tag Team Championship, Moxley started teaming with Ric Byrne in a team known as Heartland Foundation. They defeated Foreign Intelligence for the title on August 19, but were stripped of the championship for unknown reasons the same day.|$|E
500|$|In a less {{positive}} retrospective review, Mojos David Buckley contrasted {{the album}} with Gabriel's earlier, more experimental work, claiming [...] "on 1986's So, he switched <b>tack</b> <b>to</b> write pop, and write big. The results are mixed. 'Sledgehammer', echoing both Stevie Wonder's 'Superstition' and David Bowie's 'Fame', retains its punch. Elsewhere, Gabriel sounds airbrushed on 'Mercy Street', 'Red Rain' and 'In Your Eyes', with only 'We Do What We're Told' {{a reminder of}} a daring past." [...] Writing in Uncut, John Lewis also directed criticism at the album. He praised its state-of-the-art production in parts, highlighting [...] "Big Time" [...] and [...] "Sledgehammer" [...] as standout tracks, but claimed elsewhere it interfered, such as the Fairlight CMI synthesizer on [...] "That Voice Again" [...] and whistling ambient accompaniment on [...] "Mercy Street".|$|E
500|$|... ^ The weather gage was a vital {{advantage}} in sailing warfare because the ships required {{wind of the}} correct volume and direction to conduct operations. When the wind {{was in the wrong}} direction, a captain could <b>tack</b> <b>to</b> compensate, but possessing the weather gage meant that a ship could use the wind to attack their opponent directly, without the need for complicated manoeuvre. As long as Villaret held the weather gage, Howe was unable to attack him as he wished and instead had to be on the defensive while simultaneously attempting to force Villaret to give up his advantage. Villaret could have used the weather gage to attack Howe at any time, but did not do so in order to buy time for the convoy to pass the British fleet.|$|E

500|$|Guilty Men was not {{the only}} Second World War tract that damaged Chamberlain's reputation. We Were Not All Wrong, {{published}} in 1941, took a similar <b>tack</b> <b>to</b> Guilty Men, arguing that Liberal and Labour MPs, and a small number of Conservatives, had fought against Chamberlain's appeasement policies. The author, Liberal MP Geoffrey Mander, had voted against conscription in 1939. Another polemic against Conservative policies was Why Not Trust the Tories (1944, written by [...] "Gracchus", who later proved to be future Labour minister Aneurin Bevan), which castigated the Conservatives for the foreign policy decisions of Baldwin and Chamberlain. Though a few Conservatives offered their own versions of events, most notably MP Quintin Hogg in his 1945 The Left was Never Right, {{by the end of the}} war, there was a very strong public belief that Chamberlain was culpable for serious diplomatic and military misjudgments that had nearly caused Britain's defeat.|$|E
2500|$|Pickle was {{in company}} with [...] on 9 July 1805 when they {{captured}} the brig Argo and the sloop Nelly. Then on 19 July Pickle found herself becalmed in the Straits of Gibraltar. Two Spanish gunboats {{came up and}} fired on her until there was enough wind for Pickle {{to be able to}} maneuver to bring her broadsides to bear, at which point she was able to chase the gunboats towards Tarifa. However, the wind faltered, and seven Spanish gunboats came out to harass Pickle. Pickle was able to <b>tack</b> <b>to</b> the shelter of Fort Tangier, though one gunboat continued to harass her until the wind was strong enough for Pickle to sail away and return to the British fleet. Despite the duration of the engagement, Pickle suffered only one man wounded.|$|E

60|$|They {{waited to}} see what this vessel was going to do. Perhaps she was only tacking. But what fool of a skipper would run {{so close to the}} shore for the sake of tacking!
