5|$|The {{recurrent}} laryngeal nerves are <b>the</b> <b>nerves</b> of {{the sixth}} pharyngeal arch. The existence of the recurrent laryngeal nerve was first documented by the physician Galen.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>nerves</b> {{also carry}} sensory {{information}} from the mucous membranes of the larynx below the lower surface of the vocal fold, as well as sensory, secretory and motor fibres to the cervical segments of the esophagus and the trachea.|$|E
5|$|Arches 4 and 6 {{produce the}} {{laryngeal}} cartilages. The nerve {{of the sixth}} arch becomes the recurrent laryngeal nerve. The nerve of the fourth arch {{gives rise to the}} superior laryngeal nerve. The arteries of the fourth arch, which project between <b>the</b> <b>nerves</b> of the fourth and sixth arches, become the left-sided arch of the aorta and the right subclavian artery. The arteries of the sixth arch persists as the ductus arteriosus on the left, and is obliterated on the right.|$|E
50|$|Neural, or 'retro{{cochlear}}', {{hearing loss}} occurs because {{of damage to}} <b>the</b> cochlear <b>nerve</b> (CVIII). This damage may affect the initiation of <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> impulse in <b>the</b> cochlear <b>nerve</b> or <b>the</b> transmission of <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> impulse along <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> into <b>the</b> brainstem.|$|R
50|$|In {{most cases}} <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> roots are {{stretched}} or torn from their origin, since the meningeal covering of a nerve root is thinner than the sheath enclosing <b>the</b> <b>nerve.</b> <b>The</b> epineurium of <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> is contiguous with the dura mater, providing extra support to <b>the</b> <b>nerve.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> only <b>nerves</b> {{containing}} SVE fibers are cranial nerves: <b>the</b> trigeminal <b>nerve</b> (V), <b>the</b> facial <b>nerve</b> (VII), <b>the</b> glossopharyngeal <b>nerve</b> (IX), <b>the</b> vagus <b>nerve</b> (X) and <b>the</b> accessory <b>nerve</b> (XI).|$|R
5|$|As {{the wing}} develops, the dorsal and ventral integumental layers become closely apposed {{over most of}} their area forming the wing membrane. The {{remaining}} areas form channels, the future veins, in which <b>the</b> <b>nerves</b> and tracheae may occur. The cuticle surrounding the veins becomes thickened and more heavily sclerotized to provide strength and rigidity to the wing. Two types of hair may occur on the wings: microtrichia, which are small and irregularly scattered, and macrotrichia, which are larger, socketed, and may be restricted to veins. The scales of Lepidoptera and Trichoptera are highly modified macrotrichia.|$|E
5|$|Braun {{underwent}} surgery in October to desensitize the pain receptors near <b>the</b> <b>nerves</b> {{at the base}} of his right thumb. The problem was affecting his grip on the bat. The surgery was performed by Dr. Vernon Williams. Through 2014, he was fifth among all active ballplayers in career slugging percentage, and second among active left fielders in career fielding percentage.|$|E
5|$|In {{front of}} around 60 students, Bayliss stimulated <b>the</b> <b>nerves</b> with {{electricity}} {{for half an}} hour, {{but was unable to}} demonstrate his point. The dog was then handed to a student, Henry Dale, a future Nobel laureate, who removed the dog's pancreas, then killed him with a knife through the heart. This became a point of embarrassment during the libel trial, when Bayliss's laboratory assistant, Charles Scuttle, testified that the dog had been killed with chloroform or the ACE mixture. After Scuttle's testimony Dale told the court that he had, in fact, used a knife.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> optic <b>nerve</b> can be {{infiltrated}} by {{a variety}} of processes, including tumors, inflammation, and infections. Tumors that can infiltrate <b>the</b> optic <b>nerve</b> can be primary (optic gliomas, capillary hemangiomas, and cavernous hemangiomas) or secondary (metastatic carcinoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, lymphoma, and leukemia). The most common inflammatory disorder that infiltrates <b>the</b> optic <b>nerve</b> is sarcoidosis. Opportunistic fungi, viruses, and bacteria may also infiltrate <b>the</b> optic <b>nerve.</b> <b>The</b> optic <b>nerve</b> may be elevated if the infiltration occurs in the proximal portion of <b>the</b> <b>nerve.</b> <b>The</b> appearance of <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> on examination depends on the portion of <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> that is affected.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> cranial <b>nerves</b> {{that contain}} GVA fibers include <b>the</b> facial <b>nerve,</b> <b>the</b> {{glossopharyngeal}} <b>nerve</b> and <b>the</b> vagus <b>nerve.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{diagnosis}} is usually made on electromyography (EMG), {{which is one}} of the standard tests in the investigation of otherwise unexplained muscle weakness. This involves the insertion of small needles into <b>the</b> <b>nerves</b> supplying several muscles, administering small electrical impulses through these needles, and measuring the electrical response of the muscle in question. Two EMG investigations can be characteristic in LEMS: compound motor action potentials (CMAPs) and single-fiber examination.|$|E
5|$|The human ear can {{generally}} hear sounds with frequencies between 20 Hz and 20 kHz (the audio range). Sounds {{outside this}} range are considered infrasound (below 20Hz) or ultrasound (above 20kHz) Although hearing requires an intact and functioning auditory {{portion of the}} central nervous system as well as a working ear, human deafness (extreme insensitivity to sound) most commonly occurs because of abnormalities of the inner ear, rather than in <b>the</b> <b>nerves</b> or tracts of the central auditory system.|$|E
5|$|The {{recurrent}} laryngeal nerves {{control all}} intrinsic {{muscles of the}} larynx except for the cricothyroid muscle. These muscles act to open, close, and adjust the tension of the vocal cords, and include the posterior cricoarytenoid muscles, the only muscle to open the vocal cords. <b>The</b> <b>nerves</b> supply muscles {{on the same side}} of the body, with the exception of the interarytenoid muscle, which is innervated from both sides.|$|E
40|$|Peripheral nerve {{entrapment}} {{occurs at}} specific anatomic locations. Familiarity with the anatomy and the {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) features of nerve entrapment syndromes is important for accurate diagnosis and early treatment of entrapment neuropathies. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to illustrate the normal anatomy of peripheral <b>nerves</b> in <b>the</b> upper and lower limbs and to review the MRI features of common disorders affecting <b>the</b> peripheral <b>nerves,</b> both compressive/entrapment and noncompressive, involving <b>the</b> suprascapular <b>nerve,</b> <b>the</b> axillary <b>nerve,</b> <b>the</b> radial <b>nerve,</b> <b>the</b> ulnar <b>nerve,</b> and <b>the</b> median verve in the upper limb and <b>the</b> sciatic <b>nerve,</b> <b>the</b> common peroneal <b>nerve,</b> <b>the</b> tibial <b>nerve,</b> and <b>the</b> interdigital <b>nerves</b> in <b>the</b> lower limb...|$|R
5000|$|The {{branches}} {{are listed}} below. Most branch from the cords, {{but a few}} branch (indicated in italics) directly from earlier structures. The five on the left are considered [...] "terminal branches". These terminal branches are <b>the</b> musculocutaneous <b>nerve,</b> <b>the</b> axillary <b>nerve,</b> <b>the</b> radial <b>nerve,</b> <b>the</b> median <b>nerve,</b> and <b>the</b> ulnar <b>nerve.</b> Due to both emerging from the lateral cord <b>the</b> musculocutaneous <b>nerve</b> and <b>the</b> median <b>nerve</b> are well connected. <b>The</b> musculocutaneous <b>nerve</b> has even been shown to send a branch to <b>the</b> median <b>nerve</b> further connecting them.There have been several variations reported in the branching pattern but these are very rare.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> cranial <b>nerves</b> {{containing}} GVE fibers include <b>the</b> oculomotor <b>nerve</b> (CN III), <b>the</b> facial <b>nerve</b> (CN VII), <b>the</b> glossopharyngeal <b>nerve</b> (CN IX) and <b>the</b> vagus <b>nerve</b> (CN X).|$|R
5|$|Tracheotomy {{consists}} {{of making an}} incision {{on the front of}} the neck and opening a direct airway through an incision in the trachea. The resulting opening can serve independently as an airway or as a site for a tracheostomy tube to be inserted; this tube allows a person to breathe without the use of his nose or mouth. The opening may be made by a scalpel or a needle (referred to as surgical and percutaneous techniques respectively) and both techniques are widely used in current practice. In order to limit the risk of damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerves (<b>the</b> <b>nerves</b> that control the voicebox), the tracheotomy is performed as high in the trachea as possible. If only one of these nerves is damaged, the patient's voice may be impaired (dysphonia); if both of <b>the</b> <b>nerves</b> are damaged, the patient will be unable to speak (aphonia). In the acute setting, indications for tracheotomy are similar to those for cricothyrotomy. In the chronic setting, indications for tracheotomy include the need for long-term mechanical ventilation and removal of tracheal secretions (e.g., comatose patients, or extensive surgery involving the head and neck).|$|E
5|$|Adjacent to the {{pituitary}} lies {{a part of}} {{the skull}} base known as the cavernous sinus. This contains a number of nerves that control the eye muscles. 70% of people with pituitary apoplexy experience double vision due to compression of one of <b>the</b> <b>nerves.</b> In half of these cases, the oculomotor nerve (the third cranial nerve), which controls a number of eye muscles, is affected. This leads to diagonal double vision and a dilated pupil. The fourth (trochlear) and sixth (abducens) cranial nerves are located in the same compartment and can cause diagonal or horizontal double vision, respectively. The oculomotor nerve is predominantly affected as it lies closest to the pituitary. The cavernous sinus also contains the carotid artery, which supplies blood to the brain; occasionally, compression of the artery can lead to one-sided weakness and other symptoms of stroke.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 20th century, {{physicians}} thought low back pain was caused by inflammation of or damage to <b>the</b> <b>nerves,</b> with neuralgia and neuritis frequently mentioned by them in the medical literature of the time. The popularity of such proposed causes decreased during the 20th century. In the early 20th century, American neurosurgeon Harvey Williams Cushing increased the acceptance of surgical treatments for low back pain. In the 1920s and 1930s, new theories of the cause arose, with physicians proposing a combination of nervous system and psychological disorders such as nerve weakness (neurasthenia) and female hysteria. Muscular rheumatism (now called fibromyalgia) was also cited with increasing frequency.|$|E
50|$|Anatomically, {{damage to}} <b>the</b> {{axillary}} <b>nerve</b> or suppression of it causes the palsy. This suppression, {{referred to as}} entrapment, causes <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> pathway to become smaller and impulses cannot move through <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> as easily. Furthermore, if trauma causes damage to the myelin sheath, or injures <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> another way, this will also reduce <b>the</b> ability of <b>nerve</b> impulse flow.|$|R
50|$|This {{disorder}} {{is characterized by}} episodes of severe facial pain along <b>the</b> trigeminal <b>nerve</b> divisions. <b>The</b> trigeminal <b>nerve</b> is a paired cranial nerve that has three major branches: <b>the</b> ophthalmic <b>nerve</b> (V1), <b>the</b> maxillary <b>nerve</b> (V2), and <b>the</b> mandibular <b>nerve</b> (V3). One, two, or all three branches of <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> may be affected. Trigeminal neuralgia most commonly involves the middle branch (<b>the</b> maxillary <b>nerve</b> or V2) and lower branch (mandibular nerve or V3) of <b>the</b> trigeminal <b>nerve.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{lacrimal}} <b>nerve,</b> {{derived from}} <b>the</b> ophthalmic <b>nerve,</b> supplies <b>the</b> sensory {{component of the}} lacrimal gland. <b>The</b> greater petrosal <b>nerve,</b> derived from <b>the</b> facial <b>nerve,</b> supplies <b>the</b> parasympathetic autonomic component of the lacrimal gland. <b>The</b> greater petrosal <b>nerve</b> traverses alongside branches of the V1 and V2 divisions of <b>the</b> trigeminal <b>nerve.</b> <b>The</b> proximity of <b>the</b> greater petrosal <b>nerve</b> to branches of <b>the</b> trigeminal <b>nerve</b> explains <b>the</b> phenomenon of lesions to <b>the</b> trigeminal <b>nerve</b> causing impaired lacrimation although <b>the</b> trigeminal <b>nerve</b> does not supply the lacrimal gland.|$|R
5|$|Ellie Victoria Cole {{was born}} in the Melbourne suburb of Lilydale on 12 December 1991. Her mother and {{grandfather}} were both swimmers, and her father was athletic. At two years of age, she was diagnosed with a rare tumour, a sarcoma that was wrapped around <b>the</b> <b>nerves</b> of her right leg. After unsuccessful attempts to treat her cancer with chemotherapy, her right leg was amputated above the knee on 14 February 1994. Eight weeks after the surgery, as part of her rehabilitation, Cole's mother Jenny enrolled her in swimming lessons. Cole's instructors expected her to take up to a year to learn how to swim in a straight line, but it took her two weeks.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the evolution of the tetrapod limb from fins in lobe-finned fishes is related to expression of the HOXD13 gene or the loss of the proteins actinodin 1 and actinodin 2, which are involved in fish fin development. Robot simulations suggest that the necessary nervous circuitry for walking evolved from <b>the</b> <b>nerves</b> governing swimming, utilizing the sideways oscillation of the body with the limbs primarily functioning as anchoring points and providing limited thrust. This type of movement, as well as changes to the pectoral girdle are similar to those seen in the fossil record can be induced in bichirs by raising then out of water.|$|E
5|$|Long-term {{management}} of hyperthyroidism may include drugs that suppress thyroid function such as propylthiouracil, carbimazole and methimazole. Radioactive iodine-131 {{can be used}} to destroy thyroid tissue. Radioactive iodine is selectively taken up by the thyroid, which over time destroys the cells involved in its uptake. The chosen first-line treatment will depend on the individual and on the country where being treated. Surgery to remove the thyroid can sometimes be performed as a transoral thyroidectomy, a minimally-invasive procedure. Surgery does however carry a risk of damage to the parathyroid glands and <b>the</b> <b>nerves</b> controlling the vocal cords. If the entire thyroid gland is removed, hypothyroidism will naturally result, and thyroid hormone substitutes will be needed.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> nasociliary <b>nerve</b> is {{a branch}} of <b>the</b> {{ophthalmic}} <b>nerve</b> (CN V1; one of three branches of <b>the</b> trigeminal <b>nerve</b> a.k.a. CN V).

5|$|Other diagnoses {{that are}} {{typically}} considered include fractures, tumors, or systemic disease if plantar fasciitis pain fails to respond appropriately to conservative medical treatments. Bilateral heel pain or heel {{pain in the}} context of a systemic illness may indicate a need for a more in-depth diagnostic investigation. Under these circumstances, diagnostic tests such as a CBC or serological markers of inflammation, infection, or autoimmune disease such as C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, anti-nuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor, HLA-B27, uric acid, or Lyme disease antibodies may also be obtained. Neurological deficits may prompt an investigation with electromyography to evaluate for damage to <b>the</b> <b>nerves</b> or muscles.|$|E
5|$|Outside {{the lecture}} room before the {{students}} arrived, according to testimony Starling and others gave in court, Starling cut the dog open again {{to inspect the}} results of the previous surgery, which took about 45 minutes, after which he clamped the wound with forceps and handed the dog over to Bayliss. Bayliss cut a new opening in the dog's neck to expose the lingual nerves of the salivary glands, to which he attached electrodes. The aim was to stimulate <b>the</b> <b>nerves</b> with electricity to demonstrate that salivary pressure was independent of blood pressure. The dog was then carried to the lecture theatre, stretched on his back on an operating board, with his legs tied to the board, his head clamped and his mouth muzzled.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes, {{there are}} {{additional}} symptoms {{that arise from}} the underlying cause; for instance, if the hypopituitarism {{is due to a}} growth hormone-producing tumor, there may be symptoms of acromegaly (enlargement of the hands and feet, coarse facial features), and if the tumor extends to the optic nerve or optic chiasm, there may be visual field defects. Headaches may also accompany pituitary tumors, as well as pituitary apoplexy (infarction or haemorrhage of a pituitary tumor) and lymphocytic hypophysitis (autoimmune inflammation of the pituitary). Apoplexy, in addition to sudden headaches and rapidly worsening visual loss, may also be associated with double vision that results from compression of <b>the</b> <b>nerves</b> in the adjacent cavernous sinus that control the eye muscles.|$|E
