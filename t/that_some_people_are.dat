5|$|At least 40% {{of people}} with aphthous {{stomatitis}} have a positive family history, suggesting <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> genetically predisposed to suffering with oral ulceration. HLA-B12, HLA-B51, HLA-Cw7, HLA-A2, HLA-A11, and HLA-DR2 are examples of human leukocyte antigen types associated with aphthous stomatitis. However, these HLA types are inconsistently associated with the condition, and also vary according to ethnicity. People who have a positive family history of aphthous stomatitis tend to develop a more severe form of the condition, and {{at an earlier age}} than is typical.|$|E
5|$|Some large {{primates}} such as gorillas and orang-utans (and also humans) have undeveloped ear {{muscles that}} are non-functional vestigial structures, yet are still {{large enough to}} be easily identified. An ear muscle that cannot move the ear, for whatever reason, has lost that biological function. This serves as evidence of homology between related species. In humans, there is variability in these muscles, such <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> able to move their ears in various directions, and {{it has been said that}} it may be possible for others to gain such movement by repeated trials. In such primates, the inability to move the ear is compensated for mainly by the ability to easily turn the head on a horizontal plane, an ability which is not common to most monkeys—a function once provided by one structure is now replaced by another.|$|E

25|$|The Bay Area Toll Authority {{reported}} that by October 2010 fewer users are driving {{during the peak}} hours and more vehicles are crossing the Bay Bridge {{before and after the}} 5–10 a.m. period in which the congestion toll goes into effect. According to a study contracted to the University of California, Berkeley, commute delays {{in the first six months}} have dropped by an average of 15 percent compared with 2009. When the congestion tolls were proposed, the agency expected the scheme to produce a 20 to 30 percent drop in commute traffic. The study also found a decrease in the number of carpools since the first fee for carpools was introduced, with a reduction of 10,800 carpoolers when figures from September 2009 and 2010 are compared. The UC Berkeley study also provides evidence <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> using BART to get to work in San Francisco instead of paying the higher tolls on the Bay Bridge during rush hour.|$|E
25|$|First-generation Reformed theologians include Huldrych Zwingli (1484–1531), Martin Bucer (1491–1551), Wolfgang Capito (1478–1541), John Oecolampadius (1482–1531), and Guillaume Farel (1489–1565). These reformers {{came from}} diverse {{academic}} backgrounds, but later distinctions within Reformed theology can already be detected in their thought, especially {{the priority of}} scripture {{as a source of}} authority. Scripture was also viewed as a unified whole, which led to a covenantal theology of the sacraments of baptism and the Lord's Supper as visible signs of the covenant of grace. Another Reformed distinctive present in these theologians was their denial of the bodily presence of Christ in the Lord's supper. Each of these theologians also understood salvation to be by grace alone, and affirmed a doctrine of particular election (the teaching <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> chosen by God for salvation). Martin Luther and his successor Philipp Melanchthon were undoubtedly significant influences on these theologians, and to a larger extent later Reformed theologians. The doctrine of justification by faith alone was a direct inheritance from Luther.|$|E

25|$|I know <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> {{getting very}} {{defensive}} about Black Swan and my role in it, but back-stabbing {{is not my}} purpose when people ask me about {{the legitimacy of the}} dance shots in the movie. I only care to speak the truth. The truth is that no one, not Natalie Portman, or even myself can come anywhere close {{to the level of a}} professional ballerina in a year and a half. Period. That doesn't mean that I don't admire Natalie and her acting. She is so talented and can inspire people, as well, with her own art form. She did an amazing job portraying her character in Black Swan. (Though the movie wasn't a completely realistic reflection of ballet or dancers.) My only wish is that Natalie, Darren, and certain others who worked closely on the movie could have grasped the beauty and the heart of true ballet. If they had, they would have advocated for this art more and given the real dancers the credit that they deserve.|$|E
500|$|Some people {{develop a}} {{hypersensitivity}} to products and foods containing iodine. Applications of {{tincture of iodine}} or Betadine can cause rashes, sometimes severe. [...] use of iodine-based contrast agents (see above) can cause reactions ranging from a mild rash to fatal anaphylaxis. Such reactions {{have led to the}} misconception (widely held, even among physicians) <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> allergic to iodine itself; even allergies to iodine-rich seafood have been so construed. In fact, {{there has never been a}} confirmed report of a true iodine allergy, and an allergy to elemental iodine or simple iodide salts is theoretically impossible. Hypersensitivity reactions to products and foods containing iodine are apparently related to their other molecular components; thus, a person who has demonstrated an allergy to one food or product containing iodine may not be have an allergic reaction to another. Patients with various food allergies (shellfish, egg, milk, etc.) or asthma are more likely to suffer reactions to contrast media containing iodine. [...] As with all medications, the patient's allergy history should be questioned and consulted before any containing iodine are administered.|$|E
500|$|The {{novel is}} divided into ten {{chapters}} which each act as a short story, linked {{by the use of}} {{a group of people who}} appear in each story. After spending time in bardo, the group (or jāti) are reincarnated into different times and places. While characters in each story are unique, they share some characteristics with their previous incarnations and are linked, for convenience, by the first letter of their name. The characters whose names begin with the letter K are [...] "combative, imprudent and prone to getting himself (or herself) killed" [...] and [...] "striking blows against injustice that typically lead to more suffering". The B characters are [...] "more comfortable in the world, meliorist and optimistic" [...] and [...] "survivors, nurturing friends and family through bad times and patiently waiting for something better". The I characters are [...] "the ones who care, who follow the other two, and may be necessary if their works are to flourish, but who tend to the domestic and always find the world worth loving." [...] The style of writing also changes every chapter to reflect the style of writing associated with the culture being depicted. For example, the first chapter is written similarly to Monkey's Journey to the West and a later chapter incorporates postmodernism. Also, later chapters take on metafictional elements, with characters discussing the nature of history, whether it is cyclical or linear, whether they believe in reincarnation, and feelings <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> intrinsically linked.|$|E

500|$|In 1998, BBRC {{explained}} {{its approach}} to the assessment of single-observer records. The committee explained that while it understood that geographical and social circumstances make it likely <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> {{more likely to find}} rare birds on their own, it is [...] "very cautious about observers with a high proportion of single-observer records" [...] and that its policy is to watch patterns closely and review those observers' past records on a regular basis. This approach has attracted criticism. Former BBRC chairman Ian Wallace and others have written about the subject in Birdwatch magazine. Wallace believes that the committee has a blacklist of observers, from whom it automatically rejects records unless there are other observers able to corroborate the sighting. He mentions two specific observers, both of whom live in remote parts of northern Scotland. Ken Shaw, a former BBRC member, has claimed that BBRC would not accept a single-observer record of a species new to Britain without photographic evidence, regardless of the track record of the observer. Graham Bell, another former member, writing in response to Shaw's article, has accused the committee of adopted unfounded suspicions, arguing that just because a competent observer moves to an underwatched part of the country, their abilities do not change. One of the observers who Wallace claimed was blacklisted, Alan Vittery, also contributed to the debate, stating that he had been informed by the BBRC that they would not consider any single-observer record he submitted, unless supported by a photograph. Vittery contrasted the BBRC's attitude with that of other national rarities committees, arguing that the result of the approach is to distort rarity statistics. Vittery invited the BBRC to reply in public, but this request was declined.|$|E

2500|$|Consequentialist cosmopolitans, amongst whom Peter Singer is prominent, {{argue that}} the proper {{standard}} of moral judgement for actions, practices or institutions is their consequences, and that the measure of consequences is the welfare of humans (or even of all sentient creatures). [...] The capacity to experience welfare and suffering is therefore the shared basis for moral standing. This means that the fact <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> suffering terrible deprivations of welfare, caused by poverty, creates a moral demand that anyone {{who is able to}} help them do so.
