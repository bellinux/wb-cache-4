40|$|Background and purpose: Testing the {{performance}} of treatment planning systems by using the AAPM Task Group 23 <b>test</b> <b>package</b> is a useful approach, but has its limitations. To be able to include technical developments, such as the asymmetric collimator, {{it was decided to}} remeasure the AAPM data set on more modern radiotherapy equipment, to extend the test geometries, and to evaluate the use of the new package. Materials and methods: A coherent set of beam data of 6, 10 and 18 MV photon beams was measured on two modern linear accelerators. These data served as input data in seven commercially available treatment planning systems, which were clinically in use in different radiotherapy departments. Next, a <b>test</b> <b>package</b> was measured which included a missing tissue geometry and fields with asymmetrical collimator setting, with and without a wedge. Results: The absolute dose prediction from the different treatment planning systems in which the measured beam data were entered, was compared for all test points with the results of direct measurements. The criteria of acceptability were exceeded by some systems in cases of irregular field geometry and missing tissue geometry. The majority of the systems had difficulties with accurate dose calculation for asymmetrically wedged fields. Conclusions: The application of the new <b>test</b> <b>package</b> did not introduce insuperable difficulties and was highly appreciated by the participating centres. Most systems performed reasonably well {{for the majority of the}} beam geometries, with the exception of asymmetrically wedged beams. The extended <b>test</b> <b>package</b> is available for other users or user group, for the purpose of commissioning new treatment planning systems, or new releases of existing systems.

40|$|A unique {{experimental}} method {{was used to}} test the beam waveguide (BWG) antenna at Deep Space Station (DDS) 13 in the Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex near Barstow, California. The methodology involved the use of portable test packages to make measurements of operating noise temperatures and antenna efficiencies (as functions of antenna pointing angles) at the Cassegrain focal point and the final focal point located in a subterranean pedestal room. Degradations caused by the BWG mirror systems were determined by making comparisons of the measured parameters at the two focal points of the antenna. Previous articles were concerned with the design, performance characteristics, and test results obtained with an X-band <b>test</b> <b>package</b> operating at 32 GHz.

40|$|Bayes ' theorem {{describes}} {{the effect of}} new information (e. g., a test result) on the probability of an outcome (e. g., a disease). Likelihood ratios for separate tests can be combined to assess the joint effect of their results on disease probability. This approach {{has been used to}} develop a <b>test</b> <b>package</b> for Alzheimer's disease that consists of some simple cognitive tests (Paired Associate Learning Test, Trailmaking Test, and Raven's Progressive Matrices) combined with age and family history of dementia. A total of 1, 454 subjects who had been recruited into the Medical Research Council Elderly Hypertension Trial between 1983 and 1985 com-pleted cognitive tests at entry to the trial (when they were without signs of dementia) and 1 month later. Their dementia status was ascertained in 1990 - 1991. The <b>test</b> <b>package</b> identified 52 % of Alzheimer's disease cases with a 9 % false-positive rate or 90 % of Alzheimer's disease cases with a 29 % false-positive rate. The author proposes the use of a similar <b>test</b> <b>package</b> in conjunction with a test for apolipoprotein E e 4 status, which is a powerful risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease, as a likelihood ratio approach to the prospective identification of Alzheimer's disease cases. This approach could be followed by ethically sound trials of new therapeutic agents for subjects who have a high probability of developing Alzheimer's disease. Am J Epidemio...|$|E
