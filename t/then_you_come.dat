500|$|... "I'm Goin' Down" [...] {{features}} an energetic rhythm, propelled by a heavy drumbeat by Weinberg, and contains a saxophone solo by Clemons. The music has a basic chord progression of A–E–F#m–D. In concerts in 1984, Springsteen introduced the song by describing the diminishing intimacy and sexual activity {{that can occur}} {{over the course of}} a romantic relationship: [...] " [...] you're making love to 'em all the time, three or four times a day. <b>Then</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> back a little bit later, and, uh-oh... it's like 'Are you gonna make love to me tonight, or are we gonna wait for the full moon again', y'know?" [...] The song's lyrics include lines such as [...] "I'm sick and tired of you setting me up / Setting me up just to knock-a knock-a knock-a me down" [...] and [...] "You used to love to drive me wild / But lately girl you get your kicks from just driving me down". The lyrics later turn into a stream of gibberish syllables.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{two ways}} to the valley. The {{southern}} route is from Tyumen by the highway M51 towards Kurgan. Beyond the village [...] it crosses the Iset River and turn left in front of the village Soloboevo, then through Malyshy and Botniki to get to Krasnogorskoe, the beginning of the valley. Then you can travel the route Krasnogorskoe-Loga—Minino—Onufrieva—Upper Ingal—Niphaki—Ingalinskoe—Lykovo—Koklyagina—Surka—Tyutrina—Byzovo—; this path goes around the valley from the south-west.

2500|$|DeRogatis {{compared}} the album's repeated listening value to a heightened psychedelic awareness, that its melodies [...] "continue to reveal themselves after dozens of listens, just as previously unnoticed {{corners of the}} world reveal themselves during the psychedelic experience". On the subject of psychedelic records in the 1960s, Sean Lennon stated that [...] "psychedelic music is a term that pretty much refers to these sort of epic, ambitious long-form records... the reason Pet Sounds is considered a psychedelic journey or whatever is because it's like opening a door and stepping through and entering another world and you're in that other world {{for a period of time}} and <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> back." ...|$|E
6000|$|And <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>came</b> {{with those}} red mournful lips, [...] And with <b>you</b> <b>came</b> {{the whole of}} the world's tears [...] And all the trouble of her labouring ships, [...] And all the trouble of her myriad years.|$|R
6000|$|... "Huh! {{you know}} the reason {{as well as he}} does," [...] burst out Martell. [...] "You played a trick on me about that suitcase, and <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>came</b> and rough-housed my room." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I still {{believed}} it," [...] said Mr. Bentley. [...] "My conception of that mission changed, grew, {{and yet it}} seemed further and further from fulfilment. And <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>came</b> to St. John's." ...|$|R
2500|$|Following her divorce, Jackson {{decided to}} record an uptempo, optimistic album rather than songs about sadness or anger. Producer Jimmy Jam said, [...] "You {{go through all}} these {{emotions}} and <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> out {{of it on the}} other side and say, [...] "I'm going to be okay and I have a lot of things to be thankful for,' and that was the overriding feeling in her life when we were making this album." [...] Its concept focuses largely on the demise of her marriage to René Elizondo, Jr. and subsequent embrace of the single life, experiencing dating for the first time. It also contains themes of sensuality, deceit, and betrayal. Jackson said, [...] "It’s a different thing for me. Growing up, I never dated. I’m doing that now, experiencing that whole life." [...] Its upbeat tempo intended to reflect Jackson's self-esteem, described as [...] "a work in progress." [...] Jam commented, [...] "She doesn't see herself the way other people see her. You know...gorgeous and sexy and all that. That isn't the kind of person she is. Although she is closer to feeling like that person now than she was 15 years ago. Or even three of four years ago." [...] Jackson commented, [...] "I look back at pictures of myself from four years ago and I see the unhappiness in my eyes. But I'm in the greatest space now... I believe we have choices and paths, and it's about choosing the right path, the promising path." [...] While recording, Jackson listened to artists such as St. Germain, Buena Vista Social Club, Thievery Corporation, Basement Jaxx, Outkast and Papa Roach.|$|E

6000|$|... "How strange! Yet I {{can believe}} it of her, she looked a woman who would dare do anything. <b>Then</b> <b>you</b> <b>came</b> back, Adam, to find me? What led you here, hoping so much and knowing so little?" ...|$|R
