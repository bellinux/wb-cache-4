5|$|In {{response}} {{to the arrival of}} the Crusaders, the regent of Damascus, Mu'in ad-Din Unur, started making feverish preparations for war, strengthening the fortifications of Damascus, ordering troops to his city and having the water sources along the road <b>to</b> <b>Damascus</b> destroyed or diverted. Anur sought help from the Zangid rulers of Aleppo and Mosul (who were normally his rivals), though forces from these states did not arrive in time to see combat outside of Damascus. It is almost certain that the Zangid rulers delayed sending troops <b>to</b> <b>Damascus</b> out of the hope that their rival Anur might lose his city to the Crusaders.|$|E
5|$|Khalid's spy {{informed}} {{him about the}} move, Khalid having received permission from Abu Ubaidah, quickly moved towards Damascus with his mobile guard.

5|$|According to Melman, Abu Nidal had {{recommended}} Hindawi to Syrian intelligence. Seale {{writes that the}} bomb had been manufactured by Abu Nidal's technical committee, who had delivered it to Syrian air force intelligence. It was sent to London in a diplomatic bag and given to Hindawi. According to Seale, it was widely believed that the attack {{was in response to}} Israel having forced down a jet, two months earlier, carrying Syrian officials <b>to</b> <b>Damascus,</b> which Israel had supposed was carrying senior Palestinians.|$|E

50|$|The Hedjaz Railway {{opened in}} 1908 by the Ottoman Empire from <b>Damascus</b> <b>to</b> Medina. Service was {{suspended}} during World War I. After the war only the Damascus-Ma'an section re-opened. In 1924, the International Train ran its first trip from Hejaz Train Station in <b>Damascus</b> <b>to</b> Ma'an. Since 1960 the train only ran from <b>Damascus</b> <b>to</b> Amman. Diesel Locomotives became the primary power after 1976.|$|R
5|$|After {{being forced}} out of his {{headquarters}} at Nazareth {{on the morning of}} 20 September, Liman von Sanders drove via Tiberias and Samakh late in the afternoon, arriving at Deraa during the morning of 21 September on his way <b>to</b> <b>Damascus.</b> Here he received a report from the Fourth Army (east of the Jordan holding Jisr ed Damieh, Shunet Nimrin, Es Salt and Amman), which he ordered to withdraw to the Deraa to Irbid line without waiting for their southern Hedjaz troops.|$|E
5|$|Back in Egypt, as-Sallar {{was assassinated}} in 1153 by his son Abbas, Abbas's son Nasr, and caliph az-Zafir, who, {{according}} to Usama, was Nasr's lover. Thirteenth-century historian Ibn al-Athir says that Usama was the instigator of this plot. Usama {{may also have been}} behind the assassination of az-Zafir by Abbas, in 1154. Az-Zafir's relatives called upon a supporter, Ibn Ruzzik, who chased Abbas out of Cairo, and Usama followed him. He lost his possessions in Cairo, and on the way <b>to</b> <b>Damascus</b> his retinue was attacked by the crusaders and Bedouin nomads, but in June 1154 he safely reached Damascus, which had recently been captured by Nur ad-Din. Ibn Ruzzik tried to persuade him to come back, as the rest of his family was still in Cairo, but Usama was able to bring them <b>to</b> <b>Damascus,</b> through crusader territory, in 1156. The crusaders promised to transport them safely, but they were attacked and pillaged, and Usama lost his entire library.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in {{the early}} 16th century, trade {{networks}} connecting Nablus <b>to</b> <b>Damascus</b> and Cairo were supplemented by the establishment of trading posts in the Hejaz and Gulf regions {{to the south and}} east, {{as well as in the}} Anatolian Peninsula and the Mediterranean islands of Crete and Cyprus. Nablus also developed trade relations with Aleppo, Mosul, and Baghdad.|$|E

5|$|During the {{unsuccessful}} {{attack of}} the 5th Cavalry Division on Nazareth {{in the early morning}} of 20 September, the commander of the Yildirim Army Group commanding three Ottoman armies, Generalleutnant (comparable to a British Major General) Otto Liman von Sanders escaped <b>to</b> <b>Damascus,</b> travelling via Tiberias, Samakh and Deraa. He alerted the garrisons he passed to the advance of the EEF and ordered the establishment of a rearguard line. The line was to run from Deraa down the Yarmuk River Valley, across the Jordan River and west to Samakh, around the shore of the Sea of Galilee to Tiberias and northwards to Lake Huleh. Two main roads and the railway lines <b>to</b> <b>Damascus,</b> would be protected and time gained {{for the development of the}} defence of Damascus, if the garrisons were not defeated. Von Sanders and three senior Yildirim Army Group staff officers reached Tiberias during the afternoon of 20 September.|$|E
5|$|Liman von Sanders had no combat {{formations}} {{available to}} stop the cavalry advance up the coast and across the Esdraelon Plain; Allenby's attack forced the Yildirim Army Group and its commander to retire. Liman von Sanders' retreat from Nazareth, {{began in the early}} hours of 20 September, taking him to Tiberias and Samakh late in the afternoon, and then on to Deraa, where he arrived on the morning of 21 September on his way <b>to</b> <b>Damascus.</b>|$|E
5|$|On a {{surprise}} visit <b>to</b> <b>Damascus</b> {{to celebrate the}} union on 24 February, Nasser was welcomed by crowds {{in the hundreds of}} thousands. Crown Prince Imam Badr of North Yemen was dispatched <b>to</b> <b>Damascus</b> with proposals to include his country in the new republic. Nasser agreed to establish a loose federal union with Yemen—the United Arab States—in place of total integration. While Nasser was in Syria, King Saud planned to have him assassinated on his return flight to Cairo. On 4 March, Nasser addressed the masses in Damascus and waved before them the Saudi check given to Syrian security chief and, unbeknownst to the Saudis, ardent Nasser supporter Abdel Hamid Sarraj to shoot down Nasser's plane. As a consequence of Saud's plot, he was forced by senior members of the Saudi royal family to informally cede most of his powers to his brother, King Faisal, a major Nasser opponent who advocated pan-Islamic unity over pan-Arabism.|$|E

5|$|Samakh was {{regarded}} by both Allenby, the British {{commander of the}} Egyptian Expeditionary Force, and the German General Otto Liman von Sanders, commander of the Yildirim Army Group, as a key strategic point.

5|$|Shukri Quwatli {{was born}} in Damascus in 1891.

He returned <b>to</b> <b>Damascus</b> in 1913 after receiving his diploma, and started working for the Ottoman civil service.|$|E
5|$|The Estoire de Eracles wrongly {{claimed that}} Saladin's sister was {{also among the}} prisoners taken by Raynald when he seized the caravan. Actually, she {{returned}} from Mecca <b>to</b> <b>Damascus</b> in a subsequent pilgrim-caravan in March 1187. To protect her against an attack by Raynald, Saladin escorted the pilgrims while they were travelling near Oultrejordain. Saladin stormed into Oultrejordain on 26April and pillaged Raynald's domains for a month. Thereafter, Saladin marched to Ashtara, where the troops coming {{from all parts of}} his realm assembled.|$|E
50|$|Holding Damascus was {{considered}} {{crucial for the}} government, which kept its highest concentration of troops and its most loyal and best-trained units {{in and around the}} city. According to The New York Times, rebels were unlikely to be able <b>to</b> overrun <b>Damascus</b> quickly, but the fighting in Rif Dimashq, especially at the airport, had a profound psychological effect on government supporters, making them feel trapped, and forcing the Syrian Army to shift resources from other areas <b>to</b> defend <b>Damascus.</b>|$|R

5|$|The Muslim siege {{forces had}} been {{weakened}} by the withdrawal of 9,000 men to repel the Byzantine relief force. If the Byzantine garrison had sallied out against the Muslim army, historians suspect the defenders would have broken through the Muslim lines and lifted the siege. Understanding {{the danger of the}} situation, Khalid hurriedly returned <b>to</b> <b>Damascus.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{defeat at}} Alexandretta {{was a major}} blow to Fatimid morale. Coupled with news of an advance against Damascus of the Qarmatians, a radical Isma'ili group {{originating}} from Eastern Arabia, Ibn Falah ordered Futuh to raise the siege of Antioch in early July 971. The army returned <b>to</b> <b>Damascus,</b> whence the various contingents dispersed to their home districts.|$|E
5|$|The loss of Tiberias ended Liman von Sanders' {{plans for}} a rearguard line {{extending}} from the Yarmuk via the Sea of Galilee and on to Lake Huleh. The remnants of the Tiberias and Samakh garrisons established a strong rearguard south of Lake Huleh, at Jisr Benat Yakub which was attacked and captured during the pursuit <b>to</b> <b>Damascus.</b>|$|E

The Tiberias Group commanded by Jemal Pasha, commander of the Fourth Army was also ordered <b>to</b> defend <b>Damascus.</b> Liman von Sanders realised he could not defend the city and withdrew his Yildirim Army Group headquarters north to Aleppo. During 30 September, retreating units passed through the outposts organised by Colonel von Oppen (commander of the Asia Corps) at Rayak. The 146th Regiment was the last formation <b>to</b> leave <b>Damascus</b> on 30 September. After hearing the Barada Gorge was closed von Hammerstein left Damascus by the Homs road, following the III Corps, the 24th Division and the 3rd Cavalry Division to Rayak.|$|R

5|$|While the Muslims were {{occupied}} at Fahl, Heraclius, sensing the opportunity, quickly sent an army under General Theodras <b>to</b> recapture <b>Damascus.</b> Shortly after Heraclius dispatched this new army, the Muslims having finished {{the business at}} Fahl, {{were on their way}} to Emesa. The Byzantine army met the Muslims half way to Emesa, at Maraj-al-Rome. During the night Theodras sent half of his army towards <b>Damascus</b> <b>to</b> launch a surprise attack on the Muslim garrison.|$|R
5|$|The newly established, {{strategically}} strong defensive British line {{remained in}} place until mid September 1918 when the advance <b>to</b> <b>Damascus</b> and Aleppo, which ended the war in this theatre, took place. It stretched across from the Mediterranean coast {{in the west to}} north and east of Jerusalem. The line was extended during the middle of February 1918 when Jericho in the Jordan Valley was captured and the eastern end of the line was secured on the Dead Sea.|$|E
5|$|After {{his failure}} at Constantinople, Maslama was {{dispatched}} to Iraq {{to quell the}} Kharijites. Following Umar's death and the accession of his brother Yazid II in 720, he was tasked with {{the suppression of the}} revolt of Yazid ibn al-Muhallab, whom he defeated and killed in August 720. He nevertheless fell out of favour with the Caliph, who resented and feared his power as governor of both Iraqs, as well as his interfering in the succession: Maslama favoured his brother Hisham over Yazid's son Walid. Yazid soon recalled Maslama from his post, ostensibly because he had failed to deliver his provinces' tax haul <b>to</b> <b>Damascus,</b> and replaced him by his protege, Umar ibn Hubayra.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 12th century Palmyra was ruled by Toghtekin, the Burid atabeg of Damascus, who {{appointed}} his nephew governor. Toghtekin's nephew {{was killed by}} rebels, and the atabeg retook the city in 1126. Palmyra was given to Toghtekin's grandson, Shihab-ud-din Mahmud, who was replaced by governor Yusuf ibn Firuz when Shihab-ud-din Mahmud returned <b>to</b> <b>Damascus</b> after his father Taj al-Muluk Buri succeeded Toghtekin. The Burids transformed the Temple of Bel into a citadel in 1132, fortifying the city, and transferring it to the Bin Qaraja family three years later in exchange for Homs.|$|E
50|$|Buri succeeded Toghtekin, uncontested, in February 1128. The {{following}} year, his vizier {{discovered a}} plot {{set by the}} Assassins <b>to</b> deliver <b>Damascus</b> <b>to</b> the Crusaders. Baldwin, who ignored that the plot {{had been brought to}} light, arrived with his army near Damascus and besieged it. The siege lasted until 5 December 1129, when the western troops were forced to retreat after heavy rains had turned the surroundings of the city into a marsh.|$|R
