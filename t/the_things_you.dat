25|$|The Spirit of the Staircase, Curreri's 2004 release saw {{the return}} of Jeff Romano, who {{produced}} and performed on 2002's From Long Gones to Hawkmoth. The title of the record comes from a French expression l'esprit d'escalier, <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>you</b> think to say after you are already out the door. His first live album, Are You Going to Paul Curreri was recorded at Charlottesville's (now-defunct) Gravity Lounge, and released in 2006. Musical backing was provided by Charlottesvillians Randall Pharr (bass) and Spencer Lathrop (drums).|$|E

500|$|... "All <b>the</b> <b>Things</b> <b>You</b> Are" [...] is a {{song from}} Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein II's Broadway musical Very Warm for May.

500|$|At first, the {{developers}} {{had no idea}} how they would actually create the physical terrain for the Ages. Eventually, they created grayscale heightmaps, extruding them to create changes in elevation. From this basic terrain, textures were painted onto a colormap which was wrapped over the landscapes. Objects such as trees were added to complete the design. Rand noted that attention to detail allowed Myst to deal with the limitations of CD-ROM drives and graphics, stating [...] "A lot can be done with texture…Like finding an interesting texture you can map into the tapestry on the wall, spending a little extra time to actually put the bumps on the tapestry, putting screws in things.

500|$|... "Little Things" [...] is a [...] mid-tempo pop {{and folk}} ballad which runs for 3:39 (3 minutes, 39 seconds). Written {{in the key}} of G major, the beat is set in common time and moves at a {{moderate}} 110 beats per minute. One Direction's vocal range in the song span from the note of A3 to D5. Instrumentation includes guitar strings, piano lines and vocals. The song utilises an acoustic guitar riff and a rotation of lead vocals. The song's lyrics revolve around the insistence that flaws are what make a person unique. In a September 2012 interview with MTV News, Sheeran quipped that the song [...] "is about {{the best things about}} someone, kind of like <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>you</b> wouldn't expect."

500|$|Egypt had run up {{a foreign}} debt of nearly $3 billion, {{and the gap}} between exports and imports had widened to a record $500 million for 1965. On Victory Day in Port Said, Nasser conceded that [...] "We are facing difficulties. We must all work harder [...] and make sacrifices. I have no magic button that I can push to produce <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>you</b> want". Premier Zakaria Mohieddin raised Egypt's income tax, added a [...] "defense tax" [...] on all sales, and boosted tariffs on nonessential imports. He also hiked the cost of luxury goods 25% and set low price {{ceilings}} on most foodstuffs. He sent 400 plainclothesmen to Cairo's to arrest 150 shopkeepers for price violations. In March 1966, the Egyptian forces, now numbering almost 60,000, launched their biggest offensive. The royalists counterattacked but the stalemate resumed. Egyptian-supported groups executed sabotage bombings in Saudi Arabia.|$|E
500|$|Mehldau often plays a {{separate}} melody with each hand, {{and one of}} the central features of his music is the playing of improvised counterpoint. He stated in 2002 that some of the content of his playing is affected by the music that he has recently been listening to: [...] "If I'm digging a Brahms intermezzo that'll find its way in. If it's McCoy Tyner, there'll be more of that." [...] Mehldau's performances often employ unusual rhythmic meters; for example, he plays his arrangement of [...] "All <b>the</b> <b>Things</b> <b>You</b> Are" [...] on Art of the Trio 4 in 7/4 time, and [...] "I Didn't Know What Time It Was" [...] on Art of the Trio 1 in 5/4. He developed this ability over a period of around a year, with the help of Rossy. Mehldau is able to reach tenth and eleventh intervals on the piano.|$|E
500|$|Morrowind, {{following}} the tradition established by its predecessors in The Elder Scrolls series, is a free-form world, with few constricting boundaries on the player's actions. From {{the beginning of}} the game, players are put in a world where they are left to roam, steal, quest and explore, without necessarily {{following the}} main quest. Lead designer Ken Rolston, asked prior to Morrowinds release what he thought were the [...] "core, untouchable design elements" [...] of the Elder Scrolls series which [...] "set them apart from other games," [...] responded immediately: [...] "Free-form experience." [...] In Rolston's view, the game's central plot is a chance to introduce the player to a cross-current of conflicting factions, background themes, and to the characters of the game, rather than the primary focus of the player's experience. [...] "Every [...] game has to let you create the kind of character you want, and then do <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>you</b> want.

David Arnold said “It's going to be beautiful, cheeky, cheesy, camp, silly and thrilling", and added that [...] "we could have done this 15 times over, and not had the same show, and it would still have been full of amazing British music". He thought that it should be the [...] "greatest after party" [...] and was “really a celebration of Britishness in terms of [...] the arts".

500|$|In 1946 Sinatra {{released}} [...] "Oh! What it Seemed to Be", [...] "Day by Day", [...] "They Say It's Wonderful", [...] "Five Minutes More" [...] and [...] "The Coffee Song" [...] as singles, {{and launched}} his first album, The Voice of Frank Sinatra, [...] which reached No. 1 on the Billboard chart. William Ruhlmann of AllMusic noted that Sinatra [...] "took the material very seriously, singing the love lyrics with utter seriousness", {{and that his}} [...] "singing and the classically influenced settings gave the songs unusual depth of meaning". He was soon selling ten million records a year. Such was Sinatra's command at Columbia that his love of conducting was indulged {{with the release of}} the set Frank Sinatra Conducts the Music of Alec Wilder, an offering unlikely to appeal to Sinatra's core fanbase at the time, which consisted of teenage girls. The following year he released his second album, Songs by Sinatra, featuring songs of a similar mood and tempo such as Irving Berlin's [...] "How Deep is the Ocean?" [...] and Harold Arlen's and Jerome Kern's [...] "All <b>The</b> <b>Things</b> <b>You</b> Are". [...] "Mam'selle", composed by Edmund Goulding with lyrics by Mack Gordon for the film The Razor's Edge (1946), was released as a single. Sinatra had competition; versions by Art Lund, Dick Haymes, Dennis Day, and The Pied Pipers also reached the top ten of the Billboard charts. In December he recorded [...] "Sweet Lorraine" [...] with the Metronome All-Stars, featuring talented jazz musicians such as Coleman Hawkins, Harry Carney and Charlie Shavers, with Nat King Cole on piano, in what Charles L. Granata describes as [...] "one of the highlights of Sinatra's Columbia epoch".|$|E

500|$|Deja Entendus first single, [...] "The Quiet Things That No One Ever Knows", {{impacted}} radio airplay in July 2003, a {{month after}} the album's release. The song was said to be about regret, or, as Lacey stated, [...] "how there can be problems in a relationship and they get ignored. And how that often ends up as a broken home or some kind of bad situation down the road. It's kind of something that if it wasn't overlooked in the first place, you can kind of get through it." [...] The song's music video chronicles the moments after a severe car accident, where a mortally wounded Lacey cannot depart for the next world until he knows that his girlfriend, also injured in the crash, is safe in this one. He says it [...] "is about death or losing someone and it's those moments that you kind of look back on your life and realize all the regrets that you had, and all <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>you</b> wish you could change". They also made a music video for the second single, [...] "Sic Transit Gloria... Glory Fades," [...] where Lacey acts like a human voodoo doll; discovering that when he moves a particular body part, it is mimicked by the target of his action. [...] "Since the song is about taking advantage of someone else," [...] he said, [...] "there's a pretty strong correlation between the video and the song." [...] Both music videos gave the band exposure in the mainstream where Your Favorite Weapon went [...] "virtually unnoticed", with the videos finding [...] "constant" [...] airplay on MTV and the band making its live television debut on Jimmy Kimmel Live!. Furthermore, both singles entered the top 40 on the UK Singles Chart, whilst [...] "The Quiet Things That No One Ever Knows" [...] peaked at number 37 on Billboard's Alternative Songs chart.|$|E
500|$|Heavy {{criticism}} was {{directed toward the}} script, dialogue, and cutscene length. McShea felt that the unskippable cutscenes and [...] "the overabundance of story in Other M were a negative deviation from Metroid tradition". Kollar states that they [...] "often run as long as 15 minutes, exhausting players with repetition of obvious plot points and overwrought dialogue as mature and interesting as a teenager’s diary". Justin Haywald of 1UP.com complained that as the game progresses [...] "instead of getting more {{of the things that}} work , you get more of <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>you</b> don't care about [...] ". Donlan notes that the plot is considered as [...] "the future's dumbest soap opera". Wolinsky echoes the misgivings about Samus' immaturity, petulant behavior, and misguided loyalty. Tae K. Kim of GamePro writes that while the story and Samus' monologues did not compel them, [...] "it helped contextualize her entire existence" [...] which developed the character to [...] "an actual human being who's using the vastness of space to try and put some distance between herself and the past". Contrarily, Haywald found the portrayal [...] "lifeless and boring" [...] and [...] "nonsensical". G4tv's Abbie Heppe was critical on Samus's portrayal; she wrote that Samus [...] "cannot possibly wield the amount of power she possesses unless directed to by a man", and found that her anxiety attack cannot be reconciled with her previous portrayals. In Zero Punctuation, Ben [...] "Yahtzee" [...] Croshaw derided the game's story as a [...] "bloated, cancerous mass [...] turning [...] into a shrieking mimsy in a submissive relationship with a bellend in a fancy cap." [...] Croshaw also states that the gameplay is [...] "infinitely stronger [...] in that it's merely bad." ...|$|E
500|$|Leonardo DiCaprio as Jack Dawson: Cameron said {{he needed}} the cast to {{feel as though they}} were really on the Titanic, to relive its liveliness, and [...] "to take that energy and give it to Jack, [...] an artist who is able to have his heart soar". Jack is portrayed as an itinerant, poor orphan from Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, who has toured {{numerous}} places in the world, including Paris. He wins two tickets onto the RMS Titanic in a poker game and travels as a third-class passenger with his friend Fabrizio. He is attracted to Rose at first sight and meets her when she contemplates throwing herself off the stern of the ship. Her fiance's [...] "reward", an invitation to dine with them the next evening, enables Jack to mix with the first-class passengers for a night. When casting the role, various established actors, including Matthew McConaughey, Chris O'Donnell, Billy Crudup, and Stephen Dorff, were considered, but Cameron felt that a few of the actors were too old for the part of a 20-year-old. Tom Cruise was interested in portraying the character, but his asking price was too much for the studio to consider. Cameron considered Jared Leto for the role, but Leto refused to audition. DiCaprio, 21 years old at the time, was brought to Cameron's attention by casting director Mali Finn. Initially, {{he did not want to}} portray the character and refused to read his first romantic scene on the set (see below). Cameron said, [...] "He read it once, then started goofing around, and I could never get him to focus on it again. But for one split second, a shaft of light came down from the heavens and lit up the forest." [...] Cameron strongly believed in DiCaprio's acting ability and told him, [...] "Look, I'm not going to make this guy brooding and neurotic. I'm not going to give him a tic and a limp and all <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>you</b> want." [...] Cameron rather envisioned the character as a James Stewart type. Although Jack Dawson was a fictional character, in Fairview Cemetery in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where 121 victims are buried, there is a grave labeled [...] "J. Dawson". The real J. Dawson was Joseph Dawson, who shoveled coal in the bowels of the ship. [...] "It wasn't until after the movie came out that we found out that there was a J. Dawson gravestone," [...] said the film's producer, Jon Landau, in an interview.|$|E
