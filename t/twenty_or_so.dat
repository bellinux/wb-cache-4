Apart from these sketches, it is unknown how many of the <b>twenty</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> 17th-century illustrations of the dodos were drawn from life or from stuffed specimens, which affects their reliability.|$|E

25|$|<b>Twenty</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> Berber {{languages}} (also called Tamazight) are {{spoken in}} North Africa. Berber speakers were once predominant over all this large area, {{but as a}} result of Arabization and later local migrations, today Berber languages are reduced to several large regions (in Morocco, Algeria, and the central Sahara) or remain as smaller language islands. Several linguists characterize the Berber spoken as one language with many dialect variations, spread out in discrete regions, without ongoing standardization. The Berber languages may be classified as follows (with some more widely known languages or language groups shown in italics). Ethnic historical correspondence is suggested by the designation |Tribe|.|$|E

Other bodies were found in the houses so badly charred they could not be identified and in positions suggesting they had been burned alive. The victims included many women and children.|$|E

Vitebsk and Abraham Kalisker later led a small ascension to the Land of Israel, establishing a Hasidic presence in the Galilee.|$|E
25|$|TELO usually {{held the}} Indian view of {{problems}} and pushed for India's view during peace talks with Sri Lanka and other groups. LTTE denounced the TELO view and claimed that India was only acting on its own interest. As a result, the LTTE broke from the ENLF in 1986. Soon fighting broke out between the TELO and the LTTE and clashes occurred {{over the next few}} months. As a result, almost the entire TELO leadership and at least 400 TELO militants were killed by the LTTE. The LTTE attacked training camps of the EPRLF a few months later, forcing it to withdraw from the Jaffna peninsula. Notices were issued to the effect that all remaining Tamil insurgents join the LTTE in Jaffna and in Madras, where the Tamil groups were headquartered. With the major groups including the TELO and EPRLF eliminated, the remaining <b>twenty</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> Tamil insurgent group were then absorbed into the LTTE, making Jaffna an LTTE-dominated city.|$|E
25|$|Komagata Maru {{arrived in}} Calcutta on September 27. Upon {{entry into the}} harbour, the ship was stopped by a British gunboat, and the {{passengers}} were placed under guard. The government of the British Raj saw the men on Komagata Maru not only as self-confessed lawbreakers, but also as dangerous political agitators. The British government suspected that white and South Asian radicals were using the incident to create rebellion among South Asians in the Pacific Northwest. When the ship docked at Budge Budge, the police went to arrest Baba Gurdit Singh and the <b>twenty</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> other men that they viewed as leaders. He resisted arrest, {{a friend of his}} assaulted a policeman, and a general riot ensued. Shots were fired and nineteen of the passengers were killed.

Many witnesses in the Blaškić case also referred to soldiers in camouflage uniforms being present, wearing the emblem of the HVO. Several Croat inhabitants of these villages also participated in the attack. They were members of the Domobrani such as Slavko Miličević for the Donji Ahmići sector, Žarko Papić for the Zume area, Branko Perković in Nadioci, Zoran Kupreškić in Grabovi (an area in the centre of Ahmići), Nenad Šantić and Colic in Šantići.|$|E
