5|$|The Guardians TV {{and radio}} blog stated <b>that</b> <b>Friends</b> has {{impacted}} {{the creation of}} other television shows such as How I Met Your Mother. The similarities between the two consist of both sitcoms taking place in Manhattan, a group of white adults who are funny and have similar character traits.|$|E

5|$|After the {{produced}} pilot {{lived up}} to NBC's hopes, the series premiered with the name Friends on September 22, 1994, in the coveted Thursday 8:30p.m. timeslot. The pilot aired between Mad About You and Seinfeld, and was watched by almost 22million American viewers. The series was a huge success throughout its run, and was a staple of NBC's Thursday night line-up, dubbed by the network as Must See TV. When Crane told reporters in 2001 that the ninth season was a possibility, critics believed that he was posturing, and {{that at least two}} of the cast members would not sign on for another season. When it was confirmed <b>that</b> <b>Friends</b> would return for a ninth season, the news was mainly about the amount of money—$7million per episode—that it took to bring the series back for another season.|$|E

25|$|As fashions {{changed over}} time, the Quaker ideal of plain dress stood out against {{contemporary}} clothing. As a result, the {{traditional forms of}} this practice were dropped by most Friends. Today, {{it is more likely}} <b>that</b> <b>Friends</b> will try to put their faith into action by dressing in a plain version of current fashions— such as avoiding clothing displaying designer labels. They may also try to buy only the clothing they need, and pay more for fairly traded clothing that has been made ethically.|$|E
25|$|Exactly a {{week after}} his 84th {{birthday}} and while in good health, Denis McLoughlin committed suicide. He used a Colt revolver that {{had been part of}} his reference collection for years and <b>that</b> <b>friends</b> and family thought was non-functioning.

However, he had survived all of the persons dearest to him including his wife, Dorothy, and brother, Colin. Denis and Dorothy had no children.|$|E

25|$|In {{a signed}} affidavit, Siddiqui's {{maternal}} uncle, Shams ul-Hassan Faruqi, stated that on 22 January 2008 she {{visited him in}} Islamabad and told him she had been held by Pakistani agencies. Knowing he had worked in Afghanistan and made contact with the Taliban in 1999, she asked for his help to cross into Taliban-controlled Afghanistan where {{she thought she would}} be safe. He told her he was no longer in touch with them. He notified his sister, Siddiqui's mother, who came the next day to see her daughter. He said that Siddiqui stayed with them for two days. Investigating the disappearance, a US journalist (Deborah Scroggins) reported that Geo TV presenter Hamid Mir informed her <b>that</b> <b>friends</b> of Siddiqui believed she had gone underground avoiding the FBI. Scroggins was also warned by Pakistanis with jihadist connections (including Khalid Khawaja) that she (Scroggins) might end up like Daniel Pearl (beheaded) if she attempted to pursue finding Siddiqui.|$|E
500|$|Timberlake added <b>that</b> <b>Friends</b> with Benefits is a {{film for}} [...] "our generation; people that are between 25 and 30 years of age that are moving into a {{different}} part of their life. [...] They are not sure what type of commitment they are comfortable with or what they're gonna do {{for the rest of their}} life".|$|E
500|$|Polenberg {{describes}} Cardozo's lifelong {{devotion to}} {{his older sister}} Nell, with whom he lived in New York until her death in 1929. When asked why he had never married, Cardozo replied, quietly and sadly, [...] "I never could give Nellie the second place in my life." [...] Polenberg suggests <b>that</b> <b>friends</b> may have stressed Cardozo's devotion to his sister to discourage rumors [...] "that he was sexually dysfunctional, or had an unusually low sexual drive or was homosexual." [...] But he produces {{no evidence to support}} any of these possibilities, except to note <b>that</b> <b>friends,</b> in describing Cardozo, used words like [...] "beautiful", [...] "exquisite", [...] "sensitive" [...] or [...] "delicate." [...] Andrew Kaufman, author of Cardozo, a biography published in 2000, notes that [...] "Although one cannot be absolutely certain, it seems highly likely that Cardozo lived a celibate life". Judge Learned Hand is quoted in the book as saying about Cardozo: [...] "He [...] no trace of homosexuality anyway".|$|E

500|$|The story first differs in quests 501–525 (occurring {{just before}} Skuld's introduction), where the player {{encounters}} two Keyblade wielders {{from a different}} union. One is antisocial, rejecting friendship from both his fellow union member and the player. When the second wielder is injured saving the first from his own reckless attack on {{a new breed of}} Heartless, the player helps avenge him. The first wielder reveals that he has been pushing his friends away to keep them safe, [...] but he now agrees <b>that</b> <b>friends</b> are one's true power.|$|E
500|$|As he {{approached}} his sixties, Waugh was in poor health, prematurely aged, [...] "fat, deaf, short of breath", according to Patey. His biographer Martin Stannard likened his appearance {{around this time}} to that of [...] "an exhausted rogue jollied up by drink". In 1962 Waugh began work on his autobiography, and that same year wrote his final fiction, the long short story Basil Seal Rides Again. This revival of the protagonist of Black Mischief and Put Out More Flags was published in 1963; the Times Literary Supplement called it a [...] "nasty little book". When {{the first volume of}} autobiography, A Little Learning, was published in 1964, Waugh's often oblique tone and discreet name changes ensured <b>that</b> <b>friends</b> avoided the embarrassments that some had feared.|$|E

500|$|In 2001, Schwimmer played Captain Herbert M. Sobel in Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks' HBO World War II miniseries Band of Brothers. The {{television}} miniseries {{is based}} on the book of the same title written by historian and biographer Stephen Ambrose. Although Band of Brothers was met with largely positive reception, Schwimmer's performance was criticized; the BBC News concluded, [...] "Part of the problem... may have been the ridiculous fact <b>that</b> <b>Friends</b> favourite David Schwimmer plays the hard and cruel Captain Herbert Sobel. The only thing believable about Schwimmer's acting is when he cowers in the face of true battle. His puppy dog eyes make him appear even more pitiful". Later that year he portrayed Yitzhak Zuckerman in the war drama Uprising, based on the true events of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising in 1943.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Movieline, Gluck further discussed the film's plot saying <b>that</b> <b>Friends</b> with Benefits would relate largely with a younger generation. He added: [...] "They comment about these romantic comedies throughout the movie, and as they go through their storyline, they realize that they’re in a romantic comedy story — as two regular people who aren’t in a movie would comment on. They’re very cognizant that they’re in this story [...] but they end up embracing the fact that they’re going through a romantic comedy moment." [...] In {{an interview}} with the Los Angeles Times, Timberlake explained that he and Gluck held authorship of humor and tone in regards to Friends with Benefits. Timberlake and Kunis workshopped the script {{for more than a month}} before the movie went into production. Gluck would meet with the actors with 20 pages of script in front of him and the three would beat it up, changing lines, and defending each character's perspective.|$|E
500|$|Republicans {{and other}} critics saw the events differently. [...] They alleged <b>that</b> <b>friends</b> of President Bill Clinton, {{including}} his third cousin Catherine Cornelius, had sought the firings {{in order to get}} the business for themselves. [...] Dale and his staff had been replaced with Little Rock, Arkansas-based World Wide Travel, a company with a substantial reputation in the industry but with several ties to the Clintons. [...] In addition, Hollywood producer and Inauguration chairman Harry Thomason, a friend of both Clintons, and his business partner, Darnell Martens, were looking to get their air charter company, TRM, the White House business in place of Airline of the Americas. [...] The Clinton campaign had been TRM's sole client during 1992, collecting commissions from booking charter flights for the campaign. [...] Martens wanted the White House to award TRM a $500,000 contract for an aircraft audit, while also seeking Travel Office charter business as an intermediary which did not own any planes.|$|E
