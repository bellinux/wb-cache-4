The part of the Trinity River watershed in Humboldt County is also sparsely populated, with the exception of the Hoopa Valley Reservation, which was home to 2,930 people as of 2011. Extractive industries such as mining and logging, and to a limited extent farming and ranching, have been the main economic drivers in the Trinity River basin since European settlement in the 1800s. These have declined in part due <b>to</b> <b>increasing</b> environmental regulations. Tourism has been an increasingly important part of the economy especially after the creation of the Trinity Lake reservoir in 1964.|$|E

A Syrian delegation then headed for Cairo to persuade Nasser to accept unity with Syria, but Nasser expressed his reservations regarding unity to the delegates and Quwatli, who was in Damascus. Nasser was wary of the Syrian military's habitual interference in the country's political affairs and the stark difference in the countries' economies and political systems. The Syrian political and military leadership continued to press Nasser out of both sincere commitment to Arab nationalism and a realization that only unification with Egypt could prevent impending strife in the country due <b>to</b> <b>increasing</b> communist influence.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the time}} of {{reaching}} peak intensity, Mireille turned more to the northwest along the southwestern periphery of the subtropical ridge. The increasing size began to impart wind shear in Typhoon Nat to the west, and the two storms underwent the Fujiwhara effect, in which Nat turned sharply southward while Mireille progressed toward the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. After maintaining peak winds for about 30hours, Mireille began weakening, passing just east of Miyako-jima on September26 with 10‑minute winds of 165km/h (105mph), according to the JMA. That day, the typhoon accelerated to the northeast due <b>to</b> <b>increasing</b> mid-level winds from the southwest, passing west of Okinawa. According to the JMA, Mireille re-intensified slightly on September27 to a secondary peak of 175km/h (110mph), aided by unusually warm water temperatures in the East China Sea. The typhoon made landfall at that strength at 07:00UTC between Saikai and Nagasaki along southwest Kyushu. The pressure at landfall was , {{the lowest in the}} country since Typhoon Trix in 1971.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of Erika's classification, {{forecast}} models diverged significantly on the potential future of Erika. Statistical guidance and the HWRF depicted a hurricane while the ECMWF and GFS showed a weaker system due <b>to</b> <b>increasing</b> wind shear. The models that intensified the storm indicated a more northerly track while those that kept it weaker had the system continuing along a westward course. Accordingly, the NHC noted low confidence in their five-day forecast for Erika. This uncertainty ultimately reflected in above-average forecast errors when compared to all tropical cyclones, but roughly average for weak, poorly organized systems. Throughout August25 and into early August26, the convective organization of Erika fluctuated due to wind shear and entrainment of dry air, periodically leaving the center of circulation devoid of convection.|$|E
