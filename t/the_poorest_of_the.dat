5|$|It targets <b>the</b> <b>poorest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> poor, with a {{particular}} emphasis on women, who receive 95 percent of the bank's loans. Women traditionally had less access to financial alternatives of ordinary credit lines and incomes. They were seen to have an inequitable share of power in household decision making. Yunus and others have found that lending to women generates considerable secondary effects, including empowerment of a marginalised segment of society (Yunus and Jolis 1998), who share betterment of income with their children, unlike many men. Yunus claims that in 2004, women still have difficulty getting loans; they comprise less than 1 percent of borrowers from commercial banks (Yunus 2004). The interest rates charged by microfinance institutes including Grameen Bank is high {{compared to that of}} traditional banks; Grameen's interest (reducing balance basis) on its main credit product is about 20%.|$|E
5|$|The equestrians, {{the highest}} social class of all, served in mounted units known as equites. The first {{class of the}} richest {{citizens}} served as heavy infantry with swords and long spears (resembling hoplites), and provided {{the first line of}} the battle formation. The second class were armed similarly to the first class, but without a breastplate for protection, and with an oblong rather than a round shield. The second class stood immediately behind the first class when the army was drawn up in battle formation. The third and fourth classes were more lightly armed and carried a thrusting-spear and javelins. The third class stood behind the second class in battle formation, normally providing javelin support. <b>The</b> <b>poorest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> propertied men of the city comprised the fifth class. They were generally too poor to afford much equipment at all and were armed as skirmishers with slings and stones. They were deployed in a screen in front of the main army, covering its approach and masking its manoeuvres.|$|E
5|$|The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and International Monetary Fund (IMF) were {{established}} by delegates at the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944 and became operational in 1946. The IBRD was established {{with the original}} mission of financing the reconstruction efforts of war-torn European nations following World War II, with goals shared by the later Marshall Plan. The Bank issued its inaugural loan of $250 million ($2.6 billion in 2012 dollars) to France in 1947 to finance infrastructure projects. The institution also established its first field offices in Paris, France, Copenhagen, Denmark, and Prague in the former Czechoslovakia. Throughout {{the remainder of the}} 1940s and 1950s, the Bank financed projects seeking to dam rivers, generate electricity, and improve access to water and sanitation. It also invested in France, Belgium, and Luxembourg's steel industry. Following the reconstruction of Europe, the Bank's mandate has transitioned to eradicating poverty around the world. In 1960, the International Development Association (IDA) was established to serve as the Bank's concessional lending arm and provide low and no-cost finance and grants to <b>the</b> <b>poorest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> developing countries as measured by gross national income per capita.|$|E

25|$|Cork's {{most famous}} {{building}} {{is the church}} tower of Shandon, which dominates the North side of the city. It {{is widely regarded as}} the symbol of the city. The North and East sides are faced in red sandstone, and the West and South sides are clad in the predominant stone of the region, white limestone. At the top sits a weather vane {{in the form of an}} eleven-foot salmon. Another site in Shandon is Skiddy's Almshouse which was built in the 18th century to provide a home to <b>the</b> <b>poorest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city.|$|E
25|$|Those in the {{business}} have considered domesticating the mopane worms {{in a manner that}} is similar to the domestication of silkworms. The industry would thus be less susceptible to the pitfalls that are associated with it, such as climatic change, drought and other factors that could compromise a harvest. For a domesticated industry to succeed on a small scale and be accessible to <b>the</b> <b>poorest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> poor, the cost of production would have to be comparable with the cost of wild worms or dried worms at the market.|$|E

25|$|In contrast, the North American Jurassic {{record is}} <b>the</b> <b>poorest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mesozoic, with few {{outcrops}} at the surface. Though the epicontinental Sundance Sea left marine deposits {{in parts of}} the northern plains of the United States and Canada during the late Jurassic, most exposed sediments from this period are continental, such as the alluvial deposits of the Morrison Formation. The first of several massive batholiths were emplaced in the northern Cordillera beginning in the mid-Jurassic, marking the Nevadan orogeny. Important Jurassic exposures are also found in Russia, India, South America, Japan, Australasia and the United Kingdom.|$|E
25|$|Economic {{development}} did {{not bring}} prosperity to all. During the 1960s many of the rural poor felt increasingly dissatisfied with their condition in society and disillusioned by their treatment by the central government in Bangkok. Efforts by the Thai government to develop poor rural regions often {{did not have the}} desired effect in that they contributed to the farmers' awareness of how bad off they really were. It {{is interesting to note that}} it was not always <b>the</b> <b>poorest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> poor who joined the anti-government insurgency. Increased government presence in the rural villages did little to improve the situation. Villagers became subject to increased military and police harassment and bureaucratic corruption. Villagers often felt betrayed when government promises of development were frequently not fulfilled. By the early 1970s rural discontent had manifested itself into a peasant's activist movement.|$|E

Tor.com reviewer Keith DeCandido was less positive, feeling that it [...] "earned" [...] its reputation as <b>the</b> <b>poorest</b> <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Next Generation seven seasons because [...] "the episodes were uneven, poorly plotted, ineptly scripted, and acted by actors who were still trying to figure their characters out".

2500|$|Among {{the republics}} of the former Soviet Union, Tajikistan {{was the last to}} issue its own currency. Transnistria, an unrecognized state, issued its own ruble before Tajikistan did. The reason for this was largely lack of funds and resources, with Tajikistan being <b>the</b> <b>poorest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> former soviet republics and {{absorbing}} its share of the former union's economic collapse. [...] This was compounded further by the disorganization caused by the civil war in Tajikistan.|$|E

2500|$|If {{someone is}} from an {{ethnicity}} whose recent ancestors {{had no problem}} with public nudity (parts of Africa, Asia, pre-European Americas, Australia, and the Pacific Islands), it might be thought of as being [...] "primitive" [...] by modern standards, and lacking in social status. (i.e. [...] "Only <b>the</b> <b>poorest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> poor would go about without clothing.") This contrasts with the more Western attitude that nudity and sexuality are somehow related, but nonetheless causes them to shy away from social nudity.|$|E
2500|$|Muhammad Yunus ( [...] ; born 28 June 1940) is a Bangladeshi social entrepreneur, banker, economist, {{and civil}} society leader who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for {{founding}} the Grameen Bank and pioneering the concepts of microcredit and microfinance. These loans are given to entrepreneurs too poor to qualify for traditional bank loans. In 2006, Yunus and the Grameen Bank were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize [...] "for their efforts through microcredit to create {{economic and social development}} from below". The Norwegian Nobel Committee said that [...] "lasting peace cannot be achieved unless large population groups find ways in which to break out of poverty" [...] and that [...] "across cultures and civilizations, Yunus and Grameen Bank have shown that even <b>the</b> <b>poorest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> poor can work to bring about their own development".

Following the onslaught of Super Typhoon Lawin, Robredo visited Cagayan and met with Cagayan Governor Manuel Mamba and local disaster officials to inquire about the damage, which will be the basis for the kind of assistance her office will provide.
