In the suburban Pennsylvania school district targeted in this study, there was little district-sponsored professional development (PD) available to general education teachers regarding strategies for <b>teaching</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>disabilities</b> in the inclusion setting. The purpose of this quasi-experimental study was to determine whether a difference exists in perceived TSE when instructing in the inclusion setting compared with the traditional setting, and whether an association exists linking prior experience and organizational support in the form of PD with TSE. Bandura 2 ̆ 7 s social cognitive theory framed this study. A sample of 99 secondary general education teachers completed a 3 -part online survey including the TSES and TSES-Learning Disabilities (LD) scales measuring self-efficacy in the traditional and inclusion settings, and demographic questions that served as potential predictors of self-efficacy. Correlated t tests and partial correlations were used to test for differences in perceived TSE across the inclusion and traditional settings and to test whether demographic factors were associated with TSE. Teachers perceived themselves as less efficacious in the inclusion setting when compared to instructing general education students in a traditional classroom, and setting-specific training was the greatest predictor of TSE.

This {{physical activity}} guidebook was designed to be used in a public school setting to fulfill physical education minutes as guided by the National Association for Sport and Physical Education (NASPE). The activity guidebook is comprised of fifty physical activity lessons broken into four areas of fitness. All lessons are designed to enhance levels of muscular strength, cardiovascular endurance, flexibility and psychological well-being. Each lesson is broken down into; title, concept, secondary concept(s), activity goal, equipment, set-up, step-by-step procedure, low and high variations, and informal assessment questions. The guidebook also includes a section on safety considerations, NASPE standards and guidelines, tips for success, and a how to use section. Literature related to the benefits of physical activity for children and adolescents with severe physical disabilities was reviewed. Also included was related literature on; special education legislation, international and national guidelines/recommendations for physical activity, a review of exercise intervention programs in the areas of flexibility, muscular strength, cardiovascular endurance, and psychological well-being, as well as effective approaches to <b>teaching</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>disabilities</b> and effective approaches to <b>teaching</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>disabilities</b> in physical education.
