5|$|Since a {{proposal}} by Butinov and Knorozov in the 1950s, {{the majority of}} philologists, linguists and cultural historians have taken the line that rongorongo was not true writing but proto-writing, that is, an ideographic- and rebus-based mnemonic device, such as the Dongba script of the Nakhi people, which would in all likelihood make it impossible <b>to</b> <b>decipher.</b> This skepticism is justified {{not only by the}} failure of the numerous attempts at decipherment, but by the extreme rarity of independent writing systems around the world. Of those who have attempted <b>to</b> <b>decipher</b> rongorongo as a true writing system, the vast majority have assumed it was logographic, a few that it was syllabic or mixed. Statistically it appears to have been compatible with neither a pure logography nor a pure syllabary. The topic of the texts is unknown; various investigators have speculated they cover genealogy, navigation, astronomy, or agriculture. Oral history suggests that only a small elite were ever literate, and that the tablets were considered sacred.|$|E
5|$|The {{attempted}} expedition had {{a significant}} consequence. Wassmuss left Constantinople to organise the tribes in south Persia to act against British interests. While evading British capture in Persia, Wassmuss inadvertently abandoned his codebook. Its recovery by Britain allowed the Allies <b>to</b> <b>decipher</b> German communications, including the Zimmermann Telegram in 1917. Niedermayer led the group following Wassmuss's departure.|$|E

5|$|Commander Henry Alexander Stuart-Menteth DSC, usually {{shortened}} to Alex Stuart-Menteth (26 August 1912– 14 May 2000) was a British {{naval officer}} {{famous for his}} service in the Royal Navy, particularly during World War II where he assisted in the sinking of two U-boats; and helped capture Enigma code fragments which enabled Bletchley Park <b>to</b> <b>decipher</b> the code. He commanded six ships during his career. He married in 1952, having two sons and a daughter, and seven grandchildren in turn.|$|E
5|$|Even in {{the absence}} of close contact between {{humanity}} and extraterrestrials, high-information messages from an extraterrestrial civilization to humanity have the potential to cause a great cultural shock. Sociologist Donald Tarter has conjectured that knowledge of extraterrestrial culture and theology has the potential to compromise human allegiance to existing organizational structures and institutions. The cultural shock of meeting an extraterrestrial civilization may be spread over decades or even centuries if an extraterrestrial message to humanity is extremely difficult <b>to</b> <b>decipher.</b>|$|E
5|$|Food webs {{are often}} limited {{relative}} to the real world. Complete empirical measurements are generally restricted to a specific habitat, such as a cave or a pond, and principles gleaned from food web microcosm studies are extrapolated to larger systems. Feeding relations require extensive investigations into the gut contents of organisms, which can be difficult <b>to</b> <b>decipher,</b> or stable isotopes {{can be used to}} trace the flow of nutrient diets and energy through a food web. Despite these limitations, food webs remain a valuable tool in understanding community ecosystems.|$|E

5|$|In 1965, the USAF began {{operating}} two-seat North American F-100F Super Sabres specially {{equipped for}} Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses mission in Vietnam.

The second crew member was a Navigator trained as an Electronic Warfare Officer (EWO) <b>to</b> <b>decipher</b> sensor information and guide the pilot towards the targets. However, the F-100F was an interim solution, since its limited payload often required multiple aircraft to conduct a successful strike; it also lacked the speed and endurance to effectively protect the F-105.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not until}} 1799, with the Napoleonic {{discovery}} of a trilingual (i.e. hieroglyphic, Demotic, Greek) stela inscription on the Rosetta Stone, that modern scholars were able <b>to</b> <b>decipher</b> ancient Egyptian literature. The first major effort to translate the hieroglyphs of the Rosetta Stone was made by Jean-François Champollion (1790–1832) in 1822. The earliest translation efforts of Egyptian literature during the 19th century were attempts to confirm Biblical events.|$|E
5|$|One of Lem's major {{recurring}} themes, beginning {{from his}} very first novel, The Man from Mars, was the impossibility of communication between profoundly alien beings, which may have no common ground with human intelligence, and humans. The best known example is the living planetary ocean in Lem's novel Solaris. Other examples include swarms of mechanical insects (in The Invincible), and strangely ordered societies of more human-like beings in Fiasco and Eden, describing {{the failure of the}} first contact. In His Master's Voice, Lem describes the failure of humanity's intelligence <b>to</b> <b>decipher</b> and truly comprehend an apparent message from space.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} discoveries made during Napoleon's campaign in Egypt was the Rosetta Stone.

It was seized by British Forces following the defeat of Napoleon in Egypt and the subsequent signing of the Treaty of Alexandria in 1801. It is now on display at the British Museum.|$|E

5|$|The Antiquary {{was printed}} at Mazgaon, Bombay, by the Bombay Education Society {{and later the}} British India Press, but {{illustrations}} were produced in London by the firm of Griggs who were known for the accuracy of their work. A high standard of reproduction was essential so that scholars could work on the epigraphic material without needing to see the originals. Illustrations in the Antiquary were used by scholars such as Bhandarkar, Bhagvanlal Indraji, Georg Bühler, John Faithfull Fleet, Eggeling and B.

5|$|Around {{the first}} century AD, the Coptic {{alphabet}} started to be used alongside the Demotic script. Coptic is a modified Greek alphabet {{with the addition of}} some Demotic signs. Although formal hieroglyphs were used in a ceremonial role until the fourth century, towards the end only a small handful of priests could still read them. As the traditional religious establishments were disbanded, knowledge of hieroglyphic writing was mostly lost. Attempts <b>to</b> <b>decipher</b> them date to the Byzantine and Islamic periods in Egypt, but only in 1822, after the discovery of the Rosetta stone and years of research by Thomas Young and Jean-François Champollion, were hieroglyphs almost fully deciphered.|$|E
5|$|Author Robert Rodriguez {{writes that}} {{the content of the}} five loops has {{continued}} to invite debate among commentators, however, and that the manipulation applied to each of the recordings has made them impossible <b>to</b> <b>decipher</b> with authority. Based on the most widely held views, he says that, aside from McCartney's laughter and the B flat major chord, the sounds were two loops of sitar passages, both reversed and sped up, and a loop of Mellotron string and brass voicings. In their book Recording the Beatles, Kevin Ryan and Brian Kehew list two loops of sitar recordings yet, rather than Mellotron, list a mandolin or acoustic guitar, treated with tape echo.|$|E

Regina can walk, run, turn, backpedal, push and climb objects, and perform a 180-degree turn. A map is available which will show Regina's location, destination, save points, and locked doors. Save points are rooms which will prompt the player to save upon exiting them. Some doors are locked by a D.D.K. (digital disk key) device. To open these doors, the player will need both a code disc and input disc which can then be used <b>to</b> <b>decipher</b> a code and unlock the door. There are also force fields of red beams throughout the complex which can be activated to block access to intruders.|$|E

5|$|Imaginos was envisioned {{as a rock}} opera to be {{published}} as a trilogy of double albums, with a storyline encompassing about two hundred years of history, {{from the beginning of}} the 19th century to the end of the 20th. This album represents an abbreviated version of the first volume of that planned trilogy, but with the songs arranged out of order, rendering the story harder to comprehend. Even when the song lyrics are analyzed in the chronological order that was devised by the authors and is followed in this section, the narrative progression is scarce and the content often difficult <b>to</b> <b>decipher</b> for the casual reader.
