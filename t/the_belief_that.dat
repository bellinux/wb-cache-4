5|$|Being a scientist, {{above all}} else, Huxley {{presented}} agnosticism {{as a form}} of demarcation. A hypothesis with no supporting objective, testable evidence is not an objective, scientific claim. As such, there would be no way to test said hypotheses, leaving the results inconclusive. His agnosticism was not compatible with forming a belief as to the truth, or falsehood, of the claim at hand. Karl Popper would also describe himself as an agnostic. According to philosopher William L. Rowe, in this strict sense, agnosticism is the view that human reason is incapable of providing sufficient rational grounds to justify either <b>the</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> God exists or <b>the</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> God does not exist.|$|E

5|$|The Whole Object Assumption is <b>the</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> labels {{refer to}} whole objects instead of parts or {{properties}} of those objects.

5|$|According to the {{economist}} Zdzisław Sadowski, the Poles were generally euphoric {{about the end}} of the era of communist rule and Soviet domination. Because of <b>the</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> the Balcerowicz Plan would quickly result in universal Western-like prosperity, the plan enjoyed broad social support, which would cause any conceivable competing pursuits of more moderate economic policies to be politically unrealistic.|$|E

5|$|Although all of Kant's work {{develops}} his ethical theory, it is {{most clearly}} defined in Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals, Critique of Practical Reason and Metaphysics of Morals. As part of the Enlightenment tradition, Kant based his ethical theory on <b>the</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> reason {{should be used to}} determine how people ought to act. He did not attempt to prescribe specific action, but instructed that reason should be used to determine how to behave.|$|E

40|$|Prior {{studies have}} shown that cyber-ostracism {{increases}} aggression. The present research provided the first experimental support for the prediction that assuring a sense of growth after cyber-ostracism can weaken the effect of cyber-ostracism on aggression. Specifically, we found that ostracized participants who were primed with <b>the</b> <b>beliefs</b> <b>that</b> ostracism was detrimental behaved more aggressively than their included counterparts. In contrast, ostracized participants who were primed with <b>the</b> <b>beliefs</b> <b>that</b> ostracism could aid their growth and development no longer behaved aggressively. These findings highlight the significance of post-ostracism cognitive processes in influencing various behavioral responses of ostracism and other interpersonal maltreatments in the cyberspace. Implications are discussed...|$|R
5|$|Before the {{emergence}} of the holiness movement in the mid-19th century and Pentecostalism in the early 20th century, most denominations believed that Christians received the baptism with the Holy Spirit either upon conversion and regeneration or through rites of Christian initiation, such as water baptism and confirmation. Since the growth and spread of Pentecostal and charismatic churches, however, <b>the</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> the baptism with the Holy Spirit is an experience distinct from Christian initiation has come into increasing prominence.|$|E
