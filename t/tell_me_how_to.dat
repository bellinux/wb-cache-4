5000|$|Vacationing in Mexico, Massino {{immediately}} {{met with}} each of the Bonanno capos to tell them {{he did not know what}} happened to Sciascia and theorized it was a bad drug deal.

2500|$|In {{a high-pitched}} voice he said, [...] "Can you <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> get..." [...] but then quickly {{produced}} a revolver. He shot {{each of the}} victims once and, as they {{fell to the ground}} injured, he fired several more times, striking the apartment building before running away. A neighbor heard the gunshots, rushed out of the apartment building, and saw a blond man rush by gripping a pistol in his left hand.

2500|$|Rihanna {{possesses}} a mezzo-soprano vocal range of three octaves and two notes. While recording tracks for her third studio album, Good Girl Gone Bad (2007), Rihanna took vocal lessons from Ne-Yo. Speaking {{of the experience}} she stated, [...] "I've never had vocal training, so when I'm in the studio, he'll <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> breathe and stuff... He'll call out these big fancy words: 'OK, I {{want you to do}} staccato.' And I'm like, 'OK, I don't know what that is.'" [...] Her vocal performance on Loud (2010) received positive reviews from music critics. James Skinner from BBC praised Rihanna's vocals on the song [...] "Love the Way You Lie (Part II)" [...] and wrote that her voice is powerful and that [...] "it is Rihanna's vocal– at once commanding, soulful and vulnerable– that anchors the song, and Loud itself". Andy Gill from The Independent feels that [...] "California King Bed" [...] features her best vocal performance. In a review of Unapologetic, Billboard magazine wrote, [...] "Diamonds finds Rihanna doing one of her throatiest, most impassioned vocals to date, on this inspirational pop ballad." [...] Jon Caramanica of The New York Times stated, [...] "over the years, as her game face froze in place, her voice cured into a weapon of emotional chill and strategic indifference. It's decidedly unfriendly, made to give orders".|$|E
2500|$|In {{the spring}} of 2005, Bright {{received}} a call from Joe Galante, chairman of Sony BMG Nashville, when Galante was meeting with Clive Davis. They called Bright to see if he would be interested in producing that year’s American Idol winner, Carrie Underwood. Bright had seen Underwood on the show, but never dreamed that he would ever have an opportunity to be her producer. Galante said [...] "I want you to meet her — if she likes you, you'll make a record". [...] Bright flew to Kansas City with Galante to meet Underwood. Two weeks later, Bright and Underwood were in the studio making Some Hearts. [...] Bright was unaware that a battle had ensued because Clive Davis wanted another producer, but Galante wanted Bright. Underwood liked Bright, and they developed a good working relationship. She said of Bright, [...] "He'll say [...] 'try something different there' [...] but he doesn't <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> sing". [...] Bright was given one month to produce her first album from beginning to end. At the time, Underwood was on the road with the American Idol Tour, so Bright had to go to wherever she was, taking her microphone and special equipment to local studios in San Francisco and Seattle to finish her vocal tracks. Davis wanted to hedge his bet on Underwood by having her album include pop as well as county songs, but Underwood did not like the pop material. Davis insisted that production of the album be split to where Dann Huff produced the pop songs, and Bright did the country. [...] The final product, Some Hearts, released in 2005, won three Grammy Awards and Underwood won a Grammy for Best New Artist. The album became the best-selling solo female debut album in country music history and as of 2016, had sold 8 million copies. He also produced Underwood’s NBC Sunday Night Football intro/theme songs. The first was [...] "Waiting all day for Sunday night" [...] which was replaced in 2016 using a new tune based on Underwood's country song [...] "Somethin' Bad", but with new lyrics and other changes to fit the show.|$|E
