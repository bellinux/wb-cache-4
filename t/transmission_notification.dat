40|$|Abstract—This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} engineering energy-efficient target detection applications using unattended Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) for long-lasting surveillance of areas of interest. As battery energy depletion is an issue in this context, an approach consists of switching on and off sensing and communication modules of wireless sensors according to duty cycles. Making these modules work in an intermittent fashion impacts (i) the latency of <b>notification</b> <b>transmission</b> (depending on the communication duty cycle) and (ii) the probability of missed target detection (depending {{on the number of}} deployed nodes and the sensing duty cycle). In order to optimize the system parameters according to performance objectives, we first derive an analytical engineering toolkit which evaluates the probability of missed detection (Pmd), the <b>notification</b> <b>transmission</b> latency (D), and the network lifetime (L) under the assumption of random node deployment. Then, we show how this toolbox can be used to optimally configure system parameters under realistic performance constraints. I...|$|R
40|$|Zika virus (ZIKV) is an {{emergent}} threat provoking {{a worldwide}} explosive outbreak. Since January 2015, 41 countries reported autochthonous cases. In Brazil, {{an increase in}} Guillain-Barré syndrome and microcephaly cases was linked to ZIKV infections. A recent report describing low experimental transmission efficiency of its main putative vector, Ae. aegypti, in conjunction with apparent sexual <b>transmission</b> <b>notifications,</b> prompted the investigation of other potential sources of viral dissemination. Urine and saliva have been previously established as useful tools in ZIKV diagnosis. Here, we described the presence and isolation of infectious ZIKV particles from saliva and urine of acute phase patients in the Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil. Nine urine and five saliva samples from nine patients from Rio de Janeiro presenting rash and other typical Zika acute phase symptoms were inoculated in Vero cell culture and submitted to specific ZIKV RNA detection and quantification through, respectively, NAT-Zika, RT-PCR and RT-qPCR. Two ZIKV isolates were achieved, one from urine and one from saliva specimens. ZIKV nucleic acid was identified by all methods in four patients. Whenever both urine and saliva samples were available from the same patient, urine viral loads were higher, corroborating the general sense {{that it is a}} better source for ZIKV molecular diagnostic. In spite of this, from the two isolated strains, each from one patient, only one derived from urine, suggesting that other factors, like the acidic nature of this fluid, might interfere with virion infectivity. The complete genome of both ZIKV isolates was obtained. Phylogenetic analysis revealed similarity with strains previously isolated during the South America outbreak. The detection of infectious ZIKV particles in urine and saliva of patients during the acute phase may represent a critical factor in the spread of virus. The epidemiological relevance of this finding, regarding the contribution of alternative non-vectorial ZIKV transmission routes, needs further investigation...|$|R

40|$|Wireless {{networks}} are {{founded on the}} principles of collision avoidance. This paper makes an attempt to detect and abort collisions in wireless networks. Briefly, the receiver uses physical layer information to detect collisions, and immediately notifies the transmitter to abort <b>transmission.</b> The collision <b>notification</b> consists of a unique signature, sent on the same frequency channel as the data. The transmitter uses a second listener antenna to discern this notification through signature correlation. The transmitter aborts, freeing the channel for other productive transmissions. We call this Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Notification (CSMA/CN). Early results from a small USRP/GNURadio testbed confirm the feasibility and performance gains with CSMA/CN...|$|R

However, due to the wakeup overhead and waiting periods the total energy consumption of periodic measurements and network listening is considerably increased.

These autonomously handle simple sub-tasks of the periodic activities while the CPU stays in an inactive low power mode. The CPU is only activated if further processing is required (e. g. <b>transmission</b> of a <b>notification</b> packet via the wireless network if the measurement value has changed).

40|$|The power {{consumption}} of different implementations of a sensor interface utilized for {{wireless sensor network}} nodes are investigated. Most sensor network nodes use a CPU to implement the main functionality in software. This maintains flexibility compared with a pure ASIC implementation. Unfortunately, to utilize the CPU for simple tasks as periodically controlling the data acquisition proved expensive in terms of energy consumption due to the wakeupoverhead and several waiting periods. As an alternative a special reconfigurable peripheral block is introduced into the WSN SoC. It is responsible for these measurements while the CPU stays in an inactive “sleep mode”. It is only activated if further processing is required (e. g. <b>transmission</b> of a <b>notification</b> packet via the wireless network if the measurement value has changed). A huge reduction of {{power consumption}} {{by a factor of}} 30 was achieved.

It is necessary to have a complete view of the “system”. Inside the reg. 178 / 2002 you can see articles: 35 (Rapid alert system); in Chapter IV (Rapid alert system, crisis management and emergencies) : Section I (Rapid alert system), articles 50 - 52; Section 2 (Emergencies), articles 53 - 54; Section 3 (Crisis management), articles 55 - 56. Therefore, this “system” should not be reduced only into the articles 50 - 52 of the Reg. 178 / 2002, involving regulations, procedures, conditions, providing into a complex interaction about different subjects public and private.

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. Eng.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, 2006. The Internet has {{experienced}} a tremendous growth {{over the past two}} decades and with that growth have come severe congestion problems. Research efforts to alleviate the congestion problem can broadly be classified into three groups: Cl) Router based congestion detection; (2) Generation and <b>transmission</b> of congestion <b>notification</b> signal to the traffic sources; (3) End-to-end algorithms which control the flow of traffic between the end hosts. This dissertation has largely addressed the first two groups which are basically router initiated. Router based congestion detection mechanisms, commonly known as Active Queue Management (AQM), can be classified into two groups: conventional mathematical analytical techniques and fuzzy logic based techniques. Research has shown that fuzzy logic techniques are more effective and robust compared to the conventional techniques because they do not rely on the availability of a precise mathematical model of Internet. They use linguistic knowledge and are, therefore, better placed to handle the complexities associated with the non-linearity and dynamics of the Internet. In spite of all these developments, there still exists ample room for improvement because, practically, there has been a slow deployment of AQM mechanisms. In the first part of this dissertation, we study the major AQM schemes in both the conventional and the fuzzy logic domain in order to uncover the problems that have hampered their deployment in practical implementations. Based on the findings from this study, we model the Internet congestion problem as a multi-objective problem. We propose a Fuzzy Logic Congestion Detection (FLCD) which synergistically combines the good characteristics of the fuzzy approaches with those of the conventional approaches. We design the membership functions (MFs) of the FLCD algorithm automatically by using Multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO), a population based stochastic optimization algorithm. This enables the FLCD algorithm to achieve optimal performance on all the major objectives of Internet congestion control. The FLCD algorithm is compared with the basic Fuzzy Logic AQM and the Random Explicit Marking (REM) algorithms on a best effort network. Simulation results show that the FLCD algorithm provides high link utilization whilst maintaining lower jitter and packet loss. It also exhibits higher fairness and stability compared to its basic variant and REM. We extend this concept to Proportional Differentiated Services network environment where the FLCD algorithm outperforms the traditional Weighted RED algorithm. We also propose self learning and organization structures which enable the FLCD algorithm to achieve a more stable queue, lower packet losses and UDP traffic delay in dynamic traffic environments on both wired and wireless networks. In the second part of this dissertation, we present the congestion notification mechanisms which have been proposed for wired and satellite networks. We propose an FLCD based dual explicit congestion notification algorithm which combines the merits of the Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) and the Backward Explicit Congestion Notification (BECN) mechanisms. In this proposal, the ECN mechanism is invoked based on the packet marking probability while the BECN mechanism is invoked based on the BECN parameter which helps to ensure that BECN is invoked only when congestion is severe. Motivated by the fact that TCP reacts to tbe congestion notification signal only once during a round trip time (RTT), we propose an RTT based BECN decay function. This reduces the invocation of the BECN mechanism and resultantly the generation of reverse traffic during an RTT. Compared to the traditional explicit notification mechanisms, simulation results show that the new approach exhibits lower packet loss rates and higher queue stability on wired networks. It also exhibits lower packet loss rates, higher good-put and link utilization on satellite networks. We also observe that the BECN decay function reduces reverse traffic significantly on both wired and satellite networks while ensuring that performance remains virtually the same as in the algorithm without BECN traffic reduction.
