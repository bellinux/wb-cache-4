Lindwall was a Queensland selector for five seasons and an Australian selector from 1979–80 to 1982–83. He was given life membership of the Marylebone Cricket Club in 1960, the NSWCA is 1979 and the Queensland Cricket Association in 1991. In 1965, he received an MBE for his services to cricket.

In the early 1970s, Lindwall mentored upcoming Western Australian paceman Dennis Lillee, who went on to hold the world record for Test wickets. After the Seventh Test in the 1970-71 Ashes series Lillee asked Keith Miller for Lindwall's address as [...] "He might just be able <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> <b>me</b> how to bowl".
