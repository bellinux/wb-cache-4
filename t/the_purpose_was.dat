5|$|The house {{became the}} seat of the Strachey family {{including}} John Strachey, the geologist, who inherited estates including Sutton Court from his father in 1674 at three years of age. He introduced a theory of rock formations known as Stratum, based on a pictorial cross-section of the geology under the estate and coal seams in nearby coal works of the Somerset Coalfield. He projected them according to their measured thicknesses and attitudes into unknown areas between the coal workings. <b>The</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>was</b> to enhance the value of his grant of a coal-lease on parts of his estate. This work was later developed by William Smith.|$|E

5|$|The {{life cycle}} {{assessment}} model seeks to identify the main types of environmental impact throughout {{the life cycle of}} a product. LCA was developed according to ISO 14040. The main goal of the LCA is to define the energy and environmental profile of the finished products. The reasons to use LCA arose from the need to have a precise process accounting and to highlight potential improvements {{that could be used in}} order to increase the environmental, energy and economic efficiency and overall effectiveness of the processes. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>was</b> to quantify the environmental advantages deriving from the use of recycled raw material.|$|E
5|$|After the Six-Day War in 1967, the PLO {{moved their}} bases to Jordan and stepped up their guerrilla attacks against Israel, taking the border town of Karameh as their headquarters. The IDF claimed that <b>the</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>was</b> {{to destroy the}} PLO militant camps at Karameh and capture Yasser Arafat as reprisal, however, it is also {{believed}} that it wanted to punish Jordan for its perceived support to Palestinian fighters (fedayeen, meaning self-sacrificers). Israel assumed the Jordanian Army would choose to not {{get involved in the}} battle, but the latter deployed heavy artillery fire. The Israelis withdrew, or were repulsed, after a day-long battle, having destroyed most of the Karameh camp and taken around 140 PLO members prisoner. The battle resulted in the issuance of the United Nations Security Council Resolution 248, which unanimously condemned Israel for violating the cease-fire line and its disproportionate use of force.|$|E
5|$|Clement's {{position}} as Bishop of Dunblane provided {{the opportunity to}} participate on the larger national and international stage. In 1241, the Cistercian general chapter began postulating the Pope about the saintliness of Edmund of Abingdon, formerly Archbishop of Canterbury. In the following year, various clerics wrote pieces and compiled evidence supporting this Edmund's claim to sainthood. Clement was one of these clerics. Edmund's saintliness was endorsed by Pope Innocent IV in 1246. Clement took part in a similar campaign in 1249. He was part of the movement to canonise Queen Margaret, one of the ancestors of the contemporary Scottish kings. Clement was appointed to investigate her saintliness, and in the following year Margaret too was canonised. Meanwhile, in 1247, Pope Innocent IV gave Clement the more onerous and demanding appointment of papal tax collector. Clement was charged with collecting one twentieth of all ecclesiastical revenues within the Kingdom of the Scots. <b>The</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>was</b> to finance a new crusade, and Clement's appointment was part of a money-raising initiative carried out throughout Western Christendom.|$|E

The North Vietnamese Transportation Group 559, then {{under the leadership of}} Major-General Phan Trong Tue, was ordered to open a new transportation and communication lines through southern Laos and South Vietnam. <b>The</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>was</b> to facilitate the movement of troops and material through the Pathet Lao-occupied section of the Ho Chi Minh trail. They were supported by 1,500 workers from the Ministry of Transportation and 7,600 volunteers. By the end of 1965, the strength of Group 559 had grown to 24,400 personnel organised in six battalions of motor vehicles, one battalion of boats, 18 battalions of combat engineers, four battalions of anti-aircraft artillery and guard units. In addition to the expansion of their logistical abilities, the North Vietnamese also decided to establish five infantry divisions and one artillery in South Vietnam. Thus, the stage was set for a major military struggle with American and other allied forces.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of Sunkist v. Sunkist and Quaker Oats Co. v. General Mills, the court created a long-standing {{precedent}} in their decision {{making it possible for}} different companies to use the same brand and product name as long as they produced dissimilar products. In another case, the court set a short-lived precedent allowing companies to artificially raise prices in local markets if <b>the</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>was</b> to artificially lower prices in another market to remain competitive. After Minton joined the U.S. Supreme Court, the decision was appealed to that body; Minton recused himself from the case, which the court decided to overturn. In another decision, Minton was in the majority that ruled under the Sherman Antitrust Act that the New York Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company was a monopoly, ordering the company to break up its grocery business. Minton was also in the majority in several cases filed to enforce decisions made by the National Labor Relations Board, usually to end worker strikes.|$|E
