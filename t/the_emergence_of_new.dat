5|$|From {{specimens}} {{collected in}} 1888, Ridgway {{was the first}} to describe hood mockingbird, large cactus finch, and medium tree finch, all endemic to the Galápagos. The latter two are members of the so-called Darwin's finch group of tanagers, significant for their impact on Charles Darwin's reasoning about evolution and <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> species.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> {{forces of}} urban factions, rural voters, and others, {{engaging}} in continued conflict {{with each other}} for their own interests, meant that the problem of effective governance awaited resolution. The populist government of the Gracchi had come to an end by violence; and this provided a brutal precedent that would be followed by many other rulers of Rome.|$|E
5|$|The {{new wave}} of British heavy metal (commonly {{abbreviated}} as NWOBHM) was a nationwide musical movement that started in the United Kingdom in the late 1970s and achieved international attention by the early 1980s. Journalist Geoff Barton coined the term in a May 1979 issue of the British music newspaper Sounds to describe <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> heavy metal bands in the late 1970s, {{during the period of}} punk rock's decline and the dominance of new wave music.|$|E

5|$|Also of {{historical}} importance were the Ndongo and Matamba kingdoms {{to the south}} of the Kongo Empire, in the Ambundu area. Additionally, the Lunda Empire, in the south-east of the present day DRC, occupied a portion of what today is north-eastern Angola. In the south of the territory, and the north of present-day Namibia, lay the Kwanyama kingdom, along with minor realms on the central highlands. All these political units were a reflection of ethnic cleavages that slowly developed among the Bantu populations, and were instrumental in consolidating these cleavages and fostering <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> and distinct social identities.|$|E
5|$|Amman is {{introducing}} {{itself as a}} business hub. The city's skyline is being continuously transformed through <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> projects. A significant portion of business flowed into Amman following the 2003 Iraq War. Jordan's main airport, Queen Alia International Airport, is located south of Amman and is the hub for the country's national carrier Royal Jordanian, a major airline in the region. The airline is headquartered in Zahran district. Rubicon Group Holding and Maktoob, two major regional information technology companies, are based in Amman, along with major international corporations such as Hikma Pharmaceuticals, one of the Middle East's largest pharmaceutical companies, and Aramex, the Middle East's largest logistics and transportation company.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{selection}} acts on the phenotype, or {{the observable}} characteristics of an organism, but the genetic (heritable) basis of any phenotype {{that gives a}} reproductive advantage may become more common in a population. Over time, this process can result in populations that specialise for particular ecological niches (microevolution) and may eventually result in speciation (<b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> species, macroevolution). In other words, natural selection is a key process {{in the evolution of}} a population. Natural selection can be contrasted with artificial selection, in which humans intentionally choose specific traits, whereas in natural selection there is no intentional choice.|$|E

5|$|The new {{treaties}} gave minorities {{the right}} to appeal directly to the League or UN General Assembly.

The victorious powers attempted to ensure the stable development of the region between defeated Germany and Soviet Russia, a region characterized by the existence of many ethnic groups and <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> nations. The idea behind the Minority Treaties was that by subjecting those countries to the scrutiny of others and to the threat of sanction and intervention from the newly created international body, the League of Nations, the rights of minorities would be safeguarded.|$|E
25|$|Cricket-wise, {{the series}} was a {{watershed}} for both teams—the West Indies {{would go on to}} establish a record unbeaten run in Test match series until 1994–95, while the victory heralded <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> Zealand's best Test team.|$|E

25|$|The expolitation {{of sites}} with mineral {{resources}} may have increased during Satavahana period, leading to <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> settlements in these areas.

25|$|Apologists like Dave Hunt in Peace, Prosperity and the Coming Holocaust and Hal Lindsey in The Terminal Generation {{have tended}} to {{interpret}} the phenomena of cults {{as part of the}} burgeoning evidence of signs that Christ's Second Advent is close at hand.

This interaction manifested itself in the integration of 'converted' local deities into the bureaucratically organised Taoist pantheon and <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> exorcistic rituals, including the Celestial Heart Rites and the Thunder Rites.|$|E
