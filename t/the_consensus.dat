40|$|In this paper, a group {{consensus}} problem is investigated for multiple networked agents with parametric uncertainties {{where all the}} agents are governed by the Euler-Lagrange system with uncertain parameters. In <b>the</b> group <b>consensus</b> problem, <b>the</b> agents asymptotically reach several different states rather than one consistent state. A novel {{group consensus}} protocol and a time-varying estimator of the uncertain parameters are proposed for each agent in order to solve <b>the</b> couple-group <b>consensus</b> problem. It is shown that <b>the</b> group <b>consensus</b> is reachable even when the system contains the uncertain parameters. Furthermore, <b>the</b> multi-group <b>consensus</b> is discussed {{as an extension of}} <b>the</b> couple-group <b>consensus,</b> and then <b>the</b> group <b>consensus</b> with switching topology is considered. Simulation results are finally provided to validate the effectiveness of the theoretical analysis...|$|R

5|$|Although the 1915 {{season was}} a success, the next year's team {{was one of}} the {{greatest}} of Warner's career. The Panthers were again undefeated and, like the previous year, six of the eight games were shutouts. Thirty-two of their 35 players were from Western Pennsylvania, near Pittsburgh. The team scored 255 points, conceding 25. Warner considered the team an improvement because its defense was more dominant than the previous year's. The Panthers were <b>the</b> <b>consensus</b> national champions, and Warner became recognized as one of football's greatest coaches.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of his National Letter of Intent signing with Michigan Wolverines basketball, ESPN.com and Scout.com ranked McGary as the number two player in the United States high school class of 2012, while Rivals.com ranked him as the number three prospect.

After his signing, however, McGary fell down in the rankings as his underdeveloped offensive skills became apparent.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, the {{relations}} of the scale-free network topology and <b>the</b> moving <b>consensus</b> of multi-agent systems are studied. A synchronization-preferential BA (SPBA) network with the combinatorial preferential attachment is presented for <b>the</b> prestissimo <b>consensus.</b> <b>The</b> effects of the SPBA network on the algebraic connectivity of the topology graph are compared with the standard BA network. The robustness gain to delay is analyzed for variable network topologies with the same size. The characteristics of dramatic increase for the algebraic connectivity and slightly increase for the robustness gain to delay are unfolded in SPBA network. By comparing the convergence time of the different network structures, <b>the</b> <b>consensuses</b> are studied for multiagent systems with and without communication delays...|$|R
