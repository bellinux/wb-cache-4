500|$|The project {{proceeded}} simply {{once the}} design was agreed. The memorial {{was built on}} the Cathedral Green, just {{to the west of the}} cathedral itself, in alignment with the altar—according to historian Hazel Harvey, [...] "it faces east, standing on a hypothetical line drawn from the high altar through the nave of the cathedral". It takes the form of a [...] granite cross, quarried from Haytor on Dartmoor, and hewn from a single stone—the largest Lutyens was able to acquire. The cross is formed of a diamond-shaped <b>tapered</b> <b>shaft</b> to which chamfered arms, no wider than the base, are moulded close to the top. It stands on a three-tiered base and a rectangular plinth, which itself sits on three stone steps as is customary for Lutyens' war memorials. The central tier of the base bears the inscription [...] "THE COUNTY OF DEVON TO HER GLORIOUS DEAD / 1914–1919 / TE DEUM LAUDAMUS / 1939–1945". Upon its completion, Lutyens said of the monument, [...] "it is very simple and a monolith and its subtlety in line means labour, care and thought. [...] It should endure forever".|$|E

50|$|The {{tower is}} {{structurally}} {{independent of the}} adjacent shopping centre, with a simple foundation onto sandstone. The foundation is 60 feet in diameter, 17 feet deep and begins 40 feet below Houghton Street. It has a <b>tapering</b> <b>shaft</b> that was built using slip-formed concrete. The crows nest structure at the top was then added after the shaft was formed.|$|R
2500|$|Within {{the churchyard}} {{to the south}} of the church is a 14th-century ashlar cross with <b>tapering</b> <b>shaft.</b> A gabled lantern was added in 1906 in 14th-century style, with Pevsner {{describing}} the cross as [...] "with a square base with scooped-out top corners and part of the shaft." [...] The cross, Grade II listed and a scheduled monument, might be a previous village market cross.|$|R
50|$|The tapered key is tapered only on {{the side}} that engages the hub. The keyway in the hub has a taper that matches that of the tapered key. Some taper keys have a gib, or tab, for easier removal during disassembly. The purpose of the taper is to secure the key itself, as well as, to firmly engage the shaft to the hub {{without the need for}} a set screw. The problem with taper keys is that they can cause the center of the shaft {{rotation}} to be slightly off of the mating part. It is different from a <b>tapered</b> <b>shaft</b> lock in that tapered keys have a matching taper on the keyway, while <b>tapered</b> <b>shaft</b> locks do not.|$|E
5000|$|Dutch {{inventor}} Dr. A. R. Naber created [...] "the magic flute", a siren whose {{pitch is}} varied {{not by the}} number of holes in a circle on the disk, but by the speed at which the disk rotates. During operation the cord connecting the spindle and the flexible drive belt is held between the fingers and moved up and down a <b>tapered</b> <b>shaft</b> of the spindle to vary the rotation and thus pitch.|$|E
5000|$|Also in the square, {{positioned}} slightly off-centre, is a stone {{cross that}} is known as Chelsea War Memorial. Made of Portland stone, and designed by an unknown architect, the cross has a capped head on a <b>tapered</b> <b>shaft</b> above a moulded three stage octagonal base. A large bronze sword is affixed to its west face. The cross is surmounted on a plinth which is inscribed with the following: [...] The monument has also been Grade II listed, since 2005.|$|E

The occurrence is within the Hieroglyphic Beds of the Silesian Nappe, within the Szczyrzyc Synclinorium, of Middle Eocene age. The trace fossil is a wide, J-shaped structure having a narrow, upward <b>tapering</b> <b>shaft</b> as {{a connection to the}} seafloor. The distal end also tapers, to a blind termination. The burrow lumen is surrounded by an irregular spreite structure. The trace fossil is compared with the work of burrowing holothurians, which show some comparative features that suggest a tracemaker belonging to the Apodida...|$|R
5000|$|There {{are five}} known types of Salish spindles. [...] The version used {{exclusively}} by the Cowichan people was {{very large and}} was used for spinning two ply mountain goat wool and dog hair for weaving. The spindle was a <b>tapered</b> <b>shaft</b> approximately four feet long. The whorl, which rested one-half to {{two-thirds of the way}} down the shaft, was about eight inches in diameter. Coast Salish spindle whorls were often highly decorated, and many fine examples can be found in museum collections.|$|E
50|$|The {{memorial}} {{consists of}} Lutyens' War Cross design—a lozenge-shaped <b>tapered</b> <b>shaft</b> in Portland stone approximately 7 m tall with short arms {{near the top}} of the shaft, linked to it with cyma moulding. The cross stands on a base of four uneven rectangular stone blocks which itself stands on an undercut square plinth, at the foot of which are three shallow stone steps. Its position at the end of the churchyard, on the junction of Brighton Road and Hambledon Road makes it a prominent landmark.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the churchyard}} are three stone {{fragments}} dating possibly from the 10th century {{which have been}} re-erected {{in the form of}} a Celtic cross. [...] The re-erection was carried out in 1958 by the Bromborough Society. It is listed at Grade II. [...] Also in the churchyard and listed at Grade II is a stone sundial dated 1730 which is possibly constructed from a 15th-century cross. It consists of two square steps on a base, a <b>tapered</b> <b>shaft</b> and a square cap. [...] There are four war graves of service personnel, one of World War I and four of World War II.|$|E
50|$|The cross {{was carved}} by John Roddis of Birmingham, using stone from a quarry in Doulting {{which was also}} used to build Glastonbury Abbey. The cross follows a Saxon or Celtic design based the Sandbach Crosses, early Christian {{examples}} from the 8th to 9th century from Sandbach in Cheshire. The <b>tapering</b> <b>shaft</b> about 12 ft high stands on a stepped base, topped by a circular Celtic cross. The base and cross add another 8 ft. The complete monument is about 7 m high. The sides of the shaft are decorated with a lozenge pattern and carvings of archbishops, angels and beasts.|$|R
50|$|The {{memorial}} {{is built}} in sandstone, {{it is about}} 5 m high, and consists of a Celtic cross with a broad <b>tapering</b> <b>shaft.</b> The shaft is on a rectangular pedestal on a base of three steps, the whole standing on a platform. The front of the wheel-head of the cross and the shaft are decorated with complex vine patterns in relief. On {{the front of the}} shaft is an inscription, and on the pedestal are the names of to 20 servicemen lost in the First World War, and the 17 lost in the Second World War.|$|R
50|$|The {{memorial}} {{was erected}} {{by the former}} Boston Borough Council in 1957, on the 350th anniversary of the event. The work {{was carried out by}} Leakes Masonry. The ceremony was attended by several members of the General Society of Mayflower Descendants, who made a donation towards the cost of the monument. Its design is a <b>tapering</b> <b>shaft</b> rising from a base-block, intended to symbolise the urge which drove a small band of men and women to leave their country and kinsfolk for consciences sake. The material used typifies by its strength the power and stability of their faith.|$|R
5000|$|The {{standard}} dildo has a non-tapered {{or slightly}} <b>tapered</b> <b>shaft,</b> and often has an enlarged head, {{similar to a}} penis. The shaft may be slightly curved, {{but if it is}} strongly curved, it is often classified as a g-spot/prostate dildo as well. This type {{is by far the most}} popular, both for vaginal and anal use, although some beginners prefer a probe-type dildo. Depending on the type of harness the dildo is meant for, it may have molded testicles as part of the base, which many people say gives more pleasure and helps keep the dildo from [...] "bottoming out." [...] Standard dildos are the most common by a large margin, and are available in virtually any length and width, material, texture, etc.|$|E
50|$|In September 1968 the M4 was {{replaced}} by an improved 602cc engine featuring higher compression pistons and forced induction from the engine fan giving slightly more power. As with the 2CV and Ami, cooling air was ducted straight to the heater, giving excellent demisting and heating. Mechanical contact-breakers were mounted {{at the front of}} the camshaft and located behind the cooling fan. The fan was mounted on a <b>tapered</b> <b>shaft</b> and secured with a bolt at the bottom of a deep tube (the top of which engaged the starter handle). As the location of the mounting points was not obvious to the uninformed, they were often neglected. The ignition coil fired both cylinders simultaneously (wasting one spark) and the spark plug wear was significantly greater than it should have been; 6000 miles was not uncommon for a spark plug.|$|E

AIM: The aim of {{this study}} was to evaluate the influence of a smooth flexible versus active <b>tapered</b> <b>shaft</b> design on canal preparation by NiTi rotary techniques. METHODOLOGY: A XMCT-scanner (SkyScan 1072) and developed software (Bergmans et al. 2001) were used to nondestructively analyze the mesial canals of 10 extracted mandibular molars in 3 D with a spatial resolution of 30 microm. Specimens (n = 10 per group) were scanned before (PRE) and after (POST) preparation using Lightspeed (smooth flexible) or GT-rotary (active tapered) files. Numerical values for volumes, dentine removal (net) transportation and centring ability were obtained in addition to a visual inspection on canal aberrations. Data were analyzed by Shapiro Wilk test, multiway factorial anova, Tukey-Kramer test, Wilcoxon test and t-test. RESULTS: Results indicated that the active <b>tapered</b> <b>shaft</b> removed significantly more dentine in the middle to apical portion of the root compared to the smooth flexible design. Both groups demonstrated some straightening, but no significant differences were found with respect to instrument types. However, absolute values for net transportation and centering ratio were small and no canal aberrations could be found. CONCLUSIONS: The smooth flexible shaft design did not improve the morphological characteristics of canal preparation by NiTi rotary instruments when compared with the active tapered design. Therefore, system selection should be based upon other criteria. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Present work {{deals with}} the study of {{stresses}} developed in tapered functionally graded (FG) shaft system under both thermal and mechanical environment for three nodded beam element by using Timoshenko beam theory. The temperature distribution in radial direction is assumed based on one dimensional steady state temperature field by Fourier heat conduction equation without considering heat generation. Temperature dependent material properties are varied along the radial direction using power law gradation. Tapered FG shaft consists of rigid disk attached at its centre and shaft is mounted on two flexible bearings acts as spring and damper, inner radius of the <b>tapered</b> <b>shaft</b> is varying in x direction keeping thickness of hollow <b>tapered</b> <b>shaft</b> is constant. For the present analysis the Mixture of Stainless steel (SUS 304) and Aluminum oxide (Al 2 O 3) are considered as inner and outer surface material of the FG shaft. Three dimensional constitutive relations are derived based on first order shear deformation theory (FSDT) for Timoshenko beam element considering rotary inertia, strain and kinetic energy of shaft and gyroscopic effect. In present study, structural and hysteretic damping are incorporated. Hamilton’s principle is used to derive governing equation of motion for three nodded beam element for six degree of freedom per node. Complete MATLB code is generated and shows that temperature field and power law gradient index have important part on material properties. Comparative study is carried out for Stainless steel and FG <b>tapered</b> <b>shaft,</b> shows that stress developed in FG shaft is comparatively lower than Steel shaft. Various results are obtained for coupled and uncoupled environment. Transient stress are obtained for varying power law index value and speed as a parameter. Stress amplitude increases for increase in speed and power law index. Results achieved for FG shaft shows advantages over steel shaft...|$|E

AIM: To {{evaluate the}} influence of a progressive versus constant <b>tapered</b> <b>shaft</b> design on canal preparation by NiTi rotary techniques. METHODOLOGY: A XMCT-scanner and custom-made software were used to nondestructively analyse the mesial canals of 10 extracted mandibular molars in 3 D with a spatial resolution of 12. 5 microm. Specimens (n = 10 per group) were scanned before and after preparation using ProTaper (progressive tapered) or K 3 (constant tapered) files. Numerical values for volume, curvature, dentine removal and centring ratio were obtained in addition to a visual inspection for canal aberrations. Data were analysed by (multiway factorial) anova, Wilcoxon tests and t-tests. RESULTS: The volume of total dentine removal (mean +/- SD) was 1. 21 +/- 0. 66 mm(3) (ProTaper) and 1. 06 +/- 0. 23 mm(3) (K 3) (P > 0. 05), and the amount of dentine removal at all separate horizontal regions examined was comparable for both groups. The mean linear dentine removal (transportation) was in the range of 8 - 212 microm (ProTaper) and 4 - 187 microm (K 3). The resultant centring ratio varied from 0. 01 to 0. 24 (ProTaper) and from 0. 01 to 0. 17 (K 3), whilst different straightening patterns were observed. A centre displacement towards the furcation coronally was most pronounced for the ProTaper group whereas a centre displacement towards the outer side of the curvature more apically was only observed for the K 3 group. No severe canal aberrations were found. CONCLUSIONS: The progressive <b>tapered</b> <b>shaft</b> design of the ProTaper instrument was less influenced by the mid-root curvature than the constant tapered design of the K 3 instrument thereby providing a good centred apical preparation. However, ProTaper instruments tended to transport towards the furcation in the coronal region. status: publishe...|$|E
