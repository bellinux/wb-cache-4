5|$|Despite the {{discontinuation}} of ferry service <b>to</b> <b>New</b> <b>Jersey,</b> {{people moved}} to locations along the Hudson River waterfront there. In 1986, waterfront settlements like Bayonne, Highlands, Keyport, Port Liberte, and Weehawken saw a reinstatement of their ferry service to Manhattan, under {{the operation of}} NY Waterway. By 1989, around 3,000 of the settlements' combined 10,500 residents paid a $5.00 fare in each direction to board the NY Waterway ferries, despite competition from cheaper alternatives like the PATH train system. Around this time, there were plans to create ferry routes between Inwood and Atlantic City; South Amboy and Wall Street; and from the city proper <b>to</b> <b>New</b> <b>Jersey,</b> Connecticut, and Westchester.|$|E

5|$|A lack of {{stability}} continually plagued the team. The franchise never {{won more than}} 22 games and {{did not return to}} the playoffs after 1977–78 in its six seasons in Colorado. Prior to the 1978–79 season, the team was sold <b>to</b> <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> trucking tycoon Arthur Imperatore, who intended to move the team to his home state. The plan was criticized due to the existence of three other NHL teams in the region, and the proposed New Jersey arena was still under construction; the franchise ultimately stayed in Denver. In 1979, the team hired Don Cherry as head coach and featured forward Lanny McDonald. The Rockies still posted the worst record in the NHL, and Cherry was subsequently fired after the season. After two more years in Denver, the Rockies were sold to a group headed by John McMullen (who also owned Major League Baseball's Houston Astros) on May 27, 1982, and the franchise moved <b>to</b> <b>New</b> <b>Jersey.</b> As part of the relocation deal, the Devils had to compensate the three existing teams in the region – the New York Islanders, New York Rangers and Flyers – for encroaching on their territory.|$|E

Some of these parasites are endoparasites, internal parasites, while others are ectoparasites, external parasites.|$|E

5|$|Incubation lasts 72–80days in {{the wild}} and for a similar period in {{artificial}} conditions.

5|$|Because DUI in New Jersey is a non-criminal traffic violation, state DUI {{laws are}} not subject to the Assimilative Crimes Act. Members of the Armed Forces can be court martialed for drunk driving, {{military}} bases can enforce New Jersey traffic law on civilians, and it is a misdemeanor under federal law to drive while intoxicated on land administered by the National Park Service, the Department of Veterans Affairs, or the Postal Service. Similar <b>to</b> <b>New</b> <b>Jersey,</b> federal DUI statutes prohibit the operation of a motor vehicle while having a BAC of 0.08% or greater, and require a driver to give a breath sample if requested by a law enforcement authority.|$|E
5|$|In 1736, a ferry {{began to}} operate, {{traveling}} from Shawnee between Shawnee Island and Depuy Island, then across the Delaware River <b>to</b> <b>New</b> <b>Jersey.</b> By 1740 Aaron Depuy was operating a store, and in 1753 {{he built a}} stone and log church used by ministers of the Dutch Reformed Church. The cornerstone of this church remains, {{now part of the}} Shawnee Presbyterian Church. The farming community grew steadily, using the river to transport produce. A post office was built in 1843, and a brick church was erected in 1853 on the foundation of the old stone and log church. Some of the original beams still remain, as well as the original sounding board.|$|E

5|$|In 1978, Parsons, Brinckerhoff, Quade and Douglas studied four {{options for}} a tunnel from Brooklyn <b>to</b> <b>New</b> <b>Jersey,</b> some {{involving}} a tunnel to Staten Island. These included {{an option for}} a tunnel directly from Greenville Yard to the Bay Ridge Branch, and a link from New Jersey to Manhattan. Also under consideration was a single-tube tunnel with accommodations for electric units only. The Greenville–Brooklyn tunnel would be about $331 million, which was cheaper than the approximately $405 million tunnel from Staten Island to Brooklyn.|$|E
5|$|In January 1983, Consolidated Rail Corporation {{handed over}} {{operation}} of the commuter railroads <b>to</b> <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> Transit Rail Operations. On September 20, 2002, {{as part of the}} Montclair Connection, merging the Montclair Branch and Boonton Line, the Arlington station in Kearny was closed, resulting in the lack of a station in Kearny. As a result, a rail shuttle bus was created by the town of Kearny to bus passengers from Arlington station up to Kingsland via Route 76 bus route, giving rail passenger service to New York Penn Station and Hoboken Terminal. Shuttle buses were aligned at that time with the 5:02 AM, 6:03 PM and 7:08 PM. Services were adjusted for the timetable services on September 30, 2002.|$|E

A second trip <b>to</b> <b>New</b> <b>Jersey,</b> this time to play the Jets, produced another Colts win.

5|$|The Big Inch and Little Big Inch, collectively {{known as}} the Inch pipelines, are {{petroleum}} pipelines extending from Texas <b>to</b> <b>New</b> <b>Jersey,</b> built between 1942 and 1944 as emergency war measures in the U.S. Before World War II, petroleum products were transported from the oil fields of Texas to the north-eastern states by sea by oil tankers. After the United States entered the war on 1 January 1942, this vital link was attacked by German submarines in the Operation Paukenschlag, threatening both the oil supplies to the north-east and its onward transshipment to Great Britain. The Secretary of the Interior, Harold Ickes, championed the pipeline project {{as a way of}} transporting petroleum by the more-secure, interior route.|$|E
