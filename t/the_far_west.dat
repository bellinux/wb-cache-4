5|$|Highway16 is {{a provincial}} paved highway in the Canadian {{province}} of Saskatchewan.

The highway runs from the Alberta boundary in Lloydminster (50thAvenue or Highway17) to the Manitoba boundary near Marchwell. Major cities it passes through are Saskatoon, North Battleford in {{the central part of}} the province, Yorkton in the far east and Lloydminster to <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>west.</b>|$|E

He intended to sail to the Roman Empire, but was discouraged when told that the trip was dangerous and could take two years. Deterred, he returned to China bringing much new information on the countries to the west of Chinese-controlled territories, as far as the Mediterranean Basin.|$|E
5|$|In north-west Nelson, {{there are}} three {{ecotypes}} defined by soil and exposure. Trees growing on limestone bluffs have stiff, blue-green leaves. On the river flats, the trees are tall with narrow, lax, dark green leaves, and an uneven canopy. They resemble the cabbage trees of the North Island's East Cape. Along the coast to <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>west,</b> the trees are robust with broad, bluish leaves. The latter two forms extend down the West Coast, with the lax-leaved forms growing in moist, fertile, sheltered river valleys while the bluish-leaved forms prefer rocky slopes exposed to {{the full force of}} the salt-laden coastal winds.|$|E
5|$|Oklahoma is the 20th-largest {{state in}} the United States, {{covering}} an area of 69,898 square miles (181,035km2), with 68,667 square miles (177,847km2) of land and 1,281 square miles (3,188km2) of water. It is one of six states on the Frontier Strip and lies partly in the Great Plains near the geographical center of the 48 contiguous states. It is bounded on the east by Arkansas and Missouri, on the north by Kansas, on the northwest by Colorado, on <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>west</b> by New Mexico, and on the south and near-west by Texas.

Notable operations of Iranian F-4s during the war included Operation Scorch Sword, an attack by two F-4s against the Iraqi Osirak nuclear reactor site near Baghdad on 30 September 1980, and the attack on H3, a 4 April 1981 strike by eight Iranian F-4s against the H-3 complex of air bases in <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>west</b> of Iraq, which resulted in many Iraqi aircraft being destroyed or damaged for no Iranian losses.|$|E
5|$|The {{capital of}} the {{territory}} remained in Vincennes for thirteen years. After the territory was reorganized in 1809 and the Illinois Territory was split off, Vincennes was then on <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>west</b> edge of the Indiana Territory. Due to this, the legislature made plans to move the capital to be more centralized with the population. Madison, Jeffersonville, and Corydon competed to become the new capital. Harrison favored Corydon, a town he had founded and named, and where he owned an estate. The new capitol building was finished in 1813 and the government quickly relocated to Corydon after {{the outbreak of the}} War of 1812 for fear of an attack on Vincennes.|$|E
5|$|The inner German border {{originated}} from plans by the Second World War Allies to divide a defeated Germany into occupation zones. The boundaries between these zones were drawn along the territorial boundaries of 19th-century German states and provinces that had largely disappeared with {{the unification of}} Germany in 1871. Three zones were agreed on, each covering roughly a third of Germany's territories: a British zone in the north-west, an American zone {{in the south and}} a Soviet zone in the East. France was later given a zone in <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>west</b> of Germany, carved out of the British and American zones.|$|E

Further south, along the County Wexford coastline, {{is an area of}} granite intrusives into more Ordovician and Silurian rocks, like that found in Wales.|$|E
5|$|Two {{candidates}} {{stood with}} rather less support. William Ralls Morrison of Illinois {{had served in}} Congress since 1873 and was best known for advocating tariff reductions despite hailing from a protectionist district. He commanded little support outside his home state, and was seen as only a favorite son. Justice Stephen Johnson Field of the United States Supreme Court was better known, but still an unlikely victor. The only candidate from <b>the</b> <b>Far</b> <b>West,</b> Field was respected as a scholar of the law, but had greatly diminished his chances with {{his home state of}} California by striking down anti-Chinese legislation in that state in 1879. Even so, some observers, including Edwards Pierrepont, considered Field a likely choice for the nomination.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately, in 278 BC, Pyrrhus {{decided to}} direct his army against the Carthaginians in Sicily. Pyrrhus was highly {{successful}} {{in his campaign}} against Carthage and by 275 BC had managed to restrict them to the settlement of Lilybaeum in <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>west</b> of the island. Despite these victories, Pyrrhus' despotic disposition and pretensions alienated his Sicilian allies who began to abandon him. In light of these developments, Pyrrhus {{decided to return to}} mainland Italy to continue his war against Rome. The Epiriotes attacked the Roman army but after the inconclusive Battle of Beneventum, he returned to Epirus. Despite Pyrrhus leaving a garrison there, Tarentum succumbed to Rome in 272 BC.|$|E
