5|$|<b>Trust</b> {{funds are}} {{earmarked}} for specific programs and purposes {{in accordance with}} a statute that designates the fund as a <b>trust.</b> Its statutory designation distinguishes the fund as a <b>trust</b> rather than a special fund.

5|$|As {{a general}} rule, {{there is no}} {{requirement}} for particular formalities in <b>trust</b> instruments, they can be oral or written.

5|$|As news spread, {{other banks}} and <b>trust</b> {{companies}} {{were reluctant to}} lend any money. The {{interest rates on loans}} to brokers at the stock exchange soared to 70% and, with brokers unable to get money, stock prices fell to a low not seen since December 1900. The panic quickly spread to two other large trusts, <b>Trust</b> Company of America and Lincoln <b>Trust</b> Company. By Thursday, October 24, a chain of failures littered the street: Twelfth Ward Bank, Empire City Savings Bank, Hamilton Bank of New York, First National Bank of Brooklyn, International <b>Trust</b> Company of New York, Williamsburg <b>Trust</b> Company of Brooklyn, Borough Bank of Brooklyn, Jenkins <b>Trust</b> Company of Brooklyn and the Union <b>Trust</b> Company of Providence.|$|E

5|$|At 3 a.m. about 120 {{bank and}} <b>trust</b> company {{officials}} assembled {{to hear a}} full report {{on the status of}} the failing <b>trust</b> companies. While the <b>Trust</b> Company of America was barely solvent, the Lincoln <b>Trust</b> Company was probably $1 million short of what it needed to cover depositor accounts. As discussion ensued, the bankers realized that Morgan had locked them in the library and pocketed the key to force a solution, the sort of strong-arm tactic he had been known to use in the past. Morgan then entered the talks and advised the <b>trust</b> companies they must provide a loan of $25 million to save the weaker institutions. The <b>trust</b> presidents were still reluctant to act, but Morgan informed them that if they did not it would lead to a complete collapse of the banking system. Through his considerable influence, at about 4:45a.m. he persuaded the unofficial leader of the <b>trust</b> companies to sign the agreement, and the remainder of the bankers followed. Having received these commitments, Morgan allowed the bankers to go home.|$|E

The Quantock Hills AONB Service have their {{headquarters}} at Fyne Court.|$|E
5|$|By then, Morgan {{was drawn}} into another situation. There was deep {{concern that the}} <b>Trust</b> Company of America and the Lincoln <b>Trust</b> might fail to open on Monday due to {{continuing}} runs by depositors. On Saturday evening 40–50 bankers had gathered at the library to discuss the crisis, with the clearing-house bank presidents in the East room and the <b>trust</b> company executives in the West room. Morgan and those dealing with the Moore & Schley situation {{had moved to the}} librarian’s office. There Morgan told his counselors that he would agree to help shore up Moore & Schley only if the <b>trust</b> companies would work together to bail out their weakest brethren. The discussion among the bankers continued late into Saturday night but without much progress. Around midnight, J.P. Morgan informed a leader of the <b>trust</b> company presidents that keeping Moore & Schley afloat would require $25 million, and he would not commit those funds unless the problems with the <b>trust</b> companies could also be resolved. The <b>trust</b> company executives understood they would not receive further help from Morgan; they would have to finance any bailout of the two struggling <b>trust</b> companies.|$|E
30|$|The <b>Trusted</b> Core Framework {{provides}} the OS like functionality to <b>trusted</b> applications, while the <b>trusted</b> functions provide support facilities for application developers. Both the <b>trusted</b> functions and the <b>Trusted</b> Core Framework {{make use of}} the scheduling function and other OS management functions provided by the <b>Trusted</b> Kernel [19]. The TEE communication agent is a special case of a <b>Trusted</b> Core Framework function API. It works with its peer, the REE communication agent, to safely transfer messages between the CA and the TA. The <b>trusted</b> applications interface {{to the rest of the}} system via the APIs exposed by <b>trusted</b> OS components. The TEE internal API defines the fundamental software capabilities of a TEE [18]. Other APIs may be defined to support interface to further proprietary <b>trusted</b> functions.|$|R
30|$|Each <b>trusted</b> {{application}} exposes a TA interface. <b>Trusted</b> core framework implementation {{calls the}} TA interface to relay {{communication between the}} client application and the <b>trusted</b> application. Once the <b>trusted</b> core framework has {{called one of the}} TA entry points, the TA can make use of the TEE internal API to access the facilities of the <b>trusted</b> OS. The TEE internal API consists of the <b>trusted</b> core framework API, <b>trusted</b> storage API for data and keys, cryptographic operations API, time API, and TEE arithmetical API [19]. The TA interface is a subgroup of the <b>trusted</b> core framework API. The TEE internal API can be said to consist of the TA interface and other APIs to access the facilities of the <b>trusted</b> OS. If the client application in the normal zone requests secure services through the REE communication agent, the <b>trusted</b> core framework implementation calls the TA interface, and the TA may use the TEE internal API to access the facilities of the <b>trusted</b> OS, including the <b>trusted</b> functions.|$|R

5|$|Charitable trusts in English law are {{a form of}} express <b>trust</b> {{dedicated}} to charitable goals. There {{are a variety of}} advantages to charitable <b>trust</b> status, including exception from most forms of tax and freedom for the trustees not found in other types of English <b>trust.</b> To be a valid charitable <b>trust,</b> the organisation must demonstrate both a charitable purpose and a public benefit. Applicable charitable purposes are normally divided into categories for public benefit including the relief of poverty, the promotion of education, the advancement of health and saving of lives, promotion of religion and all other types of <b>trust</b> recognised by the law. There is also a requirement that the trust's purposes benefit the public (or some section of the public), and not simply a group of private individuals.|$|E

The <b>trust</b> agreed to appoint an outside monitor to review future expenditures. The Getty <b>Trust</b> experienced financial difficulties in 2008 and 2009 and cut 205 of 1,487 budgeted staff positions to reduce expenses. Although the Getty <b>Trust</b> endowment reached $6.4 billion in 2007, it dropped to $4.5 billion in 2009. The endowment rebounded to $6.2 billion by 2013.|$|E
5|$|In English law, secret trusts are a {{class of}} <b>trust</b> defined as an {{arrangement}} between a testator and a trustee, made to come into force after death, that aims to benefit a person without having been written in a formal will. The property {{is given to the}} trustee in the will, and he would then be expected to pass it on to the real beneficiary. For these to be valid, the person seeking to enforce the <b>trust</b> must prove that the testator intended to form a <b>trust,</b> that this intention was communicated to the trustee, and that the trustee accepted his office. There are two types of secret <b>trust</b> — fully secret and half-secret. A fully secret <b>trust</b> is one with no mention in the will whatsoever. In the case of a half-secret <b>trust,</b> the face of the will names the trustee as trustee, but does not give the trust's terms, including the beneficiary. The most important difference lies in communication of the trust: the terms of a half-secret <b>trust</b> must be communicated to the trustee before the execution of the will, whereas {{in the case of a}} fully secret <b>trust</b> the terms may be communicated after the execution of the will, as long as this is before the testator's death.|$|E
5|$|In {{practical}} terms, {{there are}} several reasons why admitting the language of fraud to justify a fully secret <b>trust,</b> but not a half-secret <b>trust,</b> would be sub-optimal. This is considered one principal reason why the court in Blackwell v Blackwell established that both types of secret <b>trust</b> shared a single justification. A half-secret <b>trust</b> appears closer to fulfilling the formality requirements as laid down in the Wills Act, so the conclusion that it is less likely to be enforced seems contradictory. Also, such a rule would encourage fully secret trusts, with a wider possibility for fraud. It would also spark considerable litigation on whether a particular clause resulted in a fully secret or half-secret <b>trust.</b> Thus it may be argued that despite the difficulties, a half-secret <b>trust</b> should be enforced if fully secret trusts are.|$|E
