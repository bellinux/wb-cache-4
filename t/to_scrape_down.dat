"You will please to {{overlook}} the fellow's manners sir," [...] said Fid, very coolly interposing his own hand, and just as deliberately pocketing the offering [...] "but I needn't tell as old a seaman as your Honour, that Guinea is no country <b>to</b> <b>scrape</b> <b>down</b> the seams of a man's behaviour in. Howsomever, I can say this much for him, which is, that he thanks your Honour just as heartily {{as if you had}} given him twice the sum. Make a bow to his Honour, boy, and do some credit to the company you have kept. And now, since this little difficulty about the money is gotten over, by my presence of mind, with your Honour's leave, I'll just step aloft, and cast loose the lashings of that bit of a tailor on the larboard fore-yard-arm. The chap was never made for a topman as you may see, sir, by the fashion in which he crosses his lower stanchions. That fellow will make a carrick bend with his legs as easily as I could do the same with a yarn of white line!" ...|$|E
60|$|So great was her solicitude for the {{improvement}} of her son, that she declined the pressing instances of the Countess of Macclesfield to reside under her roof, lest she should be hindered from attending exclusively to that which was now become her main concern. To the many inquiries which the early vivacity of the boy prompted him to put to her, the invariable answer she returned was, read and you will know. This assurance, added to the other means of instruction, from which her fondness, or more probably her discernment, induced her to exclude every species of severity, were so efficacious that in his fourth year he was able to read at sight any book in his own language. Two accidents occurred to hinder this rapid advancement from proceeding. Once he narrowly escaped being consumed by flames from having fallen into the fire, while endeavouring <b>to</b> <b>scrape</b> <b>down</b> some soot from the chimney of a room in which he had been left alone; and was rescued only in consequence of the alarm given to the servants by his shrieks. At another time, his eye was nearly put out by one of the hooks of his dress, as he was struggling under the hands of the domestic who was putting on his clothes. From the effects of this injury his sight never completely recovered.|$|E
5000|$|... (C7) An ulu (Inuit woman's knife) knife is a {{sharpened}} {{segment of}} a circle. This blade type has no point, {{and has a}} handle in the middle. It is good for scraping, and sometimes chopping. The semi-circular version appears {{elsewhere in the world}} and is called a head knife. It is used in leatherworking both <b>to</b> <b>scrape</b> <b>down</b> leather (reducing thickness, i.e. skiving), and to make precise, rolling cuts for shapes other than straight lines. The circular version is a popular tool for slicing pizzas. One corner is placed {{at the edge of the}} pizza and the blade is rolled across in a diameter cut.|$|E
50|$|A cake of ash {{eventually}} develops {{inside the}} bowl. This {{is generally considered}} desirable for controlling overall heat. However, if it becomes too thick, it may expand faster than the bowl of the pipe itself when heated, cracking the bowl. Before reaching this point, it needs <b>to</b> be <b>scraped</b> <b>down</b> with a reamer. It is generally recommended to keep the cake at approximately the thickness of a U.S. dime (about 1/20th of an inch or 1.5 mm), though sometimes the cake is removed entirely as part of efforts to eliminate flavors or aromas.|$|R

Some were in the prime of manhood, and had spent many years in the Indian country; some were beginning <b>to</b> <b>scrape</b> the <b>down</b> from their still soft chins; while others were boys of fourteen, who had just left home, and were listening for the first time, open-mouthed, to their seniors' description of life in the wilderness.|$|R

5000|$|The frizzen, {{historically}} {{called the}} steel, is an [...] "L" [...] shaped piece of steel hinged {{at the rear}} used in flintlock firearms. It is positioned over the flash pan so as to enclose a small priming charge of black powder next to the flash hole that is drilled through the barrel into where the main charge is loaded. When the trigger is pulled, the hammer or cock—which includes a shaped piece of flint held into a set of jaws by a scrap of leather or thin piece of lead—snaps forward causing the flint <b>to</b> <b>scrape</b> <b>down</b> {{the face of the}} frizzen (historically called the 'battery'), throwing it back to expose the black powder in the pan. The flint scraping the steel causes a shower of sparks to be thrown into the pan, igniting the black powder and sending flames through the touch hole, which in turn ignites the main charge of black powder in the breech of the barrel, shooting the projectile out the barrel.|$|E

50|$|Building up {{layers of}} color {{with the oil}} pastel, called layering, is a very common technique. Other {{techniques}} include underpainting and <b>scraping</b> <b>down</b> or sgraffito. Turpentine, or similar liquids such as mineral spirits, are often used as a blending tool to create a wash effect similar to some watercolor paintings. Commercially available oil sketching papers are preferred for such technique.|$|R
