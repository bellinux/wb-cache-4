40|$|Clinical {{decision}} support systems that notify providers of abnormal test results have produced mixed results. We sought to develop, implement, {{and evaluate the}} impact of a computer-based clinical alert system intended to improve atrial fibrillation stroke prophylaxis, and identify reasons providers do not implement a guideline-concordant response. We conducted a cohort study with historical controls among patients at a tertiary care hospital. We developed a decision rule to identify newly-diagnosed atrial fibrillation, automatically notify providers, and direct them to online evidence-based management guidelines. We tracked all notifications from December 2009 to February 2010 (notification period) and applied the same decision rule to all patients from December 2008 to February 2009 (control period). Primary outcomes were accuracy of notification (confirmed through chart review) and prescription of warfarin within 30 days. During <b>the</b> <b>notification</b> <b>period</b> 604 notifications were triggered, of which 268 (44 %) were confirmed as newly-diagnosed atrial fibrillation. The notifications not confirmed as newly-diagnosed involved patients with no recent electrocardiogram at our institution. Thirty-four of 125 high-risk patients (27 %) received warfarin in <b>the</b> <b>notification</b> <b>period,</b> compared with 34 of 94 (36 %) in the control period (odds ratio, 0. 66 [95 % CI, 0. 37 - 1. 17]; p = 0. 16). Common reasons to not prescribe warfarin (identified from chart review of 151 patients) included upcoming surgical procedure, choice to use aspirin, and discrepancy between clinical notes and the medication record.

40|$|Objective: This study {{illuminates}} {{the degree of}} psychological stress response experienced by spouses of cancer patients when given bad news at three different times (notification {{of the name of}} the disease, notification of recurrence, and notification of terminality) as well as the factors that influence the response and the health status of the spouse as measured by health-related quality of life (QOL). Methods: A total of 203 individuals (57 men and 146 women) who had received the three types of news were surveyed using a self-report questionnaire on psychological stress response, marital satisfaction, and health-related QOL scales. Results: The degree of the psychological stress response was the highest for notification of terminality, followed by notification of the name of the disease, and notification of recurrence. The influencing factors varied depending on <b>the</b> <b>notification</b> <b>period.</b> Although no significant difference was observed for health-related QOL among the three notification types, significant differences were observed for certain items when compared with national standard values. Conclusions: When a notification of terminality, which produced the highest psychological stress response, is given, providing care that considers health-related QOL is necessary not only for patients but also for their spouses...|$|E
40|$|The Observing Resources {{extension}} of the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is expected {{to play a major}} role in future Internet of Things (IoT) applications, since it enables asynchronous monitoring of IoT resources in an efficient manner. As the number of IoT applications will grow, solutions are needed to manage multiple observe relationships for the same resource, especially if hosted by a constrained IoT device. The problem is further exacerbated since multiple observers may have heterogeneous Quality of Service (QoS) requirements on the minimum and maximum frequency with which to receive notifications, while the resource-constrained server may only be able to provide notifications with one fixed period for all. In this work, we propose an efficient solution to support multiple CoAP observers with QoS requirements. In particular, we formulate the problem of finding <b>the</b> <b>notification</b> <b>period</b> which minimizes the amount of messages sent by the server, so as to reduce energy consumption of IoT devices and congestion in constrained networks, while ensuring all observers' requirements are met. We then propose an algorithm, named Observation Period Selection (OPS), which is proved to find the optimal solution to this problem. OPS is also evaluated experimentally to analyze its effectiveness in some simple scenarios...|$|E

40|$|Estimates {{based upon}} {{notifications}} {{indicate that there}} was in the 1977 - 9 triennium in the United Kingdom the largest outbreak of whooping cough for 20 years or more. During this triennium {{there was also a}} sharp increase in other infections diseases of childhood, notably in non-notifiable respiratory infections. Isolates of certain respiratory viruses ran in parallel and collectively outnumbered those of Bordetella pertussis during the period of increase in notifications. There was highly significant positive correlation between isolates of B pertussis and of ECHO viruses, of Mycoplasma pneumoniae and rhinoviruses and, in Scotland only, of Coxsackie virus. Deaths in which whooping cough was certified as the immediate of underlying cause were lower than in previous outbreaks. Only a minority were bacteriologically confirmed. A closer study of the outbreak in Glasgow disclosed considerable variations in notification procedure and lack of correlation with isolates of B pertussis at the peak of <b>the</b> <b>notification</b> <b>period.</b> Attack rates calculated from notification were higher in deprived areas. Birth cohort studies showed a significantly higher proportion of notifications in unvaccinated children aged 1 - 4 and this was confirmed in family studies of clinical whooping cough in home contacts. But, overall, about 35 % of reported cases were children who had received three injections of triple vaccine. Acceptance of pertussis vaccine fell sharply in 1975 but about 95 % of unvaccinated children in age groups 0 - 5, including the 1977 and the 1977 and 1978 birth cohorts, either escaped infection or were not notified...|$|E
40|$|This {{proposed}} amendment will incorporate {{by reference}} the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) revisions to plantwide applicability limitations (PALs) for Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions finalized with Step 3 of the GHG Tailoring Rule. These revisions give facilities subject to GHG permitting {{the option of}} establishing PALs on a carbon dioxide equivalent basis and documents that EPA is retaining the current GHG permitting thresholds, ensuring that GHG permitting requirements continue to apply to large sources only. The rulemaking will also remove the EPA’s grandfather provision that allowed certain sources to use coarse particulate matter as a surrogate for fine particulate matter during the transition to PM 2. 5 permitting. This administrative change which will update the incorporation by reference date for the GHG PAL option will not affect any Missouri sources.

40|$|This {{notice of}} {{construction}} (NOC) requests a categorical approval for construction {{and operation of}} three types of portable/temporary radionuclide airborne emission units (PTRAEUs). These three types are portable ventilation-filter systems (Type I), mobile sample preparation facilities (Type II), and mobile sample screening and analysis facilities (Type 111). Approval of the NOC application is intended to allow construction and operation of {{the three types of}} PTRAEUs without prior project-specific approval. Environmental cleanup efforts on the Hanford Site often require the use of PTRAEUs. The PTRAEUs support site characterization activities, expedited response actions (ERAs), sampling and monitoring activities, and other routine activities. The PTRAEUs operate at various locations around the Hanford Site. Radiation Air Emissions Program, Washington Administrative Code (WAC) 246 - 247, requires that the Washington State Department of Health (WDOH) be notified before construction of any new emission that would release airborne radioactivity. The WDOH also must receive notification before any modification of an existing source. This includes changes in the source term or replacement of emission control equipment that might significantly contribute to the offsite maximum dose from a licensed facility. During site characterization activities, ERAs, sampling and monitoring activities, and other routine activities, the PTRAEUs might require startup immediately. <b>The</b> <b>notification</b> <b>period</b> hampers efforts to complete such activities in an effective and timely manner. Additionally, notification is to be submitted to the WDOH when the PTRAEUs are turned off. The U. S. Department of Energy, Richland Operations Office (DOE-RL) potentially could generate several notifications monthly. The WDOH would be required to review and provide approval on each NOC as well as review the notices of discontinued sources. The WDOH regulation also allows facilities the opportunity to request a single categorical license that identifies limits and conditions of operations for similar multipurpose temporary and or portable emission units. The DOE-RL will submit annually to the WDOH a report summarizing the log books maintained on the individual PTRAEUs that are used during the reporting period. The report will supply information needed to ensure compliance with the condition of operations. The NOC includes a general description of the three types of PTRAEUs, tracking mechanisms, emissions control systems, and radioactivity handling limits (RHLs) for the PTR 4 EUs. The NOC is based on hypothetical data to demonstrate how emission estimates could be calculated. Tracking will be performed and monitoring will be conducted for compliance with both federal and state regulations. Type I units will use a single isotope based on a calculated RHL (source term) to determine emissions, dose, and monitoring requirements. Type I 1 and 111 units will use field data and process knowledge to determine emissions, dose, and monitoring requirements. New PTRAEUs that conform to any of the three types of PTRAEUs described in this application will be added to the next annual report after the units are placed in service. New PTRAEUs, which do not conform to any of the three types of PTRAEUs described in this application, will require approval on an individual basis by the WDOH before startup...|$|E

40|$|Title: Notification {{of animal}} welfare Author: Helen Öhlund The {{purpose of this}} study was to examine the {{routines}} of the county administrations in Sweden when it comes to receiving <b>notification</b> from <b>the</b> public about the welfare of animals. According to Jordbruksverket at least 50 % of the screening of animal welfare should be based on routine controls on existing farmers. Today the routine controls only reach a 43 % average for the whole country. A big part of today’s result depends on the amount of time it takes the administrators of animal welfare to process <b>the</b> <b>notifications</b> from <b>the</b> public. To examine why <b>the</b> <b>notifications</b> from <b>the</b> public take too long time, the county administrations were interviewed through phone and e-mail. The interviews were made to see what routines the county administrations had and if the routines could be made more efficient. Jordbruksverket have developed aid to the county administrations in form of simpler checklists for pets and control cards to ease <b>the</b> burden in <b>notification</b> controls.
