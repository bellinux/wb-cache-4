40|$|For the fetus, {{although}} {{the roles of}} arterial blood gases are recognized to be critical in the regulation of cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral oxygenation, the relation of CBF, cortical tissue PO 2 (<b>t</b> <b>PO</b> 2), sagittal sinus PO 2, and related indices of cerebral oxygenation to arterial blood gases are not well defined. This is particularly true for that fetus subjected to long-term hypoxia (LTH). In an effort to elucidate these interrelations, we tested the hypothesis that in the fetus acclimatized to high altitude, cerebral oxygenation is not compromised relative to that at low altitude. By use of a laser Doppler flowmeter with a fluorescent O 2 probe, in near-term fetal sheep at low altitude (n = 8) and those acclimatized to high altitude hypoxia (3801 m for 90 ± 5 days; n = 6), we measured laser Doppler CBF (LD-CBF), <b>t</b> <b>PO</b> 2, and related variables in response to 40 min superimposed hypoxia. At both altitudes, fetal LD-CBF, cerebral O 2 delivery, <b>t</b> <b>PO</b> 2, and several other variables including sagittal sinus PO 2, correlated highly with arterial PO 2 (Pa,O 2). In response to superimposed hypoxia (Pa,O 2 = 11 ± 1 Torr), LD-CBF was significantly blunted at high altitude, as compared with that at low altitude. In the two altitude groups fetal cerebral oxygenation was similar under both control conditions and with superimposed hypoxia, cortical <b>t</b> <b>PO</b> 2 decreasing from 8 ± 1 and 6 ± 1 Torr, respectively, to 2 ± 1 Torr. Also, for these conditions sagittal sinus PO 2 and [HbO 2] values were similar. In response to superimposed hypoxia, cerebral metabolic rate for O 2 decreased ∼ 50 % in each group (P < 0. 05). For both the fetus at low altitude and that acclimatized to high altitude LTH, we present the first dose–response data on the relation of LD-CBF, cortical <b>t</b> <b>PO</b> 2, and sagittal sinus blood gas values to Pa,O 2. In addition, despite differences in several variables, the fetus at high altitude showed evidence of successful acclimatization, supporting the hypothesis that such fetuses demonstrate no compromise in cerebral oxygenation...|$|E

Cells {{of these four}} strains were aerobic, non-motile spheres that occurred singly or in shapeless aggregates and attached to surfaces {{by means of a}} holdfast material. The isolates were moderately acidophilic, mesophilic organisms capable of growth between pH 4. 2 and 7. 5 (optimum growth at pH 5. 0 – 6. 2) and at temperatures between 4 and 33 °C (optimum growth at 20 – 26 °C). The strains possessed a complex intracellular membrane system that compartmentalized the cells. The major fatty acids were C 16 : 0, C 18 : 19 c and C 18 : 26 c, 12 c. The major quinone was menaquinone- 6 (MK- 6). The G+C content of the DNA was 57. 8 – 59. 9 mol%. 16 S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed that strains MOB 10 <b>T,</b> <b>PO</b> 2, MPL 1015 and BG 32 were members of the order Planctomycetales and belonged to a phylogenetic lineage defined by the genus Isosphaera, exhibiting 90 % sequence similarity to the type strain of the thermophilic planctomycete Isosphaera pallida and 95 – 95. 5 % sequence similarity to a taxonomically uncharacterized group of filamentous bacteria from activated sludge, ‘Nostocoida limicola’ III.

40|$|Parental {{behavioural}} traits can {{be transmitted}} by non-genetic mechanisms to the offspring. Although trait transmission via sperm has been extensively researched, epidemiological studies indicate the exclusive/prominent maternal transmission of many non-genetic traits. Since maternal conditions impact the offspring during gametogenesis and through fetal/early-postnatal life, the resultant phenotype is likely the aggregate of consecutive germline and somatic effects; a concept {{that has not been}} previously studied. Here, we dissected a complex maternally transmitted phenotype, reminiscent of comorbid generalized anxiety/depression, to elementary behaviours/domains and their transmission mechanisms in mice. We show that four anxiety/stress-reactive traits are transmitted via independent iterative-somatic and gametic epigenetic mechanisms across multiple generations. Somatic/gametic transmission alters DNA methylation at enhancers within synaptic genes whose functions can be linked to the behavioural traits. Traits have generation-dependent penetrance and sex specificity resulting in pleiotropy. A transmission-pathway-based concept can refine current inheritance models of psychiatric diseases and facilitate the development of better animal models and new therapeutic approaches.

40|$|Selectivity in mild {{oxidation}} of hydrocarbons {{is expected}} to increase by decoupling the two steps of the Mars and Van Krevelen's mechanism. As shown with the case of n-butane oxidation to maleic anhydride on VPO catalysts performed in the circulating fluid bed reactor, the more selective lattice oxygen specie are more efficiently used while adsorbed oxygen specie are minimised. The catalytic dense membrane reactor (CDMR) is another means for decoupling, provided that the used membrane exhibits mixed ionic and electronic properties, as well as suitable catalytic properties [1, 2]. The BIMEVOX membranes here used are based on Γ-Bi 4 V 2 O 11 in which V is partly substituted by ME (Co, Ni, Cu, Ta, etc.) [3]. BIMEVOX are interesting materials to be used as dense ceramic membranes in several applications, such as oxygen sensors, oxygen generators, solid oxide fuel cells or catalytic membranes. Their ion oxide conductivity, higher than that of YSZ, is high enough at moderate temperature (300 - 600 °C). However, their semi-permeability to O 2 is low because of the rate limiting recombination of O 2 - to O 2 [4]. In the CDMR, the dense membrane is tightly sealed between two compartments, the retentate site fed by pure or diluted oxygen (High oxygen partial pressure, HOP) and the permeate side fed by the diluted hydrocarbon (Low oxygen partial pressure, LOP), respectively. This work will show the interest of BIMEVOX materials for selective oxidation of hydrocarbons in a CDMR, as they allow the tuning of the activity of surface oxygen in the absence of gaseous O 2 [5] Experiments performed on BIMEVOX dense membranes using C 3 -C 1 alkanes will be described in terms of, (i), active sites on polished or unpolished surface, (ii), operating conditions (<b>T,</b> <b>pO</b> 2 in LOP) which determine the selectivity, either to mild oxidation products (propene, acrolein, CO), or to partial oxidation products (CO, H 2) and, (iii), nature of ME cations and relative properties. The complex behaviour differs according to ME and seems {{to be related to the}} type of electron semi-conduction depending on each dopant.

40|$|In the macaque the extrastriate area V 5 /MT {{is located}} within the dorsal half and on the {{posterior}} bank of the superior temporal sulcus. Neurons in V 5 /MT show directional tuning to moving stimuli. Furthermore, these neurons are organized in a retinotopic fashion with those responding to stimuli located {{at the center of}} gaze being more lateral and ventral within V 5 /MT (Gattass and Gross, 1981). We have now extended the technique of combined electrical microstimulation and fMRI from the striate cortex (Tolias et al., 2005) to this well-studied extrastriate region to further probe this technique as a tool to map the functional connectivity of the brain. We electrically stimulated V 5 /MT in the anaesthetized macaque in a 4. 7 T scanner with biphasic charge-balanced pulses (up to 1 mA and 200 us pulse width per phase) and evoked BOLD responses consistently in a number of brain areas known to be directly connected to V 5 /MT. BOLD responses were observed in ipsilateral V 2, V 3, V 4, V 4 <b>t,</b> <b>PO,</b> MST, in the anterior and posterior banks of the IPS (corresponding to LIP) and in the superior colliculus. Two types of projection patterns could be discerned by stimulation of either the peripheral or the foveal retinal representation of area V 5 /MT. The latter showed activation of regions located on the lateral surface of the occipital cortex while the former showed activity in mesial occiptio-parietal cortex. BOLD responses were surprisingly rather difficult to evoke in V 1 with our current stimulation paradigms. V 1 responses were largely seen in peripheral V 1 regions. This could indicate that the evoked BOLD responses are dominated by orthodromic vs antidromic pathway activation, however, electrical stimulation of the pulvinar in contrast to V 5 /MT evoked excellent BOLD responses in V 1. Since the V 1 -pulvinar connectivity is mainly feedforeward, this then proves that antidromic pathway activation is well detected by our method. Hence the different activation patterns that we observe in V 1 after MT/V 5 and pulvinar stimulation are rather related to the different pathways characteristics, possibly related to differences in the type of synaptic connectivity. Thus microstimulation combined with fMRI may well prove to be a novel technique suited to reveal different characteristics of the brains functional connectivity...|$|E

The reaction product concentration for the coagulation of FPPs is SP (PQ) /V (T = 1) and [Sp (Po,max) — Sp (P 0) ]/V (T = 1) is the reactant concentration. The relative coagulation times of FPPs and of AGGs reap, are defined as the ratio [reaction product]/[reactant] of second order reactions. The formation of AGGs defined by P 0 = 6 from FPPs {{and the growth of}} AGGs defined by T = 1 into those defined by T = 2 in steps of AT = 1 /PG is also demonstrated numerically as an example. Simple programs can be set up to demonstrate graphically the shift of the histograms ”Ai, Ar vs, Pi, Pr” and ”NP vs. Pi, Pr” with increasing Tc and to calculate the values Aa for any value of Po the computer can process. One of the aims of the experiments should be to evaluate the values of SP (exp). Then, as rule, a Po value can be established for which SP (Pc) < SP (exp) < Sp (Po + 1) is valid and a correction factor F for which F = Sp (exp) / /Sp (Po) is valid. Then is F the number of AGGs of maximal size.

Protein expression profile was evaluated by computer-assisted image analysis (PDQUEST) and proteins were subsequently identified using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ ionisation mass spectrometry. The aim was to analyse the protein expression profiles using the hierarchical clustering method in vaginal carcinoma and to compare them with the protein pattern in cervical carcinoma {{in order to find}} a helpful tool for correct classification and for increased biomedical knowledge. Protein expression data of a distinct set of 33 protein spots were differentially expressed. These differences were statistically significant (Mann–Whitney signed-Ranked <b>Test,</b> <b>Po</b> 0. 05) between normal tissue, vaginal and cervical cancer. Furthermore, protein profiles of pairs of primary vaginal and cervical cancers were found to be very similar.

40|$|AbstractThe Pak kinases are {{targets of}} the Rho GTPases Rac and Cdc 42, which {{regulate}} cell shape and motility [1 – 5]. It is increasingly apparent that part of this function {{is due to the}} effect Pak kinases have on microtubule organization and dynamics. Recently, overexpression of Xenopus Pak 5 was shown to enhance microtubule stabilization, and it was shown that mammalian Pak 1 may inhibit a microtubule-destabilizing protein, Op 18 /Stathmin [6, 7]. We have identified a specific phosphorylation site on mammalian Pak 1, T 212, which is targeted by the neuronal p 35 /Cdk 5 kinase [8, 9]. Pak 1 phosphorylated on T 212, Pak 1 <b>T</b> 212 (<b>PO</b> 4), is enriched in axonal growth cones and colocalizes with small peripheral bundles of microtubules. Cortical neurons overexpressing a Pak 1 A 212 mutant display a tangled neurite morphology, which suggests that the microtubule cytoskeleton is affected [9]. Here, we show that cyclin B 1 /Cdc 2 phosphorylates Pak 1 in cells undergoing mitosis. In the developing cortex and in cultured fibroblasts, Pak 1 <b>T</b> 212 (<b>PO</b> 4) is enriched in microtubule-organizing centers and along parts of the spindles. In living cells, a peptide mimicking phosphorylated T 212 accumulates at the centrosomes and spindles and causes an increased length of astral microtubules during metaphase or following nocodazole washout. Together these results suggest that similar signaling pathways regulate microtubule dynamics in a remodeling axonal growth cone and during cell division...|$|R

40|$|The process {{development}} unit (PDU) test program {{is part of}} an ongoing effort at the Energy & Environmental Research Center (EERC) to expand the base of knowledge for the thermal depolymerization of plastics process. This phase of the development effort, initiated after successful completion of a bench-scale program, has concentrated on maximizing liquid yield. The purposes of the PDU program were (1) to demonstrate the process on a commercially scalable unit, (2) to produce quantities of product {{that could be used to}} initiate discussions with potential end users, and (3) to gather engineering and yield data. Experimentation consisted of eleven test points on the PDU and seven on the continuous fluid-bed reactor (CFBR) bench-scale unit. Initial PDU tests (PO 35 -PO 39) were carried out using a base blend, which consists of 60 % high-density polyethylene (HDPE), 20 % polypropylene (PP), and 20 % polystyrene (PS) virgin resin pellets. <b>Test</b> <b>PO</b> 39 used base blend with 5 % polyvinyl chloride (PVC). The base blend decomposed to produce a flowable liquid, with liquid yields ranging from 33 % to 45 %. The next series of tests, PO 40 -PO 44, used a postconsumer plastics feed. This material did not decompose as readily as the base blend and formed a very waxy, heavy liquid, with {open_quotes}liquid{close_quotes} yields ranging from 18 % to 63 % (low liquid yields are the result of using excess air in the natural gas burner in some tests in an attempt to increase gas residence time) ...|$|R

Because of its peculiar defectivity, strongly dependent on the postdeposition thermal treatments, this system is an ideal model to study the structure {{and the evolution of}} defects in oxide nanophases. Atomistic models for each of the detected defects are obtained, which accurately reproduce the STM images showing that the experimentally observed defects essentially consist of Ti vacancies or irregular atomic distributions within the troughs exposing the bare substrate surface and that their formation energy is quite small, so that the system is under kinetic control in the given conditions of <b>T</b> and <b>pO</b> 2...|$|R
40|$|Flight or fight" reflex is the instictive {{survival}} {{reaction to}} perceived danger. In humans the first emotional reaction is fear and to "flight" away from danger. However fear mobilizes also strength for "fight" and survival. This is fundamental for police officers (POs), {{responding to the}} danger. So far no information is available about the interaction between emotional and cardiovascular (CV) response during “real combat” and their effects {{on the outcome of}} a lethal force (LF) confrontation. We have investigated the cardiovascular adaptation during combat shooting using two models. 1) National IPSC competition (6 shooters), 2) Man-versus-Man real combat, with paint-bullets (10 S. W. A. <b>T</b> <b>POs),</b> under different tactical scenarios. ECG and Blood pressure (BP) were recorded with Holter equipments. Psychological stress was rated by a questionnaire and behaviour was studied with TV cameras. Results: Marked tachycardia, above 180 beats per minute was recorded in 4 IPSC shooters, during "field course" stages. In 2 of them the heart rate (HR) under stress reached about 200 beats per minute, for the occurrence of unsustained paroxysmal atrial tachyarrhythmias. BP behaviour was different among the 6 IPSC shooters, with mean systolic ranging between 140 and 170 mmHg and maximal systolic between 160 e 240 mmHg. In Police combat scenarios, HR was above 150 bpm in all POs, even during expectation of danger, and above 170 bpm during shootings. HR above 180 bpm was often associated with irrational behaviour and poor situational control. Conclusion: CV monitoring evidenced different psycho-physiological reactions in POs exposed to the same situational stress. Abnormal HR and BP values were clearly associated with individual behavioural impairment, lack of tactical efficacy and winnig attitude. CV monitoring of POs, during tactical training in LF scenarios, is useful to evaluate individual psycho-physical reactions and capability to cope with combat stress, and to develope more effective training method...|$|R
40|$|The {{transitional}} {{period between the}} oncosphere and the cysticercus of Taenia solium is the postoncospheral (PO) form, which {{has not yet been}} completely characterized. The aim of this work was to standardize a method to obtain <b>T.</b> solium <b>PO</b> forms by in vitro cultivation. We studied the morphology of the PO form and compared the expression of antigenic proteins among the PO form, oncosphere, and cysticerci stages. T. solium activated oncospheres were co-cultured with ten cell lines to obtain PO forms, which we studied at three stages of development [...] days 15, 30, and 60. A high percentage (32 %) of PO forms was obtained using HCT- 8 cells in comparison to the other cell lines. The morphology was observed by bright field, scanning, and transmission electron microscopy. Morphology of the PO form changed over time, with the six hooks commonly seen in the oncosphere stage disappearing in the PO forms, and vesicles and microtriches observed in the tegument. The PO forms grew as they aged, reaching a diameter of 2. 5 mm at 60 days of culture. 15 - 30 day PO forms developed into mature cysticerci when inoculated into rats. Antigenic proteins expressed in the PO forms are also expressed by the oncosphere and cysticerci stages, with more cysticerci antigenic proteins expressed as the PO forms ages. This is the first report of an in vitro production method of <b>T.</b> solium <b>PO</b> forms. The changes observed in protein expression may be useful in identifying new targets for vaccine development. In vitro culture of PO form will aid in understanding the host-parasite relationship, since the structural changes of the developing PO forms may reflect the parasite's immunoprotective mechanisms. A wider application of this method could significantly reduce the use of animals, and thus the costs and time required for further experimental investigations...|$|R
