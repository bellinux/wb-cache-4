40|$|The {{growth in}} {{knowledge}} sharing enabled by the (Semantic) Web has made trust an increasingly critical issue. Based on explicit inter-agent trust relations, a <b>trust</b> <b>network</b> emerges on the (Semantic) Web {{in the knowledge}} sharing context. The concept of a <b>trust</b> <b>network</b> and its application to knowledge sharing have received recent attention but neither their structural properties (e. g. dynamics, complexity) nor inference mechanisms (e. g. trust discovery, trust evolution, trust propagation) have been well addressed. This paper formalizes <b>trust</b> <b>network</b> inference notions, providing both data and computational models, and suggests an evaluation model for benchmarking. The data model clarifies the data (context, restriction, output) used by <b>trust</b> <b>network</b> inference for knowledge sharing. It also elaborates <b>trust</b> <b>network</b> representation and articulates different types of trust. The computational model reviews graph theory and referral <b>network</b> interpretations of <b>trust</b> <b>network</b> inference and proposes a new one that treats <b>trust</b> <b>network</b> as an emergent property. This new model supports both trust evolution and trust propagation. The evaluation model describes metrics as well as methods to generate test scenarios and data. We argue that this approach is more customizable, flexible and scalable than traditional approaches such as public reputation systems and collaborative filtering. 1...|$|R

40|$|Trust {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} factors for participants' decision-making in Online Social <b>Networks</b> (OSNs). The <b>trust</b> <b>network</b> from a source to a target without any prior interaction contains some important intermediate participants, the trust relations between the participants, and the social context, each of which has an important influence on trust evaluation. Thus, before performing any trust evaluation, the contextual <b>trust</b> <b>network</b> from a given source to a target needs to be extracted first, where constraints on the social context should also be considered to guarantee the quality of extracted networks. However, this problem has been proved to be NP-Complete. Towards solving this challenging problem, we first propose a complex contextual social network structure which considers social contextual impact factors. These factors have significant influences on both social interaction between participants and trust evaluation. Then, we propose a new concept called QoTN (Quality of <b>Trust</b> <b>Network)</b> and a social context-aware <b>trust</b> <b>network</b> discovery model. Finally, we propose a Social Context-Aware <b>trust</b> <b>Network</b> discovery algorithm (SCAN) by adopting the Monte Carlo method and our proposed optimization strategies. The experimental results illustrate that our proposed model and algorithm outperform the existing methods in both algorithm efficiency and the quality of the extracted <b>trust</b> <b>network.</b> 7 page(s...|$|R
