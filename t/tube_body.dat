50|$|A tube is a soft {{squeezable}} container {{which can}} be used for thick liquids such as adhesive, caulking, ointment, and toothpaste. Basically, a tube is a cylindrical, hollow piece with a round or oval profile, made of plastic, paperboard, or aluminum. Both ends of this tube are treated differently during the manufacturing process and filling. In general, {{on one end of the}} <b>tube</b> <b>body</b> there is a round orifice, {{which can be}} closed by different caps and closures. The orifice can be shaped in many different ways. Plastic nozzles in various styles and lengths are just one good example.|$|E
50|$|Specific designs {{involve the}} rotor of the pump being {{made of a}} steel, coated with a smooth hard surface, {{normally}} chromium, with the body (the stator) made of a molded elastomer inside a metal <b>tube</b> <b>body.</b> The elastomer core of the stator forms the required complex cavities. The rotor is held against the inside surface of the stator by angled link arms, bearings (immersed in the fluid) allowing it to roll around the inner surface (un-driven). Elastomer {{is used for the}} stator to simplify the creation of the complex internal shape, created by means of casting, which also improves the quality and longevity of the seals by progressively swelling due to absorption of water and/or other common constituents of pumped fluids. Elastomer/pumped fluid compatibility will thus need to be taken into account.|$|E
50|$|A Kolitong is {{a bamboo}} polychordal tube zither from Bontok, Kalinga, Philippines with six strings that run {{parallel}} to its <b>tube</b> <b>body.</b> The strings are numbered {{from one to}} six, from lowest to highest pitch. The body acts as the instrument's resonator. The body may be a whole tube or a half tube, {{in both cases the}} two ends of the body are closed by the bamboo nodes. To help with the resonance of the instrument, holes are made on both nodes and long cracks are made along the body parallel to the strings. In the Kalinga group, men play the Kolitong at night as a solo instrument. A variety of bamboo tube zithers are found throughout the Philippine archipelago, each zither differing from the other in name, size, and design depending on its associated ethnic group.|$|E

50|$|Solid-state {{controls}} {{are used in}} gas and electric applications at the high range of the performance and cost spectrum. Composed of two parts, the sensor probe and the control box, solid state thermostats are the most precise control available for griddle operation. The probe consists of two thermocouple wires mounted in a protective capillary <b>tube</b> <b>body</b> that is mounted (typically threaded) into the griddle plate material at a location {{near the center of}} the heating element being controlled. When a temperature variation is detected the probe sends an electrical signal to the control box, which consists of an electrical circuit board that then activates or deactivates the burner system. This control system can respond almost instantly to temperature changes on the griddle surface, which provides a far superior temperature control response to the fluid filled capillary bulb found in Modulating and Snap Action thermostats. Temperature consistency to set point of +/- 5F is typical.|$|E
5000|$|Ebenezer Floppen Slopper's Wonderful Water slides is an {{abandoned}} waterpark {{located on a}} large hill on Roosevelt Road and Route 83 in Oakbrook Terrace, Illinois. It first opened on July 5, 1980 with two 800 foot concrete water slides and gradually added 5 additional slides and a wading pool. The water park became a major summer attraction for residents of surrounding towns and communities as people lined up for rides down the large winding slides. When the two main slides first began operation, people slid down in groups of up to eight people at a time on rubber mats. The 5 other slides added to the park included 2 flat racer slides in which people slid down head first on folded rubber mats, 2 semi enclosed <b>tube</b> <b>body</b> slides, and a smaller inner tube slide which emptied into a nearby wading pool. The slides were also unique in that they were lined with a blue rubber foam material which would prevent injuries from contacts with the slide walls. Due {{to the design of}} the 2 main large concrete slides, especially with the V-shaped configuration of their side walls, people could also slide quite high up the walls of the slides, especially when hitting a turn at high speeds. Around 1987, the large concrete slides were re surfaced with flat bottoms with humps and bumps in which people went down solo on inner tubes, getting bumped up and down and sideways as they went down the renovated slides and the park was re named [...] "Doc River's Roaring Rapids water park." ...|$|E

40|$|Pipelines {{tubes are}} part of vital {{mechanical}} systems largely used in petrochemical industries. They serve to transport natural gases or liquids. They are cylindrical tubes and are submitted to the risks of corrosion due to high PH concentrations of the transported liquids in addition to fatigue cracks due to the alternation of pressure-depression of gas along the time, initiating therefore in the <b>tubes</b> <b>body</b> micro-cracks that can propagate abruptly to lead to failure. The development of the prognostic process for such systems increases largely their performance and their availability, as well decreases the global cost of their missions. Therefore, this paper deals with a new prognostic approach to improve the performance of these pipelines. Only the first mode of crack, that is, the opening mode, is considered...|$|R

40|$|AbstractDefects in {{closure of}} {{embryonic}} tissues {{such as the}} neural <b>tube,</b> <b>body</b> wall, face and eye lead to severe birth defects. Cell adhesion is hypothesized to contribute to closure of the neural tube and body wall; however, potential molecular regulators of this process have not been identified. Here we identify an ENU-induced mutation in mice that reveals a molecular pathway of embryonic closure. Line 2 F homozygous mutant embryos fail to close the neural <b>tube,</b> <b>body</b> wall, face, and optic fissure, and they also display defects in lung and heart development. Using a new technology of genomic sequence capture and high-throughput sequencing of a 2. 5 Mb region of the mouse genome, we discovered a mutation in the grainyhead-like 2 gene (Grhl 2). Microarray analysis revealed Grhl 2 affects {{the expression of a}} battery of genes involved in cell adhesion and E-cadherin protein is drastically reduced in tissues that require Grhl 2 function. The tissue closure defects in Grhl 2 mutants are similar to that of AP- 2 α null mutants and AP- 2 α has been shown to bind to the promoter of E-cadherin. Therefore, we tested for a possible interaction between these genes. However, we find that Grhl 2 and AP- 2 α do not regulate each other's expression, E-cadherin expression is normal in AP- 2 α mutants during neural tube closure, and Grhl 2;AP- 2 α trans-heterozygous embryos are morphologically normal. Taken together, our studies point to a complex regulation of neural tube fusion and highlight the importance of comparisons between these two models to understand more fully the molecular pathways of embryonic tissue closure...|$|E

40|$|AbstractAccidental impacts are {{a common}} source of damage in {{submarine}} pipelines. In this article, response of internally pressurized steel pipelines subjected to lateral dynamic impact loads has been studied using a three dimensional finite element simulation. The numerical model has first been validated against experimental data from other researchers. Moderately thick wall steel tubes that may show noticeable inelastic deformations during lateral impacts have been considered in the study. Geometrical and material nonlinearities in the <b>tube</b> <b>body</b> and in the sub-soil medium have been taken into consideration. Effects from internal fluid pressure, dynamic wave propagation in the internal fluid, velocity of the dropped object, embedment depth of the pipe and soil bed properties have been investigated. It {{was found that the}} sea bed properties may have important effects on the extent of denting, especially at relatively low internal pressures. It has also been shown that with increase in the embedment depth of the pipe into the bed, the maximum impact load and maximum dent depth were increasing but the permanent dent did not completely follow suite...|$|E
40|$|The shock-wave {{resistance}} of WS 2 nanotubes {{has been studied}} and {{compared to that of}} carbon nanotubes. Detailed structural features of post-shock samples were investigated using HRTEM, XRD, and Raman spectroscopy. WS 2 nanotubes are capable of withstanding shear stress caused by shock waves of up to 21 GPa, although some nanotube tips and nanoparticles containing multiple structural defects in the bending regions are destroyed. Small WS 2 species, consisting of only a few layers, are extruded from the nanotubes. Well-crystallized <b>tube</b> <b>bodies</b> were found to exhibit significant stability under shock, indicating high tensile strength. XRD and Raman analyses have confirmed this structural stability. Under similar shock conditions, WS 2 tubes are more stable than carbon nanotubes, the latter being transformed into a diamond phase. WS 2 nanotubes containing small concentrations of defects possess significantly higher mechanical strength, and, as a consequence, hollow WS 2 nanoparticles are expected to act as excellent lubricants under much higher loading than was previously thought...|$|R
