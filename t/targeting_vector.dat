30|$|The {{delivery}} of a neuropharmaceutical across the BBB through a receptor-mediated transport system requires linkage to the BBB delivery vector that targets a known blood-barrier receptor such as the transferrin receptor or the insulin receptor[31]. The neuropharmaceutical {{can be linked to}} the <b>targeting</b> <b>vector</b> either covalently or non-covalently and can be conjugated to its <b>targeting</b> <b>vector</b> through various methods including chemical linkage or non-covalent steptavidin/biotin linkage[32]. The highest priority for any conjugation strategy is to ensure that neither the transport vector nor the pharmaceutical product lose their function[32]. Chemical linkage strategies may involve linking the pharmaceutical drug to the <b>targeting</b> <b>vector</b> using lysine residues of either the <b>targeting</b> <b>vector</b> or the protein followed by chemical functionalization using Traut’s reagent, maleimide, and chemical spacer[33]. Non-covalent streptavidin/biotin linkage can involve monobiotinylation at lysine residues using N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) analogs of biotin, biotin hydrazide which reacts with carboxylic acid moieties on glutamate and aspartate residues, or through a thioester linkage between streptavidin and the targeting vector[34].|$|E

Using two-color fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis, we have determined the integration sites of the gene <b>targeting</b> <b>vector</b> with respect to the target locus in a murine fibroblast line (LTA). We found that for ectopic gene targeting the distribution of integration sites was bimodal, being either within 3 Mb of the target or on chromosomes distinct from the chromosome carrying the target locus.

Interestingly, interphase analysis indicated that vector sequences which had integrated ectopically in chromosomes other than the target colocalized with the target locus at a significant frequency compared to that of colocalization to random unlinked loci.

The targeting frequency was examined at two sites within the Hprt locus {{as a function}} of the extent of homology between the <b>targeting</b> <b>vector</b> and the target locus. The targeting frequency was also compared by using vectors prepared from isogenic and nonisogenic DNA sources. With one exception, all of the vectors showed the same exponential dependence of targeting efficiency on the extent of homology between the <b>targeting</b> <b>vector</b> and the target locus. This was true regardless of whether they were sequence replacement or sequence insertion vectors, whether they were directed toward either of the two different sites within the Hprt locus, or whether they were prepared from isogenic or nonisogenic DNA sources. Vectors prepared from isogenic DNA targeted four to five times more efficiently than did the corresponding vectors prepared from nonisogenic DNA. The single case of unexpectedly low targeting efficiency involved one of the vectors prepared from nonisogenic DNA and could be attributed to an unfavorable distribution of heterology between the Hprt sequences present in the <b>targeting</b> <b>vector</b> and the endogenous Hprt gene.

40|$|Lentiviral vectors (LVs) are potent gene {{transfer}} vehicles frequently applied {{in research and}} recently also in clinical trials. Retargeting LV entry to cell types of interest is a key issue to improve {{gene transfer}} safety and efficacy. Recently, we have developed a targeting method for LVs by incorporating engineered measles virus (MV) glycoproteins, the hemagglutinin (H), responsible for receptor recognition, and the fusion protein into their envelope. The H protein displays a single-chain antibody (scFv) specific for the target receptor and is ablated for recognition of the MV receptors CD 46 and SLAM by point mutations in its ectodomain. A potential hindrance to systemic administration in humans is pre-existing MV-specific immunity due to vaccination or natural infection. We compared transduction of <b>targeting</b> <b>vectors</b> and non-targeting vectors pseudotyped with MV glycoproteins unmodified in their ectodomains (MV-LV) in presence of α-MV antibody-positive human plasma. At plasma dilution 1 : 160 MV-LV was almost completely neutralized, whereas <b>targeting</b> <b>vectors</b> showed relative transduction efficiencies from 60 % to 90 %. Furthermore, at plasma dilution 1 : 80 an at least 4 -times higher multiplicity of infection (MOI) of MV-LV had {{to be applied to}} obtain similar transduction efficiencies as with <b>targeting</b> <b>vectors.</b> Also when the vectors were normalized to their p 24 values, <b>targeting</b> <b>vectors</b> showed partial protection against α-MV antibodies in human plasma. Furthermore, the monoclonal neutralizing antibody K 71 with a putative epitope close to the receptor binding sites of H, did not neutralize the <b>targeting</b> <b>vectors,</b> but did neutralize MV-LV. The observed escape from neutralization {{may be due to the}} point mutations in the H ectodomain that might have destroyed antibody binding sites. Furthermore, scFv mediated cell entry via the target receptor may proceed in presence of α-MV antibodies interfering with entry via the natural MV receptors.

A null mutation leads to mid-gestation lethality [1 – 4], obscuring the later roles of the gene in organogenesis. We have generated a multi-purpose gene alteration by combining the potential for homologous and site-specific recombination in a single <b>targeting</b> <b>vector,</b> and using the selectable marker for neomycin-resistance, neo, to downregulate gene activity. This allowed us to create a series of alleles that led to different levels of N-myc expression. The phenotypes revealed a spectrum of developmental problems.

AEP 1 immunoreactivity was localized at the acrosome region of the rat, human, monkey and porcine spermatids and spermatozoa, suggesting that AEP 1 may {{play a significant role}} on acrosome formation. We hypothesized that AEP 1 deficiency may cause acrosomal defect in mouse sperm leading to infertility. Methods: To elucidate the role of AEP 1 during spermatogenesis, a Cre-LoxP conditional gene knock out approach will be used to generate AEP 1 deficient mice for functional studies. Results: Conditional target vector was constructed by inserting the LoxP sites flanking the exons 2 and 3 of the AEP 1 gene. A neo cassette flanked by Frt sites and a splice-receptor conjugated EGFP gene for in vitro selection of recombinant embryonic stem (ES) cells and Loxed AEP 1 allele in sperm, respectively, were inserted downstream of the exons 3. In vitro recombinant occurred when the <b>targeting</b> <b>vector</b> was transformed into E. coli harboring Cre or Flp recombinases targeting for LoxP and Frt sites of the <b>targeting</b> <b>vector,</b> respectively.

To explore this mechanism of recombination an assay was developed, designated as Recombination Access Mapping (RAM), that uses ectopic gene targeting coupled with two color FISH analysis. Using RAM, the integration sites of the gene <b>targeting</b> <b>vector</b> with respect to the target locus were determined for ectopic gene targeting in a murine fibroblast cell line (LTA). The distribution of integration sites was found to be bimodal during ectopic gene targeting, being either within 2 [...] 3 Mb of the target or on distinct chromosomes from the chromosome carrying the target locus. Both inter and intrachromosomal sites appeared to be equally accessible to the <b>targeting</b> <b>vector</b> with site specific variations. In contrast, illegitimate integration of a transgene was found to occur randomly in the LTA cell line. Interestingly, interphase analysis indicated that vector sequences which had integrated ectopically in other chromosomes than the target co-localized with the target locus at a significant frequency as compared to random unlinked loci. Mechanistically, the homologous recombination event that produces the extrachromosomal recombinant DNA molecule, following ectopic gene targeting or interplasmid recombination, was demonstrated to potentiate or commit the recombinant DNA to integration in the genome at the site of a double-strand break (DSB). This data suggests that extrachromosomal and chromosomal DSB repair are coupled, and therefore the integration site of the transgene during ectopic gene targeting is most likely a DSB in close proximity spatially to the target locus. The conclusion of this thesis is that RAM can be used to determine which chromosomal domains within the genome are accessible to a given genetic locus.
