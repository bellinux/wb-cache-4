5|$|After {{allegations}} that the design contractor had inflated costs for the tunnel {{in order to avoid}} sharing the job with an outside tunneling contractor, the long tunnel concept was revived in April 2006. The allegations led <b>to</b> <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> an outside cost estimate to determine more realistic tunnel costs. On May 15, 2006, Virginia Transportation Secretary Pierce R. Homer announced the creation of an advisory panel headed by the American Society of Civil Engineers. The panel had about two months to evaluate options for completing the line through Tysons Corner, with the results presented to the state on July 27, 2006 and published on July 31, 2006.|$|E
5|$|During the 1930s, a {{combination}} of developments, from the Great Depression to the vicious spiral of OUN terrorist attacks and government pacifications, caused government relations with the national minorities to deteriorate. Unrest among national minorities was also related to foreign policy. Troubles followed repressions in largely Ukrainian-populated eastern Galicia, where nearly 1,800 persons were arrested. Tension also arose {{between the government and}} Poland's German minority, particularly in Upper Silesia. The government did not yield <b>to</b> <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> antisemitic measures; but the Jews (8.6% of Poland's population) grew discontented for economic reasons that were connected with the depression. Overall, by the end of Piłsudski's life, his government's relations with national minorities were increasingly problematic.|$|E

5|$|During {{the campaigns}} of 1778, Brant {{achieved}} an undeserved reputation for brutality. He {{was not present}} at Wyoming — although many thought he was — and he actively sought to minimize the atrocities that took place at Cherry Valley. Diaries belonging to British soldiers during the campaign state the regiment as being the butchers and given that Butler was the overall commander of the expedition, there is controversy with whom actually ordered or failed to restrain the killings. The massacre contributed <b>to</b> <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> reprisals, leading to the 1779 Sullivan Expedition which drove the Iroquois out of western New York.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} <b>to</b> <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> {{action from}} the Drapier in the second letter, a group of bankers joined together on 17 August 1724, agreeing in writing {{that they would not}} accept the coin produced under Wood's patent. Other merchants and tradesmen followed in a similar fashion. However, this did not stop Walpole from ordering the Commissioners of the Revenue in Ireland to enter the coin into the Irish economy. Regardless of Walpole's orders, the Irish Lord Justices did not act, Lord Shannon did not command that his troops should be issued Wood's coin, and Middleton's House of Lords and Conolly's House of Commons did not pass any resolution backing up Walpole's order, which effectively prevented the coin from being distributed.|$|E
5|$|It is {{believed}} that initial investigations into the treatment of Afghan detainees sparked investigations into Canada's elite military unit, Joint Task Force 2 (JTF2). The first investigation, named Sand Trap, examined allegations that a JTF2 member {{was involved in the}} 2006 shooting death of an Afghan who was surrendering. No charges were laid {{at the conclusion of the}} investigation. However, a larger investigation called Sand Trap II began hearing from witnesses in May 2009 regarding allegations of JTF2 members witnessing United States armed forces killing an unarmed man. This investigation is still being conducted by the Canadian Forces National Investigation Service, and it has led <b>to</b> <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> civilian oversight of JTF2.|$|E

5|$|Miller {{warmed up}} for the Second Victory Test by top-scoring for the RAAF against Lancashire and the RAF. In the Test, played at Bramall Lane, Miller went wicketless and scored 17 in the first innings. In the second innings, Miller bowled a fierce spell, hitting Test world record holder Len Hutton and Cyril Washbrook on the arm and head respectively, {{provoking}} an angry crowd reaction. At the time, Miller had a leisurely attitude towards bowling, so his success led <b>to</b> <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> him to start taking it seriously, instead of simply jogging in and releasing the ball. Despite this, Australia lost the match.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle was}} brought to greater public {{attention}} in 1992 by a CBC television docu-drama, The Valour and the Horror, which {{made a number of}} controversial claims about senior leadership in the Second World War and devoted one of its three episodes to the Black Watch attack on Verrières Ridge. The episode raised a spirited debate among the historical and veterans' communities and led <b>to</b> <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> apologies from the producers and an official investigation by the CBC Ombudsman into the veracity of the claims {{and the way in which}} they were presented.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of the first practical jet engines in the late-World War II period led <b>to</b> <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> new jet-powered versions of practically every aircraft then flying. Among these was {{the design of a}} replacement for the de Havilland Mosquito, at that time among the world's leading light bombers. The Mosquito had been designed with the express intent of lightening the aircraft in order to improve its speed as much as possible, a process that led to the removal of all defensive armament, improving performance {{to the point where it}} was unnecessary anyway. This high-speed approach was extremely successful, and a jet-powered version would be even more difficult to intercept.|$|E

5|$|The testimonies {{of foreigners}} at the {{cemetery}} were quickly reported to international news organisations, and video footage of the massacre was widely broadcast internationally causing outrage. In response to the massacre, activists around the world organised in solidarity with the East Timorese, and a new urgency was brought <b>to</b> <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> self-determination. TAPOL, a British organisation formed in 1973 to advocate for democracy in Indonesia, increased its work around East Timor. In the United States, the East Timor Action Network (now the East Timor and Indonesia Action Network) was founded and soon had chapters in ten cities around the country. Other solidarity groups appeared in Portugal, Australia, Japan, Germany, Malaysia, Ireland, and Brazil.|$|E
5|$|Despite U.S. {{declarations}} of neutrality and German accountability for its unrestricted submarine warfare, in 1915 the British passenger liner Lusitania was sunk, leading <b>to</b> <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> war. President Wilson forced the Germans to suspend unrestricted submarine warfare and after long debate Congress passes the Naval Act of 1916 that authorized a $500million construction program {{over three years}} for 10 battleships, 6 battlecruisers, 10 scout cruisers, 50 destroyers and 67 submarines. The idea was a balanced fleet, but in the event destroyers were much more important, {{because they had to}} handle submarines and convoys. By {{the end of the war}} 273 destroyers had been ordered; most were finished after World War I ended but many served in World War II. There were few war plans beyond the defense of the main American harbors.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of Mora's death, the {{organization}} he worked with cancelled beach patrol efforts in Costa Rica. His death attracted international attention, including {{a statement from the}} United Nations and multiple rewards for information on the case. In Costa Rica, his death led <b>to</b> <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> reform of environmental policy. On June 4, the government met with environmentalists to discuss potential changes to policy. A plan submitted by environmentalists and endorsed by Environment Minister René Castro would set up a new protected area and grant park rangers more authority to stop poachers, among other changes. On June 5, vigils were held across Costa Rica in honor of Mora. On June 18, the government announced the allocation of ₡20 million (US$40,000), which was later upped to ₡30 million (US$60,000), to memorialize Mora.|$|E

5|$|Miller {{went on to}} play {{a two-day}} match for the RAAF against Lancashire, where his 52 was the only fifty in a low-scoring game. He also took match figures of 2/28. After scoring 30 in an innings victory over Learie Constantine's XI, Miller {{represented}} the RAAF against the RAF at Lord's where he top-scored with 63 in 90 minutes. The Second Victory Test was played at Bramall Lane in Sheffield, where the grandstands were damaged by German air raids. Hassett sent the Englishmen into bat. Miller went wicketless. He was run {{out in the first}} innings for 17. In the second innings, Miller bowled a fast and hostile spell, hitting Test world record holder Len Hutton in the arm before hitting Cyril Washbrook in the head, provoking an angry crowd reaction, comparing Miller to the Bodyline spearhead Harold Larwood. He later removed Washbrook and ended with 2/28. His efforts led <b>to</b> <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> him to start taking his bowling seriously, instead of simply jogging in releasing the ball, especially from former South African representative Bob Crisp. Despite this, Miller fell for eight in the second innings and Australia fell 41 runs short of the target and series was squared.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{because the}} judge is {{empowered}} to disregard previous judgments (either his own or of other judges) and can apply his personal interpretation of Sharia to any particular case through ijtihad, divergent judgements arise even in apparently identical cases. There is a presumption against overturning a decision when {{it is based on}} ijtihad. This principle is crucial in two respects. Firstly, it concentrates the substance of the law in the hands of judges as, in consequence, there is a presumption that only a judge exercising ijtihad, rather than a king or a parliament, can determine God's law. Secondly, it renders a judge's decision practically immune to reversal on appeal. The role of ijtihad has led <b>to</b> <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> the Sharia to be codified to give clarity and remove uncertainty. As a result, in 2010, the Minister of Justice announced plans to implement a codification of Sharia law, although resistance from the religious establishment is reportedly delaying its implementation.|$|E
5|$|Today, {{the duties}} of the sheriff include law {{enforcement}} services of the two county courthouses and surrounding property, service of court-ordered warrants, writs, protective orders, and other injunctions, and limited patrol responsibility with the County Police. The Domestic Violence Unit has expanded its role in the county to include responding <b>to</b> <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> service that are domestic-related. The creation of the School Resource Deputy division has placed a deputy sheriff at all of the local high schools, replacing the County Police. All other law enforcement services of the county are provided by multiple agencies but mostly left to the separate Prince George's County Police Department (PGPD), though some responsibilities are shared by both agencies. The PGSO, like most other county-level law enforcement agencies in the United States, is a progressive agency with an array of services in tom a Specialized Services Team dealing with high-risk arrest warrants and barricaded situations to community services aiding the county's residents in safety education. Although the agency is not yet nationally accredited, it currently has a unit dedicated to accreditation.|$|E

5|$|Up {{until the}} 1890s, the {{government}} had no presence in the far north-west of Canada. In 1894, the rise of gold mining and a growing population led <b>to</b> <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> Ottawa to intervene, both to control whiskey trading {{and to protect the}} local First Nations. In response, the mounted police carried out a survey along the Yukon River and gathered customs duties. Fears grew that the United States might try to seize the mineral-rich region, and a twenty-man police team was established at Forty Mile in 1895. Although there was very little actual crime, frictions soon rose between the police and the Miners' Committees, which had been created to provide informal justice during the previous few years. The police brought the issue to a head in June 1896, sending a team into one of the mining camps to overturn the decisions of the local committee.|$|E
5|$|WMATA's {{bus system}} is a {{successor}} to four privately owned bus companies. While WMATA's original compact provided only for rail service, by 1970 the need for reliable bus services to connect passengers to rail stations led <b>to</b> <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> authority to overhaul the entire bus system as well. The compact was amended in 1971, allowing the authority to operate buses and take over bus companies. After months of negotiation with Chalk failed to produce an agreed price, on January 14, 1973, WMATA condemned DC Transit and its sister company, the Washington, Virginia and Maryland Coach Company and acquired their assets for $38.2 million. On February 4, it acquired Alexandria, Barcroft and Washington Transit Company, which operated in Northern Virginia, and the WMA Transit Company of Prince George's County for $4.5 million. While AB and WMA Transit were in better financial condition than DC Transit, their owners {{did not wish to}} compete with a publicly owned bus system, and requested takeover.|$|E
5|$|During the {{conflict}} itself, monuments were erected near the battlefields and the temporary cemeteries {{being used to}} store the dead. It had been hoped in Britain to repatriate the war dead, but this rapidly proved entirely impractical, leading to haphazard, improvised arrangements around the battlefields. By 1916 over 200 war cemeteries had been commissioned in France and Belgium, prompting debate about what longer term memorials might be appropriate at these sites. The government was concerned that unsuitable, even distasteful memorials might be erected by relatives at the cemeteries and the decision was taken that the cemeteries would be controlled by the state, and that a uniform design would {{be applied to the}} memorials at the graves. French cemeteries were used for as memorial sites for ceremonies by injured soldiers during the war and many towns began to name streets and squares after Verdun. In Belgium, where the movement of the war and losses of territory had meant that the Flemish elements of the population were increasingly forming a disproportionate percentage of the army, the language on the memorial headstone gradually became an issue, leading <b>to</b> <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> the creation of heldenhuldezerkjes, headstones inscribed in Flemish, rather than the usual French. In Imperial Russia, the Moscow City Fraternal Cemetery was constructed for the war dead in 1915 by the Imperial royal family and senior Moscow political leaders, who hoped that its inspiring architecture would ensure patriotism in future generations of Russians.|$|E
