5|$|In Texas, the Weather Bureau {{notified}} people {{early enough}} to allow mass evacuations: most coastal residents and camping visitors evacuated <b>the</b> <b>vulnerable</b> islands as the storm neared. Between 60–70% of Port Isabel's 500residents left before the storm, with the remainder sheltering in a sturdy brick store on the highest land available.|$|E
5|$|Many {{fish have}} eyespots near their tails, {{a form of}} automimicry, to {{distract}} attacks away from <b>the</b> <b>vulnerable</b> head and eye. For example, Chaetodon capistratus has both a (disruptive) eyestripe to conceal the eye, and a large eyespot near its tail, giving {{the impression that the}} head is {{at the tail end of}} the body.|$|E
5|$|Over 152 {{species of}} birds are known or {{suspected}} {{to live in the}} Big Butte Creek watershed, including the northern goshawk and the northern spotted owl, a vulnerable species. Bald eagles nest around Willow Lake. Amphibians such as <b>the</b> <b>vulnerable</b> Oregon spotted frog and the near threatened Cascades frog inhabit some regions of the watershed. Black-tailed deer, Roosevelt elk, cougars, and black bears are the most common of the 63 species of mammals found in the watershed. Fishers and American martens have also been spotted. The gray wolf and <b>the</b> <b>vulnerable</b> grizzly bear once lived in the watershed, but are now considered extirpated. Nineteen species of reptiles live in the area. Other sensitive species include the wolverine, the western pond turtle, the sandhill crane, and Townsend's big-eared bat.|$|E
30|$|Regarding the {{sensitivity}} indicators, adult illiteracy rate is {{significantly higher in}} <b>the</b> very highly <b>vulnerable</b> category (13.12  %), and lower in <b>the</b> less <b>vulnerable</b> (4.99  %) and moderately vulnerable (8.75  %) categories. For the remaining categories, the illiteracy rate averages 10.01  %. For crowded households, this proportion is lowest for <b>the</b> less <b>vulnerable</b> category (14.19  %) and is significantly different {{for the rest of}} the vulnerability categories (highly vulnerable 23.33  % and very highly vulnerable, 27.93  %). Population density is significantly larger in <b>the</b> less <b>vulnerable</b> category (180 inhabitants per square km) compared with <b>the</b> very highly <b>vulnerable</b> category. However, there is a high variation where no pattern is identified and confidence intervals overlap across all categories.|$|R

30|$|For the {{adaptive}} capacity indicators {{we find that}} agricultural land tenure (i.e. the proportion of households owning agricultural land with respect to total agricultural land) is not significantly different between <b>the</b> moderately <b>vulnerable</b> to <b>the</b> very highly <b>vulnerable</b> categories. In these groups on average 71  % of farmers own the land where they work. This figure increases to 85  % for <b>the</b> less <b>vulnerable</b> category. There is, however, {{a significant difference between}} the less and very highly vulnerable groups. In addition, for the proportion of the population working in agriculture, silviculture or hunting, 25.53  % work in cantons in <b>the</b> less <b>vulnerable</b> category. This figure increases to 52.35  % in the rest of the vulnerability categories.|$|R

5|$|Although the Thames {{had been}} defended from naval attack since Henry VIII's time, when five blockhouses were built {{as part of}} the Device Forts chain of coastal defences, there were no {{equivalents}} on the Medway. Two medieval castles – Rochester Castle and Queenborough Castle – existed along the river's south bank, but both were intended to defend landward approaches and were of little use for defence. There was thus a pressing need for proper defences to protect <b>the</b> <b>vulnerable</b> ships and shore facilities on the upper Medway.|$|E

5|$|Bacterial {{insecticides}} can {{be effective}} if application is targeted towards <b>the</b> <b>vulnerable</b> early-instar larvae. Two strains of the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis produce toxins which kill the larvae. Other forms of pest control, through non-pesticidal management are available. Feeding can be inhibited by applying antifeedants, such as fungicides or products derived from Neem (Azadirachta indica), but these may have negative effects on the plants as well. The steam distillate of fresh leaves and flowers of tansy (Tanacetum vulgare) contains high levels of camphor and umbellulone and these chemicals are strongly repellent to L. decemlineata.|$|E
5|$|Deforestation {{has also}} caused {{population}} declines for <b>the</b> <b>vulnerable</b> Yunnan and yellow-billed nuthatches. The Yunnan nuthatch can cope with some tree loss, since it prefers open pine woodland, but although still locally common, it has disappeared from {{several of the}} areas in which it was recorded in the early 20th century. The threat to yellow-billed is particularly acute on Hainan, where more than 70% of the woodland has been lost in the past 50 years due to shifting cultivation and the use of wood for fuel during Chinese government re-settlement programmes.|$|E
5|$|Early {{members of}} the ceratopsian group, such as Psittacosaurus, were small bipedal animals. Later members, {{including}} ceratopsids like Centrosaurus and Triceratops, became very large quadrupeds and developed elaborate facial horns and frills extending over the neck. While these frills might have served to protect <b>the</b> <b>vulnerable</b> neck from predators, they {{may also have been}} used for display, thermoregulation, the attachment of large neck and chewing muscles or some combination of the above. Ceratopsians ranged in size from 1meter (3ft) and 23kilograms (50lb) to over 9meters (30ft) and 9,100kg (20,100lb).|$|E

5|$|Heartbleed is a {{security}} bug in the OpenSSL cryptography library, {{which is a}} widely used implementation of the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol. It was introduced into the software in 2012 and publicly disclosed in April 2014. Heartbleed may be exploited regardless of whether <b>the</b> <b>vulnerable</b> OpenSSL instance is running as a TLS server or client. It results from improper input validation (due to a missing bounds check) {{in the implementation of}} the TLS heartbeat extension, thus the bug's name derives from heartbeat. The vulnerability is classified as a buffer over-read, a situation where more data can be read than should be allowed.|$|E

5|$|When Mendizabal ignored Wellington's {{instructions}} {{and failed to}} entrench his army, Soult took advantage of <b>the</b> <b>vulnerable</b> Spanish position and sent a small force to attack the Spaniards. On the morning of 19 February, French forces under Marshal Édouard Mortier quickly defeated the Spanish army, inflicting 1,000 casualties and taking 4,000 prisoners while losing only 400 men. The victory allowed Soult to concentrate on his assault of Badajoz, which fell to the French on 11 March and remained in French hands until the following year.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Civil War between the supporters of Charles I and those of Parliament in 1642, Dartmouth initially sided with Parliament and the town invested money in Kingswear's castle doors. The following year, Prince Maurice besieged and took the town. An earthwork fort, called Mount Ridley or Kingsworth, may subsequently have been built to protect <b>the</b> <b>vulnerable</b> position behind Kingswear Castle; an alternative supposition is that the fort was first built in 1627 and was simply brought back into use during the conflict. In January 1646, Sir Thomas Fairfax led a Parliamentary army to retake Dartmouth, capturing Kingswear from Sir Henry Cary, the High Sheriff of Devon, who had been left in charge of defending it.|$|E
5|$|Hudner begged {{superiors}} {{to allow}} him to return to the wreck to help extract Brown, but he was not allowed, as other officers feared an ambush of <b>the</b> <b>vulnerable</b> helicopters resulting in additional casualties. In order to prevent the body and the aircraft from falling into Chinese or North Korean hands, the U.S. Navy bombed the crash site with napalm two days later, reciting the Lord's Prayer over the radio as they watched Brown's body consumed by flames. The pilots observed that his body looked to have been disturbed and his clothes stolen, but he was still stuck in the aircraft. The remains of both Brown and the aircraft were never recovered. Brown was the first African American U.S. Navy officer killed in the war.|$|E
