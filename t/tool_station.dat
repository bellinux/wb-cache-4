5000|$|Any {{machine tool}} {{with a great}} number of axes, spindles, and <b>tool</b> <b>stations</b> is {{difficult}} to program well manually. It has been done over the years, but not easily. This challenge has existed for decades in CNC screw machine and rotary transfer programming, and it now also arises with today's newer machining centers called [...] "turn-mills", [...] "mill-turns", [...] "multitasking machines", and [...] "multifunction machines". Now that CAD/CAM systems are widely used, CNC programming (such as with G-code) requires CAD/CAM (as opposed to manual programming) to be practical and competitive in the market segments these classes of machines serve. As Smid says, [...] "Combine all these axes with some additional features, and the amount of knowledge required to succeed is quite overwhelming, to say the least." [...] At the same time, however, programmers still must thoroughly understand the principles of manual programming and must think critically and second-guess some aspects of the software's decisions.|$|R

40|$|The {{excavations}} {{and subsequent}} {{analysis of the}} Panther Creek Springs site, 41 BX 228, a multicomponent prehistoric open occupation site in south-central Texas, are documented in this report. The investigations at 41 BX 228 partially mitigate the loss of cultural information caused by looters and potentially by a proposed Soil Conservation Service flood control project. The field investigations carried out in 1979 included mapping, testing, backhoe trenching, and the excavation of several block areas. Large quantities of comparatively well-preserved cultural materials were recovered and analyzed including: lithic, ceramic, and bone artifacts as well as faunal and botanical remains. Major aspects of the analysis and of this report include: descriptive, typological, and distributional studies of certain types of artifacts; the special studies of faunal, botanical, and soil samples; {{a study of the}} burned rock midden phenomena; an examination of the settlement pattern in the upper Salado Creek drainage, and a synthesis emphasizing cultural change and continuity through time in the local cultural manifestations as reflected by the site deposits. The Panther Springs Creek site represents a favored campsite repeatedly revisited over thousands of years by hunting and gathering peoples attracted by the availability of crucial resources, such as water, plants, animals, and lithic materials. The site served many functions including that of: a campsite, a lithic procurement area, a flintknapping <b>station,</b> a <b>tool</b> refitting <b>station,</b> a hunting <b>station,</b> a <b>tool</b> refitting <b>station,</b> a butchering station, a plant processing station, a hunting camp, a gathering camp, and perhaps a social gathering locality. The major problem in interpreting this site is that all of these activities were repeated countless times in an area that had very slow sediment accumulation. Thus, many details of 41 BX 228 ’s long history of prehistoric occupation will never be unraveled...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Plastic bait {{stations}} were trialled {{to assess their}} usefulness as a rabbit control tool. Non-toxic cereal baits were applied at two 171 ha Mackenzie Basin sites, at one site in stations and at the other site spread directly on the ground. Bait-take at each site was measured.

40|$|Growth power {{requirements}} for Space Station Freedom {{will be met}} through addition of 25 kW solar dynamic (SD) power modules. The SD module rejects waste heat from the power conversion cycle to space through a pumped-loop, multi-panel, deployable radiator.

Requirements determined by the overall station design such as mass, system redundancy, micrometeoroid and space debris impact survivability, launch packaging, costs, and thermal and structural interaction with other station components have also been design drivers for the radiator configuration.
