[...] Many species, including mulga, have a very limited ability to resprout after fire, and rely instead on mechanisms of seed production for species survival.

Females were predicted <b>to</b> <b>scarify</b> their breasts and stomachs (due to the stomach being a component of waist-to-hip ratio), both indicative of youthfulness and fertility.

The findings of this research revealed that pathogen prevalence predicts female stomach scarification independent of polygyny, famine, and social class stratification. The relationship between scarification of body parts and pathogen prevalence was not evident for males. These findings, based upon between-society comparisons, suggest that stomach scarification could act as a signal of female mate quality in societies that encounter a high prevalence of pathogens.|$|E

It was established that two of the three viruses isolated from animals asymptomatically infected—namely, strain Chimp- 9 from the chimpanzee and strain 64 - 7255 from the cynomolgus monkeys—although similar to one another differed markedly from the classical Copenhagen strain of monkeypox virus. These two viruses were characterized by the formation of small, monomorphic, well-defined pocks without haemorrhages on infected chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane, by the small plaques of the proliferative type that they produced in cell cultures, by the absence of reactions when they were applied <b>to</b> <b>scarified</b> rabbit skin and the absence of marked necrosis when they were inoculated intradermally into rabbits, by their intensive replication in pig embryo kidney cell cultures, and by a number of other features. It is therefore possible to describe both the viruses as being very close to the variola virus. The Chimp- 9 and 64 - 7255 strains differed from the variola virus only in their greater pathogenicity for white mice after intracerebral inoculation. The other virus isolated from a symptomless cynomolgus monkey—strain 64 - 9411 —resembled the two viruses isolated from monkeys suffering from monkeypox and did not differ from the Copenhagen strain...|$|R

Laboratory germination trails were conducted to identify dormancy mechanisms and to improve germination response. Treatments applied to all species included scarification and scarification followed by soaking seeds in smoke water (1, 5 or 10 %) or gibberellic-acid solution (50, 200 or 1000 muM). Additional treatments with kinetin solution (50, 200 or 1000 muM) and smoke water (50 or 100 %) were applied <b>to</b> <b>scarified</b> or unscarified seeds of C. corymbosa. Thermal-shock treatment was applied to L. nutans fruit, some of which were subsequently <b>scarified</b> and subjected <b>to</b> both smoke water (10 %) and gibberellic-acid solution (1000 muM). Significant germination increases were obtained by using dormancy-breaking treatments on H. commutata (from 12. 8 to 76. 0 %), H. amplexicaulis (from 6. 8 to 55. 1 %) and C. corymbosa (from 48. 5 to 86. 4 %). Scarification alone increased germination of both Hibbertia species, suggesting that these species display a physical seed coat-imposed dormancy mechanism. Germination of H. amplexicaulis was further increased by the application of gibberellic-acid solution, indicating a possible embryo-imposed dormancy mechanism. Scarification followed by the application of smoke water produced the highest germination response for C. corymbosa seeds. Scarification alone did not significantly increase germination, inferring the existence of a smoke-responsive embryo dormancy mechanism.

40|$|Bartonella bacilliformis {{failed to}} induce lesions when merely rubbed {{on the surface}} of the intact skin of a chimpanzee, an ourang-utan, and {{numerous}} Macacus rhesus monkeys, although when applied <b>to</b> the <b>scarified</b> skin of the same animals it gave rise to extensive lesions. Application of infectious material <b>to</b> the <b>scarified</b> skin did not always induce verruga lesions, but intradermal inoculation almost invariably gave rise to nodule formation. The localization of Bartonella bacilliformis in the skin is not, in experimental animals, determined by mechanical factors, since scarification of the skin or intradermal injection of foreign substances in monkeys infected with Bartonella bacilliformis does not give rise to verruga formation. The degree of susceptibility of the skin tissues appears to be considerably diminished during the course of experimental infection with Bartonella bacilliformis. Inoculation of the scarified skin of infected animals gave uniformly negative results, and intradermal inoculation induced only a mild local reaction. In a few exceptional instances, however, of animals previously infected with the strain of Bartonella bacilliformis derived from a human verruga nodule, reinoculation with the same strain gave rise to unusually marked reactions. The evolution of the skin lesion induced in experimental animals by Bartonella bacilliformis may be divided into four stages, the period of incubation, the initial stage, the mature and vascular stage, and the regression. In the initial stage the lesion is a pure angioendothelioma, but in the stage of full development the histological picture is complicated by connective tissue proliferation and occasionally also by penetration of epidermis into the lesion. The demonstration of Bartonella bacilliformis in the endothelial cells distinguishes the lesion from others which simulate it.
