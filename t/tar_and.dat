5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, {{sculptor}} John Connell, in his Raft Project, a collaborative project with painter Eugene Newmann, recreated The Raft of the Medusa by making life-sized sculptures out of wood, paper and <b>tar</b> <b>and</b> placing {{them on a}} large wooden raft.|$|E
5|$|Finally {{the protests}} became an armed {{rebellion}}. The first {{shots were fired}} at the Oliver Miller Homestead in present-day South Park Township, Pennsylvania, about ten miles south of Pittsburgh. As word of the rebellion spread across the frontier, {{a whole series of}} loosely organized resistance measures were taken, including robbing the mail, stopping court proceedings, and the threat of an assault on Pittsburgh. One group disguised as women assaulted a tax collector, cropped his hair, coated him with <b>tar</b> <b>and</b> feathers, and stole his horse. Another group bombarded the estate of the tax collector John Neville, a friend of George Washington.|$|E
5|$|As the 18 fireships {{prepared}} in Britain by Mulgrave {{had not yet}} departed {{by the time of}} Cochrane's arrival with the fleet, the captain responding by converting his own over the following week. A number of chasse-marées carrying <b>tar</b> <b>and</b> resin perfect for this role had been captured by the blockade, and Cochrane requisitioned eight military transport ships from the fleet reserve for conversion using these materials. The frigate-storeship HMS Mediator was taken over to be the centrepiece of the attack force. These vessels were laden with explosives and combustible materials such as rum-soaked hay, and crewed by volunteers from the fleet. On three of the vessels Cochrane had loaded 1,500 barrels of gunpowder, topped by hundreds of artillery shells and thousands of grenades to create an explosion ship, a floating bomb of his own design intended to detonate {{right in the middle of}} the French line. During this process an attack by French boats on the fireships was driven off, with two British sailors killed and one wounded, and on 5 April Cochrane reconnoitered the approaches to Aix Roads, firing shots at the forts and fleet to gauge their responses. He subsequently wrote to Mulgrave suggesting that with an expeditionary force of 20,000 he could seize the defences overlooking the anchorage, sink blockships in the channel and thereby permanently deprive the French of one of their most important naval bases, although his letter was ignored.|$|E

5|$|The Doctor {{explains}} {{that if they}} can find the Isolus pod and provide it power, the alien will leave Chloe. A frantic Chloe draws the TARDIS and the Doctor, trapping them both {{in one of her}} sketches and forcing Rose to try to find the pod herself. She rationalises that the pod is located on the hottest spot on the street, a patch of freshly laid <b>tar,</b> <b>and</b> is able to dig it up. Meanwhile, Chloe has caused the entire crowd at the Olympic stadium to disappear and now is set on making everyone in the world disappear. Rose tries {{to find out how to}} power the pod, and uses visual indications from the Doctor's picture to understand that the pod needs heat mixed with emotion. Rose throws the pod towards the Olympic Torch - a symbol of hope, courage, and love - as it passes down the street. The missing children and the crowd at the Olympics reappear, and Rose realises that the drawing Chloe had made of her father will similarly come to life. Rose and Chloe's mother are able to calm Chloe by singing the Kookaburra song, causing the unseen monster - having fed off of Chloe's emotions and fears - to disappear.|$|E

25|$|The battle {{remained}} a stalemate until a miner from San Miguel de Allende devised {{a way to}} approach the building’s main entrance. This miner, who name was Juan José de los Reyes Martínez, is better known as El Pípila, who had joined the insurgent army as it passed through his hometown. El Pípila’s strapped a large flat stone over his back and carrying a flask of <b>tar</b> <b>and</b> a torch, crawled towards the main entrance. The stone protected him from the bullets fired at him. When he reached the heavy wooden door of the entrance, he smeared it with <b>tar</b> <b>and</b> lit it. This allowed insurgents to then take the building.|$|E

25|$|Creosote {{was first}} {{discovered}} in its wood-tar form in 1832, by Carl Reichenbach, {{when he found}} it both in the <b>tar</b> <b>and</b> in pyroligneous acids obtained by a dry distillation of beechwood. Because pyroligneous acid was known as an antiseptic and meat preservative, Reichenbach conducted experiments by dipping meat in a diluted solution of distilled creosote. He found that the meat was dried without undergoing putrefaction and had attained a smoky flavor. This led him to reason that creosote was the antiseptic component contained in smoke, and he further argued that the creosote he had found in wood tar was also in coal tar, as well as amber <b>tar</b> <b>and</b> animal tar, in the same abundance as in wood tar.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} noted that the <b>tar</b> <b>and</b> chip {{composition}} of secondary roads in Sussex County make them more prone to deterioration than asphalt roadways found in almost {{the rest of the}} state. Among these roads, Sussex (county road) 236 is among the most problematic.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tarring</b> <b>and</b> {{feathering}} {{is a form}} {{of public}} torture and humiliation used to enforce unofficial justice or revenge.

50|$|The {{hydrocarbon}} condensates {{removed in}} the order heavy <b>tars,</b> medium <b>tars</b> <b>and</b> finally light <b>tars</b> <b>and</b> oil fog. About 60-65% of the tars would be deposited in the hydraulic main. Most of this tar was heavy tars. The medium tars condensed out during {{the passage of the}} products between the hydraulic and the condenser. The lighter tars oil fog would travel considerably further.|$|R
