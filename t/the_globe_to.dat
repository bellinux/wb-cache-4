In 1961, the wing deployed to France during the Berlin Crisis. Twenty eight years later, the wing deployed to Panama during Operation Coronet Nighthawk. It also participated in Operation Northern Watch, helping to patrol the No-Fly Zone north of the 36th parallel in Iraq. During the 11 September attacks, the 102d Fighter Wing deployed the first Air Force aircraft toward New York City, but they arrived too late to stop the attacks.|$|E
5|$|Franklin's machine used a {{belt and}} pulley system that could be {{operated}} by one person turning a crank. A large pulley {{was attached to the}} crank-handle, and a much smaller pulley was attached to a large glass globe. An iron axle passed through the globe. This allowed <b>the</b> <b>globe</b> <b>to</b> be rotated at high speed. When the crank was turned, the glass globe rubbed against a leather pad, which generated a large static charge, similar to the electrical charge that could be created by rubbing a glass tube with wool cloth by hand. The machine was unique improvement over others made in Europe at the time, as the glass globe could be spun faster with much less labor. A few revolutions of the handle was all that was needed to charge a Leyden jar.|$|E
5|$|To {{make the}} new game feel refreshing, only certain {{multiplayer}} elements were retained as the small team took {{the game in}} a different direction. They evaluated {{the core of the}} Rainbow Six series, which they thought was about being a member of a counter-terrorist team traveling around <b>the</b> <b>globe</b> <b>to</b> deal with dangerous terrorist attacks â€“ operations which are usually intense confrontations between attackers and defenders. However, the team wanted to fit these ideas into a multiplayer format which would increase the game's sustainability. These became the basic concept ideas for the game. As the development team hoped that the game can be replayed frequently, the team decided to devote all the resources into developing the game's multiplayer and abandoned the single-player campaign.|$|E

5|$|About 23 Ma, in the Pleistocene, {{continental}} ice sheets {{expanded from}} the polar regions of <b>the</b> <b>globe</b> <b>to</b> cover lower latitudes far {{north of the}} region, starting a series of cold glacial periods that were interrupted by warmer interglacial periods. Snowmelt from alpine glaciers on the nearby Sierra Nevada during glacial periods fed rivers that flowed into the valleys of the region year round. Since the topography of the Basin and Range region was largely formed by faulting, not by river erosion, many of the basins have no outlets, meaning they will fill up with water like a bathtub until they overflow into the next basin. So during the cooler and wetter pluvial climates of the glacial periods, much of eastern California, all of Nevada, and western Utah were covered by large lakes separated by linear islands (the present day ranges).|$|E
5|$|Throughout the game, {{the player}} roams Pacific City, {{systematically}} eliminating the leaders and subordinates {{of the three}} gangs. Upon defeating the gangs' Kingpins and generals, the Agent must put down a final riot by the remaining gang members in the area which after completion will cause that city to be almost crime free. Once all three gangs are fully exterminated, in the closing cutscene of the game, the Director reveals to the Agent {{that there was an}} ulterior motive for the Agency's actions: the Agency had secretly empowered the three gangs in the first place to instill fear in Pacific City's residents, thus creating a need for the Agency to control the city, and acceptance in the populace when they did take over. The Agency Director's comments suggest that the Agency will replicate this plan in other cities across <b>the</b> <b>globe</b> <b>to</b> create a New World Order.|$|E
