5|$|According to Peter Freuchen, {{the scene}} in which <b>the</b> <b>wolf</b> attacks Mala is real. Freuchen says that Mala, armed with {{a rock and a}} pistol beneath his fur jacket, spent three afternoons trying to lure a wolf into attacking him. A rifleman and a cinematographer using a camera with a {{telephoto}} lens followed at a distance. <b>The</b> <b>wolf</b> attack was filmed from far away, with the rifleman ready to shoot <b>the</b> <b>wolf</b> in case Mala was unable to kill it. As shown in film, Mala was able to kill <b>the</b> <b>wolf</b> without using his pistol or relying on the rifleman, and was not injured in the attack.|$|E

5|$|The encounter: Once {{the prey}} detects <b>the</b> <b>wolves,</b> it can either {{approach}} <b>the</b> <b>wolves,</b> stand its ground, or flee. Large prey, such as moose, elk, and muskoxen, usually stand their ground. Should this occur, <b>the</b> <b>wolves</b> hold back, as they require the stimulus of a running animal {{to proceed with}} an attack. If the targeted animal stands its ground, <b>the</b> <b>wolves</b> either ignore it, or try to intimidate it into running.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> stalk: <b>The</b> <b>wolves</b> {{attempt to}} conceal {{themselves}} as they approach. As the gap between <b>the</b> <b>wolves</b> and their prey closes, <b>the</b> <b>wolves</b> quicken their pace, wag their tails, and peer intently, getting as close to their quarry as possible without making it flee.|$|R
25|$|In 19th century Russia and Scandinavia, pigs {{were used}} as decoys and were transported in strong canvas sacks on horse-drawn sleighs. The pigs, kept in the canvas bags, were made to squeal {{in order to attract}} <b>the</b> <b>wolves.</b> Hunters would wait at a {{distance}} to shoot <b>the</b> <b>wolves</b> when they came out after the pig. Once <b>the</b> <b>wolves</b> arrived, <b>the</b> hunters would either shoot them or retrieve the pig and canvas bag. In the latter case, they took off down the road, luring <b>the</b> <b>wolves</b> behind. <b>The</b> <b>wolves</b> would be led to a palisade, where they would be trapped and shot.|$|R

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>wolves</b> {{believe that}} {{their way of life}} {{is the only way to}} live, and {{therefore}} they dislike the rabbits. After an earthquake occurs <b>the</b> <b>wolves</b> incriminate <b>the</b> rabbits because [...] "it is well known that rabbits pound on the ground with their hind legs and cause earthquakes". <b>The</b> <b>wolves</b> also blame <b>the</b> rabbits for a lightning strike that kills one of <b>the</b> <b>wolves</b> because [...] "it is well known that lettuce-eaters cause lightning". After <b>the</b> <b>wolves</b> announce plans [...] "to civilize" [...] the rabbits if they don't stop causing natural disasters, the rabbits decide to flee to an island.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>wolf</b> is a {{frequent}} charge in English armory. It is illustrated as a supporter on the shields of Lord Welby, Rendel, and Viscount Wolseley, {{and can be found}} on the coat of arms of Lovett and the vast majority of the Wilsons and Lows. The demi-wolf is a common crest, appearing in the arms and crests of members of many families, including that of the Wolfes, whose crest depicts a demi-wolf holding a crown in its paws, in reference to the assistance the family gave to Charles II during the battle of Worcester. Wolf heads are common in Scottish heraldry, particularly in the coats of Clan Robertson and Skene. <b>The</b> <b>wolf</b> is the most common animal in Spanish heraldry, and is often depicted as carrying a lamb in its mouth, or across its back. <b>The</b> <b>wolf</b> is featured on the flags of the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, the Oneida Nation of Wisconsin and the Pawnee. In modern times, <b>the</b> <b>wolf</b> is widely used as an emblem for military and paramilitary groups. It is the unofficial symbol of the spetsnaz, and serves as the logo of the Turkish Grey Wolves. During the Yugoslav Wars, several Serb paramilitary units adopted <b>the</b> <b>wolf</b> as their symbol, including the White Wolves and the Wolves of Vuƒçjak.|$|E

30|$|In <b>the</b> early stage, <b>wolves</b> tend {{to search}} globally, so <b>the</b> <b>wolves</b> should explore more unknown areas. If <b>the</b> <b>wolves</b> in <b>the</b> region are denser in this area, each <b>wolf</b> in <b>the</b> region is well-adapted, {{and it can}} be {{inclined}} to select some of <b>the</b> poorly adapted <b>wolves</b> among <b>the</b> pack to search in other regions. Because <b>wolves</b> in <b>the</b> area are searching, they can avoid falling into a local optimum. In the later stage, the tendency is to search carefully to find better prey. Therefore, most of <b>the</b> <b>wolves</b> can be concentrated in a certain area for a detailed search. Every time <b>the</b> <b>wolves</b> are updated, <b>the</b> poorly adapted individuals tend to be eliminated.|$|R
5000|$|Annaud {{and others}} visited zoos around China to find wolf pups to acquire for the film. He said, [...] "Wolves in Mongolia are very {{different}} from North American wolves. They are brown with bright eyes. They are more the color of lions." [...] A dozen pups were acquired from a local zoo in Harbin. The filmmakers hired Scottish animal trainer Andrew Simpson to raise and train <b>the</b> <b>wolves,</b> which ultimately numbered 35. Since China has a dwindling <b>wolf</b> population, <b>the</b> government did not allow any wolves to leave. Simpson moved from his ranch in Canada to China to train <b>the</b> <b>wolves</b> to sit, snarl, and fight on cue. Four bases were built in Inner Mongolia and in Beijing for raising and training <b>the</b> <b>wolves.</b> <b>The</b> <b>wolves</b> were trained for over four years {{to be used in the}} film. Training revolved around feeding <b>the</b> <b>wolves.</b> They had a diet of dried dog food and chopped chicken, but during training, Simpson fed them [...] "ruby red cubes" [...] of fresh meat. <b>The</b> <b>wolves</b> were kept under control behind long, double fences and were trained not to avoid the cameras. During filming, the crew permitted <b>the</b> <b>wolves</b> to rest every hour. Despite precautions, actor Feng Shaofeng was injured by a wolf. While Annaud filmed live footage of <b>the</b> <b>wolves,</b> he plans to use technology in post-production to create scenes that would normally be impossible to film. After filming, <b>the</b> <b>wolves</b> were ultimately relocated to Canada since they only understood commands in English.|$|R

25|$|<b>The</b> {{removal of}} <b>wolves</b> and <b>the</b> grizzly bear in California may have greatly reduced the {{abundance}} of the endangered San Joaquin Kit Fox. With the reintroduction of gray wolves to Yellowstone, many visitors have witnessed a once common struggle between a keystone species, the grizzly bear, and its historic rival, <b>the</b> gray <b>wolf.</b> <b>The</b> interactions of grizzly bears with <b>the</b> <b>wolves</b> of Yellowstone have been under considerable study. Typically, the conflict {{will be in the}} defense of young or over a carcass, which is commonly an elk killed by <b>wolves.</b> <b>The</b> grizzly bear uses its keen sense of smell to locate the kill. As <b>the</b> <b>wolves</b> and grizzly compete for <b>the</b> kill, one <b>wolf</b> may try to distract the bear while the others feed. The bear then may retaliate by chasing <b>the</b> <b>wolves.</b> If <b>the</b> <b>wolves</b> become aggressive with the bear, it is normally in the form of quick nips at its hind legs. Thus, the bear will sit down and use its ability to protect itself in a full circle. Rarely do interactions such as these end in death or serious injury to either animal. One carcass simply is not usually worth the risk to <b>the</b> <b>wolves</b> (if <b>the</b> bear has the upper hand due to strength and size) or to the bear (if <b>the</b> <b>wolves</b> are too numerous or persistent). While wolves usually dominate grizzly bears during interactions at wolf dens, both grizzly and black bears have been reported killing wolves and their cubs at wolf dens even when the latter was in defense mode.|$|R
