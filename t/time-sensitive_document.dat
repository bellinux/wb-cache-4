50|$|Much of the heliport's {{traffic is}} {{generated}} by Wall Street and the lower Manhattan financial district; top business executives and <b>time-sensitive</b> <b>document</b> deliveries often use the heliport. The heliport is also the normal landing spot for the President of the United States on visits to New York. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg frequently used the heliport to fly between Bloomberg L.P. headquarters and Johns Hopkins University when {{he was chairman of}} both institutions.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In many applications, {{large volumes}} of {{time-sensitive}} textual information require triage: rapid, approximate prioritization for subsequent action. In this paper, we explore the use of prospective indications {{of the importance of}} a <b>time-sensitive</b> <b>document,</b> for the purpose of producing better document filtering or ranking. By prospective, we mean importance that could be assessed by actions that occur in the future. For example, a news story may be assessed (retrospectively) as being important, based on events that occurred after the story appeared, such as a stock-price plummeting or the issuance of many follow-up stories. If a system could anticipate (prospectively) such occurrences, it could provide a timely indication of importance. Clearly, perfect prescience is impossible. However, sometimes there is sufficient correlation between the content of an information item and the events that occur subsequently. We describe a process for creating and evaluating approximate information-triage procedures that are based on prospective indications. Unlike many information-retrieval applications for which document labeling is a laborious, manual process, for many prospective criteria it is possible to build very large, labeled, training corpora automatically. Such corpora can be used to train text classification procedures that will predict the (prospective) importance of each document. This paper illustrates the process with two case studies, demonstrating the ability to predict whether the stock price of one or more companies mentioned in a news story will move significantly following the appearance of that story. We conclude by discussing that the comprehensibility of the learned classifiers can be critical to success. ...|$|E

He did this by purchasing tickets for airline passengers who could take 350 pounds of accompanied baggage, and sending the Matson shipping documents with them.

5000|$|A {{tickler file}} or 43 Folders System is a {{collection}} of date-labeled file folders organized in a way that allows <b>time-sensitive</b> <b>documents</b> to be filed according to the future date on which each document needs action. Documents within the folders of a tickler file can be to-do lists, pending bills, unpaid invoices, travel tickets, hotel reservations, meeting information, birthday reminders, coupons, claim tickets, call-back notes, follow-up reminders, maintenance reminders, or any other papers that require future action. Each day, the folder having the current date is retrieved from the tickler file so that any documents within it may be acted on. Essentially, a tickler file provides a way to send a reminder to oneself in the future - [...] "tickling" [...] one's memory.|$|R

40|$|Using newswire {{data sources}} from the TREC corpus, weshow that the {{distribution}} of relevant documents with respect to time can be decidely non-uniform. Many TREC topics show timebased clustering of relevant documents. We denote this clustering content locality and provide a simple metric for its measurement in time-ordered document collections. There is a marked positive correlation between content locality measurements from two time-sychronized data sources. Given this correlation, weshow that knowledge of {{the distribution of}} contentlocality in one document source can provide modest improvement in retrieval results in a companion, time-synchronized document source. While this data is preliminary, it illustrates the potential of using time as an additional feature in retrieval. 1 Introduction The widespread proliferation of on-line newspapers and other <b>time-sensitive</b> or time-ordered <b>document</b> archives has provided the capability for archival searches to a much larger audience than ever [...] ...|$|R
