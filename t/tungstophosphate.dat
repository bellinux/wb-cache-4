Potassium and cesium salts of tungstophosphoric acid were prepared by precipitation method. For sake of comparison HPW, potassium and cesium <b>tungstophosphates</b> were supported on silica (20 wt%) by wet impregnation method. The catalysts were characterized by XRD, nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurements at 77 K, and the catalytic activity has been studied by using the catalytic conversion of tert-butanol at temperatures between 323 and 423 K. The results revealed {{that all of the}} catalysts were active and selective towards dehydration of tert-butanol yielding isobutene with low amount of isooctene as result of oligomerization process. Substitution of one proton of HPW by cesium or potas-sium cation exerted no measurable effect on the catalytic activity. The conversion over unsupported catalysts increased by increasing the cation content per Keggin unit of x ≥ 2. Supporting the previous salts on SiO 2 resulted in a significant decrease in the catalytic activity upon increasing cation content. Activation energy was calculated for different solids...|$|R

Upon reﬂux in aqueous solution, they partially transform into [{PW 11 O 39 Ru(h 6 -arene) } 2 {WO 2 }] 8 - (when arene = benzene, toluene...) and [a-PW 11 O 39 {Ru(DMSO) }] 5 -, respectively. In the former case, the conversion is markedly increased by deliberate addition of tungstate: through a solution NMR study, we show that [{PW 11 O 39 Ru(h 6 -p-cymene) } 2 {WO 2 }] 8 - is quantitatively obtained by reﬂuxing a 2 : 1 : 2 mixture of [a-PW 11 O 39] 7 -, [Ru(h 6 -p-cymene) Cl 2] 2 and [WO 4] 2 - at pH 3.

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis highlights the influence of water soluble tertiary amines in the synthesis of transition metal substituted heteropolyoxometalates (TMSPs), with particular emphasis on polyanions based on the Keggin structure and lacunary derivatives thereof. In particular, an understanding is gained into the role that N,N’-bis(2 -hydroxyethyl) piperazine (bhep) and morpholine (morph) play in the polyanion self-assembly process, with the successful isolation of molecular species, chains, layers and three dimensional frameworks. Each of the ligands were used in two different sets of synthetic investigation to probe their influence on the complete self-assembly of transition metal substituted <b>tungstophosphates</b> using Na 2 WO 4 as the tungstate source, and by using the [XW 10 O 36] 8 - X = Si, Ge precursors. Indeed, at no point in this work has the same polyanion been isolated using both the bhep and morpholine ligands, with this observation being indicative of each ligand having structure directing properties. Synthesis of TMSPs based on the phosphotungstate clusters {{in the presence of}} (bhep) has resulted in the isolation of clusters with nuclearities W 6, W 7, W 9, W 10, and W 11 which were only possible through fine control of the reaction pH which is aided by the ligands high buffer capacity. Additionally, in these compounds the ligand is observed to adopt a variety of coordination tendencies ranging from monodentate coordination through the ligands hydroxyl groups to chelation between nitrogen and oxygen donors. Specifically, the chelation of the ligand to CoII and NiII ions has allowed the rare inclusion of transition metal complexes into lacunary polyanions through a complimentary self-assembly process. Furthermore, the (bhep) ligand has been used to directly functionalise the [γ-SiW 10 O 36] 8 - polyanion through the controlled formation of W-OC linkages via a dehydration process. Interactions of the Morpholine ligand with heteropolytungsate clusters and transition metals in aqueous solution results in an array of markedly different structural motifs, which are highly depedant on the synthetic approach. The high basicity of the morpholine ligand results in its function as a buffer and cation within a pH domain that is underdeveloped in TMSP chemistry. Consequently, novel molecular species and functional materials have been isolated through the exploitation of this knowledge. The most significant of all the findings is the isolation of five mesoporous frameworks, which are composed solely of manganese or cobalt substituted Keggin polyanions which act as trigonal and tetrahedral nodes in the purely inorganic frameworks. Furthermore, the manganese containing frameworks have been shown to have cation exchange properties and are also redox active with single-crystal to single-crystal transformations being observed. ...|$|R

30|$|Zirconium-based ion {{exchangers}} have received attention {{because of their}} excellent ion exchange behavior and some important chemical applications {{in the field of}} ion exchanger, ion exchange membrane, and solid state electrochemistry. Accordingly, various hetero-polyacid salts based on zirconium (IV) {{have been reported in the}} literature as cation exchange materials. Among these hetero-polyacid salts, zirconium tungesto-vanadate nanoparticles as novel material establish its effectiveness for cationic ions decontamination [6]. This novel material has been studied for its synthesis, ion exchange behavior, and analytical applications. This novel material explored higher ion exchange capacity and higher stability at elevated temperature compared with the other previously prepared zirconium-based hetero-polyacid cation exchange material such as zirconium tungstatephenolate, zirconium <b>tungstophosphate,</b> zirconium arsenovanadate, and zirconium iodovanadate [7]. Preparations of both poorly crystalline and amorphous nano-zirconium tungesto-vanadate materials in spherical particles morphological structures have been reported earlier [6]. However, the production of crystalline zirconium tungesto-vanadate material with other morphological structure rather than the spherical nanoparticles was not investigated at the literature.|$|E
40|$|The {{photocurrent}} at the polarized water/ 1, 2 -dichloroethane (DCE) interface {{was successfully}} {{observed in the}} presence of a lipophilic sensitizer, 5, 10, 15, 20 -tetraphenylporphyrinato zinc (ZnTPP), in the organic phase. The photocurrent transient responses were apparently affected by the employed organic supporting electrolyte: tetrapenthylammonium tetraphenylborate (TPnATPB) or tris(tetraoctylammonium) <b>tungstophosphate</b> ((TOcA) (3) PW 12 O 40). The photocurrent measured in the TPnATPB system exhibited rather slow responses associated with the ion transfer of photoproducts. On the other hand, the photoinduced heterogeneous electron transfer could be observed in the use of (TOcA) (3) PW 12 O 40. The photocurrent intensity in the (TOcA) (3) PW 12 O 40 system exhibited an apparent pH dependence and the photoreduction of hydrogen ions probably took place at the water/DCE interface. By analyzing the real and imaginary components of the photocurrent depending on the photoexcitation frequency, we roughly estimated the phenomenological rate constants of the product separation (k(ps)) and recombination (k(rec)) processes as log(k(ps) /s(- 1)) = 1. 5 ± 0. 2 and log(k(rec) /s(- 1)) = 1. 8 ± 0. 1, respectively...|$|E

The experimental results showed that at H 2 O 2 /cyclooctane molar ratio = 3 at 80 °C, in 9 h the [Co]CoW yielded higher conversion and selectivity to cyclooctanone. The V-based catalysts are more active than the Co-based <b>tungstophosphate.</b> The PV 2 W gave rise to high selectivity to cyclooctyl hydroperoxide. Cyclooctane conversion was increased by increasing reaction time or H 2 O 2 /cyclooctane molar ratio.

In case of ZrWP, the membrane having the composition; Zirconium(IV) tugstophosphate (40 %) and epoxy resin (60 %) exhibits best performance.

During melting, a redox reaction takes place between Sn 2 + and Mo 6 + generating the crystallization of a Na(SnIV,MoIV) (PO 4) 3 solid solution with a NZP (NaZr 2 P 3 O 12) type structure. Such reactivity was not underlined {{in the case of the}} W-series. All the samples were characterized from a thermal and mechanical point of view as a function of the RO 3 (R = Mo, W) for SnO substitution. Two types of behaviors were identified. For the Mo-series, all the characteristics, except density, present an extremum value for the chemical composition with a 1 : 1 SnO-MoO 3 molar ratio. This is strongly correlated to the amount of NZP crystals present in the glass ceramic, the different behavior observed for the density being due to the low compactness of the NZP phase. For the W-series, all these different characteristics varies monotonously according to a progressive strengthening of the network by replacement of a low field strength ion (Sn 2 +) by a higher field strength ion (W 6 +). In addition, the solid state reactivity of a 1 : 1 SnO-RO 3 mixture was examined confirming the absence of any redox process between SnO and WO 3 during the glass synthesis...|$|E
40|$|The work {{presented}} herein {{covers a}} broad range of polyoxometalate (POM) chemistry, exploring a variety of addenda, template and heterometal species as part of a fundamental study into the development of new POM ‘building blocks’. Whilst the isolation of new POM species capable of serving as platforms for the realisation of new functional materials remains a key goal, a clear gap in our existing knowledge of the processes by which these species assemble in solution has been identified as a significant obstacle to continued progress in the field. A firm emphasis is thus placed on understanding, either by careful empirical observation or direct analytical measurement, the route by which these clusters form and transform under the conditions in which they are synthesised. The synthesis and characterisation of a new class of lacunary, lanthanide substituted [LnV 12 O 32 (Cl) ] 2 - polyoxovanadate clusters is reported by employing a previously unknown coordination driven structural rearrangement. The electrochemical, magnetic and photoredox properties of these cage type clusters is studied and their use as the first ever lacunary oxovanadium building blocks is demonstrated in the one pot and stepwise syntheses of di substituted Gd 2 V 12 and GdErV 12 species, respectively. The template effect of lone pair containing pyramidal heteroatoms has emerged recently as a powerful new strategy to isolate complex, self assembled POM clusters though this primarily one pot strategy currently suffers from a lack of a coherent and rational synthetic approach. Efforts to synthesise a series of five new POM clusters, each related by the same transient Se 2 W 12 building block are presented and a comparative study is presented between these new species and their known <b>tungstophosphate</b> analogues. A similar approach is also employed to isolate the highest nuclearity Pd substituted POM clusters reported thus far and this system is found to contain an unusual example of POM isomerism over the nanoscale. Lastly, mass spectrometric techniques have been explored as an analytical tool with unparalleled resolving power for the real time study of the in situ speciation, assembly and formation of TMSP species. In this way, it has been possible {{for the first time to}} elucidate direct mechanistic information relevant to the formation of a series of complex Fe substituted POM species. Further to this, ion mobility spectrometry – mass spectrometry (IMS MS) has been used detect the supramolecular aggregation of azobenzene functionalised hybrid POMs and to quantitatively detect the extent of any photoisomerisation induced structural response in the gas phase...|$|E
