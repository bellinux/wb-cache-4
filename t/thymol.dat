5|$|Terpenes and terpenoids of {{many kinds}} {{are found in}} a variety of {{medicinal}} plants, and in resinous plants such as the conifers. They are strongly aromatic and serve to repel herbivores. Their scent makes them useful in essential oils, whether for perfumes such as rose and lavender, or for aromatherapy. Some have medicinal uses: for example, <b>thymol</b> is an antiseptic and was once used as a vermifuge (anti-worm medicine).|$|E
25|$|Gundelia {{contains}} several essential oils, {{with large}} proportions (20-25% each) of <b>thymol</b> and germacrene-D.|$|E
25|$|Mouthwashes with {{essential}} oils are also useful. For example, American Dental Association approved plaque reducers and anti-inflammatory agents such as <b>thymol,</b> menthol, eucalyptol, and methyl salicylate are originally derived from thyme, mint, eucalyptus, and willow, respectively.|$|E
25|$|Early {{treatment}} {{relied on}} the use of Epsom salt to reduce protective mucus, followed by <b>thymol</b> to kill the worms. Later tetrachloroethylene was the leading method. It was not until later in the mid-20th century when new organic drug compounds were developed.|$|E
25|$|Another {{commercial}} {{process is}} the Haarmann-Reimer process. This process starts from m-cresol which is alkylated with propene to <b>thymol.</b> This compound is hydrogenated in the next step. Racemic menthol is isolated by fractional distillation. The enantiomers are separated by chiral resolution in reaction with methyl benzoate, selective crystallisation followed by hydrolysis.|$|E
25|$|It {{is known}} that <b>thymol,</b> a {{compound}} produced by thyme, naturally occurring in thyme honey, and likely inert in human tissue, is a treatment for the Varroa. Provisioning active colonies with crops of thyme may provide the colony with a non-interventional chemical defense against Varroa. Research suggests thyme honey, given the therapeutic properties of thyme compounds and the properties of honey, may be a compound not dissimilar from aspirin.|$|E
25|$|Epazote {{essential}} oil contains ascaridole (up to 70%), limonene, p-cymene, and smaller amounts of numerous other monoterpenes and monoterpene derivatives (α-pinene, myrcene, terpinene, <b>thymol,</b> camphor and trans-isocarveol). Ascaridole (1,4-peroxido-p-menth-2-ene) is rather an uncommon constituent of spices; another plant owing {{much of its}} character to this monoterpene peroxide is boldo. Ascaridole is toxic and has a pungent, not very pleasant flavor; in pure form, it is an explosive sensitive to shock. Ascaridole content is lower in epazote from Mexico than in epazote grown in Europe or Asia.|$|E
2500|$|Friedel–Crafts {{reactions}} {{have been}} used in the synthesis of several triarylmethane and xanthene dyes. Examples are the synthesis of thymolphthalein (a pH indicator) from two equivalents of <b>thymol</b> and phthalic anhydride: ...|$|E
2500|$|Several {{indicators}} share {{a similar}} structure to phenol red, including bromothymol blue, <b>thymol</b> blue, bromocresol purple, thymolphthalein, and phenolphthalein. (A table of other common chemical indicators {{is available in}} the article on pH indicators.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The active {{ingredients}} {{approved by the}} American Dental Association that [...] "reduce plaque and demonstrate effective reduction of gingival inflammation {{over a period of}} time" [...] are triclosan, chlorhexidine digluconate, and a combination of <b>thymol,</b> menthol, eucalyptol, and methyl salicylate. These ingredients are found in toothpaste and mouthwash. Hydrogen peroxide was long considered a suitable over-the-counter agent to treat gingivitis. There has been evidence to show the positive effect on controlling gingivitis in short-term use. A study indicates the fluoridated hydrogen peroxide-based mouth rinse can remove teeth stain and reduce gingivitis.|$|E
2500|$|Common {{chemical}} controls include [...] "hard" [...] chemicals such as Amitraz (marketed as Apivar [...] ), fluvalinate (marketed as Apistan), and coumaphos (marketed as CheckMite). [...] "Soft" [...] chemical controls include <b>thymol</b> (marketed as ApiLife-VAR and Apiguard), sucrose octanoate esters (marketed as Sucrocide), {{oxalic acid}} and formic acid (sold in gel packs as Mite-Away, but {{also used in}} other formulations). [...] According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, when used in beehives as directed, these treatments kill {{a large proportion of}} the mites while not substantially disrupting bee behavior or life span. [...] Use of chemical controls is generally regulated and varies from country to country. [...] With few exceptions, they are not intended for use during production of marketable honey.|$|E
2500|$|Mucor plumbeus colonies {{grown in}} culture {{were found to}} develop in the {{presence}} of ammonium chloride, L-histidine and urea, suggesting that these compounds are utilised as a nitrogen source. Mucor plumbeus can also use sucrose, D-mannose, D-sorbitol and citric acid as sources of carbon. Zygospores were found to be unable to grow in culture. Mucor plumbeus is capable of growing from [...] to [...] The optimal temperature range for growth and sporulation to occur at was found to be [...] It does not grow at [...] Primary growth of M. plumbeus was found to be greatly suppressed by garlic extract in in-vivo growth studies. Sporulation can be suppressed by rubratoxin B. Mucor plumbeus can cause self inhibition of its germinating spores with the production of certain factors such as nonanoic acid. In a study conducted to determine the antifungal capabilities of different mixtures of cinnamon and clove oil against various important spoilage microorganisms, M. plumbeus was discovered to be amongst the most resistant organisms. This study also revealed that <b>thymol</b> has effective inhibitory action against M. plumbeus. In nature, M. plumbeus can be found in soils with a wide range in pH - particularly into the alkaline range. The minimum water activity (aw) for growth was reported to be 0.93. The growth of M. plumbeus varied with different gas concentrations. Growth in N was 80% of that in air. Growth also occurred in an atmosphere of more than 97% CO with trace amounts of O. Growth on cheddar cheese in an atmosphere of: 20% CO and 5% O was 50% of that in air; 20% CO and 1% O was 40% of that in air; 40% CO and 5% O was 50% of that in air; 40% CO and 1% O was 30% [...] of that in air.|$|E
50|$|Another {{example of}} the {{medicinal}} value of essential oils is <b>thymol,</b> isomeric with carvacrol and found in oil of the common spice thyme. <b>Thymol</b> {{is part of a}} naturally occurring class of compounds known as biocides, with strong antimicrobial attributes when used alone or with other biocides such as carvacrol. In addition, naturally occurring biocidal agents such as <b>thymol</b> can reduce bacterial resistance to common drugs such as penicillin. Numerous studies have demonstrated the antimicrobial effects of <b>thymol,</b> ranging from inducing antibiotic susceptibility in drug-resistant pathogens to powerful antioxidant properties. Research demonstrates that <b>thymol</b> and carvacrol reduce bacterial resistance to antibiotics through a synergistic effect, and <b>thymol</b> {{has been shown to be}} an effective fungicide, particularly against fluconazole-resistant strains. Carvacrol and <b>thymol</b> have been demonstrated to have a strong antimutagenic effect. In addition, there is evidence that <b>thymol</b> has antitumor properties. Though the exact mechanism is unknown, some evidence suggests <b>thymol</b> effects at least some of its biocidal properties by membrane disruption. <b>Thymol</b> has been shown to act as a positive allosteric modulator of GABAA in vitro.|$|E
