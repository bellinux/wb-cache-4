5|$|The okapi can {{be easily}} {{distinguished}} from its nearest extant relative, <b>the</b> <b>giraffe.</b> It is much smaller and shares more external similarities with the deer and bovids than with <b>the</b> <b>giraffe.</b> While both sexes possess horns in <b>the</b> <b>giraffe,</b> only males bear horns in the okapi. The okapi has large palatine sinuses, unique among the giraffids. Morphological similarities shared between <b>the</b> <b>giraffe</b> and the okapi include a similar gait – both use a pacing gait, stepping simultaneously with the front and the hind leg {{on the same side}} of the body, unlike other ungulates that walk by moving alternate legs on either side of the body - and a long black tongue (longer in the okapi) useful in plucking buds and leaves as well as for grooming.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>giraffe</b> {{was also}} {{known to the}} Greeks and Romans, who {{believed}} that it was an unnatural hybrid of a camel and a leopard and called it camelopardalis. <b>The</b> <b>giraffe</b> was among the many animals collected and displayed by the Romans. The first one in Rome was brought in by Julius Caesar in 46 BC and exhibited to the public. With the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the housing of giraffes in Europe declined. During the Middle Ages, giraffes were known to Europeans through contact with the Arabs, who revered <b>the</b> <b>giraffe</b> for its peculiar appearance.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} show the {{differences}} between communication styles, Rosenberg started to use two animals. Violent communication was represented by the carnivorous Jackal {{as a symbol of}} aggression and especially dominance. The herbivorous Giraffe on the other hand, represented his NVC strategy. <b>The</b> <b>Giraffe</b> was chosen as symbol for NVC as its long neck is supposed to show the clear-sighted speaker, being aware of his fellow speakers' reactions; and because <b>the</b> <b>Giraffe</b> has a large heart, representing the compassionate side of NVC. In his courses he tended to use these animals {{in order to make the}} differences in communication clearer to the audience.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>giraffe</b> genome {{is around}} 2.9 billion base pairs in length {{compared}} to the 3.3 billion base pairs of the okapi. Of the proteins in giraffe and okapi genes, 19.4% are identical. The two species are equally distantly related to cattle, suggesting the giraffe's unique characteristics are not because of faster evolution. The divergence of giraffe and okapi lineages dates to around 11.5 mya. A small group of regulatory genes in <b>the</b> <b>giraffe</b> appear {{to be responsible for}} the animal's stature and associated circulatory adaptations.|$|E
5|$|During the wet season, food is {{abundant}} and giraffes are more spread out, while {{during the dry}} season, they gather around the remaining evergreen trees and bushes. Mothers tend to feed in open areas, presumably {{to make it easier}} to detect predators, although this may reduce their feeding efficiency. As a ruminant, <b>the</b> <b>giraffe</b> first chews its food, then swallows it for processing and then visibly passes the half-digested cud up the neck and back into the mouth to chew again. It is common for a giraffe to salivate while feeding. <b>The</b> <b>giraffe</b> requires less food than many other herbivores because the foliage it eats has more concentrated nutrients and it has a more efficient digestive system. The animal's faeces come in the form of small pellets. When it has access to water, a giraffe drinks at intervals no longer than three days.|$|E

5000|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{origins of}} <b>the</b> <b>giraffe's</b> (Giraffa camelopardalis) long neck are controversial. The long-accepted [...] "competing browser's hypothesis" [...] originally {{put forth by}} Charles Darwin has been put into question. Originally, scientists believed that the elongation of <b>the</b> <b>giraffe's</b> neck had been a result of natural selection acting in relation to foraging behaviour, where it was supposed that longer necks enabled favoured individuals to gather food inaccessible to other animals. But even though <b>the</b> <b>giraffe’s</b> overall height is about 6 meters, it still typically feeds at about 2 meters above the ground. Moreover, <b>the</b> <b>giraffe's</b> kudu, impala, and steenbok competitors do not feed above 2 meters and prefer feeding at shoulder level as well, {{rather than at the}} maximum height they could reach.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>giraffe</b> (Giraffa) is a genus of African even-toed {{ungulate}} mammals, the tallest living terrestrial {{animals and the}} largest ruminants. The genus currently consists of one species, Giraffa camelopardalis, the type species. Seven other species are extinct, prehistoric species known from fossils. Taxonomic classifications of one to eight extant giraffe species have been described, based upon research into the mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, as well as morphological measurements of Giraffa, but the IUCN currently recognizes only one species with nine subspecies.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>giraffe</b> {{is one of}} {{only two}} living genera of the family Giraffidae in the order Artiodactyla, the other being the okapi. The family was once much more extensive, with over 10 fossil genera described. Their closest known {{relatives}} are the extinct deer-like climacocerids. They, together with the family Antilocapridae (whose only extant species is the pronghorn), belong to the superfamily Giraffoidea. These animals may have evolved from the extinct family Palaeomerycidae which might also have been the ancestor of deer.|$|E

5|$|At first glance, dazzle {{seems an}} {{unlikely}} form of camouflage, {{drawing attention to}} the ship rather than hiding it. The approach was developed after Allied navies were unable to develop effective means to hide ships in all weather conditions. The British zoologist John Graham Kerr proposed the application of camouflage to British warships in the First World War, outlining what he {{believed to be the}} applicable principle, disruptive camouflage, in a letter to Winston Churchill in 1914 explaining the goal was to confuse, not to conceal, by disrupting a ship's outline. Kerr compared the effect to that created by the patterns on a series of land animals, <b>the</b> <b>giraffe,</b> zebra and jaguar.|$|E

5|$|The {{elongation}} of {{the neck}} appears to have started early in <b>the</b> <b>giraffe</b> lineage. Comparisons between giraffes and their ancient relatives suggest that vertebrae close to the skull lengthened earlier, followed by lengthening of vertebrae further down. One early giraffid ancestor was Canthumeryx which has been dated variously to have lived 25–20 million years ago (mya), 17–15mya or 18–14.3mya and whose deposits {{have been found in}} Libya. This animal was medium-sized, slender and antelope-like. Giraffokeryx appeared 15mya in the Indian subcontinent and resembled an okapi or a small giraffe, and had a longer neck and similar ossicones. Giraffokeryx may have shared a clade with more massively built giraffids like Sivatherium and Bramatherium.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>giraffe</b> has {{intrigued}} various cultures, both {{ancient and}} modern, for its peculiar appearance, and {{has often been}} featured in paintings, books, and cartoons. It is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as Vulnerable to extinction, and has been extirpated from many parts of its former range. The UN backed Convention of Migratory Species selected giraffes for protection in 2017. Giraffes are still found in numerous national parks and game reserves but estimations as of 2016 indicate that there are approximately 97,500 members of Giraffa in the wild, with around 1,144 in captivity.|$|E
5|$|Roughly spherical eggs of {{different}} animals {{give rise to}} extremely different bodies, from jellyfish to lobsters, butterflies to elephants. Many of these organisms share the same structural genes for bodybuilding proteins like collagen and enzymes, but biologists had expected that each group of animals would have its own rules of development. The surprise of evo-devo is that the shaping of bodies is controlled by a rather small percentage of genes, and that these regulatory genes are ancient, shared by all animals. <b>The</b> <b>giraffe</b> {{does not have a}} gene for a long neck, any more than the elephant has a gene for a big body. Their bodies are patterned by a system of switching which causes development {{of different}} features to begin earlier or later, to occur in this or that part of the embryo, and to continue for more or less time.|$|E

5|$|With time, {{the idea}} that the differing skulls might be {{representative}} of individual variation within one (or two) species gained popularity. In 1986, Ostrom and Wellnhofer published a paper in which they proposed that there was only one species, Triceratops horridus. Part of their rationale was that generally there are only one or two species of any large animal in a region (modern examples being the elephant and <b>the</b> <b>giraffe</b> in modern Africa). To their findings, Lehman added the old Lull-Sternberg lineages combined with maturity and sexual dimorphism, suggesting that the T. horridus-T. prorsus-T. brevicornus lineage was composed of females, the T.calicornis-T.elatus lineage was made up of males, and the T. obtusus-T. hatcheri lineage was of pathologic old males. His reasoning was that males had taller, more erect horns and larger skulls, and females had smaller skulls with shorter, forward-facing horns.|$|E
5|$|Giraffes were {{probably}} common targets for hunters throughout Africa. Different {{parts of their}} bodies were used for different purposes. Their meat was used for food. The tail hairs served as flyswatters, bracelets, necklaces and thread. Shields, sandals and drums were made using the skin, and the strings of musical instruments were from the tendons. The smoke from burning giraffe skins {{was used by the}} medicine men of Buganda to treat nose bleeds. The Humr people of Sudan consume the drink Umm Nyolokh; which is created from the liver and marrow of giraffes. Umm Nyolokh often contains DMT and other psychoactive substances from plants the giraffes eat such as Acacia; and is known to cause hallucinations of giraffes, believed to be the giraffes' ghosts by the Humr. In the 19th century, European explorers began to hunt them for sport. Habitat destruction has hurt <b>the</b> <b>giraffe,</b> too: in the Sahel, the need for firewood and grazing room for livestock has led to deforestation. Normally, giraffes can coexist with livestock, since they do not directly compete with them.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, Snively and Jessica M. Theodor {{conducted}} a {{finite element analysis}} by simulating head-impacts with CT scanned skulls of S. validum (UALVP 2), Prenocephale prenes and several extant head-butting artiodactyls. They found that the correlations between head-striking and skull morphologies found in the living animals also existed in the studied pachycephalosaurs. Stegoceras and Prenocephale both had skull shapes similar to the bighorn sheep with cancellous bone protecting the brain. They also shared similarities {{in the distribution of}} compact and cancellous regions with the bighorn sheep, white-bellied duiker and <b>the</b> <b>giraffe.</b> The white-bellied duiker was found to be the closest morphological analogue to Stegoceras; this head-butting species has a dome which is smaller but similarly rounded. Stegoceras was better capable of dissipating force than artiodactyls that butt heads at high forces, but the less vascularized domes of older pachycephalosaurs, and possibly diminished ability to heal from injuries, argued against such combat in older individuals. The study also tested the effects of a keratinous covering of the dome, and found it to aid in performance. Though Stegoceras lacked the pneumatic sinuses that are found below the point of impact in the skulls of head-striking artiodactyls, it instead had vascular struts which could have similarly acted as braces, as well as conduits to feed the development of a keratin covering.|$|E
