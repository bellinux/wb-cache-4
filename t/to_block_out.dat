5|$|Sunglasses: The first {{sunglasses}} {{were invented}} in 12th century China when medieval Chinese magistrates wore smoke-colored lenses to conceal {{their eyes and}} feelings during trials while questioning the witnesses and accused. They were a crude slab of smoked quartz that was made <b>to</b> <b>block</b> <b>out</b> {{the light from the}} sun.|$|E
5|$|Erik (now Magneto) obtains his {{signature}} helmet <b>to</b> <b>block</b> <b>out</b> Xavier’s psychic powers, and secretly takes {{control of the}} constructed Sentinels. Professor X abandons the serum, regaining his mutant power, and communicates with his future self, who inspires him to protect the relationship between mutants and mankind. After using Cerebro to track Mystique, he, Hank and Wolverine take flight to Washington, DC {{and put an end}} to her assassination plot on Bolivar Trask.|$|E
5|$|In shots {{where there}} was no {{perspective}} change, still shots of the models were photographed and positive paper prints were made. The image of the model was cut out of the photographic print and mounted on glass and filmed on an animation stand. The undeveloped film was re-wound to film the star background with the silhouette of the model photograph acting as a matte <b>to</b> <b>block</b> <b>out</b> where the spaceship image was.|$|E
25|$|Vines, {{especially}} wild grapevines, {{are known}} to be extremely damaging to young trees of this species. Vines are damaging both due <b>to</b> <b>blocking</b> <b>out</b> solar radiation, and increasing weight on limbs which can lead to bending of the trunk and/or breaking of limbs.|$|R

5|$|Behind {{the central}} {{images of the}} lunatic, daemon and gambler are {{a group of people}} who have only just {{realised}} what is happening. A male figure in a red Phrygian cap (a symbol of the French and American Revolutions) reclines with his arm around the waist of a female figure (identified as a bacchante by Sarah Burnage of the University of York). The female figure shades her eyes, either against the brightness of the angel or <b>to</b> <b>block</b> <b>out</b> the horror taking place in front of her.|$|E
5|$|Chavrusa {{learning}} {{tends to}} be loud and animated, as the study partners read the Talmudic text and the commentaries aloud {{to each other and}} then analyze, question, debate, and defend their points of view to arrive at a mutual understanding of the text. In the heat of discussion, they may wave their hands or even shout at each other. Depending {{on the size of the}} yeshiva, dozens or even hundreds of chavrusas can be heard discussing and debating each other's opinions. One of the skills of chavrusa learning is the ability <b>to</b> <b>block</b> <b>out</b> all other discussions in the study hall and focus on one's study partner alone.|$|E
5|$|The scenes {{on board}} the Queen Anne were filmed aboard the famous {{passenger}} liner RMS Queen Mary, which has long {{been used as a}} hotel. The X-Files crew spent a total of eleven days filming on the Queen Mary, and erected wrap-around scaffolding on the bridge in order <b>to</b> <b>block</b> <b>out</b> the lights of nearby Long Beach, California. To make it look like it was raining during the scenes on the bridge, the crew installed large sprinkler systems to provide a constant supply of water. Unhappy with the remodeled style of the ship's corridors and ballroom, Carter had portions of the ship recarpeted and redecorated to give the finished episode a late-1930s style.|$|E

5|$|Shots {{where the}} {{spacecraft}} had parts in motion or the perspective changed were shot by directly filming the model. For most shots {{the model was}} stationary and camera was driven along a track on a special mount, the motor of which was mechanically linked to the camera motor—making it possible to repeat camera moves and match speeds exactly. Elements of the scene were recorded on same piece of film in separate passes to combine the lit model, stars, planets, or other spacecraft in the same shot. In moving shots of the long Discovery One spacecraft, {{in order to keep}} the entire model in focus, multiple passes had to be made with the lighting on it blocked out section by section. In each pass the camera would be focused on the one lit section. Many matting techniques were tried <b>to</b> <b>block</b> <b>out</b> the stars behind the models, with film makers sometimes resorting to hand tracing frame by frame around the image of the spacecraft (rotoscoping) to create the matte.|$|E
25|$|Sunglasses or sun {{glasses are}} a visual aid which feature lenses that are {{coloured}} or darkened to prevent strong light {{from reaching the}} eyes. For centuries, Chinese judges had routinely worn smoke-colored quartz lenses to conceal their eye expressions in court. However, these were not intended for blocking sunlight from eyes. It wasn't until the 20th century that what is now considered to be sunglasses were invented. In 1929, Sam Foster invented and mass-produced the first tinted eyewear pieces solely intended <b>to</b> <b>block</b> <b>out</b> sunlight.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} Test at Sophia Gardens, Strauss failed to {{capitalise}} on two starts, scoring 30 and 17; his second-innings dismissal, caught off a top-edged cut off Nathan Hauritz, was particularly poor. On a good batting wicket Australia racked up 674 for 6 declared, with Simon Katich (122), Ricky Ponting (150), Marcus North (125 not out) and Brad Haddin (121) all scoring centuries. In the second innings, only a dogged 5¾-hour 74 from Paul Collingwood and tail-end contributions salvaged a draw for England, with final pair James Anderson and Monty Panesar left <b>to</b> <b>block</b> <b>out</b> the final 11½ overs of the match.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{highlighted}} user concerns {{with respect to}} third-party tracking and online behavioral advertising (OBA) {{and the need for}} better consumer choice mechanisms to address these phenomena. We re-investigate the question of perceptions of third-party tracking while situating it in the larger context of how online ads, in general, are perceived by users. Via in-depth interviews with 53 Web users in India, we find that although concerns for third-party tracking and OBA remain noticeable amongst this population, other aspects of online advertising—like the possibility of being shown ads with embarrassing and suggestive content—are voiced as greater concerns than the concern of being tracked. Current-day blocking tools are insufficient to redress the situation: users demand selective filtering of ad content (as opposed <b>to</b> <b>blocking</b> <b>out</b> all ads) and are not satisfied with mechanisms that only control tracking and OBA. We conclude with design recommendations for enduser tools to control online ad consumption keeping in mind the concerns brought forth by our study...|$|R

25|$|High power mercury vapor {{black light}} lamps {{are made in}} power ratings of 100 to 1000 watts. These do not use phosphors, but rely on the {{intensified}} and slightly broadened 350375nm spectral line of mercury from high pressure discharge at between , depending upon the specific type. These lamps use envelopes of Wood's glass or similar optical filter coatings <b>to</b> <b>block</b> <b>out</b> all the visible light and also the short wavelength (UVC) lines of mercury at 184.4 and 253.7nm, which are harmful to the eyes and skin. A few other spectral lines, falling within the pass band of the Wood's glass between 300 and 400nm, contribute to the output.|$|E
25|$|In 1911, {{when all}} the Romanian factions briefly cooperated <b>to</b> <b>block</b> <b>out</b> other ethnic communities, Isopescu-Grecul also secured {{election}} to the Diet of Bukovina for Storozynetz. He had reconciled with Popovici and the PNPR youth wing, {{becoming one of the}} group's 7 representatives in the Diet; the Democratic Peasantists had 8, and the Conservatives, heralded by Iancu Flondor, had 5. He also retook his seat in the House in the parliamentary election of that year, again as representative for Storozynetz, Bojan, and Czernowitz. In Bojan, he defeated Florea Lupu, the Democratic Peasantist banker, during a heated campaign which saw him being injured by Lupu's voters. Isopescu-Grecul was putting out the newspaper Unirea Națională, which claimed that Lupu intended to destroy the network of Bukovinan Romanian banks.|$|E
5000|$|A {{compressed}} earth block (CEB), {{also known}} as a pressed earth block or a compressed soil block, is a building material made primarily from damp soil compressed at high pressure <b>to</b> form <b>blocks.</b> Compressed earth blocks use a mechanical press <b>to</b> form <b>blocks</b> <b>out</b> of an appropriate mix of fairly dry inorganic subsoil, non-expansive clay and aggregate. If the blocks are stabilized with a chemical binder such as Portland cement they are called compressed stabilized earth block (CSEB) or stabilized earth block (SEB). Typically, around [...] is applied in compression, and the original soil volume is reduced by about half.|$|R

25|$|A {{crowd of}} a couple of hundred saw Bangladesh's opening batsman Javed Omar hit three {{boundaries}} in the opening overs, but he was run out by Russel Arnold, and from then on, Bangladesh lost wickets regularly. No partnership passed 30 until that of the very last wicket, by which time it was all too late. Dilhara Fernando started the procession, deceiving Tushar Imran and Mohammad Ashraful to send them back for single-figure scores, and joint top-scorer Shahriar Nafees was fourth to fall, giving a return catch to Dilshan. Following Nafees' dismissal, Bangladesh quickly crashed to 103 for 8, with fast bowler Farveez Maharoof taking three wickets. Eventually, Bangladesh needed 143 for the last wicket off 98 deliveries, and Khaled Mashud and Tapash Baisya opted <b>to</b> <b>block</b> <b>out</b> the overs instead - while the Sri Lankan captain gave the ball to his spinners to get the match over with quickly, the three seamers Chaminda Vaas, Fernando and Maharoof only bowling 20 of a possible 30 overs.|$|E
500|$|Atomic line {{filters are}} {{inherently}} very efficient filters, generally classified as [...] "ultra-high-Q" [...] as their Q factor {{is in the}} 105 to 106 range. This is partially because the, [...] "crossed polarizers ... serve <b>to</b> <b>block</b> <b>out</b> background light with a rejection ratio better than 10−5". The passband of a typical Faraday filter may be a few GHz. The total output of a Faraday filter may be around 50% of the total input light intensity. The light lost is reflected or absorbed by imperfect lenses, filters and windows.|$|E
500|$|The land {{on which}} the Green sits was {{originally}} a pine forest, with some trees reaching the height of 270 feet (82 m), high enough <b>to</b> <b>block</b> <b>out</b> the sun. The process of clearing the pines was begun in 1770 by the newly founded Dartmouth College. The village plan of Hanover was laid out the following year and included as its central feature an open square of [...] (three hectares). Even though the land had been cleared, many tree stumps remained until 1831; for a long period, it was a Dartmouth tradition for the graduating class to remove one stump.|$|E

500|$|Filming was {{conducted}} in and around Slough, Buckinghamshire and Maidenhead, Berkshire over five weeks between May and June 1960. The Slough location shooting made use of [...] the AP Films Studio itself (doubling as the gang's warehouse), a café {{on the other side}} of the road (as the main hideout), the woods of Burnham Beeches and various points along the A4 road. Halliford Studios in Shepperton, Surrey was also used briefly for filming. On one occasion, when the production had fallen behind schedule and night filming inside the café had run into the morning, the crew attached black drapes to the windows <b>to</b> <b>block</b> <b>out</b> the dawn sunlight and allow the shoot to finish.|$|E
500|$|Aside {{from that}} of the children, little sympathy is {{directed}} toward the bird; David Solkin suggests the subjects of the painting show the dispassionate detachment of the evolving scientific society. Individuals are concerned for each other: the father for his children, the young man for the girl, but the distress of the cockatoo elicits only careful study. [...] To one side of the boy at the rear, the cockatoo's empty cage can be seen on the wall, and to further heighten the drama it is unclear whether the boy is lowering the cage on the pulley to allow the bird to be replaced after the experiment or hoisting the cage back up, certain of its former occupant's death. It has also been suggested that he may be drawing the curtains <b>to</b> <b>block</b> <b>out</b> the light from the full moon.|$|E
500|$|Neela Debnath of The Independent commented {{positively}} on the show's continuing {{exploration of}} the Daleks and the more [...] "adult tone", praising {{the performance of the}} three leads. Radio Times writer Patrick Mulkern stated that it [...] "ticks all [...] boxes as a Doctor Who fan of more than 40 years standing", describing it as [...] "clever, fast, funny, eerie, surprising and tearjerking". Nick Setchfield of SFX gave the episode five out of five stars, calling it a [...] "strong, cinematically-minded series opener" [...] which succeeded in making the Daleks scary. He also praised Coleman's debut, Smith's performance, the special effects, and Amy and Rory's emotional subplot. io9 reviewer Charlie Jane Anders noted that the plot [...] "is mostly just an excuse to explore the Doctor's ongoing relationship with the Daleks, and to show how sad it's gotten". Both Anders and Mulkern (the latter citing a Doctor Who veteran, Katy Manning) noted that Oswin's fascination with eggs, required for making soufflés, is really just a mental trick <b>to</b> <b>block</b> <b>out</b> the [...] "exterminate" [...] ("eggs-terminate") conditioning; this literary device is woven throughout the episode as a series of subtle hints, as Rory is confused by a dormant Dalek, initially misinterpreting him as saying [...] "eggs".|$|E
5000|$|Although {{well liked}} by {{cultural}} and political figures of all hues, with whom he collaborated on various projects, Dobrescu's clandestine support for the concept [...] "Greater Romania" [...] made him a political liability.

50|$|Handschiegl {{described}} the invention thus: A separate, black-and-white print for each color {{to be applied}} was made. Using an opaque paint, portions of the image where color was to be applied were <b>blocked</b> <b>out.</b> A duplicate negative was made from the painted print and developed in a tanning developer, which hardened the gelatin layer {{where it had been}} exposed and developed. Those areas corresponding <b>to</b> the <b>blocked</b> <b>out</b> areas on the print remained relatively soft and capable of taking up dye. This dyed matrix film was brought into contact, in accurate register, with a positive print, to which the dye transferred in the appropriate areas. The print made several passes through the dye transfer machines, in contact with a separate matrix for each color. Usually, three colors were applied at the most.|$|R
