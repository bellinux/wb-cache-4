5|$|It is {{believed}} in Twelver Shia Islam that ‘aql, divine wisdom, {{is the source}} of the souls of the Prophets and Imams and gives them esoteric knowledge called Hikmah and that their sufferings are a means of divine grace to their devotees. Although <b>the</b> <b>Imam</b> is not the recipient of a divine revelation, he has a close relationship with God, through which God guides him, and <b>the</b> <b>Imam</b> in turn guides the people. The Imams are also guided by secret texts in their possession, such as al-Jafr and al-Jamia. Imamate, or belief, in the divine guide is a fundamental belief in the Twelver Shia doctrine and is based on the concept that God would not leave humanity without access to divine guidance.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many of his}} contemporaries, he {{does not}} seem to have felt that his admiration for the pre-Islamic Iranian civilization {{conflicted}} with his Muslim Shiite faith. According to some accounts, he repaired <b>the</b> <b>Imam</b> Husayn Shrine in Karbala, and built a mausoleum of Ali in Najaf, which is today known as <b>the</b> <b>Imam</b> Ali Mosque. He is said to have been generous to a prominent Shiite theologian, but did not follow a Shiite religious policy and was tolerant to the Sunnis. He even tried to get closer to the Sunnis by giving his daughter in marriage to the caliph, which was a failure because the caliph refused to consummate the marriage.|$|E

5|$|Al-Badr {{had formed}} two royalist armies— one under his uncle Prince Hassan {{in the east}} and one under his own control in the west. Both armies {{controlled}} most of the north and east of Yemen, including the towns of Harib and Marib. The provincial capital of Northern Yemen, Sadah, which would have given <b>the</b> <b>Imam</b> a key strategic road towards the main capital San'a, was controlled by the republicans. There were also areas like the town of Hajjah, where the royalists controlled the mountains while the Egyptians and republicans controlled the town and fortress. Mercenaries from France, Belgium and England, who had fought in Rhodesia, Malaya, Indochina and Algeria, were sent to assist <b>the</b> <b>Imam</b> in planning, training and giving the irregular forces the ability to communicate with one another and the Saudis. They trained tribesmen in the use of antitank weapons, such as the 106mm gun and in mining techniques. The numbers of mercenaries are estimated in the hundreds, although Egyptian sources at the time reported 15,000. Royalist tactics were confined to guerilla warfare, isolating conventional Egyptian and republican forces, and conducting attacks on supply lines.|$|E
5|$|Muhammad Darwis (Ihsan Tarore) is a {{youth in}} 19th-century Kauman, Yogyakarta, {{and the son}} of Kyai Abubakar, <b>the</b> <b>imam</b> of the area's mosque. Displeased with the mixture of Islam and animistic Javanese mysticism, which leads to poor Javanese {{spending}} exorbitant amounts of money on religious ceremonies, Darwis decides to go on the hajj to Mecca in Saudi Arabia. While there, he studies what he considers the true form of Islam over a period of five years.|$|E
2500|$|The Shaykhi {{movement}} {{was a school}} of theology within Twelver Shi'a Islam that was started through the teaching of Shaykh Ahmad al-Ahsá'í. [...] Shaykh Ahmad's teachings included that <b>the</b> <b>Imams</b> were spiritual beings and thus, {{in contrast to the}} widespread Shi'a belief, that <b>the</b> <b>Imams</b> existed within spiritual bodies, and not material bodies. [...] He also taught that there must always exist the [...] "Perfect Shi'a" [...] who serves as an intermediary between <b>the</b> <b>Imams</b> and <b>the</b> believers, and is the one who can visualize the consciousness of <b>the</b> Hidden <b>Imam.</b>|$|R
50|$|It {{is popular}} Shi'i belief {{that to be}} buried near the burial place of <b>the</b> <b>Imams</b> is beneficial. In Shi'i sacred texts it is stated that the time between death and resurrection (barzakh, purgatory) should be spent near <b>the</b> <b>Imams.</b>|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, Bahrain was invaded {{by both the}} Omanis and the Al Sauds. In 1802 it was governed by a 12-year-old child, when the Omani ruler Sayyid Sultan {{installed}} his son, Salim, as Governor in the Arad Fort. In 1816, the British political resident in the Gulf, William Bruce, {{received a letter from}} the Sheikh of Bahrain who was concerned about a rumour that Britain would support an attack on the island by <b>the</b> <b>Imam</b> of Muscat. He sailed to Bahrain to reassure the Sheikh that {{this was not the case}} and drew up an informal agreement assuring the Sheikh that Britain would remain a neutral party.|$|E
5|$|Muhammad al-Badr led his {{campaign}} with the princes {{of the house}} of Hamidaddin. Those included Hassan bin Yahya, who had come from New York, Mohamed bin Hussein, Mohamed bin Ismail, Ibrahim al Kipsy, and Abdul Rahman bin Yahya. At fifty-six, Hassan bin Yahya was the oldest and most distinguished. Prince Hassan was made Prime Minister and Commander-in-Chief. <b>The</b> <b>Imam</b> was joined by his childhood pen pal, American Bruce Conde, who set up the post office and would later rise to the rank of general in the Royalist forces.|$|E
5|$|The Fatimid general, Jawhar, conquered Egypt in 969. He {{built a new}} palace city in Egypt, near Fustat, {{which he}} also called el-Mansuriya. When <b>the</b> <b>imam</b> arrived in 973, the name was changed to el-Qahra (Cairo). The new city was {{rectangular}} rather than round in plan. Both cities had mosques named el-Azhar after the prophet Muhammad's daughter, Fatima el-Azhar, and both had gates named Bab el-Futuh and Bab Zuwaila. Both cities had two palaces, for the caliph and for his heir, opposite each other.|$|E

50|$|On November 20, 2006, 6:30pm, six Muslim imams {{were removed}} from US Airways Flight 300 to Phoenix, Arizona, at Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport, because several {{passengers}} and crew members became alarmed by what they felt was suspicious behavior. The airline has stated that the captain delayed takeoff and called airport security workers to ask <b>the</b> <b>imams</b> to leave <b>the</b> plane; the men refused, and that the captain then called police. The plane left without <b>the</b> <b>imams</b> on board about three hours later. <b>The</b> <b>imams</b> were arrested, questioned, and then released.|$|R

5|$|The mosque has an old Quran, {{believed}} by the locals {{to have been}} given as a gift from heaven in 1650 to Yidan Barimah Bramah, <b>the</b> <b>Imam</b> at the time, {{as a result of}} his prayers. The mosque, built with mud and reeds, has two tall towers in pyramidal shape, one for the mihrab which faces towards Mecca forming the facade on the east and the other as a minaret in the northeast corner. These are buttressed by twelve bulbous shaped structures, which are fitted with timber elements.|$|E
5|$|It has {{intricate}} carvings, with inscriptions in Quranic script. The mosque, in a walled enclosure, {{is made of}} interlocking coral blocks {{with its}} hypostyle roof supported by cut-coral columns. With three entrances, the mosque has two prayer halls surrounded by antechambers on three sides. Its vaulted, decorated ceiling is indented in steps. Local master carpenters, known as maavadikaleyge, fashioned the mosque's woodwork, roof and interior, and its wall panels and ceilings have many culturally-significant examples of traditional Maldivian woodcarving and lacquerwork. The mihrab, with a mimbar (pulpit) at one end, is a large chamber. The main building, used for daily prayers, {{is divided into three}} sections: the mihtab (used by <b>the</b> <b>imam</b> to lead the prayers), the medhu miskiy (the mosque's central area) and the fahu miskiy (the rear of the mosque). A long, carved 13th-century panel memorializes the introduction of Islam to Maldives.|$|E
5|$|Sometime between 1902 and 1905, al-Qassam {{left for}} Cairo {{to study at}} the al-Azhar Mosque. Who he studied with is disputed by sources; some {{accounts}} say he studied under the Muslim reformist scholar Muhammad Abduh and {{came into contact with}} the prominent proto-Salafist, Rashid Rida, who himself studied under Abduh, while others are skeptical of al-Qassam's relationships with either. However, the attitude al-Qassam later adopted toward the political issues in the Arab world suggests he was well-acquainted with the ideas Abduh and Rida espoused. At al-Azhar, al-Qassam developed the thinking that would guide his future activism. Critical of a stagnant Islam, he preached among the ranks of farmers and other locals about the necessity for a modern Islam, one capable of defending itself from Western colonialism through jihad (holy struggle). He returned to Jableh in 1909 as an ′alim and worked as a teacher at a Qadariyya madrasa (Islamic school) where he taught both the mystical practices of the Qadariyya Sufi order and the jurisprudence and commentary of the Qur'an. In addition he preached as <b>the</b> <b>imam</b> of the Ibrahim Ibn Adham Mosque.|$|E

5|$|Imam Ahmad bin Yahya {{inherited}} the Yemeni throne in 1948. In 1955, Iraq-trained Colonel Ahmad Thalaya led a revolt against him. A {{group of soldiers}} under his command surrounded the royal palace of Al Urdhi at Taiz, a fortified stronghold where <b>the</b> <b>Imam</b> lived with his harem, the royal treasure, an arsenal of modern weapons, and a 150 strong palace-guard, and demanded Ahmad's abdication. Ahmad agreed, but demanded that his son, Muhammad al-Badr succeed him. Thalaya refused, preferring the king's half brother, the Emir Saif el Islam Abdullah, the 48-year-old Foreign Minister. While Abdullah began forming a new government, Ahmad opened the treasury coffers and secretly began buying off the besieging soldiers. After five days, the number of besiegers was reduced from 600 to 40. Ahmad then {{came out of the}} palace, wearing a devil's mask and wielding a long scimitar, terrifying the besiegers. He slashed two sentries dead before exchanging the sword for a sub-machine gun and leading his 150 guards onto the roof of the palace to begin a direct attack on the rebels. After 28 hours, 23 rebels and one palace guard were dead and Thalaya gave up. Abdullah was later reported executed, and Thalaya was publicly decapitated.|$|E
5|$|The {{result of}} these {{policies}} was that revolts and local power struggles erupted across the Caliphate, with only Khurasan and the frontier districts with the Byzantine Empire exempt from this turmoil. Iraqi region in particular descended into near-anarchy. The new governor of Iraqi region, Fadl's brother al-Hasan ibn Sahl, soon lost {{the support of the}} abnaʾ. The local population's alienation from his regime was exploited by the Zaydi Alids, who on 26 January 815 rose in revolt at Kufa, led by former general Abu 'l-Saraya al-Sirri. The revolt spread quickly through Iraq region as various groups with old grievances against the Abbasids used the opportunity to exact revenge. Thus at Basra, the revolt was led by the Alid Zayd, a son of <b>the</b> <b>imam</b> Musa al-Kadhim who had been executed in 799 on Harun al-Rashid's orders. The uprising came close to threatening Baghdad itself, and it was only through the intervention of the capable Harthama that it was quelled, with Abu 'l-Saraya being captured and executed in October. Secondary pro-Alid movements also seized control of Yemen (under Ibrahim al-Jazzar, another son of Musa al-Kadhim) and the Tihamah, including Mecca, where Muhammad al-Dibaj, a grandson of the Alid imam Ja'far al-Sadiq, was proclaimed Caliph in November 815. The suppression of these revolts was entrusted to Ali ibn Isa's son Hamdawayh, with an army of abnaʾ. Hamdawayh was successful in subduing these provinces, but then attempted, unsuccessfully, to secede from the Caliphate himself.|$|E
25|$|The prayer commences with <b>the</b> <b>imam</b> saying “Allahu akbar” out loud. For {{the five}} daily prayers, <b>the</b> <b>imam</b> would read the surah fatiha and a {{following}} {{section of the}} quran out loud only {{for the first two}} rakats of Fajr, Maghrib and Isha. To move between positions, <b>the</b> <b>imam</b> would say “Allahu akbar” out loud, such as when going to the bowing position, except when standing up again from the bowing position, when <b>the</b> <b>imam</b> would say “SamiAllahu liman hamidah” out loud. The prayer is concluded with <b>the</b> <b>imam</b> saying the taslim out loud.|$|E

50|$|In Shia Islam it {{is assumed}} that <b>the</b> <b>Imams</b> {{inherited}} their teachings from Prophet Muhammad. <b>The</b> <b>Imams</b> therefore, are considered the first authorities of Qur'anic interpretation. Next come the disciples of <b>the</b> <b>Imams</b> who were mainly transmitters of hadith. The first formative stage of Shia tafsir is therefore referred to the period of <b>the</b> living <b>Imams,</b> including that of the four representatives of <b>the</b> twelfth <b>imam</b> during his lesser occultation. Correspondingly, the second stage is the beginning of written hadith and tafsir tradition. Tafsir Furat Kufi was written in this latter era where commentators recorded the tradition as they received it without much comment of their own. The tone of these writings is largely polemical and defensive. This {{can be attributed to the}} fact that at the time Shia theology jurisprudence and hadith tradition was struggling to find a place within the Islamic tradition.|$|R
25|$|The Imamate of the Shia {{encompasses}} {{far more}} of a prophetic function than the Caliphate of the Sunnis.
