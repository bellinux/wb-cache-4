5|$|By {{the early}} twentieth century, the U.S. Treasury had mints {{operating}} in New Orleans, Denver, San Francisco, and the main center in Philadelphia, which more than met the demand for minted money. In 1904, the government ceased the minting of the silver dollar, which accounted {{for the bulk of}} the coinage the New Orleans branch had been producing since 1879. In 1909 Treasury officials declined <b>to</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>funds</b> for the mint's operation, effectively halting subsequent minting activity in New Orleans. In 1911, the New Orleans Mint was formally decommissioned and the machinery was transferred to the main U. S. Mint facility in Philadelphia,.|$|E
5|$|The CSR {{subsidies}} {{are paid to}} insurance companies to reduce copayments and deductibles for a smaller group of ACA enrollees, those earning less than 250% of the federal poverty line (FPL). The second and larger type of subsidy, the premium tax credits designed to reduce the post-subsidy cost of monthly premiums, apply to all enrollees earning less than 400% of the FPL. For scale, during 2017, approximately $7 billion in CSR subsidies will be paid, versus $34 billion for the premium tax credits. A court decision meant that CSR subsidies were treated as discretionary spending, meaning Congress must decide <b>to</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>funds</b> for them each year. This effectively gave the President the power to end them, as Democrats with a minority in Congress could not appropriate the funds, let alone override his veto of an appropriations bill.|$|E

25|$|The Sixteenth Amendment in 1913 {{extended}} congressional {{power of}} taxation to include income taxes without apportionment among the several States, and {{without regard to}} any census or enumeration. The Constitution also grants Congress the exclusive power <b>to</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>funds,</b> and this power of the purse is one of Congress's primary checks on the executive branch. Congress can borrow money on the credit of the United States, regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the states, and coin money. Generally, both the Senate and the House of Representatives have equal legislative authority, although only the House may originate revenue and appropriation bills.|$|E
25|$|Stewart {{arrived in}} the Oregon Country in 1843. After a short time in Oregon, Stewart volunteered to help rescue the Joel Palmer wagon train in 1845. In 1850 while living in Oregon City, Stewart {{purchased}} part of the townsite of Pacific City {{in what was then}} Lewis County from Elijah White. There he built an “iron house” and saw mill at this site near the entrance of the Columbia River to the Pacific Ocean and Cape Disappointment, near the present-day Ilwaco, Washington. By 1853 he was part owner of the Pacific Steam Saw Mill Company at that site. Later in 1853 the United States government took the property to use as a light house, and to use as military installation, Fort Canby. At that time the government did not pay Stewart as he only had squatter's rights to the land, but later at the age of 82 he petitioned the state of Washington who then sent a memorial to Congress to ask the Federal Government <b>to</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>funds</b> for Stewart’s benefit. Oregon then did the same, and Oregon Senator John H. Mitchell introduced a bill to pay Stewart for the property in 1891. In 1899 Peter Stewart was then paid $7,500 for the loss of his property by the United States government.|$|E
50|$|Underestimates by NASA of {{the station}} program's cost and unwillingness by the U.S. Congress <b>to</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>funding</b> for the space station {{resulted}} in delays of Freedoms design and construction; it was regularly redesigned and re-scoped.

25|$|In 1975 Bjelke-Petersen played {{what turned}} out to be a key role in the {{political}} crisis that brought down the Whitlam government. When Labor Senator Bertie Milliner died suddenly in June 1975, Bjelke-Petersen requested from the Labor Party a short list of three nominees, from which he would pick one. The ALP refused to supply such a list, instead nominating Mal Colston, an unsuccessful Labor candidate in the 1970 election, whom Bjelke-Petersen duly rejected. On 3 September Bjelke-Petersen announced that he had selected political novice Albert Field, a long-time ALP member who was critical of the Whitlam government. Field's appointment was the subject of a High Court challenge and he took leave in late 1975. During this period, the Coalition led by Malcolm Fraser declined to allot a pair to balance Field's absence. This gave the Coalition control over the Senate. Fraser used that control to obstruct passage of the Supply Bills through Parliament, denying Whitlam's then-unpopular government the legal capacity <b>to</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>funds</b> for government business and leading to his dismissal as Prime Minister. During the tumultuous election campaign precipitated by Whitlam's dismissal by Sir John Kerr, Bjelke-Petersen alleged that Queensland police investigations had uncovered damaging documentation in relation to the Loans Affair. This documentation was never made public and these allegations remained unsubstantiated.|$|E
25|$|The East Room {{was among}} the last rooms on the State Floor to be {{completed}} and used. The White House was unfinished when President John Adams occupied it between 1800 and 1801. His wife, Abigail Adams, hung laundry in the bare East Room to dry. Although much of the White House was finished and decorated during Adams administration, the East Room was not. The room's lone artwork was {{a copy of the}} Lansdowne portrait depicting George Washington, painted by Gilbert Stuart in 1797. It was purchased by the White House in 1800, and hung in the East Room. (Rescued from the 1814 fire, it still hangs there, with a companion portrait of Martha Washington painted by Eliphalet Frazer Andrews in 1878.) There was extensive feeling in Congress that Adams had adopted too many of the trappings of monarchy, and Congress declined <b>to</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>funds</b> to finish the room for fear it would look too much like a throne room. During the Jefferson administration, 38 gold-and-black painted chairs were purchased and placed in the room, but little else is known of the room's furnishings prior to 1814. Jefferson also had the East Room partitioned (using canvas and sailcloth for walls) and the southern end used for a bedroom and office for Meriwether Lewis and Lewis Harvie (both Private Secretary to the President).|$|E
500|$|When {{tensions}} with Great Britain prompted Congress <b>to</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>funds</b> for Colt's project {{toward the end}} of 1841, he demonstrated his underwater mines to the US government. In 1842 he used one of the devices to destroy a moving vessel to the satisfaction of the United States Navy and President John Tyler. However, opposition from John Quincy Adams, who was serving as a US Representative from Massachusetts's 8th congressional district scuttled the project as [...] "not fair and honest warfare" [...] and called the Colt mine an [...] "unchristian contraption".|$|E

50|$|In 1978, a ship {{actually}} did strike the bridge, which left the 1924 bridge stuck open and unrepairable. Because of this, the project qualified for {{funds from the}} federal Office of Special Bridge Replacement. However, with many other damaged bridges to replace, this program alone did not have sufficient funding. While federal lawmakers were opposed <b>to</b> <b>appropriating</b> <b>funds</b> <b>to</b> a high-level bridge, Seattle City Council member Jeanette Williams lobbied Congress for the bridge and successfully secured funds with help from Senator Warren Magnuson. The bridge was complete in 1984, and the smaller Spokane Street Bridge which parallels it was built at the same time.|$|R
500|$|Dummer {{sought to}} be {{generally}} conciliatory in {{his dealings with}} the provincial legislature, tolerating, for example, the selection of Elisha Cooke (who had led the opposition to Shute) as speaker of the assembly.

[...] The assembly refused <b>to</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>funds</b> to pay soldier salaries, leading to a rise in desertions. [...] They also retaliated by firing his brother Jeremiah (who was widely seen as {{a supporter of the}} Shute-Dudley-Dummer faction) as colonial agent.|$|E
500|$|Hayes {{tried to}} {{reconcile}} the social mores of the South with the recently passed civil rights laws by distributing patronage among southern Democrats.

[...] "To do this, I was ready to resort to unusual measures and to risk my own standing and reputation within my party and the country."

500|$|Saint Vincent's colonial {{government}} and defences {{were in some}} disarray. Governor Valentine Morris had assumed office in 1776 when the isle was granted a separate government, and reported then that it had virtually no defences. In addition to the difficult relations with the Caribs, the British population was also sympathetic {{to the cause of}} colonial independence. [...] The French capture of Dominica in 1778 had raised constitutional questions surrounding the imposition of martial law, and the colonial assembly had consequently refused <b>to</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>funds</b> for improving the island defences. Governor Morris had spent his own funds instead on improvements, contributing to financial difficulties he would run into later.|$|E

500|$|Unfortunately, Congress failed <b>to</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>funds</b> {{for the new}} National Park Service for 1917 and {{the ranger}} force was disbanded {{in the spring of}} 1917. Political {{pressure}} from the Montana Congressional delegation over the loss of economic revenue from the army presence resulted in the recall of the army and 450 soldiers from the 7th Cavalry Regiment were sent back to Fort Yellowstone to protect the park. [...] Administrative control remained with the Interior Department under the supervision of Acting Superintendent Chester Allinson Lindsley, a long time civilian employee in the park. Relations between the army, the Corps of Engineers and the Interior Department continued to be contentious in 1917–1918 as disagreements over proposed construction, ownership of buildings and use of personnel persisted. In 1918, Director of the National Park Service Stephen Mather convinced Congress and the War Department that civilian control of the National Parks under the National Park Service was the right solution. On October 31, 1918, the army left Yellowstone for the last time.|$|E
500|$|Burnet {{chose to}} take an {{extremely}} hard line {{on the subject of}} the salary: he refused to conduct any other business, or to dissolve the legislature, until the salary was decided. The legislature in turn refused to enact a salary bill, although it offered generous one-time grants that Burnet refused on principle. [...] He further raised tensions by implicitly suggesting that the assembly's failure to act on the salary might jeopardize the colonial charter. [...] In order to make life as difficult as possible for the legislators, Burnet relocated the assembly from Boston first to Salem and then Cambridge, increasing the costs of the legislators and forcing many of them from the comforts of their Boston-area properties. [...] In November 1728 the assembly voted to send agents to London to argue their side of the issue with the Board of Trade. [...] Its attempts <b>to</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>funds</b> for the agents were denied by the governor's council, and the agents ended up being paid from funds raised by subscription.|$|E
500|$|On May 19, 2005, the Kentucky Supreme Court {{issued a}} 4–3 {{decision}} {{stating that the}} General Assembly had acted unconstitutionally by not passing a budget and that Fletcher had acted outside his constitutional authority by spending money not specifically appropriated by the legislature. The majority opinion rejected the lower court's exception for [...] "specific essential services", saying [...] "If the legislative department fails <b>to</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>funds</b> deemed sufficient to operate the executive department at a desired level of services, the executive department must serve the citizenry as best it can with what it is given. If the citizenry deems those services insufficient, it will exercise its own constitutional power — the ballot." [...] Chief Justice Joseph Lambert dissented, claiming the executive spending plan was necessary. Two other justices, in a separate opinion, disagreed with the majority that federal and state constitutional mandates should still be funded {{in the absence of}} a budget. In their dissent, they argued that the threat of a government shutdown would act as an impetus for the General Assembly to engage in timely budget-making. The decision took no retroactive steps to change the actions it ruled unconstitutional, but it served as a precedent for any future cases of budgetary gridlock.|$|E
50|$|On April 18, 1978 TVA {{argued that}} an {{exception}} to the Endangered Species Act should be granted for balancing of equities.

TVA argued for {{an exception to}} be made in this case since the dam was started prior to the Endangered Species Act being passed and claimed it should be grandfathered in.

500|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the Civil War, American naval power declined precipitously, shrinking from nearly 700 vessels to just 52, {{most of which were}} obsolete. [...] The nation's military focus over the fifteen years before Garfield and Arthur's election had been on the Indian wars in the West, rather than the high seas, but as the region was increasingly pacified, many in Congress grew concerned at the poor state of the Navy. [...] Garfield's Secretary of the Navy, William H. Hunt, advocated reform of the Navy and his successor, William E. Chandler, appointed an advisory board to prepare a report on modernization. [...] Based on the suggestions in the report, Congress appropriated funds for the construction of three steel protected cruisers (Atlanta, Boston, and Chicago) and an armed dispatch-steamer (Dolphin), collectively known as the ABCD Ships or the Squadron of Evolution. [...] Congress also approved funds to rebuild four monitors (Puritan, Amphitrite, Monadnock, and Terror), which had lain uncompleted since 1877. [...] The contracts to build the ABCD ships were all awarded to the low bidder, John Roach & Sons of Chester, Pennsylvania, even though Roach once employed Secretary Chandler as a lobbyist. Democrats turned against the [...] "New Navy" [...] projects and, when they won control of the 48th Congress, refused <b>to</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>funds</b> for seven more steel warships. [...] Even without the additional ships, the state of the Navy improved when, after several construction delays, the last of the new ships entered service in 1889.|$|E
500|$|Construction {{began in}} April 1963 on his Brawner Building (888 17th Street NW), a 12-story office {{building}} on Farragut Square which incorporated dark bronze panels and solarized windows {{much as his}} 1234 19th Street building had. By the late 1960s, {{it was one of}} his best-known designs. In January 1964, Koubek designed what was then the D.C. metropolitan region's tallest office building, the 19-story steel-and-black glass clad Barlow Building (5454 Wisconsin Avenue). In August, the Freed family commissioned him to build the eight-story Chatham Apartments, the first high-rise, medium-income apartment building to be constructed among the two-story Georgian-style townhouses that comprised the [...] Buckingham Historic District. His first major D.C. residential structure was a nine-story apartment building (now turned to condominiums) at 1800 R Street NW, which opened in October 1964. In April 1965, construction began on the seven-story 1325 Massachusetts Avenue NW, a Modernist building with broad horizontal swaths of grey brick and glass. (The structure was home to the National Air Traffic Controllers Association and National Gay and Lesbian Task Force in 2011.) Another major office building, 1200 17th Street, [...] NW (at the time, the headquarters of the American Psychological Association), opened in October 1965. It was a neo-Brutalist structure featuring repetitive polished concrete panels and deeply recessed rectangular windows, {{and one of the first}} high-rise office buildings on the downtown business district portion of Connecticut Avenue. That same year his 18-story Ross Building (now known as Wytestone Plaza) in Richmond, Virginia, opened—the first high-rise built in the city since 1928, and the first glass-curtain wall building constructed in the city. Koubek was also lead architect for and an investor in a syndicate ("Reservation Eleven Associates") which designed a new United States Department of Labor (DOL) building at 2nd Street NW and Constitution Avenue NW in 1966. The group proposed an arrangement in which it would construct the building, lease it to the federal government for 30 years, and then donate it to the government. Congress, cutting back on construction funds as well as interested in the build/lease/donate proposal, refused <b>to</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>funds</b> for the DOL structure. Eventually, however, Koubek's syndicate lost the commission, and a new DOL building (jointly designed by the firm of Brooks, Barr, Graeber & White and the firm of Pitts, Mebane, Phelps & White) was completed in 1974.|$|E
