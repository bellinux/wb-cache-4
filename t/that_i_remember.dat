5|$|From {{an early}} age, Reines {{exhibited}} {{an interest in}} science, and liked creating and building things. He later recalled that: The first stirrings of interest in science <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> occurred during a moment of boredom at religious school, when, looking {{out of the window}} at twilight through a hand curled to simulate a telescope, I noticed something peculiar about the light; it was the phenomenon of diffraction. That began for me a fascination with light.|$|E
500|$|Author Katherine V. Forrest claimed Bannon and {{her books}} [...] "are {{in a class}} by themselves" [...] and credits Bannon with saving her life, writing in 2005, [...] "Overwhelming need led me to walk a {{gauntlet}} of fear up to the cash register. Fear so intense <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> nothing more, only that I stumbled out of the store in possession of what I knew I must have, a book as necessary to me as air... I found it when I was eighteen years old. It opened the door to my soul and told me who I was." ...|$|E
500|$|At the time, teams rarely {{employed}} {{tactics of}} any sort – Chapman would later remark: [...] "No {{attempt was made to}} organise victory. The most <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> was the occasional chat between, say two men playing on the same wing." [...] As a manager, he sought to change that; after seeing Northampton lose to Norwich City despite dominating, Chapman opined that [...] "a team can attack for too long". He thus set about creating a tactical framework for all his players; he dropped the half backs (midfield) back to give his forwards more space and draw the opposition defenders out of the penalty area, while encouraging his own back line to pass their way out of trouble. Gradually, he created a style of highly-organised, counter-attacking football, which was at odds with the prevailing orthodoxy but nevertheless highly effective; Swindon Town's England international Harold Fleming, after losing 4–1 at home to Northampton, remarked to Chapman: [...] "You have something more than a team: you have a machine." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} filmed {{on a set}} {{constructed}} at Studio D in the BBC Elstree Centre, run by BBC Studioworks, and authentic 1970s costumes and props were rented for the filming. The studio was retrofitted with cameras and lighting equipment {{that would have been}} used on a 1970s set, including three Ikegami HK 323 cameras and a single Ikegami HK323P camera, all provided by a company called Golden Age Recreations. The filming of the episode thus differed from the series's usual single-camera setup approach. Adam Tandy, Inside No. 9 producer, said that [...] "Studio D has the heritage and familiar atmosphere <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> from when I worked at Elstree in the 1980s; however, a lot of modernisation has taken place since then and this has allowed us to monitor our 4:3 625-line PAL pictures in BBC Studioworks' state of the art HD production gallery." [...] For Shearsmith, the result was that [...] "it looks shit, but it's brilliant".|$|E
2500|$|On September 5, CBS interviewed Killian's friend Robert Strong, {{who ran the}} Texas Air National Guard {{administrative}} office. Among {{other issues}} covered in his interview with Rather and Mapes, Strong {{was asked if he}} thought the documents were genuine. Strong stated, [...] "they are compatible with the way business was done at the time. They are compatible with the man <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> Jerry Killian being." [...] Strong had first seen the documents twenty minutes earlier and also said he had no personal knowledge of their content; he later claimed he had been told to assume the content of the documents was accurate.|$|E
2500|$|Robert Peel, {{often called}} the [...] "model Prime Minister", {{was the first to}} {{recognise}} this new role. After the successful Conservative campaign of 1841, J. W. Croker said in a letter to Peel, [...] "The elections are wonderful, and the curiosity is that all turns on the name of Sir Robert Peel. It's the first time <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> in our history that the people have chosen the first Minister for the Sovereign. Mr. Pitt's case in '84 is the nearest analogy; but then the people only confirmed the Sovereign's choice; here every Conservative candidate professed himself in plain words to be Sir Robert Peel's man, and on that ground was elected." ...|$|E

2500|$|Wittgenstein {{makes this}} clear in section 258: [...] "A {{definition}} surely serves {{to establish the}} meaning of a sign.—Well, that is done precisely by the concentrating of my attention; for in this way I impress on myself the connexion between the sign and the sensation.—But [...] "I impress it on myself" [...] can only mean: this process brings it about <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> the connexion right in the future. But in the present case I have no criterion of correctness." [...] This absence of any criterion of correctness is not a problem because it makes it more difficult for the private linguist to remember his sensation correctly; it is a problem because it undermines the intelligibility of such a concept as remembering the sensation, whether correctly or incorrectly.|$|E
2500|$|Production {{went very}} well, and as {{expected}} {{with so many}} comic actors and personalities around, was very lively. During production, Hudlin said that whenever David Alan Grier and Martin Lawrence worked, the film's crew usually worked a little slower because wherever they were, there {{would be so much}} comedy being generated and they were so funny that everyone wanted to hang out near where they were throughout the day. In the scene where the new fragrance is being presented to Strangé, the director said that [...] "what Grace was doing on the set while we were shooting was so funny <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> Halle crying off camera, cause she was trying to keep a straight face but she couldn't. So whenever she was off-camera, she would just be literally crying because she was laughing so hard. And fortunately, for her reaction shots she was able to recover." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pryor is in tears, {{with blood}} {{running down her}} neck, in a {{videotape}} made by artist Clayton Patterson. Another video made by freelance cameraman Paul Garrin shows officers swinging clubs at him and slamming him against a wall. [...] Photographer John McBride, taking still photos of the riot that were {{to be published in}} The Village Voice, was also struck by a policeman's nightstick in the same attack taped by Garrin. Mr. Fish, a travel promoter out for an evening on the town, attempted to hail a taxi on Avenue A near Sixth Street when he was suddenly struck on the head. [...] "I was just standing there watching," [...] he said. [...] "The next thing <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> is seeing the stick, and then a young woman who was helping me." [...] Patterson's videotape showed that no officers helped Fish until an ambulance arrived. A police helicopter hovered over the scene, contributing to a sense of chaos.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the evening}} of 22 November 1956 Butler, who had just {{announced}} British withdrawal, addressed the 1922 committee (Conservative backbenchers) with Macmillan. After Butler's downbeat remarks, ten minutes or so in length, Macmillan delivered a stirring thirty-five minute speech described by Enoch Powell as [...] "one of the most horrible things <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> in politics … (Macmillan) with all the skill of the old actor manager succeeded in false-footing Rab. The sheer devilry of it verged upon the disgusting." [...] He expounded on his metaphor that henceforth the British must aim to be [...] "Greeks in the Roman Empire", and according to Philip Goodhart's recollection almost knocked Butler off his chair with his expansive arm gestures. Macmillan wrote [...] "I held the Tory Party for the weekend, it was all I intended to do". Macmillan had further meetings with Aldrich and Winston Churchill after Eden left for Jamaica (23 November) while briefing journalists (disingenuously) {{that he planned to}} retire and go to the Lords. He was also hinting that he would not serve under Butler.|$|E
2500|$|... "Being {{an actress}} {{who uses the}} Stanislavsky method, I always try to find details about my character. With Pamela... I began with a class ring <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> reading in the script that she'd worn. Starting with that, I traced Pamela back to my own high school days in the early 1940s. So it's 1944, a very {{conservative}} time, and Pamela has a steady boyfriend. They have sex—which is very bad of course—and Pamela soon gets pregnant with Jason. The father takes off and when Pamela tells her parents, they disown her because having... babies out of wedlock isn't something that good girls do. I think she took Jason and raised him the best she could, but {{he turned out to}} be a very strange boy. [...] lots of odd jobs and one of those jobs was as a cook at a summer camp. Then Jason drowns and her whole world collapses. What were the counselors doing instead of watching Jason? They were having sex, which is the way that she got into trouble. From that point on, Pamela became very psychotic and puritanical in her attitudes as she was determined to kill all of the immoral camp counselors." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to David A. Morse (1907–199) {{during an}} 1977 interview, in 1949, who had lately been {{general counsel of}} the NLRB and was then U.S. {{delegate}} to the International Labor Conference of the [...] International Labour Organization (ILO), said: [...] At about that time, I think there were all these questions being raised about certain people in the Labor Board; not so much about their qualifications as their political orientation and what Paul Herzog wrote there may have been as a result of <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> there was this chap, Nat Witt, who had been head of the unit at the NLRB, that was responsible for the examiners. I recall that he had been accused from time to time by outside groups for being much tied in with Lee Pressman {{and the two of them}} were very much tied in with the Communist Party. [...] In 1950, the U.S. State Department revoked singer and civil rights activist Paul Robeson's passport as a means of preventing him from traveling overseas and continuing his left-wing political work. Witt was Robeson's first attorney and initiated Robeson's eight-year battle to regain his passport.|$|E

2500|$|At {{a meeting}} of the 1922 Committee on 22 November 1956, Rab Butler made a speech {{appealing}} for party unity {{in the aftermath of the}} Suez Crisis. His speech did not go down well and Harold Macmillan, whom Butler had taken along for moral support, addressed them and was a great success. In Powell's view this was [...] "one of the most horrible things <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> in politics... seeing the way in which Harold Macmillan, with all the skill of the old actor-manager, succeeded in false-footing Rab. The sheer devilry of it verged upon the disgusting". After Macmillan's death in 1986 Powell said [...] "Macmillan was a Whig, not a Tory... he had no use for the Conservative loyalties and affections; they interfered too much with the Whig's true vocation of detecting trends in events and riding them skilfully so as to preserve the privileges, property and interests of his class". However, when Macmillan replaced Eden as Prime Minister, Powell was offered the office of Financial Secretary to the Treasury on 14 January 1957. This office was the Chancellor of the Exchequer's deputy and the most important job outside the Cabinet.|$|E
2500|$|When {{sending his}} Historical preface and {{corrections}} for the American edition in February, Darwin thanked Asa Gray for his comments, as [...] "a Review from a man, {{who is not}} an entire convert, if fair & [...] moderately favourable, is in all respects {{the best kind of}} Review. About weak points I agree. The eye to this day gives me a cold shudder, but when I think of the fine known gradations, my reason tells me I ought to conquer the cold shudder." [...] In April he continued, [...] "It is curious <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> well time when the thought of the eye made me cold all over, but I have got over this stage of the complaint, & now small trifling particulars of structure often make me very uncomfortable. The sight of a feather in a peacock's tail, whenever I gaze at it, makes me sick!" [...] A month later Darwin emphasised that he was bewildered by the theological aspects and [...] "had no intention to write atheistically, but could not see, as plainly as others do, & as I shd wish to do, evidence of design & beneficence on all sides of us. There seems to me too much misery in the world. I cannot persuade myself that a beneficent and omnipotent God would have designedly created the Ichneumonidae with the express intention of their feeding within the living bodies of caterpillars" [...] – expressing his particular revulsion at the Ichneumonidae family of parasitic wasps that lay their eggs in the larvae and pupae of other insects so that their parasitoid young have a ready source of food. He therefore could not believe in the necessity of design, but rather than attributing the wonders of the universe to brute force was [...] "inclined to look at everything as resulting from designed laws, with the details, whether good or bad, left to the working out of what we may call chance. Not that this notion at all satisfies me. I feel most deeply that the whole subject is too profound for the human intellect. A dog might as well speculate on the mind of Newton" [...] – referring to Isaac Newton.|$|E
