30|$|As {{illustrated}} in Fig. 1, {{about half of}} the respondents believed that business and <b>technology</b> <b>incubators</b> enabled them to access market information. This shows that business and <b>technology</b> <b>incubators</b> {{play an important role in}} exposing women entrepreneurs to market, to some extent.

30|$|As {{illustrated}} in Fig. 1, {{the majority of}} the respondents agreed with the statement that business incubators facilitate training for women entrepreneurs.

The results reflect a general satisfaction with business and <b>technology</b> <b>incubators</b> in improving training among women entrepreneurs.

30|$|The {{results in}} Fig. 1 {{show that the}} {{majority}} of respondents do not consider business and <b>technology</b> <b>incubators</b> as a provider of working premises. Equally, the respondents in the in-depth interviews observed that business and <b>technology</b> <b>incubators</b> lack enough working premises to accommodate a large number of women entrepreneurs. Furthermore, during exploratory focus group discussions, one of the respondents lamented, “the premises provided by SIDO to women entrepreneurs are not enough to allow many women to incubate their business”. The responses indicate that business and <b>technology</b> <b>incubators</b> do very little in the provision of the working space to women entrepreneurs in the food processing industry.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This study aims at empirically {{investigating}} whether <b>technology</b> <b>incubators</b> help academic high-tech start-ups to establish collaborations with other organizations, thus increasing {{the competitiveness of}} these firms. In doing so, we {{take into account the}} specificities of academic high-tech start-ups with respect to their non-academic counterparts. We compare the effects of incubation on academic and non-academic high-tech start-ups through econometric estimates using a large sample of Italian firms. Our findings suggest that incubated academic high-tech start-ups do not enjoy any advantages in establishing collaborations with respect to their non-incubated peers. Conversely, <b>technology</b> <b>incubators</b> do help non-academic high-tech start-ups in establishing collaborations with public research organizations. We thus come to the interesting conclusion that the effects of incubation are moderated by the genetic characteristics of incubated firms...|$|R
40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that new knowledge underpinned innovation and growth influences economic activities. Economic agents rely {{not only on}} their own knowledge but also knowledge from others, whether it be codified and ’transferred via ICT’ or in tacit form. Moreover, {{it has long been}} argued that the acquisition of latter type of knowledge is influenced by geographic proximity. Based on this argument, it follows that the part firms’ supply of knowledge depends on how close, in terms of physical distance, to other firms, suppliers, customers, and research institutions, they are located. They are all can be categorize as a pool of knowledge that important for the firms’ growth and innovation capacity. Today, we witness many initiatives from policy makers around the world to compete in an increasingly technology- driven global economy through the establishing of <b>technology</b> <b>incubators.</b> <b>Technology</b> <b>incubators</b> can be conceived as organizations and/or facilities to enhance high-technology firm establishment and survival. Mostly they are located near the university or research center. There are many success stories on the contribution of incubators to the regional growth. At the same time, <b>technology</b> <b>incubators</b> have been widely criticized in the academic literature when judged in terms of regional innovation and knowledge development. The critics include the relying on an outdated, linear, model of innovation, which assumes that knowledge can be transferred directly from university to firms. However, innovation is now widely recognized as a complex non-linear process involving feedback loops and the creation of synergies through a diverse range of knowledge networks. Therefore, our understanding about knowledge spillover processes connected with incubator is yet poor. Very {{little is known about the}} mechanisms of knowledge exchange and spillover initiated by incubator and their role in supporting the growth of the firm. In this study we draw on the current body of literature, mainly agglomeration theories, and use the concepts of tacit knowledge and context to understand how knowledge spillovers actually take place. Our objective is to build a conceptual framework that describes how <b>technology</b> <b>incubators</b> operate as a mediator of knowledge for their tenants. In addition, based on empirical data of high-technology start-ups at TU Delft (The Netherlands), this study tests the proposition that not only geographic proximity to the university, but also that relations with other firms, particularly customers and suppliers matters. We also consider the function of ICT in shaping the new role of <b>technology</b> <b>incubators</b> in providing knowledge support. By explicitly analyzing the knowledge spillovers and mediation role offered by <b>technology</b> <b>incubators,</b> we seek to open up the ‘black box’ of the incubation process as a source of learning and gaining knowledge resources. We conclude the paper with a few recommendations for policymaking and further research. ...|$|R
