30|$|The results {{listed in}} Table  3 {{indicate}} that the path loading from SV <b>to</b> <b>LA</b> was 0.29, while that from PV <b>to</b> <b>LA</b> was 0.57; both path loadings were significant.

In addition, the path loading from PV to PI was 5.92, 4.76, and 4.88 for Energy Efficiency Grade Label, Korea Eco-Label without, and Korea Eco-Label with a green card, respectively.
