40|$|The Shear Thickening Fluid (STF) is a dilatant material, which {{displays}} non-Newtonian {{characteristics in}} its unique ability to transit {{from a low}} viscosity fluid to a high viscosity fluid. The research performed investigates the STF behavior by modeling and simulation {{of the interaction between}} the base flow and embedded rigid particles when subjected to shear stress. The model considered the Lagrangian description of the rigid particles and the Eulerian description of fluid flow. The numerical analysis investigated key parameters such as applied flow acceleration, particle distribution and arrangement, volume concentration of particles, particle size, shape and their behavior in a Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluid base. The fluid-particle interaction model showed that the arrangement, size, shape and volume concentration of the particles had a significant effect on the behavior of the STF.

Calcium suberate, a selective beta-nucleating agent was used to produce samples that consist entirely of beta-form i-PP. The experimental melting points were recorded at different crystallization times and were extrapolated {{to the start of the}} crystallization process in order to eliminate the <b>effect</b> of lamellar <b>thickening.</b> Using the non-linear Hoffman-Weeks approach to correlate these extrapolated experimental melting temperatures with the corresponding crystallization temperatures, an equilibrium melting point of 209 degreesC was obtained for beta-iPP. The equilibrium melting point estimated through the non-linear Hoffman-Weeks analysis is about 30 degreesC higher than that (T-m(o) = 177 degreesC) obtained on the basis of the linear extrapolation. These results are consistent with earlier claims that a linear extrapolation of T-m-T-c data leads to an underestimation of the equilibrium melting point. The results obtained for beta-iPP exemplify the importance of accounting for both the isothermal lamellar <b>thickening</b> <b>effects</b> and the non-linearity in the T-m-T-c correlation, when the determination of an equilibrium melting point is carried out using a procedure based on the predictions of the Lauritzen-Hoffman secondary nucleation theory...|$|R

50|$|Flour {{is often}} used for {{thickening}} gravies, gumbos, and stews. It must be cooked in thoroughly to avoid the taste of uncooked flour. Roux, a mixture of flour and fat (usually butter) cooked into a paste, is used for gravies, sauces and stews. Cereal grains (oatmeal, couscous, farina, etc.) are used to thicken soups. Yogurt is popular in Eastern Europe and Middle East for thickening soups. Soups can also be thickened by adding grated starchy vegetables before cooking, though these will add their own flavour. Tomato puree also adds thickness as well as flavour.

40|$|International audienceA {{plastisol}} is {{a suspension}} of PVC particles and mineral fillers in a liquid phase composed of plasticizer and adjuvants. Plastisol formulations {{are commonly used}} in coating processes for flooring application. In the knife-overroll process, they are subjected {{to a wide range}} of shear rates (0 – 105 s 21). They are adjusted in order to fulfil the target end-use properties but their processability depends on their rheology. Plastisol based on three PVC resins with or without mineral filler have been investigated using a Couette device and a capillary rheometer. Results show a high impact of PVC particle content, particle sizes and distribution on rheology: a polydisperse formulation displays a shear-thinning behavior in the whole shear rates range and exhibits yield stress; a monodisperse formulation shows a shear thinning behavior at low shear rate, followed by a Newtonian plateau, then a more or less pronounced dilatancy peak depending on plasticizer rate and finally another shear-thinning behavior; a bidisperse resin stands in between. Filler content also impacts the rheology: shear <b>thickening</b> <b>effects</b> at intermediate shear rates decrease or even disappear; however, the viscosity increase is important for low shear rates and depends on the filler particle size and particle size distribution...|$|R

40|$|The flow of polymer {{solutions}} in porous media {{is often described}} using Darcy’s law with an apparent viscosity capturing the observed thinning or <b>thickening</b> <b>effects.</b> While the macroscale form is well accepted, the fundamentals of the pore-scale mechanisms, their link with the apparent viscosity, and their relative influence are still a matter of debate. Besides the complex effects associated with the rheology of the bulk fluid, the flow is also deeply influenced by the mechanisms occurring close to the solid/liquid interface, where polymer molecules can arrange and interact in a complex manner. In this paper, we focus on a repulsive mechanism, where polymer molecules are {{pushed away from the}} interface, yielding a so-called depletion layer {{in the vicinity of the}} wall. This depletion layer acts as a lubricating film that may be represented by an effective slip boundary condition. Here, our goal is to provide a simple mean to evaluate the contribution of this slip effect to the apparent viscosity. To do so, we solve the pore-scale flow numerically in idealized porous media with a slip length evaluated analytically in a tube. Besides its simplicity, the advantage of our approach is also that it captures relatively well the apparent viscosity obtained from core-flood experiments, using only a limited number of inputs. Therefore, it may be useful in many applications to rapidly estimate the influence of the depletion layer effect over the macroscale flow and its relative contribution compared to other phenomena, such as non-Newtonian effects...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} {{quantifying}} {{the effect of}} ingredients within shear thickening fluids (STFs) with resultant rheological behaviours for their potential use in practical applications. This was done by firstly using steady shear testing to measure the rheology of STFs fabricated by several carrier fluids of poly(ethylene glycol) and poly(propylene glycol) of varying molecular weights and fumed silica with different particle sizes. It was discovered that larger particles increased the <b>thickening</b> <b>effect,</b> critical shear rate and the specific carrier fluid used affected the overall shear <b>thickening</b> <b>effect</b> and the critical shear rate. It {{was found that the}} fumed silica at larger particle size (OX 50), increased the <b>thickening</b> <b>effect</b> and critical shear rate and the type of carrier fluid used affected the shear thickening performance and the critical shear rate. It was also found that there existed an optimum weight fraction of fumed silica which showed maximum shear thickening performance. An explanation was then proposed to correlate factors such as varying particle size, carrier fluid chemistry and weight fraction to resultant rheological behaviours. A mathematical model was also proposed that correlated temperature and weight fraction to specific rheological parameters. In two selected STFs from the initial experiment (“PEG 400 + 45 wt% OX 50 ” and “PPG 400 + 35 wt% OX 50 ”), various additives (Tubular and platelets of boron nitride and titanium dioxide) were used in attempt to improve shear thickening performance. Boron nitride (BN) particles, in particular, showed improved temperature stability of rheological behaviour during steady shear testing at 0. 5 wt% in PEG 400 + OX 50. It was proposed that the superior thermal conductivity and hydrophilic nature of BN allowed for heat to rapidly evacuate from the STF during testing. These findings have significant impact in helping to understand the effects of particles and carrier fluid chemistry on the shear <b>thickening</b> <b>effect</b> and assisting in ‘tailoring’ STFs for specific applications to maximise shear thickening for above mentioned applications...|$|E

Then, a monotube damper with a bypass was designed and fabricated.

30|$|Polymer {{flooding}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} successful methods to enhance oil recovery. The polymers that are mainly used in oil fields are water-soluble polyacrylamide (HPAM), xanthan gum (Xc) and associative polymer (AP). Polymer solutions, in contrast to water, exhibit non-Newtonian rheological behaviors, such as shear thinning and shear <b>thickening</b> <b>effects,</b> which lead to different viscosity properties in a reservoir, as compared to those in water flooding. When a polymer solution is injected into a reservoir from an injection well, the fluid velocity, which is related to shear rate, will change from wellbore to in-depth of a reservoir; therefore, the polymer solution viscosity will also change from near wellbore to in-depth of a reservoir correspondingly [21]. The volume of the polymer solution injected may be 50  % PV, depending on the process design [6, 17]. High molecular weight (HMW) polyacrylamide and its derivatives are widely used in oil field applications such as drilling fluids, enhanced oil recovery (EOR) and treatment of oil sand tailings. In these applications, the adsorption characteristics of these polymers are essential since they would affect their applicability and efficiency [1, 9, 11, 12]. Rashidi studied the development and concept of sulfonated polyacrylamide copolymers. Studies were performed on the adsorption and viscosity measurements of the polymer solutions. Parameters that impact these polymers include shear rate, polymer concentration, sulfonate degree, molecular weight, NaCl concentration, divalent ion concentration and temperature. Finally, the results showed that these polymers can be considered as a substitute for hydrolyzed polyacrylamide solution at high salinity and temperature [5, 15].|$|R

Current methods of separating the two silk fractions is complicated and produces inadequate quantities of the isolated components {{for the study of}} the individual light and heavy chain silks with respect to new materials. We report a simple method of separating silk fractions using formic acid. The formic acid treatment partially releases predominately the light chain fragment (soluble fraction) and then the soluble fraction and insoluble fractions can be converted into new materials. The regenerated original (total) silk fibroin and the separated fractions (soluble vs. insoluble) had different molecular weights and showed distinctive pH stabilities against aggregation/precipitation based on particle charging. All silk fractions could be electrospun to give fibre mats with viscosity of the regenerated fractions being the controlling factor for successful electrospinning. The silk fractions could be mixed to give blends with different proportions of the two fractions to modify the diameter and uniformity of the electrospun fibres formed. The soluble fraction containing the light chain was able to modify the viscosity by thinning the insoluble fraction containing heavy chain fragments, perhaps analogous to its role in natural fibre formation where the light chain provides increased mobility and the heavy chain producing shear <b>thickening</b> <b>effects.</b> The simplicity of this new separation method should enable access to these different silk protein fractions and accelerate the identification of methods, modifications and potential applications of these materials in biomedical and industrial applications...|$|R

When the revolution speed of the centrifugal mixer was fixed at a high speed of 1200 rpm, the shear <b>thickening</b> <b>effect</b> of SiO 2 /PEG was gradually increased with the decrease of rotation speed, and the maximum viscosity (η) of 12340 mPa·s appeared at the rotation speed of 200 rpm.

40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to examine}} the feasibility of a new concept in section rolling of thick strip, which either could not be rolled at present due to cracking at bent corners. Whereas, the {{second moment of area}} of sections could be increased through sharpened corners and increased gauge thickness. A heat assisted section rolling process is proposed. This process is based on application of high intensity heat on the inner surface of the strip, immediately prior to rolling. To investigate the new section rolling concept, the following work has been carried out. Firstly, the material property of the S 450 steel has been determined using the Gleeble simulator, followed by thermal conductivity tests. Since a freon was used to increase temperature gradient, the heat transfer coefficient for the freon-hot surface interaction was determined. Finally, the four point hot bending tests were conducted to validate the simulation model. For this purpose, a hot bending test rig was designed and fabricated, utilizing an halogen heater as the heat source. The results between experiment and simulation were compared and a good correlation was found. Then, finite element analyses of a single pass hot rolling process has been adopted to investigate the neutral axis shift and section <b>thickening</b> <b>effects.</b> It is revealed that localised heating creates bulging on the compressed surface. The bulged surface affects the both neutral axis and thickening of the formed parts. This research has demonstrated that localised heating has a potential to be employed in section rolling operations. It shows that the neutral axis of the bent region shifted closer to the tensile surface would reduce the tendency for surface cracking. In addition, the increase in thickness that arises at a bend would enhance the stiffness of rolled sections. Ultimately a process window for heat assisted section rolling has been established.

40|$|The {{ability to}} absorb {{a large amount}} of energy during an impact event without {{generating}} critical damages represents a key feature of new generation composite systems. Indeed, the intrinsic layered nature of composite materials allows the embodiment of specific hybrid plies within the stacking sequence that can be exploited to increase impact resistance and damping of the entire structure without dramatic weight increase. This work is based on the development of an impact-resistant hybrid composite obtained by including a thin layer of Non-Newtonian silica based fluid in a carbon fibres reinforced polymer (CFRP) laminate. This hybrid phase is able to respond to an external solicitation by activating an order-disorder transition that thickens the fluid increasing its viscosity, hence dissipating the energy impact without any critical failure. Several Shear Thickening Fluids (STFs) were manufactured by changing the dimensions of the particles that constitute the disperse phase and their concentrations into the continuous phase. The dynamic viscosity of the different STFs was evaluated via rheometric tests, observing both shear thinning and shear <b>thickening</b> <b>effects</b> depending on the concentration of silica particles. The solutions were then embedded as an active layer within the stacking sequence to manufacture the hybrid CFRP laminates with different embedded STFs. Free vibration tests were carried out in order to assess the damping properties of the different laminates, while low velocity impact tests were used to evaluate their impact properties. Results indicate that the presence of the non-Newtonian fluid is able to absorb up to 45 % of the energy during an impact event for impacts at 2. 5 m/s depending on the different concentrations and particles dimensions. These results were confirmed via C-Scan analyses to assess the extent of the internal delamination...|$|R
40|$|The Left Ventricle (LV) can be {{considered}} to be a near-conical fibrous Flexible Matrix Composite (FMC) structure in which the myocardial fibers contract by a maximum of 15 % in length while pumping to cause an approximately 50 % overall volume contraction. The Pumping Potential (PP), defined as the relative volume reduction due to an input stroke, of a simple conical structure was estimated numerically to be approximately 1 - 2. However, the actual PP of the near-conical LV structure is in the range of 3. 3 - 4. And the question crops up: what is the cause of such a high PP of the LV? To investigate this, the LV is modeled physically and using the finite element software ANSYS. The modeling is based on a recent concept of Helical Ventricular Myocardial Band (HVMB), according to which the heart is made of a single band called the HVMB, which twists and loops to form the heart. Multiple goat hearts are dissected and unfolded into the HVMB. The shape of the band as well as the crude fiber orientation in its outermost (epicardium) and innermost (endocardium) layers are observed. The trace of the band together with the two-layer fiber orientation is recorded, and a Matlab program is written to numerically twist and loop the band into a simple and practical near conical two layer LV like FMC model. Polyurethane (Matrix material) and shape memory alloys (as actuating fibers) are used to physically construct the model. The experimental and analytical investigations yielded a reasonably high PP in the range of 2. 5 - 2. 8. Moreover, the twist phenomenon and wall <b>thickening</b> <b>effects,</b> which have been previously pointed out in literature to contribute to the high PP of the LV, were observed clearly in the simulations...|$|R

40|$|The role of {{the plate}} {{boundary}} in a continental collisional setting is investigated by lithospheric-scale analogue models. Key variables {{in this study are}} the degree of coupling at the plate interface and along the Moho of the lower plate as well as the geometry of the plate contact. They control the onset of intra plate deformation, orogenic architecture, amount of mantle lithosphere subduction and basin development. In all experiments, deformation initiates at the plate interface by the formation of a pop-up structure. A vertical plate boundary with respect to the shortening direction results in buckling of the lithosphere, whereas experiments with an inclined plate boundary show underthrusting and foreland basin development without orogenic wedge formation. Continental collision and coinciding mantle lithosphere subduction may occur only if the lower crust of the foreland plate is weak enough promoting crust-mantle decoupling. During decoupling the weak lower crust beneath the orogen thickens significantly by ductile flow as it detaches from the down going mantle lithosphere. This lower crustal <b>thickening</b> <b>effects</b> the distribution of upper crustal deformation and topography. Subduction of weak lower crust is favored when the weak plate interface has a significant thickness (~ 15 km in nature) and a high amount of shortening is applied. Increasing coupling at the plate interface through time leads to intra plate deformation by thickening and gentle folding and influences surface uplift and subsidence above the plate interface. The transition from a mechanically decoupled plate boundary with a significant amount of mantle lithosphere subduction towards stronger plate coupling resulting in intra plate deformation and topography development can be recorded in for instance the Caucasus, the Colombian Cordillera, the Pyrenees and the Alps. Thickening of the lower crust as portrayed for the Western Alps does not demand a strong, frictional-type behavior of the lower crust, but can also be the consequence of ductile processes. © 2009 Elsevier B.

40|$|Turbulent lean {{premixed}} combustion now plays a predominant role {{in reducing}} {{emission of pollutants}} such as NOx. For turbulent premixed flames located in the thin-reaction-zones regime, small-scale eddies could penetrate into the preheat zone of the flames and enhance the mixing process. In this study, the effects of small-scale turbulence on emission (NOx and CO) formation in premixed flame fronts are investigated through the incorporation of turbulence induced diffusion in the preheat zone of one-dimensional premixed flames. One-dimensional methane/air premixed flames are simulated with the 53 -species GRI-Mech 3. 0 mechanism at both atmospheric and engine conditions with different turbulence intensities. It is found that the NO generated in flame fronts deceases with increasing intensity of small-scale turbulence and the effect is more profound at high pressures. At high pressures, the turbulence induced diffusion in the preheat zone can reduce the NOx formation in flame fronts by more than 40 %. On the other hand, the CO mass fraction in flame fronts increases with increasing intensity of small-scale turbulence. In the cases considered, the CO mass fraction in the flame fronts can increase by more than 55 %. In addition, a flamelet-based approach that accounts for the flame <b>thickening</b> <b>effects</b> has been formulated to simulate NOx and CO formation in turbulent lean premixed combustion. In this approach, the species NO and CO are transported and solved in a simulation with chemical source terms being pre-calculated from 1 -D premixed flames with detailed chemical kinetics and turbulence induced diffusion. The NO source term can be quantified by its formation in flame fronts and its formation rate in post-flame region. The CO source term can be calculated through its mass fraction at flame fronts, its mass fraction in the post-flame region and an oxidation time scale. The effect of heat loss on NO formation has been studied by investigate the relation between post-flame NO formation rate and flame temperature. Meanwhile, the effect of turbulent-chemistry interaction on NO were studied. The flamelet-based emission model has been implemented into Fluent and 3 -Dimensional simulations were conducted in a combustion rig...|$|R
