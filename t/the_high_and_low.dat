5|$|The north–south {{orientation}} of the Andes creates a barrier for humid air masses coming from the Pacific Ocean, forming an extensive rain shadow and causing most of the region to be arid. South of 52°S, the Andes are lower in elevation, reducing the rain shadow effect in Tierra del Fuego Province and allowing forests to thrive on the Atlantic coast. Patagonia is located between the subtropical high pressure belt and the subpolar low pressure zone, meaning it is exposed to westerly winds that are strong, since south of 40°S there is little land to block these winds. Because Patagonia is located between the semi-permanent anticyclones of the Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean at around 30°S, and the Subpolar Low at around 60°S, the movement of <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>and</b> <b>low</b> pressure systems along with ocean currents determine the precipitation pattern.|$|E
5|$|Patagonia {{is located}} between the {{subtropical}} high pressure belt, and the subpolar low pressure zone, meaning it {{is exposed to}} westerly winds that are strong, since south of 40o S, there is little land to block these winds. Being located between the semipermanent South Pacific and the South Atlantic Highs at around 30oS, and the Subpolar Low at arount 60o S, the movement of <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>and</b> <b>low</b> pressure systems, along with ocean currents, determine the precipitation pattern. During winter, both the South Pacific and South Atlantic highs move to the north, while the Subpolar Low strengthens, which, when combined with higher ocean temperatures than the surrounding land, results in higher precipitation during {{this time of the}} year. Due to the northward migration of the South Pacific High, more frontal systems can pass through, allowing for more precipitation to occur. During summer, the South Pacific High migrates southward, preventing the passage of fronts, and cyclones that can cause precipitation to occur, resulting in lower precipitation during this time of the year. Northeastern areas, along with southern parts of the region, are influenced by air masses from the Atlantic Ocean, resulting in precipitation being more evenly distributed throughout the year. Most precipitation comes from frontal systems, particularly stationary fronts that bring humid air from the Atlantic Ocean.|$|E

The length of the reigns of Tuthmosis I and Tuthmosis II, however, cannot be determined with absolute certainty. With short reigns, Hatshepsut would have ascended the throne 14 years after the coronation of Tuthmosis I, her father. Longer reigns would put her ascension 25 years after Tuthmosis I's coronation. Thus, Hatshepsut could have assumed power as early as 1512 BC, or, as late as 1479 BC.|$|E
25|$|There {{has been}} some {{investigation}} into human CD36 as well. A study examined oral detection of fat in obese subjects with genetic bases for high, medium, and low expression of the CD36 receptor. Those subjects with high CD36 expression were eight times more sensitive to certain fats (oleic acid and triolein) than the subjects with low CD36 expression. Those subjects with an intermediate amount of CD36 expression were sensitive to fat at a level between <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>and</b> <b>low</b> groups. This study demonstrates {{that there is a}} significant relationship between oral fat sensitivity and the amount of CD36 receptor expression, but further investigation into CD36 could be useful for learning more about lipid tasting in the context of obesity, as CD36 may be a target for therapies in the future.|$|E
25|$|Under the system, {{points are}} awarded {{individually}} for each skating element, and {{the sum of}} these points is the total element score (TES). Competitive programs are constrained to have a set number of elements. Each element is judged first by a technical specialist who identifies the specific element and determines its base value. The technical specialist uses instant replay video to verify things that distinguish different elements; e.g., the exact foot position at take-off and landing of a jump. The decision of the technical specialist determines the base value of the element. A panel of twelve judges then each award a mark for the quality and execution of the element. This mark is called the grade of execution (GOE) that is an integer from −3 to +3. The GOE mark is then translated into another value by using the table of values in ISU rule 322. The GOE value from the twelve judges is then processed with a computerized random selection of nine judges, then discarding <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>and</b> <b>low</b> value, and finally averaging the remaining seven. This average value is then added to (or subtracted from) the base value to get the total value for the element.|$|E

25|$|There are {{currently}} three CGMS (continuous glucose monitoring system) available. The first is Medtronic's Minimed Paradigm RTS with a sub-cutaneous probe {{attached to a}} small transmitter (roughly {{the size of a}} quarter) that sends interstitial glucose levels to a small pager sized receiver every five minutes. The Dexcom System is another system, available in two different generations in the US, the G4 and the G5. (1Q 2016). It is a hypodermic probe with a small transmitter. The receiver {{is about the size of}} a cell phone and can operate up to twenty feet from the transmitter. The Dexcom G4 transmits via radio frequency and requires a dedicated receiver. The G5 version utilizes Bluetooth low energy for data transmission, and can transmit data directly to a compatible cellular telephone. Currently, only Apple's iPhone can be used as a receiver, but Dexcom is in the process of getting an Android version approved, and anticipates availability in the second half of 2016. Aside from a two-hour calibration period, monitoring is logged at five-minute intervals for up to 1 week. The user can set <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>and</b> <b>low</b> glucose alarms. The third CGMS available is the FreeStyle Navigator from Abbott Laboratories.|$|E

500|$|Critics {{raved about}} Carey {{performance}} following {{the completion of}} the ceremony, with Jon Pareles from The New York Times saying [...] "once she was worked up, she moaned, growled and swooped to <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>and</b> <b>low</b> extremes of her voice in [...] "Fly Like a Bird". A writer from USA Today complimented her recital of both songs, writing [...] "Carey certainly earned the right to savor the spotlight this year. But the diva made room for Walker's booming baritone in 'Bird', her fluttering homage to Minnie Ripperton." [...] Gary Susman from Entertainment Weekly called Carey the [...] "comeback queen" [...] and wrote [...] "Its what her voice did, soaring into the rafters like only Carey's can." [...] Roger Friedman from Fox News outed the performance as [...] "the number that sent the audience into a frenzy". On April9,2008, reality competition American Idol aired its second annual charity event, titled Idol Gives Back. Backed up by Randy Jackson on the bass, Carey appeared on stage as the last head-lining performer of the evening. Midway through the performance, a large church choir walked on stage in blue garbs, and provided the gospel climax for the song. Ann Powers from the Los Angeles Times called the song an [...] "inspirational show-stopper" [...] and felt Carey's vocal's were [...] "patented impossible notes". In regards to the performance, Katie Byrne from MTV News wrote [...] "Carey was at her over-the-top best, with a full gospel choir and the high notes that made her famous." [...] Aside from several televised performances, Carey included [...] "Fly Like a Bird" [...] on the set-lists of all her tours following its release. During Carey's The Adventures of Mimi Tour (2006) stop at Madison Square Garden, the song was dedicated to Ol' Dirty Bastard, who died in 2004 from an accidental drug overdose. The performance had to be re-done, as Carey's pastor, Clarence Keaton, missed his cue for the Biblical verses, and was forced to be found backstage and ushered to the spotlight. Four years later, Carey performed the song throughout her Angels Advocate Tour, only dedicating it to Keaton, who died on July3,2009. Editor and journalist Thomas Kintner from the Hartford Courant felt that during her live recital of [...] "Fly Like a Bird", Carey [...] "displayed power and sky-scraping pitch".|$|E
