5|$|Already 40 years old, Bacon {{viewed the}} {{exhibition}} as his last chance and applied {{himself to the}} task with determination. Because he had destroyed all his output {{of the last three}} years, he {{had little choice but to}} present new works. He did not have a grand plan when he agreed to the show, but eventually found themes <b>that</b> <b>interested</b> him in his Head I of the previous year, and executed five progressively stronger variants in the final weeks before the November exhibition, completing the series barely in time for the opening.|$|E
5|$|Chatwin's {{writing was}} shaped by {{his work as a}} {{cataloguer}} at Sotheby's, which provided him with years of practice writing concise yet vivid descriptions of objects with the intention of enticing buyers. In addition, Chatwin's interest in nomads also influenced his writing. One aspect of nomadic culture <b>that</b> <b>interested</b> him was the few possessions they had. Their spartan way of life appealed to his aesthetic sense, and it was something he sought to emulate in both his life and his writing. He strove to strip unnecessary objects from his life and unnecessary words from his prose.|$|E
5|$|Following in the {{footsteps}} of his father and grandfather, McCain entered the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis. He was a friend and informal leader there for many of his classmates, and sometimes stood up for targets of bullying. He also became a lightweight boxer. McCain did well in academic subjects <b>that</b> <b>interested</b> him, such as literature and history, but studied only enough to pass subjects that gave him difficulty, such as mathematics. He came into conflict with higher-ranking personnel and did not always obey the rules, which contributed to a low class rank (894 of 899), despite a high IQ. McCain graduated in 1958.|$|E
50|$|Economists {{generally}} thought <b>that</b> <b>interest</b> {{rates were}} correlated to {{the rate of}} inflation, whereas Keynes' findings contradicted this view. During the period of gold standard, he concluded <b>that</b> <b>interest</b> rates were correlated to the general price level, and not {{the rate of change}} in the prices. In fact, he thought <b>that</b> <b>interest</b> rates were highly correlated to the wholesale price index rather than the rate of inflation.|$|R

[...] If a partner contributes services for a profits <b>interest,</b> then <b>that</b> <b>interest</b> is not taxable upon {{the date of the}} exchange because any valuation would be too speculative unless it is for an asset that has low risk and a guaranteed return like a Treasury bill or the partner sells <b>that</b> <b>interest</b> within two years of the exchange.|$|R
5|$|Immediately {{before going}} to the Archives in autumn 2006, Farrar invited his Gob Iron {{collaborator}} Anders Parker to come with him and look over potential material and the two returned several times over a period of months gathering lyrics for composition before recording together starting on July 14, 2007. As they found lyrics <b>that</b> <b>interested</b> them, they had reproductions mailed to their homes from the Archives to work on the material at their leisure. The duo finished recording several songs throughout the year but did not have enough material to complete the album. The recordings were also made without a budget or record contract for release.|$|E
5|$|In {{retirement}} Denning {{moved to}} Whitchurch and continued {{the work he}} had done outside court hours, lecturing and presenting awards. He also on occasion dispensed legal advice; in February 1983 he advised Patrick Evershed on the statutory duties of water suppliers. Further hip troubles were resolved with a full replacement in March 1983, although a fall later that year forced him {{to stay at home}} for six weeks. With free time on his hands Denning spoke in the House of Lords on matters <b>that</b> <b>interested</b> him, supporting an amendment to the Abortion Act 1967 and bills designed to allow the administration of companies in financial difficulties.|$|E
5|$|As the Second World War loomed, the British Admiralty {{commissioned}} Lethbridge {{to undertake}} a reconnaissance mission to Iceland to analyse German naval activity around the country, which he carried out in summer 1939. Lethbridge however treated the mission with contempt, spending {{much of the time}} visiting sites <b>that</b> <b>interested</b> him, such as locations mentioned in the Icelandic Sagas. Back in Britain, he self-published a short volume discussing his Icelandic journey, News from Tili. As war broke out, Lethbridge organised the transfer of much of the museum's collections to Balsham Caves for safe keeping, while also becoming a warden of the Air Raid Precautions. He also led the rescue excavation of ten prehistoric tumuli that were being destroyed to enable the construction of Snailwell Airfield for the Royal Air Force.|$|E

5|$|Mondo Cane {{consists}} of Mike Patton's arrangements and performances of 1950s and 1960s Italian pop songs. Patton had heard these songs {{while living in}} Bologna; the singer had adopted {{the city as a}} second home after marrying Italian artist Titi Zuccatosta, and had become a fluent speaker of Italian. Patton began exploring Italian popular music; although initially wishing to listen to contemporary music, he found nothing <b>that</b> <b>interested</b> him. However, he became drawn to pop music from the 1950s and 1960s, intrigued by singers using orchestras for backing rather than pop bands. Having considered making an album covering these songs for some time, Patton initially believed he would approach the project with a small band, but was offered the chance to compose music for an orchestra. Patton then opted to use this opportunity to record Mondo Cane instead.|$|E
5|$|Soon after Berkman turned 12, {{his father}} died. The {{business}} {{had to be}} sold, and the family lost the right to live in Saint Petersburg. Yetta moved the family to Kovno, where her brother Nathan lived. Berkman had shown great promise {{as a student at}} the gymnasium, but his studies began to falter as he spent his time reading novels. One of the books <b>that</b> <b>interested</b> him was Ivan Turgenev's novel Fathers and Sons (1862), with its discussion of nihilist philosophy. But what truly moved him was Nikolay Chernyshevsky's 1863 novel, What Is to Be Done?, and Berkman felt inspired by Rakhmetov, its puritanical protagonist who is willing to sacrifice personal pleasure and family ties in single-minded pursuit of his revolutionary aims.|$|E
5|$|On October 25, 2011, the HDMI Forum was {{established}} by the HDMI founders to create an open organization so <b>that</b> <b>interested</b> companies can participate {{in the development of}} the HDMI specification. All members of the HDMI Forum have equal voting rights, may participate in the Technical Working Group, and if elected can be on the Board of Directors. There is no limit to the number of companies allowed in the HDMI Forum though companies must pay an annual fee of US$15,000 with an additional annual fee of $5,000 for those companies who serve on the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors will be made up of 11 companies who are elected every 2 years by a general vote of HDMI Forum members. All future development of the HDMI specification will take place in the HDMI Forum and will be built upon the HDMI 1.4b specification. Also on the same day HDMI Licensing, LLC announced that there were over 1,100 HDMI adopters and that over 2 billion HDMI-enabled products had shipped since the launch of the HDMI standard. From October 25, 2011, all development of the HDMI specification became the responsibility of the newly created HDMI Forum.|$|E

2500|$|Examining the State's {{interest}} in the matter, Reynolds found that while Wisconsin surely had a legitimate <b>interest</b> in counseling, <b>that</b> <b>interest</b> was not perceived as a compelling interest. [...] While he found <b>that</b> the State's <b>interest</b> in child welfare was potentially compelling, <b>that</b> <b>interest</b> was insufficient because the Wisconsin statute was not connected to the restriction imposed by the statute. [...] As the Wisconsin law could not withstand strict scrutiny, Reynolds declared the law unconstitutional.|$|R

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} early Jewish philosophers influenced by Islamic philosophy is Rav Saadia Gaon (892â€“942). His most important work is Emunoth ve-Deoth (Book of Beliefs and Opinions). In this work Saadia treats of the questions <b>that</b> <b>interested</b> the Mutakallimun so deeplyâ€”such as the creation of matter, the unity of God, the divine attributes, the soul, etc.â€”and he criticizes the philosophers severely.|$|E
25|$|Three {{years later}} in 1768, he focused on a new project to design an aqueduct. The goal was to bring in water from the river Yvette into Paris so that the {{citizens}} could have clean drinking water. But, since the construction never commenced, he instead turned his focus to purifying {{the water from the}} Seine. This was the project <b>that</b> <b>interested</b> Lavoisier in the chemistry of water and public sanitation duties.|$|E

25|$|Because the {{perception}} {{was that the}} Alliance for Progress was a failure, shortly after taking office, on February 17, 1969, President Richard Nixon commissioned a study to assess the state of Latin America. Nixon appointed his most powerful political rival, New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller to direct the study. The poor {{relationship between the two}} politicians suggested that Nixon would not be <b>that</b> <b>interested</b> in the results of the study. There was a lack of interest for the region in the late 1960s to early 1970s.|$|E
25|$|Quaestiones quaedam philosophicae (Certain {{philosophical}} questions) is {{the name}} given {{to a set of}} notes that Isaac Newton kept for himself during his early years in Cambridge. They concern questions in the natural philosophy of the day <b>that</b> <b>interested</b> him. Apart from the light it throws on the formation of his own agenda for research, the major interest in these notes is the documentation of the unaided development of the scientific method in the mind of Newton, whereby every question is put to experimental test.|$|E
25|$|Devastated by {{the death}} of his wife, Weygers decided to abandon {{engineering}} for art. Alex studied sculpture at the Seattle Institute of Art under sculptor Avard Fairbanks. He created one of his most notable sculptures, Mourning that caught the attention of world-renowned sculptor, Lorado Taft in which he won a scholarship at Lorado Taft Midway Studios in Chicago. Following that he studied various aspects of art in the European centers that were renowned for the areas <b>that</b> <b>interested</b> him. Moving to California in the 1930s, he established a studio in Berkeley and began teaching.|$|E

25|$|He {{developed}} a reputation as being very friendly with children. He carried candy in his pockets for the street urchins in Mantua and Venice, and taught catechism to them. During papal audiences, he would gather children around him {{and talk to them}} about things <b>that</b> <b>interested</b> them. His weekly catechism lessons in the courtyard of San Damaso in the Vatican always included a special place for children, and his decision to require the Confraternity of Christian Doctrine in every parish was partly motivated by a desire to reclaim children from religious ignorance.|$|E
25|$|In 1876 he was {{appointed}} as Travelling Naturalist to the National Museum in Rio de Janeiro. This was the ideal post for him: it gave {{him the opportunity to}} range over the whole of the ItajaÃ­ system and study anything <b>that</b> <b>interested</b> him. A series of reports published in the Archivos of the National Museum record this work. He was a contemporary of several other foreign naturalists who were invited to work there by the Director of the National Museum, Ladislau Netto, such as Ã‰mil Goeldi and Hermann von Ihering.|$|E

The Committee had two related goals: (1) President Bill Clinton should publicly apologize for past government wrongdoing related to the study and (2) the Committee and relevant federal agencies should develop a strategy to redress the damages.|$|E
