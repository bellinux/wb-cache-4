5|$|England {{adopted an}} {{aggressive}} {{strategy in the}} second Test, but could not avoid a second defeat. Yardley frequently changed his bowlers to unsettle the Australians in their first innings, and <b>took</b> <b>two</b> for 35 himself as England briefly held the advantage.

Yardley <b>took</b> <b>two</b> wickets in two balls in Australia's second innings, narrowly missing a hat-trick when Keith Miller only just got his bat down on the ball to avoid being bowled, and had figures of two for 36, but Australia scored 460 for seven and bowled England out for 186.

They scored 174 for three before declaring, but rain intervened to prevent Yardley pushing for a win.|$|E
