5|$|Callisto's leading {{hemisphere}} is less reflective {{than its}} trailing hemisphere, which could indicate <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> sides {{has a higher}} surface temperature. On this darker, warmer side, sublimation rates of its icy surface would also be higher, causing more water vapor to be released into the atmosphere. This process would ultimately produce more hydrogen, which might explain the aforementioned variance in Callisto's atmospheric hydrogen levels.|$|E

5|$|The {{concept for}} Super Mario Galaxys {{gameplay}} originated from ideas taken from Super Mario 128, a technology demonstration shown at Nintendo Space World in 2000 to exemplify the processing {{power of the}} GameCube. The demonstration's director (and future director of Super Mario Galaxy), Yoshiaki Koizumi, desired <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> distinguishing features, spherical-based platforms, {{should be used in}} a future game, but was held back in belief that such a feature would be impossible for technical reasons. Super Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto suggested to work on the next large-scale Mario game after Nintendo EAD Tokyo finished development on Donkey Kong Jungle Beat in late 2004, pushing for the spherical platform concept to be realised. A prototype of the game's physics system took three months to build, where it was decided that the game's use of spherical platforms would best be suited to planetoids in an outer space environment, with the concept of gravity as a major feature. During development, the designers would often exchange ideas with Miyamoto from his office in Kyoto, where he would make suggestions to the game design. According to Koizumi, many ideas were conceived before development of the Wii console itself begun.|$|E

Some modern treatments add a sixth postulate, the rigidity of the triangle, which can be used as an alternative to superposition.|$|E

While the House of Commons entrance was surrounded by railings, it offered only minimal parking space and minimal security from attack, and practically no means of escape in the event of an attack. In contrast Leinster House was located well in from the streets that surrounded it, had considerable parking potential and was far more secure in the event of an anti-treaty republican attack on the Free State Dáil and Seanad.|$|E

25|$|The Missouri Synod's {{original}} constitution stated <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> purposes is {{to strive}} toward uniformity in practice, while more recent changes to those documents also encourage responsible and doctrinally sound diversity. The synod requires that hymns, songs, liturgies, and practices be {{in harmony with}} the Bible and Book of Concord. Worship in Missouri Synod congregations is generally thought of as orthodox and liturgical, utilizing a printed order of service and hymnal, and is typically accompanied by a pipe organ or piano. The contents of LCMS hymnals from the past, such as The Lutheran Hymnal and Lutheran Worship, and those of its newest hymnal, Lutheran Service Book, highlight the synod's unwavering stance towards more traditional styles of hymnody and liturgy. More traditional LCMS Lutherans point to the Lutheran Confessions in their defense of liturgical worship.|$|E
