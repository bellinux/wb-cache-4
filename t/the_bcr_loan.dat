40|$|AbstractThe CD 19 /CD 21 complex {{functions}} to significantly enhance B cell antigen receptor (BCR) signaling {{in response to}} complement-tagged antigens. Recent studies showed that following antigen binding <b>the</b> <b>BCR</b> translocates into plasma membrane lipid rafts that serve as platforms for BCR signaling. Here, we show that the binding of complement-tagged antigens stimulates the translocation of both <b>the</b> <b>BCR</b> and <b>the</b> CD 19 /CD 21 complex into lipid rafts, resulting in prolonged residency in and signaling from the rafts, as compared to BCR cross-linking alone. When coligated to <b>the</b> <b>BCR,</b> <b>the</b> CD 19 /CD 21 complex retards the internalization and degradation of <b>the</b> <b>BCR.</b> <b>The</b> colocalization and stabilization of <b>the</b> <b>BCR</b> and <b>the</b> CD 19 /CD 21 complex in plasma membrane lipid rafts represents a novel mechanism by which a coreceptor enhances BCR signaling...|$|R

40|$|The binding of antigen to the B cell antigen {{receptor}} (<b>BCR)</b> results in <b>the</b> activation of protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) such as Lyn and Syk, and the phosphorylation of several substrate proteins including HS 1 and SLP- 65. How these signaling elements {{are connected to}} <b>the</b> <b>BCR</b> is not well understood. Using an expression vector for a tamoxifen-regulated Cre recombinase, we have developed a method that allows the inducible expression of <b>the</b> <b>BCR.</b> Disruption of <b>the</b> VH leader reading frame of the immunoglobulin heavy chain by two loxP sites is overcome by Cre-mediated DNA recombination and results in the cell surface expression of <b>the</b> <b>BCR</b> starting 4 h after exposure of transfected B cells to tamoxifen. This method can, in principle, be employed for the inducible expression of any secreted or type I transmembrane protein. By monitoring the activation of signaling elements in pervanadate-stimulated B cells expressing different levels of <b>the</b> <b>BCR,</b> we show here that phosphorylation of SLP- 65 and Syk, but not of Lyn, is strictly dependent on the expression of <b>the</b> <b>BCR</b> on <b>the</b> cell surface.

40|$|The B-cell antigen {{receptor}} (BCR) {{is one of}} the most abundant receptors on the surface of B cells with roughly 100, 000 - 200, 000 copies per cell. Signaling through <b>the</b> <b>BCR</b> is crucial for the activation and differentiation of B cells. Unlike other receptors, <b>the</b> <b>BCR</b> can be activated by a large set of structurally different ligands, but the molecular mechanism of BCR activation is still a matter of controversy. Although dominant for a long time, the cross-link model (CLM) of BCR activation is not supported by recent studies of the nanoscale organization of <b>the</b> <b>BCR</b> on <b>the</b> surface of resting B cells.

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>bcr</b> 1 - and bcr 3 - promyelocytic leukemia/retinoic acid {{receptor}} alpha (PML/RAR alpha) are the {{two major}} fusion proteins expressed in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) patients. These proteins, which are present in different lengths of PML (amino acids 1 - 552 and 1 - 394, respectively), contain most of the functional domains of PML and RAR alpha, bind all-trans-retinoic acid (t-RA), and act as t-RA-dependent transcription factors, T-RA is an effective inducer of clinical remission only in patients carrying the t(15; 17) and expressing the PML/RAR alpha products. However, in APL patients achieving complete remission with t-RA therapy <b>the</b> <b>bcr</b> 3 -PML/RAR alpha product has been found associated with a poorer prognosis than bcr 1 -PML/RAR alpha. In the present study we have investigated the structural and functional properties of <b>the</b> <b>bcr</b> 3 -PML/RAR alpha in comparison to <b>the</b> previously characterized <b>bcr</b> 1 -PML/RAR alpha. In particular, we have measured the binding properties of the two endogenous ligands t-RA and 9 -cis-RA to both of these isoforms. T-RA binding analysis of nuclear and cytosolic extracts prepared from bcr 3 -PML/RAR alpha APL patients and from bcr 3 -PML/RAR alpha COS- 1 transfected cells indicates that this protein is present only as high-molecular-weight nuclear complexes. Using saturation binding assays and Scatchard analyses we found that t-RA binds with slightly less affinity to <b>the</b> <b>bcr</b> 3 -PML/RAR alpha receptor than to bcr 1 -PML/RAR alpha or RAR alpha (Kd = 0. 4 nmol/L, 0. 13 nmol/L or 0. 09 nmol/L, respectively). Moreover, two different high-affinity 9 -cis-RA binding sites (Kd = 0. 45 and 0. 075 nmol/L) were detectable in <b>the</b> <b>bcr</b> 3 -PML/RAR alpha product but not in <b>the</b> <b>bcr</b> 1 -PML/RAR alpha product (Kd = 0. 77 nmol/L). By competition binding experiments we showed that 9 -cis-RA binds with higher specificity to <b>the</b> <b>bcr</b> 3 -PML/RAR alpha isoform than to <b>the</b> <b>bcr</b> 1 -PML/RAR alpha or RAR alpha. Consistent with these data, the binding of 9 -cis-RA to <b>the</b> <b>bcr</b> 3 -PML/RAR alpha product resulted in increased transcriptional activation of the RA-responsive element (RARE) TRE, but not of the beta RARE, in transiently transfected COS- 1 cells.

50|$|In B cell signaling, PI 3-kinase is {{recruited}} to <b>the</b> <b>BCR</b> early in <b>the</b> signal transduction pathway.

PLC-γ2 is then phosphorylated by Syk on one site and Btk on two sites.

40|$|The B cell antigen {{receptor}} (BCR) plays {{a crucial role}} in adaptive immunity, since antigen-induced signaling by <b>the</b> <b>BCR</b> leads to <b>the</b> activation of the B cell and production of antibodies during an immune response.

In contrast, a transmembrane mutant of the mIgD molecule only formed IgD-BCR dimers. Our approach complements high resolution fluorescence imaging and clearly demonstrates the existence of pre-formed BCR clusters on resting B cells, questioning the classical cross-linking model of BCR activation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe B cell antigen {{receptor}} (BCR) functions to initiate signaling and to internalize antigen for processing from within Lyn kinase-enriched membrane lipid rafts.
