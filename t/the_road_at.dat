5|$|Construction of I-380 took 12 {{years to}} complete, ending in 1985. After the interstate opened, US218 was moved onto the new freeway. In the 1990s, the I-380 {{corridor}} {{was selected as}} part of the Avenue of the Saints corridor, which Iowa designated as Iowa Highway 27 in 2001. I-380 has been affected by two major floods, the Great Flood of 1993 and the Iowa flood of 2008, both of which closed <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>at</b> the Iowa River for two weeks.|$|E

Braham managed to conduct a safe landing.|$|E
5|$|Degraded by revolt and fifth-column activity, the 27th Infantry Division Savska {{numbered}} about 2,000 effectives {{when the}} German attack began.

5|$|For the breakout, the Marines {{formed into}} a convoy {{with a single}} M4A3 Sherman tank as the lead.

5|$|North Korean troops {{promptly}} set up {{a roadblock}} directly behind the 19th Infantry's line in its main route of supply along the road {{near the village of}} Tuman, just south of Yusong on Taejon's western outskirts. The roadblock quickly became a serious problem for U.S. forces trying to move ammunition and wounded to and from the Kum River line. Around 13:00 on July 16, the 19th Infantry Regimental commander contacted Dean, who ordered him to break the roadblock. However, North Korean troops had {{set up a}}t least six machine-gun nests above <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>at</b> Tuman, and repeated attacks against it were unable to drive the North Korean troops away.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the track}} was {{reported}} clear of debris, the safety car was withdrawn {{and the race}} restarted on lap five. Jonathan Palmer, commentating alongside Murray Walker for the BBC, remarked how quick Schumacher was, as {{his time in the}} warm-up session on Sunday morning gave rise to speculation {{that he was going to}} make one pit stop and, therefore, race with a heavier car than Senna, who was planning to make two, as was conventional. Martin Brundle had told BBC presenter Steve Rider that McLaren were going to make two stops. On the second lap after the restart, with Ayrton Senna leading Michael Schumacher, Senna's car left <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>at</b> the Tamburello corner, and after slowing from 190mph (306km/h) to 131mph (211km/h), hit the concrete wall, with debris flying into the path of the other drivers.|$|E

5|$|The section {{through the}} Naomikong Point area was built {{starting}} in 1967 by the Michigan State Highway Department {{under contract to}} the USFS. <b>The</b> <b>road,</b> <b>at</b> the time, {{was intended to be}} part of a longer scenic highway that would connect a proposed lakeshore road through the Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore with roads running along Whitefish Bay and the St. Marys River south of Sault Ste.

The last section was paved in 1987 between the two paved sections at Naomikong and Iroquois points.|$|E
5|$|After they {{captured}} the 2011 national championship, the Crimson Tide signed a highly rated recruiting class in February 2012 and completed spring practice the following April.

The Crimson Tide opened the season with nine consecutive victories that included one over Michigan at a neutral site and a come-from-behind victory on <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>at</b> Louisiana State University (LSU). In their tenth game, Alabama was upset by Texas A, and dropped to the number four position in the rankings. However, after a series of upsets and victories in their final three games that included winning the SEC Championship over Georgia, Alabama qualified for the 2013 BCS National Championship Game against Notre Dame, where they won 42–14 and {{captured the}} 2012 national championship.|$|E

5|$|CR106 {{originated}} in 1824, when {{the road was}} chartered for the New Turnpike and headed from Monroe to Haverstraw. Back in the 1820s, what is now Southfields was known as Monroe. The New Turnpike started at a nail factory in Monroe to a crossing over the Ramapo River, and progressed eastward, passing Lake Stahahe (then known as Car Pond). The turnpike continued eastward, meeting the Old Turnpike at a fork in <b>the</b> <b>road.</b> <b>At</b> the fork, part of the road became NY210 in the 1930 New York State Route renumbering. In 1910, when the park opened, the road {{became known as the}} Southfields Road. Three years later, it became part of the Seven Lakes Drive. Three more years later, the route became known as County Highway416. In 1919 and 1920, the western section of the road was reconstructed. After a bridge was built to cross a river in 1923, a new route, making up part of the original Warwick Turnpike, became NY17A.|$|E
5|$|Coming {{into the}} 1995 season, Hill {{was one of}} the title favourites. The Williams team were reigning constructors' champions, having beaten Benetton in 1994, and with young David Coulthard, who was embarking on his first full season in Formula One, as team-mate, Hill was the clear number one driver. The year started badly when he spun off in Brazil due to a {{mechanical}} problem, but wins in the next two races put him in the championship lead. However, Schumacher won seven of the next twelve races, and took his second title with two races to spare, while Benetton took the constructors' championship. Schumacher and Hill had several on-track incidents during the season, two of which led to suspended one-race bans. Schumacher's penalty was for blocking and forcing Hill off <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>at</b> the Belgian Grand Prix; Hill's was for colliding with Schumacher under braking at the Italian Grand Prix. Hill's season finished positively when he won the Australian Grand Prix by finishing two laps ahead of the runner-up, Olivier Panis in a Ligier.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{began on}} July 1, 1928, with convict labor for the easier {{portions}} and contractors for the remainder, {{as well as}} bridges and tunnels, but was slowed by the Great Depression. On the most difficult portion, between Cresta and Rock Creek, three tunnels had to be built at Arch Rock, Grizzly Dome, and Elephant Butte; at the former two, surveyors had to hang out on rope over steep granite slopes, and rockslides repeatedly caused delays. The commission dedicated <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>at</b> a ceremony at Grizzly Dome, halfway between the ends, on August 14, 1937. Construction had cost $8.15 million for 78 miles (126km) of new road. The remainder of the old trail from Quincy to the junction with Route 29 (now U.S. 395) east of Beckwourth Pass {{was added to the}} state highway system in 1931 as an extension of Route 21, and was paved by 1936. A new Route 87 was created in 1933, stretching from Woodland via Marysville and Oroville to Route 3 (State Route 99) southeast of Chico, including the present SR 70 between Marysville and Oroville. Route 87 from Woodland to Oroville and Route 21 from Oroville to east of Beckwourth Pass became a new State Route 24 in 1934; State Route 24 was extended southwest from Woodland to Oakland by the end of 1937.|$|E
