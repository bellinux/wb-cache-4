5|$|Allen's {{exploits}} {{in those}} years {{introduced him to the}} wrong side of the justice system, which would become a recurring feature of his life. In one incident, he and his brother Heman went to the farm of a neighbor, some of whose pigs had escaped onto their land, and seized the pigs. <b>The</b> <b>neighbor</b> sued to have the animals returned to him; Allen pleaded his own case, and lost. Allen and Heman were fined ten shillings, and <b>the</b> <b>neighbor</b> was awarded another five shillings in damages. He was also called to court in Salisbury for inoculating himself against smallpox, a procedure that at the time required the sanction of the town selectmen.|$|E

5|$|Rand {{did not use}} a {{specific}} architect {{as a model for}} Keating. Her inspiration for the character came from a neighbor she knew while working in Hollywood in the early 1930s. Rand asked this young woman to explain her goals in life. The woman's response was focused on social comparisons: <b>the</b> <b>neighbor</b> wanted her material possessions and social standing to equal or exceed those of other people. Rand created Keating as an archetype of this motivation, which she saw as the opposite of self-interest.|$|E

5|$|About 10 a.m., one of Desha's neighbors {{encountered}} the riderless gray mare, still rigged with saddle and bridle. Catching the horse, he rode {{it up the}} road, shortly finding Desha's riderless bay (which he recognized), with a saddle but no bridle. He noticed blood on the neck and withers of Desha's horse. Further along, <b>the</b> <b>neighbor</b> encountered Desha on foot, carrying two saddlebags. Desha {{said that he had}} just accepted the gray mare as payment from a man who owed him money. He did not volunteer how the two horses had escaped his control, but mounted the gray mare and returned home. Later that day, friends at Desha's tannery noticed that he was unusually quiet and repeatedly asked what was wrong. He said that he had been kicked by a horse and severely cut his finger in separate incidents the previous day.|$|E
5|$|In December 2006, HSA sold Briskeby {{to a new}} company, Briskeby Gressbane AS (BG), {{which was}} owned 50 percent each by Ham-Kam and HSA. Another company, Briskeby Eiendom 1 AS (BE1), was {{established}} and owned 66 percent by HSA and 34 percent by BG. The latter was also given 50 percent of the shares in Hamar stadion. BG was non-commercial and was to own the stadium itself, while BE1 was commercial and was to rent out the commercial property. The two shared board, managing director and accountant. In May 2007, NCC was awarded the contract to build the new venue by BG and BE1. Although NCC was NOK8 million {{more expensive than the}} cheapest bid, they offered four months shorter construction time. Briskeby's lot needed to be expanded, which was done by purchasing neighbor lots for NOK34 million. Hamar stadion and <b>the</b> <b>neighbor</b> lot Fuglsetmyra were sold for NOK295 million in June 2007, of which NOK9 million was paid to BG and another NOK175 million was a guarantee which would be paid after the lot was re-regulated.|$|E

Kodandaram, now handicapped from a hunting accident and confined to a wheelchair, lives with his wife Padma, daughter-in-law Sowmya, and daughters Radha and Pavani. Sowmya is widowed and teaches the village children; Radha, a student of Ayurveda, practices it alongside looking over the family's farming land; and Pavani is a student doing her pre-university course. Ganesh, a foodie, is fascinated with learning of Kodandaram's hunting spoils and persuades him to join them in hunting the very wild boar that left his legs crippled two years ago. At the forest, Kodandaram accidentally shoots Diganth in the chest, but is saved by a gong he had worn around his neck. They embark on another and final venture to kill the boar. As the boar approaches a rifle-wielding and wheelchair-bound Kodandaram, he gets up on his feet as an impulse and refuses to shoot it, thankful for bringing him back to his feet again, and calls it an incarnation of varaha.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Neighbors</b> {{initially}} received negative {{treatment from}} critics, but gained increasing critical praise {{as the season}} aired. Writing for the San Francisco Chronicle, David Wiegand thought that <b>The</b> <b>Neighbors</b> did not look [...] "promising" [...] {{as it was a}} high-concept show. Wiegand compared it to the NBC science fiction comedy series 3rd Rock from the Sun, claiming that the series' creator made it so different from 3rd Rock from the Sun, that it is [...] "weird". He stated that if <b>The</b> <b>Neighbors</b> garnered low ratings, it could possibly be replaced with Family Tools, an ABC comedy that is scheduled to air in mid-season. He compared it to other comedies set to air on the same channel writing that those are better than <b>The</b> <b>Neighbors.</b> According to Wiegand, <b>The</b> <b>Neighbors</b> seems like Outsourced, which aired for one season on NBC.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> false nearest <b>neighbor</b> {{algorithm}} is an algorithm for estimating the embedding dimension. The concept was proposed by Kennel et al. The main {{idea is to}} examine how <b>the</b> number of <b>neighbors</b> of a point along a signal trajectory change with increasing embedding dimension. In too low an embedding dimension, many of <b>the</b> <b>neighbors</b> will be false, but in an appropriate embedding dimension or higher, <b>the</b> <b>neighbors</b> are real. With increasing dimension, <b>the</b> false <b>neighbors</b> {{will no longer be}} neighbors. Therefore, by examining how <b>the</b> number of <b>neighbors</b> change as a function of dimension, an appropriate embedding can be determined.|$|R

25|$|It is {{a custom}} {{in the region}} of Banat that, after Christmas Eve dinner, groups of {{children}} go from house to house of their neighborhood and sing to neighbors. This custom is called korinđanje, and the children who participate in it are called korinđaši. They knock on a neighbor's door or ring the doorbell; when <b>the</b> <b>neighbor</b> comes out they greet him, and ask if they are allowed to sing. If the answer is affirmative, they sing a children's ditty or the Troparion of the Nativity.

40|$|Abstract. A {{challenge}} in resource-constrained sensor networks {{is to provide}} secure communication in an efficient manner, even {{in the presence of}} denial-of-service attacks. In this paper, we present a simple protocol for secret maintenance between a pair of network neighbors. We prove that Dolev-Yao adversaries cannot compromise the current secret shared by <b>the</b> <b>neighbors,</b> nor can they cause <b>the</b> <b>neighbors</b> to unduly waste resources. Moreover, we show that if the current secret between the pair is somehow disclosed, previous secrets are not compromised nor can future secrets be compromised. Finally, we propose several ways of bootstrapping the initial secrets of <b>the</b> <b>neighbors...</b>|$|R
50|$|It is also possible, {{but not as}} efficient, to use {{adjacency}} lists to {{test whether}} an edge exists or does not exist between two specified vertices. In an adjacency list in which <b>the</b> <b>neighbors</b> of each vertex are unsorted, testing {{for the existence of}} an edge may be performed in time proportional to the minimum degree of the two given vertices, by using a sequential search through <b>the</b> <b>neighbors</b> of this vertex. If <b>the</b> <b>neighbors</b> are represented as a sorted array, binary search may be used instead, taking time proportional to the logarithm of the degree.|$|R
