5|$|In {{the typical}} CG approach, {{the duties of}} 2D and 3D artists are distinct. The 2D artists <b>think</b> <b>up</b> and sketch out the characters' appearances; the 3D artists create the models based on these concept sketches. For Karas, these artists worked {{together}} in these areas to create the imagery seen in the show. To encourage this and establish consistency between images based on 2D and 3D processes, the 2D drawings incorporate styles typically found in 3D models. Animators also touched up or enhanced by hand, sequences involving the models. Eko's karas form was mainly a 3D model but his skirt was hand drawn. During later stages of editing, the team spaced hand drawn frames among 3D-rendered frames to enhance the fusion of styles. The production did not use motion capture techniques. Animators drew out action scenes based on their feelings, inspirations, and observations. 3D and 2D animation and special effects director, Takashi Hashimoto explained companies typically reduce their animators' workload by using CG for long shots and drawing only close-ups by hand. The team working on Karas, however, drew silhouettes for long shots and created complicated CG for close-ups. The 3D animators used 3D texture software, BodyPaint 3D, to refine textures for the mikura and karas models, creating seamless details on them.|$|E

A cover of the song (performed by the band <b>Think</b> <b>Up</b> Anger with Malia J) was featured in one of the trailers for the 2015 film The Gallows. In the 2015 film Pan, a version of the song is sung by Blackbeard (Hugh Jackman) and the miners when Peter first arrives in Neverland.|$|E
500|$|In {{his attempt}} to <b>think</b> <b>up</b> a new game, Naismith was guided by three main thoughts. Firstly, he {{analyzed}} the most popular games of those times (rugby, [...] lacrosse, soccer, football, hockey, and baseball); Naismith noticed the hazards of a ball {{and concluded that the}} big soft soccer ball was safest. Secondly, he saw that most physical contact occurred while running with the ball, dribbling or hitting it, so he decided that passing was the only legal option. Finally, Naismith further reduced body contact by making the goal unguardable, namely placing it high above the player's heads. To score goals, he forced the players to throw a soft lobbing shot that had proven effective in his old favorite game duck on a rock. Naismith christened this new game [...] "Basket Ball" [...] and put his thoughts together in 13 basic rules.|$|E

500|$|Rogen {{commented that}} he and Goldberg wanted to show with the episode how Hollywood {{generally}} ruins superhero films. He said that [...] "the whole joke is that Homer is cast to play a guy who's an everyman and {{they try to make}} him into this physically fit guy." [...] Rogen also noted that the plot mirrors the situation he was in while working on the film The Green Hornet, when he had to lose weight and do physical training for his role. Show runner Al Jean commented that the writers tried not to repeat the comic book film theme from the [...] "Radioactive Man" [...] episode. Instead they decided to parody the fact that almost every comic book {{has been turned into a}} film. Jean commented that that scene in the episode in which the studio executives [...] "are trying to <b>think</b> <b>up</b> an idea that hasn't been done really is what they are doing these days [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|When {{writing the}} story, Uchikoshi {{made use of}} what he calls the [...] "inductive {{composition}} method", where a setting is created first, after which one thinks about a core to the story {{that can be used to}} make the setting work. He did not recommend this way of writing, as he saw it as gamble that might not have resulted in an interesting story. This is in contrast to the deductive composition method, where a core story is thought of first, after which a setting is [...] "deduced", that matches the core. As an example of inductive composition used, Uchikoshi did not initially <b>think</b> <b>up</b> the story's [...] "main trick", and instead created two protagonists only because he thought it was getting stale with single-protagonist stories in visual novels, after which he thought about how to make two protagonists interesting. The writers only put little effort into hiding the 17-year gap between the Kid's and Takeshi's routes, writing each day of the story casually without a particular plan in mind. Rather, it took special effort to make it seem convincing when the game's secrets were revealed, with hints toward the truth added throughout the story, such as Tsugumi acting more suspicious when playing as the Kid due to having already experienced the events of Takeshi's route, or slight differences between the Kid's and Takeshi's routes due to the characters not being able to perfectly recreate events. While Coco was planned from the beginning as the character who knew the truth, Uchikoshi did not come up with the idea of leaving her on the bottom of the ocean until during the writing of the script.|$|E

Alvin Beam reviewed it for the Cleveland Plain Dealer, writing, [...] "Editors, like novelists, have brain children—books they <b>think</b> <b>up</b> and bring to life without putting their own names on the title page.

In response, Graham stated: [...] "Back then, broadcasters just weren't comfortable with something like that, something that wasn't set in the real world and that had a fantasy element to it." [...] According to Graham, the initial idea was for a humorous, pre-watershed programme that overtly mocked the styles and attitudes of the 1970s, with the comic actor Neil Morrissey envisaged as the central character.|$|E
