5|$|Pre-release {{audience}} tracking in the United States {{indicated that}} the film had strong awareness among males of all ages, followed by older women. Universal Pictures projected opening takings of $2530million during the opening weekend aiming below expectations due to a slow marketplace with rival studios claiming that the film would need to make at least $30million <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>success.</b>|$|E
5|$|Chapman {{was born}} in Leicester and was raised in Melton Mowbray. He enjoyed science, acting, and comedy, and after graduating from Emmanuel College, Cambridge, and St Bartholomew's Medical College, he turned down {{a career as a}} doctor to be a comedian. Chapman {{eventually}} established a writing partnership with John Cleese, which reached its critical peak with Monty Python in the 1970s. Chapman subsequently left Britain for Los Angeles, where he attempted <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>success</b> on American television, speaking on the college circuit and producing the pirate film Yellowbeard, before returning to Britain in the early 1980s.|$|E

The product {{was an attempt}} to introduce a between-meals snack to KFC, and was marketed towards teenagers. In April 2010, the Double Down sandwich was launched. Criticised as an unhealthy product, it featured two pieces of fried chicken in lieu of a conventional bread bun. It has proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>success</b> for the company, with 15 million Double Downs sold worldwide between March 2011 and March 2013.

Fifteen-year-old Sem Veeger, lead actress in the film Keep Off (2006), said she knew that many people had seen the film, but she did not expect it to receive a Golden Film.|$|R
5|$|In December, City manager Stuart Pearce {{publicly}} {{stated that}} Samaras {{would have to}} 'toughen up', if he wanted <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>success</b> in the Premier League. He said that Samaras' all round game wasn't good enough, {{and that he would}} need to learn to pass the ball better and compete more effectively. Some fans had criticised Pearce for signing Samaras, along with other foreign players, who had not settled in well enough to the English game. On 2 January, Samaras came on as a half-time substitute, and scored twice, as they beat Everton 2–1.|$|E
5|$|Shore {{composed}} a main theme for The Fellowship rather than many different character themes, and its strength and weaknesses in volume are depicted {{at different points}} in the series. On top of that, individual themes were composed to represent different cultures. Infamously, the amount of music Shore had to write every day for the third film increased dramatically to around seven minutes. The music for the series turned out <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>success</b> and has been voted best movie soundtrack of all time for the six years running, passing up Schindler's list, Gladiator, Star Wars (1977), and Out of Africa respectively.|$|E
5|$|Since Juster did {{the cooking}} for the housemates, if Feiffer wanted to eat, {{he had to}} do the drawings. Feiffer quickly {{realized}} the book would require illustrations of the type and quality that John Tenniel had created for Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and although a nationally-known artist, doubted his competence to do the text justice. Feiffer considers the double-spread illustration of demons late in the book <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>success</b> and one of his favorites. It differs from his usual style (which would involve a white background), and instead uses Gustave Doré's drawings as an inspiration.|$|E

This move to such a large stadium proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> outstanding <b>success,</b> with the Grand Final held there. The average attendance rose to 27,728 for the 2006–07 season, 10,000 above the next highest in the A-League.|$|R

5|$|Though Ziegfeld {{anticipated}} {{opening his}} new theatre on Sixth Avenue with Show Boat, the epic {{nature of the}} work required an unusually long gestation period and extensive changes during out-of-town tryouts. Impatient with Kern and Hammerstein and worried about the serious tone of the musical (he strongly disliked the songs Ol' Man River and Mis'ry's Comin' Around), Ziegfeld decided to open his theatre in February 1927 with Rio Rita, a musical by Kern's collaborator Guy Bolton. When Rio Rita proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>success,</b> Show Boats Broadway opening was delayed until Rita could be moved to another theatre.|$|E
5|$|After {{her return}} to London in early 1937, {{recognising}} {{that she was not}} going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>success</b> on the stage David abandoned thoughts of a theatrical career. Later in the year she took a post as a junior assistant at the fashion house of Worth, where smart young women from upper class backgrounds were sought after as recruits. She found the subservience of retail work irksome, and resigned in early 1938. Over the next few months she spent time holidaying in the south of France and on Corsica, where she was greatly taken with the outgoing nature of the people she stayed with and the simple excellence of their food. After returning to London, and disenchanted with life there, she joined Cowan in buying a boat, just big enough to suffice, with the intention of sailing it to Greece. They crossed the Channel in July 1939 and navigated the boat through the canal system of France to the Mediterranean coast.|$|E
5|$|As Remy watches {{through the}} window, {{a young man}} named Alfredo Linguini is hired as a garbage boy by Skinner, the restaurant's {{paranoid}} current owner and Gusteau's former sous-chef. When Linguini spills a pot of soup and attempts to recreate it, Remy recognizes that he is ruining it instead, and repairs Linguini's mistakes. Linguini catches Remy but hides him when he is then confronted by Skinner for tampering with the soup. As the two argue, the soup is accidentally served and proves <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>success.</b> The Chefs convince Skinner to retain Linguini, who is assumed to be the soup's creator. When Skinner catches Remy trying to escape, he orders Linguini to kill the rat, but Linguini discovers Remy's intelligence and decides to keep him instead.|$|E

5|$|Born in Newport, Delaware, Evans {{received}} little formal education {{and in his}} mid-teens was apprenticed to a wheelwright. Going into business with his brothers, he worked {{for over a decade}} designing, building and perfecting an automated mill with devices such as bucket chains and conveyor belts. In doing so Evans designed a continuous process of manufacturing that required no human labor. This novel concept would prove critical to the Industrial Revolution and the development of mass production. Later in life Evans turned his attention to steam power, and built the first high-pressure steam engine in the United States in 1801, developing his design independently of Richard Trevithick, who built the first in the world a year earlier. Evans was a driving force in the development and adoption of high-pressure steam engines in the United States. Evans dreamed of building a steam-powered wagon and would eventually construct and run one in 1805. Known as the Oruktor Amphibolos, it was the first automobile in the country and the world's first amphibious vehicle, although it was too primitive <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>success</b> as either.|$|E
5|$|During {{its first}} series, Last of the Summer Wine {{did not receive}} a high ratings share. The second series proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>success,</b> however, and two episodes {{made it to the}} top ten {{programmes}} of the week. The programme has since consistently been a favourite in the ratings, peaking at 18.8million viewers for an episode shown on 10 February 1985. The premiere of the 28th series in 2007 brought in an 18.6 percent share of viewers in the 6:20 time slot with an average of 3.2million viewers. Last of the Summer Wine's audience grew from 2.7million to 3.4million over the 30minutes. The show was beaten for the night only by Channel 4's Big Brother with 3.6million viewers at 9:00p.m., although the reality show had a smaller share of viewers for its time slot. The 29th series finale, which was broadcast on 31 August 2008, was watched by 4.2 million people, giving the network a 22.5% share for the night.|$|E
5|$|Having been {{promoted}} {{weeks after the}} end of the previous season and not being granted an increased wage budget, Smith felt he had a tough job in keeping Sunderland in the top flight in 1990–91. He allowed Gates and MacPhail to leave on free transfers in order to free up money to bring in new players. He spent £350,000 on Portsmouth defender Kevin Ball and took midfielder Peter Davenport from rivals Middlesbrough; Ball would prove <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>success,</b> though Smith admitted in his autobiography that signing Davenport had been a mistake that left him unable to bring in any further players, as his small budget was spent. He was given further funds in February 1991 as Sunderland were engaged in a relegation battle, and Smith spent £225,000 on midfielder Brian Mooney, who had a limited impact due to injuries. On the final day of the season Sunderland had to better Luton Town's result at home to Derby in their match against Manchester City at Maine Road, but they lost 3–2 and were relegated back into the Second Division.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, Atari {{acquired}} {{the rights to}} produce home versions of Namco's arcade games. After Pac-Man proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>success</b> in the United States, Atari decided to produce the game for its Atari 2600 console. The company believed the conversion would be simple because the arcade's success was attributed to the gameplay rather than impressive visuals. Development took around four months; the process started in May 1981 and finished in September. At the time, Atari projected 10million consoles were still actively used by video game enthusiasts. Atari decided to produce 12million game cartridges, anticipating every Atari 2600 owner would purchase the game, while two million new customers would purchase the system to play it; management predicted sales would reach at least US$500million.|$|E
5|$|One {{factor in}} William's favour was his {{marriage}} to Matilda of Flanders, the daughter of Count Baldwin V of Flanders. The union was arranged in 1049, but Pope Leo IX forbade the marriage at the Council of Rheims in October 1049. The marriage nevertheless went ahead {{some time in the}} early 1050s, possibly unsanctioned by the pope. According to a late source not generally considered to be reliable, papal sanction was not secured until 1059, but as papal-Norman relations in the 1050s were generally good, and Norman clergy were able to visit Rome in 1050 without incident, it was probably secured earlier. Papal sanction of the marriage appears to have required the founding of two monasteries in Caen– one by William and one by Matilda. The marriage was important in bolstering William's status, as Flanders was one of the more powerful French territories, with ties to the French royal house and to the German emperors. Contemporary writers considered the marriage, which produced four sons and five or six daughters, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>success.</b>|$|E
5|$|Rai had six film {{releases}} in 2000, including Kandukondain Kandukondain, a Tamil {{adaptation of}} Jane Austen's novel Sense and Sensibility, and Aditya Chopra's romantic drama Mohabbatein. In 2002, Rai played opposite Shah Rukh Khan in Bhansali's period romance Devdas, {{an adaptation of}} the novel of the same name. Her performance in the top-grossing production earned her a second Best Actress award at Filmfare. In 2003, Rai played the lead role in Rituparno Ghosh's Bengali film Chokher Bali, an adaptation of the novel of the same name, which proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>success.</b> However, the failure of her two Hindi film releases of the yearDil Ka Rishta and Kuch Naa Kaholed to a setback in her Bollywood career. The following year, Rai played a character based on Elizabeth Bennet in a Bollywood-style adaptation of Austen's novel Pride and Prejudice, entitled Bride and Prejudice, an English language British production directed by Gurinder Chadha. Also in 2004, she reunited with Ghosh to play a depressed woman in the drama Raincoat.|$|E
