A robust, real-time detection system using different scintillating materials coupled to solid-state detectors by optical fibers is developed. This system enables radiation monitors/clinicians to conduct meaningful real-time measurements using different inorganic scintillators or organic, <b>tissue-equivalent</b> <b>plastic</b> scintillators in harsh clinical and environmental environments. Recent solid state photomultiplier (SSPM) technology has matured, reaching a performance level that is suitable for replacement of the ubiquitous photomultiplier tube in selected applications for environmental radiation monitoring, clinical dosimetry, and medical imaging purposes. The objective of this work is laboratory and clinical testing of the Hamamatsu MPPC (S 10362 - 11 - 050 C), Photonique SSPM (0810 G 1), and Voxtel SiPM (SQBF-EKAA/SQBF-EIOA) SSPMs coupled to different inorganic scintillator crystals (Prelude 420, BGO), inorganic doped glass scintillator material SiO₂: Cu²⁺, and organic BCF- 12 plastic scintillating fibers, used as detector elements. Both polymer optical fibers (POFs) and glass optical fibers (GOFs) are used as signal conduits for laboratory and clinical testing. Further, reduction of electron-beam-generated Cerenkov light in optical fibers is facilitated by the inclusion of metalized air-core capillary tubing between the BCF- 12 plastic scintillating fiber and the POF.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the effect of tissue composition on dose distribution in electron beam radiotherapy. Methods: A Siemens Primus linear accelerator and a phantom were simulated using MCNPX Monte Carlo code. In a homogeneous cylindrical phantom, six types of soft tissue and three types of tissue-equivalent materials were investigated. The tissues included muscle (skeletal), adipose tissue, blood (whole), breast tissue, soft tissue (9 -components) and soft tissue (4 -component). The tissue-equivalent materials were water, A- 150 <b>tissue-equivalent</b> <b>plastic</b> and perspex. Electron dose relative to dose in 9 -component soft tissue at various depths on the beam’s central axis was determined for 8, 12, and 14 MeV electron energies. Results: The results of relative electron dose in various materials relative to dose in 9 -component soft tissue were reported for 8, 12 and 14 MeV electron beams as tabulated data. While differences were observed between dose distributions in various soft tissues and tissue-equivalent materials, which vary with the composition of material, electron energy and depth in phantom, they can be ignored due to the incorporated uncertainties in Monte Carlo calculations. Conclusion: Based on the calculations performed, differences in dose distributions in various soft tissues and tissue-equivalent materials are not significant.

It {{is based on a}} high-resolution pixelated detector array with a semi-cylindrical multi-pinhole tungsten collimator and is designed to fit inside a compact rectal probe, and is able to resolve the 3 D position of the source with a maximum error of 1. 5 mm. This paper presents an evaluation of the additional dose that will be delivered to the patient as a result of backscatter radiation from the collimator. Monte Carlo simulations of planar and cylindrical collimators embedded in a tissue-equivalent phantom were performed using Geant 4, with an 192 Ir source placed at two different source-collimator distances. The planar configuration was replicated experimentally to validate the simulations, with a MOSkin dosimetry probe used to measure dose at three distances from the collimator. For the cylindrical collimator simulation, backscatter dose enhancement was calculated as a function of axial and azimuthal displacement, and dose distribution maps were generated at three distances from the collimator surface. Although significant backscatter dose enhancement was observed for both geometries immediately adjacent to the collimator, simulations and experiments indicate that backscatter dose is negligible at distances beyond 1 mm from the collimator.

The scope of this work is to obtain information about the physical details of the scintillator readout and its implications and limits for RAD’s performance. To this aim, an optical Monte-Carlo model of each scintillator is set up. After demonstrating that it adequately explains the major effects seen in RAD’s scintillators, further analyses are performed based on this model. It is used for quantitative exploration of noise limits and onboard energy reconstruction methods for the scintillation detectors. Further, it is integrated with a variant of a preexisting particle physics model of the sensor head. In addition, the electronic readout is modeled, too, to ﬁnally provide a sequential model explaining all major effects in RAD. This model, supplied with suitable parameters from measurements, is then used to forecast the instrument’s behaviour in Martian conditions, especially the behaviour of the AC. To complete the picture, initial results on neutral particle modeling are analyzed and compared to measurements to check the analysis path for neutral particle measurements on Mars.

The thickness of CC 1 and CC 2 is 2 X 0 (0. 1 λ 0) and 23 X 0 (1. 1 λ 0) respectively (where X 0 is radiation length and λ 0 is nuclear interaction one). The total calorimeter thickness is 25 X 0 or 1. 2 λ 0 for vertical incident particles registration and 54 X 0 or 2. 5 λ 0 for laterally incident ones. The energy range for γ-rays and electrons (positrons) registration in the main aperture is from ∼ 0. 1 GeV to ∼ 3. 0 TeV. The γ-ray telescope main aperture angular and energy resolutions are respectively ∼ 0. 01 and ∼ 1 % for 102 GeV γ-quanta, the proton rejection factor is ∼ 5 × 105. The first three strip layers without tungsten provide the registration of γ-rays down to ∼ 20 MeV in the main aperture.
