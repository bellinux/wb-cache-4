5|$|The Korean Peninsula {{had been}} divided between {{occupation}} {{forces of the}} United States and the Soviet Union {{since the end of}} World War II along the 38th Parallel. Each government sought to prop up a government on its side of the occupation border, and as the Cold War began, tensions rose between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>Koreas.</b> These culminated in open warfare with the North's invasion of the South on June 25. During this time, the United Nations backed South Korea and considered it the only lawful government.|$|E
5|$|The North Korean People's Air Force (KPAF) {{consisted}} of only 132 aircraft and 2,000 personnel, of whom only 80 were pilots and most poorly trained. <b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>Koreas</b> had very small air forces of their own, with the North Koreans' 132 aircraft organized into the KPAF 1st Air Division. At the early {{phase in the}} war, these aircraft were used boldly to the North Koreans' advantage. Aware of their air superiority over the Republic of Korea Air Force and not expecting UN intervention, they anticipated light resistance in the air. In all, the KPAF had 2,000 personnel.|$|E
5|$|The inner German border {{was never}} entirely sealed {{in the fashion}} of the border between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>Koreas</b> and could be crossed in either {{direction}} throughout the Cold War. The post-war agreements on the governance of Berlin specified that the Western Allies were {{to have access to}} the city via defined air, road, rail and river corridors. This was mostly respected by the Soviets and East Germans, albeit with periodic interruptions and harassment of travellers. Even during the Berlin Blockade of 1948, supplies could be brought in by air– the famous Berlin Airlift. Before and after the blockade, Western civilian and military trains, road traffic and barges routinely passed through East Germany en route to Berlin.|$|E

5000|$|After the Korean War, the {{population}} ratio between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>Korea's</b> was drastically different {{because of the}} [...] "intense bombing". The bombing took a major toll on North Korea leaving [...] "no more targets left to hit, which did not even happen in Vietnam". Secondly, [...] "the DPRK lost 12-15 percent of its population during the war...Just over half the Koreans dead were men". North Korea was used [...] "to combat {{the legacy of the}} colonial past." [...] Because of these two factors, it affected the position of women in the DPRK. The importance on population growth was crucial to the development of North Korea. Women were [...] " [...] encouraged a high birth rate, partly by making contraception and abortion difficult to obtain".

5|$|The second crisis, {{known as}} the axe murder incident, {{occurred}} at Panmunjom, a village which stands in the DMZ between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>Koreas.</b> Encouraged by U.S. difficulties in Vietnam, North Korea had been waging a campaign of diplomatic pressure and minor military harassment to try and convince the U.S. to withdraw from South Korea. Then, in August 1976, North Korean forces killed two U.S. officers and injured South Korean guards who were engaged in trimming a tree in Panmunjom's Joint Security Area. The attack coincided with {{a meeting of the}} Conference of Non-Aligned Nations in Colombo, Sri Lanka, at which Kim Jong-il, the son of North Korean leader Kim Il-sung, presented the incident as an example of American aggression, helping secure the passage of a motion calling for a U.S. withdrawal from the South.|$|E

25|$|The {{industrialization}} of the Korean Peninsula {{began with}} the Joseon dynasty (in particular with King, and later Emperor, Gojong) while Korea was still independent but accelerated under Japanese occupation. It {{continues to be the}} subject of controversy between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>Koreas</b> and Japan. The manner of the acceleration of industrialization under Japanese occupation, especially the utilization of industrialization only for the purposes of benefiting Japan, the exploitation of the Korean people in their own country, the marginalization of Korean history and culture, the environmental exploitation of the Korean Peninsula, and its long-term negative repercussions for modern-day North and South Korea are among the most provocative aspects of the controversy.|$|E
25|$|Relations {{with the}} North {{improved}} and a summit meeting was planned, but postponed indefinitely {{with the death}} of Kim Il-sung. Tensions varied between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>Koreas</b> thereafter, with cycles of small military skirmishes and apologies. The government also carried out substantial financial and economical reforms, joining the OECD in 1996, but encountered difficulties with political and financial scandals which involves his son. The country also faced a variety of catastrophes which claimed many lives: a train collision and a ship sinking in 1993, and the Seongsu Bridge and Sampoong Department Store collapses in 1994 and 1995. These incidents were a blow to the civilian government.|$|E
25|$|The {{country now}} divided, the {{relationship}} between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>Koreas</b> turned more antagonistic as time passed. The Soviet forces having withdrawn in 1948, North Korea pressured the South to expel the United States forces, but Rhee sought to align his government strongly with America, and against both North Korea and Japan. Although talks towards normalization of relations with Japan took place, they achieved little. Meanwhile, the government took in vast sums of American aid, in amounts sometimes near the total size of the national budget. The nationalist government also continued many of the practices of the U.S. military government. In 1948, the Rhee government repressed military uprisings in Jeju, Suncheon and Yeosu. About 30,000 local people were gunned down.|$|E
30|$|Unlikely to {{the same}} divided country like West Germany, {{political}} space in which liberals and social democratic elites present their ideas and policy alternatives could not be created in South Korea by the extreme antagonism between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> divided <b>Koreas.</b> Since some principles of liberal democracy were easily ignored even in West European countries {{at the height of}} the Cold War, 20 it would not be surprising that even liberals as well as moderate social democrats could not survive in South Korean politics. South Korean liberals and social democrats forced to rescind their political thought to anticommunist on the threat of North Korea’s communism. If the Korean War didn’t break out, we could find some liberals or social democrats in South Korean politics.|$|R

25|$|P. vivax is {{the only}} {{indigenous}} malaria parasite on the Korean peninsula. In the years following the Korean War (1950–53), malaria-eradication campaigns successfully {{reduced the number of}} new cases of the disease in North Korea and South Korea. In 1979, World Health Organization declared the Korean peninsula vivax malaria-free, but the disease unexpectedly re-emerged in the late 1990s and still persists today. Several factors contributed to the re-emergence of the disease, including reduced emphasis on malaria control after 1979, floods and famine in North Korea, emergence of drug resistance and possibly global warming.

40|$|Assuming {{there is}} another North Korean invasion; could the South Koreans counterinvade North Korea and prevail even without the United States' assistance? This paper studies the {{possibility}} of a South Korean counterinvasion against North Korea by looking at the qualitative combat dynamics and performing a formal campaign analyses based on the Korean peninsula's conventional military balance. This study first analyzes the process of the South Korean defensive against the North Korean invasion, and examines South Korea's likely counterinvasion scenarios and assesses their chances of success. These scenarios vary based on North Korea's likely courses of action once its offensive fails, depending on whether the North Koreans retreat to the military demarcation line or hold their position within the South territory. According to this paper's analysis, South Korea is capable of counterinvading North Korea in all the scenarios suggested. South Korea possesses a qualitatively superior force with better readiness and logistics powered by a stronger economy, while the North Koreans lack the force effectiveness necessary to carry out their theory of victory. First, the South Korean forces are capable of fending off a North Korean invasion while inflicting severe damage to the North Koreans; second, the South Korean forces would inflict considerable casualty to the North Koreans during their retreat; finally, the South Korean offensive would be capable of breaking through the weakened North Korean defense. This study makes several contributions. First, it examines the puzzle of South Korean counterinvasion that has been under-discussed despite its political and strategic significance. In doing so, the study presents an opportunity to explain North Korea's recent behaviors and the United States' redefinition of its role involving the peninsula, hence increasing our understanding of the East Asian security dynamics. Second, by providing an updated survey of the peninsula's conventional balance, this study enhances our knowledge in <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>Korea's</b> strategic capabilities which have undergone considerable changes. Third, this study advances our usage of campaign analyses by applying a phased use of the models with changing parameters. This approach enables us to analyze multi-phased campaigns comprised of different dynamics with better accuracy. by Jonghyuk Chung. Thesis (S. M.)
