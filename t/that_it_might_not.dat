5|$|Lee and Yang's {{research}} into existing experimental results convinced them that parity was conserved for electromagnetic interactions {{and for the}} strong interaction. For this reason, scientists had expected that {{it would also be}} true for the weak interaction, but it had not been tested, and Lee and Yang's theoretical studies showed <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> hold true for the weak interaction. Lee and Yang worked out a pencil-and-paper design of an experiment for testing conservation of parity in the laboratory. Lee then turned to Wu for her expertise in choosing and then working out the hardware manufacture, set-up, and laboratory procedures for carrying out this experiment.|$|E
5|$|At {{least one}} adult {{remains in the}} nest {{for two to three}} weeks after {{hatching}} to protect the young. Both parents feed the young by regurgitating onto the floor of the nest. Black stork parents have been known to kill one of their fledglings, generally the weakest, in times of food shortage to reduce brood size and hence increase the chance of survival of the remaining nestlings. Stork nestlings do not attack each other, and their parents' method of feeding them (disgorging large amounts of food at once) means that stronger siblings cannot outcompete weaker ones for food directly, hence parental infanticide is an efficient way of reducing brood size. This behaviour has only rarely been observed in the species, although the shyness of the species and difficulties in studying its nesting habits mean <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> be an uncommon phenomenon.|$|E
5|$|Like {{several other}} chalk figures {{carved into the}} English countryside, the Cerne Abbas Giant is often thought of as an ancient creation. However, as {{with many of the}} other figures, its history cannot be traced back further than the late 17th century, making an origin during the Celtic, Roman or even Early Medieval periods {{difficult}} to demonstrate. Medieval sources refer to the hill on which the giant is located as Trendle Hill – possibly in reference to the nearby landmark known as the Trendle. Joseph Bettey noted that none of the earlier sources for the area, including a detailed 1617 land survey, refer to the giant, suggesting <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> have been there at the time. In contrast, the Uffington White Horse {{has been shown to be}} 3,000 years old, and there are references to it across the ages.|$|E

25|$|Wilson privately {{supported}} conscription {{at least}} as early as 1905. He thought Haldane’s scheme to merge Militia, Yeomanry and Volunteers into a new Territorial Army of 16 divisions {{would not be enough}} to match German training and efficiency. He was summoned to see Haldane (March 1909) after an article in the Liberal Westminster Gazette (inspired by Repington, Wilson assumed) claimed that he supported conscription. In a lecture to students (November 1909) he did not publicly oppose government policy but hinted <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> be enough. His wife Cecil organised a National Service League meeting that month. Wilson successfully (November 1907) lobbied Haldane for an increase {{in the size of the}} Staff College in order to provide trained staff officers for the new Territorial Army. Haldane agreed an expansion after an inspection in March 1908. During Wilson’s tenure the number of instructors rose from 7 to 16 and the number of students from 64 to 100. In total, 224 Army and 22 Royal Navy officers studied under him.|$|E

The song was composed as a collaborative effort between Alison Goldfrapp and Will Gregory in late 2004 in the countryside of Bath, England. The song was written and recorded while Goldfrapp and Gregory were jamming in the recording studio, bouncing song ideas off each other. According to Goldfrapp, the song's lyrics are [...] "a little bit more reflective and sensual" [...] than those she had composed on Felt Mountain (2000) and Black Cherry (2003).|$|E

500|$|Minor repairs on {{the castle}} {{were carried out}} during the period, {{including}} to the castle bridge, but {{the state of the}} property gradually declined. The old kitchens were removed in the early 15th century, and a new, larger facility constructed in their place. Once built, however, the new kitchens, {{along with the rest of}} the buildings in the inner bailey, were left to deteriorate. Reports in 1482 stated that the buildings were no longer weatherproof, and a survey carried around between 1503 and 1506 described the castle as [...] "evyll repayred", and noted that the roof of the keep was rotten. This last survey urged that existing repair works on the buildings in the bailey be completed, but suggested <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> be worth repairing the keep because of the excessive cost.|$|E

500|$|Breeding {{behaviour}} {{is known}} {{only for the}} African river martin. It nests in large colonies of up to 800 birds from December to April, when the river levels are low. Each pair excavates a [...] long tunnel in the exposed sandbanks. The pocket {{at the end of}} the tunnel has a few twigs and leaves to serve as a nest, onto which two to four unspotted white eggs are laid. It has chasing flight displays and will walk on the ground; it also displays on the ground, but the function of this is uncertain. It rarely perches during the breeding season. Although it has been assumed that the breeding habits of the white-eyed species resemble those of the African species, distinctive differences in foot and toe morphology suggest <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> use a burrow for nesting.|$|E
500|$|These actions led to {{the plans}} for a {{sustained}} air campaign being reconsidered. On 13 February a new plan, merging targets and priorities from the lists produced by the Bundys and the JSC, was approved and given the name Rolling Thunder. This campaign was not aimed at specific actions {{on the part of}} the North Vietnamese, but was intended as a larger response to the growing hostilities as a whole. Although some within the administration believed that the campaign would be costly, and <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> work, they reasoned that it was [...] "an acceptable risk, especially when considered against the alternative of introducing American combat troops." [...] Rolling Thunder called for an eight-week air campaign consistent with the restrictions that Johnson and Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara had imposed upon it. If the insurgency continued [...] "with DRV support, strikes against the DRV would be extended with intensified efforts against targets north of the 19th parallel." ...|$|E
500|$|Stevens pushed Congress {{to pass a}} {{constitutional}} amendment abolishing slavery. The Emancipation Proclamation was a wartime measure, {{did not apply to}} all slaves, and might be reversed by peacetime courts; an amendment would be slavery's end. The Thirteenth Amendment—which outlawed slavery and involuntary servitude except as punishment for crime—easily passed the Senate, but failed in the House in June; fears <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> pass delayed a renewed attempt there. Lincoln campaigned aggressively for the amendment after his re-election in 1864, and Stevens described his December annual message to Congress as [...] "the most important and best message that has been communicated to Congress for the last 60years". [...] Stevens closed the debate on the amendment on January 13, 1865.

During the network pitch of the episode, Ward beatboxed and Sugar played ukulele and the two performed [...] "The Fry Song". Sugar later called the experience [...] "super terrifying", although the network did green-light the episode.

Bolkovac responded, [...] "Unfortunately, the widespread horror is already there. This {{is not going to}} be simple or a quick fix." [...] She said that in addition to Bosnia, peacekeepers had violated human rights in Nigeria, Kosovo, Burundi, Sierra Leone, the Congo, Liberia, Cambodia, Iraq, Afghanistan, Haiti, Colombia, Guinea and Sudan.
