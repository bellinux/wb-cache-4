5|$|A replica wooden bridge {{runs from}} the outer defences over <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>to</b> an island called a ravelin, which is in turn linked to the inner defences by another replica bridge, {{protected}} with two drawbridges. The ravelin formed a physical barrier to incoming artillery fire aimed {{at the entrance to}} the inner defences and could also have directed fire against enemy forces that breached the outer defensive line.|$|E
5|$|According {{to local}} geologists, the exact {{source of the}} spring remains unknown, but it is {{believed}} that its origin may be southwest of its actual location, possibly at Bukit Timah. Hot springs are formed when underground water comes into contact with hot rock masses. The resulting high pressure causes <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>to</b> seep upwards through cracks, forcing itself out of the ground as a spring.|$|E

5|$|The unusual genus, Entovalva, is endosymbiotic, {{being found}} only in the {{oesophagus}} of sea cucumbers. It has mantle folds that completely surround its small valves. When the sea cucumber sucks in sediment, the bivalve allows <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>to</b> pass over its gills and extracts fine organic particles. To prevent itself from being swept away, it attaches itself with byssal threads to the host's throat. The sea cucumber is unharmed.|$|E
5|$|An {{independent}} study revealed <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>to</b> be radioactive {{and potentially dangerous}} to drink, initially surrounding the project with controversy. Jordan's Ministry of Water and Irrigation has stated that the radioactivity {{is not a problem}} because the water is to be diluted with an equal amount of water from other sources, although it remains disputed if this would be enough to bring the water up to standards. The Ministry said the {{independent study}} was inaccurate, as it did not test water from any of the wells that will be used in the project. The President of the Jordanian Geologists Association Bahjat Al Adwan stated that the radiation is present in the water in the form of Radon, and thus dissipates harmlessly when the water is exposed to air on the surface.|$|E
5|$|Arctic terns {{sometimes}} dip down to {{the surface}} of <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>to</b> catch prey close to the surface. They may also chase insects in the air when breeding. It is also thought that Arctic terns may, in spite of their small size, occasionally engage in kleptoparasitism by swooping at birds so as to startle them into releasing their catches. Several species are targetedâ€”conspecifics, other terns (like the common tern), and some auk and grebe species.|$|E

5|$|Cooking oil is flammable, {{and fires}} {{may be caused}} by it igniting at too high a temperature. Further, {{attempts}} to extinguish an oil fire with water cause an extremely dangerous condition, a boilover, as they cause <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>to</b> flash into steam due to the high heat of the oil, in turn sending the burning oil in all directions and thus aggravating the fire. This {{is the leading cause of}} house fires in the United Kingdom. Instead, oil fires must be extinguished with a non-water fire extinguisher or by smothering. Other means of extinguishing an oil fire include application of dry powder (e.g., baking soda, salt) or fire fighting foam. Most commercial deep fryers are equipped with automatic fire suppression systems using foam.|$|E
5|$|Enhanced {{geothermal}} systems (EGS) actively inject {{water into}} wells {{to be heated}} and pumped back out. The water is injected under high pressure to expand existing rock fissures to enable <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>to</b> freely flow in and out. The technique was adapted from oil and gas extraction techniques. However, the geologic formations are deeper and no toxic chemicals are used, reducing the possibility of environmental damage. Drillers can employ directional drilling to expand {{the size of the}} reservoir.|$|E

When the dolphins are in the bay, it is quickly closed off with nets so the dolphins cannot escape. The dolphins are usually not caught and killed immediately, but instead left to calm down over night. The following day, the dolphins are caught one by one and killed.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{crocodilians}} are stalk-and-ambush predators, though hunting strategies {{vary depending}} on the individual species and the prey being hunted. Terrestrial prey is stalked from the water's edge and then grabbed and drowned. Gharials and other fish-eating species sweep their jaws sideways to snap up prey, and these animals can leap out of <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>to</b> catch birds, bats, and leaping fish. Small animals can be killed by whiplash as the predator shakes its head. Caimans use their tails and bodies to herd fish into shallow water. They may also dig for bottom-dwelling invertebrates, and the smooth-fronted caiman will even hunt on land. Some crocodilian species have been observed to use sticks and branches to lure nest-building birds. Nile crocodiles are known to hunt cooperatively, and several individuals may feed on the same carcass. Most species will eat anything suitable that comes within reach and are also opportunistic scavengers.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 17thcentury, Robert Boyle proved that air is {{necessary}} for combustion. English chemist John Mayow (1641â€“1679) refined this work by showing that fire requires {{only a part of}} air that he called spiritus nitroaereus. In one experiment, he found that placing either a mouse or a lit candle in a closed container over water caused <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>to</b> rise and replace one-fourteenth of the air's volume before extinguishing the subjects. From this he surmised that nitroaereus is consumed in both respiration and combustion.|$|E
