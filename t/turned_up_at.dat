5|$|In October 1963, {{three young}} boys <b>turned</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> a senior {{athletics}} meet in Geelong, Victoria. They approached official Trevor Billingham, but Billingham turned them away citing their youth {{as a reason}} for them not to be allowed to compete. A few months later, Billingham held a coaching camp for secondary school students. His camp had a lot of primary school students in attendance.|$|E
5|$|Within days, Frederick's {{army had}} reconstituted itself. Approximately 26,000 men—most of the survivors—were {{scattered}} over the territory between Kunersdorf and Berlin. Four days after the battle, though, {{most of the men}} <b>turned</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the headquarters on the Oder River or in Berlin, and Frederick's army recovered to a strength of 32,000 men and 50 artillery pieces.|$|E

25|$|Mary Reynolds <b>turns</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> Woombai, {{lost and}} {{confused}} and claiming that Patricia is her mother. She explains that her grandmother {{told her that}} her mother is Patricia Hamilton. Her grandmother and grandfather are now both dead, having been murdered. Mary claims that she witnessed the murders while hiding underneath her bed. The murderer <b>turns</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> Woombai and starts gunning for Mary.|$|R
5|$|Bamber {{arrived at}} the {{farmhouse}} one or two minutes after the police. They waited for a tactical firearms group to arrive, which <b>turned</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> 5am and decided to wait until daylight before trying to enter. Police determined that all {{the doors and windows}} to the house were shut, except for the window in the main bedroom on the first floor. Using a loudhailer, they spent two hours trying to communicate with Sheila. The only sound they reported from the house was a dog barking.|$|E
5|$|Geen was {{selected}} to play for Oxford against Cambridge in four consecutive years from 1910 to 1913. In the first of these, on 13 December 1910, a 9,000-strong crowd <b>turned</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> Queen's, mostly to watch Ronnie Poulton, playing for Oxford. Cambridge started strong but a try by Bryn Lewis was disallowed in the opening minutes after a touch judge signalled that Geen had put his foot into touch in the preceding Oxford move. Moments later, Poulton ran through the Cambridge defence, drew the fullback and passed to Geen to dive in at the corner for a try. With Turner's conversion, Oxford led 5–0. A similar passage of play again saw Poulton put Geen through for a try, but he dropped the ball after crossing the line while trying {{to get closer to}} the posts.|$|E
5|$|Manager Malcolm McLaren asked {{architect}} Ben Kelly {{to refurbish}} a basement rehearsal room {{he had bought}} from Badfinger. The Sex Pistols rehearsed in this room, lived above No. 6, and recorded their first demos there. Johnny Rotten drew cartoons of the members as graffiti which was later revealed in an archaeological survey of the site. Scott Gorham bought his first guitar with Thin Lizzy on Denmark Street. He had <b>turned</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the audition with a Japanese Les Paul Copy—when he got the job, Phil Lynott took him shopping on Denmark Street. After being told several guitars were too expensive, he settled on a Sunburst Gibson Les Paul Deluxe. Andy's Guitars was established in 1978 at No. 27 and survived for many years before closing in 2007 because of increased shop rates.|$|E

50|$|One {{difficulty}} {{was that}} Doddy was often {{up to two}} hours late for the rehearsals. To combat this, Casey contracted everyone else to <b>turn</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> noon, while Dodd was contracted to <b>turn</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> 10am. He was still two hours late, he thought, but now it no longer held up production. However, once he discovered what Casey had done the ploy had to be abandoned. Early finishes rarely happened either.|$|R
5|$|The cyclone {{caused the}} deaths of 22people on its course, {{affecting}} parts of the Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea, Eastern Australia, New Caledonia, Vanuatu and New Zealand. Nine people in a banana dinghy en route to Rossel Island went missing {{at the height of}} the storm; they were presumed drowned after wreckage from their boat <b>turned</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the island. In Queensland, three people died in traffic accidents caused by the storm, and another fatality occurred when a boy became trapped in a storm pipe. One death took place in New Caledonia, while flooding caused eight drownings in Papua New Guinea. After this usage of the name Rewa, the name was retired.|$|E
5|$|Kirchherr and Sutcliffe went to Liverpool in {{the summer}} of 1961, as Kirchherr wanted to meet Sutcliffe's family (and to see Liverpool) before their marriage. Everybody was expecting a strange beatnik artist from Hamburg, but Kirchherr <b>turned</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the Sutcliffe's house at 37 Aigburth Drive, Liverpool, bearing a single long-stemmed orchid in her hand as a present, and dressed in a round-necked {{cashmere}} sweater and tailored skirt. In 1962, Sutcliffe collapsed {{in the middle of an}} art class in Hamburg. He was suffering from intense headaches, and Kirchherr's mother had German doctors perform various checks on him, although they were unable to determine exactly what was causing the headaches. While living at the Kirchherrs' house in Hamburg his condition got worse. On 10 April 1962, Kirchherr's mother phoned her daughter at work and told her Sutcliffe was not feeling well, had been brought back to the house, and an ambulance had been called for. Kirchherr rushed home and rode with Sutcliffe in the ambulance, but he died in her arms before it reached the hospital.|$|E
5|$|Three {{years after}} meeting John in the NEMS office, Alf (who was then 56 years old) <b>turned</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> Kenwood again, with his fiancée Pauline Jones. Pauline {{had been an}} 18-year-old Exeter University student and a Rolling Stones fan when she met the 54-year-old Alf in 1966. Alf and Pauline grew tired of trying to {{convince}} Pauline's mother {{to allow them to}} marry, so they eloped and were married in Gretna Green, Scotland. In 1966, Alf asked John if he could give Pauline a job, so she was hired to help, looking after Julian Lennon and also the piles of fan mail. Pauline spent a few months living at Kenwood in the attic bedroom. Alf and Pauline moved to a flat in Bourne Court, London Road, Patcham (a suburb of Brighton) before moving to Ladies Mile Road, Brighton, in November 1969. Alf had two sons with Pauline: David Henry Lennon (February 26, 1969) and Robin Francis Lennon (October 22, 1973).|$|E

There, they secretly make a plan to have sex that night, for the first time. Alo <b>turns</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> Rich's house after his father has a heart attack, but cannot bring himself to burden Rich with his troubles, due to Rich's elation at having finally had sex with Grace.|$|R
5|$|Opposition {{from the}} laity took longer to surface. This {{resistance}} focused on two things: the King's right to demand military service, {{and his right}} to levy taxes. At the Salisbury parliament of February 1297, Roger Bigod, Earl of Norfolk, {{in his capacity as}} Marshal of England, objected to a royal summons of military service. Bigod argued that the military obligation only extended to service alongside the King; if the King intended to sail to Flanders, he could not send his subjects to Gascony. In July, Bigod and Humphrey de Bohun, Earl of Hereford and Constable of England, drew up a series of complaints known as the Remonstrances, in which objections to the extortionate level of taxation were voiced. Undeterred, Edward requested another lay subsidy. This one was particularly provocative, because the King had sought consent only from a small group of magnates, rather than from representatives from the communities in parliament. While Edward was in Winchelsea, preparing for the campaign in Flanders, Bigod and Bohun <b>turned</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the Exchequer to prevent the collection of the tax. As the King left the country with a greatly reduced force, the kingdom seemed {{to be on the verge}} of civil war. What resolved the situation was the English defeat by the Scots at the Battle of Stirling Bridge. The renewed threat to the homeland gave king and magnates common cause. Edward signed the Confirmatio cartaruma confirmation of Magna Carta and its accompanying Charter of the Forestand the nobility agreed to serve with the King on a campaign in Scotland.|$|E

25|$|The Germans were {{confident}} enough to film a simulation of the intended invasion in advance. A crew <b>turned</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the Belgian port of Antwerp in early September 1940 and, for two days, they filmed tanks and troops landing from barges on a nearby beach under simulated fire. It was explained that, as the invasion would happen at night, Hitler wanted the German people {{to see all the}} details.|$|E
