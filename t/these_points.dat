5|$|Every so often, {{the player}} {{will come to}} a point where he or she is given the chance to choose from {{multiple}} options. The time between <b>these</b> <b>points</b> is variable and can occur anywhere from a minute to much longer. Gameplay pauses at <b>these</b> <b>points</b> and depending on which choice the player makes, the plot will progress in a specific direction. There are four main plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience, one for each of the heroines in the story. The plot lines carry on from each other in a linear fashion. The game can end prematurely if the player makes the wrong decisions. When this occurs, the player must go back to a previously saved spot and choose different decisions.|$|E

40|$|Hard thresholding, LASSO, {{adaptive}} LASSO and SCAD point estimators {{have been}} suggested {{for use in the}} linear regression context when most of the components of the regression parameter vector are believed to be zero, a sparsity type of assumption. Potscher and Schneider, 2010, Electronic Journal of Statistics, have considered the properties of fixed-width confidence intervals that include one of <b>these</b> <b>point</b> estimators (for all possible data values). They consider a normal linear regression model with orthogonal regressors and show that these confidence intervals are longer than the standard confidence interval (based on the maximum likelihood estimator) when the tuning parameter for <b>these</b> <b>point</b> estimators is chosen to lead to either conservative or consistent model selection. We extend this analysis to the case of variable-width confidence intervals that include one of <b>these</b> <b>point</b> estimators (for all possible data values). In consonance with these findings of Potscher and Schneider, we find that these confidence intervals perform poorly by comparison with the standard confidence interval, when the tuning parameter for <b>these</b> <b>point</b> estimators is chosen to lead to consistent model selection. However, when the tuning parameter for <b>these</b> <b>point</b> estimators is chosen to lead to conservative model selection, our conclusions differ from those of Potscher and Schneider. We consider the variable-width confidence intervals of Farchione and Kabaila, 2008, Statistics & Probability Letters, which have advantages over the standard confidence interval in the context that there is a belief in a sparsity type of assumption. These variable-width confidence intervals are shown to include the hard thresholding, LASSO, adaptive LASSO and SCAD estimators (for all possible data values) provided that the tuning parameters for these estimators are chosen to belong to an appropriate interval...|$|R

5|$|Additionally, {{there was}} a points classification, which awarded a green jersey. In the points classification, cyclists got points for {{finishing}} in the top 10 in a stage. For all stages, the win earned 15points, second place earned 12points, third 10, fourth 8, fifth 6, and one point fewer per place down to a single point for 10th.

5|$|Domination: Two teams {{compete to}} control various control points to earn points. Standard maps contain three control points. Control of <b>these</b> <b>points</b> is {{initially}} accomplished through occupation (physically occupying the space), but {{control of a}} point continues until a player from another team occupies the space. The first team to reach the point limit, or that has the most points when a time limit has expired, wins.|$|E
40|$|When {{simulating}} a stochastic system, simulators {{often are}} interested in estimating various steady-state performance measures. The classical point estimator for such a measure involves simply taking the time average of an appropriate function of the process being simulated. Since the simulation can not be initiated with the (unknown) steady-state distribution, the classical point estimate is generally biased. A variety of other point estimates have been developed {{in an attempt to}} minimize the bias. In this paper we discuss the results of applying <b>these</b> <b>point</b> estimates to four continuous time Markov chain models. The bias of <b>these</b> <b>point</b> estimates of the performance measure, the bias of <b>these</b> <b>point</b> estimates of the time average variance constant, and the coverage probability of associated condence intervals are all reports for the four models. Conclusions are drawn from this experimental work as to which methods are most eective in reducing bias. Keywords: Bias reducing estimators, reg [...] ...|$|R

5|$|Drosera anglica {{was first}} {{described}} by William Hudson in 1778. It has frequently been {{confused with the}} other circumpolar long-leaf Drosera, D. intermedia. This confusion was fueled by the resurfacing of an older name, D. longifolia (described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753), which was regarded as being too ambiguous in description and had been applied to specimens of both D. anglica and D. intermedia. Herbarium specimens were also a mix of the two species. <b>These</b> <b>points</b> led Martin Cheek to propose D. longifolia for rejection as a species name in 1998. The proposal was accepted and the taxon listed as rejected in 1999.|$|E

40|$|Summary. We {{construct}} infinite-dimensional highly-uniform point {{sets for}} quasi-Monte Carlo integration. The successive coordinates of each point {{are determined by}} a linear recurrence in F 2 w, the finite field with 2 w elements where w is an integer, and a mapping from this field to the interval [0, 1). One interesting property of <b>these</b> <b>point</b> sets is {{that almost all of}} their two-dimensional projections are perfectly equidistributed. We performed searches for specific parameters in terms of different measures of uniformity and different numbers of points. We give a numerical illustration showing that using randomized versions of <b>these</b> <b>point</b> sets in place of independent random points can reduce the variance drastically for certain functions. ...|$|R

Each choosable location is accompanied by an image of a heroine in order to allow the choices to be easier to make. Throughout gameplay, the player is given multiple options to choose from.

5|$|Because Earth's {{rotational}} axis is not perpendicular to its orbital plane, Earth's equatorial plane is not coplanar with the ecliptic plane, but {{is inclined to}} it by an angle of about 23.4°, which {{is known as the}} obliquity of the ecliptic.

The crossing from south to north is known as the vernal equinox, also known as the first point of Aries and the ascending node of the ecliptic on the celestial equator.

5|$|Don't take it {{personally}} is a visual novel, or interactive fiction game {{where the majority of}} the story is told through still images of the speaking characters in front of anime-style backgrounds with text overlaid. The player's viewpoint follows one character, the teacher in a school, with the player seeing his thoughts as well as his and the other characters' statements. The player advances the conversations the teacher is in or witnesses at will, but cannot go backwards and has little control over what any of the characters, including the teacher, are saying except at a few key moments. At <b>these</b> <b>points,</b> the player is presented with two or three choices for what the teacher says; which option is chosen can change what path the plot takes, in either a minor or major way.|$|E
5|$|During {{conversations with}} characters, Mass Effect employs a radial command menu, called Dialogue Wheel, where the player's {{dialogue}} options depend on wheel direction. The {{left side of}} the wheel is normally reserved for options that will continue the conversation in depth, while options on the right side tend to move the conversation towards completion. Responses at the top are generally more polite and selfless, while those at the bottom are more aggressive and hostile. Dialogue choices impact how others react to Shepard and affect the player's chosen morality. Morality is measured by Paragon (charm) and Renegade (intimidate) points. <b>These</b> <b>points</b> allow the player to develop talents that affect the availability of new special Paragon and Renegade dialogue options with significant impact in the game.|$|E
