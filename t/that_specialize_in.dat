5|$|Winmark Corporation is an American {{franchisor}} of five retail businesses <b>that</b> <b>specialize</b> <b>in</b> {{buying and}} selling used goods. The company is based in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Winmark was founded in 1988 as Play It Again Sports Franchise Corporation by Ron Olson and Jeffrey Dahlberg after they purchased the Play It Again Sports franchise rights from Martha Morris. They renamed the company to Grow Biz International Inc. in June 1993. Grow Biz went public in August 1993. In 2000, John Morgan replaced Dahlberg as CEO and renamed the company to Winmark in 2001. Morgan rescued Winmark from the verge of bankruptcy by selling financially failing franchise concepts and stores and replacing the management team. The company's strategy was to move from owning stores itself to having franchisees own all the stores.|$|E
5|$|Inflammation is {{a normal}} part of the human immune response, whereby leukocytes (white blood cells), {{including}} neutrophils (white blood cells <b>that</b> <b>specialize</b> <b>in</b> causing inflammation), gather, and chemokines (proteins released from certain cells, which activate or elicit a response from other cells) accumulate at any location in the body where bacterial or viral infections occur. Inflammation interferes with the activity of bacteria and viruses, and serves to clear them from the body. In DPB, bacteria such as Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa can cause the proliferation of inflammatory cells into the bronchiolar tissues. However, when neither bacteria are present with DPB, the inflammation continues for an as yet unknown reason. In either circumstance, inflammation in DPB can be so severe that nodules containing inflammatory cells form in the walls of the bronchioles. The presence of inflammation and infection in the airways also results in the production of excess mucus, which must be coughed up as sputum. The combination of inflammation, nodule development, infection, mucus, and frequent cough contributes to the breathing difficulties in DPB.|$|E

25|$|Pulquerías (or pulcherías) are {{a type of}} tavern in Mexico <b>that</b> <b>specialize</b> <b>in</b> serving an {{alcoholic}} beverage known as pulque.

Central to daily life and culture in Mexico, government authorities throughout history generally saw them as threats to the social order and {{the progress of the}} nation. Numerous restrictions were later put on pulquerías and the sale of pulque. Today, there are very few pulquerías left operating in Mexico.|$|E
