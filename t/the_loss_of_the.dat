5|$|A {{few times}} during the film, a loud, ringing tone evocative of {{tinnitus}} is heard.

5|$|A {{clinical}} exam {{is often}} used {{as a means to}} diagnose CSF leaks. Improved patient response to conservative treatment may further define a positive diagnosis. The lack of clinician awareness of the signs -symptoms and ailments- of a CSF leak is the greatest challenge to proper diagnosis and treatment, in particular: <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> orthostatic characteristic of headache and that every chronic CSF leaker will have a unique symptom set that as a whole contributes to the underlying condition, and diagnosis of, a CSF leak.|$|E
5|$|A release {{mechanism}} was provided on the gas-bag, such that, in an emergency, a {{pull on the}} attached rope would release hydrogen from the gas-bag.

5|$|Although {{opinions}} differed, some reactor experts {{feared that}} over time the hydrogen bubble might become flammable or, less likely, explosive by combining with free oxygen in the vessel.

3000|$|The stator voltage in Fig.  10 has a {{different}} phase to the stator current which compensates reactive current according to (20).

5|$|Between 1936 and 2001, {{the award}} was given {{at an annual}} gala {{ceremony}} at the Downtown Athletic Club in New York City. The Downtown Athletic Club's facilities were damaged during the September 11, 2001 attacks. Due to financial difficulties stemming from the damage, the DAC declared bankruptcy in 2002, turning over its building to creditors. Following the club's bankruptcy and <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original Downtown Athletic Club building, the Yale Club of New York City assumed presenting honors in 2002 and 2003. The ceremony {{was moved to the}} New York Marriott Marquis in Times Square for the 2002, 2003, and 2004 presentations, but since 2005, the event has been held at the venue now known as PlayStation Theater, also in Times Square. The move to the PlayStation Theater allowed the Downtown Athletic Club (and ultimately, the award's successor, The Heisman Trust) to resume full control of the event—the most prominent example of which was the return of the official portraits of past winners—despite <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original presentation hall.|$|E

40|$|Abstract.

We give similar bounds for temporal-di®erence learning. Learning {{takes place in}} a sequence <b>of</b> trials where <b>the</b> learner tries to predict discounted sums of future reinforcement signals. <b>The</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> predictions is measured with <b>the</b> square <b>loss</b> and we bound <b>the</b> total <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> on-line algorithm minus <b>the</b> total <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> best linear predictor for <b>the</b> whole sequence <b>of</b> trials.
