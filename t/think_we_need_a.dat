5000|$|Stephen Hicks, {{a reader}} {{in health and}} social care at the University of Salford {{questions}} the value of trying to establish that lesbian or gay parents are defective or suitable.

But, in order to ask this, I <b>think</b> that <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>a</b> wider range of research into lesbian and gay parenting...

It is much better, I think, because chess is becoming more and more simply memorization, because the power of memorization is so tremendous in chess now. Theory is so advanced, it used to be theory to maybe 10 or 15 moves, 18 moves; now, theory is going to 30 moves, 40 moves.

40|$|One of {{the things}} Dr. von Braun instinctively knew {{was that it was}} as nearly {{important}} to explain why we should go into space as to build the machines to take us there. He wrote books and magazine articles, spoke to everyone he could formally and informally, and spent his life to his dying day seeking to educate everyone on the importance of and need for spaceflight. Why should <b>we</b> go? I <b>think</b> there are actually two principle reasons: 1) Because the solar system is filled with cheap, clean energy, and <b>we</b> <b>need</b> to go get it, and, 2) this one may well be even more important, because <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>a</b> purpose for ourselves and our country. I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>an</b> eternal frontier to push up against, our purpose to conquer and settle it. The nice thing about doing that is the solar system is a very rich place, filled with not only mineral wealth but energy, a nearly inexhaustible supply. And if there s one thing this country and this planet desperately needs and is willing to pay for now and forever is energy. The solar system is where it is. We've got to go after it. I believe, then, that Americans have both a self-interest and a patriotic duty to convince ourselves it is time to take another giant step into space. The {{way to do that is}} to do what Dr. von Braun did, cut metal and start flying. Success engenders success. Dr. von Braun s grand dream need never die. NASA can spark a twenty-first-century revolution in transportation and energy that could fundamentally change the way we fly through space, power the world, even care for the sick if we do it right. All those things require cheap and clean energy. It exists in the solar system in a variety of forms. Solar energy is the most obvious form, but there are others, including helium- 3, which may be the perfect fuel for fusion reactors, and also just happens to cover the Moon. I believe we must go after it. <b>We</b> just <b>need</b> to believe in ourselves and our purpose. I call on all of you here today to join together, get things moving again, and get serious about conquering space. If we do, we'll assure the country s prosperity, and the world s survival, too, for centuries. Along the way, maybe we ll finally understand why my old preacher thought St. Peter s comment about looking for new heavens was so important. According to His promise, it s a big challenge, a huge responsibility, to try to fulfill such a promise and prophecy...|$|R
