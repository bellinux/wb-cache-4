5|$|The Gale of January 1976 on 2 January, brought {{winds of}} around 90mph (140km/h) which almost {{destroyed}} the telescope. <b>The</b> <b>towers</b> bowed, {{and one of}} the bearings connecting the dish to <b>the</b> <b>towers</b> slipped. After an expensive repair, diagonal bracing girders were added to <b>the</b> <b>towers</b> to prevent this happening again.|$|E

5|$|A {{peculiar}} {{feature of}} Muslim castles in the Iberian Peninsula {{was the use}} of detached towers, called Albarrana towers, around the perimeter as can be seen at the Alcazaba of Badajoz. Probably developed in the 12thcentury, <b>the</b> <b>towers</b> provided flanking fire. They were connected to the castle by removable wooden bridges, so if <b>the</b> <b>towers</b> were captured the rest of the castle was not accessible.|$|E

5|$|Designed by the {{architectural}} firm of Deeter & Ritchey, the complex {{was completed in}} 1963 and was named for former chancellor Edward Litchfield following his death in an airplane crash in 1968. The complex consists of three towers, which during construction were designated A, B, and C in {{the architectural}} plans. The names stuck after <b>the</b> <b>towers</b> were completed, and <b>the</b> <b>towers</b> are still so named today.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} architecture, the church {{features}} a round dome {{and a single}} apse. The naos or cella has {{the shape of a}} cross, in line with the popular Byzantine cross-in-square design. Of particular interest is the formerly two-storey narthex, which is notable for its unusual verticality and <b>the</b> <b>towers</b> {{on either side of the}} entrance. Judging by the models depicted in the donor's portraits inside the church, it is clear that <b>the</b> <b>towers</b> were originally further apart and the west facade with the narthex included much woodwork. <b>The</b> <b>towers</b> are topped off by sharp-pointed pyramidal elements, with additional sharp-pointed details in each of the pyramids' four corners. <b>The</b> <b>towers</b> and their design are entirely unusual and unprecedented in medieval Bulgarian church architecture. Art historian Nikola Mavrodinov believes these resemble Gothic architecture, though a more modern researcher, Bistra Nikolova, dismisses his assessment and considers these an influence from Hungary or Transylvania.|$|E
5|$|The west front has {{two large}} {{flanking}} three-stage towers. On the rear outer corners of <b>the</b> <b>towers</b> are octagonal stair turrets with panels on the belfry stage. Between <b>the</b> <b>towers</b> {{is a deep}} entrance arch of six orders with decorative Purbeck Marble colonnettes and enriched mouldings to the arch. The tympanum of the arch contains an empty niche.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Heris <b>Tower</b> is a {{skyscraper}} {{located in}} Konak, Izmir. <b>The</b> <b>tower</b> is 124 meters (407 ft.) tall. It {{was built in}} 2001, and has 26 floors. There is a pyramid {{on the top of}} <b>the</b> <b>tower.</b> <b>The</b> <b>tower</b> resembles <b>the</b> Melon Bank <b>Tower</b> in Philadelphia. <b>The</b> <b>tower</b> is <b>the</b> second tallest <b>tower</b> in Izmir behind the Hilton Izmir.|$|R
5|$|The {{relevance}} of Strype's reference to <b>the</b> <b>Tower</b> {{was more than}} geographical. The East End was the major part of an area called <b>the</b> <b>Tower</b> Division, which owed military service to <b>the</b> <b>Tower</b> of London. Later, as the East End grew and <b>the</b> <b>Tower</b> Division contracted, <b>the</b> East End became, arguably, conterminous with <b>the</b> <b>Tower</b> Division.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>tower</b> {{comprises}} three ironbark {{poles in}} a triangular plan, which taper inwards {{from the base}} of <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> to <b>the</b> top of <b>the</b> <b>tower.</b> Each pole consists of two logs spliced together approximately halfway up the height of <b>the</b> <b>tower,</b> and is set into a concrete footing at the base of <b>the</b> <b>tower.</b> Poles are braced and cross-braced.|$|R
5|$|A {{husband and}} wife who had lost their son {{as a result of}} the war offered {{themselves}} as the raw material of the final Master, but the woman's unknown pregnancy caused an imbalance that transformed the Masters into monsters. The husband and baby were rescued using the Oraclos Chain, but the wife became Zeron, a dark monster consumed with a want to reunite with her descendant and bring 'peace' to the land. The Vestra sealed the Masters in <b>the</b> <b>Towers</b> and guarded them, while the wife's child eventually became Aeron's ancestor. The wife's jealous want of her descendants caused her to curse people who grew close to them, with Elena being the latest victim of the curse. The Vestra brought each afflicted person to <b>the</b> <b>Towers</b> in the hopes that the Masters would be destroyed and Experiment Zero ended: Mavda was the latest guardian of <b>the</b> <b>Towers.</b> Four hundred and fifty years later, the Elyrian Army recreated the Masters as living weapons: without the knowledge and help of the Vestra, the Elyrians instigated a drastic geological upheaval that created the Scar, which acted as a portal to the netherworld.|$|E
5|$|Aeron's main {{weapon is}} the Oraclos Chain, an {{artifact}} {{that can be}} used in multiple ways: it can tie up enemies, bind enemies together so they share damage taken when Aeron attacks, and swing them around Aeron to deal damage. The Chain can also be used to rip armor or materials from enemies. The Chain's attack power increases the longer it is pulled when attached to an enemy. In addition to the Oraclos Chain, Aeron has access to multiple subweapons, such as a sword. Puzzles within <b>the</b> <b>Towers</b> include activating levers and switches, manipulating platforms, triggering special mechanisms unique to each Tower environment, and climbing along walls and beams to reach other areas within <b>the</b> <b>Towers.</b> The Chain is essential to these puzzles, being used as a grappling hook and a rope from which Aeron can swing from one platform to another. Elements within <b>the</b> <b>Towers,</b> such as what enemies are active and what items may be found, vary with the time of day Aeron visits them.|$|E
5|$|He {{destroyed}} the Orangery and partially demolished the castle. The {{walls of the}} north wing were badly damaged, <b>the</b> <b>towers</b> dismantled, the drawbridge removed and the deep ditch that defended the northwest of the castle was partly filled.|$|E

50|$|The {{focus in}} the novel is the three aspects of <b>the</b> <b>Tower</b> of London. To further this focus, Ainsworth depicts two crownings, a wedding, executions, and even a siege of <b>the</b> <b>Tower.</b> Lady Jane has her first night at <b>the</b> <b>Tower</b> as <b>the</b> Queen of England, and she visits St John's Chapel, located in <b>the</b> White <b>Tower.</b> Later, she is kept as <b>the</b> <b>Tower's</b> prisoner. Overall, <b>the</b> <b>Tower</b> has gothic {{elements}} along with having {{a connection to the}} Catholic Church in its architecture. <b>The</b> <b>Tower,</b> in its style, also represented the sublime and the connection with the divine. With these various dimensions to <b>the</b> <b>Tower,</b> there is a connection between <b>The</b> <b>Tower</b> of London and Victor Hugo's Notre Dame de Paris, in their emphasis on architecture and with history.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>towers</b> in {{the first}} phase include Rotana Hotel Amman, W Hotel Amman, The Heights Tower, Clemenceau Medical Center tower, Abdali mall tower, Abdali Gateway tower, K tower, Vertex Tower, Capital tower, Saraya {{headquarters}} tower and Hamad tower.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>towers</b> were {{designed}} as framed tube structures, giving tenants open floor plans, unobstructed by columns or walls. This design {{was accomplished by}} using many closely spaced perimeter columns, providing much of the structure's strength, with the gravity load shared with the core columns. The elevator system, which made use of sky lobbies and a system of express and local elevators, allowed substantial floor space {{to be used for}} office purposes by making the structural core smaller. The design and construction of <b>the</b> <b>towers</b> involved many other innovative techniques, such as wind tunnel experiments and the slurry wall for digging the foundation.|$|E
50|$|In <b>the</b> 1490s <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> was rebuilt in stone. In the 1680s {{a line of}} ramparts {{was added}} that {{connected}} <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> to <b>the</b> square <b>tower.</b> <b>The</b> upper section was later rebuilt during the Napoleonic wars. Between 1847 and 1850 the roof of <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> was modified {{to serve as a}} gun platform. Portsmouth city council purchased <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> in 1958.|$|R
50|$|In 1997 <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> {{underwent}} a renovation. The battlements were newly reinforced and <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> platform was completely reconstructed. Wooden steps were constructed inside <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> in <b>the</b> architectural {{style of the}} Middle Ages and today, visitors to Burg Bischofstein can {{climb to the top}} of <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> and enjoy <b>the</b> beautiful view of the Moselle Valley. The city flag of Krefeld flies at <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> summit.|$|R
5000|$|There are two stairs {{for walking}} up to <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> walls.

5|$|The {{university}} currently houses 11,000 beds on-campus {{in eight}} different housing communities. Residence hall style suites {{are available in}} the Libra, Apollo, Hercules, Nike, and Neptune communities. All of the residence hall suites have bathrooms shared between 2 or 3 rooms as opposed to communal bathrooms. Apartment-style housing is available in the Academic Village (Nike and Hercules) communities, <b>the</b> <b>Towers</b> at Knights Plaza, the Lake Claire Courtyard Apartments Community, and NorthView. UCF also has 400 beds at the Rosen College Apartments Community, located on the Rosen College of Hospitality Management campus. The majority of all on campus housing is occupied by freshman, though <b>The</b> <b>Towers</b> at Knights Plaza house mainly upper-classmen, student athletes, and honors students. Residents of <b>the</b> <b>Towers</b> Communities and Rosen College Apartments sign annual contracts to rent their apartments for a full academic year (fall, spring, and summer), whereas residents of all other standard housing communities on the main campus sign academic contracts to rent their rooms only for one or two semesters at a time. Housing on the main campus typically fills to capacity well {{before the start of the}} Fall semester, and cannot accommodate everyone who applies.|$|E
5|$|The {{walls of}} the inner ward contain {{extensive}} first floor passageways, similar to those at Caernarfon Castle. These were intended to allow members of the castle to move between <b>the</b> <b>towers,</b> accessing the guardrooms, sleeping chambers and the castle latrines. The latrines were designed to be drained by a special system using {{the water from the}} moat, but the system {{does not appear to have}} worked well in practice. The six towers were intended to be three storeys high and contained fireplaces. The castle chapel was built into one of <b>the</b> <b>towers</b> and would have been used by the king and his family, rather than the wider garrison.|$|E
5|$|Zahran {{district}} in west Amman is {{the location of}} the Jordan Gate Towers, the first high-rise towers in the city. It is a high-class commercial and residential project currently under construction, close to the 6th Circle. <b>The</b> <b>towers</b> are one of the best known skyscrapers in the city. The southern tower will host a Hilton Hotel, while the northern tower will host offices. <b>The</b> <b>towers</b> are separated by a podium that is planned to become a mall.
