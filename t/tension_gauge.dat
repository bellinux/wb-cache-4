50|$|Recent {{technological}} advances have now {{made it possible}} to measure the strength of a rider’s signals. Thus, riding concepts such as ‘contact’ and ‘lightness’ can now be evaluated with calibrated rein <b>tension</b> <b>gauges,</b> or via spurs and riding boots made from pressure-sensitive material. Radiographic studies can give insights into the horse’s mouth - the position of different bit types and positional changes in response to rein tension. Measuring pressures beneath the saddle on the horse’s back is valuable for assessing saddle fit and to circumvent back problems caused by ill-fitting saddles. Equitation science uses physiological measurements such as heart rate, blood, urine and saliva analyses to evaluate the comfort and stress level of the horse. It also evaluates behavioural indicators of ineffective horse-rider communication and conflict such as teeth grinding, tail swishing, rearing or bucking.|$|R

500|$|The basic {{gameplay}} {{system of}} Guilty Gear Isuka {{is like the}} other games in the series. The game uses a four attack button configuration that consists of punch, kick, slash, and high slash. Unlike previous games, it features a [...] "turn" [...] button, since a character does not automatically turn around if its opponent moves {{to the other side}} of the screen. Each character (or team) starts a fight with at least a [...] "soul"; when a character life bar is emptied, its life is filled while the player lost a soul. If the life is depleted when the player has no souls, it is defeated. It also features previous installments features like the <b>tension</b> <b>gauge,</b> which allows the player to perform super moves, and the burst gauge, which allows the player to break combinations and super moves.|$|E
500|$|In battle, {{the player}} {{controls}} Zael alone, {{with the rest}} of the party being controlled by the game's artificial intelligence (AI) and directed by player commands. Parties are composed of up to six characters, each with five [...] "lives", with them automatically reviving after a certain time if Zael cannot revive them manually. The attack directions of both party characters and enemies are represented by lines connecting the different characters. Combat plays out in real-time, with attacks either happening automatically when a character is within range or manually. Actions such as dodging and movement are done manually. Blocking and actions such as vaulting over low obstacles are performed by holding the B button. Zael can also move to take cover behind objects, which allows them to break an enemy's line of sight on them or creep along walls. During combat, a character's <b>Tension</b> <b>gauge</b> will fill, enabling the performance of special moves: these can vary from dealing damage to enemies across a wide area to reviving unconscious allies.|$|E
500|$|As with {{previous}} games, Innocence uses an retouched {{version of the}} [...] "Linear Motion Battle System" [...] (LMBS), a battle system involving direct control of characters similar to a fighting game. The version used is called the [...] "Dimension Stride LMBS". Full range of movement is available, and when enemies are launched into the air by attacks, characters can jump up after them and continue attacking. Three characters are controllable in battle, with one controlled by the player and two handled by the game's artificial intelligence (AI). There are standard attacks, and more powerful moves called Artes. The player can switch between characters instantly. By stringing attacks together into long combos or successfully defending against attacks, characters charge up their <b>tension</b> <b>gauge.</b> When fully charged, the selected character enters an [...] "awakened" [...] state, allowing their attacks to deal more damage. This state can be maintained {{as long as the}} player continues to successfully attack and defend without taking hits. If the right buttons are pressed during this period, the character teams up with the other two and unleashes powerful Artes. In addition to these standard and special attacks, each character can activate Mystic Artes, transforming into a form resembling their past selves to deal high amounts of damage. Defeated enemies drop items and currency that the player must collect before they fade or the battle ends. Whereas previous titles had set roles for characters in battle such as healing or ranged attacks, Innocence allows full customization of both the AI-controlled characters' rough roles and their detailed behavior. Materials gathered in exploration and battle can be fused with the weapons. Different fusions can both make the weapon stronger and grant special abilities, such as poisoning the enemy while striking it.|$|E

The work described in this thesis is concerned with a new method of measuring frictional torque In journal bearings. The method consists of driving a shaft up to a given speed inside a fixed bearing and then permitting it to decelerate freely. The decelerations are timed electronically and almost instantaneous deceleration rates are obtained. From these deceleration rates and known polar moment of Inertia, the frictional torque in the bearing can be found for given speeds.

2500|$|A paper card {{version of}} the MP Handy Guide was {{published}} with folded card sliders for the war effort {{under the auspices of}} the UK Ministry of Defence during World War II and was intended for use by people knitting gloves, socks and balaclavas for the troops. In the 1960s, The Aero Needles Group Plc of Redditch, England produced the Knitters Companion, a pocket {{version of the}} complex counter, consisting of a pierced bar of black plastic containing seven knurled, white, rotary, numbered discs whose numbers would appear through the piercings in the bar. [...] As in the MP Handy Guide, the numbers were labelled Increase, Decrease, Rows and Times. It was supplied with a soft plastic case which was intended to maintain memory of the count by preventing accidental movement of the discs. In 1972, UK magazine Woman's Weekly gave away its own card variation of this, with the numbers on dials with rotary paper pointers to record rows, increases or decreases, and times. Like the MP Handy Guide it incorporated a small inch-ruler and needle gauge, but now added a <b>tension</b> <b>gauge</b> measure and centimetre ruler.|$|E

40|$|The {{mechanical}} {{behavior of}} isolated cat, rat, and dog ventricular muscle was examined during hypoxia and after reoxygenation. During hypoxia, an early abbreviation of tension duration {{was followed by}} a decline in the rate of tension development. After reoxygenation, a marked, early prolongation of tension development and relaxation time was invariably observed with little, if any, increase in peak tension. As recovery progressed, the duration of contraction gradually shortened as tension returned to control levels. This phenomenon was also observed in the intact dog heart after release of a coronary artery ligature. Isometric <b>tension</b> <b>gauges</b> sewn to ischemic portions of the left ventricle demonstrated that after reinstitution of coronary flow, segment tension duration “outlasts” the duration of left ventricular pressure development and is associated with ventricular irritability. Epicardial electrograms showed shortening of the QT interval within the ischemic segment with prolongation of the QT interval after release of the coronary ligature. Prolongation of tension development during recovery from hypoxia was not observed in experiments with rat skeletal muscle. These observations identify localized mechanical abnormalities during recovery from myocardial ischemia which may be important in the syndrome of acute coronary heart disease...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Nitric oxide is {{a potent}} dilator of the {{pulmonary}} vasculature. There have been no previous reports on the action of nitric oxide on the arterial duct. OBJECTIVES [...] To determine the responses of isolated post-term arterial duct rings from lambs to oxygen, prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) and the nitric oxide donor, 3 -morpholinosydnonimine (SIN- 1). SETTING [...] Experimental laboratory. SUBJECTS [...] Six neonatal lambs. METHODS [...] Lambs aged 1 - 5 days were killed and the arterial duct and aorta excised and cut into rings. These were mounted on <b>tension</b> <b>gauges</b> in organ baths containing Krebs-Henseleit solution. Rings were exposed to increasing concentrations of oxygen, PGE 2 and after preconstriction with potassium (40 mmol/l) to SIN- 1. Tension and relaxation responses were recorded. RESULTS [...] Increased oxygen tension resulted in increased tension in the ductal rings above 88. 9 mm Hg as previously described. No response to PGE 2 occurred before or after ductal rings were exposed to oxygen. SIN- 1 caused relaxation of smooth muscle in the arterial duct to a similar degree as that in the aortic rings. CONCLUSIONS [...] As previously shown, oxygen {{is a potent}} constrictor of the arterial duct. The post-term arterial duct does not relax in response to PGE 2 possibly {{as a result of}} inactivation by oxygen of the special sensitivity of the duct to PGE 2. SIN- 1 is a potent smooth muscle relaxing agent in the term arterial duct and may have a role in the initial management of neonates with duct dependent pulmonary circulation...|$|R

40|$|Many {{cultures}} have trained horses using conventional approaches and acknowledged {{a talent for}} working with horses as natural horsemanship. The current popularity of “Natural Horsemanship” has prompted change in the equestrian industry. These changes extend from individuals to conventional training organizations. Academic ethologists were interested in these developments, but expressed concern at the way some Natural Horsemanship trainers presented “Equine Ethology”. Often personal opinions were claimed as facts, without any associated objective study of horse behaviour in the natural or domestic environment. Good Natural Horsemanship trainers are talented observers of horse behaviour and respond precisely to subtle cues during training. They have demonstrated their ability to utilize the marketplace and teach their methods for commercial reward. Unfortunately, not all followers of these methods are {{as effective as the}} originating trainers. Poor technique can lead to disappointing result, frustration and reduced safety in practitioners, and result in abuse, confusion and conflict behavior in horses. The success of Natural Horsemanship trainers encouraged scientists studying horse behaviour and training to be more active in communicating their work to horse owners and trainers. Science has much to offer in advancing techniques in horse training and reducing wastage by objectively assessing what does and does not work, and most importantly, why? Calibrated rein <b>tension</b> <b>gauges</b> and pressure sensitive pads can measure the strength and frequency of rider’s signals to the horse. Riders and trainers can integrate technology into their training methods to measure contact and lightness objectively. Assessment of welfare and performance is increasingly possible via a range of physiological and behavioural measures. Equitation scientists, conventional and Natural Horsemanship trainers aim to help people train horses more effectively. It is critical that we share our knowledge to achieve these goals because, when training fails, horses suffer and may pay the ultimate price with their lives...|$|R
