5|$|DOS (Disk Operating System) was the {{operating}} system that brought the company its real success. IBM first approached Microsoft about its upcoming IBM Personal Computer (IBM PC) in July 1980. On August 12, 1981, after negotiations with Digital Research failed, IBM awarded a contract to Microsoft to provide {{a version of the}} CP/M operating system, which was set to be used in <b>the</b> <b>IBM</b> PC. For this deal, Microsoft purchased a CP/M clone called 86-DOS from Tim Paterson of Seattle Computer Products for less than US$100,000, which IBM renamed to IBM PC DOS. Microsoft did not have an operating system when they closed the deal with IBM and IBM had not done their homework. Due to potential copyright infringement problems with CP/M, IBM marketed both CP/M and PC DOS for US$240 and US$40, respectively, with PC DOS eventually becoming the standard because of its lower price. 35 of the company's 100 employees worked on <b>the</b> <b>IBM</b> project for more than a year. When <b>the</b> <b>IBM</b> PC debuted, Microsoft was the only company that offered operating system, programming language, and application software for the new computer.|$|E

5|$|Upon being {{appointed}} corporate head of <b>the</b> <b>IBM</b> Design Program in 1989, Tom Hardy, {{initiated a}} strategic design management effort, {{in collaboration with}} IBM design consultant Richard Sapper, {{to return to the}} roots of <b>the</b> <b>IBM</b> Design Program first established in 1956 by Eliot Noyes, Paul Rand and Charles Eames. The intent was to reprise IBM's brand image with customer experience-driven quality, approachability and contemporary product innovation. The highly successful IBM ThinkPad was the first product to emerge from this strategy in 1992 and, together with other innovative, award-winning products that followed, served to position design as a strategic asset for IBM's brand turnaround efforts initiated in 1993 by newly appointed CEO Louis V. Gerstner, Jr.|$|E
5|$|A Museum of Computing {{was opened}} in 2001 in Žirmūnai by the Lithuanian {{software}} company Sintagma, showcasing {{the history of}} Lithuanian computing science and hardware production.

5|$|In 1983, in {{collaboration}} with numerous companies, Microsoft created a home computer system, MSX, which contained {{its own version of}} the DOS operating system, called MSX-DOS; this became relatively popular in Japan, Europe and South America. Later, the market saw a flood of IBM PC clones after Columbia Data Products successfully cloned <b>the</b> <b>IBM</b> BIOS, quickly followed by Eagle Computer and Compaq. The deal with IBM allowed Microsoft to have control of its own QDOS derivative, MS-DOS, and through aggressive marketing of the operating system to manufacturers of IBM-PC clones Microsoft rose from a small player to one of the major software vendors in the home computer industry. With the release of the Microsoft Mouse on May 2, 1983, Microsoft continued to expand its product line in other markets. This expansion included Microsoft Press, a book publishing division, on July 11 the same year, which debuted with two titles: Exploring <b>the</b> <b>IBM</b> PCjr Home Computer by Peter Norton, and The Apple Macintosh Book by Cary Lu.|$|E
50|$|Rational Performance Tester 6.1 Released May, 2005. Initial release. Note {{this was}} this first release of <b>the</b> Eclipse-based <b>IBM</b> Rational Performance Tester.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to assess changes in subarachnoid space width (sas-TQ), the marker of {{intracranial}} pressure (ICP), pial artery pulsation (cc-TQ) and cardiac contribution to blood pressure (BP), cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) and cc-TQ oscillations throughout the maximal breath hold in elite apnoea divers. Non-invasive assessment of sas-TQ and cc-TQ became possible due to recently developed method based on infrared radiation, called near-infrared transillumination/backscattering sounding (NIR-T/BSS). The experimental group consisted of seven breath-hold divers (six men). During testing, each participant performed a single maximal end-inspiratory breath hold. Apnoea consisted of the easy-going and struggle phases (characterised by involuntary breathing movements (IBMs)). Heart rate (HR) was determined using a standard ECG. BP was assessed using the photoplethysmography method. SaO 2 was monitored continuously with pulse oximetry. A pneumatic chest belt was used to register thoracic and abdominal movements. Cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) was estimated by a 2 -MHz transcranial Doppler ultrasonic probe. sas-TQ and cc-TQ were measured using NIR-T/BSS. Wavelet transform analysis was performed to assess cardiac contribution to BP, CBFV and cc-TQ oscillations. Mean BP and CBFV increased compared to baseline at the end of the easy phase and were further augmented by IBMs. cc-TQ increased compared to baseline at the end of the easy phase and remained stable during <b>the</b> <b>IBMs.</b> HR did not change significantly throughout the apnoea, although a trend toward a decrease during the easy phase and recovery during <b>the</b> <b>IBMs</b> was visible. Amplitudes of BP, CBFV and cc-TQ were augmented. sas-TQ and SaO 2 decreased at the easy phase of apnoea and further decreased during <b>the</b> <b>IBMs.</b> Apnoea increases intracranial pressure and pial artery pulsation. Pial artery pulsation seems to be stabilised by <b>the</b> <b>IBMs.</b> Cardiac contribution to BP, CBFV and cc-TQ oscillations does not change throughout the apnoea...|$|R
