The Automotive transportation system can be the carrier system for several kinds of extensions because of its design. In this case, the investigated transport system in selected company uses the back of the bulk materials, tanks and bulk truck. It was the truck LIAZ 151 with hull CSAO for bulk materials, faecal tank ACF 041 and high-volume hull type for transport bulky feed. Operating and investment costs of the whole transport system, performance of each swap bodies and technical parameters were evaluated. The primary agricultural enterprise ZD Trhový Štěpánov, a. s. was also characterized. For this thesis were detected information by observing and processing time of each frame bodies. More information has been gathered from internal materials, such as a serious journal, time sheets, annual report and other enterprise data sources. In terms of economic costs, these costs have been identified - costs per km = 27, 91 CZK/km, costs per <b>tonne</b> <b>transported</b> = 52, 93 CZK/t and costs per tonne-km = 7, 46 CZK/tkm.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the problem of}} {{establishing}} an integrated intermodal system among the motorways {{of the sea and}} the East-Mediterranean land transport system is investigated. First of all an overview of the main features of the Italian motorways of the sea system and the East-Mediterranean land transport system is carried out. Italian trade access to the Balkan Area takes place through: a land route and a land-sea route. The first segment of the land route is made up by Pan-European Corridor V; the second segment is constituted by the “trans Balkan way” (corridor X). The sea route is fundamentally based on ro-ro shipping which links regularly the two Adriatic shores. In this context, some segments of the Pan-European Corridor VIII and the Via Egnatia project may give to the Italian ports the opportunity to develop new motorways of the sea services, particularly to/from Albania and Greece, that could be integrated in the new land-sea intermodal axes. In the article the Via Egnatia project is described: the modern Egnatia highway crosses North Greece linking Igoumenitsa, on western coast of Greece, with Alexandroupoli and Kipi on eastern border of the country; the travel time is expected to pass from 11. 5 hours to 6. 5 hours after the complete construction of the highway. In {{the second part of the}} paper the trade exchange between Italy and Southern Balkans is examined, by distinguishing different transport modes. The analysis has taken into account the import/export volumes among Italy and: Greece, Turkey, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, FYROM, Serbia, Montenegro and Kosovo. Ten classes of goods have been considered. From the data analysis it can be noticed that: Turkey and Greece are the major Southern-Balkan trade partners of Italy; trade volumes show an increase in 2006 compared to 2001 values. As far as the transport mode used is concerned it can be observed that: sea dominates, in terms of <b>tonnes</b> <b>transported,</b> the traffic between Italy and Turkey; road-only transport is predominant for traffic to/from Romania and it corresponds to almost half the maritime transport volumes to/from Greece. On the other hand, if the value of transported goods is taken into account, road dominates the other transport modes, with the exception of export/import with Turkey and Albania (where maritime transport prevails). Ro-ro traffic data, for the years 2002 - 2007, have been collected for the two major South Adriatic ports: Bari and Igoumenitsa. With respect to passenger, car and bus traffic, no dramatic increase has been observed. A more significant increase in traffic flows can be appreciated with reference to ro-ro freight traffic, but this increase has not been uniformly distributed. Bari port has consolidated its role as the major door of Western Europe to/from Southern Balkan region for ro-ro traffic. On the other hand the market shares of Brindisi, Ancona and Venice have declined (particularly for Brindisi). It has to be underlined that the most relevant infrastructural intervention that is about to be completed and that can effectively improve the level of service and the connectivity of the East-Mediterranean land transport network is Via Egnatia: the transnational rail-road Corridor VIII, in contrast, appears to be far to be implemented. Via Egnatia project is therefore likely to produce a twofold impact on the development of new motorways of the sea lines in the East-Mediterranean area: it may limit the development of new direct ro-ro freight links between Italy and the Black Sea ports; it may strengthen the short-haul ro-ro sea lines between Italy and Greece. Finally, it has to be highlighted that the full deployment of the motorways of the sea system requires some interventions at port nodes to be exploited. The quality of port services and hinterland connections represents the basic condition to create a fully integrated intermodal land-sea transport corridor...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{determine}} whether the Northern Sea Route (NSR) is a more cost effective alternative than the Suez Canal Route (SCR) between Asia and Europe, given an introduction of an Emission Control Area (ECA) in the Arctic Ocean. A case study is performed, based on transport of iron ore between Murmansk, Russia and Tianjin, China. The vessel used in the study is a 75 000 DWT Panamax bulk carrier with ice class 1 A. The study is performed for a time period of one year. Actual ice data from 2008 and 2009 is used in the study. A MATLAB model is developed to perform the simulations. The study compares several scenarios for complying with ECA regulations. The alternative approaches to compliance are either fuel switch, retrofitting the vessel with exhaust cleaning technology, converting the main machinery to also run on alternative fuels or a combination of these. The scenarios in the study are defined as follows: 1. Exhaust cleaning only: The vessel burns only Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO). The vessel is retrofitted with a scrubber to clean SOx emissions, and a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) unit to reduce NOx emissions. 2. Combine fuel switch and exhaust cleaning: The vessel burns HFO outside ECAs, and switch to Marine Gas Oil (MGO) upon entering an ECA. MGO has a negligible sulphur content, and therefore no abatement 3. Conversion of main machinery to dual fuel (DF) operation combined with exhaust cleaning: The main engine of the vessel is converted to operate on DF. Thus, the vessel can operate on both HFO and liquified natural gas (LNG). In addition, the vessel is retrofitted with an exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) unit, for reduction of NOx emissions. Scenarios 1 - 3 sail on the NSR when the ice conditions allow for sailing. For the case vessel, this is found to be for ice thicknesses below 123 cm. When the maximum ice thickness along the NSR grows thicker than 123 cm, the vessels sail on the SCR. The performances of scenarios 1 - 3 are evaluated against a base case. The base case is defined as the vessel sailing only on the SCR for the whole simulation time period, with no emission abatement measures installed. The vessel switch to MGO when sailing through the SOx ECA in Northern Europe. The scenarios are evaluated based on costs, emissions and cost effectiveness. Investment costs (CAPEX), operating costs (OPEX) and equivalent annual costs (EAC) are calculated for each scenario. For CAPEX and OPEX, only differences from the base case scenario are considered. For emissions, the scenarios are evaluated in terms of total reduced emissions and also reduced emissions per <b>tonne</b> cargo <b>transported.</b> Emissions of CO 2, SOx, NOx and particulate matter (PM) are considered. Also cost effectiveness for reduced emissions and per <b>tonne</b> <b>transported</b> cargo is considered. Resistance, speed and fuel consumption for the vessel along the NSR vary according to the ice conditions. As emissions are related to both fuel consumption and engine load, emissions and specific fuel consumption are modeled accordingly in the model. The main findings of the study are as follows: - By utilising the NSR, the vessels can sail one extra roundtrip each year (six roundrips on the NSR vs five roundtrips on the SCR); - Scenarios 1 - 3 have less total emissions per year than the base case scenario. Scenario 3 give the greatest reductions in total emissions; - Scenarios 1 - 3 are more environmentally friendly, and emits less per tonne cargo freight for all emission types; - The base case scenario is the most cost effective in terms of USD/tonne cargo. All scenarios 1 - 3 come out relatively equal in cost effectiveness. The study concludes that utilising the NSR with an ECA in the Arctic Ocean will not be cost effective compared to sailing the SCR. The main reasons for this are the limited operation window on the NSR, the high investment costs of retrofitting abatement technology and the increased operating costs in ECAs due to operation on more expensive fuel...|$|R
