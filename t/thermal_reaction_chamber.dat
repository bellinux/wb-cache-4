40|$|An {{optimized}} spectroscopic method combining quantitative {{evolved gas}} analysis via Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR-EGA) and qualitative in situ thermal reaction monitoring via diffuse reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (in situT DRIFTS) is being proposed to rapidly characterize soil organic matter (SOM) to study its dynamics and stability. A <b>thermal</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>chamber</b> coupled with an infrared gas cell was used to study the pattern of thermal evolution of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) in order to relate evolved gas to different qualities of soil organic matter (SOM). Soil samples were from three different sites, i. e. (i) the Static Fertilization Experiment, Bad Lauchstädt (Chernozem) from treatments of farmyard manure (FYM), mineral fertilizer (NPK), combination (FYM + NPK) and control without fertilizer inputs, and cropped soils from the (ii) Kraichgau and (iii) Swabian Alb (Cambisols) areas, Southwest Germany. Soils from Kraichgau and Swabian Alb were further fractionated into particulate organic matter (POM), sand and stable aggregates (Sa + A), silt and clay (Si + C), and NaOCl oxidized Si + C (rSOC) to gain OM of different inferred stabilities. Fresh soil samples from the Kraichgau and Swabian Alb were incubated at 20 °C and 50 % water holding capacity for 490 days {{in order to measure}} soil respiration under controlled conditions. A variable long path length gas cell was used to record the mid-infrared absorbance intensity of carbon dioxide (2400 to 2200 cm&minus; 1 ) being evolved during soil heating from 25 to 700 °C with a heating rate of 68 °C min− 1 during an initial ramping time of 10 min and holding time of 10 min. Separately the heating chamber was placed in a diffuse reflectance chamber (DRIFTS) for measuring the mid-infrared absorption of the soil sample during heating. Thermal stability of the bulk soils and fractions was measured via the temperature of maximum CO 2 (2400 to 2200 cm&minus; 1 evolution (CO 2 ). Results indicated that the FYM + NPK and FYM treatments of the Chernozem soils of Bad Lauchstädt had a lower CO 2 max as compared to both NPK and CON treatments. On average CO 2 max in Bad Lauchstädt was much higher (447 °C) as compared to the Kraichgau (392 °C) and Swabian Alb (384 °C) sites. The POM fraction had the highest CO 2 (477 °C), while rSOC had a first peak at 265 °C at both sites and a second peak at 392 °C for the Swabian Alb and 482 °C for the Kraichgau. The CO 2 was found to increase after 490 day incubation, while the C lost during incubation was derived from the whole temperature range but a relatively higher proportion from 200 to 350 °C. In situT DRIFTS measurements indicated decreases in vibrational intensities in the order of C-OH = unknown C vibration &lt;C-H&lt;–COO/C=C&lt;C=C with increasing temperature, but interpretation of vibrational changes was complicated by changes in the spectra (i. e. overall vibrational intensity increased with temperature increase) of the sample during heating. The relative quality changes and corresponding temperatures shown by the in situT DRIFTS measurements enabled the fitting of four components or peaks to the evolved CO 2 thermogram from the FTIR-EGA measurements to have a semi-quantitative measure of the quality of evolved C during the heating experiment, lending more evidence that different qualities of SOM are being evolved at different temperatures from 200 to 700 °C. The CO 2 was influenced by long-term farmyard manure input and also by 490 days of laboratory incubation, indicating that this measurement can be an indicator for the relative overall SOM stability. The combination of FTIR-EGA and in situT DRIFTS was shown to be useful for monitoring the rate of thermal decomposition of different soils and SOM fractions which were related to their relative stability. This knowledge was used for a peak fitting procedure for assigning proportions of evolved CO 2 to different thermal stability components...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a three dimensional on-chip microfabricated calorimeter (μ-calorimeter) to extract thermal diffusivity and {{specific heat capacity}} of liquid samples. These thermal properties are used to understand <b>thermal</b> <b>reaction</b> behavior, obtain information of stability for reactant molecules, and characterize a material. Thermally characterized solvents can be utilized to investigate a solute. The μ-calorimeter introduced in this work has 3 D wafer-scale structure. The μ-calorimeter consists of a <b>reaction</b> <b>chamber,</b> a nickel heater, and a resistance temperature detector (RTD) sensor. The <b>reaction</b> <b>chamber</b> enables analysis of 200 nl liquid samples. Also, its enclosed structure prevents liquid sample evaporation during an experiment. The heater and the sensor are integrated {{on the top and}} bottom sides of the <b>reaction</b> <b>chamber.</b> The heat flux travels directly through a liquid sample from the heater to the sensor with this configuration. The heat penetration time measurement and thermal wave analysis (TWA) are used to measure thermal diffusivity and specific heat respectively. The heat penetration time measurement is the method that measures the heat penetration time through the liquid sample. Depending on the thermal diffusivity of the liquid sample and the heat flux distance, the heat penetration time alters. Since the geometry of the chamber is known, measuring heat penetration time allows detection of the thermal diffusivity of the liquid sample. The TWA is an AC calorimetry method. When an AC voltage of angular frequency, 2 ω, is given to the heater, heat is generated by Joule heating at 2 ω frequency. The heat capacitance of the sample can be extracted by measuring this 2 ω component from the heater. Based on the experimental work of μ-calorimeter, a new measurement system for thermal analysis is introduced. The new system is available to minimize the distance between heater and sensor and facilitate user friendly operation...|$|R

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - Apparatus for gasification of carbon containing solid fuel has a vertically extended <b>reaction</b> <b>chamber</b> (9) with a lower region, which forms a fluidized bed (7) and an upper region (8) which has an outlet (11) for the produced fuel gas; an inlet (1) for oxygen containing gas in the lower region of the <b>reaction</b> <b>chamber</b> and an inlet (2) for the solid fuel in the lower region of the <b>reaction</b> <b>chamber.</b> A further inlet (3) for an oxygen containing gas is in the upper region (8) of the <b>reaction</b> <b>chamber.</b> USE - Used for gasification of carbon containing solid fuel to produced fuel gas...|$|R

50|$|A major design {{weakness}} of the electrocoagulation units is the method used in connecting the electrode to the power source. These designs cause overheating resulting in premature failure of the electrocoagulation <b>reaction</b> <b>chamber.</b> VEP <b>reaction</b> <b>chambers</b> are designed to resolve these performance issues by changing all electrode connections from the standard wet connection (inside the chamber) to an external dry connection. The VEP is cooler-operating and has a longer chamber life than an electrocoagulation unit.|$|R
40|$|Constructive in the {{synthesis}} of quinone derivatives {{is the fact that}} the photochemical and <b>thermal</b> <b>reactions</b> of 2 -methoxy- 1, 4 -naphthoquinone with amines result in substitution at two different sites. The scope and limitation of these two reactions was studied by using various primary and secondary amines. The photochemical reaction was more sensitive to the degree of substitution on the nitrogen atom than the <b>thermal</b> <b>reaction.</b> All primary amines gave 2 -alkylamino- 3 -methoxy- 1, 4 -naphthoquinone as the major photochemical product. Secondary amines, in general, failed to produce similar photochemical products. The <b>thermal</b> <b>reaction,</b> unlike the photochemical reaction, went smoothly with both primary and secondary amines, forming 2 -alkylamino- 1, 4 -naphthoquinone by replacing the 2 -methoxy group. Interestingly, in the <b>thermal</b> <b>reaction</b> with secondary amines, further dealkylation lead to unexpected products. For example, 2 -methylamino- 1, 4 -naphthoquinone is the major product in the reaction with N-methyl-isopropylamine...|$|R
