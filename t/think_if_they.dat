2500|$|The Iranian {{government}} {{responded that}} [...] "the Western media empire {{is trying to}} portray Iran as an anti-Semitic country". In addition, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said that [...] "Jews are respected by everyone, by all human beings... some people <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> accuse me of being anti-Jew they can solve the problem.

2500|$|Although Russell {{had planned}} to release the film before November 2004, hoping to [...] "perhaps make a {{difference}} before the election," [...] Warner Bros. abandoned the project at the last minute, citing [...] "controversy surrounding the documentary, combined with a later-than-expected arrival of the bonus footage". Russell disputed the time-crunch excuse, saying [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> really wanted to they could make it happen."

His form dipped at times, arguably due to a {{combination}} of injuries, being restricted to substitute appearances (as Houllier wanted to cut the side's dependency on his gameplay and replace him), and loss of confidence in certain games where even the home fans turned against him over the contract debacle, with some labelling him a [...] "traitor" [...] and a Judas figure. McManaman told the media after one such game where he became victim of the [...] "boo boys", saying, [...] "That's understandable, when I came off the other day I knew the reaction there was going to be.
