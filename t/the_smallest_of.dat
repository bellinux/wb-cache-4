5|$|After Miranda, Ariel is the second-smallest of Uranus' {{five major}} rounded {{satellites}} and the second-closest to its planet. Among <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> <b>of</b> the Solar System's 19 known spherical moons (it ranks 14th among them in diameter), {{it is believed}} to be composed of roughly equal parts ice and rocky material. Its mass is approximately equal in magnitude to Earth's hydrosphere.|$|E

5|$|Akodon caenosus is <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> <b>of</b> the Argentine {{members of}} the A.boliviensis group–indeed, among <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> <b>of</b> all species of Akodon. The upperparts are uniformly colored, but their tone is variable: {{generally}} ochraceous brown, but approaching yellow, red, or olivaceous in some individuals. Reddish tones occur mostly in lactating females. High-altitude animals are generally lighter, {{but there is also}} conspicuous variation within populations. The ears are similar to the upperparts, but some individuals have the sides more rich and clear in color. The underparts are clearly different in color, varying from light gray to yellowish or reddish. There are yellowish rings around the eyes, which are more highly developed in high-altitude populations. There are white to yellowish hairs on the fore- and hindfeet. The tail is variably covered with hair and is dark brown above and white to buffy below.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{distance}} of Neptune from Earth, its angular diameter only ranges from 2.2 to 2.4arcseconds, <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> <b>of</b> the Solar System planets. Its small apparent size makes it challenging to study it visually. Most telescopic data was fairly limited until {{the advent of the}} Hubble Space Telescope and large ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics (AO).|$|E
5|$|M. l. leucopterus is {{restricted}} to Dirk Hartog Island, off the western coast of Australia, and nuptial males display black-and-white plumage.

It was collected again in 1916 by Tom Carter, 98years after de Freycinet's expedition collected the type specimen.|$|E

5|$|Puck is {{the largest}} small inner moon of Uranus, which orbits inside the orbit of Miranda. It is {{intermediate}} in size between Portia (the second-largest inner moon) and Miranda (<b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> <b>of</b> the five large classical moons). Puck's orbit is located between the rings of Uranus and Miranda. Little is known about Puck aside from its orbit, radius of about 81km, and geometric albedo in visible light of approximately 0.11.|$|E

5|$|The Indian subcontinent is {{the range}} of {{subspecies}} N. p. ginginianus, <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> <b>of</b> the three subspecies, which is identifiable by a pale yellow bill.

5|$|The basic {{engineering}} {{for all the}} German half-tracks was developed during the Weimar-era by the Reichswehr's Military Automotive Department, but final design and testing was farmed out to commercial firms {{with the understanding that}} production would be shared with multiple companies.

5|$|About {{the size}} of a rabbit, the tammar is among <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> <b>of</b> the {{wallabies}} in the genus Macropus. Its coat colour is largely grey. The tammar has several notable adaptations, including the ability to retain energy while hopping, colour vision and the ability to drink seawater. A nocturnal species, it spends nighttime in grassland habitat and daytime in shrubland. It is also very gregarious and has a seasonal, promiscuous mating pattern. A female tammar can nurse a joey in her pouch while keeping an embryo in her uterus. The tammar is a model species for research on marsupials, and on mammals in general. It is one of many organisms to have had its genome sequenced.|$|E
5|$|Adrastea has an {{irregular}} shape and measures 20×16×14km across. A surface area estimate would be between 840 and 1,600 (~1,200) km2. This makes it <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> <b>of</b> the four inner moons. The bulk, composition and mass of Adrastea are not known, but assuming that its mean density {{is like that}} of Amalthea, around 0.86g/cm3, its mass can be estimated at about 2kg. Amalthea's density implies that the moon is composed of water ice with a porosity of 10–15%, and Adrastea may be similar.|$|E

5|$|At room temperature, it is a {{colourless}} gas, {{like all}} of the hydrogen halides except hydrogen fluoride, since hydrogen cannot form strong hydrogen bonds to the large and only mildly electronegative iodine atom. It melts at −51.0°C and boils at −35.1°C. It is an endothermic compound that can exothermically dissociate at room temperature, although the process is very slow unless a catalyst is present: the reaction between hydrogen and iodine at room temperature to give hydrogen iodide does not proceed to completion. The H–I bond dissociation energy is likewise <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> <b>of</b> the hydrogen halides, at 295kJ/mol.|$|E
5|$|Grave Circle A, with a {{diameter}} of , is situated on the acropolis of Mycenae southeast of the Lion Gate. The site is surrounded by two rows of slabs, while {{the space between the}} rows was filled with earth and roofed with slabs. The Grave Circle contains six shaft graves, <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> <b>of</b> which is measured at 3.0 m by 3.5 m and the largest measured at 4.50 m by 6.40 m (the depth of each shaft grave ranges from 1.0 m to 4.0 m). Over each grave a mound was constructed and stelae were erected. These stelae had been probably erected in memory of the Mycenaean rulers buried there; three of them depict chariot scenes.|$|E
5|$|In the past, {{there were}} {{problems}} {{with all of these}} hypotheses: the regressive hypothesis did not explain why even <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> <b>of</b> cellular parasites do not resemble viruses in any way. The escape hypothesis did not explain the complex capsids and other structures on virus particles. The virus-first hypothesis contravened the definition of viruses in that they require host cells. Viruses are now recognised as ancient and as having origins that pre-date the divergence of life into the three domains. This discovery has led modern virologists to reconsider and re-evaluate these three classical hypotheses.|$|E
