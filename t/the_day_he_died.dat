However, in 1924, over {{disagreement}} concerning the development of Comintern policies, thinking there was too much direct control from Moscow, Höglund split from Swedish Communist Party and founded his own Communist Party. In 1926 he rejoined the Swedish Social Democratic Party, where {{he was part of the}} radical left.

Although he never achieved victory in a World Championship Formula One race, he managed an unquenchable thirst for motorsport, being considered a formidable competitor to <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>he</b> <b>died.</b> He hit the headlines when he won the non-title 1952 Reims Grand Prix. Between then and 1959 he scored many victories, but none in Formula One championship races.|$|E

In 1961, he married Czech screenwriter Milena Jelinek. At IBM, his team advanced approaches to computer speech recognition and machine translation.

25|$|In 1607, on {{the death}} of Sir John Popham, Fleming was {{elevated}} to the post of Lord Chief Justice of England. The following year he obtained a Charter for Incorporation for Newport from the King, providing for the election of a Mayor instead of the historical appointed Bailiff. He assisted in the establishment of a free grammar school in the town. Also in 1608, Fleming was one of the judges at the trial of the post nati in 1608, siding with the majority of the judges in declaring that persons born in Scotland after the accession of James I were entitled to the privileges of natural-born subjects in England. The convocation of Oxford University granted him the award of MA on 7 August 1613, which was <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>he</b> <b>died.</b>|$|E
500|$|Moran's {{accounts}} even altered dates. At different points, {{he claimed}} Poe {{was brought to}} the hospital on October 3 at 5 p.m., on October 6 at 9 a.m., or on October 7 (<b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>he</b> <b>died)</b> at [...] "10 o'clock in the afternoon". For each published account, he claimed to have the hospital records as reference. A search for hospital records a century later, specifically an official death certificate, found nothing. Some critics claim Moran's inconsistencies and errors were due only to a lapse of memory, an innocent desire to romanticize, or even to senility. At the time he wrote and published his last account in 1885, Moran was 65.|$|E
500|$|Flanagan's {{influence}} on pianists extended from his contemporaries to later generations. Contemporaries included fellow Detroit players Barry Harris and Roland Hanna. Lightsey {{was influenced by}} Flanagan's musical creative thinking and pianistic fluidity. Alan Broadbent also acknowledged Flanagan as an influence, as did Helen Sung, who changed from being a classical music pianist to a jazz one after hearing the swing and logic of a Flanagan solo. Kenny Barron described Flanagan as his [...] "hero" [...] and stated that he admired the older man's touch and phrasing from when he first heard it at junior high school: [...] "He became an influence and continued to be an influence till <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>he</b> <b>died</b> – and he still is." ...|$|E

500|$|... since <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>he</b> <b>died.</b> In {{the days}} {{immediately}} following his death, Craik and Dick's published account {{stated that they}} felt that his symptoms had been consistent with cynanche trachealis, a term of that period used to describe severe inflammation of the structures of the upper airway. Even at that early date, there were accusations of medical malpractice, with some believing that Washington had been bled to death. Various modern medical authors have speculated that Washington probably died from a severe case of epiglottitis which was complicated by the given treatments (all of which were accepted medical practice in Washington's day), most notably the massive deliberate blood loss, which almost certainly caused hypovolemic shock.|$|E
500|$|By the 1951 season, media sources {{had given}} the {{nickname}} [...] "Big Four" [...] to the pitching combination of Garcia, Bob Feller, Bob Lemon and Early Wynn. Garcia had learned to control the curveball that Harder taught him in spring training of 1949. Harder said that Garcia already had a terrific fastball, but that he became a good pitcher by learning the curveball and working on his control. Cleveland sportswriter Hal Lebovitz wrote, [...] "Garcia, until <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>he</b> <b>died,</b> would {{tell me how much}} of the success he owed to Harder." [...] Garcia also once admitted to throwing an occasional spitball, an illegal pitch. [...] "Maybe a dozen in my life. I'm sure plenty of the great pitchers did", he said.|$|E
500|$|During {{the course}} of his wrestling career, he was married twice. While both marriages ended in divorce, he and his second wife {{remained}} close until <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>he</b> <b>died.</b> Swede's marriages brought him seven children and twelve grandchildren. Swede's first marriage to a woman named Vicky, brought him a daughter and son, named Linda and Lance. Then he married a woman named Doris, which brought him another daughter and son, Luana and Bobby. He also gained a stepson, Billy Roy and two adopted children, Mary and Carol, through his second marriage. Hanson lived in Charlotte, NC for over 20+ years. In the late 80's, Hanson and his second wife moved to Fort Mill, SC. After divorcing his second wife, he remained living in a double-wide mobile home on five acres of land in Fort Mill, South Carolina. [...] He was later engaged to a woman named Patsy Hughes.|$|E

500|$|Mark Dennis QC, for the prosecution, {{argued that}} Harwood's {{use of force}} against Tomlinson had been {{unnecessary}} and unreasonable, and had caused Tomlinson's death. He argued that a [...] "clear temporal link" [...] between the incident and Tomlinson's collapse had been provided by the Guardian video, that Tomlinson had posed no threat, and that the use of force had been a [...] "gratuitous act of aggression." [...] The defence argued that Tomlinson's health was relevant. The court heard that he had liver and brain disease caused by alcohol abuse, numbness in his legs and balance problems, and that he had been treated at least 20 times between 2007 and 2009, mostly at A departments, related to falling while drunk. On <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>he</b> <b>died,</b> The Times reported, he had drunk a bottle of red wine, a small bottle of vodka and several cans of 9-per-cent super-strength lager.|$|E
500|$|In 1968, after 25 {{years with}} the Hallé, Barbirolli retired from the {{principal}} conductorship; no successor was appointed in his lifetime. He was appointed the orchestra's Conductor Laureate. He {{reduced the number of}} his appearances with the Hallé, but nevertheless took it on another European tour in 1968, this time to Switzerland, Austria and Germany. In his last years a propensity to concentrate on detail {{at the expense of the}} whole of a piece became marked. His loyal friend and admirer the critic Neville Cardus wrote privately in 1969, [...] "he seems so much to love a single phrase that he lingers over it, caressing it; meanwhile the general momentum is lost." [...] His final year, 1970, was dogged by heart trouble; he suffered collapses in April, May, June and July. His last two concerts were with the Hallé at the 1970 King's Lynn Festival. He produced [...] "inspired" [...] renderings of Elgar's Symphony No. 1 and Sea Pictures. The last work he conducted in public was Beethoven's Symphony No. 7 on the Saturday before his death. On <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>he</b> <b>died,</b> 29 July 1970, he spent several hours rehearsing the New Philharmonia Orchestra for a forthcoming tour of Japan that he was scheduled to lead.|$|E
500|$|Canadian {{teams were}} facing their own troubles, {{particularly}} with attendance. The eight Canadian teams {{were down to}} an average of 22,740 in 1994, a drop of 3,000 from the previous year. It marked the beginning of an historic trough in Canadian CFL attendance that would last for most of the 1990s. A massive season ticket drive was undertaken prior to 1995. [...] Smith told the Rough Riders and Tiger-Cats that unless they sold more tickets, they would be forced to either fold or move. Ottawa owner Bruce Firestone went bankrupt after the 1994 season, placing the team in the hands of Horn Chen, its ultimately final owner. In Calgary, Ryckman suggested he'd move to the United States unless fans stepped up with 16,000 season tickets. While season ticket goals were met, the overall increase in attendance was modest in 1995 to 24,406 and would be wiped out the next year. In Toronto, Bruce McNall's finances collapsed in the midst of revelations of financial wrongdoing, and because Wayne Gretzky's salary relied on McNall, and John Candy had put his share in the team up for sale <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>he</b> <b>died,</b> the Argonauts effectively had no owners; the team would be operated by television partner TSN {{through the rest of the}} 1990s.|$|E
