40|$|<b>Terraced</b> <b>landscapes</b> {{represent}} one of {{the main}} features of many cultural landscapes; their position in between the agrarian landscape and built artefacts has not ensured them adequate protection since agriculture in many industrialized countries is declining. After looking at the evolution of cultural landscapes protection in Japan and Italy within its European context, the paper focuses on how the consideration of <b>terraced</b> <b>landscapes</b> has been changing in the past three decades. After the adoption of the cultural landscapes category by UNESCO in 1992 many actions for cultural landscape protection have been undertaken in Japan and Italy. The paper analyses legislation, measures, projects and bottom-up initiatives for cultural <b>landscape</b> protection involving <b>terraced</b> <b>landscapes.</b> Regarding Japan their protection is limited to a small number when referring to legislation. On the contrary, individual or local actions seem to be much more proactive and effective for <b>terraced</b> <b>landscapes</b> maintenance. On the other hand the Italian system for cultural landscape protection is extended to the entire national territory and can count on a strict control of transformations by the cultural properties sector. Unfortunately such a strict control system does not rely on active policies based on aids or incentives. Some little help comes from other sectors like the nature conservation one which is mostly promoted by the EU. As <b>terraced</b> <b>landscapes</b> are still disappearing extremely fast, they need adequate measures for their protection which should be based not only on aids to the agrarian sector but also considering many added values ranging from hydrogeological stability to rainwater management, from wildlife conservation to cultural tourism...|$|R
40|$|Among {{the most}} evident {{landscape}} signatures {{of the human}} fingerprint, the terraces related to agricultural activities are of great importance. This technique is widely used {{in various parts of}} the world under various environmental conditions. In some areas, <b>terraced</b> <b>landscapes</b> can be considered a historical heritage and a cultural ecosystem service to be adequately preserved. However, <b>terraced</b> <b>landscapes</b> subject to abandonment can progressively increase gully erosion and cause terrace failure. Partly because of changes in societal perspective and migration towards metropolitan areas, some countries have been affected by serious and wide abandonment of agricultural lands in recent decades. This review aims to discuss the current state of agricultural <b>terraced</b> <b>landscapes,</b> underlining critical issues and likely solutions. The paper is structured in three main sections. The introduction provides an overview of the available literature on <b>terraced</b> <b>landscapes</b> and their critical issues. The second section presents three case studies: the first is located in the so-called Cinque Terre area (Liguria, Northern Italy), the second is placed in the Chianti Classico area (Tuscany, Central Italy), and the third refers to the renowned Amalfi Coast (Salerno, Southern Italy). The last section of the review relates to likely solutions (non-structural and structural management) and future challenges (use of high-resolution topography derived by lidar) for suitable management of such environments...|$|R

40|$|Terraced {{areas have}} existed in Italy since ancient times, and they {{continue}} to be characteristic elements of the cultural identity of the country. The progressive abandonment of rural areas and farmland that began in the 1960 s has led to the disintegration and disappearance of many terraces, representing one of the problems connected with the deterioration of the historic Tuscan agricultural landscape. This research aims to provide a contribution to the territorial analysis of the agricultural <b>terraced</b> <b>landscapes</b> at a regional scale. The preliminary phase of the study involved setting up a working method in Geographic Information System (GIS) for the quantitative definition of the population. Afterwards, for the territorial analysis at a more detailed scale, a method was devised to identify the areas of greater significance in terms of a terracing intensity index. The final results concerned considerations on the distribution of the <b>terraced</b> <b>landscapes</b> and analyses related to land use and the main environmental parameters of the most representative terraced systems...|$|R

40|$|Objectives <b>Terraced</b> <b>landscapes</b> are {{the most}} {{distinctive}} sign of human influence on territory modelling and a peculiar feature of cultural heritage worldwide. Indeed their construction has been essential to make mountain or steep slope areas habitable and arable, reducing the slope gradient and increasing soil permeability. Recently, they are barely sights and commonly abandoned due to their inadequate and insufficient competitiveness. This trend is causing serious problems of hydrogeological instability and, therefore, both European and Italian agricultural and environmental policy is focusing on {{the promotion of the}} protection of these areas. In particular, <b>terraced</b> <b>landscapes</b> wrap Amalfi Coast becoming a typical shape and enhancing its beauty. Moreover, they are a proof of the past and, for this reason, they are involved in UNESCO World Heritage List. In view of the above, the safeguard of this place {{and the development of a}} management and maintenance plan of these areas should be a priority. Understanding their evolution over the years is a prerequisite to implement a rescue plan suitable to the study area. Hence, the volumetric and geo-morphology changes of <b>terraced</b> <b>landscapes</b> in Amalfi Coast have been performed by analysing different photogrammetric Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), obtained by historical series of aerial photos. Methods The assessment of volumetric and geomorphologic changes have been implemented in Amalfi Coast, a stretch of coastline on the southern coast of Salerno Province in Southern Italy. To achieve this purpose, some historical series of aerial photos related to the area of interest over a fifty-year period have been taken into account and processed using Agisoft Photoscan Professional in order to generate a fine photogrammetric DEM for each year considered. Subsequently, the volumetric changes (m 3) between the different DEMs have been evaluated by multiplying their horizontal grid resolution (m 2) with their slope differences. Instead, also the slope degree differences have been analyzed. Eventually, the influence of terraces on the surface flow path have been estimated by the Relative Path Impact Index (RPII), computed on a smoothed DEM, purified of roads, trails and terraces. These indices have been computed using ArcGis. Results This research shows that the photogrammetric technique is a promising method to analyze the volumetric and geomorphological changes of <b>terraced</b> <b>landscapes</b> in Amalfi Coast. In particular, it allows to compare DEMs of different years and to quantify study area changes, which are significant because of the abandonment of this place and their insufficient maintenance...|$|R

50|$|The {{district}} is entirely {{covered by the}} Deccan trap flows of the tertiary period. The Deccan trap is composed of horizontal flows of basaltic lava. They generally form flat-topped hillocks and terrace-like features. The physical characteristics of individual flows show considerable variations. Some flows are hard and massive while others are weathered, soft and friable. This character has resulted in <b>terraced</b> <b>landscape,</b> suddenly ending in escarpments. The traps are seen generally 618 m above mean sea level. These are jointed and show the characteristics of spherical weathering leaving massive hard cores. Columnar jointing is predominantly developed in these rocks, besides horizontal joints, which impart to the rocks bedded appearance. The top layers of the Deccan trap in parts of Bidar and Humnabad talukas are altered to reddish vesicular laterite, forming and extensive undulating plateau.|$|E
40|$|Abstract This work {{presents}} {{the potential for}} high-resolution remote sensing data (LiDAR digital terrain models) to determine the spatial heterogeneity of <b>terraced</b> <b>landscapes.</b> The study objective is achieved through the identification of a new parameter that distinguishes this unique landscape form from more natural land formations. The morphological indicator proposed is called the Slope Local Length of Auto-Correlation (SLLAC), and it {{is derived from the}} local analysis of slope self-similarity. The {SLACC} is obtained over two steps: (i) calculating the correlation between a slope patch and a defined surrounding area and (ii) identifying the characteristic length of correlation for each neighbourhood. The {SLLAC} map texture can be measured using a surface metrology metric called the second derivative of peaks, or Spc. For the present study, we tested the algorithm for two types of landscapes: a Mediterranean and an Alpine one. The research method involved an examination of both real LiDAR {DTMs} and simulated ones, in which it was possible to control terrace shapes and the percentage of area covered by terraces. The results indicate that {SLLAC} maps exhibit a random aspect for natural surfaces. In contrast, <b>terraced</b> <b>landscapes</b> demonstrate a higher degree of order, and this behaviour is independent of the morphological context and terracing system. The outcomes of this work also prove that Spc values decrease as the area of terraced surfaces increases within the investigated region: the Spc for terraced areas is significantly different from the Spc of a natural landscape. In areas of smooth natural morphology, the Spc identifies terraced areas with a 20...|$|R
