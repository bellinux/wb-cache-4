5|$|Ships {{and other}} water craft were advised {{to avoid the}} Cape Cod area as the storm was {{forecast}} to brush that area, which was put under a hurricane warning by the National Hurricane Center. In Massachusetts, schools were closed and emergency shelters were opened to accommodate evacuees. Evacuations were ordered for residents living in low-lying areas in Cape Cod. In Boston, {{the threat of the}} storm caused both elementary and middle schools <b>to</b> <b>close</b> <b>at</b> noon while high schools were closed at 1 p.m. (est). The approach of the storm also postponed a fair at a local hospital and planes at Otis Air Force Base were quickly moved to their hangars. Much of southeastern Massachusetts civil defense and fire departments were alerted in preparation of the storm's impact. In Rhode Island, schools and other buildings were used as shelter to house evacuees. As Hurricane Gerda sped up the East Coast of the United States, the National Hurricane Center extended the hurricane warnings from Block Island, Rhode Island to Eastport, Maine. At Naval Station Newport in Newport, Rhode Island, two ships of the United States Navy left their berths to ride out the storm. One of which was the Comsixthflt flagship USS Puget Sound (AD-38).|$|E

(A fourth government columbarium at Mount Vernon is due <b>to</b> <b>close</b> <b>at</b> an unspecified date due to redevelopment of its surrounding area {{into a public}} housing estate.) Private columbaria are operated by the Kong Meng San Phor Kark See Monastery, the Roman Catholic Church of Saint Mary of the Angels in Bukit Batok, and the Singapore Soka Association, among others. As with crematoria, {{there is a significant}} price difference between niches in private and government columbaria. A standard niche in any government columbarium costs less than $900, but one at the Kong Meng San monastery costs more than $15,000. The government columbaria allocate niches sequentially, and charge an extra $250 for any location change request; for an extra price, the private columbaria allow families to choose niche locations subject to availability, and even to pre-book niches before death.|$|E

25|$|A {{swaging machine}} works by using two or four split dies which {{separate}} and close up to 2000 times a minute. This action {{is achieved by}} mounting the dies into the machine's spindle which is rotated by a motor. The spindle is mounted inside a cage containing rollers (looks like a roller bearing). The rollers are larger than the cage so as the spindle spins the dies are pushed out to ride on the cage by centrifugal force, as the dies cross over the rollers they push the dies together because of their larger size. On a four-die machine, the number of rollers cause all dies <b>to</b> <b>close</b> <b>at</b> a time; {{if the number of}} rollers do not cause all pairs of dies <b>to</b> <b>close</b> <b>at</b> the same time then the machine is called a rotary forging machine, even though it is still a swaging process.|$|E
