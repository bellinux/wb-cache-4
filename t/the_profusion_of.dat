5|$|Maribojoc {{had five}} {{intricately}} carved Neo-Gothic retablos {{in the sanctuary}} and transepts. Striking features of the retablo were the presence of arches, crockets, Mudéjar stars and <b>the</b> <b>profusion</b> <b>of</b> carving. The whole retablo was probably completed in January 7, 1934 as a project of the Comité de Obras during the term of Father Quiterio Sarigumba (P.Q.S.) as seen on the inscription in {{the upper reaches of}} the central retablo. An older retablo, built from 1616 to 1692, predated the church.|$|E
5|$|A {{distinct}} feature {{noted in}} the entire temple complex is the stucco style embellishments built with brick masonry and finished with plaster. The motifs crafted are of floral (lotuses) and geometric designs, on the walls, in the niches and on arches. Apart from paintings on the walls, the niches in the interior parts of the shrines have 300 well crafted images of deities. <b>The</b> <b>profusion</b> <b>of</b> paintings and images on {{the internal and external}} faces of the temple was considered an auspicious feature, instead of leaving the wall surfaces blank. However, the images and murals on the outer walls of the temple have since been demolished.|$|E

5|$|Athens' local country {{scene has}} never been as {{significant}} as <b>the</b> <b>profusion</b> <b>of</b> indie rock bands; however, modern Athens rock takes many elements from the folk, bluegrass and country traditions, including such bands as the Normaltown Flyers. The band Drive-By Truckers, and the , have done much {{in recent years to}} make country rock a major part of Athens' musical identity. Recent bands such as The Broken String Band have emerged influenced by the folk rock genre. The rapper Bubba Sparxxx, originally from South Georgia, has also helped diversify Athens' country heritage, by adding a rural image and elements of country music to his Dirty South style of hip hop music.|$|E
5|$|Both teams' quarterbacks {{benefited from}} <b>the</b> <b>profusion</b> <b>of</b> passing. Virginia Tech quarterback Jim Druckenmiller {{finished}} the game having completed 18 of his 34 pass attempts for 266 yards, one touchdown, and one interception. He also ran three times {{for a total}} gain of one yard. Texas quarterback James Brown completed 14 of his 36 pass attempts for 148 yards, three interceptions, and a touchdown. He rushed six times for -43 yards because sacks are counted as runs for negative yardage. Texas also was hurt by penalty yardage. The Longhorns' nine penalties for 91 yards are both Texas bowl-game records.|$|E
5|$|Hot springs {{are closely}} {{associated}} with fumaroles, which are vents in an active volcanic area releasing steam and hot gases, such as sulfur dioxide. In general, the water is rotating groundwater that comes into contact with rocks heated by magma and finds openings to the surface. The formation of the springs depends both on the rocks the water has passed through and <b>the</b> <b>profusion</b> <b>of</b> volcanic discharges mixed with the groundwater. Iron oxide, iron sulfides and other substances usually colour pools of boiling mud brilliant yellow, red, brown or green. Hot springs comprising significantly softened silica may deposit it to form siliceous sinter, whereas those comprising softened calcium carbonate deposit spongy-looking calcareous rock called tufa. Overflow of the springs can build masses, spires or stepped terraces of calcareous sinter or tufa.|$|E

25|$|Apart {{from the}} exotic wildlife, the Valley of Spiti {{is also known}} for its amazing wealth of flora and <b>the</b> <b>profusion</b> <b>of</b> wild flowers.

25|$|By the Tunisian {{independence}} in 1956, Tunisian Arabic was spoken only in coastal Tunisia {{while the other}} regions spoke Algerian Arabic, Libyan Arabic or several Berber dialects. The profusion is from many factors including {{the length of time}} the country was inhabited, its long history as a migration land and <b>the</b> <b>profusion</b> <b>of</b> cultures that have inhabited it, and the geographical length and diversification of the country, divided between mountain, forest, plain, coastal, island and desert areas.|$|E
500|$|Potter {{declared}} the tale her next favorite to The Tailor of Gloucester. The pictures {{are some of}} the most beautiful Potter ever created, especially <b>the</b> <b>profusions</b> <b>of</b> flowers in <b>the</b> doorways and garden plots. [...] The colors in the illustrations are not the muted browns and greens the reader expects in a Potter illustration, nor are they the contrasting colors such as the muted reds and blues Potter uses occasionally to give her illustrations a splash of color. Instead, the colors are bright oranges, violets, and yellows seldom seen in her other books. Even Ribby's lilac dress and Duchess's black mane illustrate Potter's concern for color in this book.|$|R

25|$|Maues first conquered Gandhara and Taxila around 80 BCE, but {{his kingdom}} {{disintegrated}} after his death. In the east, the Indian king Vikrama retook Ujjain from the Indo-Scythians, celebrating his victory by {{the creation of}} the Vikrama era (starting 58 BCE). Indo-Greek kings again ruled after Maues, and prospered, as indicated by <b>the</b> <b>profusion</b> <b>of</b> coins from Kings Apollodotus II and Hippostratos. Not until Azes I, in 55 BC, did the Indo-Scythians take final control of northwestern India, with his victory over Hippostratos.|$|E
25|$|Barranquilla's {{architecture}} {{was built}} almost {{entirely in the}} twentieth century. In the city there are buildings of the colonial period {{in the early decades}} of the independent nation, but <b>the</b> <b>profusion</b> <b>of</b> styles that flourished from the late nineteenth century give the city a cosmopolitan atmosphere. This architectural splendor is testament to the influence of the people arriving in the port for much of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries from North America, Europe, the Middle East and Asia, many of whom settled in Barranquilla and imported architectural styles.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, <b>the</b> <b>profusion</b> <b>of</b> small {{parties and}} their aversion to {{coherent}} alliances left the legislature chaotic. During 1993, Yeltsin's rift with the parliamentary leadership {{led to the}} September–October 1993 constitutional crisis. The crisis climaxed on 3 October, when Yeltsin chose a radical solution to settle his dispute with parliament: he called up tanks to shell the Russian White House, blasting out his opponents. As Yeltsin was taking the unconstitutional step of dissolving the legislature, Russia came close to a serious civil conflict. Yeltsin was then free to impose the current Russian constitution with strong presidential powers, which was approved by referendum in December 1993. The cohesion of the Russian Federation was also threatened when the republic of Chechnya attempted to break away, leading to the First and Second Chechen Wars.|$|E

The sight of those sun-warmed cheeks, and fingers twining round the flower-stalks, her pearly teeth, and hair all fragrant, stole the reason out of Shelton. He stood before her, weak about the knees.|$|R
25|$|In addition, {{the eleven}} SNC members {{had formed a}} {{coalition}} with the SYL, which held 120 of the 123 seats in the National Assembly. A few of these 120 left the SYL after the composition of Egal's cabinet became clear and after the announcement of his program, {{both of which were}} bound to displease some who had joined only to be on the winning side. Offered a huge list of candidates, the almost 900,000 voters in 1969 took delight in defeating incumbents. Of the incumbent deputies, 77 out of 123 were not returned (including 8 out of 18 members of the previous cabinet), but these figures did not unequivocally demonstrate dissatisfaction with the government. Statistically, they were nearly identical with the results of the 1964 election, and, given <b>the</b> <b>profusion</b> <b>of</b> parties and the system of proportional representation, a clear sense of public opinion could not be obtained {{solely on the basis of}} the election results. The fact that a single party—the SYL—dominated the field implied neither stability nor solidarity. Anthropologist Ioan M. Lewis has noted that the SYL government was a very heterogeneous group with diverging personal and lineage interests.|$|E
500|$|Boston is {{sometimes}} called a [...] "city of neighborhoods" [...] because of <b>the</b> <b>profusion</b> <b>of</b> diverse subsections; the city government's Office of Neighborhood Services has officially designated 23 neighborhoods. More than two-thirds of inner Boston's modern land area did not exist when the city was founded, but was created via the gradual filling in of the surrounding tidal areas over the centuries, notably with earth from leveling or lowering Boston's three original hills (the [...] "Trimountain", after which Tremont Street is named) and with gravel brought by train from Needham to fill the Back Bay.|$|E
500|$|Part of {{what makes}} Paine's style so memorable is his {{effective}} use of repetition and rhetorical questions in addition to <b>the</b> <b>profusion</b> <b>of</b> [...] "anecdote, irony, parody, satire, feigned confusion, folk matter, concrete vocabulary, and [...] [...] [...] appeals to common sense". Paine's conversational style draws the reader into the text. His use of [...] "we" [...] conveys an [...] "illusion {{that he and the}} readers share the activity of constructing an argument". By thus emphasizing the presence of the reader and leaving images and arguments half-formed, Paine encourages his readers to complete them independently.|$|E
5000|$|As Franco {{no longer}} needed the brigade for {{political}} reasons, he never sent a second ship for the next 600 volunteers who had assembled in Galway in January 1937. The brigaders in Spain had a problem coping with oily food and <b>the</b> unaccustomed <b>profusion</b> <b>of</b> good wine. In April 1937 O'Duffy's adjutant Captain Gunning made off with the wages {{and a number of}} passports. O'Duffy's men started to nickname him [...] "O'Scruffy" [...] and [...] "Old John Bollocks".|$|R
60|$|But {{this is an}} {{observation}} only, though I believe it is very just; I am bringing it in here only as an example <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dreadful <b>profusion</b> <b>of</b> this age, and how an extravagant way of expensive living, perfectly negligent of all degrees of frugality or good husbandry, is the reigning vice of the people. I could enlarge upon it, and very much to the purpose here, but I shall have occasion to speak of it again.|$|R
5000|$|This book first arose out of {{a passage}} in Borges, out of the {{laughter}} that shattered, as I read the passage, all the familiar landmarks of thought—our thought, the thought that bears the stamp of our age and our geography—breaking up all the ordered surfaces and all the planes with which we are accustomed to tame <b>the</b> wild <b>profusion</b> <b>of</b> existing things and continuing long afterwards to disturb and threaten with collapse our age-old definitions between the Same and the Other.|$|R
500|$|Another {{significant}} {{feature of}} St Kildan {{life was the}} diet. The islanders kept sheep and a few cattle {{and were able to}} grow a limited amount of food crops such as barley and potatoes on the better-drained land in Village Bay; in many ways the islands {{can be seen as a}} large mixed farm. Samuel Johnson reported that in the 18th century sheep's milk was made [...] "into small cheeses" [...] by the St Kildans. They generally eschewed fishing because of the heavy seas and unpredictable weather. The mainstay of their food supplies was <b>the</b> <b>profusion</b> <b>of</b> island birds, especially gannet and fulmar. These they harvested as eggs and young birds and ate both fresh and cured. Adult puffins were also caught by the use of fowling rods. A 1764 census described a daily consumption for each of the 90 inhabitants at the same of [...] "36 wild fouls eggs and 18 fouls" [...] (i.e. seabirds).|$|E
500|$|Contrary to the {{positive}} reviews, Anjum N., writing for Rediff, said that despite an extraordinary cast and a big budget, [...] "Karan Johar disappoints." [...] He praised Amitabh and Jaya Bachchan's performance and noted Hrithik Roshan for holding his own against the veteran actors. However, in summary he called the film [...] "a bad remix of Mohabbatein and Kuch Kuch Hota Hai". Writing for The Hindu, Ziya Salam praised Kajol's performance and Karan's ability to [...] "keep the viewer occupied". She commented, [...] "Watch Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... {{not because of the}} hype which preceded its release but because in these meagre times not many have come up with better fare. The film at least partially redeems the hope surrounding it. Again, just like its name. Some joy, some disappointment." [...] Namarata Joshi of Outlook gave a mixed review and said that while the film [...] "makes you laugh and cry alternately", the shenanigans were nevertheless [...] "fake and affected" [...] and [...] "monochromatic despite <b>the</b> <b>profusion</b> <b>of</b> colours".|$|E
500|$|Uncle David {{was filmed}} over {{five days in}} October 2009 on the Isle of Sheppey, a {{location}} chosen for its proximity to London. Hoyle commented that <b>the</b> <b>profusion</b> <b>of</b> barbed wire fences there made him wonder if they were [...] "keeping people out or keeping people in?". Reich {{said that he had}} been [...] "obsessed" [...] with Sheppey, a place he had considered [...] "a truly Godforsaken wasteland" [...] since working on a television show there ten years previously. He remarked that the [...] "trailer trash setting" [...] of the film was influenced by Harmony Korine's Gummo (1997) and John Waters' Female Trouble (1974). He also said that the filming budget of under £1000 was a homage to [...] "the spirit of John Waters." [...] All the extras featured in the film were real inhabitants of Sheppey, and to film a scene in a local cafe, they walked in and asked the proprietors if they could shoot there. Although they had planned to tell any enquirers who approached them that they were shooting a horror film, during the shoot none of the locals expressed any interest in the crew's activities.|$|E
50|$|Profusion: Using the Standard X-rays, <b>the</b> <b>profusion</b> (concentration) <b>of</b> small opacities is {{classified}} on a 4-point major category scale (0, 1, 2, or 3), with each major category divided into three, giving 12 ordered subcategories of increasing profusion: 0/-, 0/0, 0/1, 1/0, 1/1, 1/2, 2/1, 2/2, 2/3, 3/2, 3/3, and 3/+. Category 0 {{refers to the}} absence of small opacity and category 3 represents the most profuse.

50|$|After the Catholic Monarchs had {{completed}} the Reconquista in 1492 and started the colonization of the Americas, imperial Spain began to develop a consciousness of its growing power and wealth, and in its exuberance launched a period of construction of grand monuments to symbolize them. Many of these monuments were built at the command of the Queen; thus Isabelline Gothic manifested {{the desire of the}} Spanish ruling classes to display their own power and wealth. This exuberance found a parallel expression in <b>the</b> extreme <b>profusion</b> <b>of</b> decoration which has been called Plateresque.|$|R
