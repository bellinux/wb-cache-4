5|$|The real minimum memory {{requirements}} {{depend on}} the architecture and may be {{much less than the}} numbers listed in this table. It is possible to install Debian with 60MB of RAM for x86-64; the installer will run in low memory mode and it is recommended to create a swap partition. The installer for z/Architecture requires about 20MB of RAM, but relies on network hardware. Similarly, disk space requirements, which depend on <b>the</b> <b>packages</b> to be installed, can be reduced by manually selecting <b>the</b> <b>packages</b> needed. , no Pure Blend exists that would lower the hardware requirements easily.|$|E

50|$|Dimensional {{weight is}} a {{calculation}} of a theoretical {{weight of a}} package. This theoretical weight is the weight of <b>the</b> <b>package</b> at a minimum density chosen by the freight carrier. If <b>the</b> <b>package</b> is below this minimum density, then the actual weight is irrelevant as the freight carrier will charge for the volume of <b>the</b> <b>package</b> {{as if it were}} of the chosen density (what <b>the</b> <b>package</b> would weigh at the minimum density). Furthermore, the volume used to calculate the dimensional weight may not be absolutely representative of the true volume of <b>the</b> <b>package.</b> <b>The</b> freight carrier will measure the longest dimension {{in each of the three}} axis (X, Y, Z) and use these measurements to determine <b>the</b> <b>package</b> volume. If <b>the</b> <b>package</b> is a right-angled rectangular box (cuboid), then this will be equal to the true volume of <b>the</b> <b>package.</b> However, if <b>the</b> <b>package</b> is of any other shape, then the calculation of volume will be more than the true volume of <b>the</b> <b>package.</b>|$|R

5|$|Brady and Hindley {{visited a}} {{fairground}} on 26 December 1964, {{in search of}} another victim, and noticed 10-year-old Lesley Ann Downey standing beside one of the rides. When {{it became apparent that}} she was on her own, they approached her and deliberately dropped some of the shopping they were carrying close to her, before asking for the girl's help to carry some of <b>the</b> <b>packages</b> to their car, and then to their home. Once inside the house Downey was undressed, gagged and forced to pose for photographs before being raped and killed, perhaps strangled with a piece of string. Hindley maintained that she went to fill a bath for the child and found the girl dead (presumably killed by Brady) when she returned. In Chris Cowley's book Face to Face with Evil: Conversations with Ian Brady, Brady states that it was Hindley who killed Downey. The following morning Brady and Hindley drove with Downey's body to Saddleworth Moor, where she was buried, naked with her clothes at her feet, in a shallow grave.|$|E

25|$|Visual Studio 2008 {{introduced}} the Visual Studio Shell {{that allows for}} development of a customized version of the IDE.

The Isolated mode of the shell creates a new AppId where <b>the</b> <b>packages</b> are installed. These are to be started with a different executable.

50|$|Software {{packages}} are built {{by means of}} a specification file, a set of install scripts, and the actual software content. The install scripts are executed during software installation, verification, and removal, and can be used to prepare a system for the software and to perform activation or deactivation of <b>the</b> <b>package.</b> <b>The</b> specification file determines how <b>the</b> software <b>package</b> will be organized, list the locations of the various files to be loaded into <b>the</b> <b>package,</b> restrict <b>the</b> systems on which <b>the</b> <b>package</b> can be installed, and determine the security configuration of <b>the</b> <b>package.</b> It also provides various information about <b>the</b> <b>package,</b> such as a name, version, and description.|$|R

40|$|Growing {{pressure}} on <b>the</b> <b>packaging</b> design {{to enhance the}} environmental and logistics performance of a <b>packaging</b> system stresses <b>the</b> <b>packaging</b> designers to search new design strategies that not only fulfill logistics requirements in the supply chain, but also reduce the CO 2 emissions during <b>the</b> <b>packaging</b> life cycle. This thesis focuses on <b>the</b> <b>packaging</b> design process and suggests some improvements by considering its logistics performance and CO 2 emissions. A Green packaging development model was proposed for corrugated box design to explore the inter-dependencies that exist among compressive strength, waste and CO 2 emissions. The verification of the proposed model unveils the significance of a holistic view of <b>the</b> <b>packaging</b> system in <b>the</b> <b>packaging</b> design process and reveals <b>the</b> importance of <b>packaging</b> design decisions on the logistics performance and CO 2 emissions.

25|$|From 2003 until 2008, the Gentoo Reference Platform (GRP) was a {{snapshot}} of prebuilt packages that users could quickly install during the Gentoo installation process, to give faster access to fully functional Gentoo installation.

Once the installation was complete, <b>the</b> <b>packages</b> installed {{as part of the}} GRP were intended to be replaced by the user with the same or newer versions built though Portage which would be built using the users' system configuration rather than the generic builds provided by the GRP.

25|$|Visual Studio {{does not}} support any {{programming}} language, solution or tool intrinsically; instead, it allows the plugging of functionality coded as a VSPackage. When installed, the functionality is available as a Service. The IDE provides three services: SVsSolution, which provides the ability to enumerate projects and solutions; SVsUIShell, which provides windowing and UI functionality (including tabs, toolbars and tool windows); and SVsShell, which deals with registration of VSPackages. In addition, the IDE is also responsible for coordinating and enabling communication between services. All editors, designers, project types and other tools are implemented as VSPackages. Visual Studio uses COM to access the VSPackages. The Visual Studio SDK also includes the Managed Package Framework (MPF), which {{is a set of}} managed wrappers around the COM-interfaces that allow <b>the</b> <b>Packages</b> to be written in any CLI compliant language. However, MPF does not provide all the functionality exposed by the Visual Studio COM interfaces.|$|E
25|$|The Ireland {{national}} rugby union team plays {{its home}} {{games at the}} stadium, as it did previously at Lansdowne Road, taking over from their temporary home, Croke Park, where games were played during Aviva's construction. Ireland's first international game was on 6 November 2010 against South Africa, with the Springboks winning 23–21. The game drew a crowd of 35,515, mainly due to a backlash by Ireland supporters over the IRFU's controversial ticketing strategy for the November Test series. Initially, the IRFU announced that tickets to the November Tests would only be sold as packages for all four matches. Later, it announced that the tickets would instead be split into two packages, with the South Africa Test bundled with the following week's match with Samoa {{for a minimum of}} €150, and the New Zealand and Argentina Tests bundled for a minimum of €190. Single-game tickets were to be available only for the Samoa and Argentina Tests. On 1 November, the IRFU backed away from this plan amid heavy criticism from member clubs that had problems selling <b>the</b> <b>packages</b> in a difficult economy.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the {{issues relating to}} integrating <b>the</b> <b>packaging</b> supplier as an active participator in the demand chain. The ability to offer and deliver highly systemised packaging solutions in a quick and efficient way has become a competitive differentiator. In some cases, <b>the</b> <b>packaging</b> supplier acts as a non-bias agent and actively participates as a co-ordinator in the supply and demand chain. However, case studies conducted in this field show that generally <b>the</b> <b>packaging</b> supplier has a relatively passive role in the supply chain. The overall problem definition for this research is to study <b>the</b> <b>packaging</b> supplier’s relatively passive role to face {{the demands of the}} supply chain. What will be the synergies if <b>the</b> <b>packaging</b> supplier holds {{an active role in the}} supply and demand chain?
