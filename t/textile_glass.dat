5000|$|... "Fibreglass {{reinforced}} plastics" [...] or FRPs (commonly {{referred to}} simply as fibreglass) use textile grade glass fibres. These textile fibres {{are different from}} other forms of glass fibres used to deliberately trap air, for insulating applications (see glass wool). <b>Textile</b> <b>glass</b> fibres begin as varying combinations of SiO2, Al2O3, B2O3, CaO, or MgO in powder form. These mixtures are then heated through direct melting to temperatures around 1300 degrees Celsius, after which dies are used to extrude filaments of glass fibre in diameter ranging from 9 to 17 µm. These filaments are then wound into larger threads and spun onto bobbins for transportation and further processing. Glass fibre {{is by far the}} most popular means to reinforce plastic and thus enjoys a wealth of production processes, some of which are applicable to aramid and carbon fibres as well owing to their shared fibrous qualities.|$|E

The {{thermal expansion coefficient}} of the polymer is approximately 450 times {{higher than that of}} silver. To prepare the solar cell structure the following deposition steps (active material and top electrode) require temperatures of maximum 170. Therefore, the main challenge was to avoid a cracking inside the silver layers since otherwise the functionality of the whole device will be destroyed by shunting due to shortcuts. By combining different low-temperature sintering techniques and therefore developing a special sintering routine, it was possible to produce smooth silver layers which are highly resistant against tensile and compressive stress and therefore can withstand the temperature cycling of the following deposition steps without cracking...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{deposition}} of hydrophobic fluorocarbon coatings from C 2 F 6 and C 2 F 6 -H 2 rf discharges on different substrates was examined. Polyester <b>textile,</b> <b>glass</b> and two different ceramic compounds {{were used as}} substrates. The effect of the total gas pressure, the rf power dissipation and the deposition time on the hydrophobic character of the samples was investigated. Films deposited on polyester textiles at low pressure (0. 03 mbar) and power consumption (16 mW/cm 2) using pure C 2 F 6 presented the highest water contact angles (~ 150 o).

40|$|AbstractUsing textile {{composites}} {{with straight}} fibre orientation in-plane, improved lightweight structures {{can be designed}} and produced, where the fibres are specifically positioned {{in line with the}} flux of force induced by external loads. Here, the structural properties are dominated by the material properties of the 0 °-fibres under static as well as under fatigue loading. It is well known, the failure behaviour in fibre direction is affected by textile loop threads and adjacent plies, for example by notch effects of inter fibre cracks. For the experimental characterisation of the influence of 3 D-loop threads as well as adjacent plies on the fatigue performance, the degradation behaviour of unidirectional and <b>textile</b> <b>glass</b> fibre reinforced polypropylene in tension-tension fatigue loading has been analysed. The material configurations have selectively been chosen to achieve identical fibre volume fraction of the reinforcement fibres in loading direction and therefore gain a high comparability in fatigue loading. The driving damage mechanisms are observed using imaging methods, such as light microscopy and computer tomography. The achieved experimental results will be incorporated into the failure mode dependent fatigue analysis models already been published by the authors...|$|E
40|$|The {{method of}} making glass fibres {{by means of}} a bushing was first {{demonstrated}} in 1908 by W. von Paczinsky in Hamburg, although a British silk weaver made a glass fabric in 1842, and another inventor, Edward Libbey, exhibited a dress woven of glass at the 1893 Columbian Exposition in Chicago. The manufacture of <b>textile</b> <b>glass</b> fibres using the technique of drawing the fibres through very fine orifices was developed in the 1930 s in the USA and started in Germany in 1939. A useful summary of the manufacture and use of glass fibres is given in [1]. Further details are to be found for example in [2 and 3]. The earliest bushings used for industrial fibre production had 51 individual nozzles or “tips”. As production processes became more stable, this was increased to 102 and then 204 tips. In these early bushings, the tips were arranged in one or more long rows. Current bushings have up to 4000 tips and there is a trend to even larger numbers. In the most commonly used designs, the tips are arranged in double rows at right angles to the longitudinal axis of the bushing.

The laminates were manufactured by compression molding two different fabrics produced by weaving and warp knitting commingled GF/PET yarns. The initiation fracture toughness of the woven laminates in pure Mode I and Mode II were {{slightly higher than}} those of the warp knitted laminates. For the mixed modes, the difference between the fracture toughness of the two materials was smaller. An extensive scanning electron microscopy (SEM) investigation of the fracture was conducted to identify any characteristic failure mechanisms. The main fractographic features of the Mode I dominated failures were a brittle matrix failure and large amounts of fiber pull-out. As the Mode II loading component increased, the amount of fiber pull-out was reduced and the matrix had a more sheared appearance. A relatively large amount of cusps were found in pure Mode II and mixed mode I:II = 1 : 4; such features are seldom seen in thermoplastic matrix composites. A general mixed mode failure criterion, which accounts for the appearance of the fracture surface, was evaluated and was seen to give a good fit to the experimental fracture toughness values...|$|E

In these glasses, which are isolation type, the P 205 contents scatter between 0 and 2 wt % and Al 203 from 0. 12 to 3. 4 wt%. Both static (30 -mg fibers; 250 -ml solution) and dynamic (50 -mg fibers; 40 ml/day flow rate) conditions with or without bubbling of a gas mixture (95 : 5, N 2 -CO 2) have been used. Two physiological solutions, one proposed by Kanapilly and the other by Scholtze, were used. After each run (1, 3, 7, 14, and sometimes 30, 62 days) the solutions were analyzed for B and Si by inductively coupled plasma (ICP), the weight losses were determined, and the residual solid were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Static runs give a better agreement between measured and calculated weight losses from solution analyses than dynamic experiments. SEM examinations indicate diameter reduction and formation of a hydrated Si-rich layer. Sometimes hollow tubes, suggesting the detachment of these layers, are observed. XPS and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis indicate {{the formation of a}} veneer of calcium phosphate for the most rapidly dissolving glass. In other cases an Al increase is observed at the solid solution interface. Whatever experimental conditions are used, the relative dissolution rates of the four glasses are identical. The kinetics may be modeled with variable dissolution rates from initial high values to final low ones. The latter reflect the very low solubility of the residual product. - Environ Healt...|$|E
