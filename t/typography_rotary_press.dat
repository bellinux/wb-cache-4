5000|$|Besides the {{automatic}} cylinder press, the 19th century saw another innovation in printing press construction and a newspaper publisher was behind this as well. Around 1850 {{the question was}} being asked whether the <b>rotary</b> <b>press</b> principle was suitable for letterpress printing. John Walter III, publisher of [...] "The Times" [...] in London, commissioned the two engineers J.C. MacDonald and John Calverly to develop and build the world's first <b>rotary</b> <b>press</b> for newspaper printing. This {{became known as the}} “Walter press”. In June 1872, Maschinenfabrik Augsburg sent its development head Gustav Bissinger to England. Fact-finding visits by German engineers to factories and workshops in England, the leading industrial nation of that era, were not uncommon in those days. After that the first <b>rotary</b> <b>press</b> from Maschinenfabrik Augsburg was quickly designed. Although it also worked on the Walter principle, it was smaller and lighter and easier to operate. In May 1873 it was presented at the World Fair in Vienna.|$|R

40|$|The {{cause of}} {{register}} errors that develops in a rotogravure printing press under particular conditions of printing speed has been analysed. The print defect in magazines causes waste printed paper and prevents from fully exploiting the productive {{capacity of the}} <b>rotary</b> <b>press.</b> It has been observed that the defect is {{not consistent with the}} natural vibrations of the rotating bodies in contact with the paper during the printing process. A new approach based on the analysis of the register markers printed on the pages of a magazine, has allowed to show a probable oscillatory phenomenon of the entire <b>rotary</b> <b>press</b> structure, not easy otherwise detectable. This new method consists on the reconstruction and interpretation of the curve corresponding to a series of register markers printed along a line of a paper sheet. It has been so possible to determine that the cause of the print defect is due to the oscillations at low frequency of the <b>rotary</b> <b>press</b> structure. A simplified model of the deformations of the tightened paper web confirms the results...|$|R

50|$|Bullock {{moved to}} Pittsburgh, {{and in a}} couple of years, perfected a {{printing}} press called the web <b>rotary</b> <b>press.</b> Richard March Hoe had invented the <b>rotary</b> <b>press</b> in 1843, but Bullock's press was an improvement over Hoe's design. Bullock's press allowed for continuous large rolls of paper to be automatically fed through the rollers, eliminating the laborious hand-feeding system of earlier presses. The press was self-adjusting, printed on both sides, folded the paper, and a sharp serrated knife that rarely needed sharpening cut sheets with rapid precision. The press could print up to 12,000 sheets an hour; later improvements raised the speed to up to 30,000 sheets an hour.|$|R
50|$|Flong is a {{term used}} in relief {{printing}} (also called a stereo mould), which refers to an intermediate step in making of a stereo plate typically used in a <b>rotary</b> <b>press</b> though not exclusively. The process was called stereotyping.|$|R
50|$|Several {{extremely}} rare stamps {{from this period}} sometimes misidentified as coil waste were actually produced from the waste printing of sheet stamps. These include another 1¢ Franklin issue (Scott #596) and the perforated 11 <b>rotary</b> <b>press</b> Harding Memorial stamp (Scott #613).|$|R
5000|$|Die cutting {{can be done}} {{on either}} flatbed or <b>rotary</b> <b>presses.</b> <b>Rotary</b> die cutting is often done inline with printing. The primary {{difference}} between rotary die cutting and flatbed die cutting is that the flatbed is not as fast but the tools are cheaper. This process lends itself to smaller production runs where {{it is not as}} easy to absorb the added cost of a rotary die.|$|R
5000|$|In the mid-1920s, <b>rotary</b> <b>presses</b> {{came into}} use for {{printing}} stamps which used long rolls of paper rather than individual sheets, and this made the paste-up phase unnecessary, as sheets of any length could {{be produced by}} the press and merely needed to be cut into strips.|$|R
50|$|Coil {{waste is}} a type of U.S. stamp made from damaged or {{unusable}} printing stock intended for use as coil stamps and is a term applied to several stamp issues of the late 1910s and early 20s. Sometimes in the printing of coils on <b>rotary</b> <b>presses,</b> a number stamps from the run were deemed unusable for coil production. Instead of discarding these, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing processed them through the flat-plate perforating machine to finish them as fully perforated stamps. These finished products are known as coil waste. While seemingly identical to normal fully perforated issues (which were printed on flat plate presses), coil waste stamps are distinguishable by their size: their designs are slightly wider or longer than normal because <b>rotary</b> <b>press</b> printing slightly stretches an image.|$|R
50|$|At {{the same}} time, Richard Hoe of New York was {{developing}} {{a more efficient}} horizontal <b>rotary</b> <b>press</b> which as available with two, four, six or ten impression cylinders. The first one of this type was imported by Edward Lloyd in 1856 and was soon adopted by many newspapers including The Times.|$|R
50|$|Spray powder is {{not used}} on <b>rotary</b> <b>presses</b> {{including}} <b>rotary</b> letterpress, web offset (often used for printing magazines), flexographic (often used for printing flexible packaging and labels) or gravure (often used for printing long-run catalogues). Similarly, spray powder is not generally used in sheet-fed (silk) screen-printing, ink-jet or toner based digital printing.|$|R
50|$|In 1903, the {{linotype}} and {{a technique}} called stereotyping, a process for molding semi-circular printing plates for the new <b>rotary</b> <b>press,</b> were introduced. Before the newspaper got its first linotype machine - it would add two more in 1913 and, eventually own 13 before they were replaced by computer-generated typesetting in the 1970s - all type was hand set.|$|R
50|$|The Dispatch {{bounced back}} from the fire and {{operated}} in a temporary headquarters until its office was rebuilt in 1947. Ten years later, the company {{moved to a new}} plant and its current location at 304 South Chestnut Street in Henderson. It printed its first edition on a new 32-page <b>rotary</b> <b>press</b> on Monday, Dec. 2, 1957.|$|R
50|$|Lloyd {{then turned}} his {{attention}} to the efficiency of his production processes. In 1856, he imported two <b>rotary</b> <b>presses</b> made by Richard Hoe in New York that multiplied the speed of printing and were soon imported by the rest of Fleet Street. Then, exasperated by the unreliability of newsprint supplies, he decided to make his own.|$|R
50|$|Stamp {{printing}} was {{switching from}} a flat plate <b>press</b> to a <b>rotary</b> <b>press</b> while these stamps were in use, and most {{come in two}} perforations as a result; 11 for flat plate, and 11x10.5 for rotary. In 1929, theft problems in the Midwest led to the s on the regular stamps. (See also: Fourth Bureau issue).|$|R
50|$|He {{was one of}} {{the founders}} and proprietors of the Philadelphia Public Ledger in 1836 (along with Arunah Shepherdson Abell and Azariah H. Simmons) and also served as editor. The paper was the first daily to {{establish}} a pony express, {{and one of the first}} to use the telegraph. In 1847, it was printed on the first <b>rotary</b> <b>press</b> ever built.|$|R
50|$|The {{newspaper}} {{benefited from}} {{the introduction of the}} telegraph and the <b>rotary</b> <b>press.</b> The latter device, invented in the US, was first used in Canada by George Brown in Toronto starting in 1844 to print copies of the Globe. This process permitted the printing of thousands of copies of each daily paper rather than the mere hundreds of copies possible with previous technologies.|$|R
50|$|When Lloyd’s Weekly’s {{circulation}} was soaring in the 1850s, greater {{speed was}} urgently needed. Lloyd {{heard of the}} <b>rotary</b> <b>press</b> developed by Richard Hoe in New York that would multiply the speed of his existing presses. He went to Paris immediately to inspect the only specimen in Europe. He ordered one to be delivered to London without delay, and then a second.|$|R
