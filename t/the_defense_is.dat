5|$|The role of <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>is</b> {{to prevent}} the offense from scoring by {{tackling}} the ball carrier or by forcing turnovers (interceptions or fumbles).|$|E
5|$|Despite its drawbacks, {{there are}} several {{advantages}} to using the fair catch kick. Because <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>is</b> required to be ten yards beyond the spot of the kick, the kicker can take a running start before kicking {{as opposed to the}} typical two steps taken on regular field goal attempts. Similarly, the kicker does {{not have to worry about}} a low snap because the ball is not snapped. <b>The</b> <b>defense</b> <b>is</b> not able to block the kick, allowing the kicker to give the ball a lower trajectory than usual. The fair catch kick would also be of a shorter distance than a normal field goal attempt from the same spot, because the fair catch kick is taken from the spot of the catch, while a typical field goal is taken seven yards back from the line of scrimmage.|$|E
5|$|It is {{acceptable}} to defend from a violent attack anywhere on the street especially {{when a person is}} attacked with a knife or another deadly weapon. Shooting an unarmed attacker also occurs and becomes sometimes a subject of controversy. In general, each case is investigated in great detail before being eventually dismissed as a legitimate self-defense. <b>The</b> <b>defense</b> <b>is</b> judged according to the subjective and objective perception of the defender {{during the time of the}} imminent or ongoing attack, and not according to the view of persons who are judging it ex post.|$|E

50|$|In 1977, coach Ralston {{stepped down}} and Red Miller {{was brought in}} to guide an already talented team to their first ever playoff berth. <b>The</b> <b>defense</b> <b>was</b> already showing signs of dominance. By Week 7 of the 1977 season, the Broncos <b>were</b> 6-0 and <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>was</b> well known as “The Orange Crush Defense”, giving up a total of 46 points during those games.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>defense</b> <b>was</b> again led by Derrick Thomas, and he {{was joined}} by Neil Smith on the Pro Bowl team.|$|R
5|$|Although {{there is}} no stand-your-ground law, the fact that {{necessary}} defense (unlike utmost necessity) {{is not subject to}} subsidiarity means that there is also no duty to retreat. The mere fact that a defender uses a weapon against unarmed attacker does not mean that <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>is</b> disproportionate (and thus not legitimate) to the manner of the attack and the proportionality of defense does not depend on the relative effectiveness of the defender's weapon compared to the intensity of the attack, but on {{the manner in which the}} weapon is used (aiming at leg, i.e. intended non-deadly defense, may be proportionate where aiming at chest may be manifestly disproportionate, notwithstanding if the slug hits a leg artery and the attacker bleeds to death).|$|E
5|$|Safeties are {{the least}} common method of scoring in American {{football}} but are not rare occurrences– since 1932, a safety has occurred once every 14.31 games in the National Football League (NFL), or {{about once a week}} under current scheduling rules. On October 21, 1973, Fred Dryer, playing for the Los Angeles Rams against the Green Bay Packers, became the only player in NFL History to score two safeties in a single game. A much rarer occurrence is the one-point safety, which can be scored by the offense on an extra point or two-point conversion attempt; those have occurred at least twice in NCAA Division I football since 1996, most recently at the 2013 Fiesta Bowl. No conversion safeties have occurred since at least 1940 in the NFL. A conversion safety by <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>is</b> also possible, though highly unlikely; although this has never occurred, it is the only possible way a team could finish with a single point in an American football game.|$|E
25|$|The {{battered}} person {{defense is}} a defense used {{in court that}} the person accused of an assault/murder was suffering from battered person syndrome at the material time. Because <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>is</b> most commonly used by women, it is usually characterised in court as battered woman syndrome or battered wife syndrome.|$|E
50|$|As a result, <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>was</b> {{formally}} abolished {{by statute}} in many jurisdictions when they {{converted to a}} no-fault divorce regime.|$|R
5000|$|F. Lee Bailey joined <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> team before <b>the</b> {{preliminary}} hearing and handled many of <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> team’s press conferences. Bailey’s most notable contribution to <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>was</b> his cross-examination of LAPD investigator Mark Fuhrman.|$|R
50|$|The Jets' offense scored 281 points, ranking them 30th in the league, while <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>was</b> ranked 8th {{best in the}} league.|$|R
25|$|Responses to {{the problem}} of evil have {{sometimes}} been classified as defenses or theodicies. However, authors disagree on the exact definitions. Generally, a defense attempts to show that there is no logical incompatibility between the existence of evil and the existence of God. A defense need not argue that this is a probable or plausible explanation, only that <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>is</b> logically possible. A defense attempts to answer the logical problem of evil.|$|E
25|$|The Jencks Act {{provides}} that no material shall {{be subject to}} subpoena, discovery or inspection until the said witness has testified on direct examination {{in the trial of}} the case. In context, the word trial means a judicial proceeding conducted for the purpose of determining the guilt or innocence of a person, and according to the statutory language, <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>is</b> not entitled to production of a witness’ statement under the Act after the witness has testified at a preliminary hearing.|$|E
500|$|The {{most common}} {{judgment}} call involving an error {{occurs when the}} defense fails {{to put out a}} batter-runner who puts the ball in play. If the out is not recorded and the official scorer believes that an [...] "ordinary effort" [...] by the defense would have resulted in an out, <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>is</b> charged with an error, and the batter is not credited with a hit. Other common situations requiring a judgment call include unintentionally dropped foul balls that allow the batter to continue his at-bat, and poor throws to the next base when a runner attempts to advance.|$|E
5000|$|Defensive {{players are}} allowed to recover and advance {{backward}} passes. Previously <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>was</b> only allowed to recover but not advance backward passes.|$|R
25|$|One of the {{variations}} of the English Opening is called the Korchnoi Variation, a variation for White against <b>the</b> French <b>Defense</b> <b>is</b> called <b>the</b> Korchnoi Gambit and a closed variation of <b>the</b> Sicilian <b>Defense</b> <b>is</b> called <b>the</b> Korchnoi <b>Defense.</b>|$|R

500|$|Fischer was {{a master}} of playing with, and against, the Sicilian Defense. The next most common defense against Fischer's 1.e4 was the Caro-Kann Defense (1.e4 c6), against which Fischer had a good record. Fischer's worst record was against the French Defense (1.e4 e6), {{especially}} the [...] (1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Bb4). Fischer maintained that the Winawer was unsound because it exposed Black's kingside, and that, in his view, [...] "Black was trading off his good bishop with 3...Bb4 and...Bxc3." [...] Later on Fischer said: [...] "I may yet be forced {{to admit that the}} Winawer is sound. But I doubt it! <b>The</b> <b>defense</b> <b>is</b> anti-positional and weakens the K-side." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{decision}} to charge an error to <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>is</b> {{the most well-known}} responsibility of the official scorer. Some situations automatically call for an error to be charged to the defense by rule, but most charged errors {{are the result of}} a play that requires a judgment call. Broadly speaking, an error is charged to the defense when an [...] "ordinary effort" [...] by the defense would have either recorded an out or prevented a runner from advancing, but the defense fails to do so. When an error is charged, the official scorer must charge the error to one of the fielders {{who were involved in the}} play. Errors are primarily discussed in rule 10.12.|$|E

50|$|Alabama's <b>defense</b> <b>was</b> ranked {{first in}} the nation in points allowed (11.8) and yards per game (248). <b>The</b> <b>defense</b> <b>was</b> led by {{defensive}} back Minkah Fitzpatrick, who had six interceptions and 62 total tackles.|$|R
50|$|The {{notion of}} {{temporary}} insanity {{argues that a}} defendant was insane during the commission of a crime, but they later regained their sanity after the criminal act was carried out. This legal <b>defense</b> <b>is</b> commonly used to defend individuals that have committed crimes of passion. <b>The</b> <b>defense</b> <b>was</b> first used by U.S. Congressman Daniel Sickles of New York in 1859 after he had killed his wife's lover, Philip Barton Key. <b>The</b> <b>defense</b> <b>was</b> later used commonly during the 1940s and 1950s. Another 19th century case was that of Charles J. Guiteau, who assassinated President James Garfield in 1881. Guiteau's Case, 10 F.161 (1882).|$|R

2500|$|The same trick can {{be tried}} {{with the king}} {{on the other side}} of the pawn. [...] The white king is not close enough to force a win in this position, but <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>is</b> difficult.|$|E
2500|$|Two pawns for the exchange: this is {{normally}} a draw. [...] With a bishop either side may have winning chances. [...] With a knight, the rook may have winning chances and <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>is</b> {{difficult for the}} knight if the pawns are scattered.|$|E

2500|$|Minor penalties, such as boarding, charging, cross checking, elbowing, holding, illegal substitution, hooking, high-sticking, tripping, body contact, slashing, {{unsportsmanlike conduct}} and interference. The {{offending}} player must {{sit in the}} penalty box for two or four minutes depending on {{the severity of the}} penalty (other exceptions apply) and her team plays short-handed. [...] The penalty ends when the team with the penalty is scored on, or the penalty time runs out. [...] (If <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>is</b> serving two penalties, the oldest penalty ends.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Positions with {{isolated}} pawns {{have fewer}} chances to win than with connected pawns. Positions with two rook pawns {{are often a}} draw. A position with a rook pawn and bishop pawn {{on the same side}} of the board is usually a draw if they are not far advanced, but <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>is</b> difficult. Overall, the rook pawn and bishop pawn win in 61% of games [...] The rook pawn and bishop pawn almost always win if they both reach their sixth rank. Other drawn positions exist , [...]|$|E
50|$|The {{other is}} an action taken by <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> {{that means to}} charge towards the quarterback, kicker or punter across the line of scrimmage.
