5|$|The Homosexual Matrix {{is a book}} by American {{psychologist}} Clarence Arthur Tripp, {{in which}} the author discusses the biological and sociological implications of homosexuality, and also attempts to explain heterosexuality and bisexuality. The book {{was first published in}} 1975 by McGraw-Hill Book Company, and later republished in a revised edition in 1987. Based on his review of the evidence, Tripp argues <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>do</b> not become homosexual due to factors such as hormone levels, fear of the opposite sex, or the influence of dominant and close-binding mothers, that the amount of attention fathers give to their sons has no effect on the development of homosexuality, that psychoanalytic theories of the development of homosexuality are untenable and based on false assumptions, and that sexual orientation is not innate and depends on learning. Tripp considers early puberty and early masturbation important factors in the development of male homosexuality, and maintains that a majority of people are heterosexual because their socialization has made them want to be heterosexual. He also argues in favor of social tolerance of homosexuality and non-conformist behavior in general.|$|E
5|$|The Minister can declare any fence or barrier {{surrounding}} {{a part of}} a security area to be a perimeter fence. The Commissioner of Police is permitted to take steps to prevent people from crossing the fence or passing articles over, through or under the fence, including defensive measures that involve or may involve danger to life. If the measures are taken in a place other than on, under or within the perimeter fence, the Commissioner must take precautions – including displaying prominent warning signs – to ensure <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>do</b> not accidentally enter the area. If anyone is injured or dies {{as a result of a}} defensive measure, no compensation is payable unless the Minister certifies that it is just and equitable for such compensation to be paid. It is an offence to cross or attempt to cross, or pass or attempt to pass any article over, though or under a perimeter fence except at an authorized entry point; and to damage, attempt to damage or tamper with any fence or any gate or movable barrier at an entry point.|$|E

25|$|One study {{looked at}} the root of the hot-hand fallacy as being from an {{inability}} to appropriately judge sequences. The study compiled research from dozens of behavioral and cognitive studies that examined the hot-hand and gambler's fallacies with random mechanisms and skill-generated streaks. In terms of judging random sequences the general conclusion was <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>do</b> not have a statistically correct concept of random. It concluded that human beings are built to see patterns in sensory and conceptual data of all types.|$|E

Otherwise the most common {{signs and symptoms of}} Zika fever are fever, rash, conjunctivitis (red eyes), muscle and joint pain, and headache, which are similar to signs and symptoms of dengue and chikungunya fever. The time from a mosquito bite to developing symptoms is not yet known, but is probably a few days to a week.

25|$|The hedonic {{treadmill}} theory originally {{proposed that}} most people return to a neutral level of SWB (i.e. neither happy nor unhappy) as they habituate to events. However, subsequent {{research has shown that}} for most people, the baseline level of SWB is at least mildly positive, as most people tend to report being at least somewhat happy in general and tend to experience positive mood when no adverse events are occurring. Additional refinements to this theory have shown <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>do</b> not adapt to all life events equally, as people tend to adapt rapidly to some events (e.g. imprisonment), slowly to others (e.g. the death of a loved one), and not at all to others (e.g. noise and sex).|$|E

25|$|A third gain in {{cognitive}} ability involves thinking about thinking itself, a process {{referred to as}} metacognition. It often involves monitoring one's own cognitive activity during the thinking process. Adolescents' improvements in knowledge of their own thinking patterns lead to better self-control and more effective studying. It is also relevant in social cognition, resulting in increased introspection, self-consciousness, and intellectualization (in the sense of thought about one's own thoughts, rather than the Freudian definition as a defense mechanism). Adolescents are much better able than children to understand <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>do</b> not have complete control over their mental activity. Being able to introspect may lead to two forms of adolescent egocentrism, which results in two distinct problems in thinking: the imaginary audience and the personal fable. These likely peak at age fifteen, along with self-consciousness in general.|$|E

Quattlebaum noted, [...] "The story's structure– an expert interweaving of past, present and future– brilliantly contradicts Miranda's commonsensical belief that the end can't happen before the middle." [...] Stead explained her view of time travel in her novel, where going back in time is fulfilling the future, rather than changing it. She hoped to make the time travel element logical to show that [...] "Miranda wasn't struggling to understand the seeming randomness and infinity of the universe, but learning that her world has value and <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>do</b> care about her".|$|E

Dixon was at first hesitant to join, fearing that snobbery within the music industry would damage her career. In a later interview, she said, [...] "there's always this preconceived idea <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>do</b> reality TV shows {{because they want to}} kick-start their careers whereas I was actually worried that it would affect it." [...] They had been the favourite from the third week, receiving the most points from the judges on numerous occasions. Dixon herself gained high appraisal from the judges, even being likened to a [...] "young Josephine Baker" [...] by Bruno Tonioli. They received 4.5 million votes in the final, beating actor Matt Di Angelo and professional dancer Flavia Cacace to win the glitter disco ball. Dixon is currently the most successful contestant to ever take part in Strictly Come Dancing, with an average point score of 36.5/40, the highest average score from any contestant to ever take part in the show.|$|E
