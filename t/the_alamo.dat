5|$|Santa Anna led an army to San Antonio de Bexar, {{arriving}} on February 23, 1836, and immediately initiating a siege of <b>the</b> <b>Alamo,</b> which housed Texian Army troops. As the Mexican Army had approached San Antonio, several of <b>the</b> <b>Alamo</b> defenders brought their families into <b>the</b> <b>Alamo</b> {{to keep them}} safe. During the twelve days of the siege, Alamo co-commander William Barret Travis sent multiple couriers to the acting Texas government, the remaining Texas army under James Fannin, and various Texas communities, asking for reinforcements, provisions, and ammunition.|$|E

5|$|Travis assumed {{command of}} <b>the</b> <b>Alamo</b> {{garrison}} on February 11, when Neill {{was granted a}} furlough. On February 23, Santa Anna arrived in Béxar {{at the head of}} approximately 1500 Mexican troops. The 150 Texian soldiers were unprepared for this development. As they rushed to <b>the</b> <b>Alamo,</b> Texians quickly herded cattle into the complex and scrounged for food in nearby houses. The Mexican army initiated a siege of <b>the</b> <b>Alamo</b> and raised a blood-red flag signalling no quarter. Travis responded with a blast from the Alamo's largest cannon.|$|E

5|$|After Houston {{received}} word that Santa Anna was leading a large force to San Antonio, Bowie offered to lead volunteers to defend <b>the</b> <b>Alamo</b> from the expected attack. He arrived with 30men on January 19, {{where they found}} a force of 104men with a few weapons and a few cannons, but not many supplies and little gunpowder. Houston {{knew that there were}} not enough men to hold the fort in an attack and had given Bowie authority to remove the artillery and blow up the fortification. Bowie and <b>the</b> <b>Alamo</b> commander, James C. Neill, decided they did not have enough oxen to move the artillery, and {{they did not want to}} destroy the fortress. On January 26, one of Bowie's men, James Bonham, organized a rally which passed a resolution in favor of holding <b>the</b> <b>Alamo.</b> Bonham signed the resolution first, with Bowie's signature second.|$|E

5|$|During the siege, {{newly elected}} delegates from across Texas {{met at the}} Convention of 1836. On March 2, the delegates {{declared}} independence, forming the Republic of Texas. Four days later, the delegates at the convention received a dispatch Travis had written March 3 warning of his dire situation. Unaware that <b>the</b> <b>Alamo</b> had fallen, Robert Potter called for the convention to adjourn and march immediately to relieve <b>the</b> <b>Alamo.</b> Sam Houston convinced the delegates to remain in Washington-on-the-Brazos to develop a constitution. After being appointed sole commander of all Texian troops, Houston journeyed to Gonzales to take command of the 400volunteers who were still waiting for Fannin to lead them to <b>the</b> <b>Alamo.</b>|$|E
5|$|Fearing for {{the safety}} of his wife's {{relatives}} in San Antonio, Bowie invited her cousins Getrudis Navarro and Juana Navarro Alsbury, as well as Alsbury's 18-month-old son, Alijo Perez Jr., to stay inside the walls of <b>the</b> <b>Alamo.</b> Bowie also brought several black servants, some of whom worked at the Veramendi Palace, into the security of <b>the</b> <b>Alamo</b> fortress. Bowie had been ill, and twodoctors, including the fort surgeon, were unable to diagnose his illness. Travis became the sole commander of the forces when Bowie was confined to bed. Santa Anna and his army began a siege of <b>the</b> <b>Alamo</b> on February 24. The Mexican army raised a red flag to warn the defenders that no quarter would be given.|$|E
5|$|Many Texas {{residents}} {{disagreed with}} the convention's perception. As the message spread across Texas, settlers left their homes and assembled in Gonzales, where Colonel James Fannin was due to arrive with the remaining Texian Army troops. On February 27 one group of reinforcements impatiently set out on their own; as a result 32 additional Texians entered <b>the</b> <b>Alamo.</b> Research by historian Thomas Ricks Lindley indicates that an additional 50 or 60 men reinforced <b>the</b> <b>Alamo</b> on March 4.|$|E

5|$|The first English-language {{histories}} of the battle were written and published by Texas Ranger and amateur historian John Henry Brown. The next major treatment of the battle was Reuben Potter's The Fall of <b>the</b> <b>Alamo,</b> published in The Magazine of American History in 1878. Potter based his work on interviews {{with many of the}} Mexican survivors of the battle. The first full-length, non-fiction book covering the battle, John Myers Myers' <b>The</b> <b>Alamo,</b> was published in 1948. In the decades since, the battle has featured prominently in many non-fiction works.|$|E
5|$|This {{letter was}} one of several that Travis sent during the siege of <b>the</b> <b>Alamo.</b> Each carried a similar message—the Mexican army had invaded Texas, <b>the</b> <b>Alamo</b> was surrounded, and the Texians needed more men and {{ammunition}} to wage a successful defense. No assistance was forthcoming from the Texas government. By this point infighting had rendered the provisional government completely ineffective, and delegates convened on March 1 at the Convention of 1836 to create a new government. Most of the delegates believed that Travis exaggerated the difficulties he faced.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{all of the}} Texians {{were killed}} at the Battle of <b>the</b> <b>Alamo</b> when the Mexican army {{attacked}} on March 6; Travis was likely the first to die. Unaware that <b>the</b> <b>Alamo</b> had fallen, reinforcements continued to assemble; over 400Texians were waiting in Gonzales when news of the Texian defeat reached the town on March 11. Earlier that day, General Sam Houston, newly reappointed commander of the Texian Army, had arrived in Gonzales. On hearing of the Alamo's fall, Houston took command of the assembled volunteers. The following month, this hastily organized army defeated Santa Anna at the Battle of San Jacinto, ending the Texas Revolution.|$|E

5|$|At 19:30 General Carey {{directed}} {{that the}} remaining elements guarding the Annex be withdrawn to DAO headquarters (<b>the</b> <b>Alamo)</b> where {{the last of}} the evacuees would await their flight. Once completed, the new defensive perimeter encompassed only LZ 36 and <b>the</b> <b>Alamo.</b> By 20:30 the last evacuees had been loaded onto helicopters. With the evacuation of the landing control teams from the Annex and Alamo completed, General Carey ordered the withdrawal of the ground security forces from the DAO Compound around 22:50. At 23:40 Marines destroyed the satellite terminal, the DAO Compound's last means of direct communication with the outside world. At 00:30 on 30 April, thermite grenades, having been previously placed in selected buildings, ignited as two CH-53s left the DAO parking lot carrying the last elements of BLT 2/4.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to pleas from Travis, James Fannin started from Goliad with 320 men, supplies and armaments, yet had to abort {{a day later}} due to a wagon breakdown. Final reinforcements were able to enter <b>the</b> <b>Alamo</b> during March 1–4, most of them from Gonzales which had become a recruitment camp. Others who had left intending to return were unable to re-enter. At 5:30a.m. on March 6, the Mexican army began the final siege. An hour later, all combatants inside <b>the</b> <b>Alamo</b> were dead. The bodies, {{with the exception of}} Gregorio Esparza's, were cremated on pyres and abandoned. Esparza's brother Francisco was a soldier in the Mexican army and received permission from Santa Anna for a Christian burial.|$|E
5|$|Krueger {{decided that}} he needed to have his own {{strategic}} reconnaissance capability. In November 1943, he formed <b>the</b> <b>Alamo</b> Scouts as a special unit for reconnaissance and raiding. An Alamo Scout Training Center for volunteers was established on Fergusson Island, not far from Alamo Force's headquarters on Goodenough Island, under the command of Colonel Frederick W. Bradshaw, whom Krueger had first encountered during the Louisiana maneuvers. The top graduates of the six-week training course were assigned to <b>the</b> <b>Alamo</b> Scouts; the other graduates were returned to their units where they could be used for similar work. By the end of the war, Alamo Scouts teams had conducted 106 missions.|$|E
