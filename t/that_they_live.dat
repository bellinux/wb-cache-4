5|$|After a jet-set life in Singapore, Adam {{returns to}} Manchester {{to visit his}} old friends and to see son Matthew (now portrayed by Ceallach Spellman), {{breaking}} the news of his upcoming nuptials with businesswoman Angela Zubayr (Karen David). This isn't well received amongst the group, especially Matthew who sees Angela {{as a replacement for}} his mother Rachel. Struggling to support his family, Pete finds himself in two run down jobs and suffering from depression, which Jenny seems oblivious too. Seeing a fault in their love life, she pursues a fling with client Trevor Green (Nicholas Gleaves), who begins to stalk her. Torn apart after the death of Harry (James Bolam), an old man who he was caring for, Pete considers suicide. David is entangled through a wrongdoing at work and is arrested, something which his wife Robyn finds humiliating and throws him out of their luxury Cheshire home. Karen finds herself on the dating game, and soon falls for Adam's father-in-law Eddie (Art Malik), though later discovers <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>live</b> in two very different worlds, with Karen's twin daughters Ellie (Ella Hunt) and Olivia (Daisy Edgar-Jones) still dependant on her. Jenny's ex-partner Robert (Robert Webb) from her time in New York City turns up on her doorstep determined to see their daughter Chloe (Madeleine Edmondson), who still believes that Pete is her father. Struggling to cope with living in Manchester and being step-mother to Matthew, Angela decides to end her marriage with Adam, who fell quickly for his landlord Tina Reynolds (Leanne Best). At Adam's 49th Birthday party, the Marsden's eldest son Josh (Callum Woodhouse) arrives from Spain with former nanny Ramona (Jacey Salles), and it is later revealed that he is gay.|$|E

30|$|Regarding {{the means}} of the {{perceived}} distances, we first noticed that for every study site the perceived distances are higher than the objective ones. In Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer, every respondent lived in areas exposed to coastal flooding according to the hazards maps but they perceived living on average at 980  m from areas exposed to coastal flooding. Respondents in Barneville-Carteret perceived living on average at 245  m from exposed areas, that being 2.6 times more than the average objective distance. 27.2 % of the respondents (25 individuals) who actually lived in exposed areas (according to experts’ hazard maps) estimated <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>lived</b> in exposed areas. 9.8 % of the respondents (9 individuals) who didn’t actually live in exposed areas estimated <b>that</b> <b>they</b> didn’t <b>live</b> in exposed areas. 9.8 % (9 individuals) who didn’t actually live in exposed areas estimated <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>lived</b> in exposed areas. In Saintes-Maries-de-la-mer 34.2 % (25 individuals) who actually lived in exposed areas estimated <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>lived</b> in exposed areas. 65.8 % (48 individuals) who actually lived in exposed areas estimated <b>that</b> <b>they</b> didn’t <b>live</b> in exposed areas. In Châtelaillon-Plage respondents perceived to live on average 19.5 times more than the average objective distances. 11.1 % (8 individuals) who actually lived in exposed areas estimated <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>lived</b> in exposed areas. 54.2 % (39 individuals) who actually lived in exposed areas estimated <b>that</b> <b>they</b> didn’t <b>live</b> in exposed areas. 2.7 % (2 individuals) who didn’t actually live in exposed areas estimated <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>lived</b> in exposed areas. At least, respondents from Sainte-Anne who perceived to live on average 1.6 times more than the average objective distances. 7.6 % (5 individuals) who actually lived in exposed areas estimated <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>lived</b> in exposed areas. 1.5 % (1 individual) who actually lived in an exposed area estimated that he or she didn’t live in an exposed area. 12.1 % (8 individuals) who didn’t actually live in exposed areas estimated <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>lived</b> in exposed areas.|$|R

25|$|A theme well {{covered in}} the novel is that of {{cultures}} suffering technological breakdowns who then proceed to revert to belief systems along religious lines. Most Ringworld societies have forgotten <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>live</b> on an artificial structure, and now attribute the phenomena and origin of their world to divine power.|$|E
25|$|The World Bank {{concludes that}} governments and feudal elites {{extending}} {{to the poor}} the right to the land <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>live</b> and use are 'the key to reducing poverty' citing that land rights greatly increase poor people's wealth, in some cases doubling it. Although approaches varied, the World Bank said the key issues were security of tenure and ensuring land transactions costs were low.|$|E
25|$|In antiquity {{and in the}} bible, dragons were {{imagined}} as huge serpentine monsters, {{which means}} that the image of a fire-breathing dragon with four/two legs and wings came much later—in the late Middle Ages; Most of stories say <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>live</b> in the sea, the Babylonian myths of Tiamat, the myth of the Hydra, Scylla, Cetus and Echidna in the Greek mythology and maybe even the Leviathan, confirm that.|$|E

25|$|Hilcrest Honors Community is the {{smallest}} residence hall in Virginia Tech at a student capacity of 108.

The Honors Residential College in East Ambler Johnston is the only other residence hall which has the same requirements.|$|E
25|$|Rand's {{explanation}} of values presents {{the view that}} an individual's primary moral obligation is to achieve his own well-being—it is for {{his life and his}} self-interest that an individual ought to adhere to a moral code. Ethical egoism is a corollary of setting man's life as the moral standard. Rand believed that rational egoism is the logical consequence of humans following evidence wherever it leads them. The only alternative would be <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>live</b> without orientation to reality.|$|E
25|$|Residents and {{businesses}} identify their locations mostly by building number, and occasionally {{by the name}} of a prominent structure. Residents know where in the city certain series of building numbers are located; numbers tend to be aggregated in blocks, so someone might say <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>live</b> in the 2600s. Around 2003, street names were developed, although there were delays in finalizing them and posting the signs. Street numbers have not been assigned, and building numbers continue to be used. Iqaluit is the only Canadian capital city not to have traffic signals.|$|E

50|$|St. Tysilio {{has been}} confused, historically, with Saint Sulien, with some {{scholars}} suggesting <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{were the same}} historical character. The facts <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>lived</b> in different Celtic states, and had different feast days from antiquity, make this suggestion unlikely.|$|R
25|$|Concerning the {{lifespan}} of drones and Minds, {{given the}} durability of Culture technology and the aforementioned options of mindstate backups, {{it is reasonable to}} assume <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>live</b> as long as they choose. Even Minds, with their utmost complexity, are known to be backed up (and reactivated if they for example die in a risky mission, see GSV Lasting Damage). It is noted that even Minds themselves do not necessarily live forever either, often choosing to eventually sublime or even committing suicide (as does the double-Mind GSV Lasting Damage due to its choices in the Culture-Idiran war).|$|E
25|$|Feminist {{geography}} is often {{considered part of}} a broader postmodern approach to the subject which is not primarily concerned with the development of conceptual theory in itself but rather focuses on the real experiences of individuals and groups in their own localities, upon the geographies <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>live</b> in within their own communities. In addition to its analysis of the real world, it also critiques existing geographical and social studies, arguing that academic traditions are delineated by patriarchy, and that contemporary studies which do not confront the nature of previous work reinforce the male bias of academic study.|$|E
25|$|The {{common name}} {{alludes to the}} {{supposed}} ability these snakes have to launch themselves at an attacker during a strike, thereby bridging a distance that is {{equal to or greater}} than the length of the body. Mehrtens (1987) states <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>live</b> up to their name, striking at their assailants with such force that they actually leave the ground. Campbell and Lamar (2004), on the other hand, describe this as greatly exaggerated, saying that actually these snakes are only able to strike about half of their own body length. In addition, they describe them as slow moving and non-aggressive. However, when provoked all species will put on a rather dramatic open-mouthed threat display.|$|E

25|$|Much of {{the humor}} of The Order of the Stick {{is based on}} roleplaying games (particularly the Dungeons and Dragons 3rd Edition ruleset), with {{characters}} freely discussing game mechanics, such as experience points, skill sets, and random encounters. The characters know very well <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>live</b> in a world controlled {{by the rules of}} roleplaying games, but attempt to function normally within it, often with nonsensical results. Characters have been shown browsing through rulebooks for the D game to select a certain monster for use, or to learn about a new class. Common techniques of players and Dungeon Masters are spoofed, such as the weather of the campaign world changing to herald a dramatic encounter, or a player who does not bother to complete the details of his character's backstory. Burlew's satirical humor addresses many of the clichés of the fantasy genre as a whole, often by twisting them in new and different ways.|$|E
25|$|During the 1977 summer {{hiatus of}} the series, ABC and Fawcett entered {{a legal battle}} over her contract. At the {{beginning}} of the series, all three female leads signed five-year contracts, and the network was insistent <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>live</b> up to their commitments. Business partners Leonard Goldberg and Aaron Spelling tried intensively to work out a deal with Fawcett and her agents. Goldberg and Spelling had arranged for her to make one theatrical film during her summer hiatuses and her choice over subsequent television shows and miniseries. ABC even agreed to raise her salary from $5,000 to $8,000 a week, but she declined the offers. ABC reluctantly released her from her series contract in the summer of 1977. However, she was assigned to another contract with ABC, stating that since she left her contract four years early that she would return to the series later on in its run for six guest appearances. Fawcett would return as Jill Munroe on Charlie's Angels for three guest appearances in season three. She again returned for three guest spots in season four in {{what turned out to be}} her final appearances on the show.|$|E
25|$|Critics have {{suggested}} that the system is fundamentally unfair as it restricts the choice for parents to choose schools and schools to choose their students although it does allow all students living in the community to have entry, as of right, regardless of their academic or social profile. In addition, there is evidence that property values surrounding some more desirable schools become inflated, thus restricting the ability of lower socio-economic groups to purchase a house in the zone, though this is off set by the fact that students are accepted from rental accommodation or from homes where they are boarding with a bona fide relative or friend living in the zone. Some parents have purposely flouted zone boundaries by giving false addresses, such as that of a business they own in the zone, or by renting homes in the zone only through the enrolment process and moving out before the student commences school. Schools are now requesting rates invoices, tenancy agreements, or power and telephone bills from parents to prove their residential address, Some schools have gone as far as requiring parents to make a statutory declaration before a Justice of the Peace or similar <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>live</b> in the school zone, which makes it impossible for a parent to cheat the zone without also committing a criminal offence (making a false statutory declaration is punishable by up to three years' imprisonment).|$|E
