Perioral dermatitis refers to a red bumpy rash around the mouth.|$|E
25|$|The {{human brain}} {{is not fully}} {{developed}} {{by the time a}} person reaches puberty. Between the ages of 10 and 25, the brain undergoes changes that have important implications for behavior (see Cognitive development below). The brain reaches 90% of its adult size by the time a person is six years of age. Thus, the brain does not grow in size much during adolescence. However, the creases in the brain continue to become more complex until the late teens. The biggest changes in <b>the</b> <b>folds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brain during this time occur in the parts of the cortex that process cognitive and emotional information.|$|E
25|$|The forelimbs {{are covered}} with large {{transverse}} scales. Both the forelimbs and the hind limbs are webbed, reflecting their largely aquatic habits. The necks of black marsh turtles are characteristically thick, forming a collar around the head when it is retracted into the shell. All of the limbs, the tail, and the neck are dark gray to black. The head is broad with a short upwardly pointed snout. It is mostly black on top with cream to yellow markings around the eyes and at the throat. It also has a pair of pale white to yellow spots just behind the tympanum, usually hidden behind <b>the</b> <b>folds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> neck. The powerful jaws are pale yellow to pale brown in color and curves upwards, earning it the charming name of 'smiling terrapin'.|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} costume {{was composed}} of a large, flowing red robe, over a matching red jumpsuit. A red, wide brimmed hat baring the circle-A insignia; a golden, metallic face mask; and red hood, completed the outfit. <b>The</b> <b>folds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> robe concealed various weapons and gadgets. Breyfogle later expressed that the color scheme chosen held symbolic purpose. The red robes [...] "represented the blood of all the innocents sacrificed in war." [...] The gold cane, face mask, and circle-A symbol represented purity and spirituality. The connection to spirituality was also emphasized through the hat and loose fabric, which mimicked that of a priest. Breyfogle believed the loose clothes [...] " [...] better with a wide-brimmed hat. It's more of a colloquial style of clothing..." [...] However, observers have noted that Breyfogle's Christian upbringing may have also inspired the [...] "priestly analogy." ...|$|E
500|$|The Doni Tondo is {{believed}} to be the only existing panel picture Michelangelo painted without the aid of assistants; and, unlike his Manchester Madonna and Entombment (both National Gallery, London), the attribution to him has never been questioned. [...] The juxtaposition of bright colors foreshadows the same use of color in Michelangelo’s later Sistine ceiling frescoes. <b>The</b> <b>folds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drapery are sharply modeled, and the skin of the figures is so smooth, it looks as if the medium is marble. The surface treatment of the massive figures resembles a sculpture more than a painting. [...] The nude figures in the background have softer modeling and look to be precursors to the ignudi, the male nude figures in the Sistine Ceiling frescoes. Michelangelo’s technique includes shading from the most intense colors first to the lighter shades on top, using the darker colors as shadows, a technique called cangiante. By applying the pigment in a certain way, Michelangelo created an [...] "unfocused" [...] effect in the background and focused detail in the foreground. [...] The most vibrant color is located within the Virgin’s garments, signifying her importance within the image. [...] X-rays of the painting show that Michelangelo incorporated every known pigment used at the time. [...] The masculinity of Mary could be explained by Michelangelo’s use of male models for female figures, as was done for the Sistine Chapel.|$|E
