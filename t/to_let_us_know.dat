500|$|Casting {{director}} Rick Millikan was {{tasked with}} finding a suitable actor {{to play the}} part of the beggar. Millikan's only instructions were to look for [...] "a small all-Indian man with no legs." [...] Eventually, Gurdeep Roy, better known as Deep Roy was chosen to play the part. Deep Roy was a noted stunt man who had notably played Droopy McCool of the Max Rebo Band in Return of the Jedi. Deep Roy, however, is not an amputee and so a cart with a false bottom was created. Anytime there was a scene where the beggar had to move, blue screen technology was used to add the background in during post-production. The cart featured a distinct [...] "squeak" [...] that Paul Rabwin described as [...] "creepy". He noted, [...] "There was a squeak that had <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>us</b> <b>know</b> that it was him. It had to scare us [...] Finally we came up with what we thought was just the right squeak and John [...] said 'Okay, that's the one.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Following its premiere, {{the video}} for [...] "Triumphant (Get 'Em)" [...] was {{generally}} well received by critics. E!'s Bruna Nessif commended Carey's [...] "post-baby body", and wrote [...] " [...] made sure <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>us</b> <b>know</b> that her comeback isn't {{only in the}} music world, but physically, too." [...] Tanner Stransky from Entertainment Weekly felt the video was [...] "very fitting" [...] for the song's vibe, and felt it presented [...] "a distinct level of Mimi fabulosity." [...] A reporter from the Daily Mail called the visuals [...] "sizzling", and complimented the singers moments on the golden stage as [...] "glittering" [...] and [...] "fabulous". The Hollywood Reporters David Lipshutz described the video as a [...] "glitzy clip". Additionally, he outed its final segment of [...] "Carey singing while confetti rain down" [...] as the video's highlight. While noting the video's [...] "classic Mimi fashions", MTV's Jocelyn Vena expressed how Carey's ringside singing during the finale truly tied in with the song's message of [...] "overcoming adversity". Marc Hogan of Spin noted it as [...] "expensive-looking and cinematic", while a writer from CNN described the singer as [...] "glamorous as ever." ...|$|E
500|$|Los Angeles Timess Ann Powers {{described}} it as an [...] "aggressive track", while Lauren Carter of the Boston Herald wrote [...] "Carey's musical stiff-arm ends with some vocal acrobatics <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>us</b> <b>know</b> she's still got it. Expect to get 'Obsessed' this summer." [...] MTV News rated the song {{as one of the}} contenders for the [...] "best of the summer", writing [...] "Mimi returns, this time with an Auto-Tuned kiss-off to wannabe lotharios (and Eminem?) that will probably be the soundtrack to a million summer hookups and just as many public-intoxication collars. Glossy, flossy and decidedly [...] "urban", Mariah strikes back. Your radio has been warned. AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine chose the song as a [...] "top pick" [...] from Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel, while Amos Barshad of The New York Times listed it as the fifth top song of the summer. In contrast, [...] "Obsessed" [...] received a mixed review from the Los Angeles Times writer, Todd Martens, who wrote that although [...] "its feistier Mimi than 're used to", she ultimately [...] "has been molded to fit current trends" [...] and that the single [...] "again sells out the songbird to her producers." [...] At the ASCAP 27th Annual Pop Music Awards, [...] "Obsessed" [...] won [...] "Most Performed Song".|$|E

500|$|Muransky {{also set}} the all-time [...] "Beef Bowl" [...] record by {{consuming}} [...] of prime rib at Lawry's before the 1979 Rose Bowl. Muransky later recalled: [...] "Bubba Paris and I were two happy freshmen eating {{together at the}} Lawry's Beef Bowl event before the 1979 Rose Bowl Game. After we had enjoyed our fourth plate of prime rib, mashed potatoes, corn and Yorkshire pudding, Bubba asked what the record was, and they said 7 cuts. Bubba continued for 3 more cuts, and I continued for four, totally under the Bo Schembechler radar screen. When they delivered the 8th cut to me, the media started to gather around my table, Bo walked by {{and let me know}} what he was thinking without ever saying a word. Afterward, a Paris-Muransky night out ended with some pizza. The next morning in practice, Bo made an example of Bubba and me. We never ran so much in our lives as we did that day. We were in every play of scrimmage and then we ran sprints." [...] When the Wolverines returned to Pasadena for the 1981 Rose Bowl, [...] "Bo {{made it a point to}} come to the back of the plane and talk to me and Bubba Paris. He wanted <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>us</b> <b>know</b> that my record from a couple years earlier would not be in jeopardy because we were going to be sitting with him at the Lawry's Beef Bowl. He said he was going to limit each of us to two cuts of prime rib." [...] Schembechler had his own take on the story: [...] "I let 'em eat because they were freshmen. They weren't gonna play anyway." ...|$|E
2500|$|Each summer, Hines toured {{with his}} whole band for three months, {{including}} through the South – {{the first black}} big band to do so. He explained, [...] " [...] we traveled by train through the South, they would send a porter back to our car <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>us</b> <b>know</b> when the dining room was cleared, {{and then we would}} all go in together. We couldn't eat when we wanted to. We had to eat when they were ready for us." ...|$|E

Dope's influences include Ministry, Nine Inch Nails, KISS, Guns N' Roses, White Zombie and Mötley Crüe. Dope's lyrics are known for being obscene and aggressive. In a review of Dope's album Felons and Revolutionaries, NME said [...] "In American Pie, a boy puts his cock in an apple pie, <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>us</b> <b>know</b> that there's something rotten {{at the heart of the}} American Dream. Ex-con brothers Edsel and Simon Dope, though, would probably put someone else's cock in the apple pie, cut it off, lace the pie with strychnine, and serve it up at the Clinton dinner table." ...|$|E

40|$|Join us in {{the spirit}} of {{solidarity}} for a night of spoken word and poetry on September 23, 2017 from 8 - 10 pm. Spoken word {{has been used as a}} form of self-expression for the last few decades. It is a freer form of poetry that contains messages that are often political and provoking, discussing issues such as discrimination, race, gender, ability, class and sexuality. Our desire is to use this form of self-expression to celebrate our differences and similarities. It is a space to share the struggle and fight for liberation. All voices and intersections are welcome. No experience required. Just come with an open mind and open heart.

60|$|However, {{when they}} saw us put out English colours, they knew not what to think of it, but lay by awhile {{to see what we}} would do. I was as much puzzled as they, for, as I came nearer, I thought they seemed to be English ships, as well by their bulk as by their way of working; and as I came still nearer, I thought I could {{perceive}} so plainly by my glasses that they were English seamen, that I made a signal to our other ship, who had the van, and was just bearing down upon them, to bring to; and I sent my boat to him to know his opinion. He sent me word, he did believe them to be English; and the more, said he, because they could be no other nation but English or French, and the latter he was sure they were not; but, since we were the largest ships, and that they might as plainly see us to be English as we could see them, he said he was for fighting them, because they ought <b>to</b> have <b>let</b> <b>us</b> <b>known</b> who they were first.

30|$|He was {{sometimes}} incredibly courageous, while not letting anyone see it. I {{would like to}} give two examples: when we were just starting laparoscopic treatment for ectopic pregnancy, which at the time seemed temerarious if not preposterous, the major specialists at the time advised him to stop this dangerous method of surgery that was sure to come to nothing! He took care not <b>to</b> <b>let</b> any of <b>us</b> <b>know.</b> Later on, after presenting the laparoscopic treatment of ovarian cysts at the Institut Gustave Roussy, the head of this prestigious establishment called him in to tell him never to cross the Institute’s doorstep. We only got to hear about this many years later. He kept the difficulties to himself, protecting us and encouraging us to continue with this surgery in which he had so much faith.|$|R

Our {{knowledge}} of human labor, if intimate enough, will, I think, mass {{it for the}} most part into two kinds--mining and molding; the labor that seeks for things, and the labor that shapes them. Of these the last should be always orderly, for we ought to have some conception of the whole of what we have to make before we try to make any part of it; but the labor of seeking must be often methodless, following the veins of the mine as they branch, or trying for them where they are broken. And the mine, which we would now open into the souls of men, as they govern the mysteries of their handicrafts, being rent into many dark and divided ways, {{it is not possible to}} map our work beforehand, or resolve on its directions. We will not attempt to bind ourselves to any methodical treatment of our subject, but will get at the truths of it here and there, as they seem extricable; only, though we cannot know to what depth we may have <b>to</b> dig, <b>let</b> <b>us</b> <b>know</b> clearly what we are digging for. We desire to find by what rule some Art is called good, and other Art bad: we desire to find the conditions of character in the artist which are essentially connected with the goodness of his work: we desire to find what are the methods of practice which form this character or corrupt it; and finally, how the formation or corruption of this character is connected with the general prosperity of nations.|$|R

Wrong thoughts of this or that abuses it, and takes its natural glory from it. Take heed, therefore, of misapprehending, while thou art seeking to apprehend Christ as thy Advocate. Men judge of Christ's offices while they are at too great a distance from them; but [...] "let them come near," [...] says God, [...] "then let them speak," [...] (Isa 41:1); or as Elihu said to his friends, when he had seen them judge amiss, [...] "Let us choose <b>to</b> <b>us</b> judgment, <b>let</b> <b>us</b> <b>know</b> among ourselves what is good" [...] (Job 34:4). So say I; study to know, rightly to know, the Advocate-office of Jesus Christ. It is one of the easiest things in the world to miss of the nature, while we speak of the name and offices of Jesus Christ; wherefore look to it, that thou study the nature of the office of his advocateship, of his advocateship for, for so you ought to consider it. There is an Advocate for, not against, the children of God-"Jesus Christ the righteous." ...|$|R
40|$|Event synopsis: Marketing {{research}} has been challenging since almost its initial steps. Nowadays the digital world is changing consumer patterns, emerging new companies, {{and in the end}} eliciting a new society. This is not the only recent change; co-creation, sustainability, corporate social responsibility, intercultural relationships in a global world, new communications devices and platforms, big data, and new ways of interaction between consumers, consumers and brands, and stakeholders, are just the crest of an iceberg. Are these disconnected examples part of a new scenario? Are we facing a paradigm shift? Come <b>to</b> Valencia and <b>let</b> <b>us</b> <b>know</b> your academic contributions to the field. Share with others, interact with them, and be part of this evolving shift. Rigor and Relevance tend to be a common scheme for academics. Beyond doubt, a lot of progress in conceptual, even in theoretical constructs, research designs, methodologies, analytic tools and data analysis, have been taking place during the last years. This leads us into cutting edge research in the social sciences field, but still, knowledge is created by mutual interactions. Let´s promote a face-to-face interaction. From the diversity, from the advanced and latest contributions, from heterogeneous cultural backgrounds, we get much benefit. Therefore this is the main reason to come to EMAC 43 Valencia: to interact with your peers, present, ask, listen, and meet others...|$|R
