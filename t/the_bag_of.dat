5|$|Mr. Burns reveals to Smithers that {{he misses}} his {{cherished}} bear Bobo and desperately wants it back {{but has no}} idea where it is. Another flashback reveals Bobo's history: after Mr. Burns leaves it behind, the bear eventually finds its way to Charles Lindbergh, who tosses the bear into a crowd, where it is caught by Adolf Hitler. In 1945, Hitler blames Bobo for losing World War II and tosses him away. Bobo is seen again in 1957 on board the USS Nautilus headed for the North Pole. Bobo becomes encased in a block of ice until picked up by an ice-gathering expedition in 1993. <b>The</b> <b>bag</b> <b>of</b> ice with Bobo in it {{is sent to the}} Kwik-E-Mart in Springfield. Bart buys <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> <b>of</b> ice, finds Bobo inside and gives it to Maggie to play with.|$|E
5|$|At the store, SpongeBob and Patrick {{find the}} crown, but are nearly killed when the diver {{attempts}} to dry them out using a heat lamp. Their tears short-circuit the lamp's power cord, and its smoke activates the sprinkler system, reviving {{their bodies and}} the other dried sea creatures intended to be sold as souvenirs. As the sea creatures attack the diver, SpongeBob and Patrick take the crown {{and head for the}} beach. Patrick inadvertently loses <b>the</b> <b>Bag</b> <b>of</b> Winds while attempting to use it, but David Hasselhoff appears and offers them a ride; Dennis catches up to them but is knocked by a catamaran back into the sea. Hasselhoff opens up his rocket launching pecs to shoot SpongeBob and Patrick back to Bikini Bottom with the crown.|$|E

5|$|Once, Khandoba and Mhalsa {{play a game}} of saripat (translated as game of dice or chess). Khandoba loses {{everything}} to Mhalsa in the wager, except his dhoti, his flag, his staff (wand) and his bhandari, <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> <b>of</b> magical bhandara (turmeric powder). In a dream, he sees Banai and falls in love with her. He goes on a hunt in the forest, gets away from the army and stays with Banai for twelve years. He marries her in non-ritualistic marriage and brings her back to Jejuri. A variant describes how Khandoba arrives in Chandanpur on a hunting expedition and becomes thirsty. A Dhangar directs him to Banai's vada. Banai offers him water or sends a pot of water, in which Khandoba reads Banai's name. In another version, the pot with nine jewels is a sign for Khandoba to recognise Banai, the girl he saw in his dream. He falls for her and loses purposefully in saripat with Mhalsa and accepts a twelve-year exile. In this period, he disguises himself as an impoverished, old leper and becomes a man-servant of Banai's father. Some folk songs have erotic overtones, for example, some songs give erotic descriptions of Banai's beauty which maddens Khandoba.|$|E
5|$|The video {{opens with}} an empty room with a fish painting, and then shows Madonna holding to {{what looks like a}} baby, but is {{actually}} a big bag of water. Alternating scenes shows her in a red and black kimono dancing to the song. Then, a scene features a group of people of Asian heritage, who walk down a dark hallway. As Madonna sings the song in a black kimono, she grips onto <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> <b>of</b> water. When the chorus starts, it features Madonna in a red kimono continuing to dance. This scene carries on {{through the rest of the}} song. There are multiple scenes of Japanese people performing butoh dance moves coached by Swedish choreographer Su-En. These scenes were shot in a decommissioned R1 Reactor below the Royal Institute of Technology in central Stockholm. The ending scene has Madonna sitting while someone is painting her back and slowly rests her body on the group. As the song fades, Madonna is in her red kimono walking and laughing towards the camera and then the screen rapidly fades to black.|$|E

25|$|Valverde was not {{initially}} linked in the investigation, but documents from Madrid's Court 31 linked Valverde {{to a single}} bag of human plasma of the 211 total bags of blood and plasma seized in the investigation. <b>The</b> <b>bag</b> <b>of</b> human plasma was labelled with the codes Valv, Piti and 18.

Dick Pound, World Anti-Doping Agency president, said the CAS decision {{did not mean that}} Valverde was no longer a suspect.|$|E
25|$|The tubing from <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> <b>of</b> fluid being {{administered}} {{that connects}} to {{directly to the}} patient is called the primary tubing. Any additional IVs to be administered {{are connected to the}} primary tubing and are called secondary IV, or IV piggyback instead of having to place multiple catheters in the patient. When administering a secondary IV medication, the primary bag is held lower than the secondary bag so that the secondary medication can flow into the primary tubing rather than fluid from the primary bag flowing into the secondary tubing. The fluid from the primary bag is needed to help flush any remaining medication from the secondary IV from the tubing into the patient.|$|E

The young boy was paid by the Tanzim militia to detonate himself at the checkpoint. IDF soldiers manning the checkpoint were suspicious of {{him and told him}} to stay away from people. Later, an EOD team arrived and by using a police-sapper robot, removed the explosive belt from him. Hussam explained that he was offered 100 NIS and sex with virgins if he would perform the task. He said his friends mocked him in class.|$|E
25|$|One {{version has}} him {{throwing}} one purse for three consecutive nights. Another has him throwing the purses {{over a period}} of three years, each time the night before one of the daughters comes of age. Invariably, the third time the father lies in wait, trying to discover the identity of their benefactor. In one version the father confronts the saint, only to have Nicholas say it is not him he should thank, but God alone. In another version, Nicholas learns of the poor man's plan and drops the third bag down the chimney instead; a variant holds that the daughter had washed her stockings that evening and hung them over the embers to dry, and that <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> <b>of</b> gold fell into the stocking.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>bag</b> <b>of</b> {{cannabis}} was not fingerprinted by the Indonesian custom {{officials or}} police, nor analysed {{to determine its}} origin. The cannabis was contained in two bags, and although the outer bag had been handled by customs officers, Corby's defence argued that only {{the bottom of the}} inner bag had been contaminated. Therefore, it was claimed that fingerprinting of the inner bag could be of value to the defence if it was shown not to possess Corby's fingerprints. In spite of requests to have the bag tested, including {{at the time of her}} arrest, such had not occurred by the time of Corby's second court appearance on 3 February 2005. At that court appearance the bag was handled by court officials. A formal request for fingerprinting made after the court appearance was unsuccessful. The prosecution argued that fingerprinting was unnecessary, as Corby was found with the drugs in her possession.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} bout was {{the last}} match in the Terri Invitational Tournament, contested between The New Brood (Matt Hardy and Jeff Hardy) and Edge and Christian in a tag team ladder match. For the match, a bag with 100,000 dollars was hung from the ceiling, and {{the goal of the}} match was to use one of the two ladders in the ring to climb and retrieve the bag. The first team to retrieve the bag would win the match. The manager of The New Brood, Gangrel brought a ladder to the ring, but as a result, he got ejected from ringside by the referee. During the match, the ladders were set up so that one was on top of the other, resembling a Seesaw, Jeff jumped on one side so that the other side jutted upwards, knocking down both Matt and Christian. Later in the match, all four men were on the ladders and after Edge pushed Matt off of the ladder they were both on, he fell into the other ladder, knocking Christian to the mat. Jeff however, jumped onto the other ladder to continue to battle with Edge. As Jeff and Edge climbed the ladder, Jeff pushed Edge to the ground and grabbed <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> <b>of</b> money to win the match. As a result of winning the match, The New Brood won $100,000 and the managerial services of Terri Runnels. Backstage, the trio celebrated the win and their new partnership with a bottle of champagne.|$|E
500|$|During the Napoleonic Wars, a British gun team {{consisted}} of 5 numbered gunners - fewer crew than {{needed in the}} previous century.

The No.3, the loader, inserted <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> <b>of</b> powder and then the projectile. The No.2 then used a rammer, or the sponge reversed, to drive it in. At the same time, the No.4 ("ventsman") pressed his thumb on the vent hole to prevent a draught that might fan a flame. The charge loaded, the No.4 pricked the bagged charge through the vent hole and filled the vent with powder. At the No.1s command the No.5 would fire the piece with his slowmatch.|$|E

40|$|Image {{retrieval}} {{from large}} databases, such as popular social networks, collections of surveillance images and videos, or digital investigation archives, {{is a very}} important task for a number of applications. In digital investigation, hashing techniques are commonly used to index large quantities of images to detect copies from different archives. In the last few years, a number of image hashing techniques based on <b>the</b> <b>Bags</b> <b>of</b> Visual Words paradigm have been proposed. Recently, this paradigm has been augmented by using multiple descriptors (<b>Bags</b> <b>of</b> Visual Phrases) to exploit the coherence between different feature spaces. In this paper we propose to further improve <b>the</b> <b>Bags</b> <b>of</b> Visual Phrases approach exploiting the coherence between feature spaces not only in the image representation, but also in the codebooks generation. Experiments performed on real and synthetic near duplicate image datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed approach, which outperforms <b>the</b> original <b>Bags</b> <b>of</b> Visual Phrases approach...|$|R
