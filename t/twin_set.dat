5|$|East of the railway, {{the route}} crosses below US1. The {{eastbound}} lane has an exit ramp that connects to both directions of US1; in contrast, the westbound lane has a dedicated exit for both US1 northbound and a loop to US1 southbound. The road continues to the east, crossing a small inlet {{and a small}} island before ascending over the Indian River with twin bridges. At {{the eastern end of}} the bridges, the route again crosses a small island and inlet before reaching a narrow portion of Merritt Island. There, the causeway intersects with CR3. The route crosses a series of islands, forming another <b>twin</b> <b>set</b> of bridges over the Banana River. After reaching land for the final time, the route enters South Patrick Shores. It has a partial interchange with SR513, with only an eastbound exit and a westbound entrance. After passing north of a housing development, the causeway ends at an intersection with SR A1A.|$|E

40|$|A {{relationship}} has been proposed to exist between individual outcomes (live or stillbirth) of twins in the same set. Here, we analyze this association between live births and stillbirths among individuals in different twin pairs. When national birth registers are analyzed, individuals in opposite-sex <b>twin</b> <b>sets</b> can be identified and the correlation between individual outcomes estimated. However, full information about the individuals in same-sex <b>twin</b> <b>sets</b> is not, as a rule, available, and consequently, correlation coefficients cannot be estimated, but upper and lower limits of the correlation coefficients can be obtained. The methods introduced here were applied to data from Sweden (1869 – 1967), the Åland Islands (Finland) (1750 – 1949), the Kingdom of Saxony (1881 – 1900), and England andWales (1940 – 2003). Comparisons between the correlation coefficients among opposite-sex twins and the lower bound (minimum) of correlation coefficients among same-sex twins indicate that in all populations studied a stronger association exists between twins in same-sex rather than opposite-sex <b>twin</b> <b>sets</b> or pairs. For opposite-sex <b>twin</b> <b>sets</b> no general association between the correlation coefficient and the stillbirth rate was identified...|$|R

5|$|Independent twin sets or {{independent}} doubles {{consists of two}} independent cylinders and two regulators, each with a submersible pressure gauge. This system is heavier, more expensive to buy and maintain and more expensive to fill than a single cylinder set. The diver must swap demand valves during the dive to preserve a sufficient reserve of gas in each cylinder. If this is not done, then if a cylinder should fail the diver may end up having an inadequate reserve. Independent twin sets do not work well with air-integrated computers as they usually only monitor one cylinder. The complexity of switching regulators periodically to ensure both cylinders are evenly used may be offset by the redundancy of two entirely separate breathing gas supplies. The cylinders may be mounted as a <b>twin</b> <b>set</b> on the diver's back, or alternatively can be carried in a sidemount configuration where penetration of wrecks or caves requires it, and where the cylinder valves are in easy reach.|$|E
25|$|These {{include a}} {{secondary}} regulator on a manifolded <b>twin</b> <b>set</b> without isolation valve, a secondary regulator on a double cylinder valve {{on a single}} cylinder, an auxiliary second stage on a single regulator (octopus regulator), and the pneumofathometer line for surface supplied divers.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study {{reports on}} the {{experience}} of one hospital regarding the surgical aspects, anatomic investigation and outcomes of the management of 21 conjoined twin pairs over the past 20 years. METHODS: All cases of conjoined twins who were treated during this period were reviewed. A careful imaging evaluation was performed to detail the abdominal anatomy (particularly the liver), inferior vena cava, spleen and pancreas, either to identify the number of organs or to evaluate the degree of organ sharing. RESULTS: There were eight <b>sets</b> of ischiopagus <b>twins,</b> seven <b>sets</b> of thoracopagus <b>twins,</b> three <b>sets</b> of omphalopagus <b>twins,</b> two <b>sets</b> of thoraco-omphalo-ischiopagus <b>twins</b> and one <b>set</b> of craniopagus <b>twins.</b> Nine pairs of conjoined twins could not be separated due to the complexity of the organs (mainly the liver and heart) that were shared by both twins; these pairs included one <b>set</b> of ischiopagus <b>twins,</b> six <b>sets</b> of thoracopagus <b>twins</b> and one <b>set</b> of thoraco-omphalo-ischiopagus <b>twins.</b> Twelve <b>sets</b> were separated, including seven <b>sets</b> of ischiopagus <b>twins,</b> three <b>sets</b> of omphalopagus <b>twins,</b> one <b>set</b> of thoracopagus <b>twins</b> and one <b>set</b> of craniopagus conjoined twins. The abdominal wall was closed in the majority of patients with the use of mesh instead of the earlier method of using tissue expanders. The surgical survival rate was 66. 7 %, and one pair of twins who did not undergo separation is currently alive. CONCLUSION: A detailed anatomic study of the twins and surgical planning must precede separation. A well...|$|R
25|$|A {{manifolded}} <b>twin</b> <b>set</b> with {{isolation valve}} {{is a special}} case. It is a redundant air supply when the isolation valve is closed, as the cylinders are then for most practical purposes independent, but not when it is open, as a leak will eventually drain both cylinders. Divers who intend {{to rely on a}} manifolded twin for bailout {{need to be able to}} isolate the cylinders quickly, as a major leak can drain a set in quite a short time. In comparison with independent twins, the manifolded set is less task loading through the most of the dive, but requires skilled and immediate reaction in the event of a catastrophic failure, as it does not fail safe. If diving as part of a team, the risk is mitigated by the presence of buddies who can help.|$|E

40|$|A {{study of}} the blood {{pressure}} of 86 pairs of like-sexed twins over age 40 selected at random was performed. Twelve per cent {{were found to have}} a diastolic blood pressure in excess of 94 mm. Hg. In 4 out of 5 identical <b>twin</b> <b>sets</b> both members were found to have hypertension of about equal magnitude. In the fifth set, the predetermined definition of diastolic hypertension was not met in one member of the pair, although the systolic blood pressure was clearly elevated. In two identical <b>twin</b> <b>sets,</b> where information concerning previous blood pressure could be obtained, the age of onset of the hypertension differed. Among the 49 dizygetic <b>twin</b> <b>sets,</b> diastolic hypertension was found in 15 per cent of the individuals. In 3 of 12 of these pairs, it was present in both members.
