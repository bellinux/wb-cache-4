He lived in this house with his family and parents. He would eventually serve as the 31st United States Secretary of War and the 35th United States Attorney General.|$|E
25|$|The Mansion of Bahjí (Arabic: delight) is {{a summer}} house near Acre, Israel, where Bahá'u'lláh, {{founder of the}} Bahá'í Faith died in 1892. His shrine is located next <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>house.</b> The whole area was called Al-Bahjá (Place of Delight). The site has since been beautified with paradise gardens, which are called Haram-i-Aqdas (the Most Holy Precincts or Sanctuary) and are intersected by a {{circular}} path which serves to circumambulate the shrine. The Mansion, shrine, and surrounding gardens {{are among the most}} sacred spots on earth for Bahá'ís and are Bahá'í pilgrimage sites.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the late}} mediaeval Hystoria Fundacionis Prioratus Insule de Traile claims that Fergus founded the priory of St Mary's Isle, the fantastical {{foundation}} claims preserved by this source are not corroborated by contemporary sources. According to a confirmation charter dating to within the decade after Fergus' death, Fergus granted {{the house to}} the abbey of Holyrood. A confirmation charter of William I, King of Scotland (died 1214) reveals that the priory of St Mary's Isle may have been in existence by the time of Fergus's grandson, Roland fitz Uhtred, Lord of Galloway (died 1200), although the first recorded prior appears in the thirteenth century. Fergus' supposed links with this house, therefore, are dubious. Although Walter Bower declared that Fergus was responsible for the foundation of the abbey of Tongland, his great-grandson, Alan fitz Roland, Lord of Galloway (died 1234), appears to have founded it in the thirteenth century. The erroneous attribution of Fergus <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>house</b> {{may be the result of}} an attempt to enhance the antiquity of its establishment by linking it with the progenitor of Alan's family.|$|E
25|$|Rodgers' {{home town}} of Havre de Grace was {{directly}} affected by the war. In 1813, during his third cruise of the war, British marines led by the infamous Admiral George Cockburn plundered and burned his home, with its valuables stolen or destroyed in the fire. Rodgers' mother, wife, and two sisters were forced to flee to a friend's house {{not far from the}} village. In little time the British made their way <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>house</b> also with orders to destroy it and all such dwellings in the area. Rodgers' sister, Mrs. Goldsborough, pleaded with the officer in charge of the detail, begging him to forego the destruction of their haven for the sake of their aging mother. The officer maintained that he was under strict orders and would have to obtain the consent of his commanding officer, whereupon Mrs. Goldsborough returned with the officer to again plead her case. The commanding officer agreed to spare the house, but by the time they had returned it had already been set ablaze. However, the fire had not yet taken hold and upon hearing the news that the house was to be spared the British marines through frantic efforts were able to put out the flames in time and save the house from complete ruin.|$|E

2500|$|Emma and {{her family}} lived with {{friendly}} non-Mormons John and Sarah Cleveland in Quincy, Illinois, until Joseph escaped custody in Missouri. The family {{moved to a new}} Latter Day Saint settlement in Illinois which Joseph named [...] "Nauvoo." [...] On May 9, 1839, they moved into a two-storey log house there which they called the [...] "Homestead." [...] A year later, on June 13, 1840, Emma gave birth to a son, Don Carlos Smith, named after his uncle, Joseph's brother. Both Don Carlos Smiths would die the next year. The Smiths lived in the homestead until 1843, when a much larger house, known as the [...] "Mansion House" [...] was built across the street. A wing (no longer extant) was added <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>house,</b> which Emma operated as a hotel.|$|E
2500|$|The Leon Trotsky Museum {{is located}} near the Frida Kahlo Museum. Trotsky was forced into exile in 1929 by Josef Stalin and in 1937, due to efforts by Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo, he was granted asylum in Mexico. At first, Trotsky and his wife lived in the La Casa Azul with Frida, but after a falling out with Diego Rivera, the couple moved <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>house</b> on Viena Street in 1938. [...] The house looks like a fortress, and it was {{fortified}} to protect Trotsky from assassins. It has high outer walls and watchtowers once occupied by armed guards. Inside, {{there is a small}} house and garden. The house and garden were original with the defenses added later after an attack led by David Alfaro Siqueiros, who shot up the house. Trotsky and his wife survived by hiding under furniture. The bullet holes from this attack remain on the outer walls of the house.|$|E
2500|$|According to Gruff Rhys, Guerrillas {{lyrics are}} largely [...] "self-consciously disposable, happy". [...] "The Door <b>to</b> <b>This</b> <b>House</b> Remains Open" [...] is about [...] "starting {{a new chapter}} of your life". Rhys has said that his lyrics, which suggest that people should leave their doors open to others and that {{international}} borders should be open to allow immigration, are so optimistic that he is almost embarrassed by them. In contrast [...] "Some Things Come From Nothing" [...] features pessimistic lyrics inspired {{by the idea that}} [...] "nothing seems to have any substance any more". [...] "The Teacher" [...] was written by Rhys from a teacher's perspective and was inspired by guitarist Huw Bunford, who was an art teacher before the Super Furry Animals became successful. Although Rhys has stated that [...] "Fire in My Heart" [...] features the most clichéd lyrics he has ever written, he has also said that he wrote it with complete sincerity. The track is [...] "soul advice" [...] and is about the many different people in our lives.|$|E

2500|$|... "The Door <b>to</b> <b>This</b> <b>House</b> Remains Open" [...] is a {{drum and}} bass song {{that has been}} likened {{to the music of}} Boards of Canada by Yahoo! Music, while [...] "Some Things Come From Nothing" [...] is a post-punk dub track that was called [...] "the closest a rock band will come to the cracked {{ambience}} of Aphex Twin" [...] by the NME. [...] "Fire in My Heart" [...] has been described by Rhys as a country and western song, while Mojo has called it [...] "trad-sounding" [...] folk music. The Melody Maker called the album's closer [...] "Keep the Cosmic Trigger Happy" [...] "psych pop" [...] and likened [...] "Chewing Chewing Gum" [...] to the second side of Roxy Music's debut album. [...] "Night Vision" [...] is the [...] "most aggressive-sounding" [...] song on the album according to Rhys. The track has been called garage rock by the Melody Maker and punk rock by both Allmusic and Yahoo! Music, with the latter comparing the song to [...] "She's Lost Control" [...] by Joy Division. First single [...] "Northern Lites" [...] is a calypso-inspired track. Critics have commented on the song's use of [...] "Tijuana brass", reminiscent of the work of Herb Alpert, and likened the track to the music of Burt Bacharach and Hal David and the Beck single [...] "Deadweight".|$|E
2500|$|During recording, {{the band}} used a sampler {{for the first}} time and hired many {{different}} musical instruments. The group experimented with electronic sounds and wrote several of the album's tracks in the studio, allowing [...] "the music to dictate itself". The song [...] "Wherever I Lay My Phone (That's My Home)" [...] was written around the ringtone of a mobile phone with the rhythm track being based on a sample of bassist Guto Pryce tripping over a lead while Huw Bunford played a note on his guitar. [...] "Some Things Come from Nothing" [...] came from an acid house tune written by keyboardist Cian Ciaran. Samples of Rhys playing an out-of-tune acoustic guitar and Ciaran playing drums were mixed together and the song was [...] "written and recorded simultaneously" [...] by the group. [...] "The Sound of Life Today" [...] is a 22-second sample of [...] "Some Things Come From Nothing" [...] played backwards. According to Rhys the band gave the track a [...] "really pompous title" [...] so that listeners would expect to hear the meaning of life and instead get just a [...] "collection of noises". [...] "Do or Die", [...] "Fire in My Heart" [...] and [...] "Keep the Cosmic Trigger Happy" [...] were written by Rhys while [...] "The Door <b>to</b> <b>This</b> <b>House</b> Remains Open" [...] developed from a band jam of the Rod Stewart song [...] "Do Ya Think I'm Sexy?" [...] which completely changed over the 30 minutes the group played for. The melody for [...] "Northern Lites" [...] was written by Gruff Rhys several years before the track was released. Reggae and rock styles were tried by the band before they settled on calypso after Rhys wrote lyrics for the song and tried playing along to a preset calypso rhythm track which was on his keyboard. The band added steel drums to the track on the spur of the moment after seeing the instruments [...] "lying around" [...] Real World during recording. The steel drums parts were performed by keyboard player Ciaran, despite the fact he did not know how to play them.|$|E
