5|$|The Panhandles' opening {{game against}} the Dayton Triangles is {{considered}} to be the first football game between two APFA teams. The Panhandles lost 14–0 to the Triangles. Despite the first two quarters resulting in ties, the crowd was excited. In the second quarter, the Triangles made a goal line stand while the Panhandles had <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 3-yard line. Before halftime, the Triangles' Al Mahrt completed a 30-yard pass to Dutch Thiele, which resulted in the Triangles to having <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 5-yard line. The Triangles' did not score on that possession due to the clock running out.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{immediately}} after the equaliser United won another corner, again taken by Beckham. He landed <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> head of Sheringham who nodded it to Solskjær who in turn toe-poked it into {{the roof of the}} net. Oliver Kahn, the Bayern goalkeeper, was motionless on the line. United had completed the come-back. Bayern barely had time to restart the game, which referee Collina brought to a close just a few seconds later.|$|E
5|$|Brazilian striker Fred, who was {{replaced}} by Willian in the 70th minute, received a particularly hostile reaction from the home fans. According to Opta Sports, Fred failed to make a single tackle, cross, run or interception during the match, and actually spent {{the majority of his}} time in possession of <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> centre spot due to six restarts.|$|E

40|$|By {{means of}} Molecular Dynamics simulations, we {{investigate}} the elementary process of avalanches and size segregation by surface flow in 2 dimensions: a single ball confined to moving along an inclined line consisting of <b>balls.</b> <b>The</b> global {{characteristics of the}} motion depend strongly <b>on</b> <b>the</b> size of <b>the</b> moving <b>ball</b> relative to <b>the</b> size of <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> line, as well as <b>the</b> distribution of <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> line. We find that in the steady state the friction force acting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> is independent of material properties like the Coulomb friction coefficient and the coefficient of restitution. Contrary to previous notions {{about the details of}} the motion, we find that it is very regular and consists of many small bounces <b>on</b> each <b>ball</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> line. As a result of this regularity, introducing a random spacing between <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> line has mainly the same influence as a regular spacing of adequate length. The insensitivity of the steady state velocity to material properties and to the detailed arrangement of <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> line allows for an analytical estimation of the mean velocity which fits the simulation results very well. We find that results from the 2 D case can probably not be transferred to the 3 D case of a <b>ball</b> moving <b>on</b> a rough inclined plane as easily as has been suggested previously.

5|$|East Carolina {{took the}} kickoff on the 39–yard line, after a Boise player {{illegally}} touched <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 39. Pinkney threw an incomplete pass {{to start the}} drive, and after two more plays failed to convert the first down, ECU was forced to punt the ball away. After a touchback, Boise State began at its 20–yard line. The Broncos completed three plays for 11yards before the third quarter ended.|$|E

5|$|The {{position}} of the goalkeeper has existed since the game of water polo originated. At that time, {{the object of the}} game was to touch <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> opponent's end of the pool. The goalkeeper would wait {{at the end of the}} pool until an opposing player approached the goal, when the goalkeeper would try to stop that player, for example, by dunking their head.|$|E
50|$|Because players receive {{points for}} fouls by their {{opponent}}s, snookering one's opponent {{a number of}} times in a row is a possible way of winning a frame when potting all <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> table would be insufficient to ensure a win.|$|R

5|$|A minute later, West Ham {{went ahead}} again; defender Paul Konchesky {{received}} <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left flank, {{and played a}} ball into the Liverpool penalty area, only to see it sail over goalkeeper Reina and into the goal. Three minutes later, Liverpool made another substitution, as Alonso went off with an injury {{to be replaced by}} defender Jan Kromkamp. Minutes later, West Ham captain Nigel Reo-Coker had an attempt to score, but his shot went over the Liverpool goal. West Ham subsequently made their first substitution of the match, as Ashton was replaced by fellow striker Bobby Zamora. Liverpool also replaced Crouch with midfielder Dietmar Hamann.|$|E
5|$|As had Virginia Tech, Air Force {{began moving}} <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground. The Falcons were aided by two offsides {{penalties}} against the Hokies and drove into Tech territory. Once there, Weiss completed a 16-yard pass to Tom Coleman {{for a first}} down. Weiss picked up another first down by running the ball, pushing the Falcons inside the Tech red zone with 10:10 remaining. The Tech defense stiffened, forcing a fourth down at the two-yard line. Rather than kick a field goal, Fisher DeBerry elected to attempt the touchdown, and Mike Brown ran the needed twoyards. The score and following extra point gave Air Force a 177 lead with 6:00 remaining in the game.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} {{previous}} five games, the absence of Adrian Peterson did not keep the Sooners from running <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground. Allen Patrick returned from missing {{the last two games}} with a sore ankle and put up 163yards on 23carries, including a 65-yard touchdown scamper to start the second half. Chris Brown had an additional 19carries for 74yards and two touchdowns as Patrick's backup. At the end of the day, Paul Thompson only threw 11passes, 7completions for 77yards with one touchdown and no interceptions, and Oklahoma had 238yards of rushing.|$|E

5|$|Both teams {{struggled}} {{to put a}} flowing move together in the opening exchanges, but it was United who had the better chances, both falling to Ronaldo. The first came in the seventhminute: having been played the ball by Michael Carrick, Ronaldo turned away from Piqué {{on the edge of}} the centre circle, before hitting a shot just wide from almost 40yards; the second saw the ball break to Ronaldo after Anderson and Patrice Evra had linked up well down the left flank. The Portuguese winger controlled <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> chest before hitting the ball just past the far post.|$|E
5|$|In South Carolina's {{first trip}} to Bryant–Denny since 2004, the Tide {{defeated}} the South Carolina Gamecocks 20–6 on homecoming in Tuscaloosa. On the second play {{from the start of}} the game, Mark Barron intercepted a Stephen Garcia pass and returned it 77 yards for a touchdown and a 7–0 Alabama lead. Greg McElroy struggled; he threw a pair of first-quarter interceptions on Bama's first two offensive possessions. South Carolina's C.C. Whitlock fumbled <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> return of the second interception and possession was recovered by Darius Hanks. The Tide continued its drive to the Gamecock 8, and Leigh Tiffin kicked a field goal to put Alabama ahead 10–0.|$|E
5|$|In {{the sixth}} week of play, Vanderbilt beat the Alabama Crimson Tide 14–0 in Birmingham. The score {{reflected}} predictions, since the Commodores were favored by two touchdowns. Jess Neely {{played a role}} in each scoring drive. Early in the first quarter, Vanderbilt had the ball {{in the middle of the}} field after an Alabama punt. Two line bucks preceded Neely, who connected with Tot McCullough for a 30-yard pass play. Neely ran for an additional 17 yards, putting <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> nine-yard line. After a run by Godchaux, Lynn Bomar bucked over the line for the touchdown.|$|E

5|$|Manchester United {{fashioned}} {{the first}} chance {{of the second half}} after just three minutes, when Rooney cut inside from the right along the face of the penalty area, but his left-footed shot was blocked away for a corner kick. Soon after, Van Nistelrooy received <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> edge of the penalty area and held it up before playing a through-ball to Keane, but the Irishman's low cross was diverted behind by Kolo Touré before it reached Rooney. United then had their third chance in the space of five minutes when Ronaldo shot just wide from 25 yards, from the left corner of the penalty area.|$|E
5|$|The first score {{came after}} Rip Reeves {{recovered}} a Georgia fumble at the 30-yard line. On the second play after this, Red Bethea ran off left tackle for a touchdown. Goof Bowyer missed the extra point. By {{the second quarter}} Georgia had failed to consistently move <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground against Florida's line and tried to pass. Bulldogs' quarterback H. F. Johnson completed a 10-yard pass to back Frank Dudley, who ran 30 additional yards for a touchdown. Johnson missed the extra point and the score was tied. A 16-yard touchdown run by Florida's Clyde Crabtree, starting around right end, then reversing field, broke the tie. Carl Brumbaugh converted the extra point.|$|E
5|$|After Navy forced North Texas {{to begin}} the second quarter with a punt, Midshipmen running back Eric Kettani fumbled <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> second play of the next drive and the Mean Green recovered. The next eight {{possessions}} – four from each team – resulted in touchdowns. Four of the drives took {{less than a minute}} of game time to reach the end zone, and a fifth took barely over a minute. In the final two minutes of the half the Midshipmen forced the Mean Green to punt after three plays, and Navy quarterback Kaipo-Noa Kaheaku-Enhada threw a 47-yard pass to running back Reggie Campbell. The Midshipmen ran for another touchdown on the next play. North Texas got the ball back with seven seconds left in the half, but chose not to attempt to score again. At {{the end of the first}} half, the Mean Green led the Midshipmen 49–45.|$|E

5|$|After another Falcon punt, the Hokies {{took over}} on offense at their 49-yard line with 4:12 {{remaining}} before halftime. Tech began advancing the ball, and was {{aided by a}} 15-yard penalty against Air Force that pushed the Hokies deep into Falcons territory. Running backs Kevin Jones and Lee Suggs advanced <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground with short rushes, and Randall contributed short passes at times, gaining needed first downs when required. Tech advanced the ball inside the Air Force 10-yard line, gaining a first down at the nine-yard line. There, the Air Force defense stiffened. Tech gained four yards on three plays, {{but was unable to}} cross the goal line for another touchdown. Tech kicker Warley entered the game to attempt his second field goal try of the game. The 23-yard kick was more successful than his first try, and with 25seconds remaining in the first half, tied the game at 10–10.|$|E
5|$|After {{holding the}} Volunteers to a three-and-out {{to open the}} second half, the Alabama {{offensive}} responded with their first of three third-quarter touchdowns with a two-yard AJ McCarron touchdown run. On the following Tennessee drive, the Alabama defense stopped quarterback Matt Simms on a fourth-and-one to give the Crimson Tide offense <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Volunteers' 39-yard line. On the next play, McCarron threw a 39-yard touchdown pass to Kenny Bell to extend the Alabama lead to 20–6. Trent Richardson then scored his first touchdown of the game on the following Alabama possession on a 12-yard run to cap a six-play, 63-yard drive. Cade Foster scored {{early in the fourth}} quarter with his 45-yard field goal, and after a Dont'a Hightower interception, Richardson scored his second touchdown of the day on a one-yard run to make the final score 37–6.|$|E
5|$|Already {{frequently}} {{compared to}} compatriot Diego Maradona, Messi proved their similarity when he nearly replicated Maradona's two most famous {{goals in the}} span of three weeks. During a Copa del Rey semi-final against Getafe on 18 April, he scored a goal remarkably similar to Maradona's goal in the quarter-finals of the 1986 FIFA World Cup, known as the Goal of the Century. Messi collected <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right side near the halfway line, ran , and beat five defenders before scoring with an angled finish, just as Maradona had done. A league match against Espanyol on 9 June saw him score by launching himself at the ball and guiding it past the goalkeeper with his hand in similar fashion to Maradona's Hand of God goal in the same World Cup match. As Messi continued his individual rise, Barcelona faltered; the team failed to reach the Copa del Rey final after Messi was rested during the second leg against Getafe and lost the league to Real Madrid on head-to-head results.|$|E
