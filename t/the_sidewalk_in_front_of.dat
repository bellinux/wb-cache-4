5|$|Sarria {{was honored}} in 2005 with the San Francisco LGBT Pride Celebration Committee's Lifetime Achievement Grand Marshal Award. On May 25, 2006, Sarria's {{lifetime}} of activism was commemorated {{when the city}} of San Francisco renamed a section of 16th Street in the Castro to José Sarria Court.

5|$|When Milk's friends {{looked in}} his closet for a suit for his casket, they learned how much he had been {{affected}} by the recent decrease in his income as a supervisor. All of his clothes were coming apart; all of his socks had holes. He was cremated and his ashes were split, most of them scattered in San Francisco Bay by his closest friends. Some of them were encapsulated and buried beneath <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> 575 Castro Street, where Castro Camera had been located. There is a memorial to Milk also at Neptune Society Columbarium, ground floor, San Francisco, California. Harry Britt, one of four people Milk listed on his tape as an acceptable replacement should he be assassinated, was chosen to fill that position by the city's acting mayor, Dianne Feinstein.|$|E

50|$|Some laws {{prohibit}} bicycle {{riding in}} commercial areas, such as on <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of stores. <b>In</b> other places a sign erected {{by a government}} must be followed, such as with no-riding zones in a college campus.|$|R

25|$|Half of Flint's {{fourteen}} tallest {{buildings were}} built during the 1920s. The 19-story Genesee Towers, formerly the city's tallest building, {{was completed in}} 1968. The building became unused in later years and fell into severe disrepair: a cautionary sign warning of falling debris was put on <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> it. An investment company purchased the building for $1, and it was demolished (by implosion) on December 22, 2013.|$|E
25|$|The narrow axis of {{the plan}} faces {{the street to the}} east, and the main {{entrance}} lies midway along the long side of the plan. The use of hip roofs includes a very large cantilevered hip roof over the living room terrace. The pitch of the main hip roof is shallow enough to give the passer-by on <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the house the impression that it is a flat roof.|$|E
25|$|Through the {{combined}} efforts of two Phoenix philanthropists, Walter Bimson and Lewis Ruskin, Waddell received a commission in 1970 {{to create a}} major work for downtown Phoenix. When completed in 1974, Dance consisted of eleven life-sized figures in various dance positions and another figure playing the flute. Although the piece has been moved from its original location in the Phoenix Civic Plaza to <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the Herberger Theater, it remains Waddell’s tour de force in his adopted home of Arizona.|$|E
50|$|At first {{pedestrians}} climbed ladders to go between {{street level}} and <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of <b>the</b> building entrances.

25|$|On March 6, 1978, {{during a}} legal battle related to {{obscenity}} in Gwinnett County, Georgia, Flynt and his local lawyer, Gene Reeves Jr., were returning to the courthouse when they were shot on <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> 136 South Perry Street in Lawrenceville by a sniper standing near an alley across the street. The shooting left Flynt partially paralyzed with permanent spinal cord damage, {{and in need of}} a wheelchair.

He also suffered a stroke caused by one of several overdoses of his analgesic medications. He recovered but has had pronunciation difficulties since.|$|E

500|$|In July 1937, the Williams and McNeil {{families}} {{opened a}} boarding house on South Perry Street in downtown Montgomery. It {{was at this}} time that Williams decided to change his name informally from Hiram to Hank, a name he said was better suited to his desired career in country music. During the same year he participated in a talent show at the Empire Theater. He won the first prize of $15, singing his first original song [...] "WPA Blues". Williams wrote the lyrics and used the tune of Riley Puckett's [...] "Dissatisfied." [...] He never learned to read music and, {{for the rest of his}} career, based his compositions in storytelling. After school and on weekends Williams sang and played his Silvertone guitar on <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the WSFA radio studios. His recent win at the Empire Theater and the street performances caught the attention of WSFA producers who occasionally invited him to perform on air. So many listeners contacted the radio station asking for more of [...] "the singing kid" [...] that the producers hired him to host his own 15-minute show twice a week for a weekly salary of US$15 (equivalent to US$0 in [...] ).|$|E

2500|$|When first {{opening the}} store, Stewart placed cases full of {{merchandise}} along <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the store {{as a way}} of advertising his establishment.

2500|$|Musician Jack Kelson {{recalled}} <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the Dunbar as {{the most}} desirable place to hang out on the city's coolest street. He said, [...] "That's my favorite spot on Central Avenue, that spot {{in the front of}} the Dunbar Hotel, because that to me was the hippest, most intimate, key spot of all the activity. [...] That's where all the night people hung out: the sportsmen, the businessmen, the dancers, everybody in show business, people who were somebody stayed at the hotel. … y far that block, that Dunbar Hotel, for me was it. [...] And it was it for, it seemed to me, everybody else. [...] Sooner or later you walked in front of that hotel, and that's where everybody congregated." ...|$|E
2500|$|From {{even its}} early days, {{students}} were {{no stranger to}} protest. [...] In May 1913, in retaliation for what students claimed were [...] "harsh methods", an effigy of the principal, J.E. Witmer, was hung from the telegraph wires {{in front of the}} school. [...] After the principal removed the effigy in the early evening, another was hung from the flagpole on top of the school. [...] When signs were found painted on <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the school the next day, the local marshal took every male in the senior class into custody, ordering them to remove the signs under threat of arrest. [...] The next year, 110 students walked out on strike when the principal refused to grant a holiday for Columbus Day.|$|E
5000|$|By March 1908 {{the town}} had decreed that all streets in Aliceville should have ten foot {{sidewalks}} built on both sides. [...] Property owners were {{to be responsible for}} building <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of their parcels.

2500|$|Many federal {{offices in}} {{downtown}} Washington had closed early {{that day in}} response to quickly developing blizzard conditions. Thus, there was a massive backup of traffic on {{almost all of the}} city's roads, making it very difficult for ambulances to reach the crash site. The Coast Guard's [...] harbor tugboat Capstan (WYTL 65601) [...] and its crew were based nearby; their duties include icebreaking and responding to water rescues. [...] The Capstan was considerably farther downriver on another search-and-rescue mission. Emergency ground response was greatly hampered by ice-covered roads and gridlocked traffic. Ambulances attempting to reach the scene were even driven down <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the White House. Rescuers who reached the site were unable to assist survivors in the water because they did not have adequate equipment to reach them. Below-freezing waters and heavy ice made swimming out to them impossible. [...] Multiple attempts to throw a makeshift lifeline (made out of belts and any other things available that could be tied together) out to the survivors proved ineffective. The rescue attempts by emergency officials and witnesses were recorded and broadcast live by area news reporters, and as the accident occurred in the nation's capital, there were large numbers of media personnel on hand to provide quick and extensive coverage.|$|E
