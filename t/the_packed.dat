5|$|After 170 {{minutes of}} slow batting, Edrich gloved a rising Lindwall {{delivery}} and was caught behind by wicket-keeper Don Tallon. At 119/5, Compton {{returned to the}} field, his head wound having been stitched to stop the bleeding. He and Yardley played carefully until the tea break, and only the England captain offered a chance; Barnes was unable to complete the reflex catch at short leg from the bowling of Toshack. After the resumption of play, Yardley on-drove Lindwall for a four, but lofted Ernie Toshack, who had been bowling leg theory, into <b>the</b> <b>packed</b> on-side where he was caught by Johnson at forward square leg. Toshack's defensive bowling had caused the English skipper to lose patience and his departure for 22 left the score on 141/6.|$|E

It splits from the Ring Line south of Sinsen, and run part in tunnel and part at-grade until it {{connects to the}} Grorud Line west of Økern. In the tunnel section the new station, Løren, was built. The day section runs parallel to part of the mainline Alnabru–Grefsen Line.

5|$|Seine had a rapid passage back to European waters, {{arriving}} in the Bay of Biscay on 28 June. Early the following morning, with the Brittany coast in sight, Seine was spotted by the inshore frigate squadron of HMS Jason, HMS Pique and HMS Mermaid. While Mermaid cut Seine off from the coast, Jason and Pique gave chase as Seine fled southwards. Pique reached Seine at 23:00 that evening and {{for more than two}} and a half hours the frigates pounded at one another until Pique fell back. Pique and Jason continued the chase full speed through the night, until suddenly all three frigates crashed headlong into the sandbanks off La Tranche-sur-Mer on the Vendée coast. Even while grounded the frigates continued to fire on one another until Mermaid finally arrived and the outnumbered Seine surrendered. Jason and Seine were badly damaged but successfully refloated, the casualties on <b>the</b> <b>packed</b> decks of the French ship appallingly high, but Pique was an irretrievable wreck: the ship was evacuated and then burnt before the remainder of the squadron returned to Britain with their prize.|$|E

25|$|Another {{factor in}} {{addition}} to the packing shape and surface area that affects the performance of random or structured packing is the liquid and vapor distribution entering <b>the</b> <b>packed</b> bed. The number of theoretical stages required to make a given separation is calculated using a specific vapor to liquid ratio. If the liquid and vapor are not evenly distributed across the superficial tower area as it enters <b>the</b> <b>packed</b> bed, the liquid to vapor ratio will not be correct in <b>the</b> <b>packed</b> bed and the required separation will not be achieved. The packing will appear to not be working properly. The height equivalent to a theoretical plate (HETP) will be greater than expected. The problem is not the packing itself but the mal-distribution of the fluids entering <b>the</b> <b>packed</b> bed. Liquid mal-distribution is more frequently the problem than vapor. The design of the liquid distributors used to introduce the feed and reflux to a packed bed is critical to making the packing perform to it maximum efficiency. Methods of evaluating the effectiveness of a liquid distributor to evenly distribute the liquid entering a packed bed can be found in references. Considerable work as been done on this topic by Fractionation Research, Inc. (commonly known as FRI).|$|E

40|$|An {{application}} of statistic techniques for structure evaluation of packing of equal or distributed spherical particles is presented. <b>The</b> <b>packing</b> of particles generated by computer simulation is cut {{by a series}} of equally separated parallel planes, and the area densities of the cross-sections of particles on the cutting planes are used to analyse <b>the</b> <b>packing</b> structure. It is shown that as the number of the cutting planes increases, the mean of the area densities approaches <b>the</b> <b>packing</b> density. Then a time series analysis technique is applied to examine the randomness of <b>the</b> <b>packing.</b> <b>The</b> homogeneity of <b>the</b> <b>packing</b> is evaluated by testing the hypothesis that the particles are uniformly distributed within <b>the</b> <b>packing</b> space. <b>The</b> isotropy of <b>the</b> <b>packing</b> is evaluated both at micro-level, the distribution of projections of centre-to-centre lines between touching particles, and at macro-level, the variances of area densities on the cutting planes perpendicular to different directions. As case studies, the above techniques are applied to evaluate <b>the</b> <b>packing</b> structures of both equal and distributed particles obtained by a collective rearrangement simulation model...|$|R

40|$|All codified {{methods for}} {{measuring}} <b>the</b> <b>packing</b> density of aggregate {{are carried out}} under dry condition. However, these dry packing methods do {{not account for the}} effect of water in the concrete mix. In a previous study, a wet packing method for measuring <b>the</b> <b>packing</b> density of fine aggregate under wet condition has been developed and it was found that <b>the</b> <b>packing</b> density of fine aggregate can be substantially higher under wet condition than dry condition. Nevertheless, many researchers still believe that for coarse aggregate, it does not matter much whether <b>the</b> <b>packing</b> density is measured under dry or wet condition. In this study, <b>the</b> wet <b>packing</b> method was extended to measure <b>the</b> <b>packing</b> density of coarse aggregate and blended fine and coarse aggregate. The results revealed that whilst <b>the</b> <b>packing</b> density of coarse aggregate is only slightly higher under wet condition than dry condition, <b>the</b> <b>packing</b> density of blended fine and coarse aggregate is highly dependent on whether the aggregate is dry or wet. Hence, when measuring <b>the</b> <b>packing</b> density of blended aggregate, <b>the</b> wet <b>packing</b> method should always be used. © RILEM 2011. published_or_final_versionSpringer Open Choice, 25 May 201...|$|R
