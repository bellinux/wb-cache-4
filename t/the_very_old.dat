5|$|The {{common cold}} is {{generally}} mild and self-limiting with most symptoms generally improving in a week. Half of cases go away in 10days and 90% in 15days. Severe complications, if they occur, are usually in <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>old,</b> the very young, {{or those who}} are immunosuppressed. Secondary bacterial infections may occur resulting in sinusitis, pharyngitis, or an ear infection. It is estimated that sinusitis occurs in 8% and ear infection in 30% of cases.|$|E
5|$|A {{urinary tract}} {{infection}} (UTI) is an infection that affects part of the urinary tract. When it affects the lower urinary tract it {{is known as a}} bladder infection (cystitis) and when it affects the upper urinary tract it is known as kidney infection (pyelonephritis). Symptoms from a lower urinary tract include pain with urination, frequent urination, and feeling the need to urinate despite having an empty bladder. Symptoms of a kidney infection include fever and flank pain usually in addition to the symptoms of a lower UTI. Rarely the urine may appear bloody. In <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>old</b> and the very young, symptoms may be vague or non-specific.|$|E
5|$|An unusual {{feature of}} this {{pandemic}} was that it mostly killed young adults. In 1918–1919, 99% of pandemic influenza deaths in the U.S. occurred in people under 65, and nearly half in young adults 20 to 40years old. In 1920, the mortality rate among people under 65 had decreased sixfold to half the mortality rate of people over 65, but still 92% of deaths occurred in people under 65. This is noteworthy, since influenza is normally most deadly to weak individuals, such as infants (under age two), <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>old</b> (over age 70), and the immunocompromised. In 1918, older adults may have had partial protection caused by exposure to the 1889–1890 flu pandemic, known as the Russian flu.|$|E

5|$|In Africa, the HIV/AIDS {{pandemic}} {{has been}} the major cause of falling life expectancy. There is currently a crisis of decreasing number of available care workers for an increasing population requiring care. One reason why this phenomenon occurs is because HIV/AIDS affects working age people the most, {{and there has been}} evidence to show that women are affected at a younger age and in greater numbers. Another reason is due to the influx of HIV/AIDS, government-led health policies are breaking down, increasing the amount of care work and community work that women have to do. Because of the lack of care workers available, the very young and <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>old</b> have also started participating in care work, resulting in poorer quality of care.|$|E
25|$|But {{the other}} {{dream of the}} Stelo {{retaining}} a constant value was almost forgotten except among <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>old</b> Universal League members. The League fell quiet and scarcely did anything, though still publishing the illustrated magazine La Praktiko. The new subtitle was A journal for citizens of the world; previously it had been A journal for instruction and recreation. Publication of the periodical stopped only in 1970, when Andreo Cseh, who had been editor since 1946, had to retire due to weak health.

25|$|Significant dog bites affect tens of {{millions}} of people globally each year. It is estimated that 1.5 - 2 percent of the US population, from 4.5–4.7 million people, are bitten by dogs yearly. Pit bulls bit and killed 21 people during the 1980s. Most bites occur in children. In the 1980s and 1990s the US averaged 17 fatalities per year, while in the 2000s this has increased to 26. 77% of dog bites are from the pet of family or friends, and 50% of attacks occur on the dog owner's property. Animal bites, most of which are from dogs, are the reason for 1% of visits to an emergency department in the United States. Young children are sustain bites by familiar or family dogs during normal activities. Some people, like the very young or <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>old</b> are more susceptible to being bitten by a dog.|$|E
500|$|Pneumonia affects {{approximately}} 450million people globally (7% of the population) {{and results}} in about 4million deaths per year. Pneumonia was regarded by William Osler in the 19th century as [...] "the captain of the men of death". With the introduction of antibiotics and vaccines in the 20th century, survival improved. Nevertheless, in developing countries, and among <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>old,</b> the very young, and the chronically ill, pneumonia remains {{a leading cause of}} death. Pneumonia often shortens suffering among those already close to death and has thus been called [...] "the old man's friend".|$|E
500|$|The word ski {{comes from}} the Old Norse word [...] "skíð" [...] which means stick of wood. Skiing started as a {{technique}} for traveling cross-country over snow on skis, starting almost five millennia ago with beginnings in Scandinavia. It may have been practised as early as 600 BCE in Daxing'anling, {{in what is now}} China. Early historical evidence includes Procopius' (around CE 550) description of Sami people as skrithiphinoi translated as [...] "ski running samis". Birkely argues that the Sami people have practiced skiing for more than 6000 years, evidenced by <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>old</b> Sami word čuoigat for skiing. Egil Skallagrimsson's 950 CE saga describes King Haakon the Good's practice of sending his tax collectors out on skis. The Gulating law (1274) stated that [...] "No moose shall be disturbed by skiers on private land." [...] Cross-country skiing evolved from a utilitarian means of transportation to being a worldwide recreational activity and sport, which branched out into other forms of skiing starting in the mid-1800s.|$|E

2500|$|Therefore, {{rather than}} lumping {{together}} {{all people who}} have been defined as old, some gerontologists have recognized the diversity of old age by defining sub-groups.

Another study's sub-grouping is young-old (65 to 74), middle-old (75–84), and oldest-old (85+). A third sub-grouping is [...] "young old" [...] (65–74), [...] "old" [...] (74–84), and [...] "old-old" [...] (85+). Delineating sub-groups in the 65+ population enables a more accurate portrayal of significant life changes.|$|E
2500|$|Like most Australian Acacia species, mulga is thornless. [...] The {{needle-like}} phyllodes stand erect {{to avoid}} {{as much of}} the midday sun as possible and capture the cooler morning and evening light. Any rain that falls is channeled down the phyllodes and branches to be collected in the soil immediately next to the trunk, providing the tree with a more than threefold increase in effective rainfall. Mulga roots penetrate far into the soil to find deep moisture. The roots also harbour bacteria that fix atmospheric nitrogen and thus help deal with <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>old,</b> nutrient-poor soils in which the species grows.|$|E
