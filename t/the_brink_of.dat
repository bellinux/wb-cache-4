The Great Depression pushed the company to <b>the</b> <b>brink</b> <b>of</b> bankruptcy, and the Price Family lost both control of the company and most of its fortune. Various restoration work was undertaken during the 1950s and '60s, mostly to the interior of the building.|$|E

On the 2007 advisory list of threatened vertebrate fauna in Victoria, this species is listed as near threatened.|$|E

Khrushchev had become an international embarrassment when he authorized construction of the Berlin Wall, a public humiliation for Marxism–Leninism.|$|E

Meanwhile, the Allied supply system grappled with the problems of terrain and climate, particularly inclement weather and rough monsoonal seas that hampered and occasionally prevented delivery of supplies by sea.|$|E
