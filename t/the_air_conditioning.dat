5|$|Michael (Steve Carell) and Dwight (Rainn Wilson) {{have been}} having secret {{meetings}} in the parking lot, where Dwight provides information about Dunder Mifflin so Michael can undercut the company.

Dwight brings Charles to the parking lot during one of the secret meetings, where Charles orders Michael to stop pestering Dwight. This begins a rivalry between Michael and Dwight, and Michael begins to steal Dwight's clients. Dwight asks for a truce and offers to take Michael and his employees out to lunch; Dwight does not go to the restaurant and instead sneaks into the empty Michael Scott Paper Company office and steals everything on Michael's desk, including his Rolodex contact list, and places a dead fish in <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> vent.|$|E

Using flow fields and parameters that are generated by computational fluid dynamics (CFD), the indoor thermal comfort when adopting <b>the</b> full <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> and <b>the</b> stratified <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> designs can be effectively analyzed.

5|$|Owing to air {{compression}} {{in front of}} the plane as it travelled at supersonic speed, the fuselage heated up and expanded by as much as 300mm (almost 1ft). The most obvious manifestation of this was a gap that opened up on the flight deck between the flight engineer's console and the bulkhead. On some aircraft that conducted a retiring supersonic flight, the flight engineers placed their caps in this expanded gap, wedging the cap when it shrank again. To keep the cabin cool, Concorde used the fuel as a heat sink for the heat from <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>conditioning.</b> The same method also cooled the hydraulics. During supersonic flight the surfaces forward from the cockpit became heated, and a visor was used to deflect much of this heat from directly reaching the cockpit.|$|E
5|$|Previously, the Sistine Chapel's only {{ventilation}} {{was from}} its {{windows in the}} upper level of the walls. To prevent exhaust fumes and wind-blown pollutants from entering, the windows are now permanently closed and an air conditioning system has been installed. The installation is by Carrier of the United Technologies Corporation and was developed {{with the cooperation of}} the Vatican's Office of Technical Services. It has been designed to counteract the various problems specific to the Chapel, in particular the rapid changes of heat and humidity that occur with the admission of the first crowds of tourists each morning and the departure of the last visitors each afternoon. <b>The</b> <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> varies not only the heat but also the relative humidity between the summer and winter months so that changes to the atmospheric environment occur gradually. The air near the ceiling is kept at a temperate level, while the air in the lower section of the building is cooler and circulates more rapidly, with the effect that dirt particles fall towards the floor rather than being streamed upwards. Bacteria and chemical pollutants are filtered out.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} control costs, Honda {{decided not to}} include the electric-assist air {{conditioning}} compressor used in the Civic Hybrid. The Civic Hybrid's electric-assist allows <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> compressor to continue running (using battery pack power) to maintain cabin temperature when the engine is shut off in Idle Stop mode. Instead, the Insight limits {{the duration of the}} Idle Stop mode during air conditioning use and restarts the engine, when needed, to maintain cabin temperature. However, when the Insight's ECON function is engaged, a longer Idle Stop time is invoked for improved fuel efficiency at the expense of rapid cabin cooling. In other words, <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> stops whenever the car stops, as in stop-and-go traffic. During Idle Stop the blower continues to run albeit at a low speed.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} paper, {{the effects of}} the {{indirect}} evaporative cooler with internal baffle on the performance of <b>the</b> hybrid <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> system are numerically investigated. <b>The</b> hybrid <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> system contains two indirect evaporative coolers with internal baffle, one is utilized to pre-cool <b>the</b> <b>air</b> inlet to <b>the</b> desiccant wheel and the other is utilized to pre-cool <b>the</b> supply <b>air</b> inlet to <b>the</b> room. The effects of the inlet conditions of the process and reactivation air and working <b>air</b> ratio on <b>the</b> thermal performance of <b>the</b> hybrid <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> system have been analyzed. The results of this study show that in <b>the</b> hybrid <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> system for using the indirect evaporative cooler with internal baffle as a pre-cooling unit, <b>the</b> supply <b>air</b> temperature reduced by 21 % and the coefficient of performance improved by 71 % as compared to previous designs of <b>the</b> hybrid <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> system at <b>the</b> same inlet conditions. For increasing process air inlet temperature from 25  °C to 45  °C, supply air temperature increases from 12. 7  °C to 14. 2  °C, thermal COP increases from 1. 87 to 2. 84, and supply air relative humidity increases from 76. 7 % to 77. 4 %.
