While the study demonstrates the theoretical validity and the empirical applicability of the TAM model to the context of CGM usage for <b>travel</b> <b>planning,</b> it goes further to verify the significant roles of distinctive factors like travelers' perceptions of similarity of interest, trustworthiness and enjoyment.
