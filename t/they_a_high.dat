40|$|The {{heliosphere}} {{is filled}} with supersonic solar wind that forms shocks wherever it encounters obstacles, be <b>they</b> <b>a</b> <b>high</b> speed Coronal Mass Ejection (CME), or regions where fastsolar wind encounters slower-moving solar wind. Energetic particles (> 10 s of keV/nuc to 10 s of MeV/nuc) associated with these shocks form a test bed for understanding particle acceleration since the shock properties can often be measured and energetic particle composition compared to candidate seed populations. Over the past 15 - 20 years a wide body of evidence has emerged showing that generally the seed population is the suprathermal ion pool at energies above the bulk solar wind. Understanding the interplanetary suprathermal ion population is therefore a critical step in fully understanding the physical mechanisms that accelerate particles in interplanetary space...|$|E
