5|$|Back at Kiamo Ko, Elphaba {{has already}} {{captured}} Dorothy, refusing to release {{her until she}} relinquishes Nessarose's slippers – the only things left of her dead sister. Glinda travels to Elphaba's castle to warn her of the danger and persuade her to let Dorothy go. Elphaba refuses until she suddenly receives a letter saying that Fiyero has died. The two women forgive each other for all grievances, acknowledging they have both made mistakes. To help her in her future, Elphaba gives the Grimmerie to Glinda. The two friends embrace {{for the last time}} before saying goodbye forever, and acknowledge that they are who they are because of each other ("For Good"). As the mob arrives at the castle, Elphaba tells Glinda to hide, and she watches from the shadows as Dorothy throws a bucket of water on Elphaba, who appears to melt away. Grief-stricken, Glinda sees <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> remains of her friend is her black hat and the small bottle of green elixir which she had slept with under her pillow.|$|E

25|$|Structuralism is a {{position}} holding that mathematical theories describe structures, and that mathematical objects are exhaustively defined by their places in such structures, consequently having no intrinsic properties.

Likewise all the other whole numbers are defined by their places in a structure, the number line.

25|$|Also {{known as}} the Gagikashen, this church was {{constructed}} between the years 1001 and 1005 and {{intended to be a}} recreation of the celebrated cathedral of Zvartnots at Vagharshapat. Nikolai Marr uncovered the foundations of this remarkable building in 1905 and 1906. Before <b>that,</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> was visible on the site was a huge earthen mound. The designer of the church was the architect Trdat. The church is known to have collapsed a relatively short time after its construction and houses were later constructed on top of its ruins. Trdat's design closely follows that of Zvartnotz in its size and in its plan (a quatrefoil core surrounded by a circular ambulatory).|$|E

25|$|Lopez dives {{into more}} detail about this conflict, {{focusing}} on the death and destruction that Sonnet 60 describes The second quatrain explains life's cycle, presenting the journey from birth to death and from sunrise to eclipse or sunset as ways to explicate the feeling of loss after having so much. It culminates in the pessimism <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> was ever had, has been or will be lost. He explains the third quatrain as the degradation of his fascination's beauty, that the weapons that time methodically uses to slowly strip what the speaker values is a crushing blow. The completeness of time's destruction is made clear as if man's beauty and goodness are created only for time to demolish.|$|E
25|$|While {{employed}} as {{assistant to the}} professor of the maternity clinic at the Vienna General Hospital in Austria in 1847, Semmelweis introduced hand washing with chlorinated lime solutions for interns who had performed autopsies. This immediately reduced the incidence of fatal puerperal fever from about 10% (range 5–30%) to about 1–2%. At the time, diseases were attributed to many different and unrelated causes. Each case was considered unique, just as a human person is unique. Semmelweis's hypothesis, {{that there was only}} one cause, <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> mattered was cleanliness, was extreme at the time, and was largely ignored, rejected, or ridiculed. He was dismissed from the hospital for political reasons and harassed by the medical community in Vienna, being eventually forced to move to Budapest.|$|E

The whole course of his reasoning proceeds on, and is pervaded by, the principle of final causes.|$|E

25|$|Six {{years of}} war service had never {{permitted}} the formal sea trials to take place so they were now finally undertaken. Under the command of Commodore Sir James Bisset the ship travelled to the Isle of Arran and her trials were carried out. On board was the ship's namesake, Queen Elizabeth, and her two daughters, Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret. During the trials, Queen Elizabeth took the wheel {{for a brief time}} and the two young princesses recorded the two measured runs with stopwatches that they had been given for the occasion. Bisset was under strict instructions from Sir Percy Bates, who was also aboard the trials, <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> was required from the ship was two measured runs of no more than thirty knots and that she was not permitted to attempt to attain a higher speed record than Queen Mary. Queen Elizabeths engines were capable of driving her to speeds of over 32 knots. After her trials Queen Elizabeth finally entered passenger service, allowing Cunard White Star to launch the long planned two ship weekly service to New York. Despite similar specifications to her older sister ship Queen Mary, Queen Elizabeth never held the Blue Riband, for Cunard White Star chairman Sir Percy Bates requested for the two ships not to try to compete against each other.|$|E

500|$|In the Advaita Vedanta of the 8th century Indian philosopher Śaṅkara, the mind, {{body and}} world are all {{held to be}} the same unchanging eternal {{conscious}} entity called Brahman. Advaita, which means non-dualism, holds the view <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> exists is pure absolute consciousness. The fact that the world seems to be made up of changing entities is an illusion, or Maya. The only thing that exists is Brahman, which is described as Satchitananda (Being, consciousness and bliss). Advaita Vedanta is best described by a verse which states [...] "Brahman is alone True, and this world of plurality is an error; the individual self is not different from Brahman".|$|E

500|$|Fair dealing is a defence {{after the}} fact. If sued for {{copyright}} infringement, one {{can rely on}} fair dealing as a defence in court, but the defence [...] "only comes into play once a claimant has established that copyright has been infringed. Where this occurs, the onus of proof [...] falls on the defendant to prove {{that one of the}} exceptions applies". This is done first by proving that the infringement falls within one of the three categories, which are liberally interpreted by the courts. The courts will not, however, give any consideration to what the infringer thought his work was for, or rely on a subjective test in any way; as in Hyde Park Residence v Yelland, it is not seen as necessary [...] "for the court to put itself in the shoes of the infringer of the copyright". Instead, a more objective test is used, to avoid providing [...] "any encouragement to the notion <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> is required is for the user to have a sincere belief, however misguided, {{that he or she is}} criticising a work or reporting current affairs".|$|E

500|$|After {{his death}} Sibelius, though {{remaining}} {{popular with the}} general public, was frequently denigrated by critics who found his music dated and tedious. René Leibowitz, a proponent of the music of Arnold Schoenberg, published a pamphlet describing Sibelius as [...] "the worst composer in the world"; others dismissed him as irrelevant in what was perceived for a time as an irresistible movement towards atonality. This climate diminished curiosity {{about the existence of}} material from a possible Sibelius Eighth, until late in the 20th century, when critical interest in the composer revived. In 1995 Kilpeläinen, who had published a survey of the Sibelius manuscripts held in the Helsinki University Library, wrote <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> could definitely be connected to the Eighth Symphony were a single page from a draft score and the ringed melody fragment marked [...] "VIII" [...] within the Seventh Symphony sketches. He added, however, that the library contained further Sibelius sketches from the late 1920s and early 1930s, some of which are akin to the ringed fragment and which could conceivably have been intended for the Eighth Symphony. Kilpeläinen also revealed that [...] "ust recently various documents have come to light which no one dreamt even existed. Maybe there are still some clues to the 8th Symphony hidden away and just waiting for some scholar to discover them." ...|$|E

John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode a moderately negative review and awarded it a 4 out of 10. He wrote, [...] "Overall, this episode felt more like a statement by the writer regarding animal rights than an episode of [...] The plot doesn’t seem to know which direction it wants to explore, and ultimately, elements of the episode contradict each other." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode two stars out of five. The two wrote that, despite the episode having [...] "rare anger" [...] and a [...] "genuine passion behind" [...] its conservation message, the entry was not [...] "a very good story". Shearman and Pearson called the plot [...] "so confusing <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> impact [...] soon dissipates." [...] The plot for [...] "Fearful Symmetry" [...] was also adapted as a novel for young adults in 1996 by Les Martin, under the title Tiger, Tiger.|$|E
500|$|Four {{different}} endings {{are available}} {{depending on whether}} Harry saves Cybil or discovers a bottle of Aglaophotis at Kaufmann's apartment, or both. Aglaophotis is a red liquid that is obtained from the refinement of a plant of the same name; it can dispel demonic forces and grant protection against such forces to those who use the item. The [...] "bad" [...] ending occurs if neither is done; Alessa electrocutes Dahlia and then attacks Harry, who ultimately defeats her. Cheryl's voice thanks Harry for freeing her and Alessa vanishes. Harry collapses, and the game cuts to his corpse in the crashed car - suggesting <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> happened in the game was a delusion of Harry's dying mind. The [...] "bad +" [...] ending finds Cybil alive and Kaufmann missing; after the echoing of Cheryl's voice and Alessa's disappearance, Cybil walks to Harry and convinces him to flee. The [...] "good" [...] ending finds Cybil dead, and Kaufmann shows up with the bottle of Aglaophotis which he then uses to force the deity out of Alessa; Kaufmann is revealed to have secretly allied with Dahlia and enabled Alessa's hospitalization. Feeling betrayed, he forces the deity out of Alessa, also causing her to vanish. After Harry defeats it, the deity disappears, and Alessa appears, who manifests a baby reincarnation of herself and Cheryl, gives it to Harry, enables their escape {{from the depths of}} [...] "nowhere" [...] and her nightmare, and then dies. In the [...] "good +" [...] ending, Harry escapes with Cybil and the baby. In both [...] "good" [...] endings, a transformed Lisa prevents Kaufmann from leaving and throws him into a pit.
