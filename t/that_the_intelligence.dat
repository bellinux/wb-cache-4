5|$|By September 1954, the PBHistory {{agents had}} only {{managed to find}} {{a small number of}} top secret {{documents}}. Some of the documents gathered showed that government officials and communist party leaders had been able to dispose of most of the sensitive material before they left. In the period of uncertain leadership that followed Árbenz's overthrow and preceded Castillo Armas' taking power, a member of one of the ruling juntas had prevented the Comité from searching the homes of private citizens, and from arresting them, which potentially reduced the number of sensitive documents the CIA had access to. Additionally, Castillo Armas stated after taking power <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>intelligence</b> information of the army had been completely destroyed.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of Australia around the former German colonies, {{combined with the}} likelihood of Japan declaring war on Germany, prompted von Spee to withdraw his ships from the region. On 13 August, the East Asia Squadron—with the exception of , which was sent to prey on British shipping in the Indian Ocean—had begun to move eastwards. After appearing off Samoa on 14 September, then attacking Tahiti eight days later, von Spee led his force to South America, and from there planned to sail for the Atlantic. Patey was ordered on 17 September to head back north with Australia and Sydney to protect the Australian expeditionary force. On 1 October, Australia, Sydney, Montcalm, and Encounter headed north from Rabaul to find the German ships, but turned around to return at midnight, after receiving an Admiralty message about the Tahiti attack. Although Patey suspected that the Germans were heading for South America and wanted to follow with Australia, the Admiralty was unsure <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>intelligence</b> was accurate, and tasked the battlecruiser with patrolling around Fiji in case they returned. Australia reached Suva on 12 October, {{and spent the next}} four weeks patrolling the waters around Fiji, Samoa, and New Caledonia: despite Patey's desires to range out further, Admiralty orders kept him chained to Suva until early November.|$|E

25|$|The Eurasian magpie is {{believed}} {{not only to}} be among the smartest of birds but among the most intelligent of all animals. Along with the jackdaw, the Eurasian magpie's nidopallium is approximately the same relative size as those in chimpanzees and humans, significantly larger than the gibbon's. Like other corvids, such as ravens and crows, their total brain-to-body mass ratio is equal to most great apes' and cetaceans'. A 2004 review suggests <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>intelligence</b> of the corvid family to which the Eurasian magpie belongs is equivalent to that of great apes (chimpanzees, orangutans, and gorillas) in terms of social cognition, causal reasoning, flexibility, imagination, and prospection.|$|E

An emergency meeting of Indian cabinet ministers was also held later during the day.

Although BT had notified the UK government in 2003 of Huawei's interest in their £10b network upgrade contract, they did not raise the security implications as BT failed to explain that the Chinese company would have unfettered access to critical infrastructure. On 16 December 2012 David Cameron was supplied with an in-depth report indicating <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>intelligence</b> services had very grave doubts regarding Huawei, and that the UK governmental, military, business community and private citizen's privacy may be under serious threat. Subsequently, BT's Infinity program and other projects are now under urgent review.|$|E

500|$|On November 1, the Department of Defense said {{it would}} examine whether the {{disinformation}} had caused wasteful spending. A November 17 report by journalist Walter Pincus indicated that the review panel, led by Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) Director Lt. Gen. Kenneth Minihan, had not found [...] "any policy or weapon purchase decision that 'in and of itself' was shaped by tainted Soviet intelligence". The claim that billions of dollars had been wasted on defense spending was deemed an overreaction. Former DIA chief Lt. Gen. James R. Clapper told the House Intelligence Committee <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>intelligence</b> affected no policy or weapons acquisition decisions, which was echoed by Haver.|$|E
500|$|In {{an effort}} to thwart MiG attacks, several F-105Fs were also fitted with Hallicrafters QRC-128 {{communication}} jamming system under project Combat Martin. The North Vietnamese interceptor force followed Soviet air-defense doctrine, with pilots under rigid direction of ground controllers over radio links. The QRC-128, nicknamed [...] "Colonel Computer", filled up the rear cockpit of the F-105F. It bounced voice communications over the radio channel back out after a delay, resulting in an obnoxious garble. However, {{the first time the}} Combat Martin was used, the US National Security Agency (NSA), in charge of US strategic signals intelligence, ordered the Air Force to cease and desist immediately, since the NSA believed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>intelligence</b> obtained by monitoring the channels outweighed the benefits of jamming them.|$|E
500|$|The book {{received}} mixed reviews; {{particularly with}} regards to Brown's focus on minutiae, which received {{both positive and negative}} comment. Later reviewers also criticised the factual basis of the work– describing it as containing [...] "a multitude of errors of detail"– with some reviewers rejecting Brown's analysis. One such error that Brown relates was a then-widely held theory that Churchill had known of German intentions to bomb Coventry in November 1940, but that the British leader had hidden the information to avoid giving up the secrets of Ultra (intercepted German communications). By 1976, declassified records showed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>intelligence</b> was in fact more vague than popular myth had suggested. Writing in 1996, reviewer Russell J. Bowen ascribes this to Brown's reliance on secondary sourcing and oral interviews (describing the book as an [...] "outstanding example of scholarly investigative journalism applied to the field of oral military history").|$|E

500|$|The {{discovery}} of the site's true purpose produced some recriminations in London, as – unlike the V-1 and V-2 projects – the V-3 had not been uncovered by Allied intelligence [...] before the war's end. The British scientist and military intelligence expert Reginald Victor Jones later commented that [...] "techniques {{that had been used}} against the flying bomb and the rocket appeared to have failed against HDP , and {{there had to be a}} reason. Basically it was that with our limited effort we had to concentrate on the most urgent problem, and thus on catching weapons not so much at the research stage (although we sometimes achieved this) as in the development stage – which usually meant when trials were showing promise." [...] He concluded at the time, in April 1945, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>intelligence</b> failure had not made much practical difference given the fact that the Germans had failed to develop the HDP into an effective weapon: [...] "there was little warning; [...] there was little danger." ...|$|E
500|$|Congressional {{committee}} members {{stated that the}} blend of genuine information and disinformation altered American perceptions of the USSR and possibly affected billions of dollars' worth of military acquisition decisions. Congress pointed to the multibillion-dollar F-22 fighter project as a possible result of inflated estimates on the USSR. Committee members charged that the CIA never warned the recipients of the suspicious intelligence because it sought to protect dubious sources; they cited {{a case in which}} a CIA officer forwarded 16 reports without mentioning that they were derived from a confirmed Soviet agent. In another case, questioned sources provided documents on a new Soviet anti-aircraft missile indicating it had a new capability, prompting costly American spending on aircraft radar. Senator Arlen Specter (R-Pa.), the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, called the revelation [...] "mind-boggling" [...] and sought a hearing with Webster, Gates, and Woolsey. However, Representative Larry Combest (R-Tex.), the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, stressed that [...] "nothing has been proven" [...] and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>intelligence</b> may not have been wholly spurious. Intelligence officials countered that Specter's claims of the reports' damage were exaggerated, saying that development and acquisition decisions would never be based solely on agent reporting.|$|E
