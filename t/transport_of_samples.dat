Primary hyperoxaluria type II (PH II) is caused by low or absent activity D-glycerate dehydrogenase and hydroxypyruvate reductase activity, leading to elevated urinary excretion of both oxalate and L-glyceric acid.

40|$|The {{diagnosis}} of bovine genital campylobacteriosis (BGC) presents significant challenges, as traditional methods lack sensitivity when prolonged <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> <b>samples</b> is required. Assays of preputial samples {{by means of}} real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) provide good sensitivity and high throughput capabilities. However, there is limited information on the acceptable duration of transport and temperature during <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> <b>samples.</b> In addition, the use of pooled samples {{has proven to be}} a valuable strategy for the {{diagnosis of}} other venereal diseases in cattle. The objectives of the present study were to determine the effect of sample pooling and of transport time and temperature on the clinical sensitivity of a real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay for Campylobacter fetus subsp. venerealis in preputial samples from beef bulls. Eight infected bulls and 176 virgin yearling bulls were used as the source of samples. The qPCR sensitivity was comparable for unpooled samples and pools of 5 samples, whereas sensitivity was decreased for pools of 10 samples. Sensitivity for the various pool sizes improved with repeated sampling. For shorter-term transport (2 and 48 h), sensitivity was greatest when the samples were stored at 4 °C and 30 °C, whereas for longer-term transport (96 h) sensitivity was greatest when the samples were stored at − 20 °C. The creation of pools of 5 samples is therefore a good option to decrease costs when screening bulls for BGC with the qPCR assay of direct preputial samples. Ideally the samples should be stored at 4 °C and arrive at the laboratory within 48 h of collection, but when that is not possible freezing at − 20 °C could minimize the loss of sensitivity. © 2015, Brazilian Statistical Association.

40|$|Doctoral {{thesis is}} dealing with the methods for {{analysis}} of surfaces by photoelectrons being emitted by X-ray radiation. The methods are: X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy - XPS, Angle-resolved XPS - ARXPS and X-ray Photoelectron Diffraction - XPD. The work is especially focused on a method of ARXPS, which is used for the depth compositional analysis of sample surfaces. To obtain an information about the depth composition from the measured ARXPS spectra, a calculation software in the Matlab environment has been developed. The software has been tested both for simulated and real sample data. For an experimental implementation of these methods, a complete manipulation system has been developed.

40|$|AIM: To {{provide a}} more {{efficient}} method for isolating DNA from peripheral blood for use in diagnostic DNA mutation analysis. METHODS: The use of blood impregnated filter paper and Chelex- 100 in DNA isolation was evaluated and compared with standard DNA isolation techniques. RESULTS: In polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based assays of five point mutations, identical results were obtained with DNA isolated routinely from peripheral blood and isolated using the filter paper and Chelex- 100 method. CONCLUSION: In the clinical setting, this method provides a useful alternative to conventional DNA isolation. It is easily implemented and inexpensive, and provides sufficient, stable DNA for multiple assays. The potential for specimen contamination is reduced {{because most of the}} steps are performed in a single microcentrifuge tube.

False negative cases have rarely been reported. We describe a false negative case of trisomy 13 and another of trisomy 18 in which NIPT was commercially marketed directly to the clinician. Both cases came to our attention because a fetal anatomy scan at 20 weeks of gestation revealed multiple anomalies. Karyotyping of cultured amniocytes showed nonmosaic trisomies 13 and 18, respectively. Cytogenetic investigation of cytotrophoblast cells from multiple placental biopsies showed a low proportion of nontrisomic cells in each case, but this was considered too small for explaining the false negative NIPT result. The discordant results also could not be explained by early gestational age, elevated maternal weight, a vanishing twin, or suboptimal storage or <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> <b>samples.</b> The root cause of the discrepancies could, therefore, not be identified.

These countries generally face major problems regarding the transportation of samples from peripheral centers to central labs due to biosafety issues, long distances and high temperatures. These issues could diminish the overall impact of the Genexpert MTB/Rif technology in low income countries. Intervention or response : To facilitate the <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> <b>samples</b> from peripheral health centers to central GeneXpert-equipped labs (TB Reach funding), we validated a protocol of alcohol-based conservation of the samples and implemented it in the South-Kivu Province (DRC). Results and lessons learnt : Sputum conserved by a 1 / 1 dilution of 95 ° ethanol can be analyzed by Genexpert even after spending 48 h at 37 °C. The use of this protocol in the South-Kivu Province permitted a considerable increase in terms of efficiency of the Genexpert technology. Conclusions and key recommendations : A major problem faced by low-income countries is the transportation of samples due to long distances and high temperatures. Alcohol-based conservation of samples permits to overcome bio-hazard, time and bad conservation issues.

Electronic <b>transport</b> behaviours <b>of</b> rGO <b>samples</b> with coverages <b>of</b> 6.25, 12.5, 25 and 50  % are obtained together with the properties of intrinsic graphene sheet for comparison. It is exposed that depending on the coverage ratio, rGO structures show different and peculiar electronic transport characteristics such as (i) rGO with 6.25 and 12.5  % coverages show NDR behaviour, (ii) the transmission <b>of</b> the GO <b>sample</b> with 6.25  % coverage ratio diminishes after the NDR voltage range, (iii) the I–V characteristic of the rGO with 25  % coverage is highly linear making it to be suitable for use as interconnects and (iv) while rGO with 50  % coverage shows non-conducting behaviour near zero applied voltage as estimated by previous studies [21], it starts to be conducting beyond a threshold voltage. These different <b>transport</b> characteristics <b>of</b> rGO <b>samples</b> are shown to be originated from the variation of their transmission eigenstates and the localization degree of these eigenstates by the applied voltage. It is concluded that the voltage-dependent <b>transport</b> properties <b>of</b> rGO structures have diverse behaviours depending on the coverage ratio hence their peculiar I–V characteristics can be engineered to achieve specific functions in nanoscale circuits easily since the coverage ratios of rGO structures can be precisely controlled using reduction by laser light.|$|R

40|$|It is {{well-established}} that {{sampling and}} sample processing can easily introduce contamination into dissolved trace element samples if precautions are not taken. However, work in remote locations sometimes precludes bringing bulky clean lab equipment {{into the field}} and likewise may make timely <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> <b>samples</b> to the lab for processing impossible. Straightforward syringe filtration methods are described here for collecting small quantities (15 mL) of 0. 45 - and 0. 02 -microm filtered river water in an uncontaminated manner. These filtration methods take advantage of recent advances in analytical capabilities that require only small amounts of waterfor analysis of a suite of dissolved trace elements. Filter clogging and solute rejection artifacts appear to be minimal, although some adsorption of metals and organics does affect the first approximately 10 mL of water passing through the filters. Overall the methods are clean, easy to use, and provide reproducible representations of the dissolved and colloidal fractions of trace elements in river waters. Furthermore, sample processing materials can be prepared well in advance in a clean lab and transported cleanly and compactly to the field. Application of these methods is illustrated with data from remote locations in the Rocky Mountains and along the Yukon River. Evidence from field flow fractionation suggests that the 0. 02 -microm filters may provide a practical cutoff to distinguish metals associated with small inorganic and organic complexes from those associated with silicate and oxide colloids...|$|E

Scope: The main focus of the position paper is the coverage of aspects which have to be observed for the preparation and implementation of a monitoring program. Essential is the clear specification of the targets which determine the development of the monitoring concept and its realization.
