Elfonzo and Ambulinia soon repaired to the scene, and fortunately for them both the house was so crowded that they took their seats together in the music department, which was not {{in view of the}} auditory. This fortuitous circumstances added more the bliss of the Major than a thousand such exhibitions would have done. He forgot that he was man; music had lost its charms for him; whenever he attempted to carry his part, the string of the instrument would break, the bow became stubborn, and refused to obey the loud calls of <b>the</b> <b>audience.</b> <b>Here,</b> he said, was the paradise of his home, the long-sought-for opportunity; he felt as though he could send a million supplications to the throne of Heaven for such an exalted privilege. Poor Leos, who was somewhere in the crowd, looking as attentively as if he was searching for a needle in a haystack; here is stood, wondering to himself why Ambulinia was not there. [...] "Where can she be? Oh! if she was only here, how I could relish the scene! Elfonzo is certainly not in town; but what if he is? I have got the wealth, if I have not the dignity, and I am sure that the squire and his lady have always been particular friends of mine, and I think with this assurance I shall be able to get upon the blind side {{of the rest of the}} family and make the heaven-born Ambulinia the mistress of all I possess." [...] Then, again, he would drop his head, as if attempting to solve the most difficult problem in Euclid. While he was thus conjecturing in his own mind, a very interesting part of the exhibition was going on, which called the attention of all present. The curtains of the stage waved continually by the repelled forces that were given to them, which caused Leos to behold Ambulinia leaning upon the chair of Elfonzo. Her lofty beauty, seen by the glimmering of the chandelier, filled his heart with rapture, he knew not how to contain himself; to go where they were would expose him to ridicule; to continue where he was, with such an object before him, without being allowed an explanation in that trying hour, would be to the great injury of his mental as well as of his physical powers; and, in the name of high heaven, what must he do? Finally, he resolved to contain himself as well as he conveniently could, until the scene was over, and then he would plant himself at the door, to arrest Ambulinia from the hands of the insolent Elfonzo, and thus make for himself a more prosperous field of immortality than ever was decreed by Omnipotence, or ever pencil drew or artist imagined. Accordingly he made himself sentinel, immediately after the performance of the evening--retained his position apparently in defiance of all the world; he waited, he gazed at every lady, his whole frame trembled; here he stood, until everything like human shape had disappeared from the institution, and he had done nothing; he had failed to accomplish that which he so eagerly sought for. Poor, unfortunate creature! he had not the eyes of an Argus, or he might have seen his Juno and Elfonzo, assisted by his friend Sigma, make their escape from the window, and, with the rapidity of a race-horse, hurry through the blast of the storm to the residence of her father, without being recognized. He did not tarry long, but assured Ambulinia the endless chain of their existence was more closely connected than ever, since he had seen the virtuous, innocent, imploring, and the constant Amelia murdered by the jealous-hearted Farcillo, the accursed of the land.|$|E

40|$|O presente estudo tem por objetivo {{discutir}} o papel d{{a performance}} na narração de histórias. Almeja-se verificar como as diferentes linguagens envolvidas na performance voz, gestos, sons, figurino contribuem para a construção de diferentes leituras do texto literário pelo público receptor. A relevância deste tema reside, em especial, no fato de o tema ocupar um lugar ainda pouco explorado nos estudos literários, bem como em possibilitar o estudo da literatura em diálogo com outras formas artísticas. A pesquisa está organizada em três capítulos. No capítulo I, intitulado A influência dos movimentos artísticos e a tradição oral e escrita na arte de contar histórias, apresenta-se, inicialmente, o conceito de performance, suas relações diretas com os movimentos futuristas e surrealistas e a performance no contexto contemporâneo. No segundo, A audiência como coautora e a narrativa em performance a partir do conto A Moça Tecelã, de Marina Colasanti, discutiremos o papel do espectador diante da performance, ou seja, o processo de recepção do texto literário pelo público. Aqui, apresentamos o corpus de nossa pesquisa o conto A moça tecelã, de Marina Colasanti e sua apropriação pela contadora de histórias. Em A recepção e prática narrativa, último capítulo deste estudo, apresentaremos e analisaremos os elementos envolvidos na performance a partir da narração de A Moça Tecelã, relacionando as inúmeras hipóteses de aprendizado, de compreensão e interpretação do texto literário suscitados pela performance. A partir da recolha de impressões dos receptores, e tendo como base os estudos de Zumthor que nos assegura que a performance só acontece naquela atmosfera construída no momento do acontecimento podemos observar que quando o narrador, a história e a audiência se encontram, a performance possibilita um conjunto de leiturasThe {{aim of the}} present study is to discuss the role of the performance in narrative stories.

The research is organized in three chapters. In chapter I, entitled The influence of artistic movements and the oral and written tradition in the art of storytelling presents, initially, the concept of performance, its direct relations with futuristic and surrealistic movements and the performance in the contemporary context.

40|$|Dr Donna Coleman, pianist, {{performs}} Concerto in A minor, opus 7, by Clara Wieck, with The New Millennium Chamber Orchestra {{under the}} direction of James Richard Frieman, as part of the orchestra's Women's Music Festival. In addition, she offered solo works by Ruth Crawford, Amy Cheney Beach, and May Aufderheide. Clara Wieck was one of the world’s most celebrated pianists throughout her lifetime. Her mother Marianne was an accomplished singer and pianist, her father, Friedrich, a sought-after teacher of piano and composition. He was Clara’s first teacher, and he introduced her to the finest other musical mentors in Berlin, Dresden, and Leipzig. Before she reached her teenage years, she was already known across Europe as the “Queen of the Piano” and was the rival of such luminaries as Franz Liszt, Sigismond Thalberg, and Anton Rubenstein. Twenty-year-old Robert Schumann came to live in the Wieck household in order to study piano with Clara’s father, and he promptly {{fell in love with the}} brilliant young artist, who was eleven years old at the time (1830). He looked over her shoulder as she composed her only piano concerto. Upon hearing this grandly conceived, expressively virtuosic composition, it is astonishing to consider that the Concerto for Piano and Orchestra was completed when Clara was only sixteen years old! Despite its nods to the concerti and solo compositions of Chopin, Mendelssohn (the opening of the opus 25 concerto, with its ascending double octaves, i. e.), and Field (the sole concerto by her future husband, not surprisingly cast in the same key of A minor, was not completed until ten years later, so we may assume that Robert in this case was inspired by his wife’s genius), Clara’s concerto stands alongside these works as a true masterpiece. The journey commences with a traditional orchestral introduction that sets a plaintive, brooding tone that the pianist answers with imperious cascades of double octaves. It is possible that Edvard Grieg (as well as her future husband) was captivated by the power of these gestures; both used versions of them to begin their concerti. The lyrical main theme gives way to a series of dramatic episodic passages reminiscent of Chopin’s etudes and Robert’s solo piano works, including an obvious reference to his Toccata. The second movement begins as a piano solo that employs the same yearning, rising motive that opens the first. This rhapsody ultimately invites the solo cello to join in a passionate love song, no doubt a musical expression of the romance that was brewing between Clara and Robert. Movement III is a rondo form polonaise, in which the B strains are a harbinger of the gestures Robert later employed in Vogel als Prophet from Waldescenen, opus 82 (1848 – 1849). The eventual engagement of Clara to Robert Schumann was vehemently opposed by Clara’s father, and the couple had to resort to a court battle in order to marry (one day shy of Clara’s twenty-first birthday). Their extraordinary union produced eight children, nurtured the talent of their friends Johannes Brahms and Joseph Joachim (among others), and endured Robert’s gradual mental breakdown. Clara’s compositional activities were curtailed by these many responsibilities along with her ongoing concert career in which she was the most important champion of her husband’s music. Nevertheless, Clara’s compositional output includes masterpieces that deserve to be on concert programs, and Donna Coleman is thrilled to share this important and rarely heard work from the concerto literature with <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> <b>here</b> this evening.

40|$|Audiovisual {{contents}} constitute one of {{the most}} common ways of communicating information. However, audiovisual products are difficult to study because they integrate a lot of complex communication and artistic elements. Meaning and emotions are conveyed by combining film elements but also narrative elements, music and other audio aspects, which unfold over time and can be used to impact <b>the</b> <b>audiences.</b> <b>Here,</b> <b>the</b> user experience approach is taken to try to understand the relation between the video’s elements and the emotions produced in <b>the</b> <b>audience.</b> Emotions are understood within an appraisal framework where elements of the audiovisual format and content are integrated in memory with previous information. The interpretation of these mental representations constitutes the basis of the experienced emotions. This standpoint is used here to review users’ approaches and emotions as applied to the audiovisual format and content, along with aesthetics and interests as complex experiences in the context of films and other audiovisual products. Additionally, mixed-method approaches to studying mental contents and emotions are defended and used. Appraisal and user-centered theories also suggest that a product’s emotional impact is contextually mediated. Following this assumption, we investigated the impact of audiovisual contents in both commercial settings and feature length films. The influence of cultural factors was also reviewed and studied. Recent research suggests that aesthetics and visual design are culturally mediated; however, filmmakers assume that film elements equally impact culturally different viewers. The studies on this dissertation support this mixed conclusion: 1) Culturally loaded video products seem to be differently represented by Spanish and Finnish viewers. 2) Different aspects of the videos appear to have varying impacts on viewers depending on their nationalities, 3) videos, relative to static images, seem to reduce the differences in the mental representations of the commercial products. 4) Finally, films produced in countries differing in the cultural dimension share elements that provoke the audiences’ interest. This finding suggests that video elements induce universal emotions that balance out other possible cultural biases...|$|R

Field observations suggest that they may enhance social cohesion and that their effects are not limited to those actively performing but affect <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> as well. <b>Here</b> we show physiological effects of synchronized arousal in a Spanish fire-walking ritual, between active participants and related spectators, but not participants and other members of <b>the</b> <b>audience.</b> We assessed arousal by heart rate dynamics and applied nonlinear mathematical analysis to heart rate data obtained from 38 participants. We compared synchronized arousal between fire-walkers and spectators. For this comparison, we used recurrence quantification analysis on individual data and cross-recurrence quantification analysis on pairs of participants' data. These methods identified fine-grained commonalities of arousal during the 30 -min ritual between fire-walkers and related spectators but not unrelated spectators. This indicates that the mediating mechanism may be informational, because participants and related observers had very different bodily behavior. This study demonstrates that a collective ritual may evoke synchronized arousal over time between active participants and bystanders. It links field observations to a physiological basis and offers a unique approach for the quantification of social effects on human physiology during real-world interactions...|$|R

Years earlier, Boorman had been {{considered}} by Warner Bros. as a possible director for the first Exorcist movie, but he turned the opportunity down because he found the story [...] "rather repulsive." [...] However, he was intrigued {{with the idea of}} directing a sequel, explaining that [...] "every film has to struggle to find a connection with its <b>audience.</b> <b>Here</b> I saw <b>the</b> chance to make an extremely ambitious film without having to spend the time developing this connection. I could make assumptions and then take <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> on a very adventurous cinematic journey." ...|$|R
