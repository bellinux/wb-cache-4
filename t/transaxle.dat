5|$|Four-wheel {{drive was}} decided against {{early in the}} {{development}} process, {{for a number of}} reasons. It was thought rear-wheel drive would be adequate in the majority of situations, that the additional complexity of the four-wheel drive system would hinder the development process and potentially be problematic for the customer. FF Developments were contracted to provide the gearbox/transaxle assembly, modifying their four-wheel drive <b>transaxle</b> assembly from the XJ220 concept into a pure rear-wheel drive design for the production car. A five-speed gearbox is fitted; a six-speed gearbox was considered but deemed unnecessary, as the torque characteristics of the engine made a sixth gear redundant. The <b>transaxle</b> featured a viscous coupling limited slip differential to improve traction.|$|E
5|$|The mid-engine {{complicated}} {{the design of}} the four-wheel drive system, and an innovative solution was needed to get drive {{from the rear of the}} engine to the front wheels. The chosen design took the front-wheel drive from the central differential on the rear <b>transaxle</b> and sent it through the V in the centre of the engine using a quill drive, before joining an inverted differential. The clutch was a twin-plate unit designed by AP Racing.|$|E
5|$|For 1966 the Formula One engine {{capacity}} limit was increased to 3.0 litres from the 1.5 litres {{of the previous}} five seasons. McLaren considered and discounted British Racing Motors (BRM), Maserati, Coventry Climax and Oldsmobile engines before opting for a Ford V8 engine. This engine was originally designed for the Indianapolis 500, the premier single-seater oval track race in the United States, {{and had to be}} reduced in capacity from 4.2 litres to the 3.0 litre limit. This choice was partly motivated by the belief that it might bring financial support from Ford, although this never materialised. Ex BMW and Daimler-Benz engineer Klaus von Rucker was initially appointed to carry out the conversion of the engine in England. However, progress was slow so the project was transferred to Traco Engineering in California, United States, where extensive modifications were made to the internals under the oversight of McLaren's Gary Knutson. In its 4.2 litre form the Ford engine produced 470bhp and McLaren expected the reduced capacity version to produce about 335bhp. In fact, it produced 300bhp in a narrow power band and was further handicapped by its large size and weight; combined with the gearbox it weighed nearly as much as rival team Brabham's entire car. In order to allow time to further develop the Ford, McLaren also used a Serenissima M166 3.0 litre V8 engine for some of the races. This engine produced about 260bhp and required modifications to be made to the monocoque but was at least relatively light and compact. Four- and five-speed ZF <b>transaxle</b> gearboxes and a Borg & Beck clutch were employed.|$|E

25|$|In 2008, Nissan {{introduced}} the GT-R featuring a rear-mounted <b>transaxle.</b> The AWD system requires two drive shafts, one main shaft {{from the engine}} to the <b>transaxle</b> and differential and a second drive shaft from the <b>transaxle</b> to the front wheels.|$|E
25|$|The 4RM {{system used}} in the Ferrari FF in 2011 is unique in {{that it has a}} rear <b>transaxle</b> with {{secondary}} front <b>transaxle</b> connected directly to the engine. The car operates primarily as a rear wheel drive vehicle. Clutches in the front <b>transaxle</b> engage when the rear wheels slip. Drive to the front wheels is transmitted through two infinitely-variable clutch packs which are allowed to 'slip' to give the required road wheel speeds. The front <b>transaxle</b> has three gears, two forward, and reverse. The two forward gears of the front transmission match the lower four forward gears of the rear transmission. It is not used in higher gears. The connection between this gearbox and each front wheel is via independent haldex-type clutches, without a differential. Due to the difference in ratios the clutches continually slip and only transmit, at most, 20% of the engine's torque.|$|E
25|$|The X180 cars {{inherited}} most {{of their}} mechanical components from the earlier HC Esprit and Turbo Esprit, although the name for the forced induction model was now Esprit Turbo. 1988 model year North American Esprit Turbos kept the CitroÃ«n <b>transaxle</b> and Bosch fuel injection system used in the previous model year. Other X180s received a new Renault UN-1 <b>transaxle,</b> which necessitated a move to outboard rear brakes.|$|E

50|$|All 1986 & 1987 GLHS's {{were first}} run using {{conventional}} oil for engine break-in, then filled with Mobil 1 oil. All <b>transaxles</b> came filled with 5-30W engine oil.|$|R
50|$|In the 1990s, the {{transmissions}} were renamed, {{however the}} original Torqueflite design remained {{the basis of}} many Chrysler designed (and built) transmissions thru 2007 (and FWD <b>transaxles</b> thru 2000).|$|R
25|$|Power is {{transferred}} from the engine to the rear wheels through a six-speed sequential <b>transaxle</b> with an integrated spool differential. The individual gear ratios and the final drive ratio are fixed with drop gears {{at the front of}} the <b>transaxle</b> allowing the teams to alter the overall transmission ratio for different circuits. The cars use a triple plate clutch. The cars run on E85 fuel with a fuel tank capacity of 112 litres.|$|E
25|$|For the 2015 model, Chevrolet began {{offering}} a <b>transaxle</b> {{version of the}} 8L90 8-speed automatic to replace the previous 6-speed 6L80.|$|E
25|$|The Alfetta name (Little Alfa in Italian) {{came from}} the {{nickname}} of the Alfa Romeo Tipo 159 Alfetta, a successful Formula One car which in its latest 1951 iteration paired a <b>transaxle</b> layout to De Dion tube rear suspension, like the modern saloon.|$|E
50|$|Earlier AXOD and AXOD-E {{models have}} a poor {{reliability}} record due to internal lubrication problems. These were mostly remedied by 1995. These <b>transaxles</b> require fluid and filter changes every 30,000 miles to maximize service life.|$|R
50|$|The F35 {{features}} a two-axis conventional transverse layout, with fully synchronized gears, and compact packaging. It {{features a}} higher torque carrying capacity than most manual <b>transaxles</b> currently in use by competing North American small cars.|$|R
50|$|Francis and Colotti {{knew the}} {{shortage}} of limited slip differential manufacturers was a big hardship experienced by Grand Prix constructors then. For example, Colin Chapman had his in-house engineers, Keith Duckworth and Mike Costin, develop the sequentially-shifting <b>transaxles</b> for Lotus 16 and Lotus 18, which he had originally asked Richard Ansdale and Harry Mundy to design for Lotus 12. But despite these <b>transaxles</b> being unique and innovative, they still incorporated limited slip differentials made by ZF of Germany, which was about the only source, and the technology used was an old slip-limiting principle invented by Ferdinand Porsche in the 1930s for Auto Union GP cars.|$|R
25|$|Toyota {{states that}} it filed 1000 patents during the {{development}} of the XW30 Prius. The concept of the powertrain largely carried over from the previous XW20 model, although the engine displacement was increased to 1.8 litres and the <b>transaxle</b> was changed to the THS III. Disc brakes replaced the North American model's rear drum brakes.|$|E
25|$|The 1970s {{were not}} a good period for luxury car {{manufacturers}} and Derek Hurlock went searching for a totally new smaller car. Mid-engined designs were in fashion {{at the time and}} in 1972 the Diablo, a prototype with an Austin Maxi engine and <b>transaxle,</b> was built by privateers Peter Bohanna and Robin Stables.|$|E
25|$|Based on the A6 platform, the RS6's {{internal}} combustion engines are front-mounted and longitudinally oriented, while the transmission is mounted immediately {{at the rear}} of the engine in a longitudinal orientation, in the form of a <b>transaxle.</b> Like all S and RS models, the RS6 is only available with Audi's 'trademark' Torsen-based quattro permanent four-wheel drive system.|$|E
50|$|The 4T40-E and 4T45-E are {{a series}} of {{automatic}} <b>transaxles</b> from General Motors. Designed for transverse engine configurations, the series includes 4 forward gears. The 4Txx family replaced the Turbo-Hydramatic 125 transverse three speed automatic introduced in 1980.|$|R

50|$|<b>Transaxles</b> {{are near}} {{universal}} in all automobile configurations {{that have the}} engine placed at the same end of the car as the driven wheels: the front-engine, front-wheel drive layout; rear-engine, rear-wheel drive layout; and rear mid-engine, rear-wheel drive layout arrangements.|$|R
25|$|The 1963 Sting Ray {{production}} car's lineage can {{be traced}} to two separate GM projects: the Q-Corvette, and perhaps more directly, Mitchell's racing Sting Ray. The Q-Corvette, initiated in 1957, envisioned a smaller, more advanced Corvette as a coupe-only model, boasting a rear <b>transaxle,</b> independent rear suspension, and four-wheel disc brakes, with the rear brakes mounted inboard. Exterior styling was purposeful, with peaked fenders, a long nose, and a short, bobbed tail.|$|E
25|$|An {{agreement}} was reached with Standard to supply new chassis, the ancient three-speed <b>transaxle</b> {{was replaced by a}} modern four-speed gearbox (built in unit with the engine), and by 1932 a new range of cars was finally launched. Production continued on this small scale, averaging less than 100 vehicles per year, until the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939. The final pre-war car was delivered in June 1940, after which the factory was fully involved with war production.|$|E
25|$|In 1986 Alfa Romeo GTV6 {{was one of}} {{the fastest}} Group A rally cars. In 1986 {{production}} of the GTV6 ceased and Alfa Romeo turned its Group A racing and rallying efforts to the 75/Milano saloons, which were based on the same rear <b>transaxle</b> chassis. However, 1986 also saw the GTV6 post one of its finest rallying victories when Yves Loubet's example won the Group A in the tragic 1986 Tour de Corse and placed 3rd overall among the monstrously powerful four-wheel-drive Group B cars.|$|E

50|$|The BC-series manual {{transmissions}} are {{a series}} of manual <b>transaxles</b> produced by Ford in Europe for its front wheel drive automobiles from 1976 onwards. Originally debuting in the Mk.1 Ford Fiesta, the unit was later used in Ford's other front wheel drive vehicles, most notably the Ford Escort and Orion.|$|R
25|$|When the 2.5L HSC four-cylinder {{was dropped}} in early 1991, {{along with the}} three-speed ATX {{automatic}} transmission, all following second-generation Taurus models came standard with the 140horsepower (104kW) 3.0L Vulcan V6, except for the LX wagon that came with a 3.8L Essex V6. The Essex was optional on all other Taurus models. Every engine in this generation used the four-speed AXOD-E automatic transmission, until 1993, when it {{was replaced by the}} four-speed AX4S transmission, which was used {{for the rest of this}} generation's production run in most models. Some 1994â1995 3.0L came with the AX4N <b>transaxle.</b>|$|E
25|$|The 75 {{featured}} {{some unusual}} technical features, {{most notably the}} fact that it was almost perfectly balanced from front to rear. This was achieved by using <b>transaxle</b> schema â mounting the standard five-speed gearbox in the rear connected to the rear differential (rear-wheel drive). The front suspension was a torsion bar and shock absorber combination and the rear an expensive de Dion tube assembled with shock absorbers; these designs were intended to optimize the car's handling; moreover the rear brake discs were fitted at the centre of the rear axle, near the gearbox-differential group. The engine crankshaft was bolted directly to the two-segment driveshaft, which ran the length of the underside from the engine block to the gearbox and rotated at the speed of the engine. The shaft segments were joined with elastomeric 'doughnuts' to prevent vibration and engine/gearbox damage. The 2.0 L Twin Spark and the 3.0 Litre V6 were equipped with limited slip differential.|$|E
25|$|Knudsen's {{success at}} Pontiac {{led to his}} {{promotion}} to general manager of Chevrolet Division in 1961. While at Pontiac he was noted for his interest in performance, and this continued {{with the introduction of}} the Chevrolet Super Sport models. He also insisted on changes to improve the safety of the Chevrolet Corvair, which was not reported publicly until it was revealed by John DeLorean in his book On a Clear Day You Can See General Motors. Knudsen also reportedly rejected an idea to offer a Pontiac version of the revolutionary Corvair in favor a front-engine compact car to be offered by Oldsmobile (as the F-85) and Buick (as the Special) for 1961. Pontiac introduced its version of the Buick-Olds-Pontiac compact as the Tempest for 1961, but gave that car some unique engineering features such as a slanted four-cylinder engine (which was really half of a Pontiac 389 V8), rear swing axles and a rear <b>transaxle</b> (both derived from the Corvair) driven by a flexing shaft to eliminate the driveshaft hump for increased interior space.|$|E
5000|$|... [...] Unlike most {{front wheel}} drive inline engine <b>transaxles,</b> the gearbox is between the engine and the final drive. Engine-clutch-gearbox-final drive, direct drive through gearbox in third gear, fourth [...] "overdrive." [...] Final drive spiral bevel gear on primary shaft, {{step-down}} to differential gear through helical (not herringbone) pinion and gear.|$|R
50|$|In some {{transmission}} designs (Volvo 850 and V/S70 series, for example) {{there are}} actually two countershafts, both driving an output pinion meshing with the front-wheel-drive <b>transaxle's</b> ring gear. This allows the transmission designer to make the transmission narrower, since each countershaft need only be half {{as long as a}} traditional countershaft with four gears and two shifters.|$|R
50|$|Visually, the {{distinction}} between a garden tractor and a lawn tractor is often hard to make - generally, garden tractors are more sturdily built, with stronger frames, 12-inch or larger wheels mounted with multiple lugs (most lawn tractors have a single bolt or clip on the hub), heavier <b>transaxles,</b> and ability to accommodate {{a wide range of}} front, belly, and rear mounted attachments.|$|R
