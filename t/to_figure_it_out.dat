5|$|Determined to {{make this}} the king's happiest {{birthday}} ever and save the day, SpongeBob sets out to find Triton and bring him to the party. Once found, Triton initially ignores SpongeBob, but after smelling SpongeBob's terribly smelly breath, he tells him to undo the lock. Unable <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>it</b> <b>out,</b> SpongeBob calls his best friend, Patrick, to help out. Patrick unlocks Triton's cell, and the Prince escapes the island. No one anticipates Triton's wrath, Triton destroys Bikini Bottom. Noticing {{that something is wrong}} at the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob and Patrick enter the building from the back, discovering the guests and staff locked in a cage. When Patrick unlocks the cell, Triton attempts to escape his father, who catches up to him. King Neptune can't tolerate his son's wrongdoings, but on seeing how Triton destroyed Bikini Bottom, is pleased that he's finally using powers, becoming a worthy successor. The family leaves for home, with King Neptune crediting SpongeBob for this development; the townsfolk of Bikini Bottom see differently, chasing him and Patrick in an angry mob.|$|E

The pilots were confused about their location and were trying <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> based on reports from ATC, the flight computer and a portable GPS device.

500|$|Literary critic Jean-Marie Apostolidès psychoanalysed The Shooting Star, {{describing}} it as [...] "the final attempt of the foundling [...] to rid {{himself of the}} bastard [...] and to preserve the integrity of his former values", {{pointing out that the}} first thirteen pages are devoted purely to the boy reporter. He also argued that Phostle and Philippus represent two-halves of [...] "an ambivalent father figure" [...] within the story, with the former prefiguring Calculus [...] "more than any other previous character". He suggests that when hiding on the Aurora, Philippus can be compared to The Phantom of the Opera, as he steals a stick of dynamite and climbs up the ship's mast before threatening to detonate the weapon. Apostolidès believed that the shooting star itself is [...] "more a religious mystery than a scientific one" [...] and that Tintin is therefore [...] "the perfect one <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> in some religious way—that is, unrealistically". Apostolidès analysed the political component of the story in terms of [...] "the incarnation of unregulated capitalism against the spirit of European values", arguing that Hergé was adhering to [...] "a utopian vision that, in 1942, smacks of pro-German propaganda".|$|E
500|$|After Carey {{finished}} her The Adventures of Mimi Tour (2006) {{in support of}} her tenth studio album The Emancipation of Mimi (2005), she began to work on material for her eleventh studio effort, the yet untitled E=MC² (2008). E=MC² was hailed {{as one of the}} most anticipated albums to be released in 2008, with many critics weighing their opinions on whether Carey would be able to deliver significant success, following her achievements with The Emancipation of Mimi. After the release and success of [...] "Touch My Body", the project's lead single, subsequent singles of the album failed to garner airplay or significant charting, Island Records halted promotion of the album. Since the album's release, Carey had planned to embark on an extensive tour in support of E=MC², describing its production and direction in several interviews. When asked to describe the tour's theme, Carey explained [...] "I'm thinking elaborate. I like elaborate. We only do substantial. That's what my jeweler says. I haven't gotten the looks in mind just yet, but we're going <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> soon enough."

[...] He reports to his superior, Major Monogram, via {{telecast}} in his large, high-tech, underground hideout. Every day, he engages in battles with the evil scientist Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz, who tries using inventions to take over the tri-state area. Perry is always able to foil Doofenshmirtz's plans and in doing so accidentally leads to the destruction of whatever form of contraption his owners, Phineas Flynn and Ferb Fletcher, are building in order to make summer better. Phineas and Ferb are aware that something happens to get rid of their scheme for the day, but do not know that Perry is the cause behind it and are largely dismissive of it. Their sister, Candace, also does not know that Perry is behind the destruction and is driven to near insanity trying <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>it</b> <b>out.</b> Throughout the series, Perry is aware of Phineas and Ferb's inventions, but is largely uninterested in them, save whenever he notices that their latest invention may help him thwart Doofenshmirtz.|$|E

[...] "It's something that we're doing for people who care <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> and follow it, but it's not something that a viewer has to consider when they watch the show." [...] Abrams also revealed that the seemingly unrelated frogs which have the Greek letter Phi (Φ) imprinted on their back appeared in promos for the show have significance {{within the context of the}} series, saying [...] "it's part of the code of the show." [...] The glyph code was cracked by an editor at the technology site Ars Technica, who discovered it to be a simple substitution cipher used to spell out a single thematic word for each episode; for example, the pilot episode's eight glyphs spell out the word [...] "observer". Whether there is a further second-order code to be solved remains to be seen. Additionally, the glyphs are representative of some of the means by which Walter solves a case (such as the moth/butterfly from [...] "Johari Window", the seahorse strain of DNA from [...] "The Bishop Revival"). In [...] "Jacksonville", behind Walter as he speaks to Olivia about her treatment where the nootropic Cortexiphan was first studied as a trial, each of the glyphs is clearly visible on the daycare wall. An episode-by-episode key to the various glyphs was made available on Fringepedia.|$|E

I'm thinking probably September. But I think it's important to tour with this album, {{because there are so many}} songs that I really want to sing live, that I really enjoy."

[...] Despite continued plans for a tour, and announcements made on The X Factor in United Kingdom in November, the tour was suddenly cancelled by early December. Tabloids and critics began heavily speculating that Carey had become pregnant, and had abandoned plans for a tour as a result. Many claimed to have seen Carey visiting a famed gynecologist's office in Los Angeles. Additionally, Carey's newly slimmed figure began to change, as she stopped her exercise routines and gained weight. Though Carey had eventually announced that she was pregnant with twins on November 28, 2010, over two years later, she admitted she had indeed been pregnant during that time period, and suffered a miscarriage.

2500|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, {{a set of}} famous {{experiments}} by Hans Spemann and Hilde Mangold showed that the formation of nervous tissue is [...] "induced" [...] by signals {{from a group of}} mesodermal cells called the organizer region. For decades, though, the nature of the induction process defeated every attempt <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>it</b> <b>out,</b> until finally it was resolved by genetic approaches in the 1990s. [...] Induction of neural tissue requires inhibition of the gene for a so-called bone morphogenetic protein, or BMP. [...] Specifically the protein BMP4 appears to be involved. [...] Two proteins called Noggin and Chordin, both secreted by the mesoderm, are capable of inhibiting BMP4 and thereby inducing ectoderm to turn into neural tissue. [...] It appears that a similar molecular mechanism is involved for widely disparate types of animals, including arthropods as well as vertebrates. [...] In some animals, however, another type of molecule called Fibroblast Growth Factor or FGF may also {{play an important role in}} induction.|$|E

Gunn also introduced multiple actors who were playing Ravager characters, since the Ravagers have a larger presence in the film. On the decision to reveal Russell as Ego and Quill's father when he did, Gunn felt that since [...] "people were going <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> eventually… it was better that we took the reins in our own hands" [...] and make the reveal. Gunn also felt that this would move the focus of audiences from wanting to discov er who Quill's father is to [...] "the story and the relationship that these characters have". In August 2016, Gunn confirmed the film would feature a post-credits scene, later stating there would be five in total, with four mid-credits scenes and one post-credits.
