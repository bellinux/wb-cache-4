2500|$|The word mail {{comes from}} the Medieval English word male, {{referring}} to a <b>travelling</b> <b>bag</b> or pack.|encyclopedia=Dictionary.com|year=2007|edition=Unabridged (v 1.1)|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/mail}} It was spelled that way until the 17th century, and is distinct from the word male. The French have a similar word, malle for a trunk or large box, and mála is the Irish term for a bag. In the 17th century, the word mail began to appear as a reference for a bag that contained letters: [...] "bag full of letter" [...] (1654). Over the next hundred years the word mail began to be applied strictly to the letters themselves, and the sack as the mailbag. In the 19th century the British usually referred to mail as being letters that were being sent abroad (i.e. on a ship), and post as letters that were for localized delivery; in the UK the Royal Mail delivers the post, while in the U.S. the U.S. Postal Service delivers the mail. The term email (short for [...] "electronic mail") {{first appeared in the}} 1970s. The term snail-mail is a retronym to distinguish it from the quicker email. Various dates have been given for its first use.|$|E

60|$|The {{scene on}} the ship was dreary, for many were going in her to the various theatres of war, Egypt, Africa, and other places, and sad, oh! sad were the good-byes upon that bitter winter afternoon. Some of the women cried, {{especially}} those of the humbler class. But Isobel would not cry. She remained quite calm to the last, arranging a few flowers and unpacking a <b>travelling</b> <b>bag</b> in Godfrey's cabin, for as a colonel he had one to himself.|$|E
60|$|Carmina {{had left}} her bed. Robed in her white dressing-gown, she lay on the sofa in the sitting-room. When her aunt came in, she started and shuddered Those signs of nervous aversion escaped the notice of Mrs. Gallilee. Her {{attention}} had been at once attracted by a <b>travelling</b> <b>bag,</b> opened as if in preparation for packing. The telegram lay on Carmina's lap. The significant connection between those two objects asserted itself plainly. But it was exactly {{the opposite of the}} connection suspected by Mrs. Gallilee. The telegram had prevented Carmina from leaving the house.|$|E
60|$|The stranger, who {{had been}} holding up his {{umbrella}} to attract their notice, was walking forward leisurely enough, now that he found, by their stopping, {{that it had been}} secured. His clothes were decidedly not of a local cut, though it was difficult to point out any particular mark of difference. In his left hand he carried a small leather <b>travelling</b> <b>bag.</b> As soon as he had overtaken the van he glanced at the inscription on its side, as if to assure himself that he had hailed the right conveyance, and asked if they had room.|$|E

6000|$|Miss Minerva obstinately {{followed}} them, with Maria in attendance, still imperfectly enlightened on {{the migration}} of cranes. Zo looked round, in search of another audience. Teresa had been listening; she was present, waiting for events. Being herself what stupid people call [...] "an oddity," [...] her sympathies were attracted by this quaint child. In Teresa's opinion, seeing the animals was very inferior, as an amusement, to exploring Zo's mind. She produced a cake of chocolate, from a <b>travelling</b> <b>bag</b> which she carried with her everywhere. The cake was sweet, it was flavoured with vanilla, and it was offered to Zo, unembittered by advice not to be greedy and make herself ill. Staring hard at Teresa, she took an experimental bite. The wily duenna chose that propitious moment to present herself in the capacity of a new audience.|$|E
6000|$|Miss Greyson was {{sympathetic}} {{towards her}} {{desire for a}} longish holiday and wonderfully helpful; and Mrs. Denton also approved, and, to Joan's surprise, kissed her; Mrs. Denton was not given to kissing.

[...] "With love and many thanks," [...] he had added. She waited till the day before starting to run round and say good-bye to the Phillipses. She felt it would be unwise to try and get out of doing that. Both Phillips and Hilda, she was thankful, were out; and she and Mrs. Phillips had tea alone together. The talk was difficult, so far as Joan was concerned. If the woman had been possessed of ordinary intuition, she might have arrived at the truth. Joan almost wished she would. It would make her own future task the easier. But Mrs. Phillips, it was clear, was going to be no help to her.|$|E
