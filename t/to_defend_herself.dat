At Sainte Anne Island, two large British ships chased him, but {{he was able to}} evade them by sailing through the reefs, at night.|$|E
5|$|Alisia {{attacks by}} {{shooting}} streaks of lightning from her hands. The attack automatically targets enemies in range but gets weaker with each volley as Alisia's power is depleted. Her power recharges when she stops attacking; when fully charged, it {{allows her to}} unleash a multi-target attack, hitting every enemy on the screen. The energy system introduces an element of strategy, encouraging the player to manage Alisia's power to have her able <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>herself</b> at critical moments.|$|E
5|$|In August 2005, Glover {{was sentenced}} to 240 hours {{community}} service by St Helens magistrates after admitting claiming £14,831 in welfare benefits between August 2002 and November 2004 while posing for newspapers and magazines. She stated {{that she did not}} know the small and irregular earnings would make a difference to her benefits, and that she had been sometimes too depressed to leave her flat. While performing the community service in 2006, she was assaulted twice by a group of girls, one attack leaving her with a broken nose. This cost her a month of modelling work, and contributed to her depression, but also to her taking kickboxing classes to learn <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>herself.</b>|$|E

Her long narrative poem, Writing to the Regional Inspector of My Feelings While in Prison alludes <b>to</b> her <b>defending</b> <b>herself</b> against a knife-wielding intruder. The poem was given to the prefect with the hope of clearing her name of false charges, but her fate is unknown.|$|R
5|$|At that point, {{the party}} reunites with Zola, who {{supplies}} a Mechat {{for them to}} pursue Nene. As the party goes after Nene in the Mechat, Nene initiates an ancient machine that splits the world into two hemispheres, with thousands of isolated cubes floating between the halves. The party follows Nene to the Primitive Cube {{at the core of}} the transformation. The party journeys through the cube eventually defeating General Szabo and ultimately engaging Nene. As the party weakens Nene, it is revealed that Zola was working for Nene all along, and she was the voice that told the others to swallow the spheres. When Zola was too weak <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>herself,</b> Nene had given her a shadow and sent her to Jibral as a spy. Zola betrays and kills Nene choosing her friends over him.|$|E
5|$|Like the {{previous}} {{titles in the}} Prime series, Metroid Prime Hunters is generally classified as a first-person adventure to highlight the focus on navigation and discovery. However, the game differs from its predecessors with the removal of assisted aiming, more action-oriented gameplay, and the inclusion of an online multiplayer mode. The player controls Samus Aran, who {{is equipped with a}} Power Suit that allows her to access her gunship from anywhere. She can scan almost any object in the game; the gunship will return relevant information retrieved from its database. An Arm Cannon is attached to the Power Suit, which she uses to attack enemies. To enter small tunnels, Samus can roll into a Morph Ball, an alternative form of the Power Suit that decreases her size substantially. In this form, she is given an unlimited supply of bombs but is only allowed to use three at a time. She can use the bombs <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>herself</b> and destroy small objects.|$|E
5|$|In October 2012, {{new details}} emerged in her murder investigation. Charges were brought against Jorge Antonio Hernández Silva (alias El Silva) and José Adrián Hernández Domínguez (alias El Jarocho), {{two men who}} were alleged to have murdered Martínez Pérez. Silva, who had already been arrested, confessed to the murder. According to Silva's confession, the {{reporter}} knew Domínguez and therefore allowed both of them into her house {{on the night of}} her murder. After some conversation, Domínguez grew angry and started beating Martínez Pérez with the intention of forcing her to reveal where she hid her money and other valuable possessions. Silva then joined his accomplice in the beating until they killed her. Investigators said that the attackers had plunged the journalist's head into a toilet bowl, hit her on the head several times with brass knuckles, and threw her against a tub, where she cracked her skull. Martínez Pérez unsuccessfully tried <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>herself</b> by grabbing a kitchen knife and stabbing one of the attackers in the forearm, but they managed to outweigh her because she only weighed 108lbs (48.9kg). Both men then stole a plasma TV, two cellphones, a laptop computer, a camera and a small box, and the journalist's wristband from her home before leaving the crime scene.|$|E

5000|$|In October 2007, author Violet Blue {{filed suit}} in federal court alleging {{trademark}} violation and dilution, as well as unfair business practices with [...] author Blue's persona and belatedly-trademarked name being used. The pornographic actress had used the name since 2000 and was financially unable <b>to</b> properly <b>defend</b> <b>herself.</b> The court issued a preliminary injunction that forced her to stop using the name [...] "Violet Blue" [...] or anything confusingly similar; the stage name Noname Jane was adopted instead.|$|R

5|$|Sawicka's {{time at the}} Lucan {{household}} ended late in March 1973. While {{with two}} of the children near Grosvenor Place, she was confronted by Lucan and two private detectives. They told her that the children had been made wards of court and that she must release them into his custody, which she did. Frances was collected from school later in the day. Lady Lucan applied to the court to have the children returned, but concerned about the case's complexity, the judge set a date for the hearing three months ahead, for June 1973. <b>To</b> <b>defend</b> <b>herself</b> against Lucan's claims about her mental state, Veronica booked herself a four-day stay at the Priory Clinic in Roehampton. While it was acknowledged that she still required some psychiatric support, the doctors reported that there was no indication that she was mentally ill. Lucan's case depended upon Veronica being unable to care for the children, but at the hearing, he was instead forced to defend his own behaviour toward her. After several weeks of witnesses and protracted arguments in camera, on the advice of his lawyers he conceded the case. Unimpressed by Lucan's character, Mr Justice Rees awarded custody to Veronica. The earl was allowed access every other weekend.|$|E
5|$|The {{views of}} Whitehall were not echoed by the naval commanders, {{especially}} Sir Varyl Begg, Commander-in-Chief of British {{forces in the}} region, who believed that the carrier was too weak <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>herself</b> against Indonesian attack or strike in turn against them. Begg adjudged that the narrowness of the Strait combined with local geographical features restricted the ships' movement and negated their radar, while custom prevented the carrier from flying its aircraft or even carrying them on deck, rendering it and the escorts extremely vulnerable in case of attack. He offered instead to send the destroyers, which were far more expendable pieces than a fleet carrier. His views were supported by the High Commissioner to Malaysia, Lord Antony Head, who argued {{that there would be}} very little gain for Indonesia and loss for Britain if the carrier was not risked. Luce, however, remained adamant that the Victorious must sail through herself, but in order to assuage Begg's fears assured him that the more modern carrier HMS Centaur would be on hand to provide air cover for the task force. Reinforcements were also rushed to Singapore to meet any Indonesian provocation. Thorneycroft ordered Begg to begin planning for the forced passage of the Strait, as officials determined on 3–4 September that the carrier must not be diverted.|$|E

5000|$|Like Sadako in {{the novels}} and nearly in Ring Kanzenban, Eun-Suh was raped before being thrown down the well. The rapist was her half-brother. Similarly to Sadako in Ring Kanzenban, she struggles <b>to</b> escape, <b>defends</b> <b>herself</b> by biting and drawing blood from her captives shoulder, and is ashamed when he discovers her Testicular Feminization Syndrome. Though it's not as clearly explained, Eun-Suh appears to telepathically {{threaten}} {{to kill him}} for discovering her secret. Horrified, he strangles her unconscious before dropping her into a nearby well. In Eun-Suh's cursed tape this is briefly shown.|$|R

50|$|Angelina's {{progress}} {{was arrested by}} the disturbance she caused in the communities where she called for young women to adopt religious life. She was doubly charged with sorcery, the imagined origin of her sway over women, and heresy, because of her allegedly Manichean opposition <b>to</b> marriage. Angelina <b>defended</b> <b>herself</b> before Ladislas, the King of Naples, who dismissed the charges, but expelled her and her companions from the kingdom, {{in order to avoid}} further complaints.|$|R

25|$|Hannah Hanson Kinney (born Hannah Hanson in 1805) was an American {{seamstress}} who {{was charged}} {{with the murder of}} her third husband, George Kinney in 1840. Arsenic, the alleged murder weapon, was found in Kinney's stomach during an autopsy. Though Kinney was acquitted, public records indicate that Kinney's second husband, Reverend Enoch W. Freeman, and Freeman's father, died of arsenic poisoning years earlier. Public consensus following Kinney's trial deemed her guilty, and she published an autobiography in 1841 <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>herself.</b>|$|E
25|$|In September 2007, a {{committee}} questioned Speaker Patricia Etteh about her spending of ₦628 million ($4.8m) on home renovation and automobiles.

Former President Olusegun Obasanjo and many top PDP members continued to back her, but a large segment of the party, led by Lawan and including Bankole, called for her resignation. It was reported that Bankole, among multiple other contenders, hoped to succeed her as early as 5 October 2007.|$|E
30|$|In broad terms, {{bullying}} may {{be classified}} as direct or indirect (Lopes Neto, 2005). Direct, face-to-face bullying draws more attention because it involves open aggression, including public verbal abuse, intentional exclusion from groups, punching or pushing, or other types of physical aggression. Indirect bullying involves spreading negative rumors or accusations about {{a person who is}} not present <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> him or <b>herself,</b> or indirect negative comments {{in the presence of the}} target (Lopes Neto, 2005).|$|R

50|$|In {{common with}} other wolf spiders, the European Lycosa narbonensis protect her egg-sac by {{carrying}} it everywhere, {{attached to the}} spinnerets. She has a powerful instinct <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> it but can be easily fooled: if her egg-sac is changed for something artificial, {{like a piece of}} cork or a wad of paper, she will be defend the substitute with her life. After 2 or 3 weeks, the mother bites open the sac to allow the brood of up to 100 spiderlings to climb onto her abdomen , several layers deep. Living on their reserves, they hold on for about a week while she continues <b>to</b> hunt, and <b>defend</b> <b>herself</b> if necessary. However, there is no mutual recognition. Females accept spiderlngs from another female, and the spiderlings will climb onto the back of other even spiders, even males of other species, which often simply eat them.|$|R

Three days later, in her first press conference since her surgery, Kvitová revealed that she had regained movement in her left hand.|$|E
25|$|The {{roles of}} each {{character}} are strongly {{defined in the}} series: Fred is the leader and the determined detective, Velma is the intelligent analyst, Daphne is danger-prone, Shaggy is a coward more motivated by hunger than any desire to solve mysteries, and Scooby is similar to Shaggy, save for a Bob Hope-inspired tendency towards temporary bravery. Later versions of the show would make slight changes to the characters' established roles, most notably {{in the character of}} Daphne, shown in 1990s and 2000s Scooby-Doo productions as knowing many forms of karate and having the ability <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>herself,</b> and less of a tendency towards getting kidnapped.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Socialist Revolutionary {{leaders in}} exile, {{many of them}} living in Switzerland, had been the glum spectators of the {{collapse}} of international socialist solidarity. French and German Social Democrats had voted in favour of their respective governments' war efforts. Georgi Plekhanov in Paris had adopted a violently anti-German stand, while Parvus supported the German war effort as the best means of ensuring a revolution in Russia. The Mensheviks largely maintained that Russia had the right <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>herself</b> against Germany, although Martov (a prominent Menshevik), now on the left of his group, demanded an end to the war and a settlement on the basis of national self-determination, with no annexations or indemnities.|$|E
25|$|Workplace {{bullying}} overlaps to {{some degree}} with workplace incivility but tends to encompass more intense and typically repeated acts of disregard and rudeness. Negative spirals of increasing incivility between organizational members can result in bullying, but isolated acts of incivility are not conceptually bullying despite the apparent similarity in their form and content. In case of bullying, the intent of harm is less ambiguous, an unequal balance of power (both formal and informal) is more salient, and the target of bullying feels threatened, vulnerable and unable <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> himself or <b>herself</b> against negative recurring actions.|$|R
