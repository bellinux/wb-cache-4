5|$|Once {{he reached}} Ohrid, Skanderbeg {{gave a speech}} to his men, {{encouraging}} them for the coming battle. He then assigned Pekë Emmanuali and Peter Engjëlli, Pal Engjëlli's brother, as commanders of a 500-man troop of cavalry where <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> approach the gates of Ohrid and provoke the Ottomans to attack. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> throw smoke and dust into the air to irritate the garrison. Then <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> feign retreat where the pursuing Ottoman cavalry would be ambushed by the main Albanian force. On 14 or 15 September, everything went as planned and the trap was sprung. Skanderbeg's assault came out and killed 10,000 Ottoman men and captured twelve Ottoman units, among them Şeremet's son. The Ottoman forces were pursued by the Venetian forces alongside the Albanians. The Albanian-Venetian losses were few.|$|E

5|$|For Commander-in-Chief of the Luftwaffe Hermann Göring it was {{an ongoing}} concern that {{inadequate}} numbers of fighters were able to continually engage the bomber streams, {{at the very time}} that the USAAF's 8th Air Force's new commander, Maj. Gen. Jimmy Doolittle had instituted a new fighter strategy against the Luftwaffe. Hence on 23 February 1944 — near the midpoint of the USAAF's Big Week bomber offensive against the Luftwaffe, also being carried out by the 15th Air Force flying out of Italian bases — Generalmajor Joseph Schmid Commander of I. Jagdkorps established a new rule for the fighters returning to base. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> arrive at the nearest designated fighter airfield for resupply instead of returning to their own base. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> be commanded by the senior pilot landing on that airfield, irrespective of their unit.

5000|$|The {{original}} {{business of}} the censorship was at first of a much more limited kind, and was restricted almost entirely to taking the census, but the possession of this power gradually brought with it fresh power and new duties, as is shown below.
