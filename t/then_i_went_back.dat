2500|$|Morton Feldman's I Met Heine on the Rue Fürstemberg was {{inspired}} by a vision he had of the dead Heine as he walked through Heine's old neighborhood in Paris: [...] "One early morning in Paris I was walking along the small street on the Left Bank where Delacroix's studio is, just as {{it was more than a}} century ago. I'd read his journals, where he tells of Chopin, going for a drive, the poet Heine dropping in, a refugee from Germany. Nothing had changed in the street. And I saw Heine up at the corner, walking toward me. He almost reached me. I had this intense feeling for him, you know, the Jewish exile. I saw him. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> to my place and wrote my work, I Met Heine on the Rue Fürstemberg." ...|$|E
60|$|And <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> {{and took}} Ajor {{in my arms}} and kissed the tears from her eyes and a smile to her lips while {{together}} we watched the last of the Americans disappear into the forest.|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{not think}} so. I believe it {{to have been a}} plot in order that the man might get rid of his wife. But I {{believed}} it. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> to St. Louis,--and we were married." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{jumps up}} and shakes Andy's hand for five minutes, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>goes</b> <b>back</b> to Mrs. Trotter and tells her, and she cries as hard for joy as she did for sorrow.|$|R
5000|$|If {{you agree}} with it, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> will <b>go</b> <b>back</b> with them. (Thieberger, 2006, p.116) ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> to the fireplace, and {{did some}} more thinking. There was no sense in supposing that they had made a mistake. They all knew this restaurant, and they all knew the time. In a moment, I said to myself: ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> to {{the point}} to measure the tracks, and to {{estimate}} how big the bear was, and to console myself {{with the thought of}} how I would certainly have had him, if something had not interfered--which is the philosophy of all hunters since Esau.|$|E
60|$|I {{took the}} letter {{over to the}} Mountain Valley road and watched for a messenger. By and by a colored equestrian came along on horseback, riding toward Edenville. I gave him a dollar to take {{the letter to the}} {{railroad}} offices; and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> to camp.|$|E
60|$|Charlie Ward. In earnest! <b>Then</b> when <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> I'll commit Paddy Cockfight {{to prison}} for hitting me yesterday.|$|R

6000|$|... "Do not be scare, {{for poor}} man he make no harm. He jus' try a goozle--no dare shoot here in town. <b>Then</b> come; <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> with you." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{light from}} the big window fell right on the picture. I took {{a good look at}} it. Then I shifted a bit nearer and took another look. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> to where I had been at first, because it hadn't seemed quite so bad from there.|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> to my room, and {{was only}} {{just in time to}} catch Theodore calmly {{pocketing}} the hundred-franc note which my fair client had left on the table. I secured the note and I didn't give him a black eye, for it was no use putting him in a bad temper when there was so much to do.|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> and sat by {{the fire}} feeling most miserable and staring at the decanters, for {{never in my life}} do I {{remember}} wanting a bottle of wine more. The big clock ticked and ticked and at last chimed the quarter, jarring on my nerves in that great lonely banqueting hall. Then I rose and crept upstairs like an evil-doer {{and it seemed to me}} that the servants in the hall looked on me with suspicion, as well they might.|$|E
5000|$|... "When I am {{in between}} records, {{sometimes}} I doubt myself. I'll be like 'Did I just get lucky, or did I mass-manipulate {{the world into}} thinking that seven songs were worth a number-one position?' And <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> into the studio and I start writing, and the true essential oil of who I am comes bubbling back up and reminds me that it's always been inside of me, that nobody can take this away no matter what comment anyone makes." [...] —Perry on her confidence as a songwriter ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Most likely {{we are too}} {{far away}} for the sound to reach us. We will wait half an hour longer, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> will <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to see if {{anything}} has happened." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'So you will, when you've {{crossed the}} next brook,' said the White Knight. 'I'll see you safe {{to the end}} of the wood--and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> must <b>go</b> <b>back,</b> you know. That's the end of my move.' ...|$|R
60|$|This I wrote, {{and having}} sealed the writing, Cleopatra bade me go find a messenger, {{despatch}} it to Cæsar, and then return. So I went, {{and at the}} door of the tomb I called a soldier who was not on duty, and, giving him money, bade him take the letter to Cæsar. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back,</b> and there in the chamber the three women stood in silence, Cleopatra clinging to the arm of Iras, and Charmion a little apart watching the twain.|$|E
6000|$|... "I took a {{vacation}} when I bought," [...] he explained, [...] "and planted the trees. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> to work an' stayed with it till {{the place was}} cleared. Now I 'm here for keeps, an' soon as the house is finished I'll send for the wife. She's not very well, and it will do her good. We've been planning and working for years {{to get away from}} the city." [...] He stopped in order to give a happy sigh. [...] "And now we're free." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{turned to}} the back door, {{but she was not}} there. [...] "Wait a minute," [...] said I, and I hurried into the house. She was not in the hall. I looked into the large room. She was not there. I went into the parlor, and out upon the front porch. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> into the house to seek some one who might call her. I was even willing to avail myself of the {{services}} of citric acid, for I could not leave that house without speaking to her again.|$|E
6000|$|... "I think not," [...] said Thirlwell. [...] "Very sorry, of course, but there's {{only a week}} of my holiday {{left and}} I have some {{business}} in South Ontario. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> must <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to the bush." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>I</b> {{turned and}} <b>went</b> <b>back</b> to the wagons even more quietly than I had come.|$|R
60|$|Yet three days, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> must <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to the pensionnat. I almost {{numbered}} {{the moments}} of these days upon the clock; fain would I have retarded their flight; but they glided by while I watched them: they were already <b>gone</b> while <b>I</b> yet feared their departure.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's the {{way with}} women. She didn't think I 'ad it in me to be roused. Women of her sort (between ourselves, Tom) don't respect a man until they're a bit afraid of him. So I just broke out to show her. In comes a girl named Jennie, that used to work with her, and her chap. We 'ad {{a bit of a}} row, and I came out 'ere--it was just such another day as this--and I thought it all out. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> and pitched into them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And I {{took with}} me meat and fish, and the lash-marks of Ivan, and I found Kamo-tah no longer groaning, but dead. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> to Nulato, and, behold, {{there was no}} Nulato--only ashes where the great fort had stood, and the bodies of many men. And I saw the Russians come up the Yukon in boats, fresh from the sea, many Russians; and I saw Ivan creep forth from where he lay hid and make talk with them. And the next day I saw Ivan lead them upon {{the trail of the}} tribe. Even now are they upon the trail, and I am here, Negore, but no coward." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'He {{was pointed}} out, and I looked after him, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> to the hospital, and said, [...] "Now, gentlemen, it's not the porter. He's, {{unfortunately}} for himself, {{a little too}} fond of drink, but he's nothing worse. My suspicion is, that these robberies are committed {{by one of the}} students; and if you'll put me a sofa into that room where the pegs are - as there's no closet - I think I shall be able to detect the thief. I wish the sofa, if you please, to be covered with chintz, or something of that sort, so that I may lie on my chest, underneath it, without being seen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ahuh! That's {{the reward}} {{of people who}} worry an' work for others. Well, <b>then,</b> <b>I</b> reckon I'll <b>go</b> <b>back</b> an' not give you what I brought." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You're awful good, aunt Dorcas,--you're {{the best}} woman I ever saw, an' I wouldn't think of hangin' 'round here if I couldn't do somethin' more'n run {{that little bit}} of a garden. Things will get {{straightened}} out, after a spell, an' <b>then</b> <b>I</b> can <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to town, where I'm certain of earnin' money." ...|$|R
5000|$|Later {{the narrator}} meets {{the couple in}} Yalta. It transpires {{that the only reason}} for Ariadna's {{decision}} to return to Russia was the fact that prince Maktuyev was there. Shamokhin (who is now is virtually broke) is rapturous: [...] "Oh, Lord... If she hits it off with the prince, it means freedom, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> can <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to the country with my father!" ...|$|R
60|$|I refused laughingly, {{and spent}} {{at least an hour}} walking up and down through the cool dimness that hung over the track to {{dissipate}} the excitement of a day of varied emotions. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> to our shanty and slept soundly, until about daybreak I was partly wakened by the feasters returning with discordant songs, though I promptly went to sleep again. I never heard exactly what happened in the wooden town that night, but there was wreckage in its streets the next morning, and when I opened my eyes the first thing I saw was our partner Johnston slumbering peacefully with his head among the fragments of his shattered banjo.|$|E
60|$|Allen had {{recovered}} strength enough {{by this time}} to reach his den with little assistance. He made me beat up the white {{of one of the}} eggs with a little turpentine, which was probably, under the circumstances, the best styptic for his malady within his reach. I lit his fire of peats, undressed him, put him to bed, and made him as comfortable as might be in the den which he had chosen. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> to the shepherd's, sent a messenger to the nearest doctor, and procured a kind of sledge, generally used for dragging peat home, wherein, with abundance of blankets for covering, I hoped to bring Allen back to the shepherd's cottage.|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> as {{softly as}} I had come, but still I could not sleep; the sight {{and thought of}} dear Leo lying there so ill had but added fuel to the fire of my unrest. My wearied body and overstrained mind awakened all my {{imagination}} into preternatural activity. Ideas, visions, almost inspirations, floated before it with startling vividness. Most of them were grotesque enough, some were ghastly, some recalled thoughts and sensations that had for years been buried in the débris of my past life. But, behind and above them all, hovered the shape of that awful woman, and through them gleamed {{the memory of her}} entrancing loveliness. Up and down the cave I strode--up and down.|$|E
5000|$|In a 1994 {{interview}} with The Paris Review, Gottlieb described {{his need to}} [...] "surrender" [...] to a book. [...] "The more you have surrendered," [...] he said, [...] "the more jarring its errors appear. I read a manuscript very quickly, the moment I get it. I usually won't use a pencil the first time through because I'm just reading for impressions. When I read the end, I'll call the writer and say, I think it's very fine (or whatever), but I think there are problems here and here. At that point I don't know why I think that—I just think it. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> and read the manuscript again, more slowly, and I find and mark the places where I had negative reactions {{to try to figure}} out what's wrong. The second time through I think about solutions—maybe this needs expanding, maybe there's too much of this so it's blurring that.|$|R
6000|$|... "Had Father Nevin {{trusted to}} my honor, I {{would not have}} run away; but he locked me in, like a monk in a cell, and that I will not bear. Just one hour, Yvonne, one little hour of freedom, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> will <b>go</b> <b>back,</b> else {{there will be no}} sport for me to-morrow," [...] said the lad, {{recklessly}} pulling up the bluets that starred the grass about him.|$|R
6000|$|... "What a pity! But, John, I {{should be}} forced to leave you {{directly}} after breakfast. Come down--come down at two, or three; and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> will <b>go</b> <b>back</b> with you to Aunt Penelope. I must see her to-morrow;" [...] and so at last the matter was settled, and the happy Captain, as he left her, was hardly resisted in his attempt to press her lips to his own.|$|R
