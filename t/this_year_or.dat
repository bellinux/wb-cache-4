25|$|After {{the death}} of Sir James, Mac Fhirbhisigh may have {{travelled}} to Gort, seeking patronage from Diarmuid Ó Seachnasaigh (Sir Dermot O Shaughnessey), as indicated by a poem he apparently composed in 1667. It is thought that also in <b>this</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> shortly after he obtained {{a copy of the}} important early Irish law tract, Senchas Már. It seems he also travelled to Larne in County Antrim, seeking patronage from Randall MacDonnell, Marquess of Antrim. Here it seems he left or sold about twelve or more manuscripts to a local bard, Eoin Ó Gnímh.|$|E

500|$|In 2006, Montville {{noted that}} more {{books have been}} written about Ruth than any other member of the Baseball Hall of Fame. At least five of these books (including Creamer's and Wagenheim's) were written in 1973 and 1974. The books were timed to {{capitalize}} on the increase in public interest in Ruth as Henry Aaron approached his career home run mark, which he broke on April 8, 1974. As he approached Ruth's record, Aaron stated, [...] "I can't remember a day <b>this</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> last when I did not hear the name of Babe Ruth." ...|$|E

As a result of what Liz said, Kenneth breaks the fourth wall, a term used when a character in a television show, film or on stage directly addresses the audience, when he glances down at the logo.|$|E
500|$|Gene Siskel {{described}} it as the [...] "finest contemporary war film I've seen, supplanting Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan from earlier <b>this</b> <b>year,</b> <b>or</b> even Oliver Stone's Platoon from 1986." [...] A more subdued Roger Ebert gave it three stars, saying that it felt confused and unfinished. He wrote, [...] "The movie's schizophrenia keeps it from greatness (this film has no firm {{idea of what it}} is about), but doesn't make it bad. It is, in fact, sort of fascinating... The battle scenes themselves are masterful, in creating a sense of the geography of a particular hill, the way it is defended by Japanese bunkers, {{the ways in which the}} American soldiers attempt to take it ... Actors like Sean Penn, John Cusack, Jim Caviezel and Ben Chaplin find the perfect tone for scenes of a few seconds or a minute, and then are dropped before a rhythm can be established".|$|E
500|$|Filming for the Superman Returns sequel was {{to start}} in mid-2007, before Singer halted {{development}} in favor of Valkyrie. Filming was then pushed to March 2008, but writers Dougherty and Dan Harris left in favor of other career opportunities. The 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike pushed the release date to 2010. Singer still listed the sequel as a priority in March 2008, saying that the film was in early development. Routh expected filming to begin in early 2009. Paul Levitz, president of DC Comics, expected Routh to reprise the title role from Superman Returns before his contract for a sequel expired in 2009. However, with Warner Bros. deciding to reboot the film series, Singer dropped {{out in favor of}} directing Jack the Giant Slayer. In August 2008, Warner Bros. President of Production Jeff Robinov reflected, [...] "Superman Returns didn't quite work as a film in the way that we wanted it to. It didn't position the character the way he needed to be positioned. Had Superman worked in 2006, we would have had a movie for Christmas of <b>this</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> 2009. Now the plan is just to reintroduce Superman without regard to a Batman and Superman movie at all." ...|$|E

500|$|In August 2008, Warner Bros. {{suggested}} a reboot {{of the film}} series. Studio executive Jeff Robinov planned to have the film released either by 2010 or 2011, explaining [...] "Superman Returns didn't quite work as a film {{in the way that}} we wanted it to. It didn't position the character the way he needed to be positioned. Had Superman worked in 2006, we would have had a movie for Christmas of <b>this</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> 2009.

He elaborated, [...] "Everyone is waiting for Nolan to sign on for another Batman, once that happens, the release date for Superman and all other future projects will follow." [...] In February 2009, McG, who previously planned to direct Superman: Flyby, expressed interest in returning to the Superman franchise. August 2009 saw a court ruling in which Jerry Siegel's family recaptured 50% of the rights to Superman's origins and Siegel's share of the copyright in Action Comics#1. In addition, a judge ruled that Warner Bros. did not owe the families additional royalties from previous films. However, if they did not begin production on a Superman film by 2011, then the Siegel estate {{would have been able to}} sue for lost revenue on an unproduced film.|$|E
500|$|Warner Bros. {{commissioned}} {{husband and}} wife duo Michele and Kieran Mulroney to write a script for a Justice League film in February 2007, halting development for the Superman Returns sequel. The Justice League script was submitted to Warner Bros. the following June, which prompted the studio to immediately fast track production. Singer went on to film Valkyrie the following month, and George Miller signed to direct Justice League: Mortal in September 2007. The script would have featured a different Superman in a separate continuity from Singer's film; Routh was not approached to reprise his role for Justice League: Mortal, which ended up going to D. J. Cotrona. The film nearly went into production in March 2008, but the Australian Film Commission denied Warner Bros. their 40 percent tax rebate and Catrona's options eventually expired. With Justice League: Mortal canceled, Singer renewed {{his interest in the}} Superman sequel that same month, stating that it was in early development. Paul Levitz, president of DC Comics, still expected Routh to reprise the title role, but Routh's contract for a sequel expired in 2009.
