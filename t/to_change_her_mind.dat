500|$|Stone and Ream's model {{received}} the most praise. [...] Stone's model was praised by several naval officers who called it [...] "true to life" [...] and [...] "unsurpassed by similar works." [...] Ream's model received praise from several high profile individuals, most notably President Ulysses S. Grant, who called it [...] "first rate". [...] Admiral David Dixon Porter said the model [...] "of Miss Vinnie Ream is the only likeness in the lot." [...] General William Tecumseh Sherman, who was reportedly infatuated with Ream, also became a strong advocate for her model. [...] He wrote to the committee that [...] "the plaster model of Vinnie Ream struck me decidedly as the best likeness, and recalled {{the memory of the}} Admiral's face and figure more perfectly than any other model there on exhibition." [...] The decision by the committee ultimately ended in a three-way tie between Ream, Stone, and MacDonald. [...] The project stalled until the next Congress convened in 1874. [...] A commission to select the winning model was created and consisted of Virginia, Sherman, and Secretary of the Navy George M. Robeson. [...] Virginia and Sherman voted to approve Ream's design, though Robeson refused to accept the result and tried in vain to convince Virginia <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind.</b> [...] Two months after the vote, Robeson relented and Ream's model was officially selected.|$|E
500|$|The Doctor, {{unable to}} leave the TARDIS due to the plague, gives Rory the lens, his sonic screwdriver, {{and a pair of}} glasses through which the Doctor can see and {{communicate}} with Rory.

Though Rory considers saving the older Amy, the Doctor warns him that by taking her aboard the TARDIS, they will forgo any chance of rescuing the younger Amy. The Doctor discovers evidence of younger Amy nearby, and instructs Rory to use the lens to communicate with her, hoping that seeing the younger, crying Amy will convince the older one to help with the rescue.
