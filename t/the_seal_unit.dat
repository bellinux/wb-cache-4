50|$|Coalition {{military}} planners {{were concerned that}} retreating Iraqi forces would destroy the Mukatayin hydroelectric dam, located 57 miles northeast of Baghdad, {{in an attempt to}} slow advancing US troops. In addition to restricting the manoeuvre of Coalition forces, the destruction of the dam would deny critical power needs to the surrounding area, as well as cause massive flooding and loss of Iraqi civilian life. A mixed team of SEALs from SEAL Team 5 and Polish GROM was called in to seize the dam. This force was flown several hours by 6 US Air Force MH-53J Pave Lows, the force consisted of 20 SEALs (with an extra six SEAL snipers in one helicopter carrying the SEAL command and control element) and two EOD operators along with 35 GROM operators to the dam. The SEALs employed DPVs into blocking positions to defend against counter-attack and roving bands of Iranian bandits that had been crossing the border and raiding Iraqi towns. As in Al Faw the SEALs found their DPVs (<b>the</b> <b>SEAL</b> <b>unit</b> at the al-Faw MMS lost all but two DPVs when the were bogged down in the oily mud) to be ineffective and this marked the last time they would employ them in Iraq. The SEALs and GROM on foot fast-roped out of their helicopters and immediately stormed the dam. The minimal Iraqi troops guarding the dam surrendered without a fight, and {{with the exception of a}} GROM soldier who broke an ankle during the insertion, no casualties were sustained in the operation. After several hours of searching the dam for remaining hostile forces or any explosives, the SEALs secured the dam and held it for 5 days until they were relieved by advancing elements of the US Army.|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY: Subsurface 3 D {{geological}} {{models of}} aquifer and seal rock systems from two contrasting analogue sites {{have been created}} {{as the first step}} in an investigation into methodologies for geological storage of carbon dioxide in saline aquifers. Development of the models illustrates the utility of an integrated approach using digital techniques and expert geological knowledge to further geological understanding. The models visualize a faulted, gently dipping Permo-Triassic succession in Lincolnshire and a complex faulted and folded Devono-Carboniferous succession in eastern Scotland. The Permo-Triassic is present in the Lincolnshire model to depths of 2 km OD, and includes the aquifers of the Sherwood Sandstone and Rotliegendes groups. Model-derived thickness maps test and refine Permian palaeogeography, such as the location of a carbonate reef and its associated seaward slope, and the identification of aeolian dunes. Analysis of borehole core samples established average 2 D porosity values for the Rotliegendes (16 %) and Sherwood Sandstone (20 %) groups, and the Zechstein (5 %) and Mercia Mudstone (< 10 %) groups, which are favourable for aquifer and seal units respectively. Core sample analysis has revealed a complex but well understood diagenetic history. Re-interpretation of newly reprocessed seismic data in eastern Scotland has significantly reduced interpretative uncertainty of aquifer and seal units at depths of up to 6 km OD in a complex faulted and folded Devonian-Carboniferous succession. Synthesis of diverse data in the 3 D geological model defines a set of growth folds and faults indicative of active VisÃ©an to Westphalian dextral-strike slip, with no major changes in structural style throughout the Carboniferous, in contrast to some published tectonic models. Average 2 D porosity values are 14 - 17 % in aquifer units and < 2 % in <b>the</b> <b>seal</b> <b>unit,</b> with a ferroan dolomite cement occluding porosity at depth...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. Experimental {{research}} of technical state change in metal-metal <b>sealing</b> <b>units</b> of pneumatic valve with two-positioned polarized electromagnetic drive. Design/methodology/approach. It {{has been shown}} that the work peculiarity of pneumatic valves with two-positioned electromagnetic drive and with metal-metal sealing is shock loads during its closure and opening. Such loads lead to intensive wearing process and increasing of gas leakage through <b>the</b> <b>sealing</b> <b>units</b> of different design and made of different materials. It has been experimentally confirmed, that the effective way of wear intensiveness decreasing in metal-metal <b>sealing</b> <b>units</b> is <b>the</b> use of special damping units in the valve Findings. As a result of experimental research it was concluded that including in the valve design of special damping device reduces the stress in <b>the</b> <b>sealing</b> <b>unit</b> elements, which occurs in <b>the</b> <b>sealing</b> <b>units</b> elements during <b>the</b> valve closing, and, as a result, the wear intensiveness of <b>the</b> <b>sealing</b> <b>unit</b> decreases.

40|$|Both {{panes of}} factory-sealed double-glazing units are {{susceptible}} to thermal breakage. The outer pane experiences large thermally induced stresses when solar radiation falls on <b>the</b> <b>sealed</b> <b>unit</b> in cool weather.

The Yeoh model can use the uniaxial tensile test to simulate the mechanical behavior of rubber materials under a large deformation, but it is not suitable for moderate and small deformations. The Gent model can simulate the strain energy of the rubber materials under a large deformation which is mainly applied to thin-walled spheres, hollow rubber and thin-walled cylindrical tubular bodies subjected to an internal pressure, but it is also not suitable for small and moderate deformations. The MooneyâRivlin model can fit the relationship between the stress and strain of the incompressible rubber materials in moderate deformation.

The infrastructure for injecting carbon dioxide will need to be an order of magnitude larger than current CCS projects, at comparable size of existing petroleum installations. In most cases, the CO 2 injection scheme will consist of multiple wells, potentially including wells for monitoring and pressure control. Despite the advanced understanding of subsurface flow processes and development of modelling tools, there are still conflicting results in the literature on the estimation of pressure build-up, the resulting number of injection wells required for large-scale CO 2 geological storage and storage efficiency.

Potential trade-offs with respect to costs for transport and reservoir stimulation need consideration. Also, strategies and contingencies will need to be incorporated in development plans to allow for unforeseen changes in injection conditions during project life. Continuously updating reservoir models when new data become available and adapting injection strategies will be essential for the success of large-scale CO 2 geological storage...|$|R

40|$|The Torre Alfina {{geothermal}} field is located about 10 km {{north of the}} Quaternary Bolsena caldera. The reservoir is a buried structural high made of Mesozoic-Cenozoic carbonatic sequences characterised by discontinuous secondary permeability and sealed by clay-rich alloctonous syn-orogenic flysch successions and Pliocene neo-authoctonous marine clays. The reservoir is locally highly productive, water-dominated and CO 2 -rich, with T at its top of 120 degrees C. The origin of the heat source was not investigated in detail but generally attributed to some unidentified deep magmatic body. Our field structural data document fracturing and faulting that affect both the reservoir and <b>the</b> <b>seal</b> <b>units</b> with dominant NE-SW and a subordinate E-W as maximum extension directions. The surface pattern and kinematics indicate that fault systems {{are part of the}} Pliocene-Quaternary tectonic episode in Central Italy, where strike-slip kinematics transfers deformation between main extensional shear zones. The fault network controls intense hydrothermal manifestations and travertine deposition north of the Torre Alfina area. 230 Th/ 234 U dating allows distinguishing three different stages of hydrothermal pulses bracketed between 200 and 90 ka. To improve the current understanding of the geometry and density of subsurface fracture system we applied the Shear Wave Splitting (SWS) technique studying the waveforms from local microearthquakes recorded in the area from 2008 to 2011. The analysis of SWS provides parameters directly related to the strike of the subsurface fluid-filled fractures and their density. According to the extensive-dilatancy anisotropy hypothesis (Crampin, 1984) SWS is generated by propagation through distributions of fluid-filled cracks, microcracks, and preferentially oriented pore space aligned according to the active stress field in the area. The analysis was made using the software ANISOMAT and gives a major direction NW-SE. The results agree both with structural data and with the focal mechanism of the earthquakes collected in the area between years 1977 and 1992. From the analysis on the crack density our data gives as result a good index of fracture for the reservoirâs rocks. Based on the updated conceptual model we performed numerical simulations in TOUGH 2 code. Results indicate that deep circulation is forced by the geometry of the reservoir and by T and P gradients. We interpret the Torre Alfina field as a "blind" system, formed dominantly by lateral advection of heat and mass from the Bolsena caldera deep system driven both by high T and by the greater depth at which reservoir rocks are downthrown by the volcano-tectonic collapse. Preferential fracture fabric in the deep carbonates allows the lateral heat transfer.

40|$|A {{system for}} human waste {{collection}} is described and evaluated {{on the basis}} of a prototype employed for the shuttle flight STS- 35. The manually operated version of the unit is designed to collect, compact, and store human waste and cleaning material in replaceable volumes. The system is presented with illustrations and descriptions of the disposable pads that are used to clean the cylinder and occlusive air valves as well as <b>seal</b> <b>the</b> <b>unit.</b> Temporary retention and waste entrainment are provided by the variable airflow in the manual unit tested. The prototype testing indicates that sufficient airflow is achieved at 45 CFM and that the stowage volume (18. 7 cu in.) is adequate for storing human waste with minimal logistical support. Higher compaction pressure and the use of a directed airstream are proposed for improving the packing efficiency of the unit...|$|R
