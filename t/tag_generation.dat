This raises the efficiency of garbage collection, as older objects tend to have longer lifetimes than newer objects. Thus, by eliminating older (and thus more likely to survive a collection) objects from the scope of a collection run, fewer objects need checking and compacting.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Proofs {{of storage}} (POR or PDP) is a {{cryptographic}} tool, which enables data owner or third party auditor to audit integrity of data stored remotely {{in a cloud}} storage server, without keeping a local copy of data or downloading data back during auditing. We observe that all existing publicly verifiable POS schemes suffer from a serious drawback: It is extremely slow to compute authentication tags for all data blocks, due to many expensive group exponentiation operations. Surprisingly, it is even much slower than typical network uploading speed, and becomes the bottleneck of the setup phase of the POS scheme. We propose a new variant formulation called “Delegatable Proofs of Storage”. In this new relaxed formulation, {{we are able to}} construct a POS scheme, which on one side is as efficient as private key POS schemes, {{and on the other side}} can support third party auditor and can switch auditors at any time, close to the functionalities of publicly verifiable POS schemes. Compared to traditional publicly verifiable POS schemes, we speed up the <b>tag</b> <b>generation</b> process by at least several hundred times, without sacrificing efficiency in any other aspect. Like many existing schemes, we can also speed up our <b>tag</b> <b>generation</b> process by N times using N CPU cores in parallel. We prove that our scheme is sound under Bilinear Strong Diffie-Hellman Assumption, and it is privacy preserving against auditor under Discrete Log Assumption. Both proofs are given in standard model. ...|$|E

40|$|Due to {{increasing}} accumulation of textual {{data on the}} World Wide Web, tag cloud has become an effective tool to quickly perceive the most prominent terms embedded within them. Tag clouds help to grasp the main theme of a corpus without exploring the pile of documents. However, the effectiveness of tag clouds to conceptualize text corpora is directly proportional {{to the quality of}} the tags extracted from them. In this paper, we propose a keyphrase-based <b>tag</b> cloud <b>generation</b> framework to conceptualize textual data. In contrast to existing <b>tag</b> cloud <b>generation</b> systems that use single words as tags and their frequency counts to determine the font size of the tags, the proposed framework identifies feasible keyphrases and uses them as tags. The font-size of a keyphrase is determined as a function of its relevance weight. Instead of using partial or full parsing, which is inefficient for lengthy sentences and inaccurate for the sentences that do not follow proper grammatical structure, the proposed method applies n-gram techniques followed by various heuristics-based refinements to identify candidate phrases from text documents. A rich set of lexical and semantic features are identified to characterize the candidate phrases and determine their keyphraseness and relevance weights. We also propose a font-size determination function, which utilizes the relevance weights of the keyphrases to determine their relative font size for tag cloud visualization. The efficacy of the proposed framework is established through experimentation and its comparison with the existing state-of-the-art <b>tag</b> cloud <b>generation</b> methods...|$|R

We identified a bug in that implementation, and made sure it was quickly fixed before trickling into an official OpenSSL trunk. Here, we use this (already fixed) bug as a real example that demonstrates the fragility of AES-GCM’s authentication algorithm (GHASH). One might expect that incorrect MAC <b>tag</b> <b>generation</b> would only cause legitimate message-tag pairs to fail authentication (which is already a serious problem). However, since GHASH is a “polynomial evaluation ” MAC, the bug can be exploited for actual message forgery...|$|E

The tag cloud is a popular way of visualizing the information in a collaborative tagging system. In this thesis, we have pointed to limitations of the first <b>generation</b> <b>tag</b> cloud as an information visualization interface. By examining the users of a tag cloud and the way they employ it to retrieve information, we have examined these limitations.

Unfortunately, the dynamic traf-fic modifications they induce {{make it difficult}} to reason about network management tasks such as access control, accounting, and diagnostics. This also makes it difficult to integrate middleboxes into SDN-capable networks and leverage the benefits that SDN can offer. In response, we develop the FlowTags architecture. FlowTags-enhanced middleboxes export tags to provide the necessary causal context (e. g., source hosts or in-ternal cache/miss state). SDN controllers can configure the <b>tag</b> <b>generation</b> and tag consumption operations using new FlowTags APIs. These operations help restore two key SDN tenets: (i) bindings between packets and their “origins, ” and (ii) ensuring that packets follow policy-mandated paths. We develop new controller mechanisms that leverage FlowTags. We show the feasibility of minimally extend-ing middleboxes to support FlowTags. We also show that FlowTags imposes low overhead over traditional SDN mechanisms. Finally, we demonstrate the early promise of FlowTags in enabling new verification and diagnosis capabilities. ...|$|E

40|$|Dynamic Proof of Storage (PoS) is {{a useful}} {{cryptographic}} primitive that enables a user to check the integrity of outsourced files and to efficiently update the files in a cloud server. Although researchers have proposed many dynamic PoS schemes in single user environments, the problem in multi-user environments has not been investigated sufficiently. A practical multi-user cloud storage system needs the secure client-side cross-user deduplication technique, which allows a user to skip the uploading process and obtain the ownership of the files immediately, when other owners of the same files have uploaded them to the cloud server. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, none of the existing dynamic PoSs can support this technique. In this paper, we introduce the concept of deduplicatable dynamic proof of storage and propose an efficient construction called DeyPoS, to achieve dynamic PoS and secure cross-user deduplication, simultaneously.

40|$|This paper aims {{to propose}} a fast image searching method from {{environmental}} observation images even {{in the presence of}} scale changes. A new scheme has been proposed for extracting feature areas as tags based on a robust image registration algorithm called Orientation code matching. Extracted tags are stored as reference images and utilized in tag searching. As the number of tags grows, the searching cost becomes a serious problem. Additionally, change in viewing positions cause scale change of an image and matching failure. In our scheme, richness in features is important for <b>tag</b> <b>generation</b> and the entropy is used to evaluate the diversity of edge directions which are stable to scale change of the image. This characteristic contributes to limitation of searching area and reduction in calculation costs. Scaling factors are estimated by orientation code density which means the percentage of effective codes in fixed size tag areas. An estimated scaling factor is applied to matching a scale of reference images to one of observation images. Some experiments are performed in order to compare computation time and verify effectiveness of estimated scaling factor using real scenes. ...|$|E

However, in stationary phase cells, and in growing cells treated with rifampicin, L 1 -BFP was distributed throughout the cells, in contrast to cells treated with chloramphenicol, in which ribosomes still localized around nucleoids. These data show that specific localization of ribosomes is not due to nucleoid exclusion, but is a dynamic process due to active synthesis of RNA. Dual labelling of ribosomes and cold shock proteins (CSPs) tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP) revealed colocalization of both protein classes.
