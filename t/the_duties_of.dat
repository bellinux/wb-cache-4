40|$|Most {{people would}} {{acknowledge}} <b>the</b> importance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> loyalty, but <b>the</b> same {{is not true}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> care. Historically, <b>the</b> corporate law <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> care has been underenforced at best, and arguably unenforced entirely. Some scholars do not consider <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> care to be a fiduciary duty at all, {{and there are those}} who would do away with it entirely. In this paper, I intend to provide a comprehensive defense of the corporate law fiduciary <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> care. I hope to show that <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> care is not simply an ill-fitting appendage to <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> loyalty, but rather an essential aspect of the singular fiduciary concept that also encompasses <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> loyalty. Simply put, a fiduciary has <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> to act {{in the interests of the}} beneficiary in all relevant respects. Once the breadth of this singular fiduciary concept is properly understood, it is revealed to be much more than any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> individual <b>duties</b> that it comprises. Far from being streamlined or focused, fiduciary law would be impoverished if it were limited to <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> loyalty. However, I do not intend to argue for a more robust <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> care. Rather, I will defend <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> care as it currently exists in corporate law (more or less) — deliberately and advisedly underenforced, but not entirely unenforced. <b>The</b> <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> care works in the corporate context precisely because caution is built into the enforcement equation...|$|R

40|$|Under {{well-established}} {{principles of}} nonprofit corporation law, {{a board member}} must meet certain standards of conduct and attention in carrying out his or her responsibilities to the organization. Several states have statutes adopting some variation <b>of</b> these <b>duties</b> which would be used in court {{to determine whether a}} board member acted improperly. These standards are usually described as <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> care, <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> loyalty, and <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> obedience. <b>Duty</b> <b>of</b> Care <b>The</b> <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> care describes <b>the</b> level of competence that is expected of a board member and is commonly expressed as <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> "care that an ordinarily prudent person would exercise in a like position and under similar circumstances. " This means that a board member owes <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> to exercise reasonable care when he or she makes a decision as a steward <b>of</b> <b>the</b> organization. <b>Duty</b> <b>of</b> Loyalty <b>The</b> <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> loyalty is a standard of faithfulness; a board member must give undivided allegiance when making decisions affecting the organization.

40|$|This article {{proposes a}} means of {{improving}} the at-will world for employees—insofar as that world includes {{the threat of a}} sudden end to one’s livelihood—that does not tamper with the “at-will-ness” of termination itself. An at-will employee should owe only <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> “good faith and fair dealing” derived from contract law, which, in effect, would fill any hole left in the legal web defining the employment relationship when <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> loyalty is excised. Part II of this article provides an overview <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> loyalty as it is applied by the courts in the various states. Part III returns to various aspects of the law regarding <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> loyalty that are particularly ambiguous and argues the ambiguity infects the very validity <b>of</b> imposing a <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> loyalty and renders it very difficult for employers and employees to understand and comply with <b>the</b> <b>duty.</b> Part IV illustrates why the jurisprudential provenance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> loyalty—emanating from <b>the</b> medieval doctrine of master and servant—understandably does not map clearly onto the twenty-first-century global employment market.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a {{comparison}} between <b>the</b> Czech <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> due managerial care {{of a member of}} governing body of limited company and <b>the</b> Irish non-fiduciary <b>duty</b> to exercise care, skill and diligence of a director of limited company (hereinafter also referred as "duty of care").

40|$|The nonprofit {{sector and}} matters of nonprofit {{governance}} {{have been in}} the national spotlight much of late. One area of heightened interest is directors of healthcare entities regularly serving on the board of more than one healthcare organization. Even when board membership of related entities is relatively independent, one corporation 2 ̆ 7 s business plan frequently is affected (or even controlled) by the business needs of a separately incorporated parent, affiliate, or other related organization. Very little case law addresses 2 ̆ 2 interlocking 2 ̆ 2 directorates for nonprofit board members, and the case law that does exist tends to address narrow, fact-based state law interpretive issues rather than elucidating the nature and scope <b>of</b> fiduciary <b>duties.</b> <b>The</b> result is that the doctrine in this area is severely underdeveloped. State statutes and supplementary guidance documents such as the Revised Model Nonprofit Corporation Act provide little insight as well. Within this vacuum, considerable tension exists between the modern reality of overlapping boards, which often occur due to integration of healthcare entities into 2 ̆ 2 delivery systems, 2 ̆ 2 and the traditional doclarge trine <b>of</b> fiduciary <b>duties,</b> which contemplates that directors will serve only one corporation. It is a long-standing principle of corporate law that directors owe fiduciary <b>duties</b> to <b>the</b> corporation(s) on whose boards they sit. Nonprofit directors 2 ̆ 7 fiduciary <b>duties</b> are threefold: <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> care, <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> loyalty, and <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> obedience. <b>The</b> <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> care requires directors to act in an informed, careful manner in their decisionmaking. <b>The</b> <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> loyalty commands directors to act without self-interest, in good faith, and {{in the best interests of}} the corporation at all times. <b>The</b> <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> obedience obliges directors to ensure that the charitable mission of the corporation is carried out and to obey laws relevant to the organization. While <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> care and <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> loyalty are well established, <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> obedience is a more recent development and not fully incorporated into the canon <b>of</b> nonprofit fiduciary <b>duties...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{fact that}} a <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> loyalty within <b>the</b> Swedish company law exists should be {{regarded}} as indisputable according to the Swedish doctrine, but its content and scope is however more severe identified. As <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> loyalty is not regulated in the ABL and {{the fact that there are}} not many precedents in this area, means that it is difficult to know the boundaries <b>of</b> <b>the</b> company management´s <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> loyalty. It is also unclear whether <b>the</b> company management´s <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> loyalty to <b>the</b> company also is targeting the shareholders. It is this issue that we intend to discuss in the final chapter of this thesis. In order to answer our questions, we will in chapter two to six give an account of <b>the</b> foundation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> loyalty and thereafter describe <b>the</b> management's <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> loyalty to <b>the</b> company. With these elements as background we will in the final chapter try to answer our problem.

Shareholders with a stake of at least one tenth of all the company's shares should have the same protection from <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> loyalty as <b>the</b> company while minority shareholders with less than one tenth only should be protected by <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> loyalty when it appears in the ABL, the Annual Accounts Act, or the articles of association.
