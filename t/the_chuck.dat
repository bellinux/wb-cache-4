5000|$|The four most {{commonly}} used workholding devices are <b>the</b> three-jaw <b>chuck,</b> <b>the</b> four-jaw <b>chuck,</b> <b>the</b> collet, and the faceplate. <b>The</b> three-jaw <b>chuck</b> is used to hold round or hex workpieces because the work is automatically centered. On these <b>chucks</b> <b>the</b> runout faces limitations; on late-model CNCs, it can be quite low if all conditions are excellent, but traditionally it is usually at least [...]001-.003 in (0.025-0.075 mm). <b>The</b> four-jaw <b>chuck</b> is used either to hold irregular shapes or to hold round or hex to extremely low runout (with time spent indicating and clamping each piece), in both cases because of its independent action on each jaw. The face plate is also used for irregular shapes. Collets combine self-centering chucking with low runout, but they involve higher costs.|$|R

40|$|A {{device was}} {{designed}} and manufactured to precisely cleave silicon wafers. Two vacuum chucks were designed to support a 150 mm diameter silicon wafer and cleave it by providing a pure moment at a pre-etched v-notch while a vacuum was created {{on either side of}} the cut. The design of <b>the</b> vacuum <b>chucks</b> would also accommodate the smaller pieces of the wafer and would allow for the cleaving process to yield 19 mm x 34 mm die. The overall system consisted of three main components: <b>the</b> stationary vacuum <b>chuck,</b> and <b>the</b> pivoting vacuum <b>chuck,</b> and <b>the</b> base plate, which supported <b>the</b> two vacuum <b>chucks.</b> Hinges connected <b>the</b> two vacuum <b>chucks</b> and allowed one to cleave a silicon wafer resting atop <b>the</b> two <b>chucks</b> simply by applying a small load on the handle of <b>the</b> pivoting <b>chuck.</b> <b>The</b> system was manufactured, assembled, and tested to prove its functionality. by Victor Figueroa.
