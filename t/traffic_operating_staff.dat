5000|$|Locomotive 61 002 {{remained}} in Dresden and was employed on passenger train duties. As a one-off it created problems for <b>traffic</b> <b>operating</b> <b>staff.</b> However, for the Test and Development Centre for Engineering (VES-M under Max Baumberg) {{it was of}} interest as a trial engine for speeds over 160 km/h. It was converted in 1961 by the Deutsche Reichsbahn of East Germany at the workshop in Meiningen into a high-speed trials locomotive with a tender and the running number 18 201. With a new-design boiler, outer cylinders from the trials locomotive, H 45 024, and a new welded inner cylinder (the original cylinders were designed for a steam pressure of 20 bar and had too small a bore for the new, 16 bar boiler) and the carrying axle from the high-pressure locomotive, H 45 024, she attained speeds of up to 180 km/h.|$|E

50|$|The first fleet {{consisted}} of 60 Comet chassis fitted with Perkins diesel engines, imported from England. The {{bodies of the}} buses were built by {{the staff of the}} Travancore State Transport Department {{under the supervision of the}} Superintendent. The model for the selection of <b>operating</b> <b>staff</b> continues to be followed by the current <b>operating</b> <b>staff.</b> The Transport Department gave preference in recruitment for those who were likely to lose their private transport company jobs resulting from the nationalization of Thiruvananthapuram - Kanyakumari route. Thus the Transport Department began with a staff of about a hundred graduates appointed as Inspectors and Conductors.|$|R
50|$|Significant {{contributions}} to noise pollution {{are made by}} internal combustion engines. Automobile and truck <b>traffic</b> <b>operating</b> on highways and street systems produce noise, as do aircraft flights due to jet noise, particularly supersonic-capable aircraft.

40|$|Prior to {{beginning}} a 90 -day {{test of a}} regenerative life support system, a need was identified for a training and certification program to qualify an <b>operating</b> <b>staff</b> for conducting the test. The staff was responsible for operating and maintaining the test facility, monitoring and ensuring crew safety, and implementing procedures to ensure effective mission performance with good data collection and analysis. The training program was designed to ensure that each <b>operating</b> <b>staff</b> member was capable of performing his assigned function and was sufficiently cross-trained to serve at certain other positions on a contingency basis. Complicating the training program were budget and schedule limitations, and {{the high level of}} sophistication of test systems...|$|R

50|$|Penn Traffic traces {{its origins}} {{back to the}} 1850s, {{when it was a}} trading post in Johnstown, Pennsylvania. Over the years, Penn Traffic evolved first into a general-merchandise {{department}} store and later a large retail and wholesale supermarket company. Riverside, founded in Brookville, Pennsylvania in 1928, became part of the Penn Traffic family in 1962, and began developing the Bi-Lo format in the 1980s (not related to the chain in the Mid-Atlantic). Penn <b>Traffic</b> <b>operated</b> 43 supermarkets under the Bi-Lo trade name across Pennsylvania, and also distributed food to 51 franchised and independent supermarkets from its DuBois, Pennsylvania distribution facility. Quality Markets, founded in Jamestown, New York in 1913, joined the Penn Traffic family in 1979. Penn <b>Traffic</b> <b>operated</b> a total of 34 supermarkets under the Quality trade name in southwestern New York and northwestern Pennsylvania.|$|R
2500|$|Whitaker {{was acting}} {{chairman}} of the department of physics at New York University until 1942, when he joined the Manhattan Project's Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago during World War II. In September 1942, Arthur Compton asked him to form the nucleus of an <b>operating</b> <b>staff</b> for the X-10 Graphite Reactor that was to be constructed on Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Whitaker became the first director of the Clinton Laboratories, which later became the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. [...] The first permanent <b>operating</b> <b>staff</b> arrived at X-10 from the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago in April 1944, by which time DuPont began transferring its technicians to the site.
