5|$|Potter {{had become}} tired of writing for {{children}} and increasingly unfamiliar with them. The Moore children (for whom she had written several tales early in her career) were grown, and Potter had not replaced them with other children, although she continued to write letters to child fans who had written her. She was {{out of touch with}} the interests of American children. Her marriage to William Heelis on October 15, 1913 effectively ended her literary and artistic career. Although she published sporadically in the years following her marriage, her works depended principally upon decades-old concepts filed away in her publisher's offices and ageing illustrations <b>tucked</b> <b>away</b> in her portfolio. Only The Tale of Johnny Town-Mouse (1918) brought forth a completely new set of illustrations from the artist. She devoted herself to marriage and farming, and avoided publicity and fans.|$|E

25|$|This {{terrestrial}} {{species is}} known for its defense strategy that involves coiling into a tight ball when threatened, with its head and neck <b>tucked</b> <b>away</b> in the middle. In this state, it can literally be rolled around. Favored retreats include mammal burrows and other underground hiding places, where they also aestivate. In captivity, they are considered good pets, with their relatively small size and placid nature making them easy to handle.|$|E

25|$|Char Minor ({{alternatively}} spelled Chor Minor, {{and also}} alternatively {{known as the}} Madrasah of Khalif Niyaz-kul) is a building <b>tucked</b> <b>away</b> in a lane northeast of the Lyabi Hauz complex.

The four towered structure is sometimes mistaken for a gate to the madras that once existed behind the structure, however, the Char-Minar is actually a complex of buildings with two functions, ritual and shelter.|$|E
25|$|The ALRA {{was very}} active between 1936 and 1939 sending {{speakers}} {{around the country}} to talk about Labour and Equal Citizenship and attempted, though most often unsuccessfully, to have letters and articles published in newspapers. They became the most popular when a member of the ALRA’s Medico-Legal Committee received the case of a fourteen-year-old girl who had been raped, and received a termination of this pregnancy from Dr. Joan Malleson, a progenitor of the ALRA. This case gained a lot of publicity, however once the war began, the case was <b>tucked</b> <b>away</b> and the cause again lost its importance to the public.|$|E

25|$|In the {{north-east}} {{corner of}} the quad is the Old Hall, the oldest remaining buildings of Hart Hall, dating from the 1570s. The Old Hall and its adjoining Buttery are now in regular use for dining, especially by the Fellows. Running southwards, along {{the eastern side of}} the quad, is a 17th-century building, with oriel windows <b>tucked</b> <b>away</b> on its southern end. Originally, the portion closest to the Old Hall was student accommodation, and the southern portion was the principal's lodgings. Today the building is mostly taken over by the Senior Common Room, with the northern ground-floor room being the Old Library. In the south-east corner is the 18th-century Cottage, the only one of the planned four 'angles' of Dr Newton that was ever built. Originally, this occupied the entire corner, around to what was the chapel (and is now the library). Its southern side was demolished to make way for Jackson's Chapel.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of a {{postponed}} league fixture at home to Barrow due to snow, which was originally scheduled to be played on 19 December, Borough did not play again in the league again until Boxing Day, away at Cambridge United. Despite going a goal behind early on, Stevenage won the match 31. A Danny Crow penalty in the sixth minute put the hosts in front after Mark Albrighton was deemed to have tugged Chris Holroyd's shirt in the box. Borough responded well and, twenty minutes later, earned a penalty of their own when Yemi Odubade was sliced down in the box. The striker dusted himself down and duly <b>tucked</b> <b>away</b> the spot-kick to draw the visitors level. A minute later, Cambridge were reduced to ten men, when Wayne Hatswell was sent-off for a two-footed lunge on Chris Beardsley. Stevenage took the lead ten minutes into the second-half when Charlie Griffin slotted home from an acute angle, before Chris Beardsley added a third with a neat finish after good work from Ronnie Henry. Two days later, the side drew 00 with AFC Wimbledon at Broadhall Way.|$|E
25|$|Somers {{is perhaps}} best known for its yacht club and sailing facilities. The waters {{offshore}} from Somers, neighbouring Balnarring and Merricks Beaches, Flinders and Shoreham, and the body of water between the Mornington Peninsula and Philip Island {{are some of the most}} ideal and safest regions for sailing of all types in Australia. On most days many sailboats, mainly catamarans, can be seen in the waters of Western Port Bay participating in several races that are held during good sailing conditions, usually on weekends. The tidal inlet of Merricks Creek at low tide is one of the best places around Melbourne and the Mornington Peninsula for skiffle boarding, while the South Beach (actually to the east of the main beach) is <b>tucked</b> <b>away</b> behind the belt of foreshore bushland that is Somers Foreshore Reserve, and is enjoyed mainly by local residents, while the main beach, Somers Beach, is home to one of the major yacht clubs in Western Port, Somers Yacht Club. Walking is also popular in Somers as good quality sealed and unsealed pathways exist along roadsides and in parklands, where walkers enjoy native bush land, wildlife and views of Western Port.|$|E

25|$|When Earthrealm was young, Raiden was its protector. He {{fought the}} rogue Elder God Shinnok, {{who wished to}} {{overthrow}} his fellow gods, in a war that threatened to destroy Earthrealm itself. One of the casualties {{of the war was}} the Saurian civilization (of which Reptile is a descendant), forcing the remaining survivors to emigrate to another world, which they named Zaterra. With the aid of the Elder Gods, Raiden managed to defeat Shinnok, then banished him to the Netherealm and secured Shinnok's amulet of power in a secret location—a Temple of the Elements <b>tucked</b> <b>away</b> in the highest mountains of Nepal. Raiden charged four gods with guarding the amulet—the gods of Wind (Fujin), Fire, Earth and Water. When the elder Sub-Zero stole Shinnok's amulet from the temple for Quan Chi millions of years later, Raiden appeared before the Lin Kuei warrior and instructed him to enter the Netherealm and steal it back, lest Shinnok use it to free himself. Raiden could not retrieve it himself as his powers would dissipate in the Netherealm. Sub-Zero's mission into the Netherealm was a success and Shinnok was, for a time, no longer a threat. Though it was later revealed that the sorcerer Quan Chi had given Sub Zero a false amulet, Raiden never realized the counterfeit and Quan Chi would remain in possession of the true amulet for years.|$|E
500|$|Director Ridley Scott {{originally}} cast Jon Finch as Kane after John Hurt declined {{due to a}} scheduling conflict. Partway through filming, Finch had {{an episode}} of hyperglycemis (from not taking insulin to counter his Coca-Cola intake on set); Scott again asked Hurt, who accepted and replaced Finch {{for the remainder of}} the filming. Kane is most closely associated with the [...] "chestbursting" [...] scene. Before the scene's single take, the actors were given minimal information about its details; according to the screenplay, the [...] "creature emerges". Hurt was connected to a prosthetic body with the exploding Alien prop <b>tucked</b> <b>away</b> with meat and fake blood. When the scene was filmed the cast reacted dramatically, with Veronica Cartwright hit in the mouth with fake blood and falling backwards.|$|E
500|$|Flight Unlimiteds terrain {{graphics}} {{were created}} with stereophotogrammetry. The team gathered aerial photographs from locations in France and the United States. They combined {{two to three}} images of each area to create digital reproductions roughly [...] in size. Each location in the game was based on two stereoscopic sets of photographs, which were processed for more than 72 hours by a [...] "dedicated Pentium <b>tucked</b> <b>away</b> in a dark corner". From the contrasting images, the computer generated a terrain [...] "data blanket" [...] with 3D height variations. While the team had considered using satellite or surveillance aircraft images to create the game's terrain graphics, {{they found that the}} resolution was inadequate.

500|$|Also in The Daily Telegraph, Ed West {{gave the}} book a {{favourable}} review, writing [...] "Sentimentality, in which crude emotion replaces dispassionate analysis, affects {{all aspects of}} public life, such as the debates over education, prison places and overseas aid. As Dalrymple points out, no country has ever escaped poverty via international aid—but never mind, since what matters is not actually doing anything about state education or crime or Africa, but being seen to be caring about the 'vulnerable'". [...] The book was listed as a non-fiction choice by Steven Poole in The Guardian, who wrote, [...] "Dalrymple alternates vague ranting with surgical demolition (he is excellent on the fatuity of 'family impact statements' in court), and exhibits impressive thrift, in these uncertain times, with his research, getting tens of pages out of a single visit to WHSmith and the purchase of two newspapers. Perhaps the most suggestive sentence is <b>tucked</b> <b>away</b> in an endnote about tattoos: 'I wish I had the space to elaborate on the dermatological semiotics of violence in England'.

500|$|The Chapel of Christ {{and of the}} Reliquaries (...) {{was built}} in 1615 and {{designed}} with ultra-Baroque details which are often difficult {{to see in the}} poorly lit interior. [...] It was originally known as the Christ of the Conquistadors. That name came from an image of Christ that was supposedly donated to the cathedral by Emperor Charles V. [...] Over time, so many reliquaries were left on its main altar that its name was eventually changed. Of 17thcentury ornamentation, the main altarpiece alternates between carvings of rich foliage and small heads on its columns in the main portion and small sculptures of angels on its telamons in the secondary portion. Its niches hold sculptures of saints framing the main body. Its crucifix is from the 17thcentury. The predella is finished with sculptures of angels, and also contains small 17thpaintings of martyred saints by Juan de Herrera. Behind these paintings, hidden compartments contain some of the numerous reliquaries left here. Its main painting was done by Jose de Ibarra and dated 1737. Surrounding the altar is a series of paintings on canvas, depicting the Passion of Christ by Jose Villegas, painted in the 17thcentury. On the right-hand wall, an altar dedicated to the Virgin of the Confidence is decorated with numerous churrigueresque figurines <b>tucked</b> <b>away</b> in niches, columns and top pieces.|$|E
