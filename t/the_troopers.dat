5|$|In upstate New York, a {{child is}} {{picked up on the}} road by a state trooper. While en route, the child {{suddenly}} morphs into a deformed creature. At the station, <b>the</b> <b>troopers</b> try {{to decide what to do}} with him, and one takes his picture. Two other deformed people enter the station, kill <b>the</b> <b>troopers</b> and take the boy.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} sweep by the attack helicopters, two Chinooks carried the SAS to Gberi Bana. <b>The</b> <b>troopers</b> fast-roped {{into the village}} and {{immediately}} came under fire from the West Side Boys. Early on in the confrontation, the British operation sustained its first casualty—a round entered Trooper Bradley Tinnion's flank, leaving him seriously injured. He was dragged back to the helicopter and flown to the medical team aboard the RFA Sir Percivale, dying despite intensive resuscitation attempts on board. The SAS proceeded to clear the village, engaging those West Side Boys who offered resistance and capturing those who surrendered, including Foday Kallay.|$|E
5|$|Hearing {{the shots}} from the {{northern}} side of the river, Forbes uneasily moved towards the southern bank, intending to cross and help Wilson. However, Forbes's fears of an ambush proved to be well-founded; at an opportune moment, the Matabele in the scrub opened fire, catching the column in the open. The ambushers' shots were initially wild and inaccurate, but they soon began to focus their fire on the exposed Maxim guns and horses, forcing <b>the</b> <b>troopers</b> to retreat to cover. Five Company soldiers were injured. The resulting skirmish lasted about an hour, by which time the Shangani had been severely swollen by heavy rains upstream, causing it to flood.|$|E

After a few more puffs at his pipe, <b>the</b> <b>trooper</b> looks down askant at the little man, and the little man winks up at <b>the</b> <b>trooper.</b>|$|R

5|$|The 1st Rhodesia Regiment {{was soon}} posted back to Cape Town, {{where many of}} <b>the</b> <b>troopers</b> voiced their dissatisfaction {{at the lack of}} {{fighting}} in South-West Africa, and requested discharge so they could join the war in Europe. Superiors assured the men that they would see action in East Africa if they stayed, but failed to convince most of them; the 1st Rhodesia Regiment promptly disbanded {{due to a lack of}} personnel. The majority of the South-West Africa veterans boarded ship for England to enlist in the British Army, while others mustered into South African units already billed for European service.|$|E
5|$|The Finnish Red Guards {{seized the}} early {{initiative}} in the war, {{taking control of}} Helsinki on 28 January, and with a general attack phase lasting from February till early March 1918. The Reds were relatively well armed, but a chronic shortage of skilled leaders, both at command level and in the field, left them unable to capitalize on their initial momentum, {{and most of the}} offensives came to nothing. The military order chain functioned relatively well at Red company and platoon level, but leadership and authority were weak, as most of the field commanders were chosen by the vote of <b>the</b> <b>troopers.</b> The common troopers were more or less armed civilians, whose military training, discipline and combat morale were both inadequate and low.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the war, the 12th Light Horse Regiment {{remained}} in the Middle East for a number of months, during which time, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Phillip Chambers, they were used to suppress the 1919 Egyptian Uprising. During the uprising, the 12th carried out security operations to protect infrastructure in the Ismailia area. As the situation was resolved, the regiment handed back its stores and equipment in preparation for repatriation back to Australia and most of their horses were transferred to the Australian Remount Depot at Moascar. Due to concerns about costs, availability of shipping and quarantine restrictions, the decision was made that the horses would not be returned to Australia, but that they would be sold to the British Indian Army for further service, or to local Egyptians. According to Hollis, though, many were also put down by <b>the</b> <b>troopers</b> due to concerns they might be mistreated.|$|E

5|$|On August 9, fifteen Texas Rangers {{with their}} Indian scouts, located Victorio's main supply camp on Sierra Diablo. The Rangers joined Carpenter {{in the attack}} while Nolan guarded Sulfur Springs. Carpenter's attack {{scattered}} the Indian guards while <b>the</b> <b>troopers</b> secured 25 head of cattle, provisions and several pack animals. Victorio under increasing pressure, short of food and more importantly water, began to head south in two main groups. By August 11, Carpenter was on the trail in pursuit but, with horses tired and thirsty from the campaign, the chase was slow. Carpenter divided his command, with Nolan with his company and Texas Rangers on one route, while he took {{the rest of the}} command on another route. On August 13, Nolan reached the Rio Grande where Indian scouts reported that Victorio had crossed the border into Mexico the evening before. Carpenter arrived later and ordered the cavalrymen to rest near the river.|$|E
5|$|The {{enhanced}} A Company group—approximately 130 {{troops in}} total—arrived {{in the country}} in several groups and joined the SAS, who had already established a base in Hastings, a village 30 miles (50 kilometres) south of Freetown, where several of the paras recognised former colleagues among <b>the</b> <b>troopers</b> from D Squadron. At Hastings, the paras focused on live firing exercises and rehearsed various scenarios in a scale replica of Magbeni which had been constructed at the camp. As well as learning the layout of the village and refining battle technique, the rehearsals allowed the soldiers to acclimatise to the tropical heat, and led commanders to the decision that the paras would go into battle with minimal equipment {{to reduce the risk of}} heat exhaustion—excluding weapons and ammunition, they would carry only water and field dressings. Some officers feared that the weight of body armour would increase the risk of heat exhaustion, but commanders hoped that the cooler temperatures of the early morning (when the operation was planned to be launched) would mitigate the effects of the weight, and decided to order its use.|$|E
5|$|When {{the leading}} squadrons charged {{up to the}} {{trenches}} and the redoubt, the squadron commander and about 12 troopers of 12th Light Horse Regiment, dismounted to attack with rifle and bayonet, while {{the remainder of the}} regiment continued to gallop passed the redoubt on the right, to ride through a gap in the defensive line. When the second line squadron of the 12th Light Horse Regiment approached the trenches and redoubt, most of the squadron continued mounted riding through the gap. However, as both squadron commanders had dismounted to fight in the trenches and earthworks, <b>the</b> <b>troopers</b> who continued mounted were led by Captains Robey and Davies. These leading troops stopped to assemble at a point near where the road from Asluj crossed the Wadi Saba, behind the main Ottoman defences. When Robey and Davies mounted troopers were reorganised, they rode along the Asluj road into Beersheba in force, to capture the town.|$|E
50|$|The medical examiner's report showed five {{gunshot wounds}} to the back, with no upward angle {{present in the}} entry wounds.

2500|$|An Illinois {{state trooper}} stopped Roy Caballes for {{speeding}} on an interstate highway. When <b>the</b> <b>trooper</b> reported <b>the</b> stop to his headquarters, {{a member of}} the state police's drug interdiction squad overheard the report and proceeded to the location of the stop. [...] When the drug officer arrived, Caballes was in <b>the</b> <b>trooper's</b> car while <b>the</b> <b>trooper</b> was writing out a warning ticket. The drug officer walked his drug-sniffing dog around Caballes' car, and the dog alerted at the trunk. Inside the trunk, the officers found marijuana. The whole episode lasted less than 10 minutes.|$|R
25|$|In 2008 in a {{case that}} drew {{international}} attention, a North Carolina state trooper was filmed hanging and kicking a police dog he was training. After <b>the</b> <b>trooper's</b> superiors recommended minor punishment, Easley's office recommended that <b>the</b> <b>trooper</b> be fired. <b>The</b> case is ongoing, with the state's canine units currently suspended.|$|R
5|$|Before {{arrival at}} the Ely Road, a small {{detachment}} of troops were ordered across the Hemp Field to enter the village from the east. The larger group then charged at a hard gallop down the Mill Street incline through to Main Street. The rioters were found making a stand in The George and Dragon near {{the west end of}} Station Road. The militia were called to the front when the rioters would not come out after being ordered to by Bate Dudley. Thomas South, shooting from a window, hit trooper Wallace in the forearm. The militia got the rioters out of the public house and assembled them in the street, surrounded by <b>the</b> <b>troopers.</b> Thomas Sindall attempted to take a musket from trooper William Porter but was not successful. Sindall ran away and when he did not stop after being called on to do so by Porter, he was shot through the back of the head. Thomas Sindall was killed; he was the only person known to be at both Downham Market and Littleport. The result of this shooting was to subdue the rest of the rioters. Those captured were taken to Ely gaol {{and the rest of the}} rioters were rounded up.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, a Sunday, {{at around}} 18:00, a general disturbance {{was reported in}} the town bazaar and columns of smoke were seen, rising from burning buildings. The 60th Rifles were waiting outside the local church, ready to attend a service, which had been delayed by half an hour on account of unusually warm weather; the sound of gunfire from the town alerted them to trouble. They headed to their own barracks, armed themselves, and were on their parade square awaiting orders when they were attacked by mounted troopers from the 3rd Bengal Light Cavalry. Upon finding the 60th Rifles unexpectedly armed and waiting for them, <b>the</b> <b>troopers</b> rode away, headed directly to the jail and released their comrades {{with the help of a}} local blacksmith. At the same time, soldiers from the 11th and 20th Regiments of Bengal Native Infantry were mutinying, killing some of their officers and some civilians (while helping some of their officers and officers' families to escape), and burning a number of buildings within the town. One company of the 60th Rifles was ordered to guard the treasury, a second company was ordered to guard their barracks, and the remainder of the 60th Rifles, joined by the 6th Dragoon Guards, headed to the barracks of the Native Infantry regiments. When they arrived, they found the buildings ablaze and the area deserted. Hewitt, concerned about the possibility of attack, withdrew the troops back toward their barracks and encamped them nearby. Throughout the mutiny and subsequent rioting, one troop consisting of between 80 and 90 members of the 3rd Bengal Light Cavalry remained loyal to their officers. The mutinying soldiers from the 3rd Bengal Light Cavalry, having released their comrades from the jail, returned to Meerut and joined in with the rioting along with members of the local civilian population, and then the mutineers from all three regiments left, heading to Delhi, although the fact that they had left Meerut was not discovered by the military authorities until the following morning and they did not know the direction in which the mutineers had departed.|$|E

While <b>the</b> <b>troopers</b> were unarmed except for pepper spray, {{they were involved in}} a number of heated situations which required careful negotiation to defuse. <b>The</b> <b>troopers</b> also conducted 'hearts-and-minds' patrols, staying in local villages and developing relationships with leaders.|$|E

25|$|After {{being called}} to the Pine Ridge Agency, Spotted Elk of the Miniconjou Lakota nation and 350 of his {{followers}} were making the slow trip to the agency on December 28, 1890, when they were met by a 7th Cavalry detachment under Major Samuel M. Whitside southwest of Porcupine Butte. John Shangreau, a scout and interpreter who was half Sioux, advised <b>the</b> <b>troopers</b> not to disarm the Indians immediately, as {{it would lead to}} violence. <b>The</b> <b>troopers</b> escorted the Native Americans about five miles westward (8km) to Wounded Knee Creek where they told them to make camp. Later that evening, Colonel James W. Forsyth {{and the rest of the}} 7th Cavalry arrived, bringing the number of troopers at Wounded Knee to 500. In contrast, there were 350 Lakota: 230 men and 120 women and children. <b>The</b> <b>troopers</b> surrounded Spotted Elk's encampment and set up four rapid-fire Hotchkiss-designed M1875 mountain guns.|$|E

The marchers, including John Lewis of SNCC, Hosea Williams of SCLC, and Selma activist Amelia Boynton, cross the Edmund Pettus Bridge and approach a line of state troopers who put on gas masks. <b>The</b> <b>troopers</b> order the marchers to turn back, and when they hold their ground <b>the</b> <b>troopers</b> attack with clubs, horses, tear gas, and other weapons. Lewis and Boynton are among those badly injured. The attack is shown on national television as the wounded are treated at Brown Chapel, the movement's headquarter church.|$|E
25|$|In 1876, a {{large group}} of Arikara men {{accompanied}} Custer and the 7th Cavalry on the Little Big Horn Expedition. Arikara scouts were in the lead when US Army forces attacked the widespread encampment of thousands of Sioux and Cheyenne warriors and families. Several scouts drove off Lakota horses, as they had been ordered, and others fought alongside <b>the</b> <b>troopers.</b> Three Arikara men were killed: Little Brave, Bobtail Bull, and Bloody Knife. During the subsequent confusion, when the scouts were cut off from <b>the</b> <b>troopers,</b> they returned to the base camp as they had been directed. After the battle, in which Custer and some 260 other US troops were killed, the search for scapegoats resulted in some critics mistakenly accusing the scouts of having abandoned the soldiers.|$|E
25|$|Under {{threat of}} attack, the first U.S. {{soldiers}} on the battlefield three days later hurriedly buried <b>the</b> <b>troopers</b> in shallow graves, more or less where they had fallen. A couple of years after the battle, markers were placed where men were believed to have fallen, so the placement of troops has been roughly construed.
