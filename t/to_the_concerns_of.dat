5|$|The Belgians much {{preferred}} {{an alliance}} with the United Kingdom. The British had entered the First World War {{in response to the}} German violation of Belgian neutrality. The Belgian Channel ports had offered the German Imperial Navy valuable bases, and such an attack would offer the German Kriegsmarine and the Luftwaffe bases to engage in strategic offensive operations against the United Kingdom in the coming conflict. But the British government paid little attention <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>of</b> the Belgians. The lack of this commitment ensured the Belgian withdrawal from the Western Alliance, the day before the remilitarisation of the Rhineland. The lack of opposition to the remilitarisation served to convince the Belgians that France and Britain were unwilling to fight for their own strategic interests, let alone Belgium's. The Belgian General Staff was determined to fight for its own interests, alone if necessary.|$|E
5|$|The {{script was}} refined further by {{director}} Val Guest, who cut 30 pages from Landau's script. One of Guest's key {{contributions to the}} script was to tailor the dialogue to suit the brusque style of star Brian Donlevy. With an American actor cast as Quatermass, Guest reverted Briscoe to a British character and reinstated Quatermass's title of professor. Guest also adapted some sections of the script in response <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>of</b> the BBFC. Further stylistic changes were sought by the BBC who retained a script approval option after {{the sale of the}} rights and asked Nigel Kneale to work on their suggested changes, much to his indignation. Kneale was tasked with rewriting any scenes featuring BBC announcers to match the BBC's news reporting style.|$|E
5|$|Henry's {{government}} relied {{primarily on}} Eleanor and her Savoyard supporters, and it proved short-lived. He attempted {{to settle the}} crisis permanently by forcing the barons {{to agree to the}} Treaty of Kingston. This treaty introduced a system of arbitration to settle outstanding disputes between the King and the barons, using Richard as an initial adjudicator, backed up by Louis of France should Richard fail to generate a compromise. Henry softened some of his policies in response <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>of</b> the barons, but he soon began to target his political enemies and recommence his unpopular Sicilian policy. Henry's government was weakened by the death of de Clare, as his heir, Gilbert, sided with the radicals; the King's position was further undermined by major Welsh incursions along the Marches and the Pope's decision to reverse his judgement on the Provisions, this time confirming them as legitimate. By early 1263, Henry's authority had disintegrated and the country slipped back towards open civil war.|$|E

5|$|To {{transport}} the raiders to the island, two tugs, Vulcan and Nuneaton, {{were provided by}} the Governor of Nigeria, Sir Bernard Bourdillon. The raiding force would consist of 32 men, four SOE agents, 11 commandos from the SSRF and 17 men recruited from the local population to crew the two tugs. The mission suffered a blow when the British General Officer Commanding (GOC) West Africa Command, General Sir George Giffard refused to support the mission and would not release the 17 men required, stating it would compromise some unnamed plans {{he had in mind}} and the act of piracy would have repercussions. Responding <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>of</b> the GOC West Africa, the Admiralty suspended the operation. The Foreign Office was also not in favour of the operation, and neither was the British Embassy in Madrid, which was concerned about the possible reactions of the Spanish government. The final go ahead, eventually supported by the Foreign Office, was not given until 6 January 1942, on the grounds that suspicion of British involvement in the raid was inevitable; what counted was the avoidance of any tangible proof. As a safeguard the Admiralty also dispatched , a , to intercept the vessels at sea, which would provide the cover story that they had been intercepted while trying to make their way home to Europe.|$|E

50|$|Accordingly, the {{provisional}} government, supposedly created <b>to</b> address <b>the</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> classes of French society, had little {{support among the}} working classes and petit bourgeoisie. Therefore, it tended <b>to</b> address only <b>the</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> liberal bourgeoisie. Support for {{the provisional}} government was especially weak in the countryside, which was predominantly agricultural and more conservative, and had its own concerns, such as food shortages due <b>to</b> bad harvests. <b>The</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bourgeoisie were very {{different from those of}} the lower classes. Support for the provisional government was also undermined by the memory of the French Revolution.|$|R
25|$|Motor {{traffic is}} served {{primarily}} by Ontario provincial Highway 48, Highway 407, and Highway 404, {{which are in}} turn complemented by a network of regional roads that form a grid pattern across the town.

25|$|The {{automated}} welding procedures {{used by the}} deck boxes fabricator (Shanghai Zhenhua Port Machinery Co. Ltd.) were frequently performed in the rain. Such welding has been long recognized as leading to the cracking of imperfect welds. Such welds were considered by Caltrans management to be of low criticality in this bridge owing to the compressive forces imposed on the deck structure by this particular design. There are also reports of the vendor being uncooperative <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>of</b> Caltrans inspectors and engineers. Owing to {{the fragility of the}} old cantilever structure and the possibility of a destructive earthquake, Caltrans felt motivated to avoid further delays in the new span's completion.|$|E
25|$|Before the 1890s, many {{hard rock}} mines were {{owned by the}} miners who had {{discovered}} them. Owners who had been miners were often more sympathetic <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>of</b> miners. But the higher cost of industrialization changed that. The typical mine owners of the 1890s started out as bankers, managers, and businessmen who had never entered a mine, and whose primary concern was profitability. Lode mining took capital, and investors from {{the east and west}} coasts, and even from Europe, were actively courted. When the Colorado Legislature passed a law in 1887 prohibiting foreign ownership of real estate in Colorado, mine ownership was excepted.|$|E

25|$|Abdullah Pasha adhered <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>of</b> {{his newly}} formed inner circle and {{subsequently}} ordered Farhi {{to move the}} treasury into Acre's government house, which Farhi did. He then dismissed Farhi as chief scribe and appointed Yusuf Qardahi, a Maronite from Sidon, in his place. After these demotions, Farhi requested to retire to Damascus, but Abdullah did not allow it, viewing Farhi's presence in Damascus as a potential threat to his rule. Al-Madi and Umar Effendi al-Baghdadi, a local official, convinced Abdullah {{that as long as}} Farhi was alive he would pose a threat to Abdullah's rule through the same influential Jewish contacts with the Sublime Porte that got Abdullah appointed in the first place.|$|E
25|$|Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>of</b> Hamid II {{views of}} `Abdu'l-Bahá's activities, a Commission of Inquiry interviewed him in 1905, {{with the result}} that he was almost exiled to Fezzan. In response, `Abdu'l-Bahá wrote the sultan a letter protesting that his {{followers}} refrain from involvement in partisan politics and that his tariqa had guided many Americans to Islam. Subsequent to the Young Turk Revolution `Abdu'l-Bahá was released from his imprisonment and allowed to travel away from Palestine. He freely expressed his disapproval of Sultan Abdul Hamid II and his policies. `Abdu'l-Bahá would continue to praise the Committee of Union and Progress, and during his tour of North America in 1912, the Ottoman embassy in Washington, D.C. held a dinner in his honor.|$|E
25|$|Lyon Turin Ferroviaire (Lyon-Chambéry-Turin), {{which would}} connect the TGV network to the Italian TAV network, {{has been the}} subject of demonstrations in Italy. While most Italian {{political}} parties agree on the construction of this line, some inhabitants of the towns where construction would take place oppose it vehemently. The concerns put forward by the protesters centre on storage of dangerous materials mined during tunnel boring, like asbestos and perhaps uranium, in the open air.. This health danger could be avoided by using more expensive techniques for handling radioactive materials. A six-month delay in the start of construction has been decided in order to study solutions. In addition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>of</b> the residents, RFB – a ten-year-old national movement – opposes the development of Italy's TAV high-speed rail network as a whole.|$|E
