5|$|Aerial {{operations}} for the incursion got off <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> <b>start.</b> Reconnaissance flights over the operational area were restricted since MACV believed that they might serve as a signal of intention. The role of the Air Force in the planning for the incursion itself was minimal at best, in part to preserve the secrecy of Menu which was then considered an overture to the thrust across the border.|$|E
5|$|Speedie resurfaced in 1960, when he {{was named}} the end coach for the new American Football League's Houston Oilers under former {{teammate}} and Oilers head coach Lou Rymkus. The Oilers won the AFL championship in 1960, but Rymkus was fired after the team got off <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> <b>start</b> the following year. Team owner Bud Adams urged Speedie {{to stay on the}} staff, but Speedie resigned out of loyalty to Rymkus.|$|E
5|$|The captive {{breeding}} program, {{led by the}} San Diego Wild Animal Park and Los Angeles Zoo, {{and with}} other participating zoos around the country, including the Oklahoma City Zoo and Botanical Garden, got off <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> <b>start</b> due to the condor's mating habits. However, utilizing the bird's ability to double clutch, biologists began removing the first egg from the nest and raising it with puppets, allowing the parents to lay another egg.|$|E

5|$|After {{the triumph}} of the {{previous}} season, the 1945–46 season was a complete loss for Kennedy. He got off <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> <b>start,</b> beginning the season at right wing before being returned to his center position and he also fell ill. By January Kennedy had only 5 points in 21 games and was then lost {{for the rest of the}} season due to an injury to his foot, when a Boston Bruin player's skate dug into his boot. With the Leafs also losing Captain Syl Apps to injury Toronto missed the playoffs.|$|E
5|$|The Browns next {{beat the}} Los Angeles Dons 31–14 in Cleveland {{to extend their}} winning streak to seven games. The crowd of 71,134 people who {{attended}} the game on a sunny October day was a professional football record. Cleveland got off <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> <b>start,</b> falling behind 7–3 at halftime. The Browns' only score {{in the first half}} came on a 49-yard Lou Groza field goal, then the fourth-longest kick in professional football history. A flurry of scoring {{at the end of the}} third quarter and in the fourth quarter, however, won Cleveland the game. Otto Graham passed 36 yards to end Dante Lavelli and then ran in a touchdown with less than three minutes left in the third. It was the first of four touchdowns in 14 minutes of play. Fullback Marion Motley ran in two touchdowns in the fourth quarter, one of them a 68-yard run that tied an AAFC record for a rush from scrimmage. The Browns won despite a strong ground attack by the Dons, who gained 274 yards of rushing. The Dons had 21 first downs compared to Cleveland's 10. Groza made all of his extra point attempts, extending his streak to 22 in a row.|$|E
5|$|With a {{new head}} coach {{who is a}} first-time head coach, the 2011–12 Tigers got off <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> <b>start</b> with a 1–5 record, but won 18 of its final 24 games and started its conference {{schedule}} with a 2–3 record, but won 8 of its final 9 games. Eventually, Princeton earned its first home win against a ranked opponent since the 1976–77 team's January 3, 1977 victory over Notre Dame by defeating Harvard (No. 21 Coaches/25 AP) on February 11, 2012. The win was also its first against a ranked opponent on any court since November 11, 1997, which is when the 1997–98 team opened its season with a victory over a ranked Texas team at Meadowlands Arena (now named Izod Center) in East Rutherford, New Jersey. Princeton also defeated eventual 2012 ACC Men's Basketball Tournament Champion Florida State five weeks after Harvard did. The team qualified for the 2012 CBI Tournament and earned a first round 95–86 victory over Evansville. In the subsequent game against Pittsburgh, Princeton lost 8261 to end the season.|$|E

5|$|After {{the end of}} the Australian season, Poulton was {{selected}} for the ODI team the ICC Women's Quadrangular Series in Chennai, India. In addition to the hosts and Australia, New Zealand and England were also participating, and each team played each other twice in the round-robin phase. Poulton scored only 8 and 0 from 21 and 8 balls respectively as Australia lost their first two matches against New Zealand and India respectively. She was then dropped for the next two games. She was recalled for the penultimate round-robin match against England but did not bat in a six-wicket win, and then made 27 as Australia defeated India by four wickets in the last match. The Australians needed 231 for victory—4.62 runs per over—and Poulton got their innings off <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> <b>start,</b> taking 75 balls to accumulate her runs, scoring at {{less than half of the}} required rate. However, her teammates sped up and reached the target from the last ball of the match to qualify for the final against New Zealand. Australia won by six wickets with the dropped Poulton watching from the sidelines. She ended the series with 35 runs at 11.66 with a strike rate of only 33.65, was then overlooked for the Rose Bowl series against New Zealand held in Darwin in July.|$|E
5|$|As Dallas {{celebrated their}} title, the NBA {{was in a}} lockout. It ended on December 8, 2011. The {{defending}} champions lost core players, such as DeShawn Stevenson, J. J. Barea, Peja Stojaković, and Tyson Chandler, while adding veteran all-star Vince Carter, Lamar Odom, and Delonte West in free agency. The Mavericks played only two preseason games, which led <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> <b>start</b> for Nowitzki. Soon, Nowitzki became the 98th player in NBA history to play in 1,000 games. Nowitzki received his championship ring on January 25, 2012. After scoring his 23,335th point, Nowitzki passed Robert Parish on the all-time scoring list at #20. He then passed Charles Barkley for 19th, and scored his 24,000th point on April 15, 2012 against the Lakers. Nowitzki blocked a shot by the Celtics' Avery Bradley, which was his 1,000th block. He became one of only 3 players in NBA history with at least 1,000 3-pointers and blocks, joining Clifford Robinson and Rasheed Wallace. Nowitzki made his 11th straight All-Star game appearance in Orlando. Nowitzki scored 31 {{points in the second}} half against Houston on April 18, 2012, including 21 in the fourth quarter. It marked the third-highest scoring half by a Dallas player in franchise history. The 21 points in the fourth quarter also represented Nowitzki's third-highest scoring quarter of his career. Carrying the load of the Mavericks, Nowitzki led his team in scoring 45 times. On March 30, he led the Mavs down from 15 points, including a game winner, against the Magic. Nowitzki's streak of 11 seasons with 1,500 points came to an end after scoring 1,342 in the shortened NBA season. The Mavs clinched the seventh spot in the West, and were matched against the Oklahoma City Thunder in the 2012 NBA Playoffs. The Thunder swept the Mavs in 4 games.|$|E

30|$|For {{the real}} network {{and for the}} Wats-Strogatz graph we obtain an {{expected}} result: the active diffusion trends show the fastest growth; conversely, the passive diffusion trends seem to be tied <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>slower</b> <b>start.</b> Such results are somehow expected: the former model assumes that a susceptible node can decide to adopt when it discovers {{the existence of a}} given information (e.g., when at least a single of its neighbors has already adopted it) while the latter fixes an exposure threshold below which the node does not come in contact with the information. Particular attention should be reserved to the mixed approach, described by the Profile-Threshold model: for the first two synthetic networks, the mixed and passive models behave alike while in the Facebook and Wats-Strogatz network the Profile-Threshold trend stands below the Threshold one.|$|R

50|$|The Cortina {{went on sale}} on 23 October 1970, but sales got off <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{particularly}} <b>slow</b> <b>start</b> {{because of}} production difficulties that culminated with a ten-week strike at Ford's plant between April and June 1971, which {{was at the time}} reported to have cost production of 100,000 vehicles, equivalent <b>to</b> almost <b>a</b> quarter of the output for a full year.|$|R
30|$|It is the {{algorithm}} {{that controls the}} ssthresh value, which is, in turn, responsible for changing the <b>slow</b> <b>start</b> phase to the congestion avoidance phase.

25|$|The Nationals {{would get}} off <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> <b>start</b> as coach Al Cervi was fired and {{replaced}} by Paul Seymour.
