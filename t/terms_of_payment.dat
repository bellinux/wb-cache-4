500|$|Supposedly, Martin had no {{intention}} of signing The Beatles after listening to the Decca recordings, but he offered a contract after learning that Epstein would cancel all his substantial NEMS business with EMI. Martin denied this account by saying that Epstein's conviction that The Beatles would become internationally famous finally convinced him to offer a recording contract. He also later admitted that EMI had [...] "nothing to lose" [...] by signing a contract with The Beatles, as the <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> were negligible. At this point, almost every other British record company had rejected the group, and Martin had never heard the group live. The Beatles were eventually signed to EMI's small Parlophone label, which had very little experience with pop or rock artists. Upon signing the contract, Epstein immediately sent a telegram to The Beatles (who were in Hamburg) and to the Mersey Beat music journal in Liverpool.|$|E

500|$|Late in 1927, Brownlee {{began to}} {{advocate}} for joint acquisition of the lines by CN and CP. [...] When, in early 1928, the lines began to show a profit thanks to the management of Deputy Minister of Railways John Callaghan, he began to pursue the idea with more vigour. [...] One of the lines, the Lacombe and North Western, was sold to CP for $1.5 million, and CP and CN made a joint offer of $15 million for the Edmonton, Dunvegan and British Columbia, {{the largest of the}} lines. [...] Brownlee recommended against acceptance of the latter offer, believing that the price was too low, the <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> too unfavourable (none would be made until 1930, and the interest rate applied was only one and a half percent—less than Brownlee believed that the province could earn in operating profits by keeping the railway), and the result of Alberta being left with a department of railways responsible for a single railway too undesirable.|$|E

60|$|In {{the present}} {{emergency}} Washington was reluctantly compelled, by the distresses of the army, {{to call upon}} the counties of the State for supplies of grain and cattle, proportioned to their respective abilities.

Washington charged his officers to act with as much tenderness as possible, graduating the exaction according to the stock of each individual, so that no family should be deprived of what was necessary to its subsistence. To the honor of the magistrates and the people of Jersey, Washington testifies that his requisitions were punctually complied with, and in many counties exceeded.|$|E

She was wrecked soon afterwards, and now lay buried in the sand by an African river bar. The salvage company had given up their efforts to float her, but Cartwright imagined she could be floated if one were willing to run a risk. But no one, it seemed was willing. On the failure of the salvage company the underwriters had put the steamer into the hands of Messrs. Bull and Morse, a firm of Ship Brokers and Marine Auctioneers, but at the public auction no bids whatever had been made. Subsequently advertisements appeared in the shipping papers inviting offers for the ship as she lay and for the salvage of the cargo. These had run for several weeks, but without result. Cartwright had cut them out. Now and then he looked at them and speculated about the undertaking.|$|E
