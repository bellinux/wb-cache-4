ResultsThe decision-making process consists of three elementary components: (1) identifying an individual's needs; (2) exploring options; and (3) making a choice. The most important <b>phase</b> is <b>the</b> <b>exploration</b> <b>phase</b> as it is crucial for {{the acceptance of the}} disease. Furthermore, the decision is experienced more as an emotional choice than a rational one. It is influenced by personal preferences whereas practical aspects do not seem to play a substantial role. ConclusionSeveral aspects make decision-making in dementia different from decision-making in the context of other chronic diseases: (1) the difficulty accepting dementia; (2) the progressive nature of dementia; (3) patient's reliance on surrogate decision-making; and (4) strong emotions. Due to these aspects, the decision-making process is very time-consuming, especially <b>the</b> crucial <b>exploration</b> <b>phase.</b> Practice implicationsA more active role is required of both the caregiver and the health care professional especially in <b>the</b> <b>exploration</b> <b>phase,</b> enabling easier acceptance and adjustment to the disease.

30|$|The {{behavior}} of wild cyprid larvae of Semibalanus balanoides in situ {{in the ocean}} close to different surface textures treated and untreated with crude conspecific adult extract (AE) has been studied by Prendergast et al.

Results furthermore suggest that cyprids tend to explore smooth surfaces longer and leave rough surfaces earlier. This means that during <b>the</b> <b>exploration</b> <b>phase</b> cyprids were not only sensitive to the surface chemistry but also to the surface topography as they directly respond by changing their behavior. As pointed out by Aldred et al. [99], those topographies reducing adhesion are less likely to be selected for settlement and metamorphosis.

40|$|Modern {{architectural}} design may be generally appointed as complex. Hence, designing in an undefined domain {{within the field}} of architecture (e. g. From the urban to the building and down into the materialisation) is also a risky task. Hence, in some situation, such a design has to deal with one or more severe constraints, therefore such a design environment represent an extremely busy situation. This design, such as designing for a Sustainable Reconstruction of Houses in a Seismic Desert environment (i. e. SRH-SD), may become too vague to reach any appropriate conclusions. For which systemisation is a good solution to avoid the possible complications and chaos, which has been provided in a larger frame of study (e. g. See also Shahnoori, 2008; Shahnoori, 2009; Shahnoori et al., 2010 a; Shahnoori et al., 2010 b, Shahnoori et al., 2011 a). In this solution, the design Processes has been modelled as a system in the Glocal (Global and local) Process Model or the GPM. Each phase of the GPM has been assumed as a Subsystem.

Previous studies also show that the suitability of different appraisal tools for SCIs is debatable. In the mining industry, SCI in new mining sites typically are highly capital intensive and have considerable long-term repercussions for local communities and regions. During <b>the</b> <b>exploration</b> <b>phase</b> it is essential to assess whether to allocate financial resources for additional exploitation of a mineral finding. <b>The</b> <b>exploration</b> <b>phase</b> allows companies to search for new opportunities that might lead to a competitive advantage. However, from a cost management point of view this is a decisive phase because large share of the production cost is determined here. Because the traditional functions of management accounting rely on established measurable outputs, they are less effective in this phase. Management control is demanding because money and resources cannot be traced to outcomes. This is a phase where control needs to be prospects-oriented. Knowledge is lacking when it comes to the specifics of how prospective control can be exercised and the possibilities for successful strategic control in <b>the</b> <b>exploration</b> <b>phase.</b> <b>The</b> overall purpose of this dissertation is to generate empirical knowledge of prospective control and to contribute with a more developed and dynamic theory of this concept in the context of strategic {{capital investments}} in the mining industry. The theoretical contributions of the planned papers are to generate theory about the nature and characteristics of prospective control in the context of SCIs and to create new insights about the controller perspective in this regard.

40|$|A central {{problem to}} {{decision}} making under uncertainty is <b>the</b> trade-off between <b>exploration</b> and exploitation: between learning from and adapting to a stochastic system and exploiting the current best-knowledge about the system. A fundamental decision-theoretic model that captures this trade-off is the celebrated stochastic Multi-arm Bandit Problem. In this paper, we consider scenarios where <b>the</b> <b>exploration</b> <b>phase</b> corresponds to designing experiments, and <b>the</b> <b>exploration</b> <b>phase</b> has <b>the</b> following restrictions: (1) it must necessarily precede the exploitation phase; (2) it is expensive {{in terms of}} some resource consumed, so that only {{a limited amount of}} exploration can be performed; and (3) switching from one experiment to another incurs a setup cost. Such a model, which is termed budgeted learning, is relevant in scenarios such as clinical trials and sensor network data acquisition. Though the classic multi-armed bandit problem admits to a polynomial time greedy optimal solution termed the Gittins index policy, the budgeted learning problem does not admit to such a greedy optimal solution. In fact, the problem is NP-Hard even in simple settings.

40|$|In a {{population-based}} meta-heuristic, {{the search}} process {{is divided into}} two main phases: exploration versus exploitation. In <b>the</b> <b>exploration</b> <b>phase,</b> a random behavior is fruitful to explore the search space as extensive as possible. In contrast, a fast exploitation toward the promising regions is the main objective of the latter phase. It is really challenging to find a proper balance <b>between</b> these two <b>phases</b> because of the stochastic nature of population-based meta-heuristic algorithms. The literature shows that chaotic maps are able to improve both phases. This work embeds ten chaotic maps into the gravitational constant (G) of the recently proposed population-based meta-heuristic algorithm called Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA). Also, an adaptive normalization method is proposed to transit from <b>the</b> <b>exploration</b> <b>phase</b> to <b>the</b> exploitation phase smoothly. As case studies, twelve shifted and biased benchmark functions evaluate the performance of the proposed chaos-based GSA algorithms in terms of exploration and exploitation. A statistical test called Wilcoxon rank-sum is done to judge about the significance of the results as well. The results demonstrate that sinusoidal map is the best map for improving the performance of GSA significantly. Griffith Sciences, School of Information and Communication TechnologyNo Full Tex...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} the monotonicity of various optimality criteria during <b>the</b> <b>exploration</b> <b>phase</b> {{of an active}} SLAM algorithm. Optimality criteria such as A-opt, Dopt or E-opt are used in active SLAM to account for uncertainty in the map or the robot's pose, and these criteria are usually part of utility functions which help active SLAM algorithms decide where the robot should move next. The monotonicity of the optimality criteria is of utmost importance. During <b>the</b> <b>exploration</b> <b>phase,</b> i. e. when the robot is traversing new territory or cannot perform a loop closure, the most common way of estimating the pose of the robot is through dead-reckoning. Correctly accounting for the uncertainty is important for an active SLAM algorithm and in particular for a dead-reckoning scenario, where by definition the uncertainty in the robot's pose grows. If monotonicity does not hold in this scenario, active SLAM algorithms can execute actions under the false belief that the uncertainty has reduced. We show analytically and experimentally some conditions in which the A-opt and E-opt criteria lose monotonicity in a dead-reckoning scenario, where the propagation of the robot's pose is done using a linearized framework. We also show analytically and experimentally that under the same conditions the D-opt does not lose monotonicity and, in general for the linearized framework under consideration, D-opt does not break monotonicity.
