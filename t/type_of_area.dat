The three <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>areas</b> are county aggregations based on different data sources: the Bureau of Economic Analysis Economic Areas (BEAAs), Ranally Basic Trading Areas (RBTAs), and Health Care Commuting Areas (HCCAs). The three <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>areas</b> differ substantially in size, population, urbanization, and the availability of physicians. The overall percentage of physician visits outside each <b>of</b> the three <b>areas</b> was small, ranging from 3 percent for BEAAs to 5 percent for RBTAs and HCCAs. Visits by nonmetropolitan residents were about four times as likely as those by metropolitan residents to occur outside <b>of</b> each <b>area.</b> The results suggest that HCCAs are the most appropriate primary care physician service areas because they are the smallest in size and population and have the greatest variability in physician supply, yet they exhibit an amount of outside-area travel for care {{similar to that of the}} two larger <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>areas...</b>|$|R

50|$|Courts have {{continuously}} {{held that}} entry {{into an open}} field—whether trespass or not—is not a search {{within the meaning of}} the Fourth Amendment. No matter what steps a person takes, he or she cannot create a reasonable privacy expectation in an open field, because it is an area incapable of supporting an expectation of privacy as a matter of constitutional law. In situations where the police allege that what was searched was an open field, this has the practical effect of shifting the argument from whether any given expectation of privacy is reasonable, to whether the given place is actually an open field or some other <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>area</b> like curtilage.

50|$|The albedo of {{a surface}} usually {{varies with the}} {{wavelength}} of light hitting it. Mars reflects little light at the blue {{end of the spectrum}} but much at red and higher wavelengths. This is why Mars has the familiar reddish-orange color to the naked eye. But detailed observations reveal a subtle range of colors on Mars' surface. Color variations provide clues to the composition of surface materials. The bright areas are reddish-ochre in color, and the dark areas appear dark gray. A third <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>area,</b> intermediate in color and albedo, is also present and thought to represent regions containing a mixture of the material from the bright and dark areas.
