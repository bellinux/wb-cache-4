40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to present a very {{interesting}} topic related to the Methodology of Transformational Generative Grammar, and to apply it in the verses of the Quran by analyzing them through the syntactic grammar and sentence structural. Nevertheless, this study tried to discover the level of the understanding of this methodology among third year students (majoring in Arabic Language and Communications) at Universiti Sains Islam Malaysia (USIM). During this study, the researcher used two research approaches : analytical description approach and dedicated field approach. The analytical description approach was used to gather information from primary sources and secondary, ealier theses, academic journals and other sources, and then, the relevant information were direct or indirect copied in adherence to scientific research methodology. As for dedicated field approach was used to determine the level of the understanding of the methodology amongst students through the distribution of survey forms which were systematically analyzed by computerized analysis program (SPSS). The researcher also chose the branching rules (<b>tree</b> <b>chart)</b> for the Generative methodology and the re-writing methods for Transformative methodology during the analytical process of the verses of the Quran. as a result of this study, the researcher found that this methodology is not only a very updated and interesting grammatical analysis methods, but the methodology itself is very helpful in making the verses of the Quran to be easily understood in terms of language and meaning.

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{the notion of}} two-valued digit (twit) as a binary variable that can assume one of two different integer values. Posibits, or simply bits, in H I and negabits in I H, commonly used in two’s-complement representations and @ A encoding of binary signed digits, are special cases of twits. A weighted bit-set (WBS) encoding, which generalizes the two’s-complement encoding by allowing one or more posibits and/or negabits in each radix- 2 position, {{has been shown to}} unify many efficient implementations of redundant number systems. A collection of equally weighted twits, including ones with noncontiguous values (e. g., I I or H P), can lead to wider representation range without the added storage and interconnection costs associated with multivalued digit sets. We present weighted twit-set (WTS) encodings as a generalization of WBS encodings, examine key properties of this new class of encodings, and show that any redundant number system (e. g., generalized signed-digit and hybrid-redundant systems), including those that are based on noncontiguous and/or zero-excluded digit sets, is faithfully representable by WTS encoding. We highlight this broad coverage by a <b>tree</b> <b>chart</b> having WTS representations at its root and various useful redundant representations at its many internal nodes and leaves. We further examine how highly optimized conventional components such as standard full/half-adders and compressors may be used for arithmetic on WTS-encoded operands, thus allowing highly efficient and VLSI-friendly circuit implementations. For example, focusing on the WBS-like subclass of WTS encodings, we describe a twit-based implementation of a particular stored-transfer representation which offers area and speed advantages over other similar designs based on WBS and hybrid-redundant representations...|$|E
40|$|Materials and players: The game {{consists}} of one A 3 -size {{paper with a}} family <b>tree</b> <b>chart</b> on it. A pair of two players is needed for each sequence of the game. Use a pencil and rubber to complete the chart, {{so that it can}} be cleared and used again, or make A 3 copies of the chart. 4 charts are needed for the 4 rounds of the game. Goal: The goal of the game is for one of the players to get information about the other person’s family, so that s/he can complete the family tree for that person. It is preferable for the sake of the interest of the game that the players do not know each other’s families too well, but this is not absolutely necessary. Set-up: The two players sit next to each other at a table, slightly diagonal so that they are half facing each other. The camera should capture both players fully (as in the doctor-patient game, see the drawing there). Alternatively, players could sit opposite each other, looking at each other across the table, especially if there are two cameras available for filming. One player has the family chart in front of him/her on the table, ready to fill in symbols or words into the empty squares. The chart is out of reach for the second player, that is, s/he is not able to touch the chart or point directly at specific locations on the chart. It is not essential to have the chart itself on the video. Linguistic target: This game targets inalienable possession with kinship terms, as well as possessive pronouns (my parents, your sister, etc). The dialogue is expected to contain predicative possessive structures, as well as quantified possessum nominals (‘I have two sisters. ’). As a side-effect, the game elicits the kinship terms themselves. First, second and third person forms are targeted. Rules of the game: The player with the chart has to find out about the other player’s family members by asking questions, preferably without too much pointing at the individual squares and locations on the chart (if they find it appropriate, observers may choose to say this explicitly, or to interfere when players use too much pointing instead of signing). The square with the cross is the target person, the rest of the chart follows the conventional family tree model. If participants find it easier, you may choose to add another symbol (e. g. two interlocked circles) to indicate who is married to whom. The players should first look at the chart and discuss it with the observers until they understand the chart and the task. They can fill the chart by adding the conventional symbols for ‘male’ and ‘female’ or, of these symbols are not used in their culture, write words into the squares. Note that it is not important whether there are any mistakes in the chart itself. The player with the chart is free to choose where s/he wants to start filling in the tree, e. g. by asking about the other person’s siblings, or marriage, or parents. The strategy may also depend on the age of the addressee, but this is not really important for the game. If additional squares are needed, they can be added by hand, starting with the squares that are in dotted lines. If families in one generationa re too large to fit n the paper, some members can be skipped. After completing the male and female family members on the chart, the first player has to choose three individuals from the chart and ask about their ages and professions, and add those to the chart. (Note: This may elicit multiple embedding such as ‘your father’s sister’s work’). The the roles are switched and the game is repeated with reversed roles. After this first round, the player who first had the chart resumes asking the questions again, this time about a third person who the addressee knows well, for example, a good friend. The game is repeated talking about this friend’s family. (Note: This elicits third person reference.). Then again the roles are switched, and the second person asks about the first person’s friend. The game sequences in summary: PLAYER A asking about the family of PLAYER B PLAYER B asking about the family of PLAYER A PLAYER A asking about the family of A FRIEND OF PLAYER B PLAYER B asking about the family of A FRIEND OF PLAYER A Final note: To keep the game interesting, it is possible to introduce new tasks in rounds 3 and 4. For example, make the players go up to down or down to up when filling the chart. Or to find out ages and professions, do not let them choose, but choose for them who they should ask about. Or tell them to ask other kinds of information about individuals on the chart. This file was generated from an IMDI 1. 9 file and transformed to IMDI 3. 0.
