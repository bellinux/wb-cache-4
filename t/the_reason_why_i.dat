500|$|At {{the end of}} the year, {{the album}} {{received}} one vote in the Village Voice Pazz & Jop music critics poll. Rob Sevier, co-founder of the label The Numero Group, and Games, a collaboration between Daniel Lopatin (Oneohtrix Point Never) and Joel Ford, named Rain in England one of their favorite albums of the year. Dean Blunt of the electronic duo Hype Williams admired the album and said, [...] "it was artistic, it was the merit. ... Part of the reason it's so interesting, part of <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> think this is so good, it's a juxtaposition of two things that you really don't think are meant to be together." [...] Oakland, California rapper Kreayshawn said Lil B [...] "was an influence on me. I was starting to listen to his music and hanging out with him a lot when he was working on Rain in England." [...] Cloud rap duo Main Attrakionz has been compared to the style of Rain in England.|$|E
500|$|According to Rod Roddewig, a {{contemporary}} of Wilt's, Chamberlain documented his love life using a Day-Timer. Every time Chamberlain {{went to bed}} with a different woman, he put a check in his Day-Timer. Over a 10-day period, there were 23 checks in the book, {{which would be a}} rate of 2.3 women per day. Chamberlain divided that number in half, to be conservative and to correct for degrees of variation. He then multiplied that number by the number of days he had been alive at the time minus 15 years. That was how the 20,000 number came into existence. In response to public backlash regarding his promiscuity, Chamberlain later emphasized that [...] "the point of using the number was to show that sex was a great part of my life as basketball was a great part of my life. That's <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> was single." [...] In a 1999 interview shortly before his death, Chamberlain regretted not having explained the sexual climate {{at the time of his}} escapades, and warned other men who admired him for it, closing with the words: [...] "With all of you men out there who think that having a thousand different ladies is pretty cool, I have learned in my life I've found out that having one woman a thousand different times is much more satisfying." [...] Chamberlain also acknowledged that he never came close to marrying and had no intention of raising any children. However, in 2015 a man named Aaron Levi came forward claiming to be Chamberlain's son based on non-identifying papers from his adoption and information from his biological mother. Chamberlain's sister refused to provide DNA evidence for testing, so Levi's claim is not conclusive.|$|E

In his memoirs he developed a curious theory about the economic causes of World War II, which allowed him to plainly justify for himself his acts in favour of Nazi and Fascist war criminals:"The Allies' War against Germany was not a crusade, but the rivalry of economic complexes for whose victory they had been fighting.

I spent the whole 2013 trying to find four to three records that fit the album, that took my album to that level." [...] During the same interview, Schoolboy Q compared the album to Snoop Dogg's debut album Doggystyle; he also admitted he analyzed Kendrick Lamar's Good Kid, M.A.A.D City album as he crafted his own work: [...] "Yes, I studied Kendrick, because {{he is one of the}} heavy hitters in the game." ...|$|E

During this study, Derrida not only divulges the exact instances Socrates or his interlocutors make use of this concept, but also reveals the relationship between Plato and Socrates which scholars have kept in secret by questioning the validity of authorship in Plato's letters, where in the Second Letter Socrates writes: [...] "Consider these facts and take care lest you sometimes come to repent of having now unwisely published your views.

2500|$|Four {{days before}} polling {{day of the}} 1991 general election, Jufrie Mahmood, a {{candidate}} for the Workers' Party of Singapore, mentioned at a rally on 27 August 1991 that he opposed the MRHA which aimed to separate religion and politics. He said: [...] "Now, the imams of mosques who deliver sermons must feel disturbed but they can't say a thing against Government policy for under the Maintenance of Religious Harmony law, if they touch on the issue of lewd movies, they can be in for trouble. That's <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> oppose." [...] In response, the Minister for Community Development Wong Kan Seng said that there was nothing preventing religious leaders from advising their congregations not to watch R-rated films, and, in their individual capacity, it was open to them to write to the Ministry of Information and the Arts to express their disapproval of such films. However, the Act prevented them from inciting their congregants to oppose the Government on the issue. Wong also said that Jufrie had mentioned imams to talk about a secular issue and incite Malay feelings against the Government.|$|E
