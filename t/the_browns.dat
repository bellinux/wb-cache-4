5|$|After a {{training}} camp at Bowling Green State University, <b>the</b> <b>Browns</b> played their first game in September 1946 at Cleveland Stadium. A crowd of 60,135 {{people showed up}} to see <b>the</b> <b>Browns</b> beat the Miami Seahawks 44–0, then a record attendance mark for professional football. That touched off a string of wins; the team ended {{the season with a}} 12–2 record and the top spot in the AAFC's western division. <b>The</b> <b>Browns</b> then beat the AAFC's New York Yankees in the championship.|$|E

5|$|As {{the team}} {{prepared}} {{for its first}} season in 1946, McBride stepped aside and let Brown run it. <b>The</b> <b>Browns</b> were an immediate success, both financially and on the field. A capacity crowd of 35,964 saw <b>the</b> <b>Browns</b> play their first preseason game at the Akron Rubber Bowl, and the team led all of football in attendance in 1946 and 1947. <b>The</b> <b>Browns,</b> meanwhile, won every AAFC championship between 1946 and 1949. McBride proposed for <b>the</b> <b>Browns</b> to play an inter-league championship game with the National Football League champion Philadelphia Eagles in 1948 and 1949, but the NFL shot down the idea. He {{also played a role}} in negotiating peace between the AAFC and NFL after competition for talent drove up player salaries and ate into owners' profits. After the 1949 season, the AAFC dissolved and three of its teams, including <b>the</b> <b>Browns,</b> merged into the more established NFL.|$|E

5|$|Adamle {{grew up in}} Cleveland, Ohio and was a star fullback on his Collinwood High School {{football}} team. He attended Ohio State University in 1942, but {{his college}} career was cut short by World War II. After {{a stint in the}} U.S. Air Force, Adamle returned to finish his education at Ohio State in 1946. He soon dropped out of school, however, and joined <b>the</b> <b>Browns.</b> Cleveland won AAFC championships in each of Adamle's first three years, after which the league folded and <b>the</b> <b>Browns</b> were absorbed by the more established NFL. Cleveland continued to succeed in the NFL, winning the 1950 championship and advancing to the 1951 championship but losing to the Los Angeles Rams. Adamle left <b>the</b> <b>Browns</b> after the 1951 season to pursue a medical degree, but he came out of retirement briefly in 1954 as <b>the</b> <b>Browns</b> won another NFL championship.|$|E
5|$|After two losing seasons, <b>the</b> <b>Browns</b> {{made it back}} to {{contention}} in 2007. After {{opening with}} a 34–7 loss to the Steelers, <b>the</b> <b>Browns</b> traded Frye to the Seahawks and put Anderson in as the starter. In his first start, Anderson led <b>the</b> <b>Browns</b> to a surprise 51–45 win over the Cincinnati Bengals, throwing five touchdown passes and tying the franchise record. More success followed, and <b>the</b> <b>Browns</b> finished the regular season with a 10–6 record, the team's best mark since finishing 11–5 in 1994. While <b>the</b> <b>Browns</b> tied with the Steelers for first place in the AFC North, the team missed the playoffs because of two tie-breaking losses to Pittsburgh earlier in the season. Still, six players were selected for the Pro Bowl, including Anderson, Winslow, Edwards, kick returner Josh Cribbs and rookie left tackle Joe Thomas. Crennel agreed to a two-year contract extension until 2011, and the team hired Mike Keenan as team president, filling a position left vacant upon the departure of Collins two years before.|$|E
5|$|Although downtrodden by 1986's playoff defeat, Cleveland {{continued}} {{to win the}} following season.

5|$|Cleveland {{clinched}} {{first place}} in the AAFC's western division and earned a spot in the championship game by beating the Bisons 42–17. <b>The</b> <b>Browns</b> fell behind 10–7 in the first quarter, but subsequently scored 35 unanswered points. Edgar Jones scored two touchdowns, while Motley ran 76 yards for another score. Al Akins and Bud Schwenk had their only touchdowns of the season, playing in the fourth quarter after <b>the</b> <b>Browns</b> amassed a large lead. Despite the Browns' large margin of victory, the game was evenly matched; Cleveland's scores came mostly on breakaway plays. The Bisons had 19 first downs, nine more than <b>the</b> <b>Browns,</b> although <b>the</b> <b>Browns</b> out-gained the Bisons with 455 total yards. The game was marred by numerous penalties against both teams for unnecessary roughness, and the Bisons' kicker Lou Zontini and Browns halfback Ray Terrell were ejected after getting into a fight at midfield in the second quarter. A total of 37,054 people attended the game, the lowest figure for a Browns home game at that point in the season.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland {{held its}} {{training}} camp at Bowling Green University, {{as it did}} the year before. <b>The</b> <b>Browns</b> played one preseason game in late August against the Baltimore Colts, a new AAFC team formed to replace the Miami Seahawks after the Seahawks folded. <b>The</b> <b>Browns</b> scored their first points on a drive in the second period. A 14-yard run by fullback Marion Motley set up a 25-yard touchdown throw by quarterback Otto Graham to end Mac Speedie. Cleveland scored three more touchdowns in the game, all of them following Colts passes <b>the</b> <b>Browns</b> intercepted. One {{of them was a}} pass by Graham to end Dante Lavelli in the third quarter, and another was a rush by halfback Edgar Jones. Paul Brown pulled most of the Browns' starters from the game as the team built up a three-touchdown lead. Backup end Bob Cowan scored a fourth Cleveland touchdown in the final quarter on a pass from backup quarterback Ermal Allen, and <b>the</b> <b>Browns</b> won 28–0. Following the victory, <b>the</b> <b>Browns</b> faced the Buffalo Bills in the regular-season opener at Cleveland Stadium to begin their defense of the AAFC championship.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland {{managed to}} right {{the ship in}} 1994.

The Dons, who had handed <b>the</b> <b>Browns</b> their only {{loss of the}} season in October, scored a field goal and {{touchdown}} in the first quarter. <b>The</b> <b>Browns</b> responded with a touchdown run from Motley later in the quarter and led by four points at halftime after Tommy Colella caught a pass from Graham for another touchdown in the second period. Cleveland built on the lead in the third quarter with a long touchdown pass to Lew Mayne. Speedie sealed the victory for <b>the</b> <b>Browns</b> when he intercepted a backward lateral pass by Dons quarterback Chuck Fenenbock and ran it back 12 yards for a touchdown with four minutes left in the game. Los Angeles threatened to score numerous times, but Cleveland's defense held. <b>The</b> <b>Browns</b> forced the Dons to punt three times from within their own 10-yard line. Graham had 240 yards of passing. His two touchdown passes added to his league-leading total of 22 on the season. Tackle Lou Saban continued to handle placekicking duties for <b>the</b> <b>Browns</b> as Groza sat out with an injury.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland regressed in {{the ensuing}} season, {{finishing}} with a 4–12 record. Edwards and tight end Kellen Winslow Jr., who <b>the</b> <b>Browns</b> had drafted in 2004, put up respectable numbers, but <b>the</b> <b>Browns</b> were close {{to the bottom of}} the league in points scored and offensive yards gained. Frye injured his wrist toward the end of the season and shared starts with quarterback Derek Anderson, who showed promise in the five games he played in. During the season, the team produced a series of articles on its website called 60th Moments. The series commemorated the establishment of <b>the</b> <b>Browns</b> 60 years before in 1946, recapturing the 60 greatest moments in franchise history. Beginning on September 6, 2006, the Browns' site ran articles covering those 60 moments; the final article ran on December 31, 2006.|$|E

5|$|Cleveland's first regular-season game {{took place}} September 6, 1946 at Cleveland Municipal Stadium against the Miami Seahawks before a then-record crowd of 60,135.

With Brown at the helm, the team won {{all four of the}} AAFC's championships from 1946 until its {{dissolution}} in 1949, amassing a record of 52 wins, four losses and three ties. This included the 1948 season, in which <b>the</b> <b>Browns</b> became the first unbeaten and untied team in professional football history. <b>The</b> <b>Browns</b> had few worthy rivals among the AAFC's eight teams, but the New York Yankees and San Francisco 49ers were their closest competition.|$|E
5|$|Five former Rams players also {{jumped to}} <b>the</b> <b>Browns</b> in 1946: center Mike Scarry, tackle Chet Adams and backs Gaylon Smith, Tommy Colella and Don Greenwood. Their move {{gave rise to}} a legal battle with the Rams, who left Cleveland for Los Angeles shortly after winning the 1945 NFL {{championship}} rather than compete with <b>the</b> <b>Browns.</b> Reeves, the Rams' owner, filed an injunction against Adams in federal court after he signed with <b>the</b> <b>Browns,</b> claiming the tackle unlawfully broke his contract to play for the Rams. Adams argued he had no obligation under his contract to play for the Rams because the team had changed to the Los Angeles Rams following the move. At the end of August 1946, federal judge Emerich Freed denied the Rams' injunction, allowing Adams to play for <b>the</b> <b>Browns.</b> The judge rejected the Rams' contention that Adams had signed to play for Reeves, not a specific team. He ruled the Cleveland Rams had ceased to exist, and that Adams therefore was not bound to fulfill a contract with the Los Angeles Rams.|$|E
