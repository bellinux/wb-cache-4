5|$|The move 4.a3 allows White {{to avoid}} the {{annoying}} bishop check on b4, the also annoying knight jump to b4, and prepares Qc2 to undermine Black's knight. Both Lalic and de Firmian consider it to be White's best move, with de Firmian assessing it as leading to a large advantage for White. Lalic considers 4...b6!? to be <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>answer,</b> one point being that Qd1–c2, so effective {{in most of the}} other lines, can be met by Bc8–b7. After 5.Nd2 Bb7 6.Qc2 Lalic gives 6...Nxd2 7.Bxd2 a5! when the black bishops will be excellently placed on the b7- and c5-squares. Lalic recommends 6.Nf3 instead, while de Firmian continues by 5.Nf3Bb7 6.Nbd2 Qe7 7.Qc2 with a large advantage for White.|$|E

25|$|In Islam, {{there are}} four sources from which Muslim {{scholars}} extract religious law or rulings, and upon which they base their fatwa. The first is the Quran, which is the holy book of Islam, and which Muslims believe is the direct and literal word of God, revealed to Prophet Mohammad. The second source is the Sunnah, which incorporates anything that the Prophet Mohammad said, did or approved of. The third source is the consensus of the scholars, meaning that if the scholars of a previous generation have all agreed on a certain issue, then this consensus is regarded as representing Islam. Finally, if no scripture is found regarding a specific question from the three first sources, then an Islamic scholar performs {{what is known as}} ijtihad. This means that they use their own logic and reasoning to come up with <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>answer</b> according {{to the best of their}} ability.|$|E

2500|$|The site {{does not}} have a system that filters the correct answers from the {{incorrect}} answers. At one time, the community could vote for <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>answer</b> among the posted answers; but that option was disabled in March 2014. For most of the life of Yahoo! Answers, once the [...] "best answer" [...] was chosen, {{there was no way to}} add more answers nor to improve or challenge <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>answer</b> chosen by the question asker; there is a display of thumbs down or thumbs up for each answer, but viewers cannot vote. In April 2014, this was changed to allow for additional answers after a best answer is chosen, but <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>answer</b> can never be changed. Also, while [...] "best answers" [...] can be briefly commented upon, the comment is not visible by default and is hence hardly read. (Even the user who posts the question isn't notified, before or after <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>answer</b> is picked, about a comment on the question or on <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>answer.)</b> If <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>answer</b> chosen is wrong or contains problematic information, the only chance to give a better (or correct) answer will be the next time the same question is asked.
