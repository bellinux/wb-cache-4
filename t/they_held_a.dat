5|$|The {{need for}} {{preschool}} education {{in each country}} was assessed through research and interviews with television producers, researchers, and educational experts, which paralleled what the producers of Sesame Street did in the late 1960s. Then they convened the experts {{in a series of}} meetings, held in the individual countries, to create and develop a curriculum, the show's educational goals, and its set and characters, as was done in 1968 in the US.

5|$|After hearing NSDAP leader Hitler {{speak for}} the first time in 1920 at a Munich rally, Hess became {{completely}} devoted to him. <b>They</b> <b>held</b> <b>a</b> shared belief in the stab-in-the-back myth, the notion that Germany's loss in World War I was caused by a conspiracy of Jews and Bolsheviks rather than a military defeat. Hess joined the NSDAP on 1 July as member number 16. As the party continued to grow, holding rallies and meetings in ever larger beer halls in Munich, he focused his attention on fundraising and organisational activities. On 4 November 1921 he was injured while protecting Hitler when a bomb planted by a Marxist group exploded at the Hofbräuhaus during a party event. Hess joined the Sturmabteilung (SA) by 1922 and helped organise and recruit its early membership.|$|E
5|$|Core Design's Fighting Force (1997) was {{anticipated}} {{to redefine the}} genre for 32-bit consoles through its use of a 3D environment. However, it was met with a lukewarm reception. The Dynasty Warriors series, beginning with Dynasty Warriors 2 in 2000, offered traditional beat 'em up action on large 3D battlefields, displaying dozens of characters on the screen at a time. The series to date spans 14 games (including expansions) which players in the West view as overly similar, although the games' creators claim their large audience in Japan appreciates the subtle differences between the titles. While critics saw Dynasty Warriors 2 as innovative and technically impressive, <b>they</b> <b>held</b> <b>a</b> mixed opinion of later titles. These later games received praise for simple, enjoyable gameplay but were simultaneously derided as overly simplistic and repetitive. Another best-selling Japanese series, Yakuza, combined elaborate plots and detailed interactive environments with street brawling action. Despite these releases, game reviewers started to pronounce that the genre had died off. By 2002, there were virtually no new beat 'em ups being released in arcades.|$|E

On 17 September 1990, General Võ Nguyên Giáp {{also made a}} trip to China and thanked the Chinese Government for its past assistance. Despite outward signs of improvement in Vietnam's diplomatic relations with China, Vietnamese leaders were reluctant to endorse any peace plan which could weaken their client regime in Phnom Penh. However, as the four Cambodian factions reached an agreement on the power-sharing arrangement outlined at the Third Jakarta Informal Meeting in February 1990, Vietnam and China rapidly moved to re-establish formal diplomatic relations. In November 1991, newly elected Vietnamese Prime Minister Võ Văn Kiệt travelled to Beijing and met his Chinese counterpart, Li Peng, and they issued an 11-point communiqué re-establishing diplomatic ties {{between the two countries}} after 10 years without formal relations.|$|E
5|$|Following the station's closure, the Central Electricity Generating Board {{had planned}} to {{demolish}} the station and sell the land for housing, {{but because of the}} building's then Grade II listed status, they had to pay the high-cost of preserving the building. In 1983 <b>they</b> <b>held</b> <b>a</b> competition for ideas on the redevelopment of the site. It was won by a consortium led by developer David Roche and which included John Broome, owner of Alton Towers Ltd. This consortium proposed an indoor theme park, with shops and restaurants. At an estimated cost of £35million, the scheme was risky and would require over 2million visitors a year to make any profit. The scheme received planning approval in May 1986 and the site was purchased by John Broome for £1.5million in 1987. Work on converting the site began the same year.|$|E
5|$|In June 1963 the Spokane Comets Western Hockey League {{franchise}} {{was purchased}} by a group led by the Maple Leafs, who relocated them to become the Denver Invaders and act as the Leaf's farm team. Though the league did not acknowledge that the Maple Leafs had an ownership stake in the team, <b>they</b> <b>held</b> <b>a</b> majority position with the Denver partners only owning roughly 36%. Following reported losses of $150,000 in their first season, Smythe announced that the team would be relocated after the team failed to reach a 2,000 season ticket target by a league-imposed deadline. The team became the Victoria Maple Leafs for the following season. In June 1967 MLGL sold the team for $500,000 to a group from Phoenix, which relocated it to become the Phoenix Roadrunners.|$|E

5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1913, Stojanović {{commenced}} {{the final year of}} his secondary education. National Unity was visited that year by a group of activists of Young Bosnia who were university students in Prague, Vienna, and Switzerland. <b>They</b> <b>held</b> <b>a</b> series of lectures for the members of the association, explaining their views on the current political situation, and promoting the unity of South Slavic peoples in their struggle to liberate themselves from Austria-Hungary. These lectures influenced Stojanović to adopt a Yugoslavist stance. At the beginning of 1914, Ilić and Stojanović became, respectively, the president and the vice-president of National Unity, which numbered 34 members, including four Muslims and four Croats. At that time, National Unity {{was one of the most}} active groups of Young Bosnia.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, CMLL left the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) but {{retained}} {{control of the}} NWA World Welterweight Championship as their main championship of the welterweight division. They also promoted the Mexican National Welterweight Championship as a secondary title for the Welterweight division. In 1991 they decided to create a series of CMLL-branded world championships, {{one of which was}} for the welterweight division. <b>They</b> <b>held</b> <b>a</b> four-man tournament on February 15, 1992, to crown the first welterweight champion. The participants were Fuerza Guerrera, El Felino, América and El Khalifa; in the finals, Fuerza Guerrera defeated El Khalifa to become the first champion. On July 16, 1992, the Mexican National Welterweight Champion defeated CMLL Welterweight Champion América, vacating the Mexican National Welterweight Championship.

5|$|The Australian 3rd and 4th Divisions {{had been}} sent south to help {{stem the tide of}} the German Spring Offensive towards Amiens, and with the British 35th Division, <b>they</b> <b>held</b> <b>a</b> line west and north of the Ancre river and the area between the Ancre and Somme. Much of the Allied front line {{consisted}} of a series of posts strung out along a railway embankment between Albert and Buire-sur-l'Ancre. The main German assault force was the 50th Reserve Division of the XXIII Reserve Corps, which concentrated its assault on the line between Albert and Dernancourt, attacking off the line of march after a short artillery preparation. Supporting attacks were to be launched by the 13th Division further west. Some German commanders considered success unlikely unless the embankment was weakly held, and the commander of the German 2nd Army ordered the attack's postponement, but that message did not reach the assaulting troops in time.|$|E
5|$|The Greeks {{used the}} word planēton {{to refer to the}} seven {{celestial}} bodies that moved with respect to the background stars and <b>they</b> <b>held</b> <b>a</b> geocentric view that these bodies moved about the Earth. In his work, The Republic (X.616E–617B), the Greek philosopher Plato provided the oldest known statement defining the order of the planets in Greek astronomical tradition. His list, in order of the nearest to the most distant from the Earth, was as follows: the Moon, Sun, Venus, Mercury, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and the fixed stars. In his dialogue Timaeus, Plato proposed that the progression of these objects across the skies depended on their distance, so that the most distant object moved the slowest.|$|E
5|$|With Cayenne under British control, Topaze {{made all}} speed for Guadeloupe, Lahalle {{intending}} to land his food supplies and reinforcements on French held territory before attempting the return journey to Europe. For nine days Topaze crossed the Caribbean without encountering any British warships, but at 07:00 on 22 January she was spotted approaching Guadeloupe {{from the southwest}} by the brig HMS Hazard under Captain Hugh Cameron, {{which was part of}} a squadron detached from Cochrane's invasion fleet on Barbados to watch the French islands. Although his lookouts had also sighted a French schooner close inshore, Cameron gave orders for his brig to close with the much larger French frigate instead. Within two hours, Hazard was joined by the frigates HMS Cleopatra under Captain Samuel Pechell and HMS Jason under Captain William Maude. Although both ships were smaller than Topaze, together <b>they</b> <b>held</b> <b>a</b> considerable advantage over the overladen French ship.|$|E

5|$|Presidential {{elections}} in Singapore, {{in which the}} President of Singapore is directly elected by popular vote, were introduced through amendments to the Constitution of Singapore in 1991. Potential candidates for office have to fulfil stringent qualifications {{set out in the}} Constitution. Certificates of eligibility are issued by the Presidential Elections Committee (PEC). In particular, the PEC must assess that they are persons of integrity, good character and reputation; and if they have not previously held certain key government appointments or were the chief executives of profitable companies with shareholders' equity of an average of S$500 million for the most recent three years in that office, they must demonstrate to the PEC that <b>they</b> <b>held</b> <b>a</b> position of comparable seniority and responsibility in the public or private sector that has given them experience and ability in administering and managing financial affairs. The general strictness of the required qualifications led to the walkovers in 3 out of 5 of the presidential elections, as presidents S. R. Nathan and Halimah Yacob were the sole candidates to receive a certificate of eligibility from the PEC in their respective years in the 1999, 2005 and 2017 elections. The stringent criteria, the transparency of the PEC's decision-making process and the practice of political parties endorsing candidates have drawn criticism.|$|E
5|$|The Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenesrenamed Yugoslavia in 1929was {{created on}} 1December 1918, and {{incorporated}} Bosnia-Herzegovina. Stojanović continued studying medicine in Zagreb. As a former activist of Young Bosnia, {{he was offered}} a King's scholarship but he refused it. In Zagreb, he reunited with his former schoolmate Nikola Nikolić, who had also {{been a member of}} National Unity. After his release from the Zenica prison, Nikolić was drafted into the Austrian army and sent to the Russian front where he surrendered to the Russians and participated in the October Revolution. Nikolić's account of the revolution influenced Stojanović to adopt a more leftist stance. During this period, Stojanović's favourite authors were Maksim Gorky and Miroslav Krleža. His professor of anatomy, Drago Perović, arranged for him to visit an anatomical institute in Vienna. Stojanović went there several times in 1921 and 1922 and befriended members of a leftist association of Yugoslav students at the Vienna University. When <b>they</b> <b>held</b> <b>a</b> protest against the king and government of Yugoslavia, Stojanović took part and delivered a speech. Behind the protest stood the Communist Party of Yugoslavia (Komunistička partija Jugoslavije, KPJ).|$|E
5|$|The {{match against}} England was causing the Natives' players and {{management}} problems {{before it had}} even begun. The team manager, Scott, was in dispute with the RFU over where the match should be played– the RFU were adamant that the match should take place at Blackheath's ground, but Scott wanted the game to proceed at The Oval, where a larger crowd, and therefore higher gate receipts, could be secured. The strictly amateur RFU establishment were already suspicious of the profit-making motives of the Natives, and were unwilling to yield on the selection of venue. The RFU was also in dispute with the other Home Unions over {{the formation of the}} International Rugby Football Board (IRFB). Following a disputed try in an England–Scotland international match in 1888, the Scottish authorities had pushed for the establishment of an international body to oversee the game, but the RFU insisted that they would only join if <b>they</b> <b>held</b> <b>a</b> deciding vote, arguing that they deserved this as they were, they asserted, the senior body, and had the most member clubs. Ireland, Wales and Scotland consequently refused to play against England until 1891, when, following arbitration, the RFU relented and joined the IRFB. The absence of international matches was a factor in England agreeing to face the Natives on 16 February 1889.|$|E
