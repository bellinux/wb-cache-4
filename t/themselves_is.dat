5|$|Both of Wollstonecraft's novels also {{critique}} {{the discourse}} of sensibility, a moral philosophy and aesthetic that had become popular {{at the end of}} the eighteenth century. Mary is itself a novel of sensibility and Wollstonecraft attempts to use the tropes of that genre to undermine sentimentalism itself, a philosophy she believed was damaging to women because it encouraged them to rely overmuch on their emotions. In The Wrongs of Woman the heroine's indulgence on romantic fantasies fostered by novels <b>themselves</b> <b>is</b> depicted as particularly detrimental.|$|E
5|$|The {{intermittent}} Roman {{presence in}} Scotland {{coincided with the}} emergence of the Picts, a confederation of tribes who lived {{to the north of the}} Forth and Clyde from Roman times until the 10th century. They are often assumed to have been the descendants of the Caledonians though the evidence for this connection is circumstantial and the name by which the Picts called <b>themselves</b> <b>is</b> unknown. They are often said to have tattooed themselves, but evidence for this is limited. Naturalistic depictions of Pictish nobles, hunters and warriors, male and female, without obvious tattoos, are found on their monumental stones. The Gaels of Dalriada called the Picts Cruithne, and Irish poets portrayed their Pictish counterparts as very much like themselves.|$|E

25|$|Suburbs {{typically}} have longer travel times to work than traditional neighborhoods. Only the traffic within the short streets <b>themselves</b> <b>is</b> less. This {{is due to}} three factors: almost-mandatory automobile ownership due to poor suburban bus systems, longer travel distances and the hierarchy system, which is less efficient at distributing traffic than the traditional grid of streets.|$|E
25|$|The {{taxonomy}} {{of the genus}} has long been unclear. Study of the plants <b>themselves</b> <b>is</b> difficult because only fresh specimens {{can be used in}} the clear differentiation of taxa; many useful characters are not present in dry herbarium specimens. Many sources accept the genus, but some authors continue to question its validity. Molecular genetic studies revealed, that Sarcocornia/Salicornia form a monophyletic group, and Sarcocornia is paraphyletic.|$|E

There are several annals used by H.J. de Graaf in his histories such as Babad Sangkala and Babad Momana which contain list of events and dates in Javanese calendar (A.J., Anno Javanicus), but besides de Graaf’s questionable practice of simply adding 78 to Javanese years to obtain corresponding Christian years, the agreement between Javanese sources <b>themselves</b> <b>is</b> less than perfect.|$|E

Echoing his experience in botching {{the recovery of the}} Necronomicon, Ash mishandles the specific instructions for the potion, accidentally taking an extra dose after a momentary distraction makes him lose count. Ash awakes and arises from his cave to find himself in a post-apocalyptic future, in which the city of London is in ruins.|$|E

25|$|The Halieutica is a fragmentary didactic poem in 134 poorly {{preserved}} hexameter {{lines and}} is considered spurious. The poem begins by describing how every animal possesses the ability to protect itself and how fish use ars to help themselves. The ability of dogs and land creatures to protect <b>themselves</b> <b>is</b> described. The poem goes on to list the places best for fishing, and which types of fish to catch. Although Pliny the Elder mentions a Halieutica by Ovid, which was composed at Tomis {{near the end of}} Ovid's life, modern scholars believe Pliny was mistaken in his attribution and that the poem is not genuine.|$|E
