40|$|IntroductionIn 2006, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) passed {{regulations}} {{for child care}} centers that established standards for beverages provided to children and set a minimum amount of time for daily physical activity. DOHMH offered several types of training and <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> to support compliance with the regulations. This article analyzes the association between training and <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> provided and compliance with the regulations {{in a sample of}} 174 group child care centers. MethodsCompliance was measured by using a site inventory of beverages stored on premises and a survey of centers 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 teachers regarding the amount of physical activity provided. Training and <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>measures</b> were based on the DOHMH records of training and <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> provided to the centers in the sample and on a survey of center directors. Ordinal logistic regression was used to assess the association between training and <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>measures</b> and compliance with the regulations. ResultsMeasures of training related to physical activity the center received: the number of staff members who participated in Sport, Play and Active Recreation for Kids (SPARK) and other training programs in which a center participated were associated with better compliance with the physical activity regulations. Neither training nor <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> were associated with compliance with the regulations related to beverages. ConclusionIncreased compliance with regulations pertaining to physical activity was not related to compliance with beverage regulations. Future trainings should be targeted to the specific regulation requirements to increase compliance...|$|R

Given that young children spend large amounts of time in child care centers, this may be an ideal venue for increasing consumption of and enthusiasm for fruits and vegetables. This pilot study aimed to assess the feasibility of a gardening intervention to promote vegetable and fruit intake among preschoolers. METHODS: We enrolled two intervention centers and two control centers. The intervention included a {{fruit and vegetable}} garden, monthly curriculum, gardening support, and <b>technical</b> <b>assistance.</b> We <b>measured</b> mean (SD) servings {{of fruits and vegetables}} served to and consumed by three children per center before and after the intervention. RESULTS: Post intervention, intervention and control centers served fewer vegetables (mean (standard deviation) difference of - 0. 18 (0. 63) in intervention, - 0. 37 (0. 36) in control), but intervention children consumed more than control children (+ 0. 25 (1. 11) vs. - 0. 18 (0. 52). The number of fruits served decreased in all centers (intervention - 0. 62 (0. 58) vs. control - 0. 10 (0. 52)) but consumption was higher in controls (intervention - 0. 32 (0. 58) vs. control 0. 15 (0. 26)).

40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "This testimony discusses the results of GAO's review of the Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> and capacity-building programs. <b>Technical</b> <b>assistance</b> programs {{can be defined as}} training designed to improve the performance or management of program recipients, such as teaching one-on-one procurement regulations to housing authority staff. Capacity building can be generally defined as funding to strengthen the capacity or capability of program recipients or providers [...] typically housing or community development organizations [...] thereby building the institutional knowledge within those organizations. The overall goal of both <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> and capacity building is to enhance the delivery of HUD's housing and community development programs. HUD administers 21 <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> programs through five program offices. From fiscal year 1998 through fiscal year 2002, the annual funding for HUD <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> ranged between $ 128 million and $ 201 million, accounting for less than 1 percent of HUD's overall budget each year. Although the general purpose of HUD's <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> is to help program participants carry out HUD program goals, each program office designs <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> specifically related to its programs. Recipients could be states and units of local government, public or Indian housing agencies, private and nonprofit organizations, or individuals. Providers could be HUD officials or, more commonly, state or local governments, profit and nonprofit organizations, or public housing agencies. HUD awards funding for 17 of the 21 <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> programs competitively. The funding for the remaining programs is awarded noncompetitively. HUD uses three types of funding instruments and determines which type to use {{on the basis of its}} relationship with the awardee and the level of federal involvement anticipated. All five HUD program offices perform basic oversight of the <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> they administer, such as visually observing the <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> or reviewing reports submitted by the providers to ensure that the <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> was provided. In addition, some program offices also have impact measures in place.

After giving {{a brief history}} of tecnhical assistance and the problems commonly associated with it, he describes classifications of <b>technical</b> <b>assistance,</b> proposes a new typology to be used for project appraisal, suggests methods for screening projects, and discusses different levels of economic analysis. He shows how the typology and economic analysis could be applied to 40 projects in the Europe and Central Asia region, Although some of the suggested approaches are sophisticated and demanding, much of it relies on fairly simple techniques. The author estimates that roughly 60 percent of the <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> in his sample was suitable for quantitative analysis. Using four case studies, he demonstrates how quantitative economic analysis could be used more frequently in the appraisal process. The author recommends that all <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> be classified according to the methodology suitable for its appraisal and evaluation. In cases in which little or no quantitative analysis is used, the staff officer can and should provide a justification -in which case it should still be possible to conceptualize the problem in economic terms. Essential <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> should be included when calculating the economic rate of return on a project. When <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> is excluded from this calculation, a strong justification for such assistance should be given or it should be omitted from the project.

A content analysis was conducted to assess size using traditional transactional and transformational change definitions, and a survey questionnaire was used to assess size from the perspective of the <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> recipients.
