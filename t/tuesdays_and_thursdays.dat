25|$|One of {{his first}} acts as Prime Minister, was to replace the then twice-weekly 15-minute {{sessions}} of Prime Minister's Questions held on <b>Tuesdays</b> <b>and</b> <b>Thursdays</b> with a single 30-minute session on Wednesdays. In addition to PMQs, Blair held monthly press conferences at which he fielded questions from journalists and – from 2002 – broke precedent by agreeing to give evidence twice yearly before the most senior Commons select committee, the Liaison Committee. Blair was sometimes perceived as paying insufficient attention both to the views of his own Cabinet colleagues and {{to those of the}} House of Commons. His style was sometimes criticised as not that of a prime minister and head of government, which he was, but of a president and head of state – which he was not. Blair was accused of excessive reliance on spin. He is the first UK prime minister to have been formally questioned by police, though not under caution, while still in office.|$|E
25|$|The Mossburn Branch did {{not have}} a {{predictable}} demise, however. Mossburn was the nearest railhead to the Manapouri hydro-electric project and the branch suddenly became very busy with traffic not only for Manapouri but also for other government schemes in the area that centred on the development of farming. Mossburn station and yard were wholly re-organised; a modern station building replaced the previous shelter shed and a station master was appointed. A train ran from Invercargill every weekday, with allowances made for a second when required. As well as relevant freight for the Manapouri project, the line also carried significant quantities of livestock, fertiliser, and serpentine for local fertiliser manufacturing plants. It was not until around 1980 that the various government projects wound down and required the railway less. The line reverted to a twice weekly level of service, with trains running from Invercargill on <b>Tuesdays</b> <b>and</b> <b>Thursdays.</b> Traffic from this point became economically unsustainable and the branch closed on 13 December 1982, the same day as the section of the Kingston Branch from Makarewa to Lumsden.|$|E
25|$|In New Zealand, Coronation Street {{has been}} shown locally since 1964, first on NZBC {{television}} until 1975, and then on TV One, which broadcasts it in a 4-episode/2-hour block on Fridays from 7:30pm. Since September 2014, TV One has added a 2-episode/1-hour block on Saturday from 8:30pm. Because TV One has never upgraded to showing the equivalent of five episodes per week, New Zealand continues to fall further and further behind with episodes, and is 23 months behind Britain (as of 28 March 2014). During the weekday nights of the week ending 11 April 2014 and previous weeks, Coronation Street was the least watched programme on TV One in the 7:30pm slot by a considerable margin in comparison to other weeknights, The serial aired on <b>Tuesdays</b> <b>and</b> <b>Thursdays</b> at 7:30pm until October 2011, when the show moved to a 5:30pm half-hour slot every weekday. The move proved unpopular with fans, and the series was quickly moved into its present prime-time slot within weeks. Episodes 7883, 7884, 7885 and 7886 were screened on 16 May 2014. These were originally aired in the UK between 4 and 11 June 2012.|$|E

25|$|In 1989, RTÉ {{decided to}} produce its first Dublin-based soap opera since the 1960s. Fair City, {{which is set}} in the fictional city of Carrickstown, {{initially}} aired one night a week during the 1989-90 season, and similar to its rural soaps, much of the footage was filmed on location – in a suburb of Dublin City. In 1992, RTÉ made a major investment into the series by copying the houses used in the on-location shoots for an on-site set in RTÉ's Headquarters in Dublin 4. By the early 1990s, it was airing two nights a week for 35 weeks a year. With competition from the UK soap operas, RTÉ expanded Fair City to three nights a week for most of the year and one night a week during the summer in 1996, later expanding to four nights a week and two nights during the summer. Until the early 2000s, the series produced four episodes a week, airing all 52 weeks of the year. Fair City airs Sundays, <b>Tuesdays</b> <b>and</b> <b>Thursdays</b> at 8.00 p.m. GMT on RTÉ One; however, after rival network TV3 moved Coronation Street to Thursday night, the Wednesday night episode of Fair City began airing at 7:30p.m. each week.|$|E
500|$|It was {{published}} {{twice a week}} (on <b>Tuesdays</b> <b>and</b> <b>Thursdays)</b> in Leiden (hence its popular unofficial name, Gazette de Leyde). The newspaper usually contained eight pages arranged as a four-page booklet. The size varied; surviving examples are generally [...] by [...] or [...] by , in which the text is organized into two columns. A four-page, single column supplement {{was published}} from 1753. The paper quality varied, war time conditions often enforced use of low quality stock, and the print was small and cramped. Subscriptions from France amounted to over 2,500 by 1778, at an annual cost of 36 livres.|$|E
500|$|Other {{staff at}} The Political Cesspool include Bill Rolen, Eddie [...] "The Bombardier" [...] Miller, Keith Alexander, and Winston Smith. According to the show's website, {{most of the}} staff claim descent from Confederate soldiers. The show was {{initially}} broadcast on AM1600 WMQM, a Memphis-based radio station, on <b>Tuesdays</b> <b>and</b> <b>Thursdays.</b> Edwards and Farley invited friends Bill Rolen, {{a board member of}} the Council of Conservative Citizens, and Jess Bonds as guest hosts, as well as radio technician Art Frith. Frith had previously worked for a number of other radio stations including American Forces Radio and Television Service (AFRTS) (in Keflavik, Iceland; Anchorage, Alaska; and Nea Makri, Greece), KFQD (in Anchorage), and WBCK (in Battle Creek, Michigan).|$|E

500|$|In early August 2007, upon {{rumors of}} Jorja Fox leaving the show, a {{grassroots}} campaign started. Thousands of fans {{donated to the}} cause, {{and they had a}} plane flying over the Universal Studios of Los Angeles weekly on <b>Tuesdays</b> <b>and</b> <b>Thursdays</b> with a [...] "Keep Jorja Fox on CBS" [...] banner for a month. The online forum Your Tax Dollars at Work, which has about 15,000 members and has organized the campaign, created another campaign that includes mailing the show's producers a dollar, so as to keep Fox on the show. By October 5, 2007, more than $3,500 had reportedly been mailed to the Universal Studios from forty-nine countries. The campaign had started less than a week before, on September 29, 2007.|$|E
500|$|Storm's {{first name}} for a group was [...] "Dracula & the Werewolves", but he then settled on [...] "Al Caldwell's Texans". Still known as Alan Caldwell, Storm opened the Morgue Skiffle Club in the cellar of a large Victorian house, [...] "Balgownie", at 25 Oakhill Park, Broadgreen, on 13 March 1958. The cellar {{consisted}} of two rooms, painted black and connected by a long corridor, with skeletons painted {{on the walls and}} one blue light. Groups played on <b>Tuesdays</b> <b>and</b> <b>Thursdays</b> for up to 100 people (above the age of 15) starting at 7:30pm, including Storm's group (later called [...] "The Raving Texans") and the Quarrymen (who later became [...] "the Beatles"). After complaints about the noise, the police closed down the club on 1 April 1958, but Storm reopened it on 22 April 1958. It was in the Morgue Skiffle Club that George Harrison auditioned for the Quarrymen, playing [...] "Guitar Boogie Shuffle" [...] by Bert Weedon, before being admitted {{as a member of the}} band. Harrison later asked Storm if he could join his group, but Storm's mother refused to allow it, as she thought Harrison was too young.|$|E
500|$|The series {{then changed}} to two episodes, each of thirty minutes on <b>Tuesdays</b> <b>and</b> <b>Thursdays,</b> per week in 1988 (from July 1988 onwards, the series also began being {{broadcast}} {{all year round}} without a summer break), increasing to three a week beginning in 1993, with the third episode being broadcast on Fridays. In 1998, The Bill returned to hour-long episodes, which later became twice-weekly, with the Friday episode being dropped, {{at which point the}} series adopted a much more serialised approach. When Paul Marquess took over as executive producer in 2002, as part of a drive for ratings, the series was revamped, bringing in a more soap opera type feel to many of its stories. Many veteran characters were written out, leading to the Sun Hill fire during 2002. Marquess stated that the clearout was necessary to introduce [...] "plausible, powerful new characters". As part of the new serial format, much more of the characters' personal lives were explored, however, as Marquess put it, the viewers still [...] "don't go home with them". The change also allowed The Bill to become more reflective of modern policing with the introduction of officers from ethnic minorities, most notably the new superintendent, Adam Okaro. It also allowed coverage of the relationship of homosexual Sergeant Craig Gilmore and PC Luke Ashton, a storyline which Marquess was determined to explore before rival Merseybeat.|$|E
