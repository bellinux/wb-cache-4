5|$|For a {{short time}} during his playing days with the Giants, Bonds {{temporarily}} changed his demeanor {{at the behest of}} a group of teammates, resulting in him smiling much more frequently and engaging more with others with a pleasant demeanor. Shortly thereafter, {{in the midst of a}} slump, the same group of teammates pleaded that he revert, having seemingly lost his competitive edge, and causing the team lose more. In spite of his protest that they would not appreciate the results, his teammates insisted, and Bonds complied, maintaining <b>that</b> <b>familiar</b> standoffish edge the rest of his playing career.|$|E

25|$|Ellis collaborated {{closely with}} Meloy {{throughout}} the writing phase to produce 85 illustrations, which, {{along with the}} old-fashioned book design, were particularly praised by reviewers. The majority of reviews were positive, on balance, saying the book was an engrossing story appropriate for its target age, but they {{also noted that the}} plot sometimes dragged, <b>that</b> <b>familiar</b> fantasy motifs were sometimes overused, and that stereotypical Portland culture was a little overplayed. Wildwood was on the New York Times Best Seller list of Children's Chapter Books for two weeks and tied for the 2012 E.B. White Read Aloud Award.|$|E

500|$|Chekhov now assumed {{responsibility}} for the whole family.

His prodigious output gradually earned him {{a reputation as a}} satirical chronicler of Russian street life, and by 1882 he was writing for Oskolki (Fragments), owned by Nikolai Leykin, one of the leading publishers of the time.

500|$|The {{influence}} of several contemporary bands was deemed apparent upon {{the sound of}} the album. Robin Jahdi writes that [...] "the Isis sound, debuted proper on the 2002 album, is still present and correct, but there's more subtle shifts in mood here, most interestingly when they take influence from outside (Tool's Adam Jones plays on two songs). The basslines bounce and jolt with <b>that</b> <b>familiar</b> elasticity, but the seismic six-string shifts on songs like 'Hand of the Host' and '20 Minutes / 40 Years' are the sort not heard from this band in years. It is no coincidence that these are highlights." [...] The rhythms of [...] "20 Minutes / 40 Years" [...] are described as [...] "Pelican-like" [...] by NME reviewer Ben Patashnik, and No Ripcords Sean Caldwell compares the album to Mastodon's Blood Mountain, citing its potential for [...] "crossover" [...] appeal.|$|E
500|$|Ships would {{generally}} seek repairs in Honolulu, but captains preferred anchoring off Lahaina {{because of}} its easy access from the Lahaina Roads and for the fresh provisions available in town. [...] According to Henry L. Sheldon, [...] "the business of the entire population was the furnishing of supplies to whalers and entertaining the crews". Sailors who had been hunting whales {{for months at a}} time went to Lahaina to drink grog and meet women. Historian Noelani M. Arista notes that by 1825; a kapu prohibiting women from going out to ships for the purpose of prostitution was proclaimed by the ali'i (Hawaiian chiefs), altering <b>that</b> <b>familiar</b> traffic of the burgeoning Pacific seaport towns. Enraged that they could not cajole, coax, or coerce Hawaiian women into violating the kapu, the sailors turned their frustrations on the American missionaries, whom they blamed for the emergence of this new unreasonably strict moral law.|$|E
500|$|... "The Bill" [...] {{opens with}} the mundane {{image of a}} number of men eating at a {{restaurant}} and arguing about the bill, but then [...] "takes <b>that</b> <b>familiar</b> scenario and pushes it to impressively baroque extremes". In a reversal of the norm, all diners want to pay the whole bill, rather than wanting to limit their payment. In this dispute, [...] "The Bill" [...] explores themes of masculinity, losing face, competitiveness, passive aggression and rivalry. Andrew Billen, writing in The Times, compared this aspect of the episode to Mad Dogs, which had also starred Glenister; one critic suggested that Glenister's character in Mad Dogs and Craig in [...] "The Bill" [...] are close. The characters tell [...] "well-rehearsed anecdotes and blokey jokes", while Craig is [...] "all flash-cash and inappropriate comments to the waitress". Pemberton's Malcolm, for Michael Hogan of the Daily Telegraph, [...] "appeared to have wandered in" [...] from a Mike Leigh production; a number of critics commented on his striking hairpiece. All four of the men are unpleasant people.|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{focuses on}} the bonds between accused witches and demonic familiars in early modern England by {{examining}} three case studies: Joan Prentice (1589), the Flower witches (1619) and the Bideford witches (1680 s). It explores how these accused witches described the emotional bond between themselves and their familiar spirits and argues <b>that</b> <b>familiars</b> were understood as demonic creatures who allowed a suspected witch to act on her emotional desires. Further, it suggests <b>that</b> the <b>familiar</b> spirit {{can be viewed as}} a physical manifestation of a witch’s inner emotional state. The chapter examines how witches’ narratives, as retold in pamphlets, used the familiar spirit to explain their uncontrolled desires...|$|R

500|$|Television {{columnist}} Alan Sepinwall for The Star-Ledger {{commented that}} this episode [...] "felt really flat", citing that the plots [...] "were fine, but {{they needed to}} be taken further" [...] and that they [...] "were almost there, but needed one more pass through the script." [...] IGN contributor Robert Canning said that his favorite storyline in the episode was Jack and Frank's, and enjoyed Lupone's role, but noted that the episode [...] "lacked <b>that</b> <b>familiar</b> 30 Rock punch and tight rhythm", and gave the episode a 7.8 out 10 rating. Rick Porter of Zap2it said that [...] "Goodbye, My Friend" [...] had its [...] "usual share of brilliantly funny moments, but I'm not sure whether I can fully get behind an episode that hangs an entire subplot on the subtleties of Harry and the Hendersons." [...] He observed that Liz's [...] "baby fever" [...] came of out of nowhere, as the show had not referenced Liz's desire of becoming a mother for some time. Porter wrote that Jenna's fake injury was mostly a throwaway, [...] "but it did bring my favorite line of the night", in regards to Tracy explaining that he does not have a birth certificate and therefore has never had a birthday. [...] "I don't need it. I buy myself all the presents I need. And because of my drinking, I'm often surprised." ...|$|E
500|$|The song {{has been}} {{generally}} well received by critics. Many reviewers were pleased {{with what they}} saw as a return-to-form sound reminiscent of the Blue Album (1994) and Pinkerton (1996) albums. Pitchfork Media writer Marc Hogan gave the song a positive review and described the song as, [...] "a catchy, self-referential rocker, with the buzzsaw guitars and big choruses of Weezer's glory days, and <b>that</b> <b>familiar,</b> self-assured lameness." [...] Simon Vozick-Levinson of Entertainment Weekly also gave the song a positive review, [...] "That chunka-chunka guitar hook is pure [...] gold, so much so that I didn't focus on Rivers Cuomo's very clever lyrics at first." [...] Stereogum was also impressed with the song stating it was a [...] "sweet, savory dose of self-referential, self-deprecating Weezer rock... This stuff sounds very familiar in a good, good way." [...] NME described the song as having [...] " [...] best chorus in ages". However, Internet reviewer David Ritter speculated that the song was either [...] "voided by the wholesale capitulation involved in going home and writing said commercial material" [...] or [...] "a calculated attempt to boost record sales by wrapping faux-defiance in pretty paper," [...] going on to compliment its [...] "Scorcho-y acoustic guitar," [...] he then said that this, along with the [...] "keyboard twinkles" [...] and [...] "squeals and squeaks", has little effect on the song and that they barely register on top of the much more noticeable lead vocals and power chords.|$|E

[...] Then he'll get excited, and dressed though he is in top form, will rush right into a scrimmage and show 'em how it should be done, no matter how muddy the field. [...] Practice over, Tom will go back to the Taft and order another suit. [...] He seems to have a new suit of clothes every day."In November 1915, Shevlin led Yale to a 13-7 win over Princeton in front of 50,000 fans at New Haven—the largest crowd ever to view a Yale-Princeton game. [...] After the game, Shevlin was haled as [...] "the miracle man of football" [...] who had [...] "saved Yale from the worst gridiorn defeat in her history." [...] Shevlin had been called east in October 1915 and was credited with having [...] "made order out of chaos" [...] in just two weeks training the Yale team.|$|E

On September 11, 2010, however, at a roast of Rose held at Hollywood Casino Lawrenceburg in Indiana on the 25th {{anniversary of his}} 4,192nd hit and attended by many teammates, Rose wept while acknowledging he had [...] "disrespected baseball". He apologized to Pérez {{and other members of}} the Big Red Machine, stating, [...] "I guarantee everyone in this room I will never disrespect you again.

2500|$|Some cunning folk {{were said}} to employ supernatural {{entities}} known as familiar spirits to aid them in their practice of magic. These spirits, which were also believed to work for witches as well, are referenced {{in many of the}} witch trial records from the Early Modern period. After examining these accounts, historian Emma Wilby noted how in the descriptions given of familiar spirits by both cunning folk and those accused of witchcraft, there was [...] "a pervading sense of naturalism", with most familiars resembling [...] "relatively ordinary humans or animals with only slight, if any, visual anomalies." [...] For instance, folklorist Eric Maple noted that in the English region of East Anglia during the latter nineteenth century, it was commonly thought <b>that</b> <b>familiar</b> spirits, which were often referred to as [...] "imps" [...] in that region, took the form of white mice. There were however some exceptions to these naturalistic familiars, for instance a woman in Cambridgeshire was believed to have a familiar spirit that was a cross between a frog and a rat.|$|E

The Times said that Monckton and Talbot had surpassed themselves in their music, and that Courtneidge's production [...] "showed ingenuity, care {{and to some extent}} originality, so <b>that</b> <b>familiar</b> elements took on an unfamiliar look and that new things had their full effect." [...] The Daily Express observed, [...] "surely it is a long time since an audience enjoyed a first night as much as this … [...] has achieved the seemingly impossible.

2500|$|In England <b>that</b> <b>familiar</b> style {{known as}} Elizabethan and Jacobean prevailed {{throughout}} the 16th and 17th centuries. At {{the present time}} hardly {{a home in the}} land has not its old oak chest carved with the familiar half circle or scroll border along the top rail, or the arch pattern on the panels. The court cupboards, with their solid or open under parts and upper cornice supported by turned balusters of extravagant thickness, are to be seen wherever one goes. And chairs, real as well as spurious, with solid backs carved in the usual flat relief, are bought up with an avidity inseparable from fashion. Four-post bedsteads are harder to come by. The back is usually broken up into small panels and carved, the best effect being seen in those examples where the paneling or the framework only is decorated. The dining-hall tables often had six legs of great substance, which were turned somewhat after the shape of a covered cup, and were carved with foliage bearing a distant resemblance to the acanthus. Rooms were generally panelled with oak, sometimes divided at intervals by flat pilasters and the upper frieze carved with scroll work or dolphins. But the feature which distinguished the period was the fire mantle. It always must be the principal object in a room, and the Elizabethan carver fully appreciated this fact. By carving the chimney breast as a rule to the ceiling and covering the surrounding walls with more or less plain paneling, the designer, by thus concentrating the attention on one point, often produced results of a high order. Caryatid figures, pilasters and friezes were among the customary details employed to produce good effects. No finer example exists than that lately removed from the old palace at Bromley-by-Bow to the Victoria and Albert Museum. The mantelshelf is [...] from the ground and consists of a deep quadrant mould decorated with flat scroll work of good design. The supporting pilasters on either side are shaped and moulded in the customary Jacobean manner and are crowned by busts with Ionic capitals on the heads. Above the shelf the large center panel is deeply carved with the royal coat of arms with supporters and mantling, and on either side a semicircular arched niche contains a figure in classic dress. The Elizabethan carver often produced splendid staircases, sometimes carving the newel posts with heraldic figures bearing coats of arms, etc. The newels of a staircase at Highgate support different types of Cromwellian soldiers, carved with great vivacity and life. But in spite of excellent work, as for example the beautiful gallery at Hatfield, the carving of this period did not, so far as England was concerned, compare with other epochs, or with contemporary work in other parts of Europe. Much of the work is badly drawn and badly executed. It is true that good decorative effects were constantly obtained at the very minimum of cost, {{but it is difficult to}} discover much merit in work which really looks best when badly cut.|$|E
