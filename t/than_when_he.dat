5|$|In 1958, Howe {{was made}} {{chancellor}} of Dalhousie University. On investigating the university's finances, {{he found that}} a professor's salary in 1958 had less buying power <b>than</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> had worked there. Howe urged increased salaries and building improvements to attract first-rate scholars to the university. He also accepted a number of honorary degrees from other universities.|$|E

5|$|Fast {{was called}} up to the Rangers in April 2014 to replace Chris Kreider, who {{suffered}} a left hand injury. Playing on a line with Hagelin and Brad Richards, Fast played in New York's last three regular season games, as well as three post-season matches. He recorded his first career NHL playoff point with an assist in Game 1 of the Metropolitan Division Semifinal against the Philadelphia Flyers on April 17. At {{the conclusion of the}} season, the Rangers coaching staff told Fast to add strength, so he worked on his upper body and leg strength during the off-season, adding 10 to 15pounds of muscle, bringing him to 20pounds heavier <b>than</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was drafted in 2010.|$|E
5|$|McLean's favoured {{position}} is {{as a central}} midfielder, but he can also play as a left midfielder. He {{has said that he}} favours playing in the centre because he can get more of the ball and influence play more <b>than</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> is on the left. He is a naturally attacking player and when playing in the centre he makes runs to and beyond the striker which adds an extra dimension to his team's play.|$|E
5|$|Fauré's new {{position}} left him better off financially. However, while he also {{became much more}} widely known as a composer, running the Conservatoire left him with no more time for composition <b>than</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was struggling {{to earn a living}} as an organist and piano teacher. As soon as the working year was over, in the last days of July, he would leave Paris and spend the two months until early October in a hotel, usually by one of the Swiss lakes, to concentrate on composition. His works from this period include his lyric opera, Pénélope (1913), and some of his most characteristic later songs (e.g., the cycle La chanson d'Ève, Op. 95, completed in 1910) and piano pieces (Nocturnes Nos. 9–11; Barcarolles Nos. 7–11, written between 1906 and 1914).|$|E

25|$|Shariff's {{popularity}} {{started to}} slide after 2001.

He won less votes and percent <b>than</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was first elected in the 1995 by-election. The two faced {{each other in the}} 2008 election with the reverse result.

Unfortunately, Kennedy left her after the disastrous Queen Kelly and her finances were in worse shape <b>than</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> came into her life. Two books have been written about the affair.|$|E
25|$|In March 1837, Emerson gave {{a series}} of lectures on the {{philosophy}} {{of history at the}} Masonic Temple in Boston. This {{was the first time he}} managed a lecture series on his own, and it was the beginning of his career as a lecturer. The profits from this series of lectures were much larger <b>than</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was paid by an organization to talk, and he continued to manage his own lectures often throughout his lifetime. He eventually gave as many as 80 lectures a year, traveling across the northern United States as far as St. Louis, Des Moines, Minneapolis, and California.|$|E
25|$|On May 30, 1894, he {{was sentenced}} to 18 years of prison at a trial in Palermo against the leaders of the Fasci. After two years, he was {{released}} in March 1896 {{as the result of a}} pardon recognizing the excessive brutality of the repression. After his release, De Felice, and other Fasci leaders Nicola Barbato and Rosario Garibaldi Bosco were met by a large crowd of supporters in Rome, who released the horses from their carriage and dragged them to the hotel, cheering for socialism and denouncing Crispi. De Felice said that after he had left the prison he was still more a revolutionary <b>than</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> entered it.|$|E

25|$|One {{night while}} working the late shift, he killed a man. Authorities briefly arrested him, but Quantrill {{claimed that he}} had acted in self-defense. Since there were no eyewitnesses and the victim was a {{stranger}} who knew no one in town, William was set free. Nevertheless, the police strongly urged him to leave Mendota. Quantrill continued {{his career as a}} teacher, moving to Fort Wayne, Indiana in February 1856. The district was impressed with Quantrill's teaching abilities, but unfortunately the wages remained meager. Quantrill journeyed back home to Canal Dover that fall, with no more money in his pockets <b>than</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> had left.|$|E
25|$|After a {{successful}} {{fight with the}} federal Liberal government to re-negotiate the fiscal arrangement of the Atlantic Accord and {{a significant increase in}} oil prices, offshore oil revenues led to record surpluses for the provincial government. The new surpluses led to the Williams government reducing income taxes and significantly increasing government spending. The increases in spending was largely focussed on upgrading the province's infrastructure and social programs. He also gave public service employees increases in pay of over 20 percent, to make up for years that their pay was frozen. By the time he left office in 2010, government spending had skyrocketed, his provincial cabinet had increased to 18 ministers {{and the size of the}} public service was significantly larger <b>than</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> took office. While government spending was up substantially his government still managed to reduce the province's net debt by roughly $4 billion and Williams was considered one of the most fiscally responsible premier's in Canada.|$|E
25|$|Although not all Afrikander Bond leaders liked Kruger, {{they were}} ready to support him whether or not he granted reforms and, by the same result, {{contrived}} to make Milner's position untenable. His difficulties were increased when, at the general election in Cape Colony, the Bond obtained a majority. In October 1898, acting strictly in a constitutional manner, Milner called upon William Philip Schreiner to form a ministry, though aware that such a ministry would be opposed to any direct intervention of Great Britain in the Transvaal. Convinced that the existing state of affairs, if continued, would end in the loss of South Africa by Britain, Milner visited England in November 1898. He returned to Cape Colony in February 1899, fully assured of Joseph Chamberlain's support, though the government still clung to the hope that the moderate section of the Cape and Orange Free State Dutch would induce Kruger to give the vote to the Uitlanders. He found the situation more critical <b>than</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> had left, ten weeks previously. Johannesburg was in a ferment, while William Francis Butler, who acted as high commissioner in Milner's absence, had allowed the inference that he did not support Uitlander grievances.|$|E

25|$|As every individual, therefore, {{endeavours}} {{as much as}} he {{can both}} to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry, and so to direct that industry that its produce may be of the greatest value; every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it. By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually <b>than</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> really intends to promote it. I have never known much good done by those who affected to trade for the public good. It is an affectation, indeed, not very common among merchants, and very few words need be employed in dissuading them from it.|$|E

Ultimately, Keaton decided to perform Batman's voice at a lower register <b>than</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was portraying Bruce Wayne, which became a hallmark of the film version of the character, with Christian Bale later using the same technique.|$|E

While Hispanics could work for $2 per day, whites could get jobs working in petroleum fields that earned $18 per day. In his town, signs read [...] "No Mexicans, whites only", and only one restaurant would serve Hispanics. The American GI Forum was started to ensure the rights of Hispanic World War II veterans.|$|E
