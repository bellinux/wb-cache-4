Although resistance has a negative effect on enemy fitness, tolerance, by this definition, does not necessarily; the relative importance of resistance and tolerance within a population might therefore affect enemy-victim coevolution. Resistance and tolerance have been distinguished in studies of plant defence, whereas most studies of antagonistic interactions in animals have focused on resistance, neglecting tolerance. We suggest that tolerance is also an important means of defence in animal victim-enemy interactions such as brood parasitism, mating interactions and territoriality.

Although many efforts have resulted in breeding rice cultivars that are relatively tolerant to their local environments, climate changes and population increase are expected to soon call for new, fast generation of stress tolerant rice germplasm, and current within-species rice diversity might not be enough to overcome such needs. The Oryza genus contains other 23 wild species, with only Oryza glaberrima being also domesticated. Rice domestication was performed with a narrow genetic diversity, and the other Oryza species are a virtually untapped genetic resource for rice stress tolerance improvement. Here we review the origin of domesticated Oryza sativa from wild progenitors, the ecological and genomic diversity of the Oryza genus, and the stress <b>tolerance</b> <b>variation</b> observed for wild Oryza species, including the genetic basis underlying the tolerance mechanisms found.

40|$|International audienceStress {{tolerance}} generally declines {{with age}} {{as a result}} of functional senescence. Age-dependent alteration of stress tolerance can also occur in early adult life. In Drosophila melanogaster, evidence of such a decline in young adults has only been reported for thermotolerance. It is not known whether early adult life entails a general stress tolerance reduction and whether the response is peculiar to thermal traits. The present work was designed to investigate whether newly eclosed D melanogaster adults present a high tolerance to a range of biotic and abiotic insults. We found that tolerance to most of the abiotic stressors tested (desiccation, paraquat, hydrogen peroxide, deltamethrin, and malathion) was high in newly eclosed adults before dramatically declining over the next days of adult life. No clear age-related pattern was found for resistance to biotic stress (septic or fungal infection) and starvation. These results suggest that newly eclosed adults present a culminating level of tolerance to extrinsic stress which is likely unrelated to immune process.

40|$|Since {{heat stress}} affects most organisms it is {{important}} that we understand how adaptation occurs to increasingly warm environment, especially the underlying changes in physiology, biochemistry and genetics. Few studies have shown links between physiological mechanisms and heat tolerance phenotypes in an adaptive context. Therefore the overall aim of this thesis was to use the model organism Drosophila melanogaster to elucidate the role of two heat-tolerance candidate genes hsr-omega and hsp 90 in thermal adaptation, and to look at this in a physiological context which included examining rates of protein synthesis, a postulated underlying process. Using geographically diverse populations of D. melanogaster from eastern Australia I found that heat tolerance is a plastic trait that depends on rearing temperature and heat-stimulus conditions, and that the adaptive latitudinal clines in heat tolerance depend on these rearing conditions. Protein synthesis rate showed latitudinal clines that also depend on both the temperature at which flies are reared (18 or 25 °C) and heat-stress conditions (either unstressed (basal) or following a 37 °C heat stimulus), and these clines ran in parallel to clines in heat knockdown tolerance, although no evidence that the clines are connected was obtained. Consistent negative correlations between variation in protein synthesis rate and heat knockdown tolerance in a derived North/South hybrid population confirmed the importance of protein synthesis rate as a factor underlying heat <b>tolerance</b> <b>variation</b> within populations. However the latitudinal cline in protein synthesis did not help explain the latitudinal heat <b>tolerance</b> <b>variation</b> as this would require a positive association between the two variables. A gene thought to help control rates of general protein synthesis following heat stimulus, hsr-omega, was investigated for changes in expression across latitude. Clines in basal and heat-stimulated omega-n transcript level suggest that there is adaptive genetic differentiation in hsr-omega expression between populations from different climatic regions. I show for the first time evidence for a link between expression of another heat shock gene, hsp 90, and adult heat knockdown tolerance. Tissue levels of hsp 90 transcript and protein were negatively associated with tolerance in several independent data sets. Further, this negative association extended to a set of populations from different thermal niches and revealed a positive linear latitudinal cline for both basal hsp 90 transcript and protein level. These data suggest that heritable variation in hsp 90 expression contributes to traits that facilitate adaptation to different climatic regions, including the clinal variation in thermal tolerance. I also discuss a plausible causal role for hsp 90 as a negative regulator of the cellular heat shock response that predicts the above negative hsp 90 -tolerance association, particularly the interaction between Hsp 90 protein and Heat shock factor. Overall these data make a significant contribution to understanding the process of adaption to divergent thermal habitats and to the cellular processes and genes that facilitate thermal adaptation...|$|E
40|$|Plant defense {{strategies}} against pathogen attack can {{be divided}} into either resistance or <b>tolerance.</b> <b>Variation</b> in tolerance is expressed as differences in the relationship between host fitness (or yield) and the degree of infection. Plant tolerance of pathogen attack remains poorly understood both in terms of its specific mechanisms {{and in terms of the}} evolutionary processes by which it has arisen. Theoretical models predict that it is the result of coevolution between host and pathogen, suggesting greater tolerance in interactions with native as opposed to introduced pathogens. Therefore, we quantified and compared the degree of tolerance expressed in the interaction of Senecio vulgaris with the rust fungus Coleosporium tussilginis, which is native to the UK, and the introduced rust fungus Puccinia lagenophorae. We used the reaction norm approach to quantify tolerance and its components. The S. vulgaris-C. tussilaginis interaction expressed a significantly greater degree of tolerance, as reductions in host growth and fitness per unit infection were significantly less than with P. lagenophorae. The key mechanism for this greater tolerance to C. tussilaginis was a significantly smaller reduction in photosynthesis per unit infection than with P. lagenophorae, at both leaf and whole plant scales. There was no significant difference in the relationship between whole plant photosynthesis and host reproduction. We discuss these responses in the context of coevolution for tolerance in host-pathogen interactions...|$|E

We have analyzed the intraspecific freezing <b>tolerance</b> <b>variation</b> existent between two geographically distant accessions of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), Cape Verde Islands (Cvi) and Landsberg erecta (Ler). They differed in their freezing tolerance before and after cold acclimation, as well as in the cold acclimation response in relation to photoperiod conditions. Using a quantitative genetic approach, we found that freezing tolerance differences after cold acclimation were determined by seven quantitative trait loci (QTL), named FREEZING TOLERANCE QTL 1 (FTQ 1) to FTQ 7. FTQ 4 was the QTL with the largest effect detected in two photoperiod conditions, while five other FTQ loci behaved as photoperiod dependent. FTQ 4 colocated with the tandem repeated genes C-REPEAT BINDING FACTOR 1 (CBF 1), CBF 2, and CBF 3, which encode transcriptional activators involved in the cold acclimation response. The low freezing tolerance of FTQ 4 -Cvi alleles was associated with a deletion of the promoter region of Cvi CBF 2, and with low RNA expression of CBF 2 and of several CBF target genes. Genetic complementation of FTQ 4 -Cvi plants with a CBF 2 -Ler transgene suggests that such CBF 2 allelic variation is the cause of CBF 2 misexpression and the molecular basis of FTQ 4.

This innovation is a computational design algorithm that, for the first time, optimizes the efficiency and output power of a TWT while {{taking into account the}} effects of dimensional <b>tolerance</b> <b>variations.</b> Because they are primary power consumers and power generation is very expensive in space, much effort has been exerted over the last 30 years to increase the power efficiency of TWTs. However, at frequencies higher than about 60 GHz, efficiencies of TWTs are still quite low. A major reason is that at higher frequencies, dimensional <b>tolerance</b> <b>variations</b> from conventional micromachining techniques become relatively large with respect to the circuit dimensions. When this is the case, conventional design- optimization procedures, which ignore dimensional variations, provide inaccurate designs for which the actual amplifier performance substantially under-performs that of the design.

This design algorithm can help extend the use of TWTs into the terahertz frequency regime of 300 - 3000 GHz. Currently, these frequencies are under-utilized {{because of the lack of}} efficient amplifiers, thus this regime is known as the "terahertz gap.

Thereafter, we tested the functional importance of these two genes by transformation experiments. Overexpression of the putative negative regulator led to reduced drought tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana, whereas overexpression of the putative positive regulator led to improved drought tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana and transgenic poplars.

Uncoupling resistance and tolerance is a challenge, and {{there is a need to}} be able to separate them using specific trait recording or statistical methods. We present three statistical methods that can be used to investigate genetics of tolerance. Firstly, using random regressions, tolerance can be analyzed as a reaction norm slope in which host performance (y-axis) is regressed against an increasing pathogen burden (x-axis). Genetic variance in tolerance slopes is the genetic variance for <b>tolerance.</b> <b>Variation</b> in tolerance can induce genotype re-ranking and changes in genetic and phenotypic variation in host performance along the pathogen burden trajectory, contributing to environment-dependent genetic responses to selection. Such genotype-by-environment interactions can be quantified by combining random regressions and covariance functions. To apply random regressions, pathogen burden of individuals needs to be recorded. Secondly, when pathogen burden is not recorded, the cure model for time-until-death data allows separating two traits, susceptibility and endurance. Susceptibility is whether or not an individual was susceptible to an infection, whereas endurance denotes how long time it took until the infection killed a susceptible animal (influenced by tolerance). Thirdly, the normal mixture model can be used to classify continuously distributed host performance, such as growth rate, into different sub-classes (e. g., non-infected, infected), which allows estimation of host performance reduction specific to infected individuals. Moreover, genetics of host performance can be analysed separately in healthy and affected animals, even in the absence of pathogen burden and survival data. These methods provide novel tools to increase our understanding on the impact of parasites, pathogens and production diseases on host traits...|$|E

Types D and N were previously reported to have restricted distributions along California (western USA) and Delaware and Connecticut (eastern USA), respectively, whereas Type S is considered widespread in tropical, subtropical and temperate regions due to anthropogenic transport. Here, Bayesian species delimitation analysis of a data set composed of two mitochondrial (COI and large ribosomal RNA subunit [16 S]) and two nuclear genes (dynein light chain roadblock type- 2 protein [DYN] and voltage-dependent anion-selective channel protein [VDAC]) demonstrated that Types S, D and N correspond to three biological species. This finding was significantly supported, in spite of the combinations of priors applied for ancestral population size and root age. Furthermore, COI sequences were used to assess the introduction patterns of the cosmopolitan Type S species. Two COI haplotypes of Type S (S 1 a and S 1 d) were found occurring at a global scale. Mantel tests showed correlation between these haplotypes and local sea surface temperature tolerance. Accordingly, the distributions of Type S haplotypes may reflect intraspecific temperature <b>tolerance</b> <b>variation,</b> in addition to the role of introduction vectors.
