25|$|The Enlightenment and {{the colonial}} era both {{changed the nature of}} European {{philosophy}} and exported it worldwide. Devotion and subservience to God were largely replaced by notions of inalienable natural rights and <b>the</b> <b>potentialities</b> <b>of</b> reason, and universal ideals of love and compassion gave way to civic notions of freedom, equality, and citizenship. The meaning of life changed as well, focusing less on humankind's relationship to God and more on the relationship between individuals and their society. This era is filled with theories that equate meaningful existence with the social order.|$|E
500|$|Garcia {{returned}} to the Indians in 1949. A newspaper article predicted that Garcia might fill big needs in the Cleveland bullpen. Garcia saw action as a starter and as a relief pitcher that year, starting 20 of his 41 regular season appearances. He finished his rookie season with a 14–5 record, a league-leading 2.36 ERA, 94 strikeouts and five shutouts. Fellow pitcher Bob Feller said, [...] "From the beginning, Mike was a sneaky quick pitcher. For a big guy, he was certainly mobile." [...] One year removed from his rookie season, expectations from Indians General Manager Hank Greenberg and pitching coach Mel Harder were for Garcia to become a key piece of the Indians' rotation. [...] "Garcia has all <b>the</b> <b>potentialities</b> <b>of</b> a really great pitcher. I see no reason he should not reach greatness this season", Greenberg said. Garcia finished the 1950 season 11–11.|$|E
500|$|As Interior Secretary, Lane was {{responsible}} for the territories, and advocated the development of the Alaska Territory. While private railroads had been established there, they were not successful, and he pushed for a government-built railroad, which he believed would lead to large-scale population movement into Alaska. In 1914, Congress passed a bill authorizing construction of the Alaska Railroad, which passed the Senate following a two-day speech in support by Walsh. [...] Lane was the first Interior Secretary to appoint an Alaska resident, John Franklin Alexander Strong, as territorial governor. [...] Secretary Lane's vision for the territory was, [...] "Alaska should not, in my judgment, be regarded as a mere storehouse of materials on which the people of the States may draw. [...] She has <b>the</b> <b>potentialities</b> <b>of</b> a State. And whatever policies may be adopted should look toward an Alaska of homes, of industries, and of an extended commerce." ...|$|E

2500|$|It {{is worth}} noting that Lawrence was very {{interested}} in the sense of touch and that his focus on physical intimacy has its roots in a desire to restore an emphasis on the body, and re-balance it with what he perceived to be Western civilisation's over-emphasis on the mind; writing in a 1929 essay [...] "Men Must Work and Women As Well", he stated,"Now we see the trend of our civilization, in terms of human feeling and human relation. It is, and there is no denying it, towards a greater and greater abstraction from the physical, towards a further and further physical separateness between men and women, and between individual and individual… It only remains for some men and women, individuals, to try to get back their bodies and preserve the flow of warmth, affection and physical unison."

2500|$|The {{political}} change {{did not immediately}} change social circumstances. With the economic recession, women were the most vulnerable sector of the workforce. Some women who held jobs prior to the war were obliged to forfeit them to returning soldiers, and others were excessed. With limited franchise, the UK National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies (NUWSS) pivoted into a new organization, the National Union of Societies for Equal Citizenship (NUSEC), which still advocated for equality in franchise, but extended its scope to examine equality in social and economic areas. Legislative reform was sought for discriminatory laws (e.g., family law and prostitution) and over the differences between equality and equity, the accommodations that would allow women to overcome barriers to fulfillment (known in later years as the [...] "equality vs. difference conundrum"). Eleanor Rathbone, who became a British Member of Parliament in 1929, succeeded Millicent Garrett as president of NUSEC in 1919. She expressed the critical need for consideration of difference in gender relationships as [...] "what women need to fulfill <b>the</b> <b>potentialities</b> <b>of</b> their own natures". The 1924 Labour government's social reforms created a formal split, as a splinter group of strict egalitarians formed the Open Door Council in May 1926. This eventually became an international movement, and continued until 1965. Other important social legislation of this period included the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act 1919 (which opened professions to women), and the Matrimonial Causes Act 1923. In 1932, NUSEC separated advocacy from education, and continued the former activities as the National Council for Equal Citizenship and the latter as the Townswomen's Guild. The council continued {{until the end of}} the Second World War.|$|E

40|$|Every year, Australian oceans {{experience}} {{the genesis of}} many tropical cyclones (TCs). About 40 percent of these make landfall. Because of the enormous difference in impacts between landfalling and non-landfalling TCs on coastal communities, the benefits would be enormous {{if it were possible}} to capture early <b>the</b> <b>potentiality</b> <b>of</b> landfall of a TC that has undergone genesis. Published literature identifies many factors such as location, warm sea surface temperature above 26 degrees C, conditional instability and high relative humidity in the middle troposphere and low vertical wind shear for the genesis of cyclones. Some of these factors could hold information about <b>the</b> <b>potentiality</b> <b>of</b> landfall while a TC is forming. An investigation into these factors actually revealed that a Landfall Potential Index (LPI) can be developed that can capture <b>the</b> <b>potentiality</b> <b>of</b> making a landfall. An attractive feature of this index is that it uses values at the time and location of genesis, providing a long and useful lead time. Furthermore, it is made into a dimensionless number, which makes for easy comprehension and interpretation...|$|R
