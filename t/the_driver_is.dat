5|$|FMCSA rules {{require that}} a log book (or ELD) must record for each change of duty status (e.g., {{the place of}} {{reporting}} for work, or starting to drive), {{the name of the}} city, town or village, with state abbreviation. If a change of duty status occurs at a location other than a city, the highway number and nearest milepost or the nearest two intersecting roadways followed by the name of the nearest city must be recorded. In addition to the time grid, a log book must record the date, total miles driven for the day, truck and trailer number, name of carrier, bill of lading number, and the driver's signature. <b>The</b> <b>driver</b> <b>is</b> required to retain a copy of each log page for the previous seven consecutive days which must be in his/her possession and available for inspection while on-duty.|$|E
5|$|Like {{all other}} US states, New Jersey sets a 0.08 percent {{weight by volume}} blood alcohol content (BAC) as the {{threshold}} for intoxication when operating a motor vehicle (e.g. automobile, boat). It is possible {{to be charged with}} driving under the influence (DUI) with a BAC level below 0.08%, but there is a presumption in that situation that <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>is</b> not intoxicated. State law prohibits those under 21 from driving if their BAC is 0.01% or more, prohibits the operation of a commercial vehicle with a BAC of 0.04% or more, and mandates that drivers submit a breath sample if requested by a police officer. To be convicted of DUI in New Jersey, a person must be operating or attempting to operate a motorized vehicle; thus activities such as sleeping in a car while intoxicated or bicycling while drunk are not illegal.|$|E
50|$|During <b>the</b> operation, <b>drivers</b> would <b>be</b> {{stopped and}} briefly {{questioned}} while in their vehicles. If an officer suspected <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>was</b> intoxicated, <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> would <b>be</b> sent {{off for a}} field sobriety test.|$|R
40|$|Visual {{observations}} {{were made on}} restraint use in occupants of 5050 automobiles containing at least one passenger less than 10 years of age, and short interviews <b>were</b> conducted with <b>the</b> <b>drivers.</b> Ninety three per cent of passengers less than 10 years old were not restrained. Eighty nine per cent of passengers 10 or older and 78 % of <b>the</b> <b>drivers</b> <b>were</b> not restrained. Sixteen per cent of child motor vehicle restraint devices observed were not used, and 73 % of those in use were not used correctly. Use of such devices declined sharply after age one. Although child passengers {{were more likely to}} <b>be</b> restrained if <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>was</b> restrained, more than 75 % of the children were not restrained when <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>was,</b> even if <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> child's parent...|$|R

5|$|The REVA NXR {{exhibited}} in the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show and the Nissan Leaf SV trim both have roof-mounted solar panels. These solar panels are designed to trickle charge the batteries when the car is moving or parked. Another proposed technology is REVive, by Reva. When the REVA NXR's batteries are running low or are fully depleted, <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>is</b> able to send an SMS to REVive and unlock a hidden reserve in the battery pack. Reva has not provided details on how the system will work. The Fisker Karma uses solar panel in the roof to recharge the 12-volt lead-acid accessory battery. The Nissan Leaf SL trim also has a small solar panel {{at the rear of}} the roof/spoiler that can trickle charge the auxiliary 12-volt lead-acid battery.|$|E
5|$|The job goes awry {{when the}} {{pawnshop}} owner shoots and kills Standard while <b>the</b> <b>Driver</b> <b>is</b> {{waiting for him}} with Cook's accomplice, Blanche. Pursued by a mysterious adversary, the Driver and Blanche escape after an intense car chase. The Driver hides with Blanche in a motel where he learns from a news report that Standard, according to the pawnshop owner, performed the robbery by himself and that no money had been stolen. When she lies about being oblivious to the second car when the Driver interrogates her, he slaps Blanche and threatens to hurt her {{to get her to}} talk. Blanche then admits that the bag contains a million dollars and that she and Cook planned to re-steal the money using the car that chased them. Two of Cook's men ambush them in the motel room, and kill Blanche before the Driver manages to kill them both.|$|E

50|$|On 3 September 2007, a National Express coach from Birmingham to Luton {{airport and}} Stansted airport (making an {{unscheduled}} stop) {{failed to make}} a turn on the approach road and overturned.

25|$|The {{first of}} the final tests {{consists}} of a multiple choice test regarding different scenarios that the driver will be likely to meet on the public roads. <b>The</b> <b>driver</b> <b>is</b> allowed to make a maximum of five mistakes on this test.|$|E
25|$|In the United Kingdom and Canada, notably on extra-urban roads, a solid {{white or}} yellow line closer to <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>is</b> used to {{indicate}} that no overtaking is allowed in that lane. A double white or yellow line means that neither side may overtake.|$|E
25|$|Tractor/Motorized {{equipment}} (T/M) permit can {{be obtained}} when <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>is</b> 16 years old. T/M allows driving a moped. Anyone with B licence can drive tractors and Motorized equipment. Motorized equipment would be things like combine harvesters, steam rollers, loaders, excavators and other vehicles driving maximum 30km/h.|$|E

25|$|A moped licence {{can also}} be {{acquired}} when <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>is</b> 15 years old and requires the driver to pay a fee of usually 100 DKR for an amount of classroom education. <b>The</b> <b>driver</b> <b>is</b> also required {{to take part in}} a theoretical test as well as driving on a track and ultimately on public roads. It's considered very hard to fail the moped driving test. A valid moped driving licence grants the driver permission to drive mopeds limited to 30 km/h, but it does not grant the driver permission to drive T/M vehicles. Anyone above the age of 18 can drive a moped limited to 30 km/h with, or without a licence. Anyone with a B licence are allowed to drive mopeds that are limited to 45 km/h.|$|E
25|$|If {{a driver}} either fails the air brake {{component}} of the general knowledge test or performs the skills test in a vehicle not equipped with air brakes, <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>is</b> issued an air brake restriction, restricting the driver from operating a CMV equipped with air brakes.|$|E
25|$|British {{police are}} {{comfortable}} with the TPAC, as fleeing drivers are usually considered to be unarmed, and driving beside or {{in front of them}} is not a hazard.

25|$|The {{second test}} {{consists}} of the driver driving on a route set by a government supervisor, who also supervises the driver himself. This test is considered especially difficult in the larger cities and the failure statistics show similar results. This test demands perfection as <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>is</b> not allowed to make any mistakes at all.|$|E
25|$|The {{hollow shaft}} {{mechanism}} lets the DCT operate sequentially, the car anticipating the next gear that <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>is</b> likely to need next under acceleration or braking, or jump immediately {{to any of}} its seven forward gears (and reverse). This is particularly useful under kickdown or heavy braking, allowing the driver to remain {{in control of the}} vehicle at all times.|$|E
