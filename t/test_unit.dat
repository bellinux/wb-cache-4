5|$|By February 1945 the {{seventeen}} aircraft of {{the second}} increment were themselves in need of upgrades, particularly those of the 216th Army Air Force Base Unit. Four of the planes assigned to the 393d Bombardment Squadron (now part of the 509th Composite Group) were transferred to the 216th to meet an increase in its testing tempo. Rather than attempt to modify the existing aircraft a few at a time, {{a decision was made}} to start a new production series. The first five of this third increment, known as Project 98228-S, also went to the <b>test</b> <b>unit.</b> The order totaled an additional 28 aircraft, with delivery of 15 designated combat models for the 393d beginning in April. The final eight were not delivered until after the two atomic bomb missions in August. Two were given to the 216th while the remaining six were assigned to the 509th at Wendover as replacements for any bombers lost while operating from Tinian. Ironically, no bombers were lost during operations from Tinian, but five of these six were lost in crashes over the next few years.|$|E

40|$|The {{intensive}} {{production of}} swine in Iowa (28. 4 % of the U. S. A production) inevitably results in high amounts of piggery waste including animal carcasses. Composting is an environmentally sound and relatively inexpensive method to dispose swine mortalities {{especially when the}} carcasses are diseased. Measurement of VOC emissions is an alternative to test progress and completion of the process. In this study, diseased swine mortalities are composted in summer conditions of Central Iowa. Corn silage, oat straw and corn stalks are used as envelope materials. Once a week, air samples are collected {{from the center of}} <b>test</b> <b>units</b> and sampled with 85 µm Carboxen/ polydimethylsiloxane (CAR/PDMS) solid phase microextraction (SPME) fiber. Samples were analyzed using gas chromatography (GC) - mass spectrometry (MS). The objective of the study is to investigate the potential usage of VOCs as indicators of swine mortality degradation. It is found that nitrogen and sulfur containing compounds can be used as indicators of the composting process. Sulfur-containing compounds are detected from all <b>test</b> <b>units.</b> Nitrogen-containing compounds are detected from only corn silage <b>test</b> <b>units.</b> It is concluded that carcass degradation is incomplete in all of the <b>test</b> <b>units.</b> Carcass degradation in corn stalks and oat straw <b>test</b> <b>units</b> is better than corn silage <b>test</b> <b>units.</b> These results are supported with respiration rate results.
