500|$|Described by her biographer Wes Gehring as [...] "a free-spirited tomboy", {{the young}} Lombard was passionately {{involved}} {{in sports and}} enjoyed watching movies. At Virgil Junior High School, she participated in tennis, volleyball, and swimming, and won trophies for her achievements in athletics. At the age of 12, this hobby unexpectedly landed Lombard her first screen role. While playing baseball with friends, she {{caught the attention of}} the film director Allan Dwan, who later recalled seeing [...] "a cute-looking little tomboy... out there knocking <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other kids, playing better baseball than they were. And I needed someone of her type for this picture." [...] With the encouragement of her mother, Lombard happily took a small role in the melodrama A Perfect Crime (1921). She was on set for two days, playing the sister of Monte Blue. Dwan later commented, [...] "She ate it up".|$|E
500|$|... "Ice" [...] {{was also}} {{considered}} one of the best episodes of the first season by the production crew. According to Carter, Morgan and Wong [...] "just outdid themselves on this show, as did director David Nutter, who really works so hard for us. I think they wrote a great script and he did a great job directing it, and we had a great supporting cast". Nutter said: [...] "The real great thing about 'Ice' is {{that we were able to}} convey a strong sense of paranoia. It was also a great ensemble piece. We're dealing with the most basic emotions of each character, ranging from their anger to their ignorance and fear. It established the emotional ties these two characters have with each other, which is very important. Scaring <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> audience was definitely the key to the episode". Anderson said that [...] "it was very intense. There was a lot of fear and paranoia going on. We had some great actors to work with".|$|E
500|$|The {{love story}} {{involving}} Kurt and Blaine {{was met with}} critical acclaim, especially {{the events in the}} [...] "Original Song" [...] episode where the characters first kissed. Katie Morgan of Billboard stated, [...] "It sure took them long enough, but we're so glad to finally see Kurt happy." [...] The Boston Herald Mark Perigard wrote, [...] "It was utterly, sweetly romantic, and Criss sold <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> moment. It’s long overdue and it will silence the growing legion of critics out there who were unhappy with the pace of this story and why Kurt always seemed to be stuck in pure misery." [...] Kevin Fallon of The Atlantic thought the kiss was [...] "sweet" [...] and said that he was pleased that it attracted no controversy whatsoever. Semigran praised the interaction between Kurt and Blaine, and characterized the kiss scene as a [...] "sweet, real and, shockingly, un-hyped moment". She went on to commend the acting in the scene, and wrote that both actors [...] "handled it with dignity and honesty".|$|E

500|$|The {{official}} record of Omaha reports that [...] "...the tanks were leading a hard life...". According to {{the commander of the}} 2nd battalion 116th RCT the tanks [...] "...saved the day. They shot <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Germans, and got the hell shot out of them." [...] As the morning progressed the beach defenses were gradually being reduced, often by tanks. Scattered {{along the length of the}} beach, trapped between the sea and the impassable shingle embankment and with no operating radios amongst the commanders, tanks had to be controlled individually. This was perilous work. The commanding officer of the 111th Field Artillery, who had landed ahead of his unit, was killed as he tried to direct the fire of one tank. The command group of the 741st tank battalion lost three out their group of five in their efforts. Additionally, the commander of the 743rd tank battalion became a casualty as he approached one of his tanks with orders. When naval gunfire was brought to bear against the strong-points defending the E-3 draw, a decision was made to try to force this exit with tanks. Colonel Taylor ordered all available tanks into action against this point at 11:00. Only three were able to reach the rallying point, and two were knocked out as they attempted to go up the draw, forcing the remaining tank to back off.|$|E
500|$|Blaine and Kurt's {{relationship}} has been generally well received. They were named Favorite TV Couple at the 2010 AfterElton.com Visibility Awards, and have been lauded for [...] "leading the way" [...] in representing gay teenagers on television by Entertainment Weekly. Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post referred to them as [...] "one of the most beloved TV couples of the millennium". When they [...] "finally solidified what their relationship actually is" [...] in the episode [...] "Silly Love Songs", IGN Robert Canning noted that his opinion of Blaine improved. He commented: [...] "I love that the [...] blew up in Blaine's face. The character has always come off to me as annoyingly arrogant, but [...] "Silly Love Songs" [...] humanized the guy. Guess I may have to like him now." [...] Their first kiss, in the episode [...] "Original Song", was met with critical acclaim. Mark Perigard of The Boston Herald wrote, [...] "It was utterly, sweetly romantic, and Criss sold <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> moment. It's long overdue and it will silence the growing legion of critics out there who were unhappy with the pace of this story." [...] Entertainment Weekly Mandi Bierly {{was so impressed with}} the scene that she was initially concerned it may be a dream sequence, [...] "because we don't get romantic, unapologetic first kisses like that between young gay characters on network TV." [...] She wrote, [...] "Relationships aren't easy. They’ll make mistakes. But if they stay true to themselves, and continue to be as open and honest with each other, we're in for something special." [...] Kevin Fallon of The Atlantic thought the kiss was [...] "sweet", and stated that he was pleased that it attracted no controversy whatsoever. Aly Semigran of MTV praised the interaction between Blaine and Kurt. She called the kiss scene a [...] "sweet, real and, shockingly, un-hyped moment", and praised Criss and Colfer for [...] "handl it with dignity and honesty".|$|E
500|$|The Kurt–Blaine storyline was {{met with}} general acclaim from critics. In her review for the episode, Katie Morgan of Billboard reacted {{positively}} to the interaction between Kurt and Blaine. She wrote, [...] "It sure took them long enough, but we're so glad to finally see Kurt happy." [...] In his review, Mark Perigard opined, [...] "It was utterly, sweetly romantic, and Criss sold <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> moment. It’s long overdue and it will silence the growing legion of critics out there who were unhappy with the pace of this story and why Kurt {{always seemed to be}} stuck in pure misery." [...] Robert Canning was more critical on the storyline. He highly criticized Darren Criss' performance as Blaine. In a detailed review regarding the storyline, Canning wrote, [...] "Kurt finally got the first kiss he deserved. Too bad it came from the wooden, glass-eyed Blaine. Chris Colfer has been in the running for performance awards for good reason. Darren Criss will not be. Colfer and his character deserve better than the cardboard, unemotional declaration of love that Criss delivered. Yay for Kurt and his first boyfriend, but that was a bland work up to their kiss." [...] Sandra Gonzalez called the whole development [...] "simply perfect". Kevin Fallon of The Atlantic thought the kiss was [...] "sweet", and stated that he was pleased that it attracted no controversy whatsoever. James Poniewozik reacted positively to the storyline. In his review, Poniewozik wrote, [...] "As for the at-long-last kiss, it's to Glees credit that it made me think, ‘Finally, Blaine and Kurt are locking lips already!’ before it made me think, ‘Look, an honest-to-God gay kiss, between two men, on my primetime TV show!’" [...] Aly Semigran of MTV praised the interaction between Kurt and Blaine, saying that the kiss scene was a [...] "sweet, real and, shockingly, un-hyped moment". Semigran went on to praise the acting in the scene, saying that both actors [...] "handled it with dignity and honesty". Brett Berk deemed the interaction to be [...] "appropriately fervid".|$|E

Reportedly, Lenin also urged the Transnistrian delegate to personally to sabotage the war effort on the Caucasus Front, fraternize with the Ottomans and demand [...] "peace without annexations or indemnities".

2500|$|Alan Sepinwall of the Star-Ledger gave a {{positive}} {{review of the}} episode: [...] "For an episode that was so Izzie-centric, 'What a Difference a Day Makes' worked surprisingly well for me." [...] Even though he pointed out Chandra Wilson as [...] "the best actor in the ensemble, Sepinwall liked Justin Chambers' acting, [...] "because of how far Karev has come, Chambers' big moments always feel more surprising, and powerful." [...] He also appreciated [...] "all the action in the pit." [...] Entertainment Weekly listed Alex's speech to Izzie in their [...] "25 Great 'I Love You's". The Los Angeles Times writer Shawna Malcolm wasn't shocked that Izzie and Alex married instead of Meredith and Derek as she had already elaborated that hypothesis weeks prior to the episode's broadcast. She underlined Heigl and Chambers' performances, saying: [...] "it was next to impossible not to get {{swept up in the}} moment, what with Katherine Heigl and Justin Chambers getting all teary and acting <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thing." ...|$|E
2500|$|The boat's {{progress}} {{down the}} side of the ship was slow and difficult. The pulleys were covered in fresh paint and the lowering ropes were stiff, causing them to stick repeatedly as the boat was lowered in jerks towards the water. One of those watching the boat being lowered, Dr. Washington Dodge, felt [...] "overwhelmed with doubts" [...] that he might be subjecting his wife and son to greater danger aboard the boat than if they had remained on Titanic. Ismay sought to spur those lowering the boat to greater urgency by calling out repeatedly: [...] "Lower away!" [...] This resulted in Lowe losing his temper: [...] "If you'll get <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> way, I'll be able to do something! You want me to lower away quickly? You'll have me drown the lot of them!" [...] The humiliated Ismay retreated up the deck. In the end, the boat was launched safely.|$|E

2500|$|Doctor's Advocate {{contains}} various {{staples of}} West Coast hip hop albums including explicit rhymes about gang violence, {{drug use and}} sex. The album looks into The Game's relationship with his former mentor Dr. Dre on several tracks, most notably Doctor's Advocate which also features former Aftermath Entertainment rapper Busta Rhymes. This album {{is known for its}} heavy West Coast hip hop sound, something that didn't feature much in his debut The Documentary. He worked with a number of west coast artists such as Nate Dogg, Snoop Dogg, Xzibit and Tha Dogg Pound giving more west coast oreientated lyrics. Rapreviews said [...] "He is absolutely quintessentially relentlessly and unapologetically thugging it up on this CD, but unless your name is Joe Lieberman or Tipper Gore you're gonna enjoy <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dope beats and lyrical bravado and be begging for more." [...] DJBooth praised his lyrical skills by saying [...] "to briefly touch on the lyrics, only Eminem and Lil’ Wayne are currently equals." [...] However, once again many critics panned The Game's namedropping throughout the album, but Steve Juon of Rapreviews says that [...] "some accused him of being a [...] "name dropper" [...] back then and still will today, the references seem more in keeping with his [...] "soldier of the West" [...] philosophy and less like a filler for lack of content." ...|$|E
