5|$|After the 2011 season, the Red Sox {{assigned}} Middlebrooks to the Arizona Fall League, {{where he}} hit four {{home runs in}} 13 games and {{was named to the}} Rising Stars Game. In November 2011, Middlebrooks, Che-Hsuan Lin and Drake Britton were added to the Red Sox 40-man roster to prevent <b>them</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> selected in the Rule 5 draft.|$|E
5|$|By World War I, all of {{the major}} powers were experimenting with {{aircraft}} mounted cannon; however their low rate of fire and great size and weight precluded any of <b>them</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> anything other than experimental. The most successful (or least unsuccessful) was the SPAD 12 Ca.1 with a single 37mm Puteaux mounted to fire between the cylinder banks and through the propeller boss of the aircraft's Hispano-Suiza 8C. The pilot (by necessity an ace) had to manually reload each round.|$|E
5|$|Gustavo, {{voiced by}} Alejandro Edda, {{is a minor}} {{antagonist}} in Uncharted 4: A Thief's End where he appears fighting Nate in prison. He and his gang later ambush Nate, Sam and Rafe after they examine a St. Dismas Cross which Nate found. He is however interrupted by the prison guards and beaten to death by Vargas, who was bribed by the treasure hunters in protecting <b>them</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> harmed by other inmates.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, that's only amusement. 'Tell you later. As I was saying, our Serviles {{held the}} meeting, {{and pretty soon}} we had to ground-circuit the {{platform}} to save <b>'em</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> killed. And that didn't make our people any more pacific.' ...|$|R
2500|$|Beavers are classed as a [...] "prohibited new organism" [...] under New Zealand's Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Act 1996, {{preventing}} <b>them</b> <b>from</b> legally <b>being</b> {{imported into}} the country.|$|R
25|$|The talismans were {{to protect}} <b>them</b> <b>from</b> the supernatural <b>being</b> that had entered their realm.|$|R
5|$|In 1849 the British {{seized control}} of Lahore from the Sikh Empire. During the British Raj, the mosque and the {{adjoining}} fort continued {{to be used as}} a military garrison. The 80 cells built into the walls surrounding the its vast courtyard were demolished by the British after the Freedom Fight of 1857, so as to prevent <b>them</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> used for anti-British activities. The cells were replaced by open arcades known as dalans.|$|E
5|$|Relatively strong {{reducing}} acids {{can have}} antinutrient effects by binding to dietary minerals such as iron and zinc in the gastrointestinal tract and preventing <b>them</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> absorbed. Notable examples are oxalic acid, tannins and phytic acid, which {{are high in}} plant-based diets. Calcium and iron deficiencies are not uncommon in diets in developing countries where less meat is eaten and there is high consumption of phytic acid from beans and unleavened whole grain bread.|$|E
5|$|That night, {{state troopers}} attempt to arrest Elwood for driving with a {{suspended}} license due to 116 parking tickets and 56 moving violations. After a high-speed chase through the Dixie Square Mall, the brothers escape. The next morning, {{as the police}} arrive at the flophouse where Elwood lives, a mysterious woman detonates a bomb that demolishes the building, but miraculously leaves Jake and Elwood unharmed, and saves <b>them</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> arrested.|$|E
6000|$|... "Because I {{should like}} {{to have all the}} stories that you have been in the habit of {{relating}} to our friends set down fairly in writing, by way of preserving <b>them</b> <b>from</b> ever <b>being</b> forgotten." ...|$|R
50|$|Captain Marvel {{tosses the}} Golden Scorpion and its power lenses into a volcano's molten lava to prevent <b>them</b> <b>from</b> ever <b>being</b> used for evil. Upon its destruction, Captain Marvel is {{instantly}} {{transformed back into}} Billy Batson forever, the danger from the device's curse having now been eliminated.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the fifth}} episode 'Giving up the Dead', Kate is drugged while escorting a prawn trawler back to port. Leading Seaman Robert [...] "RO" [...] Dixon manages to save <b>them</b> both <b>from</b> <b>being</b> burnt alive {{and in her}} {{confused}} state Kate asks Mike why he left her.|$|R
5|$|The series {{created a}} good deal of criticism, {{especially}} among the Cuban American community. MLB umpire Rich Garcia, who is of Cuban descent, opposed the series. MLB umpires filed a grievance against MLB attempting to block <b>them</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> sent to umpire the game in Cuba, and refused to officiate the game in Baltimore. Rafael Palmeiro, an Oriole player of Cuban descent, also opposed the series and did not make the trip to Cuba. The Cuban American National Foundation protested the series.|$|E
5|$|This {{project would}} also enable the {{platforms}} at Herne Hill to be lengthened to accommodate 12-car trains {{as the current}} northern junction, which prevents <b>them</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> extended, would be removed. However, longer trains {{could not be used}} on the Sutton/Wimbledon Loop without also rebuilding Tulse Hill and Elephant & Castle.|$|E
5|$|A former film studio {{located on}} Eastern Avenue was {{designated}} as a temporary detention centre for individuals arrested during the summit. Toronto Police Service announced that Trinity Bellwoods Park would be the designated protest area, but following opposition from local residents, police relocated the designated protest zone to {{the northern part of}} Queen's Park. Canada Post declared that it would remove post boxes in the security zone. Toronto Parking Authority removed some parking meters as well. Small trees along sidewalks around the convention centre were removed to prevent <b>them</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> used as weapons by protesters. Other removed municipal properties include 745 newspaper boxes, 200 public trash cans, 70 mailboxes, 29 bus shelters, and 5 public information boards.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, supernatural {{differences}} between the Akhud and normal vampires prevent <b>them</b> <b>from</b> triggering or <b>being</b> affected by Predator's Taint, allowing them to detect vampires and protect <b>them</b> <b>from</b> mind reading attempts.|$|R
30|$|The term NTO {{comprises}} all non-floristic organisms apart <b>from</b> <b>them</b> <b>being</b> {{targeted by}} the pest control (Marquardt and Durka 2005).|$|R
50|$|This double-pack {{variation}} {{also adds}} a strategy often called “The Aardvark,” {{in which a}} player leads the queen of spades hoping that the other player holding the queen of spades will also play it, thus cancelling <b>them</b> out <b>from</b> <b>being</b> the highest cards, and giving 26 points to the unfortunate player who takes the trick.|$|R
5|$|A second {{mandatory}} {{roll call}} {{took place in}} the evening. If a prisoner was missing, the others had to remain standing in place until he was either found or the reason for his absence discovered, regardless of the weather conditions, even if it took hours. After roll call, individual and collective punishments were meted out, depending on what had happened during the day, before the prisoners were allowed to retire to their blocks for the night and receive their bread rations and water. Curfew was two or three hours later. The prisoners slept in long rows of wooden bunks, lying in and on their clothes and shoes to prevent <b>them</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> stolen.|$|E
5|$|After the Civil War, Powell {{was made}} a baronet by Charles II. Although it is {{unrecorded}} when Bodiam Castle was dismantled (slighted), it was probably after it was bought by Powell. During and after the Civil War, many castles were slighted to prevent <b>them</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> reused. Not all were destroyed completely, {{and in some cases}} care was taken not to unnecessarily deface the structure. At Bodiam, it was deemed sufficient to dismantle the barbican, the bridges, and the buildings inside the castle. When Nathaniel Powell died in 1674 or 1675, Bodiam Castle was passed on to his son, also called Nathaniel. After the second Nathaniel, the castle came into the possession of Elizabeth Clitherow, his daughter-in-law.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 2006–07 season, he signed a 12-month {{extension}} to his contract. He spent more than two years with League Two side Rochdale, before joining Boston United in the January transfer window of 2007. Boston United were reduced to just 12 professionals on their books in the closing stages of the 2006–07 season, as the club could not afford to pay players wages. Cooksey had not been paid since February, and was spending £30 a day in fuel travelling from his Manchester home. He spent six months at Boston United and played 16 League Two games, but was unable to prevent <b>them</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> relegated from The Football League {{on the final day of}} the season.|$|E
5000|$|Within {{the system}} of what we would now call [...] "Roman {{religion}} (in the modern sense of the word), the term religio originally meant an obligation to the gods, something expected by <b>them</b> <b>from</b> human <b>beings</b> or a matter of particular care or concern as related to the gods, [...] "reverence for God or the gods, careful pondering of divine things, piety".|$|R
50|$|In Sir Walter Scott's Rob Roy (1817), {{the main}} character, Frank, upon seeing the trophies {{on the walls}} of Osbaldistone hall, imagines <b>them</b> <b>being</b> <b>from</b> the Chevy chase.|$|R
50|$|Although {{thought to}} be an old cluster, NGC 7142 {{contains}} a surprisingly high number of blue stars. This runs contrary to the standard model of cluster evolution which predicts that old clusters should be devoid of such stars since bluer stars are more massive and thus evolve and die off faster, which should prevent <b>them</b> <b>from</b> still <b>being</b> present. Such stars are said to be blue stragglers.|$|R
5|$|Dismantling {{the sets}} cost $125,000. Almost all the filmmaking {{equipment}} {{was turned over}} to the Italian government, which sold and exported it. MGM turned title to the artificial lake over to Cinecittà. MGM retained control over the costumes and the artificial lake background, which went back to the United States. The chariots were also returned to the U.S., where they were used as promotional props. The life-size galleys and pirate ships were dismantled to prevent <b>them</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> used by competing studios. Some of the horses were adopted by the men who trained them, while others were sold. Many of the camels, donkeys, and other exotic animals were sold to circuses and zoos in Europe.|$|E
5|$|During Darwin's lifetime, many {{geographical}} {{features were}} given his name. An expanse of water adjoining the Beagle Channel was named Darwin Sound by Robert FitzRoy after Darwin's prompt action, {{along with two}} or three of the men, saved <b>them</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> marooned on a nearby shore when a collapsing glacier caused a large wave that would have swept away their boats, and the nearby Mount Darwin in the Andes was named in celebration of Darwin's 25th birthday. When the Beagle was surveying Australia in 1839, Darwin's friend John Lort Stokes sighted a natural harbour which the ship's captain Wickham named Port Darwin: a nearby settlement was renamed Darwin in 1911, and it became the capital city of Australia's Northern Territory.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the war in 1918, Moltke, {{together}} with most of the High Seas Fleet, was interned at Scapa Flow pending a decision by the Allies as to the fate of the fleet. The ship met her end when she was scuttled by her crew, along with the rest of the High Seas Fleet in 1919 to prevent <b>them</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> seized by the British Royal Navy. The wreck of Moltke was raised on 10 June 1927, and scrapped at Rosyth from 1927 to 1929.|$|E
50|$|It was in 1879 when How {{was hired}} under the {{direction}} of Toronto Mayor William Holmes Howland and public school inspector James L. Hughes to helped establish a school for trouble youth that help establish her as an advocate for trouble youth and helping steer youth from trouble as well as steering <b>them</b> away <b>from</b> <b>being</b> handle in the adult court system towards a juvenile justice system.|$|R
50|$|Many Southern slaveholders “refugeed” their {{slaves to}} prevent <b>them</b> <b>from</b> {{escaping}} and/or <b>being</b> {{killed during the}} war. They force-marched slaves to holdings {{out of the way}} of the war, usually in Florida or in the territories to the west.|$|R
60|$|However, we {{left them}} {{as busy as}} we found <b>them,</b> and far <b>from</b> <b>being</b> discouraged; and if half the golden {{mountains}}, or silver mountains either, which they promise themselves should appear, they will be very well paid for their labour.|$|R
5|$|In the 1950s, the {{numbering}} grid {{for the new}} Interstate Highway System {{was established}} as intentionally opposite from the US grid insofar as the direction the route numbers increase. Interstate Highway numbers increase from west-to-east and south-to-north, to keep identically numbered routes geographically apart {{in order to keep}} <b>them</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> confused with one another, and it omits 50 and 60 which would potentially collide with US50 and US60. Both highway systems still number the routes ending in odd numbers north–south and the even-numbered highways run east–west, although the Interstate System labels its main north–south highways with numbers ending in 5, rather than 1.|$|E
5|$|It's about obsession, {{and that}} can be scary because you're not in control and you don't know where it's going to stop. It says that, at any point in {{somebody}}'s life, when they loved somebody strongly enough and that person returns, a certain touch, a certain physical gesture can turn <b>them</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> defiant and disgusted with this person to being subservient again. And it's not just a pleasurable feeling that comes back, it's the complete terror and loss of control that comes back. And I think that's ultimately a great weapon.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, 5 Platoon was in dire straits and was {{beginning}} to run low of ammunition, while a number of its M60 machine-guns were also beginning to fail because of the prolonged firing. Moving to outflank the heavily outnumbered Australians, Viet Cong were observed emerging from their bunkers. Indeed, only heavy indirect fire and effective suppressing fire from helicopter gunships prevented <b>them</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> overrun. Attempting {{to gain a better}} position to direct the fire, the B Company Forward Observer, Lieutenant Ian Mathers, moved forward to 5 Platoon, and was killed almost immediately. However, by 09:15 the remainder of B Company was able to link up with the beleaguered platoon, and after an aerial resupply of ammunition, stabilised the situation temporarily.|$|E
50|$|The over-all {{story is}} about how Jebu and Taniko are forced onto {{opposing}} sides of a civil war, and Taniko's growth as a woman whose fate moves her from one powerful man to another, eventually becoming grandmother to a shogun. In all, the story {{can be viewed as}} a tragedy, as Taniko's social importance and Jebu's loyalty to his order will always prevent <b>them</b> <b>from</b> truly <b>being</b> together.|$|R
5000|$|The exact {{state in}} which Bryland is located remains {{unspecified}} throughout the series. [...] However, at various points, these Southern states were referred to {{in such a manner}} as to eliminate <b>them</b> <b>from</b> possibly <b>being</b> the setting: Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Maryland, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and the District of Columbia. Additionally, references to [...] "counties" [...] within the state eliminate Louisiana, where counties are called [...] "parishes".|$|R
5000|$|Nutter's {{works are}} dated from 1780 to 1800. He {{executed}} plates after leading English artists of his time, {{a large proportion}} of <b>them</b> <b>being</b> <b>from</b> miniatures by Samuel Shelley. His works include: ...|$|R
