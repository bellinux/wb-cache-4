500|$|Franklin {{invented the}} {{lightning}} rod {{based on what}} he learned from experiments with his electrostatic machine. [...] Franklin and his associates observed that pointed objects were more effective than blunt objects at [...] "drawing off" [...] and [...] "throwing off" [...] sparks from static electricity. This discovery was first reported by Hopkinson. Franklin wondered if this discovery could be used in a practical invention. [...] He thought something could be made to attract the electricity out of storm clouds, but first he had to verify that lightning bolts really are giant electric sparks. He wrote Collinson and Cadwallader Colden letters about this theory. The 1752 Franklin letter to Collinson of October 19 of the kite experiment is noted by historian LeMay as a basis how it proved that lightning was electricity. Tom Tucker of the Isothermal Community College doubts the account however because of ambiguities in the account and points <b>that</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> his book Bolt of Fate: Benjamin Franklin and his Electric Kite Hoax. Others disagree with this view, arguing that Franklin would not make up such a fake story because he valued the integrity of the scientific community.|$|E
2500|$|Another strong {{theme from}} {{the album is}} peer pressure, {{particularly}} due to the band's part-Christian-part-mainstream status. The song [...] "Gravity" [...] refers to the opposing influences of Heaven and the secular world pulling the band in opposite directions, whilst [...] "Metamorphis" [...] further explores [...] "the fact <b>that</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the world, although {{everybody wants to be}} their own selves, we're pulled this way and that. Everyone you meet wants you to be something or another. The song asks God to help us to be our own true selves, as God sees us, not the way folk pressure us to be what they want us to be." [...] "Bliss" [...] deals with accusations of selling out; in the words of Stu G, [...] "we know exactly where we want to go, we want to take our music to the world and have it recognized as being as good as anything that's out there. But we're not going to compromise or back away from our integrity as Christians." ...|$|E
2500|$|The news {{asserted}} that both tour plans with Blink-182 in August 2009 and new album production [...] "will continue as previously announced," [...] and the announcement {{ended with the}} teaser for a [...] "surprise" [...] soon to come. The following day, Alternative Press broke the news that [...] "New Perspective", the first song recorded without Ross and Walker, debuted the following month on radio and {{as a part of}} the soundtrack to the film Jennifer's Body. [...] "New Perspective" [...] was recorded in spring 2009, when the band had just moved out to Topanga. Smith explained the song was inspired by the band's new experiences when there: [...] "We're living near the ocean and going surfing every day, which we've never done before. We tried to get <b>that</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the song, I guess." [...] The band reinserted the exclamation mark into its name a few days after the departure of Ross and Walker.|$|E
