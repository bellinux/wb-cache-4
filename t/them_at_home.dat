Since the qualifying rounds for the UEFA Euro 2000 tournament, Andorra have competed in qualifying for every European Championship and World Cup but have had very little success. They have only ever won five matches, four of <b>them</b> <b>at</b> <b>home.</b> They have two wins in competitive matches, 1–0 wins against Macedonia in the 2006 FIFA World Cup qualifying competition and against Hungary in the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifying competition.|$|E

She reconciles with Dave, putting his comments behind <b>them.</b> <b>At</b> <b>home,</b> Kate is angry when it becomes clear Charlie told Owen and his friend about Kate smoking crack. That night, she rebuffs Charlie's sexual advances. At school, Kate is questioned by a curious student as to why she is not gaining weight. She subsequently feigns a miscarriage and her students accuse her of killing her baby, for which she reprimands them.|$|E
5|$|In the city, {{they are}} escorted to their hotel by {{agents of the}} Bordurian secret police, who have been ordered to monitor the duo by police chief Colonel Sponsz. Aware {{that they are being}} monitored, Tintin and Haddock escape the hotel and hide in the opera house, where Bianca Castafiore is performing. When police come searching for them, they hide in Castafiore's closet; when Sponsz comes to visit Castafiore in her {{dressing}} room, Tintin is able to steal papers that will secure Calculus' release from the fortress of Bakhine from his coat pocket. After disguising themselves as officials from the Red Cross, Tintin and Haddock are able to get Calculus released from prison and with him escape from Borduria in a tank. Back at Marlinspike Hall, Calculus reveals that he forgot to take his plans for the ultrasonic device with him to Geneva, and that he had left <b>them</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> all along; he destroys the plans so that they cannot be used to create a weapon.|$|E

25|$|The {{nationwide}} {{smoking ban}} did not prohibit consumption of hookah in hookah bars. However, several cities in India have banned consumption of hookah in hookah bars. Police raids usually focus on punishing {{the owners and}} operators of hookah bars rather than the customers. Customers are usually fined while owners may face stiff fines and/or jail time. It is still legal to purchase hookahs at shops and consume <b>them</b> <b>at</b> <b>home.</b>|$|E

From the cannonballs of 1812 to the caps of Afghanistan; from the pastures converted to runways to the skies over the Balkans; from the Battle of Lake Erie to the undersea depths of the Cold War, the Elgin Military Museum connects the dots through {{the lives of those}} who served and died in far away places and those who waited for <b>them</b> <b>at</b> <b>home.</b>|$|E

City lost 2-0 in the televised replay at St James Park 11 days later, Cristiano Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney scoring the goals. The income from these two games, just under £1million, led to the club's debts being virtually cleared. However, City again failed to reach the play-offs, finishing 6th in the league.|$|E

During the summer months at Znamenka, Nicholas and Alexandra entertained guests there. Grand Duchess Alexandra was also a gifted artist. She adorned the walls of Znamenka with her paintings.

25|$|The 1970s, for the England team, can {{be largely}} split into three parts. The early 70s saw Ray Illingworth's side {{dominate}} world cricket winning the Ashes away in 1971 and then retaining <b>them</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> in 1972. The same side beat Pakistan {{at home in}} 1971 and played by far the better cricket against India that season. However, England were largely helped by the rain to sneak the Pakistan series 1–0 but the same rain saved India twice and one England collapse saw them lose to India. This was, however, one of (if not the) strongest England team ever with Boycott, Edrich, D'Oliveira, Amiss, Illingworth, Knott, Snow, Underwood amongst its core.|$|E
25|$|Various legal cases arose {{surrounding}} the dubbing of cassettes. In the UK, {{in the case}} of CBS Songs v. Amstrad (1988), the House of Lords found in favor of Amstrad that producing equipment that facilitated the dubbing of cassettes, in this case a high-speed twin cassette deck that allowed one cassette to be copied directly onto another, did not constitute the infringement of copyright. In a similar case, a shop owner who rented cassettes and sold blank tapes was not liable for copyright infringement even though it was clear that his customers likely were dubbing <b>them</b> <b>at</b> <b>home.</b> In both cases, the courts held that manufacturers and retailers could not be held accountable for the actions of consumers.|$|E

However, he was polite to the residents of Mottram, who respected him and his privacy; he used the bus to get about the area in his retirement. A bronze statue of him was erected at the traffic lights in the village.|$|E

25|$|In the interim, {{however, the}} Brigade found itself briefly opposed to its Spanish {{counterpart}} in the War of the Quadruple Alliance in 1718–20, as France was allied to the Jacobites' British Hanoverian rivals. As a result, it was Spain who assisted the Highland Jacobites in their rising {{that ended in}} the Battle of Glen Shiel in 1719. The 1716 Anglo-French alliance had effectively secured the Hanoverian succession in Ireland and Britain. Despite the alliance France continued to recognize James III as legitimate, and therefore individual Jacobites amongst the Irish regiments in France continued to hope for decades that their cause would eventually succeed. After its early years however the Brigade increasingly became a professional force made up of Irish soldiers who enlisted for reasons of family tradition or in search of opportunities denied <b>them</b> <b>at</b> <b>home,</b> rather than for directly political motives.|$|E
25|$|The spirit {{can lead}} Legios to acquire robes of yellow, {{a range of}} blues, purple, green, red, brown and other colours that are {{associated}} with various spiritual gifts and patron saints. Black is for ordained male priests (padri, pl. pate) and church mothers (madha, padri madhako, pl. mathe, pate mamon). Legio priests and church mothers wear black robes at requiem masses and at graveside services held in family compounds. At happier times, black prayer beads are worn or carried by church mothers and priests as a metonym of power and ordained status. A few non-ordained men and women said they had the black beads on their house altars because a dream had directed them to get the beads and pray with <b>them</b> <b>at</b> <b>home.</b> The dream-bestowed black beads were a source of quiet pride to these Legios.|$|E
25|$|The German invaders treated any resistance—such as sabotaging rail lines—as {{illegal and}} immoral, {{and shot the}} {{offenders}} and burned buildings in retaliation. In addition, they tended to suspect that most civilians were potential francs-tireurs (guerrillas) and, accordingly, took and sometimes killed hostages from among the civilian population. The German army executed over 6,500 French and Belgian civilians between August and November 1914, usually in near-random large-scale shootings of civilians ordered by junior German officers. The German Army destroyed 15,000–20,000 buildings—most famously the university library at Louvain—and generated a wave of refugees of over a million people. Over half the German regiments in Belgium were involved in major incidents. Thousands of workers were shipped to Germany to work in factories. British propaganda dramatizing the Rape of Belgium attracted much attention in the United States, while Berlin said it was both lawful and necessary because {{of the threat of}} franc-tireurs like those in France in 1870. The British and French magnified the reports and disseminated <b>them</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> and in the United States, where they {{played a major role in}} dissolving support for Germany.|$|E

25|$|Those who are {{suffering}} most keenly, and who have lost most, either of their children by death or their possessions by fire and sword, such as those reconcentrated women in the camps, have the most conspicuous patience, and never express a wish that their men should {{be the ones to}} give way. It must be fought out now, they think, to the bitter end. It is a very costly business upon which England has embarked, and even at such a cost hardly the barest necessities can be provided, and no comforts. It is so strange to think that every tent contains a family, and every family is in trouble–loss behind, poverty in front, sickness, privation and death in the present. But they are very good, and say they have agreed to be cheerful and {{make the best of it}} all. The Mafeking camp folk were very surprised to hear that English women cared a rap about them or their suffering. It has done them a lot of good to hear that real sympathy is felt for <b>them</b> <b>at</b> <b>home,</b> and so I am glad I fought my way here, if only for that reason.|$|E
