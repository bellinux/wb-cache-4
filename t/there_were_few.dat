5|$|At the {{beginning}} of his stay at Pondicherry, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>few</b> followers, but with time their numbers grew, resulting {{in the formation of the}} Sri Aurobindo Ashram in 1926. From 1926 he started to sign himself as Sri Aurobindo, Sri (meaning holy in Sanskrit) being commonly used as an honorific.|$|E
5|$|In July 2011, it was {{reported}} that the exterior work was complete. Features that Orascom has installed include exterior glass panels and telecommunications antennas. In 2012, photographs taken by Koryo Tours were released, showing the interior for the first time. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>few</b> fixtures or furnishings.|$|E
50|$|The {{island is}} still very new to tourism. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> very <b>few</b> {{tourists}} on the island. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>few</b> accommodations as well. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>few</b> home stays and resorts. One {{of the most famous}} resort is Angthong Beach Resort.|$|R
50|$|In addition, the {{industry}} {{has been criticized for}} lacking in racial diversity. For example, critics have noted that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>few</b> Asian plus size models. Others have noted that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>few</b> black plus-size models with darker skin tones.|$|R
30|$|In addition, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>fewer</b> {{academics}} claiming any difficulty when sharing, {{and this}} {{could be explained by}} the fact that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>fewer</b> algorithms in their possession and thus a lower number of people who see problems in sharing is natural.|$|R
5|$|It {{is unclear}} whether {{the story of the}} Tree That Owns Itself began with the Weekly Banner article, or if it had been an element of local {{folklore}} prior to that time. The article's author writes that, in 1890, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>few</b> people still living who knew the story.|$|E
5|$|On September 29, Washington {{moved the}} army closer to Yorktown and British gunners {{opened fire on}} the infantry. Throughout the day several British cannon fired on the Americans but <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>few</b> casualties. Fire was also {{exchanged}} between American riflemen and Hessian Jägers.|$|E
5|$|Politics in Texas {{during the}} early 1900s was defined by a spirit of Progressivism. Oil money funded the {{expansion}} of the highway system and the educational system. In general, however, the attitude toward business was laissez-faire. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>few</b> regulations on issues such as minimum wages and child labor.|$|E

5|$|The Judge {{was always}} {{headline}} news. He {{was a great}} showman, theatrical in appearance, with his sharp jaw and shock of white hair, and people always crowded into his courtroom, knowing there would be something going on. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>few</b> dull moments.|$|E
5|$|The battleship, {{particularly}} the dreadnought, was the dominant naval weapon of the World War I era. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>few</b> serious challenges at that time. The most significant naval battles of World War I, such as Jutland (May 31, 1916 – June 1, 1916), were fought by battleships and their battlecruiser cousins.|$|E
5|$|A 2004-05 EPA {{study of}} the river rated the water quality 6 out of 100. The study also {{discovered}} that dissolved oxygen levels in the water were low because <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>few</b> organisms, poor sediment, and little plant life in the river. Although storm water from residential neighborhoods added dissolved oxygen, it also brought ammonia from fertilizer. The Army Corps of Engineers found that the channeling prevented aquatic life from sustaining itself; few fish naturally spawn in the river because of the cement casing and flume at its mouth.|$|E

5|$|Chinese {{trade with}} the Roman Empire, {{confirmed}} by the Roman desire for silk, started in the 1st century BC. The Romans knew of wild silk harvested on Cos (coa vestis), {{but they did not}} at first make the connection with the silk that was produced in the Pamir Sarikol kingdom. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>few</b> direct trade contacts between Romans and Han Chinese, as the rival Parthians and Kushans were each protecting their lucrative role as trade intermediaries.|$|E
5|$|Compared to the {{previous}} season's Claxton Shield tournament, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>few</b> structural changes to the competition. With the expansion from five to six teams, the need for teams to have a bye was eliminated, with all teams participating in games each round. The individual rounds were expanded from three to four games per round, resulting in an increase from 24 to 40 games per team for the season. The postseason was also expanded to include the top four teams, rather than only the top three.|$|E
5|$|England {{started their}} second innings with {{a deficit of}} 337 runs and reached 1/54 by the {{premature}} {{end of the second}} day due to bad light. The following morning, they made slow and steady progress as Johnston bowled his finger spin from around the wicket with a well-protected off side. The four men in the off side ring had much work to do as Hutton hit the ball there repeatedly. The English batsmen progressed and Johnston had one confident appeal for lbw against Compton, but <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>few</b> scares.|$|E

5|$|From {{the turn}} of the 20th century {{to the start of the}} Second World War, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>few</b> changes in Altrincham. Although the town was witness to some of the Luftwaffe's raids on the Manchester area, it emerged from the war {{relatively}} unscathed, and as with the rest of Britain, experienced an economic boom. This manifested itself in the construction of new housing and the 1960s rebuilding of the town centre. However, during the 1970s employment at Broadheath declined by nearly 40per cent.|$|E
5|$|Home was {{generally}} warmly regarded by colleagues and opponents alike, and <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>few</b> politicians {{who did not}} respond well to him. One was Attlee, but as their political primes did not overlap this was of minor consequence. More important was Iain Macleod's prickly relationship with Home. Macleod, Secretary of State for the Colonies from 1959–61, was, like Butler, on the liberal wing of the Conservative party; he was convinced, as Home was not, that Britain's colonies in Africa should have majority rule and independence as quickly as possible. Their spheres of influence overlapped in the Central African Federation.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, the Chinese co-production of Sesame Street, Zhima Jie, was created. An auto {{mechanic}} became the head writer of this show, broadcast in Mandarin Chinese, because <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>few</b> people {{with experience in}} writing for children in the country. It has aired in 40 local markets, comprising forty percent of all Chinese homes. Its curriculum emphasized aesthetics. The Chinese puppeteers were trained by Kevin Clash and Caroll Spinney. Also in 1998, a fifteen-minute version of the Israeli show was dubbed in Arabic and renamed Shara'a Simsim; this Palestinian co-production promoted children's sense of national identity.|$|E

5|$|In {{the decades}} after Otto Jesse's death in 1901, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>few</b> new {{insights}} into the nature of noctilucent clouds. Wegener's conjecture, that they were composed of water ice, was later shown to be correct. Study was limited to ground-based observations and scientists had very little knowledge of the mesosphere until the 1960s, when direct rocket measurements began. These showed {{for the first time that}} the occurrence of the clouds coincided with very low temperatures in the mesosphere.|$|E
5|$|One last Scottish attempt {{against the}} king's person {{occurred}} in August 1600, when James was apparently assaulted by Alexander Ruthven, the Earl of Gowrie's younger brother, at Gowrie House, {{the seat of}} the Ruthvens. Ruthven was run through by James's page John Ramsay and the Earl of Gowrie was killed in the ensuing fracas; <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>few</b> surviving witnesses. Given James's history with the Ruthvens {{and the fact that he}} owed them a great deal of money, his account of the circumstances was not universally believed.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{establishment}} of the Romney Classical Institute in 1846, Romney and its environs had been served by a school as early as 1752, and by Romney Academy, which had been incorporated by the Virginia General Assembly on January 11, 1814. By 1831, Romney Academy had outgrown its educational facilities in an old stone building just north of the Hampshire County Courthouse in Romney. Also at this time, several academies in present-day West Virginia were aspiring to collegiate status, as <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>few</b> colleges operating in the region prior to the American Civil War.|$|E
