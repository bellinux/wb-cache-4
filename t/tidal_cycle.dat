25|$|Near {{the mouth}} of the Saint John River, where it passes through the city of Saint John, is the famous Reversing Falls. Here the {{changing}} tide causes alternating strong upriver and downriver flows several times a day as the <b>tidal</b> <b>cycle</b> changes. A narrow granite gorge and rocky bottom heavily restricts waterflow and creates strong rapids that flow upriver at high tide, and downriver at low tide.|$|E
25|$|The {{approximately}} fortnightly <b>tidal</b> <b>cycle</b> has large {{effects on}} intertidal and marine organisms. Hence their biological rhythms tend {{to occur in}} rough multiples of this period. Many other animals such as the vertebrates, display similar rhythms. Examples include gestation and egg hatching. In humans, the menstrual cycle lasts roughly a lunar month, an even multiple of the tidal period. Such parallels at least hint at the common descent of all animals from a marine ancestor.|$|E
25|$|In {{more complex}} situations, the main ebb and flood flows do not dominate.

An alternative is to treat the tidal flows as complex numbers, as each value has both a magnitude and a direction.|$|E

A series of surveys were carried out over individual <b>tidal</b> <b>cycles</b> (sampling every 5 - 10 mins for between 6 and 9 hrs); on consecutive low tides over half-lunar <b>tidal</b> <b>cycles</b> (1 - 2 cross-shore profiles sampled every 0. 5 - 1 m, on 2 spring- spring <b>tidal</b> <b>cycles</b> comprising 26 and 24 tides, respectively); and finally every 2 weeks at spring low tide, over 1 calendar year (13 - 17 profile lines surveyed and sampled for sediment over 3. 25 - 4. 25 km). In order to further our understanding of gravel beaches, sediment data needs to be collected at a resolution {{similar to that of}} the hydrodynamics. Innovative automatic sediment sizing techniques based on digital images of sediments were therefore developed, and software written, to allow the collection and analysis of high-resolution sediment data. The gravel beach step and berm are accretionary features, tidally modulated, and evolve under different time scales. A new technique to determine bed mobility from the nearshore, using underwater video cameras, was devised. Nearshore sediment transport was suggested as being related to sub-incident wave frequencies...|$|R

25|$|Tides are {{commonly}} semi-diurnal (two high waters and two low waters each day), or diurnal (one <b>tidal</b> <b>cycle</b> per day). The two high waters {{on a given}} day are typically not the same height (the daily inequality); these are the higher high water and the lower high water in tide tables. Similarly, the two low waters each day are the higher low water and the lower low water. The daily inequality is not consistent and is generally small when the Moon is over the equator.|$|E

25|$|Because the M2 tidal {{constituent}} dominates in most locations, {{the stage}} or {{phase of a}} tide, denoted by the time in hours after high water, is a useful concept. Tidal stage is also measured in degrees, with 360° per <b>tidal</b> <b>cycle.</b> Lines of constant tidal phase are called cotidal lines, which are analogous to contour lines of constant altitude on topographical maps. High water is reached simultaneously along the cotidal lines extending from the coast out into the ocean, and cotidal lines (and hence tidal phases) advance along the coast. Semi-diurnal and long phase constituents are measured from high water, diurnal from maximum flood tide. This and the discussion that follows is precisely true only for a single tidal constituent.|$|E
40|$|The carbon (C) {{concentration}} and flux, as {{dissolved organic carbon}} (DOC), particulate organic carbon (POC) and macrodetritus (MD), were quantified through 4 <b>tidal</b> <b>cycles</b> in a mangrove tidal creek in Southeastern Brazil. DOC was the major {{fraction of the total}} C concentration, accounting for 68 and 61 % of the total C concentration during ebb and flood periods respectively. Concentrations of DOC (Ebb = 3, 41 ± 0, 57 mgC. L- 1 and Flood = 3, 55 ± 0, 76 mgC. L- 1) and POC (Ebb = 1, 73 ± 0, 99 mgC. L- 1 and Flood = 1, 28 ± 0, 45 mgC. L- 1) were relatively similar during the four <b>tidal</b> <b>cycles.</b> Macrodetritus presented a wide variation with concentration peaks probably related to external forces, such as winds, which enrich the ebb flow with leaf litter. DOC and POC fluxes depended primarily on tidal and net water fluxes, whereas MD fluxes were not. The magnitude of the DOC and POC fluxes varied with the area flooded at high tide, but not the MD fluxes. DOC was the major form of carbon export to Sepetiba Bay.

40|$|Singular {{spectrum}} analysis for time series with missing data (SSAM) {{was used to}} reconstruct components of a 6 -yr time series of suspended-sediment concentration (SSC) from San Francisco Bay. Data were collected every 15 min and the time series contained missing values that primarily were due to sensor fouling. SSAM was applied in a sequential manner to calculate reconstructed components with time scales of variability that ranged from tidal to annual. Physical processes that controlled SSC and their contribution to the total variance of SSC were (1) diurnal, semidiurnal, and other higher frequency tidal constituents (24 %), (2) semimonthly <b>tidal</b> <b>cycles</b> (21 %), (3) monthly <b>tidal</b> <b>cycles</b> (19 %), (4) semiannual <b>tidal</b> <b>cycles</b> (12 %), and (5) annual pulses of sediment caused by freshwater inflow, deposition, and subsequent wind-wave resuspension (13 %). Of the total variance 89 % was explained and subtidal variability (65 %) was greater than tidal variability (24 %). Processes at subtidal time scales accounted for more variance of SSC than processes at tidal time scales because sediment accumulated {{in the water column}} and the supply of easily erodible bed sediment increased during periods of increased subtidal energy. This large range of time scales that each contained significant variability of SSC and associated contaminants can confound design of sampling programs and interpretation of resulting data.

25|$|Biotic factors here play a {{significant}} role in physical coastal evolution, and for wildlife a variety of habitats have developed which include beaches, estuaries, permanent and semi-permanent swamps, tidal flats, tidal creeks, coastal dunes, back dunes and levees. The mangrove vegetation itself assists in the formation of new landmass and the intertidal vegetation plays {{a significant}} role in swamp morphology. The activities of mangrove fauna in the intertidal mudflats develop micromorphological features that trap and hold sediments to create a substratum for mangrove seeds. The morphology and evolution of the eolian dunes is controlled by an abundance of xerophytic and halophytic plants. Creepers, grasses and sedges stabilise sand dunes and uncompacted sediments. The Sunderbans mudflats (Banerjee, 1998) are found at the estuary and on the deltaic islands where low velocity of river and tidal current occurs. The flats are exposed in low tides and submerged in high tides, thus being changed morphologically even in one <b>tidal</b> <b>cycle.</b> The tides are so large that approximately one third of the land disappears and reappears every day. The interior parts of the mudflats serve as a perfect home for mangroves.|$|E
25|$|The ocean's {{surface is}} closely {{approximated}} by an equipotential surface, (ignoring ocean currents) {{commonly referred to}} as the geoid. Since the gravitational force is equal to the potential's gradient, there are no tangential forces on such a surface, and the ocean surface is thus in gravitational equilibrium. Now consider the effect of massive external bodies such as the Moon and Sun. These bodies have strong gravitational fields that diminish with distance and act to alter the shape of an equipotential surface on the Earth. This deformation has a fixed spatial orientation relative to the influencing body. The Earth's rotation relative to this shape causes the daily <b>tidal</b> <b>cycle.</b> Gravitational forces follow an inverse-square law (force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance), but tidal forces are inversely proportional to the cube of the distance. The ocean surface moves because of the changing tidal equipotential, rising when the tidal potential is high, which occurs on the parts of the Earth nearest to and furthest from the Moon. When the tidal equipotential changes, the ocean surface is no longer aligned with it, so the apparent direction of the vertical shifts. The surface then experiences a down slope, in the direction that the equipotential has risen.|$|E

40|$|In some regions, {{tidal energy}} {{can be a}} key factor in the {{generation}} of variability in physical and biogeochemical properties throughout the water column. We use a numerical model resolving <b>tidal</b> <b>cycles</b> and simulating diversity in phytoplankton {{to assess the impact of}} tidal mixing on vertical stability and phytoplankton community (total biomass and diversity) in a macrotidal sea (Iroise Sea, France). Two different time scales have been considered: semidiurnal and spring/neap <b>tidal</b> <b>cycles.</b> Our results show that the latter is the one primarily influencing the phytoplankton growth conditions by modifying the vertical stratification. During spring tide, the growth is rather light limited, whereas neap tide conditions lead to vertical stabilization and better light conditions in the shallow surface layer.

40|$|The Marais Vernier, {{located in}} {{the upper reaches of}} the Seine River Estuary (northern France), {{preserves}} a thick Holocene succession of laminated detrital deposits and peats. The spectral analysis of one laminated deposit suggests that tidal processes were largely responsible for supplying sediments to this system. Two periods (16 and 32 laminae per cycle) were identified. These cycles can be related to either both the synodic neap–spring cycle (the so-called “fortnightly cycle”) and the anomalistic monthly cycle or both the semiannual and annual <b>tidal</b> <b>cycles.</b> The recognition of tidal influence on these deposits provides insight into the likelihood of some relative sea-level fluctuations previously inferred from these sediments.

500|$|Tides are {{the regular}} {{rise and fall}} in water level {{experienced}} by seas and oceans {{in response to the}} gravitational influences of the Moon and the Sun, and the effects of the Earth's rotation.

500|$|Tidal heating occurs {{through the}} tidal {{friction}} processes: orbital and rotational energy are dissipated as {{heat in the}} crust of an object. In addition, {{to the extent that}} tides produce heat along fractures, libration may affect the magnitude and distribution of such tidal shear heating. Tidal dissipation of Enceladus's ice crust is significant because Enceladus has a subsurface ocean. A computer simulation that used data from Cassini was published in November 2017, and it indicates that friction heat from the sliding rock fragments within the permeable and fragmented core of Enceladus could keep its underground ocean warm for up to billions of years. It is thought that if Enceladus had a more eccentric orbit in the past, the enhanced tidal forces could be sufficient to maintain a subsurface ocean, such that a periodic enhancement in eccentricity could maintain a subsurface ocean that periodically changes in size. A more recent analysis claimed that [...] "a model of the tiger stripes as tidally flexed slots that puncture the ice shell can simultaneously explain the persistence of the eruptions through the <b>tidal</b> <b>cycle,</b> the phase lag, and the total power output of the tiger stripe terrain, while suggesting that eruptions are maintained over geological timescales." [...] Previous models suggest that resonant perturbations of Dione could provide the necessary periodic eccentricity changes to maintain the subsurface ocean of Enceladus, if the ocean contains a substantial amount of ammonia. The surface of Enceladus indicates that the entire moon has experienced periods of enhanced heat flux in the past.|$|E

40|$|High shore littorinid snails exhibit complex spatial {{distribution}} patterns, forming dense aggregations both in crevices and on crevice-free sections of rocky shores. To understand how these patterns may form, an individual-based computer simulation of littorinid behaviour, {{similar to those}} used to model social insects, was used to mimic snail movement on rocky shores. Individual littorinid movement patterns were simulated, along with chance interactions with other littorinids, their trails, crevices and any resultant decisions made by the littorinids when these interactions occurred. The simulation investigated how simple behavioural rules can predict spatial aggregation patterns and the persistence and variation of these aggregation patterns over timescales of several <b>tidal</b> <b>cycles.</b> Morisita's index of dispersal showed good agreement between the simulation and observed patterns of littorinids on-shore. Trail-following was vital in the simulation, since points where trails intersected with crevices, or points where 2 or more trails met, formed the site of aggregations. Both in the simulation and in reality, aggregations often occurred in identical positions over several <b>tidal</b> <b>cycles,</b> both within and outside crevices. This temporal predictability {{may be due to the}} persistence of mucus trails on the shore over successive <b>tidal</b> <b>cycles.</b> Removal of the influence of past mucus trails from the simulation resulted in far lower persistence of aggregations over time.

These tidal rhythmites are records of daily <b>tidal</b> <b>cycles</b> and also indicate the presence of diurnal or mixed diurnal tides in {{this portion of the}} Cretaceous Western Interior Seaway. The tidal rhythmites occur within beds at the base of lateral accretion surfaces in a fluvially connected deltaic meandering tidal channel. The occurrence of Skolithos and rare Teredolites confirm a marine influence in this deposit. Tidal channels at the transition of the fluvial Menefee Formation to the overlying marine Cliff House Sandstone are well {{documented in the}} region (Olsen et al., 1999). The tidal channel filling deposits have a modern day analogue of the Brahmaputra River Delta. These Cretaceous tidal rhythmite thickness patterns occur in both planar laminations and bidirectional ripples. Alternating sandstone and shale planar lamination are inferred to be deposits from tidal flood and ebb events. Bidirectional ripples with shale “mud drapes” also have thickness patterns consistent with tidal rhythmites. Both types of tidal rhythmites show evidence of a semidiurnal or semidiurnal mixed paleotidal system as they lack a distinct linear trend between flood and ebb lamina (Archer et al., 1995). Fifty four planar laminations are persevered that represent 27 <b>tidal</b> <b>cycles.</b> Thirty six separate ripples with opposing slip face directions represent 36 <b>tidal</b> <b>cycles.</b> The cyclic variation in thickness patterns of both planar laminations and bidirectional ripples are similar to modern asymmetrical tidal patterns (flood dominant or ebb dominant).

The thickness and recorded duration of the <b>tidal</b> rhythmite <b>cycles</b> was limited due to truncation of bidirectional ripple deposits by either storm surges or fluvial floods.
