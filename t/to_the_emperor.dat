5|$|The eastern {{section of}} the Notitia is dated to c. 395, at the death of Theodosius I. At this time, {{according}} to the Notitia, in the East there were 2 imperial escort armies (comitatus praesentales), each commanded by a magister militum praesentalis, the highest military rank, who reported direct <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>emperor.</b> These contained units of mainly palatini grade. In addition, there were 3 diocesan comitatus, in East Illyricum, Thraciae and Oriens dioceses, consisting mostly of comitatenses-grade troops. Each was commanded by a magister militum, who also reported direct <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>emperor.</b>|$|E

A Hi deflects, and offers him a magic horse. Again, <b>the</b> <b>Emperor</b> is impressed, but orders A Hi to hand over his assistant. Liang, Tiao Tsien's lover, attempts to escape with her, but is captured; while she is taken <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Emperor's</b> private quarters.

5|$|In both East and West, the scholae, the emperors' {{personal}} cavalry escort, lay {{outside the}} normal military chain of command. According to the Notitia, the tribuni (commanders) of the scholae {{reported to the}} magister officiorum, a senior civilian official. However, this was probably for administrative purposes only. On campaign, a tribunus scholae probably reported direct <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>emperor</b> himself.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the first}} astrologers to bring Hermetic astrology to Rome was Thrasyllus, astrologer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>emperor</b> Tiberius, the first emperor {{to have had a}} court astrologer, though his {{predecessor}} Augustus had used astrology to help legitimise his Imperial rights.|$|E
5|$|Tiberius gave {{money out}} to the people of Rome in his name, and he was {{scheduled}} to hold the consulship next year with the emperor.

5|$|A Han kingdom {{was much}} like a commandery in size and administration, except it was officially, and after 145 BC, nominally, the fief of a {{relative}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>emperor,</b> including brothers, uncles, nephews, and sons—excluding the heir apparent. The policy of awarding kingdoms only to imperial relatives was gradually adopted by the founder Emperor Gaozu of Han (r. 202–195 BC), {{as many of the}} early kings were non-relatives who were leading officers during the Chu-Han contention (206–202 BC). Kingdoms were usually inherited by the king's eldest son born to his queen.|$|E
5|$|Access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>emperor</b> {{by others}} might be gained {{at the daily}} {{reception}} (salutatio), a development of the traditional homage a client paid to his patron; public banquets hosted at the palace; and religious ceremonies. The common people who lacked this access could manifest their general approval or displeasure as a group at the games held in large venues. By the 4th century, as urban centres decayed, the Christian emperors became remote figureheads who issued general rulings, no longer responding to individual petitions.|$|E
5|$|Basil II was at {{that time}} in the eastern provinces of his empire, {{wintering}} on the plain of Tarsus following his campaign against the Fatimid dynasty in Syria. On hearing of David’s death he marched north-eastward to claim the lands David had promised <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>emperor.</b> The local Georgian and Armenian nobility submitted without any serious resistance. The only notable incident occurred when a quarrel between a Georgian soldier and a Varangian Guardsman over a bale of hay developed into a major fight, involving 6,000 Varangians and taking the lives of thirty Georgian high-ranking nobles.|$|E

5|$|Constantine I {{completed}} {{the separation of}} military commands from the administrative structure. The vicarii and praefecti praetorio lost their field commands and became purely administrative officials. However, they retained {{a central role in}} military affairs, as they remained responsible for military recruitment, pay and, above all, supply. It is unclear whether the duces on the border now reported direct <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>emperor,</b> or to one of the two magistri of the comitatus.|$|E

5|$|Epiacum is in {{some ways}} a typical Roman fort: inside the wall are {{straight}} roads which cross, a headquarters building (the Praetorium), the commandant's house, a set of barrack blocks for the cohort of auxiliary soldiers, and granaries to store food.

5|$|Given {{the ferocity}} of the Russian defense, {{everyone}} was aware that {{such a move would}} cost the lives of thousands of Guardsmen, but it was thought that the presence of this prestigious unit would bolster the morale of the entire army for a final decisive push.

As the general staff were discussing the matter, general Rapp, a senior aide-de-camp <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Emperor,</b> was being brought from the field of battle, having been wounded in action.|$|E
5|$|Géza {{planned to}} invade Paristrionthe Byzantine {{province}} along the Lower Danubein {{the spring of}} 1153.

However, the emperor, who had been informed of Géza's plan, marched to the Danube. Géza sent his envoys <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>emperor</b> and a new peace treaty was signed in Sardica (now Sofia in Bulgaria). In accordance with the peace treaty, the Byzantines released their Hungarian prisoners of wars, according to Abū Hāmid al-Gharnātī, a Muslim traveler from Granada who lived in Hungary between 1150 and 1153.|$|E
