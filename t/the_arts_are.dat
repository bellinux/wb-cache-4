Calhoun supported his view with the following reasoning: in every civilized society one portion of the community must live on the labor of another; learning, science, and <b>the</b> <b>arts</b> <b>are</b> built upon leisure; the African slave, kindly treated by his master and mistress and looked after in his old age, is better off than the free laborers of Europe; and under the slave system conflicts between capital and labor are avoided.
