The work, undocumented and traditionally attributed by critics to Antonio Ferrari d'Agrate, was assigned in 2010 to the catalog {{of the works of}} Cairano due to obvious correlation with the mature art of the artist. This spread of Gasparo's artistic reach is significant and demonstrates that he could prove a success even outside of Brescia.|$|E

5|$|Following hatching, larvae {{feed on the}} {{reproductive}} structures of the plant and usually develop through four to six instars. Initially, the young larva feed together, and <b>this</b> <b>stage</b> <b>is</b> their most destructive stage. Through maturation, older larvae become aggressive and cannibalistic, leaving one or two larvae per feeding site (See Interfamilial Predation). They usually have orange heads, black thorax plates, and a body color that is primarily black. Their bodies can also be brown, pink, green, and yellow with many thorny microspines. Mature larvae migrate to the soil, where they pupate for 12 to 16 days.|$|E

40|$|As {{the most}} of the fish {{resources}} are known and exploited, protecting their generation is of the greatest importance. Aquaculture is one of the efficient procedures in protecting and reviving fish resources and knowing about the reproductive cycle and gonads development has an important role in approaching this aim. Liza abu belongs to the family Mugilidae that according to its resistance to the environmental condition and its fast growth, can be introduced as a fish with economical value. As there is no scientific data on the reproductive biology of this species, study on the reproductive biology and gonad development is considered as the aim of this research. For this purpose, 360 samples of this species were investigated during the period from February 2007 to January 2008 in Khozestan Province. After studing morphological and histological characteristics of gonad specimen, they were prepared through histological method. Samples were prepared through usual histological method and studied under light microscope. According to the results, the maturity stages of male and female Liza abu were separated to six different successive stages. In ovaries, these <b>stages</b> <b>were</b> as follow : In stage І, the oocytes <b>were</b> small, <b>this</b> <b>stage</b> <b>was</b> observed from July to October. In stage ІІ, considerable growth was observed in the oocytes. <b>This</b> <b>stage</b> <b>was</b> observed from October to January. In stage III, due to vitellogenesis, the maximum growth was observed and three layers of theca, granullosa and follicle cells <b>were</b> visible. <b>This</b> <b>stage</b> <b>was</b> observed during January and February. In stage IV, migration of germinal vesicle was observed and due to hydration of the oocytes, their diameter was increased. The ovaries were yellowish and in maximum size and ovules could be easily observed with naked-eye. <b>This</b> <b>stage</b> <b>was</b> observed in February and March. In stage V, spawning occured. <b>This</b> <b>stage</b> <b>was</b> observed in April. In stage VI, ovaries consisted of immature and atretic oocytes and also empty follicles. <b>This</b> <b>stage</b> <b>was</b> observed in May and June. In testes, these <b>stages</b> <b>were</b> as follow : In stage I, the testes were small in size and contained the spermatogonia which were the only cellular components. <b>This</b> <b>stage</b> <b>was</b> observed in August and September. In stage II (maturing virgin), the spermatogonia and the primary spermatocytes <b>were</b> visible. <b>This</b> <b>stage</b> <b>was</b> observed in October. In stage III (developing), intensive spermatogenesis was occured and the primary and the secondary spermatocytes were the most visible cells during <b>this</b> <b>stage.</b> <b>This</b> <b>stage</b> <b>was</b> observed from November to January. In stage IV(developed), cells of all stages of spermatogenesis could be seen but the secondary spermatocytes and spermatids were in large number. <b>This</b> <b>stage</b> <b>was</b> observed from January to March. In stage V, the testes were filled with sperms. <b>This</b> <b>stage</b> <b>was</b> observed in March and April. In stage VI, residual spermatozoa and the spermatogonia were visible in the testes. <b>This</b> <b>stage</b> <b>was</b> observed from May to August. According to cyclic changes in GSI, sexual maturation in breeding begins in January and spawning occurs in April. The ova diameter ranged from 30. 75 μ in stage I to 472. 19 μ in <b>stage</b> IV. In <b>this</b> study, the sex ratio was 1 : 2. 7, and male and female percentage were 27. 02...|$|R
5|$|In {{the initial}} phase of decompression, the {{critical}} event {{is assumed to}} be the arrival of an arterial bubble in a de-saturating neurological tissue. The bubble exchanges gas with the surrounding tissue and the blood. If the bubble does not exceed a critical radius, it will eventually leave the site without growing, otherwise it will block the blood circulation and cause ischemia. The critical parameter is bubble radius. This criterion is used to prevent type II neurological symptoms. The strategy for a safe rate of ascent at <b>this</b> <b>stage</b> <b>is</b> to balance gas exchange.|$|E
5|$|In {{the later}} phase of decompression, the {{critical}} event {{is assumed to}} be the presence of a large bubble that has taken up a large quantity of dissolved gas from the adjacent tissue in a joint. If the bubble reaches a critical volume, it will have a mechanical effect on the nerve endings causing pain in a tendon. The bubble volume is the critical parameter. This criterion is used to prevent type I pain-only symptoms. The strategy for a safe ascent at <b>this</b> <b>stage</b> <b>is</b> to prevent any gas phase from growing beyond a critical volume.|$|E
5|$|Hemimetabolous insects, {{those with}} {{incomplete}} metamorphosis, change gradually by undergoing {{a series of}} molts. An insect molts when it outgrows its exoskeleton, which does not stretch and would otherwise restrict the insect's growth. The molting process begins as the insect's epidermis secretes a new epicuticle inside the old one. After this new epicuticle is secreted, the epidermis releases a mixture of enzymes that digests the endocuticle and thus detaches the old cuticle. When <b>this</b> <b>stage</b> <b>is</b> complete, the insect makes its body swell by taking in a large quantity of water or air, which makes the old cuticle split along predefined weaknesses where the old exocuticle was thinnest.|$|E

5|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus infection and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) is {{a spectrum of}} conditions caused by infection with the human {{immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV). Following initial infection, a person may not notice any symptoms or may experience {{a brief period of}} influenza-like illness. Typically, this is followed by a prolonged period with no symptoms. As the infection progresses, it interferes more with the immune system, increasing the risk of common infections like tuberculosis, as well as other opportunistic infections, and tumors that rarely affect people who have working immune systems. These late symptoms of infection are referred to as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). <b>This</b> <b>stage</b> <b>is</b> often also associated with weight loss.|$|E
5|$|The {{life cycle}} of A.gallica {{includes}} two diploidization–haploidization events. The first {{of these is the}} usual process of cell fusion (forming a diploid) followed by meiosis during the formation of haploid basidiospores. The second event is more cryptic, and occurs before fruit body formation. In most basidiomycetous fungi, the hyphae of compatible mating types will fuse to form a two-nucleate, or dikaryotic stage; <b>this</b> <b>stage</b> <b>is</b> not observed in Armillaria species, which have cells that are mostly monokaryotic and diploid. Genetic analyses suggest that the dikaryotic mycelia undergo an extra haploidization event prior to fruit body formation to create a genetic mosaic. These regular and repeating haploidization events result in increased genetic diversity, which helps the fungus to adapt to unfavorable changes in environmental conditions, like drought.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, {{pyrethroids}} and neonicotinoids {{have been}} used against B. rufimanus. Because of the faba bean crop biology and its attraction to pollinators at flowering stage, restrictions on pesticides uses have been introduced in Europe. It is particularly advised to spray in absence of pollinators {{in the early morning}} and evening. In addition, due to B. rufimanus biology, a temperature threshold combined with crop development stage can be used to increase the success of chemical treatments. Adult B. rufimanus activity increases with temperature, so that treatment efficiency might increase when maximum day temperatures are over 20°C during four consecutive days after treatment (Arvalis, 2016). Adult B. rufimanus activity increases with temperature, so that treatment efficiency might increase when maximum day temperatures are over 20°C during four consecutive days after treatment. The end of blooming indicates the end of adult activity in the field. <b>This</b> <b>stage</b> <b>is</b> therefore a threshold marking the end of insecticide application and occurs no later than five days after last blooming. Forecasting systems (Bruchi-LIS, Arvalis, France and BruchidCast, Syngenta, UK) have been developed to optimize insecticide applications based on temperature and crop stage.|$|E

5|$|The Marcomannic Wars fought during 166–180 AD {{were caused}} by the {{pressure}} exerted by the northern Germanic peoples (settled around the area of today's Poland) on the tribes located {{in the vicinity of}} Roman limes, the Empire's defended border. Expansion of the Proto-Gothic Wielbark culture displaced from northern Greater Poland and Masovia the Przeworsk culture people; they in turn, moving south and east, crossed during the third quarter of the 2nd century the Carpathian Mountains. The ethnic composition of the Przeworsk population at <b>this</b> <b>stage</b> <b>is</b> not known, as the Lugii tribes no longer seem to be mentioned. Related to the Przeworsk culture was the Wietrzno-Solina type, a cultural unit with Celtic and then Dacian elements, situated within the more eastern part of the Beskids range (San River basin) during the 100–250 AD period. The Kotins tribe Celtic survivors with their Púchov culture disappeared now for good, {{as a result of their}} migration and involvement in the Marcomannic Wars. There were also changes in northwest Poland, on the border of the Elbe cultural sphere region. The Lubusz group there was absorbed by the new Luboszyce culture (Luboszyce, Krosno Odrzańskie County), that occupied the middle Oder basin during the 140–430 AD period. Its birth was related to the arrival from the east of population groups strongly influenced by the Przeworsk and Wielbark cultures. Gradually a new branch of Germanic people, the Burgundians, whose origins are traced back to Scandinavia and the Bornholm island in particular and whose ancestors then migrated to the northwest Przework culture area, developed and evolved under new favorable conditions here. On the other hand, the Gustow group left western Pomerania, to be replaced after 70 years by the Dębczyn group (Dębczyn, Wschowa County), established by the arrivals from the Elbe cultures and lasting between 210 and 450 AD.|$|E
