500|$|Based {{on a study}} {{conducted}} by Dale Jorgenson, proponents state that production cost of domestic goods and services could decrease by approximately 22% on average after embedded tax costs are removed, leaving the sale nearly the same after taxes. The study concludes that producer prices would drop between 15% and 26% (depending on the type of good/service). Jorgenson's research included all income and payroll taxes in the embedded tax estimation, which assumes employee <b>take-home</b> <b>pay</b> (net income) remains unchanged from pre-FairTax levels. [...] Price and wage changes after the FairTax would largely depend on the response of the Federal Reserve monetary authorities. Non-accommodation of the money supply would suggest retail prices and take home pay stay the same—embedded taxes are replaced by the FairTax. Full accommodation would suggest prices and incomes rise by the exclusive rate (i.e., 30%)—embedded taxes become windfall gains. Partial accommodation would suggest a varying degree in-between.|$|E

50|$|The labour-costs of an {{employer}} {{are not the}} same as the real buying power a worker acquires through working. An employer usually also has to pay taxes & levies to the government in respect of workers hired, which may include social security contributions or superannuation benefits. In addition there are often also administrative costs. So, in the United States for example, out of the total expenditure on labour by employers, the workers get about 60% as <b>take-home</b> <b>pay,</b> but about 40% consists of taxes, benefits and ancillary costs. Employers may be able to claim back part of the surcharge on labour by means of various tax credits, or because the tax on business income is lowered.|$|E
5000|$|The credit {{was given}} {{at a rate}} of 6.2 percent of earned income up to a maximum of $400 for {{individuals}} or $800 for married taxpayers. Making Work Pay could be claimed by single filers making between $8,100 per year and $95,000 per year. Joint filers in the range of $8,100 and $190,000 could claim it annually. Typically employers reduced withholding to provide an increase in <b>take-home</b> <b>pay</b> without any effort required from taxpayers. If the taxpayer had multiple jobs or was self-employed, they needed to adjust withholding. However, if the worker had multiple jobs or was unemployed, they had the option to receive the credit via lump sum (all $400 to $800 at once) after tax day.|$|E
50|$|In a September 2014 opinion {{piece for}} Berliner Zeitung and Les Échos, Asmussen and European Central Bank {{executive}} board member Benoît Cœuré wrote that “Germany can {{use some of}} its budgetary room of maneuver to support investment and reduce tax wedges - {{the difference between what}} employers pay in wages and the total <b>take-home</b> <b>pay</b> for workers - while preserving its sound fiscal position. In doing so, it would tackle some its own future economic challenges.” The two officials also called on France to press ahead with labour market reforms while sticking to the budget deficit targets agreed with the European Commission. “The article does not reflect current government policy and we don’t agree,” a spokesperson for Germany’s finance ministry said.|$|E
5000|$|The Congressional Budget Office {{has also}} {{described}} how the tax treatment of insurance premiums may affect behavior: One factor perpetuating inefficiencies {{in health care}} is a lack of clarity regarding the cost of health insurance and who bears that cost, especially employment-based health insurance. Employers’ payments for employment-based health insurance and nearly all payments by employees for that insurance are excluded from individual income and payroll taxes. Although both theory and evidence suggest that workers ultimately finance their employment-based insurance through lower <b>take-home</b> <b>pay,</b> the cost is not evident to many workers.... If transparency increases and workers see how much their income is being reduced for employers’ contributions and what those contributions are paying for, there might be a broader change in cost-consciousness that shifts demand.|$|E
50|$|More than 21 million {{housing units}} were {{constructed}} between 1946 and 1960, {{and in the}} latter year 52% of consumer units in the metropolitan areas owned their own homes.

Car ownership also soared, with 72% of consumer units owning an automobile by 1960. From 1958 to 1964, the average weekly <b>take-home</b> <b>pay</b> of blue-collar workers rose steadily from $68 to $78 (in constant dollars).

50|$|The {{most common}} forms of {{consumer}} debt are credit card debt, payday loans, and other consumer finance, {{which are often}} at higher interest rates than long-term secured loans, such as mortgages. The amount of debt outstanding versus the consumer's disposable income is expressed as the consumer leverage ratio. On a monthly basis, this debt ratio is advised {{to be no more}} than 20 percent of an individuals <b>take-home</b> <b>pay.</b> The interest rate charged depends on a range of factors, including the economic climate, perceived ability of the customer to repay, competitive pressures from other lenders, and the inherent structure and security of the credit product. Rates generally range from 0.25 percent above base-rate, to well into double figures. Consumer debt is also associated with Predatory lending, although there is much debate as to what exactly constitutes predatory lending.|$|E

50|$|The {{law does}} not mandate that meal breaks and rest days be paid; Secretary for Labour and Welfare Matthew Cheung stated that this should be decided by private {{negotiation}} between employers and employees.

In November 2010, before the minimum wage came into effect, fast-food chain Cafe de Coral had forced staff to sign new contracts that would give them a pay raise but see their paid meal breaks forfeited, effectively leading to lower pay. In April 2011, Edward Cheng, president of the Hong Kong Association of Property Management Companies, the largest property management association in Hong Kong, stated that he would appeal to their members to retain paid meal breaks for estate security guards where possible; however, he pointed out that the property owners themselves would have to approve any consequent increases in management fees.|$|E

50|$|On 21 September 1956, the Army {{reactivated}} the Screaming Eagles. The {{departure of}} the 11th Airborne Division for NATO duty in Germany and according to a display board at the Fort Campbell museum, the loss of jump pay on the local Hopkinsville-Clarksville economy caused the local Congressmen {{to go to the}} Pentagon asking for a favor. Fort Campbell's straddling of the Kentucky-Tennessee border made it of interest to three Congressional districts (two Tennessee, one Kentucky) and four Senators. In those days, the hundred bucks a month almost doubled a private’s <b>take-home</b> <b>pay,</b> and most of that got spent in Hopkinsville or Clarksville, helping what were still economically depressed towns surrounded by farms. The fact that the division’s wartime commander, then-Major General Maxwell Taylor, was now the Army Chief of Staff surely played a part in the 101st’s return to active duty. The Army needed another rapidly deployable unit to face Cold War contingencies, and Taylor figured it should be his old one. The reactivated 101st was formed using the assets of the 187th 508th Airborne RCTs, plus volunteers from the deactivating 6th Infantry Division run through parachute school either on Campbell or at Fort Benning.|$|E
5000|$|The International Labour Organisation (ILO) {{suggests}} that poverty {{is the greatest}} single cause behind child labour. Pakistan has a per-capita income of approximately $1900.

[...] Poverty levels in Pakistan appear to necessitate that children work in order to allow families to reach their target <b>take‐home</b> <b>pay.</b> For companies, the low cost of child labour gives manufacturers a significant advantage in the Western marketplace, where they undersell their competitors from countries which prohibiting child labour. [...] According to research conducted by Akhtar, Fatima, & Sadaqt, a main cause of child labour in the fishing sector on the Balochistan coast was the low quality of education, lack of job prospects, and lack of progress in the region.

50|$|However, {{demand for}} coal {{nationwide}} dropped precipitously and continually in the {{several years after}} World War I. In a response, Hillman closed its mines at Ella and Patterson, Allegheny County, and at Naomi, Fayette County, but maintained production at Boswell and Jerome. By mid-1921, the Company told its shareholders in its Annual Report, “…the demand coal became so small and the competition from non-union fields so severe that {{it was evident that}} the non-union mines of your Company could not continue to operate unless wages were readjusted. As a result of this condition, wages were reduced…at your Jerome Mines on July 16, 1921.” Hillman continued that the reduction allowed the Jerome mine to operate “on a competitive basis” and “with regularity,” with the result being that “earnings of the men at your non-union mines for the year 1921 are far in excess of those received by men at union mines….”, who, Hillman implied, suffered frequent short-term furloughs as the result of slack demand. Hillman told its shareholders that, prior to the pay cut, “men working by day were being paid $7.50 for eight hours work, and men working by the ton were able to earn $10.00 to $14.00 per day.” (Note that these wages reported by Hillman to its stockholders were flatly contradicted by other reportage, for instance, Blankenhorn maintained that union gross wages in 1922 more typically ranged from $14.60 to $17.50 per week, and after deductions for goods purchased through company stores, a typical miner's weekly net <b>take-home</b> <b>pay</b> often was less than $1.00.) On all its coal operations, including Jerome and Boswell, Hillman Coal and Coke reported an operating profit of approximately $925,000, on revenues of $8.225 million in 1919, and an operating profit of approximately $336,000, on revenues of $4.475 million in 1921.|$|E
40|$|The authors use the 1994 Living Standards Measurement Survey to {{show that}} the impact of labor market regulations, namely {{mandated}} benefits, is mitigated by reducing the base earnings on which they are calculated. Therefore, market regulation neither accounts for labor market segmentation nor for slow growth and increased inequality alone. Ecuador's regulations do raise <b>take-home</b> <b>pay,</b> but less than the vast number of benefits would suggest. The increase in labor costs induced by compliance is even smaller than the corresponding increase in <b>take-home</b> <b>pay,</b> because mandated benefits are not subject to social security contributions or payroll taxes. Despite mandated benefits, wage differentials between industries are comparable to those in Bolivia, a country otherwise similar to Ecuador, yet known to have"flexible"labor markets. Compliance with these regulations is associated with significantly higher <b>take-home</b> <b>pay</b> only in the public sector and where trade unions are active -and it is unclear that merely changing the labor code would bring wages down in those two areas. The most dramatic earnings gap, the one between jobs in agriculture {{and the rest of the}} economy, appearsto be largely independent of either unions or labor laws. The authors conclude, therefore, that drastically streamlining the cumbersome labor laws, although welcome, would only produce moderate change.
