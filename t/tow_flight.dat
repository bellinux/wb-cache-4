25|$|From 17 June 1942, a Rotachute Mark III was air-towed {{behind a}} Tiger Moth on a 300ft (91.4 m) tow line. After two <b>towed</b> <b>flights,</b> the Rotachute was {{released}} {{at an altitude}} of 200ft (61 m) and made the first manned free flight and controlled landing. Further free flights were made from altitudes up to 3,900ft (1,189 m). On 1 July 1942, AFEE moved its main base from Ringway to RAF Sherburn-in-Elmet. Additional directional stability was achieved in the Rotachute Mark IV, that introduced endplates onto the rigid tailplanes.|$|R
50|$|In the RAF, Miles Master IIs {{were used}} for this purpose as part of the Target <b>Towing</b> <b>Flight</b> at the Central Gunnery School whilst the School was based at RAF Sutton Bridge from April 1942 to March 1944. Other {{aircraft}} used in this role were the Hawker Henley, the Boulton Paul Defiant and the Westland Lysander, although the RAF was {{by no means the only}} air arm to use target tugs. They were used by most air forces. The USAAF used older aircraft such as the TBD Devastator as target tugs, and the Luftwaffe and the VVS (Red Army) also used them.|$|R

50|$|In 1906 {{he began}} his first {{experiments}} in <b>towed</b> <b>flight.</b> On 19 September 1906 he flew 500 m. He made his first powered flight on October 10, 1907, a distance of 100 m with the REP 1. This was driven by a seven-cylinder, 30 hp air-cooled engine of his own design.Trials of the monoplane REP 2 began on June 8, 1908. This aircraft set a record with a 1,200 m flight, reaching an altitude of 30 m. After {{a modified version of}} this plane was flown for the last time in 1909 at Rheims, Pelterie stopped flying and instead focused on the development and manufacture of aircraft.|$|R
5000|$|Glider {{training}} {{was performed by}} the 14th Troop Carrier Squadron, which arrived on 9 October 1942 with C-47 Skytrains being used for tow planes. The 878th, 879th and 880th Glider Training Squadrons were established at the base, equipped with the new Waco CG-4A [...] "Hadrian" [...] Glider. Cadets honed their skills, takeoff, and <b>towed</b> <b>flight</b> on a 350' nylon rope behind a C-47 Skytrain tow plane. The pilots held their position with two gliders being double towed. Also gliders were prepared {{on the ground for}} being snatched by a tow aircraft flying overhead. Cadets also were trained in infantry skills, as they were expected to serve as combat soldiers after landing.|$|R

2500|$|Brooklands {{was also}} one of Britain's first airfields. In 1908 Alliott Verdon-Roe was based at Brooklands and carried out the first taxiing and <b>towed</b> <b>flight</b> trials of a British {{full-size}} powered aircraft by a British pilot. On Friday, 29 October 1909 the first official powered flight at Brooklands was made by Frenchman Louis Paulhan and his Farman biplane: this special event attracted 20,000 people and was the first public flying display at Brooklands. Operating from specially prepared land inside the Race Track and given his own aeroplane shed, Paulhan made a series of flights on the following days, flying to a height of some [...] on the Saturday and setting a new British endurance record of 2hr 49min 20s on the Monday.|$|R

50|$|Training using live {{ammunition}} {{was carried out}} on drogue targets (similar to a windsock), towed behind a target tug, most commonly Miles Masters or Westland Lysanders. Hawker Henleys were also used briefly at the School - see link for photograph of a drogue. The CGS operated its own Target <b>Towing</b> <b>Flight.</b> The ammunition of various Spitfires was painted in different colours, for example, blue green and red. Three Spitfires made attacks on one drogue, after which the target-towing aircraft dropped the drogue at a dropping zone near the airfield; it would then stream another drogue in readiness for another three pilots to make their attacks. By subsequent examination of the colour of the paint around {{the holes in the}} drogue, percentage hit rates of individual pilots could be assessed.|$|R

25|$|On 15 February 1942, {{the unit}} was again reorganised, {{to form the}} Airborne Forces Experimental Establishment (AFEE), still based at Ringway. The rotary wing section of AFEE {{continued}} to conduct tests on longer runways during detachments at RAF Snaith and RAF Chelveston. On 29 May 1942, the first flight of the Rotachute Mark II was achieved while under tow behind a Jeep, and several more <b>towed</b> <b>flights</b> were also successful. Meanwhile, the Mark III had been produced, with a tail section comprising a wooden framework covered in doped linen fabric plus a rigid tailplane. Starting on 2 June 1942, the Rotachute Mark III was flown at heights up to 100ft (30.5 m) while under tow behind a Jeep, with tow rope lengths up to 300ft (91.4 m). From 9 June, successful inflight releases and landings were achieved while under tow.|$|R
40|$|Report {{presents}} the results of an investigation made to find the effect of ground on the aerodynamic characteristics of a Franklin PS- 2 glider. The lift, the drag, and the angle of attack of the glider in <b>towed</b> <b>flight</b> were determined at several heights from 0. 14 to 1. 19 span lengths and at various speeds for each height. Two wing arrangements were tested: the plain wing, and the wing with a nearly full-span 30 -percent-chord split flap deflected 45 degrees. The experimental results for the plain wing were in good agreement with theoretical values calculated by the method of Wieselsberger for both the angle of attack and the drag coefficient at a height of 0. 21 span length; Tani's refinements of the theory had a practically negligible effect on the computed values in this case...|$|R

5000|$|Captain Eric Brown RN, Chief Naval Test Pilot and {{commanding}} officer of the Captured Enemy Aircraft Flight, who tested the Me 163 at the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) at Farnborough, said, [...] "The Me 163 was an aeroplane {{that you could not}} afford to just step into the aircraft and say 'You know, I'm going to fly it to the limit.' You had very much to familiarise yourself with it because it was state-of-the-art and the technology used." [...] Acting unofficially, after a spate of accidents involving Allied personnel flying captured German aircraft resulted in official disapproval of such flights, Brown was determined to fly a powered Komet. On around 17 May 1945, he flew an Me 163B at Husum {{with the help of a}} cooperative German ground crew, after initial <b>towed</b> <b>flights</b> in an Me 163A to familiarise himself with the handling.|$|R

5000|$|The {{unit was}} {{initially}} organized as the 6th Fighter Wing on 27 August 1942, {{under the control}} of VIII Fighter Command. [...] During 1942 and early 1943, it trained pilots in combat operations as well as air-to-air-gunnery with the attached 1st Gunnery & <b>Tow</b> Target <b>Flight.</b> [...] The training was conducted using Supermarine Spitfies and pilots drawn from the 67th Observation Group at RAF Membury (AAF-466) and RAF Middle Wallop (AAF-449).|$|R
5000|$|From 1944 {{until the}} end of the war, salvage of both 8th and 9th AF war weary {{aircraft}} became an increasingly feverish aspect of work at both stations, as was the training of bomber crews.

5000|$|A {{few years}} ago, in the UK a banner-towing {{aircraft}} crashed {{at the end}} of a flight; it carried a passenger, a politician for whose election campaign the banner <b>towing</b> <b>flight</b> was intended to draw attention. Unfortunately, it did that but for the wrong reasons. At the time, it was speculated in the press that the extra weight of the passenger would have been the cause of the accident. This is highly unlikely. The aircraft should have been able to carry the added weight. It is much more likely that the pilot was making a low pass to allow the press photographers to get a good shot. Flying at low airspeed, the banner will be substantially below the flight path of the aircraft. It is probable that the pilot misjudged the height and room required to remain clear of the surface, the banner dragged over the ground and the rapidly increasing resistance as more parts of the banner would come into contact with the surface would in a very short time, a matter of mere seconds, caused the aircraft to stall. Releasing the banner, either by the pilot or by the [...] "weak link" [...] breaking would not have saved the aircraft: It would have been in a full stall and losing the stabilizing effect of the banner it is likely that it slammed into the ground. In a fully developed stall, the application of full power would also have been too late to take effect.|$|R
5000|$|Prosser {{was born}} in Wolverhampton. He {{obtained}} his Royal Aero Club Aviator's Certificate from Hendon Flying School, London, in June 1913, and {{became a member of}} Birmingham Aero Club. Prosser and Mr A. M.

Prosser flew a 50 hp Caudron biplane over Cwmamman, Wales. The Amman Valley Chronicle reported on 30 October 1913: [...] "Every vantage point was thronged with people watching the first aeroplane flying through the district and, of course, like most other things, it went to Ammanford." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Service Pilot Badge {{was awarded}} to {{soldiers}} in MOS 773: [...] "Pilots airplanes on noncombat flights such as observation <b>flights,</b> <b>tow</b> target <b>flights,</b> and in ferrying aircraft. (Type of airplane flown depends on rating.)" [...] This rating was awarded only to male officers, flight/warrant officers and enlisted personnel of the U.S. Army Air Forces, and had no connection whatsoever with the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP) program. The search for qualified pilots intensified in 1942. Early on, the Ferrying Command scoured the country for all available civilian fliers; bush pilots, test pilots, crop dusters, stunt pilots, barnstormers, and pilots who flew on personal business or for fun all became candidates. These draftees were expected to have five hundred hours of flying experience, a requirement that soon dropped to two hundred to three hundred hours, depending on the military’s need. If they could pass a ninety-day probation period, they became commissioned officers. By the end of 1942, a total of 1,372 pilots had been commissioned, but the AAF’s own flight-training programs began to replace these conscripts after that date. (Bilstein, 1998, p.13).
