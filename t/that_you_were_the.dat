5|$|From {{the very}} beginning, {{from the first}} moment I may almost say, of my {{acquaintance}} with you, your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form that the groundwork of disapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike. And I had not known you a month before I felt <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> last {{man in the world}} whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.|$|E
500|$|Between {{the late}} 16th and the 18th centuries, [...] was a common, coarse synonym for prostitute; William Shakespeare used it with that meaning in The Merry Wives of Windsor (1602) and Measure for Measure (1603-4, {{published}} 1623 in First Folio). The term eventually came to describe [...] "a young male hustler, a gangster, a hoodlum, or a ruffian". As Legs McNeil explains, [...] "On TV, if you watched cop shows, Kojak, Baretta, when the cops finally catch the mass murderer, they'd say, 'you dirty Punk.' It was what your teachers would call you. It meant <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> lowest." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another person, , Great Coyote, {{was formed}} in the water. He told First Man and First Woman {{that he had been}} hatched from an egg, and knew all that was under the water and all that was in the skies. First Man {{believed}} him. Then a second coyote, , First Angry, appeared. He said to the three, [...] "You believe <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> first persons. You are mistaken. I was living when you were formed." [...] First Angry brought witchcraft into the world.|$|E
5000|$|Journalists in Pakistan asked Shahi,"Many believe <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> Mehdi, and God has {{revealed}} signs unto them which say <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> Mehdi, but <b>you</b> do not officially announce <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> Mehdi. Why?" [...] Shahi gestured towards himself and answered, [...] "Does Imam Mehdi {{not know the}} law of Pakistan? He knows that the law of Pakistan declares that 'whosoever claims to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> Mehdi, put him in jail'. I have given the signs of his Mehdi's characteristics, which the Mehdi knows and none other. Now, {{it is up to}} people to recognise him and believe him".|$|R

2500|$|The {{sense of}} agency (SA), or sense of control, is the {{subjective}} awareness of initiating, executing, and controlling one's own volitional {{actions in the}} world. It is the pre-reflective awareness or implicit sense that it is I who is executing bodily movement(s) or thinking thoughts. In normal, non-pathological experience, the SA is tightly integrated with one's [...] "sense of ownership" [...] (SO), which is the pre-reflective awareness or implicit sense that one {{is the owner of}} an action, movement or thought. If someone else were to move your arm (while you remained passive) you would certainly have sensed that it were your arm that moved and thus a sense of ownership (SO) for that movement. However, you would not have felt <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> author of the movement; you would not have a sense of agency (SA).|$|E
2500|$|Furtwängler's {{name was}} {{included}} on the Gottbegnadeten list ("God-gifted List") of September 1944, but was removed on December 7, 1944 because of his relationships with German resistance. Furtwängler had strong links to the German resistance which organized the 20 July plot. He stated during his denazification trial that he knew an attack was being organized against Hitler, {{although he did not}} participate in its organization. He knew Claus von Stauffenberg very well and his doctor, Johannes Ludwig Schmitt, who wrote him many false health prescriptions to bypass official requirements, {{was a member of the}} Kreisau Circle. Furtwängler's concerts were sometimes chosen by the members of the German resistance as a meeting point. Rudolf Pechel, a member of the resistance group which organized the 20 July plot said to Furtwängler after the war: [...] "In the circle of our resistance movement it was an accepted fact <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> only one in the whole of our musical world who really resisted, and you were one of us." [...] Graf Kaunitz, also a member of that circle, stated: [...] "In Furtwängler's concerts we were one big family of the resistance." ...|$|E
