5|$|At the 30 Rock studios, Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) and Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan), {{the stars}} of TGS, decide {{they want to help}} the sick crew. They think about getting the crew soup but are too lazy to do it; instead they decide that {{laughter}} is the best medicine. Jenna and Tracy, dressed as clowns, put on a very unsuccessful show at the TGS stage where they end up throwing a pie on Liz's face. The crew stands up for Liz until they see the red dot where she received the shot. She confesses that she chose <b>the</b> <b>vacation</b> over the crew, as she later was told by Cerie that the hotel had rooms available, which results in the crew hating her for it.|$|E

25|$|It {{appears that}} the Singapore Government {{inclines}} towards a discretionary rather than rules-based approach {{when it comes to}} by-election decisions. In support of this, Halimah has argued that the interests of minority communities are protected so long as other minority MPs are present. In her view, allowing by-elections to be triggered by minority members vacating their GRC seats will undermine the concept on which GRC is premised. Furthermore, the system was also designed to prevent an MP holding his or her GRC to ransom. If by-elections had to follow <b>the</b> <b>vacation</b> of every minority seat, minority MPs would possess significant power in determining the fates of GRCs.|$|E

This proposal also included <b>the</b> <b>vacation</b> of the Five Mile Bridge from the state system and the creation of a connector road between US 22 and SR 555, then called County Road 719 (now State Route 719).

In late 2011 and May 2012, press reports indicated a rebound in tourism, aided by BP advertising dollars and concurrent with a nationwide rise in hotel occupancy rates.

25|$|Following the {{dissolution}} of the Soviet Union in 1991, Yalta has struggled economically. Many of the nouveaux riches of ex-Soviet citizens began going to other European holiday resorts, now that they had the freedom and money to travel; conversely, the impoverishment of many ex-Soviet citizens meant that they could no longer afford to go to Yalta. The town's transport links have been significantly reduced with the end of almost all passenger traffic by sea. The longest trolleybus line in Europe goes from the train station in Simferopol to Yalta (almost 90km).
