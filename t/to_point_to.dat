5|$|Bristol {{was made}} a city in 1542, with the former Abbey of St Augustine {{becoming}} Bristol Cathedral, following the Dissolution of the Monasteries by Henry VIII. The Dissolution also saw the surrender to the king of all of Bristol's friaries and monastic hospitals, together with StJames' Priory, StMary Magdalen nunnery, a Cistercian abbey at Kingswood and the College at Westbury on Trym. In {{the case of the}} friaries at Greyfriars and Whitefriars, the priors had fled before the arrival of the royal commissioners, and at Whitefriars a succession of departing priors had plundered the friary of its valuables. Although the commissioners had not been able <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> as much religious malpractice in Bristol as elsewhere, there is no record of Bristolians raising any objections to the royal seizures. In 1541 Bristol's civic leaders took the opportunity of buying up lands and properties formerly belonging to StMark's Hospital, StMary Magdalen, Greyfriars and Whitefriars for a total of a thousand pounds. Bristol thereby became the only municipality in the country which has its own chapel, at StMark's.|$|E
5|$|In August2007, Frank Beamer closed team {{practices}} to outside observers {{for the first}} time in 20years. He cited concerns about unknown individuals watching Virginia Tech practice in Atlanta before the Hokies' loss to Georgia, potentially leading to the defeat. During the 2007season, Virginia Tech quarterback Sean Glennon was replaced as the Hokies' starter by freshman Tyrod Taylor, causing many pundits <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> the four interceptions Glennon threw in the Chick-fil-A Bowl as an example of his failure as a quarterback. Brian Mimbs, the former walk-on who kicked and recovered the onside kick that began Georgia's rally was named the Bulldogs' starting punter for the 2007 season, partially due to his performance in the Chick-fil-A Bowl.|$|E

5|$|Named to the {{advisory}} group chosen {{to support the}} review board, Shea threw himself into the investigation, working eighty-hour weeks. Although the precise source of ignition was never found, {{it soon became clear}} that an electrical short somewhere in the command module had started the fire, probably sparked by a chafed wire. What was less clear was where to apportion responsibility. NASA engineers tended <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> what they saw as shoddy workmanship by North American Aviation. By contrast, North American executives blamed NASA management for its decision over their objections to pressurize the command module with pure oxygen to a pressure far in excess of that needed in space, in which almost any materialincluding Velcro, with which the cabin was filledwould instantly burst into flames if exposed to a spark. Whatever the precise distribution of responsibility, Shea remained haunted by the feeling that he, personally, was responsible for the deaths of three astronauts. For years after the fire, he displayed the portrait given to him by the Apollo 1 crew in the front hallway of his own home.|$|E
5|$|Parkinson's {{disease is}} a {{progressive}} neurological condition in which dysarthria may develop later in the progression of the disease. Some individuals eventually lose all functional speech. AAC approaches are generally used to supplement and support natural speech. A portable amplifier, for example, {{may be used to}} increase the volume of speech and thus its intelligibility. The individual may be taught <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> the first letter of each word they say on an alphabet board, leading to a reduced speech rate and visual cues for the listener to compensate for impaired articulation. Entire words can be spelled out if necessary. In users that have reduced range and speed of movement, a smaller than usual selection display may be preferred. High-tech AAC keyboard speech-generating devices are also used; keyguards may be required to prevent accidental keystrokes caused by the tremor typical of the disease. Factors affecting AAC use in Parkinson's disease include motor deficits and cognitive changes; the latter may result in unawareness of their problems with spoken communication.|$|E

25|$|Attempts {{have been}} made to promote isospin from a global to a local symmetry. In 1954, Chen Ning Yang and Robert Mills {{suggested}} that the notion of protons and neutrons, which are continuously rotated into each other by isospin, should be allowed to vary from point <b>to</b> <b>point.</b> <b>To</b> describe this, the proton and neutron direction in isospin space must be defined at every point, giving local basis for isospin.

25|$|Autotopagnosia {{typically}} occurs after left parietal lesions. Patients {{with this}} disorder make errors which result from confusion between adjacent body parts. For example, a patient may point to their knee when asked <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> their hip. Because the disorder involves the body schema, localization errors {{may be made}} both on the patient’s own body and that of others. The spatial unity of the body within the body schema has been damaged such that it has incorrectly been segmented in relation to its other modular parts.|$|E
