5|$|Another {{major change}} was {{the arrival of}} foods from the Americas in Early Modern times (around the sixteenth century), notably the {{incorporation}} of the potato into Northern European cuisine, and the eager adoption of <b>the</b> <b>tomato</b> into Mediterranean cuisine. <b>The</b> <b>tomato,</b> so central now to that cuisine, was first described in print by Pietro Andrea Mattioli in 1544. Similarly, many of the species of Phaseolus beans now used around the Mediterranean, including P. vulgaris (the French or haricot bean), were brought back from the Americas by Spanish and Portuguese explorers.|$|E
5|$|Helicoverpa zea, {{commonly}} known as the corn earworm, is a species (formerly in the genus Heliothis) in the family Noctuidae. The larva of the moth Helicoverpa zea is a major agricultural pest. Since it is polyphagous (feeds on many different plants) during the larval stage, the species has been given many different common names, including the cotton bollworm and <b>the</b> <b>tomato</b> fruitworm. It also consumes a wide variety of other crops.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Fox was {{the second}} most intense {{hurricane}} to strike Cuba until Hurricane Michelle in the 2001 Atlantic hurricane season. It was originally {{believed to have been}} the second Category4 hurricane in Cuba prior to the Atlantic hurricane reanalysis. At the time, the cyclone produced the fourth lowest pressure in a landfalling Cuban hurricane; only the 1917, 1924, and 1932 hurricanes were more intense. Hurricane Fox killed at least 40people across the island, causing severe crop damages in rural areas. The hurricane also ruined 30 percent of <b>the</b> <b>tomato</b> crops on Eleuthera in the Bahamas. Across the archipelago, Fox produced wind gusts in excess of 110mph (175km/h). Total damages reached $10million in Cuba. Fox {{was the second}} hurricane to land during the season, after Hurricane Able struck South Carolina.|$|E
30|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a {{complete}} system to monitor <b>the</b> growth of <b>tomatoes</b> from images acquired in open fields. This is a challenging task because of the severe occlusion and poor contrast in the images. We approximate <b>the</b> <b>tomatoes</b> by spheres in the 3 D space, hence by ellipses in the image space. <b>The</b> <b>tomatoes</b> are first identified in the images using a segmentation procedure. Then, the size of <b>the</b> <b>tomatoes</b> is measured from the obtained segmentation and camera parameters. The shape information combined with temporal information, given the limited evolution from an image to the next one, is used throughout the system to increase the robustness with respect to occlusion and poor contrast.|$|R

5|$|Many thrips are pests of {{commercial}} crops {{due to the}} damage caused by feeding on developing flowers or vegetables, causing discoloration, deformities, and reduced marketability of the crop. Some thrips serve as vectors for plant diseases, such as tospoviruses. Over 20 plant-infecting viruses are known to be transmitted by thrips, but perversely, less than a dozen of the described species are known to vector tospoviruses. These enveloped viruses are considered among some of the most damaging of emerging plant pathogens around the world, with those vector species having an outsized impact on human agriculture. Virus members include <b>the</b> <b>tomato</b> spotted wilt virus and the impatiens necrotic spot viruses. The western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis, has spread until it now has a worldwide distribution, and is the primary vector of plant diseases caused by tospoviruses. Their small size and predisposition towards enclosed places makes them difficult to detect by phytosanitary inspection, while their eggs, laid inside plant tissue, are well-protected from pesticide sprays. When coupled with the increasing globalization of trade and the growth of greenhouse agriculture, thrips, unsurprisingly, are among the fastest growing group of invasive species in the world. Examples include F. occidentalis, Thrips simplex, and Thrips palmi.|$|E
5|$|The eyes of most frogs {{are located}} {{on either side of}} the head near the top and project {{outwards}} as hemispherical bulges. They provide binocular vision over a field of 100° to the front and a total visual field of almost 360°. They may be the only part of an otherwise submerged frog to protrude from the water. Each eye has closable upper and lower lids and a nictitating membrane which provides further protection, especially when the frog is swimming. Members of the aquatic family Pipidae have the eyes located at the top of the head, a position better suited for detecting prey in the water above. The irises come in a range of colours and the pupils in a range of shapes. The common toad (Bufo bufo) has golden irises and horizontal slit-like pupils, the red-eyed tree frog (Agalychnis callidryas) has vertical slit pupils, the poison dart frog has dark irises, the fire-bellied toad (Bombina spp.) has triangular pupils and <b>the</b> <b>tomato</b> frog (Dyscophus spp.) has circular ones. The irises of the southern toad (Anaxyrus terrestris) are patterned so as to blend in with the surrounding camouflaged skin.|$|E
