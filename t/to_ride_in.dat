5|$|Considering that he {{majored in}} {{political}} science and economics, Kanō's family thought that after graduating from university, he would pursue a career in some government ministry. Indeed, through influential friends of his father's, he was initially offered a position with the Ministry of Finance. However, his love for teaching led him instead to accept a position teaching at Gakushuin. The students of Japan's elite attended Gakushuin and were of higher social positions than their teachers. The students were allowed <b>to</b> <b>ride</b> <b>in</b> rickshaws (jinrikisha) right to {{the doors of the}} classes, whereas teachers were forbidden. The teachers often felt compelled to visit the homes of these students whenever summoned to give instruction or advice. In effect, the teachers were treated as servants.|$|E
5|$|Euskaltel-Euskadi has {{in their}} history been reticent to ride the Giro d'Italia, favoring the Tour de France and the Vuelta a España instead. After first {{indicating}} a reluctant willingness to participate as per the requirements of holding a ProTeam license, the team later stated that they intended to seek overall victory in the race with Antón. Antón was named {{as the leader of}} the squad, which included Nieve, Oroz, Isasi, Aramendía, Azanza, Cazaux, Sesma and Minguez <b>to</b> <b>ride</b> <b>in</b> support. Antón tempered the expectations somewhat, saying that a stage win would be nice, as would General Classification success should it come, but that he was only banking on riding for the overall at the Vuelta a España.|$|E
5|$|George's {{marriage}} to Sophia Dorothea was dissolved, {{not on the}} grounds that either of them had committed adultery, but {{on the grounds that}} Sophia Dorothea had abandoned her husband. With the agreement of her father, George had Sophia Dorothea imprisoned in Ahlden House in her native Celle, where she stayed until she died more than thirty years later. She was denied access to her children and father, forbidden to remarry and only allowed to walk unaccompanied within the mansion courtyard. She was, however, endowed with an income, establishment, and servants, and was allowed <b>to</b> <b>ride</b> <b>in</b> a carriage outside her castle, albeit under supervision. Melusine von der Schulenburg acted as George's hostess openly from 1698 until his death, and they had three daughters together, born in 1692, 1693 and 1701, respectively.|$|E

She was aged only 19 and it was only her fifth ride on a racecourse. She rode a horse called Bold King's Hussar, bred by her grandad and {{finished}} fourteenth.

5|$|In 1907, Georges Passerieu {{broke away}} from a small leading group just before Douai because he knew he couldn't outsprint them if they all {{finished}} together. He was chased {{all the way to}} Roubaix by a Belgian, Cyrille van Hauwaert, and tension in the velodrome was high. The crowd heard that Passerieu had reached the stadium but nobody rode on to the track. The leader was just about <b>to</b> <b>ride</b> <b>in</b> when a gendarme stepped into his path to check if his bicycle had the obligatory tax plate attached to it. Passerieu had already had a hard day and a shouting match broke out before he was allowed to continue.|$|E

Despite an effort by Seward to prompt a change of mind, he spent the morning of March 4 finishing last-minute business, and then shortly after noon rode from the White House to the home of a friend.|$|E
5|$|The 2015 race {{consisted}} of six stages. It started in Dukhan on 8 February 2015 and finished on 13 February in Doha, {{the capital city}} of Qatar. The Tour of Qatar puts unusual demands on riders: it has no significant climbs, but almost every stage is affected by strong crosswinds. These conditions make the race ideal preparation for the spring classics season, so many prominent classics riders were present. The flat stages, suitable for sprinters, and individual time trial meant that specialists in these disciplines also chose <b>to</b> <b>ride</b> <b>in</b> Qatar.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, {{a backup}} relief party of 77 teams and wagons was {{making its way}} east to provide {{additional}} assistance to the Martin Company. After passing Fort Bridger {{the leaders of the}} backup party concluded that the Martin Company must have wintered east of the Rockies, so they turned back. When word of the returning backup relief party was communicated to Young, he ordered the courier to return and tell them to turn back east and continue until they found the handcart company, but several days had been lost. On November 18 the backup party met the Martin Company with the greatly needed supplies. At last {{all the members of the}} handcart party were now able <b>to</b> <b>ride</b> <b>in</b> wagons. The 104 wagons carrying the Martin Company arrived in Salt Lake City on November 30; at least 145 members of the company had lost their lives. Many of the survivors had to have fingers, toes, or limbs amputated due to severe frostbite.|$|E
5|$|O'Connor has {{competed in}} five Olympic Games, {{representing}} the US team at all five and also riding {{as an individual}} at three. At the 1988 Summer Olympics, riding The Optimist, she posted a DNF (did not finish) in both the team and individual portions. At the 1996 Summer Olympics, riding Biko, she and the US team rode to a silver medal. At the 2000 Summer Olympics, riding Prince Panache, O'Connor and the US team again took a medal, this time bronze. O'Connor did not ride as an individual at either the 1996 or the 2000 events. In the 2008 Summer Games, riding Mandiba, she placed 44th individually, while the US team took 7th. O'Connor was not originally scheduled <b>to</b> <b>ride</b> <b>in</b> the 2008 Games, but was moved to a competition spot in July 2008 when teammate Heidi White was forced to withdraw. Four years later, at the 2012 Summer Games, the US team repeated their placing, while O'Connor improved to 9th, riding Mr. Medicott. Her 9th place finish was the highest rank achieved by a US equestrian at the 2012 Games. O'Connor was the oldest Olympian to represent the US in any sport at the 2012 Games.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of November 1, 1824, Desha {{attended}} a celebration at a neighbor's house. He later stayed the night at Doggate's Tavern in Fairview, just over the county line in Fleming County. The next morning, he ate breakfast at the tavern, joined by eight other men, including Francis Baker. Editor of the Mississippian newspaper in Natchez, Baker was returning to his hometown of Trenton, New Jersey to marry a young woman there. Over breakfast, Baker mentioned wanting to visit a friend, Captain John Bickley, {{who lived in the}} area. Desha remarked that he knew where Bickley lived and, intending <b>to</b> <b>ride</b> <b>in</b> that direction, asked if Baker wanted to join him. Baker accepted, and the two men left about 8 a.m. toward Maysville. Desha rode his bay mare and Baker his gray mare, a fine horse that had already attracted much attention during his travel through Kentucky.|$|E

5|$|Saddlebreds are {{popularly known}} as show horses, with horses being shown saddle seat in both three-gaited and five-gaited classes. The former are the three common gaits seen in most breeds, the walk, trot and canter. The latter {{includes}} the three regular gaits, plus two four-beat ambling gaits known as the slow gait and the rack. The slow gait today is a four-beat gait in which the lateral pairs of legs leave the ground together, but strike the ground at different times, the hind foot connecting slightly before the forefoot. In the show ring, the gait should be performed with restraint and precision. The rack is also a four-beat gait, but with equal intervals between each footfall, making it a smooth gait <b>to</b> <b>ride.</b> <b>In</b> the show ring, the gait is performed with speed and action, appearing unrestrained. Historically, the slow gait could be either a running walk, the stepping pace, or the fox trot, however, the modern five-gaited Saddlebred usually performs the stepping pace.|$|E
