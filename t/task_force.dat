The <b>Task</b> <b>Force</b> 11, <b>Task</b> <b>Force</b> 121, <b>Task</b> <b>Force</b> 6-26 and <b>Task</b> <b>Force</b> 145 are creations of the Pentagon's post-11 September campaign against terrorism, and it quickly became the model for how the military would gain intelligence and battle insurgents in the future. Originally known as <b>Task</b> <b>Force</b> 121, it was formed {{in the summer of}} 2003, when the military merged two existing Special Operations units, one hunting Osama bin Laden in and around Afghanistan, and the other tracking Sadaam Hussein in Iraq.|$|E
5|$|A North Korean {{tank column}} {{equipped}} with ex-Soviet T-34/85 tanks overran the <b>task</b> <b>force</b> {{in the first}} encounter and continued its advance south. After the North Korean tank column had breached U.S. lines the <b>Task</b> <b>Force</b> opened fire on a force of some 5,000 North Korean infantry approaching its position, temporarily holding up the North Korean advance. North Korean troops eventually flanked and overwhelmed American positions and {{the remnants of the}} <b>task</b> <b>force</b> retreated in disorder.|$|E

5|$|For MacArthur's long-awaited {{return to}} the Philippines in October 1944, the Seventh Fleet was massively {{reinforced}} by Nimitz's Pacific Fleet. Kinkaid commanded the assault personally, with Barbey's VII Amphibious Force as <b>Task</b> <b>Force</b> 78, joined by Vice Admiral Theodore S. Wilkinson's III Amphibious Force from the Pacific Fleet as <b>Task</b> <b>Force</b> 79. Kinkaid was also given Rear Admiral Jesse B. Oldendorf's <b>Task</b> <b>Force</b> 77.2, a bombardment force built around six old battleships that had survived the attack on Pearl Harbor, and Rear Admiral Thomas L. Sprague's <b>Task</b> <b>Force</b> 77.4, a force of escort carriers. However, Vice Admiral Marc Mitscher's <b>Task</b> <b>Force</b> 38, the covering force of the fast carriers and battleships, remained part of Admiral Halsey's Third Fleet, which was not under MacArthur or Kinkaid's command.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to save Lộc Ninh, Brigadier General Lê Văn Hưng — {{commander}} of the ARVN 5th Infantry Division — ordered <b>Task</b> <b>Force</b> 52 to move north to reinforce the beleaguered 9th Infantry Regiment. <b>Task</b> <b>Force</b> 52 consisted of the 2nd Battalion, 52nd Infantry Regiment, and the 1st Battalion, 48th Infantry Regiment; both units had been transferred from the ARVN 18th Infantry Division in late March {{to serve as a}} border screen for General Hưng's forces. Lieutenant Colonel Nguyễn Bá Thinh — commander of <b>Task</b> <b>Force</b> 52 — ordered the 2nd Battalion to advance towards Lộc Ninh. The unit was ambushed at the junction of National Highway 13 and Route 17. Unable to withstand the Viet Cong's superior firepower, it was forced to withdraw. To prevent <b>Task</b> <b>Force</b> 52 from evacuating to either Lộc Ninh or An Lộc, the Viet Cong pursued <b>Task</b> <b>Force</b> 52 and bombarded their bases with heavy artillery throughout the day.|$|E
5|$|Kinkaid was {{detached}} {{with the}} cruisers Astoria, Minneapolis and New Orleans, and four destroyers on 11 May 1942 and sailed for Nouméa, while Fletcher took {{the rest of}} <b>Task</b> <b>Force</b> 17 to Tongatapu. Kinkaid then headed north to join the Vice Admiral William F. Halsey's <b>Task</b> <b>Force</b> 16. Kinkaid's force became part of its screen which was {{under the command of}} Rear Admiral Raymond A. Spruance. Shortly after <b>Task</b> <b>Force</b> 16 returned to Pearl Harbor, Halsey was hospitalized with a severe case of dermatitis and, on his recommendation, was replaced as commander of <b>Task</b> <b>Force</b> 16 by Spruance. Kinkaid then became commander of the screen, also known as Task Group 16.2. He was one of only four American flag officers present during the subsequent Battle of Midway. However, he saw little action, as <b>Task</b> <b>Force</b> 16 did not come under attack.|$|E

The 1st Provisional Marine Brigade surged forward to Pansong, quickly inflicting 350 {{casualties}} on the North Koreans as it overran the North Korean 6th Division's headquarters. The other {{units of the}} <b>Task</b> <b>Force,</b> however, were slowed by North Korean resistance. <b>Task</b> <b>Force</b> Kean pressed on the Chindong-ni area, resulting in a confused battle where the fragmented force {{had to rely on}} air strikes and airdrops to keep it effective. <b>Task</b> <b>Force</b> Kean's offensive had collided with one being delivered simultaneously by the North Korean 6th Division.|$|E

5|$|As of January 1945, the Third Fleet {{was built}} around the Fast Carrier <b>Task</b> <b>Force,</b> which was the main US Navy strike force in the Pacific. Control of this force alternated at regular {{intervals}} between the Third and Fifth Fleets (commanded by Halsey and Admiral Raymond A. Spruance respectively), with its designation also changing from <b>Task</b> <b>Force</b> 38 to <b>Task</b> <b>Force</b> 58. As <b>Task</b> <b>Force</b> 38 it was commanded by Vice Admiral John S. McCain Sr. In January 1945 <b>Task</b> <b>Force</b> 38 was organized into three fast carrier task groups and a night carrier group. The fast carrier groups were Task Group 38.1 with four aircraft carriers, two battleships, six cruisers and 25 destroyers, Task Group 38.2 with four carriers, three battleships, five cruisers and 24 destroyers and Task Group 38.3 which comprised four carriers, three battleships, five cruisers and 17 destroyers. The night carrier group, Task Group 38.5, had two carriers and six destroyers, and operated with Task Group 38.2 during the day. These carrier groups embarked around 900 aircraft in total. The other major element of the fleet was a logistics element designated Task Group 30.8 which comprised a varying number of tankers and ammunition ships, several escort carriers which transported replacement aircraft for <b>Task</b> <b>Force</b> 38 {{and a large number}} of escorting destroyers. In addition, the fleet was assigned an anti-submarine hunter-killer force designated Task Group 30.7 which was equipped with an escort carrier and three destroyer escorts and typically operated in support of Task Group 30.8.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{the earlier}} UN defeat at the Battle of Unsan, the US 25th Infantry Division {{expected}} to encounter heavy Chinese resistance during its advance. But the Chinese screening forces withdrew with the American advance. Aside from the harassing fire, the US 25th Infantry Division did not encounter strong resistance along the way. Ipsok was captured by <b>Task</b> <b>Force</b> Dolvin on November 24, and several American POWs from the Unsan battle were also recovered at the town. When <b>Task</b> <b>Force</b> Dolvin proceeded to capture a series of hills north of Ipsok on the next day, Chinese resistance started to stiffen.
