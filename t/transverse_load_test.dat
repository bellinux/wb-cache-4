The project team, managed by Steven Winter Associates, Inc., a Norwalk, Connecticut-based building systems research and consulting firm included: Thermal Foams, Inc., a Buffalo-based manufacturer of EPS products; BASF Corp., the world`s largest producer of EPS beads; Oak Ridge National Laboratory, which performed thermal tests (ASTM C- 518); RADCO, Inc. which performed material properties tests: density (ASTM C- 303), flexural strength (ASTM C- 203), tensile strength (ASTM D- 1623), and <b>transverse</b> <b>load</b> <b>test</b> of SIPs panels (ASTM E- 72). The report documents the manufacturing and testing process and concludes that there was relatively little difference in the thermal and structural characteristics under normal loading conditions of the panels tested with varying amount of regrind (from 10 % - 25 %) and those made with 100 % virgin beads. The report recommends that additional tests be undertaken, but suggests that, based on the test results, reground EPS can be successfully used in the cores of SIPs in amounts up to 25 %...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a {{recently}} developed revolutionary approach to material characterization for {{application to the}} development of advanced composite materials is presented. A methodology of fiber-matrix interface characterization has been recently developed based on the shear back reflectivity technique. This new methodology uses ultrasonic waves to nondestructively evaluate the interfacial elastic properties at a localized level. This new approach is nondestructive in nature in contrast to traditional destructive characterization techniques which are costly, time consuming, tedious and which also render the samples unusable for other experiments. Based on this interface characterization methodology, an original, unique, innovative method of imaging fiber microcracking has been developed to augment standard experiments such as fiber fragmentation, <b>transverse</b> <b>loading,</b> fiber-push <b>tests,</b> etc., conducted by scientists developing advanced composites. This provides critical information to materials researchers for micro-mechanics modeling studies to evaluate fracture and fatigue behavior of composites. Further, the methodology is used to assist and enhance the traditional experiments such as fiber fragmentation tests for interfacial shear load transfer behavior studies, fiber push tests for interfacial factional and fracture behavior studies, <b>transverse</b> <b>loading</b> <b>tests</b> for interfacial stress at fracture, etc. Thus, the nondestructive ultrasonic technique has been shown here to extend the horizons of material behavior studies by providing new information obtained during in situ testing or in an interrupted mode. Moreover, the new technique alleviate the need for traditional destructive characterization work such as optical metallography. The entirely new information provided by this breakthrough technique is now extensively used by materials behavior groups at the WL / Materials Directorate (WL/ML) for determination of the basic mechanisms of damage in composites to improve both the processing and the reliability of the experimental characterization of the materials...|$|R

Minimums were also established for adhesives and foam density. Using these industry-developed minimum properties for panels, adhesives and foam density, APA ran a series of tests on SIPs manufactured to reflect these minimums with an expanded polystyrene foam core. Tests included shear, axial, transverse, and SIPS lintel testing and results are published in APA Report No. T 2006 P- 33 and formed the basis for a series of prescriptive use requirements for a code change proposal for the International Residential Code.

40|$|The {{elevated}} temperature interfacial properties of continuous SiC fiber reinforced Ti matrix composites, primarily SCS- 6 /Timetal- 21 S, {{have been examined}} in the tangential and normal direction in this experimental/numerical study. An {{elevated temperature}} fiber pushout apparatus has been built and {{used to test the}} interfacial shear strength and frictional shear stress at various temperatures. It was found that as temperature increases, tangential interface properties decrease, but the debonding behavior changes for test temperatures above 400 °C. Additionally, <b>transverse</b> <b>loading</b> <b>tests</b> have shown a similar decrease in normal separation stress with increasing temperature. It was found that thermal exposure in vacuum for temperatures up to 650 °C results in no noticeable increase in the interphase size, composition, or interphase strength properties. Aging in air causes a degradation of the interphase, resulting in deterioration of interphase properties, particularly at higher temperatures. The effect of variation of processing conditions, including variation of fiber volume fraction and of the time-temperature-pressure profile during consolidation, has been examined using concentric cylinder numerical model, and compared to experimental test results. Results show that the processing conditions required for full consolidation allow little variation in the composite stress state. An increase in fiber volume fraction increases the interfacial shear stress at all temperatures, with the most noticeable difference at room temperature, as well as a change in the characteristics of fiber pushout curves. Using interface properties, composite failure maps have been established for this material that describe the dominant failure mode as a function of temperature and stress intensity factor during loading. For reasonable use temperatures, the boundary between fiber bridging and interface debonding occurs at decreasing Kmax with increasing temperature. Interface debonding behavior, in terms of the cohesive zone model parameters of maximum traction, maximum separation and cohesive energy, in both the normal and tangential direction, has been established for the MMC composite system SCS- 6 /Timetal- 21 S, for temperatures from 23 to 650 °C. The numerical model yields good agreement with experimental results. For both normal and tangential decohesion, the maximum traction, Tmax, decreases with increasing temperature, while the characteristic length, δ, and work of fracture, 2 ̆ 6 phis;, increase with increasing temperature. ...|$|R
