40|$|We applied {{predicted}} {{vital capacity}} to chest size matching between {{donor and recipient}} in lung transplantation to 15 single-lung transplant recipients with pulmonary fibrosis and to 20 double-lung transplant recipients with emphysema or non-emphysema. <b>The</b> predicted <b>vital</b> capacity of <b>the</b> donor was significantly correlated with <b>the</b> predicted <b>vital</b> capacity of <b>the</b> recipient both in double-lung transplantation (r = 0. 79, p = 0. 001) and single-lung transplantation (r = 0. 71, p = 0. 003). In double-lung transplantation, <b>the</b> post-transplant <b>vital</b> capacity was correlated with <b>the</b> predicted <b>vital</b> capacity of <b>the</b> recipient (r = 0. 74, p = 0. 002). Emphysema patients and non-emphysema patients contributed equally to this correlation. In left single lung transplantation, there was a weak correlation between <b>the</b> post-transplant <b>vital</b> capacity and <b>the</b> predicted <b>vital</b> capacity of <b>the</b> donor in the allograft (r = 0. 57, p = 0. 1095).

In double-lung transplantation, <b>the</b> post-transplant <b>vital</b> capacity was limited by the recipient's normal thoracic volume and was not influenced by underlying pulmonary disease. In single-lung transplantation with pulmonary fibrosis, the allograft transplanted in the left chest could expand to its own size, and the allograft transplanted in the right chest could expand to the recipient's normal thoracic volume as in double-lung transplantation...|$|R

5|$|Amphibians and {{reptiles}} {{were strongly}} {{affected by the}} Carboniferous rainforest collapse (CRC), an extinction event that occurred ~307 million years ago. The Carboniferous period has long been associated with thick, steamy swamps and humid rainforests. Since plants form the base of almost all of Earth's ecosystems, any changes in plant distribution have always affected animal life to some degree. The sudden collapse of <b>the</b> <b>vital</b> rainforest ecosystem profoundly affected the diversity and abundance of the major tetrapod groups that relied on it. The CRC, which {{was a part of}} one of the top two most devastating plant extinctions in Earth's history, was a self-reinforcing and very rapid change of environment wherein the worldwide climate became much drier and cooler overall (although much new work is being done to better understand the fine-grained historical climate changes in the Carboniferous-Permian transition and how they arose).|$|E

5|$|Chemicals {{released}} by macrophages can also damage host tissue. TNF-α {{is an important}} chemical that is {{released by}} macrophages that causes the blood in small vessels to clot to prevent an infection from spreading. However, if a bacterial infection spreads to the blood, TNF-α is released into vital organs, which can cause vasodilation {{and a decrease in}} plasma volume; these in turn can be followed by septic shock. During septic shock, TNF-α release causes a blockage of the small vessels that supply blood to <b>the</b> <b>vital</b> organs, and the organs may fail. Septic shock can lead to death.|$|E

5|$|Kesselring {{strove to}} organise and protect supply convoys {{in order to}} get the German-Italian Panzer Army the {{resources}} it needed.

Without <b>the</b> <b>vital</b> supplies they carried, particularly fuel, the Axis forces in North Africa could not conduct operations. Through various expedients, Kesselring managed to deliver an increased flow of supplies to Generaloberst Erwin Rommel's Afrika Korps in Libya. With his forces thus strengthened, Rommel prepared an attack on the British positions around Gazala, while Kesselring planned Operation Herkules, an airborne and seaborne attack on Malta with the 185 Airborne Division Folgore and Ramcke Parachute Brigade.
