Cook, who had worked on previous halftime shows, understood the details and guided the team. Drawings of the performances depicted what was expected for each setup, with the volunteers assembling the stage in segments and moving them to the field with carts. Madonna's entrance had to be rehearsed several times for coordination. Although Cook learned during the game that the New England Patriots were scheduled to exit on the route used by volunteers carrying the stage equipment, he resolved the issue by talking with the team.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{computer}} aided {{process planning}} (CAPP) is bridge between {{computer aided design}} (CAD) and computer aided manufacturing (CAM). Setup planning {{is one of the}} important tasks in the computer aided process planning. Setup planning consists of identification of tool approach direction (TAD), clustering the manufacturing features based on shared TAD and tolerance relations among <b>the</b> features, <b>setup</b> sequencing between <b>the</b> <b>setups</b> and operation sequencing within <b>the</b> <b>setups.</b> This paper mainly focuses on setup sequencing such that cycle precedence (conflicts between <b>the</b> <b>setups)</b> is resolved. There are most likely chances to occur cycle precedence between <b>the</b> <b>setups</b> at time of setup formation. We use an expert system (knowledge based approach) to avoid such conflicts by break down <b>the</b> <b>setups</b> into smaller <b>setups</b> with <b>the</b> minimum violation of tolerance relations. This approach gives optimal setup plan that is minimum number of setups without any cycle conflicts followed by fixture planning...|$|R

30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  6 for the WCT, {{initially}} prototype SCOPE uses <b>the</b> Cassandra-X deployment <b>setup</b> for write operations and <b>the</b> Cassandra-Y deployment <b>setup</b> is inactive (i.e., the write latency of <b>the</b> Cassandra-Y deployment <b>setup</b> is 0). Then, when <b>the</b> Cassandra-X deployment <b>setup</b> is stressed with the write-heavy workload (starting {{at the time}} scale of 20 min) and the latency has increased from 0.02 to 0.05 ms (at time interval between 30 and 38 min), which exceeds the specified threshold value (i.e., 0.04 ms), the SCOPE middleware observes this behavior of <b>the</b> deployment <b>setup</b> and starts redirecting all write operation requests to <b>the</b> Cassandra-Y deployment <b>setup</b> (satisfy R 1 discussed in Section 2.3). However, as shown in Fig.  6, the latency of <b>the</b> Cassandra-X deployment <b>setup</b> keeps on increasing even after SCOPE switches to <b>the</b> Cassandra-Y deployment <b>setup.</b> <b>The</b> increase is mainly caused by a number additional processes started to generate the write-heavy workloads on <b>the</b> Cassandra-X deployment <b>setup.</b> These additional processes are not stopped immediately after SCOPE switches to <b>the</b> Cassandra-Y deployment <b>setup.</b> As a result, the Cassandra-X deployment is stressed with write-heavy workloads even after SCOPE switches to <b>the</b> Cassandra-Y deployment <b>setup.</b>|$|R
30|$|Similarly, Fig.  7 {{shows the}} {{behavior}} of prototype SCOPE for the RCT. As for the RCT, data is replicated across the Cassandra-X and <b>the</b> Cassandra-Y deployment <b>setups</b> and is consistent, prototype SCOPE reads the data from <b>the</b> deployment <b>setup,</b> which provides lower read latency. As {{we can see that}} initially the latency of the Cassandra node deployed on <b>the</b> Cassandra-X deployment <b>setup</b> (i.e., 2.5 ms) is lower than the latency of the Cassandra node, deployed on the <b>the</b> Cassandra-Y deployment <b>setup</b> (i.e., 3.5 ms), prototype SCOPE reads data from <b>the</b> Cassandra-X deployment <b>setup.</b> However, at 10 min, <b>the</b> Cassandra-X <b>setup</b> is slowly stressed with the read-heavy workload. The read latency of the Cassandra node deployed on <b>the</b> Cassandra-X deployment <b>setup</b> has increased from 0.2 ms upto 3 ms starting at 20 min and is become higher than the read latency of the Cassandra node deployed on <b>the</b> Cassandra-Y deployment <b>setup,</b> SCOPE starts using <b>the</b> Cassandra-Y deployment <b>setup</b> to perform read requests (at the time scale of 20 min). Then, when <b>the</b> Cassandra-Y deployment <b>setup</b> is stressed with the read-heavy workload (at 25 min) and the read latency of the Cassandra node deployed on <b>the</b> Cassandra-Y deployment <b>setup</b> becomes higher than the read latency of the Cassandra node deployed on <b>the</b> Cassandra-Y deployment <b>setup,</b> <b>the</b> SCOPE middleware, at 30 min switches back to start using <b>the</b> Cassandra-X deployment <b>setup</b> (satisfy R 1 discussed in Section 2.3).|$|R

5|$|After 7.Nc3 Black has the zwischenzug 7...Qh4+ 8.g3 Bxc3+ 9.bxc3 Qe7 so {{that the}} {{diagonal}} a8–h1 is weakened before Black develops the Bc8 to the b7-square. The queen on the e7-square is well placed to pressure the e4-pawn. However, as most of Black's pieces are on the queenside, continuing with pawn pushes like f7–f5 is probably too weakening, as Alekhine demonstrated in his game against Seitz in 1925. So Black does best to attack with pieces, possibly with <b>the</b> <b>setup</b> b6/Nc5/Bb7/0-0-0. In that case Tseitlin considers that with a knight on c5 the move d7–d6 should be avoided if Black has {{to respond to the}} capture Bxc5 by dxc5, because the white pawns in e4 and f4 would have too much leeway.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the need}} for an {{improved}} CSBS was known in the 1930s, little work on developing such a sight was carried out.

Hearing of a similar development by the US Navy, the Air Ministry began extensive negotiations in an effort to gain a licence for the Norden bombsight. The Navy constantly refused these requests, based on arguments about secrecy and various political issues. As the war started, revised versions of the CSBS, the Mk. VII and Mk. IX remained universal and the Mk. X, a more extensive improvement, was in mass production and being readied for service entry.|$|E

40|$|This {{work has}} {{investigated}} how crosstalk cancelled loudspeaker reproduction of binaural sound intended for anechoic conditions {{is influenced by}} taking place under non-anechoic conditions. The scope has been limited to {{an investigation of the}} effect of early reflections on localisation for target directions in the horizontal plane. Crosstalk cancellation was implemented in software, with routines for the inversion of transfer functions, the design of crosstalk cancelling filters, filtering of sound and playback simulation. The system for crosstalk cancellation was found to give a realistic, natural and convincing reproduction of binaural signals. The effect of a single reflecting surface on a given setup for crosstalk cancelled loudspeaker playback was studied using a simplified model and playback simulation. It was found that the crosstalk cancelling filtering designed for the direct sound would not give crosstalk cancellation for the reflected sound, that the reflections in many cases were not geometrically plausible for a real source in the intended source directions, and that the interaural time difference for the reflections was nearly equal to that for a source placed at the reflecting surface. The effect of reflections delayed 5 ms and 10 ms with respect to the direct sound was investigated through listening tests. <b>The</b> playback <b>setup</b> was two Bowers & Wilkins 801 loudspeakers placed next to each other in front of the listener, at two meters distance, in an anechoic room. The reflections came from front left and front right, and were produced using reflecting surfaces. Five setups were used: Anechoic, close wall, close wall with reflection cancelling, far wall and two walls. Crosstalk cancelled binaural recordings of male and female speech from sixteen directions were used as source signals. A total of 5180 answers were collected from nine participants The listening test data were bimodally distributed due to front/back reversals. A model for statistical characterisation of such data was developed. The model describes reversed and unreversed answers independently, and may be used to find estimates for reversal rate, average perceived directions and spread for reversed and unreversed answers. The model was used to describe the listening test data. The deviation of the perceived directions from the presented directions was studied, and used to compare <b>the</b> <b>setups</b> with reflections to <b>the</b> anechoic <b>setup.</b> <b>The</b> results showed that compared to anechoic reproduction, localisation was altered for reproduction taking place under non-anechoic conditions. It was found that the deviation of the average perceived directions from the presented directions was higher for <b>the</b> <b>setups</b> with reflections than for <b>the</b> anechoic <b>setup.</b> <b>The</b> <b>setups</b> with reflections also had relatively more answers localised towards the direction of the reflection(s). <b>The</b> non-anechoic <b>setups</b> showed reversal patterns differing from those for <b>the</b> anechoic <b>setup,</b> reversal rates 11 to 30 percent higher than for <b>the</b> anechoic <b>setup,</b> and a larger fraction of answers localised to the front half plane. Generally it was found that <b>the</b> <b>setups</b> that differed most from <b>the</b> anechoic <b>setup</b> (close wall, two walls) also gave the localisation that differed most from localisation in <b>the</b> anechoic <b>setup.</b> Reflection cancelling was found to give results closer to <b>the</b> anechoic <b>setup</b> than <b>the</b> identical <b>setup</b> without reflection cancelling did...|$|R

5|$|The {{computer}} console {{explosion that}} causes the transporter malfunction was simulated using brillo pads.

Various canisters and cargo containers appear to be suspended by Anti-gravity throughout the film. These effects were executed by several of Weldon's assistants.

One fan claimed that only 270° of seating around the stage was being utilised for the three Dublin concerts, {{and that there was}} no reason that the stage could not be placed in the middle of the venue. Additional criticisms about the Croke Park shows arose from about 80 Dublin citizens, who protested against the Dublin City Council for allowing the band's crew to dismantle the stage in the middle of the night following the three concerts, due to the loud noises caused by the crew. The protest blocked several crew trucks from exiting the venue, putting the tour behind schedule, and tour promoter MCD Productions delivered a letter to the protesters informing them that they could be sued for any of the tour's financial losses due to the protest. In addition to the loudness of the band's crew, the Dublin City Council decided to withhold the band's €80,000 ($104,000) bond, after breaking the 75 decibel maximum volume at all three of the Dublin concerts.|$|E
5|$|This process, {{developed}} by Stony Brook Physics, yields francium isotopes with masses of 209, 210, and 211, {{which are then}} isolated by the magneto-optical trap (MOT). The production rate of a particular isotope depends on {{the energy of the}} oxygen beam. An 18O beam from the Stony Brook LINAC creates 210Fr in the gold target with the nuclear reaction 197Au + 18O → 210Fr + 5n. The production required some time to develop and understand. It was critical to operate the gold target very close to its melting point {{and to make sure that}} its surface was very clean. The nuclear reaction embeds the francium atoms deep in the gold target, and they must be removed efficiently. The atoms quickly diffuse to the surface of the gold target and are released as ions, but this does not happen every time. The francium ions are guided by electrostatic lenses until they land in a surface of hot yttrium and become neutral again. The francium is then injected into a glass bulb. A magnetic field and laser beams cool and confine the atoms. Although the atoms remain in the trap for only about 20 seconds before escaping (or decaying), a steady stream of fresh atoms replaces those lost, keeping the number of trapped atoms roughly constant for minutes or longer. Initially, about 1000 francium atoms were trapped in the experiment. This was gradually improved and <b>the</b> <b>setup</b> is capable of trapping over 300,000 neutral atoms of francium a time. These are neutral metallic atoms in a gaseous unconsolidated state. Enough francium is trapped that a video camera can capture the light given off by the atoms as they fluoresce. The atoms appear as a glowing sphere about 1 millimeter in diameter. This was the first time that anyone had ever seen francium. The researchers can now make extremely sensitive measurements of the light emitted and absorbed by the trapped atoms, providing the first experimental results on various transitions between atomic energy levels in francium. Initial measurements show very good agreement between experimental values and calculations based on quantum theory. Other synthesis methods include bombarding radium with neutrons, and bombarding thorium with protons, deuterons, or helium ions. Francium has not been synthesized in amounts large enough to weigh.|$|E
