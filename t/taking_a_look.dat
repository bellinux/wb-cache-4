25|$|A {{major part}} of Dahl's {{literary}} influences stemmed from his childhood. In his younger days, he was an avid reader, especially awed by fantastic tales of heroism and triumph. Amongst his favourite authors were Rudyard Kipling, Charles Dickens, William Makepeace Thackeray and Frederick Marryat, and their works went on to make a lasting mark on his life and writing. Finding too many distractions in his house, Dahl remembered the poet Dylan Thomas had found a peaceful shed to write in close to home. Dahl travelled to visit Thomas's hut in Carmarthenshire, Wales in the 1950s and, after <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> inside, {{decided to make a}} replica of it to write in.|$|E

500|$|Certainly he {{must have}} been a very talented writer, gaining a {{reputation}} of eloquence while he still lived in London (Bethurum, 58). [...] In a letter to him, [...] "the writer asks to be excused from translating something Wulfstan had asked him to render into English and pleads as an excuse his lack of ability in comparison with the bishop’s skill" [...] (58). [...] Similarly, [...] "ne early student of Wulfstan, Einenkel, and his latest editor, Jost, agree in thinking he wrote verse and not prose" [...] (Continuations, 229). [...] This suggests Wulfstan's writing is not only eloquent, but poetic, and among many of his rhetorical devices is marked rhythm (229). [...] <b>Taking</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> at Wulfstan's actual manuscripts, presented by Volume 17 of Early English Manuscripts in Facsimile, it becomes apparent that his writing was exceptionally neat and well structured– even his notes in the margins are well organised and tidy, and his handwriting itself is ornate but readable.|$|E
500|$|Fox, who {{graduated}} from RADA on 1 July 2001, followed up The Hole by appearing in Robert Altman's 2001 Academy Award-winning film Gosford Park. He then donned uniforms in a slew of film and television features, including roles as a German airman in Island at War (2004), an SS officer in The Last Drop (2005), and as British soldiers in the 2002 films Deathwatch and Ultimate Force, and in Colditz (2005). In the last made-for-television film, Fox played Capt. Tom Willis who, after an unsuccessful attempt {{to break out of}} a prisoner-of-war camp, is brought to Oflag IV-C in Colditz Castle, one of the most infamous German POW camps for officers in World War II. Actor Kevin Whately caught Fox's performance in the last ten minutes of the film, which he characterised as [...] "this young English boy going bonkers and wandering out to be shot", and thought [...] "He's interesting." [...] The next day, at a lunch meeting with [...] "all the powers that be" [...] regarding a new project, Whately mentioned that Fox [...] "would be worth <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> at".|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Take Back" [...] {{was directed by}} Toku, and took one day to shoot and two days to edit. According to Figlerowicz, who reviewed the singers' DVD compilation 7 Spirits, the video opens with a [...] "young Koda Kumi that has long and black hair. She presents herself in this video in two different ways. In the first one, though wearing a leather dress, she looks natural, gentle and pretty. In the latter one, she is presented with disheveled hair and strange things plaited in it, but despite that, she still attracts the viewer's attention with her enthusiasm flowing out from the screen." [...] In the video, Kumi is accompanied by her three fellow background dancers; they're dancing in a white photo shoot room, while she {{is sitting in a}} white chair. Figlerowicz stated that the dancers complimented the early 2000s music video era: [...] "there are only three dancers near the singer, so it probably wouldn't distinguish from other PVs of the same era." [...] Scenes interspersed through the main video show Koda lying nude on a crimson red Ferrari and clutching a microphone in her hand. Figlerowicz commented that the video, in conjunction with her other videos on 7 Spirits, [...] "didn't appeal to the Japanese audience's tastes [...] With some time, people's opinions of them might change, but they are worth <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> at.|$|E

500|$|The Spectator, however, {{criticized the}} {{relationship}} of Presley's character with his love interests: [...] "The girls in his (Michael Curtiz's) latest film, King Creole, are both played by good, serious actresses: Carolyn Jones [...]. and Dolores Hart, ... both are shown to be hungrily, desperately, unpridefully {{in love with him}} (Presley's character). They have no existence, except in him; do nothing but wait for him; hope for nothing but a little rough affection ... Instead of being kissed, they beg for kisses, which Mr. Presley sulkily and reluctantly hands out now and then, with the air of a small, fastidious boy being press to eat marshmallow and, though he feels a bit sick not quite knowing {{how to get out of}} it ... (it) really seems to suggest this is a god come down among us for a spell; and when tender and infinitely patient in spite of the long past of infidelity, nonchalance, and what looks to an observer like plain indifference from him, her lips poised for the kiss that doesn't come ... As the most extreme example of a contemporary idol, Mr. Presley is pretty fascinating, and, though you may be put off at first by his pale, puffy, bruised looking babyish face, by the weary cherubic decadence you might imagine in Nero, and the excessive greasiness of his excessively long, spiky locks, his films, however bad (and King Creole is pretty low on his list), are well worth <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> at." ...|$|E

Near flawless animations and picture perfect visuals make it a great choice {{to show off the}} sleek Sony super machine to your friends. Once the game begins, though, The Bouncer sheds it's [...] pretty boy image and gets down and dirty." [...] He was critical of the controls and the absence of a lock-on feature. Like other critics, he also had problems with the camera and the ratio of cutscenes to gameplay. He concluded [...] "Though many will undoubtedly be disappointed by The Bouncers inability {{to live up to the}} hype, others will find a fancy beat 'em up to pass a few hours. Its flashy graphics are at least worth <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> at, but its many problems just might keep it from a place in the collection." ...|$|E

Safon argued the Anthonys having been a regular and [...] "unremarkable" [...] family with complex relationships made them intriguing to watch. In a special piece for CNN, psychologist Frank Farley described the circumstantial evidence as [...] "all over the map" [...] and that combined with [...] "the apparent lying, significant contradictions and flip-flops of testimony, and questionable or bizarre theories of human behavior, it is little wonder that this nation [...] glued to the tube".

Psychologist Karyl McBride discussed how some mothers stray away from [...] "the saintly archetype" [...] expected of mothers. [...] "We want so badly to hang onto the belief system that mothers don't harm children," [...] she stated.

The next day, {{in a separate}} investigation, James Sullivan, Inspector General of the Chicago Public Schools district's Board of Education, released a report of his investigation stating that four student-athletes of a CPS school had one-month grade boosts to alter their college transcripts. The Chicago Sun-Times revealed the school as Simeon Career Academy and {{that three of the}} four were Rose and his former teammates Kevin Johnson and Tim Flowers, prominent members of the back-to-back championship teams. The newspaper claimed that Rose's grade was changed from a D to a C. Another part of the report stated that [...] "high school staff lost the original permanent records for three of the above mentioned students athletes" [...] (including the unknown four). Sullivan started the investigation because [...] "none of the grade changes were supported by any documentation."
