5|$|Animals {{including}} {{birds and}} turtles can detect the Earth's magnetic field, {{and use the}} field <b>to</b> <b>navigate</b> during migration. Some {{researchers have found that}} cows and wild deer tend to align their bodies north-south while relaxing, but not when the animals are under high-voltage power lines, suggesting that magnetism is responsible. Other researchers reported in 2011 that they could not replicate those findings using different Google Earth images.|$|E
5|$|Before the war, Major Ralph Bagnold {{learned how}} to {{maintain}} and operate vehicles, how <b>to</b> <b>navigate,</b> and how to communicate in the desert.

5|$|Ni no Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch is a {{role-playing}} {{game that}} uses a third-person perspective. Players complete quests—linear scenarios with set objectives—to progress through the story. Outside of quests, players can freely roam the overworld. Players explore towns, villages, dungeons and dangerous places scattered throughout the world, and possess the ability to travel between the world and Oliver's hometown of Motorville. Upon leaving a location, players enter the World Map, {{which can be used}} to select a destination. The world may be fully explored {{from the beginning of the}} game without restrictions, although story progress unlocks more gameplay content and forms of transport <b>to</b> <b>navigate</b> the world: players initially run <b>to</b> <b>navigate</b> the world, though later gain the ability to travel by boat, or on the back of a dragon.|$|E
5|$|Olfactory cues may be {{important}} in salmon, which are known {{to return to the}} exact river where they hatched.

5|$|Players use melee attacks, firearms, and {{explosives}} to fight enemies, and may run, jump, and occasionally swim <b>to</b> <b>navigate</b> through the locations. Melee attacks {{can be used}} to silently take down enemies without being detected. Alternatively, players can ambush enemies, which often results in an intense firefight between the two parties.|$|E
30|$|In our method, since {{localization}} {{is performed}} {{by using the}} linear magnetic map, localization accuracy is not influenced by moving objects. However, since the map {{does not have enough}} information, it is difficult for the robot <b>to</b> precisely <b>navigate</b> on the desired path. Our method allows the robot <b>to</b> precisely <b>navigate</b> on the path by using DCS.|$|R
