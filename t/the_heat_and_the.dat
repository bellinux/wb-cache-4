5|$|Allardyce {{wrote to}} every {{club in the}} top two {{divisions}} to inform them he was available on a free transfer, and privately lamented choosing his past clubs for financial rather than footballing reasons. Over the summer he played 11 games in the North American Soccer League for the Tampa Bay Rowdies, a club that shared facilities with the NFL's Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Allardyce subsequently applied in his managerial career many modern practices of American football with regards to training, player management and tactics. He found playing difficult however, due to <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> all-out attacking nature of his teammates, which led to him being frequently exposed at the back, though {{he found that the}} club's masseurs managed to cure a long-standing hamstring scar tissue problem.|$|E

25|$|The Miami Heat {{were one}} of the New York Knicks' strongest inter-divisional foes. The two teams met in the playoffs each year from 1997 to 2000, with all four of those series being played to the maximum amount of games. Pat Riley, the head coach of the Miami Heat at the time, served as the head coach of the Knicks from 1991 to 1995 and led the Knicks to the 1994 NBA Finals.

25|$|One Christmas was so {{much like}} another, in those years, around the sea-town corner now, and out of all sound except the distant {{speaking}} of the voices I sometimes hear a moment before sleep, that I can never remember whether it snowed for six days and six nights when I was twelve or whether it snowed for twelve days and twelve nights when I was six; or whether the ice broke and the skating grocer vanished like a snowman through a white trap-door on that same Christmas Day that the mince-pies finished Uncle Arnold and we tobogganed down the seaward hill, all the afternoon, on the best tea-tray, and Mrs. Griffiths complained, and we threw a snowball at her niece, and my hands burned so, with <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> cold, when I held {{them in front of}} the fire, that I cried for twenty minutes and then had some jelly.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the {{previous}} day, British and Indian forces had launched {{an attack on}} 'Stonehenge Ridge', where an Afghan force of about 3,000 men had established themselves {{with a number of}} artillery pieces and machine guns. Under cover of a preliminary bombardment to soften up the Afghan defences, men from the 11th Sikhs had launched the initial assault, however, they were forced to stop their attack when they ran out of ammunition at 08.00 hours, and although a resupply was effected at 10.30 hours, it was not until 14.00 hours that the attack was able to be recommenced. By this time the troops were exposed to the heat of the day; nevertheless, after another barrage was called down, the Sikhs attacked the Afghan line despite <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> attack was carried {{to the top of the}} ridge. Upon reaching the escarpment they found that the Afghans had left the battlefield, leaving most of their equipment, artillery and a number of standards. During the assault the British and Indian forces lost 22 killed and 157 wounded, while Afghan losses were estimated at around 200 killed and 400 wounded.|$|E
25|$|In 1887 Burnett {{traveled}} to England for Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee, {{which became the}} first of yearly transatlantic trips from the United States to England. Accompanied by her sons, she visited tourist attractions such as Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum in London. In her rented rooms she continued the Tuesday evening salon and soon attracted visitors, meeting Stephen Townsend for the first time. Despite her busy schedule, she felt ill from <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> crowds of tourists, spending protracted periods in bed. With her sons, she moved on to spend the winter in Florence, where she wrote The Fortunes of Philippa Fairfax, the only book {{to be published in}} England but not in the United States. That winter Sara Crewe or What Happened at Miss Minchin's was published in the United States. She would go on to make Sara Crewe into a stage play, and later rewrite the story into ALittle Princess. In 1888, Burnett returned to Manchester, where she leased a large home off Cromwell Road, had it decorated, and then turned it over to cousins to run as a boarding house, after which she moved to London, where she again took rooms, enjoyed the London season, and prepared Phyllis for production, a stage adaptation of The Fortunes of Philippa Fairfax. When the play ran she was disappointed by the bad reviews, and turned to socializing. During this period she began to see more of Stephen Townsend, whom she had met during the Jubilee year.|$|E

500|$|Asif had {{initially}} rejected Dilip Kumar {{for the part}} of Prince Salim. Kumar was reluctant {{to act in a}} period film, but accepted the role upon the insistence of the film's producer. According to Kumar, [...] "Asif trusted me enough to leave the delineation of Salim completely to me." [...] Kumar faced difficulty while filming in Rajasthan owing to <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> body armour he wore. The part of Anarkali had first been offered to Suraiya but later went to Madhubala, who had been longing for a significant role. Madhubala suffered from congenital heart disease, {{which was one of the}} reasons why at times she fainted on set; she also endured skin abrasions while filming the prison sequences, but was determined to finish the film.|$|E
500|$|Mikan's {{death was}} widely mourned by the {{basketball}} world, and also brought media {{attention to the}} financial struggles of several early-era NBA players. Many [...] felt that the current players of the big-money generation should rally for larger pensions for the pre-1965 predecessors in upcoming labor negotiations. Shaquille O'Neal paid for Mikan's funeral. He said: [...] "Without number 99 , there is no me." [...] Before Game 5 of the 2005 Eastern Conference Finals between <b>the</b> <b>Heat</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Detroit Pistons, {{there was a moment}} of silence to honor Mikan. Bob Cousy remarked that Mikan figuratively carried the NBA in the early days and single-handedly made the league credible and popular. The 2005 NBA Finals between the Pistons and the San Antonio Spurs was dedicated to Mikan.|$|E

500|$|There {{was also}} <b>the</b> <b>heat,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> problem of {{supplying}} adequate quantities of potable water. Diseases included cholera, typhus and bilharzia. To combat these, Downes obtained {{the services of}} the Lieutenant Colonel Charles James Martin, [...] and created the Anzac Field Laboratory to investigate these diseases. As a result of aggressively tackling the problem, Downes reduced rates of disease among Australian and New Zealand troops well below those of British troops serving alongside them. Martin advanced the notion that heat exhaustion and heat stroke were {{not the result of}} defective evaporation, as had previously been believed, but simply a matter of failing to drink enough water. He in turn converted Downes to the belief that [...] "provided water is available in adequate amount the heat mechanism of the body can defy all ordinary climatic ranges of temperature even under conditions of hard work." [...] With so many people and horses, sanitation was a challenge, and discipline in this area was initially slack, as it had been with disastrous results at Gallipoli. Downes took measures to improve the situation. Although not normally one to engage in disputes, Downes repeatedly clashed with the British medical officers of the EEF, especially the DMS EEF, Colonel Alfred [...] Keble, whose attitudes Downes regarded as endangering his troops.|$|E

2500|$|The climate did {{not affect}} the horses in a marked way but their rations, {{although}} plentiful, contained only a small proportion of pure grain with insufficient nutritional value and was too bulky and unpalatable.

During mid summer when iron was too hot to handle and a hand placed {{on the back of a}} horse was positively painful, yet in the dust, <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> many diseases, in particular Surra fever which carried by the Surra fly which, in 1917 decimated the Ottoman transport killing as many as 42,000 camels in the Jordan Valley, the horses survived.|$|E

[...] "We shot certain sequences in a very dark environment, which you get used to, so when the Sun plays a role, we wanted the audience to have a physical reaction to it", Kuchler said. Due to filming with the actors taking place on a stage, director Danny Boyle constructed live effects so the actors could realistically respond to computer-generated effects that were later implemented.|$|E
