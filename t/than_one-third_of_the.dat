By September 19 it had passed Resident Evil: Extinction $97.1 million overseas total. The following day it had surpassed Extinction total of $103.2 million overseas, 148.8 million worldwide, to become the highest-grossing entry of the series.|$|E
5|$|One {{month after}} Croatia {{declared}} its independence, the Yugoslav army and other Serb forces held something less <b>than</b> <b>one-third</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Croatian territory, mostly {{in areas with}} a predominantly ethnic Serb population. The JNA military strategy partly consisted of extensive shelling, at times irrespective {{of the presence of}} civilians. As the war progressed, the cities of Dubrovnik, Gospić, Šibenik, Zadar, Karlovac, Sisak, Slavonski Brod, Osijek, Vinkovci, and Vukovar all came under attack by Yugoslav forces. The United Nations (UN) imposed a weapons embargo; this did not affect JNA-backed Serb forces significantly, as they had the JNA arsenal at their disposal, but it caused serious trouble for the newly formed Croatian army. The Croatian government started smuggling weapons over its borders.|$|E

5|$|Madonna's {{performance}} was the most-watched Super Bowl halftime show in history, with 114million viewers– {{more than the}} game itself, which had 111.3million viewers. According to the Nielsen ratings, the show had a 47.4 household rating; among adults 18–49 it had a 41.5 rating, compared with the game average of 40.5. Reuters noted that the half-hour from 9:30 to 9:58 ET peaked at a 50.7 household rating and a 72 share, with 117.7 million viewers. The record was broken by Bruno Mars in 2014 (115 million) and Katy Perry in 2015 (118 million). Madonna set a record as the most-tweeted subject on Twitter (10,245 posts in one second, {{with an average of}} 8,000 tweets per second for five minutes) and was the most-searched term on Google during the show. Wired CEO Mark Ghuneim tweeted that less <b>than</b> <b>one-third</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tweets were negative, 59 percent were positive and 11 percent were neutral. According to Billboard, the day after the show its ratings and economic impact were discussed.|$|E
5|$|The {{region of}} the Aristarchus plateau has been the site of many {{reported}} transient lunar phenomena, {{with a total of}} 122 such reports by 2007; the highest recorded for any lunar feature. Such events include temporary obscurations and colorations of the surface, and catalogues of these show that more <b>than</b> <b>one-third</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most reliable spottings come from this locale. In 1971 when Apollo 15 passed 110 kilometers above the Aristarchus plateau, a significant rise in alpha particles was detected. These particles are believed to be caused by the decay of radon-222, a radioactive gas with a half-life of only 3.8 days. The Lunar Prospector mission later confirmed radon-222 emissions from this crater. These observations could be explained by either the slow and visually imperceptible diffusion of gas to the surface, or by discrete explosive events.|$|E

Examples include: Neuville, meaning [...] "new village"; Bourville (Bodardi villa, 8th century) meaning [...] "Bodard's farm"; Harcourt (Herolcurt, 11th century) meaning [...] "Herulf's farm"; and Attemesnil (Ademesnil, 13th century) meaning [...] "Adda's property".
