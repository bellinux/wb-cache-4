40|$|Abstract: This study {{aimed to}} explore the {{clinical}} characteristics of hand arm vibration syndrome (HAVS) {{in a group of}} <b>tree</b> <b>fellers</b> in a tropical environment. We examined all <b>tree</b> <b>fellers</b> and se-lected control subjects in a logging camp of central Sarawak for vibration exposure and presence of HAVS symptoms utilizing vibrotactile perception threshold test (VPT) and cold water provocation test (CWP). None of the subjects reported white finger. The <b>tree</b> <b>fellers</b> reported significantly higher prevalence of finger coldness as compared to the control subjects (OR= 10. 32, 95 %CI= 1. 21 – 87. 94). A lower finger skin temperature, longer fingernail capillary return time and higher VPT were ob-served among the <b>tree</b> <b>fellers</b> as compared to the control subjects in all fingers (effect size> 0. 5). The VPT following CWP of the <b>tree</b> <b>fellers</b> was significantly higher (repeated measures ANOVA p= 0. 002, partial η 2 = 0. 196) than the control subject. The A (8) level was associated with finger tingling, numb-ness and dullness (effect size= 0. 983) and finger coldness (effect size= 0. 524) among the <b>tree</b> <b>fellers.</b> Finger coldness and finger tingling, numbness and dullness are important symptoms for HAVS in tropical environment that may indicate vascular and neurological damage due to hand-transmitte...|$|R
40|$|The {{evidence}} on {{hand-arm vibration syndrome}} (HAVS) in tropical environments is limited. The legislation for the control of occupational vibration exposure {{has yet to be}} established in Malaysia. Objectives: The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the clinical characteristics of HAVS in a tropical environment in comparison with a temperate environment. Methods: We conducted a series medical examinations among the forestry, construction and automobile industry workers in Malaysia adopting the compulsory medical examination procedure used by Wakayama Medical University for Japanese vibratory tools workers. We matched the duration of vibration exposure and compared our results against the Japanese workers. We also compared the results of the Malaysian <b>tree</b> <b>fellers</b> against a group of symptomatic Japanese <b>tree</b> <b>fellers</b> diagnosed with HAVS. Results: Malaysian subjects reported a similar prevalence of finger tingling, numbness and dullness (Malaysian= 25. 0, Japanese= 21. 5, p= 0. 444) but had a lower finger skin temperature (FST) and higher vibrotactile perception threshold (VPT) values as compared with the Japanese workers. No white finger was reported in Malaysian subjects. The FST and VPT of the Malaysian <b>tree</b> <b>fellers</b> were at least as bad as the Japanese <b>tree</b> <b>fellers</b> despite a shorter duration (mean difference= 20. 12 years, 95 Cl= 14. 50, 25. 40) of vibration exposure. Conclusions: Although the vascular disorder does not manifest clinically in the tropical environment, the severity of HAVS can be as bad as in the temperate environment with predominantly neurological disorder. Hence, it is essential to formulate national legislation for the control of the occupational vibration exposure...|$|R

From 1906 to 1914, Young and Knubel climbed together each summer, making a number of first ascents together, including the Täschhorn's south face, the Weisshorn's southeast and northeast faces, the Rimpfischhorn and Zinalrothorn's east faces, the Gspaltenhorn's west face, Grandes Jorasses' west ridge, and Mont Brouillard. The route the two mapped out to reach the summit of Aiguille du Plan in 1907 is still the route used by most alpine climbers today. On Young's first ascent of the east face of the Aiguille du Grépon with several other climbers and Knubel and Henri Brocherel as guides in 1911, Knubel used an ice axe instead of a piton to clear an overhang; the spot was thereafter known as [...] "The Knubel Crack".|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY Constrictive {{pericarditis}} and pyopericardium with tamponade in {{a patient}} with rheu-matoid arthritis is described. No fever was recorded despite a litre of pus in the pericardial sac, perhaps because of previous treatment with hydrocortisone. Echocardiography is a diagnostic advance. Pericarditis is the commonest cardiac manifestation of rheumatoid arthritis. It may present as 'dry' pericarditis with a friction rub and only rarely with tamponade (Kirk and Cosh, 1969). Pyopericardium is extremely rare, and we can find no previous account of pyopericardium with tamponade in association with rheumatoid arthritis. Case report A 53 -year-old man presented {{with a history of}} progressive shortness of breath and oedema from the ankles to the umbilicus. A diagnosis of rheu-matoid arthritis had been made 20 years previously. Proximal interphalangeal, metacarpalphalangeal, wrist, ankle, and knee joints were involved. The Rose-Waaler test was positive, with negative tests for LE cells and antinuclear factor. A synovectomy had been performed on the right knee in 1972, and in the past year he had had several intra-articular injections of hydrocortisone, the last injection into the left knee 6 weeks before admission. He was also treated with aspirin and indomethacin. Despite his disability he had worked as a <b>tree</b> <b>feller</b> until serious breathlessness developed 5 months before his attendance at this hospital. On examination he had gross oedema of the legs, ascites, and bilateral pleural effusions, and the jugular venous pressure was raised above the angle of the jaw.

40|$|Plots and {{plantations}} Cue: In Nigeria, government forest {{officers are}} responsible for most forest management. Local people are, however, given access to forests and forest products, and are also issued plots of land within forests reserves for cultivation of crops. Revenues are paid to the state forest departments for these activities. It is also common for state authorities to make forest land available to commercial companies for production of cash crops, such as palm oil and rubber. However, some of these policies have been criticised for causing {{the destruction of the}} natural forests. To find out how forest management could be improved, Tunde Fatunde spoke to Ebohon Clifford Afehodyon, assistant forest superintendent at the Nigerian Forestry Institute in Ibadan, who is responsible for co-ordinating forest guards and officers {{in the southern part of}} the country. He began by asking about the current level of involvement for local communities in forest management. IN:		?There is no community managed ? OUT:		? conservation of the ecosystem. ? DUR?N	 3 ? 13 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Ebohon Clifford Afehodyon, with some suggestions for how forests could be better conserved in Nigeria. Transcript Afehodyon	There is no community managed forest reserve in the southern part of Nigeria. However, government provides forest officers for managing such forests. They work in collaboration with local communities, and the results in most cases are usually not too bad. Forest guards ensure that economic trees are not illegally taken away. The forest officers on the other hand, see to the day-to-day running of the forest, including collection of revenues. Fatunde	How would you from experience describe the attitude of local communities towards government supervision of forest reserves? Afehodyon	Local communities are well disposed towards government supervision, because of what they have at stake. The forest reserves are the source of their livelihood. It provides jobs for surrounding communities; it provides food, fuelwood, medicines, craft materials, and building materials. Fatunde	From your own experience, what kind of complaints are lodged by local communities on how these forest resources are being managed? Afehodyon	The communities complain about some aspects of the usage of the forests, especially the establishment of rubber and oil palm tree plantations, within the forest enclave. These cash crops prevent the local communities from obtaining other benefits from the forest, such as bushmeat, medicinal herbs, and firewood. Another source of complaint is the malaise of illegal <b>tree</b> <b>fellers,</b> because they perceive these activities as a threat to their livelihood. Fatunde	Faced with the growing destruction of forest reserves in the south western part of Nigeria, what kind of policies should be put in place by the government in order to conserve the ecosystem in these forest reserves? Afehodyon	First and foremost, the government should ensure that the present policy of giving out forest reserves to companies to establish cash crops should be discouraged, because they give rise to deforestation. Secondly, the present policy of allocating between 1. 2 and 2. 0 hectares of land per household, for farming purposes, should be reduced by about 50 %, so as to check deforestation within forest reserves. And thirdly, the efforts of the Nigerian Conservation Fund (NCF), should be encouraged and complemented by various state governments, and other NGOs that are concerned with conservation of the ecosystem. End of track. A forest superintendent from Nigeria explains how policy needs to change in order to reduce the amount of natural forest that is lost to cash crop plantations and agriculture...|$|R
