This work shows an innovative, economically convenient application for EAF slag: its use as reinforcing filler for polypropylene. Composites based on polypropylene containing 10 – 40 wt. % of EAF slag particles were prepared by melt compounding followed by injection molding. A physical–chemical analysis of the EAF slag was performed to determine microstructural features and main component phases. Leaching tests demonstrated that, although EAF slag can release small amounts of toxic elements, such as heavy metals, incorporating such material into the polymeric matrix immobilizes the heavy metals inside that matrix. The mechanical characterization of the polymer-based composites was performed. Incorporating EAF slag particles raises the Young’s modulus and the <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> <b>at</b> <b>yield,</b> whereas elongation at break and the impact strength of the polymer-based composite are significantly reduced only when large amounts of filler are added, i. e., 30 % or more...|$|E
40|$|The {{morphology}} of ternary polystyrene/styrene-butadiene rubber/polyethylene (PS/SBR/PE) blends {{has been}} investigated in the limits of a constant content of the major component (PS; 75 wt%) while changing the weight ratio of the two minor constitutive polymers. A core-shell structure for the dispersed phase has been predicted from the spreading coefficients and observed by transmission electron microscopy.

The size of the PE subphase in the mixed dispersed phase increases sharply at a PE content that corresponds to phase inversion in the parent SBR/PE binary blends.

40|$|A {{biobased}} poly(butylene 2, 5 -furan dicarboxylate) (PBF) is synthesized and {{blended with}} poly(lactic acid) (PLA). With only 5 wt % addition of PBF, the {{elongation at break}} of PLA becomes 18. 5 times more than before, while the tensile modulus and <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> <b>at</b> <b>yield</b> keep almost the same. Morphological analysis based on scanning electron microscope pictures shows drastic shape deformation of PBF dispersed phases from sphere to fibril. The elongation ratio of PBF phase is much larger than that of PLA matrix, which {{is caused by a}} possible "plastic-rubber" transition in PBF during stretch process. On the other hand, stretch induced crystallization in PBF happened and it may increase the modulus of PBF along the tensile direction. Probably with the above two phenomena, PLA is dynamically toughened and strengthened in the elongation procedure. Moreover, the impact strength of the blends is better than those of the two pure components, and rubber-plastic transition and crystallization of PBF could improve the impact toughness too. The gas barrier property of PLA/PBF blends is also significantly enhanced by the introduction of a furan ring. It can be concluded that PLA/PBF blends are a good base material with great potential for future development in different areas...|$|E

In adhesive bonding, TEPs have been used for recycling purposes. However, TEPs might be used to modify structural adhesives for other new purposes, such as: to increase the joint strength by creating an adhesive functionally modified along the overlap of the joint by gradual heating and/or to heal the adhesive in case of damage. In this study, the behaviour of a structural polyurethane adhesive modified with TEPs was investigated as a preliminary study for further investigations on the potential of TEPs in adhesive joints. Tensile bulk tests were performed to get the tensile properties of the unmodified and TEPs-modified adhesive, while Double Cantilever Beam (DCB) test was performed in order to evaluate the resistance to mode I crack propagation of unmodified and TEPs-modified adhesive. In addition, in order to investigate the behaviour of the particles while encapsulated in adhesives, a thermal analysis was done. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to examine the fracture surface morphology of the specimens.

The isothermal crystallization kinetic parameters by Avrami analysis showed that crystallization was controlled by nucleation, crystal growth was spherical, and the nucleation type changed between thermal and athermal nucleation. X-ray diffraction showed that when the additives were used together both the crystal thickness {{and the degree of}} crystallinity increased. A multiple-response regression analysis was made with the ZnO, oleic acid, and GMO concentrations as variables and the crystallinity as output.

Bentonite and waste tires were used as auxiliary fillers and bitumen as the binder. CW/bitumen, CW/bentonite/bitumen, and CW/waste tire/bitumen mixtures were prepared by using a laboratory mixer at 100 °C.

It has already been shown that the addition of nanophase compared with conventional (or micron-scale) ceramics to polymers enhances bone cell functions. However, in order to fully take advantage of the promising nanometer size effects that nanoceramics can provide when added to polymers, it is critical to uniformly disperse them in a polymer matrix. This is critical since ceramic nanoparticles inherently have a strong tendency to form larger agglomerates in a polymer matrix which may compromise their properties. Therefore, in this study, model ceramic nanoparticles, specifically titania and hydroxyapatite (HA), were dispersed in a model polymer (PLGA, poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid) using high-power ultrasonic energy. The mechanical properties of the resulting PLGA composites with well-dispersed ceramic (either titania or HA) nanoparticles were investigated and compared with composites with agglomerated ceramic nanoparticles. Results demonstrated that well-dispersed ceramic nanoparticles (titania or HA) in PLGA improved mechanical properties compared with agglomerated ceramic nanoparticles even though the weight percentage of the ceramics was the same.

To assess to the effect of different type of inorganic particles (with different interaction with the polymeric matrix) in the deformation behaviour of PET composites, particles such as aluminium, bronze, nanoclay, graphite and mica, were used. Two types of processing methods, ensuring a good mixing, were adopted for the composite preparation: i) melt-blending in an asymmetric batch mini-mixer followed by compression and ii) melt-blending in a twin screw extruder followed by injection moulding. The structural and mechanical behaviours of neat PET and its composites were evaluated during uniaxial stretching at temperatures above the glass transition temperature, Tg, namely at 85, 90, 95, 100 ºC, using a standard tensile stretching machine equipped with an environmental chamber. This study aims at understanding the deformation behaviour of the materials at temperatures found in conventional transformation methods used for packaging. To interpret the structural evolution occurring in the samples, off-line techniques such as DSC, WAXD and SEM were used. A detailed structural evolution was accomplished by applying different stretching ratios to the samples up to a maximum of 5 x. Injection moulded samples were also characterized for their mechanical properties at room temperature in order to assess the materials behaviour in service. 	From all particles studied the PET/Aluminium and PET/Bronze composites are the ones showing the best combination of aesthetic effects, deformation behaviour and final mechanical properties. Comparing to neat PET, their general properties are the same during the deformation process making the new materials suitable for conventional processing techniques. It was found that both particles offer superior molecular mobility to PET at room temperature. In other words, these composites present a higher deformation capacity, however its elastic modulus and <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> <b>at</b> <b>yield</b> are slightly reduced...|$|E

40|$|Poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) {{flooring}} {{products in}} the form of flexible sheets and tiles dominate the resilient flooring market. These flooring products are produced by calendering compounds based on vinyl chloride-vinyl acetate copolymer filled with calcium carbonate, essentially with plasticizers and other additives. Plasticizers have become matter of concern from indoor air quality (IAQ) point of view as they are suspected to be the one of the sources of volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions, considered harmful to human health. In the research work reported here, polyolefin elastomers (POE) filled with calcium carbonate filler are prepared and their mechanical properties are evaluated as an alternative to poly(vinyl chloride), PVC matrix for flooring products. POEs are olefin copolymers synthesized using metallocene technology and does not require plasticizers for processing, yet can provide similar flexibility to the finished product as that of plasticized PVC. Also, POE can incorporate relatively higher amounts of post consumer polyethylene (PC-PE) while maintaining adequate properties. The POE used in this study is Engage- 8440, which is an ethylene-octene copolymer. Two types of PC-PE are studied in this research: the first one is a 50 - 50 mixture of linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) and low density polyethylene (LDPE) and the second is a high density polyethylene (HDPE). The mechanical and thermal properties, as well as the technique is used to study the difference in thermal properties of the two recycled resins. Further, heat and UV stabilizers are added and the tensile properties of POE/PC-PE blend composites are tested for accelerated weathering effects.

40|$|The {{research}} {{aim is to}} develop alternative cost-effective poly (vinyl chloride) PVC formulation that possesses good mechanical properties, resistant to microbial attack, with low volatile organic compounds (VOC's) emission, {{as well as to}} explore a market for lignin, an abundant natural polymer, obtained as a by-product of paper making. One of the main applications of plasticized PVC for building industry is the production of flooring. Normally in the manufacture industry of the PVC flooring di-ethyl-hexyl-phthalate (DEHP), commercially known as DOP is used as a plasticizer to facilitate the processing of PVC. DOP is environmental pollutant due to its biodegradability that consequently releases VOC's; considering this hazard, the introduction of other biopolymers and other additives in PVC formulation could contribute to a safer and healthier environment. DOP has been used in this research for comparative purpose only. Series of plasticized PVC formulations were prepared with different types of plasticizers namely: Di-octyl phthalate (DOP), Diethylene glycol dibenzoate (Benzoflex 2 - 45), Tricresyl phosphate (Lindol) and Alkyl sulfonic acid phenyl ester (Mesamoll). Meanwhile, the role of lignin within the mixtures was evaluated, as part of the PVC was replaced with different lignins namely Organosolv, Indulin and Tomlinite (20 phr of PVC). The new proposed alternative flooring material was prepared by melt mixing and compression molding, and tested to evaluate its processibility, thermal properties, mechanical properties (i. e., Young's modulus, <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> <b>at</b> break and <b>yield,</b> elongation <b>at</b> break) as well as its morphology.

40|$|As a {{preliminary}} {{starting point for}} the present study, physical and mechanical properties of polypropylene nanocomposites (PPNCs) for samples received from Queen's University Belfast have been evaluated. Subsequently, polymer/clay nanocomposite material has been produced at Bradford. Mixing and processing routes have been explored, and mechanical properties for the different compounded samples have been studied. Clay intercalation structure has received particular attention to support the ultimate objective of optimising tensile and fracture behaviour of isotropic and die-drawn PPNCs. Solid-state molecular orientation has been introduced to PPNCs by the die-drawing process. Tensile stress-strain measurements with video-extensometry and tensile fracture of double edge-notched tensile specimens have been used to evaluate the Young's modulus at three different strain rates and the total work of fracture toughness at three different notch lengths. The polymer composite was analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis, polarizing optical microscopy, wide angle x-ray diffraction, and transmission electron microscopy. 3 % and 5 % clay systems at various compatibilizer (PPMA) loadings were prepared by three different mixing routes for the isotropic sheets, produced by compression moulding, and tensile bars, produced by injection moulding process. Die-drawn oriented tensile bars were drawn to draw ratio of 2, 3 and 4. The results from the Queen's University Belfast samples showed a decrement in <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> <b>at</b> <b>yield.</b> This might be explained by poor bonding, which refers to poor dispersion. Voids that can be supported by intercalated PP/clay phases might be responsible for improvement of elongation at break. The use of PPMA and an intensive mixing regime with a two-step master batch process overcame the compatibility issue and achieved around 40 % and 50 % increase in modulus for 3 % and 5 % clay systems respectively. This improvement of the two systems was reduced after drawing to around 15 % and 25 % compared with drawn PP. The work of fracture is increased either by adding nanoclay or by drawing to low draw ratio, or both. At moderate and high draw ratios, PPNCs may undergo either an increase in the size of microvoids at low clay loading or coalescence of microvoids at high clay loading, eventually leading to an earlier failure than with neat PP. The adoption of PPMA loading using an appropriate mixing route and clay loading can create a balance between the PPMA stiffness effect and the degree of bonding between clay particles and isotropic or oriented polymer molecules. Spherulites size, d-spacing of silicate layers, and nanoparticles distribution of intercalated microtactoids with possible semi-exfoliated particles have been suggested to optimize the final PPNCs property.

40|$|Flax fibers {{can be used}} as {{environmentally}} friendly alternatives to conventional reinforcing fibers (e. g., glass) in composites. The interest in natural fiber-reinforced polymer composites is growing rapidly due to its high performance in terms of mechanical properties, significant processing advantages, excellent chemical resistance, low cost and low density. These advantages place natural fiber composites among the high performance composites having economic and environmental advantages. In the field of technical utilization of plant fibers, flax fiber-reinforced composites represent {{one of the most important}} areas. On the other hand, lack of good interfacial adhesion and poor resistance to moisture absorption make the use of natural fiber-reinforced composites less attractive. In order to improve their interfacial properties, fibers were subjected to chemical treatments, namely, mercerization, silane treatment, benzoylation, and peroxide treatment. Selective removal of non-cellulosic compounds constitutes the main objective of the chemical treatments of flax fibers to improve the performance of fiber-reinforced composites. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of pre-treated flax fibers on the performance of the fiber-reinforced composites. Short flax fibers were derived from Saskatchewan-grown flax straws, for use in fiber-reinforced composites. Composites consisting of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) or linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) or HDPE/LLDPE mix, chemically treated fibers and additives were prepared by the extrusion process. Extrusion is expected to improve the interfacial adhesion significantly as opposed to simple mixing of the two components. The extruded strands were then pelletized and ground. The test samples were prepared by rotational molding. The fiber surface topology and the tensile fracture surfaces of the composites were characterized by scanning electron microscopy to determine whether the modified fiber-matrix interface had improved interfacial bonding. Mechanical and physical properties of the composites were evaluated. The differential scanning calorimetry technique was also used to measure the melting point of flax fiber and composite. Overall, the scanning electron microscopy photographs of fiber surface characteristics and fracture surfaces of composites clearly indicated the extent of fiber-matrix interface adhesion. Chemically treated fiber-reinforced composites showed better fiber-matrix interaction as observed from the good dispersion of fibers in the matrix system. Compared to untreated fiber-reinforced composites, all the treated fiber-reinforced composites had the same tendency to slightly increase the <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> <b>at</b> <b>yield</b> of composites. Silane, benzoylation, and peroxide treated fiber-reinforced composites offered superior physical and mechanical properties. Strong intermolecular fiber-matrix bonding decreased the high rate of water absorption in biocomposites.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The Substrateless Packaging process was developed at Loughborough University as an alternative method of manufacturing electronics with an improved end-of-life materials recovery profile. The process involves injection moulding to overmould electronic components in thermoplastic polymers. Initial prototype samples manufactured in previous work exhibited undesirable small gaps around the embedded components after solidification and which {{were thought to be}} the result of adhesion problems between the thermoplastic overmould and components. The study reported here had the aims of determining quantitatively what factors affect adhesion, and to identify which thermoplastic polymers are most suitable for the process. Following a literature survey, six engineering thermoplastics, PC, PBT, PS, ABS, PA 6 and PMMA were chosen for study as overmoulding materials, and tin as the solid adherend. The literature survey also identified the mechanisms contributing to adhesion at the metal-thermoplastic interface in insert moulding as material properties, interfacial forces between the materials, wetting at the interface, temperature of the insert (consequently temperature at the interface) and insert moulding parameters. A methodology was designed to allow investigation of all these factors, with Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) force-distance measurements being used to measure room temperature interfacial forces, high temperature contact angle for wetting, and pull-out strength tests on overmoulded tin-coated wire for overall system adhesion. Excellent repeatability was seen in the measurements obtained with all three experimental methods. Moldflow finite element simulations of the insert moulding process were also undertaken. For the AFM measurements tin particles were adhered to the probe with the aid of a Focused Ion Beam (FIB) apparatus. PA and PMMA interatomic interactions with tin were found to be noticeably stronger than the other polymers. From consideration of the different possible contributions to the measured forces, it was concluded that the trend of interatomic interactions obtained is due to a combination of electrostatic forces, capillary forces and dispersion forces acting between the materials tested. In the high temperature contact angle measurements it was observed that the contact angles for all the materials producing drops in equilibrium reduce monotonically with rise in temperature at the interface. The work of adhesion was calculated from the contact angles for PMMA using the Young-Dupre equation and values of surface tension from the literature. It was found that it does not increase monotonically with temperature as might be expected from the contact angles. The works of adhesion at 240 °C for all the materials were also calculated and it was found that the materials ranking for expected adhesive strength changed significantly from that expected from consideration of contact angle alone. In the pull out tests, except for PC, the breaking loads for the materials tested rise then fall with rise in temperature of the insert. It was observed that peak breaking load for the amorphous polymers ABS, PS and PMMA occurred for insert temperature just below Tg of the polymer, and for semi-crystalline polymers PA 6 and PBT it was just above Tg. The ranking of materials by maximum pull out strength was found to be consistent with the ranking by mechanical strength (<b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> <b>at</b> <b>yield)</b> of the thermoplastics. The Moldflow simulations yielded the significant results that the thermoplastic melt comes in contact with the insert at relatively low pressure (less than 0. 6 MPa), and that the temperature of the melt near the insert drops to the temperature of the insert almost instantaneously on contact. Therefore it was concluded that the efficacy of holding pressure on assisting wetting of the insert by the thermoplastic melt may depend on the temperature of the insert interface. The results in terms of material rankings from both the material level tests (AFM force distance experiment and wetting at high temperature) did not correspond to the mechanical strength test results. It was therefore concluded that the choice of material for thermoplastic overmould cannot be made purely based on the material interactions at interface between tin and thermoplastics in solid or melt phase. It was also concluded that the observed variation in the pull-out strengths with temperature of the insert maintained during overmoulding, must be largely due to the thermo-mechanical properties of the material at the interface. Based on the results of the study, PC, PBT and PMMA were recommended as being likely to give superior performance to the ABS which was used in early trials of the substrateless packaging process.

40|$|The Substrateless Packaging {{process was}} {{developed}} at Loughborough University {{as an alternative}} method of manufacturing electronics with an improved end-of-life materials recovery profile. The process involves injection moulding to overmould electronic components in thermoplastic polymers. Initial prototype samples manufactured in previous work exhibited undesirable small gaps around the embedded components after solidification and which {{were thought to be}} the result of adhesion problems between the thermoplastic overmould and components. The study reported here had the aims of determining quantitatively what factors affect adhesion, and to identify which thermoplastic polymers are most suitable for the process. Following a literature survey, six engineering thermoplastics, PC, PBT, PS, ABS, PA 6 and PMMA were chosen for study as overmoulding materials, and tin as the solid adherend. The literature survey also identified the mechanisms contributing to adhesion at the metal-thermoplastic interface in insert moulding as material properties, interfacial forces between the materials, wetting at the interface, temperature of the insert (consequently temperature at the interface) and insert moulding parameters. A methodology was designed to allow investigation of all these factors, with Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) force-distance measurements being used to measure room temperature interfacial forces, high temperature contact angle for wetting, and pull-out strength tests on overmoulded tin-coated wire for overall system adhesion. Excellent repeatability was seen in the measurements obtained with all three experimental methods. Moldflow finite element simulations of the insert moulding process were also undertaken. For the AFM measurements tin particles were adhered to the probe with the aid of a Focused Ion Beam (FIB) apparatus. PA and PMMA interatomic interactions with tin were found to be noticeably stronger than the other polymers. From consideration of the different possible contributions to the measured forces, it was concluded that the trend of interatomic interactions obtained is due to a combination of electrostatic forces, capillary forces and dispersion forces acting between the materials tested. In the high temperature contact angle measurements it was observed that the contact angles for all the materials producing drops in equilibrium reduce monotonically with rise in temperature at the interface. The work of adhesion was calculated from the contact angles for PMMA using the Young-Dupre equation and values of surface tension from the literature. It was found that it does not increase monotonically with temperature as might be expected from the contact angles.
