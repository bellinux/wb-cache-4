40|$|ABSTRACT Introduction: The jump landing is {{the leading}} cause for ankle {{injuries}} in basketball. It has been shown that the use of ankle brace is effective to prevent these injuries by increasing the mechanical stability of the ankle at the initial contact of the foot with the ground. Objective: To investigate the effects of ankle brace on the ground reaction force (GRF) during the simulation of a basketball rebound jump. Method: Eleven young male basketball players randomly carried out a simulated basketball rebound jump under two conditions, with and without ankle brace (lace-up). Dynamic parameters of vertical GRF (take-off and landing vertical peaks, <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>take-off</b> and landing vertical peaks, take-off impulse peak, impulse at 50 milliseconds of landing, and jump height) and medial-lateral (take-off and landing medial-lateral peaks, and time to reach medial-lateral peaks at take-off and landing) were recorded by force platform during rebound jumps in each tested condition. The comparisons between the tested conditions were performed by paired t test (P 0. 05). Conclusion: The use of ankle brace during basketball rebound jumps attenuates the magnitude of medial-lateral GRF on the landing phase, without changing the vertical GRF. This finding indicates that the use of brace increases the medial-lateral mechanical protection by decreasing the shear force exerted on the athlete’s body without change the application of propulsive forces in the take-off and the impact absorption quality in the landing during the basketball rebound jump...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{reactive}} strength index modified (RSImod) {{has been}} recently identified and validated {{as a method}} of monitoring countermovement jump (CMJ) performance. The kinetic and kinematic mechanisms that optimize a higher RSImod score are, however, currently unknown. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to compare entire CMJ force-, power-, velocity- and displacement-time curves (termed temporal phase analysis) of athletes who achieve high versus low RSImod scores. Methods: Fifty-three professional male rugby league players performed three maximal effort CMJs on a force platform and variables of interest were calculated via forward dynamics. RSImod values of the top (high RSImod group) and bottom (low RSImod group) twenty athletes’ kinetic and kinematic-time curves were compared. Results: The high RSImod group (0. 53 ± 0. 05 vs. 0. 36 ± 0. 03) jumped higher (37. 7 ± 3. 9 vs. 31. 8 ± 3. 2 cm) with a shorter <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>take-off</b> (TTT) (0. 707 ± 0. 043 vs. 0. 881 ± 0. 122 s). This was achieved by a more rapid unweighting phase followed by greater eccentric and concentric force, velocity and power for large portions (including peak values) of the jump, but a similar countermovement displacement. The attainment of a high RSImod score therefore required a taller, but thinner, active impulse. Conclusion: Athletes who perform the CMJ with a high RSImod, as achieved by high jumps with a short TTT, demonstrate superior force, power, velocity and impulse during both the eccentric and concentric phases of the jump. Practitioners who include the RSImod calculation within their testing batteries may assume that greater RSImod values are attributed to an increase in these underpinning kinetic and kinematic parameters.

40|$|The {{eucalyptus}} woodborer, Phoracantha semipunctata Fabricius (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae), attacks mainly {{species of}} Eucalyptus (Myrtaceae). This study investigated walking and flight behaviour of P. semipunctata {{males and females}} exposed to an odour plume originating from a log of E. globulus placed vertically in the upwind end of a wind tunnel. In control experiments, beetles were exposed to a PVC drainpipe {{in the same position}} as the log, providing a visual stimulus without host-tree odour. No statistical differences were found between behavioural responses of either sex when exposed to the log or PVC pipe. No beetles landed on the PVC pipe, whereas 49 % of the beetles exposed to host-tree odour plume landed on the log. Beetles aged over 24 days after emergence from the host tree were more responsive than beetles aged 20 - 24 days, and accounted for 86 % of the beetles that landed on the log. While walking, host-tree odour affected the behaviour of the beetles that landed on the log as follows: upwind movement and path linearity increased, whereas turning rate, stopping frequency, mean stopping time and <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>take-off</b> flight decreased. During flight, host-tree odour affected the behaviour of the beetles that landed on the log as follows: increased upwind flight, turning rate, flight time, flight distance, and decreased flight speed. For beetles that never lost contact with the odour plume, flight progressed upwind with narrow zigzags, and showed higher directedness upwind, path linearity, faster flight speed and lower turning rate than for beetles that lost contact with the odour plume. After loosing contact with the plume, beetles tended to decrease their upwind progression, exhibiting a sharp turn or quick counterturns followed by crosswind or downwind excursions. This led to regaining contact with the odour plume and resumed upwind progression at higher speed provided they flew within the boundaries of the plume. The results showed that host-tree odour affects both walking and flight behaviour of P. semipunctata beetles, inducing a more directed upwind movement and landing on the visual stimulus of a tree trunk...|$|E

40|$|We {{report that}} a long-distance {{migrating}} shorebird, the red knot, makes a complete switch from commonly occurring monoester preen waxes {{to a much}} rarer class of higher-molecular-weight diester waxes at the <b>time</b> of <b>take-off</b> <b>to</b> the high arctic breeding grounds. The cold arctic climate would have required a lowering of wax-viscosity, and thus, {{a shift in the}} reverse direction. We propose that a sexually selected need for a brilliant plumage has lead to this center-intuitive temporary shift from monoesters to diester waxes. The difficulty of application of the diester preen waxes under cold conditions would ensure the reliability of the quality-signalling function of this most probably sexually selected trait...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} behaviour of male European pine sawflies, Neodiprion sertifer Geoffr. (Hym., Diprionidae), that were released downwind from pheromone traps. Releases were done at three distances; either at 5 m from one trap, or at 50 m or 200 m from five traps, {{placed in a}} line perpendicular to the current wind direction. As a control, males were released identically but without any pheromone source present. The behaviour of the males prior <b>to</b> <b>take-off</b> was studied on a release platform. The following different types of behaviour were recorded: grooming, wing fanning, orientating and take-off. The frequency of grooming was significantly higher in the pheromone treatments compared to the control, whereas the frequency of wing fanning and orientating increased, although not significantly. The direction in which the males displayed {{the various types of}} behaviour was more concentrated towards the wind when pheromone was present than during the control experiment. By colour marking of Ecology, Lund University, d travel speed could be calculated. The minimum recorded <b>time</b> from <b>take-off</b> <b>to</b> landing was 1 min, 6 min and 45 min for the 5 m, 50 m and 200 m experiments, respectively. The stimulation and attraction range of the trap was at least 200 m, and the sampling range after 24 hr was calculated to approximately 400 m (c. i. 140 – 1600 m) ...|$|R
