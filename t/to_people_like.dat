Bahnarin Ampatuan, who is also implicated in the Maguindanao massacre case, is the brother of Mamasapano mayor Benzar Ampatuan. Bahnarin and Benzar Amputuan were rivals at the 2010 Mayoral elections.

500|$|With a {{reputation}} for Protestant godliness and connections <b>to</b> <b>people</b> <b>like</b> John Dudley, William Cecil, and Catherine Willoughby, a successful career seemed assured for Day. Unfortunately for Day, Queen Mary ascended the throne in 1553 and the entire religious climate of the country changed. For years, {{it was thought that}} at the accession of Mary, Day fled to the Continent to avoid persecution. However, typographical and other evidence has convinced scholars that Day set up a clandestine press in premises connected to William Cecil in Lincolnshire, [...] and that he continued to print Protestant polemical works under the pseudonym Michael Wood. The [...] "Michael Wood" [...] pamphlets included Protestant writings by Lady Jane Grey, John Hooper, and Stephen Gardiner, and attacks on Mary and her advisors.|$|E
500|$|Though Spielberg {{complied}} with {{a request from}} Zanuck and Brown to cast known actors, he wanted to avoid hiring any big stars. He felt that [...] "somewhat anonymous" [...] performers would help the audience [...] "believe this was happening <b>to</b> <b>people</b> <b>like</b> you and me", whereas [...] "stars {{bring a lot of}} memories along with them, and those memories can sometimes... corrupt the story." [...] The director added that in his plans [...] "the superstar was gonna be the shark". The first actors cast were Lorraine Gary, the wife of then-president of Universal Sid Sheinberg, as Ellen Brody, and Murray Hamilton as the mayor of Amity Island. Stuntwoman-turned-actress Susan Backlinie was cast as Chrissie (the first victim) as she knew how to swim and was willing to perform nude. Most minor roles were played by residents of Martha's Vineyard, where the film was shot. One example was Deputy Hendricks, played by future television producer Jeffrey Kramer.|$|E

500|$|Sebastian {{reflected}} on his song's popularity, [...] "I guess its success {{is due to}} it being a well-written pop ballad, coupled {{with the fact that}} it's perfectly suited to my voice, and also my back-story... It doesn't take a genius to realise that the show was mostly responsible for the songs enormity but still, I'm glad I was the guy standing there at the end singing it". In a review for Sebastian's fifth number one single [...] "Who's That Girl" [...] in 2010 The Vines Tim Byron said [...] "Angels Brought Me Here" [...] was [...] "heavily associated with the climax of the show, and thus [...] pre-packaged meanings and associations that other songs will not ... something of the joy of music, of its eternal mystery, gets leached out in the process". Byron felt there was considerable [...] "controversy over whether to give ARIA awards <b>to</b> <b>people</b> <b>like</b> Guy Sebastian" [...] due to concerns about the artist's credibility. Byron added [...] "But it's hard to argue that Guy Sebastian's continued success, seven years later, {{has much to do with}} Australian Idol.....even his 'brand recognition' will have faded by now.....If he is still successful, it's more and more because of his musical talent." ...|$|E
500|$|A few National Socialist {{black metal}} (NSBM) bands like the Nokturnal Mortum, or Russia's Temnozor and Kroda {{have been known}} to cross over into folk metal, a {{circumstance}} that Ciaran O'Hagan, the vocalist of Waylander, views as [...] "an insult <b>to</b> <b>people</b> <b>like</b> myself who don’t hold with fascist ideals at all." [...] He further suggests that the NSBM bands are playing folk metal [...] "for all the wrong reasons." [...] Due to the misappropriation of pagan symbols by Neo-Nazism, several folk metal bands have also been mistaken for being part of the NSBM scene. Consequently, such bands as Cruachan, Skyforger, Moonsorrow, Månegarm and Týr have had to disassociate themselves with Nazism, fascism or racism. Skyforger went as far as to add the words 'No Nazi Stuff Here!' on the back of their album covers. In April 2008, performers on the folk metal festival Paganfest were subject to accusations of being Nazis, racists and fascists from the German Antifa. Ville Sorvali of Moonsorrow and Heri Joensen of Týr issued a joint video statement to refute these accusations, noting that [...] "one of the biggest issues seems to be that we use ancient Scandinavian symbols in our imagery like the S in the Moonsorrow logo and the T in the Týr logo [...] that is how the S and the T runes have been written for thousands of years." [...] Moonsorrow has also issued a written statement in response to the controversy while Týr notes on their official website that they [...] "got the idea for the rune logo" [...] from the Black Sabbath album of the same name. On {{the other side of the}} political landscape, some folk metal bands have uttered explicit socialist sentiments. For example the aforementioned Glittertind made a leftist statement against neoliberalism in their album booklet when re-releasing the record Til Dovre Faller on Napalm Records in May 2009.|$|E
500|$|In late 2011, Yusef {{manages to}} win his former wife back. They later make plans to get married. Nina Wadia {{explains}} why Zainab is willing to forgive Yusef. Wadia said to Inside Soap: [...] "He tells Zainab that {{he was forced to}} start the fire by his family. Yusef goes on to explain that he knew it was wrong the minute he lit the match, and that he ran into the house to save her. And {{by the end of this}} conversation, she finds herself saying to him, 'Let's get married' - regardless! Obviously, it was something I struggled to get my head around. But being burnt in that fire is what they both have in common - and that experience connects them so deeply. She recognises that he made a mistake but also decides that the whole thing was probably her fault, because she walked out on their marriage." [...] Wadia continued: [...] "It doesn't look like Zainab's going to listen. But as Denise leaves, it's clear she's torn about what to do." [...] A short time before their wedding day arrives, Yusef starts to abuse Zainab both physically and mentally. He forbids Zainab to leave the house and later starts using her son, Kamil, to control her. Wadia explains that she wants the storyline to have a positive impact against real-life violence. She told BBC News :"I think the idea behind showing a strong woman like Zainab changing like this is to show that it can happen to even the strongest of women. They can change and they can be manipulated - especially if they're isolated from their friends and family. The manipulator can take advantage, so it's to prove that it can even happen <b>to</b> <b>people</b> <b>like</b> her. To be honest, if even one woman rings that Action Line at the end of the show and there's some difference made to her life, I'll feel like we've done our job," [...] she continued. [...] "It is a serious issue and I'm glad it's being highlighted. I hope that it wakes anyone up - not just women, I know that there are abused men out there as well. So if it gives anyone the strength to leave a relationship like that, we'll have done our job." [...] The scenes where Yusef refused to let Zainab see Kamil pulled in 8.69m viewers at 7.30pm. BBC Three's repeat of the episode later secured 994k viewers at 10pm.|$|E

2500|$|Despite leaving Apple as {{a day-to-day}} {{employee}} in 1985, Wozniak chose to never remove {{himself from the}} official employee list, and continues to represent the company at events or in interviews. Today he receives a stipend from Apple for this role, estimated to be $120,000 per year. He is also an Apple shareholder. He maintained a friendly acquaintance with Steve Jobs until Jobs' death in October 2011, however, in 2006, Wozniak stated that he and Jobs were not as close {{as they used to}} be. In a 2013 interview, Wozniak said that the original Macintosh [...] "failed" [...] under Steve Jobs, and that it was not until Jobs left that it became a success. He called the Apple Lisa group the team that had kicked Jobs out, and that Jobs liked to call the Lisa group [...] "idiots for making [...] too expensive". To compete with the Lisa, Jobs and his new team produced a cheaper computer, one that, according to Wozniak, was [...] "weak", [...] "lousy" [...] and [...] "still at a fairly high price". [...] "He made it by cutting the RAM down, by forcing you to swap disks here and there", says Wozniak. He attributed the eventual success of the Macintosh <b>to</b> <b>people</b> <b>like</b> John Sculley [...] "who worked to build a Macintosh market when the Apple II went away".|$|E
2500|$|At {{the same}} time that the Lisa was {{becoming}} a GUI machine in 1979, [...] Jef Raskin started the Macintosh project. The design at that time was for a low-cost, easy-to-use machine for the average consumer. Instead of a GUI, it intended to use a text-based user interface that allowed several programs to be running and easily switched between, and special command keys on the keyboard that accessed standardized commands in the programs. Raskin was authorized to start hiring for the project in September 1979, and he immediately asked his long-time colleague, Brian Howard, to join him. His initial team would eventually consist of himself, Howard, Joanna Hoffman, Burrell Smith, and Bud Tribble. The rest of the original Mac team would include Bill Atkinson, Bob Belleville, Steve Capps, George Crow, Donn Denman, Chris Espinosa, Andy Hertzfeld, Bruce Horn, Susan Kare, Larry Kenyon, and Caroline Rose with Steve Jobs leading the project. In a 2013 interview, Steve Wozniak insinuated that he had been leading the initial design and development phase of the Macintosh project until 1981 when he experienced a traumatic airplane crash and temporarily left the company, in which case Jobs took over. In that same interview, Wozniak said that the original Macintosh [...] "failed" [...] under Jobs, and that it was not until Jobs left that it became a success. He attributed the eventual success of the Macintosh <b>to</b> <b>people</b> <b>like</b> John Sculley [...] "who worked to build a Macintosh market when the Apple II went away".|$|E
