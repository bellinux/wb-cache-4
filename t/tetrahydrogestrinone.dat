5|$|Chambers {{claimed that}} his new coach had {{introduced}} him to Conte {{as a way of}} providing him with specialised 'nutritional supplements' - which he took by putting a few drops of liquid under his tongue. Conte had helped develop a type of anabolic steroid called THG, or <b>tetrahydrogestrinone,</b> at BALCO. After Chambers discovered that he had tested positive for drugs he sent his lawyer to meet Conte and make inquires about the supplement he had been ingesting. Conte assured him that all the substances were IAAF compliant.|$|E
25|$|Designer steroids are AAS {{that have}} not been {{approved}} and marketed for medical use but have been distributed through the black market. Examples of notable designer steroids include 1-testosterone (dihydroboldenone), methasterone, trenbolone enanthate, desoxymethyltestosterone, <b>tetrahydrogestrinone,</b> and methylstenbolone.|$|E
25|$|Others {{to later}} have their {{national}} championship results be disqualified for doping were: Regina Jacobs, Damu Cherry, Melissa Price, Tim Montgomery, Calvin Harrison, Alvin Harrison and Kevin Toth. Many of these athlete bans {{were related to}} the BALCO scandal and the use of <b>Tetrahydrogestrinone</b> (THG).|$|E
25|$|Marion Jones, {{winner of}} three gold and two bronze medals for the United States, relinquished them in October 2007 after confessing {{that she had}} taken <b>tetrahydrogestrinone</b> (THG) from September 2000 through July 2001. The IOC {{formally}} stripped Jones and her relay teammates of their 5 medals, although her teammates were to be offered opportunity to present a case for retaining their medals. Eventually, Jones's teammates had their medals reinstated. Jones was also banned from competing for two years by the IAAF.|$|E
25|$|Another {{high-profile}} doping {{case involved}} the 2000 Olympic women's 100m champion Marion Jones, though no doping infractions {{occurred during the}} Olympics. Having {{been one of the}} stars of the games—she won three gold and two bronze medals in track and field events—Jones was later implicated in doping through the BALCO scandal. She lied to federal agents and a grand jury during questioning around the scandal, but later admitted in 2007 to using <b>Tetrahydrogestrinone</b> (THG) during the period of her Olympic success. The IOC annulled all her Olympic results, including her 100m title. Given that the 2000 women's runner-up Ekaterini Thanou had herself been banned for drug usage, the IOC chose not to upgrade her to the gold medal position, but rather leave the position vacant. Working around the dilemma, the IOC decided to raise bronze medallist Tayna Lawrence to joint silver and fourth-placed Merlene Ottey to the bronze medal position.|$|E
500|$|Since 2003, Bonds {{has been}} {{a key figure in}} the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative (BALCO) scandal. BALCO marketed <b>tetrahydrogestrinone</b> ("the Clear"), a [...] performance-enhancing steroid that was {{undetectable}} by doping tests. [...] He was under investigation by a federal grand jury regarding his testimony in the BALCO case, and was indicted on perjury and obstruction of justice charges on November 15, 2007. The indictment alleges that Bonds lied while under oath about his alleged use of steroids.|$|E
5000|$|In 2003, it was {{reported}} that U.S. authorities found e-mails by Victor Conte addressed to Tzekos while searching BALCO (Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative), the California company secretly dealing <b>Tetrahydrogestrinone,</b> an anabolic steroid specially designed so as to make it undetectable under normal drug testing. In addition, according to the respected French paper [...] "L'Equipe," [...] Tzekos was directly dealing with the creator of norbolethone and THG (<b>tetrahydrogestrinone)</b> Patrick Arnold, the father of pro-hormone craze and some undetectable designer steroids.|$|E
50|$|In 2004, the United States Anti-Doping Agency {{announced}} that Toth received a two-year ban following a positive test {{for use of}} <b>tetrahydrogestrinone</b> (THG). Toth subsequently retired from competing.|$|E
50|$|He {{finished}} sixth at the 2002 IAAF World Cup. At the 2003 American championships {{he tested}} positive for the banned substance <b>tetrahydrogestrinone,</b> and was disqualified from his second place.|$|E
5000|$|... "The cream" [...] is a testosterone-based {{ointment}} {{that is used}} {{in conjunction}} with anabolic steroids such as <b>tetrahydrogestrinone</b> (THG, also known as [...] "the clear") in order to mask doping in professional athletes.|$|E

50|$|She {{finished}} twelfth at the 2001 World Championships. At the 2003 American championships she {{tested positive}} for the banned substance <b>tetrahydrogestrinone</b> (THG), and was disqualified from the gold medal. She was suspended by the IAAF from April 2004 to April 2006.|$|E
50|$|The syringe went to Don Catlin, MD, {{the founder}} and then-director of the UCLA Olympic Analytical Laboratory, who had {{developed}} a testing process for the substance, <b>tetrahydrogestrinone</b> (THG). Later that year, the Chicago Tribune named Catlin Sportsman of the Year.|$|E
50|$|The {{androgenic}} {{properties of}} gestrinone are more exploited in its derivative <b>tetrahydrogestrinone</b> (THG; 17α-ethyl-18-methyl-δ9,11-19-nortestosterone), a designer steroid {{which is far}} more potent as both an AAS and progestogen in comparison. THG was banned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2003.|$|E
50|$|Shortly after, Don Catlin, MD, {{the founder}} of the UCLA Olympic Analytical Laboratory, {{developed}} a testing process for <b>tetrahydrogestrinone</b> (THG). Now able to detect the new substance, he tested 550 existing samples from athletes, of which 20 proved to be positive for THG.|$|E

50|$|<b>Tetrahydrogestrinone</b> (THG), often {{referred}} to by its nickname The Clear, is a synthetic, orally active anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) which was never marketed. It was developed by Patrick Arnold and was used {{by a number of}} high-profile athletes such as Marion Jones and Dwain Chambers.|$|E
5000|$|Nandrolone is {{the parent}} {{compound}} {{of a large}} group of AAS. Notable examples include the non-17α-alkylated trenbolone and the 17α-alkylated ethylestrenol (ethylnandrol) and metribolone (R-1881), as well as the 17α-alkylated designer steroids norboletone and <b>tetrahydrogestrinone</b> (THG). The following is list of derivatives of nandrolone that have been developed as AAS: ...|$|E
50|$|Ethyltestosterone, or 17α-ethyltestosterone, {{also known}} as 17α-ethylandrost-4-en-17β-ol-3-one or 17α-pregn-4-en-17-ol-3-one, is a synthetic, orally active anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) of the 17α-alkylated group related to {{methyltestosterone}} which was never marketed. Like methyltestosterone, ethyltestosterone is the parent compound of many AAS. Derivatives of ethyltestosterone include norethandrolone (ethylnandrolone, ethylestrenolone), ethylestrenol (ethylnandrol), norboletone, ethyldienolone, <b>tetrahydrogestrinone,</b> bolenol (ethylnorandrostenol), and propetandrol.|$|E
5000|$|Norboletone {{was found}} to have been brought to the market by the chemist Patrick Arnold, of the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative (BALCO), an American {{nutritional}} supplement company.

50|$|In {{the summer}} of 2003, USADA {{investigators}} received a syringe with trace amounts of a mysterious substance and launched their own investigation. The syringe went to Don Catlin, MD, the founder and then-director of the UCLA Olympic Analytical Laboratory, who had developed a testing process for the substance, <b>tetrahydrogestrinone</b> (THG). He tested 550 existing samples from athletes, of which 20 proved to be positive for THG.|$|E
5000|$|In 2003, {{as part of}} the {{investigation}} of BALCO, he identified and developed a test for <b>tetrahydrogestrinone</b> (THG) or “The Clear,” the second reported designer anabolic steroid. In November 2009, 'Newsweek' named Trevor Graham's decision to send a syringe containing the substance to the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) (which then passed it on to Catlin for analysis) as one of the decade's Top-10 History-Altering Decisions.|$|E
50|$|In 2002, Don Catlin, {{the founder}} and then-director of the UCLA Olympic Analytical Lab, {{identified}} norboletone {{for the first time}} in an athlete’s urine sample. In the same year, U.S. bicycle racer Tammy Thomas was caught using it and was banned from her sport. The following year, Catlin identified and developed a test for <b>tetrahydrogestrinone</b> (THG), the second reported designer anabolic sample—a key development in the BALCO Affair.|$|E

5000|$|In 2003, the United States Attorney for the Northern District of California began {{investigating}} BALCO. U.S. sprint coach Trevor Graham {{had given}} an anonymous {{phone call to}} the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) in June 2003 accusing a number of athletes being involved in doping with a steroid that was not detectable at the time. He also named Victor Conte {{as the source of}} the steroid. As evidence, Graham delivered a syringe containing traces of <b>tetrahydrogestrinone,</b> nicknamed [...] "the Clear." ...|$|E
5000|$|According to Arnold, Victor Conte {{contacted}} him in 2000 seeking undetectable drugs. Arnold offered norbolethone, {{which he}} had synthesized in 1998. About this new venture Arnold recalls [...] "I didn't feel I was jumping into anything more than potential problem with a sports governing body," [...] and motivates his involvement with his curiosity about the responsiveness of well-trained athletes and a little pride in his own work. In 2001 Arnold switched to providing Conte with <b>tetrahydrogestrinone</b> after norbolethone started to draw scrutiny from drug testers.|$|E
50|$|Chambers {{claimed that}} his new coach had {{introduced}} him to Conte {{as a way of}} providing him with specialised 'nutritional supplements' - which he took by putting a few drops of liquid under his tongue.

5000|$|Patrick Arnold is an American {{organic chemist}} known for {{introducing}} androstenedione, 1-androstenediol, and methylhexanamine into the dietary supplement market, and {{for creating the}} designer steroid <b>tetrahydrogestrinone,</b> also known as THG and [...] "the clear". THG, along with two other anabolic steroids that Patrick Arnold manufactured (norbolethone and desoxymethyltestosterone (DMT)), not banned {{at the time of}} their creation, were hard-to-detect drugs at the heart of the BALCO professional sports doping scandal. BALCO distributed these worldwide to world-class athletes in a wide variety of sports ranging from track and field to professional baseball and football.|$|E
50|$|Her doping {{was linked}} to the BALCO doping scandal. After {{returning}} from college to the San Francisco Bay Area in 2000, White's long-time coach, Remi Korchemny, introduced her to BALCO head Victor Conte. White has reported that Conte provided her with products that he identified as supplements and vitamins at first; when he informed her that one was a steroid, she declined to use it then and did not begin doping until after an injury-plagued, losing year in 2002. After being confronted with evidence seized from BALCO, she admitted using <b>tetrahydrogestrinone</b> (THG) and erythropoietin (EPO) in addition to modafinil.|$|E
5000|$|In the BALCO case, she {{had denied}} to federal agents {{her use of}} the steroid <b>Tetrahydrogestrinone,</b> known as [...] "The Clear", or [...] "THG", from 1999, but claimed she was given the {{impression}} she was taking a flaxseed oil supplement for two years while coach Trevor Graham supplied her with the substance. In a published letter, Jones said she had used steroids until she stopped training with Graham {{at the end of}} 2002. She said she lied when federal agents questioned her in 2003 because she panicked when they presented her with a sample of [...] "The Clear".|$|E
5000|$|The Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative (BALCO) (1984-2003) was an American company led by {{founder and}} owner Victor Conte. In 2003, journalists Lance Williams and Mark Fainaru-Wada {{investigated}} the company's {{role in a}} drug sports scandal later {{referred to as the}} BALCO Affair. BALCO marketed <b>tetrahydrogestrinone</b> ("the Clear"), a then-undetected, performance-enhancing steroid developed by chemist Patrick Arnold. Conte, BALCO vice president James Valente, weight trainer Greg Anderson and coach Remi Korchemny had supplied a number of high-profile sports stars from the United States and Europe with [...] "the Clear" [...] and human growth hormone for several years.|$|E
50|$|He {{founded in}} 1984 the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative (BALCO), a sports {{nutrition}} center first located in Millbrae, California and later relocated to Burlingame, California. The United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) says developed the banned steroid <b>tetrahydrogestrinone</b> (THG) {{with the help}} of bodybuilding chemist Patrick Arnold. Pursuant to a plea bargain struck with prosecutors, he entered guilty pleas in July 2005 to one count of conspiracy to distribute steroids and a second count of laundering a portion of a check, he was sentenced in October to spend four months in the federal Taft Correctional Institution in Taft, California, and another four on house arrest.|$|E
50|$|Since {{the closing}} of the 2000 Games, the medal results changed {{following}} a doping scandal involving five-time Olympic medal winner Marion Jones. The American sprinter was stripped of her 1 gold and two bronze medals, by the International Olympic Committee, after confessing, on 5 October 2007, she had taken the anabolic steroid <b>tetrahydrogestrinone</b> before competing in Sydney. Along with the other four medals, the women's 100 metres gold medal has not yet been reallocated, because the presumed recipient, Ekaterini Thanou of Greece, was given a two-year ban for missing a drug test just before the 2004 Summer Olympics, in Athens. However, Jones' teammates on the relay teams had their medals reinstated.|$|E
50|$|Graham first {{played a}} {{critical}} whistleblower role in the BALCO scandal (Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative) of June 2003, anonymously sending a syringe containing the designer steroid <b>Tetrahydrogestrinone</b> to the United States Anti-Doping Agency. The syringe started the investigation. Many others accused him of trying to wipe out a rival. Eventually the investigation came back to Graham, and {{he was charged with}} making false statements about his ties to a steroids distributor. He was convicted on one of three felony charges in May 2008. Graham was convicted of one count of lying to federal investigators. A mistrial was declared on two other counts as jurors could not reach a unanimous agreement. Graham was sentenced to one year of house arrest.|$|E
