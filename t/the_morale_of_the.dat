5|$|But <b>the</b> <b>morale</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Patriot forces was boosted on December19 {{when a new}} {{pamphlet}} titled The American Crisis {{written by}} Thomas Paine, the author of Common Sense, was published.|$|E
5|$|The Canadian Official Historian, C. P. Stacey {{wrote that}} several Canadian {{formations}} reported {{an increase in}} morale. Wilmot wrote that the bombing was essential because it raised <b>the</b> <b>morale</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Second Army and depressed that of the German defenders.|$|E
5|$|The victory lifted <b>the</b> <b>morale</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Christian princes of Europe and was {{recognized}} as a great victory over the Muslim Ottoman Empire. On the Ottoman side, Murad realized the effect Skanderbeg's rebellion would have on his realm and continued to take measures to defeat him, resulting in twenty-five years of war.|$|E
50|$|After seizing two coastal traders off the Nicobar Islands in February 1707, he {{sailed to}} <b>the</b> Straits <b>of</b> Malacca. He fared poorly due to <b>the</b> low <b>morale</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crew {{following}} <b>the</b> incident <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dutch ship.|$|R
50|$|Famously Redmond campaigned in {{his army}} uniform {{and wearing a}} black armband. His victory was <b>the</b> second defeat <b>of</b> Sinn Féin at by-elections and gave a big, albeit temporary, boost to <b>the</b> <b>morale</b> <b>of</b> {{supporters}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Irish Parliamentary Party. Although he retained his seat in <b>the</b> general election <b>of</b> December that year, {{he did not take}} part in the First Dáil.|$|R
25|$|A retreat out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> valley {{would enhance}} <b>the</b> already {{increased}} <b>morale</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> German and Ottoman forces and their {{standing in the}} region, following their Transjordan victories.|$|R
5|$|Another of Harrison's goals was {{to raise}} <b>the</b> <b>morale</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{workforce}} and locomotive engineers; crews {{were assigned to}} the same locomotives, and senior engineers were allowed to paint their names on their engines. When business declined in 1914 Harrison reduced his salary by 20percent, but introduced smaller and graduated cuts for other staff, with the smallest percentages at the lowest pay scales. Other efforts to improve morale included rewards for fuel efficiency and the improvement of safety, including stricter investigation of accidents.|$|E
5|$|As general Yang Pu {{returned}} north {{with his}} soldiers after the Han–Nanyue War in 111 BC, he requested the emperor's permission to annex Dongyue. The emperor refused after he considered <b>the</b> <b>morale</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> troops. Zou Yushan {{had promised to}} supply an army to assist the Han in their war against the Nanyue. The army never arrived and Zou blamed the weather conditions, while secretly maintaining a diplomatic relationship with Nanyue.|$|E
5|$|Muhammad sent three leading Muslims {{to bring}} him details of the recent developments. He advised the men to openly declare their findings, should they find the Banu Qurayza to be loyal, so as to {{increase}} <b>the</b> <b>morale</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Muslim fighters. However, he warned against spreading the news of a possible breach of the pact on the Qurayza's part, {{so as to avoid}} any panic within Muslim ranks.|$|E
50|$|Further {{schooling}} {{was interrupted}} by World War II. He entered the United States Army as a private, and was assigned {{to work in the}} European theater for the Headquarters Information and Education Division, which was a part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Morale</b> Department <b>of</b> <b>the</b> former Department <b>of</b> War. Bromwell served four years, and was discharged as a captain.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> {{majority}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> regiment's time, {{when not}} on expeditions, {{was spent in}} fatigue duty building fortifications around Suffolk. This included digging trenches and clearing trees in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> defensive lines. The hard labor had a detrimental effect on <b>the</b> general <b>morale</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Union troops stationed at Suffolk. This was exacerbated by antagonistic feelings between <b>the</b> civilians <b>of</b> occupied Suffolk and <b>the</b> enlisted men <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 6th Massachusetts.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> high <b>morale</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Arab {{fighters and}} {{politicians}} was {{not shared by}} the Palestinian Arab civilian population. The UN Palestine Commission reported 'Panic continues to increase, however, throughout the Arab middle classes, {{and there is a}} steady exodus of those who can afford to leave the country. 'From December 1947 to January 1948, around 70,000 Arabs fled, and, by <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> March, that number had grown to around 100,000.|$|R
5|$|Song sources likely {{inflated}} {{the number}} of Jin soldiers and casualties at Caishi, but the 18,000 figure for the Song army is plausible. Modern {{studies suggest that the}} battle was smaller and that both sides were more evenly matched than traditional accounts suggest. Nonetheless, the victory boosted <b>the</b> <b>morale</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Song infantry and halted the southern advance of the Jin army.|$|E
5|$|The American colonists {{met their}} goal of {{strengthening}} {{the siege of}} Boston by removing livestock and hay on those islands from {{the reach of the}} British regulars. The British armed schooner Diana was also destroyed and its weaponry was appropriated by the Colonial side. This was the first naval capture of the war, and it was a significant boost to <b>the</b> <b>morale</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Colonial forces.|$|E
5|$|The {{losses at}} Fort Lee and Washington placed a heavy {{toll on the}} Patriots. When they {{evacuated}} their forts, {{they were forced to}} leave behind critical supplies and munitions. Many troops had been killed or taken prisoner, and <b>the</b> <b>morale</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> remaining troops was low. Few believed that they could win the war and gain independence.|$|E
50|$|However, all {{domestic}} {{news coverage}} {{at this time}} was either controlled or else heavily censored by various agencies within the Nazi government. This was especially true of news items (such as the S-Bahn murders) that might damage <b>the</b> war-time <b>morale</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> German people. <b>The</b> Ministry <b>of</b> Public Enlightenment and Propaganda under Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi Party's primary censorship authority, even issued a directive to German journalists regarding limits {{to be placed on}} coverage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> S-Bahn murders.|$|R
50|$|Herbeville's {{army was}} starving, as Bottyán had used scorched-earth tactics against the Austrians {{and all the}} crops on Great Rye Island had been harvested. Nevertheless, <b>the</b> {{fighting}} <b>morale</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> army remained high. All military units were trained, equipped and disciplined, except for the irregular Serbian cavalry. Danish grenadiers, infantry and cavalry fought under Andreas Harboe and general Frederik Gersdorff. Jovan Popović vojvoda <b>of</b> Tököl commanded <b>the</b> Serbian light cavalry. The Austrian-Danish-Serbian army numbered 16,500 men.|$|R
25|$|In 1977 rumours began {{circulating}} in the Rhodesian press that Walls had become deeply pessimistic about <b>the</b> future <b>of</b> Rhodesia, {{and that he}} had been quietly preparing to abandon the country and personally relocate his family into South Africa, and had covertly purchased property there for this purpose. Seeking to scotch these allegations, with the attenuation they would have to <b>the</b> military <b>morale</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> troops still fighting under his command, he publicly issued a denial they had any basis in truth.|$|R
5|$|Alexander had no {{experience}} in affairs of state. However, {{he was determined to}} make the best of a difficult situation and represent his father as best he could. Adopting an air of cool indifference to the government, he rarely made the effort to read official documents before he rubber-stamped them. His functions were limited, and amounted to visiting the Macedonian front to support <b>the</b> <b>morale</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Greek and Allied troops. Since Venizelos's return to power, Athens was at war with the Central Powers, and Greek soldiers battled those of Bulgaria in the north.|$|E
5|$|Although Muraviev's attack failed, {{it forced}} the Polish {{artillery}} {{to lessen the}} pressure on the Russian Grand Battery, which was now free to support the main Russian attack on the westernmost Polish defences. By that time the Grand Battery could shell the ramparts of the second line with relative impunity, thus damaging both the defences and <b>the</b> <b>morale</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crews. Polish infantrymen manning the forts were ordered to lie down behind the gabions, which minimised the losses. Soldiers in the field had no such cover, and suffered casualties. The Grand Battery also silenced some of the guns in Forts 21, 22 and 23.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the battle}} was over and Radzymin was secure, the Soviet forces {{continued}} to threaten the Polish northern flank. In {{the early hours of}} August 16 the Russians mounted yet another assault on Radzymin, reinforced by several armoured cars and led personally by the commanding officer of the 27th Rifle Division, Vitovt Putna. However, by this time <b>the</b> <b>morale</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 27th Division was already broken, and the assault was easily thwarted by the Polish infantry and the three remaining operational FT tanks. The armoured cars withdrew as soon as the Polish tanks opened fire, and the Russian infantry followed.|$|E
50|$|As things happened, <b>the</b> {{constant}} raids <b>of</b> Royalist guerrillas, <b>the</b> harshness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> terrain, <b>the</b> lack <b>of</b> promised reinforcements from Antioquia, and {{the delays}} in bringing up his army's artillery contributed to weakening <b>the</b> <b>morale</b> <b>of</b> many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> troops under Nariño's command, {{when they had}} practically reached <b>the</b> gates <b>of</b> Pasto.|$|R
500|$|Philip's first {{priorities}} were {{to reconstruct the}} Macedonian army, and restore <b>the</b> <b>morale</b> <b>of</b> both <b>the</b> army and the people. He held a series <b>of</b> assemblies with <b>the</b> Macedonian people, and [...] "exhorting them with eloquent speeches to be men, he built up their morale". He exhaustively re-trained his men with new tactics and equipment. In particular, he instigated <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> phalanx formation by the Macedonian foot-soldiery, and equipped the troops with 6 metre long pikes (the sarissa), {{in contrast to the}} 2–3 metre spear (doru) used by Greek hoplites.|$|R
50|$|For the Danes, <b>the</b> {{successful}} defense <b>of</b> <b>the</b> position {{prevented the}} encirclement and entrapment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Danish army at Danevirke. <b>The</b> victory boosted <b>the</b> <b>morale</b> <b>of</b> both <b>the</b> {{troops and the}} general public, but unfortunately it also strengthened <b>the</b> perception <b>of</b> Danevirke as an impenetrable defense line. Consequently, the victory here increased the outrage felt {{by the general public}} when only four days later General de Meza ordered the Danish army to retreat from Danevirke. General Gerlach who held command <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1st Division defending Mysunde reluctantly assumed overall command <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Danish army after <b>the</b> dismissal <b>of</b> De Meza.|$|R
5|$|As {{a result}} of Tallon's finger injury, Saggers made his Test debut in the Fourth Test, which started at Headingley on 22 July 1948. As England made 496runs in their first innings, Saggers took catches to remove Denis Compton for 23, caught down the leg side, and Jim Laker for four. During the innings, Saggers was noted by Fingleton for {{maintaining}} a quiet presence behind the stumps, whereas Tallon was characteristically known for loudly appealing {{in concert with the}} bowler when he was playing. Fingleton felt that Saggers' failure to appeal dampened <b>the</b> <b>morale</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bowlers, who were vocally supported by Tallon in the other four Tests. Australia conceded 496 runs but Saggers leaked only two byes.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 1973, {{there was}} serious debate among the Hanoi {{leadership}} over future military policy as the Central Committee of the Lao Động Party convened to assess the progress of its efforts in the south. General Văn Tiến Dũng, PAVN chief of staff, and Defence Minister Võ Nguyên Giáp strongly urged the resumption of conventional military operations, warning that increasing passivity would affect <b>the</b> <b>morale</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> army. Premier Phạm Văn Đồng, however, feared resuming operations would drain vital resources needed for reconstruction in the north.|$|E
5|$|Bergonzoli {{knew that}} if Bardia and Tobruk held out, a British advance further into Libya {{eventually}} must falter under the logistical difficulties of maintaining a desert force using an extended overland supply line. Not knowing how long he had to hold out, Bergonzoli was forced to ration his stocks {{of food and water}} so that O'Connor could not simply starve him out. Consequently, hunger and thirst adversely affected <b>the</b> <b>morale</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Italian defenders that had already been shaken by the defeat at Sidi Barrani. So too did medical conditions undermine morale, particularly lice and dysentery, the results of poor sanitation.|$|E
2500|$|To uplift <b>the</b> <b>morale</b> {{and spirit}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{students}} and victims <b>of</b> school <b>the</b> chief <b>of</b> Army Staff General Raheel Sharif himself attended <b>the</b> morning assembly <b>of</b> <b>the</b> school and confirmed them that no such incident will ever occur in Pakistan again [...] they will break <b>the</b> backbone <b>of</b> Taliban.|$|R
50|$|However <b>the</b> failure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{strike was}} not solely from violence, well-organized public relations, or <b>the</b> failing <b>morale</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> strikers. Right before the Little Steel strike began, the economy had slipped {{back into a}} slight depression, causing less demand for steel. Fewer {{employees}} were needed to satisfy the decreased demand. The SWOC {{was not able to}} use lost profits as a bargaining tool. It was aggressive strike breaking tactics from Little Steel, lack of organization from SWOC, and demoralized unionists that made the strike end by <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> summer <b>of</b> 1937 with <b>the</b> companies victorious.|$|R
25|$|The {{principal}} Japanese {{headquarters in}} Burma, the Burma Area Army, under Lieutenant General Hyotaro Kimura, was situated in Rangoon. There were no Japanese fighting formations {{stationed in the}} city, but there were large numbers of line of communication troops and naval personnel. There was also a substantial contingent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Indian National Army, a force composed mainly of former Indian prisoners of war captured by the Japanese in Malaya, which sought to overthrow British rule in India. Although some units <b>of</b> <b>the</b> INA had fought tenaciously in <b>the</b> Japanese invasion <b>of</b> India in 1944 and in central Burma, <b>the</b> <b>morale</b> <b>of</b> most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> INA was low by this point in <b>the</b> war. Many <b>of</b> its soldiers were convinced by early 1945 that Japanese defeat was inevitable, and deserted or capitulated readily during the Allied advance on Rangoon.|$|R
5|$|For the Royal Air Force, Proud had caves {{dug into}} the sides of a wadi to hide two of the Hurricanes. The third was hidden in a hole beside the runway, the same shape as the {{aircraft}}, and covered by a lid and some tents. Dummy aircraft and hangars were constructed to draw fire; these were marked as real on marked-up air photographs captured with a Luftwaffe airman. The aircraft all survived the siege, important both for air defence and for maintaining <b>the</b> <b>morale</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> defending troops.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the ferocity}} of the Russian defense, {{everyone}} was aware that {{such a move would}} cost the lives of thousands of Guardsmen, but it was thought that the presence of this prestigious unit would bolster <b>the</b> <b>morale</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> entire army for a final decisive push. A notable exception was Marshal Bessières, commander of the Guard cavalry, {{who was one of the}} very few senior generals to strongly advise against the intervention of the Guard. As the general staff were discussing the matter, general Rapp, a senior aide-de-camp to the Emperor, was being brought from the field of battle, having been wounded in action.|$|E
5|$|Godley's II ANZAC Corps {{played an}} {{important}} role in the Passchendaele offensive in October 1917. Following the success of his corps at the Battle of Broodseinde on 4 October 1917, Godley believed <b>the</b> <b>morale</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Germans was low, and pushed for further attacks to secure the Passchendaele Ridge. This was in concert with the preference of Field Marshal Douglas Haig, the commander of the British Expeditionary Force. However, Godley's superior officer, General Herbert Plumer, preferred to halt the offensive as the weather had deteriorated immediately after the battle. An attack on 9 October by the 49th and 66th Divisions, both British formations attached to II ANZAC Corps, was hampered by the poor weather which showed no signs of abating and achieved very limited gains.|$|E
2500|$|During <b>the</b> {{struggle}} <b>of</b> {{independence in}} 1945 to 1949, {{it was used}} as a national salute of victory and honor, by raising open palms as high as the head and shouting out loud [...] "Merdeka!" [...] From here many slogans came, such as [...] "Sekali Merdeka tetap Merdeka!" [...] (Freedom once and for all) or [...] "Merdeka atau Mati" [...] (Freedom or death). This was intended to raise <b>the</b> <b>morale</b> <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> people <b>of</b> Indonesia to continue to fight against the Dutch and the Allied forces trying to re-establish control over Indonesia; it was so important that even it became a Government Edict on 31 August 1945.|$|R
50|$|After {{examining}} the 101 propositions condemned by Unigenitus Dei Filius, Noailles determined that as {{set out in}} Unigenitus Dei Filius and apart from their context in <b>the</b> Réflexions <b>morales,</b> some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> propositions condemned by Unigenitus Dei Filius were in fact orthodox. He therefore refused to accept the apostolic constitution and instead sought clarifications from the pope.|$|R
25|$|Nonetheless, <b>the</b> {{impact on}} <b>morale</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{fact that the}} Germans were {{effectively}} fighting back in the air created a major scandal in the British parliament and press. <b>The</b> ascendancy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Eindecker {{also contributed to the}} surprise the Germans were able to achieve at <b>the</b> start <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Battle <b>of</b> Verdun because <b>the</b> French reconnaissance aircraft failed to provide their usual cover <b>of</b> <b>the</b> German positions.|$|R
