The major objective of the current work is to develop a numerically generated <b>tangent</b> <b>stiffness</b> matrix that allows for a general and easily implementable solution method. The thesis begins with the definition of the <b>tangent</b> <b>stiffness</b> matrix and a discussion of the Newton-Raphson incremental-iterative method typically used to solve geometrically non-linear problems.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A general {{method for}} the large {{deflection}} analysis of inelastic plane frames is presented. The large deflection analysis {{is based on the}} Eulerian formulation in which a member <b>tangent</b> <b>stiffness</b> matrix is constructed with reference to the current deformed configuration. The exact differential equation and the moment-thrust-curvature relations of a member subjected to large relative deflection are used for deriving the member <b>tangent</b> <b>stiffness</b> matrix. A member <b>tangent</b> <b>stiffness</b> matrix for W-sections of elasto-plastic material is constructed as an example and its application to the large deflection analysis of inelastic frames is demon-strated by several examples. A simple form of the member <b>tangent</b> <b>stiffness</b> matrix is deduced from the above exact formulation by utilizing the assumption of small member relative deflections. It is shown that the simple one can yield excellent results compared to those obtained by the exact formulation.

40|$|A {{computationally}} efficient mesh objective algorithm for modeling mode-I cracks {{is developed}} and implemented within a standard finite element formulation. The algorithm applies the crack opening displacements across the standard nodal {{degrees of freedom}} {{that is consistent with}} formalism of the conventional smeared crack approach. Various versions of the conventional smeared crack approach have been proposed since the introduction of the finite element method. The approach has not been successful for the following reasons: (i) accumulation of spurious shear resulting in stress locking, (ii) misalignment of the stress field around the cracked element, and (iii) incorrect prediction of the crack propagation direction. Four new and distinct techniques are developed to preclude both spurious shear accumulation and misalignment of the stress field around the crack tip to provide mesh objective results. First, to preclude shear locking, a modified failure constitutive model is developed, which derives an alternative for the stress increment rather than using the full strain field of the cracked element. The crack orientation is held fixed after crack initiation to provide an accurate representation of the crack orientation and resulting crack path. A <b>tangent</b> crack <b>stiffness</b> is derived to provide an explicit update for the stress components without the need for an iterative solver for both linear and nonlinear softening. Next, a computationally efficient crack tracking algorithm is implemented to preclude the misalignment of the stress field. The tracking algorithm uses the crack orientation predicted from the failure model and a series of crack segments to define the crack path. An hourglass control method is developed for an element undergoing softening. The <b>tangent</b> crack <b>stiffness</b> is used to derive hourglass forces that help obtain mesh objectivity when one-point quadrature is applied. Finally, a cross-over scaling method is used to provide the correct characteristic crack length to obtain complete mesh objectivity. The developed methods work collectively to provide a fully explicit and efficient algorithm for modeling mode-I failure in brittle materials without mesh bias. It is demonstrated that the algorithm predicts load deflection curves and crack paths that are independent of both mesh size and orientation when modeling failure at an angle through a finite element mesh. The methods developed are expected to be applicable to higher dimensions and for mode-II failure. Sandia National LaboratoriesMechanical EngineeringDoctoralUniversity of New Mexico.

MEMS micropumps, switches, memory cells) to produce relatively high displacements and forces with low actuation energies. We investigate the use of distributed multiparameter actuation to control the buckling and postbuckling behavior of a three-layer piezoelectric beam pinned at either end. A two-parameter bending actuation controls the transversal motion, whilst an axial actuation and a beam end-shortening modulate the <b>tangent</b> bending <b>stiffness.</b> The postbuckling behavior is studied by reducing to a 2 dof system a nonlinear extensible elastica model. When the bending actuation is spatially symmetric, the postbuckling phenomena are analogue to those obtained for a transversal midspan force, being characterized by a snap-through instability. The use of a two-parameter actuation opens new transition scenarios, where {{it is possible to}} get true quasi-static transitions between the two specular equilibria of the buckled beam, without any instability phenomenon.

In the case of an isotropic orientation of cracks, it is shown that the influence of cracks on the overall poroelastic properties is governed by the crack density parameter which characterizes the distribution of aspect ratios.

Firstly the numerical simulation of longitudinal compressive failure is conducted. The simulated results show that at one moment of the loading, the localized deformation catastrophically appears in the material, and in this initiation of the localized deformation, the reduction of <b>tangent</b> shear <b>stiffness</b> plays an important role. Secondly the theoretical modeling of longitudinal compressive failure is implemented. A set of mathematical equations is obtained for the deformation of composite materials, and the mathematical solution of the equations is considered. There exists a state where arbitrariness appears in the solution of equations expressing deformation of composite materials, and it is indicated that the onset of arbitrariness in solution of equations expressing deformation of composite materials is closely related with the initiation of longitudinal compressive failure, and also related with the initiation of narrow localized band in the materials. Finally the numerical simulation is conducted for compressive failure in quasi-isotropic laminate.

The relations underlying the TFA averaging scheme are recalled. The evaluation of the corresponding consistent <b>tangent</b> homogenised <b>stiffness,</b> required in acoustic tensor-based localisation analysis, is also derived. The average RVE mechanical response is performed for two sets of micro-mechanical material laws for mortar joints, based on both damage and damage coupled with plasticity. For these two sets of fine-scale laws, localisation analyses are performed for RVEs under stress proportional loading, showing that meaningful average localisation orientations are properly detected by the acoustic tensor-based loss of ellipticity criterion. Furthermore, the capability of the pure damage micromechanical model combined with TFA to reproduce the failure envelope of typically running bond masonry subjected to uniform biaxial loads is demonstrated through a comparison with available experimental data. Finally, the energetic aspects for the selection of localised solutions are discussed. As a result, the TFA-based averaging scheme is shown to yield meaningful homogenised localisation results, thereby allowing envisioning its use in nested multi-scale computations. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
