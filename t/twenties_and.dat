5|$|Heian {{women were}} {{traditionally}} excluded from learning Chinese, the written language of government, but Murasaki, raised in her erudite father's household, showed a precocious aptitude for the Chinese classics {{and managed to}} acquire fluency. She married in her mid-to late <b>twenties</b> <b>and</b> {{gave birth to a}} daughter before her husband died, two years after they were married. It is uncertain when she began to write The Tale of Genji, but it was probably while she was married or shortly after she was widowed. In about 1005, Murasaki was invited to serve as a lady-in-waiting to Empress Shōshi at the Imperial court, probably because of her reputation as a writer. She continued to write during her service, adding scenes from court life to her work. After five or six years, she left court and retired with Shōshi to the Lake Biwa region. Scholars differ on the year of her death; although most agree on 1014, others have suggested she was alive in 1031.|$|E
5|$|Mehldau's first {{recording}} was for Hollyday's The Natural Moment in 1991; {{his first}} tour of Europe was {{also with the}} saxophonist that year. Mehldau's interest in classical music returned {{when he was in}} his early <b>twenties,</b> <b>and</b> spurred him into developing his left-hand playing. He led his own trio from at least 1992, when he played at New York's Village Gate. Mehldau also played as sideman with a variety of musicians around this time. His performances with saxophonist Perico Sambeat included a tour of Europe early in 1993, and Mehldau's first released recordings as co-leader, from a May concert in Barcelona. Mehldau also toured for 18 months with saxophonist Joshua Redman. This association began in 1993, but they had played together for a short period the previous year. Redman and his band attracted attention, with their 1994 album Moodswing also aiding Mehldau's profile. They also played together for the soundtrack to the 1994 film Vanya on 42nd Street, for which Redman wrote the music.|$|E
