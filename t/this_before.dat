5|$|As is {{discussed}} below, {{the reason for}} the delay was probably simply that neither the Athenians nor the Persians were willing to risk battle initially. This then raises the question of why the battle occurred when it did. Herodotus explicitly tells us that the Greeks attacked the Persians (and the other sources confirm this), {{but it is not clear}} why they did <b>this</b> <b>before</b> the arrival of the Spartans. There are two main theories to explain this.|$|E
5|$|Fortune-West {{was born}} in Stratford, London and grew up as a {{supporter}} of Leyton Orient. He started his football career in non-League football with Tiptree United in the Eastern Counties League aged 17, with whom he played one season, filling the roles of full back, centre back and striker. He moved onto Bishop's Stortford and joined Dartford in the season they went out of business. A period at Dagenham & Redbridge followed <b>this</b> <b>before</b> he signed for Stevenage Borough in the Football Conference in 1994. He scored 7 goals in 17 league appearances for Stevenage in 1994–95, after which he moved into the Football League with Gillingham on 12 July 1995. The fee of £5,000 was raised for the cash-strapped club by its Supporters' Club. Becoming a full-time professional necessitated giving up a degree course at the University of Greenwich.|$|E

5|$|Shin Megami Tensei II was {{developed}} by Atlus for the Super Famicom. It was directed by Koji Okada, produced by Hideyuki Yokoyama, and written by Ryutaro Ito, with music composed by Tsukasa Masuko. Kazuma Kaneko designed the game's characters, but was also involved in the planning phase. During the game's pre-production, the development staff visited Hariti's temple in Zōshigaya and Taira no Masakado's grave to cleanse themselves. They had done <b>this</b> <b>before,</b> first during {{the development of the}} first Shin Megami Tensei; after one of the staff members got robbed, they decided to do it regularly.

5|$|When Leo IV died in October 780, his {{sole heir}} {{was the young}} Constantine VI, his son by the Empress Irene of Athens. Due to Constantine's being underage, a regency was instituted under Irene, {{but this was not}} well {{received}} among leading officials. Not only was rule by a woman alien to the military-dominated establishment of the time, but Irene was also a confirmed iconophile, an adherent of the veneration of holy images. This was regarded as heresy by the state-sponsored doctrine of Iconoclasm, which was especially popular with the army and the officials loyal to Constantine V's memory. A number of them, including the Postal Logothete (foreign minister) Gregory, the former strategos (governor) of the Anatolic Theme Bardas and Constantine, the commander of the Excubitors guard regiment, consequently favoured the rise of Nikephoros to the imperial throne. Barely {{a month and a half}} after Leo's death, the plot was discovered. Irene had the conspirators exiled, and Nikephoros and his younger brothers were ordained as priests, removing them from the line of succession. To confirm <b>this</b> <b>before</b> the people, on Christmas Day 780, Nikephoros and his brothers were forced to perform the communion service in the Hagia Sophia.|$|E
5|$|When {{thinking}} {{on how to}} write about true love, Akahori considered laughingly that in normal relationships between boys and girls, it eventually tends towards having sex. In order to avoid this, he chose to have a cast of female main characters, but he felt that audiences have experienced <b>this</b> <b>before</b> and that it thus would not be enough. This is when he thought {{up the idea of}} changing the main character from a boy to a girl. Akahori knew this would be a problem, since normally changing a person's gender would cause complications, one of them being that the now-female character would invariably want to return to being male. He knew that there were a few problems that could not be avoided, but he wanted to remove the desire to turn back into a male. For this reason, Akahori devised that the character would not want to turn back into a male if there was the impact of the entire world already having accepted the fact that his gender had changed. To do this, Akahori decided to have the alien who crashed into the character to not only revive the character as a female, but to broadcast this over the entire world, which is what happens at the beginning of Kashimashi. Afterwards, Akahori felt it necessary to expand on the alien's role in the story. At this point in the development process, Akahori felt he could now begin writing the story.|$|E

25|$|Newly bought {{fabric is}} often washed before being cut or sewn. If not pre-washed, {{there is a}} risk of the fabric dyes {{bleeding}} during later washing. Many fabric manufacturers take this into account and have taken steps to prevent color-bleeding.

25|$|O’Sullivan and {{her colleagues}} {{assessed}} 180 girls {{between the ages of}} 12 and 14 on their perceptions on what their first sexual encounters would be like; many girls reported feeling negative emotions towards sex before their first time. The researchers think this is because adolescent girls are taught that society views adolescent pre-marital sex in negative terms. When they reported positive feelings, the most commonly listed one was feeling attractive. This shows how many girls objectify their own bodies and often think about <b>this</b> <b>before</b> they think of their own sexual desires and needs.|$|E
