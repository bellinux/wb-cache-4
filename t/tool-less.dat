60|$|Well, if Mr. Max Muller 'gladly subscribes,' in p. 15, to the {{postulate}} of {{an original}} universal stage of savagery, whence civilised races inherit their incredibly repulsive myths, why, in pp. 197, 198, does he denounce that very postulate as not proven, {{not capable of}} being proved, very mischievous, {{and one of the}} evils resulting from our method of comparing savage and civilised rites and beliefs? I must be permitted to complain that I do not know which is Mr. Max Muller's real opinion--that given with such hearty conviction in p. 15, or that stated with no less earnestness in pp. 197, 198. I trust that I shall not be thought to magnify a mere slip of the pen. Both passages--though, as far as I can see, self-contradictory--appear to be written with the same absence of levity. Fontenelle, I own, speaks of Greeks, not Semites, as being originally savages. But I pointed out {124} that he considered it safer to 'hedge' by making an exception of the Israelites. There is really nothing in Genesis against the contention that the naked, <b>tool-less,</b> mean, and frivolous Adam was a savage.|$|E
60|$|But {{his best}} story {{was about a}} race of men (if men they were) who seemed so fully to realize Swift's wicked fable of the Yahoos, that my friend was much {{exercised}} with psychological speculations whether or no they had any souls. They dwelt {{in the wilds of}} Ceylon, like other savage beasts, hairy, and spotted with tufts of fur, filthy, shameless, weaponless (though warlike in their individual bent), <b>tool-less,</b> houseless, language-less, except for a few guttural sounds, hideously dissonant, whereby they held some rudest kind of communication among themselves. They lacked both memory and foresight, and were wholly destitute of government, social institutions, or law or rulership of any description, except the immediate tyranny of the strongest; radically untamable, moreover, save that the people of the country managed to subject a few of the less ferocious and stupid ones to outdoor servitude among their other cattle. They were beastly in almost all their attributes, and that {{to such a degree that}} the observer, losing sight of any link betwixt them and manhood, could generally witness their brutalities without greater horror than at those of some disagreeable quadruped in a menagerie. And yet, at times, comparing what were the lowest general traits in his own race with what was highest in these abominable monsters, he found a ghastly similitude that half compelled him to recognize them as human brethren.|$|E
6000|$|This {{process is}} {{especially}} {{manifest in the}} laws of forbidden degrees in marriage--laws whose complexity among the Australians or North American Indians [...] "might puzzle a mathematician," [...] and whose simplicity in a civilised country seems transparent even to a child. But while the elaborateness and stringency of savage customary law point to a more, and not a less barbarous past, they also indicate a past of untold duration. Somewhere in that past also {{it is evident that}} the savage must have been even worse off materially than he is at present. Even now he can light a fire; he has a bow, or a boomerang, or a blowpipe, and has attained very considerable skill in using his own rough tools of flint and his weapons tipped with quartz. Now man was certainly not born in the possession of fire; he did not come into the world with a bow or a boomerang in his hand, nor with an instinct which taught him to barb his fishing-hooks. These implements he had to learn to make and use, and till he had learned to use them and make them his condition must necessarily have been more destitute of material equipment than that of any races known to us historically. Thus all that can be inferred about the past of savages is that it was of vast duration, and that at one period man was more materially destitute, and so far more struggling and forlorn, than the Murri of Australia were when first discovered by Europeans. Even then certain races may have had intellectual powers and potentialities beyond those of other races. Perhaps the first fathers of the white peoples of the North started with better brains and bodies than the first fathers of the Veddahs of Ceylon; but they all started naked, <b>tool-less,</b> fire-less. The only way of avoiding these conclusions is to hold-that men, or some favoured races of man, were created with civilised instincts and habits of thought, and were miraculously provided with the first necessaries of life, or were miraculously instructed to produce them without passing through slow stages of experiment, invention and modification. But we might as well assume, with some early Biblical commentators, that the naked Adam in Paradise was miraculously clothed in a vesture of refulgent light. Against such beliefs we have only to say that they are without direct historical confirmation of any kind.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. New {{manufacturing}} methods involving direct fabrication processes seem ideal for mass customization or “just-in-time ” production. The use of <b>tool-less</b> {{means of production}} ensures reduced lead-time and lower cost. Besides, they provide flexibility in design and fabrication, which are essential for small lot sizes. However, part quality and production reliability are challenges that must be met. When adapted to the micro-factory paradigm, direct manufacturing can be made portable and capable of remote manufacturing. The benefits of miniaturization are savings in materials and energy consumption, but the increased surface {{area to volume ratio}} has implications for material behavior, especially mechanical strength. The newest incarnation of direct manufacturing is direct digital manufacturing or DDM, which involves localized deposition of material or energy and the creation of heterogeneous objects with digital means of control. DDM seeks spatial control of macrostructure, composition, texture and properties with the possibility of producing materials with unusual behavior, functionally gradient structures and integrated component devices. For DDM, multi-material design, precision in deposition, shaping and removal and understanding of heterogeneous material behavior are challenges...|$|E

Since, both processes remove material through melting and vaporization, machining is always accompanied with heat affected zone. Since different materials have different thermo-physical properties, the plasma discharge energy level for minimal HAZ is material-dependent. The plasma discharge energy level corresponding to minimal HAZ can be experimentally determined by examining the dependence of the spatial distribution of the transient temperature response near the machined zone on the energy level. This paper, for the first time, presents an experimental investigation on real time measurement of the transient temperature response during single discharge machining at different pulse energy levels by the micro-EDM and the LIP-MM processes. The experimental data establishes a relationship between the pulse energy level and the transient temperature response and thus can be used for identifying the conditions for minimal HAZ in the two processes...|$|E

40|$|Metal matrix {{composites}} (MMC) offer relatively higher specific strength, specific stiffness, lower {{coefficient of}} thermal expansion (CTE) and lower density {{as compared with}} conventional alloys. These unique properties make them very attractive for aerospace turbomachinery applications where there is ever increasing emphasis to reduce weight and cost, and to increase engine performance. Through a joint effort between NASA and Metal Matrix Cast Composites, Inc., a complex liquid oxygen (LOX) compatible turbopump housing is being redesigned and manufactured from hybrid (particulate and Fibers) Aluminum MMC. To this end, a revolutionary <b>tool-less</b> pressure infiltration casting technology is being perfected. Ceramic preforms for the composite are 3 -dimensionally printed using a stereolithography file, acquired from a CAD model. The preforms are then invested into a refractory material and pressure infiltrated with liquid metal. After casting, the refractory material is washed away leaving behind a near net-shape composite part. Benefits of this process include increased composite uniformity, no mold machining, short time from design to part properties matching traditional methods, ability to make previously impossible to manufacture parts and no size limitations with a newly developed joining technology.

In addition, current {{studies on the}} polishing of free-abrasives mainly focused on the movement and control of a single abrasive grain, and research into the different parts has been lacking. The shape and structure of a spiral groove restrict its use as a polishing tool. Therefore, the free-abrasive grain of <b>tool-less</b> finishing is {{an effective way to}} improve the surface quality and accuracy of the shape of a non–machined spiral groove. In this paper, the spiral groove of a revolving body is taken as the research object. A method used to make a helical movement of a workpiece, and cut and polish an abrasive grain, is proposed. The principle of the relative motion of the abrasive ball trajectory is studied. The trajectory and design helix are in concordance with a mathematical model. The grooved drum parts were polished and tested to verify that not only can the error {{in the shape of the}} helical groove be corrected but the surface roughness of the helical groove can also be reduced, and the helical groove of the rotating body can be repaired and polished, providing a theoretical basis for free-abrasive tool polishing without a modification.|$|E
40|$|An {{additive}} manufacturing technique for high-strength oxide ceramics is presented. Based on {{selective laser melting}} (SLM), a new approach has been developed that allows for <b>tool-less</b> manufacturing of complex shaped ceramic components directly from CAD data. Components are built layer by layer in a powder bed. In the new approach, a purely ceramic powder is completely melted by a laser beam. The powder does not contain any binder or glassy or metallic additives. This way, a density of the ceramic component of almost 100 % is achieved directly by the SLM process, without any post-sintering, and thus without any shrinkage. The ceramic component is created by solidification from melt. In order to avoid crack formation, the ceramic is preheated to a temperature above 1600 °C during the whole build-up process. Using a zirconia-alumina (ZrO 2 - Al 2 O 3) material, a fine-grained microstructure can be achieved and specimens with a flexural strength of more than 500 MPa have been manu factured. Complex shaped ceramic components have been manufactured for demonstration purposes. The build-up rate is {{comparable to that of}} SLM for metallic materials. The development of the technique is not yet completed and is still ongoing. The technique {{has the potential to be}} used e. g. for manufacturing ceramic functional prototypes, all-ceramic dental restorations or complicated geometries that can not be manufactured by conventional techniques...|$|E
30|$|When {{a spiral}} groove is formed using superplastic molding, {{precision}} casting, additive manufacturing, or other non-mechanical processing technology, {{it is difficult}} to meet the molding precision required for direct use, and the surface quality and accuracy of the shape need to be improved through a finishing process. In view of the poor reachability of the current tool-based polishing process, a <b>tool-less</b> polishing method using free-abrasive grains for complex spiral grooves is proposed. With this method, by controlling the movement of the workpiece, the design basis and relative motion of the abrasive particles along a helical path remain consistent, resulting in a better polishing profile. A spiral groove of a revolving body is taken as the research object; the influence of the installation method and the position of the parts, as well as the effect of the rotational speed of the abrasive ball on its relative motion along a helical trajectory, are studied, and the polishing cutting process of an abrasive ball is reasonably simplified. A consistent mathematical model of the trajectory of an abrasive ball relative to the design helix is constructed. The grooved drum parts are verified through a polishing experiment. The spiral groove of the revolving body is modified and polished. Experiments show that the process not only corrects the shape a spiral groove error, but also reduces the surface roughness of a spiral groove. This study provides a theoretical basis for achieving free-abrasive, tool-free polishing.|$|E
40|$|Part 3 : Additive ManufacturingInternational audienceThe key-feature all {{additive}} manufacturing processes {{have in common}} is parts being built up in layers. Due to this <b>tool-less</b> build-up principle, the degree of freedom in design is huge compared to conventional manufacturing processes. For instance rear sections, inner cavities, conformal cooling-channels and lightweight-structures can be realized without a significant rise of manufac-turing-costs. However there are some specific limitations coming along with the layer-wise build-up. Depending on layer-thickness and the orientation of a surface, the so-called stair-step effect occurs with different levels of intensity. Furthermore some {{additive manufacturing}} processes have to use support-structures. These structures are used to hold the part in place or to lead the pro-cess heat away from the melting-zone. In order to convey these limitations and to show how de-tailed and filigree parts can be generated, a test-specimen has been designed that suits processes with- and without support-structures. The geometry of the specimen‘s bottom side contains chamfers and notches, so the amount of necessary supports is kept as low as possible and the specimen can be separated from its build-platform without complications. Furthermore, the specimen is designed as a web of test-areas, connected by bars. This way the curling effect that often leads to aborts in additive manufacturing processes is prevented and thus cannot have an influence on the geometries tested on the speci-men. The presentation is about showing first test results of Laser Beam Melted, Laser Sintered and Fused Layer Modeled specimens that have been evaluated by sight test and measured by a coordinate measuring machine. In addition the content of the individual test-areas will be ex-plained...|$|E
