500|$|Koechlin {{starred in}} Shonali Bose's drama Margarita with a Straw, playing Laila, {{a young woman}} with {{cerebral}} palsy who leaves her home in India to study in New York City, unexpectedly falls in love, and embarks on a journey of self-discovery. Her character was inspired by Malini Chib, Bose's cousin. Bose first approached Koechlin, who she said was her [...] "first and only choice", for the role when the latter was shooting for Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewaani. Due to the clashing schedule Bose went on to audition other actresses to substitute Koechlin, but felt that [...] "something was missing" [...] in each one, and she eventually decided to push the filming for three months to accommodate her. In an interview with the Times of India, Koechlin acknowledged that the role was the most challenging of her film career, and she took six months off her filming schedule to prepare for it. She underwent a six-week <b>training</b> <b>workshop</b> with actor Adil Hussain. The workshop aimed at making her [...] "body language seem natural", while also focusing on the speech pattern of patients with cerebral palsy. Koechlin spent considerable time with Chib and her physiotherapist and speech therapist. She also attended a month-long workshop in Delhi, where she worked on the movement of the body parts. Although the film covers aspects of physical disability, Koechlin dubbed it [...] "a romcom with some hurdles".|$|E

2500|$|The Lahore zoo, {{with the}} {{assistance}} of its education office in particular, provides research facilities and supports relevant studies at the zoo. Scores of students from University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences and University of the Punjab work in collaboration with Lahore zoo to complete their research projects and internships. As a prime example, the zoo provided direct assistance to a research project with the kind approval of Director General Wildlife and Parks Department, Punjab. The study was conducted by a BS.Hons student of Department of Zoology, University of the Punjab. The researcher, Sana Ahmed, presented her synopsis as to study the public perception about the zoo and the role it plays to enhance the visitors' experience. The study included a survey from more than 200 zoo visitors, questioning them about different zoo facilities, animal species kept at zoo and about their experiences and suggestions. The study provided a useful insight to how visitors perceive the zoo. Likewise, it helped the zoo in shaping future strategies to design and launch interactive public awareness campaigns about ex-situ conservation. The research paper was presented in the National conference and <b>training</b> <b>workshop</b> of Wildlife and Aerobiology, held at University of the Punjab, Lahore. The researcher, first author of the paper (co-author of 3 other papers) got her paper publish in The Journal of Animal and Plant Sciences under the title, [...] "The Study of Public Perception for Captive Animals at Lahore Zoo, Pakistan." ...|$|E
2500|$|LGBT persons faced {{widespread}} discrimination , as well {{as police}} harassment and extortion attempts. Gay men in prison were often subjected to sexual and other physical abuse. In June 2010 more than 1,000 protesters in Takoradi, Western Region, participated in a peaceful rally against reports {{of gay and lesbian}} activities in their city. This was reportedly the first such protest in the country. In May 2010 an HIV/AIDS <b>training</b> <b>workshop</b> was held in Takoradi for health- care workers. After the workshop, The Daily Graphic announced that 8,000 gay persons had been [...] "registered" [...] in the Western and Central Regions. However, experts in the field denied that there had been any such [...] "registration". After the workshop there was significant negative reporting in the media about homosexuality. In a June 2010 interview with The Daily Graphic, the Western Region minister called on the government to take steps to combat homosexuality. He included the possibility of police raids on locales frequented by gay men and lesbians, efforts by community leaders to [...] "wean young people" [...] away from homosexuality, and a public condemnation by the government. However, no arrests of persons were made in connection with his comments by year's end, and he did not repeat his call. It was reported that four men who worked within the community of gay men were arrested in May 2010 in connection with an alleged sexual assault and were later charged with sodomy. The case was first brought to the Takoradi Circuit Court on August 24; however, it had not been heard by year's end.|$|E

Thus, building NMA’s capacity in areas relevant to this work was critical for making the work sustainable. As a result, a number of <b>training</b> <b>workshops</b> were given on-site at NMA. On-site training enabled participation of more trainees than {{would have been possible}} if the trainings were held outside the country. The <b>training</b> <b>workshops</b> were followed immediately with related work activities under the supervision of IRI staff. This helped to strengthen the knowledge acquired during the <b>training</b> <b>workshops.</b> The IRI is still providing technical support to the NMA on an as-needed basis.|$|R
