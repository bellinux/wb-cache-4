5|$|After {{separating}} {{from the}} Atlas booster, Schirra stabilized <b>the</b> <b>spacecraft</b> and slowly cartwheeled into the correct attitude; he deliberately kept the motion slow to conserve fuel, {{and was able}} to position the capsule using half a percent of his fuel reserves. He briefly tracked the spent booster, which was rotating slowly past, but made no attempt to move towards it. As <b>the</b> <b>spacecraft</b> moved across the Atlantic, he turned his attention to testing manual control of <b>the</b> <b>spacecraft,</b> which he found sloppy compared to the fly-by-wire system.|$|E
5|$|Another {{alternative}} landing {{concept was}} the US Air Force's proposal to attach wings to <b>the</b> <b>spacecraft.</b> This proposal arose {{soon after the}} cancellation of the X-20 Dyna-Soar, and would have seen a Gemini spacecraft attached {{to a set of}} wings developed during the ASSET program. This would have been launched by a Titan II rocket, and would have been unable to maneuver in orbit. Another proposal saw <b>the</b> <b>spacecraft</b> being launched by a Titan IIIA or IIIC, using the Transtage for maneuvering. Once the mission was complete, <b>the</b> <b>spacecraft</b> would have been deorbited by means of five solid rocket motors.|$|E
5|$|During the encounter, {{signals from}} <b>the</b> <b>spacecraft</b> {{required}} 246minutes to reach Earth. Hence, {{for the most}} part, Voyager 2 mission relied on preloaded commands for the Neptune encounter. <b>The</b> <b>spacecraft</b> performed a near-encounter with the moon Nereid before it came within 4,400km of Neptune's atmosphere on 25 August, then passed close to the planet's largest moon Triton later the same day.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the spacecraft's orbit and facilitate maneuvers, sixteen Sun sensors – eight primaries and eight backups – are placed around <b>the</b> <b>spacecraft</b> to calibrate solar direction relative to the orbiter's frame. Two star trackers, digital cameras used to map the position of catalogued stars, provide NASA with full, three-axis knowledge of <b>the</b> <b>spacecraft</b> orientation and attitude. A primary and backup Miniature Inertial Measurement Unit (MIMU), provided by Honeywell, measures changes to <b>the</b> <b>spacecraft</b> attitude as well as any non-gravitationally induced changes to its linear velocity. Each MIMU is a combination of three accelerometers and three ring-laser gyroscopes. These systems are all critically important to MRO, as it must be able to point its camera to a very high precision in order to take the high-quality pictures that the mission requires. It has also been specifically designed to minimize any vibrations on <b>the</b> <b>spacecraft,</b> so as to allow its instruments to take images without any distortions caused by vibrations.|$|E
5|$|Landsat 1 was {{launched}} July 23, 1972 on a Delta 0900 out of Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. <b>The</b> <b>spacecraft</b> {{was placed in}} a sun-synchronous orbit, with an altitude between 907 and 915 km. <b>The</b> <b>spacecraft</b> {{was placed in a}}n orbit with an inclination of 99 degrees which orbited the Earth every 103 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Launch and Early Orbit Phase {{operations}} were {{completed in the}} morning of 11 April 2010, and SIRAL-2 was activated later the same day. At 14:40 UTC, <b>the</b> <b>spacecraft</b> returned its first scientific data. Initial data on ice thickness was presented by the mission's Lead Investigator, Duncan Wingham, at the 2010 Living Planet Symposium on 1 July. Later the same month, data was made available to scientists for the first time. <b>The</b> <b>spacecraft</b> underwent six months of on-orbit testing and commissioning, which concluded with a review on 22 October 2010 that found <b>the</b> <b>spacecraft</b> was operating as expected, and that it was ready to begin operations.|$|E
50|$|Dual {{payloads}} can be launched, with a canister that encloses <b>the</b> lower <b>spacecraft</b> and mounts <b>the</b> upper <b>spacecraft.</b> <b>The</b> upper <b>spacecraft</b> deploys, <b>the</b> canister opens, then <b>the</b> lower <b>spacecraft</b> separates from <b>the</b> third-stage adapter. Since {{the fairing}} is unchanged for cost and aerodynamic reasons, {{each of the}} two payloads must be relatively compact.|$|R
50|$|The first orbit-raising {{manoeuvre}} {{was performed}} on 6 November 2013 at 19:47 UTC when <b>the</b> <b>spacecraft's</b> 440 N liquid engine was fired for 416 seconds. With this engine firing, <b>the</b> <b>spacecraft's</b> apogee was raised to 28825 km, with a perigee of 252 km.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> VA <b>spacecraft</b> {{was capable}} of {{independent}} flight - up to 31 hours in its last incarnation - it needed however to be combined with additional hardware (containing propulsion and storage) to achieve a longer flight duration. Three different such usage scenarios for <b>the</b> VA <b>spacecraft</b> were planned: Initially <b>the</b> LK-1 <b>spacecraft,</b> and after LK-1's cancellation the plans for Almaz APOS and <b>the</b> TKS <b>spacecraft</b> utilized <b>the</b> VA <b>spacecraft.</b>|$|R
5|$|MRO has two {{rechargeable}} nickel-hydrogen batteries used {{to power}} <b>the</b> <b>spacecraft</b> {{when it is}} not facing the Sun. Each battery has an energy storage capacity of 50ampere-hours (180kC). The full range of the batteries cannot be used due to voltage constraints on <b>the</b> <b>spacecraft,</b> but allows the operators to extend the battery life—a valuable capability, given that battery drain {{is one of the most}} common causes of long-term satellite failure. Planners anticipate that only 40% of the batteries' capacities will be required during the lifetime of <b>the</b> <b>spacecraft.</b>|$|E
5|$|The mission {{objectives}} involved {{evaluating the}} performance of <b>the</b> <b>spacecraft</b> over six orbits, {{as well as the}} effect of prolonged microgravity on the pilot. The specific spacecraft systems would also be evaluated and tested, and the worldwide tracking and communications network would be tested to see how well it would stand up in an extended mission. The flight control experiments included manually turning <b>the</b> <b>spacecraft</b> around, yaw and pitch manoeuvres to determine {{how easy it was to}} control <b>the</b> <b>spacecraft</b> attitude, realignment of the onboard gyroscopes in flight, and leaving <b>the</b> <b>spacecraft</b> to drift on-orbit.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>spacecraft</b> and booster {{were almost}} {{identical}} to those used on the two preceding Mercury orbital flights. <b>The</b> <b>spacecraft</b> had heating blankets removed from the retrorocket motors, to save weight, and a SOFAR bomb was added. This would be ejected {{at the time the}} main parachute was deployed, and would help recovery crews find <b>the</b> <b>spacecraft</b> after it landed. A number of modifications were made to the reaction control system, and the communications equipment was upgraded.|$|E
50|$|The Beagle 2 fate {{remained}} a mystery until January 2015 {{when it was}} located intact {{on the surface of}} Mars in a series of images from NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter HiRISE camera.

50|$|The {{purpose of}} the Bolo is to either speed up, or slow down, a {{spacecraft}} that docks with it without using any of <b>the</b> <b>spacecraft's</b> onboard propellant and to change <b>the</b> <b>spacecraft's</b> orbital flight path. Effectively, the Bolo acts as a reusable upper stage for any spacecraft that docks with it.|$|R

5|$|Two Gemini-derived {{spacecraft}} {{were considered}} for unmanned resupply flights. The {{first of these}} would have involved a Gemini spacecraft, with all systems for manned flight, re-entry and landing removed. <b>The</b> <b>spacecraft</b> would have docked using a port {{at the front of}} <b>the</b> <b>spacecraft.</b> Cargo would have been transferred through the nose of <b>the</b> <b>spacecraft,</b> where the re-entry attitude control system was located on the manned spacecraft. <b>The</b> <b>spacecraft</b> was equipped with a liquid propellant engine to perform rendezvous, and to reboost the space station. The other proposal was for a new spacecraft to be built for unmanned missions, but re-using as many Gemini systems as possible. It would have had a higher cargo capacity than the stripped-down version of the Gemini spacecraft.|$|E

5|$|A comet-impact {{mission was}} first {{proposed}} to NASA in 1996, {{but at the}} time, NASA engineers were skeptical that the target could be hit. In 1999, a revised and technologically upgraded mission proposal, dubbed Deep Impact, was accepted and funded as part of NASA's Discovery Program of low-cost spacecraft. The two spacecraft (Impactor and Flyby) and the three main instruments were built and integrated by Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp. in Boulder, Colorado. Developing the software for <b>the</b> <b>spacecraft</b> took 18 months and the application code consisted of 20,000 lines and 19 different application threads.

5|$|According to Russian sources, the {{official}} decision to launch Sputnik 2 {{was made on}} 10 or 12 October, leaving less than four weeks to design and build <b>the</b> <b>spacecraft.</b> Sputnik 2, therefore, {{was something of a}} rush job, with most elements of <b>the</b> <b>spacecraft</b> being constructed from rough sketches. Aside from the primary mission of sending a living passenger into space, Sputnik 2 also contained instrumentation for measuring solar irradiance and cosmic rays.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the {{original}} spacecraft was completed in August 2004. Following testing, <b>the</b> <b>spacecraft</b> was shipped to the Plesetsk Cosmodrome in Russia during August 2005 and arrived on 1 September. The launch occurred from Site 133/3 on 8 October, however due to a missing command in the rocket's flight control system, the second stage engine did not shut {{down at the end}} of its planned burn, and instead the stage burned to depletion. This prevented the second stage and Briz-KM from separating, and as a result the rocket failed to achieve orbit. <b>The</b> <b>spacecraft</b> was lost when it reentered over the Arctic Ocean, north of Greenland.|$|E
