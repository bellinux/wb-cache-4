5|$|The {{ecological}} {{conservation of}} seamounts is {{hurt by the}} simple lack of information available. Seamounts are very poorly studied, with only 350 of the estimated 100,000 seamounts in the world having received sampling, and fewer than 100 in depth. Much of this lack of information {{can be attributed to}} a lack of technology, and to the daunting task of reaching these underwater structures; the technology to fully explore them has only been around the last few decades. Before consistent conservation efforts can begin, the seamounts of <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>must</b> first be mapped, a task that is still in progress.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Aquinas, a thirteenth-century {{scholastic}} {{philosopher and}} theologian {{heavily influenced by}} Augustine, proposed a form of the Augustinian theodicy in his Summa Theologica. Aquinas began by attempting to establish the existence of God, through his Five Ways, and then attested that God is good and must have a morally sufficient reason for allowing evil to exist. Aquinas proposed that all goodness in <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>must</b> exist perfectly in God, and that, existing perfectly, God must be perfectly good. He concluded that God is goodness, {{and that there is}} no evil in God.|$|E

25|$|Though not {{all women}} are {{politicians}} or war generals, boys are {{raised in the}} domestic sphere. Not only that, but men come back to it every day in their private homes. Even President Theodore Roosevelt can be quoted to say “o man {{can be a good}} citizen who is not a good husband and a good father.” Similar to how history needs domestic history incorporated into it, men’s history cannot be understood without their private experiences known. Women’s history thus needs their private experiences to be combined with their public. To successfully integrate these histories, <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>must</b> not have male and female spheres that are synonyms for the private and public. The connections found in public and private men’s and women’s history need to be systematically synthesized to successfully integrate them. So the idea of just two histories creates the challenge that most feminist historians have.|$|E
500|$|The gradual {{nature of}} the {{disaster}} was also more comforting, in some respects, compared {{with the nature of}} modern technological failures such as air crashes. Times reviewer made this point explicitly: [...] "This air age, when death comes too swiftly for heroism or with no survivors to record it, can still turn with wonder to an age before yesterday when a thousand deaths at sea seemed the very worst <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>must</b> suffer." [...] It was, as Steven Biel comments, [...] "a quainter kind of disaster" [...] in which the victims had time to prepare and chose how to die.|$|E

Although Hazlitt does not entirely belong to the school of pure [...] "character" [...] critics, this essay does {{tend to be more}} of a [...] "character" [...] criticism than others, asserts Kinnaird, because Hazlitt shared with his Romantic contemporaries an [...] "ambivalence toward tragedy". Hamlet to him as to his contemporaries was a modern character who was [...] "obsessed with evil in the world [...] long to escape from knowledge of it in themselves [...] pessimistic sense that suffering changes nothing and that <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>must</b> go on as it is."

500|$|In 2012, Anglin {{launched}} his first website, Adventure Quest 2012, which discussed conspiracy theories, most particularly the Reptilians. He described {{the aim of}} the site as seeking to [...] "mend the wounds produced by modern society ... and [...] the reader transcend these physical bonds and reach total ascendancy. To mend these wounds, <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>must</b> learn to embrace diversity and color." [...] He later studied Buddhism, Islam and 20th-century French philosophy before aligning himself with Neo-Nazism. In 2014, he stated that although he agreed with the central tenets of Nazism, he had reservations over reintroducing all aspects of Hitler's regime. A self-proclaimed [...] "troll", Anglin stated that he was introduced to Nazism on 4chan. Later in 2012, he {{launched his}} first far-right website, Total Fascism. Feeling that Total Fascism was not appealing to a younger demographic and had articles that were too long, Anglin launched The Daily Stormer on July 4, 2013, with shorter articles and a more provocative style. [...] Anglin said in March 2014 he spends 70 hours a week writing for the website.|$|E
500|$|Brockett next {{introduces}} Stephen to Valérie Seymour, who– {{like her}} prototype, Natalie Clifford Barney– is the hostess {{of a literary}} salon, many of whose guests are lesbians and gay men. Immediately after this meeting Stephen announces she has decided to settle in Paris at 35 Rue Jacob (purchased at Seymour's recommendation), with its temple {{in a corner of}} an overgrown garden. Barney lived and held her salon at 20 Rue Jacob. Stephen is wary of Valérie, and does not visit her salon until after the war, when Brockett persuades her that Mary is becoming too isolated. She finds Valérie to be an [...] "indestructible creature" [...] capable of bestowing a sense of self-respect on others, at least temporarily: [...] "everyone felt very normal and brave when they gathered together at Valérie Seymour's". With Stephen's misgivings [...] "drugged", she and Mary are drawn further into the [...] "desolate country" [...] of Paris gay life. At Alec's Bar– the worst in a series of depressing nightspots– they encounter [...] "the battered remnants of men who...despised of <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> <b>must</b> despise themselves beyond all hope, it seemed, of salvation".|$|E

2500|$|In The Creation of Patriarchy by Gerda Lerner, {{the author}} states that Aristotle {{believed}} that women had colder blood than men, which made women not evolve into men, the sex that Aristotle {{believed to be}} perfect and superior. Maryanne Cline Horowitz stated that Aristotle believed that [...] "soul contributes the form and model of creation." [...] This implies that any imperfection that is caused in <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>must</b> {{be caused by a}} woman because one cannot acquire an imperfection from perfection (which he perceived as male). Aristotle had a hierarchical ruling structure in his theories. Lerner claims that through this patriarchal belief system, passed down generation to generation, people have been conditioned to believe that men are superior to women. These symbols are benchmarks which children learn about when they grow up, and the cycle of patriarchy continues much past the Greeks.|$|E

It added that the decision for a solution was seen as solely an Israeli matter, instead of the result of Palestinian-Israeli discussions.

2500|$|Beuys {{had adopted}} shamanism {{not only as}} the {{presentation}} mode of his art but also in his own life. Although the artist as a shaman has been a trend in modern art (Picasso, Gauguin), Beuys is unusual in that respect as he integrated “his art and his life into the shaman role.” Beuys believed that humanity, with its turn on rationality, was trying to eliminate “emotions” and thus eliminate {{a major source of}} energy and creativity in every individual. In his first lecture tour in America he was telling the audience that humanity was in an evolving state and that as “spiritual” beings we ought to draw on both our emotions and our thinking as they represent the total energy and creativity for every individual. Beuys described how we must seek out and energize our spirituality and link it to our thinking powers so that “our vision of <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>must</b> be extended to encompass all the invisible energies with which we have lost contact.” ...|$|E
