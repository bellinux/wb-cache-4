40|$|The {{operation}} <b>of</b> <b>an</b> electronically steered array (ESA) antenna {{is highly}} flexible in that <b>a</b> range <b>of</b> control parameters can be reconfigured nearly instantaneously.

The rise <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ‘ecosystem services approach’ (ESA) to policy-making has refocused attention on the utilisation of environmental knowledge in policy making. Policy level appraisal has long been identified as a critically important venue in which knowledge should be utilised. Important lessons can therefore be drawn from these experiences to inform the future potential <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>ESA.</b> This paper addresses this politically important challenge by reporting on the content of 75 policy appraisals undertaken in the United Kingdom between 2008 and 2012. The UK is a ‘most likely’ case for knowledge utilisation given its long-standing commitment to both policy appraisal and ESA. However, analysis reveals that only some elements <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>ESA</b> appear in the sampled appraisals, and those mostly among appraisals produced by the environment ministry. Drawing on theories of policy appraisal and knowledge utilisation, this paper concludes that <b>a</b> better understanding <b>of</b> the barriers to embedding <b>an</b> <b>ESA</b> in policy appraisal is urgently needed in order to inform wider debates about how to institutionalise ecosystem values in policy making...|$|R
