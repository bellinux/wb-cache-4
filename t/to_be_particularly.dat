5|$|Beauveria bassiana (Hyphomycetes) is a {{pathogenic}} fungus that infects a {{wide range}} of insect species, including the Colorado potato beetle. It has shown <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>particularly</b> effective as a biological pesticide for L. decemlineata when used in combination with the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis.|$|E
5|$|In Scotland, the Cailleachan (lit. 'old women') {{are also}} known as The Storm Hags, and seen as personifications of the {{elemental}} powers of nature, especially in a destructive aspect. They are said <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>particularly</b> active in raising the windstorms of spring, during the period known as A' Chailleach.|$|E

5|$|Sebrights {{are neither}} {{prolific}} egg layers, nor outstanding meat birds. They can prove <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>particularly</b> difficult to raise, especially for beginners. Hens rarely go broody and chicks usually have high mortality rates. Adults are generally hardy birds, but are especially susceptible to Marek's disease.|$|E
5|$|A looser {{interpretation}} of the Griffo designs is Iowan Old Style, designed by John Downer and also released by Bitstream. With a larger x-height (taller lower-case letters) than the print-oriented Bembo and influences of signpainting (Downer's former profession), it was intended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>particularly</b> clear for reading at distance, in displays and in signage. It is a default font in Apple's iBooks application.|$|E
5|$|Bioinformatic screens have {{predicted}} that over 250 human proteins contain prion-like domains (PrLD). These domains are hypothesized {{to have the same}} transmissible, amyloidogenic properties of PrP and known fungal proteins. As in yeast, proteins involved in gene expression and RNA binding seem <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>particularly</b> enriched in PrLD's, compared to other classes of protein. In particular, 29 of the known 210 proteins with an RNA recognition motif also have a putative prion domain. Meanwhile, several of these RNA-binding proteins have been independently identified as pathogenic in cases of ALS, FTLD-U, Alzheimer's disease, and Huntington's disease.|$|E

5|$|Butterflies {{navigate}} using a time-compensated sun compass. They can see {{polarized light}} and therefore orient even in cloudy conditions. The polarized light near the ultraviolet spectrum appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>particularly</b> important. Many migratory butterflies live in semi-arid areas where breeding seasons are short. The life histories of their host plants also influence butterfly behaviour.|$|E
5|$|Coach Alexander found campus spirit <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>particularly</b> low {{following}} the Great Depression. His successful football program (and the other athletic teams) had very few student fans attending the games. He helped {{to establish a}} spirit organization known as the Yellow Jacket Club in 1930 to bolster student spirit. The group would later become the Ramblin' Reck Club. The 1939 team was SEC co-champion.|$|E
5|$|In France, the premiership of Aristide Briand, {{a leading}} proponent of {{engaging}} with Constantine {{to bring about}} a reconciliation of the two Greek administrations, was threatened by the events in Athens, leading to the reorganization of the French government. In Britain, Prime Minister H. H. Asquith and foreign minister Sir Edward Grey resigned and were replaced by Lloyd George and Arthur Balfour. The change in the British leadership proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>particularly</b> important for Greece, since Lloyd George was a known Hellenophile, an admirer of Venizelos and dedicated to resolving the Eastern Question.|$|E

5|$|Kauri gum {{was used}} commercially in varnish, {{and can be}} {{considered}} a type of copal (the name given to resin used in such a way). Kauri gum was found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>particularly</b> good for this, and from the mid-1840s was exported to London and America. Tentative exports had begun a few years earlier, however, for use in marine glue and as fire-kindlers; gum had even made up part of an export cargo to Australia in 1814.|$|E
5|$|Reinhold Werner {{was born}} on 10 May 1825, {{in the town of}} Weferlingen, Prussia in what is now Saxony-Anhalt. He served for several years in the {{merchant}} marine in the 1830s and 1840s, during which he made several voyages to the East Indies. While in the merchant marine, he was given the nickname Schweizer (Swiss), as his North German shipmates found his accent <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>particularly</b> foreign compared to their native Plattdeutsch.|$|E
5|$|The brush cuckoo (Cacomantis variolosus), pallid cuckoo (C. pallidus), Horsfield's bronze cuckoo (Chrysococcyx basalis), and black-eared cuckoo (C.osculans) {{have been}} {{recorded}} as brood parasites of the red-capped robin; female cuckoos lay their eggs in robin nests, which are then raised by the robins as their own. Red-capped robins have been observed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>particularly</b> aggressive in driving Horsfield's bronze cuckoos from their territories in Terrick Terrick National Park in a field study, and no nests were found parasitised there.|$|E

5|$|The house {{alongside}} the Jewel Tower {{was taken over}} by the new department in 1869, and the standards and testing equipment were installed in the tower itself, which was felt <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>particularly</b> suitable for making scientific measurements, because of its thick walls. The roof, which was in poor condition, was repaired. The ground floor was used as a weighing room and for storing glass fluid measures, the first floor held the standards of length, and the second floor was used as a museum to display old historical equipment.|$|E
5|$|The rider {{considered}} {{most likely}} to challenge Contador for the general classification was Richie Porte (Sky). Porte had already achieved nine race victories in 2015, including the overall victories in Paris–Nice, the Volta a Catalunya and the Giro del Trentino. Porte was expected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>particularly</b> strong in the individual time trial, {{as well as in}} the mountains. Porte had not shown consistent form in a Grand Tour in recent years, however, and there were doubts about his ability to maintain his form over a three-week race.|$|E
5|$|A 1920s {{adaptation}} {{created by}} the Stempel Type Foundry and released for hot metal typesetting by Linotype, that has remained popular. It is sharp, somewhat angular design with a crisp hook rather than a teardrop at top left of the 'a'. Stempel Garamond has relatively short descenders, allowing it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>particularly</b> tightly linespaced. An unusual feature is the digit 0, which has reversed contrast, with the thickest points of {{the number on the}} top and bottom of the digit to make it more distinguishable from a 'o'. The Klingspor Museum credits it to Stempel's head of typeface development Dr. Rudolf Wolf.|$|E
50|$|The Settimo station, just {{northern}} <b>to</b> Turin, <b>is</b> <b>particularly</b> important, in that {{it allows}} the interchange with the Turin-Milan and Turin-Aosta inter-regional railroads, operated by Trenitalia.|$|R

5|$|Although Wakaw had a {{population}} of only 400, it sat {{at the heart of}} a densely populated area of rural townships and had its own district court. It was also easily accessible to Saskatoon, Prince Albert and Humboldt, places where the Court of King's Bench sat. The local people were mostly immigrants, and Diefenbaker's research found them <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>particularly</b> litigious. There was already one barrister in town, and the residents were loyal to him, initially refusing to rent office space to Diefenbaker. The new lawyer was forced to rent a vacant lot and erect a two-room wooden shack.|$|E
5|$|As Master of the Rolls he {{selected}} cases he felt <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>particularly</b> important to hear and, {{rather than having}} an American system (where judges had a rota for taking cases), assigned cases to those judges who had expertise in that particular area of law. In 1963 he chaired a committee investigating {{ways to reduce the}} archive of legal documents kept by the Public Record Office; by that point the files for civil cases of the High Court alone occupied four miles of shelving. The final report was presented to the Lord Chancellor on 16 May 1966, with the conclusion being that 'if our proposals are implemented the Public Record Office alone will be relieved of two hundred tons of records (occupying 15,000 feet of shelving)'. The Lord Chancellor took Denning's report to heart, and had the changes he recommended implemented immediately.|$|E
5|$|German war cemeteries are {{somewhat}} different from French and British ones, being more austere and simple in design. They were built around lawns, without flowers or other decorations, intended to highlight {{acceptance of the}} tragedy and avoid the expensive and pretentious sentimentality that the German VDK felt Allied cemeteries invoked. German war cemeteries also included heldenhaine, heroes' groves populated with oak trees and large boulders, dolmen. Both symbolising nature; this landscaping was considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>particularly</b> important for German war cemeteries. The cemeteries used slate grave markers, less individualised than British or French equivalents, and felt to better symbolise the importance German nation as a whole.|$|E
