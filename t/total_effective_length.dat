30|$|The {{total length}} of the Ahmedabad-Rajkot {{national}} highway is 205 km, out of which the <b>total</b> <b>effective</b> <b>length</b> available is 185.4 km (based on the computation given in Table[*] 2; 185.4 km/ 1.78 km), and 104 MW is possible for the entire {{length of the}} highway. This way, for 104 -MW systems, the energy generation is 163 GWh. This is for a single-layer solar panel system. If the solar panels lay one above the other with 1 -m separation, the energy generation (Table[*] 3) increases to 190 GWh; for 2 -m separation, it is 216 GWh; and for 3 -m separation, it is 229 GWh. One should note here that these computations are based on 50 -kW systems as one unit and the direction of the national highway is oriented exactly in the east-west direction. Similar computations are shown in Table[*] 4 for the Ahmedabad-Vadodara national expressway. Here again, the computations are based on 50 -kW systems as one unit, and the solar panels are distributed in the south-north direction. Accordingly, 61 -MW electricity generation is possible for the Ahmedabad-Vadodara expressway, and 96 GWh of cumulative annual generation is possible for single layer, 115 GWh for two layers of 1 -m separation, 132 GWh for 2 -m panel separation, and 140 GWh for 3 -m separation, as presented in Table[*] 4.|$|E
40|$|The {{location}} of partial discharge (PD) sources by free-space UHF detection {{is an attractive}} approach for condition monitoring of high voltage equipment in substations. A low-cost, radiometric, PD wireless sensor network (WSN) has been proposed to provide continuous real-time coverage for an entire substation (J. M. Neto, Y. Zhang, A. Jaber, M. Zhu, M. Judd, R. Atkinson, J. Soraghan, J. S. Neto, M. F. Vieira, I. A. Glover, 2014 XXXIth URSI General Assembly and Scientific Symposium (URSI GASS), Beijing, 16 - 23 Aug. 2014, pp. 1 - 4). A suggested band for UHF PD detection is 0. 3 - 1. 5 GHz (Z. Tang, C. Li, X. Cheng, W. Wang, J. Li, IEEE Trans. Dielectr. Electr. Insul., 6, 2006, pp. 1193 – 1199). A novel ultrawideband (UWB) printed monopole antenna is presented here for PD WSN applications. Fig. 1 shows {{the configuration of the}} proposed antenna and a constructed prototype. It is constructed on FR 4 substrate with thickness 1. 6 mm and relative dielectric constant of 4. 4. The width of the 50 Ω microstrip feed (W 2) is 3 mm. The antenna is compact (dimensions 24 cm × 20 cm). The optimised parameters are L 1 = 50 mm, L 2 = 6 mm, L 3 = 2 mm, L 4 = 43 mm, L 5 = 90 mm, W 1 = 64 mm, W 2 = 3 mm, W 3 = 16 mm, W 4 = 50 mm, W 5 = 68 mm, h = 1. 6 mm. The impedance bandwidth is enhanced by the two steps (L 4 ×W 3) and bevelled shoulders (W 4). The slotted ground plane with a rectangular notch, (L 2 -L 3) ×W 1, and the offset L 3 between the radiating patch and ground plane are for impedance matching. Adjusting the latter controls coupling between the lower edge of the patch and ground plane. The low frequency limit is determined by the <b>total</b> <b>effective</b> <b>length</b> of the antenna current which includes the patch and ground plane. The bandwidth of a UWB antenna can be achieved by overlapping several adjacent resonances, each one represented by a parallel equivalent circuit. The proposed antenna structure is simulated using CST Microwave Studio. Fig. 2 shows the measured and simulated return loss. - 10 dB return loss (S 11) is achieved from 0. 35 to 1. 37 GHz. The three resonances (most obvious in the simulated S 11) are due to the three serial discontinuities moving from the feed line along the antenna. Fig. 3 shows the simulated far-field radiation pattern at 0. 75 GHz. The peak directivity is 4. 3 dBi. At this frequency the antenna has an approximately omnidirectional H-plane pattern but with maximum gain directed approximately 24 degrees offset from the x-z plane. The E-plane pattern {{is similar to that of}} a monopole antenna but with slightly greater gain in the y-z plane compared to the x-y plane...|$|E

The oxygen isotope enrichment of lamina water relative to source water ðD 1 Þ; which increased with increasing VPd, was estimated by mass balance between less enriched water in primary veins and enriched water in the leaf. The Craig-Gordon model overestimated Db (and D 1 Þ; as expected. Such discrepancies increased with increase in transpiration rate (E), supporting the Farquhar-Gan model, which gave reasonable predictions of Db and D 1 with an L of 7. 9 mm, much less than the <b>total</b> radial <b>effective</b> <b>length</b> Lr of 43 mm.

40|$|The {{integrating}} cavity absorption meter (ICAM) {{has been}} used successfully to measure the low absorption coefficient of pure water. The ICAM produces an <b>effective</b> <b>total</b> path <b>length</b> of several meters or even longer, although the physical size of the instrument is only several centimeters. The long <b>effective</b> <b>total</b> path <b>length</b> ensures a high sensitivity that enables the ICAM to measure liquid mediums with low absorption. Compared to the conventional transmission type of instruments {{that were used to}} measure the same medium with the same path length, the ICAM eliminates the effect of scattering by introducing isotropic illumination in the medium, and consequently measures the true absorption coefficient of the medium in stead of the attenuation coefficient. The original ICAM was constructed with Spectralon and used in the wavelength range from 380 nm to 700 nm. Later studies showed that Spectralon is not suitable for measurements in the UV region because of its relatively lower reflectivity in this region and, even worse, the continuously decaying reflectivity under the exposure to UV radiation. Thus, we have developed a new way to construct the ICAM utilizing the material fumed silica. The resulting ICAM has a high sensitivity even in the UV region and doesn't have the deterioration problem. The measurement results from the new ICAM are in good agreement with the existing results. The absorption coefficients of pure water at wavelengths between 250 nm and 400 nm are presented here...|$|R
50|$|The {{resonant}} {{frequencies of}} the air column in a pipe are inversely proportional to the pipe's <b>effective</b> <b>length.</b> In other words, a shorter pipe produces higher notes. For a pipe with no tone holes but open at both ends, the <b>effective</b> <b>length</b> is the physical length of the pipe plus a little more for the small volumes of air just beyond {{the ends of the}} pipe that are also involved in the resonance. An open hole anywhere along the middle of the pipe shortens the pipe's <b>effective</b> <b>length</b> and therefore raises the pitch of the notes it produces. The closer an open hole is to the blowing end, the shorter the remaining <b>effective</b> <b>length</b> is and the more it raises the pitch. Generally, a hole in a given position doesn't reduce the <b>effective</b> <b>length</b> quite as much as cutting the pipe at that position would, and the smaller the hole, the less it reduces the <b>effective</b> <b>length</b> when open. Closing the hole increases the <b>effective</b> <b>length</b> and lowers the pitch again. However, a pipe with a closed tone hole is not acoustically identical to a pipe with no hole; the shape of the fingertip or pad that closes the hole modifies the pipe's internal volume and <b>effective</b> <b>length.</b>|$|R

As a result, we conclude that coded transmission using finite <b>effective</b> <b>length</b> codes is necessary to achieve optimality. We argue that the sub-optimal performance of large <b>effective</b> <b>length</b> codes is due to their inefficiency in preserving {{the correlation between the}} inputs to the distributed terminals in the communication system.

A sensitivity improvement technique is proposed for a class of bulk-glass optical current sensors that employ a ferromagnetic field concentrator. The <b>total</b> <b>effective</b> optical path <b>length</b> is demonstrated theoretically to be an invariant regardless of the bulk glass thickness and consequently independent {{of the size of the}} concentrator gap opening. Thus, if the magnetic field is increased by reducing the gap size, the eventual Faraday rotation for a given electric current can be increased proportionally, leading to an improved device sensitivity. The dependence of the gap magnetic field on gap size is calculated with an equivalent circuit model, and this analytical treatment is compared with a dedicated finite element computer package. By taking account of various types of optical power losses present in the bulk glass, the above formulated gap dependence of magnetic field is used to aid a realistic assessment of device sensitivity and this serves as a tool to design and analyze practical bulk-glass optical current sensors. A detailed experimental study to confirm the proposed sensitivity improvement technique is also reported...|$|R

The <b>effective</b> <b>length</b> factor is employed to facilitate the design of framed members by transforming an end-restrained compressive member to an equivalent pinned-ended member.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. This thesis presents the results of research in which a formulation was developed for the <b>effective</b> <b>length</b> factor for compression members with non-ideal end conditions. This research stems from previous research conducted by Kohutek, Nunn, and Faseler (1993), in which twelve tubular members were tested in axial compression. These members possessed non-ideal end conditions consisting of nontranslating ends and restraining moments. The test specimens were divided into four groups based upon the condition of the member (undamaged/ungrouted, damaged/ungrouted, undamaged/grouted, damaged/grouted). The author developed four different methods to measure the rotational restraint of the load frame used in the testing by Kohutek, Nunn, and Faseler (1993). The properties of the tubular members were calculated based on four different idealizations, also developed by the author. The <b>effective</b> <b>length</b> factor was found by using these rotational restraint measurements and specimen properties in a transcendental equation originally developed by Timoshenko and Gere (1961) for a beam-column with symmetric rotational restraints. The computed <b>effective</b> <b>length</b> factor based on the author's formulation and idealizations was compared with the experimental <b>effective</b> <b>length</b> factor determined by Kohutek, et al.. The computed <b>effective</b> <b>length</b> factor values were, in general, conservative predictions (i. e. KTMEO > KExp). For each group of tubular specimen, a particular method of computing the rotational restraint and the cross-sectional stiffness was identified by use of the lowest percent error between experimental K and theoretical computed K. The load frame used by Kohutek, et al., did not provide the same rotational restraint {{at each end of the}} specimen. Therefore, a modified rotational restraint was computed based on the average of the two end rotation values and was found to provide more accurate values of the <b>effective</b> <b>length</b> factor. For a specimen with an unknown <b>effective</b> <b>length</b> factor, a simple procedure has been developed to accurately predict the <b>effective</b> <b>length</b> factor, given certain cross-section data and full-scale testing data...|$|R
