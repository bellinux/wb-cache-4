25|$|While {{up until}} the end of the Parthian period in the 3rd century CE, <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> “Irān“ had <b>an</b> ethnic, linguistic, and {{religious}} value, it did not yet have <b>a</b> political import. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> “Iranian“ empire or kingdom in a political sense is a purely Sasanian one. It was the result <b>of</b> <b>a</b> convergence <b>of</b> interests between the new dynasty and the Zoroastrian clergy, as we can deduce from the available evidence. This convergence gave rise to <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Ērān-šahr “Kingdom <b>of</b> the Iranians,” which was “ēr“ (Middle Persian equivalent of Old Persian “ariya“ and Avestan “airya“).|$|R

5|$|Despite its post-revolutionary mythology, {{the march}} {{was not a}} {{spontaneous}} event. Numerous calls for a mass demonstration at Versailles had already been made; the Marquis of Saint-Huruge, one of the popular orators of the Palais-Royal, had called for just such a march in August to evict the obstructionist deputies who, he claimed, were protecting the king's veto power. Although his efforts were foiled, revolutionaries continued to hold onto <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> march on Versailles to compel the king to accept the Assembly's laws. Speakers at the Palais-Royal mentioned it regularly throughout the next month, creating enduring suspicions of the proprietor, Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orléans. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> march on Versailles was widespread, and was even discussed {{in the pages of}} the Mercure de France (5 September 1789). A menacing unrest was in the air, and many nobles and foreigners fled the oppressive atmosphere.|$|E
