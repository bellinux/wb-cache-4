30|$|<b>The</b> <b>interferences</b> {{coming from}} <b>the</b> radar members degrade the {{detection}} and recognition {{performance of the}} radar sensor networks (RSNs) if the waveforms of the radar members are nonorthogonal. In this paper, we analyze <b>the</b> <b>interferences</b> by exploring <b>the</b> polarization information of the electromagnetic (EM) waves.

We consider the cooperative RSNs environment where the polarization information of each radar member is known to all. The proposed method uses all radar members' polarization information to establish the corresponding filtering operator. The Doppler-shift and its uncertainty are independent of the polarization information, which contributes that <b>the</b> <b>interferences</b> can be suppressed without the utilization of the spatial, the temporal, the frequency, the time-delay and the Doppler-shift information. Theoretical analysis and the mathematical deduction show that the proposed scheme is a valid and simple implementation.

5|$|In most {{theories}} up to {{the eighteenth}} century, light was pictured as being made up of particles. Since particle models cannot easily account for the refraction, diffraction and birefringence of light, wave theories of light were proposed by René Descartes (1637), Robert Hooke (1665), and Christiaan Huygens (1678); however, particle models remained dominant, chiefly due {{to the influence of}} Isaac Newton. In the early nineteenth century, Thomas Young and August Fresnel clearly demonstrated <b>the</b> <b>interference</b> and diffraction of light and by 1850 wave models were generally accepted. In 1865, James Clerk Maxwell's prediction that light was an electromagnetic wave—which was confirmed experimentally in 1888 by Heinrich Hertz's detection of radio waves—seemed to be the final blow to particle models of light.|$|E

He verged on soundlike waves to explain the repeated pattern of reflection and transmission by thin films (Opticks Bk.II, Props. 12), but still retained his theory of 'fits' that disposed corpuscles to be reflected or transmitted (Props.13). However, later physicists favoured a purely wavelike explanation of light to account for <b>the</b> <b>interference</b> patterns and the general phenomenon of diffraction. Today's quantum mechanics, photons, {{and the idea of}} wave–particle duality bear only a minor resemblance to Newton's understanding of light.|$|E
