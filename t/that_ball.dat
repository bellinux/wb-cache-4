5|$|There are {{two main}} scoring variations; under the first and simpler ruleset, {{the first player to}} pocket his private number wins. Under the second variation, {{although}} a player still wins by pocketing his private number, points are scored in various ways: 1) two points are given by each participant to the winning player for the pocketing of his private number; 2) a player receives one point for pocketing any other player's private number, and the player whose private number was pocketed is penalized one point (and can have a negative point total), but is not out of the game and can still win points in this way; 3) if a player whose private number is pocketed by another does not disclose this fact before a subsequent shot is taken, the non-disclosing player forfeits, immediately losing the game, and the player who made <b>that</b> <b>ball</b> is given two points instead of one. In the event that no player succeeds in pocketing his private number, gameplay ends when the last private number is potted, and the game is played again with all points values doubled.|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe {{consider}} {{the question of}} giving an upper bound for the first nontrivial eigenvalue of the Wentzell-Laplace operator of a domain Ω, involving only geometrical informations. We provide such an upper bound, by generalizing Brock's inequality concerning Steklov eigenvalues, and we conjecture <b>that</b> <b>balls</b> maximize the Wentzell eigenvalue, in a suitable class of domains, which would improve our bound. To support this conjecture, we prove <b>that</b> <b>balls</b> are critical domains for the Wentzell eigenvalue, in any dimension, {{and that they are}} local maximizers in dimension 2 and 3, using an order two sensitivity analysis. We also provide some numerical evidence...|$|R

25|$|Law 20: Dead ball. The ball {{comes into}} play when the bowler begins his run up, and becomes dead when all the action from <b>that</b> <b>ball</b> is over. Once the ball is dead, no runs can be scored and no batsmen can be dismissed. The ball becomes dead {{for a number of}} reasons, most {{commonly}} when a batsman is dismissed, when a boundary is hit, or when the ball has finally settled with the bowler or wicketkeeper.|$|E
25|$|Experiments in 2007 {{involved}} shocking silicon wafers with electricity, which vaporizes {{the silicon}} and induces oxidation in the vapors.

Two Brazilian scientists, Antonio Pavão and Gerson Paiva of the Federal University of Pernambuco have reportedly consistently made small long-lasting balls using this method. These experiments stemmed from the theory <b>that</b> <b>ball</b> lightning is actually oxidized silicon vapors (see vaporized silicon hypothesis, below).|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{characterize}} the volume-constrained minimizers of a nonlocal free energy {{given by the}} difference of the t-perimeter and the s-perimeter, with s smaller than t. Exploiting the quantitative fractional isoperimetric inequality, we show <b>that</b> <b>balls</b> are the unique minimizers if the volume is sufficiently small, depending on t − s, while the existence vs. nonexistence of minimizers for large volumes remains open. We also consider the corresponding isoperimetric problem and prove existence and regularity of minimizers for all s, t. When s = 0 this problem reduces to the fractional isoperimetric problem, {{for which it is}} well known <b>that</b> <b>balls</b> are the only minimizers...|$|R

Doctors determined <b>that</b> <b>Ball,</b> who was 77 years old, had succumbed to a second aortic rupture, {{this time in the}} abdominal area, and that it was not directly related to her surgery the previous week. Her body was cremated and the ashes were originally interred in Forest Lawn– Hollywood Hills Cemetery in Los Angeles. However, in 2002, her children moved her remains to the Hunt family plot at Lake View Cemetery in Jamestown, New York, where her parents, Henry and Desirée (Hunt) Ball, his sister, Lucille Ball, and her grandparents are buried.|$|E
25|$|In 1981 Ebonite began {{manufacturing}} {{the very}} first urethane cover stock bowling balls and sold the rights to AMF. Ebonite produced AMF balls at that time. Ebonite {{did not believe that}} bowlers would pay the $80.00 price this new technology would demand. <b>That</b> <b>ball</b> became the AMF Angle and this one coverstock change allowed the ball to get a better grip on the urethane finishes used on natural wood lane surfaces, which changed the nature of the bowling game significantly. Then in 1991, Nu-Line Industries produced the X-Calibur, a reactive resin cover. Part-time professional Steve Cooper was the owner and president of the corporation. But production lagged in the early days, allowing firms like Storm, Brunswick and Columbia to enter the reactive market by the following summer. The race to create more and more dynamic balls was on.|$|E

25|$|Many {{competitions}} regulations, both amateur and professional, for matches {{of one day}} duration or less, {{modify the}} Law of cricket to mandate a free hit after a No ball is bowled. If the bowler bowls any No ball for a reason {{within the scope of}} the competition rule, <b>that</b> <b>ball</b> is treated as usual as a No ball under the Laws, with a penalty run added, and the batsman protected from most forms of dismissal. The next ball is the free hit. The fielders are required to stay in the same positions, and the batsman is again protected from most forms of dismissal under the No ball Law. The free hit may also be ruled a No ball or Wide, in which case the next ball is also a free hit, and so on. Once the bowler has bowled one legitimate 'free hit' ball, one ball is deemed to have been bowled towards the (usually six) legal balls required for one over, which then continues as normal.|$|E
25|$|Arguably {{the most}} {{noteworthy}} chapter in Ball's business career was his {{battle against the}} railroad unions in the Florida East Coast Railway strike of 1963 to 1977. In {{order to try to}} save the railroad from its three decades-long state of bankruptcy, which if allowed to continue would have threatened the railroad with physical deterioration and even partial abandonment, Ball fought for the company's right to engage in its own contract negotiations with the railroad unions rather than accept an industrywide settlement <b>that</b> <b>Ball</b> thought would include featherbedding and wasteful work rules. His use of replacement workers to keep the railroad running during the strike led to violence by strikers that included shootings and bombings. Eventually, Federal intervention helped quell the violence, and the railroad's right to operate during the strike with replacement workers was affirmed by the United States Supreme Court. As the strike continued, the Florida East Coast took numerous steps to improve its physical plant, install various forms of automation, and drastically cut labor costs, all to an extent that most other railroads would not succeed in matching until years later. Ball therefore was a pioneer in the American railroad industry's struggle, beginning in the 1960s, to improve its economic efficiency.|$|E

Willis beat him every time. Scarry complained that Willis was coming across the line before he snapped the ball. On one snap, Scarry stepped on quarterback Otto Graham's foot as he backpedaled to handle Willis. Brown took a look himself: Willis was not offside. He was getting a jump by watching for the center's fingers to tighten on the ball. [...] "He was quick", said Alex Agase, who later joined the Browns as a guard. [...] "I don't think there was anybody as quick at that position, or any position for that matter.

500|$|Two contestants {{compete on}} each episode. On each turn, a Bingo ball {{comes out of}} the hopper and a {{question}} is asked. Each ball has a number from 1 to 75 and a letter in the word [...] "BINGO" [...] printed on it. If the question is answered correctly, the player earns the letter from <b>that</b> <b>ball</b> and the number on the ball is added in dollars to the bank, which starts at $500 (e.g., if G-50 comes out, the bank increases by $50). If the letter is a duplicate already earned by the player, no extra letters are earned. The first player that spells out BINGO from the earned letters wins the game. A Free-Space Ball with a sponsor's logo acts as a wild card in the game. The player who answers a question correctly when <b>that</b> <b>ball</b> is rolled out can choose any letter, and $100 is added to the bank. Two regular games are played. Contestants who win both games win the match and receive {{all the money in the}} bank. If each contestant wins one game, a five-question tie-breaker game is played. The first question's answer begins with a B, the second question's answer starts with I, and so on. The first to answer three questions correctly wins the money in the bank and goes on to play the Bingo Bonus Board for a chance at $100,000.|$|E
500|$|The Germans {{credited}} Richthofen with {{shooting down}} Ball, {{but there is}} some doubt as to what happened, especially as Richthofen's claim was for a Sopwith Triplane, not an S.E.5, which was a biplane. Given the amount of propaganda the German High Command generated touting the younger Richthofen, a high-level decision may have been taken to attribute Ball's death to him. It is probable <b>that</b> <b>Ball</b> was not shot down at all, but had become disoriented and lost control during his final combat, the victim of a form of temporary vertigo that has claimed other pilots. [...] Ball's squadron harboured hopes that he was a prisoner of war, and the British government officially listed him as [...] "missing" [...] on 18 May. There was much speculation in the press; in France, the Havas news agency reported: [...] "Albert Ball, the star of aviators... has been missing since the 7th May.
