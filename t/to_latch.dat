Unfortunately, the truck belongs to a folding mattress company and Doofenshmirtz is crushed by the mattress and then crushed by his own robot immediately afterwards.|$|E

25|$|According to some authorities, {{increasing}} {{evidence suggests that}} early skin-to-skin contact (also called kangaroo care) between mother and baby stimulates breastfeeding behavior in the baby.

Immediate skin-to-skin contact may provide a form of imprinting that makes subsequent feeding significantly easier. In addition to more successful breastfeeding and bonding, immediate skin-to-skin contact reduces crying and warms the baby.|$|E

25|$|Positive {{feedback}} {{occurs when}} the fed-back signal is in phase with the input signal. Under certain gain conditions, positive feedback reinforces the input signal {{to the point where}} the output of the device oscillates between its maximum and minimum possible states. Positive feedback may also introduce hysteresis into a circuit. This can cause the circuit to ignore small signals and respond only to large ones. It is sometimes used to eliminate noise from a digital signal. Under some circumstances, positive feedback may cause a device <b>to</b> <b>latch,</b> i.e., to reach a condition in which the output is locked to its maximum or minimum state. This fact is very widely used in digital electronics to make bistable circuits for volatile storage of information.|$|E
25|$|When {{the breast}} overfills with milk it becomes painful. Engorgement comes from {{not getting enough}} milk from the breast. It happens about 3 to 7 days after {{delivery}} and occurs more often in first time mothers. The increased blood supply, the accumulated milk and the swelling all contribute to the painful engorgement. Engorgement may affect the areola, {{the periphery of the}} breast or the entire breast, and may interfere with breastfeeding both from the pain and also from the distortion of the normal shape of the areola/nipple. This makes it harder for the baby <b>to</b> <b>latch</b> on properly for feeding. Latching may occur over only part of the areola. This can irritate the nipple more, and may lead to ineffective drainage of breast milk and more pain. Engorgement may begin as a result of several factors such as nipple pain, improper feeding technique, infrequent feeding or infant-mother separation.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Two {{methods are}} {{presented}} for static timing verification of sequential circuits implemented as {{a mix of}} static and domino logic. Constraints for proper operation of domino gates are derived. An important observation is that input signals to domino gates may start changing {{near the end of}} the evaluate phase. The first method models domino gates explicitly, similar <b>to</b> <b>latches.</b> The second method treats domino gates only during pre- and post-processing steps. This method is shown to be more conservative, but easier to compute. ...|$|R

50|$|Modern skiing {{developed}} as an all-round sport with uphill, downhill and cross-country portions. The {{introduction of the}} cable binding started a parallel evolution of binding and boot. The binding looped a strap {{around the back of}} the boot to hold it forward into a metal cup at the toe. Boots with the sole extended rearward to produce a flange for the cable <b>to</b> firmly <b>latch</b> <b>to</b> become common, as did designs with semi-circular indentations on the heel for the same purpose.|$|R
25|$|When {{designing}} a device capable of computing, {{it is often}} necessary to convert parallel data lines into a serial data stream. This conversion allows different pieces of data to {{be reduced to a}} time-dependent series of values on a single wire. Figure 9 shows such a parallel-to-serial conversion QCA device. The numbers on the shaded areas represent different clocking zones at consecutive 90-degree phases. Notice how all the inputs are on the same clocking zone. If parallel data were to be driven at the inputs A, B, C and D, and then driven no more for at least the remaining 15 serial transmission phases, the output X would present the values of D, C, B and A –in that order, at phases three, seven, eleven and fifteen. If a new clocking region were to be added at the output, it could be clocked <b>to</b> <b>latch</b> a value corresponding to any of the inputs by correctly selecting an appropriate state-locking period.|$|E
25|$|Awer Mabil had {{the first}} chance of the match. The Adelaide United forward could have opened the scoring inside the opening five minutes but he failed <b>to</b> <b>latch</b> on to Sergio Cirio's square pass through the penalty area. As the match progressed, Adelaide playmaker Marcelo Carrusca was next to test Perth Glory keeper Danny Vukovic, {{stinging}} the keeper's fingers from long range. Perth's shouts for a penalty on the 25th minutes were waved away by the referee, when Adelaide's keeper Eugene Galekovic and Richard Garcia tangled just outside the area but replays showed Galekovic won the ball. The visiting team racked up the fouls with Garcia and Joshua Risdon earning bookings on the 32nd and 42nd minutes respectively before Mabil squandered an opportunity to break the deadlock in first half injury time. After Carrusca won back possession on halfway, he released Bruce Djite who in turn teed up Mabil who blasted high and wide from eight metres with just the keeper to beat.|$|E
25|$|The {{third day}} of play was blessed with a bright and sunny weather, and the pitch {{remained}} an excellent one for batting. The pair of Dravid and Laxman began in a circumspect fashion, adding only 28 runs in 17 overs, {{a period in which}} the only noteworthy accomplishment made by either sides was Dravid's half-century, which he reached with a front-foot flick to square leg off Stuart MacGill's bowling in the penultimate ball of the 59th over. Not long afterward, in the 65th over, Dravid hit the first boundary of the morning by flicking a loose, low full-toss drifting towards leg-side from MacGill. VVS Laxman, facing the first ball after the drinks break, from Andy Bichel, was dropped by Ricky Ponting when he was batting on 65. The ball was short and nicely dug in, but Laxman tilted the face of the bat at an unusual angle, getting a thick edge towards slips, where Ponting dived full to his left, but was unable <b>to</b> <b>latch</b> on to the ball. Australia would go on to regret this mistake. Sunil Gavaskar noted that Laxman would have a sudden lapse of concentration after prolonged periods of good batting. The two batsmen grew in confidence, however, and they began to bat a little more freely, with Dravid driving every ball in the off-stump line towards extra cover or cover for a boundary, while Laxman use his wristy strokeplay and his good footwork to negotiate the odd ball which kept low, and often dragging off-stump deliveries towards leg-side. This was reminiscent of the way he handled Shane Warne in 2000–01 at Eden, where he hit 281 and along with Dravid, staged a comeback to give India a famous victory. At Lunch, India were securely placed at 252/4 from 83 overs. After lunch, the two batsmen began to stroke boundaries at will, going at a rate of a four every over for the first five overs after lunch, with the highlight of that passage of play being Dravid's century. He miscued a pull from Gillespie's short ball, but had hit it hard enough for it go over the backward-square leg ropes for a six. Then Laxman reached his century as well, in the 89th over, with a single towards mid-wicket, his sixth in tests and his third against Australia, the earlier two being 167 and 281.|$|E

500|$|Several critics praised {{this episode}} for its {{character}} development, {{something that they}} said was missing in the previous episodes.

Canning said that Liz's admission of being somewhat jealous of Jenna's success was a much needed storyline for the show, and one that gave the audience something deeper <b>to</b> <b>latch</b> onto. However, Canning pointed out that small hints of what their friendship was like in the past were played for laughs as opposed to establishing any sort of history.
