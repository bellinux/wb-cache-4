5|$|Hyperbaric {{oxygen therapy}} (HBO) has been {{evaluated}} as an add on treatment following TBI. The {{findings of a}} 2012 Cochrane systematic review does not justify the routine use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> <b>people</b> recovering from a traumatic brain injury. This review also reported {{that only a small}} number of randomized controlled trials had been conducted at the time of the review, many of which had methodological problems and poor reporting. HBO for TBI is controversial with further evidence required to determine if it has a role.|$|E
5|$|The {{plant is}} known for its {{medicinal}} properties and has significant anti-bacterial properties; the leaves and the root have been used to treat bronchitis, cough, earache, wounds and bone fractures by herbalists in countries like Oman. The ground leaves of Tephrosia apollinea are also inhaled to reduce nasal congestion, or boiled with water to make eardrops. Powdered bark can be mixed with water and poured into the ears of camels to alleviate ticks, and powdered leaves {{can be used as a}} paste in the treating of wounds. It can also be rubbed on limbs in conjunction with Fagonia indica and Ocomim basilicum <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> <b>people</b> affected with polio.|$|E
5|$|One area of {{clinical}} research {{is focused on}} treating the underlying disease pathology. Reduction of beta-amyloid levels is a common target of compounds (such as apomorphine) under investigation. Immunotherapy or vaccination for the amyloid protein is one treatment modality under study. Unlike preventative vaccination, the putative therapy would be used <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> <b>people</b> already diagnosed. It {{is based upon the}} concept of training the immune system to recognise, attack, and reverse deposition of amyloid, thereby altering the course of the disease. An example of such a vaccine under investigation was ACC-001, although the trials were suspended in 2008. Another similar agent is bapineuzumab, an antibody designed as identical to the naturally induced anti-amyloid antibody. However, immunotherapeutic agents have been found to cause some concerning adverse drug reactions, such as amyloid-related imaging abnormalities. Other approaches are neuroprotective agents, such as AL-108, and metal-protein interaction attenuation agents, such as PBT2. A TNFα receptor-blocking fusion protein, etanercept has showed encouraging results.|$|E

25|$|A {{reasonable}} guideline is <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> <b>people</b> age >1 year within 3 {{weeks of}} cough onset and infants age <1 year and pregnant women within 6 weeks of cough onset. If {{the person is}} diagnosed late, antibiotics will not alter {{the course of the}} illness, and even without antibiotics, they should no longer be spreading pertussis. Antibiotics when used early decrease the duration of infectiousness, and thus prevent spread. Short-term antibiotics (azithromycin for 3–5 days) are as effective as long-term treatment (erythromycin 10–14 days) in eliminating B. pertussis with fewer and less severe side effects.|$|E

25|$|An early {{exploration}} in 1993–1994 of VRT {{was done by}} Ralph Lamson a USC graduate then at Kaiser Permanente Psychiatry Group. Lamson began publishing his work in 1993. As a psychologist, he was most concerned with the medical and therapeutic aspects, that is, how <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> <b>people</b> using the technology, rather than the apparatus, which was obtained from Division, Inc. Psychology Today reported in 1994 that these 1993–1994 treatments were successful in about 90% of Lamson's virtual psychotherapy patients. Lamson wrote in 1993 a book entitled Virtual Therapy {{which was published in}} 1997 directed primarily to the detailed explanation of the anatomical, medical and therapeutic basis for the success of VRT. In 1994–1995, he had solved his own acrophobia in a test use of a third party VR simulation and then set up a 40 patient test funded by Kaiser Permanente. Shortly thereafter, in 1994–1995, Larry Hodges, then a computer scientist at Georgia Tech active in VR, began studying VRT in cooperation with Max North who had reported anomalous behavior in flying carpet simulation VR studies and attributed such to phobic response of unknown nature. Hodges tried to hire Lamson without success in 1994 and instead began working with Barbara Rothbaum, a psychologist at Emory University to test VRT in controlled group tests, experiencing about 70% success among 50% of subjects completing the testing program.|$|E
500|$|The medical {{approach}} to consciousness is practically oriented.

40|$|This paper reviews {{evidence}} {{for using the}} "cognitive enhancer" D-Cycloserine (DCS) <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> anxious young <b>people.</b> Adult studies indicate DCS consolidates fear extinction learning into memory during exposure therapy, thereby increasing the speed of remission. This paper examines basic research indicating both fear extinction and DCS may work differently in younger animals compared to adults. It reviews trials using DCS to enhance treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder in youths. Given there is often ambivalence about using medication <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> young <b>people,</b> this paper also reviews current research examining parental attitudes to DCS. It considers specific challenges facing DCS research, {{particularly with regard to}} maintaining experimental control and managing negative perceptions associated with using medication. Finally, this paper considers current research underway, particularly with regard to using DCS <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> young <b>people</b> with specific phobias. Overall, findings indicate that DCS shows promise for enhancing the treatment of anxiety in young people, but further investigation is needed to determine whether it provides significant benefits over and above current therapies.
