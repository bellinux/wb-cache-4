This essay will analyze what are reputed to be the main indicators of adulthood in a postmodern context, a context that seems to increasingly question their value: the completion of education, living independently, work, marriage, parenthood, political participation, religiousness and spirituality, the abandonment of deviant behaviors...|$|R
50|$|Without {{deciding}} whether the railroad company could assign {{the right to}} sue for and enforce these taxes to Mr. Sully, it is sufficient to say that the assignment did not carry that right to him discharged of the equities between the company and the taxpayers, as if <b>they</b> had <b>been</b> <b>negotiable</b> bonds. To any suit, therefore, to invalidate this tax the company was a necessary party. It is especially so in equity, where the matter set up to defeat the tax, as in this case, was the failure of the company to comply with the conditions of the vote, and its false and fraudulent representations by which the vote was secured. In such a suit, the company has a right to defend against these allegations, and the plaintiffs have a right that the company shall be bound by the judgment in the case. The interest of Sully and the company in this controversy are the same, and are both opposed to the interests of plaintiffs. This railroad company is organized under the laws of Iowa, and is a citizen of that state as well as plaintiffs.|$|R
40|$|The Rotterdam Rules {{have come}} to {{harmonise}} and update the law of international carriage of goods wholly or partly by sea. This Convention has been praised for being {{more aware of the}} interrelation between carriage and international sale contracts. The objective of this thesis is to investigate the impact that the Rotterdam Rules will have on international commercial sales when the applicable law is English law. The focus of the research has been placed on the provisions of the Rotterdam Rules which have been inserted to facilitate trade. The international trade of goods heavily relies on documentary performance. The transport documents are of the utmost significance and where <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>negotiable,</b> they enable sales down a string through transfer of a document of title. The provisions of the Rotterdam Rules allowing the seller to obtain the appropriate document for tender to the buyer have been examined, to discover possible implications on CIF and FOB contracts. Thus, study of the compatibility of the Rotterdam Rules with the Incoterms is critical. Equally significant has been the research of the relation between the requirements a transport document or electronic record should satisfy under the Rotterdam Rules and a letter of credit governed by the UCP 600, as this is the preferred method of payment in modern overseas sales. Moreover this thesis investigates {{the way in which the}} transport document can secure the seller’s and buyer’s rights under their contract of sale, if issued in an electronic form. Currently there is a particular interest in paperless contracting especially in the oil trade. Thus, whether the Rotterdam Rules can operate successfully, along with eUCP and modern registries and what law reforms need to take place to optimise trade facilitation and certainty in this area have also been examined. Finally because international sale agreements incorporate English law due to the advantages of freedom of contract, this made necessary the discussion of the trade dimensions of a volume contract that derogates from the Rotterdam Rules. The fluctuating balance between codification, consolidation of legal principles and freedom of contract as reflected by the Rotterdam Rules and texts of other rule-setting organisations underpins the findings of this thesis. Thus, not surprisingly, the way the Rotterdam Rules, which are a piece of international codification, legitimise freedom of contract in agreements that would otherwise be subject to a mandatory regime deserves special consideration. All the chapters are strongly interrelated both in conceptual and teleological legal terms. This thesis asserts that the trade implications from the application of the Rotterdam Rules are due to the idiosyncrasies of the regulation of carriage and trade laws. Although they may touch upon common concepts, they are constituted by varied legal sources and drafted by delegations, which, due to their background and composition harmonise the law based on different priorities. This justifies the synergies identified in this thesis; it is a thesis which goes beyond the implications identified and suggests the way forward so that the Rotterdam Rules can have a positive effect on sales concluded on shipment terms...|$|E

40|$|This project {{examines}} {{the depiction of}} Jewish and Christian identity in Acts of the Apostles by placing the writer’s ethnic claims within a broader material and epigraphic context. Scholarship on Jewish identity in Acts has often emphasized Jewish and Christian religious difference, an emphasis that has tended to mask the intersections of civic, ethnic, and religious identifications in antiquity. Such identity categories did not exist as distinct, stable entities. Rather, as discussions of identity in antiquity demonstrate, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> contested, <b>negotiable,</b> and ambiguous. Bringing Acts into conversation with recent scholarly insights regarding identity as represented in Roman era material and epigraphic remains shows that Acts presents Jews and Jewish identity in multiple, complex ways, {{rather than as a}} simple foil for “Christianity. ” The dissertation argues that when the modern distinctions between ethnic, religious, and civic identities are suspended, the innovative ethnic rhetoric of the author of Acts comes into focus. The underlying connection between ethnic, religious, and civic identities provided him with space to present non-Jewish Christians as converted Jews and therefore to identify all Christians as Jews. On the basis of this identification, he marked Christians as a unified Jewish community that enhanced the stability of the city, contrasting them with other Jewish communities. By creating an internal distinction between Christians and other Jews, he privileged Christians as the members of an ideal, unified Jewish community and contrasted them with what he identified as factious, local Jewish associations...|$|R
6000|$|I {{remember}} these women as immense. No doubt <b>they</b> <b>were</b> of <b>negotiable</b> size, but I {{was only a}} very little chap and they have assumed nightmare proportions in my mind. They loomed, they bulged, they impended. Mrs. Mackridge was large and dark; there was a marvel about her head, inasmuch as she was bald. She wore a dignified cap, {{and in front of}} that upon her brow, hair was PAINTED. I have never seen the like since. She had been maid to the widow of Sir Roderick Blenderhasset Impey, some sort of governor or such-like portent in the East Indies, and from her remains--in Mrs. Mackridge--I judge Lady Impey was a very stupendous and crushing creature indeed. Lady Impey had been of the Juno type, haughty, unapproachable, given to irony and a caustic wit. Mrs. Mackridge had no wit, but she had acquired the caustic voice and gestures along with the old satins and trimmings of the great lady. When she told you it was a fine morning, she seemed also to be telling you you were a fool and a low fool to boot; when she was spoken to, she had a way of acknowledging your poor tinkle of utterance with a voluminous, scornful [...] "Haw!" [...] that made you want to burn her alive. She also had a way of saying [...] "Indade!" [...] with a droop of the eyelids.|$|R
