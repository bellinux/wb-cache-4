5|$|The <b>tape</b> <b>loops</b> {{were played}} on BTR3 tape {{machines}} located in various studios of the Abbey Road building {{and controlled by}} EMI technicians in Studio Two at Abbey Road on 7 April. Each machine was monitored by one technician, who had to hold a pencil within each loop to maintain tension. The four Beatles controlled the faders of the mixing console while Martin varied the stereo panning and Emerick watched the meters. Eight of the tapes were used at one time, changed halfway through the song. The tapes were made (like {{most of the other}} loops) by superimposition and acceleration. According to Martin, the finished mix of the <b>tape</b> <b>loops</b> could not be repeated because of the complex and random way in which they were laid over the music.|$|E
5|$|Lennon {{considered}} the song his greatest accomplishment. The track incorporates reverse-recorded instrumentation and <b>tape</b> <b>loops,</b> and was created from the editing together of two separate {{versions of the}} song – each one entirely different in tempo, mood and musical key. The song was later included on the US Magical Mystery Tour LP (although not on the British double EP package of the same name).|$|E
25|$|Akita's {{early work}} {{consisted}} of industrial noise music made from <b>tape</b> <b>loops</b> and conventional instruments. Similar to his present albums, he produced lengthy, disorienting pieces. He also became {{famous for the}} sheer volume of his releases.|$|E

25|$|Froese {{was fascinated}} by {{technology}} and skilled in using it to create music. He built custom-made instruments and, wherever he went, collected sounds with tape recorders for use in constructing musical works later. His early work with <b>tape</b> <b>loops</b> and other repeating sounds was the obvious precursor to the emerging technology of the sequencer, which Tangerine Dream quickly adopted upon its arrival.|$|E
25|$|The Feraliminal Lycanthropizer is {{a fictional}} machine invented by American writer David Woodard, whose 1990 {{pamphlet}} {{of the same}} title speculates on its history and purpose. The brief, anonymously published work describes a vibration referred to as thanato-auric waves, which the machine electrically generates by combining three infrasonic sine waves (3Hz, 9Hz and 0.56Hz) with concomitant <b>tape</b> <b>loops</b> of unspecified spoken text (two beyond the threshold of decipherability, and two beneath the threshold).|$|E
25|$|Initially Eno {{began to}} {{experiment}} with <b>tape</b> <b>loops</b> {{in the creation of}} these music systems. Later he created systems that incorporated the use of several CDs with material he had specifically created for random playback, in order to make music of indeterminate duration. Then in 1995 he began working with the company Intermorphic to create generative music with programmed algorithms. The cooperation with Intermorphic led Eno to release Generative Music 1 (requires the Intermorphic's Koan Player software for PC), so as to make it possible to offer his generative explorations to the public as intended - enabling generative playback. Eventually Eno also explored the Adobe Flash format to release 77 Million Paintings in 2006. For PC and Mac, again, this enabled Eno to offer his generative explorations to the public as intended. Essentially 77 Million Paintings returns to the methodology of random playback utilized in his earlier work with <b>tape</b> <b>loops</b> and CD (as in it does not incorporate programmed algorithms). More recent;y, sparked by possibilities presented to Brian Eno and Peter Chilvers while working together on the generative soundtrack for the video game Spore (2008) the two began to release generative music in the Apple App format starting with the release of Bloom (2008) on up to their last release: Reflection (Apple App generative version: 2016).|$|E

25|$|Behind the scenes, Miles and Teo {{took the}} tapes of the In a Silent Way {{sessions}} and transformed some beautiful, folk-tinged, melody-driven sets into two exquisite, beguiling and otherworldly pieces of music. Using techniques that pre-dated {{the proliferation of}} <b>tape</b> <b>loops,</b> cut-ups, edits and sequencing in rock, pop, hip hop and dance music, Miles and Teo took apart the original recording and reassembled them outside of any traditional or accepted jazz structure or melodic framework. This idea of taking jazz away from its birth, genesis and flowering as a live art and into the studio would soon become standard practice, but in 1969 it was groundbreaking.|$|E
25|$|Delay is {{an audio}} effect and an effects unit which records an input signal to an audio storage medium, and then plays it {{back after a}} period of time. The delayed signal may either be played back {{multiple}} times, or played back into the recording again, to create the sound of a repeating, decaying echo. Delay effects range from a subtle echo effect to a pronounced blending of previous sounds with new sounds. Delay effects can be created using <b>tape</b> <b>loops,</b> an approach developed in the 1940s and 1950s; analog effects units, which were introduced in the 1970s; digital effects pedals, introduced in 1984; and audio software plugins, developed in the 2000s.|$|E
25|$|After Twitch, Jourgensen {{made the}} most {{significant}} change in Ministry's history when he resumed playing electric guitar. Jourgensen also brought bass guitarist Paul Barker of the Seattle band The Blackouts into the Ministry camp; Barker would remain Jourgensen's bandmate for many years {{when he was the}} only person credited {{as a member of the}} band other than Jourgensen. With the addition of The Blackouts drummer William Rieflin, Ministry recorded The Land of Rape and Honey (1988). The album continued their success in the underground music scene. The Land of Rape and Honey made use of synthesizers, keyboards, <b>tape</b> <b>loops,</b> jackhammering drum machines, dialogue excerpted from movies, unconventional electronic processing, and, in parts, heavy distorted electric guitar and bass.|$|E

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, composers of classical music were experimenting with an increasingly dissonant pitch language, which sometimes yielded atonal pieces. Following World War I, as a backlash against what they saw as the increasingly exaggerated gestures and formlessness of late Romanticism, certain composers adopted a neoclassic style, which sought to recapture the balanced forms and clearly perceptible thematic processes of earlier styles (see also New Objectivity and Social Realism). After World War II, modernist composers sought to achieve greater levels of control in their composition process (e.g., through the use of the twelve tone technique and later total serialism). At the same time, conversely, composers also experimented with means of abdicating control, exploring indeterminacy or aleatoric processes in smaller or larger degrees. Technological advances led to the birth of electronic music. Experimentation with <b>tape</b> <b>loops</b> and repetitive textures contributed to the advent of minimalism. Still other composers started exploring the theatrical potential of the musical performance (performance art, mixed media, fluxus).|$|E

50|$|Frippertronics is a {{specific}} <b>tape</b> <b>looping</b> technique used by Robert Fripp. It evolved from a system of <b>tape</b> <b>looping</b> originally developed in the electronic music studios of the early 1960s that was first used by composers Terry Riley and Pauline Oliveros and made popular through its use in ambient music by composer Brian Eno. The effect is now routinely found in many commercial loop station guitar digital effects boxes such as the Boss RC-3.|$|R

5000|$|Introduction of new technologies, such as analog music sequencers and synthesizers in the 1970s, {{followed}} by digital sequencers in 1977, marked {{an end of}} the <b>tape</b> <b>loop</b> era.

5000|$|While Louis {{spent most}} of his time {{building}} the circuits and was responsible for all of the recording, Bebe did the composing. She had to sort through many hours of tape. As she said, [...] "it just sounded like dirty noise". Over time, she developed the ability to determine which sounds could become something of interest. They may also have invented the <b>tape</b> <b>loop.</b> The <b>tape</b> <b>loop</b> gave the Barrons' sounds rhythm. They mixed the sounds to create the otherworldly and strange electronic soundscapes required by Forbidden Planet.|$|R
