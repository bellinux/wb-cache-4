30|$|A {{common mistake}} in {{macroeconomic}} analysis that may potentially lead to misguided policies is to confuse demand factors {{of economic growth}} with supply factors. As far as <b>the</b> potential <b>growth</b> rate is concerned, demand factors can only influence <b>the</b> difference, i.e., <b>growth</b> gap, between <b>the</b> real <b>growth</b> rate and <b>the</b> potential <b>growth</b> rate. A strong short-term demand can push <b>the</b> real <b>growth</b> rate beyond potential growth capacity, while inadequate demand can cause real growth to fall short of potential <b>growth</b> capacity. However, <b>the</b> potential of economic growth ultimately depends on <b>the</b> potential <b>growth</b> rate, which is constrained by production factors {{on one hand and}} TFP on the other. Therefore, without an increase to <b>the</b> potential <b>growth</b> rate, expanding demand arbitrarily in order to spur economic growth may cause real economic <b>growth</b> to exceed <b>the</b> potential <b>growth</b> rate, which may also lead to distortion.|$|R

5|$|Culture {{techniques}} {{are designed to}} promote <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> and identify particular bacteria, while restricting <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> of the other bacteria in the sample. Often these {{techniques are}} designed for specific specimens; for example, a sputum sample will be treated to identify organisms that cause pneumonia, while stool specimens are cultured on selective media to identify organisms that cause diarrhoea, while preventing growth of non-pathogenic bacteria. Specimens that are normally sterile, such as blood, urine or spinal fluid, are cultured under conditions designed to grow all possible organisms. Once a pathogenic organism has been isolated, it can be further characterised by its morphology, growth patterns (such as aerobic or anaerobic growth), patterns of hemolysis, and staining.|$|E

Fire suppression polices have been replaced by a fire management program which includes the annual use of prescribed fires. Fire is especially important to the giant sequoia groves, whose seeds cannot germinate without fire-touched soil.|$|E
