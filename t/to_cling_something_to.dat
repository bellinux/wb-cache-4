5000|$|Some {{historians have}} {{suggested}} that Myers was strongly biased {{to believe in the}} paranormal and held a secret religious agenda. After the publication of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species (1859), it was difficult for those with a scientific education to retain a belief in tenets of the Judeo-Christian religion. Early SPR members like Myers and Henry Sidgwick hoped <b>to</b> <b>cling</b> <b>to</b> <b>something</b> spiritual through psychical research. Psychical researcher Eric Dingwall wrote regarding the early formation of the Society for Psychical Research, [...] "Myers, among others... knew that the primary aim of the society was not objective experimentation but the establishment of telepathy." ...|$|R
5000|$|Sceptics have criticised {{members of}} the SPR for having motives liable to impair {{scientific}} objectivity. According to SPR critics John Grant and Eric Dingwall, early SPR members such as Henry Sidgwick, Frederic W. H. Myers, and William Barrett hoped <b>to</b> <b>cling</b> <b>to</b> <b>something</b> spiritual through psychical research. Myers stated that [...] "The Society for Psychical Research was founded, {{with the establishment of}} thought-transference--already rising within measurable distance of proof--as its primary aim." [...] Defenders of the SPR have stated in reply that [...] "a ‘will to believe’ in post-mortem survival, telepathy and other scientifically unpopular notions, does not necessarily exclude a [...] "will to know" [...] and thus the capacity for thorough self-criticism, methodological rigour and relentless suspicion of errors." ...|$|R
60|$|Agatha {{struggled}} {{forward as}} far as the near horse's shoulder. The beasts slightly sheltered her, and it was a little easier walking with a hand upon a trace. It was a relief <b>to</b> <b>cling</b> <b>to</b> <b>something,</b> for the wind that flung the snow into her face drove her garments against her limbs, so that now and then she could scarcely move. Indeed, when her strength commenced to flag, every yard of that journey was made with infinite pain and difficulty. At times she could scarcely see the horses, and again she stumbled along beside them for minutes, blinded, breathless, and half-dazed. She did not know how Hastings was faring, but she half-consciously recognised that if once she let the trace go the sled would slip away from her and she would sink down to freeze.|$|R
5000|$|... the Sheets" [...] was {{probably}} the easiest song I've written, but actually when I listen back to the lyrics they are actually quite meaningful. They are about a girl and a guy {{who are in a}} relationship but it's a very dark relationship in that it's only based on being physical. It's not like a sexual song, it's more like shows that some relationships are based on nothing that is real, they are not based on something good. I've had that experience in my life, because you're trying <b>to</b> <b>cling</b> on <b>to</b> <b>something</b> that you know you're in denial. That's what the song is about in that you know the world won't bring us down, you can be as happy as Larry inside your house with your boyfriend or lover, but as soon as you step outside you're in the real world and {{you have to deal with}} it.|$|R
6000|$|The pink berries glowed on {{the grey}} stone, {{and he had}} yet another memory. A family {{occasion}} when Uncle Martin Scudamore departed this life, and they all went up to bury him and hear his Will. The old chap, whom they had looked on {{as a bit of}} a disgrace, money-grubbing up in the little grey Yorkshire town which owed its rise to his factory, was expected to make amends by his death, for he had never married--too sunk in Industry, apparently, to have the time. By tacit agreement, his nephews and nieces had selected the Inn at Bolton Abbey, nearest beauty spot, for their stay. They had driven six miles to the funeral in three carriages. Alicia had gone with him and his brother, the solicitor. In her plain black clothes she looked quite charming, in spite of the silver threads already thick in her fine dark hair, loosened by the moor wind. She had talked of painting to him with all her old enthusiasm, and her eyes had seemed to linger on his face as if she still had a little weakness for him. He had quite enjoyed that drive. They had come rather abruptly on the small grimy town <b>clinging</b> <b>to</b> the river-banks, with old Martin's long yellow-brick house dominating it, about two hundred yards above the mills. Suddenly under the rug he felt Alicia's hand seize his with a sort of desperation, for all the world as if she were <b>clinging</b> <b>to</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> support her. Indeed, he was sure she did not know it was his hand she squeezed. The cobbled streets, the muddy-looking water, the dingy, staring factories, the yellow staring house, the little dark-clothed, dreadfully plain work-people, all turned out to do a last honour to their creator; the hideous new grey church, the dismal service, the brand-new tombstones--and all of a glorious autumn day! It was inexpressibly sordid--too ugly for words! Afterwards the Will was read to them, seated decorously on bright mahogany chairs in the yellow mansion; a very satisfactory Will, distributing in perfectly adjusted portions, to his own kinsfolk and nobody else, a very considerable wealth. Scudamore had listened to it dreamily, with his eyes fixed on an oily picture, thinking: [...] "My God! What a thing!" [...] and longing {{to be back in the}} carriage smoking a cigar to take the reek of black clothes, and sherry--sherry!--out of his nostrils. He happened to look at Alicia. Her eyes were closed; her lips, always sweet-looking, quivered amusedly. And at that very moment the Will came to her name. He saw those eyes open wide, and marked a beautiful pink flush, quite like that of old days, come into her thin cheeks. [...] "Splendid!" [...] he had thought; [...] "it's really jolly for her. I am glad. Now she won't have to pinch. Splendid!" [...] He shared with her to the full the surprised relief showing in her still beautiful face.|$|R

Since I must <b>cling</b> <b>to</b> <b>something,</b> I choose the noblest I can find, and look up, not down, forevermore," [...] she said; for like many weak and timid creatures, she was easily guided, and it was well for her that Violet's example had been a brave one.|$|R
60|$|He {{checked on}} the threshold, and turned; and {{there from the}} cool gloom of the hall she saw him a black, graceful {{silhouette}} against the brilliant sunshine beyond--a memory of him that was <b>to</b> <b>cling</b> as <b>something</b> sinister and menacing in the dread hours that were to follow.|$|R

It may hurt her a little to tear that love away, but it won't kill her; {{and in the end}} it will be best for her. You need a good wife. What could I do with a woman? Go in and win her, Jim." ...|$|R
50|$|Benign {{paroxysmal}} vertigo {{of childhood}} is an uncommon disorder which presents with recurrent episodes of dizziness. The presentation is usually {{between the ages}} of 2 years and 7 years of age and is characterised by short episodes of vertigo of sudden onset when the child appears distressed and unwell. He or she may <b>cling</b> <b>to</b> <b>something</b> or someone for support. The episode lasts only minutes and resolves suddenly and completely. It is a self-limiting condition and usually resolves after about eighteen months although many go on to experience migrainous vertigo (or vertiginous migraine) when older.|$|R

"As {{the tree}} falleth, so shall it lie," [...] said Wayne's voice {{out of the}} darkness, and it had the same sweet and yet horrible air that it had had throughout, of coming from a great distance, from {{before or after the}} event. Even when he was {{struggling}} like an eel or battering like a madman, he spoke like a spectator. [...] "As the tree falleth, so shall it lie," [...] he said. [...] "Men have called that a gloomy text. It is the essence of all exultation. I am doing now what I have done all my life, what is the only happiness, what is the only universality. I am <b>clinging</b> <b>to</b> <b>something.</b> Let it fall, and there let it lie. Fools, you go about and see the kingdoms of the earth, and are liberal and wise and cosmopolitan, which is all that the devil can give you--all that he could offer to Christ, only to be spurned away. I am doing what the truly wise do. When a child goes out into the garden and takes hold of a tree, saying, 'Let this tree be all I have,' that moment its roots take hold on hell and its branches on the stars. The joy I have is what the lover knows when a woman is everything. It is what a savage knows when his idol is everything. It is what I know when Notting Hill is everything. I have a city. Let it stand or fall." ...|$|R
60|$|In the {{beginning}}--there {{never was}} any beginning, but let it pass. We've {{got to make}} a start somehow. In the very beginning of all things, time and space and cosmos and being, in the beginning of all these was a little living creature. But I don't know even if it was little. In the beginning was a living creature, its plasm quivering and its life-pulse throbbing. This little creature died, as little creatures always do. But not before it had had young ones. When the daddy creature died, it fell to pieces. And {{that was the beginning of}} the cosmos. Its little body fell down to a speck of dust, which the young ones clung to because they must <b>cling</b> <b>to</b> <b>something.</b> Its little breath flew asunder, the hotness and brightness of the little beast--I beg your pardon, I mean the radiant energy from the corpse flew away to the right hand, and seemed to shine warm in the air, while the clammy energy from the body flew away to the left hand, and seemed dark and cold. And so, the first little master was dead and done for, and instead of his little living body there was a speck of dust in the middle, which became the earth, and on the right hand was a brightness which became the sun, rampaging with all the energy that had come out of the dead little master, and on the left hand a darkness which felt like an unrisen moon. And that was how the Lord created the world. Except that I know nothing about the Lord, so I shouldn't mention it.|$|R

5000|$|For centuries, Man {{has looked}} to the skies and sought to uncover {{the mystery of the}} universe. The {{telescope}} brought into focus the craters on the Moon and the canals on Mars, but it was limited, and Mans insistent hunger for knowledge and experience would not be satisfied until he broke the massive chains of gravity and set foot himself on a planet other than his own. Project Mercury was his first venture into space — a testament to his technical ingenuity and courage, a green light to a hundred other projects which would take him still further. This is Project Adonnis, a laboratory orbiting a thousand miles above the Earth, a tiny, far-flung world connected only by radio and memory, and inhabited by a handful of men dedicated to removing the unknown for future space travelers.
