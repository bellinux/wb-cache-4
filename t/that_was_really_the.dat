500|$|The {{introduction}} of Orochimaru {{to the series}} was first suggested by Masashi Kishimoto's superiors {{in order to improve}} the series' popularity. Kishimoto believed the series grew personality based on the Chunin Exams story arc and wanted it to end normally with Shikamaru Nara's victory. However, he eventually accepted their advised and Orochimaru was set up to interrupt this arc. As one of the villains in the story, Kishimoto created Orochimaru as an antithesis to the protagonists' values. His snake-like appearance and related features were intended {{to make it easier for}} the reader to recognize that he is a villain. In an interview, Kishimoto asserted that making the villains [...] "flamboyant" [...] was one of his [...] "guiding principles," [...] and attributed this to his desire to have the villains have a [...] "powerful aura." [...] When asked if Orochimaru was still good, Kishimoto answered that Orochimaru is [...] "truly evil" [...] and that he is one of the several [...] "hopeless evil characters" [...] that appear in the series. Originally Kishimoto planned to make Orochimaru's look androgynous. However, because of the concept of him being a strong antagonist, he made him more creepy. Of most of the characters, Orochimaru was hardest one to write. Kishimoto wanted wanted him to be a terrifying opponent, so he wondered if <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> way to go to make him sound strong. Then I started thinking it was good like that, he's strong and creepy, and the creepyness started increasing.|$|E

2500|$|Once an {{instrumental}} track was completed, vocals {{would then be}} overdubbed by the group. Carl said about the Beach Boys' vocal arrangements: [...] "Our vocals were voiced like horn parts, the way those R records make background vocals sound like a sax section. It sounded big, because the four parts were all within the same octave; <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> secret. He used a lot of counterpoint, a lot of layered sound; it had a real depth to it. We didn’t just duplicate parts; we didn’t just sing at octaves; that would sound really lame, very square." ...|$|E

5000|$|The artist Marc Quinn has said, “Hudson aligns {{himself with}} an irreverent and {{eccentric}} British tradition in art <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> saviour of it… it’s a lineage of non-conformity yet quintessentially Britishness <b>that</b> <b>is</b> unique… Hudson has reinvented this tradition in his visual, trembling, vibrating, sculpted paintings.” ...|$|R

When once one comes away one must arrive somewhere, and I asked myself why I should n't arrive here." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, gentlemen," [...] said Bertram {{with more}} {{emphasis}} {{in his tone}} than he was wont to employ, [...] "I have seen this man only once, but I've seen him under two aspects to-day, and all that I can say is, that if <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> Wild Man of the West, he's not quite so wild as he gets credit for." ...|$|E
60|$|And <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> situation. The seven great trusts, working together, had pooled their {{enormous}} surpluses {{and made}} a farm trust. The railroads, controlling rates, and the bankers and stock exchange gamesters, controlling prices, had long since bled the farmers into indebtedness. The bankers, and all the trusts for that matter, had likewise long since loaned colossal amounts of money to the farmers. The farmers were in the net. All that remained to be done was the drawing in of the net. This the farm trust proceeded to do.|$|E
60|$|<b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> {{best part}} of the whole thing. It was all very well for Alice to talk about {{creeping}} and spying, but, if you considered it without bias, there was nothing degrading about it at all. It was an art. It took brains and a genius for disguise to make a man a successful creeper and spyer. You couldn't simply say to yourself, 'I will creep.' If you attempted to do it in your own person, you would be detected instantly. You had to be an adept at masking your personality. You had to be one man at Bristol and another quite different man at Hull--especially if, like Henry, you were of a gregarious disposition, and liked the society of actors.|$|E

You couldn't call them useful, could you?" ...|$|R

60|$|Joscelyn's {{new play}} was a homely, {{pleasant}} production with rollicking comedy and heart-moving pathos skilfully commingled. Joscelyn pervaded {{it all with}} a convincing simplicity <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> triumph of art. Cyrus Morgan listened and exulted in her; at every burst of applause his eyes gleamed with pride. He {{wanted to go on}} the stage and box the ears of the villain who plotted against her; he wanted to shake hands with the good woman who stood by her; he wanted to pay off the mortgage and make Josie happy. He wiped tears from his eyes in the third act when Josie was turned out of doors and, when the fourth left her a happy, blushing bride, hand in hand with her farmer lover, he could have wept again for joy.|$|E
60|$|But the {{particular}} wasp at table I {{had in my}} mind remains to be spoken of. I was lunching {{at the house of}} a friend, the vicar of a lonely parish in Hampshire, and besides ourselves there were five ladies, four of them young, at our round table. The window stood open, and by-and-by a wasp flew in and began to investigate the dishes, the plates, then the eaters themselves, impartially buzzing before each face in turn. On his last round, before taking his departure, he continued to buzz so long before my face, first in front of one eye then the other, as if {{to make sure that they}} were fellows and had the same expression, that I at length impatiently remarked that I did not care for his too flattering attentions. And <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> only inconsiderate or inhospitable word his visit had called forth. Yet there were, I have said, five ladies present! They had neither welcomed nor repelled him, and had not regarded him; and although it was impossible to be unconscious of his presence at table, it was as if he had not been there. But then these ladies were cyclists: one, in addition to the beautiful brown colour with which the sun had painted her face, showed some dark and purple stains on cheek and forehead--marks of a resent dangerous collision with a stone wall at the foot of a steep hill.|$|E
60|$|Dudley Pickering {{had watched}} these proceedings--as {{well as the}} fact that it was {{extremely}} dark and that he was endeavouring to hide a portly form behind a slender bush would permit him--with a sense of bewilderment. A comic artist drawing Mr Pickering at that moment would no doubt have placed above his head one of those large marks of interrogation which lend vigour and snap to modern comic art. Certainly such a mark of interrogation would have summed up his feelings exactly. Of what was taking place he had not the remotest notion. All he knew was that for some inexplicable reason his quarry had come to a halt and seemed to have settled down for an indefinite stay. Voices came to him in an indistinguishable murmur, intensely irritating to a conscientious tracker. One of Fenimore Cooper's Indians--notably Chingachgook, if, which seemed incredible, <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> man's name--would have crept up without a sound and heard what was being said and got in on the ground floor of whatever plot was being hatched. But experience had taught Mr Pickering that, superior as he was to Chingachgook and his friends in many ways, as a creeper he was not in their class. He weighed thirty or forty pounds more than a first-class creeper should. Besides, creeping is like golf. You can't take it up in the middle forties and expect to compete with those who have been at it from infancy.|$|E
6000|$|Perhaps, by <b>the</b> by, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> Problem: where <b>is</b> {{the early}} husband to {{disappear}} to? Even if {{every time he}} saw her coming he were to duck under the table, somebody would be sure to notice it and make remarks. Ought he to take himself out one dark night, tie a brick round his neck, and throw himself into a pond? ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Because, my dear girl," [...] I answered, [...] "it is less {{unlike the}} house I wanted than other houses I have seen. When we are young we make up our minds {{to try and}} get what we want; when we have arrived at years of {{discretion}} we decide to try and want what we can get. It saves time. During the last two years I have seen about sixty houses, and out of the lot there was only one <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> house I wanted. Hitherto I have kept the story to myself. Even now, thinking about it irritates me. It was not an agent who told me of it. I met a man by chance in a railway carriage. He had a black eye. If ever I meet him again I'll give him another. He accounted for it by explaining that he had had trouble with a golf ball, and at the time I believed him. I mentioned to him in conversation I was looking for a house. He described this place to me, {{and it seemed to me}} hours before the train stopped at a station. When it did I got out and took the next train back. I did not even wait for lunch. I had my bicycle with me, and I went straight there. It was--well, it was the house I wanted. If it had vanished suddenly, and I had found myself in bed, the whole thing would have seemed more reasonable. The proprietor opened the door to me himself. He had the bearing of a retired military man. It was afterwards I learnt he was the proprietor.|$|E
60|$|But {{besides the}} natural sweets, {{we have also}} taken to {{producing}} artificial ones. Has any housewife ever realised the alarming condition of cookery in the benighted generations before the invention of sugar? It is really almost too appalling to think about. So many things that we now look upon as all but necessaries--cakes, puddings, made dishes, confectionery, preserves, sweet biscuits, jellies, cooked fruits, tarts, and so forth--were then practically quite impossible. Fancy attempting nowadays to live a single day without sugar; no tea, no coffee, no jam, no pudding, no cake, no sweets, no hot toddy before one goes to bed; the bare idea of it is too terrible. And yet <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> abject condition of all the civilised world up {{to the middle of}} the middle ages. Horace's punch was sugarless and lemonless; the gentle Virgil never tasted the congenial cup of afternoon tea; and Socrates went from his cradle to his grave without ever knowing the flavour of peppermint bull's eyes. How the children managed to spend their Saturday as, or their weekly obolus, is a profound mystery. To be sure, people had honey; but honey is rare, dear, and scanty; it can never have filled one quarter the place that sugar fills in our modern affections. Try for a moment to realise drinking honey with one's whisky-and-water, or doing the year's preserving with a pot of best Narbonne, and you get at once a common measure of the difference between the two as practical sweeteners. Nowadays, we get sugar from cane and beet-root in abundance, while sugar-maples and palm-trees of various sorts afford a considerable supply to remoter countries. But the childhood of the little Greeks and Romans must have been absolutely unlighted by a single ray of joy from chocolate creams or Everton toffee.|$|E
6000|$|For {{the figure}} {{to which these}} {{questions}} attached themselves she had found a convenient description--she thought of it for herself, always, {{as that of a}} girl with a background. The great reality was in the fact that, very soon, after but two or three meetings, the girl with the background, the girl with the crown of old gold and the mourning that was not as the mourning of Boston, but at once more rebellious in its gloom and more frivolous in its frills, had told her she had never seen any one like her. They had met thus as opposed curiosities, and that simple remark of Milly's--if simple it was--became {{the most important thing that}} had ever happened to her; it deprived the love-interest, for the time, of actuality and even of pertinence; it moved her first, in short, in a high degree, to gratitude, and then to no small compassion. Yet in respect to this relation at least it was what did prove the key of knowledge; it lighted up as nothing else could do the poor young woman's history. That the potential heiress of all the ages should never have seen any one like a mere typical subscriber, after all, to the [...] "Transcript" [...] was a truth that--in especial as announced with modesty, with humility, with regret--described a situation. It laid upon the elder woman, as to the void to be filled, a weight of responsibility; but in particular it led her to ask whom poor Mildred had then seen, and what range of contacts it had taken to produce such queer surprises. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> inquiry that had ended by clearing the air: the key of knowledge was felt to click in the lock from the moment it flashed upon Mrs. Stringham that her friend had been starved for culture. Culture was what she herself represented for her, and it was living up to that principle that would surely prove the great business. She knew, the clever lady, what the principle itself represented, and the limits of her own store; and a certain alarm would have grown upon her if something else hadn't grown faster.|$|E
