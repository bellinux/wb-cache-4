They work hard at maintaining/protecting their self-concept. Because their lives are not authentic <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> task and they are under constant threat. They deploy defense mechanisms to achieve this. He describes two mechanisms: distortion and denial. Distortion occurs when the individual perceives a threat to their self-concept. They distort the perception until it fits their self-concept.|$|E
25|$|If {{the cancer}} has been {{diagnosed}} {{while still in}} an early stage, surgical treatment with a curative intention may be possible. Some small tumors that only involve the mucosa or lining of the esophagus may be removed by endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR). Otherwise, curative surgery of early-stage lesions may entail removal of {{all or part of}} the esophagus (esophagectomy), although <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> operation with a relatively high risk of mortality or post-operative difficulties. The benefits of surgery are less clear in early-stage ESCC than EAC. There are a number of surgical options, and the best choices for particular situations remain the subject of research and discussion. As well as characteristics and location of the tumor, other factors include the patient's condition, and the type of operation the surgical team is most experienced with.|$|E
25|$|In all {{most any}} of the methods in {{simulation}} of ion channels, the major computational cost comes from the calculation of electrostatic forces acting on the ions. In continuum models, for instance, where ionic density exist rather than explicit ions, the electrostatic potential is calculated in a self-consistent manner by solving the Poisson equation. In MD simulations, on the other hand, the electrostatic forces acting on the particles are calculated by explicit evaluation of the Coulombic force term, often splitting the short-range and long-range electrostatic forces {{so they could be}} computed with different methods. In our model as a reduced particle method, the longrange electrostatic forces are evaluated by solving the Poisson equation and augmenting the forces so obtained with a short-range component. By solving the Poisson equation it is possible to self-consistently include the forces arising from the bias to the system, while <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> issue to be addressed in MD simulations.|$|E

Angelou marries a white man, whose appreciation of Black music breaks her stereotype of whites. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> decision for Angelou, and she must justify it by rationalizing that Tosh is Greek, and not an American white.

2500|$|Linguists have {{attempted}} to isolate exactly what makes gay men's language {{different from that of}} their heterosexual counterparts. [...] <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> process, because there are many variations within gay and straight male groups.

[...] It is also difficult to isolate markers of gay speech, since the gay community consists of many smaller groups that make up a diverse subculture. [...] Categorizing leather daddies, drag queens, circuit boys, gay prostitutes, activists, and “straight-acting” males as one linguistically homogenous group would obviously be an inaccurate portrayal of the gay male community.|$|E

2500|$|In cricket, chin {{music is}} a term for a bowling {{strategy}} where bouncers are aimed at the batsman's throat or chin. Rising rapidly off the pitch, the ball is difficult to play unless the batsman has quick footwork. If fended rather than avoided, it may yield a ballooned return catch to the bowler or to close-in fielders. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> ball to bowl, since a few inches on either side would present the batsman with a short ball {{that can be easily}} put away {{on either side of the}} pitch. [...] It is not illegal in cricket, but the number of short deliveries allowed in an over is usually restricted, and bowlers who exceed this may get a warning from the umpire. This tactic was made famous by the England team in the controversial 'Bodyline' Ashes series in 1932.|$|E

Execution was neither performed by the Church, nor was it a sentence available to the officials involved in the inquisition, who, as clerics, were forbidden to kill. The accused also faced the possibility that his or her property might be confiscated. In some cases, accusers may have been motivated by a desire to take the property of the accused, though <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> assertion to prove in the majority of areas where the inquisition was active, as the inquisition had several layers of oversight built into its framework in a specific attempt to limit prosecutorial misconduct.|$|E
2500|$|Researching {{the mental}} health effects of {{earthquakes}} and other disasters is important so communities can heal properly after experiencing a traumatic event. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> topic to research because fixing the physical damage from a disaster is usually the first step a city takes towards recovery. Each individual can react differently to traumatic events, and more {{research needs to be}} done to learn how to predict vulnerability and access the effects to find solutions that work best. Because it has been found that different demographics are affected differently, this also needs to be taken into account when finding solutions to aid recovery. Different demographics may benefit from different types of mental counseling to help them recover from trauma. [...] It will be important to have information on a wide variety of demographic groups because the same mental health treatment will not help all of those affected by a trauma.|$|E

2500|$|The {{problem of}} reverse {{causality}} between health and income means that any {{estimates of the}} impact of income on life expectancy could mistakenly reflect the influence of life expectancy (more generically, health) on income instead. As such, studies which do not account for this potential two-way causation may overestimate the importance of income for life expectancy. In economic research, this kind of problem has traditionally been dealt with through the use of instrumental variables which allow the researcher to separate out one effect from another. This strategy requires identification of an [...] "instrument"– i.e. a variable which correlates with per capita income but not with the error term in the linear regression. However, since any variable which is likely to correlate with income is also likely to correlate strongly with health and life expectancy <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> task. Some research suggests that in low and middle-income countries, the causality does indeed go from income to health, while the opposite is true for rich countries.|$|E
2500|$|Secret trusts are {{sometimes}} considered constructive trusts. They {{do not follow}} the Wills Act 1837; a requirement for express trusts. The argument {{is that it is}} such trusts are intended to prevent fraud by statute. Under this rule, secret trusts would be constructive trusts; the reason {{they do not have to}} follow the Wills Act is because they are created by the courts. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> argument with which to justify half-secret trusts, because since the will mentions the trust, fraud is not directly possible. A more modern argument is that secret trusts are independent and operate outside the will. The trust was created by the donor and trustee during the donor's life, and simply not constituted until his death; it does not have to follow the Wills Act, because it was not created by a will. This view was expressed by Megarry VC in Re Snowden, where he said [...] "The whole basis of secret trusts...is that they operate outside the will, changing nothing that is written in it, and allowing it to operate according to its tenor, but then fastening a trust on to the property in the hands of the recipient". This suggests that secret trusts are not constructive trusts but rather express trusts.|$|E
2500|$|Neuroscience {{has led to}} {{a deeper}} {{understanding}} of the chemical imbalances present in a disordered brain. In turn, this has resulted in the creation of new treatments and medications to treat these disorders. When these new treatments are first being tested, the experiments prompt ethical questions. First, because the treatment is affecting the brain, the side effects can be unique and sometimes severe. A special kind of side effect that many subjects have claimed to experience in neurological treatment tests is changes in [...] "personal identity". Although <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> ethical dilemma because there are no clear and undisputed definitions of personality, self, and identity, neurological treatments can result in patients losing parts of [...] "themselves" [...] such as memories or moods. Yet another ethical dispute in neurological treatment research is the choice of patients. From a perspective of justice, priority should be given to those who are most seriously impaired and who will benefit most from the intervention. However, in a test group, scientists must select patients to secure a favorable risk-benefit ratio. Setting priority becomes more difficult when a patient's chance to benefit and the seriousness of their impairment do not go together. For example, many times an older patient will be excluded despite the seriousness of their disorder simply because they are not as strong or as likely to benefit from the treatment. The main ethical issue at the heart of neurological treatment research on human subjects is promoting high-quality scientific research in the interest of future patients, while at the same time respecting and guarding the rights and interests of the research subjects. This is particularly difficult in the field of neurology because damage to the brain is often permanent and will change a patient's way of life forever.|$|E

[...] "Well we never wanted to be known as a Christian band for one [...] It was one of these things where it got out of control. With promoting records it was one of those things where the record company was like “Hey, here’s a slant. Something different. [...] Something new and unique. Let’s go for that”. I’ve always tried to stay away from labeling the band. For me it’s a band, it’s entertainment. We even get called death metal some times even though I don’t think we resemble anything death metal-ish out there, but then again I have my own opinions on what death metal is. We just don’t want it to be one of those things where someone’s like “oh I hate thrash music, so I won’t like Believer”. You get labeled and we’re going to have to go through labels but we’re not really comfortable with any." [...] says Bachman in an interview on MetalSucks.|$|E
