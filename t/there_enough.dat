5|$|Although all {{elements}} up to oganesson have been discovered, {{of the elements}} above hassium (element 108), only copernicium (element 112), nihonium (element 113), and flerovium (element 114) have known chemical properties, and only for the copernicium is <b>there</b> <b>enough</b> evidence for a conclusive categorisation at present. The other elements may behave differently from what would be predicted by extrapolation, due to relativistic effects; for example, flerovium has been predicted to possibly exhibit some noble-gas-like properties, {{even though it is}} currently placed in the carbon group. More recent experiments have suggested, however, that flerovium behaves chemically like lead, as expected from its periodic table position.|$|E
5|$|While {{some of the}} {{conditions}} to allow a currency war were in place at various points throughout this period, countries generally had contrasting priorities and at no point were <b>there</b> <b>enough</b> states simultaneously wanting to devalue for a currency war to break out. On several occasions countries were desperately attempting not to cause a devaluation but to prevent one. So states were striving not against other countries but against market forces that were exerting undesirable downwards pressure on their currencies. Examples include The United Kingdom during Black Wednesday and various tiger economies during the Asian crises of 1997. During the mid-1980s the United States did desire to devalue significantly, but were able to secure the cooperation of other major economies with the Plaza Accord. As free market influences approached their zenith during the 1990s, advanced economies and increasingly transition and even emerging economies moved {{to the view that}} it was best to leave the running of their economies to the markets and not to intervene even to correct a substantial current account deficit.|$|E

Sometimes I told him amusing stories to cheer him up, sometimes we talked about politics. One of the main threats the Nazis used against Furtwängler and myself later on was the assertion that they had recorded all these conversations. I should not have thought that it was possible! Was <b>there</b> <b>enough</b> shellac? If the Nazis really did this, their ears must certainly have burnt, and it was not surprising that Furtwängler was eventually put on their black list, let alone myself.|$|E

2500|$|Five {{days after}} the jungle primary, on November 2, 1979, Fitzmorris filed suit against Lambert. He claimed that he, not Lambert, {{deserved}} the general election position to challenge Treen. Should the court declare Lambert {{the winner of the}} second spot, Fitzmorris requested nullification of the primary results. [...] "I do not understand how in just a few days, I could have lost over 2,000 votes, while Mr. Lambert gains as many," [...] said Fitzmorris. The suit listed thousands of alleged acts of election fraud and irregularities in twenty parishes. To win the suit, Fitzmorris had to prove that <b>there</b> <b>enough</b> votes cast under questionable circumstances {{to make a difference in}} the total. Fitzmorris declared that he believed [...] "in miracles" [...] and expressed confidence that the election could be re-staged, or the results nullified.|$|E

[...] Phillips also praised the film's build-up, stating, [...] "director Gareth Edwards lays the expository groundwork nicely and hands the audience what it craves in the second half" [...] and defended the amount of screen-time Godzilla received, stating, [...] "Is <b>there</b> <b>enough</b> Godzilla in Godzilla? Folks, there is. There is just enough." [...] David Blaustein of ABC News Radio called the film [...] "very good, but not great", criticizing the film for not having enough screen-time for Godzilla, stating, [...] "There’s not enough Godzilla. When the monster’s away, the movie drags. It’s clear what Edwards and company are trying to do here. i.e. less is more. The issue is, this Godzilla is so much fun to watch, we never want it leave the screen and when he/she/it's not there, it's a letdown." [...] Regardless, Blaustein stated that the film's finale, [...] "more or less, makes it all worth the wait", and awarded the film three-and-a-half stars out of five.|$|E
