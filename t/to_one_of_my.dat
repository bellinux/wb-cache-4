500|$|Jackson stated {{several times}} that [...] "Billie Jean" [...] {{was based on the}} groupies he and his {{brothers}} encountered while part of The Jackson 5. [...] "Billie Jean is kind of anonymous. It represents a lot of girls. They used to call them groupies in the '60s." [...] He added: [...] "They would hang around backstage doors, and any band that would come to town they would have a relationship with, and I think I wrote this out of experience with my brothers when I was little. There were a lot of Billie Jeans out there. Every girl claimed that their son was related <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> brothers." [...] The reason for this was due to the fame of the Jackson 5, and wanting to have their money {{in order to have a}} way of living.|$|E
500|$|Rapper Snoop Dogg, {{who had a}} {{significant}} role on the album, was praised for his lyrics and flow, and it was mentioned that [...] "Coupled with his inventive rhymes, Snoop's distinctive style made him a superstar before he'd even released a recording of his own" [...] and that his involvement was {{as important to the}} album's success as its production. Touré of The New York Times remarks that [...] "While Snoop delivers rhymes delicately, the content is anything but. Growing up poor, often surrounded by violence, and having served six months in the Wayside County jail outside of Los Angeles (for cocaine possession) gave Snoop Dogg experiences upon which he draws." [...] Snoop Dogg later commented on the [...] "reality" [...] of his lyrics, stating [...] "My raps are incidents where either I saw it happen <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> close homies or I know about it from just being in the ghetto. I can't rap about something I don't know. You'll never hear me rapping about no bachelor's degree. It's only what I know and that's that street life. It's all everyday life, reality." ...|$|E

2500|$|To {{enhance the}} {{intensity}} between his characters, Bhansali wanted a correctly intense reference point for Hrithik and Aishwarya's feelings and conversations. Bhansali {{said that he}} thought the sentiment of thwarted passion and smothered intensity of star-crossed lovers in Romeo & Juliet expressed his protagonists' inexpressible feelings very well. Hence he included dialogues from Zeffirelli's Romeo & Juliet in Guzaarish. Bhansali insisted on Zeffirelli's version since to him [...] "..his work is the ultimate tribute to Shakespeare's love story. So many times, I've wanted to do my own version of Romeo & Juliet. But one look at Zeffirelli's film makes me feel I can never equal his beauty grandeur harmony and principal casting." [...] Though {{it was difficult to}} obtain permission to use the materials, an adamant Bhansali accomplished the feat.

Twenty years from now, if I give this [...] <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> kids, I'll be like, 'This was me then, at that moment.'"
