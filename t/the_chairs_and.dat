5|$|Holmes was keenly {{involved}} with {{the details of the}} Agricultural College, influencing everything from the purchase of land for the campus, layout of the buildings, and even the placement of <b>the</b> <b>chairs</b> <b>and</b> tables. Once the College opened, he assumed the role of treasurer and later Professor of Horticulture. By 1861, Holmes had fallen out of favor with the other College administrators, and retired to his home in Detroit. Nevertheless, he continued to support and visit the college until his death in 1887.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet {{occupation}} in 1940 {{led to the}} closing of the church. During World War II, services were continued, but in the spring of 1944 hooligans broke into the church and destroyed the altar with the altarpiece, the organ, <b>the</b> <b>chairs</b> <b>and</b> the windows. In 1946, the congregation asked the Soviet government to list the Cathedral as a protected historical monument, but it failed to raise their interest. The church was empty for years; for some time it was used for storing grain, even plans for turning it into a swimming-pool were made.|$|E

25|$|Ruppersberger was {{the first}} Democratic {{freshman}} ever to be appointed to the House Intelligence Committee. He was named to this committee because his district {{is home to the}} National Security Agency. From January 3, 2011 to January 3, 2015, he served as this committee's ranking Democrat. The position placed Ruppersberger on the elite “Gang of Eight”, which refers to <b>the</b> <b>chairs</b> <b>and</b> ranking members of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees along with the Senate majority leader, Senate minority leader, House speaker and House minority leader. By law, the president must keep the Gang of Eight informed of the country's most secret intelligence activities to maintain proper oversight.|$|E
25|$|As {{mandated}} by Title 50 of the United States Code Chapter 15, Subchapter III, {{when it becomes}} necessary to limit access to covert operations findings that could affect vital interests of the U.S., {{as soon as possible}} the President must report at a minimum to the Gang of Eight (the leaders of each of the two parties from both the Senate and House of Representatives, and <b>the</b> <b>chairs</b> <b>and</b> ranking members of both the Senate Committee and House Committee for intelligence). The House is expected to support the 2010 Intelligence Authorization Bill including a provision that would require the President to inform more than 40 members of Congress about covert operations. The Obama administration threatened to veto the final version of a bill that included such a provision. On July 16, 2008, the fiscal 2009 Intelligence Authorization Bill was approved by House majority containing stipulations that 75% of money sought for covert actions would be held until all members of the House Intelligence panel were briefed on sensitive covert actions. Under the George W. Bush administration, senior advisers to the President issued a statement indicating that if a bill containing this provision reached the President, they would recommend that he veto the bill.|$|E
2500|$|A chair {{cover is}} a {{temporary}} fabric cover for a side chair.

2500|$|Other {{artefacts}} {{depicting the}} story include {{the chest of}} Cypselus described in the travelogue by Pausanias. Among its many carvings [...] "there is a grotto and in it a woman sleeping with a man upon a couch. I was of opinion that they were Odysseus and Circe, basing my view upon {{the number of the}} handmaidens in front of the grotto and upon what they are doing. For the women are four, and they are engaged on the tasks which Homer mentions in his poetry. The passage in question describes how one of them [...] "threw linen covers over <b>the</b> <b>chairs</b> <b>and</b> spread fine purple fabrics on top. Another drew silver tables up to <b>the</b> <b>chairs,</b> <b>and</b> laid out golden dishes, while a third mixed sweet honeyed wine in a silver bowl, and served it in golden cups. The fourth fetched water and lit a roaring fire beneath a huge cauldron." [...] This suggests a work of considerable detail, while the Etruscan [...] coffin preserved in Orvieto's archaeological museum has only four figures. At the centre Osysseus threatens Circe with drawn sword while an animal headed figure stands on either side, one of them laying his hand familiarly on the hero's shoulder. A bronze mirror relief in the Fitzwilliam Museum is also Etruscan and is inscribed with the names of the characters. There a pig is depicted at Circe's feet, while Odysseus and Elpenor approach her, swords drawn.|$|E
2500|$|Towards the stern, {{the boiler}} deck then transitioned {{into the dining}} room, onto which opened 22 “large and commodious” staterooms, all of uniform size, with each stateroom {{including}} a three-quarters bedstead for two persons, with a single berth above. [...] These accommodations, {{as well as those}} in the ladies’ saloon, were said to “contrast favorably with the cramped up little dens called state-rooms on the eastern steamboats.”. [...] The dining room was painted in pale lemon, with gold beads on the door panels. [...] The floor in the dining room was covered with a Brussels-style carpet, apparently locally made. [...] <b>The</b> <b>chairs</b> <b>and</b> tables were made locally as well, of Oregon ash with burl maple veneer.|$|E

Kumar aims to capture the cozy feel and stylish look of New York City-style theatre bars. Thus, the [...] club has no dance floor and all <b>the</b> <b>chairs</b> <b>and</b> tables face the stage.

2500|$|In 1883, Luther Standing Bear {{was sent}} to Philadelphia to work as an intern for John Wanamaker. Wanamaker's was the first {{department}} store in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, {{and one of the}} first department stores in the United States. Luther was told by Pratt: [...] "My boy you are going away from us to work for this school. Go and do your best. The majority of white people think the Indian is a lazy good-for-nothing. They think he can neither work nor learn anything; that he is very dirty. Now you are going to prove that the red man can learn and work as well as the white man.

[...] While riding on street cars in Philadelphia, Luther did not care to listen to the vulgar language used by white boys on the way to work. At the end of his internship, the entire Carlisle school students and faculty traveled to a large meeting hall in Philadelphia where Pratt and Wanamaker spoke. Luther was asked to come to the stage, and Wanamaker told the students that Luther had been promoted from one department to another every month getting better work and better money and in spite of the fact that he employed over one thousand people, he never promoted anyone as rapidly as Luther.|$|E
