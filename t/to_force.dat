Simultaneously, Stosch began a campaign <b>to</b> <b>force</b> Werner out of the navy. This was in part to ensure that Batsch, his protégé, would be next in line after Stosch retired.

On 15 October 1878, he requested retirement.|$|E

5|$|According to Herodotus, {{both sides}} wished for a decisive battle that would tip {{the war in}} their favor. However, Lazenby {{believed}} that Mardonius' actions during the Plataea campaign were not consistent with an aggressive policy. He interprets the Persian operations during the prelude not as attempts <b>to</b> <b>force</b> the Allies into battle but as attempts <b>to</b> <b>force</b> the Allies into retreat (which indeed became the case). Mardonius may have felt he had little to gain in battle {{and that he could}} simply wait for the Greek alliance to fall apart (as it had nearly done over the winter). There can be little doubt from Herodotus' account that Mardonius was prepared to accept battle on his own terms, however. Regardless of the exact motives, the initial strategic situation allowed both sides to procrastinate, since food supplies were ample for both armies. Under these conditions, the tactical considerations outweighed the strategic need for action.|$|E
