Soon after, Lenin's associates burned all the 500-ruble notes remaining in their possession.|$|E
5|$|Film {{historian}} Howard Hughes suggests <b>that,</b> <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> {{implications of}} a large budget {{as a result of}} an international cast, as well as elaborate set and costume designs, there are several aspects that suggest otherwise.

5|$|Howe was {{determined}} to support technologically advanced industries, and saw no reason why Canada should not continue to produce aircraft after the war.

Nevertheless, Howe took steps to keep aircraft manufacturers in business, allowing the British Hawker Siddeley Group to take over Victory Aircraft as A.V.

5|$|In 1969, Austrian {{paleontologist}} Georg Haas concluded <b>that</b> <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> {{large size}} of ankylosaur skulls, the associated musculature was relatively weak. He also thought jaw movement {{was limited to}} up and down movements. Extrapolating from this, Haas suggested that ankylosaurs ate relatively soft non-abrasive vegetation. Later research on Euoplocephalus indicates that forward and sideways jaw movement was possible in these animals, the skull being able to withstand considerable forces. A 2016 study of the dental occlusion (contact between the teeth) of ankylosaur specimens found that the ability for backwards (palinal) jaw movement evolved independently in different ankylosaur linages, including Late Cretaceous North American ankylosaurids like Ankylosaurus and Euoplocephalus.|$|E

The following month, secondary filming took place about an hour outside Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in the Butler area.

5|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} as new to science by mycologist William Alphonso Murrill in 1912.

Morgan); this opinion was later corroborated by Walter Sundberg in 1989 after he studied the type collection and concluded that the microscopic characteristics of both were the same. Using molecular analysis based on comparing DNA sequences of the internal transcribed spacer region, mycologist Else Vellinga determined <b>that</b> <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> lack of distinguishing micro-morphological characteristics, the two species were distinct.|$|E
