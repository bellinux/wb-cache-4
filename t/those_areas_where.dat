5|$|Albinism was {{observed}} in jungle cats (Felis chaus) and jackals (Canis aureus) along the coastline of the southern Western Ghats (Kerala and Kanyakumari coast, India). Albinism {{was observed}} in jungle cats from the Amaravila area of Trivandrum district in the Kerala State. Albinism in jackals was observed from the Polooni area in Malappuram district and Chaliyam area of Calicut district (Kerala).As albinism is observed in <b>those</b> <b>areas</b> <b>where</b> the density of these mammals is comparatively low, it is concluded that continuous inbreeding could be the reason for expression of albinism.|$|E
5|$|Golden jackals are {{abundant}} in valleys and beside rivers and their tributaries, canals, lakes, and seashores. They are rare in foothills and low mountains, and they avoid waterless deserts and snow areas. The golden jackal {{is a social}} species, the basic social unit of which consists of a breeding pair and any young offspring. It is very adaptable, {{with the ability to}} exploit food ranging from fruit and insects to small ungulates. They will attack domestic fowl and domestic mammals up to the size of domestic water buffalo calves. The jackal's competitors are the red fox, wolf, jungle cat, forest wildcat, and the raccoon in the Caucasus, and the steppe wildcat in Central Asia. In Europe, jackals will not occupy the same areas as wolves, with the jackal's expansion being attributed to their occupying <b>those</b> <b>areas</b> <b>where</b> wolves are few or non-existent.|$|E

Froissart notes the creation of Chandos le Roy d'Ireland, but does not give any clues as to the reasoning. It does, however, fit into the general English policy in Ireland at the time. Richard II sought to re-establish English control in <b>those</b> <b>areas</b> <b>where</b> the native Irish had reasserted their independence. The appointment {{can be seen as a}} necessary part of the preparations for the appointment of the Duke of Gloucester as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in 1392.

In 1916 the originaires (those Africans born in the theoretically free cities of Saint-Louis, Dakar, Gorée, and Rufisque) were granted full voting rights while maintaining legal protections offered by local customary law.

25|$|By {{the mid-1960s}} Japan had become China's leading trading partner, {{accounting}} for 15 percent of trade in 1966.

The Japanese economy was highly advanced in <b>those</b> <b>areas</b> <b>where</b> China was weakest, especially heavy industry and modern technology, while China was well endowed {{with some of the}} important natural resources that Japan lacked, notably coal and oil. In the 1980s Japan accounted for over 20 percent of China's foreign trade and in 1986 provided 28.9 percent of China's imports and 15.2 percent of its exports.

25|$|The {{suppression}} of the order had longstanding economic effects in the Americas, particularly <b>those</b> <b>areas</b> <b>where</b> they had their missions or reductions – outlying areas dominated by indigenous peoples such as Paraguay and Chiloé Archipelago. In Central Chile the {{suppression of}} the Order led among other things to a sharp decrease in the import of black slaves from Peru, which although small in comparison to neighboring colonies had led the Order to own the largest number of black slaves in Chile, 1300 approximately. In Misiones, in modern-day Argentina, their suppression led to the scattering and enslavement of indigenous Guaranís living in the reductions and a long-term decline in the yerba mate industry from which it only recovered in the 20th century.|$|E
25|$|The Jews {{would only}} be {{admitted}} back into France for twelve years, after which the agreement might be terminated; Jews were to wear an armband at all times; Jews could only live in <b>those</b> <b>areas</b> <b>where</b> there had been Jewish communities previously; Jews were initially to be forbidden from usury. This {{was the first time}} that French Jews had been covered by such a charter, and Louis was careful to justify his decision with reference to the policies of his ancestor Saint Louis IX, the position of Pope Clement V and an argument that the people of France had demanded a return of the Jews. The result was a much weakened Jewish community that depended directly upon the King for their right of abode and protection.|$|E
25|$|The size of {{the range}} was {{determined}} by law, which specified that the range could cover only <b>those</b> <b>areas</b> <b>where</b> feral horses existed in 1971 (but not necessarily historically). A boundary fence had been constructed between BLM and Forest Service land in the 1940s, which significantly affected feral horse distribution in the Pryor Mountains and restricted the horses to rangeland south, east, and west of the Custer National Forest. By 1968, when the refuge was created, fences completely surrounded what became the refuge, limiting the horses' spread. Both BLM and the Forest Service interpreted the Wild and Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act of 1971 as requiring protection of feral horses only on those lands where the horses existed as of 1971, not lands which they had historically used.|$|E

25|$|The Danish government, for {{political}} reasons, wished to halt this language shift from Danish to German. After the First War of Schleswig, in 1851, the government issued language rescripts ordering {{that the school}} language should be Danish in <b>those</b> <b>areas</b> <b>where</b> the peasantry spoke Danish and even in an area stretching further south, into the Low German speaking area. Church language would alternate between Danish and German. Standard Danish had never been widely used in South Slesvig even where the populace spoke a Danish dialect. The dominant official language was German, and the measures of the government had quite the adverse effect, reinforcing anti-Danish sentiment. A pattern emerged, the poorest in rural areas sticking to South Jutlandic, the wealthier peasants speaking Low German as the lingua franca, and educated townsmen speaking High German.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the Vietnam War, the Vietnamese railway network—especially the North–South Railway—was {{a target}} of bombardments and {{sabotage}} by both North Vietnamese and South Vietnamese forces. In the South, American aid allowed the South Vietnamese government to reconstruct the main line between Saigon and Huế, and several branch lines were also completed. As reconstruction efforts advanced, however, bombardments and sabotage of the railways by the Viet Cong and the North Vietnamese intensified, reducing the transportation capacity and effectiveness of the railway, and eventually forcing the abandonment of many large sections of the track. In 1964, Typhoons Joan and Iris, the worst to strike Vietnam in sixty-five years, damaged the railway system even further, restricting operations to five separated segments. A second reconstruction effort, assisted again by the U.S. government, began in December 1966, and progressed in <b>those</b> <b>areas</b> <b>where</b> security was re-established. The system reopened 340 kilometers of main line in areas where security was restored.|$|E
25|$|Overall, Jean-Jacques Furer {{concludes that}} the {{shrinkage}} of the Romansh-speaking areas is continuing, though at different rates depending on the region. At the same time, he notes that Romansh {{is still very much}} alive, a fact that is obvious in <b>those</b> <b>areas</b> <b>where</b> it retains a strong presence, such as most parts of the Surselva and the Lower Engadine. It is also assured that Romansh will continue to be transmitted for several more generations, even though each succeeding generation will be more and more rooted in German as well as Romansh. As a result, if the overall linguistic situation does not change, speakers will slowly become fewer and fewer with each generation. He also concludes however, that there are still enough speakers to ensure that Romansh will survive in the long term at least in certain regions. He considers the Romansh-language school system to be the single most crucial factor in this.|$|E
