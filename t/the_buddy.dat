A skunk's spray enables Sniffer to smell again, so he calls Noah and Henry and they go off to find <b>the</b> <b>Buddies.</b> Buddy and Molly manage to escape to find <b>the</b> <b>Buddies.</b> Budderball falls into a hole, which Buddy and Molly dug, forcing <b>the</b> <b>Buddies</b> to help. Noah and Henry are led by Sniffer through the same farm that <b>the</b> <b>Buddies</b> went through. Noah and Henry are ecstatic and overjoyed at finding Grim and Denning being held prisoners by Billy the goat, and {{immediately}} depart to report them and turn them in to the authorities over Grim and Denning's protests. Bartleby and his father come to collect the dogs but instead finds <b>the</b> <b>Buddies.</b> Bartleby and his father then put <b>the</b> <b>Buddies</b> in a limousine, when Noah, Henry, Buddy and Molly come to rescue <b>the</b> <b>Buddies.</b> Budderball falls {{into one of the}} wine containers and gets drunk.

50|$|With {{help from}} an elf named Eli (Danny Woodburn), Christmas spirit returns, the Christmas Icicle stops melting, and the North Pole {{is back in}} business.

A changed Mr. Cruge brings Tiny over to the child who has been asking for a puppy as a Christmas present. Tiny says her goodbyes to <b>the</b> <b>Buddies</b> and Puppy Paws.

5|$|However, some {{researchers}} have hypothesized that the reason the proportion of fatalities is low is not because sharks do not like human flesh, but because humans are often able to escape after the first bite. In the 1980s, John McCosker, Chair of Aquatic Biology at the California Academy of Sciences, noted that divers who dove solo and were bitten by great whites were generally at least partially consumed, while divers who followed <b>the</b> <b>buddy</b> system were generally rescued by their companion. McCosker and Timothy C. Tricas, an author and professor at the University of Hawaii, suggest that a standard pattern for great whites is to make an initial devastating attack and then wait for the prey to weaken before consuming the wounded animal. Humans' ability {{to move out of}} reach with the help of others, thus foiling the attack, is unusual for a great white's prey.|$|E
5|$|In 1974, Eastwood {{teamed up}} with Jeff Bridges and George Kennedy in <b>the</b> <b>buddy</b> action caper Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, a road movie about a veteran bank robber Thunderbolt (Eastwood) and a young con man drifter, Lightfoot (Bridges). On its release, in spring 1974, the film was praised for its offbeat comedy mixed with high {{suspense}} and tragedy but was only a modest success at the box office, earning $32.4million. Eastwood's acting was noted by critics, but was overshadowed by Bridges who was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Eastwood reportedly fumed {{at the lack of}} Academy Award recognition for him and swore that he would never work for United Artists again.|$|E
5|$|On May 18, 1979, the Hamilton Tiger-Cats traded Allemang and a {{draft pick}} to the Winnipeg Blue Bombers for linebacker Harry Walters and {{defensive}} end Jim Heighton. The retirement of <b>the</b> <b>Buddy</b> Brown left the Blue Bombers {{looking for an}} offensive guard, and they transitioned Allemang into this role {{on the right side}} of the offensive line. Allemang played in all 16 regular season games during the 1979 season, primarily on the offense. He returned to the defensive line in 1980 and alternated between the offense and defense for the remainder of his time with the Blue Bombers. In 1981, Allemang saw a reduced role, playing in only four games. After playing 36 total regular season games with the Blue Bombers, Allemang was cut in October 1981.|$|E

25|$|In {{recreational}} diving, {{a pair of}} divers {{is usually}} the best combination in buddy diving; with threesomes, one of the divers can easily lose {{the attention of the}} other two.

The system is likely to be effective in mitigating out-of-air emergencies, non-diving medical emergencies and entrapment in ropes or nets. When used with <b>the</b> <b>buddy</b> check it can help avoid the omission, misuse and failure of diving equipment.|$|E

Bennett and Slaughter first teamed up in a post-World War II trio that attempted, {{but failed to}} negotiate a recording contract while in New York City.

When Claiborne started arranging bookings for <b>the</b> <b>Buddies,</b> <b>the</b> group promoted itself as the Cap-Tans.

25|$|Scuba diving {{is done in}} {{a hostile}} {{environment}} for which humans are not adapted, breathing from a portable and limited capacity life support system.

Few, if any, of these problems are defects in the concept of <b>the</b> <b>buddy</b> system, they are problems with the application of the system.|$|E

25|$|The {{official}} terminology {{of recreational}} diving defines {{only the two}} extremes: Buddy/team diving, and solo diving.
