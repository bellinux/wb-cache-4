5|$|Pain {{produced}} by cancer within the pelvis {{varies depending on}} the affected tissue. It may appear {{at the site of}} the cancer but it frequently radiates diffusely to the upper thigh, and may refer to <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>back,</b> the external genitalia or perineum.|$|E
5|$|Women {{may have}} acute {{low back pain}} from medical {{conditions}} affecting the female reproductive system, including endometriosis, ovarian cysts, ovarian cancer, or uterine fibroids. Nearly half of all pregnant women report pain in <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>back</b> or sacral area during pregnancy, due to changes in their posture and center of gravity causing muscle and ligament strain.|$|E

5|$|The {{subspecies}} avicenniae {{differs from}} the nominate by its smaller size. It also varies as its nape to back is a dull grey colour. The brown spot present {{at the back of}} the head of the nominate is also reduced or gone. <b>The</b> <b>lower</b> <b>back</b> is toned a slight olive, and the underparts are also slightly paler than the nominate, but without white feathers. Avicenniaes upper wing-coverts are also more greenish-grey. The similar but smaller rufous-necked wood rail can be differentiated from the grey-necked wood rail by the former's reddish head and neck with a grey upper back.|$|E
5|$|Following the Davis Cup, Murray's {{season was}} cut short by his {{decision}} to undergo surgery, in order to sort out <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>back</b> problems that had caused him problems since {{the early stages of}} the previous season. After being forced to withdraw from the French Open in May, the injury flared up again during the US Open and later during the Davis Cup World Group Play-offs, Murray made the decision that surgery was the best way to sort the problem out for the long-term. Following the conclusion of the 2013 season, Murray was voted the 2013 BBC Sport Personality of the Year, after having been heavy favourite since the nominees were announced.|$|E
5|$|For {{those with}} pain {{localized}} to <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>back</b> due to disc degeneration, fair evidence supports spinal fusion as equal to intensive physical therapy and {{slightly better than}} low-intensity nonsurgical measures. Fusion may be considered for those with low back pain from acquired displaced vertebra that does not improve with conservative treatment, although {{only a few of}} those who have spinal fusion experience good results. There are a number of different surgical procedures to achieve fusion, with no clear evidence of one being better than the others. Adding spinal implant devices during fusion increases the risks but provides no added improvement in pain or function.|$|E

5|$|Low {{back pain}} may be {{classified}} {{based on the}} signs and symptoms. Diffuse pain that does not change in response to particular movements, and is localized to <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>back</b> without radiating beyond the buttocks, is classified as nonspecific, the most common classification. Pain that radiates down the leg below the knee, is located on one side (in the case of disc herniation), or is on both sides (in spinal stenosis), and changes in severity in response to certain positions or maneuvers is radicular, making up 7% of cases. Pain that is accompanied by red flags such as trauma, fever, a history of cancer or significant muscle weakness may indicate a more serious underlying problem and is classified as needing urgent or specialized attention.|$|E
5|$|The pale {{crag martin}} of the {{nominate}} subspecies P. o. obsoleta is 12–13cm (4.7–5.1in) long with light brown upperparts, becoming paler on <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>back,</b> {{and a short}} square tail that has small white patches near the tips of all but the central and outermost pairs of feathers. It has a pale grey throat, upper breast and underwing coverts, {{and the rest of}} the underparts are a dirty white. The eyes are brown, the small bill is mainly black, and the legs are brownish-pink. The wing length averages 1.3cm (4.55in) and the tail averages 4.8cm (1.9in). The sexes are similar in appearance, but juveniles have pale edges to the upperparts and flight feathers. The other subspecies differ from the nominate form as detailed in the table above.|$|E
5|$|The plumage of {{the house}} sparrow is mostly {{different}} shades of grey and brown. The sexes exhibit strong dimorphism: the female is mostly buffish above and below, while the male has boldly coloured head markings, a reddish back, and grey underparts. The male has a dark grey crown {{from the top of}} its bill to its back, and chestnut brown flanking its crown on the sides of its head. It has black around its bill, on its throat, and on the spaces between its bill and eyes (lores). It has a small white stripe between the lores and crown and small white spots immediately behind the eyes (postoculars), with black patches below and above them. The underparts are pale grey or white, as are the cheeks, ear coverts, and stripes {{at the base of the}} head. The upper back and mantle are a warm brown, with broad black streaks, while <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>back,</b> rump and uppertail coverts are greyish brown.|$|E

5|$|The winter fur is dense, soft, silky and {{relatively}} long. For the northern foxes, the fur is very long, dense and fluffy, but is shorter, sparser and coarser in southern forms. Among northern foxes, the North American varieties generally have the silkiest guard hairs, while most Eurasian red foxes have coarser fur. There are three main colour morphs; red, silver/black and cross (see Mutations). In the typical red morph, their coats are generally bright reddish-rusty with yellowish tints. A stripe of weak, diffuse patterns of many brown-reddish-chestnut hairs occurs along the spine. Two additional stripes pass down the shoulder blades, which, {{together with the}} spinal stripe, form a cross. <b>The</b> <b>lower</b> <b>back</b> is often a mottled silvery colour. The flanks are lighter coloured than the back, while the chin, lower lips, throat and front of the chest are white. The remaining lower {{surface of the body}} is dark, brown or reddish. During lactation, the belly fur of vixens may turn brick red. The upper parts of the limbs are rusty reddish, while the paws are black. The frontal part of the face and upper neck is bright brownish-rusty red, while the upper lips are white. The backs of the ears are black or brownish-reddish, while the inner surface is whitish. The top of the tail is brownish-reddish, but lighter in colour than the back and flanks. The underside of the tail is pale grey with a straw-coloured tint. A black spot, the location of the supracaudal gland, is usually present {{at the base of the}} tail. The tip of the tail is white.|$|E

25|$|For example, {{when doing}} a sit-up {{that brings the}} torso (including <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>back)</b> away {{from the ground and}} towards the front of the leg, the hip flexors (including the iliopsoas) will flex the spine upon the pelvis.|$|E
25|$|Lumbar disc herniations {{occur in}} <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>back,</b> most often between {{the fourth and}} fifth lumbar {{vertebral}} bodies or between the fifth and the sacrum. Symptoms can affect <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>back,</b> buttocks, thigh, anal/genital region (via the perineal nerve), and may radiate into the foot and/or toe. The sciatic nerve is the most commonly affected nerve, causing symptoms of sciatica. The femoral nerve can also be affected and cause the patient to experience a numb, tingling feeling throughout one or both legs and even feet or even a burning feeling in the hips and legs. A hernia in the lumbar region often compresses the nerve root exiting at the level below the disk. Thus, a herniation of the L4/5 disc will compress the L5 nerve root.|$|E
