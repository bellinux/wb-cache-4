5|$|After the Angolan War of Independence of 1975, the Soviet Union's role in <b>Third</b> <b>World</b> {{politics}} increased dramatically. Some of {{the regions}} were important for national security, while other regions {{were important to}} the expansion of Soviet socialism to other countries. According to an anonymous Soviet writer, the national liberation struggle was the cornerstone of Soviet ideology, and therefore became a cornerstone for Soviet diplomatic activity in the <b>Third</b> <b>World.</b>|$|E

5|$|Many {{emerging}} {{nations of}} Asia, Africa, and Latin America rejected {{the pressure to}} choose sides in the East-West competition. In 1955, at the Bandung Conference in Indonesia, dozens of <b>Third</b> <b>World</b> governments resolved {{to stay out of}} the Cold War. The consensus reached at Bandung culminated with the creation of the Belgrade-headquartered Non-Aligned Movement in 1961. Meanwhile, Khrushchev broadened Moscow's policy to establish ties with India and other key neutral states. Independence movements in the <b>Third</b> <b>World</b> transformed the post-war order into a more pluralistic world of decolonized African and Middle Eastern nations and of rising nationalism in Asia and Latin America.|$|E

5|$|Until {{the recent}} past, little {{attention}} {{was paid to}} the interests of <b>Third</b> <b>World</b> countries. This is because most international relations scholars have come from the industrialized, First World nations. As more countries have continued to become more developed, the interests of the world have slowly started to shift. However, First World nations still have many more universities, professors, journals, and conferences, which has made it very difficult for <b>Third</b> <b>World</b> countries to gain legitimacy and respect with their new ideas and methods of looking at the world.|$|E
5|$|With {{the fall}} of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Eastern Bloc ceased to exist; with it, so did all {{applicability}} of the term Second World. The definitions of the First World and <b>Third</b> <b>World</b> changed slightly, yet generally described the same concepts.|$|E
5000|$|Telstar Records {{released}} a double-album compilation in 1983 which collected {{up all the}} mainstream club extended versions and remixes by artists and groups that had enjoyed relatively good UK chart success between 1981 and 1983. Entitled 'In The Groove', the compilation's lead track on Part Two was <b>Third</b> <b>World's</b> extended version of 'Dancing on the Floor (Hooked on Love)'. The track had originally been released in 1981 in 7" [...] edited and 12" [...] extended versions, and included on <b>Third</b> <b>World's</b> impressive 'Rock The World' album. With {{the release of the}} Telstar compilation, this brought about an upsurge of interest in <b>Third</b> <b>World's</b> dancefloor output and certainly {{paved the way for the}} next two years recordings with Columbia Records (CBS).|$|R

5|$|With {{the spread}} of {{decolonization}} in the 1960s, the organization's membership saw an influx of newly independent nations. In 1960 alone, 17 new states joined the UN, 16 of them from Africa. On 25 October 1971, with opposition from the United States, but {{with the support of}} many <b>Third</b> <b>World</b> nations, the mainland, communist People's Republic of China was given the Chinese seat on the Security Council in place of the Republic of China that occupied Taiwan; the vote was widely seen as a sign of waning US influence in the organization. <b>Third</b> <b>World</b> nations organized into the Group of 77 coalition under the leadership of Algeria, which briefly became a dominant power at the UN. In 1975, a bloc comprising the USSR and <b>Third</b> <b>World</b> nations passed a resolution, over strenuous US and Israeli opposition, declaring Zionism to be racism; the resolution was repealed in 1991, shortly {{after the end of the}} Cold War.|$|E

5|$|In February 1972, Nixon {{announced}} a stunning rapprochement with Mao's China by traveling to Beijing and meeting with Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai. At this time, the USSR achieved rough nuclear parity with the United States; meanwhile, the Vietnam War both weakened America's {{influence in the}} <b>Third</b> <b>World</b> and cooled relations with Western Europe. Although indirect conflict between Cold War powers continued through the late 1960s and early 1970s, tensions were beginning to ease.|$|E

5|$|Prince Sadruddin's {{determination}} not {{to discriminate}} between European and <b>Third</b> <b>World</b> refugees helped prepare the UNHCR {{for a change in}} the landscape of internationally displaced persons. During the 1950s, between 200,000 and 300,000 refugees of European origin required assistance. By the 1970s the European refugee problems were mostly solved, but had been replaced by millions of displaced persons in the <b>Third</b> <b>World.</b> He had widened the UNHCR mandate well beyond its original focus on Eastern Europe, extending the organisation's reach to refugees from the Palestinian territory, Vietnam, Angola and Algeria. As the scale and complexity of refugee issues continued to increase, the UNHCR and the international community at large was better positioned to adapt. By the end of 1977 when he chose to step down from the position, he had become the longest-serving UN High Commissioner for Refugees. He continued to serve in various capacities dealing with humanitarian situations on behalf of the UN.|$|E
