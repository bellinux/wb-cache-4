5|$|Montgomery's {{plan was}} for the 1st Canadian Division to attack across the Moro in the coastal {{lowlands}} to take Ortona first and then Pescara. Inland, in <b>the</b> <b>jagged</b> hills above {{the headwaters of the}} Moro, the relatively fresh 2nd New Zealand Division would attack toward Orsogna, while between these two the 8th Indian Infantry Division would hold the centre of the front in a relatively static role.|$|E
5|$|The {{skull of}} Knoetschesuchus is {{relatively}} short, with the snout taking up 47% of skull length in K. langenbergensis and 42% in K. guimarotae, which {{allows them to}} be classified as brevirostrine crocodilians. Along {{the side of the}} snout are two undulations, a smaller one on the premaxilla and a larger and broader one on the maxilla. <b>The</b> <b>jagged</b> suture between the premaxilla and maxilla is angled towards the front of the skull in K. langenbergensis and towards the back in K. guimarotae. Along the midline of the snout are the thin and wedge-like nasals; the nostrils, which face upwards, are clearly separated by the nasals in K. guimarotae, {{but it is not clear}} that this is the case in K. langenbergensis.|$|E

25|$|At {{the end of}} 1862, Henry J. Hunt {{attempted}} to get the Parrott eliminated from the Army of the Potomac's inventory, preferring the 3-inch ordnance rifle. During battles when the Parrott gun would burst, artillerists would chip out <b>the</b> <b>jagged</b> parts and continue firing. In 1889, The New York Times called on the Ordnance Bureau of the War Department to discontinue use of the Parrott gun altogether, following a series of mishaps at the West Point training grounds.|$|E
25|$|On 29 September, the ketch Annie Watt {{arrived in}} Adelaide and her captain {{reported}} {{picking up a}} reel of blue printing paper 18 miles North-West of Kangaroo Island. The paper was identified as part of Loch Vennachar's cargo. Three weeks later, the sea began delivering scraps of her cargo to <b>the</b> <b>jagged</b> coast of Kangaroo Island which confirmed the disaster. The steamer Governor Musgrave was sent on two separate occasions {{to search for the}} wreck and any survivors. Weeks of searching by government and local fishing boats produced only flotsam and the body of a young seaman, who was never identified. He was buried in the sand hills of West Bay. The search was eventually abandoned on 12 October.|$|E
25|$|Scotland {{contains}} the most mountainous terrain in Great Britain. Much {{of the highest}} uplands lie {{to the north and}} west of the Highland Boundary Fault in the Northwest Highlands and Grampian ranges. <b>The</b> <b>jagged</b> Cuillin, on the Isle of Skye, represents a major mountain range that is not located on the Scottish mainland. Located at the western end of the Grampian Mountains, at an altitude of , Ben Nevis is the highest mountain in Scotland and Great Britain. Ben Macdui and Braeriach are, respectively, the second and third tallest peaks in Scotland. Both are located in the Cairngorms, a mountain range in the eastern Highlands which is the highest upland area in Britain.|$|E

25|$|The Animikie Group is a {{geologic}} group {{composed of}} sedimentary and metasedimentary rock, having been originally deposited between 2,500 and 1,800 {{million years ago}} within the Animikie Basin. This group of formations is geographically divided into the Gunflint Range, the Mesabi and Vermilion ranges, and the Cuyuna Range. On the map, the Animikie Group is the dark gray northeast-trending belt which ranges from south-central Minnesota, U.S., up to Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada. The Gunflint Iron Range is the linear black formation labeled G, the Mesabi Iron Range is <b>the</b> <b>jagged</b> black linear formation labeled F, and Cuyuna Iron Range is the two black spots labeled E. The gabbro of the Duluth Complex, intruded during {{the formation of the}} Midcontinent Rift, separates the Mesabi and Gunflint iron ranges; it is shown by the speckled area wrapping around the western end of Lake Superior.|$|E
25|$|The Launceston flag {{design is}} based on the city's Coat of Arms granted by the College of Arms, London on 11 June 1957. The Brisbane Street Mall, the War {{memorial}} at Royal Park, atop the Council Chambers and on top of the Albert Hall are places in the city where the flag is regularly flown. Flying the flag is restricted to Council Property. The three intersecting lines in the flag represent the city's three rivers (North Esk, South Esk and Tamar) and the two rectangles in the lines represent tin ingots. The strip across the top with <b>the</b> <b>jagged</b> edge is green to represent the city's parks, gardens and surrounding countryside. Waratah flowers at the top symbolise all flowers and similar beauties of nature. The ingots are included because Launceston used to be a large tin smelting centre. The little circle at the river junction is Launceston.|$|E
25|$|Once on His {{visit to}} the Panchavati Hills near Shirali, the weather became very cyclonic. He noticed 2 {{fishermen}} trying to battle the cyclonic conditions in the Arabian Sea but they failed after their boat capsized and they drowned. This incident deeply hurt Swamiji as He was helpless and could not help the fishermen. Thus came the idea of starting a wireless station at Pachavati {{that could be used}} for communication in times of emergency. A Wireless transmitter-receiver station was established with the help of people like Badakere Dutt, Kallianpur Ramanand etc. An Observatory post was also established which was manned all throughout the day and night, to guide ships and boats through <b>the</b> <b>jagged</b> rocks that adorn the coastline of Shirali, especially at night. Swamiji also studied and obtained a first grade amateur radio license within a period of 3 months of applying for it, a task that is difficult by normal standards. He was probably the first sanyasi to obtain such a license. He was also an active user of the amateur radio.|$|E

5000|$|Unlike {{those made}} by Ebert and Berardinelli, the {{comparisons}} made by the Boston Phoenix are more precise: the film [...] "combines British social realism with <b>the</b> bitter, <b>jagged</b> humor of Balkan directors like Emir Kusturica (Underground) and Srdjan Dragojevic (Pretty Village, Pretty Flame)." ...|$|R
25|$|With {{his arms}} crossed {{and his head}} {{slightly}} lowered as he skates from right to left, Grant dominates the canvas. The dramatic impression is enhanced by a low point of view, much in the fashion of Baroque portraiture in the Grand Manner. But for his folded arms, Grant's pose derives from the Apollo Belvedere, a cast of which was present in West's studio. The black tones of a full-skirted coat, elegant smallclothes and shoes are relieved by a white cravat and cuff, a gray fur lapel, a glimpse of tan glove, and silver buckles on the hat, breeches, and shoes; the stylishly tilted hat belonged to the artist. Behind Grant is a winter landscape of restrained tones composed of distant skaters, trees, and a far-off London skyline that includes Westminster Abbey. Grant's figure divides the canvas into contrasting halves: to the right the coat's silhouette undulates gently, and a large bare tree anchors the composition, while the left side, opening onto the gestures of skaters in motion, is activated by {{the shape of his}} protruding elbow and <b>the</b> <b>jagged</b> contour of coat. Beyond the large tree the recession of the distant treeline creates a movement from right to left which is echoed by the disposition of the secondary figures. The overall handling evidences a lightness of touch and a success in integrating figure and landscape that suggests the open-air portraits of Thomas Gainsborough.|$|E

500|$|However, when Homer goes to hug Bart to {{complete}} their reconciliation, the board rolls down a hill and flies over the gorge, with Homer on board. Although it briefly appears as though Homer will make it safely across, he loses momentum near the end and plummets to the bottom, progressively becoming severely injured with each fall towards <b>the</b> <b>jagged</b> rocks, and receiving multiple fractures and wounds.|$|E
50|$|By {{the fall}} of 1870, the {{riverbed}} and banks were stabilized and a wooden apron capped St. Anthony Falls to stop the upstream progression of the collapsing falls. The apron buried <b>the</b> falls' <b>jagged</b> rocks and large waterfall cataract and tamed the falls' tumbling water.|$|R
5000|$|All {{the short}} stories {{take place in}} Gibraltar, in its streets, bars, workplaces, urban landscapes and open spaces.

60|$|For a {{few moments}} we were lost to sights and sounds away from our {{immediate}} vicinity. The bottom of the cove afforded hard going. Dead piñons and cedars blocked our way; <b>the</b> great, <b>jagged</b> stones offered no passage. We crawled, climbed, and jumped from piece to piece.|$|R
500|$|The {{fact that}} the groups below <b>the</b> <b>jagged</b> line in the table above are {{constant}} along the diagonals is explained by the suspension theorem of Hans Freudenthal, which [...] implies that the suspension homomorphism from [...] πn+k(S'n) to [...] πn+k+1(S'n+1) is an isomorphism for n > k + 1. [...] The groups πn+k(S'n) with n > k + 1 are called the stable homotopy groups of spheres, and are denoted πk'S: they are finite abelian groups for k ≠ 0, and have been computed in numerous cases, although the general pattern is still elusive[...] [...] For n ≤ k+1, the groups are called the unstable homotopy groups of spheres.|$|E
500|$|The Jewel Tower is {{a three-story}} {{building}} of Kentish Ragstone with a brick parapet, structurally largely unchanged since the 14th century. The walls that once faced {{away from the}} palace are finely coursed, but the interior two walls are more crudely finished. The external windows are almost all 18th-century in origin and made from Portland limestone. <b>The</b> <b>jagged</b> remnants of the former palace walls jut out {{from the sides of}} the tower. The moat, now dry, stretches away east from the tower, passing by the former landing stage for boats from the Thames, [...] long and made from ashlar stone. The clearances of the post-war era mean that there are now few neighbouring buildings to the tower, and it is much more visible than in previous centuries.|$|E
500|$|A free copy {{from some}} two generations later {{is in the}} Prado in Madrid. This is in a {{vertical}} format and measures 47 x 36cm. [...] A large tree is added at the left, and the foreground rocks extended higher. [...] The landscape is somewhat different, and reflects the world landscape style of Joachim Patinir, to whom the painting has been attributed in the past. [...] This was largely because <b>the</b> <b>jagged</b> peaks in the distance {{have been added to}} and altered to Patinir's trademark depiction of the distinctive landscape of Dinant, his hometown. This panel was attributed by Max Jakob Friedländer to a [...] "Master of Hoogstraten", an anonymous follower of Quentin Massys, and dated around 1510. [...] The awkwardness of the figures has been rectified, the placement of his feet and knees [...] "made more rational" [...] according to Rishel, but St Francis stares at the apparition. Another copy, placed tentatively in Brussels c.1500, is probably a copy of the Turin version.|$|E
50|$|In May 1880 the {{secretary}} of the Penzance Swimming Association met with the Town Council with a view to improve the facilities for bathers.
