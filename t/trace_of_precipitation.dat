40|$|The {{application}} of duplex stainless steels in various {{applications such as}} in petrochemical, water desalination and paper milling industries has rapidly increased in recent years, {{taking advantage of the}} combination of high strength and good corrosion resistance from the dual phase stainless steels. However, having low wear resistance and low surface hardness limits the applicability of the steels for wider applications; thus, improvement of the features is essential. A thermochemical hybrid treatment process has been developed to improve the wear resistance and surface hardness of duplex stainless steels without compromising its corrosion resistance. The process was performed by using a mixture of methane (CH 4), ammonia(NH 3) and nitrogen (N 2) at low temperature of below 500 °C. The process simultaneously introduces the alloying elements of carbon and nitrogen into the surface of the duplex stainless steels forming a precipitation free layer along with improvement of wear resistance and surface hardness. This study discusses the influence of the process parameters such as temperature, holding time and gas composition used during the process towards the structural development and morphology of the layer as well as the effects <b>of</b> <b>precipitation</b> on the chromium element. It was found that the nitrogen and carbon diffused at the layer producing expanded austenite phase and expanded ferrite phase of a complex combination of YN, yc, GIN and ao The expanded phases increased the surface hardness up to five times, improvised the wear resistance of the treated samples. However, <b>traces</b> <b>of</b> <b>precipitation</b> <b>of</b> chromium were detected in sample treated at prolonged 30 hours of holding time and for the sample treated for a temperature of 500 °C, indicating the limit of the process parameter used to produce the precipitation free expanded phases.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to determine the remaining useful life of gas turbine blade, using service-exposed turbine blades. This task is performed using Stress Rupture Test (SRT) under accelerated test conditions where the applied stresses to the specimen is between 400 MPa to 600 MPa and the test temperature is 850 °C. The study will focus on the creep behaviour of the 52000 hours service-exposed blades, complemented with creep-rupture modelling using JMatPro software and microstructure examination using optical microscope. The test specimens, made up of Ni-based superalloy of the first stage turbine blades, are machined based on International Standard (ISO) 24. The results from the SRT will be analyzed using these two main equations – Larson-Miller Parameter and Life Fraction Rule. Based on the results of the remaining useful life analysis, the 52000 h service-exposed blade has the condition to operate in the range of another 4751 hr to 18362 hr.

30|$|The Whitehurst Fire {{burned in}} Mt. Madonna County Park (Figure 1) from 21 to 26 June 2008. The park is 14 km from the ocean, and burned within an {{elevation}} range from 195 m to about 490 m above sea level. Sample plots ranged from 424 m to 487 m. The two closest NOAA weather stations are in Gilroy and Watsonville, California, which recorded temperatures of 41.7 °C and 40 °C, respectively, {{on the first}} day of the fire. Daytime temperatures ranged from 22.2 °C to 39.4 °C in Gilroy and 16.7 °C to 35.6 °C in Watsonville for the duration of the fire.

40|$|Atmospheric {{water vapour}} tracers (WVTs) are an elegant tool to {{determine}} source–sink relations of moisture "online" in atmospheric general circulation models (AGCMs). However, {{it is sometimes}} desirable to establish such relations "offline" based on already existing atmospheric data (e. g. reanalysis data). One simple and frequently applied offline method is 2 -D moisture tracing. It makes use of the "well-mixed" assumption, which allows for treating the vertical dimension integratively. Here we scrutinise the "well-mixed" assumption and 2 -D moisture <b>tracing</b> by means <b>of</b> analytical considerations in combination with AGCM-WVT simulations. We find that vertically well-mixed conditions are seldom met. Due {{to the presence of}} vertical inhomogeneities, 2 -D moisture tracing (i) neglects a significant degree of fast-recycling, and (ii) results in erroneous advection where the direction of the horizontal winds varies vertically. The latter {{is not so much the}} case in the extratropics, but in the tropics this can lead to large errors. For example, computed by 2 -D moisture <b>tracing,</b> the fraction <b>of</b> <b>precipitation</b> in the western Sahel that originates from beyond the Sahara is ~ 40 %, whereas the fraction that originates from the tropical and Southern Atlantic is only ~ 4 %. According to full (i. e. 3 -D) moisture tracing, however, both regions contribute roughly equally, showing that the errors introduced by the 2 -D approximation can be substantial...|$|R
40|$|Episodes {{of thick}} cloud and diamond dust/ice fog were {{observed}} during 15 March to 8 April 2011 and 4 to 5 March 2013 {{in the atmosphere}} above Dome C (Concordia station, Antarctica; 75 ° 06 ′ S, 123 ° 21 ′ E; 3233  m a. m. s. l.). The objectives of the paper are mainly to investigate the processes that cause these episodes based on observations and to verify whether operational models can evaluate them. The measurements {{were obtained from the}} following instruments: (1)  a ground-based microwave radiometer (HAMSTRAD, H 2 O Antarctica Microwave Stratospheric and Tropospheric Radiometers) installed at Dome C that provided vertical profiles of tropospheric temperature and absolute humidity every 7  min; (2)  daily radiosoundings launched at 12 : 00  UTC at Dome C; (3)  a tropospheric aerosol lidar that provides aerosol depolarization ratio along the vertical at Dome C; (4)  down- and upward short- and long-wave radiations as provided by the Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) facilities; (5)  an ICE-CAMERA to detect at an hourly rate the size of the ice crystal grains deposited at the surface of the camera; and (6)  space-borne aerosol depolarization ratio from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) lidar aboard the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) platform along orbits close to the Dome C station. The time evolution of the atmosphere has also been evaluated by considering the outputs from the mesoscale AROME and the global-scale ARPEGE meteorological models. Thick clouds are detected during the warm and wet periods (24 – 26 March 2011 and 4 March 2013) with high depolarization ratios (greater than 30  %) from the surface to 5 – 7  km above the ground associated with precipitation of ice particles and the presence of a supercooled liquid water (depolarization less than 10  %) clouds. Diamond dust and/or ice fog are detected during the cold and dry periods (5 April 2011 and 5 March 2013) with high depolarization ratios (greater than 30  %) in the planetary boundary layer to a maximum altitude of 100 – 300  m above the ground with little <b>trace</b> <b>of</b> <b>precipitation.</b> Considering 5 -day back trajectories, we show that the thick cloud episodes are attributed to air masses with an oceanic origin whilst the diamond dust/ice fog episodes are attributed to air masses with continental origins. Although operational models can reproduce thick cloud episodes in the free troposphere, they cannot evaluate the diamond dust/ice fog episodes in the planetary boundary layer because they require to use more sophisticated cloud and aerosol microphysics schemes...|$|E

The McComb-Pike County Airport received 12.57 in of rain, the highest precipitation total statewide. The heavy rains resulted in record rainfall totals for the month of October in several locations and flash floods. However, the majority of damage in the state was a result of strong northerly winds, which caused power outages and was destructive to the state's pecan and corn crops, which had been nearing harvest. Cotton crops that were harvested prior to the passage of Hilda were largely damaged. Power outages knocked out 460 telephone circuits and over 30,000 individual telephones. Strong winds also uprooted and felled trees and their limbs in addition to as well as a 200 ft tall radio mast near Moss Point, Mississippi. As a result of Hilda, 20 people were injured and damage exceeded $50,000.
