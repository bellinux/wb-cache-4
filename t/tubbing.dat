He stated baldly that he had not room to breathe, and requested the red-headed one to ease off a point or so in the direction of his next-door neighbour. Wren had refused, and, after a few moments' chatty conversation, smote William earnestly in the wind. Trouble had begun upon the instant. It had ceased almost as rapidly owing to interruptions from without, but the truce had been merely temporary.

40|$|Responses of [beta]-tubulin gene {{expression}} to low-temperature exposure (4 [deg]C) {{have been investigated}} in leaves of Arabidopsis thaliana. During low-temperature exposure, the patterns of both [alpha]- and [beta]-tubulin isoforms are altered; the effect is smaller for the [alpha]-tubulins than for the [beta]-tubulins, however. An examination of [beta]-tubulin {{gene expression}} revealed that during low-temperature exposure, transcript levels of <b>TUB</b> 2, <b>TUB</b> 3, <b>TUB</b> 6, and <b>TUB</b> 8 decrease, whereas those of <b>TUB</b> 4, <b>TUB</b> 5, and <b>TUB</b> 7 remain constant, and the <b>TUB</b> 9 transcript level increases. The changes in transcript levels of <b>TUB</b> 6, <b>TUB</b> 8, and <b>TUB</b> 9 were detectable after 6 h of low-temperature treatment. As shown by transcription-blocking experiments, the in vivo decay rates at 25 [deg]C are comparable to those at 4 [deg]C for <b>TUB</b> 5, <b>TUB</b> 6, and <b>TUB</b> 8 mRNAs, whereas <b>TUB</b> 9 mRNA {{appears to be more}} stable at 4 [deg]C than at 25 [deg]C. Thus, decreases in transcript levels of <b>TUB</b> 6 and <b>TUB</b> 8 in response to low temperature appear to be regulated at the transcriptional level, and the increase in <b>TUB</b> 9 transcript level that results from lowering the temperature from 25 [deg]C to 4 [deg]C may be due in part to its slower rate of decay at 4 [deg]C. When a chimeric gene containing 1061 base pairs of <b>TUB</b> 8 5 [prime] flanking DNA fused to the [beta]-glucuronidase coding region was used to produce transgenic Arabidopsis plants, the chimeric gene expression was down-regulated in response to low temperature as assayed by histochemical localization and RNA gel blots.

50|$|In {{order to}} hold back the water, the shaft had to be lined for about 115 yds with {{cast-iron}} <b>tubbing,</b> a slow and expensive operation. When sinking was resumed below this, the strata was much drier and most of the pumping equipment was removed. Sinking proceeded without further problems and the Top Hard seam was eventually reached in February 1877. The pumps were then installed in the No. 2 shaft and sinking was resumed there. Similar volumes of water were encountered and this shaft also required the installation of a similar length of <b>tubbing.</b> Later that year, in order to raise further capital, the Stanton Iron Co. decided to incorporate as a limited company and, early in 1878, 5752 shares were issued. The sinking headframes were then removed at the No. 1 shaft and the permanent headstocks erected. By the end of the year, the fitting-out work above and below ground was approaching completion and when the Top Hard seam was finally reached in the No. 2 shaft in February 1879 the Directors could report that the sinking had been completed and that production was ready to commence.|$|E

40|$|The yeast c-tubulin <b>Tub</b> 4 is {{assembled}} with Spc 97 and Spc 98 {{into the}} small <b>Tub</b> 4 complex. The <b>Tub</b> 4 complex binds via the receptor proteins Spc 72 and Spc 110 to the spindle pole body (SPB), the functional equivalent of the mammalian centrosome, where the <b>Tub</b> 4 complex organizes cytoplasmic and nuclear microtubules.

40|$|Abstract. ~/-Tubulin is a conserved {{component}} of microtubule-organizing centers and {{is thought to}} be involved in microtubule nucleation. A recently discovered Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene (<b>TUB</b> 4) encodes a tubulin that is related to, but divergent from, ~/-tubulins. <b>TUB</b> 4 is essential for cell viability, and epitopetagged <b>Tub</b> 4 protein (<b>Tub</b> 4 p) is localized to the spindle pole body (Sobel, S.

Microtubules containing <b>Tub</b> 3 as the only α-tubulin isotype were less dynamic than wild-type microtubules, as shown by a shrinkage rate and catastrophe frequency that were about one-third of that for wild-type microtubules. Conversely, microtubules containing <b>Tub</b> 1 as the only α-tubulin isotype were more dynamic than wild-type microtubules, as shown by a shrinkage rate that was 50 % higher and a catastrophe frequency that was 30 % higher than those of wild-type microtubules.

50|$|Dunn {{might have}} {{expected}} to inherit shares in the collieries owned by his family and be manager there, but the will of his Uncle Matthias who died in 1825 did not provide for this, perhaps because Dunn {{wanted to be able}} to continue his freelance work. Thus for the next 20 years or so he worked at many collieries in Britain and some in Europe. He leased and became a partner in several collieries including Stargate near Ryton, Co. Durham and Prestongrange, East Lothian,(now the site of the Prestongrange Industrial Heritage Museum) where, in 1830, he sank the first deep shaft in Scotland using Buddle’s cast-iron <b>tubbing</b> to line the shaft. This was a first use in Scotland as it was later by him in Ireland at one of the Castle Comer pits in Kilkenny. The Society for the Encouragement of the Useful Arts in Scotland subsequently awarded Dunn its first honorary medal for his work at Prestongrange.|$|E
50|$|Some {{ski resorts}} offer lodging options {{on the slopes}} themselves, with ski-in and ski-out access {{allowing}} guests to ski {{right up to the}} door. Ski resorts often have other activities, such as snowmobiling, sledding, horse-drawn sleds, dog-sledding, ice-skating, indoor or outdoor swimming, and hot <b>tubbing,</b> game rooms, and local forms of entertainment, such as clubs, cinema, theaters and cabarets. Après-ski (after skiing) is a term for entertainment, nightlife or social events that occur specifically at ski resorts. These add to the enjoyment of resort-goers and provide something to do besides skiing and snowboarding. The culture originated in the Alps, where it is most popular and where skiers often stop at bars on their last run of the day while still wearing all their ski gear. People that browse ski resort & hotel websites will commonly seek mention of the quality of après-ski in the area, and such information is often found. It is therefore seen as an important factor for skiers to consider before booking a holiday. The concept is similar to the nineteenth hole in golf.|$|E
5000|$|By 1840 {{the coal}} {{faces of the}} Albert and Crombourke mines were 1,400 feet below the surface. More {{flooding}} in 1843 caused the pit to close when it employed nearly 1,000 people and produced 1,000 tons of coal per day. The lower sections of the new shafts, which were around 1,590 feet deep, were lined with cast iron <b>tubbing</b> {{in an attempt to}} restrain water ingress. A design flaw was being rectified {{at the time of the}} flooding, which newspapers attributed to the closure of two nearby collieries that had shut down due to flooding and the absence of their pumping mechanisms had increased the volume of water present. Newspapers reported that Fitzgerald's losses as a result of the ingress — which was initially termed a [...] "destruction" [...] by the Morning Post — were at least £50,000. By the end of 1843 a beam engine with a 75-inch stroke had been installed to clear the water. The colliery was still closed in June 1846, by which time more than 157 million gallons of water had been pumped out and the coal lay 100 yards below the water level. Mining operations recommenced in January 1847 and were marked with a celebratory procession through the streets of Manchester and Salford but the disaster had ruined some of the company's directors and in 1848 Fitzgerald filed for bankruptcy. His son noted in 1843 that [...] My father, after spending £100,000 on a colliery, besides losses by everlasting rogues, runaway agents, etc., has just been drowned out of it ... So end the hopes of eighteen years; and he is near seventy, left without his only hobby! ... He is come to the end of his purse.|$|E

40|$|Mutations in {{genes of}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae that code for {{proteins}} that interact with β-tubulin were sought by screening for unlinked mutations {{that fail to}} complement mutations in the single β-tubulin-encoding gene (<b>TUB</b> 2). Among the first three noncomplementing mutations examined, two are linked to <b>TUB</b> 2 while one is unlinked. The unlinked mutation was {{shown to be a}} conditional-lethal allele of the major α-tubulin-encoding gene (<b>TUB</b> 1) and represents the first such mutation in that gene. The <b>tub</b> 1 - 1 mutation itself causes a cold-sensitive cell-cycle arrest, and confers supersensitivity to the antimicrotubule drug benomyl. These phenotypes occur {{in the presence of a}} wild-type copy of the minor α-tubulin-encoding gene, <b>TUB</b> 3; the combination of <b>tub</b> 1 - 1 and a <b>tub</b> 3 null mutation is inviable in haploids. Through further application of this method, new mutations in <b>TUB</b> 2 and <b>TUB</b> 3 were isolated as unlinked noncomplementers of <b>tub</b> 1 - 1. The noncomplementation between <b>tub</b> 1 and <b>tub</b> 2 mutations is gene specific and allele specific, suggesting that the phenotype is due to an interaction at the protein level. We conclude that isolation of unlinked noncomplementing mutations is likely to be a generally useful method for isolating mutations in interacting gene products...|$|R

50|$|New Ingleton Colliery SD695723 A new pit {{was started}} in December 1909. The No 2 pit was sunk {{alongside}} the A65 road starting in summer 1912. Its 14 feet diameter shaft was 247 yards deep. Water was struck at 33 yards. Pumps working at 32,000 gallons an hour were needed to drain it, and the shaft walls were lined with segmented iron castings known as <b>tubbing</b> to prevent water ingress. At 124 yards and 131 yards the Ten Foot and the Nine Foot seams were discovered, the first time these seams has been found on the heavily faulted coalfield. Sinking continued and the predicted Four Foot and Yard seams were not found. The Six Foot seam was found at 247 yards and limited working started 26 September 1914. Sinking No 1 pit (the upcast shaft) started in July 1913 and terminated on reaching 156 yards at the Ten Foot seam in November 1914. It allowed coal to be recovered from the Ten Foot but left the Six Foot seam without a second point of egress which was a legal requirement. Miners wages at up to 16s 0d a day were above the industry minimum of 9s 9d. Miners were attracted to Ingleton from other coalfields and the New Village housing estate was built. Screens were built alongside the company's sidings. The Ten Foot seam was excellent steam and house coal but was small in area. It was worked by driving two headings east and west from the shaft along the strike. It dipped 1 in 5 towards the north. Barren ground was reached 100 yards {{to the east and}} 225 yards to the east: gates to the north went barren within 100 yards, and gates to the south within 250 yards. The rest of the seam had been washed out before the red rock measures were deposited. The coal was worked out in 1918. Cross measure drifts were cut to the Nine Foot seam but this was lower quality coal and difficult to work and it too was abandoned in 1918.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{have used}} in vitro {{mutagenesis}} and gene replacement to construct five new cold-sensitive mutations in <b>TUB</b> 2, the sole gene encoding 13 -tubulin in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These and one previously isolated <b>tub</b> 2 mutant display diverse phenotypes that have allowed us to define the functions of yeast microtubules in vivo. At the restrictive temperature, all of the <b>tub</b> 2 mutations inhibit chromosome segregation and block the mitotic cell cycle. However, different microtubule arrays are present in these arrested cells depending on the <b>tub</b> 2 allele. One mutant (<b>tub</b> 2 - 401) contains no detectable microtubules, two (<b>tub</b> 2 - 403 and <b>tub</b> 2 - 405) contain greatly diminished levels of both nuclear and cytoplasmic microtubules, one (<b>tub</b> 2 - 104) contains predominantly nuclear microtubules...|$|R

Most public facilities with hot tubs post a sign stating {{that people with}} high blood pressure (or other med-ical conditions) should consult a physician before using them. In a MEDLINE search of articles published from 1966 to 2002, we found only one paper on the dangers of “hot <b>tubbing.</b> ” 1 This report, from Australia, published in 1980 and picturesquely subtitled “suicide soup, ” described near syncope in 3 healthy men immersed in a 41 °C hot tub for 3 periods of 20 minutes each. In 2 of the 3 men the di-astolic blood pressure became “unrecordable. ” To our knowledge, there is no other report confirming this obser-vation, testing the effect of shorter exposures or extending it to treated hypertensive subjects. It seemed possible that people with treated hypertension may be less able than those without hypertension to maintain blood pressure {{in the face of a}} vasodilator stress, owing either to a deficient baroreflex 2 or to drug therapy. 3 We therefore tested the hypothesis that hemodynamic responses to hot-water immersion would be greater in treated hypertensive subjects than in normotensive sub-jects.

40|$|BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Mutations in the Tubby gene (<b>TUB)</b> cause late-onset {{obesity and}} insulin {{resistance}} in mice and syndromic obesity in humans. Although <b>TUB</b> gene function {{has not yet}} been fully elucidated, studies in rodents indicate that <b>TUB</b> is involved in the hypothalamic pathways regulating food intake and adiposity. Aside from the function in central nervous system, <b>TUB</b> has also been implicated in energy metabolism in adipose tissue in rodents. We aimed to determine the expression and distribution patterns of <b>TUB</b> in man as well as its potential association with obesity. SUBJECTS/METHODS: In situ hybridization was used to localize the hypothalamic regions and cells expressing <b>TUB</b> mRNA. Using RT-PCR, we determined the mRNA expression level of the two <b>TUB</b> gene alternative splicing isoforms, the short and the long transcript variants, in the hypothalami of 12 obese and 12 normal-weight subjects, and in biopsies from visceral (VAT) and subcutaneous (SAT) adipose tissues from 53 severely obese and 24 non-obese control subjects, and correlated <b>TUB</b> expression with parameters of obesity and metabolic health. RESULTS: Expression of both <b>TUB</b> transcripts was detected in the hypothalamus, while only the short <b>TUB</b> isoform was found in both VAT and SAT. <b>TUB</b> mRNA was detected in several hypothalamic regions involved in body weight regulation, including the nucleus basalis of Meynert and the paraventricular, supraoptic and tuberomammillary nuclei. We found no difference in the hypothalamic <b>TUB</b> expression between obese and control groups, while the level of <b>TUB</b> mRNA was significantly lower in adipose tissue of obese subjects as compared to controls. Also, <b>TUB</b> expression was negatively correlated with indices of body weight and obesity in a fat-depot-specific manner. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate high expression of <b>TUB</b> in the hypothalamus, especially in areas involved in body weight regulation, and the correlation between <b>TUB</b> expression in adipose tissue and obesity. These findings suggest a role for <b>TUB</b> in human obesity. International Journal of Obesity accepted article preview online, 30 August 2017. doi: 10. 1038 /ijo. 2017. 214...|$|R
40|$|A Saccharomyces cerevisiae gamma-tubulin-related gene, <b>TUB</b> 4, {{has been}} characterized. The {{predicted}} {{amino acid sequence}} of the <b>Tub</b> 4 protein (<b>Tub</b> 4 p) is 29 - 38 % identical {{to members of the}} gamma-tubulin family. Indirect immunofluorescence experiments using a strain containing an epitope-tagged <b>Tub</b> 4 p indicate that <b>Tub</b> 4 p resides at the spindle pole body throughout the yeast cell cycle. Deletion of the <b>TUB</b> 4 gene indicates that <b>Tub</b> 4 p is essential for yeast cell growth. <b>Tub</b> 4 p-depleted cells arrest during nuclear division; most arrested cells contain a large bud, replicated DNA, and a single nucleus. Immunofluorescence and nuclear staining experiments indicate that cells depleted of <b>Tub</b> 4 p contain defects in the organization of both cytoplasmic and nuclear microtubule arrays; such cells exhibit nuclear migration failure, defects in spindle formation, and/or aberrantly long cytoplasmic microtubule arrays.
