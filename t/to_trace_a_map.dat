40|$|ABSTRACT. We {{present a}} {{characterization}} {{of all the}} principal meteorological parameters (wind speed and direction, pressure, and absolute and potential temperature) that extends up to 25 km from the ground above Dome C, Antarctica, for 2 years (2003 and 2004). The data set is composed of “analyses ” provided by the general circulation model (GCM) of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), and {{they are part of}} the MARS catalog. A monthly and seasonal (summer and winter) statistical analysis of the results is presented. The Richardson number is calculated for each month of the year over 25 km in order to study the relative stability of the atmosphere. This allows us <b>to</b> <b>trace</b> <b>a</b> <b>map</b> indicating where and when the optical turbulence has the highest probability of being triggered in the whole troposphere, tropopause, and stratosphere. Finally, we try to predict the best expected isoplanatic angle and wave-front coherence times (and, respectively) v t 0, max 0, max by employing Richardson number maps, wind speed profiles, and simple analytical models of vertical profiles. 2 CN 1...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is <b>to</b> <b>trace</b> <b>a</b> <b>map</b> of Italian local social capital endowments. It focuses on the “structural ” {{dimension}} of the concept, as identified with social networks. The analysis is based on a dataset collected by the author including about two hundred indicators of five main social capital dimensions: strong family ties, weak informal ties, voluntary organizations, civic awareness, and political participation. 51 key variables are selected for performing principal component analyses both on each of the five groups and on the entire dataset, in order to build latent indicators for every single social capital’s dimension and for the concept as a whole. Finally, a multiple factor analysis is run on the entire dataset, in search of a single synthetic measure of social capital. A clear distinction emerges between bonding social capital, shaped by strong family ties, and bridging and linking social capital, shaped by weak ties among friends, neighboors and members in voluntary organizations. Areas characterized by high levels of bonding social capital can suffer from a lack of bridging and linking ties. The study provides a valuable synthetic indicator capturing the particular configuration of social capital which the literature generally associates with positive economic outcomes...|$|E
40|$|Aim of {{this paper}} is to give an account of the {{evolution}} of local government in Italy and Spain during the years of the global crisis. A comparative analysis of the recent institutional reforms addressing the local level in both countries and the consequent challenges to representative institutions and territorial governance will be attempted. Starting from the concept of institutional sustainability, the argument proposed is that pre-reform local governments in both countries present a critical picture. Therefore, to what extent have the (recently approved) reforms impacted on local self-government and how? This paper aims at giving a theoretical contribution on this topic in four steps: first, by proposing a series of dimensions through with the concept of institutional sustainability can be detected; second, by linking these dimensions to the main challenges local governments have been facing since years; third by relating the types of local government reforms to these challenges and (fourth) to the Italian and Spanish cases. The final goal is <b>to</b> <b>trace</b> <b>a</b> <b>map</b> of the kind of local government reforms the two countries have chosen and to single out which are the expected effects on the local levels. The main conclusion is that whatever the over- or intermunicipality at stake (municipal union, fusion, province, metropolitan area, etc [...] .), it may turn out to be effective only as long as institutional sustainability is pursued...|$|E
40|$|Em seis décadas de atividade, entre 1927 e 1987, Arnaldo Dante Momigliano (1908 - 1987) publicou mais de setecentos artigos e resenhas, que formam o corpus de sua obra. Em função da opção de Momigliano por estudos de extensão limitada, apresentados na forma de artigos e conferências, sua obra possui um caráter disperso, o que torna difícil uma visualização clara de sua totalidade. Ainda que compilada nos volumes dos Contributi publicados ao longo da vida do historiador (e após sua morte), tal compilação se apresenta problemática. A presente pesquisa visa propor um mapeamento da obra de Momigliano e uma discussão e contextualização da mesma, centrada nos principais focos de sua produção, com ênfase nas questões da história da historiografia e da paz e liberdade no mundo antigo.

50|$|Just to {{the south}} of Alderbury Junction, where the {{abandoned}} Salisbury and Dorset Junction Railway left the line to Salisbury, the canal turned {{to the south}}-west, to avoid the high ground on which Alderbury stands. The A36 Alderbury bypass has in its turn obliterated part of the railway near the junction. The canal looped around ending at a road called Tunnel Hill, close to Alderbury House, a grade II* listed country house on the western edge of Alderbury, which was built in the late eighteenth century. A lake in the grounds is thought to have been built as part of the canal, and Tunnel Hill may reflect the fact that {{there would have been a}} tunnel just past the road, if the company had been able to finish the construction. The route of this final section is not easy <b>to</b> <b>trace</b> on <b>a</b> <b>map,</b> but it was not clearly defined on the 1881 map either, and there is some uncertainty about what was completed before all work ceased. Another feature of the canal was the feeder reservoirs. One remains, above the road from Alderbury to Farley at Pope's Bottom. The feeder passes under the road through an original bridge. A second reservoir was located {{to the south of}} the road, and although no longer there, its outline broadly follows a gap in the tree cover on the modern map.|$|R
40|$|The renal stones {{found in}} the mummies of Pandolfo III Malatesta, Lord of Fano (1370 – 1427) and an {{anonymous}} nobleman from Popoli (XVIII century) were investigated using different techniques. Both specimens were examined with binocular stereomicroscopy (BSM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), also with energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX). Multiple tiny fragments from surface and inner portions were submitted to X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. Subsequently, the calculi were imaged with microcomputed tomography (micro CT). The stone from Pandolfo had a mulberry-like surface with honey brown colour and measured 12 mm in largest diameter. Along with the organic constituents (C, O, and N), the following chemical elements were detected: K, S, Si, Cl, Ca, P, Na, and Ba. The calculus was composed of ammonium acid urate (95 %) and calcium oxalate dihydrate (weddellite) (5 %). Internal structure consisted of aggregated large spheroidal crystals with different density values. In the case from Popoli, the ovoidal mass with small superficial spherical buds measured 22 × 16 × 15 mm. The cut surface showed a central nucleus of sharp-edged crystals and concentric laminations. Detected chemical elements were: C, O, N,Ca, P, K, S, Cl, and Na. The stone composition was calcium oxalate monohydrate (whewellite; 90 %) and calcium phosphate (hydroxylapatite; 10 %). Internal structure detail revealed concentric laminations and aggregates of similar density values. These observations enabled us to propose an ideal protocol for the examination of stones {{that can be found}} in mummies and in osteoarcheological material. After preliminary observation with BSM, the specimen should be imaged with microCT, in order <b>to</b> <b>trace</b> <b>a</b> detailed <b>map</b> of the external surface and the whole calculus and guide the following SEM-EDX measurements for elemental distribution analysis. Matching the results from these methods avoids destructive XRD analysis and may allow to obtain an affordable evaluation of chemical composition on the entire stone, following a conservative approach...|$|R
40|$|This essay {{describe}} the research {{design of a}} study that explores the phenomenon of political indecision, with particular reference to the voting behaviour declared by left-wing voters in the Italian election campaign of 13 and 14 April. Different studies in Italy {{have looked at the}} phenomenon of voter indecision. They have tried in the first place to isolate the variables which influence electoral choice. Very often research into the behaviour of undecided voters is carried out by means of structured questionnaires. This research uses different instruments of analysis to understand the perception the subjects have of the election campaign and the elements individuals take into consideration to overcome indecision and reach a choice. The study was developed in three phases, each of which was distinct regarding the objectives and the instruments adopted. The undecided voters, who were identified initially by means of a structured questionnaire, were subsequently interviewed in depth and then re-contacted for a third time {{a few days before the}} election. The three phases of the research, considered in their entirety, make it possible to determine the changes in attitude (voting-not voting), to situate them in a specific phase of the election campaign (immediately prior to the elections or in the weeks preceding them), to isolate the specific indecision (between voting and abstaining, between coalitions, between parties of the same coalition) and to monitor “deviant” positions (for example, the movement from one political area to another or the differentiated vote for the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate). By means of this on-going approach to the sample group of voters it was therefore possible to “follow” the undecided voters and their decisional processes up until the moment of the vote. The use of a panel, in the tradition of the seminal studies dating from the 1940 s of Katz, Lazarsfeld and Berelson and dedicated to the relationship between media exposure and electoral choice, made it possible <b>to</b> <b>trace</b> <b>a</b> <b>map</b> of the processes of change. Moreover, the use of non-standard instruments also made it possible to examine more thoroughly the motivational aspects and the evaluations of the undecided voters...|$|E
40|$|In {{agreement}} with a regional strategy aimed to monitor grapevine yellows (GY) disease, an extensive survey {{was carried out}} covering the ten provinces of the Tuscany region. Symptomatic leaf-samples were collected from commercial vineyards and nurseries during 2009 and 2010. Laboratory analyses performed by nested PCR, and by Real-Time PCR (Angelini et al., 2007) both on 16 S ribosomal gene, confirmed that ‘bois noir’ (BN) is largely the most important GY in Tuscany with ubiquitous distribution. Molecular characterization of BN phytoplasmas relied on genetic diversity studied through multiple step amplification process {{of one or more}} genes followed by RFLP analysis. In recent times the latter technique was flanked by sequencing of amplicons and/or cloned amplicons followed by in silico RFLP analyses. This procedure enable to find in short time a wider BN genetic diversity through the identification of several single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) lineages. Nevertheless, {{little is known about the}} ecology of these newly defined subgroups and their putative role in the epidemiology of BN. Consequently, the model proposed by Langer and Maixner (2004) permitting the distinction of three biologically differentiable sequence variants (tuf type-I, tuf type-II and tuf type-III) is still widely adopted to study BN epidemiology. Recently, a newly TaqMan allelic discrimination assay was developed and proposed for the distinction of tuf type-I and tuf type-II (Berger et al., 2009). The objective of this study was to develop a real time PCR assay for the rapid and specific detection tuf type-I and tuf type-II and to compare it with nested PCR assays carried out on the same gene. For this purpose, two newly designed BHQplus probes (Biosearch Tech, CA, USA) were used in an allelic discrimination test to distinguish between tuf type-I and tuf type-II among BN positive samples identified in grapevine in Tuscany. Real-time PCR analysis was performed in duplicates in 12 μl-reactions, containing 6 μl IQ Powermix (Bio-Rad Laboratories, USA), 500 nM of each primer, 100 nM of FAM-VKI probe, 100 nM of CalFluor orange 560 -VKII probe, and 1 μl of sample DNA. Assays were carried out on Rotor-Gene Q (Qiagen, Germany). Standard curves traced on serial dilution of synthetic oligonucleotide permitted to calculate the reaction efficiency. The slopes of the linear fits reached - 3. 329 for the green channel indicating an efficiency of 99. 70 % (R 2 = 0. 992) for the tuf type-I assay. Similar results were obtained with the tuf type-II probe (Efficiency = 98. 64 %, R 2 = 0. 996). When applied to grapevine samples, results were automatically generated through the allelic discrimination option of the Rotor-Gene Q software (version 2. 0. 2, Qiagen). According to preliminary results, the newly designed assay for the simultaneous detection of tuf type-I and tuf type-II types resulted to be very efficient. A number of BN positive samples are still under characterization process with both methods real-time and nested-PCR to establish the presence of tuf type-I and tuf type-II and <b>to</b> <b>trace</b> <b>a</b> distribution <b>map</b> in Tuscany...|$|R
