25|$|One of {{the most}} {{successful}} slogan campaigns for Bull Durham was the “Roll Your Own” campaign. The campaign came at an ideal time, as product sales were low due to the competition against the emerging pre-rolled cigarette. <b>These</b> <b>ads</b> appeared {{around the time of the}} Great Depression and showed the low price of only a nickel per bag as well as an elegant scene with finely dressed, upper class looking people. This advertisement campaign originally had doubters, yet quickly these doubts were taken away when sales exploded. The ads made many in the middle and lower class want to go out to buy Bull Durham in order to emulate the upper class. The campaign was tremendously successful, using the desire for a better life to boost sales.|$|E

25|$|In addition, the Blackwell Co {{was among}} the first to {{implement}} a large-scale outdoor advertising campaign around the country. The company partnered with the New York Sign Company and hired skilled ad painter, Jule Gilmer Körner, or “Rueben Rink,” builder of the landmark home Korner's Folly, as head of advertising. <b>These</b> <b>ads</b> started in the late 1870s and consisted of giant depictions of the bull with catchy sayings or a depiction of the price. Rink hired 4 teams of painters to go around the states and constantly paint ads. These signs were placed on huge billboards along major roads and rails, on the side of various buildings, and any other place that would be regularly seen. This was done in hopes that spreading the name of the product and the continuity of the ads would increase sales.|$|E

500|$|While {{supported}} by the state's smaller, regional universities, HouseBill1 immediately drew the ire of University of Kentucky president Charles T. Wethington, Jr. Before becoming university president, Wethington had administered the community-college system. Most of the community colleges and the constituencies in their communities also opposed the plan. The university and the community colleges ran advertisements encouraging opposition to the plan; Patton characterized <b>these</b> <b>ads</b> as [...] "mean". Patton was disappointed when Greg Stumbo, {{a leader in the}} Kentucky House of Representatives and former advocate of an independent community-college system, announced his opposition the plan. Stumbo represented the community of Prestonsburg, an eastern Kentucky coal mining town, and Patton surmised that he was still angry about the worker's compensation bill. Prestonsburg was also the home of Prestonsburg Community College (now Big Sandy Community and Technical College). In the face of this opposition, Patton negotiated with individual legislators until he was convinced that he had a majority in both houses of the Kentucky General Assembly. He then pushed forward and was able to get the legislation passed.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we take a}} Construction Grammar {{approach}} to Du Bois' concept of resonance activation. We suggest that the structural mapping relations between juxtaposed utterances in discourse, {{described in terms of}} diagraphs in dialogic syntax, can acquire the status of ad hoc constructions or locally entrenched form-meaning pairings within the boundaries of an ongoing conversation. We argue that the local emergence of <b>these</b> <b>ad</b> hoc constructions involves the same cognitive mechanism described for the abstraction of conventional grammatical constructions from usage patterns. Accordingly, we propose to broaden the scope of Construction Grammar to include not only symbolic units that are conventionalized in a larger speech community, but also a dimension of online syntax, i. e. the emergence of grammatical patterns at the micro-level of a single conversation. Drawing on dialogic data from political talk shows and parliamentary debates, we illustrate the spectrum of <b>these</b> <b>ad</b> hoc constructional routines and show their local productivity, which we take as an indication of their (micro-) entrenchment within a given conversation. status: publishe...|$|R

This paper reports on a field study performed in a professional environment. Team activities have been continuously video recorded {{over a period of}} two months. More than 400 ad hoc interactions have been analyzed. Ad hoc interactions required up to 30 % of the team total time. <b>These</b> <b>ad</b> hoc interactions involve all the team members and as such may contribute to team awareness and improvement of shared mental model. Ad hoc team assistances can be categorized according to two purposes: the application domain or the development environment.

Suggestions are formulated for the management of team assistance activities. Keywords- Team process, team assistance, field study, ad hoc interactions, collocated team. I...|$|R
