The performance of the <b>toggle</b> brace <b>system</b> which enables the installed damper to generate larger effective control force due to its response amplification mechanism than a conventional brace system is evaluated.

The presented periodic reference tracking algorithm explicitly exploits a priori knowledge of the future values of the reference trajectory and its periodicity. We discuss the properties of our approach and illustrate it on the problem of reference tracking for a synthetic biology gene regulatory network known as the generalised repressilator.

40|$|Electrical {{switches}} are ubiquitous. Performance {{requirement for}} a switch is stringent. The operating mechanism mostly decides {{the performance of}} an electromechanical switch. However, design of such mechanisms, which involve discontinuous motions, is not much addressed in literature. The present work proposes a systematic procedure to design and analyze toggle based switching mechanisms. The work defined the toggle phenomenon rigorously, and, based on the behaviour of the toggles, provided a classification scheme for the switch mechanisms. The existing switches fall in two major categories viz., single-toggle and double-toggle switches. The double toggle mechanism is more suitable for high power breaking as it can isolate the system’s behaviour from the operator’s behaviour. The kinematic and geometric attributes of the operating mechanism which affect the toggle sequence and timings have been identified. A systematic simulation based study has been performed to identify the influence of different kinematic and dynamic parameters on the functionality of a double toggle switching mechanism. The influence of the variable moment of inertia and mechanism singularities arising out of introduction of the four bar sub chain {{on the performance of}} the system have been studied in detail. It is observed that the performance of the double <b>toggle</b> <b>systems</b> is less susceptible, though not immune to the user behaviour; in extreme scenarios the switching performance could become erratic. The use of an additional spring in an existing system enhanced the system performance; but, connecting the main spring with the coupler link altered the system performance more dramatically. Thus it established that the influence of the kinematic configuration on the performance of a switching mechanism is more pronounced than the dynamic characteristics of a comparable system. For the ab initio design of double toggle switching mechanisms, necessary structural criteria for a mechanism to exhibit double toggle phenomenon have been identified and verified with various 2 d. o. f. systems. It is also established that any double toggle mechanism cannot be used directly as a switching mechanism; the link dimensions, link arrangements and the stopper locations have to be chosen properly. Towards that end, three necessary kinematic criteria for a switching mechanism are identified. A few mechanisms which satisfy all structural and kinematic criteria are identified; the switching and toggle behaviour of these mechanisms are examined through simulations using Pro/Mechanism. Finally, considering all the conditions a is constructed with consideration of mass and geometric shape of the links. Thus, it established that the proposed methodology can systematically generate novel, structurally distinct electrical switches...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Bistability, the {{capacity}} to achieve two distinct stable steady states {{in response to a}} set of external stimuli, arises within biological systems ranging from the λ phage switch in bacteria to cellular signal transduction pathways in mammalian cells. On the other hand, more and more experimental evidence in the form of bimodal population distribution has indicated that noise plays a very important role in the switching of bistable systems. However, the physiological mechanism underling noise-induced switching behaviors remains to be fully understood. Results In this paper, we investigate the effect of noises on switching in single and coupled genetic <b>toggle</b> switch <b>systems</b> in Escherichia coli. In the case of the single toggle switch, we show that the multiplicative noises resulting from stochastic fluctuations in degradation rates can induce switching. In the case of the toggle switches interfaced by a quorum-sensing signaling pathway, we find that stochastic fluctuations in degradation rates inside cells, i. e., intracellular noises, can induce synchronized switching, whereas the extracellular noise additive to the common medium can not only entrain all the individual systems to switch in a synchronous manner but also enhance this ordering behavior efficiently, leading a robust collective rhythm in this interacting system. Conclusion These insights on the effect of noises would be beneficial to understanding the basic mechanism of how living systems optimally facilitate to function under various fluctuated environments. </p...|$|R

40|$|Switches play an {{important}} regulatory role {{at all levels of}} biology, from molecular switches triggering signaling cascades to cellular switches regulating cell maturation and apoptosis. Medical therapies are often designed to <b>toggle</b> a <b>system</b> from one state to another, achieving a specified health outcome. For instance, small doses of subpathologic viruses activate the immune system’s production of antibodies. Electrical stimulation revert cardiac arrhythmias back to normal sinus rhythm. In all of these examples, a major challenge is finding the optimal stimulus waveform necessary to cause the switch to flip. This thesis develops, validates, and applies a novel model-independent stochastic algorithm, the Extrema Distortion Algorithm (EDA), towards finding the optimal stimulus.

We used the Oregonator {{model of the}} oscillating BZ reaction to explore the dynamics brought about by a linear delayed feedback. The time-delayed feedback can generate a succession of complex dynamics: period-doubling bifurcation route to chaos; amplitude death; fat, wrinkled, fractal, and broken tori; and mixed-mode oscillations. We observed that this dynamics arises due to a delay-driven transition, or <b>toggling</b> of the <b>system</b> between large and small amplitude oscillations, through a canard bifurcation. We used a combination of numerical bifurcation continuation techniques and other numerical methods to explore the dynamics in the strength of feedback-delay space. We observed that the period-doubling and quasiperiodic route to chaos span a low-dimensional subspace, perhaps due to the trapping of the trajectories in the small amplitude regime near the canard; and the trapped chaotic trajectories get ejected from the small amplitude regime due to a crowding effect to generate chaotic-excitable spikes. We also qualitatively explained the observed dynamics by projecting a three-dimensional phase portrait of the delayed dynamics on the two-dimensional nullclines.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a {{framework}} for shaping pulses to control biological systems. By shaping a pulse we mean computing its magnitude and length, which results in reaching the desired control objective. An advantage of using pulses for biological control problems is that pulses can easily be implemented in a laboratory setting by scientists. Firstly, we consider the problem of switching between steady states in a multi-stable system. We show {{that it is possible}} to estimate the pulses fulfilling the objective, if the trajectories of the controlled system can be bounded from above and below by the trajectories of monotone systems. This result can be generalised to systems with uncertain parameter values under some mild assumptions on the set of admissible parameters. Hence, even with infinite sampling time (that is open-loop control) some robustness guarantees can be provided. Secondly, we consider a problem of inducing oscillatory behaviour in an eight species generalised repressilator, which is a monotone system. In this case, the problem reduces to keeping the trajectories in a neighbourhood of an unstable equilibrium. The problem is solved by creating an event-based control strategy, where an event is triggered by the trajectories leaving the prescribed neighbourhood. After the event is triggered a pulse is applied, which steers the trajectories towards the unstable equilibrium. Potentially, this approach can also be applicable to systems, which are bounded from above and below by monotone ones.

40|$|Tribus b. v. is {{a company}} in Utrecht that {{converts}} minibuses for multifunctional public transportation. This means that with the same bus both ambulant people and wheelchair occupants can be transported. The multifunctionality lies in {{the combination of a}} flexible floor layout and (tip) seats. The floor system is based on separate aluminium profiles that are assembled to form any desired floor layout. Tribus' tip seat FlexusPRO meets the highest quality and safety requirements. Because of its integrated three point safety belt, the seat can be positioned anywhere in the vehicle. A common seat layout is the 4 x 4 tip seats, where four FlexusPRO seats are positioned {{on the right side of}} the vehicle and four on the left. By folding the seat pan to the backrest and subsequently rotating the seat package to the side, a wheelchair environment is created without removing or repositioning the seat. This transformation from passenger seat (mode 1) to wheelchair space (mode 2) is an easy and fast operation that enables the transporter to do a combined transportation of ambulant people and wheelchair occupants with the same vehicle. Besides the benefits of Tribus' FlexusPRO, the tip seat also has some main drawbacks with respect to the production costs, weight, the available wheelchair space after seat transformation and the hindered view outside for the wheelchair occupant as a result of the seat dimensions in mode 2. The goal is to overcome these drawbacks, in order for Tribus to be able to launch a new tip seat that exceeds seats of competitors on price, weight, operation and functionality. The goal of this graduation project focuses on the improvements of the seat position in mode 2. This means an improvement of the transformation device, where the overall goal is to reduce the production costs and weight by at least 30 % and increase the view outside for the wheelchair occupant by at least 20 % in combination with an increased lateral wheelchair space of at least 10 %. However, in order to obtain a good design, a complete concept of the new tip seat needs to be proposed, where every aspect of the seat is able to fulfil the design requirements. A morphological approach resulted in three tip seat concepts that are rated with respect to usage and manufacturing aspects. The final concept led to a tip seat with a rotation device and a tilting backrest, that increases the lateral wheelchair space in mode 2. The improvement of the lateral wheelchair space is however dependent on the entire seat design, where the base frame of the seat will be leading. Because the base frame of the seat is not part of this project, a specific percentage of the improvement is not yet known, but an improvement of at least 10 % can be realized. The separate headrest of the seat is moved down during the transformation to mode 2, which improves the view outside for the wheelchair passenger. The entire seat design is also not part of this project, but research on commercial vehicles showed that a vertical adjustment of the headrest of 210 mm is possible, which would improve the view outside by approximately 33 %. The new seat concept is used as a guideline for the design of the two mechanisms that are needed for the transformation from mode 1 to mode 2. The tilting motion of the backrest resulted in a mechanism that provides a simultaneous movement of both backrest and seat pan. The benefit is that the additional (tilting) functionality of the seat had no effect on the amount of operations needed for the transformation. The mechanism is based on the over-centre principle of a <b>toggle</b> clamp. The <b>system</b> uses four pivot points that connects the backrest to both seat pan and seat frame. This innovative solution resulted in the fact that no additional locking devices where necessary to prevent the angular movement of the backrest in mode 1. The loads on the three point belt in the backrest, as a result of a frontal impact, are transferred into the mechanism which is only locked by the geometry of the backrest and seat pan. This mechanism prevents additional costs and weight as a result of the additional tilting functionality. Finally a new rotation device is designed. The use of a morphological approach resulted in four concepts. The best concept is elaborated, resulting in a new steel swivel of 3 kg, which is a weight reduction of 38 %. Because of the minimal amount of components, no welding operations and an easy and fast assembly, the cost price of the swivel is reduced by 47 %. Both tilting mechanism and swivel have been prototyped and they underlined the benefits that are mentioned in this report. The swivel has even been tested by a physical pull test and passed this test successfully. The goal of reducing the production costs and weight by at least 30 % has been exceeded on both aspects. The view outside for the wheelchair occupant could be improved by 33 %, which also exceeds the required 20 %. The required improvement of the lateral wheelchair space by 10 % can still be realized and will exceed this 10 % especially around the arms of the wheelchair occupant. The project has been a success and Tribus decided to continue the development of both mechanisms for series production.
