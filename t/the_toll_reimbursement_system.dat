40|$|Objective. To {{evaluate}} {{the influence of}} <b>reimbursement</b> <b>system</b> and organizational structure on oral rehabilitation of adult patients with tooth loss. Materials and methods. Patient data were retrieved from the databases of the Swedish Social Insurance Agency. The data consisted of treatment records of patients aged 19 years and above claiming reimbursement for dental care from July 1, 2007 until June 30, 2009. Before July 1, 2008, a proportionately higher level of subsidy was available for dental care in patients 65 years and above, but thereafter the system was changed, so that the subsidy was the same, regardless of the patient's age. Prosthodontic treatment in patients 65 years and above was compared with that in younger patients {{before and after the}} change of the <b>reimbursement</b> <b>system.</b> Prosthodontic treatment carried out in the Public Dental Health Service and the private sector was also analyzed.

After the change of the <b>reimbursement</b> <b>system,</b> there was a decrease in the proportion of items in patients 65 years and above in relation to those under 65.

Methods: First, the narrative data on nursing interventions were extracted from electronic medical record system of a tertiary university and mapped with Nursing Intervention Classification (NIC) by two researchers until 100 % consent was reached. Narrative nursing interventions mapped with NIC were then remapped with ABC codes system using the electronic program developed in the research. The mapping data were analyzed with real numbers, frequency, percentage, mean, and standard deviation. Results: More nursing interventions were mapped with ABC codes than Korean <b>reimbursement</b> <b>system.</b> Total of 97 different types of narrative interventions could be mapped with NIC, 43 NIC interventions could be reimbursed by ABC code but only 16 NIC interventions were reimbursed by Korea <b>Reimbursement</b> <b>System.</b> Conclusion: Korean medical insurance fee system needs amendment to include more comprehensively interventions performed by nurses which {{are very important to}} patient outcomes.

40|$|Objective. To {{investigate}} {{the impact on}} ICD coding behaviour of a new case-mix <b>reimbursement</b> <b>system</b> based on coded patient diagnoses. The main hypothesis was that after {{the introduction of the}} new system the coding of chronic diseases like hypertension and cancer would increase and the variance in propensity for coding would decrease on both physician and health care centre (HCC) levels. Design. Cross-sectional multilevel logistic regression analyses were performed in periods covering the time before and after the introduction of the new <b>reimbursement</b> <b>system.</b> Setting. Skaraborg primary care, Sweden. Subjects. All patients (n = 76 546 to 79 826) 50 years of age and older visiting 468 to 627 physicians at the 22 public HCCs in five consecutive time periods of one year each. Main outcome measures. Registered codes for hypertension and cancer diseases in Skaraborg primary care database (SPCD). Results. After the introduction of the new <b>reimbursement</b> <b>system</b> the adjusted prevalence of hypertension and cancer in SPCD increased from 17. 4 % to 32. 2 % and from 0. 79 % to 2. 32 %, respectively, probably partly due to an increased diagnosis coding of indirect patient contacts. The total variance in the propensity for coding declined simultaneously at the physician level for both diagnosis groups. Conclusions. Changes in the healthcare <b>reimbursement</b> <b>system</b> may directly influence the contents of a research database that retrieves data from clinical practice.

40|$|With the {{adoption}} of national health insurance in 1977, Korea has been utilizing fee-for-service payment with contract-based healthcare <b>reimbursement</b> <b>system</b> in 2000. Under the <b>system,</b> fee-for-service <b>reimbursement</b> {{has been accused of}} augmenting national healthcare expenditure by excessively increasing service volume. The researcher examined in this paper two major alternatives including diagnosis related group-based payment and global budget to contemplate the future of <b>reimbursement</b> <b>system</b> of Korean national health insurance. Various literature and preceding studies on pilot project and actual implementation of Neo-KDRG were reviewed. As a result, DRG-based payment was effective for healthcare cost control but low in administrative efficiency. Global budget may be adequate for cost control and improving the quality of healthcare and administrative efficiency. However, many healthcare providers disagree that excess care arising from fee-for-service payment alone has led to financial deterioration of national health insurance and healthcare institutions should take responsibility with global budget payment as an appropriate solution. Dissimilar payment systems may be applied to different types of institutions to reflect their unique attributes, and this process can be achieved step-by-step. Developing public sphere among the stakeholders and striving for consensus shall be kept as collateral to attain the desirable <b>reimbursement</b> <b>system</b> in the future...|$|R
40|$|Developed countries' {{publicly}} funded {{health care systems}} all share the similar task of deciding which pharmaceuticals should be reimbursed. DECD countries' pharmaceutical <b>reimbursement</b> <b>systems</b> achieve this task {{through a number of}} institutions some of which use Health Technology Assessment (HTA) including health economic analysis to inform decision-making. The reimbursement decisions influence the health outcomes of patients, produce signals of the demand curve to manufacturers and may have political consequences. The overall aim of this thesis is to examine the use of health economic analysis in DECD countries' <b>reimbursement</b> <b>systems</b> and the contribution of health economic analysis and other factors to decision-making. Chapter 2 provides a literature review of previous quantitative and qualitative studies examining the factors contributing to reimbursement decision-making in DECD countries. The review identified limited evidence for comparisons across DECD countries and outlined the methodological limitations of identifying influence. Chapters 3 and 4 categorise DECD <b>reimbursement</b> <b>systems</b> using a published framework. Application of the framework identified that Health Economic analysis is used by agencies operating in heterogeneous <b>reimbursement</b> <b>systems</b> with respect to the objectives, other institutions, processes, guidelines, interpretation and other factors considered alongside health economic analysis. Chapter 5 uses regression analysis to examine decisions by those agencies that similarly use clinical evidence and health economic analysis, and identifies common factors across four countries. Chapter 6 uses a qualitative methodology to match decisions for an agency using health economic analysis in comparison to one not and found evidence of the influence of health economic analysis alongside other evidence and process factors. Finally, chapter 7 concludes by outlining the differential contribution of health economic analysis depending on how it is used by the systems.
