25|$|<b>The</b> <b>irony</b> <b>is</b> that Nately {{actually}} {{sees his}} friends as Yossarian, Orr, Hungry Joe and Dunbar whom his parents {{would not be}} impressed with, but equally his parents would not like Aarfy whom they would see as a “climber”.|$|E
25|$|Having {{assembled}} an {{army that}} {{was close to}} the Carthaginian one in size if not in skill, the Roman dictator had the choice of seeking battle with Hannibal or trying a new ploy. Fabius was about to pull something similar to Hamilcar Barca's strategy on Hamilcar's own son Hannibal. <b>The</b> <b>irony</b> <b>is,</b> Fabius was not lacking in manpower like Hamilcar, nor would he fight a static campaign.|$|E
25|$|Both tickets offer All-Star Game goers {{unmatched}} {{vantage points}} in Busch Stadium at prices that are significantly discounted {{from the market}} value of a professional game. The opportunity to get an autograph from a Hall of Famer is a complimentary bonus. <b>The</b> <b>irony</b> <b>is</b> that Lou Brock was asked to participate in the event long before the connection was made between the Lewis & Clark Baseball League and the St. Louis great's full name: Louis Clark Brock.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{can easily}} at the worst, after all, give you up." [...] <b>The</b> <b>irony</b> <b>was</b> {{so obvious that}} it needed no care. [...] "I can easily at the worst, after all, even forget you." ...|$|R
25|$|The {{biggest problem}} with prosecuting Mengistu for {{genocide}} {{is that his}} actions did not necessarily target a particular group. They were directed against anybody who was opposing his government, and they were generally much more political than based on any ethnic targeting. In contrast, <b>the</b> <b>irony</b> <b>is</b> the Ethiopian government itself {{has been accused of}} genocide based on atrocities committed in Gambella. I'm not sure that they qualify as genocide either. But in Gambella, the incidents, which were well documented in a human rights report of about 2 years ago, were clearly directed at a particular group, the tribal group, the Anuak.|$|E
500|$|In 2012, {{longtime}} Radiohead producer Nigel Godrich {{said of the}} song: [...] "We {{tried to}} record it countless times, but it never worked. <b>The</b> <b>irony</b> <b>is</b> you have that shitty live version [...] To Thom's credit, he needs to feel a song has validation, {{that it has a}} reason to exist as a recording. We could do 'True Love Waits' and make it sound like John Mayer. Nobody wants to do that." [...] In 2016, more than 21 years after its debut, [...] "True Love Waits" [...] was finally released as the last track on Radiohead's ninth album, A Moon Shaped Pool, rearranged as a minimal piano ballad.|$|E
500|$|In 1989, Hillenburg {{enrolled}} in the Experimental Animation Program at CalArts: [...] "Changing careers like that is scary, but <b>the</b> <b>irony</b> <b>is</b> that animation is a pretty healthy career right now and science education {{is more of a}} struggle," [...] he admitted. He studied under Jules Engel, the founding director of the program, whom he considers his [...] "Art Dad" [...] and mentor. Engel accepted him into the program impressed by The Intertidal Zone. Hillenburg posited further, [...] " [...] also was a painter, so I think he saw my paintings and could easily say, 'Oh, this guy could fit in to this program.' I don't have any [...] animation really." [...] He graduated in 1992, earning a Master of Fine Arts in experimental animation.|$|E
40|$|This skripsi {{entitled}} “The <b>Irony</b> In Searching <b>The</b> Holy Grail In Novel The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown” {{is intended}} {{to be one of the}} requirements to accomplish the Sarjana tittle at Faculty Of Humanities, University Of Sam Ratulangi Manado. The aims of this research are to identify, classify and analyze <b>the</b> <b>irony</b> and how they are illustrated in searching the Holy Grail and identify and analyze <b>the</b> placement of <b>irony</b> in searching <b>the</b> Holy Grail in novel The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown. In conducting this research, the methodology used is descriptive method by Winarno (1984). The approach used in this research is intrinsic approach by Wellek and Warren (1977). Theory of irony by Landy (1972), <b>the</b> classification of <b>irony</b> from theory of Edgar V. Roberts (1983) and theory of plot by Tasrif (in Nurgiyantoro: 2002) are used to do the analysis. The results of this research show that <b>the</b> <b>irony</b> and its three types: verbal irony, dramatic irony and <b>irony</b> of situation <b>are</b> found in <b>the</b> novel. Verbal <b>irony</b> <b>is</b> illustrated through <b>the</b> character of Andre Vernet. Dramatic <b>irony</b> <b>is</b> illustrated through <b>the</b> character 2 ̆ 7 s statement of Teacher. Situational <b>irony</b> <b>is</b> illustrated through <b>the</b> character of Aringarosa. The analysis of <b>the</b> placement of <b>irony</b> shows that <b>the</b> <b>irony</b> elements <b>are</b> placed in rising action, climax and resolution. In rising action, <b>the</b> <b>irony</b> found <b>is</b> verbal <b>irony</b> through <b>the</b> character of Andre Vernet. In climax, <b>the</b> <b>irony</b> found <b>is</b> dramatic <b>irony</b> through <b>the</b> characters of The Teacher and Remy. In resolution, <b>the</b> <b>irony</b> found <b>is</b> situational <b>irony</b> through <b>the</b> character of bishop Aringarosa...|$|R
5000|$|Townshend {{stated in}} an {{interview}} that Baba O'Riley' is about the absolute desolation of teenagers at Woodstock, where audience members were strung out on acid and 20 people had brain damage. <b>The</b> <b>irony</b> <b>was</b> that some listeners took the song to be a teenage celebration: 'Teenage Wasteland, yes! We're all wasted! ...|$|R
6000|$|It is probable, however, that <b>the</b> <b>irony</b> <b>was</b> lost on <b>the</b> {{majority}} of the company, who were inclined to echo the extravagant praise of Mr. Raynor, the tourist. [...] "Wonderful! wonderful!" [...] said that gentleman; [...] "if I had not seen this I wouldn't have believed it. Why, that pear would make four of ours." ...|$|R
500|$|Potter and Quarshie are {{the only}} regular Holby City cast members who appear in the episode. Discussing Ric's motivations in [...] "Tuesday's Child", Quarshie {{explained}} that his character was born there, and was [...] "always meant to return at some point", leading to issues with his family. He expanded that in leaving Holby, Ric aimed to escape [...] "the politics and stresses in his own life", stating: [...] "It's somewhere he can recharge himself by getting back to uncomplicated medicine. <b>The</b> <b>irony</b> <b>is,</b> when he gets there, he realises there's no such thing, especially when you're constantly hustling to get funding for your clinic and struggling to find qualified doctors and nurses." [...] Like his character, Quarshie is native to Ghana, though moved to the United Kingdom when he was three years old.|$|E
2500|$|The {{story is}} told by [...] "Thérèse" [...] in an inn, to Madame de Lorsagne. It is finally {{revealed}} that Madame de Lorsagne is her long-lost sister. <b>The</b> <b>irony</b> <b>is</b> that her sister submitted to {{a brief period of}} vice and found herself a comfortable existence where she could exercise good, while Justine refused to make concessions for the greater good and was plunged further into vice than those who would go willingly.|$|E
2500|$|Within London, {{the desire}} for banks to be there put {{pressure}} on the City of London's ability to accommodate them. [...] In the mid-1980s a crisis point was reached and, although the City was able to expand its stock of modern office space, this did not happen before Canary Wharf had been set up as a competitor. [...] <b>The</b> <b>irony</b> <b>is</b> that Canary Wharf was built in the London Docklands that had, until 1970, been among the largest docks in the world. All manner of goods had been shipped from the factories of east London to the world; between 1961 and 1993 manufacturing employment in London fell from 1.6million to 328,000.|$|E
60|$|If {{we go now}} {{and look}} on these innumerable epitaphs, the pathos and <b>the</b> <b>irony</b> <b>are</b> strangely fled. They do not stand merely to the dead, these foolish monuments; they are pillars and legends set up to glorify the {{difficult}} but not desperate life of man. This ground is hallowed by the heroes of defeat.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> final <b>irony</b> <b>is</b> {{enduring}} fame: Malley {{is better}} known and more widely read today than either McAuley or Stewart.|$|R
5000|$|The name [...] "hunger circuses", now so universally used as to {{have almost}} {{suppressed}} {{the memory of the}} official communist-era term, derived from the circus-like domed architecture and <b>the</b> <b>irony</b> of constructing these massive food-related buildings during a period when food was scarce throughout Romania (due to Ceauşescu's policy of exporting most of Romania's agricultural produce in order to pay off the foreign debt). <b>The</b> <b>irony</b> <b>was</b> reinforced by <b>the</b> connotation of [...] "circus" [...] as ridiculous farce.|$|R
2500|$|The ill-feeling {{seems to}} have spread into the next {{generation}} for James records that John has cut 'march' trees down {{in the past and}} has thrown thorns and brambles from the march into the High Chapeltoun's hayfields. <b>The</b> <b>irony</b> <b>is</b> that John of Laigh Chapelton is suing James for cutting down trees from the march dyke and requires money to plant new trees and to compensate for the inconvenience he has been put through. We do not know the outcome, however the action is described as [...] "trifling and frivolous". The clue to the ill-feeling may be in the term 'straightening' which may imply that John's father agreed to a new march which may have resulted in some small loss of his lands.|$|E
2500|$|One year later, Out of Here {{was shown}} at Galerie Lelong in New York City. This second {{iteration}} contained {{an excerpt from}} a different speech by the President, and mentioned {{the end of the}} war and the gradual withdrawal of troops. Speaking on the changes, the artist commented, “It made the work more up to date…but <b>the</b> <b>irony</b> <b>is</b> that this project didn’t have to change much.” [...] Wodiczko cited the locations, Boston and New York, as sufficient to garner different readings of the work. “The works in Boston and New York have different publics. New York’s character and the [...] shows gave Out of Here a big international audience as opposed to the more local audience in Boston.” Collectively, these narratives paint a picture of the individual veterans who told them, the larger picture of the Iraq War, and the more subtle clues to the war’s repercussions.|$|E
2500|$|Plans for {{producing}} two sequels {{of the original}} film were announced by the original film's creator Dean Devlin at the 2006 San Diego Comic-Con. He was in talks with MGM to produce four films and he wanted {{two of them to}} be the final two films in his envisioned Stargate trilogy. In an interview with Sci Fi Wire, Devlin said that should the sequels be made, he hoped to enlist Kurt Russell and James Spader in the two sequels. Both Russell and Spader expressed interest, Devlin revealed. [...] "They've always said they wanted to do it. <b>The</b> <b>irony</b> <b>is</b> actually because it was 12 years ago that we made Stargate, [...] part two was actually supposed to take place about 12 years later. We were just going to kind of age them up as actors. So it actually works out really nicely." [...] These sequels would bypass the 12 years of mythology created by SG-1 and Atlantis if they are ever produced.|$|E
50|$|In 2002, {{however, the}} Anti-Sec {{community}} published {{use of the}} term to refer to people who work in the security industry by day, but engage in black hat activities by night. <b>The</b> <b>irony</b> <b>was</b> that for black hats, this interpretation was seen as a derogatory term; whereas amongst white hats it was a term that lent a sense of popular notoriety.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Strellenhaus took {{no notice}} of <b>the</b> <b>irony.</b> He <b>was</b> still looking {{critically}} at the horses. The salesman glanced round {{him in a}} perfunctory way.|$|R
25|$|The governor's {{race that}} year between Treen and Edwin Washington Edwards, making his third-term comeback, had been {{decided in the}} jungle primary in favor of Edwards by a wide margin. <b>The</b> <b>irony</b> <b>was</b> that Fitzmorris had won twice as {{lieutenant}} governor with Edwards {{at the top of}} the ballot. This time Edwards supported Freeman. It was a political oddity that was devastating to Fitzmorris. He never politically recovered from the defeat.|$|R
2500|$|The play {{provoked}} {{something of}} an upset. There were complaints about the [...] "horrific" [...] content (particularly the infamous Room 101 scene where Smith is threatened with torture by rats) and the [...] "subversive" [...] nature of the play. Most were worried by the depiction of a totalitarian regime controlling the population's freedom of thought. There was also {{a report in the}} Daily Express newspaper of 42-year-old Beryl Merfin of Herne Bay collapsing and dying as she watched the production, under the headline [...] "Wife dies as she watches", allegedly from the shock of what she had seen. An anonymous reviewer in The Times wrote: [...] "Inevitably, in a dramatic presentation of the book much of <b>the</b> <b>irony</b> <b>is</b> lost; and the weakness of this television version was that concentrating on the action it reduced the ideological explanation so drastically that it robbed the story of at least half its power". It was a [...] "pictorial simplification" [...] of [...] "Orwell's vision". The writer, however, admired the performances of Cushing, Mitchell and Morell.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>irony</b> <b>is</b> {{recognizable}} in {{each case}} only by using knowledge of the source concepts (e.g., that mud is opaque, that root canal surgery is painful) to detect an incongruity.|$|E
5000|$|According to Dreyfus, <b>The</b> <b>irony</b> <b>is</b> that Shuk-den is {{presented}} by his followers as the {{protector of the}} Ge-luk (dge lugs) school, of which the Dalai Lama is the (de facto) leader.|$|E
25|$|Prior to {{the hearing}} {{there had been}} a spate of {{criticism}} of the South African Judiciary by Zuma supporters, amongst whom were some prominent legal minds, such as Paul Ngobeni. In that context, <b>the</b> <b>irony</b> <b>was</b> that this was the third time the South African Judiciary had found in his favour, including Zuma's acquittal of the rape charge brought against him. The NDPP soon announced its intention to appeal the decision.|$|R
50|$|The governor's {{race that}} year between Treen and Edwin Washington Edwards, making his third-term comeback, had been {{decided in the}} jungle primary in favor of Edwards by a wide margin. <b>The</b> <b>irony</b> <b>was</b> that Fitzmorris had won twice as {{lieutenant}} governor with Edwards {{at the top of}} the ballot.

50|$|<b>The</b> great <b>irony</b> <b>is</b> that <b>the</b> victorious {{general of}} Isandlwana was himself {{killed by a}} fellow veteran of the battle. Today Ntshingwayo is {{traditionally}} regarded as a Zulu hero.|$|R
50|$|Understatement occurs frequently. This element {{establishes}} {{an air of}} studied, ironic nonchalance. <b>The</b> <b>irony</b> <b>is</b> often gentle, {{except when}} the subject matter concerns injustice or inhumanity. Then it becomes open and accusatory.|$|E
50|$|Mohun Biswas, in {{the novel}} A House for Mr Biswas (1961), by V.S. Naipaul, is pleased to think himself a {{follower}} of Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius; <b>the</b> <b>irony</b> <b>is</b> that he never actually behaves as a Stoic.|$|E
50|$|Mhow was a meter gauge railway {{district}} headquarters {{during the}} British Raj {{and even after}} 1947. <b>The</b> <b>irony</b> <b>is</b> that Mhow finally has a broad gauge connection with Indore but regular train services are yet to commence.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>irony</b> <b>was</b> that McNaughton's {{scheme for}} staving off {{revolution}} had {{the seeds of}} revolution inherent in it. Within two years the camps that had been greeted with such applause would be known throughout the country as slave camps. The [...] "volunteer inmates" [...] were not allowed newspapers, magazines or radios. Any man who left a camp, even for a visit to his family, was subsequently refused re-entry and the [...] "dole" [...] was denied to him.|$|R
40|$|Comprehension is an {{important}} factor in <b>the</b> functioning of <b>irony.</b> Readers who <b>are</b> unaware of <b>the</b> <b>irony</b> in an utterance are "sheep," whereas readers who understand <b>the</b> <b>irony</b> <b>are</b> "wolves" (Gibbs & Izett, 2005). Factors that may impact on <b>the</b> attitude toward <b>irony</b> not only include comprehension, but agreement (agreeing with the position taken in the utterance or not) and group membership (belonging to the target of <b>the</b> <b>irony</b> or not) as well. In an experiment, participants were asked to evaluate either ironic prejudices against women or ironic prejudices against men. The attitude toward the utterance and text is more positive when participants recognize the ironic intention, agree with the statement, and are not the members of the targeted group. These results imply that studies into the pragmatic effects of verbal irony should consider these 3 factors. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC...|$|R
