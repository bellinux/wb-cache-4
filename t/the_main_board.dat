5|$|The {{process of}} {{appointing}} a new Scotland manager is {{undertaken by the}} main SFA board. After a review was conducted by former First Minister of Scotland Henry McLeish, the SFA board structure was streamlined considerably in 2011. Professional game and non-professional game boards govern their respective areas of football, while <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>board</b> has a strategic focus. There are seven members on <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>board,</b> consisting of four SFA office bearers, one representative each from the professional game and non-professional game boards and one independent member. As of September 2013, these positions are occupied by Stewart Regan (chief executive), Campbell Ogilvie (president), Alan MacRae (first vice-president), Rod Petrie (second vice-president), Peter Lawwell (professional game) and Barrie Jackson (independent). The non-professional game position is presently vacant.|$|E

Smallpeice would join the London local board of Barclays Bank after their takeover of Martins Bank, a position he held until 1973.|$|E

25|$|The {{union has}} 97 congregations. Membership {{is tied to}} the {{individual}} congregations rather than to the union. Based on a form of weak congregationalism, these are autonomous organizations which elect their own leadership. The union therefore acts as a coordinating organization. The congregations are organized into five regional districts, each with their own board. The union has an annual meeting every year with delegates from each congregation. This body holds the supreme authorities within the union. It appoints <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>board,</b> other committees and various issues regarding economy, institutions and plans.|$|E

500|$|A printed inverted-F antenna can be {{implemented}} in the classic inverted-F shape, usually {{to one side of}} the circuit board where the ground plane has been removed from underneath the antenna. [...] However, another approach is a modified patch antenna, the shorted patch antenna. [...] In this approach, one edge of the patch, or some intermediate point, is grounded with grounding pins or vias through to the ground plane. [...] This works on the same principle as an inverted-F; viewed sideways, the F shape can be seen, it is just that the antenna element is very wide in the horizontal plane. [...] The shorted patch antenna has a wider bandwidth than the thin line type due to the greater radiation area. [...] Like the thin line type, the shorted patch antenna can be printed on the same printed circuit board as the rest of the circuitry. [...] However, they are commonly printed on to their own board, or on to a dielectric fixed to <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>board.</b> [...] This is done so that the antenna, can be suspended and effectively be in air dielectric, is a greater distance from the ground plane than it would otherwise be, or the dielectric used is a more suitable material for RF performance.|$|E

2500|$|Chess was {{designed}} for an ashtāpada (Sanskrit for [...] "having eight feet", i.e. an 8×8 squared board), {{which may have been}} used earlier for a backgammon-type race game (perhaps related to a dice-driven race game still played in south India where the track starts at the middle of a side and spirals into the center). Ashtāpada, the uncheckered 8×8 board served as <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>board</b> for playing chaturanga. Other Indian boards included the 10×10 Dasapada and the 9×9 Saturankam. Traditional Indian chessboards often have X markings on some or all of squares a1 a4 a5 a8 d1 d4 d5 d8 e1 e4 e5 e8 h1 h4 h5 h8: these may have been [...] "safe squares" [...] where capturing was not allowed in a dice-driven backgammon-type race game played on the ashtāpada before chess was invented.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the period}} 1903–1933, De Dageraad's {{membership}} grew from 613 to 2700, with 40 regional branches. At first, there existed {{a lot of}} mistrust amongst freethinkers regarding the [...] parliamentary democracy, seeing the adoption of universal suffrage in 1917/1919 had significantly strengthened the position of confessionalist political parties. Furthermore, the Communists and Social Democrats, that included several self-declared freethinkers, appeared unwilling to attack religion in the House of Representatives, {{because they did not}} want to exclude themselves from forming a ruling coalition with the Roman-Catholic State Party. To oppose the now more Christian politics, some freethinkers partook in several small anti-clerical and early Fascist protest parties, that initially looked up to Mussolini as 'the former socialist and religion-fighter'. In 1920, <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>board</b> of De Dageraad refused to found a political party that was officially linked to the association, to prevent infighting within its ranks.|$|E

2500|$|After the war, De Dageraad was {{reinstated}} {{and recovered}} quickly, {{helped by the}} fact it had taken an outspoken antifascist position before the war. Several local branches and magazines were founded, <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>board</b> convened again on 17 June 1945. During a conference on 27–28 October 1945, about 1150 members were present, and 9 branches represented. The new magazine De Vrijdenker, that counted well-known freethinkers such as Anton Constandse and Piet Spigt amongst its editorial staff, soon achieved over 2300 subscribers (1 June 1946), a year later 2645. De Dageraad sought cooperation with the newly founded Humanistisch Verbond (HV, [...] "Humanist League") and Humanitas (Latin for [...] "Humanity"). From 1957 onwards, the association continued under the name: De Vrije Gedachte (Vereniging tot bevordering van zelfstandig denken) ("The Free Thought (Association {{for the promotion of}} independent thought)"), with its magazine renamed to Bevrijdend denken ("Liberating thinking"). Despite considerable competition between De Vrije Gedachte, that held on to combatting church and religion, and the HV, that was primarily concerned with giving the unchurched an equal place in society, most DVG members opined cooperation was necessary, leading the board to advocate for dual memberships; however, a merger with the HV was rejected.|$|E
2500|$|In April 1960, Sir Ivan Stedeford {{established}} an advisory {{group known as}} the Stedeford Committee {{at the request of}} Harold Macmillan to report {{on the state of the}} British Transport Commission and to make recommendations. Sir Frank Smith, a retired former Chief Engineer at Imperial Chemical Industries, was asked by the Conservative Minister of Transport, Ernest Marples, to become a member of an advisory group; Smith declined but recommended Beeching in his place, a suggestion which Marples accepted. Dr Beeching, with a PhD in Physics, had been appointed to <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>board</b> of ICI at the age of 43. The board consisted of senior figures in British businesses, and none of the board had previous knowledge or experience of the railway industry. Stedeford and Beeching clashed on a number of issues, but the future size of the railway system was not one of them. For all the suspicion it aroused, the committee had little to say on this and the government was already convinced of the need to reduce the size of the rail network. In spite of questions being asked in Parliament, Sir Ivan's report was not published at the time. In December 1960 questions were asked in the Lords about this [...] "secret" [...] and [...] "under-the-counter" [...] study group. It was later suggested that Stedeford had recommended that the government should set up another body [...] "to consider the size and pattern of the railway system required to meet current and foreseeable needs, in the light of developments and trends in other forms of transport ... and other relevant considerations".|$|E
