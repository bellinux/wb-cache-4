40|$|This paper summarises the {{state-of-the-art}} {{in housing}} management and maintenance practise of Dutch housing associations {{based on a}} survey conducted among almost all housing associations. We address the question what the current developments are in housing management and maintenance practice in the Netherlands. In a housing stock policy document a housing association constructs {{a picture of the}} composition of the desirable dwelling portfolio and sets up market and complex strategies. 71 % of the housing associations have formulated a housing stock policy document and 57 % of all respondents have formulated management schemes on the level of housing complexes. The housing associations consider housing quality and market perspective as most important in determining their housing stock policy. 60 % of the housing associations apply more than one quality level managing their housing stock. 71 % of the housing perform condition assessments to draw up the maintenance planning. Just a third one of the housing associations use condition marks to record the technical state of building components. Over 60 % of the housing associations use maintenance contracts for responsive maintenance and planned maintenance, especially for the maintenance of central-heating boilers and lifts. 36 % of the respondents have concluded performance-based maintenance contracts <b>for</b> <b>paintwork.</b> OT...|$|R
50|$|In the 16th {{century the}} Ordnance Office had {{established}} 'annexes' in Chatham, Deptford and Woolwich; others were {{to follow in}} the vicinity of the other major Dockyards. These facilities, generally known as Gun Wharves, developed into purpose-built Ordnance Yards in the course of the eighteenth century. Built alongside deep-water quays, they usually comprised an assortment of buildings for storage, administration blocks, workshops (<b>for</b> woodwork, <b>paintwork</b> and metalwork) together with accommodation for officers, usually built around a central Grand Storehouse (primarily used for gun carriages). Exterior courtyards were laid out for the storage of cannonballs.|$|R
40|$|OTB Research {{institute}} {{has established}} a long-term research program to performance-based maintenance procurement in the technical management of housing stock. Stakeholders: housing associations, contractors and the Dutch Building Research Foundation are directly involved in this research program. Literature reviews, case studies, expert meetings and modelling of processes are part of our research methods. Dutch housing associations contract out most of their maintenance work and improvements. The outsourcing and commissioning of maintenance is becoming less of a commitment to carry out specific works according to a work program, {{and more of a}} performance-based co-operation between the client and contractors. Housing associations have developed performance-based contracts <b>for</b> <b>paintwork</b> including work to the substrates, flat roofing, lifts and central heating systems. The performance {{has to do with the}} performance of the elements during time and sometimes also to the service level, e. g. the response time and active maintenance time for breakdown service. A breakthrough of performance-based maintenance contracts is obstructed by a lack of knowledge of clients and contractors, desired flexibility in maintenance policy by clients and their desired low market prices. In many cases the contract period is restricted to maintenance work cycles of elements. Maintenance contractors want to be kept involved in the maintenance of housing complexes during a long period, for the optimal use of their knowledge. OT...|$|R

The polycyclotrimerization regularities of the 2, 4 -toeuylenediisocyanate in the solution and gel formation conditions of the created products have been studied; the critical conversion of the gel formation has been determined, and optimal conditions for synthesis of the oligocyclotrimers have been found. The construction of the oligocyclotrimers manufactured according to the polycyclotrimerization reaction and their molecular-mass characteristics have been investigated. The thermic and thermo-oxidation transformations of the manufactured oligomers have been studied. The technological-effective waste-free procedure for synthesis of the oligocyclotrimers on base of the 2, 4 -toluylenedidisocyanate has been developed. The technological regulation and specifications for manufacture of the isocyanate structure polyisocyanates have been developed.

40|$|Restoration of monuments of {{architecture}} is a {{sphere of activity}} which places particularly high demands on technical specialists and experts. It is necessary, depending on the objectives of restoration and finishing of a monument {{of architecture}} and its damages and defects, to select appropriate technologies and materials. Mineral substances as fillers, and inorganic (mineral) colouring pigments, along with liquid potassium glass form an ultrastrong combination of materials. It gives to paints made of these mineral substances, an extremely high weather resistance and durability. The functional concept of silicate paints {{is the ability to}} silicify with other mineral construction materials. Silicate paints are the only colouring system which enters into chemical compound with the base due to the liquid potassium silicate properties. Also, bonds between quartzitic elements in its fillers are formed. As a result, it provides yet greater wear resistance and resistance to chalking.

40|$|This {{paper is}} about the ‘inbetweeness’ {{as a means of}} {{creating}} and reflecting upon how people engage with space, not solely as resistance against but also in part being complicit in the promotion of transformation of space, as being ‘green’ and sustainable, in the entrepreneurial city. It is an empirical study of an event with practitioners in September 2014, part of a half day of ‘Green Narratives’ workshops promoting Bristol in the run up to the European Green Capital 2015. The venue chosen <b>for</b> the event, <b>Paintworks,</b> is a regenerated space, once a warehouse site abandoned from the decline of manufacturing, redeveloped as a new combination of the creative quarter in the city and entrepreneurial space. Wandering/flâneuring around the space of Paintworks offered an opportunity to illustrate an engagement with the microcosm of city to consider breaking the divide between economic or leisure; instead it is both a space of social and work. We provided a map for participants, not simply to navigate the place, but to show how they might engage whilst wandering between areas of housing and work spaces. Participants were invited to use the map and wander through a space from point A, the location of an event, to a non identified point B located on the map. As such, wandering as a research methodology and considering wandering as a means in exploring and better understanding how participants make sense of the city through lived experiences, particularly the in between boundaries between lived and work space. Whilst there is much of the ‘spatial turn’ and of the ‘movement-in-organization’ in critical management studies to examine alternative notions of entrepreneurialism, we look at the notion of inbetweeness to consider something other than movement as between two differing endpoints, but as a space in itself and propose that ‘to’ is where the everyday occurs. Through this approach we attempt to be sensitive to alternative forms of entrepreneurship and consider comments during the wander and afterwards, discussions in the bar [e. g. point B] as emergent narratives. These were of: Negotiating boundaries between past and current re-use of space; Transition points, colours used in spaces and waymarkers; and Subversion: ism. To problematize our findings, the wander and subsequent discussion provides insightful ways to reconsider intertwined ideals of sustainability and conceptual issues of political imaginings of entrepreneurship, and how participants seemed to engage with and to subvert these popular notions. The paper seeks to contribute to a lively debate by taking a critical approach of the entrepreneurial city portrayed as behaving much like businesses. Firstly, the paper takes a different approach, and though of wandering/ flâneuring seeks to interrupt movement, for the sake of movement, in spaces but considers the possibility of pausing to consider inbetweeness in exploring notions of transition and social change. Secondly, and related to the first point, it aims to put forward discussion of other possibilities than duality. Thus, it is not assumed participants are passive, nor confrontational, but take on place/time:based actions, and of how they use narratives to support their endeavors...|$|R
