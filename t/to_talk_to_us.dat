25|$|During {{the early}} period of {{exploration}} and development of ideas, premature conference presentations and individual seminars were given by {{various members of the}} Cambridge group in other archaeological departments in England and abroad. Individual scholars who were invited <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> in Cambridge in that period often felt, understandably, obliged to maintain a distinct opposition. While it is certainly the case that these presentations had occurred before our views had even begun to settle down, and that they were excessively aggressive, they {{played an important role in}} the process of enquiry and reformulation. In particular, the contrasts which were set up by us and by outside scholars allowed the views of the seminar group, and the differences of viewpoint within the group, to be clarified. The opposition highlighted our own opinion but also threw the spotlight on the blind alleys down which there was a danger of straying. Our aggression resulted from the conviction that we were doing something new. This, too, was important. In the initial period there was a clear idea of what was wrong with existing approaches and there was a faith that something else could be done.|$|E
500|$|Given {{the task}} of {{overhauling}} the Cardinals by owner Gussie Busch (and specifically to unload Templeton), Herzog was looking to trade Templeton when he was approached by Padres General Manager Jack McKeon at the 1981 baseball winter meetings. While McKeon had previously told Herzog that Smith was untouchable in any trade, the Padres were now so angry at Smith's agent Gottlieb that McKeon was willing to deal. [...] McKeon and Herzog agreed in principle to a six-player trade, with Templeton for Smith as the centerpiece. It was then that Padres manager Dick Williams informed Herzog that a no-trade clause had been included in Smith's 1981 contract. Upon learning of the trade, Smith's initial reaction was to invoke the clause and stay in San Diego, {{but he was still}} interested to hear what the Cardinals had to say. While the deal for the players beside Templeton and Smith went through, Herzog flew to San Diego to meet with Smith and Gottlieb over the Christmas holiday. Smith later recalled that, [...] "Whitey told me that with me playing shortstop for the St. Louis Cardinals, we could win the pennant. He made me feel wanted, which was a feeling I was quickly losing from the Padres. The mere fact that Whitey would come all the way out there <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> was more than enough to convince me that St. Louis was the place I wanted to be." ...|$|E

2500|$|Due to {{the lack}} of {{marriage}} equality at the time Rustin and partner Walter Naegle took an unconventional step to solidify their partnership and protect their unification. In 1982 Rustin adopted Naegle, 30 years old at the time, in order to legalize their union. Naegle explains, We actually had to go through a process as if Bayard was adopting a small child. My biological mother had to sign a legal paper, a paper disowning me. They had to send a social worker to our home. When the social worker arrived, she had to sit us down <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> {{to make sure that this}} was a fit home.Davis Platt, Bayard's partner from the 1940s, said [...] "I never had any sense at all that Bayard felt any shame or guilt about his homosexuality.

40|$|Natural {{languages}} have vast vocabularies, complex grammars and inherent ambiguities {{that make}} them difficult to be processed directly by computers, even with state-of-the-art technology. Therefore, in order to communicate with computers we need to ‘develop software’, which is actually the very process of translating our problem statements, data and solution algorithms from the languages we speak to the languages that computers speak. But software development and maintenance are costly, time consuming and have many major challenges of their own. In this document we present a group of techniques and tools, collectively named as Temizer Description System, that aim {{to bridge the gap}} between natural languages and computer languages by enabling computers to understand the logical structure of natural language texts. The main idea is to tag texts piece by piece in order to make them semantically meaningful to the computers. Once computers start figuring out the meaning of text chunks, they can also use the same chunks <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> back <b>to</b> <b>us</b> and we demonstrate how this new and effective way of communication could be used to automate (i. e. eliminate) many tedious and error-prone aspects of developing and maintaining software.

40|$|Sound is a {{neglected}} subject of today’s products and services. The new technologies {{changed the way}} we interact with the people, objects and the world around us, thus, designers should aim at all senses, contemplating a multi sensorial experience. In this scenario sound becomes an important aspect to be considered during the project phase in a design process. Sound becomes part of the product identity and expression, the way the product <b>talks</b> <b>to</b> <b>us.</b> <b>To</b> foster this scenario designers {{should be aware of the}} possibilities and attributes of sound and how to explore them in a creative way. In this short paper we investigated published articles, workshops and publications to collect sound methods and techniques to be used into a design process. As a result, we proposed twenty essential sound methods that could be applied in a design thinking context. This is an ongoing research, part of a thesis experiment, since further methods and refinement could be added in the future...|$|R
2500|$|Following the {{completion}} of the campaign in Poland the armoured forces were transferred to the west to prepare for the next set of operations. The four light divisions had proved to have inadequate firepower, and they were brought up to strength to full panzer divisions, one of which was given to Erwin Rommel. With this change the total number of panzer divisions in the Heer stood at ten. Guderian continued to work in development of the panzer arm. Said Hans von Luck of the 7th Panzer Division in his memoir: [...] "In the middle of February we were transferred to Dernau on the Ahr, hence practically in to the western front. Rommel visited every unit. He told us that he was proud to be permitted to lead a panzer division.

5000|$|In {{the lead}} up to the 2005 Cronulla riots in Cronulla, Koby Abberton spoke to The Daily Telegraph about the assault of a {{lifeguard}} that sparked the incident, claiming:"The reason why it's not happening at Maroubra {{is because of the}} Bra Boys. Girls go to Cronulla, Bondi, everywhere else in Sydney and get harassed, but they come to Maroubra and nothing happens to them. I read all this stuff about kids getting harassed because {{they want to have a}} surf and I say 'are you kidding?' The beach should be for Aussie kids. But if you want to go to beaches and act tough in groups you better be able to back it up. If these fellas come out to Maroubra and start something they know it's going to be on, so they stay away."Members of the Bra Boys joined in the racial violence when the riots spread to Maroubra soon afterwards. Afterwards the Abberton brothers then held a joint media conference with members the Comanchero Motorcycle Club (a bikie gang, who include many Lebanese as their members) to help ease tensions, declaring peace. [...] "I think that this is the start, the boys have agreed <b>to</b> come down and <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> <b>to</b> start some dialogue between the groups, you know, to try and ease some tension", said Sunny Abberton in a group interview on The 7.30 Report.|$|R
40|$|MOTINTERNATIONAL Brussels {{are pleased}} to {{announce}} the first solo exhibition of Laure Prouvost in Belgium. Generous and prodigious, Laure Prouvost’s practice combines language and images to create stories that seduce and disturb simultaneously. Exploring the boundaries between fiction and reality, her works are composed of videos, paintings, ready-made sculptures and sound installations. Through the narrative potential of objects and cinematic tropes, Prouvost leaves room to imagine new meanings within mistakes and mistranslations, questioning the norm. The artist’s films and installations form spaces erupting with materials, colours and textures. Prouvost creates confusion between what is true and what is false, reality and fantasy. With humor, she disrupts our perceptions through fragments of texts, sounds and images to trigger new sensations. The spectator is physically present {{as part of the}} work. The Meeting was especially created for MOTINTERNATIONAL Brussels. The exhibition takes as its starting point Prouvost’s 2014 film How to Make Money Religiously. Presented at the New Museum, New York, earlier this year, Prouvost confronted money and religion, memory and spirituality. Through a disjointed narrative, viewers encountered characters offering home-made masks and performing obscure rituals. For The Meeting, Prouvost has turned the space of the film into an installation, inviting her masked characters to convene inside the gallery. They seem suspended in what appears to be an important meeting, examining the trompe l’oeil collages, paintings and screens set in front of them. These threadlike sculptures want <b>to</b> engage <b>us,</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> about their lives and invite <b>us</b> <b>to</b> participate. In the second room, two videos perform a dialogue, leading us further into a world of complex and poetic vocabulary...|$|R
6000|$|In this matter, then, {{as in all}} {{the other}} matters treated in this book, our main {{conclusion}} {{is that it is}} a fundamental point of view, a philosophy or religion which is needed, and not any change in habit or social routine. The things we need most for immediate practical purposes are all abstractions. We need a right view of the human lot, a right view of the human society; and if we were living eagerly and angrily in the enthusiasm of those things, we should, ipso facto, be living simply in the genuine and spiritual sense. Desire and danger make every one simple. And <b>to</b> those who <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> with interfering eloquence about Jaeger and the pores of the skin, and about Plasmon and the coats of the stomach, at them shall only be hurled the words that are hurled at fops and gluttons, [...] "Take no thought what ye shall eat or what ye shall drink, or wherewithal ye shall be clothed. For after all these things do the Gentiles seek. But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you." [...] Those amazing words are not only extraordinarily good, practical politics; they are also superlatively good hygiene. The one supreme way of making all those processes go right, the processes of health, and strength, and grace, and beauty, the one and only way of making certain of their accuracy, is to think about something else. If a man is bent on climbing into the seventh heaven, he may be quite easy about the pores of his skin. If he harnesses his waggon to a star, the process will have a most satisfactory effect upon the coats of his stomach. For the thing called [...] "taking thought," [...] the thing for which the best modern word is [...] "rationalizing," [...] is in its nature, inapplicable to all plain and urgent things. Men take thought and ponder rationalistically, touching remote things--things that only theoretically matter, such as the transit of Venus. But only at their peril can men rationalize about so practical a matter as health.|$|R

She came riding down a grass path in the thickets below Lady Grove, perched up on a huge black horse, and the old Earl of Carnaby and Archie Garvell, her half-brother, were with her. My uncle had been bothering me about the Crest Hill hot-water pipes, and we were returning by a path transverse to theirs and came out upon them suddenly. Old Carnaby was trespassing on our ground, and so he hailed us in a friendly fashion and pulled up <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>us.</b>|$|E
60|$|With the {{regiment}} of escort we had practically no communication; I {{think that they}} had been forbidden <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>us.</b> They were a very silent set of men, finely-made, capable persons, of an Arab type, light rather than dark in colour, who seemed for the most part {{to communicate with each other}} by signs or in low-muttered words. Evidently they looked upon Harût and Marût with great veneration, for any order which either of these brethren gave, if they were brethren, was obeyed without dispute or delay. Thus, when I happened to mention that I had lost a pocket-knife at one of our camping-places two days' journey back, three of them, much against my wish, were ordered to return to look for it, and did so, making no question. Eight days later they rejoined us much exhausted and having lost a camel, but with the knife, which they handed to me with a low bow; and I confess that I felt ashamed to take the thing.|$|E
5000|$|The Abberton {{brothers}} and numerous {{members of the}} Bra Boys received negative coverage in Australian media following the racially charged 2005 Sydney race riots originating between opposing ethnic mobs on Cronulla beach. The negative media coverage motivated further rioting of the same racially charged nature on a string of other popular Sydney beaches, said to {{be an attempt to}} address the reported incidents of assaults and intimidatory behavior by groups of non-locals, some of whom were identified in earlier media reports as youths of Middle Eastern appearance from the suburbs of Western Sydney. In the lead up to the riots, Abberton spoke to The Daily Telegraph about the assault of a lifeguard that sparked the incident, claiming:"The reason why it's not happening at Maroubra is because of the Bra Boys.

Koby Abberton, his brothers, and other member of the Bra Boys were labeled as playing catalyst to the riots with Abberton singled out as the main culprit. Later, Abberton disputed the claims that he had attempted to fuel the riots, going on to tell The Sydney Morning Herald that he was [...] "ashamed to be Australian that day" [...] and had attempted, alongside his {{brothers and}} other Bra Boys to deflect and suppress the racially charged riots.|$|R
