5|$|The Constitutional Tribunal, which {{consisted}} of the Chief Justice Yong Pung How and Judges of Appeal M. Karthigesu and L.P. Thean, held that although Article 5(2A) was in abeyance, it represented the will of Parliament and therefore {{had to be taken}} into consideration. The Tribunal concluded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>had</b> no power under Article 22H(1) to withhold his assent to any bill seeking to amend any of the provisions referred to in Article 5(2A).|$|E
5|$|The defense {{relied on}} the {{provision}} of the Tenure of Office Act that made it applicable only to appointees of the current administration. Since Lincoln had appointed Stanton, the defense maintained Johnson had not violated the act, and also argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>had</b> the right to test the constitutionality of an act of Congress. Johnson's counsel insisted that he make no appearance at the trial, nor publicly comment about the proceedings, and except {{for a pair of}} interviews in April, he complied.|$|E

25|$|Patil's term as the President of India saw various controversies. She {{commuted}} {{the death}} sentences of 35 petitioners to life, a record. The presidential office, however, defended this by saying <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>had</b> granted clemency to the petitioners after due consideration and examining {{the advice of}} the Home Ministry.|$|E
25|$|Justice Black {{wrote for}} the majority. It was {{delivered}} exactly {{three weeks after the}} oral hearing on June 2nd. Black took, as he often did, an absolutist view, holding <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>had</b> no power to act except in those cases expressly or implicitly authorized by the Constitution or an act of Congress.|$|E
25|$|The Steelworkers favored {{government}} {{seizure of}} the plants under any available theory to a Taft–Hartley injunction against it; Arthur Goldberg, General Counsel for the Steelworkers and the Congress of Industrial Organizations, argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>had</b> the inherent power to seize the plants, {{as well as the}} statutory authority under the Selective Service Act and the Defense Production Act.|$|E

25|$|The steel industry's brief focused {{instead on}} the lack of {{statutory}} authority for this seizure, emphasizing Congress' decision when enacting the Taft–Hartley Act to give the President the power to seek an injunction against strikes that might affect the national economy instead. It denied <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>had</b> any power to seize private property without express legislative authorization, noting that Truman himself had asked for such legislative authority when the United Mine Workers of America went out on strike in 1950.|$|E
25|$|On June 2, 1952, in a 6-3 ruling, the Supreme Court {{declared}} in Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer {{that the president}} lacked the authority to seize the steel mills. Writing for a heavily divided majority, Justice Hugo Black held <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>had</b> no authority under the Constitution to seize private property {{on the grounds of}} national security. Since the Congress had not otherwise authorized the president to seize the steel mills, the president could not do so.|$|E
25|$|After several minutes, the {{coverage}} {{came back to}} the CBS newsroom where Cronkite reported <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>had</b> been given blood transfusions and two priests had been called into the room. He also played an audio report from KRLD that someone had been arrested in the assassination attempt at the Texas School Book Depository. Back in Dallas Barker announced another report of the death of the President, mentioning that it came from a reliable source. Before the network left KRLD's feed for good, Barker first announced, then retracted, a confirmation of Kennedy's death.|$|E

50|$|On December 3, 2013, the House Judiciary Committee held {{a hearing}} {{on whether or not}} to impeach <b>the</b> <b>President.</b> At <b>the</b> hearing, there were views among Republicans <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>has</b> not done his duty and that he abused his {{executive}} power.|$|R
25|$|Participants in the February {{coup attempt}} were tried under the regular {{military}} justice system. But {{in response to}} the November coup attempt, the government created ad hoc courts based on the 1938 legal code of Eleazar López Contreras, drawn up twenty years before the transition to democracy. The Supreme Court ultimately ruled the courts unconstitutional but not on the due process grounds for which they were criticised. The Court instead found <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>had</b> neglected to suspend the relevant constitutional rights (right to a defense, right to be tried by one's natural judge).|$|E
25|$|Starting in December 2010, Tunisian {{citizens}} began mass protesting against {{unemployment and}} Ben Ali's corruption. As mass protests grew, Ben Ali {{declared a state}} of emergency in the country, dissolved the government on 14 January 2011 and promised new legislative elections within six months. Later on that same day Prime Minister Mohammed Ghannouchi went on state television to say he was assuming power in Tunisia and said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>had</b> left the country. Ben Ali fled the country on 14 January at 4:00pm local time on a flight bound for Dubai and arrived in Saudi Arabia early on Saturday 15 January, where he was welcomed by Saudi authorities. The protests became known as the Tunisian Revolution.|$|E
25|$|Cruz also {{successfully}} defended, in Medellin v. Texas, the State of Texas {{against an}} attempt to re-open the cases of 51 Mexican nationals, {{all of whom were}} convicted of murder in the United States and were on death row. With the support of the George W. Bush Administration, the petitioners argued that the United States had violated the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations by failing to notify the convicted nationals of their opportunity to receive legal aid from the Mexican consulate. They based their case on a decision of the International Court of Justice in the Avena case which ruled that by failing to allow access to the Mexican consulate, the US had breached its obligations under the Convention. Texas won the case in a 6–3 decision, the Supreme Court holding that ICJ decisions were not binding in domestic law and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>had</b> no power to enforce them.|$|E

50|$|Zivotofsky v. Kerry, , is a United States Supreme Court case {{in which}} <b>the</b> Court held <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>has</b> an {{exclusive}} power of recognition, and, therefore, Congress may not require the State Department to indicate in passports that Jerusalem is part of Israel.|$|R
50|$|During Goldsmith's {{tenure at}} the Office of Legal council, he wrote at least two legal memos authorizing a program known as Stellar Wind; his memos said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>has</b> {{inherent}} constitutional power to monitor Americans' communications without a warrant {{in a time of}} war.|$|R
25|$|In late January 2003, it was {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>had</b> been admitted to Nairobi Hospital to have a blood clot– the after-effect of his car accident– removed from his leg. He came out of hospital and addressed the public outside the hospital on TV in a visibly incoherent manner, and speculation since then is that he had suffered a stroke, his second, the first being said to have occurred sometimes in the 1970s. His subsequent ill health greatly diminished his performance during his first term and the affairs of government during that time {{are said to have}} been largely run by a group of loyal aides, {{both in and out of}} government. Kibaki did not look well, for instance, when he appeared live on TV on 25 September 2003 to appoint Moody Awori Vice President after the death in office of Vice President, Michael Wamalwa Kijana.|$|E
25|$|Ellsworth served {{until his}} {{resignation}} due to poor health on December 15, 1800, and his brief contribution was {{overshadowed by the}} accomplishments of his successor, John Marshall, who succeeded him in 1801. However, four cases the Ellsworth Court decided were of lasting importance in American jurisprudence. Hylton v. United States (1796) implicitly addressed the Supreme Court's power of judicial review in upholding a federal carriage tax (although {{it would not be}} until John Marshall succeeded Ellsworth that the court addressed this issue head on); Hollingsworth v. Virginia (1798) affirmed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>had</b> no official role in amending the Constitution of the United States, and that a Presidential signature was therefore unnecessary for ratification of an amendment; Calder v. Bull (1798) held that the Constitution's Ex post facto clause applied only to criminal, not civil, cases; and New York v. Connecticut was the first exercise by the court of its original jurisdiction in cases between two states.|$|E
25|$|The Duke de Broglie was {{carefully}} preparing {{a way to}} bring down Thiers. He modified the rules of the Assembly so <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>had</b> the power to veto laws passed by the Assembly, but also requiring that the President ask permission from the head of the Assembly before he spoke to the body. On 2 April, the moderate republican president of the Assembly, Jules Grévy, was forced to resign by a personal scandal and was replaced by a deputy of the center-right, Buffet, who supported a constitutional monarchy. Soon afterwards, on 27 April, an election was held in Paris to fill a vacant seat in the Assembly. Both the candidate of the monarchists and the moderate republican candidate supported by Thiers was defeated by a more radical republican named Barodet, who was supported by Leon Gambetta and the left wing of the republicans. Further elections were held on 11 May: five of the six open seats were won by republicans. The right wing of the Assembly became alarmed that the country was moving too far to the left and {{decided it was time to}} get rid of Thiers.|$|E

500|$|As Altgens {{set up for}} {{a second}} {{photograph}} along Elm Street, he heard a sound that he recognized as gunfire, and saw <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>had</b> been struck in the head. Altgens later wrote that his camera was focused and ready, [...] "but when JFK's head exploded, sending substance in my direction, I virtually became paralyzed.... Yet, many news people say I should have taken the picture anyway... I should have made the picture that I {{was set up to}} make. And I didn't do it." ...|$|E
500|$|Doctor Charles Leale, an Army surgeon, {{found the}} President unresponsive, barely {{breathing}} {{and with no}} detectable pulse. Having determined <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>had</b> {{been shot in the}} head, and not stabbed in the shoulder as originally thought, he made an attempt to clear the blood clot, after which the President began to breathe more naturally. The dying President was taken across the street to Petersen House. After remaining in a coma for nine hours, Lincoln died at 7:22am on April 15. Secretary of War Stanton saluted and said, [...] "Now he belongs to the ages." ...|$|E
500|$|Although President Bush shook Colbert's hand {{after his}} presentation, several of Bush's aides and {{supporters}} walked out during Colbert's speech, and one former aide commented <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>had</b> [...] "that look that he's ready to blow". Colbert recalled that [...] "not {{a lot of}} people laughed in the front row" [...] during the speech, and that [...] "when it was over, no one was even making eye contact with me ... no one is talking to me in the whole damn room"; only Scalia came to him afterward, praising Colbert's imitation of a gesture the justice had recently been photographed making.|$|E
50|$|During the credits, a {{breaking}} news report is shown: any bombs Sam did not sabotage are detonated, killing thousands; however, any deactivated bombs are reported as being discovered.
