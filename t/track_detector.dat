50|$|A {{solid-state}} nuclear <b>track</b> <b>detector</b> or SSNTD (also {{known as}} an etched <b>track</b> <b>detector</b> or a dielectric <b>track</b> <b>detector,</b> DTD) is a sample of a solid material (photographic emulsion, crystal, glass or plastic) exposed to nuclear radiation (neutrons or charged particles, occasionally also gamma rays), etched, and examined microscopically. The tracks of nuclear particles are etched faster than the bulk material, and {{the size and shape}} of these tracks yield information about the mass, charge, energy and direction of motion of the particles. The main advantages over other radiation detectors are the detailed information available on individual particles, the persistence of the tracks allowing measurements to be made over long periods of time, and the simple, cheap and robust construction of the detector.|$|E

50|$|In the {{radiation}} detection application, CR-39 {{is used as}} a Solid-State Nuclear <b>Track</b> <b>Detector</b> to detect the presence of ionising radiation. Energetic particles colliding with the polymer structure leave a trail of broken chemical bonds within the CR-39. When immersed in a concentrated alkali solution (typically sodium hydroxide) hydroxide ions attack and break the polymer structure, etching away the bulk of the plastic at a nominally fixed rate. However, along the paths of damage left by charged particle interaction the concentration of radiation damage allows the chemical agent to attack the polymer more rapidly than it does in the bulk, revealing the paths of the charged particle ion tracks. The resulting etched plastic therefore contains a permanent record of not only the location of {{the radiation}} on the plastic but also gives spectroscopic information about the source. Principally used for the detection of alpha radiation emitting radionuclides (especially radon gas), the radiation-sensitivity properties of CR39 are also used for proton and neutron dosimetry and historically cosmic ray investigations.|$|E

40|$|This {{document}} {{contains the}} pre-design {{of the beam}} diagnostics components <b>Tracking</b> <b>Detectors</b> for the Super-FRS. A GEM-TPC detector has been suggested as suitable <b>tracking</b> <b>detector</b> for the ion/fragment beams produced at the in-flight separator Super-FRS under construction at the FAIR facility. The detector concept combines two widely used approaches in gas filled detectors, the Time Projection Chamber (TPC) and the Gas Electron Multiplication (GEM). Three detector generations (prototypes) have been tested in 2011, 2012 and 2014 with relativistic ion beams at GSI. Due to the high-resolution achromatic mode of the Super-FRS, highly homogeneous transmission <b>tracking</b> <b>detectors</b> are crucial to tag {{the momentum of the}} ion/fragment beam. They must be able to provide precise information on the (horizontal and vertical) deviation from nominal beam optics, while operated with slow-extracted beam on event-by event basis, in order to provide unambiguous identification of the fragments. The main requirements are a maximum active area horizontally and vertically of (380 x 80) mm 2, a position resolution of < 1 mm, a maximum rate capability of 1 MHz, a dynamic range of about 600 fC.
