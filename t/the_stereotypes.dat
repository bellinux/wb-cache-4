A real doctor (Dr. David Kish) was hired by Madonna to administer the fake shots, since {{she wanted to make}} the scenes appear real. The first day of shooting took place on June 2, 2003, and the scenes shot included the wall-of-mirrors, the massage, the botox injection and the ballet dancing sequences. The next day started with the French maid, the motel TV, the telephone conversation and the glamour shot scenes.

In Study 1, female participants were asked why men are (or are not) better than them at maths. They generated their answers individually or through group discussion, and their subsequent maths performance was highest when they collectively challenged <b>the</b> <b>stereotype</b> and lowest when they collectively affirmed <b>the</b> <b>stereotype.</b> When participants affirmed <b>the</b> <b>stereotype</b> through discussion, they used more theories which supported the validity of <b>the</b> <b>stereotype,</b> compared to <b>the</b> individual thought condition; and consensus mediated the effect of group discussion on performance (relative to individual rumination). In Study 2, male and female participants affirmed or challenged <b>the</b> <b>stereotype</b> in same-gender discussion groups. After affirming <b>the</b> <b>stereotype,</b> women 2 ̆ 7 s performance decreased relative to their baseline scores and men 2 ̆ 7 s performance was ‘lifted’. In contrast, when they challenged <b>the</b> <b>stereotype,</b> {{there was no difference between}} the performance of men and women on the maths test.

As hypothesized, it was found that the presence of a male <b>stereotype</b> significantly influenced <b>the</b> perceived masculinity of the character, as the masculinity ratings were higher for those characters with <b>the</b> <b>stereotype</b> present than those characters with no stereotype activation.

According to Professor Stephen Railton of the University of Virginia, Twain was unable to fully rise above <b>the</b> <b>stereotypes</b> of black people that white readers of his era expected and enjoyed, and, therefore, resorted to minstrel show-style comedy to provide humor at Jim's expense, and ended up confirming rather than challenging late-19th century racist stereotypes.|$|E

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{examined the}} role that the consistency between a perceiver's stereotype and a target's behavior plays in the judgment of stereotype-relevant behaviors.

Behaviors were identified either with members of random groups, with members of extended families, or with single individuals. Consistent with predictions, the tendency to assimilate ambiguous behaviors increased as expected consistency increased.

25|$|In Yayoi Kusama’s Walking Piece (1966), a {{performance}} that was documented {{in a series}} of eighteen color slides, Kusama walks along the streets of New York City in a traditional Japanese kimono with a parasol. The kimono suggests traditional roles for women in Japanese custom. The parasol, however, is made to look inauthentic as it is really a black umbrella painted white on the exterior and decorated with fake flowers. Kusama walks down unoccupied streets in an unknown quest. She then turns and cries without reason, and eventually walks away and vanishes from view. This performance, through the association of the kimono, involves <b>the</b> <b>stereotypes</b> that Asian American women continue to face. However, as an avant-garde artist living in New York, her situation alters the context of the dress, creating a cross-cultural amalgamation. Kusama is able to point out the stereotype in which her white American audience categorizes her, by showing the absurdity of culturally categorizing people in the world’s largest melting pot.|$|E
25|$|In the U.S., the 1904 World’s Fair (also {{known as}} the Louisiana Purchase Exposition) had an exhibit of Filipinos dressed as the Igorot tribe. This led to the mistaken {{portrayal}} of Filipinos as solely representative of the Igorot people. Filpino students looked to dispel <b>the</b> <b>stereotypes</b> of the Igorot tribe by dressing in American style clothing. Throughout {{the course of the}} week, Filipina women were allowed to either dress in American clothes or Filipino clothes. Filipina students often alternated between the two styles of dress. For the purposes of work and study, Filipina students decided to wear American clothing. On other occasions such as special events, Filipina students opted for traditional Filipino clothing. Garments such as the terno were often worn for such special events. The wearing of the terno was interpreted as a patriotic thing to do, showing pride in Filipino culture. For male pensionados, their styles of clothing differed from the “Manong” generation. Instead of wearing suits, male Filipino students opted to wear hats instead of suits and ties. The main reason for this occurrence was because male Filipino students wanted to differ themselves from the negative stereotypes surrounding individuals belonging to the Manong generation. For some male Filipino students, more money was spent on clothing and material possessions than their education and food.|$|E
