5|$|SM UB-1 was {{commissioned}} into the German Imperial Navy {{under the command}} of Oberleutnant zur See Franz Wäger on 29 January. An Austro-Hungarian Navy officer was assigned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> for piloting and training purposes. On 26 June 1915, UB-1 sank an Italian torpedo boat 5 PN in the Gulf of Venice.|$|E
5|$|Work {{started in}} 1831, and progressed quickly, {{including}} {{the construction of}} a bridge at Bradford on Tone and Harpford Bridge at Langford Budville, where a new warehouse was also built. In addition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> lift in Nynehead two aqueducts were required within the village.|$|E
5|$|A {{downline}} {{used for}} open ocean diving {{is much the}} same as a shotline, but does not reach {{all the way to the}} bottom. An open-ocean downline is weighted at the bottom, and attached to a substantial float at the surface, which may be tethered <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat.</b> It may be marked at intervals by knots or loops, and may be attached to decompression trapeze system. In some cases a sea anchor may be used to limit wind drift, particularly if attached to a boat with significant windage.|$|E

5|$|After braving several obstacles, Jack and Rose return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> deck. The {{lifeboats}} have departed {{and passengers}} are falling {{to their deaths}} as the stern rises out of the water. The ship breaks in half, lifting the stern into the air. Jack and Rose ride it into the ocean and he helps her onto a wooden panel only buoyant enough for one person. He assures her that she will die an old woman, warm in her bed. Jack dies of hypothermia but Rose is saved.|$|E
5|$|Ship's {{regulations}} {{were designed to}} keep third class passengers confined to their area of the ship. The Titanic was fitted with grilles to prevent the classes from mingling and these gates were normally kept closed, although the stewards could open them {{in the event of}} an emergency. In the rush following the collision, the stewards, occupied with waking up sleeping passengers and leading groups of women and children <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> deck, did not have time to open all the gates, leaving many of the confused third class passengers stuck below decks.|$|E

60|$|The silver {{cups and}} other {{valuables}} were packed in boxes, and were, during the night, carried by coolies down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats,</b> over which a guard was placed until morning. Provisions {{for the journey}} down the river were also placed on board. The palace was astir long before daybreak. The cushions that had been slept on during the night were carried down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats,</b> <b>the</b> boxes of wearing apparel closed and fastened, and a hasty meal was taken.|$|R

5|$|A {{long and}} winding route {{had to be}} taken to reach topside; the steerage-class accommodation, located on C through G decks, was at the extreme ends of the decks, and so was the {{farthest}} away from the lifeboats. By contrast, the first-class accommodation was located on the upper decks and so was nearest. Proximity to the lifeboats thus became a key factor in determining who got into them. To add to the difficulty, many of the steerage passengers did not understand or speak English. It was perhaps no coincidence that English-speaking Irish immigrants were disproportionately represented among the steerage passengers who survived. Many of those who did survive owed their lives to third-class steward John Edward Hart, who organised three trips into the ship's interior to escort groups of third-class passengers up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> deck. Others made their way through open barriers or climbed emergency ladders.|$|E
5|$|Across coastal areas, {{the storm}} surge {{flooding}} caused minor damage to dozens of homes and closed several roads. Near Homosassa, two {{people who did not}} evacuate required water rescue. At Egmont Key State Park, a woman fell off of a boat when a band of showers and surging currents made navigation difficult; her husband and a friend drowned after jumping in to save her without life jackets, though the woman returned safely <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat.</b> The rainfall caused some temporary road flooding, though precipitation was mostly beneficial in alleviating drought conditions. Moderate wind gusts caused scattered power outages and downed some trees across the northeast portion of the state. Overall, property damage in the state rose to about $390,000 (2006USD) in total.|$|E
5|$|At 00:05 on 15 April, Captain Smith {{ordered the}} ship's {{lifeboats}} uncovered and the passengers mustered. He also ordered the radio operators to begin sending distress calls, which wrongly placed the ship {{on the west}} side of the ice belt and directed rescuers to a position that turned out to be inaccurate by about 13.5 nautical miles (15.5mi / 25km). Below decks, water was pouring into the lowest levels of the ship. As the mail room flooded, the mail sorters made an ultimately futile attempt to save the 400,000items of mail being carried aboard Titanic. Elsewhere, air could be heard being forced out by inrushing water. Above them, stewards went door to door, rousing sleeping passengers and crew– Titanic did not have a public address system– and told them to go <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Boat</b> Deck.|$|E

5|$|Returning to Belgium, Tintin {{discovers that}} Balthazar's brother has {{produced}} a range of replicas of the fetish, which he had discovered among his deceased brother's belongings, and learns that the original has been purchased by a wealthy American, Mr. Goldbarr; now aboard a ship to the United States. Catching up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat,</b> Tintin finds that Alonso and Ramón are aboard, and they struggle for the possession of the fetish. It smashes on the deck, with the diamond falling into the sea. Tintin, Alonso and Ramón struggle, and fall overboard. Tintin is rescued, but Alonso and Ramón drown and are shown en route to Hell. Goldbarr gives Tintin the stolen fetish {{to return to the}} museum, where it is repaired and put back on display.|$|E
5|$|The Boat Captain– A humorous addition, the Boat Captain {{encountered}} Kratos {{on several}} occasions, although these were always <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Boat</b> Captain's detriment. In God of War, Kratos ignored him {{when in the}} belly of the Hydra and brushed him aside in the Underworld. In God of War II, the Boat Captain fled from Kratos as a spirit even though summoned to fight him, and in God of War III, he left a note of hatred towards Kratos in the Underworld and his voice was heard in Kratos' psyche. The character was voiced by Keith Ferguson in God of War and God of War II, and Josh Keaton in God of War III during the psyche sequence.|$|E
5|$|The trio {{returns to}} the hospital, resolving to defend {{themselves}} against the zombie horde. Setting up barricades and making improvised weapons, they battle the zombies, but Menard is killed. The patients reanimate inside the hospital, killing the staff, as the zombies breach the defences. Peter, Anne, and Brian escape as the hospital is consumed by fire. Brian is attacked by a zombified Susan, whom Peter shoots before the three make it back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> and leave the island. At sea, Brian dies. Anne and Peter lock his body in a cabin as proof {{of what has happened}} on Matul. His reanimated corpse begins banging on the door, as Peter and Anne listen to a radio report that the New York Harbor incident has escalated into an epidemic: as zombies advance on the Brooklyn Bridge, the entire city is under attack.|$|E

5|$|Thea goes on an {{inflatable}} banana boat {{with her friend}} Margaret and her mother, while Carla presents her new art sculpture. The shark goes for Thea but attacks and kills Margaret's mother instead. Ellen boards Jake's boat {{to track down the}} shark, intending to kill it to save the rest of her family. After hearing about what happened, Mike confesses about the shark, infuriating Carla. Mike and Jake are flown by Hoagie to search for Ellen, and they find the shark in pursuit of their boat. During the search, Hoagie explains to Mike about Ellen's belief that the shark that killed Sean is after her family. When they finally find her, Hoagie lands the plane on the water, ordering Mike and Jake to swim <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> as the shark drags the plane and Hoagie underwater.|$|E
5|$|Titanic had a {{total of}} 20 lifeboats, {{comprising}} 16wooden boats on davits, 8 {{on either side of}} the ship, and 4 collapsible boats with wooden bottoms and canvas sides. The collapsibles were stored upside down with the sides folded in, and would have to be erected and moved to the davits for launching. Two were stored under the wooden boats and the other two were lashed atop the officers' quarters. The position of the latter would make them extremely difficult to launch, as they weighed several tons each and had to be manhandled down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> deck. On average, the lifeboats could take up to 68 people each, and collectively they could accommodate 1,178– barely half the number of people on board and a third of the number the ship was licensed to carry. The shortage of lifeboats was not because of a lack of space nor because of cost. Titanic had been designed to accommodate up to 68lifeboats– enough for everyone on board– and the price of an extra 32lifeboats would only have been some , a tiny fraction of the $7.5 million that the company had spent on Titanic. In an emergency, lifeboats at the time were intended to be used to transfer passengers off the distressed ship and onto a nearby vessel. It was therefore commonplace for liners to have far fewer lifeboats than needed to accommodate all their passengers and crew, and of the 39British liners of the time of over , 33 had too few lifeboat places to accommodate everyone on board. The White Star Line desired the ship to have a wide promenade deck with uninterrupted views of the sea, which would have been obstructed by a continuous row of lifeboats.|$|E
