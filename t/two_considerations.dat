5|$|In 1974, DARPA {{secretly}} requested {{answers from}} five aircraft manufacturers regarding <b>two</b> <b>considerations.</b> The first {{was about the}} signature thresholds at which an aircraft is virtually undetectable. The second point was whether these companies {{had the capacity to}} design and manufacture such an aircraft. Fairchild and Grumman declined to participate, while General Dynamics insisted on the use of electronic countermeasures. As a result, General Dynamics left the discussion. The remaining two companies, McDonnell Douglas and Northrop, were each awarded $100,000 for further research.|$|E
25|$|Even so, the {{decision}} by OKL to support the strategy in Directive 23 was instigated by <b>two</b> <b>considerations,</b> both of which {{had little to do}} with wanting to destroy Britain's sea communications in conjunction with the Kriegsmarine. First, the difficulty in estimating the impact of bombing upon war production was becoming apparent, and second, the conclusion British morale was unlikely to break led OKL to adopt the naval option. The indifference displayed by OKL to Directive 23 was perhaps best demonstrated in operational directives which diluted its effect. They emphasised the core strategic interest was attacking ports but they insisted in maintaining pressure, or diverting strength, onto industries building aircraft, anti-aircraft guns, and explosives. Other targets would be considered if the primary ones could not be attacked because of weather conditions.|$|E
25|$|The genetic {{difference}} between domestic and wild populations can be framed within <b>two</b> <b>considerations.</b> The first distinguishes between domestication traits that are presumed {{to have been}} essential at {{the early stages of}} domestication, and improvement traits that have appeared since the split between wild and domestic populations. Domestication traits are generally fixed within all domesticates and were selected during the initial episode of domestication, whereas improvement traits are present only in a proportion of domesticates, though they may be fixed in individual breeds or regional populations. A second issue is whether traits associated with the domestication syndrome resulted from a relaxation of selection as animals exited the wild environment or from positive selection resulting from intentional and unintentional human preference. Some recent genomic studies on the genetic basis of traits associated with the domestication syndrome have shed light on both of these issues.|$|E

500|$|When {{designing}} the Mercury spacecraft, NASA had considered using a nitrogen/oxygen mixture {{to reduce the}} fire risk near launch, but rejected it based on <b>two</b> <b>considerations.</b> First, nitrogen used with the in-flight pressure reduction carried the risk of decompression sickness (known as [...] "the bends"). But the decision to eliminate {{the use of any}} gas but oxygen was crystalized when a serious accident occurred on April 21, 1960, in which McDonnell Aircraft test pilot G.B. North passed out and was seriously injured when testing a Mercury cabin / spacesuit atmosphere system in a vacuum chamber. The problem was found to be nitrogen-rich (oxygen-poor) air leaking from the cabin into his spacesuit feed. North American Aviation had suggested using an oxygen/nitrogen mixture for Apollo, but NASA overruled this. The pure oxygen design was judged to be safer, less complicated, and lighter in weight.|$|E
500|$|After President John F. Kennedy {{was assassinated}} in , {{his family and friends}} {{discussed}} how to construct a library that would serve as a fitting memorial. A committee was formed to advise Kennedy's widow Jacqueline, who would make the final decision. The group deliberated for months and considered many famous architects. Eventually, Kennedy chose Pei to design the library, based on <b>two</b> <b>considerations.</b> First, she appreciated the variety of ideas he had used for earlier projects. [...] "He didn't seem to have just one way to solve a problem," [...] she said. [...] "He seemed to approach each commission thinking only of it and then develop a way to make something beautiful." [...] Ultimately, however, Kennedy made her choice based on her personal connection with Pei. Calling it [...] "really an emotional decision", she explained: [...] "He was so full of promise, like Jack; they were born in the same year. I decided {{it would be fun to}} take a great leap with him." ...|$|E

2500|$|As wages {{increase}} {{above the}} subsistence level (discussed below), there are <b>two</b> <b>considerations</b> affecting a worker's choice {{of how many}} hours to work per unit of time (usually day, week, or month). The first is the substitution or incentive effect. With wages rising, the tradeoff between working an additional hour for pay and taking one extra hour of unpaid time changes in favor of working. Thus, more hours of labour-time will be offered at the higher wage than the lower one. The second and countervailing effect is that the hours worked at the old wage rate now all gain more income than before, creating an income effect, which encourages more leisure to be chosen {{because it is more}} affordable. Most economists assume that unpaid time (or [...] "leisure") is a normal good and so people want more of it as their incomes (or wealth) rise. Since a rising wage rate raises incomes, all else constant, the attraction of unpaid time rises, eventually neutralising the substitution effect and causing the backward bend.|$|E

Some recent genomic studies on the genetic basis of traits associated with the domestication syndrome have shed light on both of these issues. [...] A study published in 2016 suggested that there have been negative genetic consequences of the domestication process as well, that enrichment of disease-related gene variants accompanied positively selected traits.|$|E
2500|$|On 11 July, Tschirschky {{reported}} to Jagow that he [...] "again took {{the occasion to}} discuss with Berchtold what action was to be taken against Serbia, chiefly in order to assure the minister once again, emphatically that speedy action was called for". On the same day, the German Foreign Office {{wanted to know if}} they should send a telegram congratulating King Peter of Serbia on his birthday. Wilhelm replied: [...] "As Vienna has so far inaugurated no action of any sort against Belgrade, the omission of the customary telegram would be too noticeable and might be the cause of premature uneasiness... It should be sent." [...] On 12 July, Szögyény reported from Berlin that everyone in the German government wanted to see Austria-Hungary declare war on Serbia at once, and were tired of Austrian indecision about whether to choose war or peace. He added that this:"absolute insistence on a war against Serbia was based on the <b>two</b> <b>considerations</b> already mentioned; firstly that Russia and France were 'not yet ready' and secondly that Britain will not at this juncture intervene in a war which breaks out over a Balkan state, even if this should lead to a conflict with Russia, possibly also France... Not only have Anglo-German relations so improved that Germany feels that she need no longer feel fear a directly hostile attitude by Britain, but above all, Britain at this moment is anything but anxious for war, and has no wish whatever to pull chestnuts out of the fire for Serbia, or in the last instance, Russia... In general, then, it appears from all this that the political constellation is as favourable for us as it could possibly be." ...|$|E
