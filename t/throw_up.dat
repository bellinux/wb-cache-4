5|$|Hoffman played shortstop collegiately at the University of Arizona and {{was drafted}} in the 11th round by the Cincinnati Reds. After not having much success batting, Hoffman was {{converted}} to a pitcher, as {{he was able to}} <b>throw</b> <b>up</b> to 95miles per hour (mph). The Marlins acquired him in the 1992 expansion draft, and he pitched in Florida until he was traded to the Padres mid-season in 1993 in a deal that sent star Gary Sheffield to the Marlins. Hoffman recorded 20 saves in 1994 in his first season as Padres closer, and in the following years, he became the face of the franchise after Tony Gwynn retired. He collected at least 30saves each year for the next 14years, except for 2003 when he missed most of the year recovering from shoulder surgery. After San Diego did not re-sign him following the 2008 season, Hoffman pitched for two years with the Brewers before retiring after the 2010 season.|$|E
5|$|The {{day before}} the match, Avram Grant {{predicted}} that the game would <b>throw</b> <b>up</b> few tactical surprises due to the two teams' knowledge of each other from the domestic league. Nevertheless, he decided to start with Florent Malouda on the left-wing instead of Salomon Kalou, and also chose to deploy Michael Essien at right-back, rather than in his preferred midfield position, ahead of Paulo Ferreira – who did not even make the bench despite starting both legs of the semi-final – and Juliano Belletti. The rest of Chelsea's team was as expected, with key players John Terry (dislocated elbow) and Didier Drogba (knee) recovering from injuries suffered against Bolton Wanderers {{on the last day}} of the league season 10 days earlier to start the game. Ashley Cole also started despite hurting his right ankle in training the {{day before the}} game under a heavy challenge from Claude Makélélé. His replacement would have likely been Wayne Bridge, but he recovered sufficiently that Bridge was not even included in the matchday squad as cover.|$|E

5|$|As Lois finds Chris and {{his friends}} {{watching}} a pornographic film, she becomes convinced a proper sex-ed class should be taught at his school. Since the sex-ed class at her children's school was removed, Lois decides to become the school's newest sex-ed teacher. In class, she attempts to teach students about safe sex, but her efforts are ruined by a botched attempt of Peter, who wishes to distribute his views on sex as well. Soon after the first sex-ed class, parental protests arise as Lois taught kids about safe ways to perform premarital sex, rather than abstinence. As a result, Lois is subsequently fired. She {{is replaced by a}} reverend who promotes both premarital and marital abstinence, explaining fictional consequences of intercourse with various questionable examples. The idea appeals to most students, including Meg, who starts a relationship with a fellow student named Doug. In a subplot, Stewie loses a tooth and is told about the tooth fairy. Frightened by the fairy tale, Stewie develops a plan to capture the fairy, not knowing she does not exist. He borrows Herbert's false teeth and provokes Brian's girlfriend Jillian to <b>throw</b> <b>up,</b> as she has bulimia nervosa, in order to collect her teeth as well. Brian, overseeing Stewie's increasing obsession with the fairy, reveals to Stewie that she does not exist, but another scene shows a man named T. Fairy, having an apparent tooth fetish, stealing teeth to roll around in them.|$|E
5|$|In June 2014, {{as part of}} {{the ongoing}} storyline with Bryan, McMahon {{threatened}} to fire his wife Brie Bella if Bryan did not relinquish the WWE World Heavyweight Championship, which forced Brie to quit before slapping McMahon in the face. On the June 16 episode of Raw, Roman Reigns spiked the coffee Vickie Guerrero gave to McMahon, causing Stephanie to <b>throw</b> <b>up</b> on Vickie and leave with Triple H to the hospital. Vickie later gave Reigns a chance in the battle royal, which he would win. On the June 23 episode of Raw, Vickie lost in a pudding match against McMahon with her job on the line, after interference by Alicia Fox, Layla and Rosa Mendes. Vickie ultimately lost the match and was fired, however she got her retribution over McMahon by throwing her into the mud pool. After Brie quit, McMahon put Brie's sister Nikki in several handicap matches as punishment. Brie returned to television on the July 21 episode of Raw, appearing in the crowd leading to confrontation between the two. McMahon was (kayfabe) arrested and charged with assault and battery, because she slapped Brie, who was not a (kayfabe) WWE employee The following week, McMahon granted Brie her job back and a match at SummerSlam against her in order to get Brie to drop the lawsuit. On the August 4 episode of Raw, after their contract signing, Stephanie pedigreed both twins. At SummerSlam, Nikki turned on Brie, allowing Stephanie to hit a pedigree on Brie having Stephanie win her first pay per view match in over 10 years.|$|E

Locating them in a large tent used as a saloon, Bull stepped inside with a double barrel shotgun, and demanded both men <b>throw</b> <b>up</b> their hands and surrender. Arnett immediately grabbed his pistol laying on the table beside him, at which point Bull shot him with one blast from his shotgun in the chest, killing him instantly. Jermagin surrendered, and he and Spillman were tried the next morning in a makeshift court. Jermagin was able to successfully argue that he played no part in the horse theft. However, Spillman was convicted and sentenced to hang. The next morning he was executed.|$|E
25|$|The French {{artillery}} train having arrived, Colonel James Grant {{proposed that}} the castle should be attacked from the classic direction of the town cemetery where the guns would be nearly level with the fortifications. However, Prince Charles was allegedly afraid that the return fire from the castle would wreck the town of Stirling and therefore opted for an alternative that was offered by the Franco-Scottish engineer Mirabelle de Gordon, who had arrived with Lord John Drummond. Mirablle de Gordon stated that an attack from the little Gowan Hill, which lay hard under the north-eastern side of the castle, which would be totally dominated by whatever cannon the besiegers might choose to fire against it. The bedrock at this location however, was only 15 inches below the surface {{making it difficult for}} the besiegers to <b>throw</b> <b>up</b> effective cover, and the ramparts of the castle on this side were {{at the top of a}} near vertical cliff which would make it impossible even for the agile Highlanders to scale. The Prince accepted Mirabelle de Gordon’s advice and in doing so is probably the tactical mistake that can be most firmly pinned on him.|$|E

In their forty years of practice after leaving medical school, doctors hear about what works through ad hoc oral traditions, from sales reps, colleagues or journals. But those colleagues can be in the pay of drug companies – often undisclosed – and the journals are too. And so are the patient groups. And finally, academic papers, which everyone thinks of as objective, are often covertly planned and written by people who work directly for the companies, without disclosure.|$|E

25|$|The Austrian {{high command}} {{was well aware}} of the French {{preparations}} on Lobau island and thus understood that the French attack would come from there. Archduke Charles was however unsure about where the French would cross and, together with his staff reckoned that the crossing would most likely be made from the north of the island, making landfall roughly at the same location as at the Battle of Aspern-Essling. Working on this hypothesis, Charles had a chain of 16 defensive redoubts built, essentially between Aspern and Groß-Enzersdorf. Strangely, he did not extend the earthworks southeast, along the riverline, which meant that the line could be outflanked. Moreover, the redoubts did not provide all-round protection and an Austrian observer noted that only Turks would <b>throw</b> <b>up</b> such poor earthworks. Charles's belief that Napoleon would cross north of Lobau seemed to be confirmed on 2 July, when he received news that French forces began to cross the river there. The Austrian commander thought that the battle scenario he had prepared for – a repetition of the battle fought at the end of May – was about to materialise, so he promptly moved his entire force to face the enemy. However, it soon became obvious that the French force was only a small detachment, sent forward to secure a bridgehead.|$|E
25|$|In late 1938, the Bf 109E entered production. To {{improve on}} the {{performance}} afforded by the 441–515kW (600–700PS) Jumo 210, the larger, longer Daimler-Benz DB 601A engine was used, yielding an extra 223kW (300PS) {{at the cost of}} an additional 181kg (400lb). A much bigger cooling area was needed to disperse the extra heat generated by the DB 601 and this led to the first major redesign of the basic airframe. Enlarging the existing nose mounted radiator sufficiently to cool the engine would have created extra weight and drag, negating some of the performance gains afforded by the increased power, so it was decided to move the main radiators to beneath the wings' undersurfaces immediately outboard of the juncture between the wing root and wing panel, just forward of the trailing edges' inner ends, leaving the oil cooler under the nose in a small, streamlined duct. The new radiator position also had the effect of counterbalancing the extra weight and length of the DB 601, which drove a heavier three-bladed Vereinigte Deutsche Metallwerke (VDM)-made propeller. To incorporate the new radiators, the wings were almost completely redesigned and reinforced, with several inboard ribs behind the spar being cut down {{to make room for the}} radiator ducting. Because the radiators were now mounted near the trailing edge of the wing, coinciding with the increased speed of the airflow accelerating around the wing's camber, the overall cooling installation was more efficient than that of the Jumo engined 109s, albeit at the cost of extra ducting and piping, which could be vulnerable to battle damage. In addition, the lowered undercarriage could <b>throw</b> <b>up</b> mud and debris on wet airfields, potentially clogging the radiators.|$|E
500|$|The {{morning after}} having drunk extensively, Homer and Ned are seen sleeping, clothed, in a Jacuzzi. The staff {{discussed}} {{whether or not}} the two should wake up naked or clothed; series creator Matt Groening, for example, wanted them to wake up naked, since it would [...] "raise some questions". During production, Affleck had drawn an alternate version of the scene, which would be based on his [...] "extensive experience in the field of alcohol abuse" [...] in his younger years. The scene would be in Ned's point of view, and would show Homer's open mouth half submerged in the Jacuzzi. Affleck described the alternate scene as being [...] "a little bit Fellini-esque" [...] and therefore did not fit with The Simpsons style. Scully had also suggested that Ned would <b>throw</b> <b>up</b> on screen {{at the end of the}} scene, however the idea never came to fruition.|$|E

500|$|There was no {{time for}} evasive action, and three of the four torpedoes struck {{amidships}} so closely together as to <b>throw</b> <b>up</b> a single massive water column. Barham quickly capsized to port and was lying on her side when a massive magazine explosion occurred aft about four minutes after she was torpedoed and sank her. The Court of Enquiry into the sinking ascribed the final magazine explosion to a fire in the 4-inch magazines outboard of the main 15-inch magazines, which would have then spread to and detonated the contents of the main magazines. Due to the speed at which she sank, 862 officers and ratings were killed, including two who died of their wounds after being rescued. The destroyer [...] rescued some 337 survivors, including Vice-Admiral Henry Pridham-Wippell and the pair who later died of their wounds, while the Australian destroyer [...] reportedly rescued some 150 men. The sinking was captured on film by a cameraman from Pathé News, aboard Valiant.|$|E
500|$|In {{preparation}} for the role, Kensit spent three days shadowing a real nurse, and observed open heart surgery being performed as research.
