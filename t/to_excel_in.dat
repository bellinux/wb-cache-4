Trescothick averaged 31.60 across 10 matches in the VB Series, but England were outplayed by Australia throughout the tour.

5|$|Like {{traditional}} role-playing games, Kingdom Hearts {{features an}} experience point system that determines character development. As enemies are defeated, the player characters gain experience and grow stronger, {{gaining access to}} new abilities. Unlike other games of its type, Kingdom Hearts allows a degree of character development customization through a short tutorial found {{at the beginning of}} the game. The tutorial allows the player to select from one of three main attributes―strength, defense, or magic―for Sora <b>to</b> <b>excel</b> <b>in</b> and one to lack in. By choosing certain options, the player may manipulate how Sora learns abilities, grows statistically, and gains levels. Donald, Goofy, and any other additional party members are assigned specific areas of strength from the outset. Donald excels in magic, while Goofy excels in defense and special attacks.|$|E

5|$|McCudden's {{long-term}} interest in mechanics {{prompted him to}} modify his own aircraft to increase combat performance. He {{made a series of}} modifications to his aircraft which caused them <b>to</b> <b>excel</b> <b>in</b> performance in comparison to any other S.E.5 at the front and perhaps any other German fighter available at the time. Performance, a generic term, required improvements in all-round capability. McCudden's changes were made with one main objective in mind: high-altitude performance. He had achieved some success without these personal experiments. On 23 December 1917, for example, he intercepted an enemy aircraft at 18,000 feet and drove it down to 8,000 feet before shooting it down for his 30th victory. Incidentally, he was nearly killed in action when one of the wings broke away from his victim and nearly struck his own aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Over time, Vrataski trains Cage <b>to</b> <b>excel</b> <b>in</b> combat training. Frustrated by his {{continued}} failures to excel, he retreats to London to spare his own life, but discovers that the Mimics will attack there after defeating the UDF in France. Eventually receiving {{a vision of}} a dam in Germany, indicating that the Omega is hiding there, Cage and Vrataski spend many loops figuring out how to escape the invasion and reach the dam. Cage comes to know Vrataski and falls in love with her, but Vrataski, who lost a loved one to the Mimics, is only interested in the mission. Upon reaching a point where she is killed whatever they do, Cage decides to fly to the dam on his own. Inside the dam, he is ambushed by an Alpha and Mimic struggling to bleed him out and strip off his ability to reset time. Before they can slowly bleed him to death, Cage deliberately drowns himself to avoid the process.|$|E
5|$|While Roberts had {{a natural}} talent for riding {{motorcycles}} on dirt surfaces, on paved road circuits, the motorcycle felt unsettled beneath him while negotiating a turn. During a race at the Ontario Motor Speedway, he observed Finnish rider Jarno Saarinen using a riding style where {{he shifted his}} body weight towards {{the inside of a}} turn. Roberts tried the technique and found that it helped settle the motorcycle. He adopted the cornering style and exaggerated the body shift {{to a greater extent than}} Saarinen had by extending his knee out until it skimmed the track surface. With his new riding technique, Roberts began <b>to</b> <b>excel</b> <b>in</b> road race events. Yamaha motorcycles performed very well in road racing, where the Yamaha TZ750 was the dominant motorcycle of the era.|$|E

5|$|Agile, quick, creative, and powerful, Balotelli is {{credited}} with pace, flair, physical strength, technical ability, and an eye for goal; his height, elevation and physique allow him <b>to</b> <b>excel</b> <b>in</b> the air, and {{he is capable of}} scoring with his head or with either foot, from both inside or outside the area. Although he normally plays in a central role as a main striker, he is a versatile forward, who is capable of playing anywhere along the front line, and has also been deployed as a winger or as a second striker. Despite his talent, however, he has been criticized by managers, teammates, and the media for a perceived poor and immature attitude at times, as well as his for his poor movement and work-rate, inconsistency, mentality, and volatile temperament and arrogant behaviour on the pitch, which has often led him to pick up unnecessary bookings throughout his career. Balotelli has also been accused of diving, and is thus regarded by teammates and the media as a promising but undisciplined player. Due to his powerful shot, Balotelli is also a set-piece specialist, and is {{regarded as one of the}} best penalty kick takers in world football, a view backed by his former Manchester City goalkeeping teammate Joe Hart. Balotelli missed his first competitive penalty against Napoli on 22 September 2013 when it was saved by Pepe Reina; the first time in 22 attempts as a professional.|$|E
25|$|The Singapore Sports School is for {{students}} who are perceived by the school <b>to</b> <b>excel</b> <b>in</b> sports it offers. This includes swimming, badminton, table tennis, soccer, golf, track and field, and sailing. It was opened in January 2004 and the school takes students directly into the school provided they have an active background in the sports offered by the school. When the school had its first intake, many students applied who were judged <b>to</b> <b>excel</b> <b>in</b> their sport but were posted to the Normal (Academic) or Normal (Technical) streams. The school rejected these pupils as the school sought pupils who excelled both physically and academically. The school was criticised for being too result wise instead of grooming them into future sportspeople. Some of the students were finally accepted on an appeal basis after that. Students in the school aim for the International Baccalaureate (IB) paper, similar to the Singapore Arts School.|$|E

25|$|In {{response}} to such concerns the Ministry of Education has recently discussed a greater focus on creative and critical thinking, and on learning for lifelong skills rather than simply teaching students <b>to</b> <b>excel</b> <b>in</b> examinations.

25|$|During the 1860s, Patti {{possessed a}} sweet, high-lying voice of birdlike purity and {{remarkable}} flexibility which was ideal for such parts as Zerlina, Lucia and Amina; but, as Verdi noted in 1878, her lower notes gained fullness and beauty when she grew older, enabling her <b>to</b> <b>excel</b> <b>in</b> weightier fare. Patti, however, {{turned into a}} conservative singer in {{the final phase of}} her operatic and concert career. She knew what suited her aging voice to perfection and she stuck to it. Typically, her recital programs during the 1890s featured an array of familiar, often sentimental, not-too-demanding popular tunes of the day, which were sure to appeal to her adoring fans.|$|E
25|$|In addition, {{top-level}} stars had no motivation <b>to</b> <b>excel</b> <b>in</b> {{the ring}} {{due to their}} long-term contracts. WCW did not promote its younger stars to the company's top slots (a charge admitted by Bischoff). Despite having talented younger wrestlers like Chris Jericho, Chris Benoit, Dean Malenko, Billy Kidman, Chavo Guerrero, Jr., Eddie Guerrero, Perry Saturn, Raven, Booker T., and Rey Mysterio, Jr. on its roster, they were kept away from the main event scene. Of these wrestlers listed, five {{would go on to}} headline main events in WWF/E and become World Champions (Both Eddie Guerrero and Booker T have also since been inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame for their in-ring achievements), something WCW bookers believed these men {{would never be able to}} sell as.|$|E
25|$|Katō {{reportedly}} did not {{get along}} well with his parents, and seldom returned home. An interview with Katō's brother revealed that his parents had put immense pressure on both of them to perform and <b>to</b> <b>excel</b> <b>in</b> their studies, ordering them to redo their homework to high standards in order to impress teachers in school, and recalled one incident when Katō was made to eat scraps of food from the floor. Another neighbour described Katō being punished by his parents, who made him stand outside for hours in deep, cold snow during winter. Previous online postings before his announcement of the attack contained sharp criticisms of his own upbringing. Deeply in debt and believing that his family {{had given up on}} him, Katō unsuccessfully attempted suicide in 2006 by ramming his car into a wall.|$|E
