5|$|Each {{chromatophore}} contains pigment of {{only one}} colour. In fish and frogs, colour change is mediated {{by the type of}} chromatophores known as melanophores that contain dark pigment. A melanophore is star-shaped; it contains many small pigmented organelles which can be dispersed throughout the cell, or aggregated near its centre. When the pigmented organelles are dispersed, the cell makes a patch of the animal's skin appear dark; when they are aggregated, most of the cell, and the animal's skin, appears light. In frogs, <b>the</b> <b>change</b> <b>is</b> controlled relatively slowly, mainly by hormones. In fish, <b>the</b> <b>change</b> <b>is</b> controlled by the brain, which sends signals directly to the chromatophores, as well as producing hormones.|$|E
5|$|The sexes of {{each species}} {{are similar in}} appearance, {{although}} the females are slightly smaller and duller than the males, with a less contrasting head pattern. Juveniles of both species are duller than the adults, and browner underneath. Adults undergo a complete moult after breeding. No subspecies have been recognised of either Crex crake. Although corn crakes become paler and greyer towards {{the east of the}} range, <b>the</b> <b>change</b> <b>is</b> clinal, and there is great individual variation in colour within all populations.|$|E
5|$|The {{station has}} three ticket halls: {{one for the}} Circle and District lines above the {{platforms}} of the sub-surface station, one below ground for the Bakerloo line station and one under the mainline station. The sub-surface station and the deep-level station ticket halls are linked via the ticket hall under the mainline station, but not to each other directly. Entrances are on Praed Street and from within the mainline station. On the tube map the station is shown jointly with the other separate Underground station and passenger usage data for both is combined. Interchange with the other station is through the mainline station concourse without extra charge if <b>the</b> <b>change</b> <b>is</b> made within the permitted time.|$|E

40|$|An {{increasing}} {{volume of}} experienced trading tends to reduce autocorrelation {{and make the}} market more efficient. Autocorrelation in daily returns changes over time and <b>the</b> <b>changes</b> <b>were</b> less frequent than would <b>be</b> expected if <b>the</b> <b>changes</b> <b>were</b> random, but <b>the</b> <b>changes</b> <b>are</b> random recently. Autocorrelation has a negative connection with rate of return. The relation between autocorrelation and trading volume is positive and nonlinear. ...|$|R

5|$|Unveiled in 1989, the new {{lighting}} arrangement {{required the}} removal of the contour-outlining light bulbs and the installation of 176floodlights in and around the tower's frame. From dusk to midnight, the floodlights illuminate the entire tower. Sodium vapor lamps are used from 2 October to 6 July to cover the tower in an orange color. From 7 July to 1 October, the lights are changed to metal halide lamps to illuminate the tower with a white color. The reasoning behind <b>the</b> <b>change</b> <b>is</b> a seasonal one. Ishii reasoned that orange is a warmer color and helps to offset the cold winter months. Conversely, white is thought a cool color that helps during the hot summer months.|$|E
5|$|Many {{species of}} Pokémon {{are capable of}} {{evolving}} into a larger and more powerful creature. <b>The</b> <b>change</b> <b>is</b> accompanied by stat changes, generally a modest increase, and access to {{a wider variety of}} attacks. There are multiple ways to trigger an evolution including reaching a particular level, using a special stone, or learning a specific attack. For example, at level 16 Bulbasaur is capable of evolving into Ivysaur. Most notably, the Normal-type Eevee is capable of evolving into eight different Pokémon: Jolteon (Electric), Flareon (Fire), Vaporeon (Water), Umbreon (Dark), Espeon (Psychic), Leafeon (Grass), Glaceon (Ice), and Sylveon (Fairy). In Generation VI, a new mechanic called Mega Evolution—as well as a subset of Mega Evolution called Primal Reversion—was introduced into the game. Unlike normal evolution, Mega Evolution and Primal Reversion last only for the duration of a battle, with the Pokémon reverting to its normal form at the end. Forty-eight Pokémon are capable of undergoing Mega Evolution or Primal Reversion as of the release of Sun and Moon. In contrast, some species such as Castform, Rotom, Unown, and Lycanroc undergo form changes that may provide stat buffs or changes and type alterations but are not considered new species.|$|E

50|$|Documented: All <b>changes</b> must <b>be</b> documented. <b>The</b> {{documentation}} {{includes the}} initial request for <b>change,</b> its approval, <b>the</b> priority assigned to it, the implementation, testing and back out plans, {{the results of}} <b>the</b> <b>change</b> review board critique, <b>the</b> date/time <b>the</b> <b>change</b> <b>was</b> implemented, who implemented it, and whether <b>the</b> <b>change</b> <b>was</b> implemented successfully, failed or postponed.|$|R
50|$|The PowerShell Registry {{provider}} supports transactions, i.e. multiple <b>changes</b> to <b>the</b> Registry can be bundled into {{a single}} atomic transaction. An atomic transaction ensures that either all of <b>the</b> <b>changes</b> <b>are</b> committed to <b>the</b> database, or if the script fails, none of <b>the</b> <b>changes</b> <b>is</b> committed to <b>the</b> database.|$|R

25|$|In {{his later}} works (after 1900) May left the {{adventure}} fiction genre to write symbolic novels with religious and pacifistic content. <b>The</b> <b>change</b> <b>is</b> best shown in Im Reiche des silbernen Löwen {{where the first}} two parts are adventurous and the last two parts belong to the mature work.|$|E
25|$|On 8 April 2008, Els officially {{announced}} that he was switching swing coaches from David Leadbetter (whom Els had worked with since 1990) to noted swing coach Butch Harmon.

25|$|Whatever {{the reason}} for his departure, Kempe was {{replaced}} by Robert Armin, formerly of Chandos's Men and an author in his own right. Small and fanciful, Armin offered significantly different options for Shakespeare, and <b>the</b> <b>change</b> <b>is</b> seen in the last Elizabethan and first Jacobean plays. Armin is generally credited with originating such characters as Feste in Twelfth Night, Touchstone in As You Like It, and the fool in King Lear.|$|E
25|$|By 2013, all of {{the former}} Continental fleet, {{excluding}} the Boeing 737-500 and Boeing 767-200ER (which were sold, primarily to Russian operators) were repainted in the new United livery, except for the one Boeing 737-900ER in the Continental Blue Skyway retro livery (N75436). United repainted this aircraft to the standard Globe livery in May 2016, and then painted a different airframe in the Blue Skyway, sister ship N75435. The reason for <b>the</b> <b>change</b> <b>is</b> currently unknown.|$|E
25|$|In 2014, Washington Township {{residents}} {{petitioned the}} state to permit it to leave the Dover Area School District to join the Northern York County School District. The petitioners cited the superior education outcomes and lower property taxes in Northern County School District as motives for the change request.

50|$|Consider a {{transaction}} that transfers 10 from A to B. First it removes 10 from A, then it adds 10 to B. At this point, the user is told the transaction was a success, however <b>the</b> <b>changes</b> <b>are</b> still queued in the disk buffer {{waiting to be}} committed to disk. Power fails and <b>the</b> <b>changes</b> <b>are</b> lost. <b>The</b> user assumes (understandably) that <b>the</b> <b>changes</b> persist.|$|R
25|$|In its 2008 plan, POAL {{proposed}} {{to extend the}} Fergusson and Bledisloe terminals into one large area mainly intended for container handling. <b>The</b> <b>change</b> <b>is</b> to increase the port's capacity by 250%, and allow ships with up to 7,000 containers to use its facilities, where the current limit is about 4,000. The extension would include the purchase of even larger cranes, topping out at 94m, while containers on the wharf may be stacked as high as six-storey buildings.|$|E
25|$|Lewis B. Puller was {{commissioned}} on 17 August 2017 at Khalifa bin Salman Port in Al Hidd, Bahrain, with its prefix changing from USNS to USS and its hull designation changing from T-ESB-3 to ESB-3, the ship {{became the first}} U.S. ship that {{was commissioned}} outside the United States. <b>The</b> <b>change</b> <b>is</b> {{due to the fact}} that certain missions, such as mine-countermeasures and special operations staging, must be performed by a warship under the laws of armed conflict.|$|E
25|$|A person's natural {{skin color}} affects their {{reaction}} to exposure to the sun. Generally, those who start out with darker skin color and more melanin have better abilities to tan. Individuals with very light skin and albinos have no ability to tan. The biggest differences resulting from sun exposure are visible in individuals who start out with moderately pigmented brown skin: <b>the</b> <b>change</b> <b>is</b> dramatically visible as tan lines, where parts of the skin which tanned are delineated from unexposed skin.|$|E
