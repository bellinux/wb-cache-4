However, <b>the</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> that Garuda is the Sankarshna form of the lord who during {{creation}} primarily possesses the knowledge aspect of the lord (among Vasudeva, Sankarshana, Pradyumna and Aniruddha forms). The {{important point is that}} Garuda represents the five vayus within us : prana, apana, vyana, udana, samana through his five forms Satya, Suparna, Garuda, Tarkshya, Vihageshwara. These five vayus through yoga can be controlled through Pranayama which can lead to Kundalini awakening leading to higher levels of consciousness.|$|E
500|$|While widely {{considered}} to be a pop punk band, Fall Out Boy has also been described as pop rock emo, and emo pop, and cites emo group The Get Up Kids as an influence among many other bands. When interviewed for a retrospective article in Alternative Press at the time The Get Up Kids disbanded in 2005, Pete Wentz stated that [...] "Fall Out Boy would not be a band {{if it were not for}} The Get Up Kids." [...] Early in the band's career, when Jared Logan was producing the group's debut album, he asked bassist Pete Wentz what sound the band desired for recording. Wentz responded by [...] "handing over the first two New Found Glory records". Wentz also cites Green Day, the Ramones, Screeching Weasel, Metallica, Earth Crisis, Gorilla Biscuits and Lifetime as influences. The band acknowledges its hardcore punk roots as an influence; all four members were involved in the Chicago hardcore scene before joining Fall Out Boy. Wentz described the band's affiliation with the genre by saying [...] "I think <b>the</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> that we are all hardcore kids that are writing pop music...It gives us a different style because at our core we are always hardcore. That aspect is always going to be evident in the music. We are hardcore kids that couldn't quite cut it as hardcore kids." [...] He referred to Fall Out Boy's genre as [...] "softcore": hardcore punk mixed with pop sensibility. Lead singer Patrick Stump, however, is also influenced by artists he listened to while growing up including Prince, Michael Jackson, and David Bowie.|$|E
6000|$|Now {{it is an}} irritating and pathetic {{thing that}} the three most popular phrases about Shaw are false. Modern criticism, like all weak things, is {{overloaded}} with words. In a healthy condition of language a man finds {{it very difficult to}} say the right thing, but at last says it. In this empire of journalese a man finds it so very easy to say the wrong thing that he never thinks of saying anything else. False or meaningless phrases lie so ready to his hand that it is easier to use them than not to use them. These wrong terms picked up through idleness are retained through habit, and so the man has begun to think wrong almost before he has begun to think at all. Such lumbering logomachy is always injurious and oppressive to men of spirit, imagination or intellectual honour, and it has dealt very recklessly and wrongly with Bernard Shaw. He has contrived to get about three newspaper phrases tied to his tail; and those newspaper phrases are all and separately wrong. The three superstitions about him, it will be conceded, are generally these: first that he desires [...] "problem plays," [...] second that he is [...] "paradoxical," [...] and third that in his dramas as elsewhere he is specially [...] "a Socialist." [...] And <b>the</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> that when we come to his philosophy, all these three phrases are quite peculiarly inapplicable.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>thing...</b> <b>was</b> {{that we had}} to get the {{permission}} of Aaron Copland, the composer. The publishing house said forget it. So I got Mr Coplands home number, called him up and he was very friendly on the phone. And he says [...] "Send it to me, let me listen." [...] And he loved it. He called me and said [...] "This is brilliant, this is fantastic. This is doing something to my music." ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{songs that}} you write when you're young {{are just a}} part of you—they stay with you. <b>The</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> how far I kind of strayed from the {{original}} versions over the years—I mean acoustically and everything. So, coming back and stripping them down and trying to revisit them in a kind of honest, genuine fashion was actually—even for an old cynic like me—it turned to be a very moving thing ... It anniversary tour was a very moving experience. It was like we were all revisiting out teenage years together, and it was nostalgic, but in a nice, happy, positive way.|$|R

50|$|Palm {{produce is}} about the main export and it sustains many households. <b>The</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> that these palms trees up till now grow wild. There has been no attempt by locals to turn what is natural into {{organised}} plantations. The government too {{has done nothing to}} encourage local or foreign investors in this area.|$|E
50|$|Itigelov's {{story was}} not {{forgotten}} {{over the years}} and on September 11, 2002 the body was finally exhumed and transferred to Ivolginsky Datsan where it was closely examined by monks and by scientists and pathologists. The official statement was issued about the body - very well preserved, without any signs of decay, whole muscles and inner tissue, soft joints and skin. <b>The</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> that the body was never embalmed or mummified.|$|E

500|$|Darren Aronofsky and {{his friend}} Ari Handel created the story for The Fountain, and Aronofsky wrote the screenplay. When Aronofsky saw The Matrix in 1999, he {{considered}} it a film that redefined the science fiction genre. He sought to make a science fiction film that would explore new territory in the genre like The Matrix and its predecessors Star Wars and [...] Aronofsky had in mind a science fiction film that would go beyond the other films whose plots were driven by technology and science. The director said, [...] "We've seen it all. It's not really interesting to audiences anymore. <b>The</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> ideas; the search for God, the search for meaning." ...|$|R

He also stated that the film will not reflect trends in the superhero genre since the first film's release, explaining, [...] "I don't {{think that kind of}} idea stays interesting for very long. For me, <b>the</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> never <b>the</b> superhero part of it. It was more the family dynamic, and how do superhero things play into that." [...] In August 2015, the sequel's logo was revealed at D23 Expo. In September 2015, Bird revealed his intentions to include in the second film some unused ideas that [...] "didn't fit" [...] in the first film.

50|$|There are {{a number}} of {{sedation}} drugs, which can be taken by mouth. They have been developed specifically for the purpose of conscious sedation in dentistry. Sleep dentistry is a common term once used to describe a visit to the dentist. <b>The</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> that though it was referred to as sleep dentistry, the patient never actually went to sleep during the visit. Sleep dentistry should really be applied to dentistry which uses the aid of general anesthesia. The dentist will determine which medication is best used during sedation.|$|E

In May Starr stepped down {{as president of the}} charity but denied it {{had anything to do with}} the investigation. On June 8, she resigned as chair of Ontario Place. On June 12, Attorney-General Ian Scott announced that the OPP and a special prosecutor would look into the allegations. On June 22, Gordon Ashworth announced his resignation as he admitted to receiving a free refrigerator and a new paint job for his house. Ian Scott said, [...] "I don't know whether Ashworth received a refrigerator, but assuming he did, <b>the</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> number of people that thought I got a fridge, if not better." ...|$|R
5000|$|Segregation {{meant that}} Serbian and Albanian {{students}} {{would not be}} found in the schools at the same time. This was implemented in order to Serbian students in general to go to school in the mornings and Albanian ones at the afternoons. The announcement for separation occurred just before the appearance of the disease and along with this came the suspicion that the separation was done on purpose by Serbians to prepare for poisoning. The [...] "reform" [...] had not been expanded everywhere, when the poisoning began. <b>The</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> absence of Serbian students that particular day. The segregation was classified as an attempt to form a kind of an apartheid society in Kosovo. In this case it was accomplished despite poisoning.|$|R

5000|$|In {{terms of}} popular culture, {{the line from}} Moore's 'Paradise and the Peri, 'one morn, a Peri, at the Gate of Eden stood, disconsolate' is quoted in the Doctor Who {{adventure}} The Twin Dilemma, when the lead character of the series, the Doctor, having seemingly gone mad after a violent regeneration into a new persona, compares his travelling companion Peri Brown to a Peri. The Doctor goes {{on to explain that}} [...] "a Peri is a good and beautiful fairy in Persian mythology. <b>The</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is,</b> before it became good, it was evil...", and incorrectly concludes that she is a malevolent alien spy.|$|E

I think also it’s kind of a testament to her influence as kind of inspiration for new generations of designers,” observed Alexander Fury of The Independent, “She said when she relaunched the label in the 90’s that she was dressing women and they were having the same reaction as the women had in the 70’s. And I think now it’s kind of the granddaughters of the people that she originally dressed are wearing the same dresses and looking good in those dresses. And that’s really kind of an amazing fashion legacy to have.” ...|$|E
50|$|The Third Amanda's {{support for}} Hal Mayne {{is part of}} another trilogy of {{characters}} that combine the three parts of humanity as Gordon R. Dickson envisions. She is the strength, the courage, and the competence that compliments the other two muses in his life. Rukh Tamani, who embodies Faith, and Ajela who embodies Understanding being these other two components based on the Childe Cycle splinter cultures. <b>The</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> {{that each of these}} three characters embodies all three of the important philosophies: Courage, Faith, Understanding. The only difference is their emphasis of one over the other two. The Third Amanda certainly possesses both Faith and Understanding, but it is her Courage and Personal Responsibility that are paramount to her character.|$|E
5000|$|The Guardian newspaper's {{television}} reviewer Sam Wollaston {{also gave}} the episode a guarded welcome, although {{he felt that}} the attempts to make Cardiff appear glamorous were a failure. [...] "They've done their best to sex the place up—lots of helicopter shots of that posh bit where Charlotte Church lives, but it still looks like Cardiff, to be honest. No matter—most of <b>the</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> going on below the ground... It's not yet clear whether Eve Myles as new Torchwood recruit PC Gwen Cooper can fill Billie Piper's boots. Surely not—those boots are two gaping weekend voids that no one can fill. But this looks promising: it's slick, quick and a tiny bit scary. Not much humour yet, which <b>was</b> the lovely <b>thing</b> about Doctor Who. But it's early days; don't jump quite yet." ...|$|R

50|$|Chanson themes {{vary greatly}} {{depending}} on the time in which the songs were written and the places {{in which they are}} set. For example, songs set in the Odessa of the 1910s tend to be more cheerful, and are sharply contrasted by the dark, depressing, and violent songs set in the Stalinist era. <b>The</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> that it is common for a Chanson artist, regardless of the time in which he writes his songs, to include songs of all periods in his repertoire, and write songs set in an era different from his own. This often leads to confusion: for example, the bard Alexander Gorodnitsky reports being beaten up once after claiming authorship to one of his songs, which was attributed to a Gulag inmate living over 30 years earlier.|$|E
5000|$|In {{regard to}} the album's sound and genre, Church {{emphasized}} {{that he does not}} define his music by genre, calling it an [...] "outdated concept." [...] He goes further to say [...] "I think <b>the</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> that there still are a bunch of stigmas about what this is or what that is. But I think the stigmas go away in the next 10 years, if they're not already going away now. I don't know what that means, I really don't." [...] According to CMT, Church goes further to say [...] "I think genres are dead. There's good music. There's bad music. And I think the cool thing about Nashville is it is at the epicenter of that kind of thinking. I'm a country music artist in Nashville, but Nashville is way, way, way bigger than country music." ...|$|E
5000|$|Thankamany(തങ്കമണി [...] ) is {{a village}} at Idukki district, in Kerala state, India. There {{is a small}} town {{associated}} with this village. In regional language thankamany is a name of a lady. It is a belief that an older jungle king gave dowry as land for his three daughters Thankamany, Kamashi, and Neeli. The place got for Thankamany is now known as Thankamany (place name), other nearby places are also known as Kamashi and Neelivayal (means land of Neeli). Thankamany town is located in a valley of three small hills Thamprankunnu, Kattadikavala and Kurishupara respectively. One of <b>the</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> that, even though Kamashi is a different place, the panchayath of thankamany is called Kamashy panchayath and the office is situated in the middle of thankamany town.Sometimes in official documents thankamany is also written as thankamani.|$|E

50|$|People started {{listening}} to his chantings and philosophical poems and with due respect, called him 'Sri Madvirat Pothuluri Veera Brahmendra Swami'. Thousands of people gathered to hear his famous 'Kalagnanam'(Over 14000 Prophecy's). He predicted that amrutam will come out from bark of a tree which took place near Markolpalli for 3 days from trees bark and <b>the</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> no human could touch it or drink it. The moment someone placed their hands amrutam would disappear or stop coming out. It is credited that he predicted Ramakrishna Hegde, M.G.R and NTR to rule in democracy. He predicted the Kurnool floods. According to his followers, almost 90 percent of his predictions came true. The much publicised Yaganti Basavaiah to live and shout aloud is yet to happen. There are many stories in Andhra Pradesh about his life, but {{very few of them}} are backed with historical evidence.|$|E
5000|$|According to Hugh Nibley, {{the proverbial}} {{ancestor}} of the Arabs is Ishmael. His name {{is one of}} the few Old Testament names which is also at home in ancient Arabia: [...] "Thus in Lehi's friend [...] "Ishmael" [...] (1 Nephi 7:2) we surely have a man of the desert. <b>The</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> that Nephi takes Ishmael (unlike Zoram) completely for granted, never explaining who he is or how he fits into the picture--the act of sending for him seems to be the most natural thing in the world, as does the marriage of his daughters with Lehi's sons. Since it has ever been the custom among the desert people for a man to marry the daughter of his paternal uncle (bint 'ammi), it is hard to avoid the impression that Lehi and Ishmael were related. There is a remarkable association between the names of Lehi and Ishmael which ties them both to the southern desert, where the legendary birthplace and central shrine of Ishmael was at a place called Be'er Lehai-ro'i." ...|$|E
40|$|Before I begin, let's make {{something}} perfectly clear: I am a fish-nerd (i. e., an ichthyologist). For {{the purposes of}} this commentary, that means two things. First, it means that I {{have spent a lot of}} time underwater. Second, although I am I biologist and understand quite a bit about animal physiology, I am not an expert in decompression physiology. Keep these two things in mind when you read what I have to say. Back before the concept of "technical diving " existed, I used to do more dives to depths of 180 - 220 fsw than I care to remember. Because of the tremendous sample size of dives, I eventually began to notice a few patterns. Quite frequently after these dives, I would feel some level of fatigue or malaise. It was clear that these post-dive symptoms had more to do with inert-gas loading than with physical exertion or thermal exposure, because the symptoms would generally be much more severe after spending less than an hour in the water for a 200 -foot dive than they would after spending 4 to 6 hours at much shallower depths. <b>The</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> that these symptoms were not terribly consistent...|$|R
