25|$|Participants in {{the ritual}} may dip {{themselves}} three times under the water, honoring the Holy Trinity, to symbolically wash away their sins from <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>year,</b> <b>and</b> to experience a sense of spiritual rebirth.

The water is then distributed to attendees who may store it to use in times of illness, to bless themselves, family members, and their homes, or to drink. Some Russians think any water – even from the taps on the kitchen sink – poured or bottled on Epiphany becomes holy water, since all the water in the world is blessed this day. In the more mild climate of the southern city of Sochi meanwhile, where air and water temperatures both hover in the low to mid 10 degree Celsius range (50 degrees Fahrenheit) in January, thousands of people jump into the Black Sea at midnight each year on Epiphany and begin to swim in celebration of the feast.|$|E
