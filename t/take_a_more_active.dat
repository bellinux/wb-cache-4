5|$|The ACLU took no {{official}} position on president Franklin Delano Roosevelt's 1937 court-packing plan, which threatened {{to increase the}} number of Supreme Court justices, unless the Supreme Court reversed its course and began approving New Deal legislation. The Supreme Court responded by making a major shift in policy, and no longer applied strict constitutional limits to government programs, and also began to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>active</b> role in protecting civil liberties.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge and Minnesota Territory's Henry Mower Rice {{were among}} the speculators who {{invested}} in land near present-day Superior, Wisconsin. Rice disliked Minnesota's territorial governor, Willis A. Gorman, and petitioned Pierce to replace him with Breckinridge. Pierce twice investigated Gorman, but found no grounds to remove him from office. Breckinridge fell ill when traveling to view his investments in mid-1855 {{and was unable to}} campaign in the state elections. Know Nothings captured every state office and six congressional districts—including the Eighth District—and Breckinridge sent regrets to friends in Washington, D.C., promising to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>active</b> role in the 1856 campaigns.|$|E
5|$|Susanto Pudjomartono, {{former chief}} editor of Tempo, became The Jakarta Post second chief editor on 1 August 1991, after Siagian {{was chosen to}} be Indonesia's {{ambassador}} to Australia. Under Pudjomartono's leadership, the paper began publishing more original work and doing less translation; reporters {{were also asked to}} <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>active</b> role in the day-to-day operations of the paper. The paper also became more vocal regarding politics, taking a pro-democracy stance like Tempo. It soon converted its offices into a new, two-story building built using the Kompas pension fund and expanded to 12 pages.|$|E

5|$|The post-war years {{also saw}} the News-Miner <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>active</b> role in {{territorial}} politics. Prior to the 1948 election, Lathrop believed Republican presidential candidate Thomas Dewey would handily defeat Democratic incumbent Harry Truman. To {{take advantage of the}} anticipated governmental shift, Lathrop instructed the News-Miner to ramp up its pro-Republican editorials. In order to assist that process, he appointed William Strand, a war correspondent for the Chicago Tribune, as the News-Miner's new editor. Though Truman won the 1948 election, the News-Miner stayed politically active in endorsing Republican candidates and issues. This ended only with Lathrop's death on July 26, 1950.|$|E
5|$|Chess {{strategy}} {{consists of}} setting and achieving long-term positioning advantages during the game– for example, {{where to place}} different pieces– while tactics concentrate on immediate maneuver. These {{two parts of the}} chess-playing process cannot be completely separated, because strategic goals are mostly achieved through tactics, while the tactical opportunities are based on the previous strategy of play. A game of chess is normally divided into three phases: opening, typically the first 10 moves, when players move their pieces to useful positions for the coming battle; then middlegame; and last the endgame, when most of the pieces are gone, kings typically <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>active</b> part in the struggle, and pawn promotion is often decisive.|$|E
5|$|Sakura's most {{well-known}} physical characteristic is her broad forehead. Consequently, {{because of this}} Kishimoto at times focuses too much effort on drawing it in scenes or promotional artwork where Sakura is featured prominently. This results in her forehead appearing too large. When designing Sakura in her Part II appearance, Kishimoto decided to change her clothes to a more lively karate suit style. The upper part, though, still has a Chinaesque feeling to it, {{so as to make}} her more feminine. During Part II's last story arc, Kishimoto tried making Sakura look more beautiful, most notably when she joins Naruto and Sasuke in the final fight against the creature Ten Tails. Due to Sakura having little popularity within readers, Kishimoto thought a popular fictional character, Hinata Hyuga, <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>active</b> role and become a heroine. Despite initially deciding that Naruto and Hinata would end together, Kishimoto thought it would be interesting if Sakura formed part of a love triangle. Nevertheless, Kishimoto said romance was not what his series he wanted to focus on. In the middle of the manga's final arc Sakura is given a love letter. The real reasons for this is that Kishimoto wanted to give the anime studio material to create animated only episodes.|$|E

5|$|The character's {{change in}} Part II (Naruto Shippuden) has been praised for {{being one of}} the most {{developed}} ones in the series by Anime News Network's Casey Brienza, as she has become stronger than her Part I (Naruto) counterpart which, was considerably weaker than Naruto and Sasuke. This allows her to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>active</b> and appealing role in the series. Major praise has been given to her encounters with Sasori and Sasuke owing to her fighting skills and mature reactions, respectively. Sakura's love confession to Naruto in later parts of the series has been commented {{to be one of the}} deepest lines and part of the story arc, for bringing confusion into the mix in regards to whether or not, her love confession claim is as serious as her intention to stop Naruto's suffering. It also came as a surprise as fans wondered what were Sakura's real intention regarding Sasuke who had become a dangerous criminal during such a time in the series. Jason Thompson believes Sakura's feelings were well-handled by Kishimoto. While disliking the romance between Sasuke and Sakura in the original series as she felt it was initially a crush on Sakura's part, Amy McNulty believed the spin-off manga Naruto Gaiden helps to expand the bond between these two as well as their relationship with their daughter, Sarada. Sarah Nelkin from Anime Now praised Sakura's development across the series, mostly in late parts of the series due to how she turns into a stronger person as she grows up most notably when she becomes an adult.|$|E

25|$|At {{this time}} the JC was mainly {{involved}} in propaganda, publishing tracts and clandestine newspapers, with minimal armed action.

Unlike Almeida, Albuquerque realized that the Portuguese could <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>active</b> role breaking Muslim supremacy in the Indian Ocean trade by taking control of three strategic chokepoints - Aden, Hormuz and Malacca. Albuquerque also understood the necessity of establishing a base of operations in lands directly controlled by the Portuguese crown {{and not just in}} territory granted by allied rulers such as Cochin and Cannanore.|$|E
25|$|Insurance can {{influence}} the probability of losses through moral hazard, insurance fraud, and preventive steps by the insurance company. Insurance scholars have typically used moral hazard {{to refer to the}} increased loss due to unintentional carelessness and insurance fraud to refer to increased risk due to intentional carelessness or indifference. Insurers attempt to address carelessness through inspections, policy provisions requiring certain types of maintenance, and possible discounts for loss mitigation efforts. While in theory insurers could encourage investment in loss reduction, some commentators have argued that in practice insurers had historically not aggressively pursued loss control measures—particularly to prevent disaster losses such as hurricanes—because of concerns over rate reductions and legal battles. However, since about 1996 insurers have begun to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>active</b> role in loss mitigation, such as through building codes.|$|E

25|$|In a post-Snowden {{world of}} global {{surveillance}} disclosures, consumers <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>active</b> interest in protecting their privacy and demand IoT devices to be screened for potential security vulnerabilities and privacy violations before purchasing them. According to the 2016 Accenture Digital Consumer Survey, in which 28000 consumers in 28 countries were polled on {{their use of}} consumer technology, security “has moved from being a nagging problem to a top barrier as consumers are now choosing to abandon IoT devices and services over security concerns.” The survey revealed that “out of the consumers aware of hacker attacks and owning or planning to own IoT devices {{in the next five}} years, 18 percent decided to terminate the use of the services and related services until they get safety guarantees.” This suggests that consumers increasingly perceive privacy risks and security concerns to outweigh the value propositions of IoT devices and opt to postpone planned purchases or service subscriptions.|$|E
25|$|In December 1932, {{the general}} counsel of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC) resigned, and Reed was {{appointed}} the agency's new general counsel. Since 1930, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Eugene Meyer, had pressed Hoover to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>active</b> approach to ameliorating the Great Depression. Hoover finally relented and submitted legislation. The Reconstruction Finance Corporation Act was signed into law on January 22, 1932, but its operations were kept secret for five months. Hoover feared both political attacks from Republicans and that publicity about which corporations were receiving RFC assistance might disrupt the agency's attempts to keep companies financially viable. When Congress passed legislation in July 1932 forcing the RFC to make public the companies that received loans, the resulting political embarrassment led to the resignation of the RFC's president and his successor as well as other staff turnover at the agency. Franklin D. Roosevelt's election as President in November 1932 led to further staff changes. On December 1, 1932, the RFC's general counsel resigned, and Hoover appointed Reed to the position. Roosevelt, impressed with Reed's work and needing someone who knew the agency, its staff and its operations, kept Reed on. Reed mentored and protected the careers of a number of young lawyers at RFC, many of whom became highly influential in the Roosevelt administration: Alger Hiss, Robert H. Jackson, Thomas Gardiner Corcoran, Charles Edward Wyzanski, Jr. (later an important federal district court judge), and David Cushman Coyle.|$|E
