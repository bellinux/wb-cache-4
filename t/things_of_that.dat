Commenting about the success of his singles, Songz stated that [...] "they're very strong records and they're not just radio records. They're records that embody the person I am as well as the artist I am. I think they're more definitive of who I am than any other album I've had. I've grown as an artist. I've been doing this [...] now. As I've matured, I've learned how to exude that of which I want to be felt.

He said of her in 1968 that she was [...] "a walking encyclopedia. All through her life she stored up knowledge on all sorts of subjects, {{and she had the}} great gift of being able to make it all interesting when she taught it to me. She was completely methodical; we had time-tables for each subject, and I had to do preparation, and so forth. She taught me to enjoy working hard, and to be thorough. She was outspoken and open-minded to a degree quite unusual in members of the Royal Family. And she was also entirely free from prejudice about politics or colour and <b>things</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> kind." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2001, Disney {{began to}} {{consider}} producing a sequel, {{but rather than}} using stop motion, Disney wanted to use computer animation. Burton convinced Disney to drop the idea. [...] "I was always very protective of Nightmare not to do sequels or <b>things</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> kind," [...] Burton explained. [...] "You know, 'Jack visits Thanksgiving world' or other kinds of things just because I felt the movie had a purity to it {{and the people that}} like it... Because it's a mass-market kind of thing, it was important to kind of keep that purity of it." [...] The 2004 video game [...] did serve as a sequel of the film, with Capcom's crew of developers going after Burton for advice, and having the collaboration of the film's art director, Deane Taylor. In 2009, Selick said he would do a film sequel if he and Burton could create a good story for it.|$|E

Goodier (mechanical {{engineer and}} academic), Sir Morien Morgan (called the [...] "Father of Concorde") and Beryl Platt, Baroness Platt (Conservative peer). [...] He was also in contact with Russian railway engineer Yury Lomonosov and lectured to biochemist Albert Chibnall. [...] Despite mentoring {{some of the best}} engineers of their generation Inglis was realistic about the actual intentions of many of his students at the time. [...] He once told a new intake class: [...] "Your fathers, gentlemen, have sent you to Cambridge to be educated, not to become engineers. They think, however, that reading engineering is a very good way of becoming educated. In 10 years' time, however, 90% of you will have become managers, whether of design, manufacturing, sales, research or even accounts departments in industry. The remaining 10% of you will have become successful lawyers, novelists, and <b>things</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> sort".

The album has been furthered delayed because of Milian's marriage to The-Dream and her pregnancy. In January 2010, Milian said that she was going back into the studio in the summer to record more material. Although the album had already been finished when Milian took a break for her pregnancy, she wanted to [...] "go back and re-do some of the music and make some new songs and find my new inspiration". In October 2009, Tricky Stewart said that another single had yet to be chosen, {{and that it would be}} the first single off Elope.

500|$|The New 52 ongoing {{series are}} {{organized}} under seven different [...] "families," [...] grouping similar characters or themes within the books together. By {{the release of}} the October 2013 solicitations, DC was no longer grouping the titles by these families. They instead began releasing one larger solicit, titled [...] "The New 52 Group". However, titles that were not participating in an event for the month, such as [...] "Forever Evil", were still grouped together in the larger solicit by the previous family headings. In September 2014, DC co-publisher Dan DiDio spoke about classifying the titles into the families, saying, [...] "one of the things we did, when we launched the New 52, we broke those classifications up {{in a way that we}} were able to draw attention to all the characters. So we put them in groupings so we would be able to promote and help them draw attention in groups. It was never made to be a certain amount different stuff. We always want to have different styles of product... with a lot of characters, we're careful. Things like Frankenstein and Grifter and Voodoo and <b>things</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> nature, which were really risky characters and risky chances for us to take, and we're very happy to do them. Even though they didn't work, we knew there was value in those characters... We think they brought a lot of value to the launch. They brought a lot of breadth and depth to the line of books, and a diversity to the line. We didn't want to put them out and then forget about them. It was very important to make sure that they were prominent in other series, and that's why we put them in" [...] other series.|$|E

2500|$|The central plank of {{the theory}} of Portuguese {{discovery}} of Australia suggests the continent called Jave la Grande, which uniquely appears on a series of 16th-century French world maps, the Dieppe school of maps, represents Australia. Speaking in 1982, Kenneth McIntyre described the Dieppe maps as [...] "the only evidence of Portuguese discovery of Eastern Australia". He stressed this to point out [...] "that the Mahogany Ship, and the Geelong Keys, and other <b>things</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> sort, {{are not part of the}} proof that the Portuguese discovered Australia. It is the other way around. The Dieppe maps prove (sic) that the Portuguese discovered Australia, and this throws a fierce bright light on our mysteries such as the Mahogany Ship". Later writers on the same topic take the same approach of concentrating primarily on [...] "Jave la Grande" [...] as it appears in the Dieppe maps, including Fitzgerald, McKiggan and most recently, Peter Trickett.|$|E

With an $82 million budget, post-production began in September 2009 and was expected to last until January 2010 in Vancouver and Toronto. Originally, production would have started in June 2009, but it was postponed. Production concluded on January 22, 2010. Snyder confirmed that prior to the set production date, he already shot some fantasy sequences for Sucker Punch. Snyder said the film is a [...] "stylized motion picture about action and sort of landscapes of the imagination and <b>things</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> nature". Snyder had also been decided on the film's title for some time, stating it is a pop-culture reference.

2500|$|In 1952, Young stunned {{observers}} when {{he appeared}} before the McCarthy era House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC) and defied the congressmen with sarcastic retorts and repeatedly refused to answer {{whether or not he}} was a member of the Communist Party. The encounter came at a highly publicized formal hearing in Detroit. Young’s performance made him a hero in Detroit’s growing black community. [...] On HUAC’s charge that he seemed reluctant to fight communism, Coleman said: “I am not here to fight in any un-American activities, because I consider the denial of the right to vote to large numbers of people all over the South un-American.” On the HUAC congressman from Georgia: “I happen to know, in Georgia, Negro people are prevented from voting by virtue of terror, intimidation and lynchings. It is my contention you would not be in Congress today if it were not for the legal restrictions on voting on the part of my people.” [...] On the HUAC committee: “Congressman, neither me or none of my friends were at this plant the other day brandishing a rope in the face of John Cherveny, a young union organizer and factory worker who was threatened with repeated violence after members of the HUAC alleged that he might be a communist, I can assure you I have had no part in the hanging or bombing of Negroes in the South. I have not been responsible for firing a person from his job for what I think are his beliefs, or what somebody thinks he believes in, and <b>things</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> sort.

2500|$|In June five adult actresses {{met with}} Hall's {{district}} director, Heather Hutt, at the legislator's office on Artesia Boulevard in Compton and presented 650 signed petitions asking that the Assemblyman withdraw his [...] "condoms in porn" [...] bill. At {{the meeting with}} Hutt were adult film actresses Nina Hartley, Alex Chance and Anikka Albrite, along with industry newcomers Mia Li and Charli Piper and Michael Stabile, a publicist {{who has been working}} with Free Speech Coalition (FSC) and Kink.com on the issue. The group expressed their disappointment with the bill {{and the fact that it}} had been created with no input from adult industry representatives. In an interview with AVN magazine, Chance stated the following,"We told [...] we have our own self-regulation..." [...] "We told her we wanted to have our voices heard. They'd had no performer input on this. About condoms and chafing and micro-tears, it didn't seem like she really knew all the details of that. She compared it to a dentist being forced to wear gloves, and maybe it's a little uncomfortable. She didn't realize why we have to have sex from 45 minutes to an hour, sometimes longer, and why that was necessary. She didn't know that the dangers of it, like if the condom breaks, and that we could get more STI's with the micro-tears, and just the condoms in general: Swelling, yeast infections, <b>things</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> nature—she just had no idea." [...] "She also didn't know about the doctors with the FSC that help make the decisions," [...] Chance added. [...] "It's not just a couple of people in a building making decisions for the whole industry. They don't even make decisions on the moratoriums; a doctor does, and she had no idea about that and what the testing protocols—how the doctors work with them to make the most safe tests available; she had no idea." ...|$|E
