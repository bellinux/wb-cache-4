Rather than simply cease operations, Bate and the other directors of the team <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> to Ted Dey, owner of the Arena. Dey cut player salaries and let players go, including Art Ross to the Wanderers. Dey also fired manager Alf Smith, saving on his $750 salary.|$|E

25|$|James Fields Smathers of Kansas City invented what is {{considered}} the first practical power-operated typewriter in 1914. In 1920, after returning from Army service, he produced a successful model and in 1923 <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> to the Northeast Electric Company of Rochester for development. Northeast was interested in finding new markets for their electric motors and developed Smathers's design {{so that it could}} be marketed to typewriter manufacturers, and from 1925 Remington Electric typewriters were produced powered by Northeast's motors.|$|E
25|$|Hugh Pigot (5 September 1769 – 21 September 1797) was {{an officer}} in the Royal Navy. Through his {{connections}} and their patronage he was able to rise to the rank of captain, despite apparently poor leadership skills and a reputation for brutality. While he was captain of Hermione he eventually provoked his men to mutiny. The mutiny, which became one of the bloodiest {{in the history of the}} Royal Navy, left Pigot and nine other officers dead. The Navy hunted down and executed a number of the mutineers and recaptured his ship from the Spanish, to whom the mutineers had <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> <b>over.</b>|$|E

25|$|New York {{responded with}} a drive to the Oilers 3-yard line. Facing fourth down and inches, running back Freeman McNeil tried to advance the ball but was tackled for no gain. Late in the game, New York had another chance to score when safety Lonnie Young forced a fumble while sacking Moon and Tony Stargell {{recovered}} for the Jets on the Oilers 26-yard line, but they <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> on downs again. With just over a minute left, New York {{managed to get the}} ball back for one last drive, but McDowell intercepted a pass from O'Brien on the game's final play.|$|E
25|$|In February 1985, Israel {{withdrew from}} Sidon and <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> to the Lebanese Army, but faced attacks: 15 Israelis {{were killed and}} 105 wounded during the withdrawal. Dozens of pro-Israeli Lebanese militiamen were also assassinated. From mid-February to mid-March, the Israelis lost 18 dead and 35 wounded. On 11 March, Israeli forces raided the town of Zrariyah, killing 40 Amal fighters and {{capturing}} a large stock of arms. On 9 April, a Shiite girl drove a car bomb into an IDF convoy, and the following day, a soldier {{was killed by a}} land mine. During that same period, Israeli forces killed 80 Lebanese guerrillas in five weeks. Another 1,800 Shi'as were taken as prisoners.|$|E
25|$|After {{the ensuing}} kickoff, Kosar {{completed}} a 25-yard pass to tight end Ozzie Newsome and a 19-yarder to Clarence Weathers on third down and 17 {{on the way}} to a 29-yard field goal by Matt Bahr two minutes into the second quarter. But Denver stormed right back on an 80-yard drive that ended with a 1-yard touchdown run by Lang, making the score 21–3. A sack by Denver's Rulon Jones helped force the Browns to a three and out. This time all the Broncos could manage was a missed field goal by Rich Karlis. But once again Cleveland could not move the ball and <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> with a fumble from receiver Brian Brennan that was recovered by cornerback Randy Robbins. This time the Browns defense stepped up, sacking Elway twice and forcing Denver's first punt of the game. After that, Kosar's 24-yard completion to Slaughter set up a 45-yard field goal attempt by Bahr, but he sent it wide right as time expired in the half.|$|E

25|$|Early in {{the morning}} of February 16, at a council of war, the generals and field {{officers}} decided to surrender their army. Floyd, concerned that he would be arrested for treason if captured by the Union Army, turned his command over to Pillow, who immediately <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> to Buckner. Colonel Nathan Bedford Forrest and his entire Tennessee cavalry regiment escaped while Pillow escaped on a small boat across the Cumberland. The next morning Floyd escaped by steamboat with the 36th Virginia and 51st Virginia Infantry regiments, two artillery batteries and elements of the other units from his old command. He safely reached Nashville, having escaped just before Buckner surrendered to Grant in one of the greatest strategic defeats of the Civil War. He never satisfactorily explained upon what principles he appropriated all the transportation on to the use of his particular command". Floyd was relieved of his command by Confederate President Jefferson Davis, without a court of inquiry, on March 11, 1862. He resumed his commission as a major general of Virginia Militia, but his health soon failed and he died a year later at Abingdon, Virginia, where he is buried in Sinking Spring Cemetery.|$|E
25|$|Six {{minutes into}} the second quarter, Cowboys linebacker Lee Roy Jordan tackled Unitas, causing him to fumble. Dallas {{recovered}} the loose ball at the Baltimore 28 and capitalized three plays later, scoring on a 7-yard touchdown pass from Morton to Thomas to establish a 13-6 lead. The next time the Colts had the ball they quickly <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> yet again, with Unitas unleashing a fluttering interception to Renfro while being hit fiercely on a pass. Unitas was knocked {{out of the game}} permanently on the play with a rib injury and was replaced by Earl Morrall, who was widely blamed for the Colts loss in Super Bowl III. The Cowboys, starting from their own 15, were unable to score any points off the turnover. After sustaining a 15-yard pass interference penalty, they punted. After regaining possession, the Colts offense, led by Morrall, stormed {{all the way to the}} Cowboys 2-yard line with less than two minutes remaining in the half. However, the Cowboys defense stiffened. Colts running back Norm Bulaich was stuffed on three consecutive rushing attempts from inside the 2-yard line. On fourth down, Morrall threw an incomplete pass, turning the ball over on downs and ending the half with Dallas leading 13–6.|$|E
25|$|Oklahoma got {{the ball}} to begin the second half but {{immediately}} <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> after the Miami defense sacked Jones and forced a fuma\ble at the Oklahoma 11-yard line. Miami recovered it and quickly converted it to a touchdown, taking the lead by a score of 14–10. Oklahoma {{was not able to}} answer and instead incurred two personal foul penalties forcing them into a fourth down with 42 yards to go. Miami took possession after the punt and capitalized with a third touchdown giving them an 11-point lead. Trying to prevent the game from getting out of hand, Oklahoma marched down the field after plays that included a 19-yard rush from Chris Brown, a 25-yard pass to Cameron Kenney, and a 21-yard pass to DeMarco Murray to score a touchdown to decrease the deficit to four. The score would remain unchanged until Oklahoma scored a field goal {{near the end of the}} fourth quarter on a drive that saw six consecutive running plays and one pass that gained no yards. Miami took possession of the ball with just over four minutes remaining in the game and were able to hold that possession until time expired giving them a one-point win.|$|E

25|$|In 1887 Burnett {{traveled}} to England for Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee, {{which became the}} first of yearly transatlantic trips from the United States to England. Accompanied by her sons, she visited tourist attractions such as Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum in London. In her rented rooms she continued the Tuesday evening salon and soon attracted visitors, meeting Stephen Townsend for the first time. Despite her busy schedule, she felt ill {{from the heat and}} the crowds of tourists, spending protracted periods in bed. With her sons, she moved on to spend the winter in Florence, where she wrote The Fortunes of Philippa Fairfax, the only book to be published in England but not in the United States. That winter Sara Crewe or What Happened at Miss Minchin's was published in the United States. She would go on to make Sara Crewe into a stage play, and later rewrite the story into ALittle Princess. In 1888, Burnett returned to Manchester, where she leased a large home off Cromwell Road, had it decorated, and then <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> to cousins to run as a boarding house, after which she moved to London, where she again took rooms, enjoyed the London season, and prepared Phyllis for production, a stage adaptation of The Fortunes of Philippa Fairfax. When the play ran she was disappointed by the bad reviews, and turned to socializing. During this period she began to see more of Stephen Townsend, whom she had met during the Jubilee year.|$|E
25|$|Rams {{defensive}} back Aeneas Williams {{opened up the}} scoring by returning an interception from Favre 29 yards for a touchdown. The next time Green Bay had the ball, they <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> again when safety Kim Herring stripped the ball from Ahman Green and rookie Adam Archuleta recovered it. However, the Rams were unable {{to take advantage of}} this turnover. A few plays later, Warner's pass was intercepted by Darren Sharper on the Packers 35-yard line. Favre then completed a pair of passes to Corey Bradford and Donald Driver for gains of 27 and 16 yards, before tying the game with a 22-yard touchdown pass to Antonio Freeman. But the Rams stormed right back with a 15-yard completion to Az-Zahir Hakim and a 38-yard burst from running back Marshall Faulk advancing the ball to the Packers 11-yard line. Two plays later, Warner completed a 4-yard touchdown pass to Torry Holt to put the Rams back in the lead. Then on Green Bay's next drive, Herring intercepted a pass from Favre and returned it 45 yards to the Packers 4-yard line, setting up a 4-yard touchdown catch by fullback James Hodgins early in the second quarter. Allen Rossum returned the ensuing kickoff 95 yards for a touchdown, but a holding penalty on Torrance Marshall eliminated the score. Green Bay still managed to score with a Ryan Longwell field goal, but Rams kicker Jeff Wilkins responded with a field goal of his own to give the Rams a 24–10 halftime lead.|$|E
