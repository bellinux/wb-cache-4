5|$|The ballad {{speaks of}} the Wabash River, which flows through Indiana, and reminisces about events that {{occurred}} there. The song has two verses and a chorus. The first verse is about the narrator's childhood on a farm and his love for his mother. The second verse is about his lost love, Mary. While the subjects of <b>the</b> <b>verses</b> are connected, the narrative of the chorus is detached from <b>the</b> <b>verses</b> as it seemingly reminisces nostalgically.|$|E
5|$|The lyrics' {{reference}} {{to an extreme}} length of time is accentuated by the stretching out of an already slow 6/8 metre into 9/8, and, during <b>the</b> <b>verses,</b> by the appending of a measure-long instrumental tag after each two bars of vocal melody. Partly {{as a result of}} the absence of resolution in the home key, the descending bassline in <b>the</b> <b>verses</b> – a 4-3-2-1 sequence of notes mirroring the IV-iii-ii-I chord pattern – establishes an almost subliminal tonic.|$|E
5|$|Written for piano, guitar, and mandolin, {{the music}} {{begins in the}} key of G major with an Andante Moderato tempo. <b>The</b> <b>verses</b> follow a chord {{progression}} of G–C–G. The chorus transitions to B minor, and progresses as B–E–E, before returning to G–C–G in its final bars. Although the melody of the chorus is unique within the piece, it is in harmonic unity with <b>the</b> <b>verses.</b> An upbeat version played at a Andantino tempo was also adapted for play by small orchestras and big bands.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>verse</b> of Ikmal al-Din (Arabic: آیه اکمال) (perfection of the {{religion}}) is <b>the</b> <b>verse</b> {{three of}} sura al-Ma'ida.

5000|$|Thus, {{while in}} both forms A is <b>the</b> <b>verse</b> and B is the chorus, in AABA <b>the</b> <b>verse</b> takes {{up most of}} the time and the chorus exists to {{contrast}} and lead back into the return of <b>the</b> <b>verse,</b> in verse-chorus form the chorus often takes much more time proportionally and <b>the</b> <b>verse</b> exists to lead into it. For example: ABABB(B) [...] "Be My Baby", rather than thirty-two-bar form's AABA.|$|R
5|$|Bach used {{a rather}} unusual melody by Caspar von Stieler, whereas he based his later chorale cantata on this hymn on the melody by Jacob Regnart. The hymn {{is treated as}} in a chorale fantasia, with string ritornellos between <b>the</b> <b>verses.</b>|$|E

5|$|The song {{opens with}} an {{introduction}} {{consisting of a}} sustained measure of electronic effects followed by two lines from the chorus. In each two-measure line {{during the first half}} of <b>the</b> <b>verses,</b> Stefani descends the scale while the keyboard plays the off-beats of the first measure and the electric bass opens the line with a two-note bassline. During the second half of <b>the</b> <b>verses,</b> Stefani's vocals are overdubbed, and the instrumentation becomes more frequent. Each of the two verses is followed by the chorus, where overdubbing is used on Stefani's vocals to produce first inversion and normal form E minor chords. Bounty Killer then toasts the bridge, and after a brief section sung by Stefani, the song closes by repeating the chorus twice.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>verse</b> of loan (آية المداينة) is verse 282 {{in chapter}} Al-Baqara. This <b>verse</b> is <b>the</b> longest <b>verse</b> at <b>the</b> longest chapter in Quran. The concept of {{borrowing}} was explained in <b>the</b> <b>verse.</b>|$|R

5|$|Dohavali (दोहावली, 1581), {{literally}} Collection of Dohas, {{is a work}} {{consisting of}} 573 miscellaneous Doha and Sortha verses mainly in Braja with some verses in Awadhi. <b>The</b> <b>verses</b> are aphorisms on topics related to tact, political wisdom, righteousness {{and the purpose of}} life. 85 Dohas from this work are also found in the Ramcharitmanas, 35 in Ramagya Prashna, two in Vairagya Sandipani and some in Rama Satsai, another work of 700 Dohas attributed to Tulsidas.|$|E

5|$|Jimmy Carter {{would later}} {{refer to the}} line in his presidential {{nomination}} speech at the 1976 Democratic National Convention, though it addresses matters of the self which supersede politics, in the process displaying certain themes associated with existentialism. Throughout the song, the words pour out quickly, with Dylan barely taking a breath between lines, so that the intricate rhyming structure is often missed: AAAAAB CCCCCB DDDDDB in <b>the</b> <b>verses</b> and AAB in the chorus.|$|E

The copper plate engravings are reproduced in Peter and Iona Opie's Nursery Companion.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>verse</b> omits {{mentioning}} any pre-Conquest Saxon kings. The {{main part}} of <b>the</b> <b>verse</b> is largely constant, but the stanza from the 20th century {{has a number of}} variations. Alan Bennett's staging of <b>the</b> <b>verse</b> in Forty Years On works around the issue by stopping at Victoria. The 1991 film King Ralph included a brief section of the mnemonic.|$|R
