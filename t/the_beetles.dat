5|$|A {{second case}} occurs {{a few days}} later, another man killed by <b>the</b> <b>beetles,</b> but they find <b>the</b> <b>beetles</b> to be larger and more mature. From the second victim's movements, they {{identify}} the likely culprit as Dr. Armand Silva (Alon Abutbul), a former scientist. Dr. Silva {{was working on a}} cure for avian flu using the skelter beetle, but his research was terminated with the extinction of the sheep. Fauxlivia and Frank postulate Dr. Silva may be trying to breed <b>the</b> <b>beetles</b> in humans, who share similar biological features with sheep.|$|E
5|$|Government {{agencies}} {{in both the}} USA and Canada have utilized a native species of parasitoid wasp, Cerceris fumipennis, {{as a means of}} detecting areas to which emerald ash borer has spread. The females of these wasps hunt other jewel beetles and emerald ash borer if it is present. The wasps stun <b>the</b> <b>beetles</b> and carry them back to their burrows in the ground where they are stored until the wasps’ eggs hatch and the wasp larvae feed on <b>the</b> <b>beetles.</b> Volunteers catch the wasps as they return to their burrows carrying <b>the</b> <b>beetles</b> to determine whether emerald ash borer is present. This methodology is known as biological surveillance, as opposed to biological control, because it does not appear that the wasps have a significant negative impact on emerald ash borer populations.|$|E
5|$|Other {{cultural}} controls {{may be used}} {{in combination}} with crop rotation: Mulching the potato crop with straw early in the growing season may reduce the beetle’s ability to locate potato fields, and the mulch creates an environment that favours beetle's predators; Plastic-lined trenches have been used as pitfall traps to catch <b>the</b> <b>beetles</b> as they move toward a field of potatoes in the spring, exploiting their inability to fly immediately after emergence; Flamethrowers may also be used to kill <b>the</b> <b>beetles</b> when they are visible {{at the top of the}} plant's foliage.|$|E
50|$|As <b>the</b> <b>beetle</b> inside <b>the</b> pupa matures, the pupa darkens and <b>the</b> <b>beetle</b> within {{becomes more}} prominent, for example, {{the eyes of}} <b>the</b> <b>beetle</b> may be seen. When this occurs, <b>the</b> <b>beetle</b> will usually eclose a few days later.|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} insect pests infest stored dry {{foods such as}} flour, cereals and pasta; these include the Indian mealmoth, <b>the</b> {{cigarette}} <b>beetle,</b> <b>the</b> drugstore <b>beetle,</b> <b>the</b> confused flour <b>beetle,</b> <b>the</b> red flour <b>beetle,</b> <b>the</b> merchant grain <b>beetle,</b> <b>the</b> sawtoothed grain <b>beetle,</b> <b>the</b> wheat weevil, the maize weevil and the rice weevil.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>beetle</b> has a {{symbiotic}} relationship {{with at least one}} species of mite, which is able to latch-on to <b>the</b> <b>beetle's</b> body beneath its hard shell, and remain securely attached when <b>the</b> <b>beetle</b> is burrowing or flying. <b>The</b> <b>beetle</b> thus provides <b>the</b> mites with safety and transport, while the mites are known to feed on mould in the dung, that would otherwise cause <b>the</b> <b>beetle's</b> source of food to decompose.|$|R
5|$|Within the York {{distribution}} <b>the</b> <b>beetles</b> {{are dependent}} on tansy as their sole food source; if a clump disappears <b>the</b> <b>beetles</b> are forced to walk to a new location as they rarely fly, despite having fully working wings and being capable of doing so. The loss of habitat impacts upon {{the ability of the}} tansy beetle to find an alternative source of the host plant. Additionally, tansy is a ruderal species and thus has a naturally high rate of turnover of plants, forcing beetles to regularly seek out new tansy patches to colonise.|$|E
5|$|A {{chain of}} victims soon {{succumb to the}} eggs {{contained}} in the toxic smoke, {{all of whom are}} found with their bodies covered in the tobacco beetles.

5|$|Beetles have {{a variety}} of ways to communicate, {{including}} the use of pheromones. The mountain pine beetle emits a pheromone to attract other beetles to a tree. The mass of beetles are able to overcome the chemical defenses of the tree. After the tree's defenses have been exhausted, <b>the</b> <b>beetles</b> emit an anti-aggregation pheromone. The species can stridulate to communicate.|$|E
50|$|Cicindela limbalis is {{a species}} of tiger <b>beetle.</b> <b>The</b> length of <b>the</b> <b>beetle</b> is 12 - 16 mm. <b>The</b> <b>beetle's</b> back is reddish purple and {{sometimes}} may be dull green or brown. The species can commonly be found on steep, moist bare clay soil. <b>The</b> <b>beetle</b> can live for 3 years.|$|R
50|$|Interest in the Salt Creek tiger beetle {{began with}} surveys {{conducted}} by the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in the mid-1980s. These surveys indicated that <b>the</b> <b>beetle</b> was quite rare; an in-depth study of <b>the</b> <b>beetle</b> began in 1991. <b>The</b> <b>beetle</b> {{was added to the}} Nebraska endangered species lists in the 1990s. On October 6, 2005, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service listed <b>the</b> <b>beetle</b> as an endangered species under the federal Endangered Species Act.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> walnut twig <b>beetle</b> is not <b>the</b> first bark <b>beetle</b> to be {{associated}} with a species of Geosmithia. The deaths of black walnut trees associated with <b>the</b> walnut twig <b>beetle</b> are not caused by <b>the</b> <b>beetle</b> but instead Geosmithia morbida. The origin of Geosmithia morbida is not known, but experts strongly believe that its emergence is connected to <b>the</b> walnut tree <b>beetle</b> and <b>the</b> Arizona walnut tree, and was not caused by the transfer of the disease from another area but instead by an evolutionary change in a similar species of fungi that inhabited closely to where <b>the</b> <b>beetle</b> was first identified. <b>The</b> fungus and <b>beetle</b> have developed a symbiotic relationship in which the fungus allows itself to be eaten by <b>the</b> <b>beetle</b> in return for a ride to the fungi's next host. <b>The</b> walnut twig <b>beetle’s</b> hard shell covers two wings, and because <b>the</b> <b>beetle</b> can fly, Geosmithia morbida is reliant on <b>the</b> walnut twig <b>beetle</b> to be spread across distances, making the fungus entomochoric, or completely dependent upon <b>the</b> walnut twig <b>beetle</b> and only found in habitats with <b>the</b> <b>beetle.</b>|$|R
5|$|During the Cold War, the Warsaw Pact {{countries}} {{launched a}} widespread {{war against the}} potato beetle, blaming {{the introduction of the}} species from America on the CIA, demonising the species in propaganda posters, and urging children to gather <b>the</b> <b>beetles</b> and kill them.|$|E
5|$|Mutualism is {{well known}} in a few beetles, such as the ambrosia beetle, which {{partners}} with fungi to digest the wood of dead trees. <b>The</b> <b>beetles</b> excavate tunnels in dead trees in which they cultivate fungal gardens, their sole source of nutrition. After landing on a suitable tree, an ambrosia beetle excavates a tunnel in which it releases spores of its fungal symbiont. The fungus penetrates the plant's xylem tissue, digests it, and concentrates the nutrients on and near the surface of the beetle gallery, so the weevils and the fungus both benefit. <b>The</b> <b>beetles</b> cannot eat the wood due to toxins, and uses its relationship with fungi to help overcome the defenses of its host tree in order to provide nutrition for their larvae. Chemically mediated by a bacterially produced polyunsaturated peroxide, this mutualistic relationship between the beetle and the fungus is coevolved.|$|E
5|$|The {{consistency}} of beetle morphology, in particular their possession of elytra, has long suggested that Coleoptera is monophyletic, though {{there have been}} doubts about {{the arrangement of the}} suborders, namely the Adephaga, Archostemata, Myxophaga and Polyphaga within that clade. The twisted-wing parasites, Strepsiptera, are thought to be a sister group to <b>the</b> <b>beetles,</b> having split from them in the Early Permian.|$|E
50|$|In September 1970, Volkswagen of Brazil's president, Rudolf Leiding, {{challenged}} the company's designers to recreate <b>the</b> <b>Beetle</b> with <b>the</b> Brazilian market in mind. At that time, <b>the</b> <b>Beetle,</b> <b>the</b> Bus and the Karmann-Ghia {{were the only}} air-cooled VWs that proved successful in Brazil. For Leiding, the new Volkswagen should be practical, economical and larger than <b>the</b> <b>Beetle.</b>|$|R

5|$|Before {{the early}} 1840s, the cane toad had been {{introduced}} into Martinique and Barbados, from French Guiana and Guyana. An introduction to Jamaica was made in 1844 {{in an attempt to}} reduce the rat population. Despite its failure to control the rodents, the cane toad was introduced to Puerto Rico in the early 20th century in the hope that it would counter a beetle infestation ravaging the sugarcane plantations. The Puerto Rican scheme was successful and halted the economic damage caused by <b>the</b> <b>beetles,</b> prompting scientists in the 1930s to promote it as an ideal solution to agricultural pests.|$|E
5|$|Dung beetles form spherical {{balls of}} animal excrement, which they roll with their bodies, {{generally}} by walking backwards and pushing {{the ball with}} their rear legs. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that this rolling behavior evolved independently several times. The behavior of these beetles was noted in ancient Egyptian culture, which imparted sacred significance to their activities. Although it is the dung ball that rolls rather than the beetle itself, <b>the</b> <b>beetles</b> face {{many of the same}} mechanical difficulties that rolling organisms contend with.|$|E
5|$|Insect ecology is the {{scientific}} study of how insects, individually or as a community, interact with the surrounding environment or ecosystem. Insects play {{one of the most important}} roles in their ecosystems, which includes many roles, such as soil turning and aeration, dung burial, pest control, pollination and wildlife nutrition. An example is <b>the</b> <b>beetles,</b> which are scavengers that feed on dead animals and fallen trees and thereby recycle biological materials into forms found useful by other organisms. These insects, and others, are responsible for much of the process by which topsoil is created.|$|E

5|$|More than 40 beetle {{species have}} been {{recorded}} in common house martin nests, but most are either typical of the locality or found in the nests of other birds. The typical number of individuals, around 200, is relatively low compared to other bird species (1,400 individual beetles for house sparrow, 2,000 for sand martin). <b>The</b> <b>beetles</b> {{have no effect on}} the nesting birds, and the reason for their comparatively low numbers is unknown, although the numbers of specific parasites found in house martin's nests is also quite small.|$|E
5|$|The tansy beetle has a Palearctic distribution. Evidence from archaeological {{excavation}} {{has shown}} that its presence in western Europe is confirmed at least {{as early as the}} Neolithic period. <b>The</b> <b>beetles</b> may be found on tansy (Tanacetum vulgare) and water mint (Mentha aquatica) in fen land and the banks of rivers with broad floodplains in Britain. Larvae are also recorded from other host plants: Achillea ptarmica (sneezewort) in France and various plants of the genus Artemisia in Russia. Adults and larvae feed on the leaves of their host plants.|$|E
5|$|Adult Psylliodes luridipennis beetles are {{invariably}} {{found on}} the Lundy cabbage (Coincya wrightii), a species endemic to the island of Lundy, where they feed on the leaves. They are not found on other locally occurring plants. However, researchers were also able to lure <b>the</b> <b>beetles</b> onto other crucifers taken from gardens. Two other taxa are known only from Lundy cabbages—the true weevil Ceutorhynchus contractus var. pallipes and an undescribed race of the flea beetle Psylliodes napi—making the plant unique to Britain as the only endemic species which is the exclusive host to endemic insect species. However, the Lundy cabbage is also host to a diverse variety of other invertebrate species.|$|E

5|$|Carpet beetles {{are members}} of the family Dermestidae, and while the adult beetles feed on nectar and pollen, the larvae are {{destructive}} pests in homes, warehouses and museums. They feed on animal products including wool, silk, leather, fur, the bristles of hair brushes, pet hair, feathers and museum specimens. They tend to infest hidden locations and may feed on larger areas of fabrics than do clothes moths, leaving behind specks of excrement and brown, hollow, bristly-looking cast skins. Management of infestations is difficult and is based on exclusion and sanitation where possible, resorting to pesticides when necessary. <b>The</b> <b>beetles</b> can fly in from outdoors and the larvae can survive on lint fragments, dust and inside the bags of vacuum cleaners. In warehouses and museums, sticky traps baited with suitable pheromones can be used to identify problems, and heating, freezing, spraying the surface with insecticide and fumigation will kill the insects when suitably applied. Susceptible items can be protected from attack by keeping them in clean airtight containers.|$|E
5|$|Dung beetles (Scarabidae) {{have been}} {{successfully}} used to reduce the populations of pestilent flies, such as Musca vetustissima and Haematobia exigua which are serious pests of cattle in Australia. <b>The</b> <b>beetles</b> make the dung unavailable to breeding pests by quickly rolling and burying it in the soil, with the added effect of improving soil fertility, tilth, and nutrient cycling. The Australian Dung Beetle Project (1965–1985), introduced species of dung beetle to Australia from South Africa and Europe to reduce populations of Musca vetustissima, following successful trials of this technique in Hawaii. The American Institute of Biological Sciences reports that dung beetles save the United States cattle industry an estimated US$380 million annually through burying above-ground livestock feces.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere in Europe, {{the beetle}} became {{established}} near USA {{military bases in}} Bordeaux during or immediately following World War I and had proceeded to spread {{by the beginning of}} World War II to Belgium, the Netherlands and Spain. The population increased dramatically during and immediately following World War II and spread eastward, and the beetle is now found over much of the continent. After World War II, in the Soviet occupation zone of Germany, almost half of all potato fields were infested by the beetle by 1950. In East Germany they were known as Amikäfer ('Yankee beetles') following a governmental claim that <b>the</b> <b>beetles</b> were dropped by American planes. In the EU it remains a regulated (quarantine) pest for the UK, Republic of Ireland, Balearic Islands, Cyprus, Malta and southern parts of Sweden and Finland. It is not established in any of these Member States, but occasional infestations can occur when, for example, wind blows adults from Russia to Finland.|$|E
