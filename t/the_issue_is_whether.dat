25|$|<b>The</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> Richard {{was indeed}} {{using the same}} {{specimen}} as Lamarck; the geographical origin {{is said to be}} different, and the descriptions do not match; for example in Lamarck's Cephalanthus chinensis the inflorescences are axillary whereas in Richard's Anthocephalus they are terminal. If specimens were the same, then Anthocephalus is a synonym of the Madagascan Cephalanthus and cannot be a generic name for the Asian kadam tree. If they were different (in spite of Richard's claim that they were the same) then Anthocephalus could be a generic name for the kadam tree. Based on the latter view, the name Anthocephalus chinensis has been widely used for the kadam tree.|$|E

Romulo stated [...] "We hold that the issue is primarily moral. <b>The</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> the United Nations should accept responsibility for the enforcement of a policy which is clearly repugnant to the valid nationalist aspirations of the people of Palestine. The Philippines Government holds that the United Nations ought not to accept such responsibility". After a phone call from Washington, the representative was recalled and the Philippines' vote changed.|$|E
2500|$|In 2002 Phantom Works, Boeing's {{advanced}} {{research and development}} facility in Seattle, approached Evgeny Podkletnov directly. Phantom Works was blocked by Russian technology transfer controls. At this time Lieutenant General George Muellner, the outgoing head of the Boeing Phantom Works, confirmed that attempts by Boeing to work with Podkletnov had been blocked by Moscow, also commenting that [...] "The physical principles – and Podkletnov's device {{is not the only}} one – appear to be valid... There is basic science there. They're not breaking the laws of physics. <b>The</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> the science can be engineered into something workable" ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the first}} trial, <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> John {{attempted}} to kill Monica. The officer {{is asked to}} testify to what he heard Monica scream from inside the house: [...] "Help, John is trying to kill me!" [...] This statement would be hearsay. The officer is being asked to testify to what Monica said to prove that John attempted to murder Monica. Unless the attorney can show that this statement falls within {{an exception to the}} hearsay rule, the factfinder (the judge or jury) may not consider Monica's statement (this particular statement, however, would likely be admissible because of [...] "Excited Utterance" [...] and [...] "Present sense impression" [...] exceptions).|$|E
2500|$|... "Our {{evaluation}} of the proper balance {{that has to be}} struck in this type of case leads us to conclude that there must be a narrowly drawn authority to permit a reasonable search for weapons {{for the protection of the}} police officer, where he has reason to believe that he is dealing with an armed and dangerous individual, regardless of whether he has probable cause to arrest the individual for a crime. The officer need not be absolutely certain that the individual is armed; <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> a reasonably prudent man in the circumstances would be warranted in the belief that his safety or that of others was in danger (italics added)." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} year, {{a different}} {{judge of the}} High Court departed from the view taken in Tang Kin Hwa. In Re Shankar Alan s/o Anant Kulkarni (2006), Judicial Commissioner Sundaresh Menon definitively answering the question left open by Phang {{as to whether the}} two tests for apparent bias were the same. He thought that there was a real difference between the reasonable suspicion and real likelihood tests. In his opinion, [...] "suspicion" [...] suggests a belief that something that may not be provable could still be possible. [...] "Reasonable" [...] suggests that the belief cannot be fanciful. Here <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> it is reasonable for the one to harbour the suspicions in the circumstances even though the suspicious behaviour could be innocent. On the other hand, [...] "likelihood" [...] points towards something being likely, and [...] "real" [...] suggests that this must be substantial rather than imagined. Here, then, the inquiry is directed more towards the actor than the observer. The issue {{is the degree to which}} a particular event is not likely or possible.|$|E

2500|$|In contrast, in Re Shankar Alan s/o Anant Kulkarni (2006), Judicial Commissioner Sundaresh Menon {{thought that}} there was a real {{difference}} between the reasonable suspicion and real likelihood tests. In his opinion, suspicion suggests a belief that something that may not be provable could still be possible. Reasonable suggests that the belief cannot be fanciful. Here <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> it is reasonable for the one to harbour the suspicions in the circumstances even though the suspicious behaviour could be innocent.

Here, then, the inquiry is directed more towards the actor than the observer. The issue {{is the degree to which}} a particular event is not likely or possible. Menon J.C. also disagreed with both Lord Goff in Gough and Phang J.C. in Tang Kin Hwa in that he thought the shift of the inquiry from how the matter might appear to a reasonable man to whether the judge thinks there is a sufficient possibility of bias was [...] "a very significant point of departure". The real likelihood test is met as long as the court is satisfied that there is a sufficient degree of possibility of bias. Although this a lower standard than satisfaction on a balance of probabilities, this is actually directed at mitigating the sheer difficulty of proving actual bias, especially given its insidious and often subconscious nature. The reasonable suspicion test, however, is met if the court is satisfied that a reasonable member of the public could harbour a reasonable suspicion of bias even though the court itself thought there was no real danger of this on the facts. The difference is that the driver behind this test is the strong public interest in ensuring public confidence in the administration of justice. As of September 2011, the Court of Appeal of Singapore had not yet expressed a view as to whether the position taken in Tang Kin Hwa or Shankar Alan is preferable.|$|E
5000|$|Do not confuse {{altruism}} with kindness, {{good will}} or {{respect for the}} rights of others. These are not primaries, but consequences, which, in fact, altruism makes impossible. The irreducible primary of altruism, the basic absolute is self-sacrifice - which means self-immolation, self-abnegation, self-denial self-destruction - which means the self as a standard of evil, the selfless as a standard of the good.Do not hide behind such superficialities as whether you should or should not give a dime to a beggar. This is not the issue. <b>The</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> you do or do {{not have the right to}} exist without giving him that dime. <b>The</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> you must keep buying your life, dime by dime, from any beggar who might choose to approach you. <b>The</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> the need of others is the first mortgage on your life and the moral purpose of your existence. <b>The</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> man is to be regarded as a sacrificial animal.

50|$|The {{doctrine}} of constructive receipt {{is often used}} {{in combination with the}} {{doctrine of}} cash equivalence {{in order to determine the}} timing of receipt of income items. A constructive receipt issue arises when the taxpayer has not actually received the income, and <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> the income is substantially available to the taxpayer such that receipt will occur for tax timing purposes. A cash equivalence issue occurs when a taxpayer receives a payment as some sort of promise to pay, and <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> the promise is sufficiently definite as to be considered equivalent to receipt of cash income.|$|E

5000|$|Early {{assessments}} of the probability of success of the technology development and challenges of a commercial space station pointed {{to the importance of}} factors largely beyond Bigelow's control.

5000|$|As we {{recently}} observed {{with respect to}} a determination of duty, however, [...] "foreseeability is a question of fact for the jury."

50|$|There is {{some debate}} in the field {{as to whether the}} mind is best viewed as a huge array of small but {{individually}} feeble elements (i.e. neurons), or as a collection of higher-level structures such as symbols, schemes, plans, and rules. The former view uses connectionism to study the mind, whereas the latter emphasizes symbolic computations.
