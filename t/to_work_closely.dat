5|$|Robert DeLeo, against Atlantic Records' wishes, {{insisted that}} he and his brother Dean DeLeo produce the record themselves, which began {{production}} in early 2009. Because recording took place during breaks in the band's touring schedule, production took nearly ten months to complete. Three studios were used simultaneously, including Robert's home studio and Eric Kretz's Bomb Shelter Studios. Scott Weiland recorded vocals at his own Lavish Studios. Don Was was brought in as an additional producer to help keep the band's separate recording sessions in sync, as well as <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>closely</b> with Weiland during the recording of his vocals. The album was completed in December 2009, and mixing and mastering were finished by February 2010.|$|E

5|$|The {{power of}} Tudor monarchs, {{including}} Henry, was 'whole' and 'entire', ruling, as they claimed, {{by the grace}} of God alone. The crown could also rely on the exclusive use of those functions that constituted the royal prerogative. These included acts of diplomacy (including royal marriages), declarations of war, management of the coinage, the issue of royal pardons and the power to summon and dissolve parliament as and when required. Nevertheless, as evident during Henry's break with Rome, the monarch worked within established limits, whether legal or financial, that forced him <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>closely</b> with both the nobility and parliament (representing the gentry).|$|E

5|$|Although {{there are}} no records as to the designs of the early steam engines {{produced}} by the Mars Works, Evans's most famous engine design appeared around 1812. Called the Columbian Engine as a patriotic gesture, it {{would prove to be}} the most advanced and successful steam engine design created by Evans—he brought to bear his now extensive experience in designing and building high-pressure steam engines. This horizontally oriented engine allowed the crankshaft and piston rod <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>closely</b> together {{at one end of the}} machine, thus reducing the need for a heavy working beam like those required for conventional engines. The piston rod itself was kept working to a straight line while by a new type of linkage wherein two sets of pivoted bars guided the movements of the working bar. This linkage is still known as the Evans straight-line linkage, though it was superseded within a few years by more precise straight line mechanisms. The Columbian was also the culmination of the grasshopper-style of steam engine. Perfected designs like the Columbian saw a popularization of the grasshopper-style and its wide use in a range of applications. In 1813 he made the decision to introduce a condenser to the Columbian design. This significantly cut the running cost to the engine, and at this point his engines were as efficient and powerful as low-pressure Watt-Boulton designs, yet far cheaper to build and smaller in size. Within a year 27 Columbian engines were operating or under construction in applications ranging from sawmilling and grain milling to the manufacturing of paper, wire and wool.|$|E
