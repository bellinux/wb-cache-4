5|$|Arya, who {{has been}} living as a beggar {{in the streets of}} King's Landing since her escape from the Lannisters, learns a crowd is {{gathering}} at the Great Sept of Baelor, where her father will be judged before the gods, and in order <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> crowd, climbs onto the statue of Baelor the Blessed. As he is dragged through the crowd, Ned notices Arya on the statue, and alerts the Night's Watch recruiter Yoren to her location. With Sansa, Cersei, Joffrey and the Small Council looking over him, Ned confesses to treason and swears fealty to Joffrey in front of the crowd. Satisfied, Sansa and Cersei ask Joffrey to spare Ned as Joffrey promised, but Joffrey breaks his promise and orders Ned to be executed. As Sansa watches in horror, Cersei, Varys and the Small Council attempt to intervene, and Arya tries to rescue Ned, only to be stopped by Yoren, who prevents her from seeing her father's execution. When he sees that Arya has been rescued, Ned accepts his fate and is beheaded by Ser Ilyn Payne.|$|E
25|$|The BMD-2 {{is fully}} amphibious, it can swim after {{switching}} {{on the two}} electric bilge pumps, erecting the two piece trim vane which improves vehicle's stability and displacement in water and prevents the water from flooding {{the bow of the}} tank and switching the driver's periscope for a swimming periscope that enables the driver <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> trim vane.|$|E
25|$|The most {{noticeable}} {{change for the}} Mackenzies was {{the replacement of the}} forward /50 calibre Mk 22 guns of the St. Laurent design with a dual Vickers 3-inch/70 calibre Mk 6 gun mount and the presence of a fire-control director atop the bridge superstructure. The bridge was raised one full deck higher than on previous classes in order <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> new gun mount. The class did retain the rear dual 3-inch/50 calibre gun mount and for anti-submarine warfare, the class was provided with two Mk 10 Limbo mortars. The ships were initially fitted with Mark 43 torpedoes to supplement their anti-submarine capability, but were quickly upgraded to the Mark 44 launched from a modified depth charge thrower. This was to give the destroyers the ability to combat submarines from a distance.|$|E

25|$|The PT-76 is amphibious, {{it has a}} flat, boat-shaped hull {{which is}} hermetical and ensures minimal {{resistance}} when the tank is afloat. It can swim after switching on the two electric bilge pumps, erecting the trim vane which improves the vehicle's stability and displacement {{in the water and}} prevents water from flooding into the bow of the tank. Switching the driver's periscope for a swimming periscope enables the driver <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> trim vane. When not in use the trim vane is stowed {{in the front of the}} bow over the barrel of the main gun and serves as additional armor. Bilge pumps keep the tank afloat even if it leaks or is damaged. There is a manual bilge pump for emergency use. The tank is propelled through the water by two hydrojets, one on each side of the hull, with the inlets underneath the hull and the outlets at the rear. There are also additional assistant water-jet inlets on both sides of the hull over the last road wheels. The rear outlets have lids that can be fully or partially closed, redirecting the water stream to the forward-directed outlets at the sides of the hull, thus enabling the vehicle to turn or go in reverse. To turn to the left for example, the left water-jet is covered, to turn to the right, the right water-jet is covered. To make a 180° turn, one water-jet sucks in water while the other pushes it out. This system was designed by N. Konowalow. It is the same system as the one used in the BTR-50 APC, which was based on the PT-76. The tank can swim at up to 10.2km/h and has a range of 100km. It can cross most water obstacles and can also swim in the sea. However, its amphibious design makes it disproportionally large for a vehicle of its weight and allows less armor protection than other light tanks.|$|E
500|$|The main {{guns were}} {{controlled}} by an Admiralty Fire Control Clock Mk I that used data {{derived from the}} manually-operated director-control tower and the separate rangefinder situated above the bridge. They had no capability for anti-aircraft fire and the anti-aircraft guns were aimed solely by eye. [...] and Hereward saw {{the introduction of a}} new style of bridge that would become standard on all Royal Navy fleet destroyers from the [...] through to the [...] of 1944. This was necessary as Hereward was fitted with a prototype twin-gun mounting that had a trunnion height [...] higher than the previous weapons, therefore it was necessary to raise the wheelhouse to allow the helmsman <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> top. Raising the wheelhouse meant it had to be placed in front of, rather than underneath, the bridge, and it was given angled sides, resulting in a characteristic wedge shape with a sloping roof.|$|E

[...] Gravity feed instruments require less air pressure for suction as the gravity pulls the paint into the mixing chamber. [...] Typically instruments with the finest mist atomization and detail requirements use this method since less air pressure allows for finer control paint flow and less overspray. [...] Side- and bottom-feed instruments allow the artist <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> top, with the former sometimes offering left-handed and right-handed options to suit the artist. [...] A bottom feed airbrush typically holds a larger capacity of paint than the other types, and is often preferable for larger scale work such as automotive applications and tee-shirt design.|$|E

2500|$|In 2008, {{when it was}} {{announced}} that both Ricky and Bianca were being reintroduced, executive producer Diederick Santer described them as [...] "a hugely popular and well-loved partnership on the show". Other media sources branded them two of [...] "the most popular characters on the soap" [...] and an [...] "iconic couple". However, Hazel Davis of The Guardian was critical about their reintroduction. She commented, [...] "It's a no-brainer on the show's part. Last year, ratings for EastEnders were at an all-time low. But, just for once, wouldn't it be nice if a soap opera actually introduced new characters with verve and staying power rather than digging up the oldies?". Conversely, Mark Wright from The Stage said that the decision to bring these much-loved characters back [...] "is very welcome". He comments, [...] "Previous returns have been all about the numbers and not about the story, which is the cardinal sin in this game. While there is, of course, the resultant publicity that comes with any new or returning soap character being announced, the storyline possibilities for Ricky and Bianca arriving back in the Square are good. Bianca is turning up with a brood of kids in tow, all belonging to different fathers (how many of them can we expect <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> next couple of years?). Like it! Ricky arrives with a glamorous WAG [...] on his arm. [...] I sense friction along the way, especially when Ricky realises he never got over Bianca (how could he?). All very well thought through and positive. This sounds like a soap getting back in touch with its roots.".|$|E
