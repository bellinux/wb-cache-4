25|$|A seminal {{paper by}} Dyson came in 1966, when, {{together}} with Andrew Lenard and independently of Elliott H. Lieb and Walter Thirring, he proved rigorously that the exclusion principle plays the main {{role in the}} stability of bulk matter. Hence, {{it is not the}} electromagnetic repulsion between outer-shell orbital electrons which prevents two wood blocks <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>left</b> {{on top of each other}} from coalescing into a single piece, but rather it is the exclusion principle applied to electrons and protons that generates the classical macroscopic normal force. In condensed matter physics, Dyson also analysed the phase transition of the Ising model in 1 dimension and spin waves.|$|E
25|$|Sublimation is {{when water}} {{molecules}} directly leave {{the surface of}} ice without first becoming liquid water. Sublimation accounts for the slow mid-winter disappearance of ice and snow at temperatures too low to cause melting. Antarctica shows this effect to a unique degree because it {{is by far the}} continent with the lowest rate of precipitation on Earth. As a result, there are large areas where millennial layers of snow have sublimed, leaving behind whatever non-volatile materials they had contained. This is extremely valuable to certain scientific disciplines, a dramatic example being the collection of meteorites <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>left</b> exposed in unparalleled numbers and excellent states of preservation.|$|E

25|$|While {{the residue}} in the jar is not {{definitive}} proof of winemaking, it does provide strong {{evidence for the}} possibility. Grapes are unique in {{being one of the}} few natural sources for tartaric acid, which is the most abundant acid in wine and often crystallizes into deposits <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>left</b> in containers that have held wine. Grapes also have a natural propensity to break down into alcohol by a process that we now know as fermentation where the yeast on the grape skins metabolize the sugar in the grapes into alcohol. This happens most readily in a close container that is kept in room temperature. Whether or not the action was deliberate, storing grapes in jars that were then embedded in the floor would have created conditions favorable for wine production.|$|E
25|$|Concerning rural water supply, in 2004 the {{government}} established {{a policy of}} decentralization, foreseeing to transfer the responsibility for operating and maintaining rural water systems from the state to local communities. Implementation has initially been slow, but picked up over time. In March 2009 a decree transferred the ownership of piped systems in small towns outside the ONEA service area to municipalities, which in turn contract out operation and maintenance to local private operators or to ONEA. According to the World Bank, before decentralization the development of rural services suffered from an overly centralized planning and investment process, which bypassed local governments. Rural water supply was, {{and to some extent}} still is, characterized by a diversity of project rules, implementation approaches, and technical options <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>left</b> to the discretion of financing agencies and NGOs.|$|E
25|$|Named after John Tyndall, Tyndallization is an {{obsolete}} and lengthy process {{designed to}} reduce the level of activity of sporulating bacteria <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>left</b> by a simple boiling water method. The process involves boiling for a period (typically 20 minutes) at atmospheric pressure, cooling, incubating for a day, then repeating the process {{a total of three}} to four times. The incubation periods are to allow heat-resistant spores surviving the previous boiling period to germinate to form the heat-sensitive vegetative (growing) stage, which can be killed by the next boiling step. This is effective because many spores are stimulated to grow by the heat shock. The procedure only works for media that can support bacterial growth, and will not sterilize non-nutritive substrates like water. Tyndallization is also ineffective against prions.|$|E

25|$|Even by 1912, much of Upper Rochelle {{remained}} sparsely populated. The Wykagyl and Quaker Ridge stations fronted {{dirt roads}} {{and were not}} served by public transportation. Ironically, most of the real-estate development that did occur {{at the time was}} attracting wealthier residents who owned their own automobiles, frequently chauffeur-driven, and used them instead of public-transportation for local trips. While the populations of some communities served by the NYWB did grow between 1912 and 1937, the growth was not large enough or fast enough to provide sufficient business for the railroad, and service was discontinued on December 31, 1937. The only signs of the railway <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>left</b> {{can be found in a}} few remaining station houses, most notably the Quaker Ridge station, currently a private residence, and the former Wykagyl station, now part of a shopping center.|$|E
25|$|Each Okazaki {{fragment}} is {{preceded by}} an RNA primer, which is {{displaced by the}} procession of the next Okazaki fragment during synthesis. RNase H recognizes the DNA:RNA hybrids that are created {{by the use of}} RNA primers and is responsible for removing these from the replicated strand, leaving behind a primer:template junction. DNA polymerase α, recognizes these sites and elongates the breaks left by primer removal. In eukaryotic cells, a small amount of the DNA segment immediately upstream of the RNA primer is also displaced, creating a flap structure. This flap is then cleaved by endonucleases. At the replication fork, the gap in DNA after removal of the flap is sealed by DNA ligase I, which repairs the nicks <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>left</b> between the 3'-OH and 5'phosphate of the newly synthesized strand. Owing to the relatively short nature of the eukaryotic Okazaki fragment, DNA replication synthesis occurring discontinuously on the lagging strand is less efficient and more time consuming than leading-strand synthesis. DNA synthesis is complete once all RNA primers are removed and nicks are repaired.|$|E
25|$|Dreams do {{not involve}} {{actually}} sensing a stimulus because, as discussed, the senses do not work as they normally do during sleep. In dreams, sensation is still involved, but in an altered manner than when awake. Aristotle explains the phenomenon that occurs when a person stares at a moving stimulus such as the waves in a body of water. When they look away from that stimulus, the next thing they look at appears to be moving in a wave like motion. When a person perceives a stimulus and the stimulus {{is no longer the}} focus of their attention, it leaves an impression. When the body is awake and the senses are functioning properly, a person constantly encounters new stimuli to sense and so the impressions left from previously perceived stimuli become irrelevant. However, during sleep the impressions stimuli made throughout the day become noticed because there are not new sensory experiences to distract from these impressions that were made. So, dreams result from these lasting impressions. Since impressions are all <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>left</b> and not the exact stimuli, dreams will not resemble the actual experience that occurred when awake.|$|E

[...] The well is not an ice core, but {{the age of the}} ice that was melted is known, so the age of the recovered particles can be determined.

Torres returned to action on 3 January 2009 as a substitute with a goal in the 2–0 win over Preston North End, his first in the FA Cup. He scored two late goals for Liverpool to secure a 2–0 victory over Chelsea on 1 February 2009.
