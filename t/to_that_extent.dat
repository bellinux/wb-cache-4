25|$|Some {{criticisms of}} the {{membrane}} theory developed in the 1930s, based on observations {{such as the ability}} of some cells to swell and increase their surface area by a factor of 1000. A lipid layer cannot stretch <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>extent</b> without becoming a patchwork (thereby losing its barrier properties). Such criticisms stimulated continued studies on protoplasm as the principal agent determining cell permeability properties. In 1938, Fischer and Suer proposed that water in the protoplasm is not free but in a chemically combined form, and that the protoplasm represents a combination of protein, salt and water. They demonstrated the basic similarity between swelling in living tissues and the swelling of gelatin and fibrin gels. Dimitri Nasonov (1944) viewed proteins as the central components responsible for many properties of the cell, including electrical properties.|$|E

500|$|Since {{its first}} appearance, Captain Scarlet has been criticised for its filming, {{which has been}} {{considered}} too static due {{to the problem of}} moving the Supermarionation puppets convincingly. The return to a 25-minute episode format, as had been the case with series preceding Thunderbirds, has been blamed for a perceived drop in quality of storytelling and a lack of subplots. Concerns have also been raised about the development of the characters: in a 1986 interview, script editor Tony Barwick described Captain Scarlet as [...] "hard-nosed stuff" [...] that lacked humour, stating, [...] "It was all for the American market and <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>extent</b> there was no deep characterisation.

500|$|Although fair {{criticism}} {{has been treated}} as a defence to scandalizing the court in some cases, the Court of Appeal preferred to view it as an element of liability, though it cautioned that [...] "the precise characterisation {{of the concept of}} fair criticism was not fully canvassed before us ... Accordingly, our views on this point must necessarily be taken, <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>extent,</b> to be provisional in nature." [...] The Court said that adopting this approach ensures that an alleged contemnor is not disadvantaged with regard to the burden of proof: [...] "If the concept of fair criticism relates to liability, then the evidential burden would be on the party relying on it. The legal burden, on the other hand, would be on the Respondent to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the impugned statement does not constitute fair criticism, and that it presents a real risk of undermining public confidence in the administration of justice. If, however, the concept of fair criticism constitutes a defence, then the legal burden would shift to the alleged contemnor to show on the balance of probabilities that the impugned statement amounts to fair criticism." ...|$|E

500|$|Ian Hunt concurs {{that offers}} may be {{considered}} coercive, and claims that, whatever form the interventions take, they {{may be considered}} coercive [...] "when they are socially corrigible influences over action that diminish an agent's freedom overall". He accepts that a possible objection to his claim is {{that at least some}} coercive offers do seemingly increase the freedom of their recipients. For instance, in the thought experiment of the lecherous millionaire, a millionaire offers a mother money for treatment for her son's life-threatening illness in exchange for her becoming the millionaire's mistress. Joel Feinberg considers the offer coercive, but in offering a possibility of treatment, the millionaire has increased the options available to the mother, and thus her freedom. For Hunt, Feinberg [...] "overlooks the fact that the millionaire's offer opens the option of [...] saving her child on condition that the option of not being [...] mistress is closed". Hunt does not see the mother as more free; [...] "while it is clear that she has a greater capacity to pursue her interests as a parent once the offer has been made, and <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>extent</b> can be regarded as freer, it is clear also that her capacity to pursue her sexual interests may have been diminished." [...] Every coercive proposal, whether threat, offer or throffer, according to Hunt, contains a simultaneous loss and gain of freedom. Kristjánsson, by contrast, argues that Feinberg's account of [...] "coercive offers" [...] is flawed because these are not offers at all, but throffers.|$|E
