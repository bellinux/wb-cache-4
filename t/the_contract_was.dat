5|$|Competition for <b>the</b> <b>contract</b> <b>was</b> {{so fierce}} that it {{involved}} last-minute discounts, offers of free parts and allegations of sabotage.

Metro-Cammell based its design on the Hong Kong MTR M-Train EMU and proposed to use the GEC propulsion system had they won the contract. Metro-Cammell also delivered a concept mock-up and was originally the favourite to win the contract. However, analysts became concerned that a measuring error involving the London Underground 1983 Stock during the evaluation period could jeopardise their bid.|$|E
