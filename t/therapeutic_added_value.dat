40|$|Background: High-risk {{medical devices}} {{may not always}} provide a <b>therapeutic</b> <b>added</b> <b>value</b> to patients. In Europe, no proof of {{efficacy}} is required to receive a CE label, {{making it difficult for}} policymakers to decide on reimbursement of (often expensive) high-risk medical devices. We explore, {{within the framework of the}} European legislation, the possibilities at a national level for a guided introduction of such devices. Research design and Methods: HTA and legal experts worked in close collaboration with medical specialists and government representatives making a legal analysis of what is possible under the (revised) European and national legislation. Results: At national level, measures for a better evidence-based introduction can be taken that are not in contradiction with the European regulation. From a legal point of view, all restrictive measures must be justified, necessary and proportional. Several measures are possible, a. o. making use of reference centres, applying the IDEAL framework or the 6 -step plan set up by the Dutch Order of Medical Specialists. Conclusions: Within the framework of the (revised) European legislation, measures at national level can be taken to temporarily restrict and follow up the use of high-risk medical devices with a greater focus on the <b>therapeutic</b> <b>added</b> <b>value</b> for the patients.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe European Transparency Directive {{requires}} that reimbursement decisions of member states are {{taken in a}} transparent, objective, and verifiable way within strict timelines. We investigated whether evidence of therapeutic value was a factor affecting the Belgian pharmaceutical reimbursement decision without compromising the respect of strict timelines. MethodsWe analyzed 824 reimbursement submissions within the period 2002 to 2004. ResultsOnly 67 submissions claimed <b>added</b> <b>therapeutic</b> <b>value</b> versus available alternatives: if the applicant failed to prove <b>added</b> <b>value</b> the odds ratio (OR) for a negative decision increased significantly: OR = 9. 1 (2. 3 – 35. 6). There were 399 “limited evidence” submissions (new medicinal products or new indications) and 425 “extended evidence” submissions (mainly line extensions). The OR for a negative decision decreased significantly for submissions with extended evidence: OR = 0. 18 (0. 12 – 0. 27). The median time to decision was 175 days.

40|$|Background:Background: In the Netherlands, {{decisions}} about the reimbursement of new pharmaceuticals are based on cost effectiveness, as well as therapeutic value and budget impact. Since 1 January 2005, drug manufacturers are formally required to substantiate the cost effectiveness of drugs that have <b>therapeutic</b> <b>added</b> <b>value</b> in comparison with existing ones through pharmacoeconomic evaluations. Dutch guidelines for pharmacoeconomic research provide methods guidance, ensuring consistency in both the evidence and the decision-making process about drug reimbursement. Abstract: Aim:Aim: This study reviewed the methodological quality of all 21 formally required pharmacoeconomic evaluations of new pharmaceuticals between 1 January 2005 and 1 October 2008, and verified whether these evaluations complied with pharmacoeconomic guidelines. Abstract: Methods:Methods: Data {{on the quality of}} the pharmacoeconomic evaluations were extracted from the pharmacoeconomic reports published by the Dutch Health Care Insurance Board (CVZ). The Board's newsletters provided information on the advice to, and reimbursement decisions made by, the Dutch Minister of Health. All data extraction was carried out by two independent reviewers, and descriptive analyses were conducted. Abstract: Results:Results: The methodological quality was sound in only 8 of the 21 pharmacoeconomic evaluations. In most cases, the perspective of analysis, the comparator drugs, and the reporting of both total and incremental costs and effects were correct. However, drug indication, form (i. e. cost utility/cost effectiveness) and time horizon of the evaluations were frequently flawed. Moreover, the costs and effects of the pharmaceuticals were not always analysed correctly, and modelling studies were often non-transparent. Twelve drugs were reimbursed, and nine were not. Abstract: Conclusions:Conclusions: The compliance with pharmacoeconomic guidelines in economic evaluations of new pharmaceuticals can be improved. This would improve the methodological quality of the pharmacoeconomic evaluations and ensure consistency in the evidence and the decision-making process for drug reimbursement in the Netherlands.

40|$|Innovation in the {{development}} of new drugs has to balance the needs of health actors and administrators, the pharmaceutical industry and patients. Differing perspectives on what constitutes an innovation, where research and development should be directed and how new drugs should be evaluated and priced cause ongoing tensions within the regulatory framework. In the current climate, where Europe’s health systems face rising demand for health services and increasingly restricted resources, the efficiency of pharmaceutical regulation and drug development is under even greater scrutiny. How can regulation foster innovation and industry growth while also serving the public health needs of society, and what is the EU’s role in pursuing this objective? Drawing on a provision which formerly existed in Norwegian pharmaceutical legislation, this article explores the potential of a medical need clause (MNC) in addressing these issues.

This exploration warrants the conclusion that apart from the absence of non-verbal communication, the placebo effect of Internet contacts will gradually catch up with that of vis-à-vis contacts as soon as these new types of contact have shown to be effective as well.

Numerous messages about <b>added</b> <b>values</b> of food products are communicated by and to different actors, values such as convenience regarding fast-food, luxury regarding meals, products without chemical additives, health, quality, taste, what the package looks like, exclusiveness, tradition/story-telling/, and many others. Food producers, wholesalers, retailers, and end-consumers constitute some of these actors. However, the concept of <b>added</b> <b>value</b> and the relationships between the different aspects are unclear and illusive. There is a need to explore as well as clarify definitions and dimensions. Therefore, the aim of this article is to develop a conceptual framework which explores definitions and discussions associated with <b>added</b> <b>values</b> of food products. Traditionally, the literature has made strict and categorical distinctions between core <b>values</b> and <b>added</b> <b>values.</b> However, we stress that this traditional view needs to be challenged. For food products we argue that core values cannot be clearly distinguished from <b>added</b> <b>values.</b> We argue that not only the end consumer but all actors involved in the supply chain contribute to the overall realization of the <b>added</b> <b>value,</b> i. e. all actors must perceive, appreciate, value and realize the <b>added</b> <b>value.</b> Only then may the <b>added</b> <b>value</b> result in willingness to purchase the products, increased market share or strengthened position at different markets...|$|R

As an effort to increase the profitability of the industry niching was discussed as possible for success and earning money on <b>added</b> <b>value,</b> which is the theme running all through this thesis. The theories this thesis rests on are basically theories about a high quality service, which is the main foundation for any success: no high quality offered, no success. The high competition in this industry {{is one of the}} corner stones of the thesis as well due to the heavy competition in the investigated industry. A third important and clear corner stone are the theories about rules of public procurement which Government owned, or partially owned companies, has to follow. The fact that <b>added</b> <b>value</b> is a subgroup of customer value is natural, but in difference to <b>added</b> <b>value,</b> the concept of customer value is clearly defined, while the meaning of <b>added</b> <b>value</b> is rather ambiguous and undefined. The theories about <b>added</b> <b>value</b> stretches from, spoken from Telia as telephone answering services to co-production of values, some theories even say that <b>added</b> <b>value</b> can only be defined by customers and not by the industry offering it. In this thesis, 25 industrial companies was to be interviewed, of which 14 accepted or had their key responsible in question available. This gives a response frequency of nearly 60 %. Five out of the 14 answering companies have to follow the rules of public procurement. The interviews have been carried out by Perspektiv Undersökningar by phone during the fortnight before mid summer 2004.

In this study, {{the aim was to}} develop a method based on <b>added</b> <b>values</b> and risks for comparison and evaluation of stormwater systems. How <b>added</b> <b>values</b> are classified differs from case to case. The approach and the purpose of the analysis also affects the evaluation of <b>added</b> <b>values.</b> In this report <b>added</b> <b>values</b> are defined as:A value, for an individual, an organisation or the environment, other than the object's main intended purpose. In this report five different categories of risks and <b>added</b> <b>values</b> were studied, namely: environment, economy, technology, health and socioculture. In the analysis of <b>added</b> <b>values</b> the data collection was made in a questionnaire. A group was appointed the task to compile the answers and evaluate the outcome and identify the <b>added</b> <b>values</b> generated by the stormwater system. The risk assessment was conducted by estimating probabilities and consequences of a range of identified risk sources. The results were presented in a matrix. The methodology was tested in a case study where two stormwater systems were evaluated and compared to each other. One of the systems was a swale system and the other was a piped storm drainage system. The result showed no major differences with respect to <b>added</b> <b>values,</b> on the contrary, the risk assessment indicated some significant differences. The case study confirms that the developed and evaluated tool is applicable for this type of evaluation and comparison between different stormwater systems in diverse surroundings. The method, developed in this study can with advantage be used as a complementing tool when evaluating different stormwater system options. Validerat; 20150609 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|R
40|$|Agricultural {{producers}} are pursuing many methods {{by which to}} <b>add</b> <b>value.</b> Typically, some type of change in commodity form is used to <b>add</b> <b>value.</b> However, there exist methods by which <b>added</b> <b>value</b> occurs through intensive management practices, particularly in seedstock production. We investigated the brand premium to a producer-owned quality-based bred heifer program. Results indicated that producers garner in access of a $ 100 /head premium, while potentially reducing future search/advertising costs through building brand loyalty.

40|$|Abstract: This article {{discusses}} {{the issues of}} increasing the perception of measurements {{for the creation of}} corporate value by introducing the concept of superior size, as well as relativization for e. g. evaluation of the benchmark. Consideration is also given to the connection between measurements used for creating added, market and income corporate value. The application section contains surveys carried out on listed companies, leading in the creation and destruction of <b>added</b> <b>value</b> in manufacturing. The findings have helped to assess the medium–term correlation of changes in superior market <b>added</b> <b>value</b> with changes in company capitalization and the economic <b>added</b> <b>value</b> and income value relative to market value.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an empirical investigation on fluctuation and trend of <b>added</b> <b>value</b> changes {{in oil and}} gas industries and their products and also to anticipate the current <b>added</b> <b>value</b> of these industries. For this aim, fluctuation of <b>added</b> <b>values</b> of different subsidiaries such as oil group products, exporting crude oil, production of gas and petroleum is investigated over the period 1959 - 2004. The study selects the best network to anticipate <b>added</b> <b>value</b> in subsidiaries of energy section. For the training and testing the network, all data are divided into two groups. To define input layer neurons number which are equal to auto regressive vector rank in ARMA method, the rank of auto regressive (p) and mobile mean (q) have been used according to proposed method of Pesaran & Pesaran. The simulated results have been extracted by using neural networks, in feed forward network which had low compatibility with the real <b>added</b> <b>value...</b>|$|R
