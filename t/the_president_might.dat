5|$|One {{question}} of constitutional interpretation that was highlighted during the parliamentary debates pertained {{to the former}} Article 22H which had been incorrectly inserted into the Constitution by the Constitution (Amendment) Act 1991 in January 1991. Article 22H(1) provided that <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>might,</b> acting in his discretion, withhold his assent to any bill passed by Parliament (other than a bill to which Article 5(2A) applied) if the bill provided for the circumvention or curtailment of the discretionary powers conferred upon him by the Constitution. At that time, Article 5(2A), which entrenched certain core constitutional provisions (of which Article 22H(1) was one) by requiring {{the approval of the}} electorate at a national referendum for their amendment, had not been brought into force.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{widespread}} adoption of transcontinental air {{travel in the}} second half of the twentieth century, Congress began meeting year-round. Since that time, it has always been in session on every occasion when <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>might</b> otherwise have perceived the need to call Congress into extraordinary session.|$|E
25|$|Burton {{likewise}} {{held that}} Congress, not the President, possessed {{the power to}} act in emergencies because it had exclusive power to pass legislation. He relied on the language and legislative history of the Taft–Hartley Act to find that Congress had not authorized seizure of plants involved in a labor dispute without express legislative authorization. He hedged, however, on whether <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>might,</b> in more extreme circumstances, have authority to act.|$|E
5000|$|Law and the Long War: The Future of Justice in the Age of Terror (2008) is Wittes's {{analysis}} of how America {{came to an}} impasse {{in the debate over}} liberty, human rights, and counterterrorism and draws a road map for how the country and <b>the</b> next <b>president</b> <b>might</b> move forward.|$|R
6000|$|The {{young girl}} seemed {{scarcely}} to comprehend, yet her face remained pale and thoughtful.

Of course, my duty is simply to"-- ...|$|R
50|$|Next, Article One, Section 3, Clause 5 {{provides}} {{that in the}} absence of <b>the</b> vice <b>president</b> <b>the</b> Senate could choose a president pro tempore to temporarily preside and perform the duties of the chair. Since vice presidents presided routinely in the 18th and 19th centuries, the Senate thought it necessary to choose a president pro tempore only for the limited periods when <b>the</b> vice <b>president</b> <b>might</b> be ill or otherwise absent. As a result, the Senate frequently elected several presidents pro tempore during a single session.|$|R
25|$|Frankfurter {{avoided the}} {{sweeping}} {{condemnation of the}} administration's claims that Black and Douglas had offered. While he would {{not rule out the}} possibility that <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>might</b> acquire the power to take certain actions by a long course of conduct unobjected to by Congress, he found the statutory history persuasive evidence that Congress had not acquiesced, much less authorized seizure of private property in the absence of a formal declaration of war.|$|E
25|$|In early June 2008, the White House {{signaled}} <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>might</b> {{be willing}} to sign {{a modified version of}} the Webb bill, along with the war funding bill, if transferability between spouses and dependents was added onto the new GI Bill. This would make the benefits more valuable to career military personal that would like to pay for their spouse or child's education. On June 19, this provision was added to the war funding bill. With the added transferability provisions for continued military service, McCain said he now supported the bill, because it encouraged additional service beyond three years, mitigating his earlier concerns. McCain, who had not voted in the Senate since April 8, was campaigning in Ohio on June 26 and was not present for the final senate vote on the bill, which passed 92–6 (The only other senator not voting was Ted Kennedy, who was recovering after surgery to remove a brain tumor). Bush signed the war funding bill, along with the veterans education benefits, into law on June 30, 2008.|$|E
500|$|Although Parr had {{requested}} a stretcher, none were ready at the hospital, {{and it did}} not normally keep a stretcher at the emergency room's entrance. Reagan exited the limousine and insisted on walking. Reagan acted casual and smiled at onlookers as he walked in. While he entered the hospital unassisted, once inside the president complained of difficulty breathing, his knees buckled, and he went down on one knee; Parr and others assisted him into the emergency room. The Physician to the President, Daniel Ruge, arrived with Reagan; believing that <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>might</b> have had a heart attack, he insisted that the hospital's trauma team, and not he himself or specialists from elsewhere, operate on him as it would treat any other patient. When a hospital employee asked Reagan aide Michael Deaver for the patient's name and address, only when Deaver stated [...] "1600 Pennsylvania" [...] did the worker realize that the President of the United States was in the emergency room.|$|E
25|$|The Office of Censorship {{published}} {{a code of}} conduct for newspapers, magazines, and broadcasters. The office did not use government censors to preapprove all articles and radio programs. It relied on voluntary cooperation to avoid subjects, such as troop movements, weather forecasts, and the travels of <b>the</b> <b>President,</b> that <b>might</b> aid <b>the</b> enemy. Journalists {{did not have to}} publish positive propaganda, unlike during World War I.|$|R
50|$|The only {{official}} reason {{given for}} the denial was that <b>the</b> Hungarian <b>president's</b> visit <b>might</b> have constituted a security risk. Slovak prime minister Robert Fico had claimed that police {{would be unable to}} prevent Slovak extremist groups from disturbing the ceremony.|$|R
25|$|In this environment, Ross led a {{delegation}} to Washington in March 1834 {{to try to}} negotiate alternatives to removal. Ross made several proposals; however, the Cherokee Nation may not have approved any of Ross's plans, nor was there reasonable expectation that Jackson would settle for any agreement short of removal. These offers, coupled with the lengthy cross-continental trip, indicated that Ross's strategy was to prolong negotiations on removal indefinitely. There was the possibility that <b>the</b> next <b>President</b> <b>might</b> be more favorably inclined.|$|R
500|$|Considerable {{arrangements}} {{had been}} made for the President's security. [...] Exposition police were stationed at the doors; detectives from the Buffalo police guarded the aisle. In addition to McKinley's usual Secret Service agent, George Foster, two other agents {{had been assigned to}} the Buffalo trip because of Cortelyou's security concerns. Babcock was made nervous by a joke at lunch in an Exposition restaurant that <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>might</b> be shot during the reception. He had arranged for a dozen artillerymen to attend the reception in full-dress uniform, intending to use them as decoration. Instead, he had them stand in the aisle with instructions to close on any suspicious-looking person who might approach the President. These men were not trained in police work, and served to crowd the area in front of the President and obstruct the views of the detectives and Secret Service. [...] At such events, Foster usually stood just to the left and behind McKinley. Milburn wished to stand to McKinley's left to be able to introduce anyone he knew in the line to the President, and Foster and another agent instead stood across the aisle from McKinley.|$|E
2500|$|After Cuba {{shot down}} two unarmed Brothers to the Rescue planes in 1996, killing three Americans and a U.S. resident, a bi-partisan {{coalition}} in the United States Congress approved the Helms-Burton Act. The Title III {{of this law}} also states that any non-U.S. company that [...] "knowingly trafficks in property in Cuba confiscated without compensation from a U.S. person" [...] can be subjected to litigation and that company's leadership can be barred from entry into the United States. Sanctions may also be applied to non-U.S. companies trading with Cuba. This restriction also applies to maritime shipping, as ships docking at Cuban ports {{are not allowed to}} dock at U.S. ports for six months. It's important to note that this title includes waiver authority, so that <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>might</b> suspend its application. This waiver must be renewed every six months and traditionally it has been.|$|E
2500|$|The president's role {{is largely}} political, {{preparing}} {{the work of}} the European Council, organising and chairing its meetings, seeking to find consensus among its members and reporting to the European Parliament after each meeting; the president will also [...] "at his level and in that capacity, ensure the external representation of the Union on issues concerning its common foreign and security policy, without prejudice to the powers of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security". Some overlap between the roles of the President of the European Council, the President of the Commission, and the High Representative—notably in foreign policy—leaves uncertainty about how much influence the President of the European Council will acquire. There is further concern over whether the President will have sufficient personnel and resources to fulfil the duties of the post effectively and that, in lacking a ministry, <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>might</b> become a [...] "play ball" [...] between EU leaders.|$|E
5000|$|For example, {{consider}} the phrase [...] "The 43rd <b>President</b> of <b>the</b> United States of America": while <b>the</b> 43rd <b>President</b> of <b>the</b> United States is actually George W. Bush, things {{might have been}} different. Bush might have lost the election, meaning that <b>the</b> 43rd <b>President</b> <b>might</b> have been Al Gore or Ralph Nader instead. (How remote these possible worlds are from the actual world is a discussion for physics and counterfactualism.) [...] "The 43rd <b>President</b> of <b>the</b> United States of America" [...] is thus a non-rigid designator, picking out George W. Bush in some possible worlds, Al Gore in others, and yet other people in other worlds.|$|R
5000|$|John F. Kennedy, one of America's most {{influential}} <b>presidents</b> of <b>the</b> 20th century, commented in 1960: [...] "I believe in an America where {{the separation of}} church and state is absolute where no Catholic prelate would tell <b>the</b> <b>President</b> (should he be Catholic) how to act, and no Protestant minister would tell his parishioners for whom to vote where no church or church school is granted any public funds or political preference - and where no man is denied public office merely because his religion differs from <b>the</b> <b>President</b> who <b>might</b> appoint him or the people who might elect him.|$|R
5000|$|In a BBC Today interview, {{broadcast}} in December 2010, Hill recalled the assassination {{and his first}} visit to Dallas in 1990 since the events of 1963, during which he surveyed the scene of the shooting. Asked whether he thought that <b>the</b> <b>President's</b> life <b>might</b> have been saved if things had been done differently, Hill replied that [...] "He had all the advantages that day. We had none. And it was a very easy job to accomplish because of the way everything was laid out." ...|$|R

[...] They likened the situation to those behind the ruling of Doremus v. Board of Education, 342 U.S. 429 (1952) where standing was not granted as school teachers would receive the same salary whether they read from the Old Testament or did not. The government likened the use of funds to hold conferences for religious organizations seeking funding to the [...] "payment of government officials' salaries when they make speeches or attend meetings, even with religious content." [...] They held that if the Court allowed the Appeals court position to stand then taxpayers could sue over the use of taxes to fund the electricity to power the microphone and the lights during a speech where <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>might</b> express his own religious sentiments. They pointed out that [...] "from President Washington to President Lincoln to the present day, Presidents and other Executive Branch officials have made speeches invoking religion and have met with religious leaders without constitutional incident." ...|$|E
2500|$|Because of a {{paralysis}} {{that started}} in early 1961 and progressed quickly in 1966, on the 2nd February Cemal Gürsel was flown to the Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C. on the private airplane [...] "BlueBird" [...] sent by US President Lyndon B. Johnson. One week later, he fell into a coma there after suffering a series of new paralytic strokes. The government decided he return to Turkey on 24 March. President Johnson went by helicopter from the White House to Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland, near Washington, D.C., to pay his respects to President Cemal Gürsel on his departure to home, In addition to issuing the following statement 'Our distinguished friend, President Cemal Gursel of Turkey, came to the United States on 2 February for medical treatment. There was hope that new therapeutic procedures only recently developed in this country would be useful in treating his illness of several years. We were initially encouraged by his progress at Walter Reed Hospital, only to be shocked by the news on 8 February that his health had suffered a grave new blow. Our best talent, coupled with the skill of the eminent Turkish doctors who accompanied the President, was exerted to the utmost {{in the hope that}} <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>might</b> return to his home in fully restored health. We are saddened that this hope was not to be realized. We have been deeply honored to have President Gürsel come to our country to seek medical treatment. As he returns to his homeland, our prayers go with him'. With a report of a medical committee by Gülhane Military Hospital in Ankara, the parliament ruled on 28 March 1966 that his presidency be terminated due to ill health in accordance with the constitution. He died of apoplexy at 0645 hrs on 14 September 1966 in Ankara. He left behind no directives or last will. He was laid to rest at the [...] "Freedom Martyrs Memorial" [...] section in the yard of the mausoleum of Atatürk. His body was transferred on 27 August 1988 to a permanent burial place in the newly built Turkish State Cemetery.|$|E
60|$|I learned afterward, however, {{that among}} the rules {{governing}} the actions of this Council, was one that a President should be chosen each year, and that matters of moment were {{to be determined by}} vote of the Council, in which <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>might</b> cast two ballots.|$|E
60|$|Here the interview, {{so far as}} {{this subject}} is concerned, {{terminated}} by Mr. Crittenden's assuring <b>the</b> <b>President</b> that, whatever <b>might</b> be our final action, we all thought him solely moved by a high patriotism and sincere devotion to the happiness and glory of his country; and with that conviction we should consider respectfully the important suggestions he had made.|$|R

2500|$|He {{supported}} the isolationist Neutrality Acts of the 1930s but wanted and sponsored more severe bills designed to renounce all traditional neutral [...] "rights" [...] and restrict and prevent any action by <b>the</b> <b>President</b> that <b>might</b> cause <b>the</b> United States {{to be drawn}} into war. He {{was one of the most}} effective of the diehard isolationists in the Senate. Except for advocating aid to Finland after the Soviet invasion of that country and urging a quid pro quo in the Far East to prevent a war with Japan over the Manchuria-China question, his position was consistently isolationist.|$|R
60|$|Kit {{was silent}} for a few minutes. He had had a faint hope that <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>might</b> rally his {{supporters}} and begin the fight again, but the hope was gone. He knew all he wanted, and must leave the town as soon as he had had some food.|$|E
60|$|The Court of Commissioners of Alabama Claims has prosecuted its {{important}} duties very assiduously and very satisfactorily. It convened and was organized on the 22d day of July, 1874, {{and by the}} terms of the act under which it was created was to exist for one year from that date. The act provided, however, that should it be found impracticable to complete the work of the court before the expiration of the year <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>might</b> by proclamation extend the time of its duration to a period not more than six months beyond the expiration of the one year.|$|E
60|$|For a few moments, Kit thought hard. To begin with, he {{had been}} rash to pay half the porters' wages before they started. The money was a large sum for them and they had stolen away; perhaps because they were {{satisfied}} and afraid of meeting the president's soldiers, or perhaps to betray the party to the rebels for another reward. If the latter supposition were correct, Kit thought he ran some risk. Galdar's friends knew {{he could not be}} bribed and that Adam was ill, although it was hardly possible they knew he was dead. They would see that Kit had now control and since his help was valuable to <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>might</b> try to kill him. His best plan was to push on.|$|E

60|$|It {{would have}} been like him to have {{secretly}} hoped that <b>the</b> new <b>President</b> <b>might</b> keep him in London, but he never betrayed any ignoble disappointment, and he would not join in any blame of him. At our first meeting after he came home he spoke of the movement which had made Mr. Cleveland president, and said he supposed that if he had been here, he should have been in it. All his friends were, he added, a little helplessly; but he seemed not to dislike my saying I knew one of his friends who was not: in fact, as I have told, he never disliked a plump difference--unless he disliked the differer.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wish to make}} {{it clear}} to you, gentlemen, that what I said at Buffalo I meant. I want each of you to remain as a member of my Cabinet. I need your advice and counsel. I tender you the office in the same manner that I would tender it if I were {{entering}} upon the discharge of my duties as the result of an election by the people." [...] Having thus declared himself, the newly made President asked each member personally to stay with him. It was a sincere request, and the Cabinet members all agreed to remain by Mr. Roosevelt and aid him exactly as they had been aiding Mr. McKinley. Thus was it shown to the world at large, and especially to the anarchists, of which the assassin of McKinley had been one, that though <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>might</b> be slain, the government still lived.|$|E
60|$|The Prince and the Colonel, {{one after}} the other, were {{subjected}} to a long and particular interrogatory: the Prince alone; but Geraldine {{in the presence of}} the Prince, so that <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>might</b> observe the countenance of the one while the other was being warmly cross-examined. The result was satisfactory; and the President, after having booked a few details of each case, produced a form of oath to be accepted. Nothing could be conceived more passive than the obedience promised, or more stringent than the terms by which the juror bound himself. The man who forfeited a pledge so awful could scarcely have a rag of honour or any of the consolations of religion left to him. Florizel signed the document, but not without a shudder; the Colonel followed his example with an air of great depression. Then the President received the entry money; and without more ado, introduced the two friends into the smoking-room of the Suicide Club.|$|E

Heth's and Wilcox's divisions, such part of them as were not captured, were cut off from town, either designedly on their part or because they could not help it. Sheridan with the cavalry and 5th corps is above them. Miles's division, 2d corps, was sent from the White Oak Road to Sutherland Station on the South Side Railroad, where he met them, and at last accounts was engaged with them. Not knowing whether Sheridan would get up in time, General Humphreys was sent with another division from here. The whole captures since the army started out gunning will amount to not less than twelve thousand men, and probably fifty pieces of artillery. I do not know the number of men and guns accurately however. * * * I think <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>might</b> come out and pay us a visit tomorrow.|$|E
50|$|There is {{reportedly}} no real organized effort in Eritrea to combat corruption. The regime {{has been described}} as using a “so-called war on corruption” to crack down on political dissenters and opponents. In May 2015, <b>the</b> <b>president</b> urged a group of party and government officials to discuss American and European pressure on Eritrea to reform its government and release detainees, yet when some of those officials proposed that the government reform in certain areas to appease Western nations that send aid to Eritrea, <b>the</b> <b>president</b> underscored <b>the</b> need to stand up to pressure from the “hegemonic West.” Business leaders in Eritrea were reportedly “shivering with fear” over what <b>the</b> <b>president's</b> comments <b>might</b> signify; it was said to be unclear if the rumors signified a wave of jailing or not.|$|R
500|$|More recently, when David Souter was {{nominated}} to the Court, [...] "conservative groups expressed {{concern to the}} White House... that <b>the</b> <b>president's</b> bachelor nominee <b>might</b> conceivably be a homosexual".
