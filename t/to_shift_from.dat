5|$|In Hubbard's efforts <b>to</b> <b>shift</b> <b>from</b> a psychotherapeutic to {{a spiritual}} program, he {{introduced}} {{the concept of}} thetans: a set of godlike, non-corporeal entities capable of creating and shaping universes, later trapped in the MEST and confined, by reincarnation, to physical bodies. Hugh Urban of Ohio State University states that these teachings bear similarities to Gnosticism, although he doubts that Hubbard was well versed in Gnostic thought.|$|E

5|$|Because {{it is both}} one of {{the first}} dinosaurs {{described}} and one of the best-known dinosaurs, Iguanodon has been well-placed as a barometer of changing public and scientific perceptions on dinosaurs. Its reconstructions have gone through three stages: the elephantine quadrupedal horn-snouted reptile satisfied the Victorians, then a bipedal but still fundamentally reptilian animal using its tail to prop itself up dominated the early 20th century, but was slowly overturned during the 1960s by its current, more agile and dynamic representation, able <b>to</b> <b>shift</b> <b>from</b> two legs to all fours.|$|E
5|$|The {{conservative}} {{tradition of}} the mosque, with its {{lack of attention to}} science, was shaken by Napoleon's invasion. A seminal innovation occurred with the introduction of printing presses to Egypt, finally enabling the curriculum <b>to</b> <b>shift</b> <b>from</b> oral lectures and memorization to instruction by text, though the mosque itself only acquired its own printing press in 1930. Upon the withdrawal of the French, Muhammad Ali Pasha encouraged the establishment of secular learning, and history, math, and modern science were adopted into the curriculum. By 1872, under the direction of Jamāl al-Dīn al-Afghānī, European philosophy was also added to the study program.|$|E

5|$|An 1895 fire {{destroyed}} {{half the}} village, {{as it had}} no form of fire protection at that time. Throughout the 20thcentury, {{the decline of the}} natural cement industry caused Rosendale to suffer economically and lose population. The village was also battered by a series of severe floods, and the center of commerce began <b>to</b> <b>shift</b> <b>from</b> Main Street to Route32. By the 1970s the village was having severe problems with its utilities and tax code, and was no longer producing cement. The hippie movement brought many artists to the village during this time, which led to ideological clashes between the newcomers and the more conservative, established residents. In 1976, the village voted to dissolve itself to solve its municipal problems, and on January1, 1978, Rosendale became disincorporated. The village's mayor {{at the time of the}} vote viewed the dissolution as a work of conceptual art, and published a book on the matter.|$|E
5|$|Early Philippine {{sculpture}} {{is characterized}} by frontal nudity. One of the earliest forms are the bulols by the Ifugao people which serve as an assurance for bountiful harvests. The original function of these sculptures {{are related to the}} ceremonies and beliefs of the tribes who created them. Arab and Russian missionaries also brought beveled type of carvings in the form of Okkil. The beginnings of this sculpture type started with the Islamization of Sulu. The Spanish colonization of the country did not hinder Filipinos creating sculptures for objects of adoration. During this time, sculptures of deities and saints were used to teach Filipinos Christian doctrines. During the American colonialism, worshippers of faith were not discouraged to sculpt in order to adorn churches. Filipinos' first exposure to painting happened when Spain conquered the Philippines and these were used as religious propaganda often displayed in churches. However, as education progressed and wealth increased, more and more artists started <b>to</b> <b>shift</b> <b>from</b> the traditional religious motifs to a more secular pattern of imagery.|$|E
5|$|In most species, the nymphs are herbivores or detritivores, {{feeding on}} algae, diatoms or detritus, {{but in a}} few species, they are predators of chironomid and other small insect larvae and nymphs. Nymphs of Povilla burrow into {{submerged}} wood and {{can be a problem}} for boat owners in Asia. Some are able <b>to</b> <b>shift</b> <b>from</b> one feeding group to another as they grow, thus enabling them to utilise a variety of food resources. They process a great quantity of organic matter as nymphs and transfer a lot of phosphates and nitrates to terrestrial environments when they emerge from the water, thus helping to remove pollutants from aqueous systems. Along with caddisfly larvae and gastropod molluscs, the grazing of mayfly nymphs has {{a significant impact on the}} primary producers, the plants and algae, on the bed of streams and rivers.|$|E

5|$|In the 2000s, {{supporter}} {{culture in}} Sweden started <b>to</b> <b>shift</b> <b>from</b> being English-influenced to being more {{influenced by the}} Southern European countries and their football culture, making tifos and ultras a common sight in Swedish arenas. From acting as an almost uniform group of fans gathered under the same flag, (Änglarna), IFK fans created separate supporter factions, including Ultra Bulldogs, Young Lions and West Coast Angelz. IFK {{is the most popular}} football club in Sweden; a 2004 survey concluded that IFK Göteborg had support from 13% of Swedish football fans, and a 2017 survey again stated that IFK was the most popular club in Sweden, with a support of 10%. A majority, 55%, of football fans in Gothenburg support IFK, and the club is the fourth most popular in Stockholm (after AIK, Djurgårdens IF and Hammarby IF) and the second most popular in Malmö, after Malmö FF.|$|E
5|$|Wolfenstein 3D was {{the second}} major release by id Software, after the Commander Keen series of episodes. In mid-1991, {{programmer}} John Carmack experimented with making a fast 3D game engine by restricting the gameplay and viewpoint to a single plane, producing Hovertank 3D and Catacomb 3-D as prototypes. After a design session prompted the company <b>to</b> <b>shift</b> <b>from</b> the family-friendly Keen to a more violent theme, programmer John Romero suggested remaking the 1981 stealth shooter Castle Wolfenstein as a fast-paced action game. He and designer Tom Hall designed the game, built on Carmack's engine, to be fast and violent, unlike other computer games on the market at the time. Wolfenstein 3D features artwork by Adrian Carmack and sound effects and music by Bobby Prince. The game was released through Apogee in two sets of three episodes under the shareware model, in which the first episode is released for free to drive interest in paying for the rest. An additional episode, Spear of Destiny, was released as a stand-alone retail title through FormGen.|$|E
5|$|In early July 1941, {{shortly after}} the {{launching}} of Operation Barbarossa against the Soviet Union, armed resistance began against both the Germans and the Aćimović authorities. This {{was a response to}} appeals from both Joseph Stalin and the Communist International for communist organisations across occupied Europe to draw German troops away from the Eastern Front, and followed a meeting of the Central Committee of the Yugoslav Communist Party in Belgrade on 4 July. This meeting resolved <b>to</b> <b>shift</b> <b>from</b> sabotage operations to a general uprising, form Partisan detachments of fighters and commence armed resistance, and call for the populace to rise up against the occupiers throughout Yugoslavia. This also coincided with the departure of the last of the German invasion force that had remained to oversee the transition to occupation. From the appearance of posters and pamphlets urging the population to undertake sabotage, it rapidly turned to attempted and actual sabotage of German propaganda facilities and railway and telephone lines. The first fighting occurred at the village of Bela Crkva on 7 July, when gendarmes tried to disperse a public meeting, and two gendarmes were killed. At {{the end of the first}} week in July, List requested that the Luftwaffe transfer an aircraft training school to the territory, as operational units were not available. Soon after, gendarmerie stations and patrols were being attacked, and German vehicles were fired upon. Armed groups first appeared in the Aranđelovac district, northwest of Topola.|$|E
