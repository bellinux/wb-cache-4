5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Buzz</b> on Maggie is an American {{animated}} {{television series}} created by Dave Polsky for Disney Channel. The series centers on an ambitious and expressive tween fly named Maggie Pesky {{and her family}} and friends. The show is set in Stickyfeet, a city for insects located in a dump. While conceptualizing the series, Polsky wanted it to contain a playful aspect at adolescence and director Dave Wasson formed the overall look of the characters, being heavily influenced by early Walt Disney cartoon shorts. <b>The</b> <b>Buzz</b> on Maggie was Disney's first series to be fully animated in Adobe Flash, a process done by Bardel Entertainment and Future Thought Productions.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the time}} as he was collaborating with Stipe, and while still a member of Oh-OK, Sweet began writing songs for another project, <b>the</b> <b>Buzz</b> of Delight, which {{consisted}} of Sweet and former Oh-OK drummer David Pierce. In October 1983, they recorded a six-song EP, Soundcastles, released {{in the spring of}} 1984 on DB Records, and performed in New York, Florida and Georgia State to promote it. In the summer and November 1984, <b>the</b> <b>Buzz</b> of Delight recorded more songs, none of which were immediately released. (In 1990, one previously unreleased Buzz of Delight track appeared on the DB Records compilation Squares Blot out the Sun, and, in 2002, three others on To Understand.) Meanwhile, Stipe continued his work with R.E.M., who were getting acclaim and success with their album Murmur. In 1983, it was named album of the year by Rolling Stone and Trouser Press, and by the middle of 1984, it had sold 200,000 copies. In November 1983, R.E.M. began recording their follow-up, Reckoning.|$|E
5|$|BuzzSaw is themed {{around a}} series of unexplainable occurrences in the Town of Gold Rush which {{date back to the}} late 1800s. In 1876, the Town of Gold Rush was formed. It was a prosperous town during the great gold rush. Eleven years later, in 1887, the town's Gold supply was {{completely}} gone. The town then established a sawmill and turned their focus to timber. On a clear moon-lit night, a sawmill worker named Jack Darke was killed by <b>the</b> <b>buzz</b> saw after he had a scuffle with some other workers who were attempting to set the building on fire. The circumstances leading up to his death were covered up by the town with the legend stating that Jack tried to burn down the sawmill and slipped into the path of <b>the</b> <b>buzz</b> saw. The sawmill has remained closed since with many people claiming encounters with the ghost of Jack on nights similar to that of his death.|$|E

The school's staff include the sneaky Principal Peststrip (Jeff Bennett), pompous Mr. Bugspit (Curtis Armstrong) and gruff Mrs. Wingston (Candi Milo). <b>The</b> <b>Buzz</b> on Maggie uses a slapstick comedy style and relies {{slightly}} on gross-out humor. It also includes several insect aspects, such as flies' appetite for spoiled and rotten food.

5000|$|Frequently, distant {{conversations and}} other {{background}} noises {{have been heard}} behind the buzzer, suggesting that <b>the</b> <b>buzzing</b> tones are not generated internally, but are transmitted from a device placed behind a live and constantly open microphone.

The family resides in an old milk carton in a suburban fly metropolis called Stickyfeet, which {{is located in a}} dump. Maggie has an ambitious and adventurous personality and aspires to become a rock star. Her approach to life often suffers unexpected consequences that puts herself in jeopardy, as she often follows her own impulses although they go against the rules or her parents' wishes. However, she ultimately learns her lesson, {{which was one of the}} core themes for the show's conception.|$|E

Julie Ditty {{was traded to the}} Boston Lobsters. <b>The</b> <b>Buzz</b> selected 2005 WTT Rookie of the Year Rik de Voest {{in the first round of}} the roster draft and Ashley Fisher in the second round. In the third round, <b>the</b> <b>Buzz</b> traded down in exchange for cash consideration from the Newport Beach Breakers. The Breakers used the Buzz's number 2 pick to select Lauren Albanese while <b>the</b> <b>Buzz</b> used the Breakers' number 10 choice to take Gabriela Navrátilová. <b>The</b> <b>Buzz</b> drafted Gréta Arn in the fourth round. After four straight losing seasons, <b>the</b> <b>Buzz</b> finally turned its fortunes finishing with 8 wins and 6 losses tied for first place with the Philadelphia Freedoms in the highly competitive Eastern Conference.

50|$|On French-style instruments, the {{sensitivity}} of <b>the</b> <b>buzzing</b> bridge can be altered by turning a peg called a tirant in the tailpiece of the instrument that is connected by a wire or thread to the trompette.

25|$|As {{the number}} 2 overall {{seed in the}} WTT playoffs, <b>the</b> <b>Buzz</b> was matched against the number 3 seeded Sportimes.

Shvedova followed with a 5–2 women's singles win over Ashley Harkleroad. Healy took care of Jesse Witten, 5–2, in men's singles. Gabriela Navrátilová and Shvedova needed a tiebreaker to beat Harkleroad and Šromová, 5–4, and give <b>the</b> <b>Buzz</b> a 20–11 lead heading to the final set.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Buzz</b> {{selected}} {{former world}} number 1 Martina Hingis in the 2010 marquee player draft, and Hingis committed to playing full-time. Alex Domijan {{was the only}} player to return from the 2009 squad. Although he wasn't protected by <b>the</b> <b>Buzz,</b> the team chose him {{in the third round}} of the roster draft. In the first two rounds, <b>the</b> <b>Buzz</b> selected Scoville Jenkins and Sarah Borwell. With Hingis committed to playing full-time, <b>the</b> <b>Buzz</b> didn't need its fourth round choice in the roster draft and sold the pick to the Sacramento Capitals for cash consideration. Jay Udwadia, who coached <b>the</b> <b>Buzz</b> to its only WTT championship in 2008, returned as the team's coach after a one-year absence. While the team continued to call SEFCU Arena its home, the July 9 home match against the Washington Kastles was played at the larger Glens Falls Civic Center in Glens Falls, New York, since it was expected to feature Hingis against Serena Williams in the women's singles set. Williams, who had just won her fourth Wimbledon ladies' singles title a few days before, did not play in the match in Glens Falls. With <b>the</b> <b>Buzz</b> struggling with 2 wins and 9 losses, Yvette Hyndman started getting some playing time late in the season.
