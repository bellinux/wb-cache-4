5|$|On 7 October 2013, Miliband {{reshuffle}}d his Shadow Cabinet for {{the third}} time, saying <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the last reshuffle before the general election. In a move similar to his 2011 reshuffle, several MPs from the 2010 intake were promoted, while more long-serving MPs were moved. Tristram Hunt and Rachel Reeves received promotions, while Liam Byrne and Stephen Twigg were among those demoted.|$|E
5|$|The Best of Sanctus Real was {{released}} on October 9, 2015 via the Capitol Christian record label. It includes a selection of fourteen songs spanning the band's previous seven albums and one new song written specifically for the release. It was announced earlier in year <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the final project with the band for lead singer, Matt Hammitt.|$|E
5|$|Although an {{air-cooled}} {{design was}} chosen for the reactor at Oak Ridge to facilitate rapid construction, it was recognized <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> impractical for the much larger production reactors. Initial designs by the Metallurgical Laboratory and DuPont used helium for cooling, before they determined that a water-cooled reactor would be simpler, cheaper and quicker to build. The design did not become available until 4 October 1943; in the meantime, Matthias concentrated on improving the Hanford Site by erecting accommodations, improving the roads, building a railway switch line, and upgrading the electricity, water and telephone lines.|$|E

5|$|Announcing <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{his final}} season before retirement, Shearer's {{form in the}} 2004–05 season was patchy; {{alongside}} new signing Patrick Kluivert, he scored only sevengoals in his 28games as the club finished the season in 14th place. The club fared better in the cup competitions, however, eventually losing out to Sporting CP in the UEFA Cup quarter-finals and Manchester United in the FA Cup semi-finals. Shearer scored a hat-trick {{in the first round}} win against Hapoel Bnei Sakhnin, and ended the season with a haul of 11 European goals, in addition to his one goal in domestic cups.|$|E
5|$|Bennett {{pulled his}} first {{selection}} surprise of 2007, experimenting with Hunt at halfback {{for the opening}} game of the season. At the time Bennett maintained <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a long term switch, but due to the Broncos' poor form, Hunt returned to fullback for Round 3. Hunt was selected {{to play for the}} Australian national team at fullback in the 2007 ANZAC Test match against New Zealand, scoring a try in the Kangaroos' 30-6 victory.|$|E
5|$|By {{the fall}} of his junior season, the Illinois class of 2014 was being {{mentioned}} {{as one of the}} all-time great statewide classes of basketball players. Chicago Sun-Times writer Joe Henricksen noted that there was a high chance <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the fifth Illinois class and first since 2002 to include three McDonald's All-Americans. He also noted that the class has a chance to rival if not surpass the classes of 1998 and 2011 which each had nine top 100 players.|$|E

5|$|Chamberlin jealously guarded his position. In late 1943, Chamberlin {{differed}} {{with one}} of his planners, Brigadier General Bonner Fellers, over a proposed landing at Hansa Bay. Fellers thought that Hansa Bay could be bypassed, but Chamberlin felt <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> too risky. While Fellers was a newcomer to GHQ, he had known MacArthur for many years, and Fellers took his proposal directly to MacArthur, who approved it. A furious Chamberlin had Fellers fired from G-3. MacArthur made him his military secretary.|$|E
5|$|In June 1963, Kenyatta {{met with}} the Tanganyikan President Julius Nyerere and Ugandan President Milton Obote in Nairobi. The trio {{discussed}} the possibility of merging their three nations into a single East African Federation, agreeing <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> accomplished {{by the end of}} the year. Privately, Kenyatta was more reluctant regarding the arrangement and as 1964 came around the federation had not come to pass. In May 1964, Kenyatta rejected a back-benchers resolution calling for speedier federation. He publicly stated that talk of a federation had always been a ruse to hasten the pace of Kenyan independence from Britain, but Nyerere denied that this was true.|$|E
5|$|In March 2009, Wagner {{supposedly}} {{announced that}} Sarcófago would reunite, and their tour itinerary would include appearances at the Wacken Open Air and Hole in the Sky festivals, {{as well as}} dates in London, New York, Los Angeles and Tokyo. He stated {{it would be the}} original I.N.R.I. line-up, but <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the only tour they would be doing {{and there would be no}} new material. A couple of days later, Lamounier himself wrote to the music press exposing this news report as a hoax.|$|E

5|$|On 21 February 2016, a {{referendum}} {{was held on}} the question of whether Morales should be allowed to run for a fourth term when his third term would expire in 2020 which he narrowly lost. His approval rating had been damaged by the allegations concerning his relationship with Gabriela Zapata Montaño. In December 2016 the MAS nominated Morales as their candidate for the 2019 presidential election regardless, stating that they would seek various avenues to ensure <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> legal.|$|E
5|$|The British Government {{called on}} Keynes's {{expertise}} during the First World War. While {{he did not}} formally re-join the civil service in 1914, Keynes travelled to London at the government's request {{a few days before}} hostilities started. Bankers had been pushing for the suspension of specie payments – the convertibility of banknotes into gold – but with Keynes's help the Chancellor of the Exchequer (then Lloyd George) was persuaded <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a bad idea, as it would hurt the future reputation of the city if payments were suspended before it was absolutely necessary.|$|E
5|$|According to Louis Philippe, the game's audio director, {{the team}} {{originally}} used intense music and sounds to create tension. However, the team decided to scrap this idea, {{realizing that the}} best way to create a tense atmosphere is to create the sounds of other players, which are often unexpected. The team created Navigation Sounds, in which the sound a player made is determined by their operators' weight, armor, and speed. Gadget deployment such as fortifying and breach-charging create louder sounds that may reveal the player's presence. The team thought <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> enjoyable for players and influence their gameplay experience. The game's music was composed by Paul Haslinger, who had worked on the score of the previous Rainbow Six games and the Far Cry series. His co-composer was Ben Frost, who debuted his first video game soundtrack with Siege. Leon Purviance assisted Frost and Haslinger in composing the music.|$|E

5|$|After an {{exhibition}} rout of US Armed Forces, the Lady Vols {{opened up the}} season unusually, with a conference game against Mississippi. Semeka Randall did not start the game. However, four minutes into the game, the Lady Vols were only up 4–2. At this point, Randall was put into the game, and Tennessee scored fifteen straight, on a run fueled by her. Randall scored 24, and star Chamique Holdsclaw added 23. This season opener has {{caused a lot of}} anticipation, as it was expected <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the game where all four of Tennessee's freshman played together. However, during a November practice, Clement had injured her foot, resulting in a stress fracture. After a discussion with the team doctor, Clement agreed to sit out the Mississippi game {{in order to be able}} to play the next game, against Louisiana Tech.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1420, vessels from Bristol were {{regularly}} travelling to Iceland {{and it is}} speculated that sailors from Bristol had made landfall in the Americas before Christopher Columbus or John Cabot. After Cabot arrived in Bristol, he proposed a scheme to the king, Henry VII, in which he proposed to reach Asia by sailing west across the north Atlantic. He estimated <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> shorter and quicker than Columbus' southerly route. The merchants of Bristol, operating {{under the name of}} the Society of Merchant Venturers, agreed to support his scheme. They had sponsored probes into the north Atlantic from the early 1480s, looking for possible trading opportunities. In 1552 Edward VI granted a Royal Charter to the Merchant Venturers to manage the port.|$|E
5|$|As {{the great}} numbers of troops from both armies gathered, {{it was widely}} assumed in the North <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the battle to end the war. Grant, {{reinstated}} by Halleck at Lincoln's and Stanton's urging, left Fort Henry and traveled by boat up the Tennessee River to rejoin his army with orders to advance with the Army of the Tennessee into Tennessee. Grant's main Union army was located at Pittsburg Landing, while 40,000 Confederate troops converged at Corinth. Brigadier General William Tecumseh Sherman assured Grant that his green troops were ready for an attack. Grant agreed and wired Halleck with their assessment. Grant, whose forces numbered 45,000, wanted to attack the Confederates at Corinth, but Halleck ordered him not to attack until Major General Don Carlos Buell arrived with his division of 25,000. Meanwhile, Grant prepared for {{an attack on the}} Confederate army of roughly equal strength. Instead of preparing defensive fortifications between the Tennessee River and Owl Creek, and clearing fields of fire, they spent most of their time drilling the largely inexperienced troops while Sherman dismissed reports of nearby Confederates.|$|E

5|$|Barcelona were {{expected}} to line up in a 4–2–3–1 formation, with Ronaldinho, Ludovic Giuly and Deco supporting Samuel Eto'o who would be deployed as the lone striker. They had doubts about the fitness of Lionel Messi going into the final. He had pulled a thigh muscle during the second leg of their match with Chelsea, and had not played since, though he {{was included in the}} 22 man squad for the final. Barcelona coach Frank Rijkaard stated he would leave it late before deciding whether to select him. Despite being included in the squad Messi did not feature in the final. Arsenal {{were expected}} to line up in a 4–5–1 formation, with Thierry Henry as the sole striker. There was much discussion about whether José Antonio Reyes would take the place of Robert Pirès on the left of midfield. It had been announced before the match <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> Pirès' last match as he had agreed to join Villarreal next season.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, a {{few months}} after the {{publication}} of Tintin and the Picaros, Hergé told the journalist Numa Sadoul that he was contemplating the next adventure of Tintin—setting an entire story in an airport lounge. This idea was dropped, and in 1978, he decided to set the story in the world of modern art. During his later years Hergé had grown increasingly interested in this subject, and decided to incorporate his love of avant-garde artwork into the new story. Being a regular at Brussels' art galleries and exhibitions, he was able to draw directly upon his experiences in the art scene when producing the story. Given his age, and the length of time that it was taking him to produce each Adventure, British literary critic Michael Farr suggested that Hergé likely knew <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> his final installment in the series.|$|E
5|$|Monmouth again {{denounced the}} king in Chard {{and was the}} subject of a {{coronation}} in Taunton on 20 June 1685, against the wishes of some of his republican supporters such as Wade. The Taunton Corporation was forced to witness the event at sword point outside the White Hart Inn, to encourage the support of the country gentry. In Taunton, Monmouth was joined by many new supporters and formed a new regiment of 800 men. The king's force of Dragoons under Churchill continued to close on Monmouth, arriving in Chard on 19 June. With the assistance of the local militias they attempted to stop new recruits arriving in Taunton to join Monmouth. Feversham meanwhile moved with his forces into Bristol, on the assumption <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> Monmouth's next target, and took overall charge of the campaign.|$|E
