The addition of water coolant and extension of the target into slices may introduce the effects of: yield degredation from pion reabsorption, additional heat load on the target, and increased scatter in arrival times. These three effects are quantified and used as figures of merit in a comparison of different <b>target</b> <b>lengths</b> and diameters, evaluated {{in the context of}} the neutrino factory front end requirements. Energy deposition is also broken down per component to quantify potential heat sources in the system...|$|R
50|$|One {{theory of}} {{learning}} {{relies on the}} use of strategies or rules of action that relate to a particular task. These rules specify the conditions under which a certain rule or strategy will apply. These rules are of the form if you recognize situation S, then carry out action/strategy A. For example, Anzai implemented a set of production rules or strategies which performed the DDM task of steering a ship through a certain set of gates. The Anzai strategies did reasonably well to mimic the performance on the task by human participants. Similarly, Lovett and Anderson have shown how people use production rules or strategies of the if - then type in the building-sticks task which is an isomorph of Lurchins' waterjug problem. The goal in the building-sticks task is to construct a stick of a particular desired length given three stick lengths from which to build (there is an unlimited supply of sticks of each length). There are basically two strategies to use in trying to solve this problem. The undershoot strategy is to take smaller sticks and build up to the target stick. The overshoot strategy is to take the stick longer than the goal and cut off pieces equal in length to the smaller stick until one reaches the <b>target</b> <b>length.</b> Lovett and Anderson arranged it so that only one strategy would work for a particular problem and gave subjects problems where one of the two strategies worked on a majority of the problems (and she counterbalanced over subjects which was the more successful strategy).|$|E

"Weight-for-length", another widely used growth chart, presents a problem from a methodological point of view. <b>Target</b> <b>length</b> values (53 - 77 cm) are not observed in all infants, leading to truncated age distributions at most target lengths. It was {{demonstrated that the}} age at which the <b>target</b> <b>length</b> was reached (Fig. 8) had a significant influence on weight especially at a smaller length. This implies that the weight-for-length charts are biased. This phenomenon is due to the longitudinal measurement schedule at prechosen ages and not at prechosen lengths, which is impossible. To obtain the desired length-corrected weight standards, it is advocated to construct age-related body mass indices...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: DNA microarrays {{are widely}} used as end point {{detectors}} for gene expression analysis. Several methods {{have been developed for}} target labelling to enable quantification but without taking <b>target</b> <b>length</b> into consideration. Here we highlight the importance of choosing the optimum <b>target</b> <b>length</b> that would ensure specificity without compromising sensi-tivity of the assay. For this, eight plasmids that are identical to each other except for a closely related 23 bp unique re-porter (UR) sequence were used to examine the hybridization efficiency for these URs. Targets of various lengths were generated and labelled as follows: full length and 330 bases transcripts using a dendrimer labelling method, 120 bp ampli-cons by the modified PCR end labelling method and synthetic labelled targets of 33 bases. This report also shows the ad-vantages of using the modified PCR method over other labelling methods in generating labelled amplicons of the desired lengths to maximize hybridization efficiency...|$|E

40|$|A new paint {{infiltration}} coating {{method has}} been developed for fabricating ISOL targets for radioactive ion beam applications. The technique {{has been shown to}} be inexpensive, fast, and almost universal for the uniform deposition of many refractory target materials onto the interior surfaces of complex geometry matrices, such as reticulated-vitreous-carbon-foam (RVCF). The process yields robust, highly permeable targets with fast diffusion and release properties. The use of compressed RVCF, coated with an optimum thickness of target material, reduces <b>target</b> <b>lengths</b> to practical values, while preserving high permeability. We have demonstrated the viability of the technique for coating RVCF compressed by factors of 6 and 10 with WSi 2, to form targets for use at facilities such as the Rare Isotope Accelerator (RIA) ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{scientific}} question {{addressed in}} this work is: what hides beneath first order kinetic constant k (s(- 1)) measured for hybridization of a DNA target on a biosensor surface.
