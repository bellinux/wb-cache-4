40|$|Objectives: Commercial <b>timing</b> <b>light</b> systems (CTLS) provide precise {{measurement}} of athletes running velocity, however {{they are often}} expensive and difficult to transport. In this study an inexpensive, wireless and portable <b>timing</b> <b>light</b> system was created using the infrared camera in Nintendo Wii hand controllers (NWHC). Design: System creation with gold-standard validation. Method: A Windows-based software program using NWHC to replicate a dual-beam timing gate was created. Firstly, data collected during 2. m walking and running trials were validated against a 3 D kinematic system. Secondly, data recorded during 5. m running trials at various intensities from standing or flying starts were compared to a single beam CTLS and the independent and average scores of three handheld stopwatch (HS) operators. Intraclass correlation coefficient and Bland-Altman plots {{were used to assess}} validity. Absolute error quartiles and percentage of trials in absolute error threshold ranges were used to determine accuracy. Results: The NWHC system was valid when compared against the 3 D kinematic system (ICC. = 0. 99, median absolute error (MAR). = 2. 95 %). For the flying 5. m trials the NWHC system possessed excellent validity and precision (ICC. = 0. 97, MAR 8 %). Conclusions: A NWHC <b>timing</b> <b>light</b> system is inexpensive, portable and valid for assessing running velocity. Errors in the 5. m standing start trials may have been due to erroneous event detection by either the commercial or NWHC-based <b>timing</b> <b>light</b> systems. © 2010 Sports Medicine Australia...|$|R

Green also removed some of the sheet metal around the engine intake, later realizing that in the process he had destroyed the Goodyear logo. But the Wingfoot Express now easily hit 299 miles per hour (481 km/h) with no afterburner.

This method involves wearing a weighted vest at all times during the day {{for an extended period of}} time. There are no studies that have examined the effect of hypergravity on speed or the benefit for rugby players. An experimental group (n = 8) and a control group (n = 7) of national team rugby players took part in the study, which consisted of rugby, conditioning, speed, and strength sessions. The experimental group wore a weighted vest equating to 12 % of their body mass for 8 days. All players were tested for speed and lower-body power before, 2 days after, and 9 days after the intervention. Speed testing involved the athletes completing 40 -m sprints with <b>timing</b> <b>lights</b> and high-speed video cameras assessing acceleration and maximal velocity sprinting kinematics. Lower-body power was assessed using weighted countermovement jumps (CMJs). No group differences were found for sprinting speed at any point.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of preventative ankle taping on planned change-of-direction and reactive agility performance and peak ankle muscle activity in basketballers. Twenty male basketballers (age = 22. 30 ± 3. 97 years; height = 1. 84 ± 0. 09 meters; body mass = 85. 96 ± 11. 88 kilograms) with no ankle pathologies attended two testing sessions. Within each session, subjects completed six planned and six reactive randomized trials (three {{to the left and}} three to the right for each condition) of the Y-shaped agility test, which was recorded by <b>timing</b> <b>lights.</b> In one session, subjects had both ankles un-taped. In the other, both ankles were taped using a modified subtalar sling. Peak tibialis anterior, peroneus longus (PL), peroneus brevis (PB), and soleus muscle activity was recorded for both the inside and outside legs across stance phase during the directional change, which was normalized against 10 -meter sprint muscle activity (nEMG). Both the inside and outside cut legs during the change-of-direction step were investigated. Repeated measures ANOVA determined performance time and nEMG differences between un-taped and taped conditions. There were no differences in planned change-of-direction or reactive agility times between the conditions. Inside cut leg PL nEMG decreased when taped for the planned left, reactive left, and reactive right cuts (p = 0. 01). Outside leg PB and soleus nEMG increased during the taped planned left cut (p = 0. 02). There were no other nEMG changes during the cuts with taping. Taping did not affect change-of-direction or agility performance. Inside leg PL activity was decreased, possibly due to the tape following the line of muscle action. This may reduce the kinetic demand for the PL during cuts. In conclusion, ankle taping did not significantly affect planned change-of-direction or reactive agility performance, and did not demonstrate large changes in activity of the muscle complex in healthy basketballers...|$|E

J Strength Cond Res 22 (5) : 1589 - 1596, 2008 -The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate the relationship between the kinematics and kinetics of a single-leg horizontal drop jump (SLDJ) to sprint performance. Twenty regional-level male team-sport athletes gave informed consent to participate in this study. All subjects performed a series of 25 -m sprints (measured by dual-beam infrared <b>timing</b> <b>lights)</b> and SLDJ (with both legs) in randomized block order during the same testing session. The SLDJ required the subjects to step downwards off a 20 -cm box, land on the force plate (operating at 500 Hz) with the specified foot, and jump for maximal horizontal distance while minimizing ground-contact time. Jump distance, particularly when normalized to a subject 2 ̆ 7 s height, was the strongest correlate to sprinting time for all three (5, 10, and 25 m) distances (- 0. 44 3 ̆c r 3 ̆c - 0. 65). Multiple linear regression analyses indicated that the SLDJ could account for a high level of variance in sprint time (0. 49 3 ̆c r 2 3 ̆c 0. 68) and that these predictions had a relatively low standard error of estimate (0. 02 - 0. 10 seconds). These results further support the contention that jump (particularly horizontal) and sprint ability for short distances are highly related. Whereas practitioners should consider using more horizontal than vertical jumps in the training and testing of most team-sport athletes, additional research into the kinetic determinants of jumping and sprinting may allow a more specific and individualized exercise prescription for improving certain aspects of sprinting such as step length or step rate or the vertical vs. horizontal contributions to propulsion...|$|E

Much of the evidence for their use has been anecdotal and measurement of kinematic or kinetic effects has been inconclusive. A single subject was selected for this case study to test the effect of orthoses on ground reaction forces during running. The subject was a competitive multi-sports athlete, and a heel strike runner (characterized as a runner who's heel is {{the first part of the}} foot to contact the ground). The experiment was conducted in a hall on a 40 m curved running track with a force plate on one side. <b>Timing</b> <b>lights</b> were placed 5 m from each end of the plate to measure speed and a video camera recorded the foot strike on the plate. The subject was asked to run at constant speed while wearing shoes and shoes with foot orthoses, at two self-selected speeds. Data from left and right foot was combined for analysis. The results showed a significant decrease in the magnitude of the vertical impact peak and the maximum vertical peak while the time to vertical impact peak was increased when wearing foot orthoses. Significant reductions were also seen in the peak posterior shear with both the time to peak and magnitude of the peak being changed by wearing foot orthoses. The mediolateral force was characterized by a medial impact followed by larger lateral impulse. It is the lateral force in the absorption phase of stance that is responsible for pronation, however no changes were seen in the mediolateral ground reaction force with the use of foot orthoses. This indicates that there is no acute effect in the shear forces, that act at approximately right angles to the subtalar joint axis. If orthoses have an acute effect on the lower limb it is likely to be complex and highly patient specific...|$|E

There has been no analysis of acceleration specific to cricketers, or for players who field primarily in the infield (closer to the pitch) or outfield (closer to the boundary).

Eighteen males (age = 24. 06 ± 4. 87 years; height = 1. 81 ± 0. 06 m; mass = 79. 67 ± 10. 37 kg) were defined as primarily infielders (n = 10) or outfielders (n = 8). <b>Timing</b> <b>lights</b> recorded 0 - 5 and 0 - 10 m time. Motion capture measured first and second step kinematics, including: step length; step frequency; contact time; shoulder motion; lead and rear arm elbow angle; drive leg hip and knee extension, and ankle plantar flexion; swing leg hip and knee flexion, and ankle dorsi flexion. A {{one-way analysis of variance}} (p < 0. 05) determined between-group differences. Data was pooled for a Pearson’s correlation analysis (p < 0. 05) to analyze kinematic relationships. There were no differences in sprint times, and few variables differentiated infielders and outfielders. Left shoulder range of motion related to second step length (r = 0. 471). First step hip flexion correlated with both step lengths (r = 0. 570 - 0. 598), and frequencies (r = - 0. 504 [...] 0. 606). First step knee flexion related to both step lengths (r = 0. 528 - 0. 682), and first step frequency (r = - 0. 669). First step ankle plantar flexion correlated with second step length (r = - 0. 692) and frequency (r = 0. 726). Greater joint motion ranges related to longer steps. Cricketers display similar sprint kinematics regardless of fielding position, likely because players may field in the infield or outfield depending on match situation. Due to relationships with shoulder and leg motion, and the importance and trainability of step length, cricketers should target this variable to enhance acceleration...|$|E
