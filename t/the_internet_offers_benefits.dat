40|$|Firms {{have only}} just begun to use the Internet to obtain {{customer}} information in their database marketing processes to enhance customer relationship management. This research uses an action research approach {{to develop a new}} framework about how they can do this. The action research project was carried out in a large Australian database company because no other sources of empirical information about the topic were available and it could provide rich findings about an under-researched, practical area. Results showed that integration of the Internet and database marketing enhances the effectiveness of customer relationship management practices. For example, <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> <b>offers</b> <b>benefits</b> such as increased consumer data collection accuracy and speed, cost savings, greater interaction and better relationships with customers. This research also identifies that organizational culture, top management support and collaboration between marketing and IT teams need to be in place to provide a supportive environment that is critical for the success of the integration.

40|$|Abstract ii Since {{a decade}} of years there is an {{extensive}} evolution noticeable, because new technologies in <b>the</b> <b>internet</b> <b>offer</b> many <b>benefits</b> to new organizational structures. These structures are changing to a much more modern flat hierarchy that don’t need much authorities and encourage more individuality and creativity. So the introduction will provide a short presentation of the evolution from older virtual collaboration techniques to the trend called enterprise 2. 0 {{that is based on}} the actual key word web 2. 0. To provide an overview of the different possibilities for enterprises to offer a virtual collaboration, there will be a determination that includes on the one hand online social network services like Facebook, Twitter, Wikia or Blogger {{and on the other hand}} commercial (enterprise) social software like IBM Connections, Microsoft SharePoint or Jive. The next step will be an identification of these tools so it will offer a brief overview of the most important tools that are necessary to collaborate. The aim of this work is a discussion of the impacts of the both types of social media in th...|$|R
40|$|Structured {{peer-to-peer}} (P 2 P) lookup services organize {{peers into}} a flat overlay network and offer distributed hash table (DHT) functionality. Chord, CAN, Pastry and Tapestry are all flat DHT designs. Each peer is indistinguishable from {{another in the}} sense that all peers use the same rules for determining the routes for lookup messages. This approach is strikingly different from routing in <b>the</b> <b>Internet,</b> which uses hierarchical routing. Hierarchical routing in <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> <b>offers</b> several <b>benefits</b> over non-hierarchical routing, including scalability and administrative autonomy. Inspired by hierarchical routing in <b>the</b> <b>Internet,</b> we propose hierarchical DHTs where peers are organized in disjoint groups [1]. Each group maintains its own overlay network and intra-group lookup service. A top-level overlay is defined among the groups. Within each group, a subset of peers are labeled as “superpeers”. Superpeers, which are analogous to gateway routers in hierarchical IP networks, are used by the top-level overlay to route messages among groups. We consider designs for which peers in the same group are locally close. There are various issues related to Hierarchical DHTs that need to be investigated such as deployment and maintenance in face of peers joining and leaving the system...|$|R

This paper presents the Government 2 ̆ 7 s response to the potential safety and security issues raised by this development. This the Australian Government 2 ̆ 7 s official response to {{the report of the}} House of Representatives Standing Committee on Communications, Hackers, Fraudsters and Botnets: Tackling the Problem of Cyber Crime.

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>Internet</b> <b>offers</b> {{numerous}} <b>benefits</b> {{for individuals}} and organizations in communication, trading and information searching. Before any of these benefits can be achieved, service providers/practitioners must first understand {{the factors that influence}} the acceptance and adoption of Internet system. If users are not willing to accept the system, it will not bring full benefits. The objective {{of this paper is to}} study the determinants that influence <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> usage behaviour among students in Higher Education. This study is based on the basic concept underlying the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) proposed by Davis (1989). It is a preferred choice of model in this study due to (1) the TAM has emerged as a powerful model among the models investigating the acceptance and use of information technology (IT), and (2) the TAM has been widely use in measuring the usage behaviour (actual use) and behavioural intention (intention to use) of technologies. There are some modifications to the original TAM as to suit this study. First, the behavioural intention variable is excluded since the actual use is predicted by the intention. Second, two latent variables (website characteristics and system characteristics) are included as external variables in this study. Limited research has included collectively technical features or technology attributes in a single TAM-based model. These variables are adopted from previous studies which have been tested and validated. Such external variables may improve the viability of TAM. Third, user characteristics are included as moderating variable where it has been found to impact individual’s attitude toward the technology. It is expected that this conceptual model based on TAM concept after some modifications, could have power in explaining the students’ behaviour to use <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> in <b>the</b> context of Malaysia. This outcome will provide a big picture and wider understanding relevant to <b>Internet</b> technology in <b>the</b> context of Malaysia Higher Education. Service providers/ practitioners could formulate appropriate strategies to promote Internet usage as to support National Policies especially the policy to increase ICT usage at all level of education...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} effectiveness of online graduate recruitment. <b>The</b> <b>Internet</b> <b>offers</b> tremendous potential <b>benefits</b> to companies and job-seekers, in particular great time and costs savings. The speed, ease of use and widespread availability of <b>the</b> <b>Internet,</b> make this medium particularly popular with graduates, who view <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> as {{a major source of}} job opportunities. However, evidence suggests that many companies face difficulty in using <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> effectively, in particular when they are recruiting large volumes of job applicants such as graduates, as they are struggling to cope with the high amount of unsuitable applications. As the existing literature on online graduate recruitment is fairly limited, this study explores the experiences and opinions of graduates with regards to online graduate recruitment and provides an in-depth understanding of the issues that graduates identified as useful or problematic when using <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> as a means of looking and applying for jobs. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a sample of eight international Master students of the Nottingham University Business School (NUBS). The results of these interviews indicate that the graduates perceive <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> as a fast and efficient job search tool that provides immediate access to a lot of up-to-date information. However, the interview data also suggest that the graduates experience major difficulties as they look and apply for a job on <b>the</b> <b>Internet.</b> <b>The</b> factors that hinder the effective use of <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> are <b>the</b> lack of relevant and specific information about the job and the company on a company's Web site, extremely long and time-consuming application forms, as well as poor Web site layouts and user-unfriendly Web site navigation. Other factors that the graduates identified as problematic are insufficient and slow feedback as well as low degree of personal contact. This research project provides a discussion of these issues, in which it is argued that online graduate recruitment is to a large extent ineffective. Furthermore, this study considers the implications of these results for management practice and concludes with recommendations for improving {{the effectiveness of}} online graduate recruitment...|$|R
