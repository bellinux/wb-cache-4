40|$|When {{patients}} are {{transferred from the}} hospital to other health care settings, responsibility for the patient is transferred from the treating physician, nurse, paramedic or pharmacist at the hospital to the next health care provider. Good patient handovers from hospital to other healthcare settings are essential to ensure continuity of care. However, handovers are often delayed or incomplete and the patient is barely involved in her or his own transfer. Risks related to an incomplete handover may be considerable. More {{than half of the}} preventable adverse events that occur after discharge are attributable to ineffective communication between hospital and other healthcare providers. Through the implementation of some adjustments, the discharge process can become a point of focus during a patient's hospital stay. Examples to improve patient handovers are standardizing the discharge process and the content of patient handovers, planning a <b>target</b> discharge <b>date,</b> <b>starting</b> the collection of transfer data on time and involving the patient in her or his transfe...|$|R

40|$|The <b>starting</b> <b>dates</b> of the pre-summer {{rainy season}} during {{historical}} times (1736 - 1911) in Fuzhou and Guangzhou of South China, were determined and reconstructed {{on the basis}} of historical documents in the Yu-Xue-Fen-Cun archive, together with observed features of precipitation during the pre-summer rainy season. In addition; <b>starting</b> <b>dates</b> of the pre-summer rainy season from 1953 in Fuzhou and from 1952 in Guangzhou were reconstructed for the instrumental period. These data allowed for analyses of inter-annual and inter-decadal changes in the <b>starting</b> <b>dates</b> of the pre-summer rainy season in South China over the past 300 years. Results show that the mean <b>starting</b> <b>date</b> of the pre-summer rainy season in South China was the first pentad of May; in addition, periodicities in the <b>starting</b> <b>dates</b> of 2 - 3 years, 10 years, and 40 years were detected during the period 1736 - 1911, and of 2 - 3 years, 10 years, and 22 years during the instrumental period. From 1736 to 1911, the earliest <b>starting</b> <b>dates</b> at Fuzhou and Guangzhou both occurred at the fourth pentad of April, while the latest <b>starting</b> <b>dates</b> were at the sixth pentad of May in Fuzhou and the first pentad of June in Guangzhou.
