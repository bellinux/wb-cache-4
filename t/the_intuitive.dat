5|$|Since {{forces are}} {{perceived}} as pushes or pulls, this can provide an intuitive understanding for describing forces. As with other physical concepts (e.g. temperature), <b>the</b> <b>intuitive</b> understanding of forces is quantified using precise operational definitions {{that are consistent with}} direct observations and compared to a standard measurement scale. Through experimentation, it is determined that laboratory measurements of forces are fully consistent with the conceptual definition of force offered by Newtonian mechanics.|$|E

5|$|When {{speaking}} about why an online game {{was chosen as}} {{the next step in the}} series, Fujisawa cited <b>the</b> <b>intuitive</b> character AI in Dragon Quest IV and party member communication in Dragon Quest VII. Solid ideas for an online game set within the Dragon Quest series were first suggested in 2005, when development was wrapping up on Dragon Quest VIII. It was initially worked on by a very small team, who worked together on the groundwork for some time. A core part of the initial plan was that the game would have a pre-planned ten-year lifespan with continual content updates. Once work had finished on Dragon Quest IX, Dragon Quest X took full priority. During these earlier phases, it was still undecided whether to make the game a mainline title, and there was even doubt as to whether it could be an MMORPG rather than just an online multiplayer game. These doubts, held by Saito, were assuaged by Fujisawa's confidence in the project. Despite this, Fujisawa was a novice at both developing and playing MMORPGs, putting him in stark contrast with other staff members such as Saito, Yoshida and second chief planner Takashi Anzai.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{cancellation}} of Sonic X-treme, the Saturn lacks an exclusive Sonic the Hedgehog platformer, containing only a graphically enhanced port of the Genesis title Sonic 3D Blast, the compilation Sonic Jam, and a racing game called Sonic R. The platformer Bug! received attention for its eponymous main character being a potential mascot for the Saturn, but it failed to catch on as the Sonic series had. Considered {{one of the most}} important Saturn releases, Sonic Team developed Nights into Dreams, a score attack game that attempted to simulate both the joy of flying and the fleeting sensation of dreams. The gameplay of Nights involves steering the imp-like androgynous protagonist, Nights, as it flies on a mostly 2D plane across surreal stages broken into four segments each. The levels repeat for as long as an in-game time limit allows, while flying over or looping around various objects in rapid succession earns additional points. Although it lacked the fully 3D environments of Nintendo's Super Mario 64, Nights emphasis on unfettered movement and graceful acrobatic techniques showcased <b>the</b> <b>intuitive</b> potential of analog control. Sonic Team's Burning Rangers, a fully 3D action-adventure game involving a team of outer-space firefighters, garnered praise for its transparency effects and distinctive art direction, but was released in limited quantities late in the Saturn's lifespan and criticized for its short length.|$|E

These arguments, if accepted, prevent Searle from claiming that his conclusion is obvious by undermining the intuitions that his certainty requires.|$|E

25|$|Elementary {{set theory}} {{can be studied}} informally and intuitively, and so can be taught in primary schools using Venn diagrams. <b>The</b> <b>intuitive</b> {{approach}} tacitly assumes that a set may be formed from the class of all objects satisfying any particular defining condition. This assumption gives rise to paradoxes, the simplest and best known of which are Russell's paradox and the Burali-Forti paradox. Axiomatic set theory was originally devised to rid set theory of such paradoxes.|$|E
25|$|It is {{difficult}} to reconcile <b>the</b> <b>intuitive</b> evidence that conscious decisions are causally effective with {{the view that the}} physical world can be explained to operate perfectly by physical law. The conflict between intuitively felt freedom and natural law arises when either causal closure or physical determinism (nomological determinism) is asserted. With causal closure, no physical event has a cause outside the physical domain, and with physical determinism, the future is determined entirely by preceding events (cause and effect).|$|E
