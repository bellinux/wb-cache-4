5|$|In March 1941, the 2nd New Zealand Division was one {{of several}} Allied units {{deployed}} to Greece to help prepare for an expected invasion by Italian and German troops. When the invasion began on 6 April 1941, the 20th Battalion briefly saw action at Thermopylae before being withdrawn, but Hinton missed this fighting as he was with the division's reinforcement battalion, which was initially based in Athens before it moved to the port of Kalamata. It had been decided that the Allied forces would abandon Greece; at Kalamata, the reinforcement battalion, along with several <b>thousand</b> <b>other,</b> mainly Australian, troops, was awaiting evacuation. On 28 April, the New Zealanders were waiting for transport when advance units of the German 5th Panzer Division began to attack the town with machine-gun fire and self-propelled 6-inch guns.|$|E

This fleet and the RAF sailors that crewed it would contract as Britain entered peacetime, however it continued be found everywhere that the RAF flew over water. On 11 December 1947 the MCS was granted full branch status and on 25 June 1948 the largest of its vessels, of 68 feet or more were, granted the ship prefix His Majesty's Air Force Vessel (HMAFV).|$|E
500|$|The {{brain is}} an organ {{that serves as}} the center of the nervous system in all {{vertebrate}} and most invertebrate animals. The brain is located in the head, usually close to the sensory organs for senses such [...] as vision. The brain is the most complex organ in a vertebrate's body. In a human, the cerebral cortex contains approximately 15–33 billion neurons, each connected by synapses to several <b>thousand</b> <b>other</b> neurons. These neurons communicate with one another by means of long protoplasmic fibers called axons, which carry trains of signal pulses called action potentials to distant parts of the brain or body targeting specific recipient cells.|$|E

Ebner stated that [...] "Hacking their site is not really the best way to go about taking them (the Church of Scientology) down. Most critics you talk to want the Scientology site to be up there so that people who are interested can see the stupidity they have on the web and at the same time they can go - they are a few keystrokes from getting a <b>thousand</b> <b>other</b> opinions." [...] Nick Douglas explained that the group decided to shift their strategy away from the attacks to Scientology websites: [...] "Anonymous even decided that they were going to stop that attack, that it was a bad idea. It's the usual thing they used to do when they really hadn't had a thought out plan, and here they're realizing they actually have to figure out some real plan against a real enemy." ...|$|E
500|$|Caribbean Sound Basin housed three {{separate}} studios and several amenities, including a swimming pool, gym, sauna, photographic studio, and bedroom suites. In contrast to most recording studios, its interior was spacious and exposed to natural light. At the studio complex, Raphael, D'wayne, and Riley recorded extensively {{into the night}} {{and went out to}} enjoy the nightlife, before returning to the studio. They often dimmed the lights, burned incense, and drank wine to set the mood when recording, which D'wayne explained in Musician, [...] "We try to make it real calm and mellow. 'Cause {{you want to be able}} to get into what you're singing." [...] They also immersed themselves in the local dancehall scene and attended late-night block parties that lasted until dawn. D'wayne later recalled his nightlife experiences with the group in Maravel: [...] "We'd heard dancehall, but we didn't really know anything about it before going there. We would go to these block parties and you could hear them from almost a mile away. You'd just park on the street and walk to the party along with four or five <b>thousand</b> <b>other</b> people, all partying with these giant speakers all over the place. And this happened just about every weekend." ...|$|E
500|$|Other reviews {{were less}} positive. The Los Angeles Times Carina Chocano felt that [...] "despite flashes of genuine emotion [...] {{eventually}} succumbs {{to its own}} tweeness" [...] and that the [...] "moments of beauty" [...] were outweighed by [...] "the mannered dialogue and hamstrung performances". Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly graded the film as a C, saying that it [...] "travels, but it doesn't go anywhere" [...] and likening Pucci to [...] "a wan, passive Johnny Depp". The Hollywood Reporter critic Frank Scheck praised the film's [...] "appealing performances, sun-dappled cinematography and occasional witty dialogue", but {{thought that it was}} [...] "contrived and derivative" [...] and [...] "a little too pleased with itself". The Globe and Mails Rick Groen called The Go-Getter [...] "a fairly well-made picture that's just been fairly well-made too many times before, a knock-off of a <b>thousand</b> <b>other</b> knock-offs". Gabriel Wilder of The Sydney Morning Herald felt that it was [...] "hard to maintain interest in [...] plight" [...] because of Pucci's underacting and thought that [...] "the script isn't so much quirky as incomplete", referring to the film's ending. With a rating of 2.5 out of 4, Maitland McDonagh wrote for TV Guide that the film is [...] "too familiar to make any great impression".|$|E

They received the honours of the Emperor, with gold and silver, {{and every one of them}} received a different gift. It is known that in both the Parthian Empire and Kushan Empire of Asia, ethnic Greeks continued to be employed after the Hellenistic period as musicians and athletes. The Book of the Later Han states that Emperor An transferred these entertainers from his countryside residence to the capital Luoyang, where they gave a performance at his court and were rewarded with gold, silver, and other gifts. Raoul McLaughlin notes that the Romans knew Burma as India Trans Gangem (India Beyond the Ganges) and that Ptolemy listed the cities of Burma. McLaughlin speculates that the Romans were selling slaves to the Burmese and that this is how the entertainers originally reached Burma before they were sent by the Burmese ruler to Emperor An in China. Syrian jugglers were renowned in Western Classical literature, and Chinese sources from the 2nd century BC to the 2nd century AD mention them as well.|$|E

2500|$|The Augustan era is {{considered}} a high point of British satiric writing, and its masterpieces were Swift's Gulliver's Travels and A Modest Proposal, Pope's Dunciads, Horatian Imitations, and Moral Essays, Samuel Johnson's The Vanity of Human Wishes and London, Henry Fielding's Shamela and Jonathan Wild, and John Gay's The Beggar's Opera. There were several <b>thousand</b> <b>other</b> satirical works written during the period, which have until recently been, by widespread consensus, ignored. The central group of [...] "Scriblerians"—Pope, Swift, Gay, and their colleague John Arbuthnot—are considered to have had common satiric aims.

2500|$|Theophobos {{was born}} to a family {{originally}} belonging to the Iranian aristocracy.

In October/November 833, they were defeated by the armies of Caliph al-Mu'tasim (r. 833–842) under Ishaq ibn Ibrahim. Thus, in 834, Nasr with some fourteen <b>thousand</b> <b>other</b> Khurramites, crossed the Armenian highland and fled to the Byzantine Empire. There, they converted to Christianity, were given widows from military families as wives, and enrolled into the Byzantine army in the so-called [...] "Persian tourma".
