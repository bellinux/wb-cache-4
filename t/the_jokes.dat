5|$|Swedish {{schoolchildren}} tell Bellman {{jokes about}} a person named Bellman, an antihero or modern-day trickster {{with little or no}} connection to the poet. The first known Bellman joke is in a book from 1835, which quoted a letter written in 1808 by a contemporary of Bellman. 19th century Bellman jokes were told by adults and focused on Bellman's life at court; they often related to sex. In the 20th century, the 'Bellman' character became generic, <b>the</b> <b>jokes</b> were told by schoolchildren, and often related to bodily functions. <b>The</b> <b>jokes</b> have been studied by anthropologists and psychologists since the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|The film {{received}} generally positive reviews, with critics {{praising the}} ensemble cast, and each lead {{being singled out}} for their performances across reviews. The plot received a more mixed response; some reviewers felt that its dark, humorous premise was explored well, while others felt <b>the</b> <b>jokes</b> were racist, homophobic and misogynistic. A sequel, Horrible Bosses 2, was released on November 26, 2014.|$|E
5|$|The {{performers}} {{were allowed}} to improvise provided that they maintained factual accuracy. Howick said that improvisation was actually often necessary due to the rapid-fire pace of filming, which left very little {{time to prepare for}} individual roles. On the other hand, both Rickard and Baynton suggest this enforced spontaneity may have ultimately worked to enhance the comedy, not least by preventing <b>the</b> <b>jokes</b> from becoming over-rehearsed.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>joke</b> {{is a form}} {{of humor}} that has not {{received}} as much attention by Serbian folkloristics and anthropology as it deserves. A possible {{reason for this is that}} <b>the</b> <b>joke</b> is so thoroughly incorporated into everyday communication that it tends to be overlooked. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>joke</b> as a form of humor has not even been adequately recognized, witness the lack of an adequate definition and the fact that it is frequently confused with similiar forms of folklore, such as the (vic). This paper examines the form, use and meaning of <b>the</b> <b>joke</b> in Serbian society today, and then proceeds to offer a distinct definition of <b>the</b> <b>joke,</b> at <b>the</b> same time specifying the distinctions between <b>the</b> <b>joke</b> and similar forms of humor. Finally, it addresses the question of the place that <b>the</b> <b>joke</b> should be assigned in folklore material, and also its significance in anthropological and folkloristic research...|$|R
60|$|He laughed furiously at the {{dialogue}} between Pete-Rosenheim & Larose-Bettina, though it contained <b>the</b> cheese <b>joke,</b> <b>the</b> mother-in-law <b>joke,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>joke</b> about <b>the</b> wife rifling her husband's pockets.|$|R
50|$|The {{second section}} {{includes}} {{a discussion on}} the psychological origins and motives of <b>the</b> <b>joke</b> and <b>the</b> <b>joke</b> as a social process.|$|R
5|$|The {{years from}} 1949 to 1953 are often {{considered}} {{the highlight of}} Vandersteen's career, when he combined large production with consistent high quality in his stories, <b>the</b> <b>jokes,</b> the many characters, and the graphical aspects, in which the charming quirkiness of the early years was balanced with the more rigorous ligne claire of Hergé. Many of these stories were loosely based on popular classics, ranging from Alexandre Dumas over Buffalo Bill to Richard Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen, with as culmination his comic in {{two parts of the}} legend of Till Eulenspiegel, made for Kuifje.|$|E
5|$|We write jokes, and <b>the</b> <b>jokes</b> are funny. With a game, the fourth, fifth, sixth, 80th, 100 millionth time you've {{seen that}} joke it becomes not funny, then you lose faith in it, {{and then you}} {{question}} it, and you go round this emotional circle...We've always liked fresh-baked stuff a little better but, with a video game, it doesn't work that way. But the game isn't just a collection of funny South Park scenes, hopefully it's more than that.|$|E
5|$|As the game's {{dialogue}} {{consists of}} a lot of wordplay and misunderstandings, Smith would analyze scenes before writing them: he would see what the scenes were trying to accomplish, and where the beats in them were. After he had the structure of a scene in his head, he would write it; at times he was able {{to make use of the}} original Japanese dialogue, but most of the time he had to come up with new ideas himself. At several points, the English wordplay was inspired by the wordplay in the Japanese version. At some points, it was not possible to do wordplay in the same places as in the Japanese version, so Smith would change the structure of the scene slightly. At other points, Smith came up with a joke or funny line, and changed the scene to make the joke work. Around half of <b>the</b> <b>jokes</b> were rewritten based on the characters present in the scene, rather than being translations of the Japanese jokes.|$|E
5000|$|In 2005, Jackie Martling's website cited [...] "The Aristocrats" [...] as {{appearing}} on page 987 of Gershon Legman's Rationale of <b>the</b> Dirty <b>Joke,</b> Second Series, published in 1975. Legman retells <b>the</b> <b>joke,</b> complete with its traditional vaudevillian flourishes, {{although he does}} not attribute <b>the</b> <b>joke</b> to vaudeville roots. Instead, Legman learned <b>the</b> <b>joke</b> from {{a young man who}} grew up in a broken home.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>joke</b> {{typically}} {{starts with}} the home or favoured nationality and ends with the nationality and associated stereotype against which <b>the</b> <b>joke</b> is made. For example, in England, <b>the</b> <b>joke</b> begins [...] "An Englishman, an Irishman and a Scotsman..." [...] whereas in Ireland it begins [...] "Paddy Irishman, Paddy Englishman, and Paddy Scotsman".|$|R
5000|$|One more type of anti-humor {{is found}} in <b>the</b> <b>joke</b> [...] "No soap radio". <b>The</b> <b>joke</b> is meant to have no punch line. When someone tells <b>the</b> <b>joke,</b> it is most likely with their friends, and {{it is meant to}} confuse others who don't know that there isn't {{supposed}} to be a joke.|$|R
5|$|The manga {{was well}} {{received}} by Japanese-language readers; several volumes {{have appeared in}} the top manga sales charts. The North American English translations were less popular, but still ranked several times in the top 100 as well as ranking 145th for overall manga series sales in 2008. Critics of the English-language translation have been positive overall, praising Kobayashi for his art style and overall use of humor. However, the manga has received some criticism, mostly centered on some of <b>the</b> <b>jokes</b> and repetitive plot. The anime adaptation also sold well in Japan and was praised by Kobayashi and—for the English-language translation—critics. The decision by Media Factory to aggressively pursue its intellectual property rights for School Rumble is believed by proponents of fansubs to have had a negative impact on the franchise's release and sales in the North American market.|$|E
5|$|Michael decides {{the workers}} are {{stressed}} because they are reluctant to express their feelings, so he organizes a comedic roast of himself in the warehouse. Dwight tricks most of the employees into signing his apology letter by pretending it is a sign-in sheet, but Phyllis (Phyllis Smith) catches on and refuses to sign it. Each {{of the office and}} warehouse workers gleefully take jabs at Michael, who initially seems to enjoy <b>the</b> <b>jokes,</b> but grows increasingly uncomfortable and offended. When it comes time for him to roast his employees, Michael ends up storming out of the warehouse, visibly upset. After the roast, Michael takes a personal day (much to the concern of his employees, who start to feel bad about the scathing jokes towards Michael) and spends time at a playground to reflect, feeding pigeons by tossing whole slices of bread on the ground and making bird noises, despite the lack of birds in the winter weather. Dwight tricks Phyllis into signing his apology letter by bribing a mailman to ask her to sign for a fake package. Michael returns to the office, where he roasts each of his co-workers with one-liners. Stanley laughs heartily when Michael roasts him, breaking the tension. Michael tells his employees that they are the reason he got into the paper business, and they applaud him.|$|E
25|$|Zaka {{headlines}} one of Pakistan's most {{listened to}} radio shows, The Fasi Zaka and Friends Show, on Pakistan's FM radio station Radio One FM 91, which is aired nationally. The show is aired {{three times a}} week, and {{is known for its}} absurdist humour and liberal politics embedded in <b>the</b> <b>jokes.</b>|$|E
5000|$|False {{understanding}} - {{when the}} victim acts as if <b>the</b> <b>joke</b> is humorous, {{when in fact}} the victim does not understand <b>the</b> <b>joke</b> at all.|$|R

5000|$|In the beginning, Barney, Ted and Marshall are all {{laughing}} at a joke that Barney had just told them. When Lily arrives, Barney decides {{to tell her}} <b>the</b> dirty <b>joke,</b> despite Ted and Marshall objecting and calling <b>the</b> <b>joke</b> [...] "guy funny". <b>The</b> <b>joke</b> has an unrevealed punch line, with Ted telling his kids that <b>the</b> <b>joke</b> was <b>the</b> dirtiest he had ever heard and that he wasn't going to tell his kids <b>the</b> <b>joke.</b> Lily then gets up from the booth and walks away, with Ted saying that Lily avoided the group for four weeks.|$|R
25|$|Since the {{beginning}} of his political career, Estrada has been the butt of many jokes in the Philippines. The majority of <b>the</b> <b>jokes</b> about him center around his limited English vocabulary, while others focus on his corruption scandals. During his presidential campaign in 1998, Estrada authorized the distribution of the joke compilation book ERAPtion: How to Speak English Without Really Trial.|$|E
25|$|Many drum dances are {{competitive}} in nature, featuring two song cousins who humorously sing and dance, while {{pointing out the}} flaws in the other. This is generally a light-hearted, convivial event, but is also sometimes used to settle serious duels between warring families or individuals; <b>the</b> <b>jokes</b> are prepared {{ahead of time and}} the person who evokes the most laughter from the audience is considered the victor.|$|E
25|$|In 1984, the Minnesota Opera {{commissioned}} Casanova's Homecoming, with text by the composer; {{it went on}} to a well-received run at New York City Opera. At {{the insistence}} of Beverly Sills, then musical director of the company, the opera was the first in New York City to be performed in English and accompanied with English supertitles. She wanted to ensure that the audience would understand all <b>the</b> <b>jokes.</b> The opera won the 1986 National Institute for Music Theatre Award.|$|E
5000|$|... "I think <b>the</b> <b>joke</b> is on... I don’t {{know who}} <b>the</b> <b>joke</b> is on, really. I don’t {{even know if}} there is a joke." [...] — Banksy's former {{spokesman}} Steve Lazarides ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>joke</b> {{ends with}} <b>the</b> agent, shocked but often impressed, asking [...] "And {{what do you}} call the act?" [...] The punchline of <b>the</b> <b>joke</b> is then given: [...] "'The Aristocrats'".|$|R
5000|$|In retrospect, {{the writers}} were unsure what <b>the</b> <b>joke</b> in Father Purcell's line [...] "Ah, it's yourself!" [...] was. Linehan thought <b>the</b> <b>joke</b> was that Purcell {{believed}} the throw blanket was really Jesus, while Mathews thought <b>the</b> <b>joke</b> was that Purcell would simply talk to anything. The credits scene, where Father Purcell talks {{to himself in}} the closet, was almost entirely improvised by Keaton.|$|R
25|$|Matt Fowler of IGN {{said the}} episode had several laugh-out-loud moments, that he {{appreciated}} the Eye of Gulga Grymna story arc and liked the twist that Kröd's prudishness actually {{proved to be}} an asset in battle. But Fowler also said many of <b>the</b> <b>jokes</b> remain too obvious and juvenile and that the supporting characters are being underused; he said the fact that Aneka has spent the last few episodes having sex with Longshaft was particularly offensive.|$|E
25|$|Many older {{students}} {{reacted to the}} event by creating black comedy jokes {{similar to those that}} circulated after the Challenger disaster. A study of the incidence of <b>the</b> <b>jokes</b> showed that they were told only in areas where stations showed uncensored footage of the press conference. At least one reporter present at Dwyer's suicide suffered from being a witness. Tony Romeo, a radio reporter, was standing a few feet from Dwyer. After the suicide, Romeo developed depression and took a break from journalism.|$|E
25|$|One time Bob Burns, the hillbilly comic, {{was on the}} show, and {{he threw}} in {{a few of his}} folksy farm stories, which of course were not in Bill Morrow's script. Today they wouldn't seem very off-color, but things were {{different}} on radio then. They got enormous laughs, which just went on and on. We couldn't use <b>the</b> <b>jokes,</b> but Bill asked us to save the laughs. A couple of weeks later he had a show that wasn't very funny, and he insisted that we put in the salvaged laughs. Thus the laugh-track was born.|$|E
5000|$|The miserable beggar {{said to the}} King of France, [...] "Thy {{image is}} {{everywhere}} except in my pocket."One has seen that to laugh is to disarm hate and anger and to extract from some judges indulgence for a sin. In a word, <b>the</b> good <b>joke,</b> applied appropriately to any subject, {{has the effect of}} sweetening the deal for us:Ridiculum acrifortius et melius magnus plerumque secat res. - Horace(A good joke often cuts an important deal strongly and sweetly.)But, like any free action, <b>the</b> <b>joke</b> submits to <b>the</b> law of morality; <b>the</b> <b>joke</b> is virtuous or <b>the</b> <b>joke</b> is evil. In general, <b>the</b> <b>joke</b> only has moral value in the mouth of a morally serious person.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>joke</b> {{typically}} places <b>the</b> three {{characters in}} a scenario. [...] How each person in <b>the</b> <b>joke</b> reacts to <b>the</b> scenario is then explained in order by person, the final reaction being the punch line, playing up to the stereotype of that nationality. <b>The</b> <b>joke</b> uses <b>the</b> rule of three, the first two characters being used {{to set up an}} expectation which is then subverted in some way by the third.|$|R
50|$|A FAQ of rec.humor {{gave the}} {{following}} tongue-in-cheek description how <b>jokes</b> propagated in <b>the</b> era of newsgroups:#Somebody makes up <b>the</b> joke.#The <b>joke</b> spreads to about 50 people.#Somebody posts it to rec.humor.#Ten thousand people read <b>the</b> <b>joke</b> on rec.humor.#Eight hundred {{of these people}} repeat <b>the</b> <b>joke</b> to somebody.#Twenty of _those_ people are clueless enough to repost <b>the</b> <b>joke</b> to rec.humor, apparently lacking either the reading skills to have seen it the first time, the basic pattern-recognition capability to identify it in its last ten repetitions, or the short-term memory to realize that it's <b>the</b> same <b>joke</b> again.#Loop back to step 4, about ten times.#Repeat from step 3 about every two months.|$|R
25|$|The {{original}} {{comic book}} series reappeared in early 1986 with issue #32, written by Grant. Grant {{had in fact}} written the story as a topical humor four years before, {{and as a result}} <b>the</b> <b>jokes</b> were outdated {{at the time it was}} published. Issue #33, a parody of Bride of Frankenstein, written by Christopher Stager, appeared nine months later, along with a three-issue adaptation of the movie. A text article in Howard the Duck #33 explained that Harvey Pekar, himself a Cleveland resident, was mentioned as a possible writer for that issue, but he was unavailable, and nothing came of it.|$|E
25|$|In 2014, 80 {{episodes of}} the show were made {{available}} for purchase or rental on the video streaming site Vimeo. Shout! has uploaded some episodes to YouTube with annotations, as documented by The Annotated MST fansite, to {{explain some of the}} sources of <b>the</b> <b>jokes</b> in the riffs. In February 2015, Shout! launched its own streaming service, Shout! Factory TV, of which selected episodes of MST3K were included on the service. Selected episodes were also made available on demand through RiffTrax starting in November 2015. Twenty episodes from previous MST3K seasons were released by Netflix in all regions in anticipation of the revival series.|$|E
25|$|From the 2007–08 season {{through the}} 2013-14 season, {{commercials}} for the NBA on ESPN have always featured a recreational vehicle taking NBA players, ESPN announcers, mascots, and even celebrities to a cross-country tour. During each commercial, the featured NBA player or mascot always employ a prank on an ESPN broadcast personality. Most of <b>the</b> <b>jokes</b> have featured Mike Breen and Jeff Van Gundy as the 'victims' of each prank. Following {{the success of}} the commercials, the NBA on ESPN RV became an iconic figure of NBA broadcasts on the network, and it is prominently seen on select on NBA arenas during games covered by ESPN, during which arriving fans take a tour of the RV and participate in various activities.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are many}} {{extensions}} to <b>the</b> <b>joke,</b> such as [...] "There are 10 {{types of people}} in the world: those who understand binary, those who don't and those who didn't realize <b>the</b> <b>joke</b> was in base three." ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>joke,</b> {{as first}} {{delivered}} in the film, contains the set-up line [...] "What the heck do you call an act like that?" [...] followed by the punchline [...] "I call it 'The Aristocrats'." [...] In subsequent renditions of <b>the</b> <b>joke,</b> <b>the</b> agent asks, [...] "What do you call your act?" ...|$|R
50|$|Another type of anti-joke is <b>the</b> {{nonsense}} <b>joke,</b> {{defined as}} having “a surprising or incongruous punch line” which provides either no resolution at all, or only a partial, unsatisfactory resolution. One {{example of this}} is the No soap radio punch line. Here the anticipated resolution to <b>the</b> <b>joke</b> is absent and the audience becomes the butt of <b>the</b> <b>joke.</b>|$|R
