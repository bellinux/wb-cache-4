5|$|After Mellotronics had {{targeted}} them as {{a potential}} customer, the BBC Radiophonic Workshop became interested in <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> of the instrument, hoping it {{would allow them to}} increase throughput. The corporation used two custom-made models that employed recorded sound effects throughout 1963 and 1964, but had problems with fluctuating tape speed and found the sound wasn't up to professional broadcast quality. The Mellotron was eventually dropped in favour of electronic oscillators and synthesizers.|$|E

Most of the priory {{had been used}} by Hearst to refurbish St Donat's Castle in Wales in the late 1920s, but the tithe barn had been crated and shipped to San Simeon for possible use there. Hearst proposed that the unused Bradenstoke barn be incorporated into his great castle, and had Morgan study <b>the</b> <b>possibilities.</b>|$|E

30|$|The {{concept of}} the fuzzy set theory was {{initiated}} by Zadeh via the membership function [22]. In order to measure a fuzzy event, <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> measure is proposed. Since then <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> theory has been studied by many researchers. Although <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> measure has been widely used, it does not possess the self-duality property. Thus, if <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> measure equals one {{it does not mean}} the event will happen definitely, while the event may happen even though <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> measure is zero. So the solution to the fuzzy decision problem has been a mathematical conundrum for a long time.|$|R

5|$|Compton {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} X-rays on the sodium and chlorine nuclei in salt.

In 1934, he returned to England as Eastman visiting professor at Oxford University. While there General Electric asked him to report on activities at General Electric Company plc's research laboratory at Wembley. Compton was intrigued by <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> of the research there into fluorescent lamps. His report prompted a research program in America that developed it.|$|E
5|$|In 2001 an {{extrasolar planet}} similar {{in size to}} Jupiter {{designated}} HD 28185 b was discovered in orbit around the star with a period of 1.04 years.

5|$|Microbes {{feature in}} many highly dramatized films.

Another classic film, Ingmar Bergman's 1957 The Seventh Seal, deals with the plague theme very differently, with the grim reaper directly represented by an actor in a hood. More recently, the 1971 The Andromeda Strain, based on a novel by Michael Crichton, portrayed an extraterrestrial microbe contaminating the Earth.|$|E
5|$|On the average, {{space is}} {{observed}} {{to be very}} nearly flat (close to zero curvature), meaning that Euclidean geometry is empirically true with high accuracy {{throughout most of the}} Universe.

However, present observations cannot exclude <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> that the Universe has more dimensions and that its spacetime may have a multiply connected global topology, in analogy with the cylindrical or toroidal topologies of two-dimensional spaces.|$|E
5|$|The {{nineteenth century}} saw some major {{engineering}} projects including Thomas Telford's (1757–1834) stone Dean Bridge (1829–31) and iron Craigellachie Bridge (1812–14). In the 1850s <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> of new wrought- and cast-iron construction were explored {{in the building}} of commercial warehouses in Glasgow. This adopted a round-arched Venetian style first used by Alexander Kirkland (1824–92) at the heavily ornamented 37–51 Miller Street (1854) and translated into iron in John Baird I's Gardner's Warehouse (1855–6), with an exposed iron frame and almost uninterrupted glazing. Most industrial buildings avoided this cast-iron aesthetic, like William Spence's (1806?–83) Elgin Engine Works built in 1856-8, using massive rubble blocks.|$|E
