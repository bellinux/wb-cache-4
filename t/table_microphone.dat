40|$|Location: Kwamalasamutu, Suriname The {{village of}} Kwamalasamutu is a {{multi-ethnic}} village {{situated on the}} Sipaliwini river, with a fluctuating population of 800 - 1000 inhabitants. The population is composed {{of a majority of}} Trio (Tarëno) and several minority groups. The Katwena (Tunayana) group has about 200 members. The recordings were made during fieldwork trips to Kwamalasamutu in January-March 2006 and February-April 2007. Recordings: All audio and video recordings were made by the researcher Roland Hem¬mauer. Audio files were recorded on a Hi-MD MiniDisc recorder, using either a headset or a <b>table</b> <b>microphone.</b> Video recordings were made on MiniDV tape. In some cases, the audio track from the video recording rather than from the minidisc had to be used due to failure of the audio equipment. Narratives and life histories were recorded. Texts were transcribed by the researcher {{with the help of the}} narrators themselves. Younger helpers, who had a passive understanding of Katwena and who were occasionally consulted during the first fieldwork period, turn¬ed out to only have an active command of Waiwai and to be unable to reproduce spoken Katwena. Translations were made into Dutch with the help of Tanini, a clinical assistant and former school teacher who speaks (Surinamese) Dutch reasonably fluently. In the course of translation, Tanini also helped to recheck the transcriptions made by the researcher. Some texts have also been translated into Trio...|$|E
50|$|They were {{designed}} for an experience {{to feel as if}} local and remote participants are in the same room. These products offer features including up to three 1080p flat panel displays, special <b>tables,</b> <b>microphones,</b> speakers, cameras, collaboration interfaces and lighting.|$|R
50|$|They {{made it seem}} {{as natural}} as tying their shoes: Ace himself prodded his network to build set <b>tables</b> with <b>microphones</b> {{embedded}} beneath them, {{not in front of}} or above them, the better to ease the prospect of mike fright among their co-performers and allow them to sound like themselves and not actors. Further along that line, Ace refused to rehearse an episode more than once, the better to avoid destroying the spontaneity that made the show work as it did.|$|R
40|$|Three men, {{possibly}} William M. Rice Institute students, {{listening to}} some sort of broadcast from an array of scientific instruments set on a table. Two of the men are standing while the third is seated, with his feet up on the <b>table.</b> A <b>microphone</b> can be seen on the table. The seated man is wearing a light-colored suit, necktie, white sox and loafers, with the man standing immediately behind him is wearing a dark shirt and pullover, with the third man wearing dark suit pants and an open-necked white shirt. This photograph was taken during the 12 th biennial Review of Science and the Arts held at the William M. Rice Institute on April 14 - 15, 1950. Original resource is a black and white photograph...|$|R
40|$|A man {{is seated}} at a <b>table,</b> holding a <b>microphone</b> and looking at a range of {{scientific}} equipment. There is a sheaf of papers {{on the surface of}} the table. He is being observed by two colleagues, who are standing with their backs to the windows, through which a stand of trees is visible. This photograph was taken during the course of the 12 th biennial Review of the Science and Arts, held at the William M. Rice Institute. Original resource is a black and white photograph...|$|R
50|$|Each hybrid {{control room}} also {{features}} an adjacent sound booth that is visible through angled windows {{from the main}} control board. Studio B, which is the smaller of the studios features a 5-seat <b>table</b> with full <b>microphone</b> and headphone wiring integrated into the furniture and is used for interviews and also as a live news booth. Studio D is a larger studio with full connectivity to its adjacent control room and is used for live performances {{on the radio and}} also functions as a recording studio for the production of music.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a simple experiment, {{well suited for}} an undergraduate course in mechanical measurements and/or dynamics, in which physical information is extracted from an acoustic emission signature. In this experiment, a ping-pong ball is dropped onto a hard <b>table</b> surface. A <b>microphone</b> and computer sound system are used to record the audio signal resulting from the ball-table impacts. The times between successive bounces, viewed as "flight times, " are {{used to determine the}} height of the initial drop and the coefficient of restitution of the impact. 1...|$|R
40|$|Dr. William Masterson, flanked on {{his left}} by Board of Trustees member Herb Allen, during the {{controversy}} over his presidency of Rice University. The men are seated at a circular <b>table,</b> covered with <b>microphones</b> of various types and President Masterson is speaking. Behind them is a long narrow table with the Rice University seal {{on the wall above}} it. Original resource is a black and white photograph. A five-day controversy rose on the campus of Rice University in February 1969 following the appointment of Dr. William H. Masterson by the Board of Trustees as the university's new President to succeed Kenneth Pitzer, who had resigned in August 1968...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:In this paper, we have {{introduced}} {{a whole new}} ideaof video conferencing which has become increasingly widespread in the workplace. Currently, recording an important meeting under usual circumstances a person is hired to record the entire process of meeting, where issues of cost, convenience and security arises. A camera can also be installed {{at the edge of}} the conference room in order to capture all the employees and their conversation on the screen. Both the process force people to face in the direction of recording, which makes communication awkward. We have designed a system, to be placed of the centre of the <b>table</b> and uses <b>microphones</b> to locate the speaker and turns the camera to face them so that the emphasis is on the person currently speaking...|$|R
5000|$|There were {{no sound}} effects beyond the almost ambient-like playing of normal life sounds, and the Aces' {{inexperience}} as actors probably worked in their favour: they simply played {{as though they}} were allowing listeners to eavesdrop on their own real-life conversations, allowing Easy Aces listeners more than those of many shows to believe the Aces really could have been their own unusual neighbours. The couple worked from a card <b>table</b> with a <b>microphone</b> sunk in its center, feeling it was easier {{to talk to each other}} in this manner rather than standing at a microphone. In addition, as Arthur Frank Wertheim noted in his book Radio Comedy, Ace shunned belly laughs in favour of consistent character humour. [...] "A lot of times, on the air," [...] Wertheim quoted Ace as saying, [...] "I noticed comics in a sketch do a joke that destroys the character because it gets a big laugh." ...|$|R
