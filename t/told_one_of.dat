5|$|Fischer and Cristina {{often did}} outdoor {{activities}} together, but Fischer's stepmother {{thought they were}} only friends. She said that she never saw them hold hands or behave {{in a way that}} suggested intimacy. According to his friends, Fischer went with Cristina to South Padre Island, Texas, during spring break and had sex with her in her parents' condominium. They said that he did not brag about it, and in fact seemed to regret his decision. Cristina denied this ever happened. Later that year they attended St. Joe's prom together. In June 1992, Fischer broke up with Cristina; he <b>told</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> his friends that their relationship was only physical, and he did not feel an emotional attachment to her. Fischer had given Cristina his ring while they were dating, and once they broke up he asked her to return it. Cristina refused.|$|E
5|$|Though Wiggins did {{not give}} up hope {{for a return to}} baseball, he began to study the {{real-estate}} market after his suspension from the game. In the late 1980s, Wiggins began to suffer from health difficulties related to AIDS, though the diagnosis was not publicly disclosed while he was alive. He was receiving deferred payments from his baseball career, and he began to make plans for the financial future of his children. He <b>told</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> his former teammates that he was getting into computer work. Gwynn said that he had seen Wiggins in the spring of 1990 and was struck by his visible weight loss.|$|E
5|$|In {{the middle}} of 1940, {{following}} the rising tension between the Soviet Union and Germany over territories in the Balkans, an eventual invasion of the Soviet Union seemed to Hitler {{to be the only}} solution. While no concrete plans were made yet, Hitler <b>told</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> his generals in June that the victories in Western Europe finally freed his hands for his important real task: the showdown with Bolshevism. With the successful end to the campaign in France, General Erich Marcks was assigned to the working group drawing up the initial invasion plans of the Soviet Union. The first battle plans were entitled Operation Draft East (but colloquially it was known as the Marcks Plan). His report advocated the A-A line to be the operational objective of any invasion of the Soviet Union. This goal would extend from northern city of Arkhangelsk on the Arctic Sea through Gorky and Rostov to the port city of Astrakhan {{at the mouth of the}} Volga on the Caspian Sea. The report concluded that this military border would reduce the threat to Germany (and the Third Reich) from attacks by enemy bombers.|$|E

25|$|In Greenwood, rumors {{began to}} fly – in particular, {{a report that}} whites were {{storming}} the courthouse. Shortly after 10pm, a second, larger group of approximately 75 armed black men {{decided to go to}} the courthouse. They offered their support to the sheriff, who declined their help. According to witnesses, a white man is alleged to have <b>told</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the armed black men to surrender his pistol. The man refused, and a shot was fired. That first shot may have been accidental, or meant as a warning; it was a catalyst for an exchange of gunfire.|$|E
25|$|In 1975, CBS {{presented}} a made-for-television movie about obedience experiments, The Tenth Level, with William Shatner as Stephen Hunter, a Milgram-like scientist. Milgram was {{a consultant for}} the film, though his personal life did not resemble that of the Shatner character. In this film, incidents were portrayed that never occurred in the followup to the real-life experiment, including a subject's psychotic episode and the main character saying that he regretted the experiment. When asked about the film, Milgram <b>told</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> his graduate students, Sharon Presley, {{that he was not}} happy with the film and told her {{that he did not want}} his name to be used in the credits.|$|E
25|$|Until his death, Borel {{attended}} the lycée professionnel Georges-Cisson in Toulon, {{where he studied}} electromechanics and did quite well academically. He {{was said to be}} a disciplined and quiet student. However, in his last year at school there was a radical change in behavior. He skipped classes without permission or explanation and became unaffable. He regularly said that he could not bear it anymore at home, that he had had enough of doing housework and being called names, and often stated his wish to join the military, like his father and grandfather. Apparently, the week prior to the shooting, he also <b>told</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> his classmates that he would commit suicide, but not before killing two or three people.|$|E

500|$|Gossett {{was widely}} {{known to be}} obsessed with the Cooper hijacking. He amassed a voluminous {{collection}} of Cooper-related news articles, and <b>told</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> his wives that he knew enough about the case to [...] "write the epitaph for D.B. Cooper". Late in his life he reportedly told three of his sons, a retired Utah judge, and {{a friend in the}} Salt Lake City public defender's office that he had committed the hijacking. Photos of Gossett taken circa 1971 bear a close resemblance to the most widely circulated Cooper composite drawing.|$|E
500|$|Lee divided {{his forces}} into {{multiple}} columns, spread apart widely {{as he moved}} into Maryland and also maneuvered to capture the federal arsenal at Harpers Ferry. This was a risky move for a smaller army, but Lee was counting on his knowledge of McClellan's temperament. He <b>told</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> his generals, [...] "He is an able general but a very cautious one. His army {{is in a very}} demoralized and chaotic condition, and will not be prepared for offensive operations—or he will not think it so—for three or four weeks. Before that time I hope to be on the Susquehanna." [...] This was not a completely accurate assessment, but McClellan's army was moving lethargically, averaging only [...] a day.|$|E
500|$|Over {{the next}} few months, the tempo of {{operations}} increased, forcing the Sixth Army to plan and execute multiple operations simultaneously. Operations Reckless and Persecution in April 1944 together comprised the largest operation yet in SWPA, with the 24th and 41st Infantry Divisions of Lieutenant General Robert L. Eichelberger's I Corps landing at Tanahmerah and Humboldt bays near Hollandia, while the 163rd Regimental Combat Team landed at Aitape. Eichelberger was Krueger's most senior subordinate, but {{when he did not}} meet Krueger's expectation, Krueger let him know in no uncertain terms. [...] "In my more than 40 years as an officer", Krueger <b>told</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> his staff, [...] "I have never raised my voice to an enlisted man, but a corps commander should know better." ...|$|E

500|$|AllGame's Brett Alan Weiss {{believed}} that Metroid II would please {{fans of the}} original Metroid. Marcel Van Duyn of Nintendo Life writes that Metroid II [...] "expands on the original title quite nicely", and noted that the difficulty was improved over the original Metroid because of the inclusion of [...] "hot spots" [...] that restores health and missiles. On the other hand, Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com was particularly critical of Metroid II, finding the game painful to play and describing it as [...] "something of a dark spot on a brilliant series' reputation." [...] However, Parish found the game's premise [...] "ambitious", adding that it provided the series a vital crux, as Samus' actions in Metroid II set the plot for Super Metroid and Metroid Fusion. GameTrailers similarly commented that it <b>told</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the most pivotal chapters in the series' overall plot.|$|E

The writers kept pitching {{for him to be}} older and older, eventually debating whether his age would be 57 or 58. [...] They then decided on 60, [...] an idea that could have come from Ron Hauge, one of the Simpsons writers. A few weeks before the discussions, after having found out that he was slightly older than the next oldest writer in the staff, Hauge had <b>told</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the writers, in [...] "the most serious reasonable" [...] voice, that he was 60 years old.

She wrote that, [...] "In factories, I encountered men in small groups, laughing, shouting, 'Get in the kitchen. George needs you there. What {{do you know about}} politics?'" [...] To a friend she wrote, [...] " [...] how open and bare and wide my own vulnerability would be ... the body wounds are deep."

500|$|The {{orders for}} the [...] "cleansing" [...] {{operation}} stated that the Chetniks should kill all Muslim fighters, communists and Ustaše, but {{that they should not}} kill women and children. According to Pajović, these instructions were included to ensure there was no written evidence regarding the killing of non-combatants. On 8 February, one Chetnik commander made a notation on their copy of written orders issued by Đurišić that the detachments had received additional orders to kill all Muslims they encountered. On 10 February, Jovan Jelovac, the commander of the Pljevlja Brigade, who was subordinated to Lukačević, <b>told</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> his battalion commanders that he was to kill everyone, in accordance with the orders of their highest commanders. According to the historian Professor Jozo Tomasevich, despite Chetnik claims that this and previous [...] "cleansing actions" [...] were countermeasures against Muslim aggressive activities, all circumstances point to it being Đurišić's partial achievement of Mihailović's previous directive to clear the Sandžak of Muslims.|$|E

500|$|In {{support of}} this story, Brownlee pointed to investigational work by Harry Brace, a private detective in the employ of Attorney General John Lymburn. [...] According to Brace, Caldwell had told at least three {{witnesses}} that he expected to soon receive {{a large amount of}} money from someone [...] "high up in political life". [...] He also specifically <b>told</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> Brace's agents that he had deliberately set out to frame Brownlee, that in selecting Neil MacLean as his lawyer he had deliberately chosen a Liberal (the Liberals were considered the major opposition to Brownlee's government at the time), and that if the Liberals won the next election there would be [...] "nothing I want I won't be able to get". [...] Disappointingly for Brownlee, Brace did not uncover evidence that MacMillan was lying about the affair itself: Caldwell, based on his comments to Brace's men, seemed very much under the impression that the affair had occurred exactly as claimed. [...] Moreover, Brace found that Carl Snell, MacMillan's one-time suitor, claimed to have been told in 1932 that MacMillan was having a consensual affair with the premier.|$|E

[...] When the Ojibwe signed a treaty ceding lands in 1837, Steele staked a claim to land {{on the east side of}} the Mississippi River adjacent to Saint Anthony Falls.
