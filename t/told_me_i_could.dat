500|$|In 1993, Beckinsale {{landed the}} role of Hero in Kenneth Branagh's big-screen {{adaptation}} of Much Ado About Nothing. It was filmed in Tuscany, Italy, during a summer holiday from Oxford University. She attended the film's Cannes Film Festival premiere and remembered it as an overwhelming experience. [...] "Nobody even <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> bring a friend!" [...] "I had Doc Martens boots on, and I think I put the flower from the breakfast tray in my hair." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone was won over by her [...] "lovely" [...] performance while Vincent Canby of The New York Times noted that she and Robert Sean Leonard [...] "look right and behave with a certain naive sincerity, although they often seem numb with surprise at hearing the complex locutions they speak." [...] The film earned over $22million at the box office. She made three other films while at university. In 1994, she appeared as Christian Bale's love interest in Prince of Jutland, a film based on the Danish legend which inspired Shakespeare's Hamlet, and starred in the murder mystery Uncovered. In 1995, while studying in Paris, she filmed the French language [...]|$|E
500|$|Originally, {{the film}} would stand alone; {{producer}} Kevin Feige said [...] "about half" [...] the movie {{would be set}} during World War II before moving into the modern day. Producer Avi Arad said, [...] "The biggest opportunity with Captain America is as a man 'out of time', coming back today, looking at our world {{through the eyes of}} someone who thought the perfect world was small-town United States. Sixty years go by, and who are we today? Are we better?" [...] He cited the Back to the Future trilogy as an influence, and claimed he had [...] "someone in mind to be the star, and definitely someone in mind to be the director". In February 2006, Arad hoped to have a summer 2008 theatrical release date. Jon Favreau approached Arad to direct the film as a comedy, but he chose to make Iron Man instead. In April 2006, David Self was hired to write the script. He explained that Captain America was his favorite superhero as a child because [...] "my dad <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> one day be Captain America". Joe Johnston met with Marvel to discuss directing the film.|$|E
2500|$|In a 2007 {{interview}} with PETA, Underwood stated, [...] "Ever since I was little I loved animals [...] If you <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> never sing again, I'd {{say that was}} horrible, but it's not my life. If you <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> never be around animals again, I would just die." ...|$|E
60|$|One look at {{her face}} <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> trust her. <b>I</b> {{addressed}} myself again to Mr. Bruff.|$|R
50|$|As Yaffe recalled, “She <b>told</b> <b>me</b> if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{give her}} work there three nights a week, she would quit teaching.” He did and she did.|$|R
6000|$|... "My father {{reminded}} <b>me</b> that <b>I</b> was {{twenty-one years}} old, last birthday--and <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do as <b>I</b> liked. I understood him, and I left the house." ...|$|R
2500|$|Lisa Goldstein portrays Millicent Huxtable, Brooke's {{assistant}} at her shop Clothes Over Bros. [...] "I was constantly auditioning for TV and film while performing in professional theatre", said Goldstein. [...] "My agent in Orlando called {{and told me}} there was an audition for One Tree Hill, and <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> either audition for the receptionist or the quirky fashion assistant, 'Millicent.' I {{jumped at the chance}} to audition for the 'quirky assistant,' I thought it would be fun." [...] She added, [...] " [...] found someone to love her quirks and all, which made her perfectly OK with being exactly who she is." [...] Millicent is involved in a romantic relationship with Marvin [...] "Mouth" [...] McFadden. In the first episode of season 6, she moves to Omaha with him. She returns to Tree Hill during the fifth episode to work for Brooke in her new store. She reunites with Mouth only to endure a series of mishaps.|$|E
2500|$|She {{was born}} Rose August Wenger in Cleveland, Ohio, {{one of five}} girls to Swiss-German parents, Fred and Annie Wegner. [...] Her father had wanted a son, and {{encouraged}} {{her to be a}} tomboy. Helen saw her first Wild West show in Cleveland in the summer of 1909 and answered a Miller Brothers 101 Ranch ad for girl riders in Billboard magazine. They taught her to ride, and she performed in her first 101 Ranch Real Wild West Show in St. Louis in April 1910. [...] Said Helen: [...] "(I) was already practicing picking up a handkerchief from the ground at full gallop. When veteran riders <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get kicked in the head, I paid no heed. Such things might happen to others, but could never happen to me, I believed. We barnstormed all over the US and the season ended all too soon. I was sorry when I had to go home, and could hardly wait to open in Boston in the spring of 1911." ...|$|E
60|$|I was not {{acquainted with}} any officer, seaman, or marine in the Archimandrite; but {{instinct}} <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{not go far}} wrong if I took a third-class ticket to Plymouth.|$|E
6000|$|Violet Wayne {{shook her}} head. “That was pretty, {{but not quite}} sincere,” she said. “In some respects I am older than you—and you are in trouble, dear. Perhaps if you <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{everything}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> help you.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{do believe}} you," [...] he said slowly, but with downcast eyes, [...] "and if I {{did not love}} you before you <b>told</b> <b>me</b> this <b>I</b> <b>could</b> love you now for the part you have taken; but"--He stopped.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do not be {{surprised}} to see these dogs; they are your two brothers. I have condemned them to remain for ten years in these shapes." [...] Then having <b>told</b> <b>me</b> where <b>I</b> <b>could</b> hear news of her, she vanished.|$|R
60|$|I {{washed up}} and combed my hair. My clothes were {{none of the}} best, but they were the best I had, and Mr. Ranson <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get another suit the {{first thing in the}} morning.|$|E
6000|$|... "Lots of times. The old fakir is loafin' around {{close by}} the landin', an' the other one must 'a gone off for somethin'. The Davis Company <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> take any of the boats, an' the minute the thieves start we'll jump right on their trail." ...|$|E
60|$|I dressed myself quickly, {{and then}} went out with Hannah and the major, {{and walked to the}} barracks. On the way the major related at length to me all the occurrences of the night, and from what he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> nearly guess how it had all come about.|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly. You settled it yourself, Oswald. I {{told you}} what I thought myself bound to tell you. Perhaps I used {{language}} which I should not have used. Then you <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not be your wife;--and I thought you were right, quite right." ...|$|R
6000|$|I think, if they <b>told</b> <b>me</b> so <b>I</b> <b>could</b> convulse {{the heavens}} with my horror. <b>I</b> think <b>I</b> <b>could</b> alter {{the frame of}} things in my [...] agony. <b>I</b> think <b>I</b> <b>could</b> break the System with my heart. I think, in my convulsion, the skies would break.|$|R
6000|$|Austin laughed, {{though he}} was a trifle perplexed. [...] "Well," [...] he said, [...] "though you don't {{overwhelm}} me with compliments, as a rule, you have <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> dance before. Now, however, one could almost fancy that the fact didn't meet with your approval." ...|$|R
6000|$|I kept {{silence for}} a little while, {{thinking}} of what Stroeve had <b>told</b> <b>me.</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not stomach his weakness, and he saw my disapproval. [...] "You {{know as well as}} I do how Strickland lived," [...] he said tremulously. [...] "I couldn't let her live in those circumstances -- I simply couldn't." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Maybe so. But I'M {{not going}} home through the Bailey garden any more. Here's Jerry {{with a big}} string of trout and it's my turn to cook them. Jem and Jerry both say I'm the best cook in the Glen. And Cornelia <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> bring up this batch of cookies. I all but dropped them when I saw Henry's ghost." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{had come}} to look upon the {{inhabitants}} of the Hall as mere eccentrics, but after what young Mordaunt Heatherstone had just <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> no longer doubt that some dark and sinister meaning underlay all their actions. The more I pondered over the problem, the more unanswerable did it appear, and yet I could not get the matter out of my thoughts.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{then fell}} across the Irish porter I told you of. He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{whereabouts}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get lodgings, and advised me {{to apply to}} {{one of the men who}} let out a number of sedan chairs, to hire one out to me by the week.|$|R
6000|$|SHE: [...] "Please {{sit down}} while I write a receipt." [...] She places herself {{deliberately}} at the table, and opens her portfolio. [...] "I will pay you now, Mr. Ransom, {{for the first}} six lessons you gave me--the ones before you <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> never learn to do anything." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{had drawn}} out my balance from the savings bank, matter of two pounds and more, {{to make this}} purchase, and I found it at last a very easy transaction. The {{pawnbroker}} <b>told</b> <b>me</b> where <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get ammunition, and I went home that night with bulging pockets, an armed man.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Nimmie Amee did {{not mention}} her friend's name, and I did not ask her. She took with her all that she could carry of the goods {{that were in the}} Witch's house, and she <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have the rest. But when I went there I found nothing worth taking except some magic powders that I {{did not know how to}} use, and a bottle of Magic Glue." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Janet <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{have the}} use of the parlor when any young men called! I don't think there are many to call. I haven't seen a young man in Valley Road yet, except the next-door hired boy--Sam Toliver, a very tall, lank, tow-haired youth. He came over one evening {{recently}} and sat for an hour on the garden fence, near the front porch where Janet and I were doing fancy-work. The only remarks he volunteered in all that time were, 'Hev a peppermint, miss! Dew now-fine thing for carARRH, peppermints,' and, 'Powerful lot o' jump-grasses round here ternight. Yep.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, {{suspended}} until Doctor Wallington can {{investigate the}} whole matter more thoroughly. He {{wanted me to}} apologize to Sharp, and I said flatly that I wouldn't do it, because I hadn't anything to apologize for. He got mad at first, and threatened me with instant dismissal. Then I warmed up, and said I was innocent of all wrongdoing, and perhaps I'd {{be able to prove}} it some day, and if so, and I was dismissed, I'd sue the college for loss of reputation. That brought matters to a head, and I guess the doctor saw I was in deadly earnest. He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> consider myself suspended for two weeks, or until he could {{get to the bottom of}} the affair. So I've got a holiday." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{understand}} now, Roland, {{and quite}} {{agree with you}} as to your course. I am very glad that you have <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> for before, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not make you out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why {{were you}} so weak, mother, as to admit such an enemy to your house--one so {{obviously}} your evil genius--much less accept {{him as a}} husband, after so long? If you had only <b>told</b> <b>me</b> all, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have advised you better! But I suppose I {{have no right to}} reproach him, bitter as I feel, and even though he has blighted my life for ever!' ...|$|R
5000|$|For {{nearly two}} years Ratheesh spearheaded Music Talks on Malayalam channel Asianet. This show also {{provided}} the turnaround in Ratheesh's career. [...] "It was during this time that I met Gopi Sunder, the noted music director and programmer. He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> try my hand at composing music and also introduced me to {{many people in the}} music field. I believed in Gopi Sunder." [...] -says Ratheesh Vega.|$|R
60|$|It is {{impossible}} to express his surprise at this relation, and the double importunity which he used with me to discover it to him. He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not be called kind to him, nay, I could not be faithful to him if I concealed it from him. I told him I thought so too, and yet I could not do it. He went back to what I had said before to him, {{and told me he}} hoped it did not relate to what I had said in my passion, and that he had resolved to forget all that as the effect of a rash, provoked spirit. I told him I wished I could forget it all too, but that {{it was not to be}} done, the impression was too deep, and I could not do it: it was impossible.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course I {{was delighted}} with this present," [...] {{continued}} Miss Cuttenclip, [...] "and at once {{set to work}} and made several paper dolls, which, {{as soon as they}} were cut out, began to walk around and talk to me. But they were so thin that I found that any breeze would blow them over and scatter them dreadfully; so Glinda found this lonely place for me, where few people ever come. She built the wall to keep any wind from blowing away my people, and <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> build a paper village here and be its Queen. That is why I came here and settled down to work and started the village you now see. It was many years ago that I built the first houses, and I've kept pretty busy and made my village grow finely; and I need not tell you that I am very happy in my work." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I one day asked M. Nicole {{what was}} the {{character}} of Mme. de [...] Longueville’s intellect; {{he told me it}} was very subtle and delicate [...] in the penetration of character; but very small, very feeble, and [...] that her comprehension was extremely narrow in matters of science and [...] reasoning, and on all speculations that did not concern matters of [...] sentiment. For example, he added, I one day said to her that I could [...] wager and demonstrate that there were in Paris at least two [...] inhabitants who had the same number of hairs, although I could not [...] point out who these two men were. She <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> never be sure [...] of it until I had counted the hairs of these two men. Here is my [...] demonstration, I said: I take it for granted that the head which is [...] most amply supplied with hairs has not more than 200,000, and the [...] head which is least so has but one hair. Now, if you suppose that [...] 200,000 heads have each a different number of hairs, it necessarily [...] follows that they have each one of the numbers of hairs which form [...] the series from one to 200,000; for if it were supposed that there [...] were two among these 200,000 who had the same number of hairs, I [...] should have gained my wager. Supposing, then, that these 200,000 [...] inhabitants have all a different number of hairs, if I add a single [...] inhabitant who has hairs, and who has not more than 200,000, it [...] necessarily follows that this number of hairs, whatever it may be, [...] will be contained in the series from one to 200,000, and consequently [...] will be equal to the number of hairs on one of the previous 200,000 [...] inhabitants. Now as, instead of one inhabitant more than 200,000, [...] there an nearly 800,000 inhabitants in Paris, you see clearly that [...] there must be many heads which have an equal number of hairs, though [...] I have not counted them. Still Mme. de Longueville could never [...] comprehend that this equality of hairs could be demonstrated, and [...] always maintained that the only way of proving it was to count them.” ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} after Ice-T was encountering censorship problems on tour. In The Ice Opinion: Who Gives a Fuck? the rapper states that [...] "People had already <b>told</b> <b>me</b> what <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not say onstage in Columbus, Georgia.

6000|$|His gloves {{were the}} saddest ruin, but he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> where <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get some like them. His shoes would hardly hold walnuts without leaking, {{but he liked}} to put his {{feet up on the}} mantelpiece and {{contemplate}} them. He wore a dim glass breastpin, which he called a [...] "morphylitic diamond"--whatever that may mean--and said only two of them had ever been found--the Emperor of China had the other one.|$|R
