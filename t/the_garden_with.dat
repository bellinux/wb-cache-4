5|$|In {{the palace}} garden Armida prepares to kill Almirena. Rinaldo draws his sword, but Armida is {{protected}} from his wrath by spirits. Suddenly Goffredo and Eustazio arrive, {{but as they}} touch <b>the</b> <b>garden</b> <b>with</b> their wands it disappears, leaving them all on an empty plain {{with the city of}} Jerusalem visible in the distance. Armida, after a last attempt to kill Almirena, also disappears as Rinaldo strikes her with his sword. The remaining four celebrate their reunion, while Goffredo announces that the attack on Jerusalem will begin the next day.|$|E
5|$|The first {{national}} college-level basketball championship, the National Invitation Tournament, {{was held in}} New York in 1938 and remains in the city. The New York Knicks started play in 1946 {{as one of the}} National Basketball Association's original teams, playing their first home games at the 69th Regiment Armory, before making Madison Square Garden their permanent home. The New York Liberty of the WNBA have shared <b>the</b> <b>Garden</b> <b>with</b> the Knicks since their creation in 1997 as one of the league's original eight teams. Rucker Park in Harlem is a playground court, famed for its streetball style of play, where many NBA athletes have played in the summer league.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} centres on the double-height entrance hall, {{with the}} theme of Time. The painted ceiling depicts the astrological signs of the constellations, arranged in the positions they held when the house was first occupied. A large stained glass window contains four female figures representing Dawn, Noon, Twilight and Night. A mosaic floor in the entrance hall contains a labyrinth design, with the centre depicting the myth of Theseus slaying the Minotaur. The garden's entrance door, also covered in bronze, is decorated with a relief of the Madonna and Child. As elsewhere, Burges incorporated earlier designs, the bronze doors echoing those at Cork Cathedral, and the maze floor recalling an earlier ceiling at Burges's office at 15 Buckingham Street. Emblems adorn the five doors on the ground floor, each one relevant to their respective room. A flower marked the door to <b>the</b> <b>garden,</b> <b>with</b> the front door marked by a key. The library is indicated by an open book, the drawing or music room by musical instruments, and the dining room by a bowl and flask of wine.|$|E

5|$|Very {{little is}} known about the mid-18th century planting, {{although}} there remains, in front of the house, a gnarled black mulberry tree, which was described as ancient in 1822. However, 19th-century drawings and photographs record increasingly elaborate and fussy bedding schemes, finally swept away in the 1960s. Today there is a more informal style, emphasising the architectural character of <b>the</b> <b>garden</b> <b>with</b> its long straight sweeps of wall; it is also an easier style to maintain. In recent years, native wild plants have been allowed to mingle with rare and exotic specimens and continual thought is being given to contrasting textures and colours of foliage. The lower garden, below the front of the house, now has the air of a small arboretum with a number of fine specimen trees, such as a splendid late-leafing catalpa (an oriental plane tree) dominates this part of the garden and the grass at its foot is left uncut during the Spring, allowing camassias and bluebells to make a fine showing.|$|E
5|$|With Ultimecia defeated, the {{universe}} begins returning to normal; however, Squall is nearly {{lost in the}} flow of time as he witnesses the origins of the game's story, ghostly, sporadic apparitions of Rinoa, and a faceless portrait of himself. When a dying Ultimecia travels back in time to pass her powers to Edea, Squall informs Edea of the concepts of Garden and SeeD that she will create. Afterward, he is able to properly recollect his memories and thus return to the present with Rinoa's help. Seifer, no longer a Garden member, is once again reunited with Raijin and Fujin; Laguna visits Raine's grave (and remembers his proposal to her) along with Ellone, Ward, and Kiros; and a celebration takes place in <b>the</b> <b>Garden,</b> <b>with</b> Squall and Rinoa sharing a kiss under the moonlight.|$|E

Mueller was dismissed from his position as director of <b>the</b> Botanic <b>Gardens</b> on 31 May 1873.

Tancredi, however, insists that he is fighting for a very good reason. Later, as the Prince gets dressed, he realizes the practicality of Tancredi's words. As he ponders the coming upheavals, he realizes that his nephew is more aristocratically like-minded than he thought.|$|E
25|$|A finial from Chapelton House or {{possibly}} a 'wheat sheaf' {{from the old}} Monks' Well {{is used as a}} feature in the gardens. Apart from pure ornamentation the finial can also function as a lightning rod, and was once believed to act as a deterrent to witches on broomsticks attempting to land on one's roof. On making her final landing approach to a roof, the witch, spotting the obstructing finial, was forced to sheer off and land elsewhere. An old lintel from a door is recorded in 1939 as being built into a wall in <b>the</b> <b>garden</b> <b>with</b> the inscription 'S.M. 1740', possibly standing for one of the 'Miller' family'.|$|E

25|$|The {{structure}} {{of the house is}} steel-reinforced, with a buff-colored stucco exterior, built on a concrete foundation. Its overall design and decoration emphasizes a clean, modern aesthetic while serving practical functions and staying in harmony with natural surroundings. Overhanging eaves, with a 7-foot projection of the roof at the front (east) side of the house, emphasize the building’s horizontality while also regulating heat and light at its entrance. A front wall of art glass windows connects the dwelling’s interior to <b>the</b> <b>garden,</b> <b>with</b> bands of windows on the upper story adding to the sense of horizontality. Wooden piers and trim were all given “jin-di-sugi” treatment, a wood-aging technique based on traditional Japanese techniques using the application of chemicals or burning to artificially age wood.|$|E
25|$|Much like {{records of}} the great flood, the {{creation}} story and {{the account of the}} confusion of languages, the story of Eden echoes the Mesopotamian myth of a king, as a primordial man, who is placed in a divine garden to guard the Tree of life. The Hebrew Bible depicts Adam and Eve as walking around the Garden of Eden naked due to their innocence. Eden and its rivers may signify the real Jerusalem, the Temple of Solomon, or the Promised Land. It may also represent the divine garden on Zion, and the mountain of God, which was also Jerusalem. The imagery of <b>the</b> <b>Garden,</b> <b>with</b> its serpent and cherubim, has been compared to the images of the Solomonic Temple with its copper serpent (the nehushtan) and guardian cherubs.|$|E

500|$|In 1848, {{the land}} was subject to the {{significant}} legal case of Tulk v Moxhay. The plot's previous owner, Moxhay, had agreed upon a covenant not to erect buildings but the law would not allow buyers who were not [...] "privy" [...] to the initial contract to be bound by subsequent promises. The judge, Lord Cottenham, decided that future owners could be bound by promises to abstain from activity. Otherwise, a buyer could sell land to himself to undermine an initial promise. James Wyld bought {{the assets of the}} garden from the Tulk and Moxhay's deaths in 1849 in order to erect the Great Globe, though buried the statue of George I under 12 foot of earth with the globe stuck on top. The statue was subsequently uncovered following the globe's demise, but by 1866 it had deteriorated due to vandalism and was sold for £16. Arguments continued about the fate of <b>the</b> <b>garden,</b> <b>with</b> Charles Augustus Tulk's heirs erecting a wooden hoarding around the property in 1873. These were quickly removed after the Master of the Rolls ordered that the land must be preserved for its original purpose.|$|E
500|$|Aside {{from the}} mini-studio, the attic {{contained}} two other rooms: a small guest bedroom and a games room used for recreation. Lennon {{filled it with}} three full sets of the model car racing game, Scalextric. When not in the attic, Lennon could usually {{be found in the}} sunroom watching television or reading newspapers. He would also walk in <b>the</b> <b>garden</b> <b>with</b> his black cat on his shoulder (he had ten cats in total). His drug intake, particularly LSD and hashish, but also amphetamine, was high for much of the time he lived at Kenwood. Drugs were taken there in the company of people such as Marianne Faithfull's ex-husband John Dunbar and art dealer Robert Fraser. At one stage, under the influence of transcendental meditation, Lennon renounced both meat-eating and drugs, and buried a huge quantity of LSD in the garden, which had been obtained by representatives of The Beatles at the Monterey Pop Festival from Augustus Stanley Owsley III. He later tried to find the LSD, but could not remember where he had buried it. Although none [...] of the lavish parties they had planned took place - which remained a source of disappointment to Cynthia - various guests (including Monkee Michael Nesmith and his wife Phyllis, Bob Dylan and Peter Cook) stayed or dined at the house, together with old friends like Ivan Vaughan and Shotton from Liverpool, or strangers Lennon had met at a party or nightclub, such as the Ad Lib. Cynthia and Lennon were beginning to lead separate lives by 1967, and it was not uncommon for Cynthia to {{wake up in the morning}} to find the house filled with people in various states of intoxication whom Lennon had met in clubs the night before. Large parts of the house were unused by the Lennons, and visitors remarked that there was frequently a strange atmosphere.|$|E
500|$|On July 14, 1918, local priests at Yekaterinburg {{conducted}} a private church {{service for the}} family and reported that Maria and her family, contrary to custom, fell on their knees during the prayer for the dead. The following day, on July 15, Maria and her sisters appeared in good spirits as they joked {{with one another and}} moved the beds in their room so visiting cleaning women could scrub the floor. They got down on their hands and knees to help the women and whispered to them when the guards weren't looking. All four young women wore long black skirts and white silk blouses, the same clothing they had worn the previous day. Their short hair was [...] "tumbled and disorderly." [...] They boasted that Maria was so strong she could lift Alexei and told the women how much they enjoyed physical exertion and wished there was more of it for them to do in the Ipatiev House. On the afternoon of July 16, 1918, the last full day of her life, Maria walked in <b>the</b> <b>garden</b> <b>with</b> her father and sisters and the guards observed nothing unusual in the family's spirits. As the family was eating dinner that night, Yakov Yurovsky, the head of the detachment, came in and announced that the family's kitchen boy and Alexei's playmate, 14-year-old Leonid Sednev, must gather his things and go to a family member. The boy had actually been sent to a hotel across the street because the guards did not want to kill him {{along with the rest of}} the Romanov party. The family, unaware of the plan to kill them, was upset and unsettled by Sednev's absence, which came after five other members of their detachment had already been sent away. Dr. Botkin and Tatiana went that evening to Yurovsky's office, for what was to be the last time, to ask for the return of the kitchen boy who kept Alexei amused during the long hours of captivity. Yurovsky placated them by telling her the boy would return soon, but the family was unconvinced.|$|E
