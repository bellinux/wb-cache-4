5|$|The GCD can be visualized as follows. Consider a {{rectangular}} area a by b, and any common divisor c that divides both a and b exactly. The sides of <b>the</b> <b>rectangle</b> {{can be divided}} into segments of length c, which divides <b>the</b> <b>rectangle</b> into a grid of squares of side length c. The greatest common divisor g is the largest value of c for which this is possible. For illustration, a 24-by-60 rectangular area {{can be divided into}} a grid of: 1-by-1 squares, 2-by-2 squares, 3-by-3 squares, 4-by-4 squares, 6-by-6 squares or 12-by-12 squares. Therefore, 12 is the greatest common divisor of 24 and 60. A 24-by-60 rectangular area can be divided into a grid of 12-by-12 squares, with two squares along one edge (24/12=2) and five squares along the other (60/12=5).|$|E

5|$|The Euclidean {{algorithm}} can be visualized {{in terms}} of the tiling analogy given above for the greatest common divisor. Assume that we wish to cover an a-by-b rectangle with square tiles exactly, where a is the larger of the two numbers. We first attempt to tile <b>the</b> <b>rectangle</b> using b-by-b square tiles; however, this leaves an r0-by-b residual rectangle untiled, where r0 < b. We then attempt to tile the residual rectangle with r0-by-r0 square tiles. This leaves a second residual rectangle r1-by-r0, which we attempt to tile using r1-by-r1 square tiles, and so on. The sequence ends when there is no residual rectangle, i.e., when the square tiles cover the previous residual rectangle exactly. The length of the sides of the smallest square tile is the GCD of the dimensions of the original rectangle. For example, the smallest square tile in the adjacent figure is 21-by-21 (shown in red), and 21 is the GCD of 1071 and 462, the dimensions of the original rectangle (shown in green).|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe strip packing problem {{seeks to}} tightly pack {{a set of}} n {{rectangles}} into a strip of fixed width and arbitrary height. <b>The</b> <b>rectangles</b> model tasks and the height models time. This paper examines two variants of strip packing: when <b>the</b> <b>rectangles</b> to be placed have precedence constraints and when <b>the</b> <b>rectangles</b> have release times. Strip packing is used to model scheduling problems in which tasks require a contiguous subset of identical resources that are arranged in a linear topology. The variants studied here are motivated by scheduling tasks for dynamically reconfigurable Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) comprised of a linear arrangement of K homogeneous computing resources, where K is a fixed positive integer, and each task occupies a contiguous subset of these resources. For the case in which tasks have precedence constraints, we give an O(logn) approximation algorithm. We then consider the special case in which all <b>the</b> <b>rectangles</b> have uniform height, and reduce it to the resource constrained scheduling studied by Garey, Graham, Johnson and Yao, thereby extending their asymptotic results to our special case problem. We also give an absolute 3 -approximation for this special case problem. For strip packing with release times, we provide an asymptotic polynomial time approximation scheme. We make the standard assumption that <b>the</b> <b>rectangles</b> have height at most 1. In addition, we also require widths to be in [1 K, 1]. For the FPGA application, this would imply that <b>the</b> <b>rectangles</b> {{are at least as}} wide as a column. Our running time is polynomial in n and 1 /ϵ, but exponential in K...|$|R
40|$|In the {{two-dimensional}} strip packing problem {{a number}} of rectangles have to be packed without rotation or overlap into a strip such that {{the height of the}} strip used is minimal. The width of <b>the</b> <b>rectangles</b> is bounded by 1 and the strip has width 1 and infinite height. We study the online version of this packing problem. In the online version <b>the</b> <b>rectangles</b> are given to the online algorithm one by one from a list, and <b>the</b> next <b>rectangle</b> is given as soon as <b>the</b> current <b>rectangle</b> is irrevocably placed into the strip. To evaluate the performance of an online algorithm we employ competitive analysis. For a list of <b>rectangles</b> L, <b>the</b> height of a strip used by online algorithm ALG and by the optimal solution is denoted by ALG(L) and OPT(L), respectively.

50|$|The second {{experiment}} {{tested the}} watercolor effect versus good continuation. In good continuation, the smooth continuation areas {{tend to be}} grouped together. With different variations of a square-wave pattern and basic contours with fringes, the good continuation of the stimuli was studied. It was determined that the uniform watercolor illusion is seen in only closed space. The third experiment studied the watercolor illusion stimulus against the idea of closure and surroundness. According to the closure principle, piece creating a closed figure are grouped together. When one region encompasses another region completely, the surrounding region is perceived as ground, and the feature that is perceived as figure according to the surroundness principle. When <b>the</b> four purple <b>rectangles</b> were surrounded by a larger <b>rectangle,</b> <b>the</b> large <b>rectangle</b> was rarely perceived as figure while <b>the</b> four <b>rectangles</b> were seen as figures.
