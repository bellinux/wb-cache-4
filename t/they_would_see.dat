5|$|On {{the same}} day the Red Sox won Game 3, The Boston Globes Dan Shaughnessy wrote that, as this win brought the Red Sox on the verge of winning a World Series, he {{wondered}} how many people in New England were thinking about loved ones who had spent their entire lives rooting for the Red Sox and hoping that one day, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>see</b> the Red Sox win a World Series.|$|E
5|$|The 1st Rhodesia Regiment {{was soon}} posted back to Cape Town, {{where many of}} the troopers voiced their dissatisfaction at the lack of {{fighting}} in South-West Africa, and requested discharge so they could join the war in Europe. Superiors assured the men that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>see</b> action in East Africa if they stayed, but failed to convince most of them; the 1st Rhodesia Regiment promptly disbanded {{due to a lack of}} personnel. The majority of the South-West Africa veterans boarded ship for England to enlist in the British Army, while others mustered into South African units already billed for European service.|$|E
5|$|Their {{collaboration}} proved successful when, on the 3tht {{day at sea}} on the 1976 voyage, Mau stated soon <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>see</b> land, and {{the next}} day, Tahiti. A few hours later, they spotted land-based white terns (Gygis alba) followed by a diminution of the trade-wind swell. That night, they spotted Mataiva. After a brief stopover, {{with little more than}} another day's sailing they made landfall at Tahiti where they were welcomed by 17,000 people, half the population of Tahiti.|$|E
60|$|After {{a quarter}} of a mile, she turned sharply to the west. Smoke noticed that they were going through {{unpacked}} snow, but neither he nor Shorty observed that the dim trail they had been on still led south. Had they witnessed the subsequent procedure of Louis Gastell, the history of the Klondike would have been written differently; for <b>they</b> <b>would</b> have <b>seen</b> that old-timer, no longer limping, running with his nose to the trail like a hound, following them. Also, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> have <b>seen</b> him trample and widen the turn to the fresh trail they had made to the west. And, finally, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> have <b>seen</b> him keep on the old dim trail that still led south.|$|R

5|$|Having {{made the}} journey to Egypt {{travelling}} via South Africa and the Red Sea due {{to the threat of}} attack that was present in the Mediterranean, the battalion arrived just before New Years. The 18th Brigade was again reassigned in February 1941, this time to the 7th Division, with whom <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>see</b> out the remainder of the war; at the same time, the brigade was converted from a four-battalion structure to three, and the 2/11th was transferred to help form the 19th Brigade. On 21 March 1941, the battalion undertook its first ground action of the war, when one of its companies– 'D' Company– supported the 2/9th Battalion in their attack on the Italian held fort at Giarabub. The battalion's first major action as a complete unit did not come until April 1941, though, when it undertook defensive actions during the Siege of Tobruk. During the Battle of the Salient, fought in early May, the 2/10th took over a position on the northern flank of the perimeter, relieving the 2/48th Battalion, coming under heavy air attack during the handover.|$|E
5|$|As {{the season}} progresses, Elsa befriends series protagonist Emma Swan, Emma and the series' central cast resolving the help Elsa find Anna. The group {{eventually}} discovers that a figure named the Snow Queen (a more faithful {{adaptation of the}} original fairy tale's character) is somehow responsible for Elsa's trapping in her urn, a woman with similar powers to Elsa. They soon discover that the Snow Queen is Elsa's aunt, Ingrid, who was forgotten from Arendelle when Elsa's mother, Gerda, used {{the power of the}} troll king to erase everyones memory of her, not wishing for the world to remember how Ingrid accidentally killed their third sister, Helga. Ingrid soon discovered a prophecy that stated she would one day have the love of her sisters again. With Ingrid's sisters dead however, she believed she would be forced to create new sisters. For this, she chose Emma and Elsa. Ingrid had stalked Emma her entire life in preparation for the prophecy to become true, and manipulated events in Arendelle to bring Elsa to her. Being convinced that she could only gain their love when {{she was the only one}} left, she obtained a mirror capable of bringing out the worst in people (the mirror coming directly from The Snow Queen fairy tale). If a piece of the mirror were to get in someones eye, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>see</b> nothing but hatred in the world. Ingrid had planned to use this on everyone in Storybrooke (dubbed the Spell of Shattered Sight), forcing all of its citizens to kill each other while she, Emma, and Elsa remained immune. Ingrid had also used this to her advantage on Anna, forcing Anna to trap Elsa in the urn they originally found Elsa in.|$|E
25|$|The {{irony is}} that Nately {{actually}} sees his friends as Yossarian, Orr, Hungry Joe and Dunbar whom his parents would not be impressed with, but equally his parents would not like Aarfy whom <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>see</b> as a “climber”.|$|E

25|$|On 8 July 2009, Maria Hertogh died at {{her house}} in Huijbergen from leukaemia {{at the age of}} 72. In a twist of fate, she died from the same cancer that killed her adoptive elder sister, Kamariah Mohd Dahan, of Japanese descent, whom she visited in 1998 in Kemaman. The highly {{emotional}} visit was the first time they had met after being separated for 48 years. But it would be the only time <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>see</b> each other before Kamariah died.|$|E
25|$|While, as {{with any}} sort of folklore, the details may vary, this {{particular}} tale (Bloody Mary) encouraged young women to walk {{up a flight of}} stairs backwards, holding a candle and a hand mirror, in a darkened house. As they gazed into the mirror, {{they were supposed to be}} able to catch a view of their future husband's face. There was, however, a chance that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>see</b> the skull-face of the Grim Reaper instead; this meant that they were destined to die before they married.|$|E
25|$|Before the , the FIA were tipped-off by rivals Ferrari {{about an}} {{illegality}} in the Michelin tyre's tread width. Michelin {{were forced to}} bring in narrower tyres and {{it seemed as if}} they had lost the advantage they had been enjoying over Bridgestone all season. McLaren also announced that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>see</b> out the season with the old MP4-17D chassis and would not bring out the MP4-18 as had been planned. Räikkönen eventually finished 4th in the race, losing five championship points to race winner Michael Schumacher.|$|E

25|$|The {{tour was}} officially {{announced}} on On Air with Ryan Seacrest during an interview, {{where it was}} mentioned the groups recording a single to be later released. To promote the tour further, the groups conducted a live Q session on Ustream. The groups also performed at the 38th Annual American Music Awards to give the public {{a taste of what}} <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>see</b> on the tour. For an interview on Entertainment Tonight, Donnie Wahlberg held a picture of the proposed staging, which featured a standard concert stage with an extended catwalk leading to a circular platform.|$|E
25|$|The main deity in the Mexica {{religion}} was the sun god and war god, Huitzilopochtli. He directed the Mexicas {{to found a}} city on the site where <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>see</b> an eagle, devouring (not all chronicles agree on what the eagle was devouring, one {{says it was a}} precious bird, and though Father Duran says it was a snake, this is not mentioned in any pre-Hispanic source) perched on a fruit bearing nopal cactus. According to legend, Huitzilopochtli had to kill his nephew, Cópil, and throw his heart on the lake. But, since Cópil was his relative, Huitzilopochtli decided to honor him, and caused cactus to grow over Cópil's heart which became a sacred place.|$|E
25|$|The next Sampras-Rafter {{match was}} the 2000 Wimbledon final, after Rafter overcame Agassi in the semifinals, a four-set final which {{included}} a 26-minute rain delay. Both players had flown in their parents for the Wimbledon final, {{the first time in}} years <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>see</b> their sons play. Sampras lost the first set tiebreaker, and trailed in the second-set tiebreaker 1-4 before taking 5 consecutive points to win that set, then won the third and fourth sets for the Championship, with just 10 minutes of daylight left. That victory gave Sampras his 13th Grand Slam title, breaking the record of 12 by Roy Emerson for the most Grand Slam titles. After the match ended, Sampras called Rafter “all class, on and off the court”, while Rafter said he was lucky to overcome early season injuries to make the final.|$|E

25|$|The lack of R18+ and X18+ {{ratings for}} games {{has been the}} subject of {{complaint}} in the gaming community, particularly on the basis that there is no reason why adults should not be able to see content in games that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>see</b> in a film. One of the main opponents to the introduction of a R18+ rating for video games was the former South Australian Attorney-General Michael Atkinson who has vetoed every attempt to induce one. Following his resignation after the 2010 South Australian elections there appears to be no likelihood of a future veto in the face of public opinion supporting the new classification. In August 2008, Australian video game show Good Game announced that a meeting of the Attorneys-General in March of that year resulted in a decision that the Australian public would be consulted before a final decision on the status of a R18+ rating for video games would be made.|$|E
25|$|Five {{years would}} pass before the grenadiers' next engagement, which {{occurred}} during the War of the Third Coalition. As war broke out with Russia and Austria, the horse grenadiers, now {{a part of the}} Imperial Guard, crossed the Rhine into Germany on October 1, 1805. Ten days after that, they were at Augsburg and on October 20 they were present at the surrender of Ulm. <b>They</b> <b>would</b> <b>see</b> their only major action during this campaign on December 2, on the Pratzen plateau, at the battle of Austerlitz. During this battle, Napoleon had planned to break the Austro-Russian centre and thus split their forces. The plan was well under way towards mid morning but a potentially dangerous situation for the French occurred when the Russian Imperial Guard under Grand Duke Constantine arrived and attacked the French from Vandamme's division around Stary Vinohrady ('the old vineyards'). At first, one battalion of the French 4th Line regiment was caught in an awkward position and broken by the Russian Guard cavalry supported by artillery, with the French battalion losing its eagle and over 400 men. Then, the 24th Light regiment, which was coming up in support of the 4th, was also thrown back in disarray. It was at this moment that Napoleon sent in his Guard cavalry: 4 squadrons, 423 men, of the Chasseurs à Cheval and Mameluke regiment and 4 squadrons, 706 men, of the Grenadiers à Cheval regiment, with a battery of Guard horse artillery in support. The grenadiers charged vigorously and clashed with the Russian Chevalier Guard regiment. After a short mêlée, the horse grenadiers broke the opponent, inflicting heavy casualties and capturing over 200 men, their commander - Prince Repnin - with his general staff, as well as 27 pieces of artillery, with the loss of just 2 killed and 22 wounded (among which 6 officers wounded).|$|E

He added that once Stewart had a few weeks spare in his schedule, that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>see</b> if he could be brought in to direct an episode.|$|E

500|$|Between levels, the toads receive {{briefing}} {{comments from}} Professor T. Bird, along with teasing from the Dark Queen. During the game's 13 levels, the Battletoads {{are faced with}} Dark Queen's minions Big Blag, Robo Manus and Major Slaughter as bosses, ultimately facing the Dark Queen herself {{at the top of}} the Dark Tower, the game's final level. Once the Queen is defeated, she claims it will not be the last <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>see</b> from her, later turning into a whirlwind and flying into space, [...] "retreating into the shadowy margins of the galaxy to recoup her losses". With Pimple and Princess Angelica rescued, the four are brought back into the Vulture and the game ends.|$|E
500|$|Rabbits {{have long}} been {{associated}} with bad luck on Portland; use of the name is still taboo—the creatures are {{often referred to as}} [...] "underground mutton", [...] "long-eared furry things" [...] or just [...] "bunnies". The origin of this superstition is obscure (there is no record of it before the 1920s) but it is believed to derive from quarry workers: <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>see</b> rabbits emerging from their burrows immediately before a rock fall and blame them for increasing the risk of dangerous, sometimes deadly, landslides. If a rabbit was seen in a quarry, the workers would pack up and go home for the day, until the safety of the area had been assured. Local fishermen too would refuse to go to sea if the word was mentioned.|$|E
500|$|Several titles were {{considered}} during production, including [...] "Shot Down in Flames" [...] and [...] "IV". The former was rejected because Martin thought {{it sounded like}} a title The Beta Band would use. Taylor supported the name [...] "IV" [...] because he liked [...] "giving people the wrong impression all the time", and defended his opinion, saying [...] "if [...] give us any time, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>see</b> that we're very serious about comedy ... and serious things as well". The album was called [...] "Made in the Dark" [...] because it was a title the band agreed on. Taylor considered the eponymous track to be one of his favourite songs, and thought it was nice to name the album after a thoughtful song, in contrast to Coming on Strong and The Warning, which he described as being [...] "big, slightly jokey, macho phrases".|$|E
