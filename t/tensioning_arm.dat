In these systems, no rewinding was necessary nor were any fancy supply reel, takeup reel, or <b>tension</b> <b>arm</b> mechanisms required; the tape merely fed from the supply tank through the reader to the takeup tank, refolding itself back into exactly the same form as when it was fed into the reader.* Low information density.

40|$|Theoretically, the “mobilization hypothesis” {{establishes}} {{a link between}} religion and conflict by arguing that religious structures such as overlapping ethnic and religious identities are prone to mobilization; once politicized, escalation to violent conflict becomes likelier. Yet, despite the religious diversity in sub-Saharan Africa and the religious overtones {{in a number of}} African armed conflicts, this assumption has not yet been backed by systematic empirical research on the religion–conflict nexus in the region. The following questions thus remain: Do religious factors significantly impact the onset of (religious) armed conflict? If so, do they follow the logic of the mobilization hypothesis and, if yes, in which way? To answer these questions, this paper draws on a unique data inventory of all sub-Saharan countries for the period 1990 – 2008, particularly including data on mobilization-prone religious structures (e. g. demographic changes, parallel ethno-religious identities) as well as religious factors indicating actual politicization of religion (e. g. inter-religious tensions, religious discrimination, incitement by religious leaders). Based on logit regressions, results suggest that religion indeed plays a significant role in African armed conflicts. The findings are compatible with the mobilization hypothesis: Overlaps of religious and ethnic identities and religious dominance are conflict-prone; religious polarization is conflict-prone only if combined with religious discrimination and religious <b>tensions.</b> <b>Armed</b> conflict, religion, sub-Saharan Africa, mobilization...|$|R

40|$|To {{investigate}} the rotation vibration {{dynamics of the}} pulleys and the <b>tension</b> <b>arms,</b> and to estimate the vibrations of the belts and the slip ratio between the belt and the pulleys in the engine front-end accessory drive systems, a systematic modelling and analytical method is proposed for engine front-end accessory drive systems; this {{can be used for}} modelling engine front-end accessory drive systems with different layouts and different numbers of tensioners, including automatic and fixed tensioners. In the modelling, the rotational pulleys are classified as fixed-axis pulleys and moveable-axis pulleys (such as the pulley in the tensioner). Moreover, the belt spans are classified as the belt spans between the two fixed pulleys, and the belt spans adjacent to the pulley of a tensioner. The equations of motion for each type of pulley and the tension calculation equations for each type of belt span are developed. In this way, the equations of motion for all the pulleys and the tensioner arms can be obtained easily, irrespective of the layout of the tensioners. To obtain the dynamic rotational vibration responses of an engine front-end accessory drive system by the conventional Runge-Kutta method, high-efficiency algorithms or methods are also proposed for calculating the tangent-point coordinates between a belt and the adjacent pulleys and the belt length of the contact arc on one pulley. The proposed modelling and analysis methods are validated by modelling different layouts of the engine front-end accessory drive systems with different types and numbers of tensioners, and also by comparisons between the calculated dynamic vibration responses of the pulleys and the belts and the real experimental data.
