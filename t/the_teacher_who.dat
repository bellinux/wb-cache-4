500|$|Thus, {{from the}} age of eight, Mao was sent to gain a basic {{education}} at the private Shaoshan Primary School. Adopting a traditional syllabus and method of education, the school emphasised the copying and recitation by rote of a series of classical Chinese texts preaching Confucian morals: the Three Character Classic, the Book of Names, the Thousand Character Classic, the Odes for Children, the Filial Classic, and Filial Learning. Perceived failure or disobedience resulted in beatings with a bamboo rod from <b>the</b> <b>teacher,</b> <b>who</b> like Mao's father was a stern disciplinarian. Disliking this mode of education, Mao later asserted that [...] "I hated Confucius {{from the age}} of eight."

They typically contain about fifty boys. Although classes are organised on a School basis, most boys spend a large proportion of their time in their House.

2500|$|Born in Kullavik, Sweden, Torsten Billman disliked school, {{with the}} drawing lessons {{as the only}} exception. During a drawing lesson with a {{substitute}} teacher Torsten had {{on a piece of}} blotting paper drawn a detailed composition, which was supposed to represent an Indian with his tent and utensils. [...] "After the teacher had inspected the pictures produced by the class, Torsten was called to his desk. He expected a sympathetic judgment from the teacher; yes, he also hoped that he might impress a certain girl in the class. So he stepped forward fearlessly. He had hardly reached the plattform when he received such a box on the ear that he fell to the floor. As he crestfallen rose to return to his own desk he was further rebuked by <b>the</b> <b>teacher,</b> <b>who</b> ordered him immediately to fling the drawing in the red-hot stove." [...] "It was my first vernissage", said Torsten Billman.|$|E
2500|$|While at Pforta, Nietzsche had {{a penchant}} for {{pursuing}} subjects that were considered unbecoming. He became acquainted {{with the work of}} the then almost-unknown poet Friedrich Hölderlin, calling him [...] "my favorite poet" [...] and composing an essay in which he said that the mad poet raised consciousness to [...] "the most sublime ideality." [...] <b>The</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>who</b> corrected the essay gave it a good mark but commented that Nietzsche should concern himself in the future with healthier, more lucid, and more [...] "German" [...] writers. Additionally, he became acquainted with Ernst Ortlepp, an eccentric, blasphemous, and often drunken poet who was found dead in a ditch weeks after meeting the young Nietzsche but who may have introduced Nietzsche to the music and writing of Richard Wagner. Perhaps under Ortlepp's influence, he and a student named Richter returned to school drunk and encountered a teacher, resulting in Nietzsche's demotion from first in his class and the end of his status as a prefect.|$|E
2500|$|Kierkegaard also {{stresses}} the importance of the self, and the self's relation to the world, as being grounded in self-reflection and introspection. He argued in Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments that [...] "subjectivity is truth" [...] and [...] "truth is subjectivity." [...] This {{has to do with a}} distinction between what is objectively true and an individual's subjective relation (such as indifference or commitment) to that truth. People who in some sense believe the same things may relate to those beliefs quite differently. Two individuals may both believe that many of those around them are poor and deserve help, but this knowledge may lead only one of them to decide to actually help the poor. This is how Kierkegaard put it: [...] "What a priceless invention statistics are, what a glorious fruit of culture, what a characteristic counterpart to the de te narratur fabula [...] of antiquity. Schleiermacher so enthusiastically declares that knowledge does not perturb religiousness, and that the religious person does not sit safeguarded by a lightning rod and scoff at God; yet with the help of statistical tables one laughs at all of life." [...] In other words, Kierkegaard says: [...] "Who has the more difficult task: <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>who</b> lectures on earnest things a meteor's distance from everyday life – or the learner who should put it to use?" [...] This is how it was summed up in 1940.|$|E
