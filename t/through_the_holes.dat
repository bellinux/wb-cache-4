25|$|A rivet is {{essentially}} a two-headed and unthreaded bolt which holds two other pieces of metal together. Holes are drilled or punched through the two pieces of metal to be joined. The holes being aligned, a rivet is passed <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> and permanent heads are formed onto {{the ends of the}} rivet utilizing hammers and forming dies (by either coldworking or hotworking).|$|E
25|$|The stencil {{duplicator}} or mimeograph machine is a low-cost printing press that works by forcing ink through a stencil onto paper. Once prepared, the stencil is {{wrapped around the}} ink-filled drum of the rotary machine. When a blank sheet of paper is drawn between the rotating drum and a pressure roller, ink is forced <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> on the stencil onto the paper. Thomas Alva Edison invented the mimeograph in 1875.|$|E

25|$|Cusped {{confinement}} was explored theoretically and experimentally. However, most cusped experiments {{failed and}} disappeared from national programs by 1980. Bussard later called {{this type of}} confinement the Wiffle-Ball. This analogy was used to describe electron trapping inside the field. Marbles can be trapped inside a Wiffle ball, a hollow, perforated sphere; if marbles are put inside, they can roll and sometimes escape <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> in the sphere. The magnetic topology of a high-beta polywell acts similarly with electrons.|$|E
25|$|The gimbal {{was first}} {{described}} by the Greek inventor Philo of Byzantium (280–220 BCE). Philo described an eight-sided ink pot with an opening on each side, which can be turned so that while any face is on top, a pen can be dipped and inked — yet the ink never runs out <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> of the other sides. This {{was done by the}} suspension of the inkwell at the center, which was mounted on a series of concentric metal rings so that it remained stationary no matter which way the pot is turned.|$|E
25|$|VeloBind {{is used to}} {{permanently}} rivet pages together using {{a plastic}} strip {{on the front and}} back of the document. Sheets for the document are punched with a line of holes near the bound edge. A series of pins attached to a plastic strip called a Comb feeds <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> to the other side and then goes through another plastic strip called the receiving strip. The excess portion of the pins is cut off and the plastic heat-sealed to create a relatively flat bind method. VeloBind provides a more permanent bind than comb-binding, but is primarily used for business and legal presentations and small publications.|$|E

25|$|The geocentric model entered Greek {{astronomy}} and philosophy {{at an early}} point; {{it can be found}} in pre-Socratic philosophy. In the 6th century BC, Anaximander proposed a cosmology with Earth shaped like a section of a pillar (a cylinder), held aloft at the center of everything. The Sun, Moon, and planets were holes in invisible wheels surrounding Earth; <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>holes,</b> humans could see concealed fire. About the same time, Pythagoras thought that the Earth was a sphere (in accordance with observations of eclipses), but not at the center; they believed that it was in motion around an unseen fire. Later these views were combined, so most educated Greeks from the 4th century BC on thought that the Earth was a sphere {{at the center of the}} universe.|$|E
25|$|Spiral binding is {{the most}} {{economical}} form of mechanical binding when using plastic or metal. It is commonly used for atlases and other publications where it is necessary or desirable {{to be able to}} open the publication back on itself without breaking the spine. There are several types but basically it is made by punching holes along {{the entire length of the}} spine of the page and winding a wire helix (like a spring) <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> to provide a fully flexible hinge at the spine. Spiral coil binding uses a number of different hole patterns for binding documents. The most common hole pattern used with this style is 4:1 pitch (4 holes per inch). However, spiral coil spines are also available for use with 3:1 pitch, 5:1 pitch and 0.400-hole patterns.|$|E
25|$|In July 1938 {{the shadow}} mask color {{television}} was patented by Werner Flechsig (1900–1981) in Germany, and was demonstrated at the International radio exhibition Berlin in 1939. Most CRT color televisions used today {{are based on}} this technology. His {{solution to the problem}} of focusing the electron guns on the tiny colored dots was one of brute-force; a metal sheet with holes punched in it allowed the beams to reach the screen only when they were properly aligned over the dots. Three separate guns were aimed at the holes from slightly different angles, and when their beams passed <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> the angles caused them to separate again and hit the individual spots a short distance away on the back of the screen. The downside to this approach was that the mask cut off the vast majority of the beam energy, allowing it to hit the screen only 15% of the time, requiring a massive increase in beam power to produce acceptable image brightness.|$|E

25|$|Originally, every {{electronic}} component had wire leads, and the PCB had holes drilled for each wire of each component. The components' leads were then passed <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> and soldered to the PCB trace. This method of assembly is called through-hole construction. In 1949, Moe Abramson and Stanislaus F. Danko of the United States Army Signal Corps developed the Auto-Sembly {{process in which}} component leads were inserted into a copper foil interconnection pattern and dip soldered. The patent they obtained in 1956 {{was assigned to the}} U.S. Army. With the development of board lamination and etching techniques, this concept evolved into the standard printed circuit board fabrication process in use today. Soldering could be done automatically by passing the board over a ripple, or wave, of molten solder in a wave-soldering machine. However, the wires and holes are wasteful since drilling holes is expensive and the protruding wires are merely cut off.|$|E
25|$|In Europe, William Addis of England is {{believed}} to have produced the first mass produced toothbrush in 1780. In 1770, he had been jailed for causing a riot. While in prison he decided that using a rag with soot and salt on the teeth was ineffective and could be improved. After saving a small bone from a meal, he drilled small holes into the bone and tied into the bone tufts of bristles that he had obtained from one of the guards, passed the tufts of bristle <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> in the bone and sealed the holes with glue. After his release, he became wealthy after starting a business manufacturing toothbrushes. He died in 1808, bequeathing the business to his eldest son. It remained within family ownership until 1996. Under the name Wisdom Toothbrushes, the company now manufactures 70 million toothbrushes per year in the UK. By 1840 toothbrushes were being mass produced in England, France, Germany, and Japan. Pig bristles were used for cheaper toothbrushes and badger hair for the more expensive ones.|$|E
25|$|Occlusal splints (also termed dental guards) are {{commonly}} prescribed, mainly by dentists and dental specialists, {{as a treatment}} for bruxism. Proponents of their use claim many benefits, however when the evidence is critically examined in systematic reviews of the topic, it is reported that there is insufficient evidence to show that occlusal splints are effective for sleep bruxism. Furthermore, occlusal splints are probably ineffective for awake bruxism, since they tend to be worn only during sleep. However, occlusal splints may be of some benefit in reducing the tooth wear that may accompany bruxism, but by mechanically protecting the teeth rather than reducing the bruxing activity itself. In a minority of cases, sleep bruxism may be made worse by an occlusal splint. Some patients will periodically return with splints with holes worn through them, either because the bruxism is aggravated, or unaffected by the presence of the splint. When tooth-to-tooth contact is possible <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> in a splint, it is offering no protection against tooth wear and needs to be replaced.|$|E

25|$|Boullée {{promoted}} {{the idea of}} making architecture expressive of its purpose, a doctrine that his detractors termed architecture parlante ("talking architecture"), which was an essential element in Beaux-Arts architectural training in the later 19th century. His style was most notably exemplified in his proposal for a cenotaph for the English scientist Isaac Newton, who 50 years after his death became a symbol of Enlightenment ideas. The building itself was a 150m (500ft) tall sphere, taller than the Great Pyramids of Giza, encompassed by two large barriers circled by hundreds of cypress trees. Though the structure was never built, Boullée had many ink and wash drawings engraved and circulated widely in the professional circles in 1784. Boullée's Cenotaph for Isaac Newton is a funerary monument celebrating a figure interred elsewhere. The small sarcophagus for Newton is placed at the lower pole of the sphere. The design of the memorial creates the effect of day and night. The night effect occurs when the sarcophagus is illuminated by the sunlight coming <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> in the vaulting. This gives the illusion of stars in the night sky. The day effect is an armillary sphere hanging in the center that gives off a mysterious glow. Thus, the use of light in the building's design causes the building's interior to change its appearance.|$|E
25|$|Under the superintendence of the engineers, workmen {{were told}} off {{to cut through}} the {{carriage}} and foot roads, that being the only way of preventing the flames from spreading along the bridge. The men worked with good will and soon succeeded in cutting several holes through the asphalte and timber. How to play with the water on the underside was a difficulty soon got over. Four or five men, with a courage most commendable, volunteered to be lowered down, <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> in the pathway, by means of ropes, enabling them to direct the water directly on to the burning woodwork. For a long time their efforts seemed to be without effect; no sooner was the fire put out {{in one part of the}} bridge than another beam burst into flames. For several hours streams of water were thrown against the bridge, ultimately with success. In order to put the spreading of the fire beyond doubt, the workmen on the bridge cut through the entire width of the carriage and footway, making a gap at both the Newcastle and Gateshead side... In no way, however, is the safety of the bridge endangered. The railway traffic was suspended from about half past eight o'clock in the morning, until two in the afternoon, not from any apprehensions that the upper level was insecure, but on account of the smoke and flames, and also because of the hose which was lying across the rails.|$|E
25|$|Rotary exhaust {{temperatures}} reach , and as such, on a motorcycle, {{required a}} specialized exhaust system. Suzuki {{dealt with the}} problem by first exhausting into a large, heavily finned manifold which split the single exhaust into two streams. They then built two twin-shelled exhaust pipes which included air cooling ducts. Each muffler contains a stainless steel inner pipe {{which is a little}} shorter than the length of the external shell. The internal pipe ends in a removable stinger drilled with numerous holes and wrapped in a fibreglass-like material. The stinger (or spark arrestor as Suzuki calls it) exits the exhaust system {{at the end of the}} external shell. At the front of each pipe was a small forward-facing grille which allowed cool ambient air to be forced into the pipe by the bike's forward motion and to travel the length of the exhaust between the internal and external pipes. It then flowed <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> drilled in the stinger, mixing with the hot exhaust gasses before exiting the system. Even so, Suzuki found it prudent to fit heat shields on the outside of the pipe to further protect riders and pillions. The bike's sound is unique among its two- and four-stroke contemporaries but also quite loud. Early in production (December 1974, Frame #11901), Suzuki reduced the size of the spark arrestor tubes, which both reduced noise and horsepower, but the RE5 exhaust note remains distinctive.|$|E

Twenty-three aeroplanes and helicopters at Sydney Airport were reported as having incurred notable damage from the hail, caused by the inability to place them under hangars in time to avoid the storm.

500|$|... "The Grinning Man" [...] {{received}} a mixed response from critics, and was watched by 9.91 million viewers, with a 36% {{share of the}} total television audience. The episode beat ITV's Marple in the same time-slot, with Geraldine McEwan's last episode as Agatha Christie's famous sleuth receiving just 4.48 million viewers and a 15% audience share. The Sunday Times AA Gill was critical of the episode, suggesting that the series had been revived: [...] "because of some dire piece of market research where they asked single, lonely, overweight, over-40 women who keep cats and believe in ghosts who they fancied most on television, and Alan Davies must have beaten Huw Edwards by a woolly head." [...] Of the episode itself, he wrote: [...] "It skids between procedural whodunit realism and cartoonish fantasy {{in a way that}} defies belief and interest. It is a dull confusion of unknotted loose ends that breaks its own rules, suspends common sense and dumps so much unexplained plot that all suspense drains away <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> in the story." [...] The Herald's Alasdair McKay was critical of Davies' acting in the episode, writing that: [...] "it really is difficult {{to tell the difference between}} the comedian and the accidental detective in David Renwick's comedy drama. Davies doesn't act, he tries to stay awake, occasionally pausing for a cryptic insight." [...] While The Scotsmans Paul Whitelaw similarly noted that Davies appeared to be playing [...] "a slightly grumpier version" [...] of himself, he was [...] "quite impressed" [...] by Davies performance, having never seen him act before. Whitelaw found that [...] "the episode itself left a lot to be desired", writing that its central mystery was [...] "solid" [...] and its solution was [...] "satisfyingly creepy", but that [...] "At two hours in length it was fatally overstretched [...] It was as though Renwick, who also directed, had been given 120 minutes to fill without having enough material to fill them – the narrative equivalent of an interminable jam session based around some fundamentally decent riffs." [...] Steve Pratt, writing for The Northern Echo, was similarly critical of the episode's length, deeming the Adam Klaus subplot [...] "nonsense" [...] which [...] "could easily be removed without loss". Pratt suggested that [...] "This would also help reduce the overlong two-hour running time, during which my attention wandered more often than it should have done." [...] The Observers Euan Ferguson shared a similar sentiment, writing that the episode: ...|$|E
