5|$|Although the Ministry of Education {{reported}} that eleven schools had sustained a combined total of $300,000 of damage, the Ministry of Communications, Works, Transport, and Public Utilities {{reported that}} most of the country's other major infrastructure remained functional.

5|$|The Chevron Corporation {{discovered}} the Adar Yale field in 1981, {{shortly before the}} start of the Second Sudanese Civil War (1983–2005).

5|$|A {{division}} of the U.S. Department of Transportation, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) regulates nearly {{all aspects of the}} trucking industry. Truck drivers are limited by the number of daily and weekly hours they may drive, <b>the</b> <b>roads</b> <b>and</b> highways they may drive upon, and a lower legal definition of drunkenness. The Federal Highway Administration has established 0.04 percent as the blood alcohol concentration (BAC) level at or above which a CMV driver is deemed to be driving under the influence of alcohol. States maintain a BAC level between 0.08 and 0.10 percent for non-CMV drivers. In some states, trucks also have special speed limits, in addition to restrictions on driving in certain lanes (normally the far right lanes of multi-lane highways).|$|E
5|$|Although {{identified}} {{early as}} a vital strategic outpost, Port Moresby, the most significant Papuan town, had just two airfields and basic port facilities in early 1942. An enormous amount of work was required to transform it into a major base for both air and land operations against the Japanese. This {{was done in the}} face of frequent Japanese air raids. During the course of the Kokoda Track campaign, the two original airfields were improved, and five new airfields were developed. To make them operational, the engineers had to construct more than just runways; taxiways, hardstands, facilities and access roads all had to be built. The operation of the base depended on shipping, but the port facilities were limited. To increase the capacity of the port, a causeway was built to Tatana Island, where pontoon docks were emplaced. Engineers also built roads, warehouses, and a water treatment plant. They ran the town's electricity and water supply, and quarried stone for <b>the</b> <b>roads</b> <b>and</b> airstrips.|$|E
5|$|During the 19th century, the {{watershed}} {{became part of}} a rancho. In 1966, the creek was dammed to form Laguna Niguel Lake, while the surrounding hills were leveled as residential communities were constructed in the area following the '60s and '70s. The creek's basin eventually {{became part of the}} cities of Laguna Hills, Laguna Niguel, and a small portion in San Juan Capistrano. Increasing urban runoff in the 1960s caused most of the flow in the creek to be unnatural. The creek has since been channelized along most of its length to prevent floods from inundating <b>the</b> <b>roads</b> <b>and</b> houses that now line much of its banks.|$|E

5|$|During the inter-war {{years the}} {{navigation}} struggled {{to hold its}} own against competition from the railways and later <b>the</b> <b>roads,</b> <b>and</b> was affected by miners' strikes in the coal industry. Traffic was spasmodic, rising from 381,727 tonnes in 1926, {{the year of the}} general strike, to 815,329 tonnes in 1937, but much of the latter was short-haul traffic, rather than long-haul, and the revenues did not increase correspondingly. In an agreement with Hatfield Main Colliery and the Aire and Calder, Bramwith Lock on the Stainforth and Keadby Canal was lengthened in 1932, to allow compartment boats to be used for the coal traffic, while straightening of a stretch near Doncaster and {{the construction of a new}} warehouse and wharf were largely funded by Doncaster Corporation in 1934.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the township, {{there were a number}} of temporary camps established for construction workers. It was initially intended that the construction workers should live off-site, but the poor condition of <b>the</b> <b>roads</b> <b>and</b> a shortage of accommodations in the area made commuting long and difficult, and in turn made it difficult to find and retain workers. Construction workers therefore came to be housed in large hutment and trailer camps. The largest, the trailer camp at Gamble Valley, had four thousand units. Another, at Happy Valley, held 15,000 people. The population of the construction camps declined as the construction effort tapered off, but they continued to be occupied in 1946.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} half of the 19th century the {{population}} and physical extent of London grew greatly. The increasing resident population and the development of a commuting population arriving by train each day led to a high level of traffic congestion with huge numbers of carts, cabs, and omnibuses filling <b>the</b> <b>roads</b> <b>and</b> up to 200,000 people entering the City of London, the commercial heart, each day on foot. By 1850 there were seven railway termini around the urban centre of London: London Bridge and Waterloo to the south, Shoreditch and Fenchurch Street to the east, Euston and King's Cross to the north, and Paddington to the west. Only Fenchurch Street station was within the City.|$|E

Construction workers therefore came to be housed in large hutment and trailer camps. The J. A. Jones camp for K-25 workers, known as Happy Valley, held 15,000 people. This required 8 dormitories, 17 barracks, 1,590 hutments, 1,153 trailers and 100 Victory Houses. A pumping station was built to supply drinking water from the Clinch River, along with a water treatment plant. Amenities included a school, eight cafeterias, a bakery, theater, three recreation halls, a warehouse and a cold storage plant. Ford, Bacon & Davis established a smaller camp for 2,100 people. Responsibility for the camps was transferred to the Roane-Anderson Company on 25 January 1946, and the school was transferred to district control in March 1946.|$|E
5|$|Kh.

The 2nd Battalion, British West Indies Regiment remained to garrison Kh. Fusail, occupying a position at Talat Armah to protect Meldrum's right flank and rear, and if necessary to block the track from Mafid Jozele. Aerial reconnaissance flights during the evening of 21 September, confirmed that Shunet Nimrin {{in the rear of}} Meldrum's Force was still strongly garrisoned, and that <b>the</b> <b>roads</b> <b>and</b> tracks running west from Amman were carrying normal traffic.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the rest}} of Sikkim, not much {{is known about the}} early history of Gangtok. The {{earliest}} records date from the construction of the hermitic Gangtok monastery in 1716. Gangtok remained a small hamlet until the construction of the Enchey Monastery in 1840 made it a pilgrimage center. It became the capital of what was left of Sikkim after an English conquest in the mid-19th century in response to a hostage crisis. After the defeat of the Tibetans by the British, Gangtok became a major stopover in the trade between Tibet and British India {{at the end of the}} 19th century. Most of <b>the</b> <b>roads</b> <b>and</b> the telegraph in the area were built during this time.|$|E

He received the most votes - 6,693, compared to his Democratic opponent with 6,347. Maxwell was re-elected to his position in 1888, and served in the senate from 1889 until 1893. During his tenure in the senate, Maxwell was again elected as the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. He also served on <b>the</b> <b>Roads</b> <b>and</b> Navigation and Public Printing committees during this term.

5|$|Trafalgar Square {{is owned}} by the Queen in Right of the Crown and managed by the Greater London Authority, while Westminster City Council owns the roads around the square, {{including}} the pedestrianised area of the North Terrace. The square contains a large central area with roadways on three sides and a terrace to the north, in front of the National Gallery. The roads around the square form part of the A4, a major road running west of the City of London. The square was formerly surrounded by a one-way traffic system, but works completed in 2003 reduced the width of <b>the</b> <b>roads</b> <b>and</b> closed the northern side to traffic.|$|E
5|$|Waller mustered his men in Farnham Park near 10:30p.m., on 12 December. At around midnight, 5,000 of Waller's men marched {{west from}} Farnham toward Basing House. The Parliamentarians marched {{about two miles}} in this {{direction}} (in order to confuse Royalist scouts), until around 1:00a.m., before abruptly turning south toward Alton. The march was quick and quiet, owing to a long frost which had hardened <b>the</b> <b>roads</b> <b>and</b> Waller's judicious use of wooded areas. Also helpful in Waller's advance was his use of leather guns, here employed {{for the first time}} in the English Civil War. Unlike heavier artillery, a leather gun could be led by a single horse, transported efficiently over difficult terrain, and still be an effective tool for bombardment.|$|E
