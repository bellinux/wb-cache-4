50|$|The {{readings}} {{by themselves}} are typically not as useful as their tristimulus values, {{which can be}} converted into chromaticity co-ordinates and manipulated through color space transformations. For this purpose, a spectrocolorimeter may be used. A spectrocolorimeter is simply a spectrophotometer that can estimate tristimulus values by numerical integration (of the color matching functions' inner product with the illuminant's spectral power distribution). One benefit of spectrocolorimeters over <b>tristimulus</b> <b>colorimeters</b> {{is that they do}} not have optical filters, which are subject to manufacturing variance, and have a fixed spectral transmittance curve—until they age. On the other hand, <b>tristimulus</b> <b>colorimeters</b> are purpose-built, cheaper, and easier to use.|$|R

50|$|Internally {{the meter}} is {{typically}} a silicon photodiode <b>tristimulus</b> <b>colorimeter.</b> The {{correlated color temperature}} can be calculated from the tristimulus values by first calculating the chromaticity co-ordinates in the CIE 1960 color space, then finding the closest point on the Planckian locus.|$|E
50|$|Every {{device that}} captures or {{displays}} color can be profiled.

40|$|The Four-Color Method was {{developed}} to improve the accuracy of <b>tristimulus</b> <b>colorimeters</b> for measurements of color displays. It was verified that the method works well for cathode ray tubes (CRTs). The accuracy of this method has been studied further for spectral variations of displays including CRTs, liquid crystal displays (LCDs) and {{organic light emitting diode}} (OLED) displays. A theory for additional photometric (Y) correction is also given. A simulation was conducted using data of actual <b>tristimulus</b> <b>colorimeters</b> and displays having variations in their spectral power distributions. The results show that, if the correction matrix is made with one type of display and other types of display are measured, the error correction will not be effective. If the calibration and measurement is limited to one type of display, the residual errors are found to be within 0. 002 in chromaticity x, y and a color difference of 2 ∆E ab. An experiment was also conducted to verify the Four-Color Method for measurements of an LCD. The errors of a colorimeter for 14 colors were reduced to within 0. 002 in x, y and 1 ∆E ab. It has been experimentally verified that the method works well for LCDs as well...|$|R
40|$|A {{new method}} is {{described}} to calibrate <b>tristimulus</b> <b>colorimeters</b> for high accuracy color measurements. Instead of traditional lamp standards, modern, high accuracy detector standards are suggested for calibra-tion. After high accuracy absolute spec-tral response {{determination of the}} tristimu-lus receivers, color (spectral) correction and peak (amplitude) normalization can minimize uncertainties caused by imper-fect realizations of the Commission Interna-tionale de l’Eclairage (CIE) color match-ing functions. As {{a result of the}} corrections, stable light sources of different spectral power distributions can be measured with an accuracy dominated by the sub tenths of a percent uncertainty of novel spectral response determinations.

40|$|Crumb color quality {{characteristics}} of bread of different compositions (whole grain, rye, barley and diet bread) at 24 hours intervals during {{three days after}} bread preparation were investigated {{by means of a}} MOM-color 100 <b>tristimulus</b> photo <b>colorimeter,</b> in CIE, CIELab, ANLAB and Hunter systems. The highest value of average reflectance y (%) was found for barley bread (immediately after preparation), so that can be said that this sample was “conditionally” the lightest. The lowest values of y (%) were found for diet bread, {{so that it can be}} considered as the “conditionally” the darkest product. Colors of all investigated bread samples were lighter after three days of keeping compared to day 0. Changes of average reflectance of bread samples packed in polyethylene packaging with keeping time can be described by linear equation (correlation coefficient 0. 99). The dominant wavelength of barley and diet bread confirm the presence of yellow pigment. Color qualities of the mentioned kinds of bread depend on processes during bread staling and raw material composition of bread (flour). Color quality measurements can be used as easy auxiliary method for screening in the development of slower staling bread...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. As a depigmenting treatment, {{combined}} topical ap-plications of all-trans {{retinoic acid}} (atRA) aqueous gel and 5 % hydroquinone, 7 % lactic acid ointment {{were used for}} Oriental patients with hyperpigmented skin lesions such as senile len-tigines and nevus spilus.

40|$|A new {{calibration}} method {{has been developed}} to improve the accuracy of chromaticity coordinates obtained from a <b>tristimulus</b> <b>colorimeter</b> for color displays. Matrix methods {{such as the one}} recommended by ASTM are well known for this purpose, but they may fail to work as expected due to experimental noise and errors. As these matrix methods are based on tristimulus values, the accuracy of the luminance measurement affects the accuracy of the corrected chromaticity. This new method utilizes x, y values only, and is independent of Y values. Thus, in principle, it eliminates errors due to luminance measurement variations. A correction matrix is obtained from the x, y values of three primary colors and a white color of a display, measured by the target instrument and a reference instrument. A computer simulation was conducted to evaluate the effect of random noise in Y. Experiments were conducted using a commercial <b>tristimulus</b> <b>colorimeter</b> and a spectroradiometer, measuring 14 colors of a CRT display.

Activation energies of 31 and 36 kJ/mol were determined for TCD* and normalized L*, respectively.

40|$|A {{watershed}} scale {{approach to}} examining post-European settlement erosion-sedimentation was undertaken on the Des Moines Lobe in northcentral Iowa. Two closed basins comprised of glacigenic diamicton {{were selected for}} detailed field examination. The objectives {{of the study were}} to quantify post-settlement erosion-sedimentation rates and to characterize post-settlement hillslope sediments (PSHS) and the underlying buried soils. Soil morphology, particle-size distribution, mass magnetic susceptibility measurements, organic carbon depth distributions, quantitative soil color measurements, and cesium- 137 depth distributions were utilized to identify PSHS and quantify erosion-sedimentation rates. Maximum thicknesses of 100 and 93 cm of PSHS were described in the two basins. Average post-settlement erosion rates were calculated to be 6. 3 and 12 Mg/ha/yr for the two basins. These rates are approximately 10 times greater than pre-settlement rates for similar basins and geologic materials in northcentral Iowa reported in the literature. Post-settlement erosion-sedimentation resulted in the loss of at least 1. 0 m of total relief in both basins since the time when land clearing and cultivation were initiated (approximately 1870). PSHS were coarser, contained less organic carbon, exhibited higher mass magnetic susceptibility values, and had higher bulk densities than the underlying buried soils. Difficulties utilizing Soil Taxonomy and master horizon nomenclature were encountered during the classification and description of PSHS;Quantitative relationships between soil color, soil texture, and organic matter content of three small drainage basins on the Des Moines Lobe were also examined. Quantitative soil color measurements were made on 130 Ap horizons using a <b>tristimulus</b> <b>colorimeter.</b> Strong relationships were observed between organic matter content and percent moist reflectance (r 2 = 0. 77), moist Munsell value (r 2 = 0. 77), moist Munsell chroma (r 2 = 0. 68), percent sand (r 2 = 0. 74), percent clay (r 2 = 0. 71), and geometric mean particle diameter (r 2 = 0. 74). Logarithmic relationships existed for reflectance, Munsell value and chroma, and geometric mean particle diameter while linear relationships were observed for sand and clay contents.
