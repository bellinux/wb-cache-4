5|$|An assault is {{not caused}} if a {{defendant}} threatens to shoot <b>the</b> <b>victim,</b> but <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> {{is aware that}} the gun is not loaded or fake. However, {{it would be the}} actus reus of an assault if <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> wrongly believes the gun is, or may be, loaded. Since assault is a summary offence, no prosecutions take place for attempted assault. However, it is possible to commit attempts of aggravated forms of assault.|$|E

30|$|An {{attacker}} {{intends to}} login to a user/victim’s account after the attacker obtains <b>the</b> <b>victim’s</b> username and password/PIN. The attacker may observe or record <b>the</b> <b>victim’s</b> entry of passwords or PINs. However, {{it is assumed}} that the attacker cannot obtain any sensor data about <b>the</b> <b>victim’s</b> typing of passwords/PINs from <b>the</b> <b>victim’s</b> smartwatch; instead, <b>the</b> attacker has the following capabilities. First, the attacker may obtain <b>the</b> <b>victim’s</b> username and password (e.g., by shoulder-surfing attack or key logger). Second, the attacker may obtain <b>the</b> <b>victim’s</b> keystroke timing data and imitate <b>the</b> <b>victim’s</b> keystroke as shown in (Meng et al. 2013). In such imitation attacks, the attacker may wear the same kind of smartwatch and access the same kind of keyboard as <b>the</b> <b>victim’s.</b>|$|R

5|$|Almost all jumping spiders are predators, mostly {{preying on}} insects, on other spiders, {{and on other}} arthropods.

Most jumping spiders walk throughout the day, so that they maximize their chances of a catch.|$|E

5|$|An {{attacker}} having gained authentication material may impersonate {{the material}}'s owner after <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> has patched Heartbleed, {{as long as}} the material is accepted (for example, until the password is changed or the private key revoked). Heartbleed therefore constitutes a critical threat to confidentiality. However, an attacker impersonating a victim may also alter data. Indirectly, Heartbleed's consequences may thus go far beyond a confidentiality breach for many systems.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Munch and Kellerman {{investigate}} a murder at Oriole Park at Camden Yards during a late-season baseball game, leaving 48,000 possible suspects. The Long Island man, presumably a Yankees fan, is found {{beaten to death}} on the stairs of the stadium, and the governor of Maryland pressures the police department to solve the murder before the game ends so that millions in tourism dollars and ticket revenues will not be jeopardized. After several fruitless interviews, Munch and Kellerman question Scott Russell (Brian Tarantina), a New Yorker who attended the game with <b>the</b> <b>victim.</b> Russell admits he killed <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> because he said the Baltimore Orioles were a better team than the Yankees. He agrees to confess to the murder if they let him watch {{the rest of the}} game. Back at the police department, Falsone continues questioning detectives about the Luther Mahoney shooting. Stivers expresses concern to Lewis that their covering for Kellerman's role in the shooting could bring both of them down if Falsone continues his questioning.|$|E
