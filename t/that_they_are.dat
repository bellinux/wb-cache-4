5|$|It {{has been}} argued {{variously}} that the Eskaya are a remnant of the original indigenous settlers on Bohol; that they migrated to Bohol from Sumatra {{in the seventh century}} A.D.; <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> descendants of the resistance groups that fought under Francisco Dagohoy; <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> a cult or secret society; or <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> a conscious reconstruction of an imagined pre-colonial society.|$|E
5|$|A common {{misconception}} is that {{signs are}} iconically self-explanatory, <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> a transparent imitation {{of what they}} mean, or even <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> pantomime. In fact, many signs bear no resemblance to their referent, either because they were originally arbitrary symbols or because their iconicity has been obscured over time. Even so, in ASL iconicity plays a significant role; {{a high percentage of}} signs resemble their referents in some way. This {{may be due to the}} fact that the medium of sign—three-dimensional space—naturally allows more iconicity than oral language.|$|E

5|$|Interesting, perhaps, {{in the use}} {{of weapons}} in these recent “revolutionary” works is <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are,</b> {{generally}} speaking, not reenactments of traditional folk dances.
