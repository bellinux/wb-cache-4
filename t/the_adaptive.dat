40|$|AbstractThis paper aims at {{modelling}} an electronically coupled distributed {{energy resource}} with an <b>adaptive</b> protection scheme. <b>The</b> electronically coupled {{distributed energy resource}} is a microgrid framework formed by coupling the renewable energy source electronically. Further, <b>the</b> proposed <b>adaptive</b> protection scheme provides a suitable protection to the microgrid for various fault conditions irrespective of the operating mode of the microgrid: namely, grid connected mode and islanded mode. The outstanding aspect of <b>the</b> developed <b>adaptive</b> protection scheme is that it monitors the microgrid and instantly updates relay fault current according to the variations {{that occur in the}} system. <b>The</b> proposed <b>adaptive</b> protection scheme also employs auto reclosures, through which <b>the</b> proposed <b>adaptive</b> protection scheme recovers faster from the fault and thereby increases the consistency of the microgrid. The effectiveness of <b>the</b> proposed <b>adaptive</b> protection is studied through the time domain simulations carried out in the PSCAD⧹EMTDC software environment...|$|R

5|$|The {{immune system}} protects organisms from {{infection}} with layered defenses of increasing specificity. In simple terms, physical barriers prevent pathogens such as bacteria and viruses {{from entering the}} organism. If a pathogen breaches these barriers, the innate immune system provides an immediate, but non-specific response. Innate immune systems are found in all plants and animals. If pathogens successfully evade the innate response, vertebrates possess a second layer of protection, <b>the</b> <b>adaptive</b> immune system, which is activated by the innate response. Here, the immune system adapts its response during an infection to improve its recognition of the pathogen. This improved response is then retained after the pathogen has been eliminated, {{in the form of}} an immunological memory, and allows <b>the</b> <b>adaptive</b> immune system to mount faster and stronger attacks each time this pathogen is encountered.|$|E

5|$|However, {{contrary}} to {{the expectations of the}} Red Queen hypothesis, Hanley et al. found that the prevalence, abundance and mean intensity of mites was significantly higher in sexual geckos than in asexuals sharing the same habitat. Furthermore, Parker, after reviewing numerous genetic studies on plant disease resistance, failed to find a single example consistent with the concept that pathogens are the primary selective agent responsible for sexual reproduction in their host. At an even more fundamental level, Heng and Gorelick and Heng reviewed evidence that sex, rather than enhancing diversity, acts as a constraint on genetic diversity. They considered that sex acts as a coarse filter, weeding out major genetic changes, such as chromosomal rearrangements, but permitting minor variation, such as changes at the nucleotide or gene level (that are often neutral) to pass through the sexual sieve. <b>The</b> <b>adaptive</b> function of sex, today, remains a major unresolved issue in biology. The competing models to explain <b>the</b> <b>adaptive</b> function of sex were reviewed by Birdsell and Wills.
