5|$|Major Kean {{returned}} to {{the ground floor of}} the Chancery and ordered his men to withdraw into a large semicircle at the main entrance to the Chancery. Most of the Marines were inside the Chancery when the crowds outside the Embassy broke through the gates into the compound. The Marines closed and bolted the Chancery door, the elevators were locked by Seabees on the sixth floor and the Marines withdrew up the stairwells locking grill gates behind them. On the ground floor a water tanker was driven through the Chancery door and the crowd began to surge up through the building toward <b>the</b> <b>rooftop.</b> The Marines on <b>the</b> <b>rooftop</b> had sealed the doors and were using Mace to discourage the crowd from trying to break through. Sporadic gunfire from around the Embassy passed over <b>the</b> <b>rooftop.</b>|$|E

5|$|By 02:15 on 30 April one CH-46 and one CH-53 were {{landing at}} the Embassy every 10 minutes. At this time, the Embassy {{indicated}} that another 19 lifts would complete the evacuation. At that time Major Kean {{estimated that there}} were still some 850 non-American evacuees and 225 Americans (including the Marines), and Ambassador Martin told Major Kean {{to do the best}} he could. At 03:00 Ambassador Martin ordered Major Kean to move all the remaining evacuees into the parking lot LZ which was the Marines' final perimeter. At 03:27 President Gerald Ford ordered that no more than 19 additional lifts would be allowed to complete the evacuation. At 04:30 with the 19 lift limit already exceeded, Major Kean went to <b>the</b> <b>rooftop</b> LZ and spoke over a helicopter radio with General Carey who advised that President Ford had ordered that the airlift be limited to US personnel. Major Kean was then ordered to withdraw his men into the Chancery building and withdraw to <b>the</b> <b>rooftop</b> LZ for evacuation.|$|E
5|$|Crazy and Roz {{are then}} seen at a pier. Rozzie {{tells him that}} Vinnie is {{ditching}} town, her and the rumble, which makes Crazy {{the leader of the}} Stompers.

5000|$|When the Wrigley Field was {{constructed}} in 1914, the buildings along Waveland and Sheffield avenues gave spectators a view {{of what was going}} on inside <b>the</b> ballpark. <b>The</b> <b>rooftops</b> were not seen as [...] "big business." [...] They would later become a popular spectator area during the 1929 World Series. The 1938 World Series brought [...] "paying" [...] spectators to <b>the</b> <b>rooftops.</b> Fans sat in lawn chairs and brought their own food and beverages. It was not until the mid 1980's owners began updating <b>the</b> <b>rooftops</b> to have bleacher-style grandstands. <b>The</b> <b>rooftops</b> were also turned into a legitimate business. More businesses began purchasing rooftops around Wrigley Field seeing them as profitable resource. The Sky Box on Sheffield open in 1993. Back then, it catered to cooperate groups. Today, it is complete with a two-tier roof deck, indoor clubhouse, fully staffed bars on three levels, and an elevator.|$|R

5|$|Imaginative spectators {{would climb}} {{the church and}} watch a {{football}} game from <b>the</b> <b>rooftop</b> however they have now been deterred from doing so with the installation of security measures such as barbed wire and anti-climb paint. In addition, {{the introduction of the}} 'all-seater' ruling following the Taylor Report has meant that spectators no longer resort to climbing nearby buildings for a glimpse of the event as a seat is guaranteed with a purchased ticket.|$|E
5|$|On September 29, 2006, Monsoor's platoon engaged four {{insurgents in}} a firefight, killing one and {{injuring}} another. Anticipating further attacks, Monsoor, three SEAL snipers and three Iraqi Army soldiers {{took up a}} rooftop position. Civilians aiding the insurgents blocked off the streets, and a nearby mosque broadcast a message for people {{to fight against the}} Americans and the Iraqi soldiers. Monsoor was protecting other SEALs, two of whom were 15 feet away from him. Monsoor's position made him the only SEAL on <b>the</b> <b>rooftop</b> with quick access to an escape route.|$|E
5|$|On <b>the</b> <b>rooftop</b> {{and roof}} ridges are iconic statues of golden deer {{flanking}} a Dharma wheel, victory flags and monstrous fish.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Rooftop</b> Telescope is a 9.5-inch {{refractor}} {{that was}} originally constructed in 1894 by Warner and Swasey {{for their own}} use. The telescope was the first instrument of the Warner and Swasey Observatory and was originally used at the Taylor Road facility, but was put into storage when the Astronomy Department of Case Western Reserve University was relocated to the A. W. Smith building on the main campus. In 1986 the telescope was reinstalled in a new dome {{on the roof of}} the A. W. Smith building.|$|E
5|$|The film {{comes to}} an end with Sue {{describing}} the impact of the boys on her life. As she and Sonia watch from <b>the</b> <b>rooftop</b> that Ajay proposed to her on, they have a vision of the boys running in the fields, singing happily and victoriously throwing their shirts in the air, acting as if they are celebrating life itself, as if the ebb of their once-there vitality still reverberates in the places where they once used to go, and a wave of melancholy comes over the two surviving women.|$|E
5|$|The first {{places to}} reach grid parity were {{those with high}} {{traditional}} electricity prices {{and high levels of}} solar radiation. Currently, more capacity is being installed in <b>the</b> <b>rooftop</b> than in the utility-scale segment. However, the worldwide distribution of solar parks is expected to change as different regions achieve grid parity. This transition also includes a shift from rooftop towards utility-scale plants, since the focus of new PV deployment has changed from Europe towards the Sunbelt markets where ground-mounted PV systems are favored.|$|E

5|$|The king {{ordered the}} {{construction}} of the Champavati Temple. Now, the temple is under the Archaeological Survey of India, for its historical and archaeological importance. The major attraction of the temple is its Shikhara style architecture. Stone carved walls, full with sculptures, make the temple an attractive tourist spot. The temple has a large wheel on <b>the</b> <b>rooftop,</b> which adores it and makes it a distinguished temple in North India. The Champavati Temple is often compared with Laxmi Narayan Temple, in its grandeur.|$|E
5|$|The mall {{was plagued}} by {{structural}} problems and leaks throughout its history. It underwent a partial structural failure on June 23, 2012, when a 12m x 24m (39'-by-79') segment of <b>the</b> <b>rooftop</b> parking deck collapsed into the building, crashing through the upper level lottery kiosk adjacent to the food court and escalators to the ground floor below. More than 20 people received non-life-threatening injuries and two {{people died in the}} collapse. An investigation and class action lawsuits into the collapse are ongoing and the mall has been demolished.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} {{opens with a}} scene in which Eminem stands on <b>the</b> <b>rooftop</b> of the Manhattan Municipal Building in New York, saying the {{introductory}} lyrics. The video cuts between scenes where he raps on <b>the</b> <b>rooftop</b> and another scene where Eminem is trapped inside a dark basement. Eminem moves closer towards the edge of the building until he leaves to go downstairs as the chorus begins. He starts walking down Market Street in Newark and jaywalks across the street, avoiding vehicles that pass by. Eminem sees distorted reflections of himself on the window of a car; he continues on, only to be surrounded by a series of mirrors. Confused, Eminem tries to escape, and {{towards the end of the}} second chorus, he breaks through a mirror to find himself in the middle of the street. Interspersing scenes show Eminem as he tries to break out of the basement. As the camera zooms out, the viewers see him on the edge of a destroyed street while a subway tunnel can be seen below the road.|$|E
