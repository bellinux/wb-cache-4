5|$|The use {{of calcium}} channel blockers, {{thought to be}} able to prevent the spasm of blood vessels by {{preventing}} calcium from entering smooth muscle cells, has been proposed for prevention. The calcium channel blocker nimodipine when taken by mouth improves outcome if given between the fourth and twenty-first day after the bleeding, even if it does not reduce the amount of vasospasm detected on angiography. In traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, nimodipine does not affect long-term outcome, and is not recommended. Other calcium channel blockers and magnesium sulfate have been studied, but are not presently recommended; neither is <b>there</b> <b>any</b> <b>evidence</b> that shows benefit if nimodipine is given intravenously.|$|E

Adjunctive antibiotics in the form of amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid does not increase the clinical pregnancy rate compared with no antibiotics.|$|E

25|$|In one method, the {{practitioner}} places crystals on {{different parts of}} the body, often corresponding to chakras; or else {{the practitioner}} places crystals around the body in an attempt to construct an energy grid, which is purported to surround the client with healing energy. Despite this, scientific investigations have not validated claims that chakras or energy grids actually exist, nor is <b>there</b> <b>any</b> <b>evidence</b> that crystal healing has any greater effect upon the body than any other placebo; for these reasons it is considered a pseudoscience.|$|E
25|$|The {{subsequent}} {{investigation found}} that the fire had started towards {{the rear of the}} plane, in either the lavatory or the luggage area {{at the back of the}} cabin. No items recovered from the front portion of the wreckage showed any evidence of fire damage before the impact, nor was <b>there</b> <b>any</b> <b>evidence</b> of fire in the engines or fuel systems. The investigators narrowed the cause down to the firing of some combustible substance, either accidentally by a passenger or crew member or through vibration or some other natural occurrence, or deliberately by bombing.|$|E

The court dismissed {{the claims of the}} last landowners, whose property lay between Water Street and the shore, as being improperly based on unofficial land records and for being based on maps and other documents which did not accurately reflect the physical land.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{constant}} {{media attention}} on preference deals, and a widely held {{belief that the}} two party preferred result for the election would be close, the Newspoll figures during the three {{months prior to the}} election showed little alteration in the first preference margin between the parties, nor was <b>there</b> <b>any</b> <b>evidence</b> of any voter volatility. The figures suggested, then, that as the Coalition's first preference vote was healthy, the most likely result was a Government victory. This was born out in the election results when the Liberal first preference vote of 40.5 per cent was 3.4 percentage points higher than in 2001, while Labor's first-preference vote of 37.6 per cent was its lowest since the elections of 1931 and 1934. Preference flows from minor parties {{are much more likely to}} affect an election outcome when the two major parties are close. The collapse of Labor's primary vote therefore negated this effect, even though 61 out of 150 House of Representatives seats were decided on preferences.|$|E

500|$|The Declaration was {{neglected}} {{in the years}} immediately following the American Revolution, having served its original purpose in announcing the independence of the United States. Early celebrations of Independence Day largely ignored the Declaration, as did early histories of the Revolution. The act of declaring independence was considered important, whereas the text announcing that act attracted little attention. The Declaration was rarely mentioned during the debates about the United States Constitution, and its language was not incorporated into that document. George Mason's draft of the Virginia Declaration of Rights was more influential, and its language was echoed in state constitutions and state bills of rights more often than Jefferson's words. [...] "In none of these documents", wrote Pauline Maier, [...] "is <b>there</b> <b>any</b> <b>evidence</b> whatsoever that the Declaration of Independence lived in men's minds as a classic statement of American political principles." ...|$|E

Having fallen out with, and abandoned, Nancy Storace, he had travelled to France in 1815 with a Mrs. Wright, whose husband sued him for criminal conversation (and eventually was awarded £1000). While the suit was pending, Braham had the unusual experience of being hissed during a performance of Handel's Israel in Egypt (the very piece cited by Lamb in his 1821 essay), on which he stepped forward and addressed the audience: ...|$|E
