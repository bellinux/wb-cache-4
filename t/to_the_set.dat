5|$|A {{series of}} safety {{meetings}} were scheduled {{in order to}} prevent accidents on the set. One of the items on the agenda was finding the closest hospital <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>set,</b> according to make-up effects coordinator John Vulich. Furthermore, several of the cast and crew members had a fear of snakes, including Manners, David Duchovny, and John Shiban. During one of the days that the show was being prepped, a snake wrangler brought several live rattlesnakes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>set,</b> but one escaped. It was eventually found behind Manners' desk. In order to prevent future accidents, the mouths of the snakes were sutured shut.|$|E
5|$|Therefore, {{the set of}} all numbers ua + vb is {{equivalent}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>set</b> of multiples m of g. In other words, the set of all possible sums of integer multiples of two numbers (a and b) {{is equivalent}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>set</b> of multiples of gcd(a, b). The GCD {{is said to be}} the generator of the ideal of a and b. This GCD definition led to the modern abstract algebraic concepts of a principal ideal (an ideal generated by a single element) and a principal ideal domain (a domain in which every ideal is a principal ideal).|$|E
5|$|A devoted Star Trek fan, Pausch {{was invited}} by film {{director}} J. J. Abrams to film {{a role in}} Star Trek. Abrams heard of Pausch's condition and sent a personal e-mail inviting Pausch <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>set.</b> Pausch accepted and traveled to Los Angeles, California, to shoot his scene. In addition to appearing in the film, {{he also has a}} line of dialogue {{at the beginning of the}} film ("Captain, we have visual.") and donated the $217.06 paycheck to charity.|$|E

5|$|Before filming began Dorff, Fanning, and Lala Sloatman (who plays Marco's ex-wife) improvised {{meals and}} fights to {{understand}} the family's dynamic. Dorff also collected Fanning from school and they spent an afternoon together to bond. Dorff stayed in the Chateau Marmont during principal photography, {{making it easier to}} get <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>set</b> and understand the character. Coppola also showed Dorff Paper Moon (1973) during production.|$|E
5|$|Cast {{and crew}} began {{arriving}} in Florida on October 1, to shoot scenes on Dania Beach and around South Florida. That same day, Downey returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>set</b> after his ankle injury. In early October, scenes were {{shot at a}} replica of the Malibu restaurant Neptune's Net, and filming took place on location at the Vizcaya Museum and Gardens. Scenes were shot during the daytime inside the Miami Beach Resort at Miami Beach on October 10 and 11. The production returned to Wilmington in mid-October for additional filming. On November 1, scenes were shot at the Vizcaya Museum and Gardens. Filming in the United States wrapped on November 7 in Wilmington.|$|E
5|$|Filming of {{the second}} series was {{scheduled}} in two blocks: the first—directed by Andrew Grieve—ran from 2 July to 11 August and the second—directed by Edward Hall—from 20 August to 29 September. Shooting was again based in Swaffham. Norris took a break from filming in August {{to give birth to}} her daughter, returning <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>set</b> to complete her scenes in September.|$|E

5|$|On March 25, 2013, {{the casting}} of Marina Sirtis as Orli Elbaz, the new {{director}} of Mossad, was announced. Sirtis, who formerly portrayed the main character Deanna Troi in the Star Trek enterprise, indicated that she enjoyed working with Mark Harmon {{and said that he}} welcomed her <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>set</b> by bringing her breakfast {{on the first day of}} filming.|$|E
5|$|Preliminary {{scouting}} {{was well}} underway {{by the time}} Fargo was renewed. Principal photography began in Calgary, Alberta on January 19, 2015, and took 85 days. The city's central business district and Kensington neighborhood doubled for Kansas City, Sioux Falls, and Luverne. Production crew constructed the Waffle Hut set on the CL Ranch in neighboring Springbank. Elsewhere in the area, shooting took place in Didsbury, High River, and Fort Macleod. Initially, the weather posed a challenge for the production {{because it was too}} warm for snow. To solve this problem, the production crew brought snow <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>set</b> from nearby mountains.|$|E
5|$|Production on {{the film}} was {{temporarily}} shut down after a fire destroyed several soundstages at Paramount Studios, {{one of which was}} adjacent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>set</b> for the Genesis planet. Initially, the set's pyrotechnics were suspected of causing the fire, but the cause was ruled to be arson. Shatner was among the cast members who grabbed fire hoses to stop the flames. Correll hoped the place would burn down so that he would get his chance to film in Hawaii. While most of the set was undamaged, holes {{in the side of the}} building had to be covered with heavy black curtains to prevent outside light from leaking in.|$|E

5|$|Reddish {{paintings}} on wooden panels commissioned by Father Antonio Ubeda from 1856 to 1859 {{can be found}} inside the church. These are the Ascension of Our Lord and Pentecost on the doorway; and two portraits of the Doctors of the Church. A third portrait belonging <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>set</b> of Doctors of the Church is on the church museum while the fourth portrait is lost. The paintings Agony in the Garden and Crowning of Thorns, also commissioned by Father Úbeda, is currently housed at the San Agustin Museum in Intramuros, Manila. The works of art are done by Liberato Gachalian.|$|E
5|$|Season five {{introduced}} actor Kevin McKidd (Dr. Owen Hunt), who {{was signed}} as a series regular after originally being cast for a specific story arc. In addition, Jessica Capshaw (Dr. Arizona Robbins) was originally introduced for a three episode arc, but received a contract extension {{until the end of}} the season and then became a series regular in the sixth season. Knight departed the show at the conclusion of season five, citing an unhappiness with the development and lack of screen time for his character. Directly following Knight's departure, it was reported by Entertainment Weekly that Heigl had not returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>set</b> as scheduled after her maternity leave, and it was later confirmed that Heigl would not return to the show at all.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the actor}} had allotted {{a block of}} time to Seethamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu, 1:Nenokkadine filming was delayed. When the former neared completion, he resumed work on 1: Nenokkadine in late September 2012 in Hyderabad. Filming {{continued}} in Goa in mid-October, after a four-month hiatus, and a song with Mahesh and others was filmed in late October. The Goa schedule wrapped up on 1 November, with half the filming completed. Mahesh took a break to promote Seethamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu, returning <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>set</b> on 23 January 2013. The next shooting schedule, which began on 18 March, lasted for three weeks. Night scenes focusing on Mahesh and others were filmed in Kukatpally in mid-April.|$|E

5|$|The car {{scene with}} Gillian Anderson and Annabeth Gish {{was shot at}} Kanan Road, Malibu. Anderson and Gish sat in {{what is known as}} an insert car, while the crew sat in a pickup car in front of them. The birth scene was filmed at the old Paramount Movie Ranch. According to {{director}} Kim Manners, the most difficult scene to shoot was in the elevator with Mitch Pileggi and Nicholas Lea. Gish had never worked much with guns before joining The X-Files cast, so the producers got a retired LAPD officer to teach her more about firearms. She did some shooting practices before returning <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>set.</b> The FBI garage scenes were shot in Century City and took a total of four days to finish.|$|E
5|$|The {{theme music}} was {{composed}} by Peter Davis (who {{after the second}} series composed {{the rest of the}} series alone as principal composer), John Mealing and John G. Perry. The opening titles show the main characters striking a pose, with the name of the respective actor in a typewriter style typeface. Steven Moffat and Julia Sawalha were not very impressed with the opening titles when discussing them for a DVD commentary in 2004. They were re-recorded for series three, in the same style, to address the actors' ages and alterations <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>set.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{transporter}} {{had originally}} been developed for the television series {{as a matter of}} convenience; it would have been prohibitively expensive to show the Enterprise land on every new planet. For the redesign Michelson felt that the transporter should look and feel more powerful. He added a sealed control room that would protect operators from the powerful forces at work. The space between the transporter platform and the operators was filled with complex machinery, and cinematographer Richard Kline added eerie lighting <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>set</b> to create atmosphere.|$|E

5|$|Although Watts's {{work was}} seen as {{outdated}} and sentimental by the English Modernist movement, his experimentation with Symbolism and Expressionism drew respect from the European Modernists, notably the young Pablo Picasso, who echoed Hope's intentionally distorted features and broad sweeps of blue in The Old Guitarist (1903–1904). Despite Watts's fading reputation at home, {{by the time of}} his death in 1904 Hope had become a globally recognised image. Reproductions circulated in cultures as diverse as Japan, Australia and Poland, and Theodore Roosevelt, President of the United States, displayed a reproduction in his Summer White House at Sagamore Hill. By 1916, Hope was well-known enough in the United States that the stage directions for Angelina Weld Grimké's Rachel explicitly use the addition of a copy of Hope <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>set</b> to suggest improvements to the home over the passage of time.|$|E
5|$|Although {{meant to}} take place in Santa Barbara, California, the installment, like the {{majority}} of Psychs episodes, was filmed in and around the Vancouver area of British Columbia. According to the show's creator Steve Franks, about half of the scenes in each episode are filmed in the suburb town of White Rock. Several of the sets, like the Psych office and Henry Spencer's house, are located along the coast in the White Rock area. Because of the differences between Vancouver and Santa Barbara, the show's producers were forced to bring in props for each episode, such as nine fake palm trees which had to be trucked <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>set</b> every day. The scripts for each Psych episode had to go through several reviews, and often were cut down by as much as a few dozen pages. A large portion of show's dialogue consists of on-the-spot improvisation by the actors, specifically Roday and Hill. The writers noted that much of the humor in the installments came from improvisation. The episode also included several reoccurring gags on the show, such as an introductory flashback and the inclusion of a pineapple; both gags were created by the action of one of the actors.|$|E
5|$|Around 1845, Rosas {{managed to}} {{establish}} absolute dominance over the region. He exercised complete control over {{all aspects of}} society with the solid backing of the army. Rosas was raised from colonel to brigadier general (the highest army rank) on 18 December 1829. On 12 November 1840 he declined the newly created and higher rank of grand marshal (gran mariscal), which had been bestowed on him by the House of Representatives. The army was led by officers who had backgrounds and values similar to his. Confident of his power, Rosas made some concessions by returning confiscated properties to their owners, disbanding the Mazorca and ending torture and political assassinations. The inhabitants of Buenos Aires still dressed and behaved according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>set</b> of rules Rosas had imposed, but the climate of constant and widespread fear greatly diminished.|$|E
