5|$|Ideally, {{these social}} skills become {{incorporated}} into the internal working model {{to be used with}} other children and later with adult peers. As children move into the school years at about six years old, most develop a goal-corrected partnership with parents, in which each partner is willing to compromise in order to maintain a gratifying relationship. By middle childhood, the goal of <b>the</b> <b>attachment</b> behavioural system has changed from proximity to <b>the</b> <b>attachment</b> figure to availability. Generally, a child is content with longer separations, provided contact—or the possibility of physically reuniting, if needed—is available. Attachment behaviours such as clinging and following decline and self-reliance increases. By middle childhood (ages 7–11), there may be a shift toward mutual coregulation of secure-base contact in which caregiver and child negotiate methods of maintaining communication and supervision as the child moves toward a greater degree of independence.|$|E

40|$|The menisci are {{frequently}} injured due to both degeneration and traumatic tearing. It {{has been suggested}} that the success of a meniscal replacement is dependent on several factors, one of which is the secure fixation and firm <b>attachment</b> of <b>the</b> replacement to the tibial plateau. Therefore, the objectives of the current study were to (1) determine the failure properties of <b>the</b> meniscal horn <b>attachments,</b> and (2) determine the strain distribution over their surfaces. Eight bovine knee joints were used to study the mechanical response of <b>the</b> meniscal <b>attachments.</b> Three meniscal attachments from one knee of each animal were tested in uniaxial tension at 2 %/s to determine the load deformation response. During the tests, the samples were marked and local strain distributions were determined with a video extensometer. The linear modulus of <b>the</b> medial anterior <b>attachment</b> (1547134 MPa) was significantly less than both the medial posterior (2487179 MPa, p 0. 0111) and <b>the</b> lateral anterior <b>attachment</b> (2817214 MPa, p 0. 0007). Likewise, the ultimate strain for <b>the</b> medial anterior <b>attachments</b> (13. 578. 8 %) was significantly less than the medial posterior (23713 %, po 0. 0001) and <b>the</b> lateral anterior <b>attachment</b> (20. 3711. 1 %, p 0. 0033).

5|$|Early {{members of}} the ceratopsian group, such as Psittacosaurus, were small bipedal animals.
