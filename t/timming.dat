The workshop, entitled, 'Strengthening Democracy at Work', brought together the world's leading employee voice researchers, including: Peter Ackers (University of Loughborough), John Budd (University of Minnesota), Tony Dundon (National University of Ireland, Galway), Stewart Johnstone (University of Newcastle), Andrew Pendleton (York University) and Andrew <b>Timming</b> (University of St Andrews). Also present were several practitioners. The workshop was funded by the Scottish Universities Insight Institute and the Russell Trust. The first day took place in Glasgow and the second day was held at New Lanark. The workshop participants discussed the benefits of employee voice for employees, organisations and societies. In short, when employers give employees a 'say' in the strategic direction of the organisation, all three levels benefit.|$|E

Although he had not a stylized physique, his first {{movements}} on the field showed that Cabrera was specially skilled to control and pass the ball {{and he was also}} criterious to defend, being an outstanding blocker due to his <b>timming</b> to jump. He was not only a strategist but a great scorer, achieving an average of 28 points in one season. Moreover, his experience after many years of career and his permanent interest in the game made Cabrera deserver of nicknames such as [...] "El Mago" [...] (The Magician, in Spanish).|$|E
5000|$|CCS uses an {{advanced}} software package to facilitate scoring and operations. The operations system, RaceWurx, is developed by Bitgeist Corporation out of Miami, FL and the <b>timming</b> system is manufactured by Westhold Corporation of Santa Clara, CA. [...] Racers receive {{the use of}} an electronic transponder device when they register for a race. They then affix that transponder to the machine to be raced. When on the track, the transponder works with a hardware beacon and software system that records racers lap times, position, and other data, and feeds it to the race officials software system, which then allows the officials to know in real-time what is happening with the race. Participants benefit as well from the system due to faster posting of results, reduced error rates, and the ability to interface with the system in read-only mode to see current lap times, position, and other data. A racer's performance in an individual event gives that rider points, which are added to the rider's performance history. The aggregate number of points as well as a mathematically derived performance index are used by CCS to determine championship winners in RaceWurx as a given season progresses.|$|E

40|$|<b>Tim</b> 23 p is a {{mitochondrial}} inner {{membrane protein}} {{essential for the}} import of proteins from the cytosol. <b>Tim</b> 23 p contains an amino-terminal hydrophilic segment and a carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic domain (<b>Tim</b> 23 Cp). To study the functions and interactions of the two parts of <b>Tim</b> 23 p separately, we constructed <b>tim</b> 23 N, encoding only the hydrophilic region of <b>Tim</b> 23 p, and <b>tim</b> 23 C, encoding only the hydrophobic domain of <b>Tim</b> 23 p. Only the <b>Tim</b> 23 C protein is imported into mitochondria, indicating that the mitochondrial targeting information in <b>Tim</b> 23 p resides in its membrane spans or intervening loops. <b>Tim</b> 23 Cp, however, cannot substitute for full-length <b>Tim</b> 23 p, suggesting that the hydrophilic portion of <b>Tim</b> 23 p also performs an essential function in mitochondrial protein import. We found that overexpression of <b>Tim</b> 23 Cp is toxic to yeast cells that carry the <b>tim</b> 23 - 1 mutation. Excess <b>Tim</b> 23 Cp causes <b>Tim</b> 23 - 1 p to disappear, leaving <b>tim</b> 23 - 1 cells without a full-length version of the <b>Tim</b> 23 protein. If <b>Tim</b> 17 p, another inner membrane import component, is overexpressed along with <b>Tim</b> 23 Cp, the toxicity of <b>Tim</b> 23 Cp is largely reversed and the <b>Tim</b> 23 - 1 protein no longer disappears. In coimmunoprecipitations from solubilized mitochondria, <b>Tim</b> 17 p associates with the <b>Tim</b> 23 C protein. In addition, we show that <b>Tim</b> 23 p and <b>Tim</b> 17 p can be chemically cross-linked {{to each other in}} intact mitochondria. We conclude that the hydrophobic domain encoded by <b>tim</b> 23 C targets <b>Tim</b> 23 p to the mitochondria and mediates the direct interaction between <b>Tim</b> 23 p and <b>Tim</b> 17 p. In contrast, <b>Tim</b> 23 Cp cannot be coimmunoprecipitated with <b>Tim</b> 23 p, raising the possibility that the hydrophobic domain of <b>Tim</b> 23 p does not interact with other <b>Tim</b> 23 molecules...|$|R
40|$|The {{mitochondrial}} {{inner and}} outer membranes are composed {{of a variety of}} integral membrane proteins, assembled into the membranes posttranslationally. The small translocase of the inner mitochondrial membranes (<b>TIMs)</b> are a group of ∼ 10 kDa proteins that function as chaperones to ferry the imported proteins across the mitochondrial intermembrane space to the outer and inner membranes. In yeast, there are 5 small <b>TIM</b> proteins: <b>Tim</b> 8, <b>Tim</b> 9, <b>Tim</b> 10, <b>Tim</b> 12, and <b>Tim</b> 13, with equivalent proteins reported in humans. Using hidden Markov models, we find that many eukaryotes have proteins equivalent to the <b>Tim</b> 8 and <b>Tim</b> 13 and the <b>Tim</b> 9 and <b>Tim</b> 10 subunits. Some eukaryotes provide "snapshots" of evolution, with a single protein showing the features of both <b>Tim</b> 8 and <b>Tim</b> 13, suggesting that a single progenitor gene has given rise to each of the small <b>TIMs</b> through duplication and modification. We show that no "Tim 12 " family of proteins exist, but rather that variant forms of the cognate small <b>TIMs</b> have been recently duplicated and modified to provide new functions: the yeast <b>Tim</b> 12 is a modified form of <b>Tim</b> 10, whereas in humans and some protists variant forms of <b>Tim</b> 9, <b>Tim</b> 8, and <b>Tim</b> 13 are found instead. Sequence motif analysis reveals acidic residues conserved in the <b>Tim</b> 10 substrate-binding tentacles, whereas more hydrophobic residues are found in the equivalent substrate-binding region of <b>Tim</b> 13. The substrate-binding region of <b>Tim</b> 10 and <b>Tim</b> 13 represent structurally independent domains: when the acidic domain from <b>Tim</b> 10 is attached to <b>Tim</b> 13, the <b>Tim</b> 8 –Tim 13 ¹⁰ complex becomes essential and the <b>Tim</b> 9 –Tim 10 complex becomes dispensable. The conserved features in the <b>Tim</b> 10 and <b>Tim</b> 13 subunits provide distinct binding surfaces to accommodate the broad range of substrate proteins delivered to the mitochondrial {{inner and outer}} membranes...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the breaststroke <b>timming</b> of the movements of elbow, knee and forearm joints in the four swimming phases among selected university students. The subjects of the study were two national top swimmers, four trained and six untrained swimmers. They were sprinted 25 m breaststroke with their maximum effort attached to water-proof electrogoniometers (elbow, knee and forearm). Swimming form was taken by a high speed cine camera operating at 48 - 64 fps, and synchronized by 4 ch pen-oscillograph recorder. The magnitude of the angles for the flexion, extension, pronation and supination of elbow and forearm movements, and the flexion and extension of knee movements were measured by means of waterproof electrogoniometers. The angular velocity of elbow extension and forearm supination among the top and trained swimmers were significantly different from that of the untrained swimmers in the armstroke during at the pull phase. There was significant correlation coefficients between the angular velocity of elbow extension, forearm supination and the swimming velocity respectively. Moreover, the magnitudes of knee joint angle and angular velocity of knee joint among the top and trained swimmers, were significantly different from untrained swimmers. The <b>timming</b> of the armstroke and leg kick showed greater overlap among the untrained swimmers than among the top and trained ones during the P-R phase. The results indicated that untrained swimmer have already started leg recovery at the beginning of armstroke. It was suggested that during the recovery phase, the armstroke should be accerelated the amplitudes of knee joint angle be increased, and the leg kick be more accerelated in order to supply the propulsive force effectively in breaststroke. In conclusion, at the beginning of the catch of armstroke the <b>timming</b> of leg kick recovery of swimming beginner should be delayed...|$|E

40|$|We have {{identified}} a new protein, <b>Tim</b> 54 p, located in the yeast mitochondrial inner membrane. <b>Tim</b> 54 p is an essential import component, required for the insertion {{of at least two}} polytopic proteins into the inner membrane, but not for the translocation of precursors into the matrix. Several observations suggest that <b>Tim</b> 54 p and <b>Tim</b> 22 p are part of a protein complex in the inner membrane distinct from the previously characterized <b>Tim</b> 23 p-Tim 17 p complex. First, multiple copies of the <b>TIM</b> 22 gene, but not <b>TIM</b> 23 or <b>TIM</b> 17, suppress the growth defect of a <b>tim</b> 54 - 1 temperature-sensitive mutant. Second, <b>Tim</b> 22 p can be coprecipitated with <b>Tim</b> 54 p from detergent-solubilized mitochondria, but <b>Tim</b> 54 p and <b>Tim</b> 22 p do not interact with either <b>Tim</b> 23 p or <b>Tim</b> 17 p. Finally, the <b>tim</b> 54 - 1 mutation destabilizes the <b>Tim</b> 22 protein, but not <b>Tim</b> 23 p or <b>Tim</b> 17 p.

We propose that <b>Tim</b> 18 p is a new component of the <b>Tim</b> 54 p-Tim 22 p machinery that facilitates insertion of polytopic proteins into the mitochondrial inner membrane...|$|R
40|$|The {{mitochondrial}} intermembrane space {{contains a}} family of small <b>Tim</b> proteins that function as essential chaperones for protein import. The soluble <b>Tim</b> 9 –Tim 10 complex transfers hydrophobic precursor proteins through the aqueous intermembrane space to the carrier translocase of the inner membrane (<b>TIM</b> 22 complex). <b>Tim</b> 12, a peripheral membrane subunit of the <b>TIM</b> 22 complex, is thought to recruit a portion of <b>Tim</b> 9 –Tim 10 to the inner membrane. It is not known, however, how <b>Tim</b> 12 is assembled. We have identified a new intermediate in the biogenesis pathway of <b>Tim</b> 12. A soluble form of <b>Tim</b> 12 first assembles with <b>Tim</b> 9 and <b>Tim</b> 10 to form a <b>Tim</b> 12 -core complex. <b>Tim</b> 12 -core then docks onto the membrane-integrated subunits of the <b>TIM</b> 22 complex to form the holo-translocase.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Tim</b> 23 p (translocase of {{the inner}} membrane) is an {{essential}} import component located in the mitochondrial inner membrane. To determine how the <b>Tim</b> 23 protein itself is transported into mitochondria, we used chemical cross-linking to identify proteins adjacent to <b>Tim</b> 23 p during its biogenesis. In {{the absence of an}} inner membrane potential, <b>Tim</b> 23 p is translocated across the mitochondrial outer membrane, but not inserted into the inner membrane. At this intermediate stage, we find that <b>Tim</b> 23 p forms cross-linked products with two distinct protein complexes of the intermembrane space, <b>Tim</b> 8 p–Tim 13 p and <b>Tim</b> 9 p–Tim 10 p. <b>Tim</b> 9 p and <b>Tim</b> 10 p cross-link to the COOH-terminal domain of the <b>Tim</b> 23 protein, which carries all of the targeting signals for <b>Tim</b> 23 p. Therefore, our results suggest that the <b>Tim</b> 9 p–Tim 10 p complex {{plays a key role in}} <b>Tim</b> 23 p import. In contrast, <b>Tim</b> 8 p and <b>Tim</b> 13 p cross-link to the hydrophilic NH 2 -terminal segment of <b>Tim</b> 23 p, which does not carry essential import information and, thus, the role of <b>Tim</b> 8 p–Tim 13 p is unclear. <b>Tim</b> 23 p contains two matrix-facing, positively charged loops that are essential for its insertion into the inner membrane. The positive charges are not required for interaction with the <b>Tim</b> 9 p–Tim 10 p complex, but are essential for crosslinking of <b>Tim</b> 23 p to components {{of the inner}} membrane insertion machinery, including <b>Tim</b> 54 p, <b>Tim</b> 22 p...|$|R

It is a challenge to demonstrate the integration of sample preparation and detection techniques in a single platform. In this article we review the applications for PoC haematology and the current solutions that are available. We demonstrate a generic microfluidic platform that combines sample processing and characterisation and enumeration in a single, integrated system. Results on microfluidic 3 -part differential (granulocyte, lymphocyte, monocytes) together with erythrocyte and thrombocyte (platelet) counts on human blood are shown and corroborated with results from hospital clinical laboratory analysis. Conclusions: Identifying and counting {{the different}} subpopulations of human bloodcells is both clinically useful and technologically challenging. It provides a useful target application {{for the creation of a}} generic microfluidic platform technology in a single, hybrid cartidge. The prinicpal demand is to combine sample sample preparation with impedance cytometery to cover the large dynamic range in cell number, size and morphology. In particular, the ability to count both the relatively abundant, but small platelets at the same time as counting the relatively rare, but large monocytes, is a challenge. The technologies require good control of chemistry, accurate <b>timming</b> and control of flow, and precise control of concentrations, all of which are delivered through a well designed microfluidic sample preparation. The system described in this paper perform cell analysis and enumeration copuled with sample preprocessing and dilution. Using clinical blood, it has demonstrated good concordance with large scale hospital analysers. Beyond blood cell counting, the microfluidic platform technology will be useful in a range of applications in the future, including subtyping of blood cells, counting rare cells, cell assays and other matrices...|$|E

40|$|The protein {{transport}} {{machinery of}} the inner mitochondrial membrane contains three essential <b>Tim</b> proteins. <b>Tim</b> 17 and <b>Tim</b> 23 are thought to build a preprotein translocation channel, while <b>Tim</b> 44 transiently interacts with the matrix heat shock protein Hsp 70 to form an ATP-driven import motor. For this report we characterized the biogenesis and interactions of <b>Tim</b> proteins. (i) Import of the precursor of <b>Tim</b> 44 into the inner membrane requires mtHsp 70, whereas import and inner membrane integration of the precursors of <b>Tim</b> 17 and <b>Tim</b> 23 are independent of functional mtHsp 70. (ii) <b>Tim</b> 17 efficiently associates with <b>Tim</b> 23 and mtHsp 70, but only weakly with <b>Tim</b> 44. (iii) Depletion of <b>Tim</b> 44 {{does not affect the}} co-precipitation of <b>Tim</b> 17 with antibodies directed against mtHsp 70. (iv) <b>Tim</b> 23 associates with both <b>Tim</b> 44 and <b>Tim</b> 17, suggesting the presence of two <b>Tim</b> 23 pools in the inner membrane, a <b>Tim</b> 44 -Tim 23 -containing sub-complex and a <b>Tim</b> 23 -Tim 17 -containing sub-complex. (v) The association of mtHsp 70 with the <b>Tim</b> 23 -Tim 17 sub-complex is ATP sensitive and can be distinguished from the mtHsp 70 -Tim 44 interaction by the differential influence of an amino acid substitution in mtHsp 70. (vi) Genetic evidence, suppression of the protein import defect of a <b>tim</b> 17 yeast mutant by overexpression of mtHsp 70 and synthetic lethality of conditional mutants in the genes of <b>Tim</b> 17 and mtHsp 70, supports a functional interaction of mtHsp 70 with <b>Tim</b> 17.

40|$|Import of carrier {{proteins}} {{from the}} cytoplasm into the mitochondrial inner membrane of yeast is mediated by a distinct system {{consisting of two}} soluble 70 -kDa protein complexes in the intermembrane space and a 300 -kDa complex in the inner membrane, the <b>TIM</b> 22 complex. The <b>TIM</b> 22 complex contains the peripheral subunits <b>Tim</b> 9 p, <b>Tim</b> 10 p, and <b>Tim</b> 12 p and the integral membrane subunits <b>Tim</b> 22 p and <b>Tim</b> 54 p. We identify here an additional subunit, an 18 -kDa integral membrane protein termed <b>Tim</b> 18 p. This protein is made as a 21. 9 -kDa precursor which is imported into mitochondria and processed to its mature form. When mitochondria are gently solubilized, <b>Tim</b> 18 p comigrates with the other subunits of the <b>TIM</b> 22 complex on nondenaturing gels and is coimmunoprecipitated with <b>Tim</b> 54 p and <b>Tim</b> 12 p. <b>Tim</b> 18 p does not cofractionate with the <b>TIM</b> 23 complex upon immunoprecipitation or nondenaturing gel electrophoresis.

40|$|Plants {{have evolved}} the {{circadian}} clock to anticipate environmental changes and coordinate internal biological processes. Recent studies unveiled the circadian regulation on plant immune responses {{as well as}} a reciprocal effect of immune activation on the clock activity. However, it is still largely unknown how the circadian clock interacts with specific immune signals. Plant hormone salicylic acid (SA) is a key immune signal. Its accumulation is sufficient to trigger immune responses and establish broad-spectrum resistance, known as systemic acquired resistance (SAR). My dissertation work studied whether SA could interact with the circadian clock and what potential mechanisms and the biological significance are. I first found that SA could reinforce the circadian clock through the modulation of redox state in an NONEXPRESSER OF PR 1 (NPR 1) -dependent manner. The basal redox state manifested by the NADPH abundance is shown to display a circadian rhythm. Perturbation in this cellular redox rhythm caused by the immune signal SA is sensed by the master immune regulator NPR 1. NPR 1 then triggers defense genes expression to generate SAR as well as transcriptionally activates several clock genes to reinforce the circadian clock. Since the basal redox state, which reflects the cellular metabolic activities, is under the circadian control, the reinforced circadian clock may negate the SA-triggered redox perturbation to restore the normal redox rhythm. One of NPR 1 -regulated clock components is <b>TIMMING</b> OF CAB 2 EXPRESSION 1 (TOC 1). SA/NPR 1 -mediated increase in TOC 1 expression alone could lead to dampening of SAR through direct transcriptional repression on defense genes. Since maintenance of the immune responses is an energy-costly process, the strength and duration of SAR, a preventative defense strategy, need to be fine-tuned to reduce unnecessary energy expenditure. Therefore, both SA-dependent circadian clock reinforcement and the specific clock component TOC 1 induction help to ensure a proper immune induction and a balanced energy allocation between defense and normal metabolic activities. Besides the SA effects on the circadian clock, the circadian clock is found to reciprocally regulate SA biosynthesis. The clock gene, CCA 1 HIKING EXPEDITION (CHE), and the major SA synthesis gene, ISOCHORISMATE SYNTHASE 1 (ICS 1), show in-phase oscillatory rhythms, indicating that CHE may contribute to generation of the circadian rhythm of the basal SA level. I found that CHE, as a transcription factor, directly binds to the promoter of ICS 1 to positively regulate its expression. After pathogen infection, CHE promotes endogenous SA biosynthesis and acts as a positive regulator of SAR. The function of the clock component CHE in activating ICS 1 not only reveals a novel transcriptional regulatory mechanism of SA accumulation but also provides a new molecular link between the circadian clock and plant immunity. In summary, my dissertation studies identified previously unknown molecular mechanisms of how the circadian clock mediates SA biosynthesis and SA-triggered immune responses. The interplay between the circadian clock and SA achieves a balance between activation of immune responses and maintenance of normal metabolic activities. Further studies may explore how other plant immune signals affect the circadian clock as well as how different clock components coordinately regulate the plant immunity. These future directions will broaden our understanding about the clock-immunity crosstalk. Dissertatio...|$|E
40|$|The main {{topic of}} this {{research}} is the implementation of a mathematical approach for visual information retrieval (VIR) systems. The purpose {{of this research}} is the creation of a model design to predict behaviors in VIR systems to establish relations between elements that deal with VIR systems. A direct method is tested with a subspace arrangement approach. A radial basis function (RBF) is tested as similarity metric and the General Principal Component Analysis (GPCA) is modified inside its segmentation process. The implementation of this mathematical model is to built of a corpus image selection, an appropriate descriptor method, a segmentation approach and a similarity metric process. These are called VIR elements. The goal {{of this research is}} to found a mathematical formalism to explain how all the previously mentioned items can be relation between and then to make predictions about behavior inside a VIR system. Initially, four corpus of data are tested, the descriptor of RGB colors is implemented to obtain a three dimensional description of image data. Then a selection of radial basis function is used to implement a similarity metric. A visual image retrieval system is sketched obtaining a model of predictions that can be detected improving design of future VIR systems. Several versions of GPCA were tested to select the best algorithm which achieve the highest segmentation of image set. A variation of Robust general principal component analysis with multivariate <b>timming</b> (RGPCA-MVT) were carried out to improve the percentage of successful segmentation. A radial basis function is implemented in the retrieval process of the VIR system. Experimentations with COIL collections successfully retrieve an 88 % of queries. An improvement is obtained in the RGPCA-MVT with RBF (radial basis function) basis. The detection of ambiguity items to implement a VIR system can be achieved tested another kind of feature extraction methods. The Gutmann algorithm can be used in further works to improve the RGPCA-MVT segmentation. The novelty of contribution in this research is to taken an approach that has been applied at ordinary differential equations that is applied in VIR field applied as similarity metric for a retrieval process with a radial basis function that allows encouraging results in image querying.
