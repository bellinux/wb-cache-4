2500|$|On July 18, {{the pilot}} of Alva Cape {{at the time of}} the {{collision}}, Donald Baker, was charged by the Coast Guard with negligence; Baker disputed the charge, having testified that Texaco Massachusetts had caused the collision when she changed course unexpectedly. Previous testimony by Texaco Massachusetts crewmembers indicated that the tanker had been in the process of turning when she collided with Alva cape, although accounts differed as to whether she had been turning to port or starboard. [...] Baker was charged with four counts of negligence, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> used caution in navigation, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> yielded to another ship, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> reduced speed when approaching another ship, and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> sounded a danger signal. His hearing was adjourned until September to allow time to prepare a defense. On September 12, eight further charges of negligence relating to Bakers actions after the collision were brought, and his hearing was therefore delayed again until the end of September.|$|R
