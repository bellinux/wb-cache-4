5|$|Multiple {{repetitive}} dives. The US Navy <b>tables</b> <b>were</b> {{designed for}} a single repetitive dive, and there were concerns {{about the safety of}} extending their use to multiple repetitive dives. As an attempt to address this issue, some <b>tables</b> <b>were</b> modified to reduce the allowable bottom time for repetitive dives.|$|E
5|$|The 1990 DCIEM sport diving <b>tables</b> <b>were</b> {{based on}} fitting {{experimental}} data, {{rather than a}} physiological model, and the 1990 French Navy Marine Nationale 90 (MN90) decompression <b>tables</b> <b>were</b> a development of the earlier Haldanean model of the MN65 tables.|$|E
5|$|D. E. Yount and D. C. Hoffman {{proposed}} a bubble model in 1986, and the BSAC'88 <b>tables</b> <b>were</b> based on Hennessy's bubble model.|$|E

5000|$|Changes in {{the current}} <b>tables</b> <b>are</b> not required, because log data of any <b>table</b> <b>is</b> stored in a {{different}} one.|$|R
50|$|A <b>table</b> <b>is</b> a {{homogeneous}} collection of records, where each record {{has the same}} set of columns. Each <b>table</b> <b>is</b> identified by a table name, whose scope is local to the database in which the <b>table</b> <b>is</b> contained. The amount of disk space allocated to a table within a database is determined by a parameter given when the <b>table</b> <b>is</b> created with the CreateTable operation. Tables grow automatically in response to data creation.|$|R
5|$|The RDP <b>tables</b> <b>were</b> {{developed}} for no-stop diving, but recommend a safety stop at 15fsw for 3 minutes. Emergency decompression for dives which inadvertently exceed the no-stop limit is specified.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. Navy 1956 <b>tables</b> <b>were</b> {{soon found}} to be {{problematic}} for dives deeper than 100fsw for longer than 2 to 4 hours.|$|E
5|$|The first NAUI <b>tables</b> <b>were</b> {{based on}} reformatted but {{otherwise}} unmodified US Navy 1956 tables and issued {{in the early}} 1980s.|$|E
5000|$|The {{format of}} HTML <b>Tables</b> <b>was</b> {{proposed}} in the HTML 3.0 Drafts and the later RFC 1942 HTML <b>Tables.</b> They <b>were</b> inspired by the CALS Table Model.

5000|$|The King’s <b>Table</b> <b>was</b> {{a carved}} stone <b>table</b> that <b>was</b> {{a symbol of}} royal power in England. The <b>table</b> <b>was</b> used by monarchs from the 13th century onward for {{coronation}} feasts and state banquets.|$|R
5000|$|The {{relation}} of the central table {{to those in the}} dimension <b>tables</b> <b>is</b> one-to-many or in some cases many-to-many rather than many-to-one; the primary keys of the central <b>table</b> <b>are</b> the foreign keys in dimension tables, and the main <b>tables</b> <b>are</b> in general, smaller than the dimension tables.|$|R
5|$|These <b>tables</b> <b>were</b> {{based on}} the 1956 US Navy tables and the no-decompression limits {{recommended}} by Bruce Bassett.|$|E
5|$|These <b>tables</b> <b>were</b> {{developed}} by Tom Hennessy {{to replace the}} RNPL/BSAC tables when the Club wanted a set of tables which could approach the versatility of a dive computer.|$|E

5|$|During the 1930s, Hawkins, Schilling and Hansen {{conducted}} extensive experimental dives {{to determine}} allowable supersaturation ratios for different tissue compartments for Haldanean model, Albert R.

5|$|The German <b>tables</b> <b>were</b> {{developed}} by Dr. Max Hahn using a derivative of the Bühlmann ZH-L16 model using half-times ranging from 2.65 to 635 minutes. Three sets were published for altitude ranges 0–200m, 201–700m, and 701-1,200m. The repetitive group designators {{are based on}} the 80-minute compartment.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea of an}} {{associative}} array {{that allows}} data to be accessed by its value rather than by its address {{dates back to the}} mid-1940s in the work of Konrad Zuse and Vannevar Bush, but hash <b>tables</b> <b>were</b> not described until 1953, in an IBM memorandum by Hans Peter Luhn. Luhn used a different collision resolution method, chaining, rather than linear probing.|$|E

Picnic <b>tables</b> can <b>be</b> found {{outdoors}} in many public parks, residential back yards, rest areas, campgrounds, amusement parks, {{and many other}} places. Picnic <b>tables</b> <b>are</b> also used indoors when it is desired to have attached seating to <b>tables.</b> This <b>is</b> most common in school cafeterias, community centers, and employee break rooms. Each table usually seats from six to eight people, though smaller and larger capacity <b>tables</b> <b>are</b> available.|$|R

5|$|The <b>tables</b> <b>were</b> {{adopted by}} the Royal Navy in 1908. The Haldane tables of 1906 are {{considered}} to be the first true set of decompression tables, and the basic concept of parallel tissue compartments with half-times and critical supersaturation limits are still in use in several later decompression models, algorithms, tables and decompression computers.|$|E
5|$|Yarbrough's 1937 <b>tables</b> <b>were</b> {{based on}} a Haldanean 3 {{compartment}} model with compartment half-times of 20, 40 and 70 minutes. Ascent rate was chosen to be 25ft per minute, which was a convenient rate to pull up a diver in standard dress.|$|E
5|$|Crabtree’s {{observations}} {{had convinced}} him that, despite their errors, Kepler’s Rudolphine <b>Tables</b> <b>were</b> {{superior to the}} commonly used Lansberg's tables, and {{he became one of}} the first converts to Kepler’s new astronomy. By 1637, he had convinced Horrocks of the superiority of the Keplerian system, and, using their own planetary observations, both men made many corrections to Kepler's tables, which Crabtree converted to decimal form.|$|E
