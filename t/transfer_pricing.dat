30|$|There {{are three}} classes of <b>transfer</b> <b>prices,</b> which are {{commonly}} observed in organizations. These are market-based <b>transfer</b> <b>prices,</b> cost-based <b>transfer</b> <b>prices,</b> and hybrid <b>transfer</b> <b>prices.</b> The market-based <b>transfer</b> <b>prices</b> are {{as the name}} suggests based on the market prices. Thus, such prices use existing markets of similar products to determine the prices, which adjust the performance measure for both the receiving and delivering unit. Now the firm is an organization, where markets as well as market prices do not exist. When no proxy for a market price exists, the firm might turn to using a cost statistic for a <b>transfer</b> <b>price.</b> Finally, firms might {{use a combination of}} market and cost information as basis for the <b>transfer</b> <b>price.</b> Such prices are named hybrid prices.|$|R

Many intra-firm {{transactions}} are non-market transactions and therefore lack a market determined <b>price.</b> A <b>transfer</b> <b>price</b> {{is the price}} assigned to such nonmarket intra-firm <b>transfers.</b> <b>Transfer</b> <b>prices</b> are especially important for multinational corporations, since a parent company typically has subsidiaries or branches in other countries and transfers are often made between the component parts of the multinational. As the world has become more internationally dependent, these transactions and the associated <b>transfer</b> <b>prices</b> have come under increased scrutiny. The fear often expressed by governments is that a multinational corporation may manipulate <b>transfer</b> <b>prices</b> in order to transfer profits {{from one country to}} another, and thereby affect various government policies. Most notably, <b>transfer</b> <b>prices</b> can affect the tax revenues of both the home and host country. A general international consensus is that the appropriate <b>transfer</b> <b>price</b> is the 'arm's length' price. This is the price that would be charged by two unrelated parties.

40|$|In {{the actual}} {{economical}} context, the <b>transfer</b> <b>prices</b> {{are a major}} preoccupation for both multinationals and fiscal authorities. Because nowadays almost 60 % from the world wide commerce is represented by transactions between multinationals, the national fiscal authorities are very careful when {{taking into account the}} tax levels paid by these companies in each jurisdiction the scope being avoiding the artificial profit transfer though transactions between affiliated persons. National fiscal authorities are {{trying to make sure that}} companies are respecting in intra-group transactions the Arm’s Length Principle as defined by OECD. In this context, the multinationals have to prove that the <b>transfer</b> <b>prices</b> used in transactions are reflecting the market prices. From the taxpayer point of view the <b>transfer</b> <b>prices</b> are a major preoccupation for multinationals both for avoiding fiscal risks (double taxation risk) and for fiscal planning (in order to avoid a fiscal adjustment for prices used in transactions).

30|$|The {{price at}} which goods and {{services}} are transferred internally within a firm can influence the allocation of taxable profits between firm divisions located in different tax jurisdictions. This is particularly true if the firm uses one set of books, that is, it applies the same price {{for the purpose of}} internal coordination and external taxation. In such a situation, diverging tax rates can distort <b>transfer</b> <b>prices</b> as firms have an incentive to shift profits from high-tax to low-tax jurisdictions. 22 This effect persists in the presence of agency conflicts between firm owner(s) and division manager(s). 23 For instance, Li and Balachandran (1996) show that corporate taxes remain a determining factor in the computation of <b>transfer</b> <b>prices</b> that are charged by the headquarters to their foreign divisions where each division manager has private information regarding marginal production costs, and is compensated based upon division profit. Despite the direct impact of <b>transfer</b> <b>prices</b> on the divisions’ taxable profits, the firm will not shift all profits to the low-tax jurisdiction. This is due to the implementation of a mechanism that ensures that each division manager reveals the true costs to the headquarters, and therefore constrains the possible range of <b>transfer</b> <b>prices.</b> Similarly, Choi and Day (1998) show that incentive contracts for divisional managers that solely depend on the managed division’s profit may prevent the realization of the optimal tax minimizing <b>transfer</b> <b>price</b> if changes to the <b>transfer</b> <b>price</b> influence the allocation of risk between divisions. Instead, compensating managers based on the performance of every division disentangles tax minimization from risk sharing and allows for the implementation of <b>transfer</b> <b>prices</b> that induce the maximum permissible amount of profit shifting.|$|R
30|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the potential of}} one-step <b>transfer</b> <b>prices</b> based on either variable or full costs for coordinating decentralized production and quality-improving investment decisions. <b>Transfer</b> <b>prices</b> based on variable costs fail to induce investments on the upstream stage. In contrast, <b>transfer</b> <b>prices</b> based on full costs provide strong investment incentives for the upstream divisions. However, they fail to coordinate the investment decisions. We show that negotiations prevent such coordination failure. In particular, {{we find that the}} firm benefits from a higher degree of decentralization so that total profit increases in the number of parameters being subject to negotiations.|$|R
