In the video, the actresses note that Olivia Pope, Annalise Keating and Meredith Grey are “brilliant” and “complex” women who fight for justice and give voice to the voiceless. Rhimes, Davis, Pompeo, and Washington each take turns speaking as they praise the presidential candidate and conclude: [...] "Our characters are on television, the real world has Hillary Clinton." [...] Clinton responded to the video with a tweet saying, “Talk about a power lineup. <b>Thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>being</b> on this team!" ...|$|E

She wouldn’t like it if I didn’t sometimes stay with people; she always wanted us to stay at other houses. And she knows all about you, Mrs. Lemon, and she likes you immensely. She sent you a message {{the other day and}} I’m afraid I forgot to give it you—to <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>being</b> so kind to me and taking such a lot of trouble. Really she did, but I forgot it. If she wants me to see as much as possible of America it’s much better I should be here than always with Barb—it’s much less like one’s own country. I mean it’s much nicer—for a girl,” said Lady Agatha affectionately to Mrs. Lemon, who began also to look at Jackson under the influence of this uttered sweetness which was like some quaint little old air, she thought, played upon a faded spinet with two girlish fingers.|$|E

6000|$|All {{eyes were}} {{immediately}} fixed on Vivian, and {{the faces of}} the Classics were triumphant with smiles; those of the manager's particular friends, the Romantics, we may call them, were clouded; but who shall describe the countenance of Mallett? In a moment the school broke up with an agitated and tumultuous uproar. [...] "No stranger!" [...] shouted St. Leger Smith; [...] "no stranger!" [...] vociferated a prepared gang. Vivian's friends were silent, for they hesitated to accept for their leader the insulting title. Those who were neither Vivian's friends nor in the secret, weak creatures who side always with the strongest, immediately swelled the insulting chorus of Mr. St. Leger Smith. That worthy, emboldened by his success and the smiles of Mallett, contained himself no longer: [...] "Down with the manager!" [...] he cried. His satellites chorussed. But now Vivian rushed forward. [...] "Mr. Smith, I <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>being</b> so definite; take that!" [...] and he struck Smith with such force that the Cleon staggered and fell; but Smith instantly recovered, and a ring was instantly formed. To a common observer, the combatants were unequally matched; for Smith was a burly, big-limbed animal, alike superior to Grey in years and strength. But Vivian, though delicate in frame and more youthful, was full his match in spirit, and, thanks to being a Cockney! ten times his match in science. He had not built a white great coat or drunk blue ruin at Ben Burn's for nothing! ...|$|E
