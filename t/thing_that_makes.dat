25|$|As mentioned, {{imperfect}} {{information in}} a leadership game reduces to Cournot competition. However, some Cournot strategy profiles are sustained as Nash equilibria but can be eliminated as incredible threats (as described above) by applying the solution concept of subgame perfection.

25|$|Act One {{told the}} story of DNA as a <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> human {{different}} and understand each other, Act two {{told the story}} of how children use their dream to imagine, Act three {{told the story of}} how Youths use dream to express themselves, Act four told the story of how family support become an inspiration for athletes and coaches to achieve success in sports. While Act 5, the conclusion told the story of how Singaporean athletes welcome, make friends and unite with the athletes other country of Southeast Asia regardless of language, race and belief. Soon after the last act, the torch of the Games was carried into the stadium from a dragon boat across the Kallang basin by several Singapore’s former and current generation of sportsmen and sportswomen. The current sportsmen are Clement Teo of Dragon Boat, Liang Xiaoyu of Badminton, Muhammad Naqib Asmin of Athletics, Gabriel Yang of Judo, Dinah Chan of Cycling, Enrico Marican of Hockey, Shanti Pereira of Athletics, Derek Wong Zi Liang of Badminton, while the former sportsmen are Annabel Pennefather of Hockey, Prema Govindran of Athletics and Wong Shoon Keat of Badminton. The cauldron was lit by former football sportsman, Fandi Ahmad and his son and current football sportsman, Irfan Fandi. The cauldron’s design was inspired by the DNA which represents the unity of nations, communities and individuals of Southeast Asia. It is made of stainless steel, 19.2-metre-high and has a LED screen on it that displays information such as the time and weather during the Games. It also has a burner that able to project a 1.5m- to 4m-high flame and 11 bars within the structure that represent the different countries participating at the Games. A colourful fireworks display then erupted over the skyline surrounding the National Stadium, signalling the official commencement of the Games. The ceremony concludes with the President leaving the stadium.|$|E

They took the approach {{that they were in}} a band together and purposely studied teams to discover why they break up. Kurtzman later explained in 2009 that [...] "One big <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> the wheels start to wobble is when someone feels that the contribution isn't 50-50.

500|$|Based on six reviews,Truth Serum {{received}} an average score of 3.2/5.0 on website Kritiker, which assigns a normalised rating out of 5.0 to reviews from mainstream critics across Sweden.

Peter Carlsson of Allehanda called it a strong debut but stated that it did not help Lo to stand out from other pop artists. Svenska Dagbladets Sara-Märta Höglund compared the EP to Katy Perry's Prism (2013) and stated that, [...] "though Lo knows how to make a hit, I have wished she had ventured out on a more stripped-down production and dropped the tiresome drug romanticism".|$|E

500|$|In a {{retrospective}} of the Ninja Gaiden series, Eurogamer said that Ninja GaidenIII {{was the only}} game in the NES trilogy not to make it to Europe. They made similar criticisms about the difficulty level, saying that the North American version was made more difficult than the Japanese version by utilizing limited continues, making the enemies much more powerful, and removing the password system present in the Japanese version. They said the story was too outlandish, calling the plot, of which a short-lived anime Ninja Gaiden series would loosely be based, [...] "a glorious load of old bollocks". While the version from Ninja Gaiden Trilogy for the Super NES remedied most of their criticisms, they said that the game added new frustrations which included slower framerates, lower-quality controls, and the omission and shuffling around of several tracks, which they said [...] "is precisely the sort of <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> die-hard videogame fans apoplectic with rage".|$|E
500|$|The American Broadcasting Company (ABC) {{characterized}} Robbins as [...] "confident", [...] "ambitious", and [...] "cheerful". Shortly {{after her}} {{arrival in the}} show, Robbins became a love-interest for Torres (Ramirez). The {{relationship between the two}} is referred to by fans by the portmanteau [...] "Calzona". Torres' previous girlfriend Erica Hahn (Brooke Smith) was written out of Grey's Anatomy in 2008, {{due to a lack of}} chemistry between the characters. Rhimes praised the chemistry between Robbins and Torres in contrast, comparing it to that between the show's primary couple Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) and Shepherd (Dempsey), and stating: [...] "They have that little <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> you want to watch them." [...] Rhimes named the addition of Capshaw to the cast as one of the elements of the season she was most proud of, commenting that she wished she could have found Callie a love interest that [...] "sparkled" [...] sooner, but was pleased with eventually having found one in Robbins.|$|E
500|$|However, Disney {{found that}} the new Pinocchio was too {{helpless}} and was far too often led astray by deceiving characters. Therefore, {{in the summer of}} 1938 Disney and his story team established the character of the cricket. Originally the cricket was only a minor character that Pinocchio killed by squashing him with a mallet and that later returned as a ghost. Disney dubbed the cricket Jiminy, and made him into a character that would try to guide Pinocchio into the right decisions. Once the character was expanded, he was depicted as a realistic cricket with toothed legs and waving antennae, but Disney wanted something more likable. Ward Kimball had spent several months animating a [...] "Soup Eating Sequence" [...] in Snow White, which was cut from the film due to pacing reasons. Kimball was about to quit until Disney rewarded him for his work by promoting him to the supervising animator of Jiminy Cricket. Kimball conjured up the design for Jiminy Cricket, whom he described as a little man with an egg head and no ears. [...] "The only <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> him a cricket is because we call him one," [...] Kimball later joked.|$|E

500|$|Several reviewers praised Super Punch-Out!! overall for {{not trying}} to be realistic, for the {{originality}} of its different opponents, and for its simple controls. Chris Scullion from Official Nintendo Magazine praises the game for its outlandish characters, addictive gameplay, and simple controls. He adds that Super Punch-Out!! is [...] "superb way to prepare for the upcoming Wii [...] title". Scullion states that [...] "the <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> Super Punch-Out!! interesting (along {{with the rest of the}} games in the series) is that it's not a realistic boxing game". He adds that the opponents in the game are [...] "the real stars of the show", with each opponent having a unique personality, traits, and boxing styles. Skyler Miller from Allgame, like Scullion, praised the game for its simple, responsive controls, for its colorful, detailed opponents, and for its usage of the Super NES's transparent color palette for the fighter, which facilitates the [...] "behind the back" [...] perspective. He also appreciates the game's sound and music, in particular the usage of real voice for the announcer. Game Players magazine applauded the game's [...] "large, colorful graphics and easy-to-learn controls".|$|E
500|$|Lotus {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 56, based on 12 reviews. Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe called it [...] "a good {{start in the}} effort to refocus attention on Aguilera's skills", but observed [...] "several tracks that sound mindlessly repetitive as sedentary listening experiences". Q called it [...] "generic" [...] and felt that [...] "nothing really stands out". Annie Zaleski of The A.V. Club felt that the album [...] "often plays it safe" [...] and accused Aguilera of [...] "dumbing down her voice or lyrics for the sake of lightweight tunes or prevailing trends." [...] Melissa Maerz of Entertainment Weekly found the album's [...] "self-empowerment anthems ... as contradictory as they are unoriginal" [...] and criticized its production for [...] "digitally smother" [...] Aguilera's vocals and [...] "draining all the emotion". Slant Magazine's Sal Cinquemani asserted that because it is [...] "Aguilera's shortest album since her debut, it boasts less filler, but also fewer obvious standouts." [...] Jon Caramanica of The New York Times felt that the album's conventional direction is [...] "its biggest crime, more than its musical unadventurousness or its emphasis on bland self-help lyrics or its reluctance to lean on [...] Aguilera's voice, the <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> her special". Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone dismissed it as a [...] "vitriol-tsunami of a record".|$|E
