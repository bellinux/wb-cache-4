25|$|A women's shelter, Sojourn, {{received}} a call from Brown four days prior to the murders; she said that she was afraid of her ex-husband, whom she believed was stalking her. The prosecution did not present this information in court because they thought that Judge Ito would rule the evidence to be hearsay. In addition, friends and family indicated that Brown had consistently said that Simpson had been stalking her. She claimed that everywhere she went, she noticed Simpson would be <b>there,</b> <b>watching</b> her. Her friends Faye Resnick and Cynthia Shahian said she was afraid because Simpson had told her he would kill her if he ever found her with another man.|$|E
500|$|... "The She", {{named after}} a nightclub that the Deals' brother used to visit, has been {{described}} as having a funky feel, with a start-and-stop rhythm of bass and drums. Bryant found the track's keyboard part reminiscent of Stereolab's music, while AllMusic's Heather Phares likened the entire song to Jefferson Airplane's [...] "White Rabbit". Cibula mentioned that the [...] "creepy/cool ... sound [...] the characteristic Kim Deal familiar/strange lyrics: 'Sorrow blowin' through the vents / I'm over Houston / You're over the night we met.'" [...] Kim Deal plays every instrument on [...] "Too Alive" [...] and both sisters sing. Moores noted the track's buoyant feel and the steady strumming style of Deal's guitar. To Phares, the song possesses an immediacy as though the listener were <b>there</b> <b>watching</b> the performance in person.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Illegal" [...] {{was shot in}} Mexico City on 17 October 2006, during a short break in the {{schedule}} of the Oral Fixation Tour, between concerts in Mexico and Guatemala. Jaume de Laiguana and Shakira were the co-directors of the video. The filming took a full day, and some American and Mexican fans were invited over as extras. It officially premiered on 16 November 2006 on MTV's Total Request Live (TRL). The video features Shakira as the girlfriend of a boxer. Throughout most of the video, she {{is shown in the}} empty boxing venue where her former boyfriend boxes. Through flashbacks, she remembers the good times in their relationship - including being alone in the ring, affectionately treating each other. At the end of the video, the reason behind their break-up is shown. Shakira comes to see her boyfriend boxing in the championship match where he wins, unaware that Shakira is <b>there</b> <b>watching</b> him. Another girl steps in the ring and kisses the boxer, revealing to Shakira he is cheating on her. Her boyfriend, to his shock, finally sees that Shakira is watching him kiss the other girl. The video ends with her looking back at him, clearly hurt, before turning away and leaving.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} {{consists}} of a simplistic concept [...] a One Direction recording session. In a November 2012 interview with MTV News, Arnell {{said he did not}} want to make it about anything more than that, [...] "When I first heard the track, the mix on it was so simple and so pure and you could hear all the qualities of the voices on the track, I just wanted to come up with something that when the viewer watched it, it was almost like sitting there listening to the boys sing the track." [...] Arnell subsequently developed the idea of a recording studio setting, thinking that it was [...] "the most pure way to do it". He wanted to make the music video as [...] "uncontrived as possible" [...] without [...] "any other bullsh-- or effects in the way of it." [...] While Arnell conceded that music video may seem like a simple concept, the shoot itself took over twelve hours to complete and said that it was [...] "one of the hardest things I've ever done." [...] The group performed it [...] "over and over again because I was just trying to get different shots, different angles, different qualities." [...] As for the decision to shoot the video in black-and-white, Arnell felt it best captured the essence of the ballad. He also noted that was his intention to give the music video the feeling as if One Direction are singing it right to you, [...] "It's purely about the clarity of it. When you sit <b>there</b> <b>watching</b> it, it's almost like these little bits of eye contact [...] you really feel like the guys are singing it to you." ...|$|E
2500|$|On December 4, 1956, Elvis Presley {{dropped in}} on Phillips {{to pay a}} social visit while Perkins was in the studio cutting new tracks with Lewis backing him on piano. Johnny Cash was also <b>there</b> <b>watching</b> Perkins. The four then started an impromptu jam session, and Phillips left the tape running. These recordings, almost half of which were gospel songs, have been {{released}} on CD as Million Dollar Quartet. Tracks also include Elvis Presley's [...] "Don't Be Cruel" [...] and [...] "Paralyzed", Chuck Berry's [...] "Brown Eyed Handsome Man", Pat Boone's [...] "Don't Forbid Me" [...] and Presley doing an impersonation of Jackie Wilson (who was then with Billy Ward and the Dominoes) on [...] "Don't Be Cruel".|$|E
2500|$|As a detective, Seedman {{was known}} for his unorthodox {{approaches}} that solved otherwise perplexing cases. [...] "I try to imagine who was in a room the second before the murder," [...] he recalled years later. In one case early in his career, a Bronx woman was found dead of a shotgun blast in the lobby of her apartment building. Seedman noticed an empty chair next to the building's stoop. Neighbors told him it was usually occupied by a man who sat <b>there</b> <b>watching</b> the traffic go by. Although he normally was out shopping at the time, Seedman insisted on entering the man's apartment through a window—where he found his body hanging from a pipe. The murder-suicide had occurred after the woman rejected him.|$|E

2500|$|In 2000, Knopfler {{appeared}} on Parkinson on BBC One and explained again where the lyrics originated. According to Knopfler, {{he was in}} New York and stopped by an appliance store. At {{the back of the}} store, they had a wall of TVs which were all tuned to MTV. Knopfler said there was a man working there dressed in a baseball cap, work boots, and a checkered shirt delivering boxes who was standing next to him watching. As they were standing <b>there</b> <b>watching</b> MTV, Knopfler remembers the man coming up with lines such as [...] "what are those, Hawaiian noises?...that ain't workin'," [...] etc. Knopfler asked for a pen to write some of these lines down and then eventually put those words to music.|$|E
2500|$|Canepa {{was born}} in 1916 in San Pedro de Macorís in the Dominican Republic. His initial artistic studies were in his native country. After {{participating}} in the political movement against the Trujillo dictatorship his existence in the Dominican Republic became precarious, and he left for New York in 1935, settling there permanently in 1937 when he accepted {{a position in the}} New York Siqueiros workshop on 13th Street. [...] There he worked under Roberto Berdecio on a number of murals, while attending class at the Art Students League. [...] Exile intensified his childhood memories, which were colored by his maternal family’s progressive republican and anti-colonial traditions. Two of his maternal ancestors had been presidents of the Dominican Republic: Manuel Jimenes (presidency 1848-1849), a product of the Enlightenment and abolitionism, and Juan Isidro Jimenes Pereyra (presidency 1902-1916). In addition, Canepa's art reflected his paternal Genovese family’s seafaring history and his father’s extravagant construction of a small opera theater in San Pedro de Macorís, the Teatro Colón. It was <b>there,</b> <b>watching</b> the Spanish painter Enrique Tarazona at work, that Canepa gained “the sweeping confidence and bold absorption of historical styles that characterizes much" [...] of his painting, “absorbing his catechism of old masters at such an early age that it became a digested part of his work.” ...|$|E
