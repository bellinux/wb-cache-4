This paper describes the relevant principles and methods, the basic structure–property relationships in terms of mesogenic properties of the monomers, and the mechanical and optical properties of the polymers. Strategies are discussed to control the molecular orientation by various means and in all three dimensions. The versatility of the process is demonstrated by two examples of films with a patterned molecular order.

A <b>transflective</b> <b>display</b> is a liquid crystal display that operates in both a reflective mode using ambient light and a transmissive mode with light coming from a backlight system. Furthermore, a method is discussed to create a patterned film in a single polymerization process.

40|$|Transflective {{liquid crystal}} display (LCD) is {{required}} for mobile and portable applications, because of their superior performance in both indoor and outdoor environment. Transflective LCD is developed based on the conventional transmissive and reflective LCD by combining their characteristics together. For common transflective LCD, the pixels are separated into the transmissive and reflective sub-pixels. The transmissive sub-pixels in a <b>transflective</b> <b>display</b> are transmitting with backlight illumination and the reflective sub-pixels are reflecting light from the environment under ambient illumination. Commercialized conventional transflective LCDs are mostly fabricated by double cell gap approach, which show good performance and well matched optical performance of both transmissive and reflective parts. However; on the other hand, the fabrication process is very complicated, which makes the products expensive. For mobile and portable applications, cheap transflective LCDs are in great need. So people put effort on single cell gap approach to make the display with good performance and matched Transmittance versus Voltage Curve (TVC) and Reflectance versus Voltage Curve (RVC). In this thesis, several new configurations of transflective LCD with single cell gap approach are proposed. Two general types of transflective LCD are proposed. Firstly, the dual mode single cell gap transflective configurations. Secondly, the single mode single cell gap transflective configurations with patterned retardation films. Photoalignment technology has been studied and {{is used in the}} fabrication of the single cell gap transflective LCD configurations. By photoalignment technology, we can easily produce different alignment domains on the same alignment layer; also, we can produce patterned retardation films with domain alignment...|$|E
40|$|A novel LCD {{technology}} yields {{both high}} reflection and transmission. Mobile display {{devices such as}} portable media players, satellite navigators, and laptop computers demand good readability in both indoor and outdoor settings. These stringent constraints make transflective LCDs (displays that are readable under both bright sunlight and low-light situations) a promising technol-ogy. In transflective LCDs, each pixel {{is divided into two}} parts, one transmissive and the other reflective. The limited suitability of LCDs due to their narrow viewing angles can be overcome by introducing in-plane (IPS) and fringe-field horizontal switch-ing (FFS) modes. However, manufacturing horizontal-mode-switching LCDs requires complicated and expensive fabrication processes. 1, 2 Transflective LCDs operating in a single mode and manufac-turedwith a so-called single-cell-gap structure are very desirable to reduce production costs. But they require in-cell retardation layers to prevent image inversion between the reflective and transmissive modes. 1, 2 Moreover, these retarders, too, have a number of significant problems, including increased operating voltage and unreliability of the materials used for their fabrica-tion. A new optical configuration for a transflective IPS LCDwas recently reported, 3 which employs a twisted-nematic liquid-crystal (TNLC) cell with a single-cell-gap structure and without in-cell retarders. Although the transmissive-mode viewing angle performance is significantly improved, the resulting reflective-mode display capability is poor, and both modes exhibit differ-ent electro-optic characteristics. Here, we propose an optical TNLC cell design for a single-cell-gap <b>transflective</b> <b>display</b> in FFS mode (see Figure 1). A system-atic manufacturing procedure simultaneously achieves optimal display performance of both reflection and transmission. The wavelength dispersion of the TNLC cell is suppressed effectively by introducing a half-wave plate (HWP), the best condition...|$|E
40|$|Transflective {{liquid crystal}} {{displays}} (LCDs) combine {{the characteristics of}} transmissive LCDs and reflective LCDs. The pixels of the transflective LCDs are separated into the transmissive and reflective sub-pixels. The transmissive sub-pixels in a <b>transflective</b> <b>display</b> are transmitting with backlight illumination and the reflective sub-pixels are reflecting light from the environment under ambient illumination. Conventional transflective LCDs are commonly fabricated using a double cell gap approach to maintain the same optical characteristics with increasing the voltage. In the double cell gap approach, the cell gap for transmissive mode is doubled to that for the reflective mode. So that, both reflective and transmissive mode has the same optical path difference. But on the other hand, the fabrication {{would be much more}} complicated. In a single cell gap approach matching the transmittance versus voltage curve (TVC) with the reflectance versus voltage curve (RVC), different LC modes in the transmissive and the reflective sub-pixels have been suggested recently. In this thesis, several new configurations of transflective LCD with single cell gap approach are proposed. Three general types of transflective are proposed. Firstly, the transflective configuration using double cell gap approach and patterned retardation film, which are currently using throughout the transflective market. Secondly, the multimode transflective configurations with different electro-optical mode in the transmissive and reflective part. The alignment domains in pixels could be realized by a photo-alignment technique. Lastly, the transflective liquid crystal display without sub-pixel separation. The pixel of the transflective LCD does not separate into the transmissive and reflective region. The pixels are partially transmissive and reflective {{with the help of a}} semi transparent mirror...|$|E
40|$|We {{developed}} {{a simple and}} versatile imprinting technique {{in combination with the}} exposure of ultraviolet light to fabricate several patterned optical wave plates using a polymerizable liquid crystalline (PLC) material. One of such patterned PLC films, produced by imprinting, can be used as both an in-cell retarder and 10 an alignment layer for liquid crystal (LC) display applications. The chain ordering of the PLC molecules produced during imprinting results in anisotropic surface forces to align the LC molecules on the patterned PLC film without any surface treatment. A <b>transflective</b> LC <b>display</b> adopting an imprinted PLC film as an in-cell patterned retarder is demonstrated in a twisted nematic geometry. 15 Keywords: imprinting technique; in-cell patterned retarder; liquid crystal (LC); polymerizable liquid crystalline (PLC) material; <b>transflective</b> LC <b>display</b> (LCD) 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{contribution}} of flexoelectric polarization to the dielectric susceptibility in helicoidal liquid crystals is formulated for the static equilibrium case, and {{further in the}} case of a time-varying field. A dispersion of the dielectric permittivity due to the frequency response of flexoelectric switching is described.

It is further demonstrated how relaxation of the flexoelectric contribution to the dielectric tensor in this special case can be exploited to switch between states in cholesteric liquid crystal structures by altering the applied time-dependent field amplitude, if Δε -Δεε(0).
