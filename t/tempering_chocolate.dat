50|$|Tempering: <b>Tempering</b> <b>chocolate</b> is a heat {{treatment}} method performed on chocolate involving {{heating and cooling}} the chocolate to result in desired characteristics like shininess of the chocolate or 'snap', the way it breaks. A chocolatier must know how to temper chocolate properly for different applications or temper for chocolate for desired characteristics. Chocolate contains cocoa butter which crystallizes during the {{heat treatment}} of melting and <b>tempering</b> <b>chocolate.</b> The crystal formation in chocolate can affect many different attributes to the chocolate - mouthfeel, snap of the chocolate, the color, dull or shiny. Heating the chocolate at certain temperatures, around 86-90 °F (30-32 °C), for specific periods of time and then cooling the chocolate and working with, in alternating segments {{is referred to as}} tempering. There are machines that can temper chocolate for you, but many chocolatiers use marble slabs and hand-tools to cool the chocolate and work with it.|$|E

25|$|<b>Chocolate</b> <b>tempering</b> {{machines}} (or temperers) {{with computer}} controls {{can be used}} for producing consistently <b>tempered</b> <b>chocolate.</b> In particular continuous tempering machines are used in large volume applications. Various methods and apparatuses for continuous flow tempering have been described by Aasted, Sollich and Buhler, three manufacturers of commercial chocolate equipment, with a focus now on energy efficiency. In general, molten chocolate coming in at 40–50°C is cooled in heat exchangers to crystallization temperates of about 26–30°C, passed through a tempering column consisting of spinning plates to induce shear, then warmed slightly to re-melt undesirable crystal formations.|$|R
5000|$|Cocoa butter must be {{tempered}} {{to maintain}} gloss and coating. A baker <b>tempers</b> <b>chocolate</b> by cooling the chocolate mass below its setting point, then rewarming the chocolate to between 31 and 32 C for milk chocolate, or between 32 and 33 C for semi-sweet chocolate. Compound coatings, however, {{do not need}} to be tempered. Instead, they are simply warmed to between [...] above the coating's melting point.|$|R
50|$|The last {{stage is}} tempering, {{which refers to}} the precise raising, lowering, and raising of the {{temperature}} of liquid <b>chocolate.</b> The <b>tempering</b> machine heats and cools the chocolate to create a specific crystal structure, ensuring that the chocolate has a higher melting point. The <b>tempered</b> <b>chocolate</b> is pumped into depositors which doses it into moulds. These are then placed onto a vibratory table to evenly distribute the chocolate, remove air bubbles, and be conveyed to a cooling room to solidify.|$|R
40|$|Composition in dark {{chocolate}} was varied {{and the effects}} determined on microstructure, using light microscopy, and mechanical properties of molten and <b>tempered</b> <b>chocolates,</b> using a TA. HD Plus Texture Analyser. Compositional parameters were particle size distribution (PSD) (D 90 of 18, 25, 35 and 50 μm), fat (25 %, 30 % and 35 %) and lecithin (0. 3 % and 0. 5 %) contents. Micrographs revealed wide variations in sugar crystalline network structure and inter-particle interaction strengths related to PSD and fat level. Samples containing 25 % fat had more crystal agglomerates, well flocculated with greater particle-to-particle interaction strengths than those with higher (30 % and 35 %) fat contents. Increasing the D 90 to 35 - 50 μm caused broadening of the PSD, with particles becoming coarser, which were similar at all fat levels. Mechanical analysis showed that PSD, fat and lecithin content significantly influenced firmness of molten chocolate and hardness of solid (<b>tempered)</b> <b>chocolate</b> with significant interactions among factors. Particle size was inversely correlated with firmness (1235 - 173 g) and hardness (7062 - 5546 g). Greatest effect of PSD was with 25 % fat and 0. 3 % lecithin. With higher fat and lecithin contents, the PSD influence was reduced. It was concluded that PSD, fat and lecithin contents and their interactions were central to mechanical properties of {{dark chocolate}}s...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the project}} was to {{understand}} the science behind rapid cooling of chocolate used in the Frozen Cone® process. Differential scanning calorimetry was used to study the effect of slow and rapid cooling on <b>tempered</b> <b>chocolate.</b> On rapid cooling, lower melting polymorphs of cocoa butter were generated. Upon heating these recrystallised into the more stable Form V. Results were confirmed by similar observations with <b>tempered</b> <b>chocolate</b> fats. A hypothesis was formed whereby upon rapid cooling, lower melting polymorphs nucleate and grow at the expense of Form V nuclei produced during tempering. Upon subsequent warming, these polymorphs melt and recrystallise into Form V. Rapid cooling on untempered chocolate did not show any recrystallisation during warming; proving that tempering is required for the formation of Form V crystals in the final matrix. These results were confirmed by temperature-controlled X-ray diffraction on cocoa butter and chocolate fats. The polymorph generated upon rapid cooling was identified as Form I. This co-existed and eventually transformed to Form II and Form V upon warming. X-ray results showed that following rapid cooling, Form V crystals created during tempering did not grow until above 5 °C. Direct contact cooling at different temperatures was carried out to mimic the Frozen Cone® process. It was found that above - 15 °C, the adhesion of the sample to the holder increases and seems to be correlated to the presence of Form II. These results suggest that the molecular structure and adhesive property of the polymorphs formed at specific temperatures are important for the release of chocolate. Stepscan differential scanning calorimetry was used to separate the simultaneous melting and recrystallisation events occurring in chocolate following slow and rapid cooling, by deconvoluting the total heat flow into reversing and non-reversing components. The general applicability and limitations of Stepscan DSC are also discussed. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
2500|$|Generally, the {{chocolate}} is first heated to [...] to melt all six forms of crystals. Next, {{the chocolate}} is cooled to about , {{which will allow}} crystal types IV and V to form.

40|$|Central Composite Rotatable Design (CCRD) for K = 2 {{was used}} to study the {{combined}} effects of multi-stage heat exchangers for Stages 1 (14 - 30 °C) and 2 (12 - 28 °C) coolant temperatures at constant Stage 3 coolant and holding temperatures during <b>tempering</b> of dark <b>chocolates</b> using laboratory-scale mini-temperer. Quantitative data on <b>chocolate</b> <b>temper</b> index (slope) were obtained for products with varying particle size distribution (PSD) (D 90 of 18, 25, 35 and 50 μm) and fat (30 % and 35 %) content. Regression models generated using stepwise regression analyses were used to plot response surface curves, to study the tempering behaviour of products. The results showed that both Stage 1 and Stage 2 coolant temperatures had significant linear and quadratic effects on the crystallization behaviour causing wide variations in <b>chocolate</b> <b>temper</b> index during tempering of products with variable PSD and fat content. Differences in fat content exerted the greatest variability in temperature settings of the different zones for attaining well-tempered products. At 35 % fat content, changes in PSD caused only slight and insignificant effect on tempering behaviour. No unique set of conditions was found to achieve good <b>temper</b> in dark <b>chocolate</b> with a specified tempering unit. Thus, different combinations of temperatures could be employed between the multi-stage heat exchangers to induce nucleation and growth of stable fat crystal polymorphs during tempering.

50|$|In cocoa butter, {{there are}} six {{essential}} polymorphic forms. The polymorphic transformation theory {{is based on the}} fact that bloomed chocolates are always found to contain the most stable VI polymorph of cocoa butter. According to this theory, bloom occurs through the uncontrolled polymorphic transformation of cocoa butter from a less stable form (form IV or V) to the most stable form (form VI). The technology of good chocolate production depends on ensuring that only the stable form of the cocoa butter ingredient exists in the final product. In poorly <b>tempered</b> <b>chocolate,</b> form IV will transform to V and eventually form VI, resulting in bloom, while in well-tempered chocolate, form V will transform to form VI and bloom may also occur. Elevated and/or fluctuating temperatures promote the transformation rate and thus also promote the rate of bloom formation. However, it is found that the production of form VI from form V does not always lead to bloom; a direct relationship cannot be established between fat bloom and the evolution of the crystalline forms. The onset of transformation from form V to form VI crystals is not the cause of visual bloom; rather, this transition should be considered as an aspect of cocoa butter recrystallization that may result in bloom.|$|R

Compositional parameters for particle {{size distribution}} were [D 90 (> 90 % finer) of 18 μm, 25 μm, 35 μm and 50 μm], fat (25 %, 30 % and 35 %) and lecithin (0. 3 % and 0. 5 %) contents. Results showed that PSD, fat and lecithin content significantly (P 0. 05) influenced the textural parameters with significant interactions among factors. Particle size was inversely correlated with firmness (1235 - 173 g), consistency (50, 410 - 7029 g s), cohesiveness (1594 - 262 g), index of viscosity (5737 - 1099 g s) and hardness (7062 - 5546 g) with chocolates containing 25 % fat and 0. 3 % lecithin. With higher fat and lecithin contents, PSD influence was reduced. PSD and fat concentration inversely influenced all colour measurements (L*, C* and h°) of samples. High correlations (r = 0. 71 - 1. 00, P < 0. 001) were observed between texture parameters and colour. It was concluded that PSD, fat and lecithin contents and their interactions were central to changes in textural properties and appearance during processing of dark chocolates...|$|R

40|$|Crystallization {{of cocoa}} butter {{in the correct}} {{polymorphic}} form (Form V) leads to a volumetric contraction of <b>tempered</b> <b>chocolate</b> during solidification and aids in the ease of the demoulding process. Specific steps during chocolate bar manufacturing may result in an increased adhesion between chocolate and mould surface causing intermittent problems in demoulding. Adhesion is an important physical phenomenon commonly observed in many food-related situations. With respect to chocolate adhesion {{it is expected that}} the balance of the adhesion force between the chocolate and the mould and the cohesion force within the chocolate itself determines the stickiness at the chocolate-mould interface during demoulding. The research presented investigated the effect of surface thermodynamics and processing conditions on the observed extent of adhesion of (aerated) chocolate to four different mould materials (quartz glass, stainless steel, polycarbonate, and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)). Surface energy of solid mould materials was calculated from experimental surface tension and contact angle data. An experimental set-up build around a Texture Analyser was developed for the experimental surface adhesion force determination, using a simple separation test between the solidified chocolate and a mould probe. Process conditions specific to the moulding and demoulding phases of the commercial chocolate manufacturing process have been investigated using this set-up. Surface energy (thermodynamics) {{has been shown to be}} the major factor controlling the adhesion between chocolate and a mould material. Chocolate-mould adhesion can be minimized if the total surface energy of the mould material is < 30 mN m-l,and the electron donor component 15 mN m- l. High surface energy materials are assumed to produce more compact crystal networks with a resulting increase in crystal-crystal interactions being responsible for difficulties demoulding. Processing parameters had a significant impact on the crystallization and solidification processes, and are therefore regarded as the key determining factors of chocolate-mould interactions. Demoulding can be optimised by pre-heating the mould under controlled environmental conditions (...|$|R
40|$|The <b>tempering</b> of <b>chocolate,</b> i. e. {{the process}} of {{crystallization}} of the desired morph; is a key step in its manufacturing by professional chocolatiers. In this work, {{a model of a}} tempering process based on seeding with solid chocolate grains is developed to enhance understanding and control of the system. The model aims to predict temperature field during melting and crystallization of the product. Therefore a mechanical stirrer is designed to simulate the manual mixing. Resulting flow field is modeled using CFD. Based on simulation results, the heat transfer problem is simplified using an effective thermal conductivity. The parameter value is fitted on experimental results. The heat conduction equation obtained is solved using Comsol Multiphysics. Melting of chocolate particles is added to the model using a sink term having the form of a kinetic reaction whose parameters are identified from an adiabatic melting experiment. The resulting model gives an accurate prediction of the cooling rate and the temperature field within the melted chocolate seeded with small solid grains. info:eu-repo/semantics/nonPublishe...|$|R

40|$|Scraped surface heat {{exchangers}} (SSHEs) {{are widely used}} for crystallization applications in several food processes (i. e. crystallization of margarine, <b>tempering</b> of <b>chocolate,</b> freezing of ice cream and sorbet). The final quality of these food products is highly related to crystal size distribution and apparent viscosity, {{both of which are}} determined by the operating conditions of the process. During the freezing of sorbet, the increase in the ice volume fraction leads to an increase in the apparent viscosity of the product. This effect modifies the fluid flow behavior, the residence time distribution (RTD) and the temperature profile inside the equipment. This work aimed at studying the influence of the operating conditions on the RTD and the axial temperature profile of the product in a SSHE, so as to characterize the product flow behavior. RTD experiments were carried out in a continuous laboratory pilot-scale SSHE by means of a colorimetric method. Experiments showed that high product flow rates led to a narrowing of the RTD and thus to less axial dispersion, due to the enhancement of the radial mixing with the decrease in the apparent viscosity of the product. Spreading of the RTD was obtained for lower refrigerant fluid temperatures, due to a higher radial temperature gradient between the wall and the center of the exchanger, leading to a higher gradient of the apparent viscosity. This effect increased the difference in axial flow velocities and thus the axial dispersion. These results can be useful for the optimization and modelling of crystallization processes in SSHEs.
