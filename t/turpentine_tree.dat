50|$|Black {{flying foxes}} eat pollen and nectar from native eucalyptus, lilypillies, paperbark, and <b>turpentine</b> <b>trees.</b> When native foods are scarce, {{particularly}} during drought, the bats may take introduced or commercial fruits, such as mangos and apples. This species {{had been known}} to travel up to 50 km a night in search of food. In residential areas, the species has adapted to eating introduced Cocos palm trees {{as a substitute for}} scarcer native species - and now accounts for around 30% of the animals' food source. However, the high acidity of the palm fruits can prove toxic and may lead to death.|$|R
5000|$|The word name [...] "mineral" [...] in [...] "mineral spirits" [...] or [...] "mineral turpentine" [...] {{is meant}} to {{distinguish}} it from distilled spirits (distilled directly from fermented grains and fruit) or from true <b>turpentine</b> (distilled <b>tree</b> resin). Its use is a misnomer because white spirit is derived not from minerals but from petroleum, a fossil fuel.|$|R

50|$|The St Ives {{area was}} first {{explored}} by Governor Arthur Phillip and {{a party of}} men in 1788 where {{they set up a}} campsite at Bungaroo which is close to what is now Hunter Avenue. The area produced a small scale timber felling industry. There are still some examples of the thirty metre and higher trees in nearby Pymble in the Dalrymple Hay forest and near Canisius College. Native <b>turpentine</b> <b>trees</b> were also once abundant and provided useful timber for cabinet making. It was once known for its apple orchards but due to residential demand, {{there is no longer any}} commercial fruit growing in the area. During World War II there were significant numbers of troops barracked in the area, which provided the impetus to build Archbold Road as a supplementary and emergency route to the city. Since 1950 the suburb has expanded from the central shopping areas and the arterial main roads to include hilltop and valley areas bordering on the surrounding Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park to the north, now the area known as St Ives Chase, and Garigal National Park to the east and the south east.|$|R
25|$|Amber is fossilized sap {{from tree}} trunks; {{it is used}} for jewelry and may contain ancient animals.

50|$|Prior to British settlement, the {{north-western}} part of {{the present}} park area {{would have been a}} forest of <b>turpentine</b> and ironbark <b>trees,</b> grading down towards the south-eastern area, situated on Botany Sands, which would have been swamp, marsh and heathland associated with the waterway that became known as Shea’s Creek. The woodland area was first cleared by Thomas Smyth, a marine sergeant with the First Fleet, who planted fruit trees and grain crops.|$|R

50|$|The {{breeding}} season {{can be directly}} related to the combined ripening of fruit trees and palms within the rainforest habitat. Forcing to birds to mass flock and congregated at these areas. Nests and eggs have been reported from June to December. Few nests have been observed in the wild. The nest has been described as sometimes flimsy but frequently substantial, built of stout sticks from <b>turpentine</b> and eucalyptus <b>trees.</b> A single ovate egg about 43 by 30 mm in size is laid. Incubation takes 17-24 days in captivity, and both sexes appear to share the incubation duties.|$|R
50|$|Wategora Reserve {{is named}} after the Wategora tribe, also {{translated}} as Wadi(g)ora, who inhabited the local area along Duck River. The Wategora were {{also known as the}} Duck River Tribe who lived around and above the tidal limit. This important bushland area is situated on the Duck River, 5 km south of the Parramatta River, opposite Auburn Golf Course. 246 indigenous species of plants are recorded at the Wellington Road Reserve. A remnant of the Cumberland Plain Woodland, the 11 hectare area canopy consists of eucalyptus woodland, dominated by grey box and broad-leaved ironbark. Three species of tea trees (Melaleuca) are also common. However, other unusual plants known from wetter areas include <b>turpentine,</b> cheese <b>tree,</b> red mahogany and coffee bush.
