500|$|Asked {{to assess}} his {{personal}} performance {{after the loss}} to Kansas State, Colt McCoy said, [...] "I think I've had some bad luck, I'm definitely a better quarterback, definitely more experienced—I've just had some bad luck. Things that can go the wrong way, have gone the wrong way — tipped balls and that stuff." [...] He also said there was room for improvement, [...] "Teams are blitzing us a lot more. We've handled it well for the most part, but there's so many <b>things</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> better... If you ask every person on this offense, they'll tell you there's something individually they can do better." [...] After the loss to Oklahoma, Mack Brown {{said he did not}} want to hear about bad luck, [...] "By saying we're unlucky is just a cop-out, this game isn't about luck. [...] If you knock balls loose you should get on them. If you tip balls in the air you should catch them. We're not going to have any excuses." [...] Brown cited the lack of big plays on defense, particularly the lack of forced turnovers, as a problem for Texas. [...] Both Brown and Greg Davis hinted that Jamaal Charles could face less playing time as a result of his problems hanging onto the ball.|$|E
500|$|After Halo 3, {{development}} studio Bungie {{created an}} internal team {{to work on}} Peter Jackson's planned Halo game, Halo Chronicles. Chronicles was eventually canceled and the team began working on a standalone expansion project—Halo 3: ODST—while another team, led by creative director Marcus Lehto and design lead Christian Allen, worked on Reach. The team considered many different concepts and approaches to the game; among the rejected ideas was a sequel to Halo 3. The team eventually settled on a prequel to the first Halo game in brainstorming sessions. It would {{take place on the}} planet Reach, during a pivotal time in the war. [...] "Reach, as a fictional planet, was just a great candidate [...] play around with. It's such a rich world, with such a great fiction surrounding it," [...] said Lehto. [...] "We were like: 'Okay, that's it. We've just got a lot of <b>things</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> there so we can build an immense story with it.'" [...] No longer burdened with continuing the story threads of the Halo trilogy, Bungie used Reach to introduce new characters and settings. As Reach ends with the destruction of the titular planet, Bungie wanted to be sure players still felt a sense of accomplishment and success. [...] "It is a challenge overall to ensure the player feels they're doing the right thing {{all the way to the}} end," [...] said Lehto.|$|E

6000|$|Johnson spoke disparagingly of the {{learning}} of a Mr. Harris, of Salisbury, and doubted his being a good Grecian. [...] "He is what is much better," [...] cried Goldsmith, with a prompt good-nature, [...] "he is a worthy, humane man." [...] "Nay, sir," [...] rejoined the logical Johnson, [...] "that is not {{to the purpose of}} our argument; that will prove that he can play upon the fiddle as well as Giardini, as that he is an eminent Grecian." [...] Goldsmith found he had got into a scrape, and seized upon Giardini to help him out of it. [...] "The greatest musical performers," [...] said he, dexterously turning the conversation, [...] "have but small emoluments; Giardini, I am told, does not get above seven hundred a year." [...] "That is indeed but little for a man to get," [...] observed Johnson, [...] "who does best that which so many endeavor to do. There is nothing, I think, in which the power of art is shown so much as in playing on the fiddle. In all other <b>things</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> something at first. Any man will forge a bar of iron, if you give him a hammer; not so well as a smith, but tolerably.

They differ so much {{because there are so many}} different <b>things</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> with this human race.... The defeat of death; the life period advancing to ten-score years all crowded with happy activity. The solution of labor's problem; increasing safety and decreasing hours of toil, and a way out for the unhappy consumer who is ground between labor and capital. A real democracy and the love of work that shall come when work is not relegated to wage-slaves, but joyously shared in a community inclusive of the living beings of all nations. France and Germany uniting precisely as Saxony and Prussia and Bavaria have united. And, most of all, a general realization that the fact that we cannot accomplish all these things at once does not indicate that they are hopeless; an understanding that one of the wonders of the future is the fact that we shall always, in all ages, have improvements to look forward to.|$|E
