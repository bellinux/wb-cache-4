5|$|Initially ordered as Panzerschiffe, {{the three}} Deutschland-class ships were {{designed}} to meet <b>the</b> <b>limitations</b> imposed on the German Navy by the Treaty of Versailles. The treaty limited large German warships to a displacement of , but did not restrict the caliber of main battery guns. Several innovations were incorporated into the design, including extensive use of welding and all-diesel propulsion, which saved weight and allowed for the heavier main armament and armor. Nevertheless, the ships exceeded the weight restriction by several thousand tons, though the German Navy claimed the vessels were within <b>the</b> <b>limitations.</b> The three ships, Deutschland, Admiral Scheer, and Admiral Graf Spee, were built between 1929 and 1936.

50|$|What {{follows is}} a very summary {{description}} {{of the content of}} <b>the</b> <b>Limitation</b> Convention, provided for preliminary information only. Readers are encouraged to refer to the explanatory note to that convention prepared by the UNCITRAL secretariat for further introductory information on <b>the</b> <b>Limitation</b> Convention. In its original unamended version, <b>the</b> <b>Limitation</b> Convention applies when both parties have their place of business in contracting States (Article 3(1)). In the amended version, <b>the</b> <b>Limitation</b> Convention applies also when rules of private international law make the law of a Contracting State applicable to the contract of sale (Article 3(1)(b)). Hence, <b>the</b> <b>Limitation</b> Convention, as amended, applies in the same case as the CISG. It {{should be noted that the}} reference is to the rules of private international law applicable to the contract itself, and not to limitation matters. Likewise, other matters relating to scope of application of the Convention, especially in its amended form, are treated similarly as in the CISG. However, article 5 of <b>the</b> <b>Limitation</b> Convention contains an additional list of excluded matters that is not present in <b>the</b> CISG.The <b>limitation</b> period is four years, starting from the date when the claim accrues (Articles 8 and 9). <b>The</b> <b>limitation</b> period stops to run when judicial or arbitral proceedings are commenced (Articles 13 and 14).|$|R
50|$|If a {{limitation}} period has been interrupted, a new limitation period begins. If the claim {{has been defined}} by <b>the</b> court, <b>the</b> <b>limitation</b> period is always 5 years. <b>The</b> <b>limitation</b> is interrupted when the debtor’s claim is approved; when an action has been brought to court or {{in case of an}} appeal against the conciliation procedure; if the action or the appeal has been dismissed, <b>the</b> <b>limitation</b> period is uninterrupted; when enforcement procedure has been started. What has been performed to fulfil a claim barred by <b>the</b> statute of <b>limitation</b> cannot be reclaimed even if it has been performed due to ignorance of <b>the</b> <b>limitation.</b>|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Limitation</b> Convention {{has often}} been {{considered}} as a lesser, and less lucky sister of the CISG. However, it is applied regularly in certain regions of the world, especially Eastern Europe. The Case Law on UNCITRAL Texts database has an increasing collection of decisions relating to <b>the</b> <b>Limitation</b> Convention. While <b>the</b> USA has been a party to <b>the</b> <b>Limitation</b> Convention {{for more than two}} decades, only one recent judicial precedent deals with the Convention. This is unusual given that, for instance, <b>the</b> <b>Limitation</b> Convention applies to all contracts for sale of goods concluded between parties with place of business in the USA and in Mexico, unless opted out of, and may indicate limited awareness of its existence.|$|R

40|$|Limitation period {{plays an}} {{important}} part in civil action. Failure to comply with <b>the</b> <b>limitation</b> period would mean that the action instituted could diminish. <b>The</b> <b>limitation</b> period for all actions founded on contract pursuant to section 6 of <b>the</b> <b>Limitation</b> Act 1953 is 6 years. However based on the decided cases, <b>the</b> <b>limitation</b> period for action of specific performance of a contract of sale and purchase of land is 12 years, not 6. This is because all actions for specific performance of contract of sale and purchase of land were held in the decided cases to be actions 'to recover land'. Pursuant to section 9 of <b>the</b> <b>Limitation</b> Act 1953 limitation period for all actions for the recovery of land, is 12 years. However, in the author's view, <b>the</b> <b>limitation</b> period of action for specific performance of contract of sale and purchase of land should, be 6 years instead of 12 years because it is an action founded on contract. This article examines the decided cases which rule that <b>the</b> <b>limitation</b> period must be 12 years and elaborates the grounds to support the contention of the author in this respect. The second part of this article will highlight the importance of defence of limitation, and instead be successfully if the parties plead this defence in their pleading pursuant to section 4 of <b>the</b> <b>Limitation</b> Act 1953. However, this requirement has not been consistently followed by courts. It is in the author's view that the failure of the parties to plead this defence expressly could affect his defence of limitation. This article will attempt to unveil the grounds and policies of the courts concerning the above issues...|$|R

5|$|Before {{the opening}} of Melbourne Airport, Melbourne's main airport was Essendon Airport which was officially {{designated}} an international airport in 1950. In the mid-1950s, over 10,000 passengers were using Essendon Airport and <b>the</b> <b>limitations</b> of Essendon Airport were beginning to become apparent. Essendon Airport's facilities were insufficient to meet the increasing demand for air travel; the runways were too short to handle the then new jet airliners and the terminals failed to handle the increase in passengers, by the mid-1950s, an international overflow terminal was built in a new northern hangar. Due to the encroachment of the urban boundary, the airport had become surrounded by residential housing, meaning that expansion of Essendon Airport was not possible.|$|E
5|$|Crops {{included}} wheat, rye, barley and oats.

Crop yields peaked in the 13th century, and stayed more or less steady until the 18th century. Though <b>the</b> <b>limitations</b> of medieval farming were once thought to have provided a ceiling for the population growth in the Middle Ages, {{recent studies have shown}} that the technology of medieval agriculture was always sufficient for the needs of the people under normal circumstances, and that it was only during exceptionally harsh times, such as the terrible weather of 1315–17, that the needs of the population could not be met.|$|E

5|$|Many {{sequence}} alignment {{and protein}} structure alignment algorithms {{have been developed}} assuming linear data representations and as such {{are not able to}} detect circular permutations between proteins. Two examples of frequently used methods that have problems correctly aligning proteins related by circular permutation are dynamic programming and many hidden Markov models.
