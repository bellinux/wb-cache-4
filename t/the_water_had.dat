5|$|The Segaran {{lake area}} {{was the main}} complex of the Taman Sari during its era. This complex {{consisted}} of a man-made lake called Segaran ("artificial sea") with some buildings located on artificial islands {{in the middle of}} a lake. The buildings are connected by an underwater tunnel. It was used as the starting point for the royal family to reach the Taman Sari pools via a vessel. Today, the Segaran lake cannot be seen any longer as <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>had</b> been drained and the lake bed is now filled with human settlements. The underwater tunnel, which is now underground after <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>had</b> gone, still exist and can be accessed.|$|E
5|$|Both Dio and Suetonius {{agree that}} gladiatorial {{contests}} and a wild-beast hunt, the venatio, also {{took place at}} the lake area, but they again disagree on the details. Dio states this took place on the first day, with the lake covered over with planking and wooden stands erected around it, while Suetonius says the events occurred in the basin after <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>had</b> been let out. Suetonius writes that 5,000 animals were killed there in a single day. Although no record of the animals pursued in these hunts survives (Dio mentions hunts of cranes and elephants but does not give a location), larger exotic animals were popular, notably elephants, big cats and bears, though smaller game such as birds, rabbits and goats also featured.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{scientists}} at Los Alamos were eager {{to return to their}} laboratories and universities, and by February 1946 all of the wartime division heads had left, but a talented core remained. Darol Froman became head of Robert Bacher's G division, now renamed M Division. Eric Jette became responsible for Chemistry and Metallurgy, John H. Manley for Physics, George Placzek for Theory, Max Roy for Explosives, and Roger Wagner for Ordnance. The number of personnel at Los Alamos plummeted from its wartime peak of over 3,000 to around 1,000, but many were still living in temporary wartime accommodation. To make matters worse, the water pipe to Los Alamos froze and <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>had</b> to be supplied by tanker trucks. Despite the reduced staff, Bradbury still had to provide support for Operation Crossroads, the nuclear tests in the Pacific.|$|E

5|$|Washington again {{proposed}} to assault Boston in October, but his officers {{thought it best}} {{to wait until the}} harbor had frozen over. In February, when <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>had</b> frozen between Roxbury and Boston Common, Washington thought that in spite of his shortage in powder he would try an assault by rushing across the ice; but his officers again advised against it. Washington's desire to launch an attack on Boston arose from his fear that his army would desert in the winter, and how easily he knew that Howe could break the lines of his army in its present condition. He had not yet learned how completely he could trust in Howe's inactivity; he abandoned an attack across the ice with great reluctance in exchange for a more cautious plan, to fortify Dorchester Heights using cannon arrived from Fort Ticonderoga.|$|E
5|$|In R v. Fiak (2005), the {{defendant}} used a clean blanket {{to block the}} toilet of the police cell he was occupying, causing the water to overflow and flood his and other cells. The defence argued that clean water had flooded on to a waterproof floor, {{and that in the}} process the blanket was soaked by clean water. The blanket would have been reusable when dry. Cleaning up a wet cell floor did not constitute damage to the cell itself. The Court of Appeal noted that this argument assumed the absence of any possible contamination or infection from the lavatory itself, and held that {{while it is true that}} the effect of the appellant's actions in relation to the blanket and the cell were both remediable, the simple reality was that the blanket could not be used as a blanket by any other prisoner until it had been dried out and cleaned. Further, the flooded cells remained out of action until <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>had</b> been cleared. Thus, both had sustained damage, albeit temporary.|$|E
25|$|For obvious reasons, the Talmud adds to {{the biblical}} {{regulations}} a prohibition against consuming poisoned animals. Similarly, the Yoreh De'ah prohibits the drinking of water, if <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>had</b> been left overnight and uncovered {{in an area where}} there might be serpents, on the basis that a serpent might have left its venom in the water. In a place where there is no suspicion of snakes, this prohibition does not apply (tosafos, beitzah 6a).|$|E

The radiation levels near the filter cartridge replacement valves reach 4.7 millisieverts per hour after just 5 hours of operation, reportedly due to oil and sludge in the water which contained more radioactivity than expected.|$|E

25|$|For {{its first}} 120 years, the Los Angeles River {{supplied}} {{the town with}} ample water for homes and farms. It was estimated that the annual flow could have support a town of 250,000 people—if <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>had</b> been managed right. But Angelinos {{were among the most}} profligate users of water in the world. In the semi-arid climate, they were forever watering their lawns, gardens, orchards, and vineyards. Later on, they would need more to support the growth of commerce and manufacturing. By the beginning of the 20th century, the town realized it would quickly outgrow its river and need new sources of water.|$|E

25|$|At about 1:30 in the {{afternoon}} of October 25, the engineer reported that <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>had</b> been allowed to get too low in the boiler. On hearing this report, the captain ordered the engine stopped and the safety valve opened, the steamer being brought to anchor about {{a mile and a}} half from the Fox Islands, in Penobscot Bay. The fire in the furnace was extinguished, but in about a half hour, the steamer was found to be on fire under the deck over the boiler, near the animal cages. An effort was made to extinguish the flames by means of a hose attached to the pump, but it proved fruitless. The fire spread rapidly and soon consumed the firefighting equipment.|$|E
25|$|On 9 May, large rocks {{fell into}} the valley once again, burying the railway tracks for 250 metres and also making the road along the valley impassable. Moreover, the {{alluvial}} fan dammed up the Vispa, causing {{the lower part of}} the hamlet slowly to become flooded. After heavy rains on 18 Juny 1991, the station was similarly left under water. Planning immediately began for a new route for rail and road that would by pass the disaster area. The new rail alignment, totalling 2860 m, was ready to be opened on 1 August 1991. However, a heavy thunderstorm on 8 August led to a blockage of the newly excavated river channel of the Vispa by washed up glacial rubble, which meant a second flooding of the station. After <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>had</b> flowed away to a sufficient extent, the rail traffic could once again be resumed on 10 August.|$|E
25|$|The {{character}} was eventually to bow out on 23 February 1989 {{in one of}} the programme's most famous episodes which attracted more than 20 million viewers. After escaping from custody, Den returned to the famous canal (in Alperton) for one last rendezvous with Michelle. The episode ended with Den being shot {{by a member of the}} firm (who was carrying a gun concealed in a bunch of daffodils) and then falling into the canal. The scene where Den actually hit <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>had</b> to be taped at the BBC's Ealing Film Studios using a water tank, because the waters of the Grand Union Canal were deemed unsafe. When the episode was finished, however, Jonathan Powell, controller of BBC1, requested that the final shot be removed to allow for the possibility of Den returning at a later date. In protest, Tony Holland and Julia Smith had their names taken off the episode's credits. Den's exit ended up being the creators' final contribution to the show.|$|E

25|$|On Juno Beach, RCN, RN, and RM flotillas {{employed}} 142 LCAs {{and experienced}} some difficulty getting the {{units of the}} 3rd Canadian Infantry Division to shore. Earlier, ten minutes had been lost to delays during the passage of Task Force J from Southampton. The I Corps planners had scheduled the landing on Nan, the eastern sector of Juno, at 07:45, 20 minutes later than on Mike, the western sector. The planners considered that Nan landing craft would require higher water to navigate among what aerial photographs suggested were underwater rocks, but later discovered that this threat had been much overestimated and {{that much of the}} shoal was actually floating seaweed. At any rate, the shallow draft of the LCAs managed the transit without trouble from the shoals, but other deeper draft landing craft types were at risk. <b>The</b> <b>water</b> <b>had</b> risen fast in the strong north-westerly wind. When LCA carrying assault infantry approached the beach, the crews discovered that the tide was running too high for demolition personnel to clear lanes through the beach obstacles (Demolition personnel on Juno used four LCA(OC)s, Obstacle Clearance). Consequently, landing craft had to disembark their troops among the obstacles or smash through them.|$|E
25|$|Rain {{had caused}} the British {{temporarily}} to postpone attacks after the offensive began with the Battle of Pilckem Ridge on 31 July but in August <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>had</b> dried relatively quickly. In October the rains soaked the ground again and did not dry in sunny spells. (In 1935, the chief engineers of the armies, corps and divisions reported that contact with the front line became much more difficult in early October, which also applied to the French First Army on the northern flank.) Carrying parties were needed to move supplies to the front line and conditions for the artillery became so bad that pack mules were brought in to carry ammunition. Heavy artillery had to be strung out in lines along the plank roads, which made them easily visible to German artillery observers. Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, {{the commander of the}} British Expeditionary Force (BEF) was kept informed of conditions and the levels of sickness in the armies in Flanders and judged accurately that conditions for German troops were worse. Haig abandoned the strategic objectives of the offensive in early October but ordered that once the weather had improved, Passchendaele Ridge was to be captured as a suitable winter position. On 21 October, the 4th Army reported that its troops {{would not be able to}} continue to resist for much longer, under the constant British artillery-fire and being exposed to the weather in mud-filled shell-holes, with no time for recover because of the tempo of British attacks.|$|E
25|$|For {{display of}} {{extraordinary}} heroism {{in the line}} of his profession above and {{beyond the call of duty}} during the diving operations in connection with the sinking in a depth of water 304 feet, of the U.S.S. F-4 with all on board, as a result of loss of depth control, which occurred off Honolulu, T.H., on 25 March 1915. On 17 April 1915, William F. Loughman, chief gunner's mate, U.S. Navy, who had descended to the wreck and had examined one of the wire hawsers attached to it, upon starting his ascent, and when at a depth of 250 feet beneath the surface of <b>the</b> <b>water,</b> <b>had</b> his lifeline and air hose so badly fouled by this hawser that he was unable to free himself; he could neither ascend nor descend. On account of the length of time that Loughman had already been subjected to the great pressure due to the depth of water, and of the uncertainty of the additional time he would have to be subjected to this pressure before he could be brought to the surface, it was imperative that steps be taken at once to clear him. Instantly, realizing the desperate case of his comrade, Crilley volunteered to go to his aid, immediately donned a diving suit and descended. After a lapse of time of 2 hours and 11 minutes, Crilley was brought to the surface, having by a superb exhibition of skill, coolness, endurance and fortitude, untangled the snarl of lines and cleared his imperiled comrade, so that he was brought, still alive, to the surface.|$|E
