5|$|After a directors' special run between Ayr (north of <b>the</b> <b>river,</b> <b>at</b> Newton-on-Ayr) and Irvine on 19 July 1839, {{the line}} {{opened to the}} public between those points on 5 August 1839. This was an {{enormous}} success and that limited section of the line made a surplus of £500 in the remainder of the year. The section between Irvine and Kilwinning opened on 23 March 1840.|$|E
5|$|As of 1831 {{there was}} a {{settlement}} named Hadspen near a ford of the South Esk River. A road was proposed from Launceston, crossing <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>at</b> this ford near Thomas Haydock Reibey's property of Entally.|$|E
5|$|M-13/M-84 {{crosses the}} west channel of the Saginaw River near the Ted Putz Nature Area to Middle Ground island. The highway {{continues}} over the east channel on the Lafayette Avenue Bridge, a drawbridge, to Lafayette Avenue {{on the eastern}} bank of <b>the</b> <b>river.</b> <b>At</b> the intersection with Broadway Street, M-13 turns southward, and M-84 continues eastward two more blocks. Turning north on Garfield Street, the highway runs parallel to the river through a residential area. North of the 14th Street intersection, Garfield Street curves northeasterly into Washington Avenue, passing {{to the east of}} an industrial complex on <b>the</b> <b>river.</b> <b>At</b> the intersection with McKinley Street, a one-way street, M-84 meets the eastbound direction of M-25 and BS I-75. One block north, M-84 terminates at the intersection with 7th Street, which carries westbound M-25 and BS I-75; both intersections also mark BS I-75's terminus immediately east of the Veterans Memorial Bridge.|$|E
50|$|Two-day rain totals in {{some areas}} were greater than 19 in. <b>The</b> Cumberland <b>River</b> crested <b>at</b> 51.86 ft in Nashville, a level not seen since 1937, which was before the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers flood control {{measures}} were in place. All-time record crests were observed on <b>the</b> Cumberland <b>River</b> <b>at</b> Clarksville, <b>the</b> Duck <b>River</b> <b>at</b> Centerville and Hurricane Mills, <b>the</b> Buffalo <b>River</b> <b>at</b> Lobelville, <b>the</b> Harpeth <b>River</b> <b>at</b> Kingston Springs and Bellevue, and <b>the</b> Red <b>River</b> <b>at</b> Port Royal.|$|R
50|$|The major inflows are <b>the</b> Sachigo <b>River</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{southwest}} and <b>the</b> Morrison <b>River</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> east.

The primary outflow is <b>the</b> Winisk <b>River</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> north, which flows to Hudson Bay.|$|R
5|$|Olfactory cues may be {{important}} in salmon, which are known {{to return to the}} exact river where they hatched. Lockley reports experimental evidence that fish such as minnows can accurately tell the difference between the waters of different rivers. Salmon may use their magnetic sense to navigate to within reach of their river, and then use olfaction to identify <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>at</b> close range.|$|E
5|$|Sheet Harbour was {{the first}} {{community}} in North America to use a lime doser, which sprays limestone into the water, to lower acid rain levels, starting in September 2005 in the West River. It was successful in stabilizing the pH of <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>at</b> 5.5, a healthy level for salmon and other aquatic life.|$|E
5|$|The Causeway is an {{arterial}} traffic crossing in Perth, Western Australia, {{linking the}} inner-city suburbs of East Perth and Victoria Park. It {{is composed of}} two bridges either side of Heirisson Island that cross the Swan River at {{the eastern end of}} Perth Water. The current Causeway is the third structure to have been built across <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>at</b> this point.|$|E

5|$|The National Weather Service {{has since}} revised their method of {{forecasting}} spring floods. Increased technology and funding has {{allowed for the}} mapping of the entire Red River bottom, more flood monitoring gauges, and up-to-date satellite images of <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>at</b> various flood stages.|$|E
5|$|The {{banks of}} the Someșul Mic also feature {{a wide variety of}} such old {{building}}s. The end of the 19th century brought a building ensemble that fastens the corners of the oldest bridge over <b>the</b> <b>river,</b> <b>at</b> {{the north end of the}} Regele Ferdinand Avenue. The Berde, Babos, Elian, Urania, and Széki palaces consist of a mixture of Baroque, Renaissance and Gothic styles, following the Art Nouveau/Secession and Revival specifics.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> Mississippi <b>River</b> {{is known}} as the Middle Mississippi from <b>the</b> Upper Mississippi <b>River's</b> {{confluence}} with <b>the</b> Missouri <b>River</b> <b>at</b> St. Louis, Missouri, for 190 mi to its confluence with <b>the</b> Ohio <b>River</b> <b>at</b> Cairo, Illinois.|$|R
5|$|The {{following}} day, Wolfe's troops {{landed on}} the south bank of <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>at</b> Point Levis, nearly directly {{across the river from}} Quebec; an artillery battery was established there in early July that nearly levelled the lower town by bombardment.|$|E
5|$|The {{stretch of}} canal from Sharpness to Purton runs {{very close to}} <b>the</b> <b>river.</b> <b>At</b> a high spring tide they were {{separated}} by {{little more than the}} width of the towpath. The canal also has no locks, and owing to its width, not even any stop locks. Any damage to the canal bank could thus render the entire canal unnavigable.|$|E
5|$|William {{moved up}} the Thames valley to cross <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>at</b> Wallingford, where he {{received}} the submission of Stigand. He then travelled north-east along the Chilterns, before advancing towards London from the north-west, fighting further engagements against forces from the city. The English leaders surrendered to William at Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire. William was acclaimed King of England and crowned by Ealdred on 25 December 1066, in Westminster Abbey.|$|E

5|$|A {{boulevard}} to {{link the}} parks on Chicago's north and south sides was proposed as early as 1891. An early plan called for a tunnel to link Michigan Avenue south of the river with Pine Street (now Michigan Avenue) north of the river. In 1903 {{an editorial in the}} Chicago Tribune proposed a new bascule bridge across <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>at</b> Michigan Avenue. Other plans suggested that the bridge should be a replica of the Pont Alexandre III that spans the Seine in Paris, or that, rather than constructing an entirely new bridge, the existing Rush Street bridge should be double-decked.|$|E
5|$|After Inhaúma had punched {{through the}} {{defenses}} at Curupayty, he encountered three large chains stretched across <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>at</b> Humaitá that prevented further progress upriver beyond the fortress. He anchored his ships in a cove that {{became known as}} Porto Elisiário (Elisiário Port). For six months, the Brazilian warships remained stationed between Curupayty and Humaitá, bombarding both strongholds without causing any serious damage. The encirclement of Humaitá could not be completed until the Allies gained full control of the river. The Allied commander-in-chief, Argentine president Bartolomé Mitre, had pressed Inhaúma for months to execute that goal. The Brazilian had, however, developed second thoughts about the enterprise and procrastinated. He believed—unfairly—that Mitre would welcome the destruction of Brazil's warships, severely weakening the Empire militarily and geopolitically.|$|E
5|$|After {{crossing}} Golden Avenue, I-194 curves to {{the northwest}} to meet the M-96 (Columbia Avenue) interchange. The freeway runs underneath the Columbia Avenue overpass before running parallel {{to the west bank}} of the Kalamazoo River. The freeway crosses <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>at</b> the southern end of Lower Mill Pond. Curving back around to the northeast, I-194 meets Business Loop I-94 (BLI-94, Dickman Road). Here the AADT counts average 24,400vehicles a day. The freeway ends at an at-grade intersection with Hamblin Avenue, and continuing north of the intersection, the highway becomes just M-66. BLI-94 runs east of the freeway end on Hamblin Avenue to connect to Michigan Avenue. All of I-194 is listed on the National Highway System, a system of strategically important highways, and it is concurrent with M-66 for the length of the freeway.|$|E

5|$|Allen {{traveled}} {{along the}} southeastern {{banks of the}} Richelieu River, up to Sorel, where he crossed that river and continued up the southern shore of the St. Lawrence to Longueuil. According to Allen's account, he met Brown there, {{and the two of}} them then hatched a plan to attack Montreal. Brown would cross the river with 200 men at La Prairie, upriver from Montreal, and Allen, with his Americans and 80 Canadians under the command of Loiseau and Duggan, two of Livingston's captains, would cross <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>at</b> Longueuil, below the city, and the two forces would, after a prearranged signal, converge on the city itself.|$|E
5|$|Although a ferry {{had almost}} {{certainly}} {{existed at the}} site of the present-day bridge since Norman times, the earliest known crossing of <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>at</b> Richmond dates from 1439. The service was owned by the Crown, and operated by two boats, a small skiff for the transport of passengers and a larger boat for horses and small carts; the Twickenham Ferry, slightly upstream, was also in service from at least 1652. However, due to the steepness of the hill leading to the shore-line on the Surrey side neither ferry service was able to transport carriages or heavily laden carts, forcing them to make a very lengthy detour via Kingston Bridge.|$|E
5|$|Although ferries (and later bridges) {{had crossed}} the river to the east at Richmond since 1459 and to the west at Eel Pie Island since at least 1652 the lands {{to the south of}} <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>at</b> this point had {{historically}} been privately held by the Tollemache family (owners of Ham House) and off limits to the public. Consequently, despite the distance from the nearest crossings there was little demand for cross-river services at this location. Additionally, the Tollemache family had licensing rights for the Twickenham Ferry at Eel Pie Island (sometimes known as Dysart's ferry after the family), and consequently had little interest in promoting a competing service. The Twickenham Ferry is a setting for some action in Little Dorritt by Charles Dickens.|$|E
