ObjectiveThis research aimed to compare {{under what circumstances}} oncologics can obtain both regulatory and reimbursement approval in Australia on this basis. MethodsTherapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) Australian Public Assessment Reports, EMA, FDA, and Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) Public Summary Documents were extracted for any oncologic indication appraised in Australia on a pivotal <b>trial</b> <b>package</b> lacking phase III data, excluding pediatric indications and new formulations. ResultsAustralian Public Assessment Reports were available for six TGA-appraised oncologics across seven indications on such a data package: five of seven approved, one of seven restricted, and one of seven rejected. The EMA and the FDA issued recommendations on these indications an average of 1 and 2 years earlier, respectively. The PBAC appraised six oncologics across 10 indications on such a data package, with four (nilotinib, dasatinib, imatinib, and brentuximab vedotin) approved and two rejected (cetuximab and bevacizumab). Seven of the eight approved indications required multiple submissions, with inadequate clinical data frequently cited as key. Six of the eight PBAC-approved indications included economic modeling on a cost-benefit approach. ConclusionsThe TGA will approve oncologics that offer potentially substantial clinical benefits {{on the basis of}} an indirect comparison of single-arm trials but at a delay versus the EMA and the FDA. The PBAC reimbursement approval also requires more rigorous supportive clinical data and acceptable cost-effectiveness as demonstrated on a cost-benefit or cost-quality-adjusted life-year metric...|$|E

40|$|The use of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) in {{developing}} countries like Tanzania {{is considered to be}} a necessity in order to overcome the challenges that are hindering the country from developing in all sectors and also from reducing the digital divide. As ICT is becoming more and more integrated in societies world wide, its effects are clearly seen i. e. on peoples’ lives, on countries’ economy, opens doors to new opportunities, change how people learn etc. Applying ICT to empower education is one of the national strategies in eradicating poverty in Tanzania. This licentiate research is about the use of ICT tools in the secondary schools arena particularly in the development of e-Learning content and delivery for self learning environment. The main aim is trying to reduce the long time existing problems of lack of learning and teaching resources and inadequacy of qualified teachers in rural secondary schools in Tanzania. The research is focused on two secondary schools as pilot schools at Kibaha district Pwani region. The licentiate research involves multidisciplinary principles in the development of the e-Learning resources. The knowledge of instructional design, learning objects, theories in pedagogy and software engineering principles has been acquired in the course of this study. The licentiate research is also based on the participatory action research methodology throughout the conduction of the research. The licentiate thesis is developed based on the data obtained from the two surveys conducted in a number of secondary schools in Tanzania, data from the readily available reports, literature review and from the participatory activities with the stakeholders. The main stakeholders are students, teachers, head teachers, and Ministry of Education and Vocational Training (MoEVT) officials. This is an applied type of research designed to solve a practical problem, the outcome of this study is a <b>trial</b> <b>package</b> of e-Learning material for secondary schools at the pilot site. The end product of the whole e-Learning research is the e-Learning Management System (e-LMS) and the proposed name for the system is TanSSe-L (Tanzania Secondary School e-Learning) system. The e-Learning contents will be delivered using a blended mode approach. Three delivery options are considered, first, of using the e-LMS (TanSSe-L) or local server for online delivery, second of using Compact Disc Read Only Memory (CD-ROM) for offline delivery and third of using face to face (F 2 F) for classroom delivery.

40|$|The {{relevance}} of continuous {{development of new}} medicines is publicly recognized, but {{the development of new}} medicines requires increasing efforts and costs. Despite regulatory initiatives to enhance marketing authorisation such as the orphan regulation and the scientific advice procedure, current non-approval rates of new medicines are relatively high, varying from 25 - 40 %. In order to further improve the EU marketing authorisation system {{there is a need for}} empirical studies to gain insight in the way benefits and risks are evaluated and approval decisions are made by regulatory authorities. This thesis offers empirical analyses of approval decisions and the scientific advice procedure to facilitate future evidence-based improvement of the regulatory system. First, we assessed to what extent the design of the development plan, the clinical outcomes and clinical {{relevance of}} new active substances in the EU according to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human use, were associated with non-approval. This study demonstrated that disappointing clinical efficacy and safety outcomes were the major driver for non-approval (odds ratio (OR) 21. 7; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 5. 0 – 94. 0). Non-convincing clinical relevance contributed less to the likelihood of non-approval (OR 4. 6; 95 % CI 1. 1 – 20. 0) than a disappointing clinical outcome. Conversely, positive scores on clinical relevance can help overcome deficiencies with regard to clinical outcome, particularly when good alternative treatment options are lacking for the disease. In addition, we demonstrated the relevance of the underlying development plan (exploratory and confirmatory) for increasing the likelihood that a medicinal product is approved (OR 6. 1; 95 % CI 0. 9 – 42. 7). Relevant exploratory studies of the mode of action, proof of concept and dosing are valuable in reducing the number of failed dossiers and speeding up pharmaceutical innovation. Drug developers are encouraged to increase investments in such studies before moving to large and more costly Phase III trials. We also compared orphan medicinal products (OMPs) and non-OMPs and found differences in regulators´ concerns related to the clinical development plan (study design), related to clinical outcome (safety profile), and related to acknowledged high medical need. But overall these differences did not result in differential weighing of the benefit-risk for marketing approval. Our results encourage future OMP developers to search for opportunities to meet the high standards of clinical drug development e. g. for comparative study designs and validated clinically relevant endpoints. Secondly, we evaluated the role of the scientific advice procedure. An interview study with Dutch small and medium-sized enterprises demonstrated that their aims of scientific advice were to retrieve regulators’ reassurance of their development plan, to gain regulators’ trust and to a lesser extent to fill knowledge gaps where guidelines are lacking or unclear. An overview of scientific advice questions discussed with the Dutch Medicines Evaluation Board in the period 2006 – 2008 demonstrated that large companies considered the phase III <b>trial</b> <b>package</b> most relevant to discuss with regulators, whereas small companies more often aimed to discuss early drug development. The relevance of an appropriate development plan for marketing approval implies that scientific advice about exploratory and confirmatory development plans earlier and continuously during drug development could increase approval rate...|$|E

If not properly designed, these methods can partially unblind investigators, i. e., investigators can conclude that two subjects are (1) on the same treatment arm with certainty or (2) on different treatment arms with certainty. Partial unblinding can bias the way investigators provide patient care, report adverse events and assess efficacy endpoints, {{and can lead to}} full unblinding when the other subject is unblinded. In this paper, we describe several examples of partial unblinding in the supply methods commonly used by many Randomization and Trial Supply Management (RTSM) systems, propose a new criterion for evaluating the blinding properties of supply methods, and prove that two alternative supply methods do not permit full or partial unblinding, even after the investigator is unblinded up to a certain number of other subjects...|$|R

The necessary {{quantum leap}} in knowledge generation should {{build on the}} innovation capacity of farmers themselves. A novel citizen science methodology, triadic comparisons of technologies or tricot, was implemented in pilot studies in India, East Africa, and Central America. The methodology involves distributing a pool of agricultural technologies in different combinations of three to individual farmers who observe these technologies under farm conditions and compare their performance. Since the combinations of three technologies overlap, statistical methods can piece together the overall performance ranking of the complete pool of technologies. The tricot approach affords wide scaling, as the distribution of <b>trial</b> <b>packages</b> and instruction sessions {{is relatively easy to}} execute, farmers {{do not need to be}} organized in collaborative groups, and feedback is easy to collect, even by phone.

To achieve the aim, simple heuristic <b>trials</b> <b>packaged</b> as a 12 showerheads in 12 weeks Challenge were conducted involving 12 participants - 6 male and 6 female. It was found that showerhead design factors such as colour, shape and size are inconclusive in determining the water efficient use, and perception of a positive shower experience. However, {{factors such as the}} number of function inform user choice and preference of which showerhead to choose and use. Further, sprout type and mode of operation both influence user perception of the performance factors such as feel, pleasantness, enjoyability, time taken and effectiveness of clean. And these factors in turn significantly affect the user perception of what constitutes a ‘good' shower experience. It was also found that a functionality mismatch does occur in sustainability products if performance, and not design factors, fail to meet with user expectations. This work is novel because few, if any, studies of this nature have specifically been undertaken outside of the laboratory environment, and significant because the findings highlight the importance and influence of the physical design and performance-informing features on the user perception of the product itself.

Collaborations are likely to be most rewarding in long-term conditions where significant partnerships are commonly established between service users and health professionals over time. To involve patients and the public in helping to design, develop and disseminate research is recognised to improve clinical research through providing a fresh approach to investigations, improve recruitment to research studies, develop novel outcomes and better inform study designs. Different stages and levels in the research process exist. Session 1 : Title: Patient Involvement in research what is the evidence and the scope of PPI in MSK research. Heidi Lempp and Jo Adams This presentation provides the background to the occurrence and evidence for the effectiveness of Patient and Public Involvement in research in designing more successful and relevant research projects. It provides examples of successful PPI strategies from two perspectives. The first provides examples from individual research projects showing how patients and service users can be involved in setting priorities for research agendas, agreeing <b>trial</b> intervention <b>packages,</b> designing active and placebo intervention components and contributing towards dissemination and publication of research findings. Simple strategies to maximise, maintain and acknowledge PPI input are explored. The second provides example from a national approach to embedding PPI across the Arthritis Research UK Centre of Excellence for Sport, Exercise and Osteoarthritis. Training and support for both PPI representatives and clinical academics is crucial. Some of the challenges involved in establishing and developing PPI strategies across multi disciplinary research are discussed and feedback provided on useful strategies to support on going engagement. <br/...|$|R

Findings. We reported recently on the development and successful testing in Hunan province, PR China, of a health education package to prevent STH infections in Han Chinese primary school students. We have recently commenced a new <b>trial</b> of the <b>package</b> in the ethnically diverse Xishuangbanna autonomous prefecture in Yunnan province and the approach is also being tested in West Africa, with further expansion into the Philippines in 2015. Conclusions: The work in China illustrates well the direct impact that health education can have in improving knowledge and awareness, and in changing hygiene behaviour. Further, it can provide insight into the public health outcomes of a multi-component integrated control program, where health education prevents re-infection and periodic drug treatment reduces prevalence and morbidity...|$|R
40|$|Background Depression {{is common}} in primary care and is often unrecognized and untreated. Studies are needed to {{demonstrate}} the feasibility of implementing evidence-based depression care provided by primary health care workers (PHCWs) in sub-Saharan Africa. We carried out a pilot two-parallel arm cluster randomized controlled <b>trial</b> of a <b>package</b> of care for depression in primary care. Methods Six primary health care centers (PHCC) in two Local Government Areas of Oyo State, South West Nigeria were randomized into 3 intervention and 3 control clinics. Three PHCWs were selected for training {{from each of the}} participating clinics. The PHCWs from the intervention clinics were trained to deliver a manualized multicomponent stepped care intervention package for depression consisting of psychoeducation, activity scheduling, problem solving treatment and medication for severe depression. Providers from the control clinics delivered care as usual, enhanced by a refresher training on depression diagnosis and management. Outcome measures Patient’s Health Questionnaire (PHQ- 9), WHO quality of Life instrument (WHOQOL-Bref) and the WHO disability assessment schedule (WHODAS) were administered in the participants’ home at baseline, 3 and 6 months. Results About 98...|$|R

40|$|This report {{describes}} seakeeping experiments {{carried out}} on the 45 ft. (13. 72 m) fishing vessel CCGA Nautical Twilight off St. John?s, NL November 20, 2003. Collaborators involved in the fishing vessel sea trials include the Institute for Ocean Technology (IOT), Memorial University of Newfoundland (MUN), Oceanic Consulting Corp. (OCC), Canadian Coast Guard (CCG), the Offshore Safety and Survival Centre (OSSC) of the Marine Institute and SafetyNet ? a Community Research Alliance on Health and Safety in Marine and Coastal Work. Primary financial support for the project is provided from federal funding sources including the Search & Rescue (SAR), New Initiatives Fund (NIF) and the Canadian Institutes of Health and Research (CIHR) in addition to significant in-kind contributions from the many participants. The objective of the project is to acquire quality full scale motions data on fishing vessels to validate physical model methodology as well as numerical simulation models under development. Eventually, tools will be developed and validated to evaluate the number of Motion Induced Interrupts (MIIs), induced by sudden ship motions, {{and their impact on}} crew accidents to develop criteria to reduce MIIs. This document describes the CCGA Nautical Twilight, the <b>trials</b> instrumentation <b>package,</b> data acquisition system, test program, data analysis procedure and presents the results. Unfortunately there was a failure of the directional wave buoy deployed during the trial and no valid wave information data was acquired. Thus although a series of short runs were completed for the benefit of research underway by MUN Kinesiology staff, this trial cannot be considered a success and this report merely documents effort carried out. There may be an opportunity to repeat the trial on the ?Nautical Twilight? or equivalent vessel in the future. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
40|$|Nicotinic acid (niacin) is a {{well-established}} treatment for dyslipidaemia – an important cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor. However, niacin may also reduce blood pressure (BP), {{which is another}} important CVD risk factor. This review examines the limited publicly available data on niacin’s BP effects. Acute administration of immediate-release niacin may lower BP because of niacin’s acute vasodilatory effects. Although not always supported by clinical <b>trial</b> data, the <b>package</b> insert of a prescription, extended-release niacin describes niacin-induced acute hypotension. From a chronic standpoint, larger studies, such as the Coronary Drug Project, suggest that niacin may lower BP when administered {{over a longer period}} of time. Post hoc analyses of some of the more recent niacin clinical trials also support a more chronic, dose-dependent, BP-lowering effect of niacin. Because laropiprant [a prostaglandin D 2 (PGD 2) type 1 (DP 1) receptor antagonist] does not attenuate niacin’s BP-lowering effects, it is unlikely that any chronic lowering of BP by niacin is due to dilation of dermal vessels through activation of the DP 1 receptor by PGD 2. Further research is warranted to evaluate the extent and mechanisms of niacin’s effects on BP...|$|R
