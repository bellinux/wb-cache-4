40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{tensions}} created when a political project explicitly tries {{to restructure the}} ways in which people cooperate with each other, in ways that are different to established ways of organizing society.

The paper draws on long term ethnographic field research in guerilla zones in central and eastern India to explore not just the futuristic notions of cooperation that the Maoists seek to establish in their aims of achieving communism, but also the difficulties they have in establishing new relations of cooperation by rupturing and restructuring existing hierarchies of class, caste and indigeneity. The paper thus promotes an analysis that situates an understanding of forms of cooperation in relation to the political and economic projects which structure them...|$|R

The resulting recall affected more than 300,000 vehicles in the United States and Canada.

5|$|Several {{areas of}} the city were {{developed}} in the Stuart period, and more building took place during Georgian times in response to the increasing number of visitors who required accommodation. Architects John Wood the Elder and his son laid out the new quarters in streets and squares, the identical façades of which gave an impression of palatial scale and classical decorum. Much of the creamy gold Bath stone, a type of limestone used for construction in the city, was obtained from the Combe Down and Bathampton Down Mines owned by Ralph Allen (1694–1764). Allen, to advertise the quality of his quarried limestone, commissioned the elder John Wood to build a country house on his Prior Park estate between the city and the mines. Allen was responsible for improving and expanding the postal service in western England, for which he held the contract for more <b>than</b> <b>forty</b> <b>years.</b> Although not fond of politics, Allen was a civic-minded man and a member of Bath Corporation for many years.

Singapore is the only country in the world to have transformed itself from a developing country to a developed country in less <b>than</b> only <b>forty</b> <b>years.</b> But its slower move towards a culture ofparticipation must move as quickly as globalization does if it is to remain in relevant and legitimate democracy.
