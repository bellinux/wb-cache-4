5|$|One {{recorded}} case of courtship behavior involving curve-billed thrashers describes two males attacking {{each other}} vigorously and resorting to purring and hissings sounds when neither bird appeared to relent. The two males then puffed up <b>their</b> <b>chests</b> and strutted {{up and down}} in front of the female. They continued to alternate between purr and hiss and fighting one another until one triumphed. The victor flew towards the female and both chirped melodically before copulation.|$|E
5|$|Umar {{is said to}} have later regretted this decision. It is {{said that}} after the Hajj of 642, Umar had decided to re-appoint Khalid to the {{military}} services, apparently to command the Muslim conquest of Persia that was to begin shortly. But fate had decided otherwise, as when he reached Medina, news of Khalid's death reached him. The news of Khalid's death broke like a storm over Medina. The women took to the streets, led by the women of the Banu Makhzum (Khalid's tribe), wailing and beating <b>their</b> <b>chests.</b> Though Umar, from the very first day had given orders {{that there would be no}} wailing for departed Muslims, as forbidden in Islam, in this one case he made an exception.|$|E

5|$|While most vocals are audible to {{the human}} ear, a captive leopard seal was {{recorded}} making ultrasonic calls underwater. In addition, the vocals of northern elephant seals may produce infrasonic vibrations. Non-vocal communication is not as common in pinnipeds as in cetaceans. Nevertheless, when disturbed by intruders harbor seals and Baikal seals may slap their fore-flippers against their bodies as warnings. Teeth chattering, hisses and exhalations are also made as aggressive warnings. Visual displays also occur: Weddell seals will make an S-shaped posture when patrolling under the ice, and Ross seals will display the stripes on <b>their</b> <b>chests</b> and teeth when approached. Male hooded seals use their inflatable nasal membranes to display to and attract females.|$|E
5|$|Koalas {{typically}} inhabit open eucalypt woodlands, and {{the leaves}} of these trees make up most of their diet. Because this eucalypt diet has limited nutritional and caloric content, koalas are largely sedentary and sleep up to 20 hours a day. They are asocial animals, and bonding exists only between mothers and dependent offspring. Adult males communicate with loud bellows that intimidate rivals and attract mates. Males mark their presence with secretions from scent glands located on <b>their</b> <b>chests.</b> Being marsupials, koalas give birth to underdeveloped young that crawl into their mothers' pouches, where they stay {{for the first six}} to seven months of their lives. These young koalas, known as joeys, are fully weaned around a year old. Koalas have few natural predators and parasites, but are threatened by various pathogens, such as Chlamydiaceae bacteria and the koala retrovirus, as well as by bushfires and droughts.|$|E
5|$|The thick {{shell and}} rounded shape of {{bivalves}} make them awkward for potential predators to tackle. Nevertheless, {{a number of}} different creatures include them in their diet. Many species of demersal fish feed on them including the common carp (Cyprinus carpio), which is being used in the upper Mississippi River to try to control the invasive zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha). Birds such as the Eurasian oystercatcher (Haematopus ostralegus) have specially adapted beaks which can pry open their shells. The herring gull (Larus argentatus) sometimes drops heavy shells onto rocks in order to crack them open. Sea otters feed on a variety of bivalve species and have been observed to use stones balanced on <b>their</b> <b>chests</b> as anvils on which to crack open the shells. The Pacific walrus (Odobenus rosmarus divergens) {{is one of the main}} predators feeding on bivalves in Arctic waters. Shellfish have formed part of the human diet since prehistoric times, a fact evidenced by the remains of mollusc shells found in ancient middens. Examinations of these deposits in Peru has provided a means of dating long past El Niño events because of the disruption these caused to bivalve shell growth.|$|E

5|$|In March 1622, {{governor}} of Yucatán Diego de Cardenas ordered captain Francisco de Mirones Lezcano {{to launch an}} assault upon the Itza; he set out from Yucatán with 20 Spanish soldiers and 80 Mayas from Yucatán. His expedition was later joined by Franciscan friar Diego Delgado. The expedition first camped at IxPimienta; in May they moved to Sakalum, southwest of Bacalar, {{where there was a}} lengthy delay while they waited for reinforcements. En route to Nojpetén, Delgado believed that the soldiers' treatment of the Maya was excessively cruel, and he left the expedition to make his own way to Nojpetén with eighty Christianised Maya from Tipuj in Belize. In the meantime the Itza had learnt of the approaching military expedition and had become hardened against further Spanish missionary attempts. When Mirones learnt of Delgado's departure, he sent 13 soldiers to persuade him to return or continue as his escort should he refuse. The soldiers caught up with him just before Tipuj, but he was determined to reach Nojpetén. From Tipuj, Delgado sent a messenger to Kan Ek', asking permission to travel to Nojpetén; the Itza king replied with a promise of safe passage for the missionary and his companions. The party was initially received in peace at the Itza capital, {{but as soon as the}} Spanish soldiers let their guard down, the Itza seized and bound the new arrivals. The soldiers were sacrificed to the Maya gods, with their hearts cut from <b>their</b> <b>chests</b> and their heads impaled on stakes around the town. After the sacrifice of the Spanish soldiers, the Itza took Delgado, cut his heart out and dismembered him; they displayed his head on a stake with the others. The fate of the leader of Delgado's Maya companions was no better. With no word from Delgado's escort, Mirones sent two Spanish soldiers with Bernardino Ek, a Maya scout, to learn their fate. When they arrived upon the shore of Lake Petén Itzá, the Itza took them across to their island capital and imprisoned them. They escaped to a canoe by the lakeshore but the two Spanish, slowed by their bonds, were soon recaptured. Ek escaped and returned to Mirones with the news.|$|E

25|$|Sirens were {{believed}} to combine women and birds in various ways. In early Greek art, Sirens were represented as birds with large women's heads, bird feathers and scaly feet. Later, they were represented as female figures with the legs of birds, with or without wings, playing a variety of musical instruments, especially harps. The tenth-century Byzantine encyclopedia Suda says that from <b>their</b> <b>chests</b> up Sirens had the form of sparrows, below they were women, or, alternatively, that they were little birds with women's faces. Birds were chosen because of their beautiful voices. Later Sirens were sometimes depicted as beautiful women, whose bodies, not only their voices, are seductive.|$|E

25|$|It {{has also}} been {{suggested}} that chacmools were used as a techcatl, or sacrificial stone over which victims were stretched so their hearts could be cut from <b>their</b> <b>chests.</b> The Crónica Mexicayotl describes such a sacrificial stone as sculpted {{in the form of}} a person with a twisted head. Techcatl were not just used for human sacrifice, they were also used in the yacaxapotlaliztli ceremony, where the nose of a future ruler was pierced. Such rituals may also have been executed upon chacmools, and the presence of small nose jewels sculpted onto various chacmools at Chichen Itza and one at Tula has been used to support this idea.|$|E

25|$|When {{correctly}} reared, llamas spitting at a {{human is}} a rare thing. Llamas are very social herd animals, however, and do sometimes spit {{at each other as}} a way of disciplining lower-ranked llamas in the herd. A llama's social rank in a herd is never static. They can always move up or down in the social ladder by picking small fights. This is usually done between males to see which will become dominant. Their fights are visually dramatic, with spitting, ramming each other with <b>their</b> <b>chests,</b> neck wrestling and kicking, mainly to knock the other off balance. The females are usually only seen spitting as a means of controlling other herd members.|$|E

25|$|Cnut died at Shaftesbury in Dorset and {{was buried}} in the Old Minster, Winchester. With the events of 1066 the new regime of Normandy was keen to signal its arrival with an ambitious {{programme}} of grandiose cathedrals and castles throughout the High Middle Ages. Winchester Cathedral was built on the old Anglo-Saxon site and the previous burials, including Cnut's, were set in mortuary chests there. During the English Civil War in the 17th century, plundering Roundhead soldiers scattered the bones of Cnut on the floor and they were spread amongst the various other chests, notably those of William Rufus. After the restoration of the monarchy, the bones were collected and replaced in <b>their</b> <b>chests,</b> although somewhat out of sorts.|$|E
25|$|The MCG {{was also}} used for another {{demonstration}} sport, Australian Rules. The Olympics being an amateur competition meant that only amateurs could play in the demonstration game.

The game was played 7 December 1956 with the VAFA side, wearing white jumpers, green collars and the Olympic rings on <b>their</b> <b>chests,</b> winning easily 81 to 55. One of the players chosen for the VFA side was Lindsay Gaze (although he never got off the bench) who {{would go on to}} make his mark in another sport, basketball, rather than Australian Rules.|$|E
25|$|Although it is {{not known}} exactly where and when Uloqsaq was born, it is thought he was born around 1887, as he was about 30 during his murder trial in 1917. Prior to his murder trial, Uloqsaq was a very {{prominent}} Copper Inuit angakkuq. According to anthropologist Diamond Jenness, who had spoken with Uloqsaq in November 1915, Uloqsaq had purchased his occult powers from another practitioner in Bathurst Inlet. These powers reportedly gave him the power to transform himself into a wolf, a bear or even a European person. He told Jenness that he had once lived underwater for many days and performed necromancy. He also claimed to have turned men and women into animals and seen European men with mouths on <b>their</b> <b>chests.</b>|$|E
