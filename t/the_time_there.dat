5|$|A {{rapid transit}} route to connect Staten Island (alternately known as Richmond County) to the {{remainder}} of New York City was proposed in 1912, {{in conjunction with the}} Dual Contracts of the New York City Subway. At <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>there</b> were no vehicular or rail connections between Staten Island and the other four boroughs; the only connection was by ferry. Although not funded by the city, the tunnel was expected to help expand the then-sparsely populated borough in a similar manner to the population and development explosions seen in Brooklyn and the Bronx.|$|E

The British nationality of her captain became an issue in the Irish general election of June 1943, there were diplomatic exchanges between the United States and Ireland, and questions raised in the British House of Commons. In Germany, the U-boat's captain received a mild reprimand.|$|E
5|$|Charles X died in February 1660 and was {{succeeded by}} a regency council—led by {{the queen mother}} Hedvig Eleonora—that ruled {{in the name of}} Charles XI who was only four {{at the time of his}} father's death. Sweden had come close to almost {{complete}} control over trade in the Baltic, but the war revealed the need to work against the formation of anti-Swedish alliances that included Denmark, especially with France, the most powerful state in Europe at <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> <b>There</b> were some successes in foreign policy with the anti-French 1668 Triple Alliance of England, Sweden, and the Dutch Republic.|$|E

5|$|Due {{to growing}} {{concerns}} in the public, in 2001 the Centers for Disease Control and the National Institutes of Health asked the U.S. National Academy of Science's (NAS) Institute of Medicine to establish an independent expert committee to review hypotheses about existing and emerging immunization safety concerns. This initial report found that based on indirect and incomplete evidence available at <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>there</b> was inadequate evidence to accept or reject a thiomersal-autism link, though it was biologically plausible.|$|E
5|$|In 1566, {{the capital}} city of Valletta was founded on the Sciberras Peninsula, which did not have a good water supply. Rainwater {{collected}} within the city was not enough {{to meet the needs of}} its population. Water had to be carted from springs to the city, but this became difficult by the end of the 16th century, when the city had become the largest settlement in Malta. At <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>there</b> were also fears of an Ottoman attack on Malta, so a steady water supply to the capital was a priority for the military authorities in the case of a siege.|$|E

5|$|In September 1945, Hồ {{declared}} independence {{under the}} Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV) following {{the withdrawal of}} Imperial Japan, which had seized {{control of the country}} from France during the Second World War. At <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>there</b> was a power vacuum, as both Japan and France had been decimated by the war. There was an outbreak of nationalist fervour in Vietnam; Tảng and Thảo joined the Vanguard Youth, an impromptu independence militia. Tảng was assigned to be the leader of the local unit, but he left the movement soon after, leaving Thảo in command. During this period, Saigon was regularly engulfed in riots.|$|E
5|$|In early 1916, {{following}} the unsuccessful Gallipoli campaign, {{the decision was}} made to expand the size of the Australian Imperial Force (AIF). At <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>there</b> were two divisions in Egypt—the 1st and 2nd—and of these, one of them (the 1st) was split up to provide a cadre upon which to raise the 4th and 5th Divisions. Around this time the decision to raise a fifth division from fresh volunteers in Australia was also made and as a result the 3rd Division was officially raised on 2 February 1916.|$|E
5|$|Leeds, {{like many}} {{industrial}} cities, has little remaining medieval architecture. The lack of Medieval architecture in central Leeds {{may be attributed}} to the small size of the town during the majority of the period, the population usually being around 1,000.

Charles Upham's VC and Bar was among these. A reward of NZ$300,000 was posted {{for information leading to}} the recovery of the decorations and conviction of the thieves, although at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>there</b> was much public debate about the need to offer reward money to retrieve the medals.

5|$|On June 18, 2009 Parliament Speaker {{and leader}} of Bloc of Lytvyn Volodymyr Lytvyn stated that his party is not seeking posts in the Cabinet of Ministers even though at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>there</b> were three posts vacant and the Transport and Communications Minister Yosyp Vinskyi turned in his {{resignation}} one day earlier.

5|$|Representative peers were {{introduced}} in 1707, when the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland were united into the Kingdom of Great Britain. At <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>there</b> were 168 English and 154 Scottish peers. The English peers feared that the House of Lords would be swamped by the Scottish element, and consequently {{the election of a}} small number of representative peers to represent Scotland was negotiated. A similar arrangement was adopted when the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Kingdom of Ireland merged into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in January 1801.|$|E

5|$|The Georgia School of Technology {{opened in}} the fall of 1888 with two {{building}}s. One building (now Tech Tower, an administrative headquarters) had classrooms to teach students; The second building featured a shop and had a foundry, forge, boiler room, and engine room. It was designed for students to work and produce goods to sell and fund the school. The two buildings were equal in size to show the importance of teaching both the mind and the hands, though, at <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>there</b> was some disagreement to whether the machine shop should have been used to turn a profit.|$|E
5|$|The Sea Dart {{began as}} Convair's entry in a 1948 U.S. Navy contest for a {{supersonic}} interceptor aircraft. During <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>there</b> was much skepticism about operating supersonic aircraft from carrier decks. So {{in order to}} address this issue, U.S. Navy ordered many subsonic fighters. The worry had some foundation, since many supersonic designs of the time required long takeoff rolls, had high approach speeds, and were not very stable or easy to control—all factors that were troublesome on a carrier.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the United States, Hurricane Carol caused $461million in damage, {{mostly in}} New England, {{making it the}} costliest Atlantic {{hurricane}} at <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> <b>There</b> were 65deaths in New England, and about 1,000injured people. Despite the high damage, advance warning allowed for many fewer deaths than the total of 488fatalities during the 1938 New England hurricane, which affected the same area with similar strength. However, some areas did not receive advance warning, due to power outages preventing people from receiving Weather Bureau warnings ahead of the storm.|$|E

5|$|When Holmenkolbanen, the {{operator}} of the Holmenkoll Line, was merged into Oslo Sporveier in 1975, plans {{were put in}} place to replace the old teak cars with faster units that could operate from Nationaltheatret to Frognerseteren in 25 minutes—allowing a turn-around time of one hour. At <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>there</b> had been two separate pools of trains for the eastern and western networks. On the eastern metro, the T1000 units were in use, while the western network was using older material. During the 1980s, some T1000 stock had been rebuilt with pantograph, and taken into use on the western network.|$|E
5|$|A {{historic}} preservation movement in Omaha {{has led to}} a number of historic structures and districts being designated Omaha Landmarks or listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Much of the push toward preservation came after Omaha gained the notorious designation of having, in 1989, demolished the largest-ever National Register historic district in the United States, a record that still stands as of 2013. The Jobbers Canyon Historic District, along the Missouri River, was felled for a new headquarters campus for ConAgra Foods, a company which threatened to relocate if Omaha did not allow them to raze the city's historic district. The Jobber's Canyon warehouses had before then been allowed to deteriorate and were the scene of several fires set by the homeless population that had come to live in the abandoned buildings. At <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>there</b> were no plans in place for revitalizing the buildings.|$|E
5|$|According to Adam of Bremen and the Saxo Grammaticus, Roskilde {{was founded}} in the 980s by Harald Bluetooth. On high ground above the harbour, he built a wooden church consecrated to the Holy Trinity {{as well as a}} royal {{residence}} nearby. Although no traces of these buildings have been discovered, in 1997 archaeologists found the remains of Viking ships in the Isefjord, the oldest of which is dated to 1030. At <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>there</b> were also two churches in the area: St Jørgensbjerg, an early stone church, and a wooden church discovered under today's St Ib's Church. Harald was buried in the wooden church he had built on the site of today's Roskilde Cathedral.|$|E
