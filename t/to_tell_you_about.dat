5|$|I {{longed for}} real companionship, for {{apart from that}} life had nothing to offer me in Darmstadt...So {{naturally}} I am bitterly disappointed with myself when I look back, and see {{that in spite of}} great ambitions, good intentions, and real effort, my hopes have nevertheless been completely ship-wrecked...You say, darling, that you would never have caused me hardship intentionally...I only regret the lack of any intention or desire – or rather insight – to be more to me, and that does not mean spending all your time with me, without wishing to share anything with me at the same time. But I am wrong to talk of these things. Your letters are so dear and kind – but so empty and bare – I feel myself through them that I have less to say to you than any other person. Rain – fine weather – things that have happened – that is all I ever have <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> – so utterly cut off is my real self, my innermost life, from yours...I have tried again and again {{to talk to you about}} more serious things, when I felt the need to do so – but we never meet each other – we have developed separately...and that is why I feel true companionship is an impossibility for us – because our thoughts will never meet...I love you too so very much, my darling husband, and that is why it is so sad to feel that our life is nevertheless so incomplete...But you are never intentionally to blame for this – I never think that, never...|$|E
500|$|General François Kellermann {{distinguished}} {{himself at}} Marengo. Melas, trapped in Alessandria with his hopes of breaking {{through to the}} east shattered, sent the same evening to Vienna a message in which he explained that the [...] "charge of Kellermann had broken the soldiers and this sudden and terrible change of fortunes finished by smashing the courage of the troops. The disorder of the cavalry which had disorganised our infantry precipitated its retreat." [...] At the same time, Murat was writing to Berthier: [...] "I especially have <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> Kellermann; through a powerful charge he managed to tilt the balance in our favour." [...] However, in the Bulletin de l'armée issued the following day, Napoleon sought to counterbalance Kellermann's charge with Jean-Baptiste Bessières's: [...] "The chef de brigade Bessières, {{in front of the}} reckless grenadiers of the guard, executed a charge with as much activity as valour and penetrated the line of the enemy cavalry; this resulted in the entire rout of the army." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{characters}} in Final Fantasy XII have received mixed opinions from reviewers. Praises were given by Calvin Smith of PSX Extreme, who {{stated that the}} characters are [...] "classy and well thought out, an ensemble cast whose players rarely descend into needless melodrama or writhing angst". He {{also said that the}} supposed main character's role was changed to become an observer, [...] "a different outlook than in the previous installments". 1UP.com's Andrew Pfister applauded the character dialogues as being [...] "intelligent, subtle and sharp"; the relationships between characters were lauded as well. Balthier and Fran's relationship was compared to Han Solo and Chewbacca of Star Wars, being [...] "far more interesting than anything Square's put out in the modern FF era". IGN editor Jeremy Dunham praised the game and its writers for [...] "evolving the personalities, histories, and motives of characters you already thought you knew, but didn't" [...] and for [...] "capitaliz on the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> them". He also noted the visual and auditory detail of the characters, saying that [...] "each and every model, down to the most obscure NPC, has an immense level of attention paid to them -- from their clothes and facial expressions, to their walking and idle animations" [...] and that the voice acting was [...] "top-notch". GameSpy's Justin Speer also praised the characters, saying that it was hard to [...] "resist being charmed by a few of the characters" [...] and that they [...] "interact with each other in dramatic and interesting ways". The voice acting was praised by Keith Schleicher of Gaming Trend, who said that the characters voices all matched their appearances well.|$|E

2500|$|With fame came intense {{scrutiny}} {{of her personal}} life. The press became increasingly aggressive, printing untrue or exaggerated stories, soliciting information from people who supposedly knew her. An ex-boyfriend sold his story about his life {{with her to the}} News of the World. [...] "He appeared on television with my dog saying, 'I'm going <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> the real Tracey Ullman. Aren’t we Lilly?'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Often the {{minister}} reads passages from well-known historical, sociological, or anthropological works, and finds in them inconspicuous {{references to the}} Blackman’s true history in the world.... Occasionally {{the minister}} chides the audience for its scepticism: “I know you don't believe me because I {{happen to be a}} Black man. Well, you can look it up in a book I’m going <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> that was written by a white man.” He then reads off references that his hearers are challenged to check for themselves. A single documented statement, however, may become the basis {{of a wide range of}} generalized non-sequiturs. The fact that a North Carolina slaveholder had an Arabic-speaking Muslim slave of unusual mathematical ability may be offered as evidence that all slaves brought to America were Moslem, Arabic-speaking, and learned. Similarly, historical facts may be indiscriminately mingled with myths and countermyths. (The Black Muslims in America, pp. 120–121) ...|$|E

2500|$|On April 6, 1986, Engine 819 {{moved out}} of the Cotton Belt Route's yard at Pine Bluff marking the first time it had moved under its own power since 1953. The large crowd {{gathered}} at the railyard, including a number of railroad employees, burst into applause and shouted their approval as the locomotive's nose emerged from the shop building and into the bright sunshine. The American flag and the Arkansas state flag affixed to the right and left sides of the shiny black engine gave a patriotic air to the event. Members of the Cotton Belt Railroad Historical Society invested over 35,000 man-hours into this restoration project. Jake Commer praised the efforts the Cotton Belt Route had extended stating, [...] "They helped us so much I can't even begin <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> all of it. If it hadn't been for the railroad, we couldn't have done it." ...|$|E
