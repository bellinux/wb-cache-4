500|$|Few male {{respondents}} {{had engaged in}} childhood sex play, {{and it did not}} seem to be important in the development of homosexuality. Homosexual men were less likely to report having enjoyed boys' activities such as football and to see themselves as having been very masculine while growing up, but more likely to report having enjoyed stereotypical girls' activities. <b>Three</b> <b>variables</b> (dislike of typical boys' activities, enjoying typical girls' activities, and feelings of masculinity or femininity) were combined into a composite measure called [...] "Childhood Gender Nonconformity", which proved to be the most important developmental variable. It appeared to make male respondents less likely to feel attraction to the opposite sex during childhood, but more likely to feel sexually different from other boys, experience homosexual arousal and activities, and become homosexual as adults. Homosexual men were more likely to recall having felt different from other boys their age, or to say that they felt different because they did not like sport, or because they were not interested in girls or were sexually interested in other boys. They were also more likely to report feeling different because they had stereotypical feminine traits or interests. Feeling different during childhood appeared to be irrelevant, but feeling different for gender reasons during adolescence had [...] "modest total effects". Boys who felt sexually different were more likely to become homosexual as adults, whether they began to feel that way during childhood or adolescence. While homosexual men were more likely to have been labeled sexually different or homosexual before the age of 19, this apparently played no significant role in the development of sexual orientation.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the main}} goals of {{invariant}} theory was to solve the [...] "finite basis problem". The sum or product of any two invariants is invariant, and the finite basis problem asked whether {{it was possible to}} get all the invariants by starting with a finite list of invariants, called generators, and then, adding or multiplying the generators together. For example, the discriminant gives a finite basis (with one element) for the invariants of binary quadratic forms. Noether's advisor, Paul Gordan, was known as the [...] "king of invariant theory", and his chief contribution to mathematics was his 1870 solution of the finite basis problem for invariants of homogeneous polynomials in two variables. He proved this by giving a constructive method for finding all of the invariants and their generators, but was not able to carry out this constructive approach for invariants in three or more variables. In 1890, David Hilbert proved a similar statement for the invariants of homogeneous polynomials in any number of variables. Furthermore, his method worked, not only for the special linear group, but also for some of its subgroups such as the special orthogonal group. His first proof caused some controversy because it did not give a method for constructing the generators, although in later work he made his method constructive. For her thesis, Noether extended Gordan's computational proof to homogeneous polynomials in <b>three</b> <b>variables.</b> Noether's constructive approach made it possible to study the relationships among the invariants. Later, after she had turned to more abstract methods, Noether called her thesis [...] (crap) and Formelngestrüpp (a jungle of equations).|$|E
