5|$|The final Supreme Court cases {{discussed}} by Heins include the 1987 ruling in City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co. and the court's 1988 opinion in Watson v. Fort Worth Bank & Trust. The former was ruled unconstitutional as an affirmative-action structure {{in a business}} to support female employees, a decision with which Heins disagreed. Watson v. Fort Worth Bank & Trust followed that decision, finding that subjective employee analysis is subject <b>to</b> <b>bias</b> and requiring an explanation from the employer of how such analysis directly relates to job performance.|$|E
5|$|A {{magnetostrictive}} material is one which changes shape when {{a magnetic field}} is applied. In reverse, it produces a magnetic field when distorted. The magnetostrictive transducer requires a coil of conducting wire around the {{magnetostrictive material}}. The coil either induces a magnetic field in the transducer and sets it in motion or else picks up an induced current from {{the motion of the}} transducer at the filter output. It is also usually necessary to have a small magnet <b>to</b> <b>bias</b> the magnetostrictive material into its operating range. It is possible to dispense with the magnets if the biasing is taken care of on the electronic side by providing a d.c. current superimposed on the signal, but this approach would detract from the generality of the filter design.|$|E
5|$|Transport links {{generally}} {{are regarded as}} an important factor which affects a company’s decision on where to locate, and thus invest, although the latest survey shows quality of telecommunications moving above transport in importance. Survey evidence indicates that a quarter of companies regard access to air services as {{an important factor in}} the decision of where in the UK to locate operations, whilst one in ten companies report that the absence of good air transport links has affected their decision to invest in the UK. The survey has been criticised as suffering from a poor response rate and therefore open <b>to</b> <b>bias,</b> though this issue has been recognised and rationalised by the report's authors.|$|E

In this paper we summarize results from three Choice Experiment studies that find evidence in favor of gender differences in vulnerability <b>to</b> <b>biases.</b> Specifically, the results indicate that women are more susceptible <b>to</b> starting point <b>bias</b> than men, while men are more susceptible <b>to</b> hypothetical <b>bias</b> than women. This seems to be interrelated with women inherently being more uncertain than men when choosing from a choice set. Furthermore, we set up a novel theoretical model, which provides an explanation for gender specific susceptibility <b>to</b> <b>biases.</b> We conclude that biases can indeed be gender dependent. Hence, researchers should not simply disregard potential gender differences, but rather take them into account and examine the extent of them when performing surveys. Finally, we give suggestions for future research in this area. Choice Experiment, Gender, Hypothetical bias, Preference Uncertainty, Starting point bias...|$|R
