5|$|Cleanup efforts {{after the}} storm were hastened as Hurricane Gonzalo {{approached}} from the south, amid concerns that strewn debris from Fay could become airborne and exacerbate future destruction. The unanticipated heavy damage from Fay prompted residents to prepare more thoroughly for Gonzalo, as evidenced by stores reporting an influx of customers purchasing emergency supplies. Two hundred Bermuda Regiment soldiers helped clear debris and began repairing structural damage. On October 13, crews of soldiers put tarpaulins on 30 homes with roof damage, as well as distributing another 150 tarps <b>to</b> <b>homeowners.</b>|$|E
5|$|As of the {{election}} of Vincent Schoemehl as the city's youngest mayor ever in 1981, St. Louis's problems were more significant than many other rustbelt cities. Several major development projects incomplete and the city's economic base crumbling. However, Schoemehl developed two projects early in his three terms in office that assisted St. Louis: Operation Brightside provided city beautification through plantings and graffiti cleanup. Schoemehl also instituted a safety program to address crime, known as Operation SafeStreet, which blocked access to certain through streets and provided low-cost security measures <b>to</b> <b>homeowners.</b> Crime declined starting in 1984, and despite a small resurgence in 1989, continued to decline through the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Human {{attitudes toward}} insects are often negative, {{reinforced}} by sensationalism in the media. This {{has produced a}} society that attempts to eliminate insects from daily life. For example, nearly 75 million pounds of broad-spectrum insecticides are manufactured and sold each year for use in American homes and gardens. Annual revenues from insecticide sales <b>to</b> <b>homeowners</b> exceeded $450 million in 2004. Out of the roughly a million species of insects described so far, not more than 1,000 {{can be regarded as}} serious pests, and less than 10,000 (about 1%) are even occasional pests. Yet not one species of insect has been permanently eradicated through the use of pesticides. Instead, at least 1,000 species have developed field resistance to pesticides, and extensive harm has been done to beneficial insects including pollinators such as bees.|$|E

The decision was endorsed by the Toronto Industry Network.

25|$|When on the ground, {{the team}} {{found that many}} {{residents}} had not flushed their plumbing systems despite being given permission days before their arrival. Contaminated water remained in homeowner plumbing systems, leaving it to contact plumbing materials such as pipes, valves, gaskets, and joints. Homeowners they spoke with explained that they had refused to flush because of reports they heard from friends that odors caused by flushing could cause negative health impacts. Many homeowners stated no intention of flushing for the foreseeable future. In response, the research team modified the flushing protocol that was issued <b>to</b> <b>homeowners</b> and helped flush residences with these more health protective measures.|$|E

25|$|After {{learning}} of the plan, a group of Anaheim Island residents formed the West Island Neighbors Group and circulated a petition opposing annexation. Opponents of the plan argued that annexation would result in increased taxes and public utility rates, and new municipal fees and permit requirements; that city zoning regulations would prevent residents from keeping farm animals and running kennels; that residents would be inconvenienced by the designation of new street addresses for their homes; that more stringent building code enforcement and requirements for sewer hookups would result in excessive expense <b>to</b> <b>homeowners</b> with limited incomes; and that property might be confiscated for redevelopment. Residents of La Colonia expressed particular concern that annexation would {{pave the way for}} the destruction of their neighborhood through gentrification, the fate of old county barrios such as La Conga, razed and replaced with a parking lot for Anaheim's Glover Stadium. Concerned with the prospect of a shrinking patrol area, the Association of Orange County Deputy Sheriffs mailed a flier opposing annexation to area residents. The anti-annexation petition eventually gathered 1,944 signatures, and the plan was defeated in October 2005.|$|E

2500|$|In {{spite of}} his broken promise to reopen the hospital, Schoemehl gained {{popularity}} through a city beautification project known as [...] "Operation Brightside". Operation Brightside officers were political appointees and {{not part of the}} traditional civil service, but they succeeded in planting street trees and flowers (particularly daffodils and tulips) along major streets, distributing plants <b>to</b> <b>homeowners,</b> and providing summer jobs to city youth picking up litter in alleyways. Schoemehl also instituted a safety program to address city crime, starting in 1984. The program, known as Operation SafeStreet, provided low cost or free security measures, such as dead bolts, bars for windows, and The Club. In addition to providing security <b>to</b> <b>homeowners,</b> Schoemehl ordered the blocking of several through streets in neighborhoods around the city to prevent cruising and drug-dealing. Crime declined in targeted neighborhoods by an average of 30 percent, and crime continued to decline in the 1980s until a rise in auto thefts in 1989 increased overall crime rates in the city for that year.|$|E
