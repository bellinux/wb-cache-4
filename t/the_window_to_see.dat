5|$|Back at her apartment, Scully runs a {{background}} check of Doggett on her computer, learning about his background as a former NYPD detective. She feels sick and leaves the computer, and later on calls her mom, Margaret (Sheila Larken). When she realizes her phone is tapped, she looks outside <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if anyone is out there. She angrily calls Doggett to protest him monitoring her phone conversations, which he seems genuinely surprised about. She notices a mysterious man and runs into the hall to pursue him, but meets her landlord Mr. Coeben who tells {{her that he had}} seen Mulder.|$|E
500|$|On Wednesday, March 3, 1993, in Rancho Viejo, Texas, an {{affluent}} community {{just north of}} Brownsville, Fischer woke up early {{to get ready for}} school. Just before 7:00a.m., he went to the garage and reversed his mother's car into the circular driveway at his home at 3 Cortez Avenue. He then walked toward {{the corner of the house}} and grabbed a garden hose to spray water on the car's windows, which were covered in dust. As he sprayed the car, someone came from behind and shot him twice at point-blank range with what would later be identified as a [...]38 Super pistol. One of the shots penetrated his chest and the others his brain. Fischer's mother looked out <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> what had happened, thinking the noise came from one of the house's palm tree branches falling on the roof, or that the car had backfired. She did not see the car, and thought that perhaps her son had gone to a convenience store to pick up something, but Fischer's brother Eric told her he could see the car parked on the driveway.|$|E
2500|$|The first sketch {{to appear}} on television, in the pilot episode, Bruce McCulloch drinks some water and looks out <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> three millionaires (Foley, McDonald, and Thompson) rummaging through his garbage cans out his window. [...] He shouts, [...] "Hey you millionaires! [...] Get out of that garbage!", and the three run away. [...] The Chicago comedy trio, Hey You Millionaires, took their name from this sketch.|$|E
6000|$|They {{went back}} a short distance, and Cuthbert {{spoke to a}} man {{standing}} at his door. [...] "This lady and myself are English," [...] he said, [...] "would you allow us {{to go up and}} stand at one of <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> what is going on?" ...|$|R
6000|$|All {{the country}} people were {{standing}} round the King's throne, and were crowded together in thick masses {{almost out of}} <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> Princess receive the suitors; and as each one {{came into the room}} all his fine phrases went out like a candle! ...|$|R
50|$|In {{the parking}} lot, San Marco shot Ze Fairchild, 37, {{in the head}} with a handgun. She turned to Maleka Higgins and shot her at point-blank range. She then shot Nicola Grant. Some workers, after hearing gunshots, went <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> what was happening. San Marco turned to them and smiled.|$|R
2500|$|Chan-wook {{stated that}} he named the main {{character}} Oh Daesu [...] "to remind the viewer of Oedipus." [...] In one of the film's iconic shots, Yoo Ji-tae, who played Woo-jin, strikes an extraordinary yoga pose. Park Chan-wook said he designed this pose to convey [...] "the image of Apollo." [...] It was Apollo's prophecy that revealed Oedipus' fate in Sophocles' Oedipus the King. The link to Oedipus Rex is only a minor element in most English-language criticism of the movie, while Koreans have made it a central theme. Sung Hee Kim wrote [...] "Family seen through Greek tragedy and Korean movie – Oedipus the King and Old Boy." [...] Kim Kyungae offers a different analysis, with Dae-su and Woo-jin both representing Oedipus. [...] Besides the theme of unknown incest revealed, Oedipus gouges his eyes out to avoid seeing a world that despises the truth, while Oh Dae-su cuts off his tongue to avoid revealing the truth to his world. More parallels with Greek tragedy include the fact that Lee Woo-jin looks relatively young as compared to Oh Dae-su when {{they are supposed to}} be contemporaries at school, which makes Lee Woo-jin look like an immortal Greek god whereas Oh Dae-su is merely an aged mortal. The incest scene between Lee Woo-jin and his sister is also very striking and beautifully shot, as Greek gods are renown for their incestuous license (e.g. Zeus and Hera, and many more), and the way Oh Dae-Su peeps through <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> their incestuous love has an ethereal feel to it, as if he were a lowly mortal in the aether (divine realm of Greek gods) witnessing something which he should not have seen and hence trespassing the boundaries between gods and men, which is another classic act of hubris in Greek tragedy which leads to divine intervention and human punishment. Indeed, throughout the movie Lee Woo-jin is portrayed as an obscenely rich young man who lives in a lofty tower and is omnipresent due to having placed ear bugs on Oh Dae-Su and co, which again furthers the parallel between his character and the secrecy of Greek gods. One could also mention Mido, who throughout the movie comes across as a strong-willed, young and innocent girl, which is not too far from Sophocles' Antigone, Oedipus' daughter, who, though she does not commit incest with her father, remains faithful and loyal to him which reminds us of the bittersweet ending where Mido reunites with Oh Dae-Su and takes care of him in the wilderness (cf Oedipus at Colonus, the second installment of the Oedipus trilogy straightafter Oedipus Tyrannus). Another interesting character is the hypnotist, who, apart from being able to hypnotise people, also has the power to make people fall in love (e.g. Oh and Mido), which is characteristic of the power of Aphrodite, the goddess of love, whose classic act is to make Paris and Helen fall in love before and during the Trojan War.|$|E
60|$|Jonas and all {{his school}} rose, and went to <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>to</b> <b>see.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Very much, indeed," [...] said Bob, with {{exceeding}} gravity, {{and with}} his eye upon <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> whether his father had passed.|$|E
60|$|Ingua, overhearing his ejaculation, came <b>to</b> <b>the</b> open <b>window</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> {{what had}} caused it.|$|R
60|$|Somerset {{retired to}} the {{chambers}} of antique lumber, {{keeping an eye}} upon <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if she re-entered the carriage and resumed her journey to Markton. But when the horses had been standing a long time the carriage was driven round to the stables. Then {{she was not going}} to the vegetable show. That was rather curious, seeing that she had only come back for something forgotten.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Scully," [...] said she, popping {{her head}} out of window and smiling in a most {{engaging}} way, [...] "I {{want to speak to}} you, on something very particular INDEED"--and she held him out her hand. Scully pressed it most tenderly: he hoped all heads in Bedford Row were at <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him. [...] "I can't ask you into the carriage, for you see the governess is with me, and I want to talk secrets to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|Daisy went to <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him go, and then, {{throwing}} up her arms, she fell on her knees, weeping, weeping, and she cried,-- ...|$|E
60|$|His absence {{had already}} alarmed them, and his sister, having stopped the carriage, had her neck {{stretched}} out of <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> where he was.|$|E
60|$|The boys went {{directly}} to their rooms {{when they arrived at}} the hotel, and while Mr. George was unstrapping and opening his valise, Waldron and Rollo went to look out at <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> what they could see.|$|E
6000|$|Suddenly he saw lights {{appear at}} {{five or six}} points in the distance, and, putting his head out, {{he thought he could}} hear distant cries and shouts. The lights grew brighter, and soon broad tongues of flame shot up. Shouts at once arose from the guards without. Some of the revellers hearing these went <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> what was happening, and gave a cry of alarm. [...] "Sweyn, we must be attacked; fires are rising in the {{outskirts}} of the town." ...|$|R
50|$|Neighbours {{went to the}} police, and {{inspector}} Harry Mann conducted inquiries. Mann heard repeated {{references to}} the children's having their throats painted, and Rendell's apparent indifference to their pain. One neighbour claimed he often peeked in <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Rendell {{standing in front of}} the screaming victim, rocking back and forth as if in ecstasy. Some also claimed to have witnessed her masturbating. Mann located George Morris, who had claimed to have run away because his stepmother had killed his siblings and was trying to poison him with spirits of salts (i.e. hydrochloric acid).|$|R
60|$|The sunrise {{found the}} bishop {{with his head}} and {{shoulders}} out of <b>the</b> <b>window</b> trying <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that blackbird. He just {{wanted to look at}} it. He was persuaded it was a quite exceptional blackbird.|$|R
60|$|When {{the boys}} rose the next morning, {{the first thing}} was to look out of <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> what the promise was in respect to the weather. It was not raining, but the sky was {{overcast}} and heavy.|$|E
6000|$|Gride gladly availed {{himself of}} the pretext for going to <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>to</b> <b>see.</b> Ralph, keeping his face {{steadily}} the other way, tore at his shirt with the hand which he had thrust into his breast, and muttered in a hoarse whisper: ...|$|E
60|$|That promise sent Nelly happily away to bed, only {{stopping}} to pop {{her head out}} of <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if it {{was likely to be}} a fair day to-morrow, and to tell Tony about the new plan as he passed below.|$|E
60|$|And then {{he laughed}} so heartily {{that the girl}} looked out of <b>the</b> <b>window</b> again <b>to</b> <b>see</b> {{what in the world}} he was doing. He had his hat in his hand and was whacking his thigh with it.|$|R
5000|$|The {{second section}} reprises and {{therefore}} emphasizes the decision taken in Section 1. It also marks the “beginning of her {{next phase of}} activity - sitting at her upstairs <b>window,</b> searching <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> opposite <b>to</b> <b>see</b> another ‘one living soul … like herself.’” ...|$|R
6000|$|Scarcely {{the year}} had flown. One night [...] The Commandante awoke in fright, [...] Hearing below his casement's bar [...] The {{well-known}} twang of the Don's guitar; [...] And rushed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> just <b>to</b> <b>see</b> [...] His wife a-swoon on the balcony.|$|R
60|$|After it {{was over}} they sat down by the fire and began to chat with the farmer's wife, a motherly {{creature}} {{of the same age}} as her husband. Every five minutes Matt would walk to <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if the farmer was yet returning.|$|E
6000|$|... "Clarissa!" [...] cry all {{the women}} in a breath, and run to <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> their {{favourite}} writer. By this time the sun was sunk, the stars were twinkling overhead, and the footman came and lighted the candles in the Baroness's room opposite our spies.|$|E
6000|$|My tea {{is nearly}} ready {{and the sun}} has left the sky. [...] It's time to take <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Leerie going by; [...] For every night at teatime and before you take your seat, [...] With lantern and with ladder he comes posting up the street.|$|E
60|$|The {{striking}} of {{two o'clock}} seemed to freshen us all up. Whatever shadows had been settling over us {{during the long}} hours preceding seemed to lift at once; and we went about our separate duties alert and with alacrity. We looked first <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that they were closed, and we got ready our respirators {{to put them on}} when the time should be close at hand. We had from the first arranged to use them for we did not know whether some noxious fume might not come from the magic coffer when it should be opened. Somehow, it never seemed to occur to any of us that there was any doubt as to its opening.|$|R
50|$|Max is a {{teenager}} mourning his Grandpa's death and is visited by his girlfriend Sammy. Sammy's mom is a drunkard, and her hobby is making prank {{calls to the}} police.

But Max learns that Zach, along with his friends Julie, Carter, and Tracy, is planning to go to Open Hearth and throw a rock through one of <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if <b>the</b> myth is true. Max and Sammy decide to follow them and take pictures so he can have his revenge. They take a short cut through the woods on their bikes, where they kiss for the first time.|$|R
50|$|In 1845 {{the church}} {{received}} new stained glass <b>windows</b> depicting <b>the</b> Emperors Frederick Barbarossa, Konrad III, Rudolf von Habsburg, Albrecht III.

60|$|Rushing to <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if {{the flood}} had quite covered the steps, {{and cut off}} all retreat, the friends were comforted to observe no signs of water, except that half-frozen in the basin of the {{fountain}} above which leaned their favourite old Triton, with an icicle {{on the end of}} his nose.|$|E
60|$|He got up {{presently}} {{and wrapped}} himself about with Mr. Butteridge's overcoat {{and all the}} blankets, for the air was very keen. Then he peeped out of <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a grey dawn breaking over clouds, then turned up his light and bolted his door, sat down to the table, and produced his chest-protector.|$|E
60|$|The {{children}} clustered at <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him {{set out on}} this momentous errand, and {{he often}} looked back waving his umbrella at them, till he vanished round the corner, with a reassuring pat on the pocket out of which dear Do and Flo popped their heads for {{a last look at}} their sweet home.|$|E
6000|$|... "And I shrive you, sir, and bid {{good fortune}} go with you," [...] {{answered}} the Doctor. Perhaps he and Mrs. Portman and Miss Myra, as they sate with their friend, the Dean's lady, in her drawing-room, looked {{up more than}} once at <b>the</b> enemy's <b>window</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if they could perceive any signs of the combat.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I will stay," [...] said Ladislaw, {{shaking his}} head backward, rising and going towards <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> as if <b>to</b> <b>see</b> whether the rain had ceased.|$|R
5000|$|Leonard Washington (played by Chappelle) - Washington first {{appeared}} in the first season sketch Trading Spouses, wherein he acted as the patriarch of a white family for a month. Notably, when entering rooms unfamiliar to him, Washington will look out <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if he is being followed. He also expressed his displeasure that many white families do not use washcloths when taking a shower or bath. One of the only things that can make Leonard Washington back down is being shot. When asked for his hometown in the World Series of Dice sketch, Washington replied, [...] "Where I'm from? A little town called none ya goddamn bidness." [...] He has a wife and a son, T-Mart. He is seemingly unaware of white culture, unknowing of Renée Zellweger (as he stated in [...] "Trading Spouses" [...] after reading [...] "White People Magazine").|$|R
