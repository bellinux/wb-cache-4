His brother, Roderick, was in California the night Bruce died, yet claimed <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>from</b> a dream exactly what had happened. Roderick awoke screaming and rushed to tell his grandmother about his nightmare. The next morning, a cable arrived with the news of Bruce's death.|$|E
5|$|After {{learning}} more about Devarakota and Sashi's tyranny, Harsha announces that he will adopt the village and develop it. While he works to improve conditions in the village, Ratnam asks Sashi also to develop the village, partly {{to win in the}} upcoming elections, but he remains silent regarding his intention to gain credit for doing so. At the same time, Harsha comes <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>from</b> Rao that, as a young man, Ravikanth, wishing, as Harsha does now, to see the village developed, established a dairy farm for the locals' welfare. After the farm was set up, Ratnam and Sashi set it on fire, causing the death of many, and Ravikanth was blamed for the fire, insulted, and arrested. He walked out of the village, moved to the city, and went on to acquire much wealth.|$|E
5|$|The {{story begins}} where The Immortals of Meluha ended. Shiva, the fabled {{savior of the}} land of Meluha, rushes to save his wife Sati from the Naga, the {{supposed}} killer of Shiva's friend Brahaspati. The Naga escapes, leaving behind coins with strange engravings. After consulting with Sati's father Daksha and Dilipa, the king of Ayodhya, they come to know that the coin belongs to King Chandraketu, the ruler {{of the land of}} Branga in eastern India. Shiva and Sati travel to Kashi, where a community of Brangas inhabit, in order to get more information on the Nagas. They are accompanied in their journey by Shiva's General Parvateshwar, his associates Nandi and Veerbhadra, Ayurvati the doctor, and Bhagirath and Anandamayi, the prince and princess of Ayodhya. At Kashi, Parvateshwar gets mortally injured while trying to pacify a riot at the Branga community. The Branga leader Divodas administers a medicine on Parvateshwar; it works and the General is healed, but Shiva comes <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>from</b> Ayurvati that it contains herbs which is only available at Panchavati, the capital of the Nagas. He consults with Divodas and comes to know that Branga suffers from a mortal plague, which has led them to ally with the Nagas, in return for benefits. Shiva decides to travel to Branga but Divodas informs him that to reach there special ships need to be made, which would take about six months.|$|E

25|$|Former Minister for Social Affairs Mr Othman Wok in his {{autobiography}} mentioned {{that he had come}} <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>from</b> one of the reporters from the Utsan Melayu that the latter had already known about the potential riots even before the outbreak of the riots which raises the suspicions of the UNMO leaders of orchestrating this riot. Othman also makes references to some key important political meetings which took place among the Malay community in Singapore the politicians in Singapore to express their grievances. Accounts from the meetings prove that the Malays in Singapore had no major grievances and that UMNO’s Secretary-General Syed Ja’afar was responsible for instigating them. Some of the matters brought up by the Malay community included infrastructural issues that Malay schools faced and these issues were contrary to what the UMNO and Utusan Melayu had portrayed.|$|E
25|$|In 1976, Robert K. G. Temple wrote a {{book called}} The Sirius Mystery arguing that the Dogon's system reveals precise {{knowledge}} of cosmological facts known only by the development of modern astronomy, since they appear <b>to</b> <b>know,</b> <b>from</b> Griaule and Dieterlen's account, that Sirius is part of a binary star system, whose second star, Sirius B, a white dwarf, is however completely invisible to the human eye (just as Digitaria has the smallest grain known to the Dogon) and that it takes 50 years to complete its orbit. The existence of Sirius B had only been inferred to exist through mathematical calculations undertaken by Friedrich Bessel in 1844. Temple then argued that the Dogon's information, if traced back to ancient Egyptian sources and myth, indicates an extraterrestrial transmission of knowledge of the stars. Neither Griaule nor Dieterlen had ever made such bold claims about a putative esoteric source for the Dogon's knowledge.|$|E

[...] Critics of the two non-aggression pacts have accused Piłsudski of underestimating Hitler's aggressiveness and of giving Germany time to rearm; and of allowing Stalin to eliminate opposition—primarily in Ukraine—that had been supported by Piłsudski's Promethean program.|$|E
500|$|All of {{the episodes}} open with Bathurst portraying Mark Taylor, a sitcom writer, {{apparently}} performing stand-up {{in a small}} comedy club. These performances are fantasy sequences, playing out in the character's mind and portraying his internal creative processes as comedic monologues; these monologues mainly employ material from the character's failing marriage and are intended to show that [...] "he thinks in punchlines, in comedy". Episodes regularly cut back to these fantasy performances, which usually open with the signature line: [...] "My wife left me...". Moffat felt that audiences needed <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>from</b> the start that the relationship would not survive. However, it was unclear to some viewers that the fantasy sequences were set in the writer's mind; many journalists reported that the character Mark was a stand-up comic, not a sitcom writer.|$|E
500|$|Sukhdev Sandhu of The Daily Telegraph {{stated that}} [...] "Wolverine is an {{artificial}} stimulus package {{of the most}} unsatisfying kind. Aggressively advertised and hyped to the hills, it will no doubt attract full houses at first; after that though, when word-of-mouth buzz-kill goes into overdrive, there’s bound to be widespread deflation and a palpable feeling of being conned." [...] Similarly, Orlando Parfitt of IGN (UK) praised the performances of the actors and the action scenes, but stated that the film felt underdeveloped: [...] "There's an enjoyable time to be had with Wolverine, but it's also somewhat unsatisfying." [...] Furthermore, Scott Mendelson of The Huffington Post gave the film a grade of [...] "D", noting that [...] "Wolverine was the lead character of [...] films, and we've already learned everything we need <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>from</b> the films in said franchise," [...] adding that [...] "the extra information given here actually serves to make the character of Logan/Wolverine less interesting." [...] Steven Rea also felt that the film injured the character by proving that [...] "how the hero acquired his special powers {{turns out to be}} a whole lot less interesting than what he does with them", while also being [...] "a mash-up of meaningless combat sequences (meaningless because Logan/Wolverine is just about unstoppable), sub-par visual effects, template backstory, and some goofy Liev Schreiber-as-a-villain thespianizing".|$|E

500|$|Besides word {{of mouth}} and {{opinions}} in letters, {{there were only a}} few published contemporary reviews. The writer and journalist John Stoddart (1773–1856), in a review of Lyrical Ballads, described [...] "Strange fits" [...] and [...] "She dwelt" [...] as [...] "the most singular specimens of unpretending, yet irresistible pathos". An anonymous review of Poems in Two Volumes in 1807 had a less positive opinion about [...] "I travell'd": [...] "Another string of flat lines about Lucy is succeeded by an ode to Duty". Critic Francis Jeffrey (1773–1850) claimed that, in [...] "Strange fits", [...] "Mr Wordsworth, however, has thought fit to compose a piece, illustrating this copious subject by one single thought. A lover trots away to see his mistress one fine evening, staring all the way at the moon: when he comes to her door, 'O mercy! to myself I cried, / If Lucy should be dead!' And there the poem ends!" [...] On [...] "A slumber did my spirit seal", Wordsworth's friend Thomas Powell wrote that the poem [...] "stands by itself, and is without title prefixed, yet we are <b>to</b> <b>know,</b> <b>from</b> the penetration of Mr. Wordsworth's admirers, that it is a sequel to the other deep poems that precede it, and is about one Lucy, who is dead. From the table of contents, however, we are informed by the author that it is about 'A Slumber;' for this is the actual title which he has condescended to give it, to put us out of pain as to what it is about." ...|$|E

This leads to a problem where the operator can generate an accurate measurement, but the actual fix might be at a wide variety of locations. Decca referred to these as [...] "lanes", and used a mechanical system to keep track of them.|$|E
