5|$|The committee's {{investigation}} {{lasted from}} May 1911 to April 1912. At its conclusion, the committee split along party lines. Stanley authored the majority report which condemned alleged price fixing by U.S. Steel and censured President Theodore Roosevelt {{for his role}} in U.S. Steel's purchase of the Tennessee Coal and Iron Company. The minority report, authored by Republican Augustus P. Gardner, absolved Roosevelt and downplayed the price fixing charges. Stanley's report also recommended a number of changes to strengthen the Sherman Anti-Trust Act. Though his recommendations were not enacted into law during his time in the House, many of them were eventually included in <b>the</b> <b>Clayton</b> Antitrust Act.|$|E
5|$|Adam Charles Clayton, {{the oldest}} child of Brian and Jo Clayton, {{was born on}} 13 March 1960 in Chinnor, Oxfordshire, England. His father was a pilot with the Royal Air Force, who moved into civil aviation, {{and his mother was}} a former airline stewardess. When he was 4 years old, Clayton's father worked in Kenya as a pilot with East African Airways, the family being {{resident}} in Nairobi (Clayton regards this as the happiest period of his childhood). In 1965, the family moved to Malahide, County Dublin in the Republic of Ireland, where Clayton's brother Sebastian was born. <b>The</b> <b>Clayton</b> family became friends with the Evans family (including their son David Evans ("The Edge"), who would later co-found the band U2 with Clayton).|$|E
5|$|Augustus Owsley Stanley I (May 21, 1867 – August 12, 1958) was an American {{politician}} {{from the}} US state of Kentucky. A Democrat, {{he served as}} the 38th Governor of Kentucky and also represented the state in both the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate. From 1903 to 1915, Stanley represented Kentucky's 2nd congressional district in the House of Representatives, where he gained {{a reputation as a}} progressive reformer. Beginning in 1904, he called for an antitrust investigation of the American Tobacco Company, claiming they were a monopsony that drove down prices for the tobacco farmers of his district. As a result of his investigation, the Supreme Court of the United States broke up the American Tobacco Company in 1911. Stanley also chaired a committee that conducted an antitrust investigation of U.S. Steel, which brought him national acclaim. Many of his ideas were incorporated into <b>the</b> <b>Clayton</b> Antitrust Act.|$|E

5|$|Initially conservative, {{working with}} Wilson (who was elected president) {{inspired}} Barkley {{to become more}} liberal. On April 24, 1912, he first spoke on the House floor, favoring the administration-backed Underwood–Simmons Tariff Act which lowered tariffs on foreign goods. He endorsed Wilson's New Freedom agenda, including the 1913 Federal Reserve Act and the 1914 Federal Trade Commission Act. Because of {{his support for the}} administration, he was assigned to the powerful Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee and became the first freshman to preside over a session of the House. As a member of the Interstate Commerce Commission, he supported <b>the</b> <b>Clayton</b> Antitrust Act and sought to end child labor in interstate commerce through the Keating–Owen Act in 1916. He also supported measures to extend credit to and fund road improvements in rural areas.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Clayton</b> campus covers an area over 1.1km² and is {{the largest}} of the Monash campuses. Clayton is the {{flagship}} campus for Monash, demanding higher ATAR (Australian Tertiary Admission Rank) scores than all the other campuses, with the exception of Parkville. Clayton is home to the faculties of Arts, Business & Economics, Education, Engineering, IT, Law, Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences and Science. <b>The</b> <b>Clayton</b> campus has its own suburb and postcode (3800).|$|E

50|$|In 1948, <b>the</b> Winant <b>Clayton</b> Volunteers {{formed in}} honor of Winant and the Reverend Philip “Tubby” <b>Clayton,</b> {{organizer}} of <b>the</b> Toc H Christian charity in the First World War. Initially, American volunteers came to London to help British families rebuild churches and community centers damaged during World War II. In 1959 the exchange was reciprocated with Winant volunteers travelling from America to England while <b>the</b> <b>Claytons</b> go from England {{to work in the}} United States.|$|R
60|$|There {{was a great}} {{quantity}} and variety of stuff, as <b>the</b> <b>Claytons</b> had expected a possible five to eight years' residence in their new home. Thus, {{in addition to the}} many necessities they had brought, there were also many luxuries.|$|R
60|$|The other {{officers}} were coarse, illiterate fellows, but little above the villainous crew they bullied, and were only too glad to avoid social intercourse with the polished English noble and his lady, so that <b>the</b> <b>Claytons</b> were left {{very much to}} themselves.|$|R
25|$|A {{good faith}} belief, {{rather than an}} {{absolute}} certainty, that a price concession is being offered to meet an equally low price offered by a competitor suffices to invoke the defense available under § 2(b) of <b>the</b> <b>Clayton</b> Act.|$|E
25|$|Facilities at Monash {{are often}} used by a range of {{professional}} sporting teams. For example, the Australia national association football team, the Socceroos, used <b>the</b> <b>Clayton</b> campus and trained on-site in South Africa for the 2010 FIFA World Cup.|$|E
25|$|The {{campus is}} also home to a number of halls of residence, colleges and other on-campus {{accommodation}} that house several thousand students.

25|$|At {{the outset}} the railway was {{equipped}} with four-wheeled 8-seater coaches designed by Henry Greenly and his son Kenneth. 117 of these had been built by 1928. With only half height doors and no glazing except in the end bulkheads these were totally unsuitable for winter operation, especially to Dungeness. In 1928 the railway took delivery of eight fully enclosed 12-seat bogie coaches built by <b>the</b> <b>Clayton</b> Carriage & Wagon Company of Lincoln which incorporated electric lighting and steam heating.|$|E
25|$|For longshoremen nationwide, and {{especially}} {{for those in the}} Port of New York, this was an era of great contradiction, where landmark legal advances to protect the rights and safety of workers stood {{in stark contrast to the}} actual conditions for longshoremen. The United States was the only country with a large foreign commerce without any laws to protect the safety of its longshoremen. Even <b>the</b> <b>Clayton</b> Antitrust Act of 1914, which legalized strikes, boycotts, and peaceful picketing did little to improve actual working conditions for longshoremen.|$|E
25|$|NY180 was {{assigned}} {{as part of}} the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York to the portion of its routing north of NY12 in Clayton. At the same time, a connector between Chaumont and <b>the</b> <b>Clayton</b> hamlet of Depauville was designated as NY179 while the segment of what is now NY180 between the Hounsfield hamlet of Baggs Corner and NY12E (now NY12F) south of Dexter became NY409.
