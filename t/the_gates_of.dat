50|$|In 1517, the Ottoman Turks {{conquered the}} Mamluk Sultanate in Egypt and Syria, {{during the reign}} of Selim I. As territories of the Mamluk Sultanate, the Hijaz, {{including}} Jeddah and the holy city of Mecca, passed into Ottoman possession. The Ottomans rebuilt the weak walls of Jeddah in 1525 following their victory over the Lopo Soares de Albergaria's Armada in the Red Sea. The new Turkish wall included six watchtowers and six city gates. They were constructed to defend against the Portuguese attack. <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> six <b>gates,</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> Mecca was <b>the</b> eastern <b>gate</b> and <b>the</b> <b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> Al-Magharibah, facing <b>the</b> port, was <b>the</b> western <b>gate.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> Sharif faced south. <b>The</b> other <b>gates</b> were <b>the</b> <b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> Al-Bunt, <b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> Al-Sham (also called <b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> Al-Sharaf) and <b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> Medina, facing north. The Turks also built The Qishla of Jeddah, a small castle for the city soldiers. In the 19th century these seven gates were minimized into four giant gates with four towers. These giant <b>gates</b> were <b>the</b> <b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> Sham to <b>the</b> north, <b>the</b> <b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> Mecca to <b>the</b> east, <b>the</b> <b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> Sharif to <b>the</b> south, and <b>the</b> <b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> Al-Magharibah on <b>the</b> sea side.|$|R

And when they had closed them, no one could get out anywhere.|$|R
5|$|Van Millingen {{identifies}} this gate {{with the}} early Byzantine Gate of Melantias (Πόρτα Μελαντιάδος), but more recent scholars have proposed {{the identification of the}} latter with one of <b>the</b> <b>gates</b> <b>of</b> the city's original Constantinian Wall (see above).|$|E
5|$|While at Ashworth, in 2001 Brady wrote <b>The</b> <b>Gates</b> <b>of</b> Janus, {{which was}} {{published}} by Feral House, an underground US publisher. The book, Brady's analysis of serial murder and specific serial killers, sparked outrage when announced in Britain.|$|E
5|$|A {{commission}} {{to create a}} portal for Paris' planned Museum of Decorative Arts was awarded to Rodin in 1880. Although the museum was never built, Rodin worked throughout his life on <b>The</b> <b>Gates</b> <b>of</b> Hell, a monumental sculptural group depicting scenes from Dante's Inferno in high relief. Often lacking a clear conception of his major works, Rodin compensated with hard work and a striving for perfection.|$|E

500|$|The weakest {{section of}} the wall was the {{so-called}} Mesoteichion (Μεσοτείχιον, [...] "Middle Wall"). Modern scholars are not in agreement over the extent of {{this portion of the}} wall, which has been variously defined from as narrowly as the stretch between <b>the</b> <b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> St. Romanus and <b>the</b> Fifth Military <b>Gate</b> (A.M. Schneider) to as broad as from <b>the</b> <b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> Rhegion to <b>the</b> Fifth Military <b>Gate</b> (B. Tsangadas) or from <b>the</b> <b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> St. Romanus to <b>the</b> <b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> Adrianople (A. van Millingen).|$|R
5000|$|Two main {{entrance}} <b>gates</b> to <b>the</b> city, <b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> Sens and <b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> Joigny. <b>The</b> <b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> Joigny or Porte de Joigny was rebuilt in the 16th century; <b>the</b> <b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> Sens, or Porte de Sens, predates it by {{three hundred years}} and is similar in appearance.|$|R
5|$|Although {{a useful}} {{deterrent}} against raids, at several points throughout its history the Great Wall failed to stop enemies, including in 1644 when the Manchu Qing marched through <b>the</b> <b>gates</b> <b>of</b> Shanhai Pass and replaced {{the most ardent}} of the wall-building dynasties, the Ming, as rulers of China.|$|E
5|$|Although {{busy with}} <b>The</b> <b>Gates</b> <b>of</b> Hell, Rodin won other commissions. He pursued an {{opportunity}} to create a historical monument for the town of Calais. For a monument to French author Honoré de Balzac, Rodin was chosen in 1891. His execution of both sculptures clashed with traditional tastes, and met {{with varying degrees of}} disapproval from the organizations that sponsored the commissions. Still, Rodin was gaining support from diverse sources that propelled him toward fame.|$|E
5|$|Andrés Torrón of El Observador noted a {{similarity}} between Almendra and Pink Floyd's 1967 album, The Piper at <b>the</b> <b>Gates</b> <b>of</b> Dawn.

500|$|<b>The</b> {{last known}} <b>gate</b> is <b>the</b> <b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> Melantias ( [...] , Porta tēs Melantiados), whose {{location}} is also debated. Van Millingen considered {{it to be}} a <b>gate</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Theodosian Wall (<b>the</b> Pege <b>Gate),</b> while more recently, Janin and Mango have refuted this, suggesting that it was located on the Constantinian Wall. Again however, while Mango identifies it with <b>the</b> <b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Prodromos, Janin considers the name to have been a corruption of the ta Meltiadou quarter, and places <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> to <b>the</b> west <b>of</b> the Mocius cistern. Other authors identified it with <b>the</b> <b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> Adrianople (A. M. Schneider) or with <b>the</b> <b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> Rhesios (A. J. Mordtmann).|$|R
5|$|Fifteen {{years after}} the fall of the Bulgarian capital Preslav, the victory at <b>the</b> <b>Gates</b> <b>of</b> Trajan {{extended}} the Bulgarian successes achieved since 976.

The memory of the great victory over Basil II was preserved thirty years later in the Bitola inscription of Ivan Vladislav (1015–1018), the son of Aron.|$|E
5|$|In 66, Tiridates visited Rome {{to receive}} his crown and was lavishly {{received}} by Nero, {{who used the}} occasion to boost his own popularity. He ordered <b>the</b> <b>gates</b> <b>of</b> the Temple of Janus to be shut, thus declaring that peace reigned throughout the Roman Empire.|$|E
5|$|Koppány was besieging Veszprém {{when he was}} {{informed}} of the arrival of Stephen's army. In the ensuing battle, Stephen won a decisive victory over his enemies.

50|$|It was {{designed}} in an elliptical shape and completed {{around the year}} 1690. The defensive structure was composed of 15 bastions, 15 curtains and 5 <b>gates.</b> <b>The</b> <b>gate</b> <b>of</b> Huamán was oriented towards the southwest {{and led to the}} village of the same name. <b>The</b> <b>gate</b> <b>of</b> Mansiche was in <b>the</b> north. <b>The</b> <b>gate</b> <b>of</b> Miraflores was to <b>the</b> northeast. <b>The</b> <b>gate</b> <b>of</b> la Sierra was towards the road leading to this region and finally <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> <b>of</b> Moche that gave access to people from the south. In 1942, on the space occupied by the Wall of Trujillo, España Avenue was built. The same as is currently around the area called Historic Centre of Trujillo.
