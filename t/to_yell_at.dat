Laurie ordered the British {{companies}} guarding the bridge to retreat across it. One officer then tried to pull up the loose planks of the bridge to impede the colonial advance, but Major Buttrick began <b>to</b> <b>yell</b> <b>at</b> the regulars to stop harming the bridge.

He {{arrives at the}} Flanders' house expecting to play golf, but Ned and his family get in their car and race off without him.

In the fifth inning of Game 4, with a Cincinnati player on second, Jackson fielded a single hit to left field and threw home. Chick Gandil, another leader of the fix, later admitted <b>to</b> <b>yelling</b> <b>at</b> Cicotte <b>to</b> intercept the throw. The run scored and the White Sox lost the game 2-0.

Annoyed, Claire confronts Phil about how he always makes her play the 'bad cop' role in their family and keeps the 'good cop' role for himself. He reluctantly agrees to switch roles with her. Claire takes Manny and Luke go-carting (although Phil had been quite keen to go), while Phil has to stay and make the girls clean their bathroom. The go-carting goes horribly as Claire, trying to be fun, crashes her cart into the boys, and makes them order large quantities of food. While driving home, Luke gets sick from drinking a milkshake he did not want. Meanwhile, Phil goes berserk when the girls lie to him about cleaning the bathroom and jump on their car {{to stop them from}} leaving, before forcing them to clean the bathroom under his direct supervision and then he had them clean his bathroom. That evening, Phil and Claire admit that they cannot handle each other's natural parent roles, and agree to go back to normal.|$|E

Dr. Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) and Adamson continuously argue {{over the course of}} treatment for a patient, leading the patient's daughter <b>to</b> <b>yell</b> <b>at</b> them in disbelief. Angry about the revelation that Percy (who later apologized saying that they can be friends outside the hospital, but not inside) was using her, Stevens accidentally administers the wrong dialysis to a patient, making her an unviable candidate for the kidney transplant she was scheduled to receive. After arguing over surgical cases for the entirety of the day, Yang comes to the realization that she needs a cardiothoracic surgeon to work at the hospital.

500|$|Lawrence Tierney guest {{starred in}} the episode as Don Brodka. Another former show runner, Josh Weinstein, called Tierney's {{appearance}} [...] "the craziest guest star experience we ever had". In addition <b>to</b> <b>yelling</b> <b>at</b> and intimidating employees of the show, Tierney made unreasonable requests, such as abandoning his distinctive voice to do the part in a southern accent and refusing to perform lines {{if he did not}} [...] "get the jokes". Despite this, Oakley and Weinstein thought Tierney did a good job. Weinstein said, [...] "He certainly delivered and he's one of my favorite characters we have had [...]" [...] After Tierney's death, the episode [...] "The Old Man and the Key" [...] was dedicated to him.|$|R
60|$|Hardman, {{furious and}} imperious, never grasped the {{significance}} that had frozen Matthews. He was thick, arrogant. He {{had long been}} a power wherever he went. Yielding <b>to</b> rage he <b>yelled</b> <b>at</b> Pan.|$|R
25|$|Afterward, Two-Bit Matthews, another gang member, Ponyboy, and Johnny walk Cherry and Marcia home. Socs, Bob Sheldon and Randy Adderson {{see them}} and think the boys are {{trying to pick up}} their girlfriends. Cherry {{prevents}} a fight and the girls leave with Bob and Randy willingly.

50|$|The film {{opens with}} the final dress {{rehearsal}} before opening night, with the cast still forgetting lines, missing cues, and mishandling props. Lloyd is reduced <b>to</b> cajoling, <b>yelling</b> <b>at,</b> and pleading with them to get things right. Complicating matters are the personal problems and backstage relationships that have fostered jealousy and petty squabbling and intruded upon any professionalism this motley crew can muster.|$|R

50|$|Meetings at the Whitechapel Club {{would usually}} start around midnight. Because Jack the Ripper {{was never in}} attendance, {{meetings}} would be chaired by the Vice-President. Club meetings were very private, although guests very occasionally were brought. During meetings, people would tell stories, jokes, poems, or monologues. It was customary <b>to</b> <b>yell</b> insults <b>at</b> whoever rose {{to speak to the}} club. Throughout the meetings, members would drink heavily.|$|R
500|$|... "Alive and Schticking" [...] was {{performed}} live twice for viewers in the East and West coasts, with different jokes for each broadcast.

An audience member who was in attendance commented that Messing and Hayes [...] "were so bad at keeping a straight face" [...] during a dress rehearsal that Burrows had {{to get on the}} show's PA system <b>to</b> <b>yell</b> <b>at</b> them. After both telecasts were aired, Burrows revealed that McCormack, Messing, Hayes, Mullally, and Baldwin [...] "had a ball, but they also dreaded it." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviewer Alan Sepinwall {{also had}} mixed comments, {{comparing}} the episode to House and stating, [...] "And yet {{as much as}} Veronica was annoying me, as much as I wanted <b>to</b> <b>yell</b> <b>at</b> her for automatically jumping to conclusions with Weevil (more on that in a minute), this was maybe my favorite episode of the season. [...] Hell, they even had a cliffhanger ending to the mystery arc {{for the first time}} in forever. I dug it." [...] Price Peterson of TV.com gave a mostly negative review, writing, [...] "This episode was not the best! Not terrible by any means, but it felt lacking in certain ways, particularly when it came to the total lack of Piz and Dick. Where were they? Also this episode made it clear that Logan didn't have all that much to do on the show anymore." ...|$|E

Foster saw Inside Man as an opportunity to collaborate with Lee: [...] "Spike is somebody who always fascinated me, and I've loved his movies. I've always wanted to be involved in something he's making. Basically, I never thought I would because it didn't seem like his stories or subject matter were ever going to include me. So, I'm just as excited as I can be." [...] She described her character as a woman with [...] "a relaxed kind of witty quality to her. All the while being very strong, not having to raise her voice very much, not having <b>to</b> <b>yell</b> <b>at</b> anybody — she's got authority. There's seductiveness, a charm, if you will, to her ability to get into people's psyches that's been immensely fun to play. It all went way too fast for me." ...|$|E
5|$|In July 2008, Christian Bale was {{filming a}} scene in New Mexico for the film Terminator Salvation with actress Bryce Dallas Howard. The film's {{director}} of photography, Shane Hurlbut, walked into Bale's line of sight, and the actor proceeded <b>to</b> <b>yell</b> obscenities <b>at</b> Hurlbut. Bale said he would quit the film if Hurlbut repeated the error and was not subsequently fired. Hurlbut responded calmly and apologized several times to Bale, and continued shooting for seven hours after the incident.|$|R

500|$|During {{the height}} of the Daddies' popularity, Perry found the band's {{mainstream}} notoriety was causing an alienating effect on his personal life, claiming it to have negatively changed his relationships with friends and even subjected him to occasional heckling from strangers who recognized him in public. He would later recall, [...] "It's a total cliché, but [...] doesn't make you happy. There's a lot missing. Success has given people the right <b>to</b> <b>yell</b> <b>at</b> me on the street, but I don't really feel like it's given me any dignity". Already feeling burnt out from the Daddies' constant touring, Perry's frustration was only exacerbated by the media's persistent dismissal of the Daddies as a retro novelty act, though he later claimed to have felt pressured to maintain the image due to audience and media expectations. When the band began to face criticism and accusations of selling out from their Northwest fanbase, the Daddies fought to further push themselves away from their mainstream typecasting: in a 1999 interview, responding to their place in the swing scene, Perry retorted [...] " [...] unapologetically play ska right in the face {{of people who want to}} hear swing".|$|E
500|$|After {{giving advice}} to Liz, Tracy and Jenna spend the episode calling {{themselves}} [...] "The Problem Solvers" [...] giving the TGS crew advice on their lives. From {{the moment he}} arrives, Danny treats NBC page Kenneth Parcell politely and does not ask him to run any errands for him, a break from how Tracy and Jenna treat him. Danny explains to the two that lower-level people such as pages often rise up to positions {{where they would be}} the boss of actors such as themselves, and as a result, he is polite to avoid building bad relationships with potential future bosses. Danny even speculates that Kenneth could be running the network someday. Jenna initially dismisses the idea out-of-hand, but Tracy becomes concerned, and tells Kenneth that he doesn't want him to perform any more menial tasks for him; Jenna soon joins him. Meanwhile, Kenneth lets slip that he may have been alive forever. Kenneth becomes upset that he is losing his responsibilities and confronts Danny, driving him <b>to</b> <b>yell</b> <b>at</b> Kenneth. Danny, who is Canadian, has had a hard time pronouncing the word [...] "about", but after yelling at Kenneth, and saying [...] "about" [...] without his Canadian accent, thanks Kenneth for helping him.|$|E
2500|$|Fetus-X {{was named}} one of the best webcomics of 2004 by The Webcomics Examiner, who called it [...] "one of the sharpest {{political}} commentaries available.

50|$|Notwithstanding this setback, Derwall {{remained}} {{a highly regarded}} coach and Germany were still counted among the favourites for Euro 84, but their performance in France was not impressive and Derwall's team were eliminated in the first round. Public opinion in Germany turned against Derwall rapidly. It reached an absolute low point when people would begin <b>to</b> <b>yell</b> angrily <b>at</b> Derwall had they spotted him in public. Derwall {{in the end of}} what amounted to a public campaign was forced to resign his position, being replaced by the hitherto-untested Franz Beckenbauer who acted as team manager.|$|R
50|$|Visiting San Francisco, Kansas, New York City, Chicago, and Monticello/University of Virginia Levtich narrates {{the history}} of each object and {{includes}} a broader history of the time so viewers can understand its importance. Besides highlighting little known monuments, the other aspect that makes Up to Speed different is that Levitch converses with each monument, asking them questions about their role in history and their feelings about current developments. Each of these items speaks back to Speed with a unique and often equally quirky personality, some even going so far <b>to</b> <b>yell</b> profanities <b>at</b> him.|$|R
2500|$|For much of Eton's history, junior {{boys had}} to act as [...] "fags", or servants, to older boys. Their duties {{included}} cleaning, cooking, and running errands. A Library member was entitled <b>to</b> <b>yell</b> <b>at</b> any time and without notice, [...] "Boy, Up!" [...] or [...] "Boy, Queue!", and all first-year boys had to come running. The last boy to arrive was given the task. These practices, known as fagging, were partially phased out of most houses in the 1970s. Captains of House and Games still sometimes give tasks to first-year boys, such as collecting the mail from School Office.|$|E
2500|$|This was {{the first}} {{recording}} studio experience for McCready and Vedder.

[...] The song [...] "Hunger Strike" [...] became a duet between Cornell and Vedder. Cornell was having trouble with the vocals at practice, when Vedder stepped in. Cornell later said [...] "he sang half of that song not even knowing that I'd wanted the part to be there and he sang it exactly the way I was thinking about doing it, just instinctively".|$|E

50|$|Rodale {{is trying}} to talk Clarisse into letting him perform cunnilingus on her. An angry Zanzubar then tells Rodale to knock it off, calling Clarisse a cunt in the process. Clarisse takes {{exception}} to the comment and flips Zanzubar off, who then directs his anger at her and takes a wild swing, but knocks himself down in the process. Toho then tells him to stop, citing a previous fight between Zanzubar and Clarisse {{in which she was}} victorious. Sparta, much to Nathaniel’s chagrin, tells Toho to mind his own business, prompting the big man to open his straight-razor and slice himself across the chest, quickly stitching it back up. Zanzubar then takes <b>to</b> <b>yelling</b> <b>at</b> Rodale, showing off his fighting style. Rodale wants to fight him when Clarisse knocks him off his bench onto the ground. As Nathaniel tries to break up the fight, Sparta screams in his ear. In the middle of Zanzubar touting his own prowess, Rodale bites him on his Achilles tendon, causing him to lash out in reflex and accidentally punch Mrs. X in the face, knocking Baby X out of her hands. Alanzo gives her back her baby, then <b>yells</b> <b>at</b> Zanzubar for getting so riled up, who then spits in his face. Alanzo delightfully licks up part of the spit, taunting Zanzubar, who is about to strike as he is called from afar.|$|R
