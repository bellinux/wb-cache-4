5|$|One of {{the most}} {{distinctive}} aspects of the opening is that three of its elements change from episode to episode: Bart writes different things on the school chalkboard, Lisa plays different solos on her saxophone and different gags accompany the family as they enter <b>their</b> <b>living</b> room {{to sit on the}} couch.|$|E
5|$|The vast {{majority}} of refugees were motivated by economic concerns and sought to improve <b>their</b> <b>living</b> conditions and opportunities by migrating to the West. Events such as the crushing of the 1953 uprising, the imposition of collectivisation and East Germany's final economic crisis in the late 1980s prompted surges {{in the number of}} escape attempts.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the seaside}} location, few {{residents}} make <b>their</b> <b>living</b> on the sea, and fishing {{is not a}} major industry. In the early 1970s, when fish stocks ran low, a system of rotating access was developed to preserve this sector. This innovative system was part of Elinor Ostrom's research on economic governance which led to her 2009 Nobel Prize in Economics. In 2007, locals protested the establishment of some larger chain supermarkets and clothing stores, which have opened branches in Alanya.|$|E

5|$|Hardee {{was born}} in Lewisham, South East London, near the River Thames, and came {{from a long line}} of lightermen who earned <b>their</b> <b>living</b> on tugs pulling barges on the river. He was the eldest son of Frank and Joan Hardee, spent his first two years in an orphanage while his mother was in {{hospital}} with tuberculosis and was educated at three South East London schools – St Stephen's Church of England primary, Colfe's School, and Sedgehill comprehensive.|$|E
5|$|In January 1995 Hordern {{was invited}} {{back to his}} old college in Brighton, where a room was named in his honour. Inside, the college had {{commissioned}} the sculptor Peter Webster to create a bronze bust of the actor which is displayed with a plaque. Hordern's last physical acting role came shortly afterwards as Lord Langland in the comedy film A Very Open Prison. This was followed by two narration performances, firstly in Spode A History of Excellence, {{and then in the}} five-part film Dinosaurs and <b>Their</b> <b>Living</b> Relatives.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to Roman recruits, {{the vast majority}} of barbarian recruits were probably volunteers, drawn by conditions of service and career prospects that to them probably appeared desirable, in {{contrast to}} <b>their</b> <b>living</b> conditions at home. A minority of barbarian recruits were enlisted by compulsion, namely dediticii (barbarians who surrendered to the Roman authorities, often to escape strife with neighbouring tribes) and tribes who were defeated by the Romans, and obliged, as a condition of peace, to undertake to provide a specified number of recruits annually. Barbarians could be recruited directly, as individuals enrolled into regular regiments, or indirectly, as members of irregular foederati units transformed into regular regiments.|$|E

5|$|In the 13th century mendicant orders—the Franciscans and the Dominicans—who swore vows {{of poverty}} and earned <b>their</b> <b>living</b> by begging, were {{approved}} by the papacy. Religious {{groups such as the}} Waldensians and the Humiliati also attempted to return to the life of early Christianity in the middle 12th and early 13th centuries, but they were condemned as heretical by the papacy. Others joined the Cathars, another heretical movement condemned by the papacy. In 1209, a crusade was preached against the Cathars, the Albigensian Crusade, which in combination with the medieval Inquisition, eliminated them.|$|E
5|$|Many {{members of}} the {{garrison}} tried to sneak aboard Leake's ships to escape the siege. The situation was precarious and was only worsened when a storm damaged many of Leake's ships on 4–5 December. By this time, the garrison was critically short of medicines and supplies. Many were sick or injured and too few remained to carry out repairs to the shell-damaged fortifications. Only 1,300 were healthy enough to man the defences. <b>Their</b> <b>living</b> conditions were increasingly grim; their shoes had worn out and many men wore makeshift sandals made from hay and straw.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{in their}} Philadelphia apartment, Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) and Jim find <b>their</b> <b>living</b> styles are {{increasingly}} clashing. Jim is slovenly, leaving dirty dishes {{to soak in}} the sink until someone else washes them, while Darryl is so fastidious about his possessions that he puts labels with his name on all of them, even a bag of flour. When Darryl takes issue with Jim using his labeled coffee mug, the two begin bickering. Eventually the two come to understand each other's habits better, and relieve tension by playing a video game together.|$|E
50|$|The Act of Uniformity 1662 - This second statute {{made use}} of the Book of Common Prayer {{compulsory}} in religious service. Upwards of 2000 clergy refused to comply with this act, and were forced to resign <b>their</b> <b>livings.</b>|$|R

5|$|The Beatles' booking agent, Allan Williams, {{decided to}} send the group to Hamburg when another group he managed, Derry and the Seniors, proved {{successful}} there. Having no permanent drummer at the time, they recruited Best {{a few days before}} their departure. After breaking their contract by playing at another club, Harrison was deported for being underaged, and McCartney and Best were arrested and deported for attempted arson (after McCartney or Best had set fire to a condom in <b>their</b> <b>living</b> quarters as a light source to gather their possessions as their host had cut off power to their room).|$|E
5|$|The {{teaching}} {{center at}} the mosque also suffered. The once well stocked library at al-Azhar was neglected, and manuscripts of Fatimid teachings that were held at al-Azhar were destroyed. The Ayyubid dynasty promoted the teaching of Sunni theology in subsidized madrasas (schools) built throughout Cairo. Student funding was withdrawn, organized classes were no longer held at the mosque, and the professors that had prospered under the Fatimids were forced to find other means to earn <b>their</b> <b>living.</b>|$|E
5|$|Towers A, B, and C house mostly first-year freshmen. The towers {{are all of}} {{different}} heights, and differ slightly in <b>their</b> <b>living</b> accommodations. Tower B is the tallest of the three, at 22 stories. Tower A is 19 stories tall, and Tower C is 16 stories in height. Rooms in Towers A and B are the same size, roughly 17ft (5.2m) by 11ft (3.4m). These measurements are not exact, however, because the three towers are cylindrical in shape (although actually twenty-sided) and the rooms themselves are therefore somewhat trapezoidal.|$|E
50|$|The {{incident}} inspired Rogovin {{to turn to}} photography as a {{means of}} expression; {{it was a way to}} continue to speak to the worth and dignity of people who make <b>their</b> <b>livings</b> under modest or difficult circumstances, often in physically taxing occupations that usually receive little attention.|$|R

5|$|According to the Court of Inquiry, 'the prime {{cause of}} this lamentable episode' was the {{responsibility}} of Colonel Martin. Described as a ‘’loner’’ for whom officers had little respect, Martin’s primary fault {{was that he was}} too trusting, to the point of naivety. While he cared for the welfare of his men and saw that <b>their</b> <b>living</b> conditions were improved, he was described as being too much of a ‘’solder’s friend’’, to the point that other British officers found that this attitude and work ethic of Martin’s severely undermined their authority over the sepoys. Over time, that served to erode the respect that the British officers and even the sepoys had for him.|$|E
5|$|Although phumdi {{vegetation}} {{has existed}} for centuries, {{it was not until}} 1886 that the Manipur Gazetteer recorded that wetlands with floating islands were used by inhabitants for fishing. Before the Itahi barrage was constructed in 1986, 207 khangpoks (huts or sheds) were reported on the phumdis, but after the dam was completed in 1999, the Loktak Development Authority (LDA) reported 800 such structures. Many of the huts are reported to have been converted into permanent dwellings and about 4,000 people live in these floating huts, earning <b>their</b> <b>living</b> as fishermen. The huts are constructed using plastic ropes, heavy rocks, wood, bamboo, zinc plates and iron rods. Athapums, artificial circular phumdis, which were built by the villagers as enclosures for fish farming, are present on the lake, and this aquaculture has caused further proliferation of the phumdis. A tourist lodge has been built on one of the phumdis in Sandra Island.|$|E
5|$|INC {{created an}} Election control room, headed by Randeep Surjewala, {{to keep track}} of all the events and {{information}} related to campaigning. The war room was located at 15, Rakabganj Road and kept track of 160 Lok Sabha constituencies where the party needed to boost its preparations. The Congress party initiated its election campaign in January 2014. It gave extra focus to the new middle class of India which was above the poverty line but not enough rich to be in middle class. This new economic class comprises 700 million people out of the country's total population of 1.2 billion. This class includes railway coolies, servants, rickshaw-pullers, labourers, fishermen, guards and other people who earn <b>their</b> <b>living</b> by doing minor chores.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, Creeks, escaped African slaves, and other Indians from {{northern}} Florida {{displaced by the}} Creek War formed the area's Seminole nation. After {{the end of the}} Seminole Wars in 1842, the Seminoles faced relocation to Indian territory near Oklahoma. A few hundred Seminole hunters and scouts settled within what is today Big Cypress National Preserve, to escape the forced emigration to the west. From 1859 to about 1930, the Seminoles and Miccosukee, a similar but linguistically unique tribe, lived in relative isolation, making <b>their</b> <b>living</b> by trading. In 1928, surveying and construction began on the Tamiami Trail, along the northern border of Everglades National Park. The road not only bisected the Everglades but also introduced a steady, if small, traffic of white settlers into the Everglades.|$|E
5|$|Ronny is stabbed by a gang {{while trying}} to protect Tariq and has to have his kidney removed. However, it is {{discovered}} {{he was born with}} just one and will need a kidney transplant. None of his siblings are a tissue match, so Ash, Adi and Kareena visit their mother, but her kidney is not a match either. Tariq is forced to reveal that he is Dan's son, and he donates his kidney to Ronny. He explains that he thought having a mildly romantic relationship with his half sister would bring him closer to the family. Adi dislikes the fact he and Tariq are half brothers, but mellows towards him eventually. When bailiffs arrive to evict the family from their home, they board themselves into <b>their</b> <b>living</b> room, but eventually admit defeat and move into a flat with Sasha, starting a minicab firm called Toucan Cars.|$|E
5|$|Subsistence crops {{grown in}} the country include matoke (green bananas), which occupy {{more than a third}} of the country's farmland, potatoes, beans, sweet potatoes, cassava, wheat and maize. Coffee and tea are the major cash crops for export, with the high altitudes, steep slopes and {{volcanic}} soils providing favourable conditions. Reports, have established that more than 400,000 Rwandans, make <b>their</b> <b>living</b> from coffee plantation. Reliance on agricultural exports makes Rwanda vulnerable to shifts in their prices. Animals raised in Rwanda include cows, goats, sheep, pigs, chicken, and rabbits, with geographical variation in the numbers of each. Production systems are mostly traditional, although there are a few intensive dairy farms around Kigali. Shortages of land and water, insufficient and poor-quality feed, and regular disease epidemics with insufficient veterinary services are major constraints that restrict output. Fishing takes place on the country's lakes, but stocks are very depleted, and live fish are being imported in an attempt to revive the industry.|$|E
