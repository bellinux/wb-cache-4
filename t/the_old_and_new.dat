5|$|Breckinridge {{was equally}} {{controversial}} in internal church politics. He rebuked the Synod of the Western Reserve for de-emphasizing and effectively abandoning {{the office of}} Ruling Elder. He also condemned the governance of Presbyterian missionaries by anyone other than the Presbyterian church. In 1834, he was the chief author of the Act and Testimony, a document summarizing the contentions between <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> Schools. The New School resented Breckinridge and those who signed the Act and Testimony, and even some in the Old School camp had hoped for a more moderate course. The differences between <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> Schools widened over the teachings of Albert Barnes, and the New School members were ejected from the Presbyterian Church in 1837. Because of his leadership in the Old School-New School controversy, Breckinridge was elected moderator of the Old School branch's General Assembly in 1841.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} {{agriculture}} records the domestication {{of plants and animals}} and the development and dissemination of techniques for raising them productively.

5|$|The text {{consists}} of different Bible passages from <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> Testament, {{as well as}} individual verses of hymns by Martin Luther and Adam Reusner, which all together refer to finiteness, preparation for death and dying. There are two distinct parts to the cantata: the view of the Old Testament on death shown in the first part is confronted by that of the New Testament in the second part, leading to a symmetrical structure. The juxtaposition of texts from <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> Testament appeared before in the Christliche Betschule (Christian school of prayer) by Johann Olearius. Markus Rathey, professor at the Yale Institute of Sacred Music, argued in 2006, that the sermon given at the funeral of Strecker is similar in ideas to the themes of the cantatas. It may be an indication that Bach composed the work for this occasion.|$|E
5|$|A {{majority}} of Old School {{leaders in the}} North were convinced of the orthodoxy of the New School.

Nevertheless, <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> School General Assemblies in the North and a {{majority of}} their presbyteries approved the reunion in 1869 of the PCUSA.|$|E

5|$|After the war both <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>and</b> <b>new</b> Chancellery {{buildings}} were levelled by the Soviets.

The site remained unmarked until 2006, when a small plaque with a schematic diagram was installed. Some corridors of the bunker still exist, but are sealed off from the public.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture began {{independently}} {{in different}} parts of the globe, and included a diverse range of taxa. At least 11 separate regions of <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> World were involved as independent centers of origin. Some of the earliest known domestications were of animals. Pigs were domesticated in Mesopotamia around 11,000 BC. Sheep were domesticated in Mesopotamia between 11,000 and 9,000 BC. Cattle were domesticated from the wild aurochs in the areas of modern Turkey and Pakistan around 8,500 BC. Camels were domesticated late, perhaps around 3,000 BC.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of {{reforming}} actions such as the Bill of Middlesex, the Common Pleas became increasingly conservative and resistant to King's Bench changes because of the impact they had on {{the business of the}} Common Pleas. This was best emphasised by Slade's Case, a struggle between <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>and</b> <b>new</b> forms of suing for breach of contract; although an equilibrium between the common law courts was finally reached, it eventually led to their dissolution with the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873, and merger into a single High Court of Justice.|$|E
