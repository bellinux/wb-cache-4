40|$|Over {{the past}} 20 years, {{survival}} rates of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) patients have improved, {{mainly because of}} advances in polychemotherapy protocols. Despite these improvements, we still need novel and less toxic treatment strategies targeting aberrantly activated signaling networks which increase proliferation, survival, and drug resistance of T-ALL cells. One such network {{is represented by the}} phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) /Akt axis. PI 3 K inhibitors have displayed some promising effects in preclinical models of T-ALL. Here, we have analyzed the therapeutic potential of the Akt inhibitor, <b>triciribine,</b> in T-ALL cell lines. <b>Triciribine</b> caused cell cycle arrest and caspase-dependent apoptosis. Western blots demonstrated a dose-dependent dephosphorylation of Akt 1 /Akt 2, and of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 downstream targets in response to <b>triciribine.</b> <b>Triciribine</b> induced autophagy, which could be interpreted as a defensive mechanism, because an autophagy inhibitor (chloroquine) increased triciribine-induced apoptosis. <b>Triciribine</b> synergized with vincristine, a chemotherapeutic drug employed for treating T-ALL patients, and targeted the side population of T-ALL cell lines, which might correspond to leukemia initiating cells.

40|$|The {{transcription}} factor ZNF 217 {{is a candidate}} oncogene in the amplicon on chromosome 20 q 13 that occurs in 20 % to 30 % of primary human breast cancers and that correlates with poor prognosis. We show that Znf 217 overexpression drives aberrant differentiation and signaling events, promotes increased self-renewal capacity, mesenchymal marker expression, motility, and metastasis, and represses an adult tissue stem cell gene signature downregulated in cancers. By in silico screening, we identifi ed candidate therapeutics that at low concentrations inhibit growth of cancer cells expressing high ZNF 217. We show that the nucleoside analogue <b>triciribine</b> inhibits ZNF 217 -induced tumor growth and chemotherapy resistance and inhibits signaling events [e. g., phospho-AKT, phospho-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) ] in vivo. Our data suggest that ZNF 217 is a biomarker of poor prognosis and a therapeutic target in patients with breast cancer and that <b>triciribine</b> {{may be part of}} a personalized treatment strategy in patients overexpressing ZNF 217.

40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the effect of Apelin- 13 on cardiomyocyte autophagy and to deter-mine the underlying mechanism of this effect. To establish an autophagic model system, the cardiomyocytes of Sprague Dawley rats (postnatal day 3) were cultured and divided into five groups: normal control (Co), glucose deprivation (GD), GD+Apelin‑ 13, GD+Apelin‑ 13 treated with the Akt‑specific inhibitor <b>triciribine</b> (GD+Apelin‑ 13 +Triciribine) and triciri-bine alone (<b>Triciribine).</b> The intracellular autophagosomes were then observed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and the expression levels of cellular autophagy-related protein microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC 3), phosphatidylinositol‑ 3 ‑kinase (PI 3 K) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) protein were measured using western blot-ting. Compared with the Co group, the ratio of LC 3 -II/LC 3 -I increased significantly in all treatment groups, with the excep-tion of the <b>Triciribine</b> group (P 0. 05), but mTOR expres-sion was significantly reduced (P< 0. 05). GD led to increased numbers of autophagosomes and augmented the LC 3 -II/LC 3 -I ratio (P< 0. 05). Apelin‑ 13 pretreatment attenuated GD‑induced cardiomyocte injury, decreased the autophagosome number and the ratio of LC 3 ‑II / LC 3 ‑I (P< 0. 05), enhanced PI 3 K activity (P< 0. 05) and upregulated the phosphorylation levels of the Akt and mTOR proteins (P< 0. 05). The Akt‑specific inhibitor <b>triciribine</b> weakened the protective role of Apelin‑ 13 (P< 0. 05). To a certain extent, Apelin‑ 13 inhibited GD‑induced cardiomyocyte autophagy, which may be related in part to the activation of the PI 3 K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway...|$|E

40|$|We have {{recently}} {{shown that the}} immunophilin FKBP 5 (also known as FKBP 51) is a scaffolding protein that can enhance PHLPP-AKT interaction and facilitate PHLPP-mediated dephosphorylation of Akt Ser 473, negatively regulating Akt activation in vitro. Therefore, FKBP 5 might function as a tumor suppressor, and levels of FKBP 5 would affect cell response to chemotherapy. In the current study, we have taken a step forward by using a pancreatic cancer xenograft mice model to show that down regulation of FKBP 5 in shFKBP 5 xenograft mice promotes tumor growth and resistance to gemcitabine, a phenomenon consistent with our previous findings in pancreatic cell lines. In addition, {{we also found that}} inhibitors targeting the Akt pathway, including PI 3 K inhibitor, Akt inhibitor and mTOR inhibitor had a different effect on sensitization to gemcitabine and other chemotherapeutic agents in cell lines, with a specific Akt inhibitor, <b>triciribine,</b> having the greatest sensitization effect. We then tested the hypothesis that addition of <b>triciribine</b> can sensitize gemcitabine treatment, especially in shFKBP 5 pancreatic cancer xenograft mice. We found that combination treatment with gemcitabine and <b>triciribine</b> has a better effect on tumor inhibition than either drug alone (p, 0. 005) and that the inhibition effect is more significant in shFKBP 5 xenograft mice than wt mice (p, 0. 05).

40|$|Treatment of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NET) {{is still}} {{unsatisfactory}} and innovative thera¬peutic approaches are urgently needed. Up-regulation of phosphatidylinositol- 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) -AKT signaling facilitates tumor cell growth and inhibits cell demise. The AKT-pathway also {{plays an important}} role in cytostatic therapy resistance and response to hypoxia and angiogenesis. The Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp 90) is an important regulator of AKT-activity. Furthermore, it is overexpressed in a wide range of tumors and an emerging target for the treatment of cancer. We therefore examined the potency of <b>triciribine,</b> an AKT inhibitor, and IPI 504, a HSP 90 inhibitor, in three distinct neuroendocrine gastrointestinal tumor cell lines, using real-time cell proliferation assays. Also, we investigated the induction of apoptosis and effects on a broad range of cancer-associated gene products. Furthermore, we characterized the role of PTEN as a possible predictor of sensitivity to <b>triciribine</b> in GEP-NETs. We looked for additive anti-neoplastic effects of the drugs when combined with conventional cytostatic drugs or other targeted drugs, affecting different molecules of the PI 3 K-AKT-pathway. We also assessed the potency of AKT- and HSP 90 inhibition to slow tumor growth in vivo, by using the chick chorioallantoic membrane assay. Both, AKT- and HSP 90 inhibition significantly suppressed growth in different neuroendocrine cell lines. Combinations with classic cytostatic drugs as well as drugs targeting other molecules of the PI 3 K-AKT-pathway led to synergistic anti-proliferative effects. Additional in vivo-evaluations confirmed the anti-neoplastic potency of <b>triciribine</b> and IPI 504. Expression of PTEN was shown to predict sensitivity of cells towards AKT inhibition. Thus, our data show that inhibition of the AKT-pathway as well as inhibition of HSP 90 potently reduces the growth of GEP-NET cells alone or in combination therapies...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. To {{predict the}} {{response}} of cells to chemotherapeutic agents based on gene expression profiles, we performed a chemoinformatic study {{of a set of}} standard anticancer agents assayed for activity against a panel of 60 human tumor-derived cell lines from the De-velopmental Therapeutics Program (DTP) at the National Cancer Institute (NCI). Methods. Mechanistically-relevant gene:drug activity associations were identified in the scientific literature. The correlations between expression levels of drug target genes and the activity of the drugs against the NCI’s 60 cell line panel were calculated across and within each tumor tissue type, using published drug activity and gene ex-pression data. Results. Compared to other mechanistically-relevant gene-drug asso-ciations, that of <b>triciribine</b> phosphate (TCN-P) and adenosine kinase (ADK) was exceptionally strong—overall and within tumor tissue types—across the 60 cell lines profiled for chemosensitivity (1) and gene expression (2). Conclusion. The results suggest ADK expression may be useful for stratifying TCN-P-responsive vs. non-responsive tumors. Based on TCN-P’s mechanism of action and the observed TCN-P:ADK asso-ciation, we contend that catalytic drug activation provides a rational, mechanistic basis for personalizing cancer treatment based on tumor-specific differences in the expression of drug-activating enzymes.

Previous studies indicate that FSS promotes blood circulation and dissipates blood stasis, thus which is being used widely to treat vascular diseases. Here, we aim to determine the cellular mechanism for the vascular benefit of FSS. The treatment of FSS reversed homocysteine-induced impairment of acetylcholine (ACh) -evoked endothelium-dependent relaxation in aortic rings, isolated from rats. Like radical oxygen species (ROS) scavenger tempol, FSS attenuated homocysteine-stimulated ROS generation in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), and it also stimulated the production of nitric oxide (NO) as measured by fluorescence dye and biochemical assay. In addition, the phosphorylation levels of both Akt kinase and endothelial NO synthases (eNOS) were markedly increased by FSS treatment, which was abolished by an Akt inhibitor <b>triciribine.</b> Likewise, <b>triciribine</b> reversed FSS-induced NO production in HUVECs. Finally, FSS elevated intracellular Ca 2 + levels in HUVECs, and the Ca 2 + chelator BAPTA-AM inhibited the FSS-stimulated eNOS phosphorylation.

40|$|The Akt {{activation}} inhibitor <b>triciribine</b> and the farnesyltransferase inhibitor tipifarnib have modest {{to little}} activity {{in clinical trials}} when used as single agents. In this article, preclinical data show that the combination {{is more effective than}} single agents both in cultured cells and in vivo. Combination index data analysis shows that this combination is highly synergistic at inhibiting anchorage-dependent growth of breast cancer cells. This synergistic interaction is also observed with structurally unrelated inhibitors of Akt (MK- 2206) and farnesyltransferase (FTI- 2153). The triciribine/tipifarnib synergistic effects are seen with several cancer cell lines including those from breast, leukemia, multiple myeloma and lung tumors with different genetic alterations such as K-Ras, B-Raf, PI 3 K (phosphoinositide 3 -kinase), p 53 and pRb mutations, PTEN, pRB and Ink 4 a deletions, and ErbB receptor overexpression. Furthermore, the combination is synergistic at inhibiting anchorage-independent growth and at inducing apoptosis in breast cancer cells. The combination is also more effective at inhibiting the Akt/mTOR/S 6 kinase pathway. In an ErbB 2 -driven breast tumor transgenic mouse model, the combination, but not single agent, treatment with <b>triciribine</b> and tipifarnib induces significant breast tumor regression.

40|$|Background: With {{the rise}} of the burden of ischemic heart disease, both {{clinical}} and economic evidence show a desperate need to protect the heart against myocardium ischemia-reperfusion injury-related complications following cardiac surgery or per-cutaneous coronary intervention. However, there is no effective intervention for myocardium ischemia-reperfusion injury as yet. Methods:We pretreated mice with 4 daily 2. 0 absolute atmosphere (ATA) hyperbaric oxygen, then observed its effects on heart function parameters and infarct size following in situ ischemia-reperfusion. Multiple oxidative and inflammation products were measured in the myocardium. Next, we investigated the expression of heme oxygenase 1 (HO- 1), phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) /serine/threonine protein kinase (Akt) pathway, and NF-E 2 -related factor 2 (Nrf 2) in the presence of myocardium ischemia-reperfusion injury, hyperbaric oxygen preconditioning, and their inhibitors and their effects on heart function para-meters. Results: Hyperbaric oxygen preconditioning ameliorated the cardiac function and histological alterations induced by myocardium ischemia-reperfusion injury, decreased oxidative products and proinflammatory cytokine. Hyperbaric oxygen pre-conditioning increased expression of HO- 1, which was suppressed by PI 3 K inhibitor LY 294002, Nrf 2 knockout, and Akt inhibitor <b>triciribine.</b> The expression of Nrf 2 was enhanced by hyperbaric oxygen preconditioning, but decreased by LY 294002 and tricir-ibine.

A high-throughput genetic screen, using an RNA interference library targeting 779 kinases and related proteins, identified the PDK 1 signalling pathway as a strong determinant of sensitivity to multiple ERα antagonists including tamoxifen. A chemical screen using existing drugs and known kinase inhibitors also identified inhibitors of the PDK 1 pathway, including <b>triciribine</b> and tetrandrine.

Here, we identified PSMC 5 as a novel radiosensitivity biomarker, demonstrating that radiosensitive H 460 cells were converted to a radioresistance phenotype by PSMC 5 depletion. Exposure of H 460 cells to radiation induced a marked accumulation of cell death-promoting reactive oxygen species, but this effect was blocked in radiation-treated H 460 PSMC 5 -knockdown cells through downregulation of the p 53 -p 21 pathway. Interestingly, PSMC 5 depletion in H 460 cells enhanced both AKT activation and MDM 2 transcription, thereby promoting the degradation of p 53 and p 21 proteins. Furthermore, specific inhibition of AKT with <b>triciribine</b> or knockdown of MDM 2 with small interfering RNA largely restored p 21 expression in PSMC 5 -knockdown H 460 cells.

Targeting TICs may be a key innovation for cancer treatment. In this study, we found that PPARc agonists inhibited the cancer stem cell-like phenotype and attenuated tumor growth of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) initiated by NOX 2 upregulation were partially responsible for the inhibitory effects mediated by PPARc agonists. However, PPARc agonist-mediated ROS production significantly activated AKT, which in turn promoted TIC survival by limiting ROS generation. Inhibition of AKT, by either pharmacological inhibitors or AKT siRNA, significantly enhanced PPARc agonist-mediated inhibition of cell proliferation and stem cell-like properties in HCC cells. Importantly, in nude mice inoculated with HCC Huh 7 cells, we demonstrated a synergistic inhibitory effect of the PPARc agonist rosiglitazone and the AKT inhibitor <b>triciribine</b> on tumor growth.

In the present study, hydroxysafflor yellow A-mediated sonodynamic therapy was used to induce autophagy and inhibit inflammation in THP- 1 macrophages. Following hydroxysafflor yellow A-mediated sonodynamic therapy, autophagy was induced as shown by the conversion of LC 3 -II/LC 3 -I, increased expression of beclin 1, degradation of p 62, and the formation of autophagic vacuoles. In addition, inflammatory factors were inhibited. These effects were blocked by Atg 5 siRNA, the autophagy inhibitor 3 -methyladenine, and the reactive oxygen species scavenger N-acetyl cysteine.

The structures of Rcl bound to two other nucleotides were then solved by molecular replacement using the previous crystal structure as a template. The resulting structures, solved at high resolution, led to a clear characterization of the protein-ligand interactions that will guide further rational drug design...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND— 1 -Alpha, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D 3 (1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3) {{inhibits}} {{proliferation of}} multiple cancer cell types including prostate cells and upregulates p 21 and/or p 27, while loss of Pten and PI 3 K/AKT activation stimulates survival and down regulates p 21 and p 27. We hypothesized that inhibition of the PI 3 K/AKT pathway synergizes with the antiproliferative signaling of 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3. METHODS—Viability, cell cycle and senescence of cells were evaluated upon combinational treatment with 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 and pharmacological PI 3 K/AKT inhibitors. RESULTS—Pharmacological inhibitors of PI 3 K or Akt and 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 synergistically inhibited growth of DU 145, LNCaP, primary human prostate cancer cell strains and Pten null mouse prostatic epithelial cells (MPEC). The inhibitors used included API- 2 (<b>Triciribine)</b> and GSK 690693 which {{are currently in}} clinical trials for treatment of cancer. A novel mechanism for antiproliferative effects of 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 in prostate cells, induction of senescence, was discovered. Combination of 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 and AKT inhibitor cooperated to induce G 1 arrest, senescence, and p 21 levels in prostate cancer cells. As AKT is commonly activated by PTEN loss, we evaluate...|$|E
40|$|AbstractGlioblastoma is {{the most}} common and most {{malignant}} intrinsic human brain tumor, characterized by extensive invasion and proliferation of glial (astrocytic) tumor cells, frequent activation of tyrosine kinase receptor signaling pathways, relative resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and poor prognosis. Using the Gal 4 -UAS system, we have produced glioma models in Drosophila by overexpressing homologs of human tyrosine kinase receptors under control of the glia-specific promoter reversed polarity (repo). Glial overexpression of activated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) resulted in enhanced proliferation and migration of larval glial cells with increased numbers in the eye imaginal disc, diffuse tumor-like enlargement of the optic stalk, and marked ectopic invasion of glial cells along the optic nerve. Glial overexpression of the downstream kinase PI 3 K showed similar pathology. Overexpression of activated pvr (platelet-derived growth factor receptor/vascular endothelial growth factor receptor homolog) led to migration of glial cells along the optic nerve, whereas expression of activated htl (fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 homolog) and INR (insulin receptor) showed markedly elevated numbers of glial cells in the optic stalk. The EGFR/phosphatidylinositol 3 -phosphate kinase (PI 3 K) phenotype was partly reverted by the administration of the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib and completely rescued by the PI 3 K inhibitor wortmannin and the Akt inhibitor <b>triciribine.</b> We suggest that Drosophila models will be useful for deciphering signaling cascades underlying abnormal behavior of glioma cells for genetic screens to reveal interacting genes involved in gliomagenesis and for experimental therapy approaches...|$|E
40|$|Both major {{forms of}} {{diabetes}} involve {{a decline in}} β-cell mass, mediated by autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing cells in type 1 diabetes and by increased rates of apoptosis secondary to metabolic stress in type 2 diabetes. Methods for controlled expansion of β-cell mass are currently not available but would have great potential utility for treatment of these diseases. In the current study, we demonstrate that overexpression of trefoil factor 3 (TFF 3) in rat pancreatic islets results in a 4 - to 5 -fold increase in [3 H]thymidine incorporation, with full retention of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. This increase was almost exclusively due to stimulation of β-cell replication, as demonstrated by studies of bromodeoxyuridine incorporation and co-immunofluorescence analysis with anti-bromodeoxyuridine and antiinsulin or antiglucagon antibodies. The proliferative effect of TFF 3 required the presence of serum or 0. 5 ng/ml epidermal growth factor. The ability of TFF 3 overexpression to stimulate proliferation of rat islets in serum was abolished {{by the addition of}} epidermal growth factor receptor antagonist AG 1478. Furthermore, TFF 3 -induced increases in [3 H]thymidine incorporation in rat islets cultured in serum was blocked by overexpression of a dominant-negative Akt protein or treatment with <b>triciribine,</b> an Akt inhibitor. Finally, overexpression of TFF 3 also caused a doubling of [3 H]thymidine incorporation in human islets. In summary, our findings reveal a novel TFF 3 -mediated pathway for stimulation of β-cell replication that could ultimately be exploited for expansion or preservation of islet β-cell mass...|$|E
