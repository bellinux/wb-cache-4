5|$|Playford {{became a}} wartime Premier in 1939 when Australia, {{as part of}} the British Empire, entered World War II. Later in the war, cut off from {{traditional}} suppliers of manufactures, the country was forced to create its own. Armaments and munitions factories needed to be created to supply the war effort, and Playford was vociferous in advocating South Australia as the perfect location for these. It was far from the battlegrounds and had the most efficient labour force in the nation. British <b>Tube</b> <b>Mills</b> opened a mill in the inner-northern suburbs. Ammunition factories were built in the northern and western suburbs of Adelaide, as well as in some smaller installations in regional centres, and construction on a shipyard began in Whyalla. Having strenuously opposed a construction of a pipeline to pump water from Morgan in the River Murray to Whyalla for the steelworks and blast furnace there before his ascension to the premiership, Playford oversaw approval of the Morgan-Whyalla pipeline in 1940 and its completion in 1944. He also reversed his previous opposition to Butler's pine plantation and sawmill program, authorising an expansion of the program in the state's southeast.|$|E

50|$|The {{stamp mill}} {{contained}} 40 1250 lb stamps. Ore entering the mill from the tramway went over grizzlies. It {{then went to}} stamps which dropped 106 times per minute. Only outside amalgamation was used, and the pulp flowed over 6 ft amalgamating plates to Frenier sand pumps, which sent it to hydraulic classifiers. The slime was sent to thickeners; the sand was concentrated in three double deck and two single deck Deister tables. The concentrate was de-watered, after which it was ground in a <b>tube</b> <b>mill.</b> The middling was sent to two Union Vanners. Tailing went from the tables to 7 sand vats.

40|$|This diploma {{work was}} {{performed}} at Ovako Steel’s plant in Hofors, Sweden. At the <b>tube</b> <b>mill,</b> hot rolled seamless tubes are produced. Large amounts of energy {{are needed for}} the rolling and the heat treatment of the tubes. The purpose of this thesis was to investigate possibilities to reduce the consumption {{of energy in the}} <b>tube</b> <b>mill.</b> The heating of steel at the <b>tube</b> <b>mill</b> is mainly done by combustion of propan 95, a fossil fuel. An inventory of the energy flow in the <b>tube</b> <b>mill,</b> made by heat balances over the process stages showed that the furnaces (a rotary furnace and heat treatment furnaces) are in poor condition. Significant improvements can be achieved with economical and environmental revenues as a result. The tubes are placed on a cooling bed after the rolling. A lot of heat is released from the tubes on the cooling bed and should be recovered, but today technology is not available that is applicable to the conditions of the cooling bed in the <b>tube</b> <b>mill.</b> Since propan 95 is a fossil fuel, combustion will increase the content of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. By exporting waste heat to a nearby heat and power plant, biofuel will be released that can replace fossil fuel in another heat plant and global carbon dioxide emissions will be reduced. An improvement of the rotary furnace will decrease the consumption of propan 95 from 2388 tons per year to 1600 tons, which also leads to a decrease of the emissions of carbon dioxide by 33 %. Recovery of the heat in the flue gas by export of waste heat would decrease the emissions by another 633 tons per year. The heat treatment furnaces can reduce the use of propan 95 by 25 %, but recovering heat in the flue gas stream is not recommended...|$|R

40|$|Since {{the thermal}} Power Plants in the Kyushu Districts {{are obliged to}} use low quality coal for fuel, they have no {{alternative}} but to utilize combustion of pulverized coal. The Unit System <b>Tube</b> <b>Mill</b> is a low costing Pulveruzer, but this system has its difficulties with automatic coal feeding. The reason being that as the feed control is carried out by interlinking the draft of the exhauster which blows the pulverized coal into the furnace with the feed rate of the coal feeder, after operation over a long period，excessive quantities of coal accumulates within the mill causing Mill- over or shortage of pulverized coal comes about decreasing the load of the Power Plant. With such difficulties constantly happening, perfect automatic combustion cannot be obtained. These defects can be corrected by disconnecting the interlink between the coal feeder and the exhauster, and controlling the feed rate of the coal feeder so that a fixed quantity of coal is constantly retained within the <b>Tube</b> <b>Mill.</b> Since a detector is necessary to determine the quantity of coal retained in the <b>Tube</b> <b>Mill,</b> the Author has invented and developed an Electro-acoustic Mill Level Meter which is quick responding and enables the operator to accurately detect the quantity of coal retained within the Mill. Recently the Unit System <b>Tube</b> <b>Mill</b> coal feeding system of the No. 2 Minato Power Plant of the Kyushu Power Company was completely switched to automatic operation by the use of this invention. Following this, the same automatic coal feeding system was installed at the Ainoura Power Plant which brought about excellent operating results.

50|$|In {{addition}} to the blast furnace/open hearth steelmaking process, CF&I also used the basic oxygen furnace (BOF) process {{for a number of}} years. This process was later replaced by electric arc furnaces (EAF). Currently, one EAF is used at the facility to convert over a million tons of scrap per year into steel billets of various sizes. The billets are then distributed to the three steel finishing facilities (rail mill, rod & bar <b>mill,</b> seamless <b>tube</b> <b>mill)</b> for processing into the various finished products.|$|R
50|$|The {{grinding}} in {{the ball}} and <b>tube</b> <b>mill</b> is produced by the rotating quantity of steel balls by their fall and lift due to tube rotation. The ball charge may occupy one third to half of the total internal volume of the shell. The significant feature incorporated in the BBD mills is its double end operation, each end catering to one elevation of a boiler. The system facilitated entry of raw coal and exit of pulverized fuel from same end simultaneously. This helps in {{reducing the number of}} installations per unit.|$|R
50|$|The <b>tube</b> <b>mill</b> output (responding to boiler load demand) is {{controlled}} by regulating the primary air-flow.

A control circuit monitors the coal level in the mill, and controls {{the speed of the}} raw coal feeder to maintain it. Maintaining the coal level in the mill offers a built-in capacity cushion of pulverized fuel to take care of short interruptions in the raw coal circuit.|$|R

40|$|The electroacoustic-type Mill-level meter, {{developed}} by the author, indicates a different value according {{to the size of}} grain, even when the <b>tube</b> <b>mill</b> is running at the same mill level. As shown in this paper, after experimentally researching mutual relations between the mill level and the size of grain by using a small model mill, the following facts could be confirmed. In case of an air-swept <b>tube</b> <b>mill,</b> the mill-level meter faithfully indicates its mill level, and furthermore there is some linear functional relation between them at the range of normal running (except such a transitional case as mill over or empty mill). Now the result of the study is summarized as follows : (1) If mill level is of the same granulous size, the indication of the mill-level meter has a different value according to the size of grain. Hence, {{as in the case of}} a cemment mill, when a given quantity is once thrown into a mill, and is continually crushed without supplying raw materials and exhausting the powdered grain while the mill is in motion, this apparatus can be used as a meter of indicating the granulous size. (2) As an air-swept <b>tube</b> <b>mill</b> has a mechanism in which pulverized coal is exhausted by air-draft while raw coal is continuously fed, it is noticed that coal of many kinds of granulous size is found mixed in the mill. Therefore, if mill level consists of mixed grains of various size, a linear functional relation is established between the indication and the mill level. (3) Taking as an example pulverized coal with a grain size from 0. 297 mm to 0. 074 mm (48 - 200 mesh), the coal has the property similar to that of liquid, which gives a lubricating action to a mill ball like oil and a very noticeable effect to the indication. It may be said that character of pulverzed coal whose grain is smaller than 0. 074 mm rather approaches a gasious state than a liquid. In fact, these particles manifestly tend to float above the mill level, the influence of which on the motion of a mill ball will be negligible. ...|$|R
