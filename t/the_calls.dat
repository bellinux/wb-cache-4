5|$|A {{study of}} short-finned pilot whales off the {{southwest}} coast of Tenerife in the Canary Islands {{has found the}} members of a pod maintained contact with each other through call repertoires unique to their pod. A later study found, when foraging at around 800 m deep, short-finned pilot whales make tonal calls. The number and length of <b>the</b> <b>calls</b> seem to decrease with depth despite being farther away from conspecifics at the surface. As such, the surrounding water pressure affects the energy of <b>the</b> <b>calls,</b> but it does not appear to affect the frequency levels.|$|E
5|$|The call {{consists}} of weak staccato, chirping whistles, kleek kik ik ik ik, somewhat similar in cadence to a gull's call. <b>The</b> <b>calls</b> of young birds {{tend to be}} more harsh and shrill than those of adults.|$|E
5|$|An {{individual}} male {{may have}} a repertoire of more than 100phrases, many copied from its parents and neighbouring birds. Mimicry may include the imitation of man-made items like telephones, and the song thrush will also repeat <b>the</b> <b>calls</b> of captive birds, including exotics such as the white-faced whistling duck.|$|E
5000|$|In {{telephone}} systems, {{the time}} between (a) the instant a circuit, i.e., off-hook condition at each end, is established between <b>the</b> <b>call</b> originator and <b>the</b> <b>call</b> receiver and (b) <b>the</b> instant <b>the</b> <b>call</b> originator or <b>the</b> <b>call</b> receiver terminates <b>the</b> <b>call.</b>|$|R
5000|$|For example, <b>the</b> <b>called</b> {{party may}} {{indicate}} {{to the telephone}} exchange that <b>the</b> <b>call</b> is being disconnected by <b>the</b> <b>called</b> party by allowing loop current to flow in the line, or <b>the</b> <b>called</b> party indicates to the exchange that <b>the</b> <b>call</b> is being answered.|$|R
50|$|If <b>the</b> desired <b>called</b> {{party is}} not the person who picked up <b>the</b> <b>call,</b> and <b>the</b> desired <b>called</b> party is at an unknown location, the person who picked up <b>the</b> <b>call</b> may park <b>the</b> <b>call</b> and then use the public address system to page <b>the</b> desired <b>called</b> party to pick up <b>the</b> <b>call.</b>|$|R
5|$|Blount called Hout and Petersen to {{apologize}} on September 5. Kelly participated in <b>the</b> <b>calls.</b> Hout was not suspended for his taunting, though Petersen {{stated that he}} did receive disciplinary action. Petersen accepted the apology as sincere, and expressed the wish that Blount {{would be able to}} go on playing football, and that many parties would learn from the experience.|$|E
5|$|In early 2013, protestors went to {{the streets}} flying the old colonial flag {{demanding}} more democracy and resignation of Chief Executive Leung Chun Ying. The use of the flag has created concerns from Chinese authorities and request from Leung to stop flying the flag. Despite <b>the</b> <b>calls</b> from Leung the old flags {{are not subject to}} use restrictions beyond not being allowed to be placed on flagpoles and are freely sold and manufactured in the territory.|$|E
5|$|In {{explaining}} {{this separation}} of species, Rasmussen points to morphological divergence and {{significant differences in}} vocalization. Ornithologist Edward C. Dickinson observed in a 2006 article that though evidence of morphological and vocal differences between S. przewalskii and S. leucopsis have been delineated, little had yet been published presenting comparative morphological details, {{and that it would}} be instructive to study how each taxon responds to <b>the</b> <b>calls</b> of the other.|$|E
5000|$|... {{data may}} be {{delivered}} to the network by <b>the</b> <b>call</b> originator before <b>the</b> <b>call</b> access phase is completed, but the data are not delivered to <b>the</b> <b>call</b> receiver if <b>the</b> <b>call</b> attempt is unsuccessful ...|$|R
50|$|A {{conference call}} is a {{telephone}} call in which someone talks to several people at the same time. <b>The</b> conference <b>calls</b> may be designed to allow <b>the</b> <b>called</b> party to participate during <b>the</b> <b>call,</b> or <b>the</b> <b>call</b> may be set up so that <b>the</b> <b>called</b> party merely listens into <b>the</b> <b>call</b> and cannot speak. It is sometimes called ATC (audio tele-conference).|$|R
50|$|In a {{collect call}} (i.e. reverse charge), <b>the</b> <b>called</b> party pays <b>the</b> fee for <b>the</b> <b>call,</b> {{when it is}} usually <b>the</b> <b>calling</b> party that does so. <b>The</b> <b>called</b> party also pays if the number dialed is a {{toll-free}} telephone number.|$|R
5|$|Like other corvids, ravens can mimic {{sounds from}} their environment, {{including}} human speech. Non-vocal sounds {{produced by the}} common raven include wing whistles and bill snapping. Clapping or clicking has been observed more often in females than in males. If {{a member of a}} pair is lost, its mate reproduces <b>the</b> <b>calls</b> of its lost partner to encourage its return.|$|E
5|$|News anchor Brian Williams, of NBC Nightly News, guest-starred {{as himself}} in this episode. In a scene with Tracy and Jack at a club, Tracy reveals to Jack {{that he has}} been giving out his phone number to {{different}} women, though it is not his real number, which results in Williams receiving <b>the</b> <b>calls.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>calls</b> {{given by}} flocks near the {{breeding}} areas are typical swift screams, including a trilled tsiririri or harsher spee-eer. They resemble {{the cries of}} the common swift, but are softer and less wheezy. Pacific swifts are less vocal on the wintering grounds, but produce a variety of twitters and buzzes.|$|E
5000|$|If <b>the</b> <b>calling</b> {{program and}} <b>the</b> <b>called</b> program are both ABAP programs, the RFC {{interface}} provides both communication partners. <b>The</b> <b>calling</b> {{program can be}} any ABAP program, and <b>the</b> <b>called</b> program must be a function module that is registered as remote.|$|R
50|$|In general, CID as {{transmitted}} from {{the origin of}} <b>the</b> <b>call</b> is only <b>the</b> <b>calling</b> party's full phone number (including area code, and including international access code and country code if it's an international <b>call).</b> <b>The</b> <b>calling</b> party name is added by the consumer's terminating central office if the consumer has subscribed to that service. Calling name delivery is not automatic. A SS7 (or Signalling System 7) TCAP query may be launched by <b>the</b> <b>called</b> party's central office, in order to retrieve the information for Calling Name delivery to the caller ID equipment at the consumer's location, if the caller's name has not already been associated with <b>the</b> <b>calling</b> party's line at the originating central office. Canadian systems using CCS7 automatically (but not in all cases) send <b>the</b> <b>calling</b> name with <b>the</b> <b>call</b> set-up and routing information {{at the time of}} <b>the</b> <b>call.</b>|$|R
40|$|This study {{contrasts}} <b>the</b> <b>call</b> {{and continuous}} auction methods using Taiwan Stock Exchange data. Volatility under <b>the</b> <b>call</b> market method is approximately one-half of {{that under the}} continuous auction method. <b>The</b> <b>call</b> market method is more effective in reducing the volatility of high-volume stocks than low-volume stocks. This contradicts conventional wisdom which suggests that <b>the</b> <b>call</b> market method is superior for thinly traded stocks, while the continuous auction method is preferred for heavily traded stocks. <b>The</b> <b>call</b> market method does not impair liquidity and price discovery. <b>The</b> <b>call</b> market appears more efficient than in the continuous auction market.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>calls</b> made by caecilians and {{salamanders}} {{are limited}} to occasional soft squeaks, grunts or hisses and have not been much studied. A clicking sound sometimes produced by caecilians may be a means of orientation, as in bats, or a form of communication. Most salamanders are considered voiceless, but the California giant salamander (Dicamptodon ensatus) has vocal cords and can produce a rattling or barking sound. Some species of salamander emit a quiet squeak or yelp if attacked.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>calls</b> of the {{two species}} are not similar. The call of the greater melampitta is a double or triple note, which is slurred and {{repeated}} monotonously, and {{is reminiscent of the}} black pitohui. The call of the lesser melampitta are either harsh buzzy notes or chirped whistles, both of which are repeated at intervals.|$|E
5|$|The song is a short, fast, {{bubbling}} {{series of}} chip notes that can accelerate near the end, and <b>the</b> <b>calls</b> include a nasal chur {{and a thin}} tsi. When threatened or separated from its mate, the sparrow makes a dear-dear-dear call.|$|E
40|$|Previous {{performance}} {{studies of}} PCS channel allocation assumed that call holding times have an exponential distribution. <b>The</b> exponential <b>call</b> holding time assumption is justified for existing cellular systems, where wireless calls are charged {{based on the}} length of <b>the</b> <b>call</b> holding time. Future PCS systems may exercise flat rate billing, and consequently a more general distribution is desirable to model <b>the</b> <b>call</b> holding times. This paper models <b>the</b> <b>call</b> holding times by the Erlang distribution (a generalization of the exponential distribution) to investigate the effect of the variance of <b>the</b> <b>call</b> holding times on <b>the</b> <b>call</b> completion probability. Our analysis indicates that <b>the</b> <b>call</b> completion probability decreases as the variance of <b>the</b> <b>call</b> holding times decreases.

5|$|There {{was also}} growing concern that <b>the</b> <b>calls</b> by Prince Sihanouk of Cambodia for the {{neutralization}} {{of his own}} country, and his attempts to convene an international conference on the matter, would increase such sentiment in Vietnam, something that was oft-repeated in the American media.

5|$|After O'Grady {{was shot}} down, {{tensions}} increased greatly between NATO and the Bosnian Serbs. A number of US commanders called for immediate retaliatory air strikes; however, the Serbs still held {{the majority of}} the hostages seized after the bombing of Pale. The threat to the hostages prevented NATO from acting more forcefully, and the Serbs released 121 hostages immediately after the incident in an effort to cool tensions. Nonetheless, the situation remained explosive for the next six days until O'Grady was rescued on 8 June by the 3rd Battalion 8th Marines 2nd Marine Division, ending <b>the</b> <b>calls</b> for immediate offensive action. Shortly thereafter, the Serbs released the remaining hostages. As a result of the incident, NATO ordered that all further sorties be accompanied by aircraft designed for suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD).|$|E

Rosy drops the knife and breaks down in hysteria.|$|E
5|$|Common names include gillbird, gilly warbler, barkingbird, muttonbird, butcherbird, what's o {{clock and}} chock. Unlike many species in southwestern Australia, the red wattlebird was given names {{by the local}} {{indigenous}} people that were onomatopoeic (sounding like <b>the</b> <b>calls</b> they make). Names recorded include wodjalok, durdal, doongorok, and djoongong (this last name is also applied to the western wattlebird). In the Eyre Peninsula in South Australia, the local Barngarla people knew it as ngarkarko or ngarkabukko. The local people of Denial Bay in South Australia called it noggal, and the Ngarrindjeri people of the Lower Murray region in South Australia knew it as rungkan.|$|E
