40|$|THE STORY IN BRIEF: A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine if prescribed cattle grazing could be used to improve pronghorn habitat without fencing. Seven of 87 cows were tracked with global positioning system (GPS) collars for 6 weeks in the summer of 2006. These cows were herded to 20 -ha (50 -acre) <b>target</b> <b>areas</b> that were at least 2. 2 km (1. 4 miles) from water and contained decadent vegetation. Cows were herded daily for half of the study and weekly the remainder of the study. Low-moisture block supplement was placed in <b>target</b> <b>areas.</b> Twenty pronghorn were fitted with very-high frequency (VHF) radio collars and visually observed from May 2006 through December 2006. Cattle spent more time (P = 0. 002) within <b>target</b> <b>areas</b> (14. 9 ± 1. 8 %) than control areas (0. 3 ± 1. 8 %). Fecal abundance of cattle was greater (P = 0. 06) within the <b>target</b> <b>areas</b> than in the control indicating higher preference for the <b>target</b> <b>areas.</b> Daily herding was more successful than herding once per week (P = 0. 05) in holding cattle within the <b>target</b> <b>areas.</b> Cattle readily stayed in or near <b>target</b> <b>areas</b> during the first 3 weeks when the study area faced severe drought conditions. During the second 3 weeks, the study site received above average rainfall, and cattle spent less time near <b>target</b> <b>areas...</b>|$|R

5|$|By July the Allied armies {{were having}} {{difficulty}} advancing against the German forces in Normandy. In {{an attempt to}} create a breakthrough, the Allied air commanders decided to use heavy bombers to attack German positions. The first of these attacks was made on 7 July by 467 Bomber Command aircraft and targeted German forces near Caen, as well as the city itself. The Australian contribution to this raid included 20 Lancasters from No.460 Squadron and 14 Halifaxes from No.466 Squadron as well as aircrew in RAF units. One of No.460 Squadron's aircraft made a crash landing within the Allied beachhead after being damaged by German anti-aircraft guns, but its crew survived and were evacuated to the UK. While the attack devastated Caen, the ground troops were only able to capture the northern half of the city when they advanced on 8 July. All four Australian heavy bomber squadrons participated in a series of attacks on German positions on 18 July as part of Operation Goodwood, but this offensive also failed to result in a breakthrough. On 30 July, No.463, No.466 and No.467 Squadrons contributed aircraft to another major bombardment of German positions near Caumont ahead of Operation Bluecoat; 693 heavy bombers took part in this attack, of which 39 were from the Australian squadrons, but many did not drop their bombs as cloud obscured the aiming markers in the <b>target</b> <b>area.</b> All four Australian heavy bomber squadrons participated in the next major attack, which took place on the night of 7/8 August to support Operation Totalize, but cloud and smoke again prevented many of the bombers from attacking the <b>target</b> <b>area.</b> The four squadrons also attacked German Army positions on 14 August in support of Operation Tractable; visibility was clear over most of the <b>target</b> <b>area,</b> and the raids were considered successful. By this time the Allied armies had successfully broken out of Normandy, and no further heavy bomber attacks were required.|$|E

The pilot {{had failed to}} load enough fuel on the reconnaissance aircraft and had to refuel at a Laotian base on the return trip to Udorn. Since United States armed forces personnel were never officially acknowledged as being in Laos, the United States Ambassador to Laos became enraged that U.S. personnel had been spotted in uniform at the remote refueling field in Laos.|$|E
5|$|Royal Air Force (RAF) heavy bombers {{conducted}} {{a series of}} unsuccessful raids on Tirpitz shortly after the battleship arrived in Norway from Germany in January 1942. Tirpitz was initially based at Fættenfjord near Trondheim, which lay within range of British bombers flying from Scotland. The first raid took place on 30 January, and involved nine Handley Page Halifax and seven Short Stirling bombers. Due to cloud over the <b>target</b> <b>area,</b> only one of the bombers sighted Tirpitz and none inflicted any damage. One Halifax crashed into the sea on its way back to Scotland, but its crew were rescued. The next raid on Fættenfjord took place on 30 March, with the attacking force comprising 33 Halifaxes. The operation was again frustrated by heavy clouds over the <b>target</b> <b>area.</b> Four of the Halifaxes were shot down, and two others crashed while returning to base. Another attack was mounted by 30 Halifaxes and 11 Avro Lancasters on the night of 27/28 April. Tirpitz was located and attacked by the aircraft of the first wave, but no damage was inflicted and five heavy bombers were lost. The final raid in this series took place the next night, and involved 21 Halifaxes and 12 Lancasters. The attackers found Tirpitz covered in a protective smokescreen, and the battleship again escaped damage; two British aircraft were destroyed.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{focus of}} this study is to use a physically-based, {{distributed}} hydrologic model to estimate the impacts of cloud seeding efforts on the streamflow generated within the areas of the Walker River Basin targeted by the Nevada seeding program. The hydrologic model is calibrated using GIS information, model default values, and manual calibration to fit observed streamflow at a USGS surface water station within the Walker River Basin. The calibrated model is then used in two case studies that are designed to simulate a non-seeded condition and a seeded condition with a 10 % increase in precipitation on the five <b>target</b> <b>areas.</b> The results from the two modeling case studies indicate that the additional precipitation applied in the seeded case results in increases in evaporation and runoff from the <b>target</b> <b>areas</b> but does not significantly impact the storages of moisture in the groundwater and soil zone for all of the five <b>target</b> <b>areas.</b> The fraction of seeding-increased precipitation that resulted in streamflow varied from 49 % to 89 % among the different <b>target</b> <b>areas.</b> The remainder of the additional precipitation resulted in evapotranspiration from the <b>target</b> <b>areas...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{motor cortex}} orchestrates simple to complex motor {{behaviors}} through its output projections to <b>target</b> <b>areas.</b> The primary (MOp) and secondary (MOs) motor cortices {{are known to}} produce specific output projections that are targeted to both similar and different <b>target</b> <b>areas.</b> These projections are further divided into layer 5 and 6 neuronal outputs, thereby producing four cortical outputs that may <b>target</b> other <b>areas</b> in a combinatorial manner. However, the precise network structure that integrates these four projections remains poorly understood. Here, we constructed a whole-brain, three-dimensional (3 D) map showing the tract pathways and targeting locations of these four motor cortical outputs in mice. Remarkably, these motor cortical projections showed unique and separate tract pathways despite <b>targeting</b> similar <b>areas.</b> Within <b>target</b> <b>areas,</b> various combinations of these four projections were defined based on specific 3 D spatial patterns, reflecting anterior-posterior, dorsal-ventral, and core-capsular relationships. This 3 D topographic map ultimately provides evidence for the relevance of comparative connectomics: motor cortical projections known to be convergent are actually segregated in many <b>target</b> <b>areas</b> with unique <b>targeting</b> patterns, a finding that has anatomical value for revealing functional subdomains {{that have not been}} classified by conventional methods. © 2016, Nature Publishing Group.
