40|$|<b>Tiger</b> <b>frog</b> virus (TFV), in {{the genus}} Ranavirus {{of the family}} Iridoviridae, causes high {{mortality}} of cultured <b>tiger</b> <b>frog</b> tadpoles in China. To explore the cellular entry mechanism of TFV, HepG 2 cells were treated with drugs that inhibit the main endocytic pathways. We observed that TFV entry was inhibited by NH 4 Cl, chloroquine, and bafilomycin, which can all elevate the pH of acidic organelles. In contrast, TFV entry was not influenced by chlorpromazine or overexpression of a dominant-negative form of Esp 15, which inhibit the assembly of clathrin-coated pits. These results suggested that TFV entry {{was not associated with}} clathrin-mediated endocytosis, but was related to the pH of acidic organelles. Subsequently, we found that endocytosis of TFV was dependent on membrane cholesterol and was inhibited by the caveolin- 1 scaffolding domain peptide. Dynamin and actin were also required for TFV entry. In addition, TFV virions colocalized with the cholera toxin subunit B, indicating that TFV enters as caveola-internalized cargo into the Golgi complex. Taken together, our results demonstrated that TFV entry occurs by caveola-mediated endocytosis with a pH-depen-dent step. This atypical caveola-mediated endocytosis is different from the clathrin-mediated endocytosis of frog virus 3 (FV 3) by BHK cells, which has been recognized as a model for iridoviruses. Thus, our work ma...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe have {{isolated}} a <b>tiger</b> <b>frog</b> virus (TFV) from diseased tiger frogs, Rana tigrina rugulosa. The genome was {{a linear}} double-stranded DNA of 105, 057 basepairs in length with a base composition of 55. 01 % G+C. About 105 open reading frames were identified with coding capacities for polypeptides ranging from 40 to 1294 amino acids. Computer-assisted {{analyses of the}} deduced amino acid sequences revealed that 39 of 105 putative gene products showed significant homology to functionally characterized proteins of other species in the GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ databases. These proteins included enzymes and structural proteins involved in virus replication, transcription, modification, and virus–host interaction. The deduced amino acid sequences of TFV gene products showed more than 90 % identity to FV 3, but a low degree of similarity among TFV, ISKNV, and LCDV- 1.

40|$|AbstractWe {{describe}} the specific silencing of reporter gene lacZ in FHM cells (muscle cells of fathead minnow, a fish cell line) by either expressing small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) from plasmids or transfecting small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) transcribed in vitro. Two types of dsRNAs could inhibit reporter gene expression, and siRNAs were more effective, while {{both of them}} worked very well in HeLa cells. siRNAs were tested for silencing expression of the major capsid protein (MCP) encoded by <b>tiger</b> <b>frog</b> virus (TFV), an iridovirus causing severe disease in fish. siRNAs targeting mcp gene effectively inhibited TFV replication in fish cells as demonstrated by reduced mcp RNA level, postponed emergence of cytopathogenic effect, as well as reduced TFV titer and particles in cells. The {{results suggest that the}} siRNA method suppressed TFV efficiently in fish cells, providing a potential approach to the therapy of aquaculture viral diseases...|$|E
40|$|Laribacter hongkongensis is a {{recently}} discovered novel bacterium associated with community-acquired gastroenteritis. Although the bacterium has been isolated from freshwater fish and natural freshwater environments, {{it is not}} known if other freshwater animals could also be a source of L. hongkongensis. In a surveillance study on freshwater food animals (other than fish) in Hong Kong, L. hongkongensis was isolated from eight of 10 Chinese <b>tiger</b> <b>frogs</b> (Hoplobatrachus chinensis), a widespread frog species commonly consumed in China and southeast Asia. The large intestine was the site with the highest recovery rate, followed by the small intestine and stomach. None of the 30 Malaysian prawns, 20 pieces of sand shrimp, 20 Chinese mystery snails or 10 Chinese soft-shelled turtles was found to harbor the bacterium. Among the eight positive frogs, a total of 26 isolates of L. hongkongensis, confirmed by phenotypic tests and PCR, were obtained. As with human, freshwater fish and natural water isolates, a heterogeneous population of L. hongkongensis in frogs was identified by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, with 6 different patterns among the 26 isolates and a single frog often carrying different strains. The present report represents the first to describe the isolation of L. hongkongensis from amphibians. The high isolation rate and genetic heterogeneity of L. hongkongensis among the Chinese <b>tiger</b> <b>frogs</b> suggested that these animals are also natural reservoir for the bacterium. Caution should be exercised in handling and cooking these frogs. © 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Hearing {{sensitivity}} affects {{survival and}} reproduction in animals that communicate vocally. The Chinese <b>tiger</b> <b>frog</b> exhibits sexual dimorphism in body size, reflecting {{the evolution of}} mating behaviour and life-history strategies. In this study, we recorded auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) to determine hearing sensitivity in both female and male frogs. We also compared male and female hearing characteristics with {{the shape of the}} tympanic membrane in light of previous studies showing that smaller middle ear cavities improve hearing sensitivity. We found that ABR thresholds differ significantly between males and females, with the greatest sensitivities in both sexes at frequencies close to the dominant frequency of male calls. ABR thresholds were significantly lower in females compared to males for frequencies in the 0. 9 - 1. 3 kHz range and at 1. 6 kHz. The tympanic membrane diameter was significantly smaller in females (5. 94 +/- 0. 87 mm) than in males (6. 71 +/- 0. 49 mm).

40|$|International audienceTiger frog virus (TFV), dsDNA virus of {{the genus}} Ranavirus and family Iridoviridae, causes a high {{mortality}} of <b>tiger</b> <b>frog</b> tadpoles cultured in Southern China. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) {{have been identified in}} many viruses especially DNA viruses such as Singapore Grouper Iridoviruses (SGIV). MicroRNAs play important roles in regulating gene expression for virus subsistence in host. Considering that TFV infects cells of different species under laboratory conditions, we aim to identify the specific and essential miRNAs expressed in ZF 4 and HepG 2 cells. We identified and predicted novel viral miRNAs in TFV-infected ZF 4 and HepG 2 cells by deep sequencing and software prediction. Then, we verified and described the expression patterns of TFV-encoded miRNAs by using qRT-PCR and Northern blot. Deep sequencing predicted 24 novel TFV-encoded miRNAs, and qRT-PCR verified 19 and 23 miRNAs in TFV-infected ZF 4 (Group Z) and HepG 2 (Group H) cells, respectively. Northern blot was performed to validate eight and five TFV-encoded miRNAs in Groups H and Z, respectively. We compared the expression of TFV-encoded miRNAs from two groups and defined TFV-miR- 11 as the essential viral miRNA and TFV-miR- 13 and TFV-miR- 14 as the specific miRNAs that contribute to HepG 2 cell infection. We identified novel viral miRNAs and compared their expression in two host cells.

40|$|Abstract Background Soft-shelled turtle iridovirus (STIV) is the causative {{agent of}} severe {{systemic}} diseases in cultured soft-shelled turtles (Trionyx sinensis). To our knowledge, the only molecular information available on STIV mainly concerns the highly conserved STIV major capsid protein. The complete {{sequence of the}} STIV genome is not yet available. Therefore, determining the genome sequence of STIV and providing a detailed bioinformatic analysis of its genome content and evolution status will facilitate further understanding of the taxonomic elements of STIV and the molecular mechanisms of reptile iridovirus pathogenesis. Results We determined the complete nucleotide sequence of the STIV genome using 454 Life Science sequencing technology. The STIV genome is 105 890 bp in length with a base composition of 55. 1 % G+C. Computer assisted analysis revealed that the STIV genome contains 105 potential open reading frames (ORFs), which encode polypeptides ranging from 40 to 1, 294 amino acids and 20 microRNA candidates. Among the putative proteins, 20 share homology with the ancestral proteins of the nuclear and cytoplasmic large DNA viruses (NCLDVs). Comparative genomic analysis showed that STIV has the highest degree of sequence conservation and a colinear arrangement of genes with frog virus 3 (FV 3), followed by <b>Tiger</b> <b>frog</b> virus (TFV), Ambystoma tigrinum virus (ATV), Singapore grouper iridovirus (SGIV), Grouper iridovirus (GIV) and other iridovirus isolates. Phylogenetic analysis based on conserved core genes and complete genome sequence of STIV with other virus genomes was performed. Moreover, analysis of the gene gain-and-loss events in the family Iridoviridae suggested that the genes encoded by iridoviruses have evolved for favoring adaptation to different natural host species. Conclusion This study has provided the complete genome sequence of STIV. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that STIV and FV 3 are strains of the same viral species belonging to the Ranavirus genus in the Iridoviridae family. Given virus-host co-evolution and the phylogenetic relationship among vertebrates from fish to reptiles, we propose that iridovirus might transmit between reptiles and amphibians and that STIV and FV 3 are strains of the same viral species in the Ranavirus genus. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Many viral {{pathogens}} {{are poorly}} characterized, {{are difficult to}} culture or reagents are lacking for confirmatory diagnoses. We have developed and tested a robust assay for detecting and characterizing large DNA viruses and adenoviruses. The assay {{is based on the}} use of degenerate PCR to target a gene common to these viruses, the DNA polymerase, and sequencing the products. Results We evaluated our method by applying it to fowl adenovirus isolates, catfish herpesvirus isolates, and largemouth bass ranavirus (iridovirus) from cell culture and lymphocystis disease virus (iridovirus) and avian poxvirus from tissue. All viruses with the exception of avian poxvirus produced the expected product. After optimization of extraction procedures, and after designing and applying an additional primer we were able to produce polymerase gene product from the avian poxvirus genome. The sequence data that we obtained demonstrated the simplicity and potential of the method for routine use in characterizing large DNA viruses. The adenovirus samples were demonstrated to represent 2 types of fowl adenovirus, fowl adenovirus 1 and an uncharacterized avian adenovirus most similar to fowl adenovirus 9. The herpesvirus isolate from blue catfish was shown to be similar to channel catfish virus (Ictalurid herpesvirus 1). The case isolate of largemouth bass ranavirus was shown to exactly match the type specimen and both were similar to <b>tiger</b> <b>frog</b> virus and frog virus 3. The lymphocystis disease virus isolate from largemouth bass was shown to be related but distinct from the two previously characterized lymphocystis disease virus isolates suggesting that it may represent a distinct lymphocystis disease virus species. Conclusion The method developed is rapid and broadly applicable to cell culture isolates and infected tissues. Targeting a specific gene for in the large DNA viruses and adenoviruses provide a common reference for grouping the newly identified viruses according to relatedness to sequences of reference viruses and the submission of the sequence data to GenBank will build the database to make the BLAST analysis a valuable resource readily accessible by most diagnostic laboratories. We demonstrated the utility of this assay on viruses that infect fish and birds. These hosts are phylogenetically distant from mammals yet, sequence data suggests that the assay would work equally as well on mammalian counterparts of these groups of viruses. Furthermore, we demonstrated that obtaining genetic information on routine diagnostic samples has great potential for revealing new virus strains and suggesting the presence of new species. </p...|$|E
