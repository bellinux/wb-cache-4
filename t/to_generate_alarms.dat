From 2010 to 2016, two Point-Of-Care (POC) laboratories have been successfully implemented in the rural Saloum region of Senegal.

This temporal boosting algorithm considers time explicitly in the weak classifiers, leading to an improvement in noise robustness and performance.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze the coordinated port scan attack where a single adversary {{coordinates}} a Group of Attackers (GoA) {{in order to}} obtain information on a set of target networks. Such orchestration aims at avoiding Local Intrusion Detection Systems checks allowing each host of the GoA to send a very few number of probes to hosts of the target network. In order to detect this complex attack we propose a collaborative architecture where each target network deploys local sensors that send alarms to a collaborative layer. This, in turn, correlates this data with the aim of (i) identifying coordinated attacks while (ii) reducing false positive alarms and (iii) correctly separating GoAs that act concurrently on overlapping targets. Locally deployed sensors adopt graph-based clustering techniques over non-established TCP connections <b>to</b> <b>generate</b> <b>alarms.</b> The collaborative layer employs a similarity approach to aggregate alarms and approximated optimization algorithms to separate distinct GoAs. The soundness of our approach is tested on real network traces.

Today they have an additional mandate: they must provide a well-identified service to Users and/or to Customers.

Data products or derived information must be elaborated rapidly in order to either authorise a near real time direct dissemination of data to Users or <b>to</b> <b>generate</b> <b>alarms</b> (e. g. for forest fire detection).

40|$|Abstract — Internet {{backbone}} {{networks are}} under constant flux, {{so as to}} keep up with demand and to offer new features. The pace of change in features and technology often outstrips the pace of introduction of the associated fault monitoring capabilities that are built into today’s IP protocols and routers. Moreover, some of these new technologies cross networking layers, raising the potential for unanticipated interactions and service disruptions, which the built-in capabilities in each layer may not detect. A key threat to network integrity are “silent failures ” or “black holes,” where network protocols and routers provide no associated alert or response (e. g., routing does not adapt and reconverge), yet some packets are silently dropped at an intermediate point between source and destination or packet delivery performance is silently degraded. In this paper, we present a simple and effective method to detect and diagnose such silent failures. Our method uses active measurement between edge routers <b>to</b> <b>generate</b> <b>alarms</b> whenever connectivity is disrupted end to end. The measurements feed localization agents, which apply spatial correlation techniques to localize the root-cause of failure. In our experience using two real-systems deployed on sections of a tier-I ISP network, we show that the method works with accuracy exceeding 80 % for different type of failure scenarios with extremely high precision (greater than 80 %). Further, we show how to tune the tool to make it more effective and precise for network operators. I...|$|E

In line with these functions, {{based on the results}} of detecting, tracking and recognition, the system will be able <b>to</b> <b>generate</b> <b>alarms</b> automatically. Through the experiments, the related methods and algorithms applied to the proposed approach provide better performance for the purpose of alarm making, thus it could be helpful in reducing the manual labor of security staff. The contributions of this thesis are: Firstly, the shortcomings and deficiencies of the traditional surveillance and alarm systems have been studied. Secondly, computer vision techniques have been utilized to allow the system to work with different environments. Thirdly, dual artificial neural networks have been innovatively deployed for abnormal events detection and to improve the accuracy of alarming to reduce false alarms. The overall result for the false alarm rate of the system developed in this project is 13. 8 % which is lower that the mainstream 15. 27 % and also helpful for the management of traffic environments.

With a careful analysis of the generated data it is possible to learn new information that could revolutionize the operation of a given environment. One of the main applications is the security management of a given environment (Minoli et al. 2017). Through real-time analysis of the collected data by the various sensors and analyzers, it is possible to alert the interested parties about unexpected or undesired situations that are happening, or that may happen in the immediate future if no action is taken. By means of sensors of temperature, CO 2, air quality, humidity, among others, it is possible <b>to</b> <b>generate</b> <b>alarms</b> for values that are outside the normal interval. In addition, energy consumption can play a very important role. Comparing real-time consumption with consumption profiles, identified in historical data, can identify equipment failures, unnecessarily connected equipment, and the presence of unauthorized persons. However, the success of this application depends greatly on the ability of the system to identify the different contexts of consumption existing in the environment in matter. For example, in a company that only works on weekdays, the system should not identify equipment failures over the weekend, since the low consumption is expected in this context.|$|E

Knock-on effects can also be felt across telecommunications infrastructures as the uninterruptible power supplies (UPS’) that protect mobile phone base stations fail over time.
