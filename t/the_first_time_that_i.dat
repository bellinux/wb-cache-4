500|$|After the Restoration and King Charles II's {{return to}} London on 29 May 1660, a pall-mall court was {{constructed}} in St James's Park {{just south of the}} wall, on the site of The Mall.

The court for pall-mall was very long and narrow, and often known as an alley, so the old court provided a suitable route for relocating the eastern approach to St James's Palace. A grant was made to Dan O'Neale, Groom of the Bedchamber, and John Denham, Surveyor of the King's Works allocating a [...] area of land for this purpose. The grant was endorsed [...] "Our warrant for the building of the new street to St James's." ...|$|E

2500|$|Robert Peel, {{often called}} the [...] "model Prime Minister", {{was the first to}} {{recognise}} this new role. After the successful Conservative campaign of 1841, J. W. Croker said in a letter to Peel, [...] "The elections are wonderful, and the curiosity is that all turns on the name of Sir Robert Peel. It's <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> remember in our history that the people have chosen the first Minister for the Sovereign. Mr. Pitt's case in '84 is the nearest analogy; but then the people only confirmed the Sovereign's choice; here every Conservative candidate professed himself in plain words to be Sir Robert Peel's man, and on that ground was elected." ...|$|E

2500|$|The book {{begins in}} late December 1936. Orwell {{describes}} {{the atmosphere in}} Barcelona as it appears to him at this time. [...] "The anarchists were still in virtual control of Catalonia and the revolution was still in full swing ... It was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had {{ever been in a}} town where the working class was in the saddle ... every wall was scrawled with the hammer and sickle ... every shop and café had an inscription saying that it had been collectivized."

[...] Jackson contacted Kahn directly to direct the video, saying [...] "I was star struck on Janet for sure, because that was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> really dealt with someone that was in my youth. I studied Janet Jackson videos growing up. So to finally see myself {{face to face with}} her and working with her and her calling me on a first name basis and calling my home and tracking me down on my cell phone… like her leaving messages, it was the weirdest thing." [...] Kahn continued [...] "And Janet, she really is elegant, she’s like royalty. Even though she’s talking to you and trying to be normal, she’s not – she’s Janet Jackson – and you can never get that out of your head. You realize that she’s a real person and she’s got just the same emotions as everyone else, but you can never get around the fact that she’s special." ...|$|E
