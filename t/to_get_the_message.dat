5|$|Elsewhere, about 150 men {{landed at}} Cape Murro di Porco and {{captured}} a radio station. Based on a warning of imminent glider landings transmitted by the station's previous occupants, the local Italian commander ordered a counter-attack but his troops failed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>message.</b> The scattered {{nature of the}} landings now worked in the brigade's favour as {{they were able to}} cut all telephone wires in the immediate area. Forces at the bridge came under repeated attacks from the Italians while the expected 5th Infantry Division relief did not appear at 10:00 as planned. By 15:30 only 15 of men at the bridge remained fit to fight and they were out of ammunition, as a result the Italians then recaptured the bridge. The first unit from the 5th Division, the 2nd Northamptonshire Regiment of the 17th Brigade, arrived at the bridge at 16:15 and mounted a successful counterattack. The prior removal of demolition charges from the bridge had prevented the Italians from destroying it. The brigade then took no further part in the fighting and was withdrawn back to North Africa on 13 July. During the landings in Sicily, the losses by the 1st Airlanding Brigade were the worst of all the British units involved so far. They amounted to 313 killed and 174 missing or wounded. The accompanying glider pilots lost 14 killed, and a further 87 were missing or wounded.|$|E

500|$|Reaction to {{the release}} was [...] "generally ecstatic", {{according}} to MacDonald, with listeners marvelling at the album's [...] "aural invention". To the Beatles' less progressive fans, however, the radical changes in the band's sound were the source of confusion. The editor of the Australian teen magazine Mirabelle wrote: [...] "Everyone, from Brisbane to Bootle, hates that daft song Lennon sang {{at the end of}} Revolver." [...] In his review for the NME, Allen Evans said, in response to the lyric's exhortation to [...] "relax and float downstream": [...] "But how can you relax with the electronic, outer-space noises, often sounding like seagulls? … Only Ringo's rock-steady drumming is natural." [...] Peter Jones of Record Mirror commented: [...] "You need some sort of aural microscope <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> from this. But it's darned compelling listening." [...] Writing in 1977, author Nicholas Schaffner said that those who had been confused by the lyrics were most likely unfamiliar with hallucinogenic drugs and Timothy Leary's message, but that the transcendental quality became clear during the build-up to the 1967 Summer of Love.|$|E
500|$|Milne {{was with}} Dundee United {{for a further}} three seasons and still a regular player in the team, {{although}} he scored less frequently. Milne's increasingly fractious relationship with manager Jim McLean was also becoming common knowledge; in December 1983 McLean publicly criticised Milne, stating [...] "I have tried <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> across to him that it is {{when he is not}} playing well that he needs to work hardest. It is plainly not sinking in." [...] Ironically some months later in August 1984, it was Milne who scored both goals against Nottingham Forest in a pre-season testimonial match for McLean. However, after the game the pair again fell out because of a brief conversation Milne had with Brian Clough which led McLean to believe the player was trying to arrange a deal away from United; by this time Milne had grown increasingly frustrated over being frequently fined a week's wages for breaking minor club rules and generally offending McLean's strict sense of discipline. The financial strain this caused led to him to work as a casual labourer in order to meet his mortgage repayments. By this time his drinking had become more of a problem, resulting in a struggle to maintain fitness.|$|E
2500|$|Dent also {{denied the}} {{rationality}} and wisdom typically attributed to Theseus. He reminded his readers {{that this is}} the character of Theseus from Greek mythology, a creation himself of [...] "antique fable". Theseus' views on art are far from rational or wise. He can't tell the difference between an actual play and its interlude. The interlude of the play's acting troop is less about the art and more of an expression of the mechanicals' distrust of their own audience. They fear the audience reactions will be either excessive or inadequate, and say so on stage. Theseus fails <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>message.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The Courtesy Campaign website [...] {{was set up}} as a {{means of}} {{reaching}} out and staying relevant to a new generation of Singaporeans that used the computer and the Internet regularly. Additionally, this new generation of Singaporeans is seen to actively use Singlish, an English-based creole language that has strong Malay and Mandarin influences native to Singapore, {{as a means of}} casual communication with one another. It is thus unsurprising that the choice of language on the website being only English, would be deemed sufficient {{to reach out to the}} younger Singaporeans. Still, this is a departure from previous efforts in the campaign where English, Mandarin, Malay and Tamil would be used <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> across.|$|E
2500|$|In 1967 Paine {{suggested}} the band write rock music with Christian content {{for use in}} the church, following the tradition of Bach who used popular tavern songs in his music. [...] "At that time, there were virtually no albums available to a national audience that could remotely be described as Christian rock; it's impossible to overstate how radical the [...] "Electric Liturgy" [...] was in that context. The Mind Garage, which never limited itself to one style of music began composing the Electric Liturgy in Paine's attic with a serious intent <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> across. The Electric Liturgy was conceived as an orthodox Episcopalian service, but was immediately transformed into an inter-denominational service by the people themselves. It was not uncommon to witness Episcopalians, Catholics, Protestants and Jews together, all taking Communion. People who were out of religion found a meaning in the music.|$|E

2500|$|Partly {{because the}} group lived {{for three months}} in {{northeast}} Brazil, the band's first album shows clear influences of Brazilian music, mixed with symphonic rock and jazz. But the band's first live concert to support the album created {{one of the strangest}} anecdotes in Argentine rock: the fans did not understand the strange costumes the band used (entirely in white except for Garcia with a black jacket and shoes); and then when they played the song [...] "Disco Shock", a satire poking fun at disco music (which was at its height in 1978), people thought they were really serious. Whistles and boos would follow and {{what should have been a}} great concert turned into a fiasco, with fans clamoring for Sui Generis songs. People failed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> and Serú Girán did not get their point across too well either.

60|$|A {{cablegram}} two {{or three}} days since stated that she had sailed, and Cartwright, who knew the St. Lawrence, calculated the progress she ought to have made. Perhaps he had cut things rather fine, but Captain Davies was a good navigator and would push on. Although the narrow waters below Montreal, where the stream runs fast between the islands, would be open, Lake St. Peter was freezing, and the liner Parthian had some trouble to get through. Still the channels were not yet blocked, and when Davies had passed the Narrows he would get open water down the gorge to Quebec. Allowing for cautious navigation, Davies ought to be near Rimouski {{at the mouth of the}} river, and his passing would, no doubt, soon be telegraphed from the signal station. Cartwright admitted that <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> would be some relief.|$|E
