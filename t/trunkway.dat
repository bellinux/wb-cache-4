50|$|Gillman {{has been}} the home of Motorcycle Speedway in Adelaide since 1981 when the 280-metre (920-foot) North Arm Speedway opened. The speedway, located on the Grand <b>Trunkway,</b> {{operated}} from 1981 until its forced closure in 1997. Since 1998 it has been home to a larger motorcycle speedway venue, the 300-metre-long (985-foot) Gillman Speedway, located on Wilkins Road.|$|E
50|$|Over {{the winter}} months the {{pin-hole}} leak developed into a split, and {{a crack in the}} 16-inch pipework outside the buoy allowed water and oil to flood the central <b>trunkway.</b> This caused the buoy to lose more of its buoyancy. The loss of buoyancy in turn caused the upper U-joint to go into compression which allowed the 2,404 pound U-joint pin to wrench itself free.|$|E
50|$|Today {{the site}} of North Arm Speedway shows nothing of its past as a {{speedway}} as industrial buildings now occupy the land. The last remnants of the speedway were removed in mid-2004 when {{what was left of}} the track itself was cleared and building starting in mid-2005. When looking on Google Earth at historic photos the start/finish line of the speedway was on the Grand <b>Trunkway</b> (road) side of the track, with the pit area located between the front straight and the road. Car parking for the speedway was in the area to the north of the track.|$|E
