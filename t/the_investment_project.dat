40|$|A {{large number}} of economic, financial, social, technological, {{ecological}} – environmental and other indicators define the effectiveness of <b>the</b> <b>investment</b> <b>projects.</b> According {{to some of the}} indicators, <b>the</b> alternative <b>investment</b> <b>project</b> is suitable for putting it into practice, according to others, it is not. Therefore, while evaluating <b>the</b> <b>investment</b> <b>projects</b> (e. g. <b>the</b> projects which are financed by EU structural funds) it becomes difficult to choose the most effective projects whose realization would bring the most significant benefit to the economy subject and to our country. It is possible to get objective answers about the effectiveness of <b>the</b> alternative <b>investment</b> <b>projects</b> by evaluating them according to multicriterial methods. With the help of such methods it is possible to evaluate <b>the</b> <b>investment</b> <b>projects</b> comprehensively by presenting one generalized indicator.

The multicriterial evaluation method analyzed in the article gave the possibility {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the projects chosen, and to set the priority level of these projects. From the analysis carried out, it is obvious that three <b>investment</b> <b>projects</b> are suitable for being financed and put into practice, and the remaining ones have to be rejected or corrected.
