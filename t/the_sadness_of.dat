Before she died, she made her husband promise to protect her sister from arrest, to which both he and Zélie concealed the truth by planting Margaret's body {{at the foot of a}} cliff and fabricating the story that it was Dorothea who had died. Dorothea then took her sister's place. While she fooled the servants easily, she could not fool the Ravenscrofts' dog, which could distinguish between the sisters, thus explaining why it bit her. A month later, Alistair murdered her to prevent her from injuring anyone else, making certain she held the revolver before she was killed, and then committed suicide afterwards.

500|$|The {{score is}} a sparse {{arrangement}} of strings and piano (with {{the addition of}} oboe and harp in one cut), intended to convey <b>the</b> <b>sadness</b> <b>of</b> the King's muteness, and then the growing warmth of friendship between him and Logue. The minimalist approach emphasises the protagonist's struggle for control. Desplat used the repetition of a single note to represent the stickiness of the King's speech. As the film progresses, growing banks of warm strings swaddle the deepening friendship between the two leads. The music rises to a climax in the coronation scene. Hooper originally wanted to film the scene without music, but Desplat {{argued that it was}} the real climax of the story—the point when the friendship was ratified by their decision to trust each other.

[...] For the second track, the reviewer commended the song's composition and production and called it a [...] "summery, refreshing dance tune."

500|$|TV Fanatic {{gave the}} episode 4 out of 5 stars, writing [...] "Simpsons Season 26 starts {{off with a}} bang, with plenty of laughs {{and even a few}} sentimental moments". Tony Sokol of Den of Geek gave the episode 4 stars out of 5, commenting 'Clown in the Dumps' may not be {{considered}} a classic episode now, but after a few years when we watch it again on syndication, probably next year on FXX, it will grow in stature. It is a heartfelt episode that does bring on the laughs. <b>The</b> <b>sadness</b> <b>of</b> the episode to me was Jackie Mason's voice, which sounds very tired. Paste gave the episode a rating of 7.1, concluding These days, The Simpsons can be hit or miss, and there was nothing to guarantee success from 'Clown in the Dumps'. However, even if the character death was perfunctory, and Rabbi Krustofski has made only a handful of appearances in over 550 episodes, it was still a funny, solid half hour of television. Nothing special—really, it was just another Krusty episode, and not the best Krusty episode. Nevertheless, the 26th season of The Simpsons has started out on somewhat of a high note. The good times keep on rolling for Matt Groening's deathless creation.|$|E

500|$|One major {{breakthrough}} was {{the composition of}} the song [...] "Let It Go" [...] by songwriters Lopez and Anderson-Lopez, which forced the production team to reconceptualize and rewrite Elsa as a far more complex, vulnerable, and sympathetic character. In The Daily Telegraphs words, instead of the villain envisioned by the producers, the songwriters saw Elsa as [...] "a scared girl struggling to control and come to terms with her gift." [...] Lee recalled: [...] "Bobby and Kristen said they were walking in Prospect Park and they just started talking about what would it feel like [...] Forget villain. Just what it would feel like. And this concept of letting out who she is that she's kept to herself for so long and she's alone and free, but then <b>the</b> <b>sadness</b> <b>of</b> the fact [...] that the last moment is she's alone. It’s not a perfect thing, but it's powerful." [...] Del Vecho explained that [...] "Let It Go" [...] changed Elsa into a person [...] "ruled by fear and Anna was ruled by her own love of other people and her own drive," [...] which in turn caused Lee to [...] "rewrite the first act and then that rippled through the entire movie. So that was when we really found the movie and who these characters were." ...|$|E
500|$|Critics at the {{beginning}} of the 20th century believed that the poem's use of sound and tone made it great. The French critic Louis Cazamian claimed in 1927 that Gray [...] "discovered rhythms, utilised the power of sounds, and even created evocations. The triumph of this sensibility allied to so much art is to be seen in the famous Elegy, which from a somewhat reasoning and moralizing emotion has educed a grave, full, melodiously monotonous song, in which a century weaned from the music of the soul tasted all <b>the</b> <b>sadness</b> <b>of</b> eventide, of death, and of the tender musing upon self." [...] I. A. Richards, following in 1929, declared that the merits of the poem come from its tone: [...] "poetry, which has no other very remarkable qualities, may sometimes take very high rank simply because the poet's attitude to his listenersin view of what he has to sayis so perfect. Gray and Dryden are notable examples. Gray's Elegy, indeed, might stand as a supreme instance to show how powerful an exquisitely adjusted tone may be. It would be difficult to maintain that the thought in this poem is either striking or original, or that its feeling is exceptional." [...] He continued: [...] "the Elegy may usefully remind us that boldness and originality are not necessities for great poetry. But these thoughts and feelings, in part because of their significance and their nearness to us, are peculiarly difficult to express without faults... Gray, however, without overstressing any point composes a long address, perfectly accommodating his familiar feelings towards the subject and his awareness of the inevitable triteness of the only possible reflections, to the discriminating attention of his audience. And this is the source of his triumph." ...|$|E
500|$|Joshua Rothkopf of Time Out New York {{referred}} {{to being a}} [...] "must-see danceumentary." [...] Rothkopf described Jackson as [...] "obviously" [...] having been [...] "shooting for the moon right before his death" [...] {{based on what he}} could tell from the [...] "stunning bits of concert spectacle" [...] of [...] "phalanxes of computer-generated dancers, tempo changes on a dime, a bombshell of a blond guitarist who plays Eddie Van Halen's [...] "Beat It" [...] solo flawlessly". Rothkopf stated that: [...] "But the true value of this raw rehearsal footage is its emphasis, less known, on MJ's laserlike attention to detail, as he works his band and troupe up to speed. A firm floor manager himself, he's often exposed — and probably wouldn't have approved of this film. (One on one, High School Musicals Kenny Ortega, meanwhile, treats him with kid gloves: [...] "I agree, Michael.") But to see him sweetly lose himself in [...] "Human Nature" [...] ("I like living this way...") is to feel a creature of the stage finally returned home, and possibly on the cusp of redemption." [...] Peter Paras, of E! Online felt that watching Jackson and his performances in a positive aspect is the [...] "genius and <b>the</b> <b>sadness</b> <b>of</b> the entire film." [...] He did note that Jackson's performance of [...] "Earth Song," [...] which consists of using Jackson's voiceover to emphasize his environmental concerns while a bulldozer threatens to eat him, was well-intentioned — because it brought attention to environmental concerns — but felt it was a little over the top. Paras felt the film showed an [...] "exacting and refreshingly funny side of Jackson to be revealed" [...] and [...] "had Jackson lived, we never would have seen those moments" [...] and felt the film was a proper way to [...] "finally say goodbye" [...] to Jackson.|$|E

500|$|Snow was {{designed}} by Nao Ikeda and Tetsuya Nomura. He {{was designed}} around a motif of ice, with his bandanna inspired by an unused costume element from Kingdom Hearts coded designed by Kamikokuryo. For XIII-2, the bandanna was removed and {{he was given a}} new hairstyle. Originally to have been called [...] "Storm", the development team nicknamed the character [...] "Mr. 33 cm" [...] in reference to his shoe size while his name was still a secret. Nomura designed his darker look in Lightning Returns. Snow's personality in XIII, which carried over to XIII-2, was created to be passionate, optimistic and impulsive, opposing and acting as a foil for Lightning's cold mannerisms. He has also been described in interviews as the [...] "tough guy" [...] type, and not having a jealous side to him. He was originally to have been a more negative delinquent athletic type, but this was changed to his [...] "big brother" [...] persona. Concerning his stance in Lightning Returns, Kitase described Snow as [...] "struggling with all his might to keep himself from falling apart from <b>the</b> <b>sadness</b> <b>of</b> losing Serah." [...] His design was intended to reflect the state of the world, as he had changed from his lighthearted former self because of the world's fate. His darker portrayal was emulated by his weapon in the opening cinematic. Watanabe enjoyed writing the character's story, as he was able to give Snow scenes where he appeared [...] "cool", rather than taking on a [...] "thankless" [...] roles. VideoGamer.com's Wesley Yin-Poole called his relationship with Lightning and Hope, and the way he coped with Serah's fate, {{one of the most interesting}} aspects of the original game. Aside from his appearance in the XIII games, the character was featured in the rhythm game Theatrhythm Final Fantasy as a subcharacter representing Final Fantasy XIII, and his outfit from that game was featured as an optional character costume in [...] along with Lightning's Guardian Corps uniform. Snow is voiced by Troy Baker in English and by Daisuke Ono in Japanese.|$|E
