The Upasanas (short ritual worship-related sections) are {{considered by some}} scholars as the fifth part. Witzel notes that the rituals, rites and ceremonies described in these ancient texts reconstruct {{to a large degree}} the Indo-European marriage rituals observed in a region spanning the Indian subcontinent, Persia and the European area, and some greater details are found in the Vedic era texts such as the Grhya Sūtras.|$|E
25|$|Antioch, a major {{center of}} Hellenistic Greece, and the third-most {{important}} {{city of the}} Roman Empire, then part of Syria Province, today a ruin near Antakya, Turkey, was where Christians were first so-called and also {{the location of the}} Incident at Antioch. It was the site of an early church, traditionally said to be founded by Peter who is considered the first bishop. The Gospel of Matthew and the Apostolic Constitutions may have been written there. The church father Ignatius of Antioch was its third bishop. The School of Antioch, founded in 270, was one of two major centers of early church learning. The Curetonian Gospels and the Syriac Sinaiticus are two early (pre-Peshitta) New Testament <b>text</b> <b>types</b> associated with Syriac Christianity. It was one of the three whose bishops were recognized at the First Council of Nicaea (325) as exercising jurisdiction over the adjoining territories.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} German advertising {{texts and}} their text linguistic properties within {{a system of}} text typologies. Four different <b>text</b> <b>type</b> classification methods representative of typologies in German text linguistics are considered. Of these, Katharina Reiss's 1976 model is shown {{to be the most}} efficient for a textual analysis of advertising texts. Her communicative-functional approach to text analysis permits distinction of three variants of advertisements: those which appeal to reason, those which appeal to emotion and those which are of a dual nature (mixed). The thesis concentrates on identifying <b>text</b> <b>type</b> and <b>text</b> <b>type</b> variant characteristics by analysing the text constituting techniques, text structure, and the appellative language means...|$|R

Multiple copies may also be grouped into <b>text</b> <b>types</b> (see New Testament <b>text</b> <b>types),</b> with some types judged closer to the hypothetical original than others.

To this end, the Metacognitive Awareness of Reading Strategies Inventory (MARSI) {{test was used to}} assess the use of metacognitive strategies and examine the effect of <b>text</b> <b>type</b> (expository and narrative) on these strategies.

Students reading expository text significantly used more metacognitive reading strategies than those reading narrative texts. It was also seen that more proficient students used the strategies more than less proficient ones. Moreover, there was a linear relationship between motivation and metacognitive reading strategies. However, gender had no significant effect on the use of metacognitive strategies. <br /...|$|R

The time and cost of evaluation, coupled with system prices, make it increasingly less likely that full-scale pre-purchase evaluation by a single potential user will be economic. It is clearly desirable that MT systems should be “generically benchmarked” in some way to agreed standards. Regardless of the particular evaluation metrics used, generic benchmarking requires corpora of <b>typed</b> <b>texts</b> as test material, presupposing a shared notion of <b>text</b> <b>type.</b> Document structure, which is increasingly subject to international standardisation, provides a useful basis for <b>text</b> <b>typing</b> in this context.
