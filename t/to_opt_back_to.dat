40|$|Policing and {{judicial}} cooperation across international borders {{is now an}} expectation, and within the EU, is often mandated, but the desirability of criminal justice cooperation between EU Member States and the UK is now debated. This paper examines recent UK political interventions {{in the field of}} EU criminal law. This has focused upon the so-called ‘block opt-out’ decision whereupon the UK government have to choose whether to ‘opt-out’ en masse of all unamended policing and criminal law instruments entered into prior to the 2009 Lisbon Treaty (under Article 10 (1) of Protocol 36). The paper will look in particular at two EU instruments central to the ongoing and future development of EU policing {{and judicial}} cooperation: the European Arrest Warrant, and the exchange of forensic DNA profiles, fingerprints and vehicle registration details under the Prüm Treaty. While the UK government are asserting (at this point) that they are <b>to</b> <b>opt</b> <b>back</b> ‘in’ <b>to</b> the European Arrest Warrant, they are refraining from <b>opting</b> <b>back</b> in (so remaining ‘out’) of the Prüm Treaty. Examining the rationales {{for the use of the}} opt-out, and the decisions in respect of each of these instruments, the paper will ask whether the choice to ‘opt out’ can be reconciled with the aspiration of securing an EU Area of Freedom, Security and Justice, and whether it is appropriate that the UK should be doing the ‘hokey cokey’ with EU policing and judicial cooperation...|$|R

The team, however, was not as successful in the postseason as they were in 1995. The Colts lost to the Pittsburgh Steelers, this time by a score of 42-14.|$|R

5|$|Day of the Tentacle Remastered {{retains its}} {{two-dimensional}} cartoon-style art, redrawn at higher resolution for modern computers. The high resolution character art was updated {{by a team}} led by Yujin Keim with consultation of Ahern and Chan.

Matt Hanson worked on recreating the background assets in high resolution.

The game includes a more streamlined interaction menu, a command wheel akin to the approach used in Broken Age, but the player can <b>opt</b> <b>to</b> switch <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the original interface.

40|$|Lately, in UiTM, {{there has}} been a hue and cry against {{starting}} programming course with object-oriented programming (OOP), and <b>opting</b> <b>to</b> get <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the procedural paradigm first. This paper is an attempt to dismiss these notions. It argues that the wrong question has been asked. That problem is trivial. Instead, the more pressing question is: "How, in the present state of rapidly changing and expanding IT field, can we effectively teach fundamental programming principles and computer problem solving methodology without clouding the students with syntax and nontransparent tools?" Another related question is "How can we make programming attractive to the new students?" Essentially, it is not the question of when, but how. And what too. In short, we should actually revise our programming pedagogy thoroughly as well as review our programming curriculum. We present our case based on the successful implementation of the minimalist cum black box cum 4 -stage approaches in introducing OOP to beginners of programming in various institutions Our solution nevertheless takes into consideration our own background and constraints...|$|R
