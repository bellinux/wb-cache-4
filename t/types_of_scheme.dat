Currently, the formal income security system for the elderly in Thailand consisted of 3 schemes: the pension scheme for government officials, provident fund and pension for non-agricultural private employees. Problems in each scheme were dis-cussed and recommended changes were suggested. In 2001, these formal schemes covered about 25 % of the working population and only 7 % of them were covered {{by more than one}} scheme. Hence exten-sion of the formal system to covered more working population is essential; and two approaches to expand the coverage were suggested. However strategies beyond pension and provident fund such as providing more working opportunity for the elderly, encouraging support from family and community and improving the procedure to reach the poor elderly can not be overlooked. 1...|$|E
40|$|ABR sources {{react to}} network {{feedback}} by adjusting their trans-mission rates. Most schemes fall {{into one of}} two types depending on what is fed back and where control decision i s made. Explicit Congestion Notification schemes allow sources to make control decisions but only with incomplete information on congestion. Explicit Rate schemes use more accurate congestion information but make the control decision inside the network withou regard to different desires of various sources. In this paper we propose an optimization approach that attempts to combine the advantage of both <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>scheme.</b> The objective is to maximize total util-ity of all sources over their transmission rates. The dual problem suggests treating network links and ABR sources as processors in a distributed computation system to solve the dual problem using gradient projection algorithm. In this system ABR sources select transmission rates that maximize their own benefits and network links adjust bandwidth prices to coordinate the sources ' decisions. We show how to implement such a system using features defined in the ABR standard. We provide an asynchronous distributed algorithm for links and sources and illustrate their behavior with preliminary simulation results. ...|$|E
40|$|Trajectories of {{a signal}} that fluctuates between two states which {{originate}} from single molecule activities have become ubiquitous. Common examples are trajectories of ionic flux through individual membrane-channels, and of photon counts collected from diffusion, activity, and conformational changes of biopolymers. By analyzing the trajectory, one wishes to deduce the underlying mechanism, which is usually described by a multi-substate kinetic scheme. In previous works, we divided kinetic schemes that generate two-state trajectories into two types: reducible schemes and irreducible schemes. We showed that all the information in trajectories generated from reducible schemes is contained in the waiting time probability density functions (PDFs) of the two states. It follows that reducible schemes with the same waiting time PDFs are not distinguishable. In this work, we further characterize the topologies of kinetic schemes, now of irreducible schemes, and further study two-state trajectories from the two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>scheme.</b> We suggest various methods for extracting information about the underlying kinetic scheme from the trajectory (e. g., calculate the binned successive waiting times PDF and analyze the ordered waiting times trajectory), and point out {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of each. We show that the binned successive waiting times PDF is not only more robust than other functions when analyzing finite trajectories, but contains, in most cases, more information about the underlying kinetic scheme than other functions in the limit of infinitely long trajectories. For some cases however, analyzing the ordered waiting times trajectory may supply unique information about the underlying kinetic scheme...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a general theoretical {{framework within which}} a heterogeneous group taxpayers confront a market that supplies a variety of schemes for reducing tax liability, and uses this framework to explore {{the impact of a}} wide range of anti-avoidance policies. Schemes differ in their legal effectiveness and hence in the risks to which they expose taxpayers - risks which go beyond the risk of audit considered in the conventional literature on evasion. Given the individual taxpayer’s circumstances, the prices charged for the schemes and the policy environment, the model predicts (i) whether or not any given taxpayer will acquire a scheme, and (ii) if they do so, which type of scheme they will acquire. The paper then analyses how these decisions, and hence the tax gap, are influenced by four generic types of policy: * Disclosure – earlier information leading to faster closure of loopholes; * Penalties – introduction of penalties for failed avoidance; * Policy Design – fundamental policy changes that design out opportunities for avoidance; * Product Register - the introduction of GAARs or mini-GAARs that give greater clarity about how different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>scheme</b> will be treated. The paper shows that when considering the indirect/behavioural effects of policies on the tax gap it is important to recognise that these operate on two different margins. First policies will have deterrence effects – their impact on the quantum of taxpayers choosing to acquire different types schemes as distinct to acquiring no scheme at all. There will be a range of such deterrence effects reflecting the range of schemes available in the market. But secondly, since different schemes generate different tax gaps, policies will also have switching effects as they induce taxpayers who previously acquired one type of scheme to acquire another. The first three types of policy generate positive deterrence effects but differ in the switching effects they produce. The fourth type of policy produces mixed deterrence effects.

40|$|Small {{and medium}} sized {{enterprises}} (SMEs) play {{an essential role in}} the economy internationally and above all in Europe, where over 20 million SMEs account for around two thirds of jobs and half of turnover in the non-agricultural business sectors. SMEs’ contribution to growth and employment, not to mention innovation, makes them key players in the achievement of the Lisbon Strategy goals (European Investment Bank, 2005). At the same time, restrictions on SMEs’ access to external finance create unwanted obstacles to employment and growth. Whilst there is no indication of generalised market failure across Europe for the supply of finance to SMEs, the Commission has, in a recent Communication, stressed the need for public action as a catalyst {{to the development of the}} markets at European, national and regional levels in three specific areas (European Investment Bank, 2005, p. 6) : 1. the improvement of the framework conditions for SME finance with, in particular, the development of financial markets in the New Member States which suffer from a low level of equity investments and bank lending; 2. early-stage finance, in particular through guarantees and microlending; 3. equity. Innovative small and {{medium sized enterprises}} represent an extremely small proportion of SMEs overall in any country, but they have a relevant role in creating new jobs and in enhancing technological development, with positive fallouts on economic growth. For these firms, financial constraints and serious equity gaps are observed even in the most developed countries, due to market failures, that are particularly significant for this kind of business. For these reasons, policy-makers are developing different types of intervention specifically focused on innovative SMEs (ISMEs), at the national and international level. This chapter analyses the best practices developed in different countries both inside and outside the EU, with the aim of identifying overall best practices on the basis of the concrete results achieved by different schemes, and specifying intervention criteria that could improve the effectiveness of private-public cooperation. The chapter is organized as follows. Section 8. 2 provides an analysis of the motivation for public sector intervention to bridge the equity gap facing innovative SMEs and a description of different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>scheme</b> being developed by policy-makers at the national and international level. Section 8. 3 introduces the guiding lines of the EU approach. Section 8. 4 outlines the key elements of each country study, trying to identify best practices and pioneer schemes suitable for broader application. The countries surveyed are the USA, Israel, UK, Germany, the Netherlands, France and Denmark. Summaries and important conclusions for the implementation and evaluation of public policies and incentive schemes for this sector are provided in Section 8. 5...|$|E

One immediate example of such integration is the increasing popularity of storing and managing personal data using third-party web services, {{as part of the}} emerging trend of cloud computing. Secure management of sensitive data stored online is becoming one of the critical research issues in cloud computing and online privacy protection. In this paper, we propose techniques to achieve content based multimedia retrieval over encrypted databases, which can be used for online management of multimedia data while preserving data privacy. We propose two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> secure retrieval <b>schemes</b> by combining cryptographic techniques, such as order preserving encryption and randomized hash functions, with image processing and information retrieval techniques, such as visual words representation, inverted index, and min-hash. The first <b>type</b> <b>of</b> retrieval <b>schemes</b> scramble visual features extracted from images and allow similarity comparison of the features in their encrypted forms. The second <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>schemes</b> encrypt the state-of-the-art search indexes without significantly affecting their search capability. The two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>schemes</b> are complementary and represent different tradeoffs between user-side computational complexity and communication overhead. Retrieval results on an encrypted color image database and security analysis under different attack models show that retrieval performance comparable to conventional plaintext retrieval schemes can be achieved over encrypted databases while ensuring data confidentiality.
