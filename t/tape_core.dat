40|$|AbstractCorrelation {{between the}} {{critical}} current anisotropy and the textured microstructure of the ex-situ processed MgB 2 tapes with the Fe sheath was studied to obtain basic data {{related to the}} commercial application of the ex-situ processed MgB 2. Ex situ processed MgB 2 tapes were fabricated using newly developed technique to substitute carbon for boron in the MgB 2 compound through the ex situ route. These MgB 2 -xCx tapes showed comparable critical current anisotropy to that of pure MgB 2 tapes, but in higher magnetic fields because of their higher irreversible critical field than the pure MgB 2 tapes. The x-ray pole figure data show that the <b>tape</b> <b>core</b> texturing of the MgB 2 -xCx tapes was moderate, {{but it was a}} slightly higher degree than that of the pure MgB 2 tapes. This result was consistent with results of the critical current anisotropy...|$|E
40|$|X-ray {{diffraction}} {{was used}} to characterise the phase composition and to investigate the formation mechanism of the (Bi,Pb) 2 Sr 2 Ca 2 Cu 3 O 10 phase from the precursor with (Bi,Pb) 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8 as the main phase. The reaction {{is found to be}} a two-dimensional nucleation (random) -growth type, [-(ln(l-F) ] 1 / 2 =kt, where F is the conversional fraction of (Bi,Pb) 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8 phase and t is the sintering time. The magnitude of the critical current of the tape is quantitatively related to the conversional fraction of (Bi,Pb) 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8 to the (Bi,Pb) 2 Sr 2 Ca 2 Cu 3 O 10 phase. In the low fraction regime of (Bi,Pb) 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 Og, the critical current Ic of a tape does not show a simple relationship with the remaining (Bi,Pb) 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8 phase. We argue that other factors such as grain alignment, colony size, contact between colonies, and fine nonsuperconducting particles become important in controlling the critical current density Jc. The predominant weak links seem to be the colony boundaries rather than the (Bi,Pb) 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8 phase in this regime. The two dimensional behaviour of the critical current in (Bi,Pb) 2 Sr 2 Ca 2 Cu 3 O 10 /Ag tapes was observed and analysed by introducing an effective grain misalignment angle, φeff. This angle was found by SEM to be identical to the average crystallographic grain misalignment angle in the superconducting core. Furthermore, after fast neutron irradiation, which is isotropical, the Jc 2 ̆ 7 s of the tapes were modified by the introduction of artificial defects, but the φeff 2 ̆ 7 s remained the same. This proves that the crystallographic misalignment of the grains determines the critical current anisotropy of the tape in a magnetic field, i. e. Ic (B//tape plane) scales with Ic(B_Ltape plane) with the factor sinφeff Therefore, φeff is an intrinsic property of the tape. φeff is found to be around 10 ° in different samples. We propose that this typical value is determined by intrinsic mechanical properties of the (Bi,Pb) 2 Sr 2 Ca 2 Cu 3 O 10 compound and {{is a result of the}} mechanical deformation of the tape during the tape fabrication. From a comparison of different samples, we propose that the pinning ability is the determining factor of Jc when φeff is small enough. The transport critical current of (Bi,Pb) 2 Sr 2 Ca 2 Cu 3 O 10 /Ag tapes was measured in magnetic fields up to 15 T and at temperatures from of 4. 2 to 84 K. At high temperatures, the Jc is strongly anisotropic and the anisotropy increases rapidly with magnetic field, whereas at low temperatures the critical current is less anisotropic and the anisotropy is almost field independent above 1 T. The former case is believed to be in a regime, where pinning limits Jc, at least within some parts of the tape, whereas in the latter case the limitation of Jc by Josephson weak links seems to be the dominant mechanism. In addition, a critical current hysteresis induced by flux trapping in a weak link network is observed, which is more pronounced at low temperatures. From TEM observations of the microstructure we find that the 2 ̆ 2 brick 2 ̆ 2 in the 2 ̆ 2 brick wall 2 ̆ 2 model turns out to be the colony instead of the grain inside the colony. Additionally it is found that colony boundaries parallel to the a,b-plane and intersected boundaries occur much more frequently than boundaries parallel to the c-axis, due to the misalignment of the colonies inside the tape. In a small region near the silver sheath, the colony misalignment is much smaller and boundaries parallel to the c-axis may act as strong links at high temperatures as their interfaces are very clean and well matched. The transport Jc 2 ̆ 7 s in (Bi,Pb) 2 Sr 2 Ca 2 Cu 3 O 10 /Ag tapes at 77 K and higher magnetic fields after neutron irradiation are significantly enhanced. This enhancement is attributed to an improvement in the flux pinning capability of this material by the neutron-induced defects. The angular dependence of Jc is still consistent with two-dimensionality, i. e. flux pinning of pancake and/or Josephson vortices is direcdy confirmed by this transport measurement. Fast neutron irradiation also affects the weak links in a way, which agrees with previous results on unaligned ceramics. However, there are some peculiarities which need further investigation. Short multifilamentary (Bi,Pb) 2 Sr 2 Ca 2 Cu 3 O 10 /Ag tapes were fabricated. The sintering parameters were optimised to be 832 °C and 180 h. X-ray diffraction (XRD) results indicate that the multifilamentary tape consists mainly of pure (Bi,Pb) 2 Sr 2 Ca 2 Cu 3 O 10 with a (00 l) preferred orientation, like the single filamentary tape. Image analysis microscope (IAM) results show that the filaments in the multifilamentary tape have an inhomogeneous mass distribution over the transverse cross-section. AC susceptibility and transport critical current measurements were carried out to evaluate the tapes. The measurements show that the tapes have a critical transition temperature of 110 K and critical current densities ranging from 13, 900 to 17, 000 A/cm 2 at 77 K and zero magnetic field. The Jc-B characteristics of the tapes are discussed in relation to grain alignment. The mass densities of the (Bi,Pb) 2 Sr 2 Ca 2 Cu 3 O 10 /Ag wire and tape vary during the mechanical deformation process, as one of the steps of the oxide-powder-in-tube technique used to fabricate the composite superconductor.

But if the core is made of conductive material, the applied voltage pulse generates the eddy current in the core itself which heats the core and therefore also reduces the overall linear transformer driver (LTD) efficiency.

The model predicts that the same core would behave differently depending on how fast the applied voltage pulse is: in the high frequency limit, the equivalent resistance of the core reduces during the pulse whereas in the low frequency limit it is constant. An important inference is that the energy loss due to the eddy current generation can be reduced by increasing the cross section of the core over the minimum value which is required to avoid its saturation.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the design, implementation, {{and control of}} {{a new class of}} fast tool servos (FTS). The primary thesis contributions include the design and experimental demonstration of: novel ultra-fast electromagnetic actuators, integration of these actuators in a new class of FTS, a novel real-time control computer with 1 million samples per second throughput, MIMO loop shaping techniques for parallel power amplifiers, and a novel configuration and controller tuning method for implementing adaptive feed-forward cancellation control. All of these elements have been successfully used for diamond turning of contoured surfaces. Fast tool servos (FTS) are high bandwidth positioning devices, which, in conjunction with an ultra-precision lathe and diamond tooling, can produce free form surfaces with nanometer-scale resolution, such as required in micro-optical devices and light-enhancing films. The increasing complexity of such surfaces requires more components in shorter spatial wavelengths, and thus drives simultaneously the need for high bandwidth, high acceleration and high accuracy of the FTS. Conventional FTS solutions are based on piezoelectric stacks, which are typically limited to a few micron stroke at 1 kHz operation if not operated in a resonant mode. (cont.) As a promising alternative, this thesis demonstrates electromagnetically driven solutions for fast tool servos. The key new technology in these alternative designs is a new class of ultra fast electromagnetic drivers with thousands of G's acceleration capability in continuous operation. By separating the flux-biasing surfaces from the normal-flux working surfaces, this new driver design has a number of advantages: (1) actuating force linear to both excitation current and displacement, (2) modularity and parallel operating ability, (3) full magnetic stress utilization of normal surfaces, and (4) low heat dissipation. We analyze the operation characteristics, and also provide soft magnetic material selection criteria and motor design guidelines. Based on this ultra fast driver, we designed a linear fast tool servo with the theoretical capability for 1200 G acceleration in continuous operation. To control such positioning devices at bandwidth of over 10 kHz, we developed a real-time computer architecture, utilizing three floating point digital signal processors (DSPs) in conjunction with a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) to significantly increase the processing rate. (cont.) The real-time computer prototype experimentally demonstrated 1 million samples per second real-time control execution with a total latency of 1. 9 microseconds when implementing a representative control algorithm of significant complexity. This processing system has capabilities far beyond what is commercially available for such real-time high-accuracy control tasks. The power amplifier driving the FTS must supply 1 kVA (primarily reactive power) with over 100 kHz bandwidth. We present a solution of using 4 power operational amplifiers in parallel, each capable of supplying one fourth of the total power. To address the coupling issues among channels, a decoupling theory is developed to convert the associated MIMO plant into several SISO sub-plants, and thus ease the analog decentralized controller design of the power amplifier current feedback loops. In order to enhance the FTS repetitive position trajectory tracking and disturbance rejection, adaptive feed-forward cancellation is embedded into a conventional motion control loop in our system. We provide a consistent loop shaping framework and intuitive parameter tuning and trade-off guidelines for this controller structure. (cont.) Experimental results with the first prototype FTS using powder iron cores demonstrate 23 kHz closed-loop bandwidth, as low as 1. 7 nm RMS error, 30 micron stroke, 500 G peak acceleration at 10 kHz open-loop operation, and 2. 1 nm (0. 04 %) error in tracking a 3 kHz sinusoid of 16 micron p-v. (The full 1200 G capability is expected to be experimentally demonstrated by the second prototype FTS using Ni-Fe <b>tape</b> <b>cores).</b> Using this FTS, we have diamond-turned two-dimensional sinusoidal surfaces in copper and aluminum with 0. 5 degree azimuthal spatial period, 160 micron radial spatial period, and 2 micron peak-to-valley amplitude, at 500 RPM spindle speed. by Xiaodong Lu.

The sample with 5 % MgO addition also exhibited superior super-conducting properties. The Bi- 2212 powder with 5 % nanosize MgO addition was used to fabricate Bi- 2212 tapes through the dip-coating-then- stacking method. The fully processed tapes were investigated via dc electrical resistance measurements, XRD patterns, SEM micrographs, transport critical current density and tensile tests. The tensile tests were conducted at room and cryogenic (77 K) temperatures. Results of tensile tests and Young’s modulus for the tapes showed that the Bi- 2212 tapes with nanosize MgO addition recorded better mechanical prop-erty compared to the non-added samples both at room and cryogenic temperatures. The double- <b>core</b> <b>tape</b> with 5 % MgO addition recorded the highest failure point at 160 MPa. In addition to the strengthening effect that was observed in the nanosize MgO added Bi- 2212 superconduc-tor tapes, the superconducting properties re-mained intact in the tapes...|$|R
40|$|In fall 2003 T. Hughes of MRC used a full EM {{simulation}} code (LSP) to {{show that}} the electric field stress distribution near the outer radius of the longitudinal gaps between the four Metglas induction cores is very nonuniform in the original design of the DARHT- 2 accelerator cells. In this note we derive a simple model of the electric field distribution in the induction core region to provide physical insights into this result. The starting point in formulating our model is to recognize that the electromagnetic fields in the induction core region of the DARHT- 2 accelerator cells should be accurately represented within a quasi-static approximation because the timescale for the fields to change is much longer than the EM wave propagation time. The difficulty one faces {{is the fact that the}} electric field is a mixture of both a ''quasi-magnetostatic field'' (having a nonzero curl, with Bdot the source) and a ''quasi-electrostatic field'' (the source being electric charges on the various metal surfaces). We first discuss the EM field structure on the ''micro-scale'' of individual tape windings in Section 2. The insights from that discussion are then used to formulate a ''macroscopic'' description of the fields inside an ''equivalent homogeneous <b>tape</b> wound <b>core</b> region'' in Section 3. This formulation explicitly separates the nonlinear core magnetics from the quasi-electrostatic components of the electric field. In Section 4 a physical interpretation of the radial dependence of the electrostatic component of the electric field derived from this model is presented in terms of distributed capacitances, and the voltage distribution from gap to gap is related to various ''equivalent'' lumped capacitances. Analytic solutions of several simple multi-core cases are presented in Sections 5 and 6 to help provide physical insight into the effect of various proposed changes in the geometrical parameters of the DARHT- 2 accelerator cell. Our results show that over most of the gap between adjacent cores there will be near equipartition of the voltages but there will be a region near the outer radius of each core where the voltages (and more importantly, the electric field stress) can deviate significantly from equipartition. In Section 7 we apply our results to some multicore measurements form the LBNL test stand and make some predictions for the general DARHT- 2 accelerator cell configuration...|$|R
