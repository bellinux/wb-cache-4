60|$|In {{a humble}} abode near the said docks a bulky sea-captain lay {{stretched}} in his hammock, growling. The prevailing odours of the neighbourhood were <b>tar,</b> <b>oil,</b> fish, and marine-stores. The sea-captain's room partook largely {{of the same}} odours, and was crowded with more than an average share of the stores. It was a particularly small room, with charts, telescopes, speaking-trumpets, log-lines, sextants, portraits of ships, sou'-westers, oil-cloth coats and leggings on the walls; model ships suspended from the beams overhead; sea-boots, coils of rope, kegs, and handspikes on the floor; and great shells, earthenware ornaments, pagodas, and Chinese idols on the mantel-piece. In one corner stood a child's crib. The hammock swung across the room like a heavy cloud about to descend and overwhelm the whole. This simile was further {{borne out by the}} dense volumes of tobacco smoke in which the captain enveloped himself, and through which his red visage loomed {{over the edge of the}} hammock like a lurid setting sun.|$|E

50|$|Tar {{was used}} as seal for roofing {{shingles}} and tar paper and to seal the hulls of ships and boats. For millennia, wood tar was used to waterproof sails and boats, but today, sails made from inherently waterproof synthetic substances have reduced the demand for tar. Wood tar is still used to seal traditional wooden boats and the roofs of historical shingle-roofed churches, as well as painting exterior walls of log buildings. Tar is also a general disinfectant. Pine <b>tar</b> <b>oil,</b> or wood <b>tar</b> <b>oil,</b> is a pure natural product used for the surface treatment of wooden shingle roofs, boats, buckets, and tubs and in the medicine, soap, and rubber industries. Pine tar has good penetration on the rough wood.

The chemical constitution as regards distillation range, acid content, {{and types of}} washes are briefly discussed.

50|$|The term {{creosote}} has a {{broad range}} of definitions depending on the origin of the coal <b>tar</b> <b>oil</b> and end use of the material.With respect to wood preservatives, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) considers the term creosote to mean that it is a pesticide for use as a wood preservative meeting the American Wood Protection Association (AWPA) Standards P1/P13 and P2. The AWPA Standards require that creosote “shall be a pure coal tar product derived entirely from tar produced by the carbonization of bituminous coal.”Currently, all creosote treated wood products—foundation and marine piling, lumber, posts, railroad crossties, timbers, and utility poles—are manufactured using this type of wood preservative. The manufacturing process can only be a pressure process under the supervision of a licensed applicator certified by the State Departments of Agriculture. No brush-on, spray, or non-pressure uses of creosote are allowed, as specified by the EPA approved label for the use of creosote.The use of creosote according to the AWPA Standards does not allow for mixing with other types of “creosote type” materials—such as lignite-tar creosote, oil-tar creosote, peat-tar creosote, water-gas-tar creosote, or wood-tar creosote. The AWPA Standard P3 does however, allow blending of a high-boiling petroleum oil meeting the AWPA Standard P4.|$|E
