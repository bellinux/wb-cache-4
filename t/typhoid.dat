5|$|Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales (19 February 1594– 6 November 1612). Died, {{probably}} of <b>typhoid</b> fever, aged 18.|$|E
5|$|On 9 December, one of Albert's doctors, William Jenner, {{diagnosed}} <b>typhoid</b> fever. Albert died at 10:50p.m. on 14 December 1861 in the Blue Room at Windsor Castle, in {{the presence}} of the Queen and five of their nine children. The contemporary diagnosis was <b>typhoid</b> fever, but modern writers have pointed out that Albert was ill for at least two years before his death, which may indicate that a chronic disease, such as Crohn's disease, renal failure, or abdominal cancer, was the cause of death.|$|E
5|$|On September 27, 1891, at 19:00, Clayton's {{wife died}} at their {{residence}} in Keyser {{as a result}} of contracting <b>typhoid</b> fever. She was buried at Indian Mound Cemetery in Romney.|$|E
5|$|Several {{natural causes}} (diseases) have been suggested, {{including}} malaria and <b>typhoid</b> fever. A 1998 {{article in the}} New England Journal of Medicine attributed his death to <b>typhoid</b> fever complicated by bowel perforation and ascending paralysis. Another recent analysis suggested pyogenic (infectious) spondylitis or meningitis. Other illnesses fit the symptoms, including acute pancreatitis and West Nile virus. Natural-cause theories also tend to emphasize that Alexander's health {{may have been in}} general decline after years of heavy drinking and severe wounds. The anguish that Alexander felt after Hephaestion's death may also have contributed to his declining health.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from those}} who died of battle wounds, three {{officers}} and 12 enlisted men succumbed to disease, including its second colonel, Noah Farnham, who {{died as a result}} of his wounds sustained at Bull Run and a bout of <b>typhoid.</b> A total of 66 men of the 11th New York Infantry Regiment died in the course of the war.|$|E
5|$|During the Civil War, the {{infrastructure}} of St. Louis suffered from neglect; another cholera epidemic struck in 1866, and <b>typhoid</b> fever raged. In response, St. Louis improved its water system and established a Board of Health to regulate polluting industries. St. Louis's park system was expanded during the 1860s and 1870s, {{with the creation of}} Tower Grove Park and Forest Park.|$|E
5|$|During the {{transition}} period {{he worked as a}} pathology registrar at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research and also prepared for his Doctor of Medicine examinations, late in 1923. In 1923 he took up the post of senior resident pathologist at the Melbourne Hospital; the laboratories were a part of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute. He conducted research into the agglutinin reactions in <b>typhoid</b> fever, leading to his first scientific publications. He decided to work full-time on the antibody response in <b>typhoid,</b> even though he was technically supposed to pursuing pathology as part of his obligations to the hospital. Burnet came first in the Doctor of Medicine exams by a long distance, and his score was excluded from the scaling process so that the other students would not fail for being so far behind.|$|E
5|$|In 1882 tragedy {{struck the}} Smuts family. Their eldest son, Michiel, {{suddenly}} succumbed to <b>typhoid</b> while attending school at Riebeek West. This time of family grief and upheaval {{had a direct}} effect upon Jan; now, as the eldest son, the weight of family expectation fell squarely upon his shoulders.|$|E
5|$|In the aftermath, {{air rescue}} {{operations}} were conducted, but {{the destruction of}} roads in the area hindered convoys carrying aid. Planes also made supply drops, but rescue operations were hindered by broken roads and rails. Survivors were vaccinated against <b>typhoid</b> and tetanus. Part of Manzanillo was placed under quarantine.|$|E
5|$|Singh {{developed}} <b>typhoid</b> at age 10. Her mother, who {{was attending}} her, contracted the disease, {{fell into a}} coma, and died on 17September 1887. On 31May 1889 her father married Ada Wetherill, a chambermaid, with whom he would have two daughters.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} Cyclone Gene were {{compounded}} by continuous heavy rainfall and subsequent floods {{in most parts}} of Viti Levu. As a result, there was significant disruption to water supplies, with several sources becoming contaminated and destroyed as a result there were several cases of <b>Typhoid</b> reported in Fiji with at least 1 person dying from <b>typhoid.</b> There was also seven other deaths from cyclone Gene, five of these were directly related whilst two people were also killed as an indirect result of Cyclone Gene from house fires while using candles to light their homes when the power went out. Within their end of season report RSMC Nadi reported that the total cost of Cyclone Gene was F$51 million(2008), ($35 million 2008USD).|$|E
5|$|Abraham Lincoln is not {{the only}} Lincoln ghost {{witnesses}} claim to have seen in the White House. Willie Lincoln, Abraham Lincoln's 11-year-old son, died in the White House of <b>typhoid</b> on February 20, 1862. Willie Lincoln's ghost was first seen in the White House by staff members of the Grant administration in the 1870s, but has appeared as recently as the 1960s (President Lyndon B. Johnson's college-age daughter, Lynda Bird Johnson Robb, saw the ghost and claims to have talked to him).|$|E
5|$|According to some sources, Lincoln's first romantic {{interest}} was Ann Rutledge, {{whom he met}} when he first moved to New Salem; these sources indicate that by 1835, {{they were in a}} relationship but not formally engaged. She {{died at the age of}} 22 on August 25, 1835, most likely of <b>typhoid</b> fever. In the early 1830s, he met Mary Owens from Kentucky when she was visiting her sister.|$|E
5|$|After the storm, New Jersey {{state health}} {{department}} investigators from Trenton were dispatched to study the possibility {{for an increase in}} <b>typhoid</b> fever in flooded areas. In Woodbury, where the city pumping station was flooded, water was rationed. Gas service was also limited in Woodbury, Pedricktown, Penns Grove. As a result of a gas plant becoming inundated in Glassboro, electricity was rationalized in Hammonton, forcing residents to eat uncooked food. Police were forced to transport residents of Mount Holly to work via boat due to the high floodwaters.|$|E
5|$|Following the storm, {{the town}} of Port Lavaca {{requested}} aid from the United States Navy and Fourth United States Army. Later, cots and blankets were sent by helicopters and trucks. Three schools were opened as shelters for flood refugees in Port Lavaca. The Texas Department of State Health Services sent water and sanitation teams to the areas affected by the storm, as well as 3,000shots of <b>typhoid</b> vaccine. In addition, Calhoun County was declared a disaster area. Overall, the storm caused $3.6million and 15fatalities {{in the state of}} Texas.|$|E
5|$|Hesketh-Prichard {{was born}} {{an only child}} on 17 November 1876 in Jhansi, {{in the state of}} Uttar Pradesh, India. His father Hesketh Brodrick Prichard, an officer in the King's Own Scottish Borderers, died from <b>typhoid</b> six weeks before he was born, leading him to be raised alone by his mother, Kate O'Brien Ryall Prichard. She herself had come from a {{military}} family, her father being Major-General Browne William Ryall.|$|E
5|$|In November 1861, the self-appointed {{members of}} the Confederate state {{sovereignty}} convention in Russellville, Kentucky appointed Hawes state auditor of the Commonwealth's Confederate government, but he declined {{in order to continue}} his military service. However, he wrote President Davis on January 25, 1862 to inform him that he was traveling to Bowling Green, Kentucky at Confederate Governor George W. Johnson's request in order to assist Johnson in administering the state government. He resigned his military commission two days later, but his departure for Bowling Green was delayed when he was stricken with <b>typhoid</b> fever.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th century it was {{successively}} {{the home}} of the notable scientists Dr William Budd FRS, who discovered the origins of <b>typhoid,</b> and Professor John Beddoe FRS, the social anthropologist who wrote The Races of Man. In the 1890s the house became a school preparing young gentlemen for colonial civil service examinations and for the army and navy. The school closed in 1915 and the house became {{the home of}} The Red Maids' School, which was evacuated from Westbury while their buildings were used as a Red Cross Hospital during the Great War.|$|E
5|$|On June 24, 1898, Morrow enlisted as {{a private}} in the 4th Kentucky Infantry Regiment for service in the Spanish–American War. He was first {{stationed}} at Lexington, Kentucky, and later trained at Anniston, Alabama. Due to a bout with <b>typhoid</b> fever, he never saw active duty, and mustered out as a second lieutenant on February 12, 1899. In 1900, he matriculated for the fall semester at the University of Cincinnati Law School. He graduated with a Bachelor of Laws degree in 1902.|$|E
5|$|Prior to abandoning Bowling Green, Governor Johnson {{requested}} that Richard Hawes {{come to the}} city and help with the administration of the government, but Hawes was delayed due to a bout with <b>typhoid</b> fever. Following Johnson's death, the provisional government elected Hawes, who was still recovering from his illness, as governor. Following his recovery, Hawes joined the government in Corinth, Mississippi, and took the oath of office on May 31.|$|E
5|$|Some American {{settlers}} {{claimed that}} smallpox could be prevented through the ingestion of lettuce, and an Iranian belief suggested {{consumption of the}} seeds when afflicted with <b>typhoid.</b> Folk medicine has also claimed it {{as a treatment for}} pain, rheumatism, tension and nervousness, coughs and insanity; scientific evidence of these benefits in humans has not been found. The religious ties of lettuce continue into the present day among the Yazidi people of northern Iraq, who have a religious prohibition against eating the plant.|$|E
5|$|The {{combined}} {{effects of}} Debby and Hurricane Kristy, which impacted Mexico's Pacific coast {{around the same}} time, rendered about 50,000people homeless. Emergency crews worked to provide shelter for those left homeless. Relief supplies were delivered by boat to towns isolated by floodwaters. Local health officials in Mexico City warned {{of the possibility of}} outbreaks of hepatitis, <b>typhoid,</b> and other waterborne diseases. In response to the threat, homes located in the northern portions of the city near the Río de los Remedios were fumigated.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} {{should be}} considered in anyone who develops a fever within two weeks of being in the tropics or subtropics. It can be difficult to distinguish dengue fever and chikungunya, a similar viral infection that shares many symptoms and occurs in similar parts of the world to dengue. Often, investigations are performed to exclude other conditions that cause similar symptoms, such as malaria, leptospirosis, viral hemorrhagic fever, <b>typhoid</b> fever, meningococcal disease, measles, and influenza. Zika fever also has similar symptoms as dengue.|$|E
5|$|The {{hospital}} {{cared for}} more than 4,500 patients (most of them Jews) from 20 countries, suffering from starvation, alimentary dystrophy, gangrene, necrosis, internal haemorrhaging, and <b>typhoid</b> fever. At least 500 patients died. Assistance was provided by volunteers from Oświęcim and Brzeszcze, who donated money and food, cleaned hospital rooms, delivered water, washed patients, cooked meals, buried the dead, and transported the sick in horse-drawn carts between locations. Securing enough food for thousands of former prisoners was a constant challenge. The hospital director personally went from village to village to collect milk.|$|E
5|$|The parlous {{state of}} the children's health is {{apparent}} when at one point, 400 were suffering from dysentery, 300 had measles, 200 had <b>typhoid,</b> 200 had diphtheria and another 100 had mumps. Many children were also suffering from scurvy due to the poor diet. Monthly mortality figures were: July– 153; August– 216; September– 67; and October– 8. To these can be added five children who died in hospital in Zagreb, {{for a total of}} 449.|$|E
5|$|The two {{return to}} the museum where Burton makes a ridiculous attempt to seduce Zero to ensure his participation. Rejecting his advances, Zero {{examines}} {{some of the other}} exhibits (including displays on <b>Typhoid</b> Mary and the Tuskegee syphilis study) before finding an African green monkey, another suspected early AIDS vector. The monkey (Marla Lukofsky) angrily denounces Zero for scapegoating her just as he has been scapegoated. Zero turns to Burton and they make love.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{his time}} in the General Assembly, Breckinridge had battled with <b>typhoid</b> fever. In an 1828 letter to his wife, who was visiting {{relatives}} in Virginia, he recounted that he had been bedridden and near death for two months. Finally, in February 1829, the illness subsided. Only then could he be told about the death of his daughter, Louisiana, which had occurred a month earlier. The illness, combined with the news of the death of his daughter, caused Breckinridge to turn to religion.|$|E
5|$|A newborn in Uttar Pradesh is {{expected}} to live four years fewer than in the neighboring state of Bihar, five years fewer than in Haryana and seven years fewer than in Himachal Pradesh. Uttar Pradesh contributed to the largest share of almost all communicable and noncommunicable disease deaths, including 48 per cent of all <b>typhoid</b> deaths (2014); 17 per cent of cancer deaths and 18 per cent of tuberculosis deaths (2015). After Assam, Uttar Pradesh has India’s second-highest maternal mortality rate, 285 maternal deaths for every 100,000 live births (2013), with 62 percent of pregnant women unable to access minimum ante-natal care.|$|E
5|$|As a young officer, Rowell {{served at}} Gallipoli but was invalided back to Australia with <b>typhoid</b> fever in January 1916. The {{end of the}} war found Rowell junior in rank to his contemporaries with more {{distinguished}} war records, but he managed to catch up in the post-war period. Rowell spent five years with the British Army or at British staff colleges, establishing valuable contacts with his British counterparts. In 1939 he was appointed {{chief of staff of the}} 6th Division and later I Corps, serving in that capacity in the Battle of Greece and the Syria-Lebanon campaign. In 1942 he commanded I Corps in the Kokoda Track campaign but was sacked. His subsequent rise to become Chief of the General Staff demonstrated that the circumstances of his dismissal in 1942 were indeed extraordinary.|$|E
5|$|By November, Victoria and Albert had {{returned}} to Windsor, and the Prince of Wales {{had returned}} to Cambridge, {{where he was a}} student. Two of Albert's cousins, King Pedro V and Prince Ferdinand of Portugal, died of <b>typhoid</b> fever. On top of this news, Albert was informed that gossip was spreading in gentlemen's clubs and the foreign press that the Prince of Wales was still involved with Nellie Clifden. Albert and Victoria were horrified by their son's indiscretion, and feared blackmail, scandal or pregnancy. Although Albert was ill and at a low ebb, he travelled to Cambridge to see the Prince of Wales on 25 November to discuss his son's indiscreet affair. In his final weeks Albert suffered from pains in his back and legs.|$|E
5|$|Crosby {{was invited}} in 1892 {{to serve as}} {{head coach of the}} United States Naval Academy {{football}} program. He accepted the position, and, using unusually rigorous practicing strategies, led the team to a 5–2 record, culminating in an upset victory over rival Army in the Army–Navy Game. He received commendation for the victory, including a gift of a personalized trophy. Following the season's conclusion, Crosby returned to New York to continue his studies, but he was hospitalized after an illness he contracted while coaching worsened shortly after his arrival. He died from <b>typhoid</b> fever in late December, at the age of 24.|$|E
5|$|Daughter Abigail ("Nabby") {{was married}} to Representative William Stephens Smith, but she {{returned}} to her parents' home after the failure of the marriage; she died of breast cancer in 1813. His wife Abigail died of <b>typhoid</b> on October 28, 1818. His son Thomas and wife Ann, along with seven children, lived with Adams to the end of Adams' life, as well as Louisa Smith (Abigail's niece by her brother William). Sixteen months before John Adams' death, John Quincy became the sixth president of the United States in 1825, the only son to succeed his father as President until George W. Bush in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, Charles {{apparently}} conquered {{his physical}} infirmity, {{which might have}} been caused by rickets. He became an adept horseman and marksman, and took up fencing. Even so, his public profile remained low in contrast to that of his physically stronger and taller elder brother, Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, whom Charles adored and attempted to emulate. However, in early November 1612, Henry {{died at the age of}} 18 of what is suspected to have been <b>typhoid</b> (or possibly porphyria). Charles, who turned 12 two weeks later, became heir apparent. As the eldest surviving son of the sovereign, Charles automatically gained several titles (including Duke of Cornwall and Duke of Rothesay). Four years later, in November 1616, he was created Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester.|$|E
5|$|Goodman {{was born}} and raised in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where his father, George, was a printer and real estate agent. His mother, Ella, died of <b>typhoid</b> fever in early 1895 when Goodman was just three years old. He {{attended}} Central High School, graduating in 1909. He enjoyed writing and began keeping a detailed journal of daily activities during his senior year of high school, expressing his aspirations for the future along with occasional doubts. With several classmates, he began a literary club and published a newsletter, The Inkstand. He also showed interest in music, playing the piano and violin, and composed a song for his high school senior class. When it was not selected by the class officers, he wrote in his journal of his disappointment.|$|E
5|$|If {{bacteria}} form a parasitic {{association with}} other organisms, they are classed as pathogens. Pathogenic bacteria {{are a major}} cause of human death and disease and cause infections such as tetanus, <b>typhoid</b> fever, diphtheria, syphilis, cholera, foodborne illness, leprosy and tuberculosis. A pathogenic cause for a known medical disease may only be discovered many years after, {{as was the case with}} Helicobacter pylori and peptic ulcer disease. Bacterial diseases are also important in agriculture, with bacteria causing leaf spot, fire blight and wilts in plants, as well as Johne's disease, mastitis, salmonella and anthrax in farm animals.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} the typhoon's tremendous impact, the Japanese military was deployed to Osaka before nightfall on September21 and water was being trucked in. Officials in Osaka Prefecture released an immediate ¥10million in relief funds. Baron Kischizaemon Sumitomo donated ¥1million (US$300,000) to relief funds, the largest such private donation in the nation's {{history at the}} time. The Cabinet of Japan held a special meeting to discuss emergency operations. Three destroyers from the Kure Naval District, loaded with medical equipment and other essentials, were deployed to assist in relief work. Outbreaks of <b>typhoid</b> fever, dysentery, and scarlet fever plagued survivors in the storm's aftermath.|$|E
