2500|$|In 1993, millionaire Francesco Tognon bought everything, thus {{saving the}} company and setting up what looked like the first serious attempt in a decade to {{relaunch}} the brand. [...] Over the next five years, they launched a small selection of new sports models based on a thorough redo of the [...] DOHC 650cc parallel-twin derived from the old Alpino, upped to 668cc and clothed in contemporary superbike livery. [...] These bikes were outfitted with Weber-Marelli electronic fuel injection, Brembo Gold Line brakes, fully adjustable Paioli suspension (White Power on some models), hollow spoke Marchesini wheels and a modern beam or <b>trellis</b> <b>frame.</b> Within {{a year and a}} half, a larger, water cooled 750 appeared with a new engine in an aluminum beam chassis developed by frame specialist Nico Bakker.|$|E

5000|$|The HP2 Enduro is a {{motorcycle}} manufactured by BMW Motorrad from 2005 to 2008. It is a [...] "High Performance" [...] (HP) dirt bike {{based on the}} engine and electronics from the R1200GS adventure-touring model. The use of a <b>trellis</b> tube <b>frame,</b> a conventional fork rather than Telelever, and other modifications, make it 53 lb lighter than the corresponding R1200GS.|$|R
5000|$|The word {{espalier}} is French, and {{it comes}} from the Italian spalliera, meaning “something to rest the shoulder (spalla) against.” [...] During the 17th Century, the word initially referred only to the actual <b>trellis</b> or <b>frame</b> on which such a plant was trained to grow, but over time it has come to be used to describe both the practice and the plants themselves.|$|R
50|$|A <b>trellis</b> <b>frame</b> {{connects the}} {{steering}} {{head to the}} swingarm pivot as directly as possible using metal tube arranged in triangulated reinforcement. Using lattice girder principles, a <b>trellis</b> <b>frame</b> is typically constructed of round or oval section metal tubular segments that are welded or brazed together. A well-designed <b>trellis</b> <b>frame</b> should provide a strong, lightweight structure that simplifies placement of engine & components, and gives good access for maintenance. Although construction of a <b>trellis</b> <b>frame</b> needs a more complicated process than, say, an alloy beam frame, it requires only a simple jig and a competent welder. No heavy capital outlay is required, so a <b>trellis</b> <b>frame</b> is ideal for a model that may be made in relatively small numbers. For this reason, the <b>trellis</b> <b>frame</b> has found favour with European manufacturers, and Ducati in particular.|$|E

50|$|The {{new entry}} to the {{facility}} exists at its southern end with public parking and public transportation drop off areas. A high <b>trellis</b> <b>frames</b> the entrance on a boardwalk that runs {{the length of the}} site, parallel to the water, at the line of the mean high tide when the estate was developed. After the Santa Monica Pier was built, the mean high tide line has shifted to enlarge the beach by four hundred feet. This boardwalk is an index of the gradual changes in nature and is a link to each of the four main areas of the site: the Entrance, the Pool and Pool House, the Event House, and the Guest House. The entrance is flanked by the pre-existing “Back on the Beach” restaurant and public restrooms and showers {{on one side and the}} reception, ticketing and lifeguard building on the other. A shaded children’s play area and restaurant take-out window are just past the entrance on the beach.|$|R
5000|$|A report {{written in}} 1869 by Adams, Secretary to the British Legation in Yedo, {{describes}} [...] "a quantity of vines, trained on horizontal <b>trellis</b> <b>frames,</b> which rested on poles at {{a height of}} 7 or 8 feet from the ground" [...] {{in the region of}} Koshu, Yamanashi. It was not until 1873 however, after detailed reports on European wine culture were made available by returning members of the Iwakura Mission, that more focused attempts were made to promote domestic wine production. The first attempt to produce wine locally, using mainly sake brewing equipment, was undertaken by Hironori Yamada and Norihisa Takuma in Kofu, Yamanashi, in 1875. In 1877, the newly formed Iwaimura Winery in Katsunuma, Yamanashi dispatched Masanari Takano and Ryuken Tsuchiya to Bordeaux to learn viticulture and wine production techniques. [...] The cultivation of European grape varieties formed the core of early Japanese attempts, however the project was all but destroyed in 1884 by an outbreak of Phylloxera that arrived via imported root stock.|$|R
50|$|In 2017 Sinnis Motorcycles have {{released}} their EFI, Euro 4 models {{to the market}} which includes the Sinnis Terrain 125cc Adventure bike, and SMR Apache with new <b>trellis</b> design <b>frame</b> etc. The SMR was co developed by Michael Garrod at Sinnis motorcycles and Jinan Qingqi in China. It still features the Original engine (Suzuki) from the earlier Apache, {{with the addition of}} fuel injection, and a newly designed frame, fuel tank, clock, seat and features twin underseat exhaust. Garrod also designed the Sinnis Encanto 50cc Scooter for Sinnis and the Terrain. Sinnis won the coveted Motorcycle Dealer of the Year Merit Award in 2017, at the British Dealer News Trade show. Voted for by over 1000 UK motorcycle dealers.|$|R

50|$|The Sport1000 {{took its}} {{inspiration}} from the 1973 Ducati 750 Sport and related 750 Imola Desmo, and {{had the look of}} a classic lightweight single-seat cafe racer. It used a two valve 1000DS motor with a 1425 mm wheelbase, <b>trellis</b> tube <b>frame.</b> The suspension used three way adjustable single Sachs rear shocks, and non-adjustable 43 mm Marzocchi front forks. The wheels were wire spoke large section alloy rims with tubed Pirelli Phantom tyres. Borrani were approached to supply the rims, but could not supply the volume, so Excel rims were used. The Sport1000 was available in black with a white stripe, red with a white strip, or amber with a black stripe.|$|R
40|$|Yurt {{is a word}} of Russian origin {{describing}} a circular <b>trellis</b> walled <b>framed</b> tent. The roof supported by a conical or domed frame consisting {{of a number of}} ribs radiating from a central wooden wheel {{to the top of the}} wall trellis. The yurt is traditionally covered with felt, made by beating and rolling wet sheep fleece. There are three main types of yurt: The Kirgiz yurt with bent-wood roof poles and crown and a domed overall shape. Used by the Turkish speaking kirgiz, Kazak, Uzbek, and Turkmen people. The two tiered yurt with a pointed roof and two layers of wall section placed one on top of the other. Used by the Uzbek, and Arab peoples of Afghanistan. The Mongol or Kalmuk ger with straight roof poles, a heavy timber crown, often supported by two upright poles, and fitted with a wooden door. It is this type of yurt that will be described in this book. The Mongolian Ger ({{describing a}} Mongolian's tent as a yurt may offend his/her national pride) is a versatile dwelling with a proven pedigree, being home to the nomads of central Asia for many centuries. The oldest complete yurt yet discovered was in a 13 th century grave in the Khentei Mountains of Mongolia. Discoveries at Pazaryk, Southern Siberia indicate that the technology to make yurts was in use during the 4 th century BC. The BBC Horizon series "Ice Mummies " suggest...|$|R
5000|$|The 650R and its naked sibling, the ER-6n, were {{introduced}} in 2006. The naked ER-6n was not sold in North America until the 2009 model year. The motorcycle fits above the Ninja 250R and Ninja 500R models, which already existed in Kawasaki's sportbike lineup, which includes the Ninja ZX models. For 2009, Kawasaki released an updated Ninja 650R which includes new bodywork, mirrors, gauges, lighting, and a new tune on the same [...] engine. Along with chassis and minor tweaks, an all-new bodywork design {{was introduced to the}} 2012 Ninja 650 and ER-6n along with a new 2-piece seat assembly, 20mm wider handlebars, and a new tachometer above an LCD display that shows speed, trip meters, fuel consumption and etc. The new Ninja 650 also comes equipped with an ECO Mode indicator when the bike is consuming low amounts of fuel. For 2017 Kawasaki has updated the Ninja 650 with a new <b>frame</b> <b>trellis</b> style adding to the new lighter weight and better handling. With new sharper styling it has done away with the distinctive side mount rear shock for a more conventional one, it has also added a slipper clutch.|$|R

5000|$|The Ducati Monster (called Il Mostro in Italian) is {{a muscle}} bike {{designed}} by Miguel Angel Galluzzi and produced by Ducati in Bologna, Italy since 1993. It is a naked bike, {{characterized by an}} exposed engine and frame. [...] The purposeful and considered use of the <b>trellis</b> <b>frame</b> in the Ducati Monster {{is an integral part}} of the motorcycle's design allowing for both aesthetic appeal and for structural efficiency.In 2005, Monster sales accounted for over half of Ducati's worldwide sales. Ducati motorcycles use almost exclusively 90° V-twin engines, which they call L-twins, with desmodromic valves, and tubular steel <b>trellis</b> <b>frame,</b> designed by Fabio Taglioni (1920-2001).|$|E
50|$|Some motorcycles, {{such as the}} Yamaha TRX850, have hybrid frames {{that employ}} alloy {{castings}} at the swingarm pivot area. Another variation is to suspend the engine from a <b>trellis</b> <b>frame,</b> but have the swingarm pivot cast into {{the rear of the}} engine.|$|E
5000|$|The Ducati Panigale is {{a family}} of sport {{motorcycles}} manufactured by Ducati since 2011. The [...] "Panigale" [...] is named after the small manufacturing town of Borgo Panigale. All motorcycles of this series use monocoque frame (the engine is a stressed member, replacing Ducati's conventional <b>trellis</b> <b>frame).</b>|$|E
5000|$|The TRX was {{designed}} {{to compete in the}} market with the Ducati 900SS V-twin, whose tubular <b>trellis</b> <b>frame</b> it mimicked. [...] Although developed cheaply from Yamaha's [...] "parts bin", using a TDM850 engine, the TRX performs well and has [...] "a coherent identity of its own".|$|E
50|$|Also called Beam or twin spar, two beams {{wrap around}} {{the engine to}} join the {{steering}} head and swing arm in the shortest distance possible for better rigidity. Beams are usually made of pressed metal (steel/aluminium). The <b>trellis</b> <b>frame</b> employs the same concept but uses welded members to form a trellis instead of pressed metal.|$|E
50|$|The 1987 - 1988 Ducati 851 Strada {{used the}} {{signature}} steel tube <b>trellis</b> <b>frame,</b> adorned with Marvic wheels, Brembo brakes and Marzocchi suspension. That first release was criticised for its handling, so {{the front wheel}} was enlarged from a 16-inch to a 17-inch (41 to 43 cm) wheel. In addition, upgraded suspension components were fitted.|$|E
5000|$|The Ducati 916 is a fully faired sport bike made by Ducati from 1994 to 1998. Featuring a [...] fuel injected, 4-valve, desmo, liquid-cooled, 90° V-twin {{engine in}} a <b>trellis</b> <b>frame</b> with a {{single-sided}} swingarm and USD forks, the 916 has consistently been declared {{to be one}} of the most beautiful motorcycles ever produced.|$|E
50|$|Work {{began on}} the first single track rail bridge in May 1954. This is a triple span post-free <b>trellis</b> <b>frame</b> steel bridge {{supported}} by a continuous beam. The bridge was opened on 12 August 1956. The frontier was set at {{the midpoint of the}} bridge: Germany owns the eastern half and France owns the western half.|$|E
50|$|A {{year and}} a half until their MotoGP debut, KTM tested their V4 engine for the first time, it was opted for the engine to be a V4 {{configuration}} (also known as a screamer engine) which was designed around the steel <b>trellis</b> <b>frame</b> chassis that is iconic to KTM's brand and the only team to use this type of chassis.|$|E
50|$|Developed in {{cooperation}} with Ducati Corse, the 848 <b>trellis</b> <b>frame</b> uses a simplified tube layout from the Ducati 749 featuring main section tubes that are enlarged in diameter from 28 mm to 34 mm, while being reduced in thickness from 2 mm to 1.5 mm. The result is a 14% increase in rigidity and a weight savings of 1.5 kg, helping the 848 weigh 44 lb less than the 749.|$|E
50|$|The 916 was {{a smaller}} {{motorcycle}} than the 888, with a chrome-moly <b>trellis</b> <b>frame</b> which was {{shared with the}} Ducati 748 in 1995 and beyond. This was combined with striking new bodywork that featured aggressive lines. In contrast to Japanese inline four-cylinder competitors of the time, its V-twin engine produced less outright power, but a more even torque spread. The 916 model {{was replaced by the}} 996 model in 1999.|$|E
5000|$|The 250 S used a 2250 mm {{wheelbase}} with a [...] "Tuboscocca" [...] tubular <b>trellis</b> <b>frame.</b> Suspension was by double wishbones at the front, {{with double}} longitudinal semi-elliptic springs locating the live axle at the rear. The car had the drum brakes and worm-and-sector steering {{typical of the}} period. The dry-sump 3.0 L (...) engine used three Weber 36DCF carburettors and was mated directly to a five-speed manual transmission.|$|E
50|$|Introduced in 1997, {{the newer}} VTR250 has been {{compared}} to the Ducati Monster in appearance, with a <b>trellis</b> <b>frame,</b> V-twin engine , and initially a similar instrument layout, with no tachometer. The transmission was changed from six-speeds to five. The 2009 model VTR250 saw the first major design changes since the instrument panel update in 2003, which added a tachometer. With a redesigned rear end and midsection, the 2009 model also has electronic fuel injection.|$|E
50|$|In most respects, the MT-07 is a {{conventional}} middleweight roadster. It uses a compact tubular backbone frame, albeit with some echoes of a <b>trellis</b> <b>frame.</b> Its rear monoshock unit is placed horizontally within the subframe {{to give a}} shorter wheelbase, to save weight and to lower the centre of gravity. Front forks are conventional telescopic items, whereas its 3-cylinder sibling, the MT-09, has USD forks. Anti-lock braking is available as an option.|$|E
5000|$|Announced in 1988, the Ducati SuperSport used a Pantah based 904 cc {{air-cooled}} 90° V-twin, two-valve [...] "Desmodue" [...] engine with crankcases {{derived from}} the 851 motor. It was mounted in a tubular <b>trellis</b> <b>frame.</b> The resurrection was due largely to Ducati being bought out by Cagiva and the first reborn SuperSport was released as a 750 Sport. It met with failure due to its 16-inch wheels and a kludgy Weber carburator and cracking swingarms.|$|E
5000|$|The Ducati GT1000 used {{a similar}} steel tubular <b>trellis</b> <b>frame</b> to the Paul Smart and the Sport1000, {{and the same}} Desmodue [...] engine. It was {{designed}} with comfort in mind and intended for sport-touring riders. The frame differed from the Sport1000 in the addition of mounting points for twin shocks and side panels. The GT1000 had touring handlebars, mounted on the same front forks as the Sport has clip-ons: non-adjustable 43 mm Marzocchi upside-down forks.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{concept of}} the bike {{appeared}} in 2005, powered by the Super Duke [...] v-twin. The displacement was increased to [...] for the production version. The bike has a steel <b>trellis</b> <b>frame</b> with a cast aluminium seat subframe. The suspension uses high-end inverted forks and an alloy, double-sided swingarm made by WP, a KTM subsidiary. The bike for 2013 and on comes in a single color, black and white with orange accents.|$|E
