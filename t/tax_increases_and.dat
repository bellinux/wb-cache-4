5|$|The Republican offer {{called for}} an {{approximately}} $35 billion budget and no <b>tax</b> <b>increases,</b> <b>and</b> relied on delaying the payment of some K-12 school aid and issuing bonds against future tobacco revenue to cover the remaining gap. It differed from the previous Republican proposals in several provisions, particularly increasing the K-12 per-student formula by $50 per year to cover additional borrowing costs, adding $10 million to the University of Minnesota budget to equalize Minnesota State Colleges and Universities cuts, and restoring funding to the Department of Human Rights and the Trade Office. Dayton's conditions were that measures on social issues such as abortion be dropped from the budget, 15percent reductions to state employees in all agencies be dropped, and a $500 million infrastructure construction bonding bill.|$|E

He opposed <b>tax</b> <b>increases</b> <b>and</b> the allocation of federal earmarks. He called for massive spending cuts in the federal bureaucracy, specifically the Department of Education and the Veterans Administration, and for reforming eligibility requirements for entitlement programs, including raising age requirements, imposing means tests, and ending federal benefits to illegal immigrants. He opposed U.S. intervention in the Syrian Civil War and the disbursement of foreign aid to countries that deny basic freedoms to their citizens or are guilty of human rights violations. He opposed federal agribusiness subsidies and warantless federal surveillance and called for simplifying the child adoption process. Endorsed by Gun Owners of America, he pledged to resist any restrictions on the types of guns or ammunition that citizens could purchase. A supporter of congressional term limits, Bevin signed a pledge authored by the non-profit U.S. Term Limits stating that, if elected, he would co-sponsor and vote for a bill restricting individuals to three terms in the U.S. House of Representatives and two terms in the U.S. Senate.|$|E

Of principal concern were issues surrounding war financing. Many of President Franklin D.

He proposed to increase spending by $15 million to give incentives for SRI International and Bank of America to keep offices in Virginia. To boost revenue, McDonnell proposed raising $7.2 million by increasing the fines on motorists who exceed the speed limit. He proposed to cut an additional $9.9 million from state funded programs for at-risk and troubled children and proposed cutting $600,000 from state grants to public radio and television stations. McDonnell also issued amendatory vetoes on non-budget legislation. For example, although Virginia has provided free electronic filing of tax returns for years, his veto outsourced electronic filing to firms that charge a fee for that service. McDonnell also amended a bill to prohibit Planned Parenthood from spending funds raised from its affinity license plates on abortions. The Legislature met {{to vote on the}} Governor's amendments on April 21.

25|$|While Su Shi {{concentrated}} {{on making the}} lives of the local people in his charge better, and pursued his poetry which his position allowed time for, Wang Anshi's policies went awry. Were they bad policies, or were they badly implemented, or were climatic changes leading to drought and poor harvests to blame? These are all serious questions, important to historians of the time, and nowhere near to being definitively answered; but, they are rather subject of great scholarly debate. What is certain is that Su Shi was exiled until emperor Shenzong became somewhat disillusioned with Wang Anshi (and the powerful empress dowager had never been much of a fan of his). The Kaifeng merchants were becoming angry at the price inflation of wholesale goods together with additional <b>tax</b> <b>increases</b> <b>and</b> imposition of fees; and in north of the country a major drought followed by horrible famine occurred in 1074, displacing thousands of refugees (Murck, 37-38). In late 1075, this was followed by a spectacular comet, traditionally viewed as a sign of great changes on earth, even the fall of dynasties (Murck, 48) These events helped to lead Wang Anshi into a gentle but real exile, and to lead to the restoration of Su Shi and other banished officials to positions of power and respect, aided by empress dowager Cao. However, this was just the warm-up to a bitter and deadly political struggle between the two factions in the ensuing years: now both groups had had their ranks decimated, and all sorts of charges of criminal impropriety were our would be filed. Ouyang Xiu had even already been charged with incest, and placed in early retirement: the battle lines drawn, and Su Shi would soon be charged with treason to the state.|$|E

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{cost-effectiveness}} of tobacco control policy for different socioeconomic status (SES) groups. We aimed to evaluate SES-specific cost-effectiveness ratios of policies with known favorable effect in low-SES groups: a tobacco <b>tax</b> <b>increase</b> <b>and</b> reimbursement of cessation support. A computer model of the adult population specified by smoking behavior (never/current/former smoker), age, gender, and SES simulated policy scenarios reflecting the implementation of a € 0. 22 tobacco <b>tax</b> <b>increase</b> or full reimbursement of cessation support, which were compared. Relating differences in costs to quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained generated cost-effectiveness ratios for each SES group. In a cohort of 11 million people, the tobacco <b>tax</b> <b>increase</b> resulted in 27, 000 additional quitters after 5 years, who were proportionally divided among the SES groups. Reimbursement led to 59, 000 additional quitters, with relatively more quitters in higher-SES groups. The number of QALYs gained were 3, 400 - 6, 200 among the various SES groups for the <b>tax</b> <b>increase</b> <b>and</b> 6, 300 - 14, 000 for the reimbursement scenario.

Currently authorities capture less than 1% in annual tax revenue on untaxed wealth transferred between EU members. According to the Tax Justice Network, worldwide, a global super-rich elite had between $21 and $32 trillion (up to 26,000bn Euros) hidden in secret tax havens by the end of 2010, resulting in a tax deficit of up to $280bn.|$|E
500|$|The Fasci {{were the}} result of the revolt of the Sicilian peasants against the {{introduction}} of capitalist relationships into the rural economy aggravated by the world depression in agriculture of the 1880s. [...] The agrarian crisis between 1888 and 1892 led to a steep decrease in wheat prices. The island’s main sources of wealth – wine, fruit and sulphur – suffered a heavy blow. The dominant landowning class channeled most of the economic burden on to the peasantry, in the form of higher rents and discriminatory local taxation. As social tension rose, a handful of young and hitherto quite unknown socialist intellectuals – many of them recent graduates of Palermo University – seized their opportunity. The movement grew under the first government of Prime minister Francesco Crispi (1887-1891) and coincided with unpopular <b>tax</b> <b>increases</b> <b>and</b> ratification of a series of laws curtailing personal freedom. The Italian economy had been sliding into a deep recession since the late 1880s. New protective tariffs had been introduced in 1887 on agricultural and industrial goods, followed by a trade war with France, which badly damaged Italian commerce and affecting Italy’s agricultural exports, the only potentially dynamic economic sector of southern Italy. Many farmers suffered severely.|$|E
500|$|As {{negotiations}} went {{on during}} the legislative session, Dayton suggested compromise budget frameworks ultimately reducing his proposed budget to $35.8 billion, but insisted {{that he would go}} no further and that Republicans were not amenable enough to compromise.

They described their budget as a compromise with the DFL after the state's revenue forecast was revised upward, as it called for $34 billion in state spending increased from $32 billion. Dayton claimed that the impasse was the doing of [...] "extreme right-wing" [...] freshman Republican legislators whom he did not talk to, and that he had cordial relationships with Republican leaders.

Republicans, including Koch and other legislative leaders, consistently insisted they would not accept a budget of over $34 billion, citing polls suggesting public opinion was on their side. During the session, the Republican Party held a rally calling for tax cuts at the State Capitol on May 7.
