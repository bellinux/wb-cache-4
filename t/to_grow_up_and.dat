During the interview, Balotelli reiterated his threat to walk off the pitch {{if any of the}} opposition fans racially abused him in any way, and said that he would 'kill' anyone that threw a banana at him. He spoke about his increasing fears that black players would be targeted by racists and that he refused to accept racism in any form, talking of his past experience of racism in football notably during his time playing in Serie A for Inter Milan. During the build-up to the competition Manchester City's manager Roberto Mancini had repeatedly defended Balotelli, but he and footballer Daniele De Rossi believed that Mario would need <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> mature {{if he was going to}} become the centrepiece of future Italian success.|$|E

25|$|Greenville, Mississippi had {{the most}} Sicilian {{immigrants}} out of other cities in the delta. Most immigrants first settled in New Orleans {{and worked in the}} sugar cane and cotton fields. Later on when they arrived in the Delta, they began to settle in towns, which enabled them to open up grocery stores, restaurants, and fruit stands. Because they lived in towns, rather than on farms, they had access to higher quality education, which they took advantage of. Because of these opportunities, young Sicilian immigrants were able <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> established and enter into the workforce much faster than Central Italian immigrants. Sicilians established strong ties with their homeland after coming to America.|$|E

Returning to school, Bannon completed her master's degree at Sacramento State University and her doctorate in linguistics at Stanford University.

500|$|Hader, who had {{previously}} cameoed in Monsters University, was cast to voice Fear, a role that he felt he [...] "weaseled" [...] his way into by being a [...] "huge fan" [...] of Pixar's filmography.

He was invited to play Fear {{by the end of}} his stay there, but was also asked to contact fellow Saturday Night Live (SNL) veteran Amy Poehler, whom the team viewed as perfect for the character of Joy. [...] "They said: 'Would you mind calling Amy? We don't want to call her and have her think we're some weirdo,'" [...] he recalled. He phoned Poehler and explained the story to her, noting that her role would be the driving force in the film. When the story was pitched to Kaling, she broke down in tears, explaining [...] "I just think it's really beautiful that you guys are making a story that tells kids that it's difficult <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> it's OK to be sad about it." ...|$|E

Although Entertainment Weekly writer Clark Collis drew parallels to a serial killer, Kirkman suggested this was an initiative to give more screen time to the character. He avouched that Carl was [...] "one of the most fun characters to tell stories about in this world." [...] He continued: [...] "It's true of the comic and it's true of the show. Over time, we’re {{going to start to}} see more and more of this kid. What's awesome about that is, think about {{what it would be like}} to grow up in this world.

500|$|The {{character}} of Elsa was widely praised by reviewers for her multifaceted, evolving personality. Matt Goldberg of Collider.com commented {{that she was}} [...] "an incredibly sympathetic character" [...] while Deepanjana Pal of First Post (India) praised the decision to rewrite her as a protagonist and said, [...] "Elsa is no evil, frosty vision of twisted and toxic maternity like the original Snow Queen. She's {{a young woman in}} difficult circumstances, frightened, trying to understand her abilities and burdened by expectation and convention. It's easy to sympathise with her and marvel at her ability when she builds her spectacular palace in the mountains. Next to her, Anna is very much a child who needs <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> she does {{in the course of the}} film." [...] Stuff.co.nz's James Croot compared her [...] "humiliation and exile" [...] to that of Simba in The Lion King. Katherine Webb, a reviewer for Wall St. Cheat Sheet, said that the scenes depicting Elsa gaining confidence and individuality delivered [...] "an exciting message to send to young girls looking for a new princess role model". Gary Wright of Rotoscopers state [...] "Her mental anguish and uncontrollable powers define modern feminism.

500|$|A neo {{soul and}} R album, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill {{incorporates}} musical styles such as soul, hip hop, and reggae. Some songs {{are based in}} hip hop soul.

While mostly in English, [...] "Forgive Them Father" [...] and [...] "Lost Ones" [...] both feature singing in patois, which is the common dialect in Jamaica. Although heavily R, the song [...] "Superstar" [...] contains an interpolation of the rock song [...] "Light My Fire" [...] by The Doors. Hill said that she [...] "didn't {{want to come out}} with a [...] type of sound", but create [...] "something that was uniquely and very clearly a Lauryn Hill album." [...] She also said that she did not intend for the album's sound to be commercially appealing: [...] "There's too much pressure to have hits these days. Artists are watching Billboard instead of exploring themselves. Look at someone like Aretha, she didn't hit with her first album, but she was able <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> find herself. I wanted to make honest music.

500|$|Last of the Summer Wine was set and {{filmed in}} and around Holmfirth, West Yorkshire, England, and centred on a trio of old men and their {{youthful}} misadventures; {{the membership of the}} trio changed several times over the years. The original trio consisted of Bill Owen as the mischievous and impulsive Compo Simmonite, Peter Sallis as easy-going everyman Norman Clegg, and Michael Bates as uptight and arrogant Cyril Blamire. When Bates dropped out due to illness in 1976 after two series, the role of the third man of the trio was filled in various years up to the 30th series by the quirky war veteran Walter [...] "Foggy" [...] Dewhurst (Brian Wilde), who had two lengthy stints in the series, the eccentric inventor Seymour Utterthwaite (Michael Aldridge), and former police officer Herbert [...] "Truly of The Yard" [...] Truelove (Frank Thornton). The men never seem <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> they develop a unique perspective on their equally eccentric fellow townspeople through their stunts. Although in its early years the series generally revolved around the exploits of the main trio, with occasional interaction with a few recurring characters, over time the cast grew to include a variety of supporting characters and by later years the series was very much an ensemble piece. Each of these recurring characters contributed their own running jokes and subplots to the show and often becoming reluctantly involved in the schemes of the trio, or on occasion having their own, separate storylines.|$|E

[...] Deepanjana Pal from First Post commented that Anna [...] "is very much a child who needs <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> she does {{in the course of}} the film."

Noah Lee of The Coast News was impressed by the heroine duo Anna and Elsa, and said, [...] "I never lost interest in the drastic measures Anna took or the tribulations Elsa faced." [...] Travis Bean, a reviewer of Community Newspaper Group put emphasis on the lessons that kids could perceive from the film, saying, [...] "Children can also root for Anna to race through the forest and break through Elsa's icy walls and prove that love conquers all fears." [...] Linda Barnard, Toronto Star film critic, described the sisters as [...] "engaging female characters", particularly praised Anna for her funny and iron-willed characteristics. Sabina Ibarra from Geek Exchange commended that the directors had crafted two very real girls [...] "who come into their own and also come together in this amazing tale." ...|$|E
