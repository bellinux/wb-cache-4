He called for stakeholders in the health sector to collaborate enable the ministry achieve Buhari's health agenda. According to The Nation, Adewole said for the apex policy on health to be achieved, we need <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>together</b> <b>and</b> working together means {{we can make a}} huge difference. We have been described as a generation that enjoyed better health when we were young than now and our aim is to bring back the health care system we enjoyed when we were young.|$|E
5|$|Before leaving England in 1189, Richard put the Tower of London in Longchamp's {{hands and}} {{appointed}} him jointly with Hugh de Puiset, the Bishop of Durham, {{to the office}} of Chief Justiciar, at that time not strictly a judicial office. Instead, the justiciar was the person entrusted with much of the king's authority when the king was outside the kingdom, able to act in the king's name. Along with Puiset, the king named Hugh Bardulf, William Briwerre, Geoffrey fitz Peter, and William Marshall as associates in the justiciarship, under Puiset and Longchamp. As Justiciar, Longchamp sent judges throughout the country to visit the shires on judicial visits, even though he had no previous knowledge of the judiciary. Longchamp and Puiset were unable <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>together,</b> <b>and</b> so in March 1190 Richard gave authority north of the River Humber to Hugh, and authority south of the river to Longchamp. Historian's opinions are divided whether Richard explicitly made Longchamp superior to Puiset at this time, or if in theory the two were supposed to co-equal in their respective spheres. By June, Longchamp had eased Puiset out of power and the justiciar's office. He also received a commission as a papal legate from Pope Clement III at this time. Supposedly Richard paid 1,500marks (£1,000) to the papacy to secure the legateship for Longchamp.|$|E

25|$|Rousseau {{believed}} that the theatre took people away from the community, and replaced any patriotic, unifying spirit with artificial emotions. To have a prosperous state, Rousseau believed, people needed <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>together</b> <b>and</b> harmoniously. As {{an alternative to the}} theatre, Rousseau proposed open-air republican festivals, with a rich community atmosphere. One of Rousseau's pivotal points in the Letter is that customs, opinions and priorities which are common and well-accepted among all citizens should be those that make accepting laws in favour of respect, equality and harmony a pleasurable and natural experience. In other words, people have to share the concerns with legislators if a state is to be successful.|$|E

25|$|The 'Man on the throne' in {{the vision}} of Ezekiel descriptively {{represents}} God, who is controlling everything {{that goes on in}} the world, and how all of the archetypes He set up should interact. The 'Man on the throne', however, drives when the four angels connect their wings. This means that God will not be revealed to us by us looking at all four elements (for instance) as separate and independent entities. However, when one looks at the way that earth, wind, fire and water (for instance) which all oppose each other are able <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>together</b> <b>and</b> coexist in complete harmony in the world, this shows that there is really a higher power (God) telling these elements how to act.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the actors}} {{who helped him}} during his acting career, he {{credited}} Robert De Niro, from whom he learned the power of silence and economy of dialog when acting, to portray the deep-driven man. From Dustin Hoffman, with whom he co-starred in Hook, he learned to take on totally different character types, and to transform his characters by extreme preparation. Mike Medavoy, producer of Hook, told its director, Steven Spielberg, that he intentionally teamed up Hoffman and Williams for the film because he knew they wanted <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>together,</b> <b>and</b> that Williams welcomed the opportunity of working with Spielberg. Williams benefited from working with Woody Allen, who directed him and Billy Crystal in Deconstructing Harry (1997), as Allen had knowledge {{of the fact that}} Crystal and Williams had often performed together on stage.|$|E
25|$|The {{prisoners are}} {{assigned}} numbers for easy identification {{and in an}} effort to dehumanize them; Ivan Denisovich's prisoner number is Щ-854. Each day, the squad leader receives their work assignment for that day, and the squad are then fed according to how they perform. Prisoners in each squad are thus forced <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>together</b> <b>and</b> pressure each other to get their task done. If any prisoner is slacking, the whole squad will be punished. Despite this, Solzhenitsyn shows that a surprising loyalty exists among the work gang members, with Shukhov teaming up with other prisoners to steal felt and extra bowls of porridge; even the squad leader defies the authorities by tar-papering over the empty windows at their work site. Indeed, only through such solidarity can the prisoners do anything more than survive from day to day.|$|E

500|$|American carrier air groups, on {{the other}} hand, {{suffered}} minimal personnel losses during the early morning fighter sweep: in the above two task groups, only nine U.S. aircraft were shot down with three pilots subsequently recovered by nearby ships/submarines. These lopsided results were {{in part due to}} a lack of experience among Japanese pilots. IJAAS fighters stationed to the north of the Philippines, for example, were still in training. The bulk of enemy fighter aircraft reported by U.S. aviators were Japanese Army types, primarily the Nakajima Ki-44 (Allied reporting name [...] "Tojo"), Kawasaki Ki-61 [...] "Tony" [...] and Nakajima Ki-43 [...] "Oscar" [...] models. Even though there were some experienced Japanese naval aviators operating at this time, IJNAS Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighter units reconstituted after the Battle of the Philippine Sea were still learning <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>together</b> <b>and</b> did not execute the kind of section or division flying that yielded tactical advantage.|$|E
500|$|Looking {{for a new}} {{headquarters}} Comcast asked Arden Group and Mariner Commercial Properties <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>together</b> <b>and</b> {{combine the}} properties into one building. The two developers briefly held discussions about combining the two sites, but by 2001 no agreement was reached and both developers had decided {{to move on with}} their own towers. As they sought to build competing condominium towers, {{the relationship between the two}} developers soon turned into a feud between the firm's lead partners, Craig Spencer of Arden Group and Tim Mahoney of Mariner Commercial Properties. In 2003 Mahoney received permission from the City Zoning Board of Adjustment to build a 50-story residential tower at the 1441 Chestnut Street site. At the zoning hearing Spencer attempted to block approval by saying the building was too tall and that it would damage his site by blocking views and casting shadows. He also said the tower was [...] "snubbing his nose at the traditional zone of respect around City Hall." [...] Spencer filed a lawsuit to block construction of the building and a Court of Common Pleas ruled that the Zoning Board erred in approving 1441 Chestnut Street. Mariner appealed the ruling.|$|E

500|$|Terry Barrett of Ohio State University calls Children and Television a [...] "serious book", {{something}} that could be read by the general public without compromising the field of education. [...] Barrett also calls the book an informative treatment of an [...] "interesting contemporary educational phenomenon". [...] Joan Tierney of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation calls the book [...] "a well-thought, well-organized historical version" [...] of the early history and development of Sesame Street. [...] She not only considers the book a [...] "how-to" [...] in how to create and produce a children's television show, but also an important exposure to the public the hard work and dedication it required {{to put it on the}} air. [...] For Tierney, the most interesting part of the story Lesser tells in the book is how people with strong and different opinions and temperaments learned <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>together</b> <b>and</b> to give television [...] "a little bit of class". [...] She applauds Lesser for including the CTW's detractors, but believes that he unnecessarily included the more ridiculous criticisms in order to give Sesame Street and the Workshop more credibility. [...] Rose K. Goldsen of Cornell University criticizes Lesser for legitimizing [...] "the strange folk belief that depositing lore in a child's head is the same as educating a child". [...] She criticizes the research Lesser describes in the book, and insists that it should be considered as product-testing rather than educational research.
