Taika Waititi, director of , also stated there had been discussions to resurrect the One-Shots, creating one centered on the characters Korg and Miek from Ragnarok. Feige also noted that the One-Shot films could potentially [...] "morph into extra content that’s created prior to a film’s release instead of for its home entertainment release", noting the successful [...] "Team Thor" [...] mockumentary shorts directed by Waititi, which [...] "were great fun, and are quite doable, and in some parts helped redefine Thor into what he's become in Ragnarok in a fun way.

The Ministry of Community Development, Culture and Gender Affairs {{is using the}} {{occasion}} of International Men's Day to highlight issues affecting and involving men. International Men's Day was observed on Friday and a few activities, such as a health fair, a church service and a panel discussion on general men's issues were organized by the ministry. Sharon Rattan, Acting Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Gender Affairs said the Gender Affairs Department wants to reach out more to men as previously they focused mostly on women issues. Rattan told WINN FM that it was their hope to use the opportunity to gather {{more information about the}} issues affecting men to guide their plan of action in the future. [...] "We are trying to get men together and engage their minds on the issues that affect them so <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> forward and support them," [...] Rattan said, adding that the programs would also cater to young boys.|$|E
2500|$|Drews thinks <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> {{farther and}} ascribe {{the change to}} Pope Gelasius I (492-96).

The second oldest Roman sacramentary known, although it is really later than St. Gregory, {{has been called the}} [...] "Sacramentarium Gelasianum" [...] since the 9th century (Duchesne, Origines, 120). Gennadius I says that he composed a sacramentary (De. vir. ill., c. xciv). Moreover, the Liber Pontificalis refers to his liturgical work (Origines, 122) and the Stowe Missal (7th century) puts {{at the head of the}} Canon the title: [...] "Canon dominicus Papæ Gelasi" [...] (ed. Warren, 234). Baumer has collected all the evidences for Gelasius's authorship of some important sacramentary (Histor. Jahrb., 1893, 244 sqq.). It is known that Gelasius did not compose the text of the Canon. Its component parts have been traced back to a far earlier date. But would not so vital a change in its arrangement best explain the tradition that persistently connects the recent Canon with the name of Gelasius? ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1969 Burton {{enjoyed a}} {{commercial}} blockbuster with Clint Eastwood in the World War II action film Where Eagles Dare; {{he received a}} $1million fee plus {{a share of the}} film's box office gross. According to his daughter Kate Burton, “He did that one for us kids, because we kept asking him, 'Can you do a fun movie <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> see?" [...] Eastwood [...] thought the script [...] "terrible" [...] and was [...] "all exposition and complications". He asked the film's producer Elliott Kastner and its screenwriter Alistair MacLean to be given less dialogue, later remarking [...] "I just stood around firing my machine gun while Burton handled the dialogue." [...] Burton enjoyed working with Eastwood and said of the picture that he [...] "did all the talking and [...] did all the killing". Burton's last film of the decade, Anne of the Thousand Days (1969) for which he was paid $1.25million, was commercially successful but garnered mixed opinions from reviewers. Noted British film critic Tom Milne of Time Out magazine believed that Burton [...] "plays throughout on a monotonous note of bluff ferocity". Conversely, Vincent Canby of The New York Times appreciated Burton's portrayal of the English monarch, noting that he [...] "is in excellent form and voice—funny, loutish and sometimes wise". Anne of the Thousand Days received ten nominations at the 42nd Academy Awards, including one for Burton's performance as Henry VIII of England, which many thought to be largely the result of an expensive advertising campaign by Universal Studios. The same year, Staircase in which he and his [...] "Cleopatra" [...] co-star Rex Harrison appeared as a bickering homosexual couple, received negative reviews and was unsuccessful.|$|E
