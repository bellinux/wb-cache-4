In 2005, however, the Court in Town of Castle Rock v.

Guardianship potestas tended to shift into a guardianship similar to a charge (munus). Imperial policy then tended to harmonize the three types of guardianship following the model of the guardianship by magisterial appointment, in other words the idea was to coerce the guardian and in particular the testamentary guardian into making difficult for him to avoid the burden, accepting it and managing it efficiently. The purpose of this paper is not to analyse Marcus Aurelius’ generalisation (followed through by successive emperors) of the system of excuses, extended it to all types of guardianship, and forcing guardians to accept the office. This contribution rather focuses on the search for the correct balance between the wards’ interests and the guardians’ capacity to carry out his mandate effectively and efficiently. This is what we can deduct from a study of the rich casuistic dealing with the excuse grounds and from the shift of guardianship towards the category of civilian charges...|$|E

40|$|Este estudo apresenta a análise do Programa de Proteção a Vítimas e Testemunhas Ameaçadas - Provita -, que surge, em 1996, a partir de uma iniciativa da sociedade civil em parceria com o Estado. Em decorrência desse processo, em 13 de julho de 1999, é promulgada a Lei Federal nº 9. 807, que estabelece normas para a organização e manutenção deste Programa. O objetivo {{principal}} do Programa é a redução da impunidade, criando condições de segurança para pessoas capazes de prestar testemunho, apesar de ameaçadas. A partir de uma revisão do processo de construção histórica do sistema de segurança nacional, é estudado como um instrumento fundamental de garantia ao direito à vida e à segurança, num contexto de violência extrema e cotidiana. O processo de pesquisa produziu uma melhor compreensão das inter-relações, conexões e fatores responsáveis pela sua existência na sociedade brasileira. A análise baseou-se na experiência profissional da autora e nos depoimentos de exprofissionais de Serviço Social pertencentes à equipe de trabalho do Provita. Teve como objetivo central estudar o papel do Serviço Social no Programa, abordando questões relacionadas às atribuições, objetivos e desafios do trabalho do assistente social. A prática profissional foi refletida pelo prisma da defesa dos direitos humanos, de acordo com o preconizado no Código de Ética profissional. Concluiu-se pela necessidade e importância da ampliação da responsabilidade do Estado quanto à execução das atividades de segurança pública, dadas as limitações ao desenvolvimento do atendimento criadas, entre outros fatores, pela ausência de articulação com o conjunto de políticas públicas, essenc iais para o atendimento às necessidades das pessoas em regime de proteção; insuficiência de recursos para a formação e segurança do corpo de profissionais; morosidade do processamento judiciário. Os dados de permanência, entre 2000 e 2005, de 75 protegidos, dos quais 21 testemunharam em processos que chegaram ao veredicto final, e 20 resultaram em condenação, ilustram tanto a importância como as dificuldades do Programa. A prática do assistente social foi sempre permeada pelo desafio do compromisso com os sujeitos de sua prática, em busca da promoção da cidadania e da emancipação, para possibilitar ao protegido condições de luta por seus direitos, durante o processo de proteção e, sobretudo, depoisThe {{purpose of}} this research analyses The Victims and Threatened Witnesses Program of Protection - Provita - appears, in 1996, from an initiative of the civil society {{in partnership with the}} State. As a result of this process, in July 13 1999, is promulgated the Federal Law nº 9. 807, that establishes standards for the organization and maintenance of this Program. The focus of this Program is the reduction of the impunity, creating security conditions to the threatened witnesses. From a revision of the historical construction process of the national security system, it is considered as a basic guarantee instrument to the right to the life and to the security, in a context where the violence and impunity are daily expressed realities. During the research process, we aimed to better understand the inter-relations, connections and factors responsible for the existence of this Program in our Brazilian society and the Social Service role. So, the objective of this research is centered on studying the social worker job in this Program, approaching questions on its attributions, objectives and challenges. It aims to reflect on professional practices, in the prism of human rights defense, in accordance with what was praised in the Code of Professional Ethics. This research concludes the require and importance of enlargement of the responsibility of the State about execution of public security activities, when the limitations were given {{to the development of the}} service created, between other factors, by the absence of articulation with the set of public politics, essential policies for the service to the necessities of the persons in regime of protection; resource insufficiency for the formation and security of the professionals group; slowness of the judicial processing. The data, between 2000 and 2005, of 75 people protected, of which 21 testified in processes that reached the final verdict, and 20 turned in condemnatio n, illustrate both the importance and the difficulties of the Program. We also perceived that the social worker practice still is permeated by the challenge of acting and implementing the commitment with its practice citizens.
