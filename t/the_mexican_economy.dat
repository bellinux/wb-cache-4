He was called back up to Detroit on September 1, but later that month he shocked his teammates by announcing that he was giving up his MLB career and returning to Mexico. López said that his reasons were personal, and he cited his family, the education of his children and <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> <b>economy</b> as motivating factors for the decision. He came out of retirement and returned to Detroit {{in time for the}} 1983 season. In February 1983, López became the first player in MLB history to receive a pay cut through salary arbitration. López had earned $285,000 in 1982, asked for $315,000 for 1983 and was awarded $250,000. He finished 1983 with a 98 record, 2.81 ERA and 18 saves.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Hazel was a weak East Pacific {{tropical}} cyclone that caused heavy damage in Mexico. The costliest storm of the 1965 Pacific hurricane season, it formed from a northward-moving disturbance that originated southeast of Socorro Island. After reaching tropical storm strength on the SaffirSimpson Hurricane Scale, the cyclone {{turned to the}} east-northeast. The storm made landfall near Mazatlán on September 26 and quickly transitioned an extra{{tropical cyclone}}. Although fairly weak, the system was responsible for causing heavy damage to <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> <b>economy.</b> Flooding in Mazatlán washed out many houses and submerged others in muddy water. At least six people died with damages totaling $10million (1965 USD) and possibly higher. The name Hazel was retired following this storm, likely due to the Atlantic storm of the same name.|$|E

25|$|President Miguel de la Madrid (1982–88), {{took office}} during the {{aftermath}} of the crash of <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> <b>economy.</b> During his administration, municipalities were entrusted with providing water supply and sanitation services within the framework of a general decentralization process. At the same time, state governments were made responsible for technical and financial assistance. They were also authorized to decide about the municipalities' capacity for providing the services. Most municipalities neither received the necessary financial resources nor the technical assistance to fulfill their new responsibilities. That is why in 1988 only 10 of 31 Mexican states had devolved responsibility to the municipalities and where they did, service quality and efficiency usually deteriorated.|$|E

2500|$|Carlos Salinas's {{popularity}} and credibility {{at the time}} was high. The economic bubble gave Mexico a prosperity not seen in a generation. This period of rapid growth coupled with low inflation prompted some political thinkers and the media to state that Mexico {{was on the verge of}} becoming a [...] "First World nation". In fact, it was the first of the [...] "newly industrialized nations" [...] to be admitted into the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in May 1994. It was known that the peso was overvalued, but the extent of <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> <b>economy's</b> vulnerability was either not well known or downplayed by both the Salinas administration and the media. This vulnerability was further aggravated by several unexpected events and macroeconomic mistakes made in the last year of his administration.|$|R
50|$|The {{hardened}} {{division of}} class and race remained in the Yucatán until the 1950s when various Mexican central government initiatives were launched {{with the aim of}} modernizing the Mayan communities and reducing poverty by integrating Mayan families into Mexico through new economic opportunities with <b>the</b> larger <b>Mexican</b> <b>economy.</b> Perceiving <b>the</b> lack of sufficient jobs in the city and desirous of not upsetting <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> communities in <b>the</b> cities, the government encouraged and steered many landless farmers, mainly Mayan Indians, into settling in the uncultivated Lacandon Jungle and the abandoned white farms which had suffered an enduring economic depression of the previous twenty years. However, although this kept a social crisis from occurring in the cities, it enraged many displaced Mexican farmers, especially of Criollo class, whose rights to land and title were supposedly being ignored in contravention of the compromise of <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> revolution. Thus, during the 1950s and 1960s, this immigration of Mayans into former white lands led to land-related conflicts and an increasing pressure on the rain forest which in turn led to environmental degradation and further economic ruin of the rural economy. Furthermore, rather than bring individual Mayan families into the practice of private property and <b>the</b> larger <b>Mexican</b> <b>economy,</b> <b>the</b> process backfired as much of the surplus Mayan community moved from its traditional areas into the new lands.|$|R

25|$|The {{collapse}} of <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> <b>economy</b> in 1982 hit VAM {{along with all}} the local auto industry. In February 1983, the Mexican government sold its share of VAM to Renault. The new owner was focused more on the Jeep vehicles along with VAM's dealer network and production facilities. Renault reduced production VAM's passenger car line so it would not compete with its own products. The remaining 1983 VAM cars existed mostly to use up the highest possible amount of existing inventories and to fulfill the previous agreements with sourcing companies. The 1983 Rally AMX is almost an exact copy of the 1982 model, specifically {{the second half of the}} model year production. The only differences between both are the presence of a rear ashtray design shared with the Gremlin and American (due to the loss of the console-mounted rear ashtray), a locally produced instrument cluster replacing the imported unit and the chromed squared door mirrors originally used on the Rally SST (minus the still optional controls). Both optional packages of 1982 were still available this year.|$|E
25|$|After the Spanish Invasion and Conquest, European {{techniques}} and designs were introduced, nearly wiping out the native traditions.

Today, ceramics are still produced from traditional items such as dishes, kitchen utensils to new items such as sculptures and folk art. Despite the fame of the prior, the bulk of ceramic items produced in the country are floor and wall tiles along with bathroom fixtures. Mexico has a number of well-known artisan ceramic traditions, most of which are in the center and south of the country. Examples are the Talavera of Puebla, the majolica of Guanajuato, the various wares of the Guadalajara area, and barro negro of Oaxaca. A more recent addition is the production of Mata Ortiz or Pakimé wares in Chihuahua. While the number of artisans has been dropping due to competition from mass-produced items, the production of folk art and fine ware still has an important role in <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> <b>economy</b> and the production of pottery in general is still important to Mexican culture.|$|E

2500|$|It has {{now been}} over 160 years since the U.S. took over land {{previously}} controlled by Mexico; however, the U.S. still remains in indirect control of <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> <b>economy.</b> Today, by playing such {{a large role in}} the economic factors of its neighboring country, the U.S. continues to show some current attributes of imperialism. Since January 1, 1994, Mexico and the United States (and Canada as well) have eliminated numerous tariffs on imports through the North American Free Trade Agreement. This agreement, despite its benefits for all countries involved, favors the United States. Originally, NAFTA eradicated tariffs on about one-half of U.S. imports from Mexico, and only approximately one-third of Mexican imports from the U.S. [...] After 10 years, NAFTA eliminated all tariffs between the U.S. and Mexico with the exception of some U.S. agricultural exports including grains, meat and some fruits. More recently, <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> <b>economy</b> has relied largely upon the U.S. demand for its exports in order to support itself. [...] It is because of this dependence that the United States still has significant control over <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> <b>economy.</b> [...] Nearly one-fifth of <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> <b>economy</b> alone is dependent upon its manufacturing exports to the U.S. [...] With the economy of the United States currently being in recessed condition, the U.S. has had to decrease production of imports from Mexico. [...] This has hurt <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> <b>economy</b> tremendously.|$|E

[...] Since the United States is a major contributor to the economic problems and lack of jobs in Mexico, undocumented workers should not be viewed in such a negative light by American citizens. These workers have been forced out of their jobs {{due to the}} United States and its negative influence on <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> <b>economy.</b> [...] These immigrants really have no other choice but to come to America in search of jobs and a better life for their families.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} factors and {{mechanisms}} {{that have been}} driving inequality in Mexico and finds that educational inequality accounts for {{by far the largest}} share of Mexico's variation in earnings inequality. The contribution of inequality of education to inequality of earnings in Mexico is the second highest in Latin America, after Brazil, and the significance of education has been increasing over time. Moreover, the income effect is always prevalent, and the distribution of education is highly significant even after controlling for changes in other relevant variables, such as age, economic sector, region, and labor market status. The increase in earnings inequality, however, {{does not appear to be}} the result of a worsening in the distribution of education, although the income profile, which is related to the returns to schooling, has become much steeper. This means that the shift in demand toward high-skilled labor has not been matched by an increase in supply. The probable reason is that <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> <b>economy's</b> increased openness has facilitated the transmission of skill-biased technological change...|$|R
