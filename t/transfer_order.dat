25|$|The Board of Trade were reticent about {{allowing}} a Municipal Authority, {{in this case}} Bradford, to build a railway which was located outside its area of jurisdiction, and was not connected to a railway which started within its area. However, on 30 December 1903, a <b>transfer</b> <b>order</b> was granted, with powers to borrow up to £30,000 to fund the project. In May 1904, the Board of Trade agreed to a change to standard gauge, and borrowing powers were increased to £66,000 in 1908, because of the extra costs of building the wider formation. The document was signed by Winston Churchill, the President of the Board of Trade. In addition to the main reservoir contract, John Best was awarded a contract to build the light railway to Lofthouse for £23,000, and a tramway from Lofthouse to Angram for £5,385.|$|E
500|$|After the sudden, inexplicable {{death of}} a cow on the ranch, Homer sends Lonnie to town to bring Hud to the ranch for his opinion. [...] Lonnie, finding Hud {{just in time to}} take the blame for Hud's tryst with a married woman, protests Hud's putting him in a {{dangerous}} situation as they return to the ranch, with Hud driving over Alma's flowers as they arrive. [...] At the dead animal, Hud shoots several buzzards to scare the flock away against his father's protestations that they keep the land clean and shooting them is illegal. [...] Hud states his immunity to laws that inconvenience him, setting the tone of his overall demeanor. [...] Hud is annoyed by his father's decision to summon the state veterinarian, and suggests selling the animals to other ranchers before the news spreads; otherwise, government agents will kill all the cattle and destroy everything they have worked for. He blames his father for not realizing that the cheap Mexican cattle were sick before he bought them. Adhering to his principles, Homer ignores Hud's idea and waits for the veterinarian. Upon his arrival, the state veterinarian immediately issues a legally binding State Livestock <b>Transfer</b> <b>Order</b> directing the quarantine of the ranch for a possible foot-and-mouth disease outbreak. This freezes the movement of all livestock to or from the Bannon ranch, while they await the test results.|$|E

However, because this process would preserve the remaining powers of the LRO, it {{would mean that the}} land could only be used for railway purposes thereafter and would only be an option for an individual or organisation that wished to re-open the railway. Even then however, the purchaser would still have to apply for new powers to re-open the railway, as those parts of the LRO which related to the operation of the railway, had effectively been abandoned by the railway's closure and lack of track.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{documents}} {{analysis of}} the spatial transferability of an ordered response model, a type of discrete choice model which maintains the ordinal nature in the dependent variable in situations where {{there are more than}} two responses. The analysis focuses on shopping trip generation in Metropolitan Toronto. The paper investigates the performance of a directly <b>transferred</b> <b>ordered</b> response model (without updating the transferred coefficients) and assesses the effectiveness of a technique for revising the constant terms and scalars in the model by using small-sample data from the region to which the model is to be applied. The results of this spatial transferability analysis show that a directly <b>transferred</b> <b>ordered</b> response model performs reasonably well in predicting the aggregate shares in the application (new) context. Revising the constant terms and the scalars in the model substantially improves the predictive ability of the transferred model. ...|$|R

On 20 July 2015, the Government transferred him from the health department's training institute in Indore to Dhar. Rai alleged {{that he was being}} hounded for complaining against Verma, and stated that he would challenge the transfer in court. Rai filed an affidavit in the High court and alleged that Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan had asked him to stop the campaign against Vyapam scam and DMAT scam. In return, his <b>transfer</b> <b>orders</b> will be cancelled. The court then granted one week to the state government to file the counter affidavit.

50|$|The {{application}} by the OR, to {{sell the}} WHR trackbed to GCC was heard in November 1991. FR Holdings Ltd made two applications, the first was for the court to order the validation of the transfers of shares and debentures in the WHLR Company, to FR Holdings. The second was for the court to order a stay on the sale to GCC, {{in order to allow}} time for FR Holdings to attempt a financial reconstruction of the WHLR Company. However, Mr Justice Vinelott ruled the FR/TCL strategy of financial reconstruction to be 'wholly misconceived', as the WHLR company was moribund i.e. there were no longer any living directors (and in particular - no company secretary). There was therefore nobody who could comply with any court order to validate share/debenture transfers and no means to elect a new Board. Mr Justice Vinelott however, ruled that the solution to this problem was for FR Holdings or GCC/WHLR (1964) Ltd to apply for a <b>Transfer</b> <b>Order,</b> under section 24 of the 1896 Light Railways Act. A <b>Transfer</b> <b>Order</b> is in effect a licence to transfer the remaining powers of an LRO from one railway company to another, following the agreement of a sale. Any such sale can only be made to the holders of a <b>Transfer</b> <b>Order.</b> It was also made clear formally at this point that any applicant for a <b>Transfer</b> <b>Order,</b> would have to rebuild the whole railway. Mr Justice Vinelott also ruled that the existing 1922 Light Railway Order could not be used to rebuild the railway and that new powers would have to be sought - Stephen Wiggs had been right! The judge did not pass judgement on the OR's application but, instead, granted a stay, to allow time for both parties to apply for a <b>Transfer</b> <b>Order.</b> The judge further stated that he was suspicious of GCC's motives {{for the rest of the}} trackbed past Pont Croesor.|$|E
