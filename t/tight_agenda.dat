Furthermore a in a dedicated session elaboration of laboratory results were illustrated a web based tool was presented. The combination of theoretical basis and practical sessions in a <b>tight</b> <b>agenda</b> has allowed more interaction with and among participants on the practical laboratory work needs for a proper design and execution of the field monitoring campaigns and emission product testing. In total 33 external participants including 6 speakers as well as 7 internal representatives of JRC. IHCP. I. 1 (5 speakers) took part in this training program. The Training Course was aimed as a capacity building activity targeting the countries involved in the EU Strategy for the Danube Region (EUSDR) and other EU Accession and Candidate countries and aims at providing hands on training on: a) 	State-of-the-art techniques, standards and protocols to measure and monitor {{a wide array of}} health relevant air pollutants and tools for evaluating the associated health effects in buildings as well as quality control/assurance to enhance data comparability across regions/ countries b) 	Methodologies to test emissions from construction materials and consumer products and evaluate the associated health risksJRC.

La Universidad de Cantabria ofrece servicios y soporte para Moodle, de forma que la mayoría de titulaciones y asignaturas cuentan con espacios virtuales en los que {{profesores}} y alumnos pueden estar informados sobre los eventos de la asignatura (clases, fechas de entrega, etc.), consultar materiales, entregar tareas o prácticas, interactuar mediante foros, etc. Mediante estos sistemas el alumno puede estar al día de los eventos de cada asignatura y organizar mejor su tiempo de trabajo. Sin embargo, al tener cada asignatura un calendario propio los alumnos no tienen una visión general de su carga de trabajo. Muy a menudo el propio alumno ha de ir consultando curso a curso y mientras confecciona a mano un calendario integrado para saber cuáles son sus entregas semanales o mensuales y de este modo gestionar mejor su tiempo. A este hecho se une el de que el estudiante medio tiene una agenda demasiado apretada, y en la mayoría de los casos no dispone del tiempo suficiente para consultar los cursos, lo que deriva a que el alumno participa menos e incluso puede que se olvide de mirar los eventos que el curso tiene preparados para él. Con el objetivo de facilitar la autogestión de tiempo de trabajo y estudio al alumno este proyecto pretende crear una aplicación móvil de consulta rápida para la plataforma Moodle. Esta aplicación por un lado le facilitará al alumno el acceso rápido a información importante de cada asignatura, y por otro lado mostrará de forma integrada los eventos siguientes de todas las asignaturas en las que está matriculado, por lo que no será necesario acceder a cada curso de forma individual a la hora de adquirir información. En cuanto a las tecnologías utilizadas para el desarrollo de este proyecto, se ha optado por Phonegap como Framework de desarrollo, ya que permite compilar la aplicación para las principales plataformas móviles (Android, iOS, WindowsPhone, etc.) y se han utilizado los lenguajes HTML, CSS, JavaScript y PHP. ABSTRACT: Almost all {{universities have}} virtual tools to support {{learning and teaching}} of students, among which Moodle {{is probably the most}} widespread. The University of Cantabria provides services and support for Moodle, so that most degrees and courses have virtual spaces where teachers and students can be informed about the events of the course (lectures, deadlines, etc.), check materials/notes, turn in assignments or practices, interact through forums, etc. Through these systems, students can keep abreast of events in each subject and better organize their working time. However, as each course has its own schedule, it is difficult for students to have an overview of their workload. Very often, students themselves have to consult each course separately, to then draw up a full schedule to know what their weekly or monthly installments are, and thus, better manage their time. This is coupled {{with the fact that the}} average student usually has a pretty <b>tight</b> <b>agenda</b> and, in most cases, does not have enough time to see the courses, which results in the student participating less and may even forgetting to look at the available events the course has for him/her. In order to facilitate self-management of work-study time, this project aims to create a quick reference mobile application for Moodle platform. This application, on the one hand, will provide students quick access to important information from each subject and, on the other, will seamlessly show the upcoming events in all subjects in which they are enrolled, so they will not need to access each course individually at the time of acquiring information. In terms of technologies utilized for the development of this project, Phonegap has been chosen as development Framework, since it allows to compile the application to major mobile platforms (Android, iOS, WindowsPhone, etc.). Finally, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP have been used as programming languages. Ingeniería en Informátic...|$|E

Furthermore, because the samples used in the pilot and in the large-scale assessment study comprise students from diverse academic backgrounds within a wide age range, this questionnaire is suitable for implementation in a variety of instructional situations and contexts. In addition, by allowing to collect data on various elements in a single application, this instrument is a time-efficient option even for studies with <b>tight</b> research <b>agendas.</b> However, more than present the science education research community with a novel quantitative measurement instrument, this work contributes with the definition of a procedural guideline for studies framed within the scope of quantitative assessment that {{can be applied to the}} improvement of the validity and reliability of the data collected in diverse evaluative settings. In this context, it must be mentioned that this study does not seek to produce a better or generally more suitable instrument than the biotechnology knowledge inventories and attitudes scales available in published research. Likewise, the validation procedure presented is not exclusive nor to be applied in every science education survey developmental study. The goal is to provide an insightful perspective on an efficient and easily available validation procedure that has wide applicability in quantitative research. It contributes to demonstrate that psychometric analysis methods are not impervious statistical techniques that may seem unappealing and complex to unacquainted researchers.|$|R
40|$|Increasingly {{doctoral}} {{candidates are}} attempting to complete a thesis by publication. This format varies between universities but there are common issues particularly in terms of progression, planning and timing. There are both advantages and difficulties involved in undertaking a thesis in this format. Our discussion of the supervisor/candidate partnership is framed within the requirements of a <b>tight</b> journal publishing <b>agenda.</b> Different universities have different requirements {{about the number of}} published papers to be included, the extent of candidate&# 039;s contribution as sole or joint author, the framing of the research as a unified thesis, presentation, and examination. The decision to attempt a thesis by publication must be taken early and data collection may need to be completed early. Articles then need to be written, polished, submitted, reviewed, revised and, hopefully, accepted. The thesis by publication is a juggling act between maintaining coherence and focusing on publishable segments. It is also a dialogue between supervisor and candidate involving the resolution of sometimes conflicting demands. Employing Cognitive Apprenticeship theory we present a shared autophenomenography that chronicles our doctoral journey that led to a successful thesis by publication. The findings are discussed under thematic headings: Logistics, Cognitive Apprenticeship in Action, and Building Trust...|$|R
