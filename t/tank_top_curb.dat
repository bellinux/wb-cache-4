2500|$|The tankini is a {{swimsuit}} combining a <b>tank</b> <b>top,</b> mostly made of spandex-and-cotton or Lycra-and-nylon, and {{a bikini}} bottom {{introduced in the}} late 1990s. According to author William Safire, [...] "The most recent evolution of the -kini family is the tankini, a cropped <b>tank</b> <b>top</b> supported by spaghetti-like strings." [...] The tankini is distinguished from the classic bikini by the difference in tops, {{the top of the}} tankini essentially being a <b>tank</b> <b>top.</b> The tankini top extends downward to somewhere between just above the navel and the top of the hips. The word is a neologism combining the <b>tank</b> of <b>tank</b> <b>top</b> {{with the end of the}} word bikini. This go-between nature of tankini has rendered its name to things ranging from a lemonade-based martini (Tankini Martini) to server architecture (Tankini HipThread). This type of swimwear is considered by some to provide modesty closer to that of a one piece suit but with the convenience of a two piece suit, such as not needing to remove the entire suit in order to use a lavatory.|$|R
