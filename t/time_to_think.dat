5|$|After {{covering}} up a murder that occurred at The Crazy Horse, Adriana is arrested and pressured by the FBI {{to wear a}} wire to avoid being charged as an accomplice. She refuses to wear a wire and informs the FBI that she {{may be able to}} persuade her fiancé Christopher to co-operate and become an informant against Tony. She confesses to Christopher that she has been informing and that the FBI would give them new identities if they would testify. Christopher is grief-stricken and nearly kills her. He leaves the apartment, saying he needs <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>think.</b> Tony has Silvio pick up Adriana under the pretense of taking her to see Christopher, but instead drives her out to the woods and executes her. Adriana’s betrayal and subsequent execution is too much for Christopher to handle and he briefly returns to drug abuse to deal with the pain.|$|E
5|$|During the reception, Grace learns {{many things}} {{she did not}} know about Leo, {{including}} that his first name is Marvin (revealed by his mother, Eleanor (Judith Ivey)). So many unsettling details about Leo come to light that Grace becomes uneasy and leaves the reception; Leo follows her. The two run into Katie in the lobby who tells them that The Today Show has scrapped the wedding segment because the judge who performed the ceremony was not licensed in New York so their marriage is not valid. Upon learning this, Grace tells Leo that she needs <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about their relationship. Leo returns to the reception and announces to everyone that his marriage to Grace is not legitimate. Grace returns to the reception later, and reveals that she does want to marry Leo.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, Fischer {{stayed at}} the home of {{grandmaster}} Peter Biyiasas, where, over a period of four months, he defeated Biyiasas seventeen times in a series of speed games. In an interview with Sports Illustrated reporter William Nack, Biyiasas assessed Fischer's play:He was too good. There was no use in playing him. It wasn't interesting. I was getting beaten, and it wasn't clear to me why. It wasn't like I made this mistake or that mistake. It was like I was being gradually outplayed, from the start. He wasn't taking any <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>think.</b> The most depressing thing about it is that I wasn't even getting out of the middle game to an endgame. I don't ever remember an endgame. He honestly believes there is no one for him to play, no one worthy of him. I played him, and I can attest to that.|$|E

But Jekyll reveals that he had another dose of the separation serum, allowing Regina the chance to push the Evil Queen out. Snow injects the red serum into Regina's arm, and Emma and Snow stand by, ready to help. Regina and the Evil Queen split into two entities, and Regina rips the evil queen's heart out and crushes it, destroying her darkness.|$|E

Corporeally considered, men not infrequently {{fall in love}} with their opposites, the phenomenally tall with the painfully short, the unnecessarily stout with the distressingly slender. But even such inartistic juxtapositions are much less common than we are apt at <b>times</b> <b>to</b> <b>think.</b> For it must never be forgotten that the exceptional character of the phenomena renders them conspicuous, the customary more consorted combinations failing to excite attention.|$|R
25|$|Black Widow tracked a knife {{covered in}} Wolverine's {{blood in the}} {{possession}} of A.I.M. to a research facility in Moscow. Captain America and Deadpool went to retrieve it in order to prevent A.I.M. from misusing Wolverine's DNA. Deadpool was given the blood-covered knife by Captain America to do with it as he wanted. Deadpool had recently acquired an incubator that could create new bodies using a DNA sample. Deadpool deferred the decision to bring Wolverine back to life until he had more <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> on whether it would have been what Wolverine wanted.|$|E
25|$|The next day, Verdonk {{said that}} she still needed some more <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> over her {{decision}} again, but Rutte declined this, and she was formally expelled from the parliamentary faction of the VVD on 14 September 2007. In October 2007, the VVD party board gave her the option of either giving up her parliamentary seat, or face exclusion procedures from the party. Verdonk announced that she would leave the party but stay in Parliament.

25|$|With the {{building}} itself taking shape, it was <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about its internal adornments. In a process overseen by a Royal Fine Art Commission under the presidency of Prince Albert, a Select Committee which included Sir Robert Peel started to take witness accounts from experts in 1841. Those experts included Sir Martin Archer Shee, P.R.A., and Charles Lock Eastlake, painter and acknowledged authority on art history, soon to be first director of the National Gallery and de facto administrator of the whole Westminster decoration project. It was decided that the opportunity should be seized to encourage {{the development of a}} national British school of History Painting, and that the paintings should be done in fresco.|$|E

25|$|But Paley, {{according}} to CBS historian Robert Metz, {{also learned that}} Benny chafed under NBC's almost indifferent attitude toward the talent that attracted the listeners. NBC, {{under the leadership of}} David Sarnoff, seemed at the <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that listeners were listening to NBC because of NBC itself. To Paley, {{according to}} Metz, that was foolish thinking at best: Paley believed listeners were listening because of the talent, not because of which platform hosted them. When Paley said as much to Benny, the comedian agreed. Because Paley took a personal interest in the Benny negotiations, as opposed to Sarnoff, who had never met his top-rated star, Benny was convinced to make the jump. He convinced a number of his fellow NBC performers (notably Burns and Allen, Edgar Bergen, Red Skelton and Kate Smith) to join him.|$|E
25|$|Carrie {{asks her}} {{contacts}} {{for information on}} an underground doctor {{in the area where}} Quinn went missing. Following a tip from former Hezbollah commander Al-Amin (George Georgiou), she tracks down one of the cell's supporters, Dr. Hussein (Mehdi Nebbou). Under threat of arrest, he brings her to an apartment belonging to Qasim (Alireza Bayram), one of the terrorists. In the apartment, Carrie finds extensive research on the Hauptbahnhof train station and heads there to investigate. She finds Qasim in the subway, and pleads with him to stop the plan to bomb the station. Qasim tries to reason with his cousin Bibi (René Ifrah), the ringleader, but Bibi kills him. Carrie then shoots and kills Bibi, neutralizing the threat. Back home, Jonas breaks up with Carrie, saying that neither he nor his son will ever be safe around her. Saul asks Carrie to rejoin the CIA, but she declines his offer. Düring essentially proposes to her, giving her a chance to co-head his Foundation. She does not answer him, and he gives her <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about it.|$|E
25|$|Notwithstanding Creelman’s glorified {{account of}} Díaz, Creelman does {{highlight}} the immediacy Díaz took to establish order—and fear—into dissenters of law {{as soon as}} he went into power in 1876. Díaz created localized bands of vigilantes, knowns as the rurales, who “punish robbery with death and requir the execution of culprits within a few hours after they were caught.” If the thief was not caught within a few hours, the chief officer of the given district would suffer the consequences. The same was said for the hacienda owner whose presumed thief Indian was not caught. Díaz continues: “It is true that we were harsh….to the point of great cruelty…. it was necessary then to the life and progress of the nation. The results have justified it” since “Mexico needed peace, even an enforced peace, that the nation might have <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> and work.” Creelman supports Díaz and states that even though Díaz “straighten out the public debt,” economized public expenditure, and industrialized the country, “his eyes were ever fixed on… a peace born of constructive and persuasive statesmanship, backed by strength, but to be maintained by force alone, when necessary—as the indispensable preliminary and accompaniment of national regeneration” In the long run, brutality and cruelty, according to Creelman’s interview of Díaz, were necessary elements to bring order, progress, and peace to Mexico.|$|E

As she told the writer Gloria Steinem during the 1968 presidential campaign, [...] "I never had <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about things like that—who I wanted to be, or who I admired, or to have ideas.

500|$|... "Love American Style" [...] {{was written}} by Melissa Rosenberg and {{directed}} by Robert Lieberman. The episode was Rosenberg's first for the series and her first on a show written for a premium network. Having had over 10 years' experience in writing for free-to-air commercial networks—which typically have 22–26 episodes per season rather than 12, with a much tighter schedule—she finished writing the script five weeks before it was due for preparation. She said that [...] "There was <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about storytelling. I never had that on any show; it's just wonderful." ...|$|E

500|$|Hamming {{remained}} at Los Alamos until 1946, when he accepted a {{post at the}} [...] Bell Telephone Laboratories (BTL). For the trip to New Jersey, he bought Klaus Fuchs's old car. When he later sold it just weeks before Fuchs was unmasked as a spy, the FBI regarded the timing as suspicious enough to interrogate Hamming. Although Hamming described his role at Los Alamos as being that of a [...] "computer janitor", he saw computer simulations of experiments {{that would have been}} impossible to perform in a laboratory.

500|$|Cisneros {{currently}} {{resides in}} San Miguel de Allende, {{a city in}} central Mexico, but for years she lived and wrote in San Antonio, Texas, in her briefly controversial [...] "Mexican-pink" [...] home with [...] "many creatures little and large." [...] In 1990 when Pilar E. Rodríguez Aranda asked Cisneros in an interview for the Americas Review why she has never married or started a family, Cisneros replied, [...] "I've never seen a marriage that is as happy as my living alone. My writing is my child and I don't want anything to come between us." [...] She has elaborated elsewhere that she enjoys living alone because it gives her <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> and write. In {{the introduction to the}} third edition of Gloria E. Anzaldúa's Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza, Cisneros wrote: [...] "It's why I moved from Illinois to Texas. So that the relatives and family would allow me the liberty to disappear into myself. To reinvent myself if I had to. As Latinas, we have to...

500|$|The pace of Blue's Clues was deliberate, and its {{material}} was presented clearly. Similar to Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, which also inspired the producers, {{this was done}} was {{in the use of}} pauses that were [...] "long enough to give the youngest <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>think,</b> short enough for the oldest not to get bored." [...] The length of the pauses, which was estimated from formative research, gave children enough time to process the information and solve the problem. After pausing, child voice-overs provided the answers so that they were given to children who had not come up with the solution and helped encourage viewer participation. Researcher Alisha M. Crawley and her colleagues stated that the show was [...] "unique in making overt involvement a systematic research-based design element." [...] In 2002, the success of Blue's Clues inspired the producers of Sesame Street to change its format and add more interactive segments. Blue's Clues also differed from Sesame Street by not using cultural references or humor aimed at adults, as this could confuse preschoolers but, instead, made the show literal, which the producers felt would better hold the children's attention. The structure of each episode was repetitive, designed to provide preschoolers with comfort and predictability.|$|E
