The first church, made of cogon and wood was constructed in 1820 and was dedicated to Mary Magdalene. Father Antonio Moreno, OFM was appointed at its first parish priest in 1821. A permission to build a stone church was ordered by Captain Pablo de la Concepción in 1829. [...] To obtain funds for the church, the people were forced to pay taxes and quarry sand and stones from the river. The construction of the church building was halted in 1839, continued in 1849 and finished in 1855 {{under the direction of}} Father Maximo Rico, Father Jose Cuesta, Father Joaquin de Coria and Father Francisco de Paula Gonzalez.

This site was chosen because of its favourable position relative to the prevailing westerly winds which allowed hill soaring. Launching was initially by means of a bungee rope and later by winch and aero <b>tow.In</b> 1935 the clubs wooden hangars were replaced by the present building designed by the renowned architect and club member Kit Nicholson. The LGC soon became one of the biggest gliding clubs in the country. It hosted many National gliding competitions, and many national and world records were set from it. On 22 April 1939 the first soaring flight across the English Channel was made by Geoffrey Stephenson in a Slingsby Gull 1 glider. The launch was by winch and the landing place was Le Wast in France.|$|E

40|$|Research {{suggests}} that the feedback-related negativity (FRN) is only sensitive to expectancy when the prediction violation is salient. To further examine this issue, we asked participants to guess which of two virtual doors hid 5 cents. Prior to and after making their guess, participants were asked {{whether or not they}} expected to win. We extracted four conditions based on subjects ’ predictions before and after their choice of door: (1) win/win, (2) lose/lose, (3) win/lose, and (4) lose/win. Results revealed that the FRNwas largest on trials in which subjects predicted {{they were not going to}} win and then changed theirminds and predicted that theywere going <b>towin</b> (i. e., the lose/win condition). Togetherwith previous FRN results and findings in the area of regret and decision making, we suggest that the FRN reflects a context-sensitive signal that integrates information about current and past actions, thoughts, and emotions.

40|$|The alcohol {{field is}} {{becoming}} {{more aware of the}} consequences of world trade law for alcohol policies. However, {{there is a need for}} greater clarity about the different effects of trade on alcohol-related harm. Methods A comprehensive review of all literature on alcohol and world trade [including World Trade Organization (WTO) disputes on alcohol], supported by amore selective review of other relevant cases, academic reports and the grey literature on trade and health. Results The burden of WTO law on alcohol policies depends upon the type of policy in question. Purely protectionist policies are likely to be struck down, which may lead to increases in alcohol-related harm. Partly protectionist and partly health-motivated policies are also at risk of being struck down. However, purely health-motivated policies are likely to be defended by the WTO—and to the extent that policy makers misunderstand this, they are needlessly avoiding effective ways of reducing alcohol-related harm. Conclusions WTO agreements contain genuine and substantial risks to alcohol policies, and various ways of minimizing future risks are suggested. However, the‘chilling effect’ of mistakenly overestimating these constraints should be avoided. Health policy makers should decide on which policies to pursue based primarily on considerations of effectiveness, ethics and politics rather than legality. As long as any effect of these policies on trade is minimized, they are overwhelmingly likely <b>towin</b> any challenges at the WTO. ...|$|E
40|$|From {{about the}} age of {{thirteen}} I developed an intense interest in the game and decided that I was going to win the county championship, the British cham-pionship, become a}Vl:ister, aGrandmaster, andperhaps go on <b>towin</b> theworld title. I was rudely rebutted when, in my first tourniment, I ended up with a mere four and a half points out of nine, but, undaunted, I studied theory and practised intensely, and the following year I did indeed win the county cham-pionship, outright,with seven and a half points out of nine- sixwins and three draws. Okay, this was the junior championship, and all the really good players werr playing in the national championships down on the South-East Coast at the time, but I hadwon the Middlesex Championship! I went on to play for the county, and in all the time I was playing I never lost for Middlesex, a record which I still treasure. I played on board one on at least one occasion, and I never lost a game of chess for my county! I played for my local club too, and although my results were nowhere near as impressive, I always won more games than I lost. Apart from the Middlesexjuniors, my best result was in a congress at Gants Hill, Ilford, when I was joint first in a Major Tournament, (1) scoring five and a half points out of six. ln 1976 or 1977 I gave up. I played a bit from 19 &l- 5, but only to pass the time and never at a club. Apart from that I hardly looked at a chess board again until Januar,y t 997,when, spending some time at Her Mqiesty's Pleasure, it was an excellent way of killing time. Following my acquittal and release in May 1997,I quickly joined my local chess club, and on May 18 th, at the age of forty, I played in my lirst chess congress for 20 years. And won it! Actually, I scored five points out. of six in a Minor Tournament (for players graded under 135) in a one day "Rapidplay " event. I came joint first with two other players-both ofwhom I beat; the one player who beat me having been beaten by both of them. I played in two more tournaments in quick successionl a regular (ie non-Rapidplay) congress at the same venue, in which I scored three points out of five in the Minor Tournament (2 wins, 2 draws and 1 loss), and a very smal...|$|E
