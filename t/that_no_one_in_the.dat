Furthermore, Princess Victoria was said to have borne a strong family resemblance to her father and grandfather George III.|$|E

25|$|Tony Kanal {{went to one}} of the band's early {{shows and}} soon joined the band as its bassist. After {{initially}} rejecting her advances, he began dating Gwen, but they kept their relationship secret for a year, feeling that it was an unspoken rule <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> band dates her. Paul Caseley (trombone) also joined the band in 1987. Eric Carpenter (saxophone) joined the horn section soon after.|$|E

25|$|In 1652, the Court at the Colony of Connecticut {{ordered that}} no Indian could walk near an Englishman's house either in town or at his farm on the Sabbath without being fined or imprisoned. In 1656, it was ordered <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Colony of Connecticut could sell an Indian a horse or mare or any boat or boat rigging without {{suffering}} a penalty of 5 to 1. The tribe maintains a small reservation in the Nichols section of Trumbull {{that is considered}} to be the oldest continuing reservation in Connecticut and the smallest in the US.|$|E
25|$|In 1788, the British Committee for the Abolition of Slavery sent a Swedish {{opponent}} of the slave trade, Anders Sparrman, to Gustav III. The committee feared that other nations would expand their trade if Britain stopped its own. They sent books about the issue and a letter, in which the king was encouraged to hinder his subjects {{to participate in this}} disgraceful trade. In the response letter, delivered through Sparrman, he wrote <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country had participated in the slave trade and that he would do all that he could to keep them from doing so.|$|E
25|$|The Libyan Arab Jamhairiya {{rejected}} {{the allegations against}} the country. They pointed to how their country is founded on direct people's democracy that guaranteed direct exercise of authority by all citizens through the people's congresses. Citizens were able to express opinions of the congresses on issues related to political, economic, social, and cultural issues. In addition, there were information platforms such as newspapers and TV channels for people to express their opinions through. Libyan authorities also argued <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Libyan Arab Jamahiriya suffered from extreme poverty and hunger, {{and that the government}} guaranteed a minimum of food and essential needs to people with low incomes. In 2006, an initiative was adopted for providing people with low incomes investment potfolios amounting to $30,000 to be deposited with banks and companies.|$|E

25|$|It seemed <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Channel Nine box {{could make}} a comment about him that wasn't negative. His feet, hands, {{technique}} and temperament were questioned. His second-innings 46 was not enough. And they weren't always wrong. It just seemed kind of mean. Especially when {{at the back of}} the press box some seemed happy when he was out. But it went deeper than McNamara's comments. Bailey had made mistakes in his career. He hadn't made enough first-class runs. He hadn't come into the team as a young man. He came into the captaincy without playing a game. He came into the Test team because of one-day runs. He was everything old-school cricket didn't like. A thinking cricketer who had never demanded inclusion, but who had been included regardless. For old-school types like Ian Chappell, he was pretty much everything he didn't like. And Chappell wasn't just turning on Bailey because of his stoush with Channel Nine. He had not liked Bailey for a long time.|$|E
500|$|On December 4, Lansing {{announced}} in a Senate committee hearing <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cabinet had spoken with or seen Wilson in over sixty days. The senators seeking to elevate Marshall requested that a committee {{be sent to}} check on Wilson's condition, hoping to gain evidence to support their cause. Dubbed the [...] "smelling committee" [...] by several newspapers, the group discovered Wilson was in very poor health, but seemed to have recovered enough of his faculties to make decisions. Their report ended the perceived need for the joint resolution.|$|E

500|$|Wolstencroft {{wrote the}} death {{scene with the}} {{intention}} of giving the audience the impression <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> series is safe. According to producer Jane Featherstone, the idea to kill off a main character involved a female getting [...] "her head set on fire" [...] later in the series, but she decided [...] "let's move the most dramatic thing you've got to episode two and kill off the only actress the audience recognise [...] and then you've got them hooked." [...] Matthew Macfadyen stated that the shooting of the death scene, although not emotionally draining, was rather tough, and gruelling to perform. The part where Osbourne forces Flynn's arm into the fryer was done with a rubber arm made to double Faulkner's arm. Furthermore, the [...] "oil" [...] was in fact cold tea with food colour.|$|E
500|$|The {{commercial}} {{success of the}} single [...] "(Don't Fear) The Reaper" [...] in 1976, {{and a series of}} Platinum and Gold discs in the following years, placed pressure on the band as their label, Columbia Records, expected them to repeat these successes. Despite good sales of the album Fire of Unknown Origin and the single [...] "Burnin' for You", in August 1981 the conflicts and the stress accumulated in more than ten years of cohabitation led to the firing of drummer Albert Bouchard, a founding member and an important contributor to the songwriting and sound of the group, allegedly for unstable behavior. The relationship between the former band mates remained tense in the following years. Old feuds resurfaced during a short reunion tour with the original line-up in 1985, with the result <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> band accepted Albert Bouchard back in Blue Öyster Cult. However, A. Bouchard still hoped to be reinstated in the band through his work done for Imaginos.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} years of her career, McLeod's playing style was {{described}} as exuberant and with [...] "boisterous" [...] energy. Her kinetic style of goalkeeping was something that came naturally to her in her youth. Tim Rosenfeld, now a coach at the University of Wisconsin, first saw McLeod in the early 2000s while he was coaching at Penn State University and noted that she was [...] "out of control" [...] and kept coming off her line [...] "going for balls she had no business going for." [...] When she eventually transferred to Penn State in 2004, Rosenfeld stated that [...] "she'd make saves <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world could make, but she'd also made decisions that allowed a bad goal." [...] As a youth player in 2002, the FIFA U-19 Women's World Championship Technical Study Group noted that she was [...] "self-assured in all situations," [...] has [...] "good positioning" [...] and [...] "organized defense well." ...|$|E

500|$|At 3:20p.m., the {{screwdriver}} {{slipped and}} the upper beryllium hemisphere fell, causing a [...] "prompt critical" [...] reaction and a burst of hard radiation. At the time, the scientists in the room observed the blue glow of air ionization and felt a heat wave. Slotin experienced a sour taste {{in his mouth and}} an intense burning sensation in his left hand. He jerked his left hand upward, lifting the upper beryllium hemisphere and dropping it to the floor, ending the reaction. However, he had already been exposed to a lethal dose of neutron radiation. At the time of the accident, dosimetry badges were in a locked box about [...] from the accident. Realizing <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> room had their film badges on, [...] "immediately after the accident Dr. Slotin asked to have the badges taken from the lead box and placed on the critical assembly". This peculiar response was attributed to [...] "vertigo" [...] and was of no value for determining the actual doses received by the men in the room.|$|E
500|$|For several months, {{the demand}} {{of the public}} for vengeance increased, so that Mallory feared that he would {{face the death penalty}} if convicted. However, no bill of {{particulars}} to specify precisely which of his acts constituted treason was ever presented, and it became increasingly clear <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Confederate government was guilty of assassinating the former president. The period for extracting vengeance passed with no one put on trial, and hope was revived. From his prison cell, Mallory began to write letters in a personal campaign to gain release. He petitioned President Andrew Johnson directly, and enlisted the support of some of his former colleagues in the Senate. His wife Angela visited Washington and importuned President Johnson and other persons who had influence. Johnson was already quite lenient in granting pardons, and the popular clamor for harsh punishment began to recede {{by the end of the}} year. On March 10, 1866, Johnson granted Mallory a [...] "partial parole." [...] Although he was no longer in jail, he was required to stay with his daughter in Bridgeport, Connecticut until he could take the oath of allegiance.|$|E
500|$|While making {{repairs to}} his ships, {{particularly}} the battered Phoebe, and transferring prisoners from Renommée, Schomberg despatched Racehorse to Tamatave {{to investigate the}} situation at the port. De Rippe returned on 24 May and informed Schomberg that Néréide was in the harbour and the town was {{in the hands of}} a French garrison. Despite sailing directly to Tamatave, Schomberg's ships were delayed by a gale and did not arrive until the afternoon of 25 May. Aware <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> British squadron had intimate knowledge of the coral reefs that surrounded the entrance to the bay and thus that he was poorly positioned to attack the French if they chose to resist him, Schomberg sent Racehorse into the harbour under a flag of truce. De Rippe presented the French commander, Lieutenant François Ponée, with a demand for surrender, the demand falsely stating that [...] "Renommée and Clorinde have struck after a brave defence". Ponée refused, instead proposing that the ship's crew and the garrison of Tamatave be repatriated to France without conditions if the frigate, town and a 12-gun battery were surrendered to Schomberg's squadron. Schomberg accepted Ponée's proposal and Tamatave and Néréide were surrendered without further conflict.|$|E
50|$|A {{common thread}} of constructionist {{argument}} is <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> antiquity or the Middle Ages experienced homosexuality as an exclusive, permanent, or defining mode of sexuality. John Boswell has countered this argument by citing ancient Greek writings by Plato, which describe individuals exhibiting exclusive homosexuality.|$|R

500|$|Lang avoided {{continuation}} of the Prayer Book controversy of 1928 by allowing the parliamentary process to lapse. He then authorised a statement permitting use of the rejected Book locally if the parochial church council gave approval. The issue remained dormant {{for the rest of}} Lang's tenure at Canterbury. He led the 1930 Lambeth Conference, where further progress was made in improving relations with the Orthodox Churches and the Old Catholics, although again no agreement could be reached with the non-episcopal Free Churches. [...] On an issue of greater concern to ordinary people, the Conference gave limited approval, for the first time, to the use of contraceptive devices, an issue in which Lang had no interest. Through the 1930s Lang continued to work for Church unity. In 1933 the Church of England assembly formed a Council on Foreign Relations and, in the following years, numerous exchange visits with Orthodox delegations took place, a process only halted by the outbreak of war. Lang's 1939 visit to the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople is regarded as the high point of his ecumenical record. George Bell, Bishop of Chichester, maintained <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Anglican Communion did more than Lang to promote the unity movement.|$|E
500|$|James Hunt, in {{his review}} for Den of Geek, was {{surprised}} <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> episode reacted to Troi undergoing {{what he saw as}} a form of rape. He also felt that her eagerness to have the child could have been a type of mind control, but none of the crew seem to consider that as a possibility. He said that the crew failed to act rationally {{for the sake of the}} plot, which was one of his pet peeves in television, adding that you could [...] "Replace any main character in this episode with a parsnip and the outcome will be unchanged." [...] Hunt also described the introduction of new elements as [...] "clunky", feigning [...] "wonder" [...] that [...] "someone doesn't say 'Nice facial hair, beardo' to Riker because that's the level of subtlety they go for." [...] Zack Handlen, in reviewing the episode for The A.V. Club gave it a score of D+, criticising the passive nature of Troi and equated her pregnancy to rape. The entire life of the child was presented as a [...] "joyous life experience", and Handlen described the lack of issues in a three-day pregnancy as [...] "bunk". He felt that the episode would have been better served by concentrating on the hard science fiction concept of the plasma plague, which was only used as a macguffin.|$|E
500|$|The {{entire staff}} agrees to pool their points towards Andy's butt tattoo, {{and the office}} {{suddenly}} becomes a hubbub of activity, with Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker) even giving up his nap-time to make sales calls for Sabre's new Pyramid tablet. To Andy's great dismay, they earn 5,000 points {{by the end of}} the day. When Andy and the crew go to the tattoo parlor, Andy backs down and admits to Jim that he is not sure why Robert made him manager. Jim reassures Andy that he managed to pick up sales, and <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> office expects him to go through with the tattoo idea. Pepped up by Jim's talk, Andy enthusiastically agrees to getting the tattoo, which Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) changes, without telling Andy, to an image of a dog that has [...] "Nard" [...] written on it, a reference to Andy's nickname [...] "Nard Dog." [...] Upon seeing his completed tattoo in a mirror, Andy is pleased with the result. Robert then reveals to the cameras that he picked Andy because he is an uncomplicated choice which causes people to rally behind him, because he is an underdog. Meanwhile, Pam and Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) become walking buddies at Angela's request, but after Angela says she's reported Pam to Social Services for drinking herbal tea out of coffee mugs while pregnant, a disgusted Pam tells Angela they should not have anything else to do with each other.|$|E
60|$|From {{the whole}} scene {{proceeded}} a ground rumble, miles in extent, upon which individual rattles, voices, a tin whistle, the bark of a dog, rode like bubbles on a sea.
