However, due to Zhang Yadong's unavailability during this period (he was engaged on other projects), Faye decided to treat this last album with EMI as an experiment whereby she would collaborate with new producers/musicians/lyricists and 'see what <b>their</b> <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> her will be'.|$|E
25|$|In Srinagar, {{the capital}} of Indian-administered Kashmir, a {{previously}} unknown militant group calling itself Lashkar-e-Jabbar claimed responsibility {{for a series of}} acid attacks on women who did not wear the burqa in 2001, threatening to punish women who do not adhere to <b>their</b> <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> Islamic dress. Women of Kashmir, most of whom are not fully veiled, defied the warning, and the attacks were condemned by prominent militant and separatist groups of the region.|$|E

25|$|The American Colonization Society {{was active}} from late 1816 {{to the end}} of the Civil War, their goal being the {{establishment}} of an African republic where former slaves could experience a freedom not available to them in the United States. There were other reasons also for expatriation, as freedmen in the slave states were seen as disruptive to the slave system. Even among some abolitionists in the north freedman were seen as incompatible to <b>their</b> <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> American society.|$|E
25|$|Physically {{powerful}} batsmen often {{attempt to}} strike {{the ball on the}} rise, even though this obstructs <b>their</b> <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> the ball since it is not uncommon that their sheer brute force combined with the speed of the ball will cause it to fly to the boundary.

25|$|One choice {{made by the}} {{development}} team was to use an existing {{system on a chip}} (SOC) rather than creating their own as they had done on previous consoles. Koizumi said that this break from tradition was done to gain more third-party support for the console by using an SOC that developers could easily port to. Koizumi said that they were not focused on raw processing power, but were instead looking to balance the overall features of the system, including battery life and size. For this reason, they did not opt to use the more powerful hardware they could have used, instead using a middle-ground approach to achieve <b>their</b> <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> the Switch.|$|E
25|$|Martin Hall {{writes that}} the history of Iron Age {{research}} south of the Zambezi shows the prevalent influence of colonial ideologies, both in the earliest speculations {{about the nature of the}} African past and in the adaptations that have been made to contemporary archaeological methodologies. Preben Kaarsholm writes that both colonial and black nationalist groups invoked Great Zimbabwe's past to support <b>their</b> <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> the country's present, through the media of popular history and of fiction. Examples of such popular history include Alexander Wilmot's Monomotapa (Rhodesia) and Ken Mufuka's Dzimbahwe: Life and Politics in the Golden Age; examples from fiction include Wilbur Smith's The Sunbird and Stanlake Samkange's Year of the Uprising.|$|E
25|$|A {{succession}} of controversial political appointments {{to the highest}} offices of the Institutions of the European Union - who have failed to garner favourable public opinion for <b>their</b> <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> the European project and demonstrate leadership required to steer the European project - has resulted in successful electoral challenges to prevent any further devolution of sovereignty from the national parliaments to the Institutions of the European Union in Brussels. European electorates have become deeply suspicious of the democratic deficit, corporate lobbying activities and opacity of political arrangements brokered in Brussels. The transition from authoritarian rule to libertarian democracy has not been fully completed by Eastern European countries and is affecting the elimination of corruption & nepotism, religious & ethnic tolerance, humanitarian solidarity, respect of human rights, etc.|$|E

25|$|About 10% of the {{population}} of Saskatchewan during 1850–1930 were Irish-born or of Irish origin. Cottrell (1999) examines the social, economic, political, religious, and ideological impact of the Irish diaspora on pioneer society and suggests that both individually and collectively, the Irish were a relatively privileged group. The most visible manifestations of intergenerational Irish ethnicity - the Catholic Church and the Orange Order - served as vehicles for recreating Irish culture on the prairies and as forums for ethnic fusion, which integrated people of Irish origin with settlers of other nationalities. The Irish were thus a vital force for cohesion in an ethnically diverse frontier society, but also a source of major tension with elements that did not share <b>their</b> <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> how the province of Saskatchewan should evolve.|$|E
25|$|The Muslim Brotherhood's reemergence as a {{political}} force coincided {{with the proliferation of}} Islamic groups. Some of these groups espoused the violent overthrow of the government while others espoused living a devout life of rigorous observance of religious practices. It is impossible to list all the Islamic groups that emerged in the late 1970s because many of them had diffuse structures and some of the more militant groups were underground. Egypt's defeat and loss of territory in the June 1967 Six-Day War was the main cause for the growth of religiously inspired political activism. Muslims tended to view the humiliating experience as the culmination of 150 years of foreign intrusion and an affront to <b>their</b> <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> a true Islamic community. Islamic tradition rejected the idea of non-Muslims dominating Muslim society. Such a state of affairs discredited Muslim rulers who permitted it to persist. It was, therefore, incumbent on believers to end the domination and restore the true supremacy of Islam. As part of their Sunni creed, the most radical activists adopted jihad and committed themselves to battling unbelievers and impious Muslims. During the 1970s and 1980s, Islamists perpetrated a number of violent acts, including the assassination of Anwar Sadat in October 1981.|$|E
500|$|Sunset Overdrive was {{developed}} by Insomniac Games, which had mainly developed games for PlayStation consoles. Drew Murray and Marcus Smith, the game's creative directors, began brainstorming Sunset Overdrive {{after the completion of}} Resistance 3 in 2011. They presented their ideas to Insomniac's owners and CEO Ted Price, outlining a project that would borrow influences from the documentary Hyena Men of Kenya, Tank Girl comics, the novel I Am Legend, the British television series The Young Ones, Halloween masks from the 1960s, and Lego. The initial presentation failed to generate interest, but Murray and Smith were asked to come back a week later to explain how the game would actually be played. In their second presentation, they explained <b>their</b> <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> a game featuring fast-paced action that would be [...] "the rock and roll end times". According to Smith this confused some team members who thought that they were making Brütal Legend.|$|E

500|$|Although Sakaguchi's {{previous}} RPGs from Mistwalker {{had been}} released for the Xbox 360, The Last Story was created for the Wii. According to Sakaguchi, this was because Nintendo's Shinji Hatano shared <b>their</b> <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> a role-playing game that did not follow genre conversions, and so Sakaguchi accepted his offer of collaboration. After being contacted regarding both The Last Story and fellow Wii ARPG Xenoblade Chronicles, Hatano said that the games should be made for a wide audience and using a [...] "romanticist approach". When explaining why The Last Story was exclusive to the Wii, Sakaguchi {{said that it was}} because {{a large proportion of the}} late development staff, including the testers, came from Nintendo. In a later interview, he said that working with the Wii, which did not use high-definition graphics, presented challenges as some of his ideas could not be implemented due to technical restrictions. Despite this, the team aimed to create a game that would look good when compared to games on high-definition consoles. Matsumoto stated that Nintendo had a strong influence on the game, which did not always sit well with him despite their suggestions ultimately improving the game. He also stated that Nintendo's creative and development aid in fine-tuning the game was the reason for its extended development.|$|E
500|$|On May 23, 2014, Marvel and Wright jointly {{announced}} that Wright {{was leaving the}} project due to [...] "differences in <b>their</b> <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> the film", and that the studio was closing in on a new director. On the split, Wright said, [...] "I {{wanted to make a}} Marvel movie but I don’t think they really wanted to make an Edgar Wright movie." [...] He also added that at one point, Marvel wanted to do a draft of the script without him, which was [...] "a tough thing to move forward" [...] as Wright has written all of the previous films he directed. Wright continued, [...] "Suddenly becoming a director-for-hire on it, you’re sort of less emotionally invested and you start to wonder why you’re there, really." [...] The majority of Wright's crew also left the project {{in the wake of his}} departure. By May 30, Adam McKay had entered negotiations to replace Wright, but pulled out of negotiations the next day.

500|$|In {{contrast}} to the unity of Classical Latin, the literary aesthetic of late antiquity has a tessellated quality that {{has been compared to}} the mosaics characteristic of the period. A continuing interest in the religious traditions of Rome prior to Christian dominion is found into the 5th century, with the Saturnalia of Macrobius and The Marriage of Philology and Mercury of Martianus Capella. Prominent Latin poets of late antiquity include Ausonius, Prudentius, Claudian, and Sidonius. Ausonius (d. ca. 394), the Bordelaise tutor of the emperor Gratian, was at least nominally a Christian, though throughout his occasionally obscene mixed-genre poems, he retains a literary interest in the Greco-Roman gods and even druidism. The imperial panegyrist Claudian (d. 404) was a vir illustris who appears never to have converted. Prudentius (d. ca. 413), born in Hispania Tarraconensis and a fervent Christian, was thoroughly versed in the poets of the Classical tradition, and transforms <b>their</b> <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> poetry as a monument of immortality into an expression of the poet's quest for eternal life culminating in Christian salvation. Sidonius (d. 486), a native of Lugdunum, was a Roman senator and bishop of Clermont who cultivated a traditional villa lifestyle as he watched the Western empire succumb to barbarian incursions. His poetry and collected letters offer a unique view of life in late Roman Gaul {{from the perspective of a}} man who [...] "survived the end of his world".|$|E
