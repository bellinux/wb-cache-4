5|$|From April to September 1982, the Queen {{was anxious}} but {{proud of her}} son, Prince Andrew, who was serving with British forces during the Falklands War. On 9 July, the Queen awoke in her bedroom at Buckingham Palace to find an intruder, Michael Fagan, in <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>with</b> <b>her.</b> In a serious lapse of security, {{assistance}} only arrived after two calls to the Palace police switchboard. After hosting US President Ronald Reagan at Windsor Castle in 1982 and visiting his California ranch in 1983, the Queen was angered when his administration ordered the invasion of Grenada, one of her Caribbean realms, without informing her.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins on}} a city {{sidewalk}} where Scherzinger walks into a telephone booth as several men in black suits pass by the booth. As Scherzinger begins to undress, the men stop to stare as she begins taking off her glasses and shaking her hair back. The video then moves to Scherzinger in a dress walking past four men mopping the floor to a supply closet where she enters and reappears moments later, {{dressed in a black}} body suit with a cape. As the chorus begins, the situation rapidly switches back-and-forth from Scherzinger in her good-girl persona shown fighting escaped jail prisoners dressed in striped suits (and Beagle Boys masks) to Scherzinger in her bad-girl persona fighting with police. As the song progresses, Scherzinger is shown in a classic looking automobile and riding a BMW motorcycle, with a streaking white and black background. Several shots of her bad-girl persona alone in a room with two prisoners are then shown. As the bridge begins, she is shown in her good-girl ego standing by a podium, talking to a group of reporters while waving her hands in the air. As the bridge ends, she brings her hands down, blowing back all of the reporters, who then begin dancing and pumping their arms to the song. The video moves to Scherzinger dancing with the police and prisoners before ending with her blowing away the two men who were in <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> and walking away.|$|E
500|$|When {{he heard}} of Eisenhower's posture, Nixon's {{happiness}} {{at what he}} had finally been convinced was a [...] turned to fury, and he stated that if the speech did not satisfy the general, {{nothing he could do}} would. He called in his secretary, Rose Mary Woods, and dictated a telegram to the RNC resigning from the ticket. As Woods left <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> notes, Chotiner stopped her, took the sheet, and ripped it up. While Chotiner understood Nixon's rage, he felt that the resignation was premature. The campaign manager urged Nixon simply to allow the public wave of support to pressure Eisenhower. He suggested that instead of going to Wheeling as Eisenhower had requested, that they resume the train tour in Missoula, Montana. Nixon sent Eisenhower a curt acknowledgment of his telegram, and a suggestion that they meet the following week in Washington, D.C. Chotiner then called Summerfield, telling him that Nixon felt he had been abused enough, and would not meet with Eisenhower until Summerfield was able to promise, on his word of honor, that the senator would be confirmed as nominee at that meeting.

[...] "I offer you my palace and my crown, and all the riches that are under the earth; and you treat me as if I were doing you an injury.

2500|$|The first {{description}} of Marlborough Mills in Chapter XV is through Margaret's eyes and thoughts, and the omniscient narrator delves {{into the inner}} thoughts of her main characters [...] and occasionally interjects her observations (Bodenheimer, 1979, pp 293–300). Thornton [...] "thought that he disliked seeing one who had mortified him so keenly; but he was mistaken. It was a stinging pleasure to be in <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> ... But he was no great analyser of his own motives, and was mistaken as I have said" [...] (Gaskell, 1855, chapter 29). The narrative sometimes slips into free indirect discourse; Mrs. Thornton silently calls Margaret's embroidery of {{a small piece of}} cambric [...] "flimsy, useless work" [...] when she visits the Hales (Gaskell, 1855, chapter 12).|$|E
2500|$|Mary contemplates her fate, {{and that}} of Leicester also: [...] "I have brought misfortune to all". Talbot and Cecil enter and Cecil tells Mary that he holds her death warrant. After Cecil leaves the room, Talbot informs her that Leicester has been ordered to witness her execution. Beside herself with grief, Mary imagines that the ghost of Lord Darnley is in <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>with</b> <b>her,</b> while Talbot offers comfort (Duet: Quando di luce rosea il giorno a me splendea / [...] "While with the light of dawn my life still sparkled"). However, Talbot then presses her about [...] "one more sin": her [...] "unity with" [...] ("uniti eri") Babington, to which she {{initially}} responds [...] "Ah! be silent; it was a fatal error", but, when he insists, adds that [...] "dying my heart affirms it." ...|$|E

60|$|LORD WINDERMERE. [Rising.] Margaret, if {{you knew}} where Mrs. Erlynne went last night, after she left this house, you would not sit in <b>the</b> same <b>room</b> <b>with</b> <b>her.</b> It was {{absolutely}} shameless, the whole thing.|$|R
60|$|She {{was back}} in an instant, gliding round <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> hunting <b>with</b> <b>her</b> eyes and hands, but she saw nothing, and her heart lightened, for she was terrified of all such things.|$|R

50|$|In 1948, the MLA {{decided to}} {{establish}} an award {{in the name of}} Marcia Crocker Noyes. It was for outstanding achievement in medical library field and was to be awarded every two years, or when a truly worthy candidate was submitted. In 2014, the Faculty began giving a bouquet of flowers to the winner of the award in Marcia's name, and in honor of her work. Much evidence exists for this tradition, as we know that the physicians, especially Drs. Osler and Ruhräh, frequently gave her bouquets of flowers. Marcia also cultivated flower gardens at the Faculty and decorated <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> work.|$|R

50|$|Mrs Ivy Eckdorf, a {{professional}} photographer with two unsuccessful marriages behind her, decides to visit Dublin's O'Neill's Hotel, after hearing {{that there are}} some dark secrets in the closet at the place. The hotel is owned by Mrs Sinnott, a compassionate deaf-and-dumb lady fast approaching her ninety-second year. Her feckless son Eugene, a drunk and gambling addict, spends little on the upkeep of the hotel, and the place has now acquired a reputation as a somewhat seedy establishment: Morrissey, a local pimp, often arranges his clients' rendezvous <b>with</b> prostitutes in <b>the</b> <b>rooms.</b> <b>With</b> <b>her</b> feistiness and indefatigable spirit Mrs Eckdorf budges into the lives of the Sinnott family, O'Neill the hall porter and Father Hennessey, a Catholic priest of the local parish.|$|R
