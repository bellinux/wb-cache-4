5|$|Lesser Roman Catholic prelates use {{a variety}} of colors. Violet hats were once {{actually}} worn by certain monsignors, and so in heraldry they have used a violet hat with red or violet <b>tassels</b> in varying numbers, currently fixed at six on each side. The lowest grade of monsignor, a Chaplain of His Holiness, uses a black hat with violet <b>tassels.</b> The superior general of an order displays a black galero with six <b>tassels</b> on each side, while provincial superiors and abbots use a black galero with six or three <b>tassels</b> on each side, although Norbertines (White Canons) use a white galero. Although a priest would rarely assume arms unless he had an ancestral right to arms independent of his clerical state, a priest would use a simple black ecclesiastical hat with a single tassel on each side. Priests who hold an office such as rector would have two <b>tassels</b> on each side.|$|E
5|$|The {{depiction}} of the galero in arms can vary greatly depending on the artist's style. The top of the hat may be shown flat or round. Sometimes the brim is shown much narrower; with a domed top it can look like a cappello romano with <b>tassels,</b> but in heraldry it is still called a galero. The <b>tassels</b> may be represented as knotted cords.|$|E
5|$|Within Presbyterian Church heraldry, a minister's hat is {{represented}} as black {{with a single}} tassel on each side, sometimes blue, though a doctoral bonnet or Geneva cap may replace the brimmed hat. Clergy of the Chapel Royal display red <b>tassels.</b> The office of moderator does not have corporate arms, but for official occasions, a moderator may add <b>tassels</b> to his personal arms to indicate parity with offices of other churches: three for a moderator of a presbytery, and six for a moderator of a regional synod. The moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland now uses a differenced version of the General Assembly's arms, with a hat having a blue cord and ten <b>tassels</b> on each side, and may also show the moderator's staff, a gold Celtic crosier, behind the shield {{as can be seen}} in vol 41, p 152 of the Scots Public Register.|$|E

5|$|Clergy of the Church of England {{who were}} not bishops {{historically}} bore arms identical to a layman, with a shield, helm and crest, and no ecclesiastical hat. In England in 1976 a system for deans, archdeacons and canons was authorized by the College of Arms, allowing a black ecclesiastical hat, black or violet cords, and three violet or red <b>tassels</b> on each side. A priest uses {{a black and white}} cord with a single tassel on each side, and a deacon a hat without <b>tassels.</b> A Doctor of Divinity may have cords interwoven with red and a hat appropriate to the degree, and members of the Ecclesiastical Household add a Tudor rose {{on the front of the}} hat. According to Boutell's Heraldry, this system represents the practice of the Church in England in the 16th century.|$|E

40|$|The genetic {{architecture}} of <b>tassel</b> and ear traits was studied by triple test cross design. Fifteen diverse white maize inbred lines (Four local and 11 exotic) viz., WI- 9, W- 6, W- 7, GLET- 7, GLET- 27, CML- 77, CML- 79, CML- 111, CML- 38, CML- 173, CML- 213, CML- 214, CML- 240, CML- 244 and 463 were crossed with three testers W 3, 5 and W 3 x 5. The test crosses were generated in 2004 at winter maize nursery, Amberpet (Hyderabad). The parental lines, testers and crosses were evaluated at two diverse locations of Kashmir valley viz., Larnoo and Wadura in RBD with three replications at each location. Analysis of variance for detection of epistasis revealed significant epistasis {{as well as}} its components for all traits except <b>tassel</b> branch number and ear length for which additive interaction was non-significant. The epistasis as well its components interacted significantly with environment except for <b>tassel</b> length where interaction component was non-significant. The estimates of genetic components of variance revealed that both additive and dominance components were significant for all traits except ear diameter where dominance component was non-significant. The correlation between <b>tassel</b> and ear traits revealed strong correlation between <b>tassel</b> branch number and ear height (0. 72 %) followed by <b>tassel</b> branch number and ear length (0. 548), <b>tassel</b> length and <b>tassel</b> weight (0. 416). Negative correlation was recorded between <b>tassel</b> length and weight with ear length. Selecting for upright <b>tassel</b> branches may compensate for yield reduction without comprising on <b>tassel</b> size to ensure sufficient pollen availability, especially in hybrid seed production and stress environments...|$|R
30|$|There was a {{statistically}} significant (p <  0.01) influence of varieties, P and N on days to 50  % <b>tasseling</b> in all four experiments. Obatanpa variety took more days (i.e. 56  days) to <b>tassel</b> compared to the Dorke variety (i.e. 53  days). The number of days to <b>tasseling</b> significantly (p <  0.01) increased {{by an average of}} 3  days with increased N stress in all experiments. This indicates that maize development and phenology are influenced by N concentration in the soil. The effect of P was similar, delaying <b>tasseling</b> by 1  day when inadequately supplied. No interactive effects of N and P were observed for days to 50  % <b>tasseling,</b> except in Expt. 3. There was early <b>tasseling</b> in Expt. 1 compared to the others. The early <b>tasseling</b> of the maize crop in Expt. 1 compared to the other experiments is attributed to the soil at the location, which was relatively fertile. Similar observations were reported for silking in maize in the semi-arid region of Nigeria by Gungula et al. (2003), <b>tasseling</b> of maize in the transition zone in Ghana by Adiku et al. (2009), flowering in sorghum in semi-arid region of Ghana by Kpongor (2007), and for <b>tasseling</b> in maize across arid to semi-arid regions of Pakistan by Khaliq (2008). The differences in number of days to <b>tasseling</b> between the varieties at a particular N rate suggest that the effect of N stress on phenology differs among varieties even when they are adapted to the same ecological zone (Gungula et al. 2003).|$|R

Milled <b>tassel</b> powder was employed in metal removal from simulated aqueous sample and thereafter, the developed method was applied to environmental samples. Regeneration of metal ions adsorbed on <b>tassel</b> was studied using sodium citrate and nitric acid as leaching agents and Pb(II) as the test metal ion. Surface modification of <b>tassel</b> was carried out with citric and ethylenediaaminetetraacetic acids respectively. Thermodynamic, kinetic, breakthrough and equilibrium studies were conducted using Pb(II) and Cr(VI) as the test metals. The specific surface area, pore volume and width of <b>tassel</b> powder were determined using Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET). The microstructure of <b>tassel</b> was studied using high resolution scanning electron microscopy (HRSEM). Energy dispersive x-ray analysis (EDX), electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA) and x-ray diffraction analysis (XDA) were used to determine elemental composition of <b>tassel</b> powder before and after metal adsorption. Fourier transformed infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR) was employed to identify surface functional groups. The thermal stability of <b>tassel</b> powder was measured in air and nitrogen atmosphere using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The removal of metals from simulated and environmental samples by <b>tassel</b> was found to be dependent on pH, ionic strength and levels of other competing species. The regeneration of metal ions from <b>tassel</b> showed that for samples with concentrations of 100 mg/L Pb, 94 - 98 % was adsorbed and 57 - 74 % and 57 - 67 % recoveries were achieved with 0. 5 - 5. 0 M nitric acid and 0. 01 - 0. 2 M sodium citrate as stripping solutions, respectively. The Freundlich, R 2 (0. 972) model was found to describe the sorption isotherm of Pb(II) on <b>tassel</b> better than the Langmuir, R 2 (0. 957) ...|$|R

5|$|The three Kings of Arms {{have also}} been {{entitled}} to wear a crown since the 13th century. However, {{it was not until}} much later that the specific design of the crown was regulated. The silver-gilt crown is composed of sixteen acanthus leaves alternating in height, inscribed with a line from Psalm 51 in Latin: Miserere mei Deus secundum magnam misericordiam tuam (translated: Have mercy on me O God according to Thy great mercy). Within the crown is a cap of crimson velvet, lined with ermine, having at the top a large tuft of <b>tassels,</b> wrought in gold. In medieval times the king of arms were required to wear their crowns and attend to the Sovereign on four high feasts of the year: Christmas, Easter, Whitsuntide and All Saint's Day. Today, the crown is reserved for the most solemn of occasions. The last time these crowns were worn was at the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953. At other times, kings of arms wear a black bicorne trimmed with white ostrich feathers when performing duties outdoors, or a black velvet cap, depending on circumstances of occasion.|$|E
