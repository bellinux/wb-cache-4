[...] Ed Koch elevated his criticisms of the campaign, calling it [...] "fraudulent" [...] and arguing that Trump is the [...] "greatest con artist in the world {{when it comes to}} trumpeting his own name [...] [...] [...] [...] y gut <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> knows nothing [...]" [...] Former White House adviser Dick Morris said [...] "I think he's mainly selling books." [...] Republican strategist Ed Rollins questioned whether Trump could [...] "say the right things" [...] or [...] "be willing to let somebody put an organization together." [...] A New York Daily News/WNBC-TV poll showed that 74% of New Yorkers believed the campaign was being used only for Trump [...] "to promote himself." [...] Roger Stone commented that the perception problem would [...] "solve itself" [...] once the campaign would reveal the number of petition signatures it collected. [...] By mid-November, the campaign started receiving advice from political consultant Douglas Friedline, who ran Ventura's successful 1998 gubernatorial campaign. [...] Upon Friedline's advice, Trump assembled communications and campaign staff, and began planning events in strategic states. As a further step in organization, Trump set up a campaign website at the domain www.donaldjtrump2000.com and used Ventura's webmaster, Phil Madsen, to create an online community of supporters.|$|E
