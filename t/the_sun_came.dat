5|$|The {{team had}} a short time for finalizing the {{different}} aspects of the shoot, including rehearsing the whole sequence. They also had just one night to complete shooting and due to the casual nature of the song, decided to invite Madonna's close friends and family to be in it. Contrary to normal shooting schedules, the team had to work fast before <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>came</b> up, since they were portraying a party at night. Following the choreography, every person on set had cues about their position and where their part would come in the shooting. A number of designers contributed clothing for the singer to wear, including Moschino, Discount Universe, SSUR, Chanel, Majesty Black and shoes by Giuseppe Zanotti. According to Amber Kallor from Style.com, various contemporary fashion trends appeared in the video, including candy-colored hairs, black lips, white bows and glitter eye makeup.|$|E

25|$|The Groundhog Day celebration {{is rooted}} in a Celtic and Germanic {{tradition}} that says that if a hibernating animal casts a shadow on February 2, the Pagan holiday of Imbolc (known among Christians as Candlemas), winter and cold weather will last another six weeks. If no shadow is seen, legend says, spring will come early. In Germany, the tradition evolved into a myth that if <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>came</b> out on Candlemas, a hedgehog would cast its shadow, predicting snow {{all the way into}} May. When German immigrants settled in Pennsylvania, they transferred the tradition onto local fauna, replacing hedgehogs with groundhogs.|$|E
25|$|The Sun {{stumbled}} out of {{the gate}} in 2007, posting a dismal 5–10 record by late June. However, the Sun stormed back into playoff contention by winning 11 of their next 13 games, to finish the regular-season at 18–16, good enough to win the #3 seed in the Eastern Conference. In the playoffs, the Sun faced the Indiana Fever in the first round. <b>The</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>came</b> into the series having won all four regular-season contests against the Fever. In Game 1, despite holding a 17-point lead in the third quarter, the Sun allowed the Fever to force the first triple-overtime game in WNBA playoff history, ending with a 93–88 victory for the Sun. However, the Fever would respond by winning the next two games and therefore the series, including a playoff record 22-point come-from-behind win in Game 3.|$|E
25|$|According to Māori mythology, Taranaki once {{resided in}} the middle of the North Island, with all the other New Zealand volcanoes. The {{beautiful}} Pihanga was coveted by all the mountains, and a great battle broke out between them. Tongariro eventually won the day, inflicted great wounds on the side of Taranaki, and causing him to flee. Taranaki headed westwards, following Te Toka a Rahotu (the Rock of Rahotu) and forming the deep gorges of the Whanganui River, paused for a while, creating the depression that formed the Te Ngaere swamp, then heading north. Further progress was blocked by the Pouakai ranges, and as <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>came</b> up Taranaki became petrified in his current location. When Taranaki conceals himself with rainclouds, he is said to be crying for his lost love, and during spectacular sunsets, he is said to be displaying himself to her. In turn, Tongariro's eruptions are said to be a warning to Taranaki not to return.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>came</b> {{into the}} 2010 WNBA Draft with two picks {{in the first}} round – the first and seventh overall picks, the latter of which was {{acquired}} one day prior to the draft from Tulsa. With its first overall selection in franchise history, the Sun took UConn standout and Player of the Year recipient, Tina Charles, the consensus top prospect available. By playing alongside premier talent at the collegiate level, Charles had shown that she was ready to pilot an offense and lead this franchise into the post-Sales era. After the selection of Charles, Thibault had the remainder of the draft to fortify the weapons around his newly acquired center. To diminish the losses of Amber Holt and Chante Black, both of whom were part of the package deal with the Shock, the Sun selected Kansas product Danielle McCray. Prior to the draft, it was understood that McCray wouldn't be available to participate in the upcoming season due to an ACL injury she sustained in college. There was risk involved concerning her durability, but McCray's potential as a superstar was reason enough to take the leap of faith. The Sun cemented its guard corps with the selection of Allison Hightower in the second round. Thibault wasn't finished making a mark on draft day as he maneuvered around the draft board to address the Sun's suspect defense. He nabbed former Cornhusker Kelsey Griffin, who was taken third overall, in a trade once again involving the Lynx. This trade would have the Sun relinquishing their first and second round picks in next year's draft. The acquisition of coveted players through the draft and free agency capped an offseason of change that had transformed a franchise for the future. Although the reconstruction of the Sun remained a work in progress, this talented class of prospects would serve as the foundation for a team that jumped back into contention quicker than anyone anticipated.|$|E

Masley concluded his review by writing that the song sounds [...] "a whole lot" [...] like Far East Movement's [...] "Like a G6".

500|$|In contrast, Australia batted {{much more}} fluently as the {{overcast}} skies cleared and <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>came</b> out. Australia had reached 100 at 17:30 with Barnes on 52 and Morris on 47. The score had reached 117 before Barnes was removed by Hollies for 61. This brought Bradman to the crease shortly before 18:00, {{late on the}} first day. As Bradman had announced that the tour was his last at international level, the innings {{would be his last}} at Test level if Australia batted only once. The crowd gave him a standing ovation as he walked out to bat. Yardley led the Englishmen in giving his Australian counterpart three cheers before shaking Bradman's hand. With 6996 Test career runs, he only needed four runs to average 100 in Test cricket. [...] Bradman took guard and played the first ball from Hollies from the back foot. Hollies pitched the next ball up, bowling Bradman for a duck with a googly that went between bat and pad as the batsman leaned forward. Bradman appeared stunned by what had happened and slowly turned around and walked back to the pavilion, receiving another large round of applause. Australia went on to make 389 and then bowled England out for 188 to win by an innings and 149 runs.|$|E

500|$|In contrast, Australia batted with ease, as the {{overcast}} skies {{cleared and}} <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>came</b> out. Morris and Barnes passed England's first innings total by themselves, taking {{less than an}} hour to push the Australians into the lead. O’Reilly felt the Australian openers wanted to prove [...] "the pitch itself had nothing whatever to do with the English batting debacle". The only chance came when Barnes powerfully square cut Bedser low to point, where Young spilled the catch. When Young came on to bowl, his finger spin was expected to trouble the batsmen on a rain-affected surface, but he delivered little variation in pace and trajectory and Barnes in particular hit him repeatedly through the off side field. Australia reached 100 at 17:30, with Barnes on 52 and Morris on 47. They took the score to 117 before Barnes was caught behind from Eric Hollies for 61, ending a 126-minute stand. Barnes stumbled forward to a fast-turning leg break that caught his outside edge. He had overbalanced and would have been stumped if he had failed to make contact with the ball. Australia finished at 389 on the second day and bowled out the hosts for 188 in the second innings, sealing victory by an innings and 149 runs to complete a 4–0 series win.|$|E
500|$|While {{reviewing}} The Night <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>Came</b> Up, Slant Magazine critic Sal Cinquemani {{named the}} song the album's best track. He pointed out that, unlike {{the rest of}} the album, [...] "In the Dark" [...] avoids [...] "too-aggressive beats and chintzy synths" [...] and instead relies on Dev's [...] "ooh la la" [...] hook and the [...] "sleek" [...] saxophone line. Cinquemani concluded by writing that the song is [...] "almost enough to forgive [...] for 'Like a G6'." [...] Tris McCall of The Star-Ledger named [...] "In the Dark" [...] the [...] "Song of the Week" [...] and compared its saxophone line to Alexandra Stan's [...] "Mr. Saxobeat", and said that while the latter is [...] "total Euroschlock", [...] "In the Dark" [...] preserves [...] "some of the mechanized detachment" [...] of Dev's song [...] "Booty Bounce" [...] (2010). McCall was mixed regarding [...] "In the Dark"'s lyrical content and called the line [...] "do your work on me/Open up my body and do some surgery" [...] the [...] "grossest pillow talk" [...] since The Black Eyed Peas' [...] "My Humps". Writing for the Dallas Observer, Shahryar Rizvi was negative in his review of the song and criticized the [...] "cheesy" [...] saxophone sound, saying that it [...] "serves well to show just how mediocre this song is". LA Weekly writer Shea Serrano regarded the song as [...] "predictable" [...] and dismissed the metaphors, labeling them [...] "confusing".|$|E

In the United Kingdom, [...] "In the Dark" [...] was released in a digital extended play (EP) alongside three remixes of the track {{as well as its}} music video. Rapper Flo Rida is featured on an official remix of the song, and Dev stated that she wanted to make a remix as it would be refreshing and [...] "great for radio". She explained that a rapper would suit the song well and that she would enjoy the remix when hearing it on the radio. She elaborated on choosing Flo Rida, saying: [...] "We went in thinking about who would be cool on the radio and who would fit the fact that it's kind of a flavorful song and not really a hood rap song. Flo Rida fit, and he completely killed it." [...] 50 Cent is featured on another remix of the track, which he recorded at Sonic Vista Studios Ibiza (Spain) in August 2011, while Kanye West appears on an unofficial remix, of which Dev said: [...] "That was just kind of something that floated onto the Internet and the airwaves, which I don't mind at all because it sounds absolutely amazing and it's one of my favorite remixes too." ...|$|E
