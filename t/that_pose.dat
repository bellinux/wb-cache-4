5|$|Devil Daggers is {{a shooter}} video game with {{gameplay}} experienced from a first-person perspective. The {{goal of the}} game is to kill demonic enemies and survive for as long as possible. Devil Daggers opens with the player character standing in a shadowy room; in front of them is a floating dagger illuminated by a spotlight. Upon retrieving the dagger, the player is transported to a flat, floating platform arena cloaked in darkness. In the arena, demonic enemies begin spawning. Initially, a series of tentacled, towering creatures spawn and start releasing swarms of flying skulls that pursue the player. As time progresses, more exotic creatures <b>that</b> <b>pose</b> a greater threat and exhibit different behaviour begin to appear. Each enemy makes a unique and continuous noise, so that the player is able to recognise what type of enemy is approaching them.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{its history}} of {{generating}} great earthquakes (1857, 1906) {{the focal point}} of earthquake hazard assessment in California has been the strike-slip San Andreas System of faults. However, a system of faults, including the Sierra Madre–Cucamonga Fault System that runs along the border of the San Gabriel and San Fernando Valleys, has also caused a series of moderate to large events in the Greater Los Angeles Area. The westernmost portion of this fault system ruptured in 1971 and has been identified as one of six major fault systems <b>that</b> <b>pose</b> a threat to the highly populated region.|$|E

5|$|More violent eruptions are {{possible}} only in unique circumstances, {{such as an}} eruption into a lake. Any future eruption {{is most likely to}} affect only a limited area downslope from the volcano. Poisonous substances, such as volcanic gas, includes a variety of substances. These include gases trapped in cavities (vesicles) in volcanic rocks, dissolved or dissoclated gases in magma and lava, or gases emanating directly from lava or indirectly through ground water heated by volcanic action. The volcanic gases <b>that</b> <b>pose</b> the greatest potential hazard to people, animals, agriculture, and property are sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide and hydrogen fluoride.

5|$|NHL {{broadcaster}} Darren Eliot {{attributes the}} {{apparent lack of}} playoff success to the different style of competition compared to the regular season: instead of playing different teams every night, {{the goal is to}} advance through four best-of-seven playoff series. The Presidents' Trophy winner may have to go through other playoff clubs who might have a hotter goaltender, a better defensive team or other players <b>that</b> <b>pose</b> match-up problems. If the regular-season champion's primary success was merely outscoring others, they may be out of luck facing goaltenders that can shut them out. The lack of playoff experience may have been to blame in the examples of the 1999–2000 St. Louis Blues and 2008–09 San Jose Sharks, as neither team had advanced past the second round for five or more seasons. Teams have often given up pursuit of finishing first in the League in order to avoid injuries and rest key players for the postseason.|$|E
5|$|Volcanic gas {{includes}} {{a variety of}} substances. These include gases trapped in cavities (vesicles) in volcanic rocks, dissolved or dissociated gases in magma and lava, or gases emanating directly from lava or indirectly through ground water heated by volcanic action. The volcanic gases <b>that</b> <b>pose</b> the greatest potential hazard to people, animals, agriculture, and property are sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide and hydrogen fluoride. Locally, sulfur dioxide gas can lead to acid rain and air pollution downwind from the volcano. Globally, large explosive eruptions that inject a tremendous volume of sulfur aerosols into the stratosphere can lead to lower surface temperatures and promote weakening of the Earth's ozone layer. Because carbon dioxide gas is heavier than air, the gas may flow into low-lying areas and collect in the soil. The concentration of carbon dioxide gas in these areas can be lethal to people, animals, and vegetation.|$|E

5|$|The forest {{maintains}} a full-time fire staff throughout the summer, {{not only to}} control and extinguish fires <b>that</b> <b>pose</b> threats to people and structures but also to set controlled burns. Their jobs include maintaining {{a high level of}} preparedness, keeping a vigilant lookout for fire activity, responding to reports of fires, maintaining equipment, monitoring weather and relative atmospheric dryness, and preparing daily fire activity reports, which are used to post fire information for visitors and staff. The forest has wildland fire engines, pumps, hand tools and fire hose at its disposal. A helicopter can be summoned quickly, along with support from the South Central Idaho Interagency Dispatch Center, including a team of smokejumpers and air tankers used to provide air support in dropping flame retardant and water. There are small areas around Stanley and Mount Harrison where aerial retardant would not be used {{in the case of a}} fire. The 10-member Sawtooth Helitack crew was established in 1963 and is based at Friedman Memorial Airport in Hailey. In the case of larger fires, the National Interagency Fire Command can quickly mobilize available resources. Only four of the original fire lookout towers remain standing in the forest, but they are no longer in use: Iron Mountain, Horton Peak, Lookout Mountain, and Mount Harrison, which was last fully staffed in 2007. Many of these towers were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps during the Great Depression.|$|E

The generic term, winter storm warning, is used for a combination {{of two or more}} of the following winter weather events; heavy snow, freezing rain, sleet, and strong winds. The National Weather Service has deprecated the Heavy Snow Warning and Sleet Warning products in favor of issuing a Winter Storm Warning for Heavy Snow or a Winter Storm Warning for Heavy Sleet, respectively.|$|E
25|$|Astronauts {{must remain}} alert and {{vigilant}} while operating complicated equipment. Therefore, getting enough sleep {{is a crucial}} factor of mission success. Weightlessness, a confined and isolated environment, and busy schedules coupled with {{the absence of a}} regular 24-hour day make sleep difficult in space. Astronauts typically average only about six hours of sleep each night. Cumulative sleep loss and sleep disruption could lead to performance errors and accidents <b>that</b> <b>pose</b> significant risk to mission success. Sleep and circadian cycles also temporally modulate a broad range of physiological, hormonal, behavioral, and cognitive functions.|$|E
25|$|The World Health Organization (WHO) {{recommends}} that all donated blood {{be tested for}} transfusion transmissible infections.

According to the WHO, 25 countries are not able to screen all donated blood for one or more of: HIV; Hepatitis B; Hepatitis C; or syphilis. One of the main reasons for this is because testing kits are not always available. However the prevalence of transfusion-transmitted infections is much higher in low income countries compared to middle and high income countries.|$|E

25|$|Heavy {{water was}} first {{produced}} in 1932, {{a few months}} after the discovery of deuterium. With the discovery of nuclear fission in late 1938, and the need for a neutron moderator that captured few neutrons, heavy water became a component of early nuclear energy research. Since then, heavy water has been an essential component in some types of reactors, both those that generate power and those designed to produce isotopes for nuclear weapons. These heavy water reactors have the advantage of being able to run on natural uranium without using graphite moderators <b>that</b> <b>pose</b> radiological and dust explosion hazards in the decommissioning phase. Most modern reactors use enriched uranium with ordinary water as the moderator.|$|E
25|$|International relief {{targeted}} at poverty reduction {{could also be}} redirected towards subsidizing renewable energy projects. Because of the integral role that electrification plays in supporting economic and social development, funding of rural electrification {{can be seen as}} core method for addressing poverty. Radios, televisions, telephones, computer networks and computers all rely on an access to electricity. Because information services allow for the proliferation of education resources, funding the electric backbone to such systems has derivative effect on their development. In this way access to communications and education {{plays a major role in}} reducing poverty. Additionally, international efforts that supplies equipment and services rather than money, are more resistant to resource misappropriation issue <b>that</b> <b>pose</b> problems in less stable governments.|$|E
25|$|Activity is {{preferable}} to inactivity because it facilitates well-being on multiple levels. Because of improved general health and prosperity in the older population, remaining active is more feasible now than when this theory was first proposed by Havighurst nearly six decades ago. The activity theory is applicable for a stable, post-industrial society, which offers its older members many opportunities for meaningful participation.Weakness: Some aging persons cannot maintain a middle-aged lifestyle, due to functional limitations, lack of income, or lack {{of a desire to}} do so. Many older adults lack the resources to maintain active roles in society. On the flip side, some elders may insist on continuing activities in late life <b>that</b> <b>pose</b> a danger to themselves and others, such as driving at night with low visual acuity or doing maintenance work to the house while climbing with severely arthritic knees.

25|$|Of the {{estimated}} 200,000 animal species in Australia, about 96% are invertebrates. While {{the full extent}} of invertebrate diversity is uncertain, 90% of insects and molluscs are considered endemic. Invertebrates occupy many ecological niches and are important in all ecosystems as decomposers, pollinators, and food sources. The largest group of invertebrates is the insects, comprising 75% of Australia's known species of animals. The most diverse insect orders are the Coleoptera, with 28,200 species of beetles and weevils, the Lepidoptera with 20,816 species including butterflies and moths, and around 14,800 species of Hymenoptera, including the ants, bees and wasps. Order Diptera, which includes the flies and mosquitoes,comprises 7,786 species. Order Hemiptera, including bugs, aphids and hoppers, comprises 5,650 species; and there are 2,827 species of order Orthoptera, including grasshoppers, crickets and katydids. Introduced species <b>that</b> <b>pose</b> a significant threat to native species include the European wasp, the red fire ant, the yellow crazy ant and feral honeybees which compete with native bees.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the primary}} reasons that {{wildlife}} is seen on airports is an abundance of food. Food resources on airports can be either removed or made less desirable. One of the most abundant food resources found on airports is turfgrass. This grass is planted to reduce runoff, control erosion, absorb jet wash, allow passage of emergency vehicles, and to be aesthetically pleasing (DeVault et al. 2013) However, turfgrass is a preferred food source for species of birds <b>that</b> <b>pose</b> serious risk to aircraft, chiefly the Canada goose (Branta canadensis). Turfgrass planted at airports should be a species that geese do not prefer (e.g. St. Augustine grass) and should be managed {{in such a way}} that reduces its attractiveness to other wildlife such as small rodents and raptors (Commander, Naval Installations Command 2010, DeVault et al. 2013). It has been recommended that turfgrass be maintained at a height of 7-14 inches through regular mowing and fertilization (U.S. Air Force 2004).|$|E
25|$|The {{introduction}} of invasive species, mainly the red fire ant, {{has been known}} to disrupt the beetle’s environment. Shallow caves in which the beetle live are relatively easy to enter and make them vulnerable to invasion of fire ants and other exotic species. Fire ant colonies occur in two different forms: single-queen colonies and multiple-queen colonies. It is the multiple-queen colonies <b>that</b> <b>pose</b> a threat because they occur in very dense concentrations of about 750–5000 mounds per acre. They can enter through the cave entrance or crawl through small holes or cracks and attack the karst species where humans cannot observe. Slow moving adults, nymphs, and eggs are most vulnerable to fire ant predation. More than 50% of the caves observed had fire ants present. This is a large sign that the fire ant has taken over or will eventually take over the habitat. Even if the fire ant does not prey on the beetle it is likely to change the links that are critical in the food chain.|$|E
