25|$|Anti-dsDNA {{antibodies}} {{are highly}} associated with glomerulonephritis in SLE, although some patients with high titers of anti-dsDNA antibodies do not develop renal disease. This {{is most likely}} {{due to the fact}} that anti-dsDNA are a heterogeneous population, some of which have been found not to be pathogenic. Anti-dsDNA antibodies can be present in normal individuals, however these antibodies are usually low avidity IgM isotype. In contrast, pathogenic anti-dsDNA antibodies found in SLE are usually of IgG isotype and show high avidity for dsDNA. One possible mechanism for anti-dsDNA and their role in nephritis is the formation of immune complexes that arise by indirect binding to DNA or nucleosomes that are adhered to <b>the</b> <b>glomerular</b> <b>basement</b> <b>membrane</b> (GBM). Another mechanism is direct binding of antibodies to GBM antigens such as C1q, nucleosomal proteins, heparin sulphate or laminin, which can initiate an inflammatory response by activating complement. They can also be internalised by certain molecules on the GBM cells and cause inflammatory cascades, proliferation and alteration of cellular functions.|$|E
25|$|Anti-double {{stranded}} DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibodies {{are highly}} associated with SLE. They {{are a very}} specific marker for the disease, with some studies quoting nearly 100%. Data on sensitivity ranges from 25–85%. Anti-dsDNA antibody levels, known as titres, correlate with disease activity in SLE; high levels indicate more active lupus. The presence of anti-dsDNA antibodies is also linked with lupus nephritis and there is evidence they are the cause. Some anti-dsDNA antibodies are cross reactive with other antigens found on <b>the</b> <b>glomerular</b> <b>basement</b> <b>membrane</b> (GBM) of the kidney, such as heparan sulphate, collagen IV, fibronectin and laminin. Binding to these antigens within the kidney could cause inflammation and complement fixation, resulting in kidney damage. Presence of high DNA-binding and low C3 levels {{have been shown to}} have extremely high predictive value (94%) for the diagnosis of SLE. It is also possible that the anti-dsDNA antibodies are internalised by cells when they bind membrane antigens and then are displayed on the cell surface. This could promote inflammatory responses by T-cells within the kidney. It {{is important to note that}} not all anti-dsDNA antibodies are associated with lupus nephritis and that other factors can cause this symptom in their absence. The antigen of anti-dsDNA antibodies is double stranded DNA.|$|E

After antibodies against double-stranded DNA appeared in NZB/W mice, the mice were orally administered varying dosages of ACE (100, 200 and 400 [*]mg[*]kg− 1) for 5 consecutive days per week for 12 weeks via gavage. To assess the efficacy of ACE, we measured SLE-associated biochemical and histopathological biomarkers levels of blood urine nitrogen (BUN), blood creatinine, urine protein and urine creatinine and thickness of <b>the</b> kidney <b>glomerular</b> <b>basement</b> <b>membrane</b> by staining with periodic acid-Schiff.

40|$|A form of {{experimental}} allergic glomerulonephritis induced with renal tubular antigen {{has recently been}} advanced {{as a model of}} an autologous immune complex disease (1). This form of immunologically mediated renal disease, first described by Heymann (2) as an autoimmune nephrosis (3, 4), is a chronic progressive membranous glomerulonephritis which exhibits, in common with certain forms of human glomerulonephritis (5, 6), the hallmarks of antigen-antibody complex-induced nephritis, namely: (a) the granular deposition of y- and/ 3 xc-globulins along <b>the</b> <b>glomerular</b> capillary walls (7 - 9); and (b) the appearance of electron-opaque deposits along the subepithelial aspects of <b>the</b> <b>glomerular</b> <b>basement</b> <b>membranes</b> (10). In addition it has been demonstrated that the nephritogenetic antigen(s) is not of glomerular origin (1, 11, 12), but is a renal tubular epithelial (RTE) antigen; and recent studies have suggested its derivation from the brush border cells of the proximal convoluted tubule of the kidney (1).

40|$|Patients with Alport's {{syndrome}} {{develop a}} number of pro-inflammatory cytokine and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) abnormalities that contribute to progressive renal failure. Changes in the composition and structure of <b>the</b> <b>glomerular</b> <b>basement</b> <b>membranes</b> likely alter <b>the</b> biomechanics of cell adhesion and signaling in these patients. To test if enhanced strain on the capillary tuft due to these structural changes contributes to altered gene regulation, we subjected cultured podocytes to cyclic biomechanical strain. There was robust induction of interleukin (IL) - 6, along with MMP- 3, - 9, - 10, and - 14, but not MMP- 2 or - 12 by increased strain. Neutralizing antibodies against IL- 6 attenuated the strain-mediated induction of MMP- 3 and - 10. Alport mice treated with a general inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase (L-NAME) developed significant hypertension and increased IL- 6 and MMP- 3 and - 10 in their glomeruli relative to those of normotensive Alport mice. These hypertensive Alport mice also had elevated proteinuria along with more advanced histological and ultrastructural <b>glomerular</b> <b>basement</b> <b>membrane</b> damage.

40|$|In acute nephrotoxic nephritis, {{polymorphonuclear}} leukocytes (polymorphs) {{accumulated in}} large numbers in the glomeruli in the first 12 hours. The endothelial cells were dislodged by the polymorphs which then came to lie immediately adjacent to <b>the</b> <b>glomerular</b> <b>basement</b> <b>membranes.</b> Ultrastructural changes in neither polymorphs nor <b>basement</b> <b>membranes</b> were observed. Depletion of polymorphs in both rats and rabbits prevented the development of proteinuria. This occurred when doses of nephrotoxic globulin were employed that produced proteinurias {{of as much as}} 1800 mg/kg/ 24 hours in intact rabbits, or enough to yield near maximal immediate proteinuria in intact rats. In addition, measurable glomerular damage was frequently averted until the onset of the secondary stage of NTN. Controls indicated that the polymorph depleted animals exhibited minimal non-specific changes in the blood, that the ability of their vascular beds to react to stimuli was not affected, and that deposition of nephrotoxic antibody and C' in the glomeruli was not inhibited. Elimination of polymorphs from the circulation was only partially effective in preventing glomerular damage when large doses of nephrotoxic globulin were used. This indicated that under these circumstances, a polymorph independent glomerular injury may also take place in first stage nephrotoxic nephritis. An indirect role of C', i. e., the accumulation of polymorphs, in bringing about glomerular injury in first stage nephrotoxic nephritis was apparent.
