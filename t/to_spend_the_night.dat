50|$|A month later, on March 13, 1982, at six o'clock, 12 {{members of}} the army patrol {{accompanied}} by 15 patrols of the Xococ village, entered the community of Río Negro. They went to every house asking for the men, {{but they were not}} in their homes because they used <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> <b>nights</b> in <b>the</b> mountain citing security reasons. The soldiers claimed that they were with the guerrillas. Then they demanded people to leave their homes to participate in a meeting.|$|R

5|$|From Leicester {{the march}} moved to Market Harborough. This {{was one of}} the least {{welcoming}} of all the overnight stops.

On Saturday 24 October the marchers reached Northampton, arriving {{at the same time as}} the blind group.

25|$|Nii Lamptey {{was born}} in Tema, but {{grew up in the}} two biggest Ghanaian cities, Accra and Kumasi. He had a miserable childhood, as his parents abused and {{neglected}} him. His father was an alcoholic who often beat and lashed him and sometimes burnt his body with cigarettes. Lamptey often refused <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> <b>nights</b> home and frequently skipped school, only finding refuge in football. Soon, he began to excel in this sport, despite his alcoholic father heckling him and hurling verbal abuse from the sidelines whenever he watched his son play football.|$|R
6000|$|It was {{probably}} winter time or cool weather when the Swedes built their proud fort {{on the banks}} of that river which they now named [...] "New Swedeland Stream;" [...] but when the warm and pleasant days came on, and it was easy to travel from the interior to the river shore, and when the weather was so mild that it was quite possible <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> <b>nights</b> in <b>the</b> woods without injury, there came an enemy to Fort Elsinburgh which proved far more formidable than the Indians or Dutch.|$|R
5|$|When the Roman fleet reached Africa, {{a council}} was held aboard Belisarius' {{flagship}} (The Vandalic War, I.15), {{where many of}} his officers advocated an immediate attack on Carthage itself, especially since {{it was the only}} fortified city in the Vandal realm, the walls of the other cities having been torn down to prevent a rebellion. Belisarius, however, mindful of the fate of the 468 expedition and wary of an encounter with the Vandal fleet, spoke against it. Thus the army disembarked and built a fortified camp <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> <b>night.</b>|$|E
5|$|Many congregations {{gathered}} in their churches upon hearing {{news of the}} attacks, volunteering <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> there {{to protect them from}} further attacks. The local Catholic leaders demanded a peaceful bandh on 15 September in and around the city of Mangalore, and as a response Catholic traders and transport owners closed their shops and stopped their vehicles. A memorandum was submitted to the district council at 10.30 am, seeking protection for the lives and property of Christians. Prayers were to be held in all the 48 churches of the district on Wednesday, 17 September. On 6 October 2008, some 10,000 people from civil society and religious organisations organised a march to protest against the anti-Christian perpetrators of the attacks.|$|E
5|$|After Debonnaire's {{death in}} 1833, Hesketh-Fleetwood {{immersed}} himself in his development plans. Southport, a town he owned much of, was becoming a popular sea bathing resort, and Hesketh-Fleetwood organised {{the construction of a}} promenade. He was becoming concerned over delays {{on the part of the}} Railway and Port Company and decided to get on with building Fleetwood. He hired his old friend Decimus Burton, who had become a successful architect, and together they discussed what buildings would be required. Hesketh-Fleetwood wanted a church, docks, housing, a gas office, a school and a hotel. Burton agreed that a hotel would be important for passengers <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> before travelling on to Scotland. Because those passengers would be arriving from Euston railway station in London, Hesketh-Fleetwood decided to call the hotel the North Euston Hotel. Burton's plans were ready by 1835.|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} years of Portuguese discoveries and empire-building in the 15th and 16th centuries, {{outbound}} ships usually carried a small number of degredados, to assist in tasks deemed too hazardous or onerous for ordinary crewmen. e.g. upon reaching an unfamiliar shore, a degredado or two were usually landed first to test if the native inhabitants were hostile. After opening contact was made, degredados were often assigned <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> <b>nights</b> in <b>the</b> native town or village (while {{the rest of the crew}} slept aboard ships), to build up trust and collect information. If relations turned hostile, it was degredados who were charged with the dangerous job of carrying negotiating terms between the ships and local rulers.|$|R
5|$|Having {{the largest}} wing-area-to-body-weight ratio of any bird, {{frigatebirds}} are essentially aerial. This {{allows them to}} soar continuously and only rarely flap their wings. One great frigatebird, being tracked by satellite in the Indian Ocean, stayed aloft for two months. They can fly higher than 4,000 meters in freezing conditions. Like swifts they are able <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> on the wing, but they will also return to an island to roost on trees or cliffs. Field observations in the Mozambique Channel found that great frigatebirds could remain on the wing for up to 12 days while foraging. Highly adept, they use their forked tails for steering during flight and make strong deep wing-beats, though not suited to flying by sustained flapping. Frigatebirds bathe and clean themselves in flight by flying low and splashing at the water surface before preening and scratching afterwards. Conversely, frigatebirds do not swim and with their short legs cannot walk well or take off from the sea easily.|$|E
5|$|The first {{target of}} the WSGA was Nate Champion, {{who was at the}} KC Ranch (also known as Kaycee) at that time. They were tasked to perform the {{assassination}} that others had failed to carry out five months before. The group traveled to the ranch late Friday, April 8, 1892, quietly surrounded the buildings, and waited for daybreak. Three men besides Champion were at the KC. Two men who were evidently going <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> on their way through were captured as they emerged from the cabin early that morning to collect water at the nearby Powder River, while the third, Nick Ray, was shot while standing inside the doorway of the cabin. As the gunmen opened fire on the cabin, Champion grabbed the mortally wounded Nick Ray back to the cabin. The latter died hours later, and Champion was left besieged inside the log cabin alone.|$|E
5|$|The hasty {{departure}} from Manchester degenerated into chaos. Mechanical failures {{and a lack}} of space to turn the locomotives meant that the seven trains on the northern track were unable {{to get out of the}} station. Only three carriages—the Duke's among them—managed to leave successfully. At around 6.30pm the Duke arrived in Roby, and went <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> at the Marquess of Salisbury's house at Childwall Hall. Meanwhile, the remaining 24 passenger carriages were eventually lashed together with rope and fastened to the three locomotives which remained usable, which hauled this single long train, carrying around 600 passengers, out of Manchester at a speed of around 5mph (8km/h), further slowed by crowds of people standing on the tracks and by grit and mud settling on the rails.|$|E

The mallards continue their search, flying over Boston landmarks such as Beacon Hill, the Massachusetts State House, and Louisburg Square. The Mallards finally decide on an island in the Charles River. From this island, the Mallards visit a policeman named Michael on the shore, who feeds them peanuts every day.|$|E
5|$|Ukuku: {{clad in a}} dark {{coat and}} a woolen mask, the ukukus (spectacled bear) {{represent}} the role of tricksters; they speak in high-pitched voices, and play pranks, but have the serious responsibility of keeping order among the thousands of pilgrims.

When melted, the water is believed to be medicinal for body and mind. It is used for holy water in the churches during the next year. In Quechua mythology, ukukus are the offspring of a woman and a bear, feared by everyone because of their supernatural strength. In these stories, the ukuku redeems itself by defeating a condenado, a cursed soul, and becoming an exemplary farmer.|$|E
