5|$|Eugene Wigner told {{a similar}} story, {{only with a}} swallow instead of a fly, and says it was Max Born who posed <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>to</b> von Neumann in the 1920s.|$|E
5|$|It was the {{intention}} of legislation concerning the elected President that the initiative to refer <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>to</b> the Tribunal should lie with the Government, and generally not with the President whose recourse was in vetoing the legislation. The Cabinet would advise the President and the matter would then be referred to the Tribunal.|$|E
5|$|The {{argument}} concluded on April 6. Dickerson {{persisted in}} his view {{that there was no}} jurisdiction, but Grier disagreed. The court certified <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>to</b> the Supreme Court by a certificate of division.|$|E

5|$|While {{the right}} to {{maintain}} this action {{in its present form}} is not free from doubt, still, as it is brought in accordance with the view expressed by us on the prior appeal, we think we should adhere to our former decision, and allow <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>to</b> be finally determined by the court of appeals.|$|E
5|$|In {{the third}} round, one {{contestant}} from each team faces {{the same question}} simultaneously. Contestants have their own money countdown, which starts at $1,000 and decreases by $50 per second. The other contestant from each team then faces a more difficult question, with an opening value of $2,500 and decreasing by $100 per second. The host usually reads <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>to</b> the contestants during this round. After this second question, the team that has more money wins and plays the bonus round for $10,000.|$|E
5|$|To {{begin the}} game, a {{category}} is revealed, {{and the three}} teams of three contestants are asked multiple choice questions under that category, with each question having four possible answers. The contestant who buzzes in with the correct answer earns the respective team 100 points; an incorrect answer loses 100 points, and opens up <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>to</b> the other teams. Contestants must {{wait until after the}} host reads the entire question (including the choices) to buzz in.|$|E
60|$|But {{it was not}} so fated. Cauchon at once {{diverted}} <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>to</b> {{other matters}} and hurried the trial quickly to an end.|$|R
50|$|Audio {{computer-assisted}} self-interviewing (audio CASI): The respondent {{operates the}} computer, the computer displays <b>the</b> <b>question</b> on <b>the</b> screen and plays recordings of <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> respondents, who then enters his/her answers.|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> first <b>question</b> <b>to</b> {{address is}} <b>the</b> {{existence}} of zero paths, since {{the feasibility of}} the continuation method lies on this assumption. <b>The</b> second <b>question</b> <b>to</b> address is how to numerically track such zero paths when they exist.|$|R
5|$|Equality under Article 12(1) {{does not}} require that all persons are treated alike, but rather that all persons in like {{situations}} should be treated alike. Similarly, failing to treat differently persons whose situations are significantly different also amounts to inequality. As such, at the second stage <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>to</b> be considered is whether persons falling within the same class are treated equally. Article 12(1) prohibits laws which require that some individuals within a single class should be treated more harshly than others. However, the law is not unconstitutional if all persons discriminated against are equally discriminated against, and all persons not discriminated against are equally not discriminated against. The courts have found this stage to be satisfied where under a statute all citizens are equally liable to prosecution, whereas all non-citizens are equally immune from it. The second stage test was also found to have been satisfied where {{all members of the}} Singapore Congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses found to have been in violation of the Societies Act were treated equally.|$|E
25|$|Audience Poll: The host repeats <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>to</b> {{the studio}} {{audience}}. When requested, the audience must now {{press a button}} {{in front of them}} within ten seconds to indicate which option they think is correct answer. The computer then displays the results as a percentage to help the player make a choice.|$|E
25|$|Lewis had {{originally}} intended only {{to write the}} one Narnia novel, The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. However, when Roger Lancelyn Green asked him how a lamp post came to be standing {{in the midst of}} Narnian woodland, Lewis was intrigued enough by <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>to</b> attempt to find an answer by writing The Magician's Nephew, which features a younger version of Professor Kirke from the first novel.|$|E
30|$|At the {{beginning}} of the discussion, no one intended to start. Candidate C then initiated the discussion by repeating the topic and raised <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>to</b> other two candidates.|$|R
5000|$|Mathis called Myers, Dawkins and Scott a [...] "bunch of hypocrites," [...] {{and said}} that he [...] "went over all of <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> with these folks before the {{interviews}} and I e-mailed <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>to</b> many of them days in advance." ...|$|R
50|$|Interactive voice {{response}} (IVR): The computer plays recordings of <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>to</b> respondents over <b>the</b> telephone, who then respond {{by using the}} keypad of the telephone or speaking their answers aloud.|$|R
25|$|Long-answer {{questions}} in the PSLE worth four or five marks tend to be in two types, a heuristic type of question, which may require students {{to form a new}} theorem, concept or algorithm from pre-existing knowledge to solve the question, although this {{does not have to be}} shown; however a logical statement and evidence connecting <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>to</b> the answer has to be shown to be awarded marks.|$|E
25|$|When {{it comes}} to {{contracts}} where one party disputed whether it had been properly formed, rather than the validity of a formed contract, the Court {{has been willing to}} let a court decide the issue. Justice Stephen Breyer wrote for a unanimous court in First Options v. Kaplan that upheld a district-court decision reversing an arbitration award where it was not clear that the respondents had agreed to submit the arbitrability of <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>to</b> the arbitrator.|$|E
25|$|Several {{papers were}} {{inspired}} by a question of M. Berry (called the Berry–Robbins problem), who asked {{if there is a}} map from the configuration space of n points in 3-space to the flag manifold of the unitary group. Atiyah gave an affirmative answer to this question, but felt his solution was too computational and studied a conjecture that would give a more natural solution. He also related <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>to</b> Nahm's equation, and introduced the Atiyah conjecture on configurations.|$|E
50|$|Cicero had {{a similar}} concept of circumstances. Although Thomas Aquinas {{attributes}} <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>to</b> Cicero, they do not appear in his writings. Similarly, Quintilian discussed loci argumentorum, but did not put them in <b>the</b> form of <b>questions.</b>|$|R

25|$|On February 17, {{the leading}} Tory MPPs held a public meeting to {{protest against the}} measure. George Moffatt was elected {{chairman}} and various public men such as Allan MacNab, Prince, Gugy, Macdonald, Molson, Rose and others gave speeches. The meeting prepared a petition to the governor asking him to dissolve the parliament and call new elections, or to reserve the assent of the bill for the Queen's pleasure, that is to say, to defer <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>to</b> the UK Parliament. The press reported that Lafontaine was burned in effigy that night.|$|E
25|$|Mercati posed <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>to</b> himself, {{why would}} anyone prefer to {{manufacture}} artifacts of stone rather than of metal, a superior material? His answer was that metallurgy was unknown at that time. He cited Biblical passages to prove that in Biblical times stone was the first material used. He also revived the 3-age system of Lucretius, which described a succession of periods based {{on the use of}} stone (and wood), bronze and iron respectively. Due to lateness of publication, Mercati's ideas were already being developed independently; however, his writing served as a further stimulus.|$|E
25|$|Previously, {{under section}} 56A of the Subordinate Courts Act ("SCA"), when a {{constitutional}} question arose in proceedings before the Subordinate Courts, the Courts could refer <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>to</b> the High Court and, meanwhile, stay the proceedings. However, {{this did not}} mean that the Subordinate Courts could not decide constitutional questions at all. In Johari bin Kanadi v. Public Prosecutor (2008), the High Court held that the Subordinate Courts may decide such questions where the relevant constitutional principles have already been set out by superior courts. Where the principles have not been decided, the question should be referred to the High Court.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>questions</b> <b>to</b> which de la Cloche is {{to bring}} answers doubtless {{concerned}} the wish of Charles to be a Catholic secretly, and other arrangements which he {{is known to have}} suggested on another occasion.|$|R
60|$|This, I think, was {{the most}} of the news I got from my friend Loudon; and I hope I was well inspired, and have put all <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>to</b> which you would be curious to hear an answer.|$|R

25|$|At {{the start}} of a typical Question Period, the Speaker recognizes the Leader of the Opposition to ask the lead question. It is {{possible}} for <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>to</b> be asked by a designee of the Leader of the Opposition, yet this Member of Parliament must {{be a member of the}} Official Opposition. Following the answer to the lead question, the lead questioner has two more questions permitted, referred to as supplementary questions. These questions may be asked by the same Member of Parliament to follow up on the answer provided to the lead question, or they may be given to another member of the Official Opposition.|$|E
25|$|Jennings was a {{contestant}} on {{an episode}} of Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader? that aired on October 10, 2008, which held the possibility of exceeding Rutter's total game show winnings. After winning $500,000, enough to surpass Rutter's total, Jennings chose not to attempt the final $1,000,000 question, which would have deducted $475,000 from his winnings if he missed it. As is customary on the show, Jennings was then shown <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>to</b> see what would have happened, and he provided the correct answer. Had he risked his winnings and correctly answered the question, he would have become the show's second $1,000,000 winner.|$|E
25|$|While {{trying to}} color {{a map of}} the {{counties}} of England, Francis Guthrie postulated the four color conjecture, noting that four colors were sufficient to color the map so that no regions sharing a common border received the same color. Guthrie’s brother passed on <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>to</b> his mathematics teacher Augustus de Morgan at University College, who mentioned it in a letter to William Hamilton in 1852. Arthur Cayley raised the problem {{at a meeting of the}} London Mathematical Society in 1879. The same year, Alfred Kempe published a paper that claimed to establish the result, and for a decade the four color problem was considered solved. For his accomplishment Kempe was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society and later President of the London Mathematical Society.|$|E
