25|$|The RSM marches {{around to}} the front of the Escort and, {{followed}} by the Ensign, approaches the Colour Party. Having saluted the colour with his sword, the Sergeant-Major takes it from the Colour Sergeant, freeing him to change and then slope arms. The RSM turns, marches to the Ensign, and presents the colour to him. The Ensign salutes the colour with his sword, sheathes the sword without <b>taking</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> off the colour, and takes possession of it.|$|E
60|$|Melbury nodded an affirmative, without <b>taking</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> off the candle.|$|E
60|$|Mr. d'Alcacer, without <b>taking</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> off them, bent {{low over}} the deck chair.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Whitredge," [...] said Mr. Vane, slowly, without <b>taking</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> {{from the}} senator's, [...] "and it won't be until this {{convention}} is over. Do you understand?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is annoying," [...] said Denton, without <b>taking</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> off the brutes before him. [...] "Of {{course the}} shepherds won't {{come out of}} the city for hours yet. Naturally these dogs don't quite make us out." ...|$|R
6000|$|He took a {{long and}} careful look at the {{stranger}} without speaking for a while. By-and-by he said, without <b>taking</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> from the glass, and as though speaking half to himself, [...] "She's making way against the current somehow or other." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "On which ground?" [...] Bartley asked, drily, without <b>taking</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> from {{a distant}} peak that showed through the notch in the forest.|$|E
60|$|There {{was silence}} for a space, in which the man, never <b>taking</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> from her, {{studying}} her, was making up his mind.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Mr. Dockwrath, not <b>taking</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> {{from off}} the Leeds and Halifax Chronicle. [...] "It is coldish. Waiter, {{bring me a}} cigar." ...|$|E
60|$|Then {{the almost}} equally silent Horne Fisher {{suddenly}} spoke, without <b>taking</b> <b>his</b> brooding <b>eyes</b> off the fire.|$|R
60|$|Though {{he spoke}} not a word, Jarl was long in <b>taking</b> leave. <b>His</b> <b>eyes</b> seemed to say, I {{will see you}} no more.|$|R
5000|$|He will {{perhaps be}} best {{remembered as a}} [...] "super-sub", having earned wide acclaim for a habit of coming into matches late on as a {{substitute}} and scoring goals. Alex Ferguson remarked that Solskjær has a knack of {{sitting on the bench}} and studying the game without <b>taking</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> off the action. Reflecting on this aspect of his career years later, Solskjær said: [...] "I had to think about myself, how can I do the most damage for the opposition if I come on? I sat there and I studied football games but I didn't exactly analyse their strikers. ... Instead I would pay attention to what the defenders and full-backs were doing wrong." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A-sparkling {{all over}} here," [...] says Jo, rubbing {{the fingers of}} his left hand on the {{knuckles}} of his right without <b>taking</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> from the figure.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have known}} it these two hours," [...] said a grey-headed gentleman, {{speaking}} without <b>taking</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> off the newspaper. [...] "There is a cabinet sitting now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Here is Miss Eyre, sir," [...] said Mrs. Fairfax, in {{her quiet}} way. He bowed, still not <b>taking</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> {{from the group}} of the dog and child.|$|E
6000|$|The {{stranger}} nodded, and {{the play}} went on, no further word being spoken till the fourth act was reached, when the stranger again said, without <b>taking</b> <b>his</b> narrow black <b>eyes</b> from the stage: 'There's something in that love-making between Stancy and Power that's not all sham!' ...|$|R
50|$|The team hopes their {{psychogenic}} wave will {{be strong}} enough to destroy Garimoth's evil henchman, the notorious Gil-Berg, who has sworn by the <b>taking</b> of <b>his</b> right <b>eye</b> to utterly destroy the Dangaioh team. Along with the threat of Gil-Berg, the Dangaioh team must also avoid falling foul of Garimoth's trickery, which finds weakness in their forgotten pasts.|$|R
60|$|Within, it {{was hung}} round with pots and pans; {{and on one}} side was a little looking-glass, {{where he used to}} shave; and on a small shelf were his shaving tools, and a comb and brush. Fronting the stove, and very close to it, was a sort of narrow shelf, where he used to sit with his legs spread out very wide, to keep them from scorching; and there, with his book in one hand, and a pewter spoon in the other, he sat all that Sunday morning, {{stirring}} up his pots, and studying away at the same time; seldom <b>taking</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> off the page. Reading must have been very hard work for him; for he muttered to himself quite loud as he read; and big drops of sweat would stand upon his brow, and roll off, till they hissed on the hot stove before him. But on the day I speak of, it was no wonder that he got perplexed, for he was reading a mysterious passage in the Book of Chronicles. Being aware that I knew how to read, he called me as I was passing his premises, and read the passage over, demanding an explanation. I told him it was a mystery that no one could explain; not even a parson. But this did not satisfy him, and I left him poring over it still.|$|R
6000|$|... "Who {{breaks the}} Law--" [...] said Moreau, <b>taking</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> off his victim, and turning towards us (it {{seemed to me}} there was a touch of exultation in his voice).|$|E
60|$|Without <b>taking</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> {{from her}} face, {{he pulled the}} knife out of its sheath--a short, broad, cruel {{double-edged}} blade with a bone handle--and only then looked down at it.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't quite know, ma'am,' said Oliver, without <b>taking</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> {{from the}} canvas; 'I have seen so few that I hardly know. What a beautiful, mild face that lady's is!' ...|$|E
60|$|Its force {{lies not}} in single elements, but in that {{combination}} of an ardent interest in human improvement with a reasoned attention {{to the law of}} its conditions, which alone deserves to be honoured with the high name of wisdom. This completeness was one of the secrets of Mr. Mill's peculiar attraction for young men, and for the comparatively few women whose intellectual interest was strong enough to draw them to his books. He satisfied the ingenuous moral ardour which is instinctive in the best natures, until the dust of daily life dulls or extinguishes it, {{and at the same time}} he satisfied the rationalistic qualities, which are not less marked in the youthful temperament of those who by and by do the work of the world. This mixture of intellectual gravity with a passionate love of improvement in all the aims and instruments of life, made many intelligences alive who would otherwise have slumbered, or sunk either into a dry pedantry on the one hand, or a windy, mischievous philanthropy on the other. He showed himself so wholly free from the vulgarity of the sage. He could hope for the future without <b>taking</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> from the realities of the present. He recognised the social destination of knowledge, and kept the elevation of the great art of social existence ever before him, as the ultimate end of all speculative activity.|$|R
6000|$|... "So you shall, my lad," [...] he cried, <b>taking</b> <b>his</b> snuff and <b>eying</b> me with pleasure. [...] "I {{am glad to}} see, Richard, {{that you}} have none of Mr. Marmaduke's {{nonsense}} about you. She is a good girl, i' faith, {{and more of a}} lady now than many who call themselves such. And you shall have your present to boot. Hark'ee, Daniel," [...] said he to the captain; [...] "if the child comes to my house, the poll-parrots and follow-me-ups will be wanting her, too." ...|$|R
5000|$|Two {{critics of}} Kelsen in the United States were the legal realist Karl Llewellyn and the jurist Harold Laski. Llewellyn, as a firm anti-positivist against Kelsen stated, [...] "I see Kelsen's work as utterly sterile, save in {{by-products}} {{that derive from}} <b>his</b> <b>taking</b> <b>his</b> shrewd <b>eyes,</b> for a moment, off {{what he thinks of}} as 'pure law.'" [...] In his democracy essay of 1955, Kelsen took up the defense of representative democracy made by Joseph Schumpeter in Schumpeter's book on democracy and capitalism. Although Schumpeter took a position unexpectedly favorable to socialism, Kelsen felt that a rehabilitation of the reading of Schumpeter's book more amicable to democracy could be defended and he quoted Schumpter's strong conviction that, to [...] "realize the relative validity of one's convictions and yet stand for them unflinchingly," [...] as consistent with his own defense of democracy. Kelsen himself made mixed statements concerning the extensiveness of the greater or lesser strict association of democracy and capitalism.|$|R
6000|$|... "I sure did," [...] he answered, never <b>taking</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> from her, {{amazed at}} the {{fairness}} and delicacy of her. [...] "How long was you holdin' that contraption up over me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|For {{some moments}} Ralph did not speak. He was evidently stunned. Presently he recovered, and, passing {{his hand over}} his brow, but never <b>taking</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> off the {{handsome}} face of his former friend, he said in a low tone-- ...|$|E
6000|$|Both {{the woman}} and the warrior stood {{together}} in silence for some time. At length, without <b>taking</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> from the dusky, irregular mass before him, which was all that night now left visible of the ill-fated city, Hermanric addressed Goisvintha thus:-- ...|$|E
60|$|Ned opened <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> in amazement, and, <b>taking</b> <b>his</b> excited comrade {{apart from}} the crowd, asked how he had come by so much money.|$|R
60|$|He had {{proceeded}} {{about fifty}} {{yards or so}} when, just as he turned a winding in the path, he found himself {{face to face with}} an old buffalo-bull, fast asleep, and lying down not ten yards off. To drop on one knee and level his piece was the work of an instant, but unfortunately he snapped a dry twig in doing so. The eyes of the huge brute opened instantly, and he had half risen before the loud report of the gun rang through the thicket. Leaping up, Tom Brown took advantage of the smoke to run back a few yards and spring behind a bush, where he waited to observe the result of his shot. It was more tremendous then he had expected. A crash on his right told him that another, and unsuspected, denizen of the thicket had been scared from his lair, while the one he had fired at was on his legs snuffing the air for his enemy. Evidently the wind had been favourable, for immediately he made a dead-set and charged right through the bush behind which our hero was concealed. Tom leaped on one side; the buffalo-bull turned short round and made another dash at him. There was only the remnant of the shattered bush between the two; the buffalo stood for a few seconds eyeing him furiously, the blood streaming down its face from a bullet-hole between the two eyes, and its head garnished with a torn mass of the bush. Again it charged, and again Tom, unable to get a favourable chance for his second barrel, leaped aside and evaded it with difficulty. The bush was now trampled down, and scarcely formed a shadow of a screen between them; nevertheless Tom stood his ground, hoping to get a shot at the bull's side, and never for a single instant <b>taking</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> off him. Once more he charged, and again our hero escaped. He did not venture, however, to stand another, but turned and fled, closely followed by the infuriated animal.|$|R
6000|$|... "Go and enchant Colonel Post," [...] {{said the}} general, without <b>taking</b> <b>his</b> field-glass from <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> [...] "and {{tell him to}} pitch in {{as soon as he}} hears Smith's guns." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Gandara, {{you are not}} drinking," [...] {{said one}} of the gauchos, turning to him. He shook his head {{slightly}} without speaking or <b>taking</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> off my face; whereupon the man who had spoken smiled and resumed his conversation with the others.|$|E
60|$|Having got {{upon his}} feet to emphasise his {{concluding}} words, Young John sat down again, and fell to rolling his green packet on his right leg; never <b>taking</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> off Clennam, but surveying him with a fixed look of indignant reproach.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{can do as}} you like, my dear," [...] Colonel Askerton {{had said}} on the {{previous}} evening to his wife. He had listened to all she had been saying without <b>taking</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> from off his newspaper, though she had spoken with much eagerness.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Of a surety,' {{said the}} Dominie, <b>taking</b> <b>his</b> blue-checqued {{handkerchief}} from <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> 'that was a bitter day with me indeed; ay, {{and a day}} of grief hard to be borne; but He giveth strength who layeth on the load.' ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>Taking</b> <b>his</b> {{hands from}} the seat, and placing {{one of them}} within the other, as he settled himself on one leg, Mr. Littimer proceeded, with <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> cast down, and his respectable head a little advanced, and a little on one side: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's a fair do," [...] said Mr. Thomas Marvel, sitting up, <b>taking</b> <b>his</b> wounded toe in {{hand and}} fixing <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> on the third missile. [...] "I don't {{understand}} it. Stones flinging themselves. Stones talking. Put yourself down. Rot away. I'm done." ...|$|R
