Theirs was a secret conspiracy – ours is a public one. They had not learned the charm of open, honest, outspoken resistance to oppression and through their secret organization you wrought their ruin – we defy you, and all the informers and detectives that British corruption ever bred. No espionage can <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>more</b> than we will proclaim once {{a week on the}} house-tops. If you desire to have a Castle detective employed about the United Irishman office in Trinity Street I shall make no objection, provided the man be sober and honest. If Sir George Grey or Sir William Somerville would like to read our correspondence, we make him welcome for the present – only let the letters be forwarded without losing a post. So that you see we get rid of the whole crew of informers at once." ...|$|E

5000|$|Today, {{the use of}} {{correlations}} {{instead of}} discrepancy scores to measure accuracy {{and the development of}} the Big Five model of personality have overcome Cronbach's criticisms and led to a wave of new research [...] People more accurately perceive extraversion and conscientiousness in strangers than they do the other personality domains.
