5|$|North Somerset {{constitutes}} part of {{the ceremonial}} county of Somerset. As a unitary authority, North Somerset is administered independently of the non-metropolitan county of Somerset. Its administrative headquarters {{are located in the}} town hall of Weston-super-Mare. North Somerset includes areas <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>once</b> part of Somerset before the creation of Avon in 1974.|$|E
5|$|Populations {{of large}} land mammals such as caribou, moose, deer, elk, have been declining {{dramatically}} since the reintroduction of wolves. Species almost entirely gone <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>once</b> {{common in the}} area include the white-tailed jackrabbit, pygmy short-horned lizard, band-tailed pigeon and passenger pigeon. After exploitation of the Kootenay basin by fur trappers, the beaver population was nearly exterminated as well.|$|E

50|$|The name Creil {{comes from}} {{the name of a}} former village <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>once</b> on the coast of the Zuiderzee, which was in turn named after the Creil Woods <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>once</b> located {{northeast}} of North-Holland, in what is now the IJsselmeer, roughly between Texel and Enkhuizen.|$|R

5|$|The British Judicial Committee of the Privy Council still {{serves as}} the highest court of appeal for several former colonies in the Caribbean and Pacific. British Protestant missionaries who {{travelled}} around the globe often in advance of soldiers and civil servants spread the Anglican Communion to all continents. British colonial architecture, such as in churches, railway stations and government buildings, {{can be seen in}} many cities <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>once</b> part of the British Empire.|$|E
5|$|Though the {{urbanisation}} of Gateshead {{around it}} has detracted from the panoramic views of western Gateshead <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>once</b> enjoyed by residents, at elevated positions views of Lobley Hill, Team Valley and Dunston Hill can be glimpsed. Although now {{a suburb of}} the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead, the openness and greenspace prevalent in Low Fell means that the suburb continues to enjoy a rural feel, which is an unusual trait in the modern Gatshead conurbation.|$|E
5|$|French cuisine was codified in the 20th {{century by}} Auguste Escoffier {{to become the}} modern haute cuisine; Escoffier, however, left out much of the local culinary {{character}} {{to be found in}} the regions of France and was considered difficult to execute by home cooks. Gastro-tourism and the Guide Michelin helped to acquaint people with the rich bourgeois and peasant cuisine of the French countryside starting in the 20th century. Gascon cuisine has also had great influence over the cuisine in the southwest of France. Many dishes <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>once</b> regional have proliferated in variations across the country.|$|E

5|$|In 2000, paleontologists Adam Yates and Anne Warren {{produced}} a revised phylogeny of more derived temnospondyls, naming several new clades. Two major clades were Euskelia and Limnarchia. Euskelia includes the temnospondyls <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>once</b> called rhachitomes and includes two subfamilies, the Dissorophoidea and the Eryopoidea. Dissorophoids include small, mostly terrestrial temnospondyls {{that may be}} the ancestors of modern amphibians. Eryopoids include larger temnospondyls like Eryops. The second major clade, Limnarchia, includes most Mesozoic temnospondyls, as well as some Permian groups. Within Limnarchia are the superfamily Archegosauroidea and the most derived temnospondyls, the stereospondyls.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} half of the 17th century a rising cost of {{consumable}} goods and a series of bad harvests brought about economic changes in Glamorgan. Those with enough wealth were able to seize on opportunities created by these unsettled conditions and set about enlarging and enclosing farm lands. The enclosure of freehold lands that began in the later Middle Ages now gained momentum and farms <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>once</b> owned by individual farmers were now owned by small groups of wealthy landowners. By the 19th century most of the Rhondda farms and estates were owned by absentee landlords, such as the Marquis of Bute, Earl of Dunraven, Crawshay Bailey of Merthyr and the De Winton family of Brecon.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that a panmictic (random mating) wolf population, with gene flow spanning Eurasia and North America, existed until {{the closing of the}} ice sheets, after which the southern wolves became isolated, and only the Beringian wolf existed north of the sheets. The land bridge became inundated by the sea 10,000YBP, and the ice sheets receded 12,000—6,000YBP. The Beringian wolf became extinct, and the southern wolves expanded through the shrinking ice sheets to recolonize the northern part of North America. All North American wolves are descended from those <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>once</b> isolated south of the ice sheets. However, much of their diversity was later lost during the twentieth century due to eradication.|$|E

5|$|M-331 is an {{unsigned}} state trunkline {{highway in}} the U.S. state of Michigan {{located within the}} city of Kalamazoo. It runs from the southern city limits north into downtown Kalamazoo. This {{was one of many}} highways to be established or realigned {{as a result of a}} rationalization process initiated in 1998 during the tenure of Governor John Engler. M-331 uses streets in Kalamazoo <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>once</b> part of US Highway 131 (US131) before a freeway was built that bypassed the downtown area.|$|E
5|$|Males tend to {{move over}} longer {{distances}} than females. The average home range size in Fleming's study was 1.33hectares (3.3acres); males had larger home ranges on average. Specimens <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>once</b> captured {{tended to be}} captured more frequently than those {{that had never been}} captured. Fleming estimated that population densities reached peaks of up to 4.3 per ha (1.7 per acre) late in the rainy season (October–November), but dropped to near zero around June; however, these figures may well be underestimates. In central Venezuela, population densities vary from 5.5 to 9.6 per ha (2.2 to 3.8 per acre).|$|E
5|$|Recently, postmodernism {{has come}} to convey more {{completely}} prose and poetry as distinct entities, and also among genres of poetry, as having meaning only as cultural artifacts. Postmodernism goes beyond modernism's emphasis on the creative role of the poet, to emphasize {{the role of the}} reader of a text (Hermeneutics), and to highlight the complex cultural web within which a poem is read. Today, throughout the world, poetry often incorporates poetic form and diction from other cultures and from the past, further confounding attempts at definition and classification <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>once</b> sensible within a tradition such as the Western canon.|$|E

5|$|Some {{activities}} <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>once</b> considered entertaining, particularly public punishments, {{have been}} removed from the public arena. Others, such as fencing or archery, once necessary skills for some, have become serious sports and even professions for the participants, at the same time developing into entertainment with wider appeal for bigger audiences. In the same way, other necessary skills, such as cooking, have developed into performances among professionals, staged as global competitions and then broadcast for entertainment. What entertainment is for one group or individual may be regarded as work by another.|$|E
5|$|Soviet Russia, {{while at}} the time {{publicly}} supporting Polish and Lithuanian independence, sponsored communist agitators working against {{the government of the}} Second Polish Republic, and considered that its eastern borders should approximate those of the defunct Congress Poland. Poles and Lithuanians, on the other hand, inspired by memories of the greatness of the erstwhile Grand Duchy of Lithuania, part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, saw their borders as lying much farther east. The leader of the Polish forces, Józef Piłsudski, discerned an opportunity for regaining territories <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>once</b> the part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, and since then were part of the Prussian Empire, shaken by the 1917 Revolution and the ongoing Russian Civil War.|$|E
5|$|The Grade I listed {{buildings}} in Somerset, England, demonstrate {{the history and}} diversity of its architecture. The ceremonial county of Somerset consists of a non-metropolitan county, administered by Somerset County Council, which is divided into five districts, and two unitary authorities. The districts of Somerset are West Somerset, South Somerset, Taunton Deane, Mendip and Sedgemoor. The two administratively independent unitary authorities, which were established on 1 April 1996 following {{the breakup of the}} county of Avon, are North Somerset and Bath and North East Somerset. These unitary authorities include areas <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>once</b> part of Somerset before the creation of Avon in 1974.|$|E
