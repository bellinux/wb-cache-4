Regarding Rees' claim in his book Our Cosmic Habitat that [...] "such questions lie beyond science; however, they are the province of philosophers and theologians", Dawkins asks [...] "what expertise can theologians bring to deep cosmological questions that scientists cannot?"

40|$|This paper {{constructs}} {{a quantitative}} general equilibrium lifecycle model with uninsurable labor income {{to account for}} <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pattern of wealth accumulation across two countries, Korea and the United States. <b>The</b> model incorporates <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> housing market institution <b>in</b> <b>the</b> two countries, namely, the mortgage market and the rental market. As a {{focal point of the}} model, housing plays multiple roles for households: collateral as well as a source of service flows. The results from the calibrated model can quantitatively explain some empirical findings on the profile of wealth and homeownership <b>in</b> <b>the</b> aggregate as well as over the life cycle. The mortgage market can account for around 60 percent of <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> aggregate homeownership ratios <b>in</b> <b>the</b> two countries as well as 23 percent of <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> asset portfolio composition.
