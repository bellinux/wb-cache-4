50|$|Typically, {{one or more}} {{receivers}} and a {{heat exchanger}} operate within a closed <b>thermal</b> <b>loop.</b> To maintain efficient overall operation and avoid damage from thermal runaway, the demand for heat from the secondary side of the exchanger must be consistently high. Under such optimal operating conditions, collection efficiencies exceeding 70% (up to ~35% electric, ~40% thermal for HCPVT) are anticipated. Net operating efficiencies may be substantially lower depending on how well a system is engineered to match {{the demands of the}} particular thermal application.|$|E
40|$|In hot gauge theories, {{perturbation}} theory at {{the scale of}} the Debye screening mass requires the resummation of the so-called hard <b>thermal</b> <b>loops,</b> which corresponds to using an effective action obtained by integrating out the modes with momentum of order of the temperature. As is well-known, quantities which are sensitive to the nonperturbative magnetic screening mass still remain incalculable in this resummed {{perturbation theory}}. A different breakdown of the latter occurs whenever external momenta are light-like, because the hard <b>thermal</b> <b>loops</b> themselves develop collinear singularities.

50|$|The Polar cell, likewise, is {{a simple}} system. Though cool and dry {{relative}} to equatorial air, the air masses at the 60th parallel are still sufficiently warm and moist to undergo convection and drive a <b>thermal</b> <b>loop.</b> At the 60th parallel, the air rises to the tropopause (about 8 km at this latitude) and moves poleward. As it does so, the upper level air mass deviates toward the east. When the air reaches the polar areas, it has cooled and is considerably denser than the underlying air. It descends, creating a cold, dry high-pressure area. At the polar surface level, the mass of air is driven toward the 60th parallel, replacing the air that rose there, and the polar circulation cell is complete. As the air at the surface moves toward the equator, it deviates toward the west. Again, the deviations of the air masses {{are the result of}} the Coriolis effect. The air flows at the surface are called the polar easterlies.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} the hard <b>thermal</b> <b>loops</b> of Quantum Chromodynamics for a moving quarkgluon plasma. Generalizing from this we suggest {{a candidate for}} the magnetic mass term. This mass term may also be useful in understanding the mass gap of three-dimensional non-Abelian gauge theories.

As mentioned above, Γ[A] is essentially an electric mass term for gluons and properly incorporating Γ[A] in any calculation eliminates some of the infrared singularities.
