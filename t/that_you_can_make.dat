500|$|On 8 October, Banksy's {{piece in}} Greenpoint {{was simply a}} quote, [...] "I have a theory <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> any {{sentence}} seem profound by writing {{the name of a}} dead philosopher {{at the end of it}} -Plato".|$|E
500|$|In 2005, Hewson, Bono and {{designer}} Rogan Gregory co-founded the EDUN fashion label. It {{was intended to}} help bring about positive change in Africa through a fair trade-based relationship rather than by direct aid. Another aim of the label was to set an ethical example in an industry they felt had long exploited child labour. She said they wanted [...] "to show <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> a for-profit business where everybody in the chain is treated well." [...] Hewson had not been particularly interested in fashion prior to this undertaking.|$|E
500|$|Following the video's premiere on MTV, Gaga {{explained}} {{some of the}} its {{scenes and}} her inspiration: [...] "The video is quite complex {{in the way that}} the story is told, and it's meant to be slightly linear and slightly twisted and confusing, which is the way that love is." [...] Regarding the sexual intercourse scenes between actor Taylor Kinney and the singer as a mermaid, Gaga explained that it emphasized metaphorically that sometimes relationships did not work. [...] "No matter what you do, there's this giant boundary between you and someone else. So that's what it's about, perceiving in your imagination that there's something magical inside of you <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> it work," [...] she said. After revealing that the wedding dress shown in the video belonged to her mother, Gaga explained the scenes involving the ice cream truck. According to her, they represented the destruction of her youth, experiences she had shared in earlier interviews. Explaining her decision to include them, Gaga said: ...|$|E

6000|$|... "That is also true," [...] {{returned}} the youth mournfully. [...] "I know <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> never <b>make</b> me an angekok. Perhaps {{it would be}} better not to try." ...|$|R

500|$|All {{but two of}} {{the drum}} tracks are {{composed}} of samples performed by drummer Colm Ó Cíosóig. Because Ó Cíosóig was suffering from physical and personal problems during the album's recording, samples of various drum patterns {{that he was able to}} perform in his condition were recorded. According to Shields, [...] "t's exactly what Colm would have done, it just took longer to do." [...] Ó Cíosóig recovered enough to play live on two of the album's songs, [...] "Only Shallow" [...] and [...] "Touched", the latter of which was composed and performed entirely by the drummer. Shields believes that listeners are unable to tell the difference between Ó Cíosóig's live drumming and the drum loops aside from the tracks intended to have an obviously [...] "sampled" [...] sound, like the dance-oriented [...] "Soon". The album makes extensive use of samples, with Shields stating, [...] "Most of the samples are feedback. We learnt from guitar feedback, with lots of distortion, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> any instrument, any one that you can imagine".|$|E
2500|$|... "Montségur" [...] {{was based}} on the fall of the Cathar stronghold of the same name, which fell in the {{aftermath}} of the Albigensian Crusade in 1244. Dickinson, who wrote the song's lyrics, states, [...] "There is so much great stuff and so many great stories throughout history <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> parallels with the modern day – particularly when history repeats itself as often as it does – that it makes for some very colourful subject matter." ...|$|E

40|$|Ruling out {{secondary}} {{causes of}} amenorrhea is, of course, the first step.

6000|$|... "Because what? Why don't {{you speak}} out? You {{need not be}} afraid of hurting me. Nothing <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> say <b>can</b> <b>make</b> it at all worse than it is." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You know I {{do nothing}} without telling you," [...] she began. [...] "--Only, {{sometimes}} you must ask me, like this time. I {{wanted to tell}} you, but I did not know how. It is false modesty, I know it is <b>that,</b> but <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> it easy for me. Sometimes, like this time, you must ask me, you must give me a chance." ...|$|R
