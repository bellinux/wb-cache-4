40|$|The 49 -year-old Chemistry and Metallurgy Research (CMR) Facility {{is where}} {{analytical}} chemistry and metallurgical studies on samples of plutonium and nuclear materials are conduct {{in support of}} the Department of Energy's nuclear weapons program. The CMR Facility is expected to be decontaminated and decommissioned (D and D) over the next ten to twenty years. Over the decades, several hazardous material issues have developed that need to be address. Unstable chemicals must be properly reassigned or disposed of from the workspace during D and D operation. Materials that have critical effects that are primarily chronic in nature, carcinogens, reproductive toxin, and materials that exhibit high chronic toxicity, have unique decontamination requirements, including the decontrolling of areas where these chemicals were used. Certain types of equipment and materials that contain mercury, asbestos, lead, and polychlorinated biphenyls have special provisions that must be addressed. Utilization of commercially available software programs for addressing hazardous material issues during D and D operations such as legacy chemicals and documentation are presented. These user-friendly programs eliminate part of the tediousness associated with the complex requirements of legacy hazardous materials. A key element of this approach is having a program that inventories and tracks all hazardous materials. Without an inventory of chemicals stored in a particular location, many important questions pertinent to D and D operations can be difficult to answer. On the other hand, a well-managed inventory system can address unstable and highly toxic chemicals and hazardous material records concerns before they become an <b>issue.</b> <b>Tapping</b> into the institutional database provides a way {{to take advantage of the}} combined expertise of the institution in managing a cost effective D and D program as well as adding a quality assurance element to the program.

40|$|Narrative {{theory and}} methods are {{increasingly}} featured in qualitative research relating to human occupation, both according to stories told and stories created. In this ethnographic study, the researcher {{participated in the}} everyday activities of four women living with chronic rheumatic diseases, aiming at locating if and how narrativity, here understood as meaning making, took place in such activities. Narrative analyses were conducted, {{based on data from}} extensive field notes and reflective journals, together with theoretical resources regarding everyday occupations, chronic diseases and narrativity. The results of this hermeneutic interpretative process show how the actual doing of ordinary everyday occupations provided opportunities connected to several possible plots. The occupational encounters facilitated talk and interaction, characterized by fluctuations and crisscrossing between place, space and the sociality of the moment. Going shopping, having a coffee break, feeding the fire or clearing the dishwasher, provided links to significant issues in the participant’s lives. By doing such activities, the participants enacted the “if’s” of ordinariness, the still not configured stories, connected to their chronic conditions, their relationships, choices, womanhood, agency and politics. All this trying out or enactment through everyday occupations pointed towards several overall plots, like; living with a chronic disease felt like having an additional partner which one could not get rid of. Another possible plot was that they always had to do things in the moment when the body felt good, or the possibility would disappear due to symptoms of the disease. Also significant was never to know how and if one is as good as everyone else, as normality was not an option. These everyday enactments provided opportunities for the individual woman to <b>tap</b> into significant <b>issues,</b> but also to establish her own agency concerning how she chose to deal with them. Some issues could come close to a configured story, others were left open to future interpretation, and others stayed preconfigured.

40|$|In Partial Fulfillment of the Master of Public Policy Degree RequirementsIt is {{difficult}} to underestimate the impact that the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB) has had on U. S. education policy. NCLB greatly expanded the federal government‟s role in education, traditionally the domain of local school districts and the states. It required that all states implement standards, testing, school report cards, Adequate Yearly Progress, and sanctions for “failing” schools {{in order to continue}} to receive federal education funding. While the mandate was effective nationwide, each state‟s experience with the law has been unique, shaped by the existing education reforms and the myriad factors that influence state education policymaking. Frederick Wirt and Michael Kirst describe state education policy as follows: “No such thing as state education policy exists; what does exist are differential state responses to common external and internal events working on the local political system” (1997, pg. 197). The goal {{of this paper is to}} document how Minnesota state policymakers responded to the passage of NCLB and to explore how influences on the state political system shaped that response. Minnesota policymakers could do little to change NCLB. However, numerous state-level education accountability decisions followed its passage and were influenced by forces within the state political system:  State actors: From 2003 to 2010, activist Republican Governor Tim Pawlenty used the authority of his office and his alliance with business groups to advance standards-based reform and enthusiastically implement NCLB policies. His national political ambitions led him to <b>tap</b> policy <b>issue</b> networks to bring accountability ideas, like 8 th grade algebra, to Minnesota.  Political environment: Near-continuous state budget crises and a governorship and legislature divided along party lines created a political environment primed for conflict.  Political culture: Minnesota‟s moralistic political culture has traditionally emphasized government as a source of common good, issues as the center of political debate and the involvement of citizens in public life. But the increasing polarization in moral values 3 between conservative and liberal state political actors created stark contrasts in education accountability debates, as in the debate over academic standards and the denial of Education Commissioner Cheri Yecke‟s confirmation in 2004.  Values: Legislators debated the relative importance of values of equity, quality, efficiency, and choice in accountability policy (Wirt & Kirst, 1997). Even when there was agreement over the importance of a value, there was often disagreement over how it would best be advanced. For example, legislators on both sides of the high school GRAD math exit exam debate placed equity at the center of their arguments, but came to opposing conclusions on whether to suspend the exam.  Interest groups: Education interest groups played a modest role in issues of accountability, with the statewide teachers‟ union and business groups the most engaged. The alliance of teachers with the Democratic party and business with the Republican party heightened partisanship around accountability issues with which these groups were involved, such as the Race to the Top federal education reform grant application. While none of these factors fully explain the decisions made by legislators and the Governor on education accountability, together they shed light on a period marked by massive change. This paper will start by providing a brief overview of the accountability movement in U. S. government institutions and in public education. It will then provide a timeline of changes to education accountability policy in Minnesota, beginning with the passage of NCLB in 2002 and ending with the close of the most recent legislative session in July 2011. Finally, it will analyze several of the forces that influenced legislative decisions about these policies...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{project was}} {{initiated}} {{in the autumn}} of 2012 to particularly look into the area of business-to-business relationships {{in the context of the}} advertising industry. In particular, the focus being to research this aspect from the view of different advertising mediums. The motivation for this stemmed from the idea of various B 2 B studies existing on a general level, while specific studies into B 2 B relationships and their impact on advertising effectiveness do not exist, particularly from the viewpoint of different advertising channels. In order to tap into this gap, this study incorporated advertising mediums from print and tablet advertising. This was done due to the novelty and increasing importance of tablet advertising and the possibility to compare it to more traditional advertising channels (i. e. newspaper and magazine advertising). Following the notions rising from the literature, the research set particular focus on existing B 2 B taxonomy study by Cannon and Perreault (1999) and sought out to adapt the featured scales into advertising industry context. The research was based on a survey that tested the relationships depending on the mediums and reviewed their impacts on advertising effectiveness. The survey was sent out to the largest companies in Finland by revenue with 46 fulfilled responses arising high-level decision makers, such as CEOs, Marketing Directors/Managers and other relevant personnel. For the analysis, the study utilized qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) and its fuzzy-set variant that make it possible to implement the positive aspects of qualitative analysis over more than a handful of cases. In addition, the method includes quantitative, empirical foundation and thus overall provides for scientifically viable results through configurations that lead to an outcome. Using this method, the research determined that there are notable differences between the advertising mediums, when considering relation-specific details that lead to advertising campaigns to succeed. Highly prioritized print media mediums were more prone to be used in a less-cooperative manner, whereas the lower prioritized tablet advertising was sought to succeed with tight cooperative actions between the advertiser and the provider. Thus, for decision makers in the advertising industry, it can be useful to be aware of the perceived factors that lead to success (e. g. whether to share proprietary information) and how these are dependent on the advertising medium. In the case of advertising providers, it can be seen equally as important to react accordingly to these perceptions to build successful relationships between the parties that yield value and success. This research was seen to <b>tap</b> into these <b>issues</b> and as such provide for both managerial and theoretical implications...|$|R
40|$|Overview To {{provide insight}} into the reality of forced {{marriage}} in Australia today, this case book is based on lived experiences of people involved in cases brought to our attention in the course of research and advocacy on forced and servile marriage. In fact, cases informing this work connected to many dozens of countries in the Americas, Asia, Africa and Europe as well as New Zealand and Australia.  All cases have been edited to preserve the privacy and anonymity of those involved or who observed the case unfold, and to that end all are intentionally composed of elements from multiples cases.   Equally, the cases included here are deliberately cast as neutral in terms of culture, ethnithcity, religion, country of origin and/or other social reference points. The simple reason is that this truly represents the nature of forced marriage. Almost identical cases have been observed or related from multiple, highly diverse contexts. Accordingly, this socially featureless presentation is an authentic approach which accurately portrays the most salient feature of forced marriage – that it transcends such boundaries and ought never be discounted as a possibility in any case, most particularly {{on the grounds of the}} supposedly “known” incidence of forced or servile marriage in any given context. Cases are laid out in a four page format to facilitate their use as stand alone printable resources. Each case is presented in a standard structure to support their complementary use where appropriate. For handouts to use in a group discussion, the selected case(s) may be printed as a leaflet of the four pages to provide participants with a self-contained tool for the session and then a take away for later use. Similarly, the ‘Resource Material’ section is set out in a four page format that can be printed as a takeaway reference for later reference. In terms of the content of each case: 	A narrative provides the stimulus material for discussion, some styled in the first person of the potential/actual victim, some from the perspective of another party. A combination is useful in developing understanding of the layered nature of disclosure/discovery of forced marriage cases. 	Each narrative is followed by a standard set of questions that are designed to prompt individual thinking and draw out the different dimensions found in the risk or reality of forced marriage. They also structure a small group discussion or larger group debrief. 	The four page layout is completed by a notes page for convenience of users. Finally, the ‘Discussion Guide’ section includes a synopsis of the case set to assist in contrasting cases and case selection for discussion, along with model answers to the standard questions for each case to assist the discussion leader. These are not intended to be exhaustive but to <b>tap</b> the key <b>issues</b> and, used in tandem, show important points of departure in how cases unfold. Further input on development of these responses over time would be particularly welcome from those making use of this case book.   This case book was developed as part of the Forced & Servile Marriage Research Project at Rosemount Good Shepherd Youth & Family Services in Sydney, Australia. The primary work was completed by the Research Project Officer, Carolyn Evans CSC MLS MBA Grad Dip OR BBus (Dist).
