25|$|Alphabetical, numeric, and {{punctuation}} {{keys are}} used in the same fashion as a <b>typewriter</b> <b>keyboard</b> to enter their respective symbol into a word processing program, text editor, data spreadsheet, or other program. Many of these keys will produce different symbols when modifier keys or shift keys are pressed. The alphabetic characters become uppercase when the shift key or Caps Lock key is depressed. The numeric characters become symbols or punctuation marks when the shift key is depressed. The alphabetical, numeric, and punctuation keys can also have other functions when they are pressed {{at the same time as}} some modifier keys.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{examples}} of typewriter {{practices that are}} sometimes still used in desktop publishing systems include inserting a double space {{at the end of}} a sentence, and the use of straight quotes (or [...] "dumb quotes") as quotation marks and prime marks.

Modern improvements in Urdu keyboard were pioneered by the National Language Authority (Muqtadra-e-Qaumi Zaban) in Pakistan, which standardised the linguistic aspects such as orthography and lexicography. These developments helped the keyboard layout to evolve from the typewriters to be compatible with computers, to increase the productivity and textual efficiency of the language, especially through modern electronic media.|$|R
