5|$|After marrying in 1980, {{the couple}} {{stayed in the}} United States, {{initially}} settling in Hawaii.

5|$|Beth Hamedrash was the prototypical American synagogue {{for early}} {{immigrant}} Eastern European Jews, who began entering the United States {{in large numbers}} only in the 1870s. <b>They</b> <b>found</b> <b>the</b> synagogues of the German Jewish immigrants who preceded them to be unfamiliar, both religiously and culturally. Russian Jews in particular had been more excluded from Russian society than were German Jews from German society, for both linguistic and social reasons. Unlike German Jews, the Jews who founded Beth Hamedrash viewed both religion and the synagogue as central to their lives. They attempted to re-create in Beth Hamedrash the kind of synagogue they had belonged to in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Black currawongs {{are very}} common around picnic areas in Tasmania's {{two most popular}} National Parks, Freycinet and Cradle Mountain-Lake St Clair, and are often fed by {{tourists}} there. The National Parks Authority tolerated this practice until 1995, when <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>the</b> birds were becoming a nuisance and began discouraging people from feeding wildlife. However, the agile currawongs are adept at snatching fragments of food left by picnickers so the birds may only ultimately be discouraged by an (impractical) ban on food in National Parks. Birds also take other items such as soap or cutlery from campsites to examine.|$|E
5|$|Children of Mana was {{designed}} by series creator Koichi Ishii, directed by Yoshiki Ito, and produced by Takashi Orikata and Katsuji Aoyama. The game was a moderate commercial success: it sold 100,000 copies in its first week of release, and over 280,000 copies in Japan {{by the end of}} 2006. While critics praised the graphics and music as beautiful and unique, <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>the</b> combat simplistic and repetitive, and the story insubstantial.|$|E

5|$|Cold Fear was {{met with}} mixed reviews, with many critics {{comparing}} it unfavorably to Resident Evil 4. Although critics were generally impressed with the environments and the opening scenes, <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>the</b> game too short and felt it {{failed to live up}} to its promising beginning. The game was a commercial failure; by February 2006, it had sold only 70,000 units across all three platforms in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Dawn of Mana was designed, directed, and {{produced}} by series creator Koichi Ishii.

The game was a moderate commercial success: it sold 229,000 copies in its first ten days of release in Japan, and over 410,000 copies worldwide {{by the end of}} 2008. While critics praised the graphics and music as beautiful and lush, <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>the</b> leveling system annoying, the combat controls difficult and frustrating, and the story trite.|$|E
5|$|Famitsu writers {{appreciated}} {{the amount of}} freedom the player has.

5|$|From the {{beginning}} of his rule, Basiliscus showed his support for the Miaphysites. Zacharias Scholasticus reports how a group of Egyptian Miaphysite monks, having heard of Emperor Leo's death, had moved from Alexandria to Constantinople to petition Zeno in favour of Timothy, but at their arrival in the capital, <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>the</b> newly elected Basiliscus instead. The Magister Officiorum Theoctistus, the former physician of Basiliscus, was the brother of one of the monks, so the delegation obtained an audience with Basiliscus, and, with the support of Theoctistus and of the Empress, they convinced Basiliscus to recall from exile the banished Miaphysite Patriarchs.|$|E
5|$|Herodotus {{says that}} when the Persians in Asia Minor heard {{of the attack on}} Sardis, they {{gathered}} together, and marched to the relief of Artaphernes. When they arrived at Sardis, <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>the</b> Greeks recently departed. So they followed their tracks back towards Ephesus. They caught up with the Greeks outside Ephesus and the Greeks were forced to turn and prepare to fight. Holland suggests that the Persians were primarily cavalry (hence their ability {{to catch up with the}} Greeks). The typical Persian cavalry of the time were probably missile cavalry, whose tactics were to wear down a static enemy with volley after volley.|$|E
5|$|In 1872, {{some time}} after they {{had taken over the}} Sikhs' territory, the British {{developed}} the mine further. <b>They</b> <b>found</b> <b>the</b> mining to have been inefficient, with irregular and narrow tunnels and entrances that made the movement of labourers difficult and dangerous. The supply of water inside the mine was poor, and there was no storage facility for the mined salt. The only road to the mine was over difficult, rocky terrain. To address these problems the government levelled the road, built warehouses, provided a water supply, improved the entrances and tunnels, and introduced a better mechanism for excavation of salt. Penalties were introduced to control salt smuggling.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, {{researchers}} from six different orangutan field sites {{who used the}} same behavioural coding scheme compared the behaviours of the animals from the different sites. <b>They</b> <b>found</b> <b>the</b> different orangutan populations behaved differently. The evidence suggested the differences were cultural: first, {{the extent of the}} differences increased with distance, suggesting cultural diffusion was occurring, and second, the size of the orangutans' cultural repertoire increased according to the amount of social contact present within the group. Social contact facilitates cultural transmission.|$|E
5|$|In May 1993, {{the band}} {{heard that a}} record {{executive}} from Creation Records would be scouting for talent at King Tut's in Glasgow.

The band eventually secured the opening slot and played a four-song set that impressed Creation founder Alan McGee.|$|E

Shanghai Film Studio had agreed to co-produce I Not Stupid Too with Raintree Pictures, but backed out because <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>the</b> film too liberal. The production crew included Daniel Yun as executive producer, Chan Pui Yin and Seah Saw Yan as producers, Ardy Lam as cinematographer and Mo Ju Li as sound editor. Besides writing and directing, Neo starred as Mr. Yeo and composed the theme song, which was sung by Hong Junyang.|$|E
