5|$|Behind Royal Sovereign was Marlborough, {{inextricably}} <b>tangled</b> <b>with</b> Impétueux. Badly {{damaged and}} {{on the verge of}} surrender, Impétueux was briefly reprieved when Mucius appeared through the smoke and collided with both ships. The three entangled ships continued exchanging fire for some time, all suffering heavy casualties with Marlborough and Impétueux losing all three of their masts. This combat continued for several hours. Captain Berkeley of Marlborough had to retire below with serious wounds, and command fell to Lieutenant John Monkton, who signalled for help from the frigates in reserve. Robert Stopford responded in HMS Aquilon, which had the assignment of repeating signals, and towed Marlborough out of the line as Mucius freed herself and made for the regrouped French fleet to the north. Impétueux was in too damaged a state to move at all, and was soon seized by sailors from HMS Russell.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the second}} half, Tottenham's Pat van den Hauwe was cautioned by Holbrook for getting <b>tangled</b> <b>with</b> Arsenal's David Rocastle, in spite Rocastle {{indicating}} that the player used an elbow– a bookable offence. Moments after, Rocastle was shown a yellow card for attempting to get his own back on Van Den Hauwe, by tackling the player without intent. Van Den Hauwe was later booked for a wild challenge on Lee Dixon. Arsenal dominated possession during the second half, with Tottenham infrequently troubling their opponent's defence and relying on counterattacks to fashion goal-scoring chances. Smith had a chance saved in the 75th minute by goalkeeper Erik Thorstvedt, when the ball was back-passed across the penalty area by Steve Sedgley. In the final seconds of the match substitute Andrew Cole, who had replaced Campbell, shot from 20 yards and into the side-netting.|$|E
5|$|Rolling Thunder exposed many {{problems}} within the American military services committed {{to it and}} tended to exacerbate others. A key interservice issue (and one which was not solved until 1968) was the command and control arrangement in Southeast Asia. The Air Force's 2nd Air Division (replaced by the Seventh Air Force on 1 April 1966) was ostensibly responsible for aerial operations over North and South Vietnam. It was subordinate, however, to MACV and its commander, U.S. Army General William C. Westmoreland, who tended to see his problems centered in the south. The U.S. Seventh/Thirteenth Air Force, based in Thailand (which carried out {{the majority of the}} Air Force's strikes in North Vietnam), had a dual command structure. It reported to the Seventh on operational matters and to the Thirteenth Air Force (whose headquarters was in the Philippines) for logistical and administrative concerns. These command and control complexities grew even more <b>tangled</b> <b>with</b> the division of the aerial effort into four competing operational areas (those in South Vietnam, North Vietnam, and Laos (both north and south).|$|E

25|$|Around Höfen, {{which the}} 395th defended, {{the ground was}} marked with open hills. On the east lay {{a section of the}} Monschau Forest. Just south of Höfen, the lines of the 99th entered this forest, ran through a long belt of timber to the {{boundary}} between the V and VIII Corps at the Losheim Gap. The thick forest was <b>tangled</b> <b>with</b> rocky gorges, little streams, and sharp hills.|$|E
25|$|The two Ferraris of Niki Lauda (on pole) and Clay Regazzoni {{qualified}} on {{the front}} row, but their glory would not last long. At the start, Vittorio Brambilla's March <b>tangled</b> <b>with</b> Mario Andretti's Parnelli. Andretti's car hit the back of Lauda's, sending him into Regazzoni. Lauda was out immediately, while Regazzoni took his car to the garage, where repairs were made, and Regazzoni was sent back out. Patrick Depailler also retired on the first lap because of suspension damage, and Wilson Fittipaldi and Arturo Merzario withdrew in protest.|$|E
25|$|At Richmond, Busch led for 36 laps and contended for victory. However, on a final restart {{he again}} <b>tangled</b> <b>with</b> Tony Stewart. He had bumped Stewart on the restart causing Stewart to finish {{out of the}} top-ten. After the race ended the two cars {{exchanged}} shoves and the two argued on pit road, drawing attention away from race winner Kevin Harvick. Both were summoned to the NASCAR hauler. Busch finished in ninth place, and said to reporters {{that he did not}} intentionally hit Stewart and said he was surprised and disappointed when Stewart retaliated after the checkers.|$|E

25|$|The {{chloroplast}} membranes sometimes protrude {{out into}} the cytoplasm, forming a stromule, or stroma-containing tubule. Stromules are very rare in chloroplasts, and are much more common in other plastids like chromoplasts and amyloplasts in petals and roots, respectively. They may exist to increase the chloroplast's surface area for cross-membrane transport, because they are often branched and <b>tangled</b> <b>with</b> the endoplasmic reticulum. When they were first observed in 1962, some plant biologists dismissed the structures as artifactual, claiming that stromules were just oddly shaped chloroplasts with constricted regions or dividing chloroplasts. However, {{there is a growing}} body of evidence that stromules are functional, integral features of plant cell plastids, not merely artifacts.|$|E
25|$|A mass fall {{occurred}} as the climbers began the traverse. George Bell slipped {{and fell on}} a patch of hard ice, pulling off his rope-mate Tony Streather. As they fell their rope became <b>tangled</b> <b>with</b> those connecting Houston, Bates, Gilkey and Molenaar, pulling all these climbers off as well. Finally the strain came onto Pete Schoening, who had been belaying Gilkey and Molenaar. Quickly wrapping the rope around his shoulders and ice axe, Schoening held all six climbers, some of whom had by that point fallen over 100m. Had he not done so, the entire team, apart from Craig who was unroped, would have fallen around 2000m to the Godwin-Austen Glacier.|$|E

A master ad libber, Allen often <b>tangled</b> <b>with</b> his network's executives (and often barbed them on the air over the battles) while developing routines whose style and substance influenced fellow comic talents, including Groucho Marx, Stan Freberg, Henry Morgan and Johnny Carson; his avowed fans also included President Franklin D.

25|$|On lap four, {{the engine}} in Jody Scheckter's Tyrrell blew, {{and the oil}} dumping onto the circuit caused Alan Jones and Mark Donohue to crash. Three laps later, Hunt also slipped in the oil and crashed. The top three had become Andretti, Watson, and Stommelen. Watson's car {{suffered}} from vibrations and dropped out. Andretti's rear suspension lasted only seven more laps before it failed, causing him to crash out of the lead. Jean-Pierre Jarier and Brambilla stopped to change tyres, whilst Tom Pryce and Tony Brise tangled. Stommelen was now in the top spot, followed by Pace, Ronnie Peterson, Jochen Mass, and Ickx. On lap 24, Peterson was out after he <b>tangled</b> <b>with</b> François Migault while trying to lap the Frenchman.|$|E
25|$|Nick Barmby {{marked his}} 500th career {{appearance}} {{against one of}} his former clubs as Middlesbrough visited Hull City for the first ever top-flight match between the two sides. Hull lined up with former Boro captain George Boateng in midfield after his departure during the summer. The previous four league meetings between the two sides had all ended in 0–0 draws, and it looked like the match was heading for another until Tuncay opened the scoring on 79 minutes. Boro's lead didn't last long however, as Bernard Mendy's shot hit the post and rebounded off of goalkeeper Ross Turnbull to go down as an own goal. It got worse for the visitors as just a few minutes later, Hull were awarded a soft penalty when Wheater <b>tangled</b> <b>with</b> Geovanni – a challenge which also saw the Middlesbrough defender receive a red card. TV replays showed that Geovanni was offside when the ball was played to him, but nothing was awarded by the assistant referee. Marlon King converted the penalty to give Hull a 2–1 victory.|$|E
25|$|Chief Engineer Alecz Lorhrok is an unjoined Trill, born on {{his home}} planet in the Kalandra Sector on December 11, 2356. Due to his {{youthful}} looks he is often mistaken for an Ensign (rank) or Cadet. After hostilities during the Dominion War around his home planet ended, Lorhrok enlisted in Starfleet {{at the age of}} 18, and obtained a degree in starship design. His first posting was to the USS Steadfast (NCC-1966), where he applied his skills and an unorthodox methodology to keep the old ship in good repair. After the Steadfast was decommissioned, Lorhrok considered requesting a transfer to Utopia Planitia. Instead, he was offered and accepted the position of Chief Engineer on the Excelsior. During the first episode, while the Excelsior was still docked at Starbase 911, Lorhrok <b>tangled</b> <b>with</b> crewwoman Kinash Adow, who subsequently sabotaged Lorhrok's replicator which inadvertently affected all replicators on that whole deck. On the Excelsior 's maiden voyage to the Valendrian system Lorhrok was put in charge of young stow-away Simon Westlake. The role of Lorhrok was portrayed by Ben Randall during Episodes 100 - 102 as well as Episode #3E, and by Sam Gillis in all episodes since.|$|E

25|$|Chaz Mostert won {{the first}} race of the Skycity Triple Crown ahead of {{teammate}} Mark Winterbottom. Rick Kelly took his second podium finish in three races by finishing third. James Courtney had taken pole position but <b>tangled</b> <b>with</b> Shane Van Gisbergen and Garth Tander on a restart after a safety car period, with Courtney penalised {{for his role in}} the incident. Jamie Whincup, Craig Lowndes and Jason Bright also received points penalties for various incidents during the race. Lowndes recovered in the second race to score his 100th career victory in the Australian Touring Car Championship and V8 Supercars, becoming the first driver to reach the mark. Tim Slade finished second ahead of Mostert. Rick Kelly had qualified on pole position for the first time since 2011 but collided with Fabian Coulthard at the first corner and received a drive-through penalty. David Reynolds took pole position for the Sunday race but Coulthard took the lead at the start. Coulthard lost the lead when he went off the track while lapping Andre Heimgartner, losing places to Reynolds and Mostert. Reynolds himself ran off the circuit in trying to avoid the lapped Michael Caruso, cutting off a portion of the track in the process. After retaking his place behind Caruso, Reynolds held off Mostert to take victory. A delaminated tyre for Lowndes towards the end of the race dropped him to fifteenth, allowing Winterbottom to extend his championship lead to 95 points.|$|E
