A single MSDT involves testing k specimens simultaneously until the rth failure. The traditional sudden death test (SDT) is a special case when r = 1. The complete MSDT plan consists of g single MSDTs run in sequence. When r ? 1, there can be up to r Γ 1 idle test positions at any time. We propose testing "standby" specimens in the idle positions and use simulation to gauge the improvement over the basic MSDT plan.

40|$|Measurement {{invariance}} {{testing is}} prerequisite if meaningful comparisons of latent construct across groups {{are important to}} the study in social science. If measurement invariance is rejected, the result of non-invariance might be from unbalanced covariates across groups. Propensity score is one approach to correct unbalanced covariates in the data when these unbalanced covariates are the source of measurement non-invariance. The main purpose of this dissertation is to evaluate propensity score adjustment in testing measurement invariance in both empirical data and Monte Carlo simulation study. The traditional logistic regression and machine learning estimation method (i. e., random forest) were applied to obtain accurate propensity score. In empirical study, when propensity score was applied as a new covariate to adjust unbalanced covariates across groups, measurement invariance was improved from metric invariance to scalar invariance. Weighting by odds method with random forest estimation improved the metric invariance to scalar invariance, but weighting with logistic regression did not. The results of a simulation study indicated a substantial Type I error rate inflation if ignoring the unbalanced covariates among groups and using multiple group CFA to conduct the measurement invariance <b>test.</b> <b>Type</b> <b>I</b> error rate inflation was also observed if logistic regression was applied to adjust measurement invariance.

In fact, Type I errors can be highly inflated for some of the commonly used tests, a serious issue that seems to have been overlooked. Even though several tests have been proposed to overcome the problem, most of them show difficulty in calculation.

In all, a positive test result increased moderately or markedly the probability of reporting bias being present, while a negative test result was not very informative. In the two examples, the test gave a signal for an excess of statistically significant results in the network of published data but not in the network of FDA data.

40|$|Reverse auction bidding is {{an online}} auction system. A purchaser's primary {{objective}} in using a reverse auction is {{to obtain the}} lowest possible bid {{for goods and services}} on a construction project. With this type of bidding, it is normal that the purchaser will only consider price, instead of a bidders' work history and experience. As a reverse auction is an online service, the common misperception is that a purchaser can reach a broader market to obtain the lowest possible price. It is a controversial bidding system. No previous research has been undertaken by the Texas A&M University Reverse Auction Bidding study group into potential owner interference with the bidding system for a reverse auction. Six bidders were asked to participate in the Reverse Auction Bidding process for a series of construction projects in Houston. Each participant was also asked to complete a Keirsey Temperament Sorter <b>Test</b> <b>type</b> <b>I</b> and II to determine each participant's personality.

The other five bidders were unaware of the surrogate's role in the bidding. The primary directive given to the surrogate bidder was to drive down the cost of the projects. The results for the research study show that the owner's surrogate can affect the bidding process.

This research has focused on pedagogical aspects of Korean pragmatics and interlanguage pragmatics. However, very little research has been done on the pragmatics assessment of KFL learners, in terms of discussing appropriate test types and whether, certain speech acts and test types affect raters' assessment of KFL learners' pragmatics performance. The focus of this study is on investigating (a) whether factors such as test types and speech acts affect raters' assessments of the pragmatics of KFL learners and (b) which test types are most appropriate for assessing pragmatics of KFL learners. For these purposes, this study analyzes three interactions from the test results using the computer program FACETS (Linacre, 1996) : the interactions between rater bias and test types, rater bias and speech acts, and examinees and test types. This study uses three different pragmatics tests adapted from Hudson, Detmer, and Brown's (1995) pragmatics prototype tests: Open-written' Discourse Completion Task, Language Lab, and Role-play. Within each of these three test types are three speech acts: refusal, apology, and request.

5000|$|Receptor {{tyrosine}} kinases (RTKs) play a {{key role}} in the communication of cells with their microenvironment. These molecules are involved in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation and metabolism. The protein encoded by this gene is a RTK that is widely expressed in normal and transformed epithelial cells and is activated by various types of collagen. This protein belongs to a subfamily of tyrosine kinase receptors with a homology region to the Dictyostelium discoideum protein discoidin I in their extracellular domain. Its autophosphorylation is achieved by all collagens so far <b>tested</b> (<b>type</b> <b>I</b> to <b>type</b> VI). A closely related family member is the DDR2 protein. [...] In situ studies and Northern-blot analysis showed that expression of this encoded protein is restricted to epithelial cells, particularly in the kidney, lung, gastrointestinal tract, and brain. In addition, this protein is significantly over-expressed in several human tumors from breast, ovarian, esophageal, and pediatric brain. This gene is located on chromosome 6p21.3 in proximity to several HLA class I genes. Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants.|$|R

Monte Carlo simulations showed the proposed <b>test</b> had expected <b>type</b> <b>I</b> error rate and sufficient statistical power under moderate sample sizes. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{recognition}} of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by the {{innate immune system}} is a crucial step in inducing effective immune responses. Double-stranded RNA [mimicked by polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C) ], synthesized by various types of viruses, represents one important member of these immunostimulatory microbial components. Here we report that poly(I:C) has potent γδ T-cell costimulatory capacity. Within peripheral blood mononuclear cells, poly(I:C) -stimulated γδ T cells expressed increased levels of CD 69 and exhibited significantly enhanced antigen-mediated proliferation in response to isopentenylpyrophosphate (IPP). Among several recombinant cytokines <b>tested,</b> <b>type</b> <b>I</b> interferons (IFN-α, IFN-β) and interleukin- 15 (IL- 15) showed a similar activation pattern of γδ T cells. γδ T-cell clones and purified γδ T cells {{did not respond to}} poly(I:C), indicating indirect effects of this compound. Depletion of CD 11 c+ dendritic cells (DC), which express Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR 3), known to recognize poly(I:C), abrogated poly(I:C) -mediated stimulation of γδ T cells. In addition, the supernatant of poly(I:C) -treated CD 11 c+ DC was able to mimic the stimulatory effects of poly(I:C) on γδ T cells. Experiments with neutralizing antibodies indicated that <b>type</b> <b>I</b> IFNs, but not IL- 15, contributed to the poly(I:C) -mediated activation of γδ T cells. In conclusion, γδ T-cell activation by immunostimulatory double-stranded RNA, such as poly(I:C), is indirectly mediated via <b>type</b> <b>I</b> IFNs derived from TLR 3 -expressing CD 11 c+ DCs. These results suggest that upon confrontation with certain viruses, γδ T cells can be rapidly activated by <b>type</b> <b>I</b> interferons and may contribute to effective antiviral responses...|$|R
