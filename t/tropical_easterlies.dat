40|$|The {{interaction}} between high-frequency transient disturbances and convection, and the Madden [...] Julian Oscillation (MJO), is investigated using NCEP-NCAR reanalysis and satellite outgoing longwave radiation data for 15 northern winters. During {{the phase of}} the MJO with enhanced convection over the East Indian Ocean and Indonesia, and suppressed convection over the South Pacific convergence zone, both the Asian [...] Pacific jet and the region of upper-tropospheric <b>tropical</b> <b>easterlies</b> over the warm pool are displaced westward. These changes in the basic state lead to a weaker or ``leakier'' waveguide in the Asian [...] Pacific jet, with a westward-displaced ``forbidden'' region of <b>tropical</b> <b>easterlies,</b> such that high-frequency transient waves propagate equatorwards into the deep tropics over the central Pacific near the date line. As these waves induce convection {{in the region of}} ascent and reduced static stability ahead of the upper-level cyclonic disturbances, there is an enhancement of high-frequency convective variability over the central Pacific intertropical convergence zone during this phase of the MJO. This enhanced high-frequency convective variability appears to project back onto intraseasonal timescales, and forms {{an integral part of the}} slowly varying diabatic heating field of the MJO. In the opposite phase of the MJO, the Asian [...] Pacific jet is extended eastward and there is an almost continuous waveguide across the Pacific. Together with the expanded forbidden region of <b>tropical</b> <b>easterlies</b> over the warm pool, this leads to a more zonal propagation of high-frequency transients along the waveguide with less equatorward propagation, and hence reduced high-frequency convective variability over the tropical central Pacific. There is also evidence of high-frequency waves propagating into the Indian Ocean region at the beginning of the MJO cycle, which may be important in the initiation of intraseasonal convective anomalies there...|$|E

The patterns obtained in this study may be considered as characteristic patterns for interdecadal variations. 1.

They appear as two modes, one is related with variations of the <b>tropical</b> <b>easterlies</b> {{and the other with}} the Southern Hemisphere westerlies. Both have red spectra. The amplitude of the associated wind anomalies is largest in the upper troposphere. The associated temperature anomalies are in thermal-wind balance with the zonal winds and are out-of-phase between the troposphere and the lower stratosphere. 2. The Pacific Ocean: The dominant mode in the Pacific appears to be wind-driven in the midlatitudes and is related to air-sea interaction processes during one stage of the oscillation in the tropics.

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} is advanced that a latitudinal {{shift in the}} tropical convective heating pattern can significantly alter temperatures in the extratropics. Results of a simplified general circulation model (GCM) show that the shift of a prescribed tropical heating toward the summer pole, on time scales longer than a few weeks, leads to a more intense cross-equatorial 'winter' Hadley circulation, enhanced upper-level <b>tropical</b> <b>easterlies,</b> and a slightly stronger subtropical winter jet, accompanied by warming at the winter middle and high latitudes {{as a result of}} increased dynamical heating. The indications are that there is a robust connection between the net dynamic heating in the extratropics and the implied changes in the subtropical wind shear resulting from adjustments in the Hadley circulation associated with convective heating displacements in the tropics. The implications are that (1) the low-frequency temporal variability in the Hadley circulation may {{play an important role in}} modulating wave transport in the winter extratropics, (2) the global climate may be sensitive to those processes that control deep cumulus convection in the tropics, and (3) systematic temperature biases in GCMs may be reduced by improving the tropical rainfall simulation...|$|E
30|$|Figure  1 {{compares the}} time-mean states of CNTs with varying α. A {{decrease}} in α (or {{an increase in}} Ts[*]−[*]Td) results in a greater energy transport by the Ekman flux (i.e., larger FE), which then leads {{to a reduction in}} atmospheric energy transport (i.e., smaller FA), as shown in Fig.  1 c. The increase in FE is compensated by the decrease in FA, so that the total transport remains nearly constant with Ts[*]−[*]Td (Fig.  2 a). A smaller FA is accomplished by a weakening of the Hadley circulation mass transport MA (solid lines in Fig.  1 a). As a result, the <b>tropical</b> <b>easterlies</b> become weaker, which then induces a weaker Ekman mass transport ME (dashed lines in Fig.  1 a). This reduction in both MA and ME with Ts[*]−[*]Td can be clearly seen in Fig.  2 b. The weaker MA with larger Ts[*]−[*]Td also causes less moisture convergence in the equatorial region, which leads to a flatter ITCZ (Fig.  1 d). For a sufficiently large Ts[*]−[*]Td, the equatorial cooling induced by the Ekman flux becomes so strong (Fig.  1 b) that the mean meridional atmospheric circulation descends in the equatorial region (Fig.  1 a) to form a strong double ITCZ (Fig.  1 d).|$|E

The proposed scheme is employed to {{examine the effect of}} tropical diabatic heating on the annual variation of subtropical jet streams. Furthermore, the [chi]-maintenance analysis is used to examine how the 30 - 60 day oscillation of planetary-scale divergent circulation is maintained; and the [psi]-budget analysis is performed to illustrate how the 30 - 60 day velocity potential (~[chi]) mode interacts with the upper-level monsoon flow to induce the 30 - 60 day oscillation of the <b>tropical</b> <b>easterly</b> jet;It was found that annual variations of both tropical diabatic heating and planetary-scale divergent circulation exhibit an annual in-phase seesaw oscillation between the winter and summer hemispheres. The annual variation of subtropical jet streams is caused by the adjustment of atmospheric rotational flow through planetary-scale divergent circulation in response to the annual cycle of tropical diabatic heating;The [chi]-maintenance equation is expressed as [chi] = [chi][subscript]sp Q. - [chi][subscript] HA, where [chi][subscript]sp Q. and [chi][subscript] HA are the effects of vertical differential diabatic and adiabatic heating, respectively. The 30 - 60 day [chi] oscillation is shown to be primarily maintained by the differential diabatic heating effect, which can be inferred from the H[subscript] VD anomalies, the Laplician of the filtered [chi][subscript]sp Q. anomalies. The resemblance of the H[subscript] VD and OLR anomalies in terms of the geographic distributions indicates that the differential diabatic heating effect maintaining the 30 - 60 day [chi] oscillation is attributable to the latent heat released by cumulus convection;The synoptic relationship among (~[chi], ∇~[chi]) (200 mb), OLR and ~[psi] (200 mb) makes clear the synchronization of the 30 - 60 day oscillation of the <b>tropical</b> <b>easterly</b> jet and the Somali jet.

50|$|<b>Tropical</b> waves, <b>easterly</b> waves, or <b>tropical</b> <b>easterly</b> waves, {{also known}} as African easterly waves in the Atlantic region, are a type of {{atmospheric}} trough, an elongated area of relatively low air pressure, oriented north to south, which moves {{from east to west}} across the tropics causing areas of cloudiness and thunderstorms. West-moving waves can also form from the tail end of frontal zones in the subtropics and tropics and may be referred to as easterly waves, but these waves are not properly called tropical waves; they are a form of inverted trough sharing many characteristics with fully tropical waves. All tropical waves form in the easterly flow along the equatorward side of the subtropical ridge or belt of high pressure which lies north and south of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). Tropical waves are generally carried westward by the prevailing easterly winds along the tropics and subtropics near the equator.

A local energetics analysis shows that the combination of energy dispersion from the forcing region and energy extraction from the equatorward flank of the midlatitude jet produces disturbances that have the greatest impact on the extratropical circulation.

40|$|Abstract: Observational {{evidence}} {{is presented to}} show an atmosphere-ocean coupled system in the maturing process of the Asian summer monsoon (ASM) and the western Pacific monsoon (WPM). The ASM and WPM are characterized by four abrupt seasonal changes that exhibit phase-locking features in the annual cycle. They correspond to the first transition of the ASM (mid May); the Indian monsoon onset (early June); the mature phase of ITCZ (mid June) {{to the east of}} Philippines and convection jump around 150 •KE (late July). The appearance of a warm pool, in excess of 29. 0 •Ž, {{is one of the key}} elements in understanding the sub-seasonal evolution of the ASM and WPM. Over the Indian Ocean, the seasonal increase of sea surface temperature (SST) follows the solar insolation and reduced evaporative cooling as well. In contrast, increase of SST over the subtropical western Pacific (SWP) lags behind those in the Indian Ocean by about one month. The heat flux analysis at the ocean surface in the SWP reveals that the delayed warming is attributed to reduced evaporative cooling, in relation to the weakening of the <b>tropical</b> <b>easterlies,</b> which is concurrent with the eastward expansion (•` 150 •KE) of the monsoon westerlies. These processes are also valid for interannual fluctuation; namely, the intensified ASM can induce warm SST anomalies over the SWP.

40|$|A {{new class}} of {{persistent}} vacillations of the winter polar vortex, under the action of topographic wave forcing and radiative cooling, is identified in numerical integrations of the rotating shallow water equations. The vacillations are obtained provided only that care is taken to prevent the unconstrained growth of <b>tropical</b> <b>easterlies</b> that otherwise develop {{as the result of}} persistent angular momentum deposition at low latitudes. The vacillation cycle involves purely barotropic dynamics and is characterized by a dynamically controlled rapid splitting and rapid reformation of the vortex followed by a more gradual period of vortex intensification under the influence of radiative relaxation. The onset of the splitting occurs when the frequency of the free mode of the vortex approaches that of the forcing and resembles a resonant excitation. Experiments with an alternative basic state suggest that the vacillations are a robust feature of the topographically forced and radiatively relaxed vortex. In contrast to the behavior found in models with vertical structure, the period of the vacillation cycles here increases with increasing forcing amplitude. A wide range of forcing amplitude exists over which the vortex exhibits distinct regime transitions between a strong, vacillating state and a state in which the vortex is weak and the zonal mean polar flow nearly zero. Comparison with observational reanalysis suggest that the vacillation cycles obtained here may be relevant to the dynamics of some sudden warming events and that the onset of a radiatively dominated regime may be usefully linked to the loss of vortex area following such an event.

40|$|A {{climatology}} of {{air transport}} {{to and from}} Kenya has been developed using kinematic trajectory modeling. Significant months for trajectory analysis have been determined from a classification of synoptic circulation fields. Five-point back and forward trajectory clusters to and from Kenya reveal that the transport corridors to Kenya are clearly bounded and well defined. Air reaching the country originates mainly from the Saharan region and northwestern Indian Ocean of the Arabian Sea in the northern hemisphere and from the Madagascan region of the Indian Ocean in the southern hemisphere. Transport from each of these source regions show distinctive annual cycles related to the northeasterly Asian monsoon and the southeasterly trade wind maximum over Kenya in May. The Saharan transport in the lower troposphere is at a maximum when the subtropical high over northern Africa is strongly developed in the boreal winter. Air reaching Kenya between 700 and 500 hPa is mainly from Sahara and northwest India Ocean flows in the months of January and March, which gives way to southwest Indian Ocean flow in May and November.
