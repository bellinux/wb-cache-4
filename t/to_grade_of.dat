6000|$|In the {{feudal system}} of western Europe these old {{traditional}} customs {{had long been}} modified and stereotyped by written charters. The King gave gifts of land to his kinsmen or officers, who were bound to be [...] "faithful" [...] (fideles); in return the inferior did homage, while he received protection. From grade <b>to</b> <b>grade</b> <b>of</b> rank and wealth each inferior did homage to and received protection from his superior, who was also his judge. In this process, {{what had been the}} Celtic tribe became the new [...] "thanage"; the Celtic king (righ) of the tribe became the thane; the province or group of tribes (say Moray) became the earldom; the Celtic Mormaer of the province became the earl; and the Crown appointed vice- comites, sub-earls, that is sheriffs, who administered the King's justice in the earldom.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} to determine upregulation of the human telomerase RNA component (hTR) and mRNA of the catalytic subunit of telomerase (hTERT) in (pre) malignant cervical lesions, to analyze possible intralesional heterogeneity of hTR expression, and to relate hTR and hTERT mRNA levels to telomerase activity levels and human papillomavirus (HPV) typing. hTR expression was determined by in situ hybridization (ISH) on paraffin-embedded sections, obtained from patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) I-III or cervical cancer and from normal controls. hTR and hTERT mRNA expression were determined by semiquantitative rt-PCR on frozen samples from the same lesions. Data on telomerase activity and HPV were obtained from a previous study. hTR expression as determined by ISH was observed in 0 of 8 normal cervices, 1 of 14 CIN I, 15 of 28 CIN II, 21 of 30 CIN III, and 16 of 18 cervical cancer specimens. In general, hybridization patterns for hTR expression were homogeneous throughout the lesion. Frequency of hTR expression was related <b>to</b> <b>grade</b> <b>of</b> CIN/cervical cancer (P <. 001). hTR expression, as determined by rt-PCR, was detected in 8 of 8 normal cervices, 2 of 2 CIN I, 12 of 14 CIN II, 23 of 23 CIN III, and 16 of 17 cervical cancer specimens. hTERT mRNA was detected in 1 of 8 normal cervices, 1 of 2 CIN I, 5 of 14 CIN II, 14 of 23 CIN III, and 11 of 17 cervical cancer specimens. hTR as determined by rt-PCR was not related <b>to</b> <b>grade</b> <b>of</b> CIN/cervical cancer, whereas hTERT mRNA expression was related <b>to</b> <b>grade</b> <b>of</b> CIN/cervical cancer (P <. 01). hTR expression, as determined by ISH and hTERT mRNA expression by rt-PCR, were related to telomerase activity levels (P <. 001, P <. 05, respectively) and presence of oncogenic types of HPV (both P <. 05). Our data show frequent upregulation of hTR and hTERT mRNA expression in CIN lesions, which appear to occur earlier than induction of telomerase activity. The fact that semiquantitative hTERT mRNA as well as hTR levels are related to telomerase activity levels illustrates that in (pre) malignant cervical lesions upregulation of both telomerase components may be important for functional telomerase.

Using the conjoint measurement technique, attribute worth functions of 30 pilots were constructed.

Serum leptin, soluble leptin receptors (SLR), TNF, IGF and fatty acid (FA) profiles in plasma phosphatidylcholine (PC) were studied as well. Addition of paclitaxel to carboplatin and continual fluorouracil significantly increased toxicity without influencing efficacy of the treatment. Post-operative node negativity, grade of dysphagia, weight loss and serum albumin were proved to be prognostic factors of survival and time to progression. CHRT led to decrease of SLR, palmitoleic and oleic acid and increase of n- 3 polyunsaturated FA in PC. Lower concentrations of SLR were associated with improved survival of the patients.
