40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} how pimaricin and mycostatin improved the keeping quality of cottage cheese. The specific objectives were as follows: (1) to develop a method for the determination of pimaricin and mycostatin in cottage cheese, (2) to determine the stability of <b>the</b> <b>antibiotics</b> in <b>the</b> cheese, (3) to determine the effect of <b>the</b> <b>antibiotics</b> upon <b>the</b> sugar utilization of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and (4) to determine the effect of these antibiotics upon lipolytic microorganisms. Warburg technique trials were made to determine the residual concentrations of <b>the</b> <b>antibiotics</b> in cheese, washed with antibiotic solution, and to determine the stability of <b>the</b> <b>antibiotics</b> during storage at 40 °, 50 °, or 60 °F. In general, the cheeses with the higher concentration of antibiotics and held at the lower storage temperature had the maximum stability. It was observed that mycostatin was less stable and lost its potency more rapidly at the higher storage temperature than pimaricin. <b>The</b> <b>antibiotics</b> retarded <b>the</b> fungal growth and spoilage of cottage cheese. The cheese stored at lower temperature and containing higher concentration of <b>antibiotics</b> had <b>the</b> best keeping quality. A comparison of endogenous oxygen consumption, and the aerobic utilization of lactose, glucose, and galactose by Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in the presence and absence of <b>the</b> <b>antibiotics</b> showed that both of these processes are inhibited by <b>the</b> <b>antibiotics.</b> <b>The</b> results showed that <b>the</b> <b>antibiotics</b> blocked <b>the</b> metabolism of the three sugars approximately at the same extent indicating that the three sugars are metabolized by somewhat similar processes by Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Also, it appears that the inhibition of the growth Saccharomyces cerevisiae, by <b>the</b> <b>antibiotics,</b> may be directly related to the inhibition of the sugar utilization. <b>The</b> <b>antibiotics</b> exhibited extremely mild inhibitory effects upon the cell production of the culture. The microbial lipase was shown to be inhibited by <b>the</b> <b>antibiotics.</b> In general, it was found that pimaricin and mycostatin increased the shelf-life of cottage cheese. <b>The</b> <b>antibiotics</b> seem to be more effective in retarding the spoilage of cheese when added through cream dressing than when added through wash water. In the latter case, <b>the</b> <b>antibiotics</b> are probably retained in cheese by their being adsorbed upon the cheese proteins. The keeping quality of the cheese was maximum at lower temperatures (40 °F.) presumably because <b>the</b> <b>antibiotics</b> were more stable at that temperature. Advisor: Khem M. Shahan...|$|R

5|$|Before the 1980s, the {{prognosis}} or expected outcome of DPB was poor, especially in cases with superinfection (the {{emergence of a}} new viral or bacterial infection, in addition to the currently occurring infection) by P.aeruginosa.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>antibiotic</b> {{rifaximin}} may be {{recommended in}} addition to lactulose for those with recurrent disease. It is a nonabsorbable antibiotic from the rifamycin class. This is thought {{to work in a}} similar way to other antibiotics, but without the complications attached to neomycin or metronidazole. Due to the long history and lower cost of lactulose use, rifaximin is generally only used as a second-line treatment if lactulose is poorly tolerated or not effective. When rifaximin is added to lactulose, the combination of the two may be more effective than each component separately. Rifaximin is more expensive than lactulose, but the cost may be offset by reduced hospital admissions for encephalopathy.|$|E

5|$|Ascocoryne sarcoides is {{a species}} of fungus in the family Helotiaceae. The species name {{is derived from the}} Greek sarkodes (fleshy). Formerly known as Coryne sarcoides, its taxonomical history has been {{complicated}} by the fact that it may adopt both sexual and asexual forms. Colloquially known as jelly drops or the purple jellydisc, this common fungus appears as a gelatinous mass of pinkish or purple-colored discs. Distributed widely in North America, Europe and Asia, A.sarcoides is a saprobic fungus and grows in clusters on the trunks and branches of a variety of dead woods. Field studies suggest that colonization by A.sarcoides of the heartwood of black spruce confers some resistance to further infection by rot-causing fungi. A.sarcoides contains <b>the</b> <b>antibiotic</b> compound ascocorynin, shown in the laboratory to inhibit the growth of several Gram-positive bacteria.|$|E
5|$|Many drugs, {{including}} oral contraceptives, some antibiotics, antidepressants, and antifungal agents, inhibit cytochrome enzymes in the liver. They {{reduce the}} rate of elimination of the benzodiazepines that are metabolized by CYP450, leading to possibly excessive drug accumulation and increased side-effects. In contrast, drugs that induce cytochrome P450 enzymes, such as St John's wort, <b>the</b> <b>antibiotic</b> rifampicin, and the anticonvulsants carbamazepine and phenytoin, accelerate elimination of many benzodiazepines and decrease their action. Taking benzodiazepines with alcohol, opioids and other central nervous system depressants potentiates their action. This often results in increased sedation, impaired motor coordination, suppressed breathing, and other adverse effects that have potential to be lethal. Antacids can slow down absorption of some benzodiazepines; however, this effect is marginal and inconsistent.|$|E
