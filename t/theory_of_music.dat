40|$|Ibn al-Munajjim {{lived in}} Abbasid Era in which music became {{a branch of}} science inIslamic Civilization. He wrote two {{valuable}} books on the <b>theories</b> <b>of</b> <b>music.</b> He came from“Müneccimoğulları family” known by its affinity to palace, {{and he was also}} an authority inArabic-Persian sciences. His teacher Ishâq al-MawsılÄ« was considered as the founder <b>of</b> thetheories <b>of</b> <b>music</b> in Islamic world; but his Works didn't reach us. And this increased thevalue of al-Munajjim's work, because his Risâla fi'l-MûsÄ«qâ gives detailed and importantinformations about the <b>theories</b> <b>of</b> <b>music</b> <b>of</b> that period. In researches on history of musicdone in western and Arab world Ibn al-Munajjim's Risâla was mistakenly mixed up by hiswork Kitâbu'n-Nagam.

25|$|At age 19, Bell wrote {{a report}} on his work {{and sent it to}} philologist Alexander Ellis, a {{colleague}} of his father (who would later be portrayed as Professor Henry Higgins in Pygmalion).

25|$|The Kitab al-Adwār is {{the first}} extant work on {{scientific}} music theory after the writings on music of Avicenna. It contains valuable information on the practice and <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>music</b> in the Perso-ʿIraqi area, such as the factual establishment of the five-stringed lute (still an exception in Avicenna’s time), the final stage in {{the division of the}} octave into 17 steps, the complete nomenclature and definition of the scales constituting the system of the twelve Makams (called shudūd) and the six Awāz modes. It also contains precise depictions of contemporary musical metres, and the use of letters and numbers for the notation of melodies. It {{is the first}} time that this occurs in history, making it a unique work of greatest value. Al-Urmawi's 'international' modal system was intended to represent the predominant Arab and Persian local musical traditions.|$|E
25|$|In 1524 he was {{appointed}} headmaster of St. Jerome's in Liège. The Liège grammar school flourished due to activities of both Macropedius and others. In 1527 Macropedius returned to 's-Hertogenbosch {{and by the end}} of 1530 Macropedius had already moved to Utrecht, at the time the largest city in the northern part of the Netherlands. Macropedius, who apparently enjoyed some fame at the time and was reputed to be a loyal Roman Catholic, {{was appointed}} headmaster. He transformed St. Jerome's in Utrecht into the most famous school in the country. He taught Latin, Greek, poetry, rhetoric, and possibly Hebrew, mathematics and <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>music,</b> too. Every year he composed both text and music of a lengthy Latin school song.

25|$|Tobey {{expected}} to return to teaching in England in 1938, but the mounting tensions of war building in Europe kept him in the US. Instead, he began {{to work on the}} Federal Art Project, under the supervision of Inverarity. In June 1939, when Tobey attended a Bahá'í summer program and overstayed his allotted vacation time, Inverarity dropped him from the Works Progress Administration (WPA) project. Tobey met the Swedish scholar, Pehr Hallsten (died 1965, Basel), in Ballard in 1939 and they became companions, living together from 1940. By 1942, Tobey's process of abstractionism was accompanied by a new calligraphic experiment. Marian Willard of the Willard Gallery in New York had seen some of Tobey's WPA paintings and gave him a show in 1944, which was considered to be a major success. In 1945, he gave a solo exhibition at the Portland Art Museum in Oregon, and the Arts Club of Chicago held solo shows of his work in 1940 and 1946. He studied the piano and the <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>music</b> with Lockrem Johnson, and, when Johnson was away, with Wesley Wehr, who was introduced to Tobey in 1949 by their pianist friend Berthe Poncy Jacobson. Wehr, an undergraduate at the time, happily accepted the opportunity to serve as a stand-in music composition tutor for Tobey and over time became friends with him and his circle of artists, becoming a painter himself, as well as a chronicler of the group.|$|E
25|$|The society {{provided}} school examinations such as arithmetic, geography, history, grammar, drawing, Latin, French, algebra and bookkeeping. In early 1885, Henry Valentine Goold {{presented the}} prizes at St John's College, Grimsargh, Preston, Lancashire, where {{the boys had}} taken the Society's exams and the principal, Reverend T. Abbott Peters, M.A., was a Fellow of the Society. In 1886 at the Convent of Jesus and Mary, Ipswich, all eighteen pupils who took examinations passed with honour certificates or honours in individual subjects, such as French, music, botany, bookkeeping, English, German and drawing. In 1887, nineteen out of the twenty candidates at St. Joseph's College, Weston Hall, Rugby passed the exam and received the Society's certificate. In the same year at the Ursuline Convent, Upton, Essex, most pupils took the Society's exams. Many candidates obtained maximum marks, some earned Honours, and one candidate Miss Winifred Wilson received a silver medallion. In 1890 at St Rose's Convent School, Stroud, its female pupils {{took part in a}} competition and exhibition of work which was posted to the Society's Kensington base. Two girls obtained certificates with honours for their oil paintings: E. Hanman and Nellie Mackey. Mary Culler won the same for her map drawing. The pupils took the Society's exams in nine subjects, including scripture, grammar, freehand and model drawing, French, <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>music,</b> history and literature, with Hanman and Mackey winning Honours while Gertie McKay aged 12 received a certificate too. In 1891, the Society was cited as the exam board for Euston College, England, in its prospectus.|$|E
500|$|Major-thirds tuning {{is closely}} related to minor-sixths tuning, which is the regular tuning that is based on the minor sixth, the {{interval}} of eight semitones. Either ascending by a major third or by descending by a minor sixth, one arrives at the same pitch class, the same note representing pitches in different octaves. Intervals paired like the pair of major-third and minor-sixth intervals are termed [...] "inverse intervals" [...] in the <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>music.</b> Consequently, chord charts for minor-sixths tunings may be used for left-handed major-thirds tunings; conversely, chord charts for major-thirds tunings may be used for left-handed minor-sixths tunings.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an automatic system <b>of</b> <b>music</b> analysis {{based on the}} generative <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> tonal <b>music</b> (GTTM).

To solve this problem, we introduced adjustable parameters, enabling us to assign priority to the rules. Our GTTM-based system makes it possible to construct hierarchical metrical structures in a top-down process using bottom-up detection of local metrical strength. Experimental results showed that after these parameters were tuned, our method outperformed the baseline performance. 1...|$|R

500|$|At {{the same}} time, Andrade was {{refining}} his <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>music.</b> [...] He attempted {{to pull together}} his research into a general theory. [...] Concerned as always with Modernismo's need to break from the past, he formulated {{a distinction between the}} classical music of 18th- and 19th-century Europe, and what he called the music of the future, which would be based simultaneously on modernist breakdowns of musical form and on an understanding of folk and popular music. [...] The music of the past, he said, was conceived in terms of space: whether counterpoint, with its multiple voices arranged in vertical alignment, or the symphonic forms, in which the dominant voice is typically projected on top of a complex accompaniment. [...] Future music would be arranged in time rather than space: [...] "moment by moment" [...] (in Luper's translation). [...] This temporal music would be inspired not by [...] "contemplative remembrance", but by the deep longing or desire expressed by the Portuguese word saudade.|$|E
500|$|Until he was fifteen, Elgar {{received}} a general education at Littleton (now Lyttleton) House school, near Worcester. However, his only formal musical training beyond piano and violin lessons from local teachers consisted of more advanced violin studies with Adolf Pollitzer, during brief visits to London in 1877–78. Elgar said, [...] "my first music was learnt in the Cathedral ... from books {{borrowed from the}} music library, when I was eight, nine or ten." [...] He worked through manuals of instruction on organ playing and read every book he could find on the <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>music.</b> He later {{said that he had}} been most helped by Hubert Parry's articles in the Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians. Elgar began to learn German, in the hope of going to the Leipzig Conservatory for further musical studies, but his father could not afford to send him. Years later, a profile in The Musical Times considered that his failure to get to Leipzig was fortunate for Elgar's musical development: [...] "Thus the budding composer escaped the dogmatism of the schools." [...] However, it was a disappointment to Elgar that on leaving school in 1872 he went not to Leipzig but to the office of a local solicitor as a clerk. He did not find an office career congenial, and for fulfilment he turned not only to music but to literature, becoming a voracious reader. Around this time, he made his first public appearances as a violinist and organist.|$|E

[...] His approach also included the idea of “total theater,” which centers on creative and educational audience participation. [...] He also made use of ethnic and folk melodies in his theory training, especially as an aid to student composition.

From both he received at different times some pecuniary reward for these communications, and was favoured by the loan of some books. Among those which he borrowed of Mr. Barrett, there were several on medical subjects; and from him he obtained also some instructions in chirurgery.
