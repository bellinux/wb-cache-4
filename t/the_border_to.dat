Foreign military personnel were restricted from approaching <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>to</b> avoid clashes or other unwanted incidents.

No such restriction applied to Western civilians, who were free {{to go up to}} the border line, and {{there were no}} physical obstacles to stop their crossing it.|$|E
5|$|After {{the opening}} up of China from the 1980s, tomb robbery was rampant and many {{artifacts}} were looted and smuggled across <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>to</b> Hong Kong, then a British territory.

5|$|In the {{following}} years, Northumberland occasionally {{served with the}} king in France, but his main occupation was the protection of <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>to</b> Scotland. At the same time, a feud with the Neville family was developing, particularly with Richard Neville, Earl of Salisbury. This feud became entangled with {{the conflict between the}} Duke of York and the Duke of Somerset over control of national government.

5|$|On 14 October 1920, Finland and Soviet Russia {{signed the}} Treaty of Tartu, {{confirming}} the new Finnish-Soviet border {{as the old}} border between the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland and Imperial Russia proper. In addition, Finland received Petsamo, with its ice-free harbour on the Arctic Ocean. The treaty did not prevent the Finnish government from allowing volunteers to cross <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>to</b> support the East-Karelian Uprising in 1921 however, nor expatriate Finnish communists from causing disturbances in Finland. In 1923 both countries signed the Border Peace Agreement, which normalized the border.|$|E

5|$|The {{closure of}} the border region for nearly 40years created a haven for {{wildlife}} in some places. Although parts of the East German {{side of the border}} were farmed, intensive farming of the kind practised elsewhere in Germany was absent and large areas were untouched by agriculture. Conservationists became aware as early as the 1970s that the border had become a refuge for rare species of animals and plants. Their findings led the Bavarian government to begin a programme of buying land along <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>to</b> ensure its protection from development.|$|E
5|$|A {{native of}} Dundee, Crumley began his {{football}} career with Junior club Harp, {{from where he}} moved into the senior ranks, spending the 1911–12 Scottish League season with Dundee Hibernian. He played in America for two seasons, then returned to Scotland where he kept goal for Central League team Arbroath before serving with the Royal Engineers during the First World War. He resumed his football career with a brief return to Dundee Hibs, then moved south of <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>to</b> play for Swansea Town, initially in the Southern League and then for three seasons in the English Football League. This {{was followed by a}} year with Bristol City, two seasons with Darlington, whom he helped gain promotion to the Second Division, and three years with Bournemouth & Boscombe Athletic where he finished his career.|$|E

In January 1943, however, the unit received orders to move to Gibraltar, where they were stationed as a precaution in case Germany decided to invade Spain. While there the commanding officer, John Durnford-Slater, carried out reconnaissance of potential targets in Spain from the air and sent officers on leave across <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>to</b> gather intelligence.|$|E

5|$|Anderson had a final {{meeting with}} the Schanzkowski family in 1938. Gertrude Schanzkowska was insistent that Anderson was her sister, Franziska, but the Nazi {{government}} had arranged the meeting to determine Anderson's identity, and if accepted as Schanzkowska she would be imprisoned. The Schanzkowski family refused to sign affidavits against her, and no further action was taken. In 1939, World War II began with Germany's attack on the western half of Poland. In 1940, Edward Fallows died virtually destitute after wasting all his own money on trying to obtain the Tsar's non-existent fortune for the Grandanor Corporation. Towards {{the end of the}} war, Anderson lived at Schloss Winterstein with Louise of Saxe-Meiningen, in what became the Soviet occupation zone. In 1946, Prince Frederick of Saxe-Altenburg helped her across <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>to</b> Bad Liebenzell in the French occupation zone.|$|E
5|$|As one of {{the main}} {{military}} leaders on <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>to</b> Scotland, Harclay became frustrated with Edward II's inactivity, particularly the humiliating English defeat at the Battle of Old Byland on 14 October 1322, which {{made it clear that the}} war could not be won. Harclay initiated negotiations with the Scots on his own accord, and on 3 January 1323, he signed a peace treaty with Robert the Bruce. The act was without royal sanction, and amounted to treason. The king issued an arrest order for the earl, and on 25 February Harclay was taken into the king's custody. He was arraigned before royal justices on 3 March, denied a hearing, and executed the same day. He was hanged, drawn and quartered, and the various parts of his body displayed in different parts of the country. Only after five years was he allowed a proper burial, but the conviction for treason was never annulled.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the Second World War, the East German side of {{the border}} was guarded {{initially}} by the Border Troops (Pogranichnyie Voiska) of the Soviet NKVD (later the KGB). They were supplemented from 1946 by a locally recruited paramilitary force, the German Border Police (Deutsche Grenzpolizei or DGP), before the Soviets handed over full control of <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>to</b> the East Germans in 1955/56. In 1961, the DGP was converted into a military force within the National People's Army (Nationale Volksarmee, NVA). The newly renamed Border Troops of the GDR (Grenztruppen der DDR, commonly nicknamed the Grenzer) came under the NVA's Border Command or Grenzkommando. They were responsible for securing and defending the borders with West Germany, Czechoslovakia, Poland, the Baltic Sea and West Berlin. At their peak, the Grenztruppen had up to 50,000personnel.|$|E

5|$|In 1940, Cluj, {{along with}} the rest of Northern Transylvania, became part of Miklós Horthy's Hungary through the Second Vienna Award arbitrated by Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. After the Germans {{occupied}} Hungary in March 1944 and installed a puppet government under Döme Sztójay, they forced large-scale antisemitic measures in the city. The headquarters of the local Gestapo were located in the New York Hotel. That May, the authorities began the relocation of the Jews to the Iris ghetto. Liquidation of the 16,148 captured Jews occurred through six deportations to Auschwitz in May–June 1944. Despite facing severe sanctions from the Hungarian administration, some Jews escaped across <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>to</b> Romania, with the assistance of intellectuals such as Emil Hațieganu, Raoul Șorban, Aurel Socol and Dezső Miskolczy, as well as various peasants from Mănăștur.|$|E
5|$|Soon thereafter, {{a number}} of A-10 ground-attack {{aircraft}} arrived but {{found it difficult to}} pinpoint enemy targets and began dropping flares to illuminate the zone. One of these flares landed on a friendly vehicle, and although the vehicle radioed in its position, it was hit by an AGM-65 Maverick air-to-ground missile that killed the entire crew except for the driver. Following the incident, the company was withdrawn and the remaining vehicles reorganized into another nearby company. With observation post 4 cleared, the Iraqi 6th Armored Brigade withdrew over <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>to</b> Al-Wafrah under heavy fire from Coalition aircraft. Coalition forces had lost 11 troops to friendly fire and none to enemy action.|$|E
5|$|The 130th Engineer Brigade mobilized {{in support}} of the Global War on Terrorism in 2003. It was {{commanded}} by Colonel Gregg F. Martin. As preparations were being made for Operation Iraqi Freedom, the 130th Engineer Brigade was placed in charge of the largest engineering force in the theater. This included seven different engineering battalions as well as several separate group and company sized elements. Units of the brigade were then deployed to Kuwait in early 2003, along with much of V Corps' staff. They would provide command and assistance for the 3rd Infantry Division, 82nd Airborne Division and 101st Airborne Division as they crossed <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>to</b> Iraq and attacked to the capitol region of Baghdad from the south. Coupled with the landings of the 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team to the north, the operation would see the US Forces surround and destroy Iraqi forces in and around the capitol.|$|E
