Monthly Weather Review [...] Roughly 15 minutes after the Elgin tornado formed, a violent F4 tornado tore through Will and Cook Counties, producing a path 53 mi long in the Bellwood and Maywood areas. The tornado first destroyed five homes, two frame schools, and at least 12 barns as it passed from Channahon to Troy and then Lockport. It skipped thereafter, possibly dissipating and redeveloping into a second tornado, as it caused minor damage in the Romeoville area. Afterward, the tornado funnel was not seen for some time.|$|E

5000|$|Other colors occur {{naturally}} in clouds. Bluish-grey {{is the result}} of light scattering within the cloud. In the visible spectrum, blue and green are at the short end of light's visible wavelengths, while red and yellow are at the long end. [...] The short rays are more easily scattered by water droplets, and the long rays {{are more likely to be}} absorbed. The bluish color is evidence that such scattering is being produced by rain-sized droplets in the cloud. A greenish tinge to a cloud is produced when sunlight is scattered by ice. A cumulonimbus cloud emitting green is a sign that it is a severe thunderstorm, capable of heavy rain, hail, strong winds and possible <b>tornadoes.</b> Yellowish <b>clouds</b> may occur in the late spring through early fall months during forest fire season. The yellow color is due to the presence of pollutants in the smoke. Yellowish clouds caused by the presence of nitrogen dioxide are sometimes seen in urban areas with high air pollution levels.|$|R
5|$|Cumulus humilis clouds usually {{indicate}} fair weather. Cumulus mediocris {{clouds are}} similar, {{except that they}} have some vertical development, which implies that they can grow into cumulus congestus or even cumulonimbus clouds, which can produce heavy rain, lightning, severe winds, hail, and even <b>tornadoes.</b> Cumulus congestus <b>clouds,</b> which appear as towers, will often grow into cumulonimbus storm clouds.

25|$|A {{squall line}} is an {{organized}} line of thunderstorms. It {{is classified as}} a multi-cell cluster, meaning a thunderstorm complex comprising many individual updrafts. They are also called multi-cell lines. Squalls are sometimes associated with hurricanes or other cyclones, {{but they can also}} occur independently. Most commonly, independent squalls occur along front lines, and may contain heavy precipitation, hail, frequent lightning, dangerous straight line winds, and possibly funnel <b>clouds,</b> <b>tornadoes</b> and waterspouts. Squall lines require significant low-level warmth and humidity, a nearby frontal zone, and vertical wind shear from an angle behind the frontal boundary. The strong winds at the surface are usually a reflection of dry air intruding into the line of storms, which when saturated, falls quickly to ground level due to its much higher density before it spreads out downwind. Significant squall lines with multiple bow echoes are known as derechos.|$|R
50|$|A {{series of}} tornadoes, which {{occurred}} in May 2013, caused severe devastation to Oklahoma City in general. The first tornado outbreaks occurred on May 18 to May 21 when {{a series of}} tornadoes hit. From one of the storms developed a tornado which was later rated EF5, which traveled across parts of the Oklahoma City area, causing a severe amount of disruption. This tornado was first spotted in Newcastle. It touched the ground for 39 minutes, crossing through a heavily populated section of Moore. Winds with this tornado peaked at 210 mph. Twenty-three fatalities and 377 injuries were caused by the tornado. Sixty-one other tornadoes were confirmed during the storm period. Later on in the same month, {{on the night of}} May 31, 2013, another eight deaths were confirmed from what became the widest tornado on record which hit El Reno, Oklahoma, {{one of a series of}} <b>tornadoes</b> and funnel <b>clouds</b> which hit nearby areas.|$|R
40|$|On 6 September 1994, an {{isolated}} thunderstorm over south-ern Virginia split into separate left-moving and right-moving thunderstorms {{with respect to}} the mean 0 - 6 km wind. The left-mover maintained its strength longer than the right-mover, and each storm produced large hail along their respective storm paths. An analysis {{of the structure of the}} thunderstorms was pel/ormed through an examination of products from the Weather Surveillance Radar- 1988 Doppler located in Wake-field, Virginia. The structure of the thunderstorms, with respect to base reflectivity and internal wind structure, indicated char-acteristically high reflectivity returns, cyclonic rotation in the right-moving storm and anticyclonic rotation in the left-moving storm. However, the left- and right-moving storms also exhib-ited oppositely rotating regions within each respective thunder-storm, possibly induced by each storm's stronger dominant rotation. Also, low-le vel rotational velocities associated with the thunderstorms were indicative of possible tornadic activity yet <b>tornadoes</b> or funnel <b>clouds</b> were not observed. The absence of tornadic activity was most likely due to an unfavorable vertical wind profile in the storm-scale environment and the lack of depth of the circulations. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{severe weather}} {{characteristics}} of convective storms as observed by the Nimbus 7 Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR) are investigated. Low 37 GHz brightness temperatures (due to scattering of upwelling radiation by precipitation size ice) {{are related to}} the occurrence of severe weather (large hail, strong winds or wind damage, <b>tornadoes</b> and funnel <b>clouds)</b> within one hour of the satellite observation time. During 1979 and 1980 over the United States there were 263 storms which had very cold 37 GHz signatures. Of these storms 15 % were severe. The SMMR detected hail, wind, and tornadic storms equally well. Critical Success Indices (CSI's) of 0. 32, 0. 48, and 0. 38 are achieved for the thresholding of severe vs. nonsevere low brightness temperature events during 1979, 1980, and the two years combined, respectively. Such scores are comparable to skill scores for early radar detection methods. These results suggest that a future geostationary passive microwave imaging capability at 37 GHz, with sufficient spatial and temporal resolution, would allow the detection of severe convective storms. This capability would provide a useful complement to radar, especially in areas not covered by radar...|$|R
5000|$|The {{third and}} final F4 tornado to affect Illinois this day was also the deadliest tornado of the entire outbreak. An intense {{supercell}} with a hook echo on weather radar first appeared about 18 mi west-northwest of Joliet at 4:45 p.m. CDT. Later, at 5:15 p.m., {{an employee of the}} U.S. Weather Bureau observed a rotating wall cloud about 10 mi north of Joliet. Minutes later, severe thunderstorm winds blew out windows in a building, though no <b>tornado</b> or funnel <b>cloud</b> had yet occurred. Near the Little Red Schoolhouse, in what is now the Forest Preserve District of Cook County, an observer first noted a funnel cloud to the south, moving east with hail up to [...]75 in in diameter—but he was unable to report to the Weather Bureau as his telephone failed to give a dial tone. At 5:24 p.m. CDT, a tornado touched down at the present-day campus of Moraine Valley Community College [...] and moved east-northeast, mainly at 70° heading. As it touched down, the tornado bent power poles and blew down small trees and vegetation, tossing dirt as it went. It then grew in size to 450 ft wide and entered Palos Hills, destroying about five buildings—including two frame homes and a brick home—and snapping trees. Subsequently, the intensifying funnel severely damaged homes and a drive-in theater in a half-block-wide area of the Chicago Ridge.|$|R
50|$|Activity started {{early on}} the morning of February 21. The first tornadoes touched down in Texas east of Austin and north of Waco. The main {{activity}} intensified during the afternoon over the Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys until the late evening hours. The first of the three long-lived violent tornadoes was an F5 that touched down in Louisiana and traveled continuously for 102 mi, followed by an F4 in Mississippi that produced continuous damage for 159 mi and continued into Tennessee. A third, F4 tornado traveled 65 mi through Little Yazoo, Mississippi, and near Lexington. The three violent tornadoes moved at up to 55 mi/h km/h, and eyewitnesses reported more than 50 <b>tornadoes</b> or funnel <b>clouds</b> in the Mississippi Delta region alone, many of which were sightings of the same tornado. Although authorities issued timely warnings—with average lead times of 50 minutes in the worst-hit areas—few homes in the area were well constructed, and many lacked basements or other safe areas, thus contributing to the large number of deaths. Many residents were reportedly aware of the danger but could not find shelter in time. As a result, the violent tornadoes killed entire families and caused as many as 21 deaths in some communities. Many of the dead were blacks living in frail structures. In Mississippi alone, tornadoes officially killed 110 people (107 in some sources) and injured 1,469 (officially 1,060); of these, 454 persons were hospitalized.|$|R
40|$|Electromagnetic {{noise from}} six {{convective}} storms in Iowa {{has been studied}} {{at a variety of}} frequencies from 0. 67 to 144 MHz, with the majority of the data being recorded at 53 MHz. The quasi-static atmospheric electric field was also studied. Twelve <b>tornadoes,</b> numerous funnel <b>clouds</b> and several hailstorms occurred during these storms. Eleven of the tornadoes appear to correlate with some type of enhancement of the recorded electromagnetic pulse rate. A spectacular peak in pulse rate during Storm No. 5 is attributed to a brief but destructive tornado at 38 km; the event is discussed in detail. One tornado at long range, the longest lived of the season, showed no correlation and is thought to represent a minority class of tornadoes which exhibit little electromagnetic noise generation. Good time correlation is also achieved between data events and several hailstorms and funnel clouds. Except for the closest events (3 ̆c 20 km), the region above 1 MHZ appears to be a better indicator of tornadic activity than that portion of the radio spectrum below 1 MHz. The data also reveal a number of pulse-rate peaks which could not be correlated with known severe weather events. Four and possibly five types of radio noise observed from severe storms are described, along with some initial suggestions about the possible mechanisms involved. The lack of understanding of the basic physics involved is indicated and the need for more observational data is emphasized...|$|R
