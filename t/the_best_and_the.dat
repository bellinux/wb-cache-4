The party established its own English-language paper, The National Socialist, in May 1878 but managed to keep the publication alive only one year. The year 1878 saw the establishment of a more enduring newspaper: the German-language New Yorker Volkszeitung (New York People's News). The Volkszeitung included material by <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> brightest of the German-American socialist movement, including Alexander Jonas, Adolph Douai, and Sergei Shevitch, and Herman Schlüter and quickly emerged as the leading voice of the SLP during the last decades of the 19th century.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the eve of}} the 1998 season, Krause {{said his}} most famous, and most misquoted, statement: ‘Players and coaches alone don’t win championships. Organizations do’ which was often paraphrased to “Organizations win championships”. [...] Years later in an {{interview}} with Adrian Wojnarowski of Yahoo! Sports, Krause clarified the statement, making [...] "the point was that the Bulls were more than one great player, and he of course was right. The Bulls won championships four, five, and six not just because they had <b>the</b> <b>best</b> player but because they had <b>the</b> <b>best</b> second-best player <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> rebounder <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> sixth man <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> pure shooter <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> coach <b>and,</b> yes, <b>the</b> <b>best</b> general manager".

25|$|Itagaki is {{thorough}} {{with his}} games, working on them {{from start to}} release, and even post release to correct what he feels are deficiencies, and polish them up to their full potential. He has shown this in his project developments, such as pushing back the release of Dead or Alive 4 just to polish the game based on feedback of top Japanese Dead or Alive players recruited to test it out. For Ninja Gaiden, he wanted to leave <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ultimate action game on the Xbox {{before moving on to}} the Xbox 360, thus he reworked the game and integrated the additional downloadable content to produce Ninja Gaiden Black. With Dead or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball, he chose to patch an easy-cash exploit rather than leaving it alone and ruminating over the consequences.|$|E

500|$|At {{the same}} time as he sought to reform the coinage, Sherman worked for [...] "resumption"—the policy of {{resuming}} specie payment on all bank notes, including the greenbacks. The idea of withdrawing the greenbacks from circulation altogether had been tried and quickly rejected in 1866; the notes were, as Sherman said, [...] "a great favorite of the people". The economic turmoil of the Panic of 1873 made it even more clear that shrinking the money supply would be harmful to the average American. Still, Sherman (and others) desired an eventual return to a single circulating medium: gold. As he said in an 1874 speech, [...] "a specie standard is <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> only true standard of all values, recognized as such by all civilized nations of our generation". If greenbacks were not to be withdrawn from circulation, therefore, they must be made equal to the gold dollar.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} positive reviews. Dennis Perkins of The A.V.

He was impressed by how the Kubrick references in the second segment used originality rather than being a [...] "perfunctory checklist", and how the director's [...] "ow" [...] at the end had [...] "comic aplomb". Writing for the New York Daily News, Don Kaplan gave the episode four stars out of five, singling the third segment out as the best, and deeming the Kubrick homage [...] "smart and silly". A more mixed review came from Alex Strachan on Postmedia News' Canada.com, who found the second segment to be <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> other two to be average, although he admitted that the Kubrick references were [...] "occasionally a little too inside or self-indulgent for their own good".

500|$|Hill {{attended}} Fullerton College in {{the late}} 1970s, {{but she did not}} have a strong interest in any academic subject; instead she was focused on climbing. In the summers of 1976–78 and the early 1980s Hill frequently camped at Camp 4 in Yosemite Valley, becoming part of the climbing community centered there and joining the search and rescue team. In her autobiography, Hill describes the community as [...] "a ragged occupying army, annoying park rangers by eluding camp fees, overstaying their welcome, and comporting themselves like gypsies". As Hill describes it, climbing {{in the late}} 1970s and early 1980s was [...] "something that people who were outcasts in society did, people who were not conformists". As she had earlier, Hill worked {{in order to be able}} to climb. One summer, she writes, she survived in Camp 4 on only $75. In her autobiography, she describes how climbers eked out a life at the camp, recycling cans to pay for climbing ropes and subsisting on condiments and left-over food from tourists. However, Hill remembers [...] "these dirt-poor days... among <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> most carefree of my life, and though my friends were often scoundrels, I felt their friendship convincingly." ...|$|E

He continued, [...] "Her music mixes an almost impersonal professionalism — it's so rigorously crafted {{it sounds like it}} has been scientifically engineered in a hit factory — with confessions that are squirmingly intimate and true." [...] Jonathon Keefe of Slant Magazine considered the bridge one of the nicer moments of Fearless, but was unimpressed with Swift's singing, particularly in the outro. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic found [...] "Fifteen", in which Swift portrayed the role of a big sister instead of a big star, to be one of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> most personal song on Fearless. Ken Tucker of Billboard magazine believed [...] "Fifteen" [...] could appeal with teenagers looking for hope and adult women reminiscing the past.

500|$|The {{film has}} been {{described}} by CBS News, Rotten Tomatoes, and ComingSoon.com as a science fiction cult classic.

Kermode recalled his own experience: [...] "I remember very clearly being in Cannes when [...] Fifth Element was first played, and it really divided the audience." [...] Stephen Cass of Discover ranked the film the third-best science fiction film on subscription service Hulu, writing, [...] "People seem to either like or loathe The Fifth Element ...Lavish visuals and entertaining performances from Bruce Willis, Milla Jovovich, and Gary Oldman make this movie worth watching." [...] In some circles the film has gained a [...] "so-bad-it's-good" [...] status; Meredith Woerner of io9 listed The Fifth Element as one of [...] "The 20 Best Worst Science Fiction Movies of All Time". In 2007 the Visual Effects Society placed The Fifth Element at No. 50, tied with Darby O'Gill and the Little People, on their list of the 50 most influential visual effects films of all time.

500|$|While {{the book}} Lone Survivor chronicles Marcus Luttrell's 1999 {{enlistment}} and training, {{as well as}} his 2005 deployment to Afghanistan, Berg decided that the film adaptation would focus mainly on the events of the failed United States Navy SEALs mission Operation Red Wings, as well as the bonding and camaraderie of Luttrell and his fallen teammates. Prior to writing the screenplay, Berg met with the families of the deceased. [...] "My research started with meeting the families of the SEAL teammates who were killed", he said. [...] "I went to New York and met the Murphys. I went to Colorado and met the Dietzes, and I went to Northern California and met the Axelsons. After spending time with them, you realize that these kids were <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> brightest; they were the stars of the families. The grief and the wounds are still very raw. You would have to be inhuman to not feel the responsibility when that kind of grief gets shared with you." [...] Berg also expressed that he was motivated by the families to make the story as realistic as possible; his goal was [...] "to put [...] into the experience of what these guys went through. And it was obviously a traumatic and violent and exhausting experience".|$|E
