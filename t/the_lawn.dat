5|$|Jerold J. Abrams and Elizabeth F. Cooke, in {{the book}} The Philosophy of TV Noir argue that the episode {{stresses}} abductive reasoning, a type of logic that goes from data or a description of something to a hypothesis that accounts for the reliable data and seeks to explain relevant evidence. Abductive reasoning follows the logic: a surprising fact, C, is observed (Result); If A, the hypothesis, were true, C would make perfect sense (Rule); Thus, {{there is reason to}} suspect that A is true (Case). An example that has been given is: <b>the</b> <b>lawn</b> is wet. But if it is raining, then it would be unsurprising that <b>the</b> <b>lawn</b> is wet. Therefore, it is raining. This logical method is favored by Mulder throughout most of the show. In this episode, however, it is Scully who first uses the method. She takes three separate facts—the massive size of some types of mushrooms, the hallucinogenic properties of some fungi, and the carnivorous nature of certain types of plants—and formulates an abductive conclusion: she and Mulder are trapped underground, experiencing a hallucination, and slowly being digested.|$|E
