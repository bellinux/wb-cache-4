5|$|Both {{species have}} {{distinctive}} loud grating calls used for advertising and territorial purposes in the breeding season, although the corn crake is silent on its African wintering grounds. They are mainly active during the day; they walk with a high-stepping action, and when disturbed <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>run</b> swiftly through grass or fly {{a short distance}} to cover. Migration takes place at night, {{and the ability to}} undertake these journeys is innate, not learned from adults. The nest is a shallow cup of grass lined with finer vegetation and built in a well hidden depression. The precocial chicks leave the nest soon after hatching, and fledge after four to six weeks. These are ground-feeding omnivores, but mainly eat invertebrates. They may be killed by a variety of mammals and large birds, and infected by parasites.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, all twelve T2000 {{units were}} taken out of service, before {{the last of the}} much older T1300. Kollektivtransportproduksjon, the {{successor}} of Oslo Sporveier, stated that procuring spare parts was becoming nearly impossible and that the small size of the series forced high maintenance costs. The initial orders for MX3000 trains did not call for sufficient numbers to replace the T2000. Kollektivtransportproduksjon has estimated the cost of renovating the units so <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>run</b> for 15 more years at NOK50 million. Alternatively, the city council has been recommended by Kollektivtransportproduksjon to purchase 15 new MX3000 three-car trains for NOK250 million.|$|E
5|$|The {{more typical}} soldier types of the Gorn are the Initiates, Warriors and Guardians. The former {{are the basic}} troops of the Gorn forces, and while <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>run</b> on four legs, they fight on two with an {{automatic}} rifle called the Ravager. The Warriors are more advanced, and carry a variety of weaponry along with basic armor. The Guardian type differs {{in that it is}} a melee type, armed with a large energy axe. However, the energy from the axe can also produce a shield to protect the holder as well. They are more advanced than both the Initiate and the Warrior classes in that they spend the vast majority of their time on two feet only. Of these fifteen classes, three were created to appear female.|$|E
50|$|These races {{must have}} minimum prize money of £5,000. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> be <b>run</b> with one, {{two or three}} rounds but must be {{completed}} within a 15-day period.|$|R

50|$|The {{other two}} job entry {{subsystems}} {{have very little}} in common, and in fact jobs written to run on one usually require small Job Control Language changes before <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be <b>run</b> on the other.|$|R
5|$|The first New Jersey State Constitution, {{ratified}} in 1776, {{provided that}} a governor be elected annually {{by the state}} legislature, the members of which were selected by the several counties. Under this constitution, the governor {{was president of the}} upper house of the legislature, then called the Legislative Council. The 1844 constitution provided for a popular vote to elect the governor, who no longer presided over the upper house of the legislature, now called the Senate. The 1844 constitution also lengthened the governor's term to three years, set to start on the third Tuesday in January following an election, and barred governors from succeeding themselves. The 1947 constitution extended terms to four years, and limits governors from being elected to more than two consecutive terms, though <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>run</b> again after a third term has passed.|$|E
5|$|Tony begins {{grooming}} fourteen-year-old Lauren Branning, {{supporting her}} {{when her mother}} Tanya Branning (Jo Joyner) is arrested for the attempted murder of her father. He plans {{to take her to}} a concert, but Lauren's father Max Branning (Jake Wood) uncovers her hidden clothes and refuses her permission to attend. When Whitney's sixteenth birthday arrives, she books flights so <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>run</b> away together. Attempting to foil her plan, Tony steals her passport but it is found and returned. On her birthday, Whitney tells Bianca about her relationship with Tony, believing {{that they are going to}} leave together. Horrified, Bianca calls the police, and Tony is arrested. He is later released on bail and visits their home in an attempt to convince Whitney not to give a statement to the police. He is attacked by Bianca's ex-husband Ricky (Sid Owen) and re-arrested for breaking his bail conditions.|$|E

50|$|Paper dryers are {{typically}} arranged in groups called sections so that <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be <b>run</b> at a progressively slightly slower speed {{to compensate for}} sheet shrinkage as the paper dries. The gaps between sections are called draws.|$|R
25|$|Stirling engines can run {{directly}} on any available heat source, {{not just one}} produced by combustion, so <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>run</b> on heat from solar, geothermal, biological, nuclear sources or waste heat from industrial processes.|$|E
25|$|Under the Intercity Express Programme (IEP), 21 {{electric}} Class 800 trains {{were ordered}} as replacements for the ageing InterCity 125 diesels. In May 2016, owing to {{delays in the}} modernisation project, {{it was confirmed that}} the new trains would be converted to 'bi-mode', meaning <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>run</b> on diesel fuel and electric overhead wire.|$|E
25|$|All {{aspects of}} an SVG {{document}} {{can be accessed}} and manipulated using scripts {{in a similar way}} to HTML. The default scripting language is ECMAScript (closely related to JavaScript) and there are defined Document Object Model (DOM) objects for every SVG element and attribute. Scripts are enclosed in <script> elements. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>run</b> in response to pointer events, keyboard events and document events as required.|$|E
50|$|The {{nature of}} {{baseball}} allows kids {{to run around}} and chase foul balls. <b>They</b> even <b>can</b> <b>run</b> on the field in-between innings. There are many catchy songs, quirky Walk up music selections from the players, and lots of in-game activations.|$|R

5000|$|Broadcast {{automation}} {{incorporates the}} use of broadcast programming technology to automate broadcasting operations. Used either at a broadcast network, radio station or a television station, it <b>can</b> <b>run</b> a facility {{in the absence of}} a human operator. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> also <b>run</b> in a [...] "live assist" [...] mode when there are on-air personnel present at the master control, television studio or control room.|$|R
25|$|Electronically {{controlled}} 'common rail' and 'unit injector' type {{systems from}} the late 1990s onwards may only use biodiesel blended with conventional diesel fuel. These engines have finely metered and atomized multiple-stage injection systems that {{are very sensitive to}} the viscosity of the fuel. Many current-generation diesel engines are made so that <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>run</b> on B100 without altering the engine itself, although this depends on the fuel rail design.|$|E
25|$|There are twelve {{regions of}} the globe where the player may put bases (North America, South America, Europe, Siberia, North Africa, South Africa, Central Asia, Southeast Asia, Australasia, Arctic, Antarctic, and Pacific) and where alien {{activity}} may occur. Aliens have several possible missions <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>run,</b> from harmless research missions designed to collect data about the Earth and its inhabitants, to terror attacks on cities {{with the aim of}} convincing governments to reduce X-COM's funding.|$|E
25|$|Lamps {{designed}} for different voltages have different luminous efficacy. For example, a 100-watt, 120-volt lamp will produce about 17.1 lumens per watt. A lamp {{with the same}} rated lifetime but {{designed for}} 230 V would produce only around 12.8 lumens per watt, and a similar lamp designed for 30 volts (train lighting) would produce as much as 19.8 lumens per watt. Lower voltage lamps have a thicker filament, for the same power rating. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>run</b> hotter for the same lifetime before the filament evaporates.|$|E
50|$|Of these computers, the {{following}} models were equipped with 1GB RAM {{as the standard}} option on the base model when they were shipped originally. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> only <b>run</b> OS X El Capitan if they have at least 2GB of RAM.|$|R
5000|$|A {{copy of the}} {{mainframe}} {{version of}} AIX or Linux. In the mainframe environment, these operating systems often run under VM, and are handled like other guest operating systems. (<b>They</b> <b>can</b> also <b>run</b> as 'native' operating systems on the bare hardware.) ...|$|R
50|$|These races {{must have}} minimum prize money of £1,000. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> be <b>run</b> over {{one or two}} rounds and within a nine-day period. A {{category}} three race can be staged over one day but must have minimum prize money of £500.|$|R
25|$|In some {{cultures}} of Asia, a hijra is usually {{considered to be}} neither a man nor a woman. Most are anatomically male or intersex, but some are anatomically female. The hijra form a third gender role, although they do not enjoy the same acceptance and respect as males and females in their cultures. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>run</b> their own households, and their occupations are singing and dancing, working as cooks or servants, sometimes prostitutes, or long-term sexual partners with men. Hijras {{can be compared to}} transvestites or drag queens of contemporary western culture.|$|E
25|$|Garratts {{have several}} {{advantages}} when used on light and narrow gauge railways. They are tank locomotives and {{can easily be}} run tender-first, thus {{eliminating the need for}} expensive turntables or wyes. They {{do not need to be}} run through to terminals, increasing operational flexibility. Because the engine units are separated by the boiler unit, the weight of the locomotive is split over the two units, and <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>run</b> over bridges or line sections that might not be able to support conventional or Mallet locomotives of similar weight.|$|E
25|$|Robots {{are used}} {{extensively}} in industrial engineering. They allow businesses {{to save money}} on labor, perform tasks that are either too dangerous or too precise for humans to perform them economically, and to ensure better quality. Many companies employ assembly lines of robots, especially in Automotive Industries and some factories are so robotized that <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>run</b> by themselves. Outside the factory, robots have been employed in bomb disposal, space exploration, and many other fields. Robots are also sold for various residential applications, from recreation to domestic applications.|$|E
50|$|These races {{must have}} minimum prize money of £12,500. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> be <b>run</b> {{between one and}} four rounds but must be {{completed}} within a 15-day period, except for special circumstances. In any event the competition must be completed within 18 days.|$|R
50|$|However, it is {{important}} to stress that cEAs are a model of search, in many senses different from traditional EAs. Also, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be <b>run</b> in sequential and parallel platforms, reinforcing the fact that the model and the implementation are two different concepts.|$|R
50|$|These are {{downloaded}} (and cached) and installed/uninstalled via the instance manager. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> then be <b>run</b> as {{standalone or}} as Windows Services.|$|R
25|$|One of {{the mysteries}} about Leptictidium is whether it moved by running or by jumping. Because {{there are very few}} {{completely}} bipedal mammals, it is difficult to find an appropriate living model to compare it with. If the kangaroo is used, it is probable that Leptictidium hopped along with its body tilted forward, using its tail as a counterweight. On the other hand, elephant shrews combine both types of locomotion; they usually move on four legs, but <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>run</b> on two legs to flee from a predator. Studies of the bone structure of Leptictidium have yielded contradicting information: its leg articulations appear too weak to have supported the shock of repeated jumps, but its long feet were obviously adapted for jumping rather than running.|$|E
25|$|The {{viscosity}} {{requirement of}} diesel fuel is usually specified at 40°C. A disadvantage of diesel {{as a vehicle}} fuel in cold climates is that its viscosity increases as the temperature decreases, changing it into a gel (see Compression Ignition – Gelling) that cannot flow in fuel systems. Special low-temperature diesel contains additives to keep it liquid at lower temperatures, but starting a diesel engine in very cold weather may still pose considerable difficulties. Another disadvantage of diesel engines compared to petrol/gasoline engines {{is the possibility of}} diesel engine runaway failure. Since diesel engines do not need spark ignition, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>run</b> as long as diesel fuel is supplied. Fuel is typically supplied via a fuel pump. If the pump breaks down in an open position, the supply of fuel will be unrestricted, and the engine will run away and risk terminal failure.|$|E
25|$|A grieving Anita {{arrives at}} Maria's apartment. As Tony leaves, he tells Maria {{to meet him}} at Doc's so <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>run</b> away to the country. In spite of her {{attempts}} to conceal it, Anita sees that Tony has been with Maria, and launches an angry tirade against him ("A Boy Like That"). Maria counters by telling Anita how powerful love is ("I Have a Love"), and Anita realizes that Maria loves Tony as much as she had loved Bernardo. She admits that Chino has a gun and is looking for Tony. Lt. Schrank arrives to question Maria about her brother's death, and Anita agrees to go to Doc's to tell Tony to wait. Unfortunately, the Jets, who have found Tony, have congregated at Doc's, and they taunt Anita with racist slurs and eventually simulate rape. Doc arrives and stops them. Anita is furious, and in anger spitefully delivers the wrong message, telling the Jets that Chino has shot Maria dead.|$|E
5000|$|An {{example of}} a {{programming}} language construct {{which may or may}} not terminate is a loop, as <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be <b>run</b> repeatedly.
