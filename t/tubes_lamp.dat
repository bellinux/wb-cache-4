50|$|LED tube {{lights are}} {{designed}} to physically fit in fixtures intended for fluorescent tubes. Some LED tubular lamps are {{intended to be a}} drop-in replacement into existing fixtures if appropriate ballast is used. Others require rewiring of the fixtures to remove the ballast. An LED <b>tube</b> <b>lamp</b> generally uses many individual Surface-Mounted LEDs which are directional and require proper orientation during installation as opposed to Fluorescent <b>tube</b> <b>lamps</b> which emit light in all directions around the tube. Most LED tube lights available can be used in place of T8, T10, or T12 tube designations, T8 is D26mm, T10 is D30mm, in lengths of 590 mm, 1200 mm and 1500 mm.|$|R

5|$|The effects crew {{focused on}} using in-camera tricks {{to realize the}} probe; {{post-production}} effects were time-consuming, so lighting effects were done on stage while filming.

After watching the first shot, the team found the original, whalelike probe design lacking in menace. The modelmakers repainted the probe a shiny black, pockmarked its surface for greater texture and interest, and re-shot the scene. Although they wanted to avoid post-production effects work, the opticals team had to recolor the antenna ball in a blue hue, as the original orange looked too much like a spinning basketball.|$|R

2500|$|A shortwave UV lamp can be {{made using}} a {{fluorescent}} <b>lamp</b> <b>tube</b> with no phosphor coating. These lamps emit ultraviolet light with two peaks in the UVC band at 253.7nm and 185nm due to the mercury within the lamp, {{as well as some}} visible light. From 85% to 90% of the UV produced by these lamps is at 253.7nm, whereas only 5–10% is at 185nm. The fused quartz glass tube passes the 253nm radiation but blocks the 185nm wavelength. Such tubes have two or three times the UVC power of a regular fluorescent <b>lamp</b> <b>tube.</b> These low-pressure <b>lamps</b> have a typical efficiency of approximately 30–40%, meaning that for every 100 watts of electricity consumed by the lamp, they will produce approximately 30–40 watts of total UV output.

2500|$|The {{alkali metal}} ions {{are small and}} mobile; their {{presence}} in glass allows a degree of electrical conductivity, especially in molten state or at high temperature. Their mobility decreases the chemical resistance of the glass, allowing leaching by water and facilitating corrosion. Alkaline earth ions, with their two positive charges and requirement for two non-bridging oxygen ions to compensate for their charge, are much less mobile themselves and also hinder diffusion of other ions, especially the alkalis. The most common commercial glasses contain both alkali and alkaline earth ions (usually sodium and calcium), for easier processing and satisfying corrosion resistance. Corrosion resistance of glass can be increased by dealkalization, removal of the alkali ions from the glass surface by reaction with e.g. sulfur or fluorine compounds. [...] Presence of alkaline metal ions has also detrimental effect to the loss tangent of the glass, and to its electrical resistance; glasses for electronics (sealing, vacuum <b>tubes,</b> <b>lamps...)</b> {{have to take this}} in account.|$|R

50|$|The {{lamp burner}} has a flat wick, usually made of cotton. The {{lower part of}} the wick dips into the fount and absorbs the kerosene; the top part of the wick extends out of the wick <b>tube</b> of the <b>lamp</b> burner, which {{includes}} a wick-adjustment mechanism. Adjusting how much of the wick extends above the wick tube controls the flame. The wick tube surrounds the wick, and ensures that the correct amount of air reaches the lamp burner. Adjustment is usually done by means of a small knob operating a cric, which is a toothed, metal sprocket bearing against the wick. If the wick is too high, and extends beyond the burner cone {{at the top of the}} wick <b>tube,</b> the <b>lamp</b> will produce smoke and soot (unburned carbon). When the lamp is lit, the kerosene that the wick has absorbed burns and produces a clear, bright, yellow flame. As the kerosene burns, capillary action in the wick draws more kerosene up from the fuel tank. All kerosene flat wick lamps use the dead flame burner design, where the flame is fed cold air from below and hot air exits above.|$|R
