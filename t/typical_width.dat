We propose a new resonance width distribution based on the random matrix theory for an open quantum system.

40|$|Abstract—Photonic wire lasers are compact light {{sources that}} are {{fabricated}} in high-index contrast waveguides (with <b>typical</b> <b>widths</b> {{of a few}} hundreds of nanometers). Because of their small footprints, they may become a basic laser component in future-generation of optical integrated circuits. Owing to having low optical volume by design, photonic wire lasers can only produce low output power {{that may not be}} adequate in many applications. A solution to this problem is to coherently combine the output power of different photonic wire lasers to produce larger output power. In this article, we analyze different ways to combine light coming out from photonic wire lasers and couple the combined power into a single-mode waveguide. 1...|$|R

The photoluminescence (PL) characterization of the ZnO nanobelts shows strong near-band UV emission (about 383 nm) and one broad peak at 501 nm, which indicates that the ZnO nanobelts have good potential application in optoelectronic devices...|$|R
50|$|The Atlantic NECC {{consists}} of the eastward zonal transport of water between 3°N and 9°N, with <b>typical</b> <b>widths</b> {{on the order of}} 300 km. The Atlantic NECC is unique among the equatorial currents in that basin because of its extreme seasonality. The maximum eastward flow is attained in late boreal summer and fall while the countercurrent is replaced by westward flow in late winter and spring. The NECC has maximum transport of approximately 40 Sv (10^6 m3/s) at 38°W. Transport reaches 30 Sv two months per year at 44°W, while farther east at 38°W the transport reaches that level five months per year. The magnitude of the NECC weakens substantially east of 38°W due to water being absorbed by the westward equatorial current south of 3°N.|$|R

40|$|We have {{hypothesized}} {{that the size of}} the binocular field among mammals has been selected to maximize the visually surveyable region around the animal (Changizi and Shimojo, 2008). At first glance it may seem that this hypothesis should always predict lateral pointing eyes, and a consequently small binocular field width. However, the hypothesis does not predict lateral pointing eyes in cases where the environment is filled with leafy occlusions and the animal's interpupillary distance surpasses the <b>typical</b> <b>widths</b> of the leaves (when both of these apply, we call the environment “cluttered”). In such cases, within an animal's binocular region the eyes tend to sample the scene independently. Laterally directed eyes also sample the scene independently, but the binocular region benefits from a variety of binocular summation, lowering the threshold for the recognition of objects in the binocular field. Our hypothesis predicts that mammals outside of leafy environments should have small binocular fields, independent {{of the size of the}} animal; but it predicts that for animals in leafy environments, whereas small animals should have small binocular fields (because their interpupillary distance is small compared to the <b>typical</b> occlusion <b>width),</b> large animals should have large binocular fields (because the binocular region begins to become more powerful at object recognition). Our paper provided evidence consistent with these predictions. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{the light}} of the recent finding that nebular {{emission}} lines are commonly found in the inner regions of early-type galaxies, we evaluate their effect to stellar absorption-line indices.

We find that the [Ni] emission-line doublet at 5199 ˚A can significantly affect Mgb line-strength measurements. For <b>typical</b> equivalent <b>widths</b> of the [Ni] doublet in nuclei of early-type galaxies featuring nebular emission, the Mgb index is artificially enhanced by 0. 4 – 2 ˚A, which represents a significant fraction of the <b>typical</b> equivalent <b>width</b> of the Mg b line in early-type galaxies.

The resulting measured planar dimensions of the nanofibers (length and width) agree qualitatively with those measured by atomic force microscopy. At very low voltages the FESEM images also reveal significantly more detailed information from the surface of the nanofibers as compared to measurements performed at more conventional, high voltages of kilovolts. However, with increasing electron dosage charging and radiation-induced modification of the nanofibers is observed, leading to an apparent increase of width and length.
