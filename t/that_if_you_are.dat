The Islam that was preached 2,000 years ago isn’t {{going to work}} here in modern London. Muslims need to alter their lifestyles to a Western lifestyle. To criticise is not Islamaphobic. It's about opposing certain ideas.|$|E

Rediff.com criticized her commenting, [...] "Genelia stands up yet again to prove the point <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> pretty and well dressed, {{you can get away with}} anything, without acting." [...] Shortly afterwards in 2007, Genelia played the role of sister of a notorious gangster in the blockbuster Telugu movie Dhee, set against a gang war backdrop.|$|E

He says <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> in Lhasa airport and someone is fiddling with your luggage, yelling [...] "fuck off" [...] will effectively communicate that they should stop and leave. Morissette says, [...] "The f-word is special. Everybody uses the word 'breakfast', but not everyone feels comfortable using the word 'fuck' so there's an extra power behind it." [...] Boone argues for less use of the word, saying that he uses his surname instead. Radio talk show host Dennis Prager {{says that it is}} acceptable for youths to hear the word on television and film, but not from their family members. In the film, opponents of the word [...] "fuck" [...] use an argument commonly known as [...] "Think of the children".|$|E

2500|$|One {{reason to}} suppose that people may deviate from the {{equilibrium}} behavior is if some are altruistic. The basic idea is <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> playing against an altruist, that person will always cooperate, and hence, to maximize your payoff you should defect on the last round rather than the first. [...] If enough people are altruists, sacrificing the payoff of first-round defection is worth the price {{in order to determine}} whether or not your opponent is an altruist. Nagel and Tang (1998) suggest this explanation.|$|E
2500|$|Another of Abu Bakr's grandsons, Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr, {{was very}} close to Husayn bin Ali. After Hussein ibn Ali was betrayed by the people of Kufa and killed by the army of Yazid I, the Umayyad ruler, Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr confronted Yazid and {{expelled}} him from Iraq, southern Arabia and the greater part of Syria, and parts of Egypt. Following a lengthy campaign, on his last hour Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr asked his mother Asma' bint Abu Bakr, the daughter of the first caliph, for advice. Asma' bint Abu Bakr replied to her son: [...] "You know better in your own self, <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> upon the truth and you are calling towards the truth go forth, for people more honourable than you have been killed and if you are not upon the truth, then what an evil son you are and you have destroyed yourself and those who are with you. If you say, <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> upon the truth and you will be killed at the hands of others, then you will not truly be free". Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr left and was later also killed and crucified by the Syrian Army now {{under the control of the}} Umayyads.|$|E

2500|$|In 1982, Blair was {{selected}} as the Labour Party candidate for the safe Conservative seat of Beaconsfield, where there was a forthcoming by-election. Although Blair lost the Beaconsfield by-election and Labour's share of the vote fell by 10 percentage points, he acquired a profile within the party. In contrast to his later centrism, Blair made it clear in a letter he wrote to Labour leader Michael Foot in July 1982 (published in [...] 2006) that he had [...] "come to Socialism through Marxism" [...] and considered himself on the left. Like Tony Benn, Blair believed that [...] "Labour right" [...] was bankrupt: [...] "Socialism ultimately must appeal to the better minds of the people. You cannot do <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> tainted overmuch with a pragmatic period in power." [...] Yet, he saw the hard left as no better, saying: ...|$|E

6000|$|... "The {{rest was}} easy to guess. The {{governor}} had come along, <b>you</b> had <b>been</b> questioned, and had been arrested as a Huguenot.
