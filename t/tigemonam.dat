40|$|At five {{geographically}} separate medical centers, over 6, 000 clinical bacterial isolates {{were tested}} for their susceptibility to <b>tigemonam</b> by the broth microdilution method. The antimicrobial spectrum of <b>tigemonam</b> {{was similar to}} that of aztreonam, but with two differences. Aztreonam was more active against Pseudomonas spp., and <b>tigemonam</b> was more active against some streptococci. <b>Tigemonam</b> was highly resistant to hydrolysis by the eight beta-lactamase enzymes tested. A significant (greater than a fourfold increase in the MICs of <b>tigemonam)</b> inoculum effect occurred when 3 of 13 isolates were tested with inocula of 5 X 10 (5) and 1 X 10 (7) CFU/ml. <b>Tigemonam</b> was bactericidal for all but 1 of the 13 isolates. Of the four quality-control strains recommended by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards, only Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 provided on-scale results. The proposed MIC quality-control range of <b>tigemonam</b> for E. coli ATCC 25922 is 0. 13 to 0. 5 micrograms/ml...|$|E
40|$|<b>Tigemonam,</b> a new monobactam with {{excellent}} activity against gram-negative bacteria, was evaluated for in vivo efficacy and absorption after oral administration to laboratory animals. <b>Tigemonam</b> is absorbed when administered orally to mice and dogs. In {{a variety of}} gram-negative systemic infections in mice, orally administered <b>tigemonam</b> was efficacious in all infections studied. Comparison drugs such as amoxicillin, cephalexin, and cefaclor were less efficacious, especially in infections caused by beta-lactamase-producing organisms. In localized infections, <b>tigemonam</b> also demonstrated excellent in vivo activity. In acute pyelonephritis in mice caused by Escherichia coli or Proteus sp., <b>tigemonam</b> was very effective. In a rat lung model with Klebsiella pneumoniae, <b>tigemonam</b> was active with a median effective dose of 46 mg/kg compared with 160 mg/kg for cefaclor and over 200 mg/kg for amoxicillin. <b>Tigemonam</b> was well absorbed in laboratory animals and with its excellent gram-negative spectrum of activity should prove of value in oral antibiotic therapy in humans...|$|E
40|$|<b>Tigemonam,</b> a novel, orally {{administered}} monobactam, exhibited potent {{and specific}} activity in vitro against {{members of the}} family Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Its activity was variable to poor against gram-positive bacteria, Acinetobacter spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and anaerobes. Within its spectrum of activity, <b>tigemonam</b> was far superior to oral antibiotics currently available, including amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefaclor, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. In addition, <b>tigemonam</b> was superior to cefuroxime, which is under development as an oral pro-drug, and more active than cefixime against several genera of the Enterobacteriaceae. The activity of <b>tigemonam</b> against the enteric bacteria, Haemophilus species, and Neisseria species was, in general, comparable to that of the quinolone norfloxacin. The excellent activity of <b>tigemonam</b> against beta-lactamase-producing bacteria reflected its marked stability to hydrolysis by isolated enzymes. The expanded spectrum of activity against gram-negative bacteria observed with <b>tigemonam</b> thus extends oral beta-lactam coverage to include members of the Enterobacteriaceae that are intrinsically or enzymatically resistant to broad-spectrum penicillins and cephalosporins...|$|E
40|$|<b>Tigemonam</b> is an orally {{administered}} monobactam. At {{less than}} or equal to 1 microgram/ml it inhibited the majority of strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter diversus, Proteus spp., Providencia spp., Aeromonas hydrophila, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Serratia marcescens, and Yersinia enterocolitica. At {{less than or}} equal to 0. 25 microgram/ml it inhibited Haemophilus spp., Neisseria spp., and Branhamella catarrhalis. It did not inhibit Pseudomonas spp. or Acinetobacter spp. <b>Tigemonam</b> was more active than cephalexin and amoxicillin-clavulanate and inhibited many members of the family Enterobacteriaceae resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and gentamicin. Some Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter freundii strains resistant to aminothiazole iminomethoxy cephalosporins and aztreonam were resistant to <b>tigemonam.</b> The MIC for 90 % of hemolytic streptococci of groups A, B, and C and for Streptococcus pneumoniae was 16 micrograms/ml, but the MIC for 90 % of enterococci, Listeria spp., Bacteroides spp., and viridans group streptococci was greater than 64 micrograms/ml. <b>Tigemonam</b> was not hydrolyzed by the common plasmid beta-lactamases such as TEM- 1 and SHV- 1 or by the chromosomal beta-lactamases of Enterobacter, Morganella, Pseudomonas, and Bacteroides spp. <b>Tigemonam</b> inhibited beta-lactamases of E. cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa but did not induce beta-lactamases. The growth medium had a minimal effect on the in vitro activity of <b>tigemonam,</b> and there was a close agreement between the MICs and MBCs...|$|E
40|$|Oral and {{parenteral}} administration of aztreonam and oral administration of <b>tigemonam</b> to conventional mice caused {{a decrease in}} the number of aerobic gram-negative rods in the feces. Oral treatment with high doses of aztreonam (greater than or equal to 25 mg/kg/day) and <b>tigemonam</b> (100 mg/kg/day) adversely influenced colonization resistance, whereas oral treatment with lower doses of the monobactams or parenteral treatment with aztreonam did not...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} {{performed}} to investigate the pharmacodynamics of aztreonam and <b>tigemonam</b> against Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae in vitro and in vivo. The in vitro concentration-effect relationships were determined in short-term growth experiments. The in vivo dose-effect relationships were determined in an experimental thigh muscle infection in irradiated mice. In this model, E. coli was injected into one thigh muscle and K. pneumoniae was injected into the other. Throughout these experiments aztreonam was administered subcutaneously and <b>tigemonam</b> was administered orally. For analysis of the antibacterial pharmacodynamics, the following parameters were determined: the maximum effect as a parameter for efficacy, the 50 % effective concentration (or dose) as a parameter for potency, and {{the slope of the}} concentration-effect relationship. To assess the relationship between the concentration of the antibiotic and the antibacterial effect in vivo, the pharmacokinetics of the two drugs in the plasma of mice were determined as well. The maximum in vitro and in vivo effects of aztreonam and <b>tigemonam</b> against both bacteria did not differ substantially. However, both drugs killed E. coli more effectively than K. pneumoniae, indicating that the maximum in vitro effect of these drugs against E. coli was higher than that against K. pneumoniae. The maximum in vivo effect of both drugs against E. coli was similar to that against K. pneumoniae. Furthermore, in vitro aztreonam was about twice as potent as <b>tigemonam,</b> but in vivo the reverse was the case. These findings were explained by pharmacokinetic differences between subcutaneously administered aztreonam and orally administered <b>tigemonam,</b> because concentrations of <b>tigemonam</b> in plasma remained at microbiologically active concentrations longer than those of aztreonam did...|$|E

40|$|Oral and {{parenteral}} administration of aztreonam and oral administration of <b>tigemonam</b> to conventional mice caused {{a decrease in}} the number of aerobic gram-negative rods in the feces. Oral treatment with high doses of aztreonam (. 25 mg/kg/day) and <b>tigemonam</b> (100 mg/kg/day) adversely influenced colonization resistance, whereas oral treatment with lower doses of the monobactams or parenteral treatment with aztreonam did not. Monobactams are a relatively new group of beta-lactam antibiotics with antibacterial activity against most aerobic gram-negative rods but limited activity against gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria (2). Aztreonam has been used in regimens for empirical antimicrobial treatment of suspect-ed infections in granulocytopenic patients (8) because of its potent in vitro activity against gram-negative rods. Fur-thermore, it has been suggested that orally administered aztreonam may be suitable for selective elimination of gram-negative bacilli from the gastrointestinal tract (4).
