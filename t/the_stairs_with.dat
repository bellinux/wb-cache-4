5|$|To avoid further wear of stairs' stones, since November 2014, {{two main}} {{sections}} of Borobudur stairs — the eastern (ascending route) and northern (descending route) sides — {{are covered with}} wooden structures. The similar technique has been applied in Angkor Wat in Cambodia and Egyptian Pyramids. In March 2015, Borobudur Conservation Center proposed further to seal <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>with</b> rubber cover. Proposals have also been made that visitors be issued special sandals.|$|E
25|$|In another {{scene where}} the {{characters}} played by Amelia Bence, Petrone and Magaña argue, {{the latter was}} supposed to fall down the stairs but doubted his ability to do so. Demare stood {{at the top of}} <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>with</b> his back to it and rolled down, to demonstrate that the scene could be done without undue risk. This was in fact the sequence shown in the movie.|$|E
500|$|Doctors {{working at}} the USC Medical Center were {{recruited}} to play the ones who try to save E.T. after government agents take over Elliott's house. Spielberg felt that actors in the roles, performing lines of technical medical dialogue, would come across as unnatural. During post-production, he decided to cut a scene featuring Harrison Ford as the principal at Elliott's school. It featured his character reprimanding Elliott for his behavior in biology class and warning {{of the dangers of}} underage drinking. He is then taken aback as Elliott's chair rises from the floor, while E.T. is levitating his [...] "phone" [...] equipment up <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>with</b> Gertie.|$|E

500|$|Many 20th-century {{historians have}} {{stressed}} the potential military strength of Castle Rising; R. Allen Brown, for example, concluded that [...] "defence... was the overwhelming consideration in [...] design and construction", {{and argued that}} the keep would {{have been used as}} a final refuge in the case of attack during a siege. Beric Morley and David Gurney believe that the military strength of the castle could not have failed to impress contemporaries. Sidney Toy suggested that the forebuilding would have made an effective defensive feature, enabling the defenders to attack intruders {{as they made their way}} up <b>the</b> <b>stairs,</b> <b>with</b> Morley and Gurney describing it as [...] "a deadly and near impregnable approach to the castle's interior".|$|E
500|$|Dixit draped {{a bright}} purple jaded satin saree with a backless khidki-blouse; the saree was {{reported}} to have cost [...] A scene in the film which portrays her walking down <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>with</b> Khan remaining stunned gapping at her was pointed out as an [...] "iconic scene". Designed by Anna Singh, the saree was described as one of the [...] "most talked about sarees" [...] by both The Tribune and The Times of India. It became popular and was made available for purchase in various shops around the world, with it selling in large numbers. Dolls sporting this outfit were also marketed. It also set a trend for purple colour in wedding seasons. With increasing appeal, the subsequent film's poster showed only Dixit in the purple saree whereas initially she was placed besides Khan. In 2012, the romantic comedy film Shirin Farhad Ki Toh Nikal Padi also used the same saree in their film's poster.|$|E
500|$|Katie and Maggie enter. Maggie {{talks about}} Pat's [...] "frozen willies"—novelty ice cubes—as a distressed Jim makes her a drink, and Carol dances with the uninterested Katie. Jim pulls Carol away from Katie, but Carol hits him; when Carol talks to Katie about {{becoming}} her stepmother, Jim shouts at her. Pat stops him, and, after Carol storms out, tells Jim that [...] "he knows". Katie is distressed, and interrogates Jim as Maggie plunges a knife into the cake. Jim panics, believing Angela {{is still under}} the table, but Angela enters from the kitchen, and reveals that she left to buy a real cake—the story that Jim had told to cover her apparent absence. Katie {{wants to talk to}} her mother, but chaos ensues when Maggie chokes on an ice cube, which Pat reveals contains a fake spider. Carol enters, her face blackened by Pat's fake soap, and Pat, reaching for his charging phone to call the emergency services, is electrocuted, his hands wet from the ice bucket. Angela performs the Heimlich manoeuver on her mother; Carol kneels by Pat and shouts for help. The new cake is pushed into Jim's face by Katie, who then answers the door. The paramedic enters, then begins a striptease for Maggie to the Casualty theme. His performance, it is revealed, was Pat's present to Maggie. Later, Jim talks to an oblivious Maggie. He sees Angela and Katie come down <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>with</b> bags. In silence, he watches them leave as Maggie tells him the joke from Pat's birthday card.|$|E

50|$|The tower {{measures}} 11.5 by 10.3 m {{and rises}} four storeys to a corbelled parapet walk, with bartizans (open round towers) at the corners. At the north-west corner is a hexagonal cap house (a small room covering {{the top of}} <b>the</b> <b>stair),</b> <b>with</b> a pyramidal roof. The vaulted basement contains a well, and the main hall is at first-floor level.|$|R
60|$|This {{house is}} divided into sets of {{chambers}} and has a new frontage, but it no longer lets well. A few years ago there were two funerals from it within a fortnight, and soon afterward another of the tenants was found {{at the foot of}} <b>the</b> <b>stair</b> <b>with</b> his neck broken. These fatalities gave the house a bad name, as such things do in London.|$|R
500|$|A few critics {{suggested}} {{freedom as}} a theme {{in light of}} the importance shown by the characters to it. True to its title, which is a Romani word for freedom, [...] Gatlif used his freedom to direct a tangential, poignant romantic story with the historical documents available to him, unlike other movies with similar themes, remarked Jacques Mandelbaum at Le Monde. The Village Voice review declared that it is [...] "a magnificent paean to the mad ecstasy of freedom". The Arizona Reporter review added that, for the Romani, freedom means [...] "being able to keep in motion, that is, the journey, not the destination, is the reward". It observed the importance the characters give to freedom, citing the scene where Taloche becomes concerned that water is being [...] "held against its will" [...] in the taps, and [...] "releases" [...] it to overflow the sink onto the bathroom floor, and then <b>the</b> <b>stairs,</b> <b>with</b> Taloche blissfully sliding down the stairs as if he were on a Disney ride. Alexis Campion at Le Journal du Dimanche remarked that Gatlif has refreshingly portrayed the Romani as [...] "free-spirited" [...] characters and added that this historic film is a tribute to those free souls who take to the streets even today. The Télérama review was of the opinion that the movie runs out of steam during the scenes depicting historic events, but gains momentum in the forests and on the roads, where its characters' passion for freedom, and hence Lavoine's and Croze's characters, get sidelined by that of Thierrée's, with his St. Vitus' dance and Dostoyevsky-like ruminations. It added that Taloche is the true [...] "incarnation" [...] of freedom.|$|E
500|$|The video {{starts with}} a news anchor (played by Kristina Mitchell) saying {{the title of the}} song above a news banner that reads [...] "Britney Spears song lyrics spell out {{obscenity}} in disguise". This is a parody of an America's Newsroom report by Megyn Kelly. It then skips to a house, in which a sex party is coming to an end. Spears starts singing while {{sitting on the edge of}} a bed while the people that surround her are getting dressed. She gets up and looks out the window. As the first verse ends, she picks up a pair of panties from the floor, recalling her personal struggles and the [...] "Piece of Me" [...] video. She dances with four male dancers in the first chorus. During the second chorus, she dances with four other female dancers dressed in cheerleading outfits, while many men are watching them dance. The screen fades to white and Spears begins to change into a conservative '50s-inspired housewife outfit. As the chorus begins again, she comes out of her bedroom. She walks down <b>the</b> <b>stairs,</b> <b>with</b> dancers surrounding her and a woman gives her a potholder, which she uses to pick up a pie. After this, she walks out the front door of the house and is joined by her seemingly conservative-looking husband and children, one of them dressed with the schoolgirl outfit Spears wore in the [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] video. As they go down the walkway, they are surrounded by paparazzi, who have no idea what goes on behind closed doors. While the kids and husband wave, Spears smiles for the camera and blows a kiss. The video then ends with the news anchor saying, [...] "Doesn't make any sense, does it?".|$|E

60|$|From the hiding-place {{into which}} I {{had been so}} swiftly hustled I heard the footfalls upon <b>the</b> <b>stair,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> opening and {{the closing of the}} bedroom door. Then, to my surprise, there came a long silence, broken only by the heavy breathings and gaspings of the sick man. I could imagine that our visitor was {{standing}} by the bedside and looking down at the sufferer. At last that strange hush was broken.|$|R

2500|$|The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse {{was one of}} {{the first}} films with an anti-war theme. Mathis also {{injected}} some early depictions of alternative lifestyles; it featured a scene with German officers coming down the stairs in drag. Of the scene, Mathis later told The Los Angeles Times, [...] "I had the German officers coming down <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>with</b> women's clothing on. To hundreds of people that meant no more than a masquerade party. To those who have lived and read, and who understand life, that scene stood out as one of the most terrific things in the picture." ...|$|E
2500|$|Baker {{then ran}} to the {{entrance}} of the Texas School Book Depository, entered the building with his gun drawn, and led by building superintendent Roy Truly, {{made his way to the}} far northwest corner of the first floor. From there, Baker and Truly started yelling for someone to send an elevator down from a higher floor. When there was no response, the two men began climbing <b>the</b> <b>stairs,</b> <b>with</b> Truly in the lead. Approximately 90 seconds after the shots rang out, Baker stepped out onto the second floor and a movement towards the lunchroom vestibule across from the stairs caught his attention. Baker confronted Oswald at gunpoint. He let Oswald pass after Truly identified him as an employee. According to Baker, Oswald did not appear to be nervous or out of breath. Truly said that Oswald appeared [...] "startled" [...] when Baker aimed his gun at him. According to the Warren Commission, Oswald was next seen by a secretary as he crossed through the second-floor business office carrying a soda bottle. He left the Texas School Book Depository through its front door at approximately 12:33p.m..|$|E
2500|$|The {{afternoon}} {{edition of}} the Tribune hit the streets shortly after 3 p.m., and soon news spread of a potential lynching. By 4pm, the local authorities were on alert. White people began congregating at and near the Tulsa County Courthouse. By sunset at 7:34pm, the several hundred whites assembled outside the courthouse appeared to have {{the makings of a}} lynch mob. [...] Willard M. McCullough, the newly elected sheriff of Tulsa County, was determined to avoid events such as the 1920 lynching of white murder suspect Roy Belton in Tulsa, which had occurred during the term of his predecessor. The sheriff took steps {{to ensure the safety of}} Rowland. McCullough organized his deputies into a defensive formation around Rowland, who was terrified. The sheriff positioned six of his men, armed with rifles and shotguns, on the roof of the courthouse. He disabled the building's elevator, and had his remaining men barricade themselves at the top of <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>with</b> orders to shoot any intruders on sight. The sheriff went outside and tried to talk the crowd into going home, but to no avail. According to an account by Scott Ellsworth, the sheriff was [...] "hooted down".|$|E

2500|$|Another Nights tale {{with crime}} fiction {{elements}} was [...] "The Hunchback's Tale" [...] story cycle which, unlike [...] "The Three Apples", {{was more of}} a suspenseful comedy and courtroom drama rather than a murder mystery or detective fiction. The story is set in a fictional China and begins with a hunchback, the emperor's favourite comedian, being invited to dinner by a tailor couple. The hunchback accidentally chokes on his food from laughing too hard and the couple, fearful that the emperor will be furious, take his body to a Jewish doctor's clinic and leave him there. This leads to the next tale in the cycle, the [...] "Tale of the Jewish Doctor", where the doctor accidentally trips over the hunchback's body, falls down <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>with</b> him, and finds him dead, leading him to believe that the fall had killed him. The doctor then dumps his body down a chimney, and this leads to yet another tale in the cycle, which continues with twelve tales in total, leading to all the people involved in this incident finding themselves in a courtroom, all making different claims over how the hunchback had died. Crime fiction elements are also present near the end of [...] "The Tale of Attaf" [...] (see Foreshadowing above).|$|E

50|$|Later extensions, {{especially}} in the 1870s, retain something of the original character, if not the scale, in the plethora of traceried bargeboards, dormers, and barley-sugar chimneystacks. The detailing of the north-west front is more overtly Baronial, having a central tower-like pavilion with chamfered corners at the upper levels, a tall pyramidal roof, and a quadrant bartizan at the north-east angle. There are attractive interiors, particularly <b>the</b> <b>stair</b> <b>with</b> twisted balusters and timber arcading. Many fittings were moved here in the 1880s by Dorothea Veitch from Bassendean House.|$|R

50|$|The {{house is}} of the ‘’Severn Valley’’ type, with a storied porch {{opposite}} the main back-to-back central fireplace, the hall on the right, and parlour on the left. A rear wing containing <b>the</b> <b>stair,</b> <b>with</b> side lean-to, added later, appears to replace an earlier wing. The Cadw listing considers {{that the house was}} built around 1660, but the dating by dendrochronlogy of other similar Montgomeryshire houses with jettied first floors, such Great Cefnyberen and Glas Hirfryn suggest that Plasau Duon could have been built up to a hundred years earlier.|$|R
