40|$|A {{wide variety}} of tax regimes for (occupational) private pension saving are in place around the world. Generally, pension saving is taxed at a {{relatively}} low rate, although the revenue loss due to <b>tax</b> <b>facilities</b> for pension savings and/or pension tax expenditures may differ across countries. A strong fiscal stimulus to build up pension capital will support funding. However, these <b>tax</b> <b>facilities</b> may become an expensive business for governments. This paper investigates the ex ante budgetary effects of a cash-flow tax regime for pension savings by full present-value calculations. The fiscal subsidy on pension savings in several (European) countries {{is often associated with}} the application of the cash-flow treatment of pensions under the personal income tax: pension contributions are tax exempt, capital income of pension funds is tax-exempt, and pension benefits are taxed, but usually the elderly aged 65 years and over are taxed at a relatively low rate. This form can be described as EET, with E denoting an exemption or relief from tax and T denoting a point at which tax is payable. Indeed, tax treatment of pension saving can have other forms as well. We consider a specified form of a comprehensive income tax system (TTE) as an appropriate benchmark. Using the TTE-benchmark, the ex ante budgetary cost of the current tax treatment of pension saving in countries can be quantified. We employ an empirical analysis for the Netherlands, because this country belongs, with its three pension pillars and its sound funding, to the leading group of countries in Europe with a solid pension system. Our calculations, using Income Panel Data from Statistics Netherlands for the years 1990 - 2003, show that current taxation on a cash-flow basis means on balance a major loss to the Treasury (compared to the benchmark). For the year 2003 we estimate a fiscal subsidy associated with the current Dutch tax rule of 1. 2 to 1. 5 percent of GDP, depending on the assumed rate of return on pension capital. ...|$|R

40|$|An {{efficient}} {{financial market}} in any economy stimulates {{the economic growth}} through mobilizing the savings and promoting the investments. The Albanian economy has passed through {{a long period of}} transition which means a transformation of all the financial market and institutions. But not all the financial institutions are uniformly developed. Actually more attention is given to the transformation and development of the banking industry and less to the non-banking markets i. e. insurance, pension funds and securities market. Our paper is focused on these segments of the financial market, which account about 10 percent of the overall financial market. This little interest about these markets is explained by the mentality and culture of the population, the lack of knowledge about financial products, the passive role of government etc. There are many ways to stimulate and promote the development of these markets by the government and the market operators as well. The economic literature and the world experience show that fiscal system is one of the ways the government can and should use to promote the development of the financial institutions.

40|$|The Netherlands belongs, {{with its}} three pension pillars and its {{substantial}} funding, to the leading group of countries in Europe {{with a solid}} pension system. But <b>tax</b> <b>facilities</b> for pension savings have become an expensive business for the Dutch government. It {{is now one of}} the largest ’tax expenditures’. Through the deduction of pension and annuity contributions the Treasury will lose an estimated 9. 6 billion in 2003 (2. 1 percent of GDP). This is three times as much as in 1990. Balancing the pension contribution deductions, the pension benefits that will be paid out in the future will be subject to taxation. Pension incomes will however be taxed at a relatively low rate and, in addition, the delay in tax payment (investment returns of pension funds are exempt from taxation) provides an interest advantage. Our calculations for the year 2000 show that current taxation on a cash-flow basis means on balance a major loss to the Treasury (compared to the benchmark). At a relatively low real return on the pension capital, the fiscal subsidy in terms of net present value comes to 7. 7 billion (1. 9 percent of the GDP).

40|$|Tax {{is one of}} {{the fiscal}} policy {{instruments}} that can be used by the government. In such terms, legal products regulating taxation (i. e. tax law) has two dichotomic functions : budgetary and regular function. The former function is stressed on efforts to contribute money as much as possible to the government treasury. The later function is more stressed on how to use tax instruments in order to achieve certain goals outside the state's financial field, which can take form of promotion or prevention of certain condition. Taking "The Function of Income Tax Regulation as an Instrument to Promote Investment" as the title, this thesis analyses the government's taxation policy (mostly on Income Tax) in connection with the development of both domestic or foreign investment. Having taken the year 1967 to now as the analysis period, the writer divides the length of time into three periods, those are the period before the taxation reforms, the period after the first taxation reforms (1983) and the period after the second taxation reforms (1994). What lies behind the partition of the time into three periods is the tension characteristic between the budgetary and regular function. This thesis will be focussed on how is the regulation function of taxation after the second taxation reforms (1994), how is the regulation function of that period compared to the previous periods, how is the implementation of taxation policy and its impact to investment in Indonesia. The objectives of this research are to make detailed list of statutory laws that have been used as an instrument to promote investment, to analyse vertical and horizontal synchronization of the laws, and to study the implementation and the effect of that government policy in investment field. The method that is used in this research is a combination between the normative and sociolegal research. The reason for adopting this combination is solely based on the different research issues and objectives. These strategic findings that can be revealed from the research outcome and data analysis are as follows : 1. 	During the three period of taxation policy, the government has issued many statutory laws that serve as an instrument to promote investment. Afterall, if comparison is made, the period in which those laws were mostly issued is the first period, then followed by the third and the second period. We may conclude that the emphasis of regulation function in each period has the same sequence. 2. 	In terms of both vertical and horizontal synchronization, we may draw a conclusion that most of the statutory laws meet the requirements to be the laws with two faces (das doppelte reehtsantlitz). But, if we	notice the horizontal synchronization,	legal problems will arise {{from the fact that the}} Act Number 7 / 1983 never expressly abolishes the articles on the application of <b>tax</b> <b>facilities</b> that are contained in the Act Number 1 / 1967 and Number 6 / 1968. In terms of vertical synchronization, the issuance of Inpres No. 2 / 1996 jo. Keppres No. 42 / 1996 lacks of any delegative and atributive legitimation. Inpres No. 90 / 1995 jo. Inpres No. 3 / 1996 has contra-productive nature as well as it is insufficient to serve as the foundation of transferring wealth from private to public sector that has tax as its substance. 3. Lacks of implementation of statutory laws that give <b>tax</b> <b>facilities</b> to business world during the second period was caused by unclear criteria as well as by insufficient socialization of the laws among taxation executives and economic actors. The analysis	on effects	of taxation policy toward the growth of investment reveals that there are direct effects, which is caused by the nature statutory of law as initial pusher toward the desired objectives. Moreover, since taxation facility is not a single factor that can influence enthusiasm of investors to invest, the withdrawal of taxation facility does not automatically positively corelated to the increase or decrease of investment growth rate. Finally, from the strategic findings of this research, the following points need to be recommended : 1. 	The government should establish the implementing laws based on both delegation and atribution principle in order to implement taxation policy promoting investment 2. 	Any statutory law which will be issued has to be seen in connection with prevailing statutory laws in order to make horizontal and vertical synchronization. 3. 	The government has to be more agressive, - but selective -, in giving <b>tax</b> <b>facilities</b> so that Indonesia can grab the capital flow, mostly in global context. ...|$|R
