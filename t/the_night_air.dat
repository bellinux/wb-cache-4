5|$|In fact, {{during the}} 1950s, many {{families}} would intentionally hang gandingans outside their houses so other neighbors could easily hear them play. Young men would gather around the gandingan and gossip about people they dislike, usually “chatting” with other gandingan players further away. Locals says {{much of this}} jovial talk even contained sexual innuendoes, where all kinds of dirty words could be heard penetrating <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>air.</b>|$|E

25|$|Daytime {{exposure}} to sunlight will rapidly destabilize the upper {{layers of the}} snowpack if the sunlight {{is strong enough to}} melt the snow, thereby reducing its hardness. During clear nights, the snowpack can re-freeze when ambient air temperatures fall below freezing, through the process of long-wave radiative cooling, or both. Radiative heat loss occurs when <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>air</b> is significantly cooler than the snowpack, and the heat stored in the snow is re-radiated into the atmosphere.|$|E
500|$|Nigel Rumfitt QC, {{defending}} Awan, summarised {{the crime}} by stating: [...] "These {{people were not}} taking <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>air.</b> Every {{member of the group}} knew what was going on. These weapons had been selected before they set off. The knife was far too big to be hidden from the others. There is no doubt there was a hunting party looking for a victim." ...|$|E

2500|$|... 467 performers, each {{wearing one}} of the 5 Olympic colours, created a 20 meter tall ski jumper formation, after the playing of the Italian {{national}} anthem. The choreography showed an animated ski jumper gliding down the take-off slope, flying through <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>air</b> and eventually landing safely in perfect form on the ground. Puffs of air {{could be seen as}} the jumper prepared his jump. Performers carrying a blue banner then entered to show the skier gliding down the slope. In flight the figure was lit up by headlamp flashlights in a formation of a ski jumper in peak flight. The ski jumper eventually made a graceful landing on the ground as performers released confetti (to represent a snowplow stop) and cheered as the segment came to a close.|$|E
