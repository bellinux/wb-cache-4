The talk that Mahmud organised that night was initially supposed to be hosted at the Lahore University of Management Sciences however the university cancelled it a day before it was scheduled, saying it was pressured by government authorities to do so.

25|$|As income {{inequality}} has increased, {{the degree of}} House of Representatives polarization measured by voting record has also increased. The voting is mostly by the rich and for the rich {{making it hard to}} achieve equal income and resource distribution for the average population (Bonica et al., 2013). <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> number of people who turn to government insurance with the rising wealth and real income since they consider inequality within the different government sectors. Additionally, there has been an increased influence by the rich on the regulatory, legislative and electoral processes within the country that has led to improved employment standards for the bureaucrats and politicians. Professors McCarty, Pool and Rosenthal wrote in 2007 that polarization and {{income inequality}} fell in tandem from 1913 to 1957 and rose together dramatically from 1977 on. They show that Republicans have moved politically to the right, away from redistributive policies that would reduce income inequality. Polarization thus creates a feedback loop, worsening inequality.|$|E

2500|$|The {{production}} team {{consisted of a}} large group of make-up artists and costume designers who worked to recreate the Maya look for the large cast. Led by Aldo Signoretti, the make-up artists daily applied the required tattoos, scarification, and earlobe extensions to all of the on-screen actors. According to advisor Richard D. Hansen, the choices in body make-up were based on both artistic license and fact: [...] "I spent hours and hours going through the pottery and the images looking for tattoos. The scarification and tattooing was all researched, the inlaid jade teeth are in there, the ear spools are in there. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> doohickey that comes down from the ear through the nose into the septum – that was entirely their artistic innovation."

According to the statistics by the Bulgarian and Greek authors there is no Turks in the city, according to an alternative estimate the city was of Turkish majority.|$|E
