5|$|Alastair Hudson, Professor of Equity and Law at Queen Mary, University of London, {{suggests}} {{the potential for}} a third class of secret trust. This is where <b>the</b> <b>dying</b> person is encouraged not to make a will so that his property passes to the next-of-kin, on the agreement that the next-of-kin give effect to his wishes via a secret trust. If this is the case, the next-of-kin would be obliged to hold the property on trust and fulfil <b>the</b> <b>dying</b> person's wishes.|$|E

50|$|There are {{two common}} types of {{large-scale}} pellet mills: flat die mills and ring die mills. Flat die mills use a flat <b>die</b> with slots. <b>The</b> powder is {{introduced to the}} top of <b>the</b> <b>die</b> and as <b>the</b> <b>die</b> rotates a roller presses the powder through the holes in <b>the</b> <b>die.</b> A cutter {{on the other side of}} <b>the</b> <b>die</b> cuts <b>the</b> exposed pellet free from <b>the</b> <b>die.</b> In <b>the</b> ring <b>die</b> there are radial slot throughout <b>the</b> <b>die.</b> Powder is fed into the inside of <b>the</b> <b>die</b> and spreaders evenly distribute the powder. Two rollers then compress the powder through <b>the</b> <b>die</b> holes. Two cutters are used to cut the pellets free from the outside of <b>the</b> <b>die.</b>|$|R

40|$|Wafer-level {{packaging}} (WLP) is a next-generation semiconductor packaging {{technology that}} is important for realizing high-performance and ultra-thin semiconductor devices. However, the molding process, which {{is a part of}} the WLP process, has various problems such as a high defect rate and low predictability. Among the various defect factors, <b>the</b> <b>die</b> shift primarily determines the quality of the final product; therefore, predicting <b>the</b> <b>die</b> shift is necessary to achieve high-yield production in WLP. In this study, <b>the</b> <b>die</b> shift caused by the flow drag force of the epoxy molding compound (EMC) is evaluated from <b>the</b> <b>die</b> shift of a debonded molding wafer. Experimental and analytical methods were employed to evaluate <b>the</b> <b>die</b> shift occurring during each stage of the molding process and that resulting from the geometrical changes after the debonding process. <b>The</b> <b>die</b> shift caused by the EMC flow drag force is evaluated from <b>the</b> data on <b>die</b> movements due to thermal contraction/expansion and warpage. The relationship between <b>the</b> <b>die</b> shift and variation in <b>the</b> <b>die</b> gap is determined through regression analysis in order to predict <b>the</b> <b>die</b> shift due to the flow drag force. The results can be used for die realignment by predicting and compensating for <b>the</b> <b>die</b> shift...|$|R
30|$|To {{make the}} samples of crude membrane, firstly, <b>the</b> <b>die</b> walls, {{surfaces}} of punch and <b>the</b> <b>die</b> are greased with Stark Oil. Secondly, the homogeneous mixture is poured into <b>the</b> <b>die.</b> Then, 4 tons of pressure is gently applied on <b>the</b> <b>die.</b> After a few seconds, {{the pressure is}} slowly lowered and the crude membrane is removed from <b>the</b> <b>die.</b> It is to {{be noted that the}} pressure is slowly lowered to prevent incarnating the air mass among the particles, which causes some cracks on the samples.|$|R
40|$|A {{proposed}} die configuration {{is designed}} to effect the in-process compensation of the errors {{in the form of}} the extrudate which arise from the elasticity of <b>the</b> extrusion <b>dies.</b> <b>The</b> <b>die</b> is in <b>the</b> form of a truncated, conical-shell which is either on a plane or a spherical bearing surface, to enable it to deflect elastically, thereby changing the dimension of <b>the</b> <b>die</b> orifice. FE simulation of the work-material flow and <b>the</b> <b>die</b> deflection was conducted to verify the feasibility of the proposed configuration. The deflection of <b>the</b> <b>die</b> is a function of the extrusion force and the resulting reduction of <b>the</b> <b>die</b> orifice is in proportion to this force. The simulation enabled optimisation of the geometric parameters of <b>the</b> <b>die</b> with respect to component-form errors...|$|R

50|$|When making working <b>dies,</b> <b>the</b> Mint {{has found}} that by using a lower amount of {{pressure}} in the hubbing press, they can prolong the life of <b>the</b> hubs and <b>dies</b> used. In between each hubbing, however, <b>the</b> <b>die</b> being made must be subjected to an annealing procedure to soften the steel, {{making it easier to}} force the hub's image into <b>the</b> <b>die.</b> As <b>the</b> <b>die</b> is being cold forged in the hubbing press, <b>the</b> <b>die's</b> steel work hardens making <b>the</b> hubbed <b>die</b> harder and stronger than in its original state (an advantage over engraving <b>the</b> <b>die).</b> If, when <b>the</b> <b>die</b> is subjected to another hubbing, it is not lined up exactly with the hub, the result is a secondary image, or doubling. This is called die doubling, and results in such spectacular coins as the famous 1955 doubled die cent.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{distribution}} of temperatures and stresses in <b>the</b> <b>die</b> during high {{pressure die casting}} are computed through commercially finite element software developed by Wincast team, Germany. The deformation of <b>the</b> <b>die</b> during its continual running is predicted under the conditions without and with air cooling. The simulated results show that <b>the</b> regions of <b>die,</b> which contact with the casting, is subjected to compressed stresses and the other regions of <b>the</b> <b>die</b> subjected to tensile stresses. Compressed stresses are changed steeply from tensile to compress on {{the boundary between the}} casting and the inner cavity walls, which will results in hot-fatigue in those regions of <b>the</b> <b>die.</b> Setting cooling channel within <b>the</b> <b>die</b> is an efficient measure for eliminating hot-fatigue and prolonging life of <b>the</b> <b>die...</b>|$|R
5|$|When {{a colony}} is dying, for {{whatever}} cause, and other healthy colonies are nearby (as is typical in a bee yard), those healthy colonies often enter <b>the</b> <b>dying</b> colony and rob its provisions {{for their own}} use. If <b>the</b> <b>dying</b> colony's provisions were contaminated (by natural or man-made toxins), the resulting pattern (of healthy colonies becoming sick when in proximity to a dying colony) might suggest to an observer that a contagious disease is involved. However, it is typical in CCD cases that provisions of dying colonies are not being robbed, suggesting that at least this particular mechanism (toxins being spread via robbing, thereby mimicking a disease) {{is not involved in}} CCD. Additional evidence that CCD is an infectious disease came from the following observations: the hives of colonies that had died from CCD could be reused with a healthy colony only if they were first treated with DNA-destroying radiation, and the CCD Working Group report in 2010 indicated that CCD-exhibiting hives tended to occur in proximity to one another within apiaries.|$|E
5|$|According to William of Newburgh {{writing in}} the 1190s, the plan failed because of Geoffrey’s early death in 1151. <b>The</b> <b>dying</b> Geoffrey decided that Henry would have the {{paternal}} and maternal inheritances while he needed the resources to overcome Stephen, and left instructions that his body would not be buried until Henry swore an oath that once England and Normandy were secured the younger Geoffrey would have Anjou. Henry’s brother Geoffrey died in 1154, too soon to receive Anjou, but not before being installed count in Nantes after Henry aided a rebellion by its citizens against their previous lord.|$|E
5|$|After {{embarking on}} a small tour, the band set about {{recording}} Brave New World, their first studio album with Dickinson since 1992. Dickinson insisted that they find a replacement for the now retired Martin Birch, the band's regular producer, and record in a different studio {{than the one in}} which they made No Prayer for <b>the</b> <b>Dying</b> and Fear of the Dark, to which Harris agreed. The album was recorded at Guillaume Tell Studios, Paris with producer Kevin Shirley, after which Iron Maiden undertook a supporting tour culminating with a performance at the Rock in Rio festival before a crowd of 250,000.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>die</b> drool phenomenon, {{occurring}} as {{a result}} of the viscoelastic behavior of polymer melts during the flow, was experimentally investigated for metallocene-based LLDPE on a specially designed annular extrusion <b>die</b> with <b>the</b> capability to control the stress state at the end of <b>the</b> <b>die</b> by <b>the</b> help of a specific type of cooling system. With the aim of understanding <b>the</b> <b>die</b> drool phenomenon in more detail, the flow at the end of <b>the</b> <b>die</b> was analyzed theoretically by the finite element method employing a modified White-Metzner model as the constitutive equation. It has been revealed that negative pressure occurs at <b>the</b> <b>die</b> lip area, which seems to be an important factor driving the onset of <b>the</b> <b>die</b> drool phenomenon...|$|R
5000|$|The {{most notable}} feature of Kimble is the [...] "Pop-o-matic" [...] die container. This device {{is a clear}} plastic {{hemisphere}} containing <b>the</b> <b>die,</b> placed over a flexible sheet. Players roll <b>the</b> <b>die</b> by pressing down quickly on the bubble, which flexes the sheet and causes <b>the</b> <b>die</b> to tumble upon its rebound. The Pop-o-matic container produces a [...] sound when it is used, and prevents <b>the</b> <b>die</b> from being lost. <b>The</b> captive <b>die</b> allows for quick die rolls, and players' turns can be performed in rapid succession.|$|R
25|$|In addition, {{the mint}} has a {{practice}} of polishing <b>the</b> <b>dies</b> and using them longer. When a die begins to show evidence of wear, a mint technician will polish <b>the</b> <b>die</b> and reuse it. However, <b>the</b> <b>die</b> is still rapidly deteriorating, and polishing it cannot avoid the problem of wear. So, after many thousand coins in rapid succession, the wear on <b>the</b> <b>die</b> has gotten so bad that it appears as Die Deterioration Doubling.|$|R
5|$|Benzema {{got off to}} a {{good start}} for the 2008–09 season, scoring twice in Lyon's opening league match against Toulouse. The {{following}} three weeks, he scored goals against Rhône-Alpes rivals Grenoble and Saint-Étienne and scored a goal against Nice, converting a penalty in <b>the</b> <b>dying</b> seconds. Lyon won all three matches. As a result of his early goals, Lyon club president Jean-Michel Aulas quelled the many transfer rumors surrounding Benzema by placing a €100million price tag on the striker. He was also nominated alongside Franck Ribéry to be featured on the French cover of the video game FIFA 09.|$|E
5|$|During the Reformation, Martin Luther {{rejected}} {{many of the}} Catholic Church's seven sacraments, but retained baptism and the Lord's Supper. He {{saw many}} practices of the medieval church as abuses of power intended to require work in order to merit forgiveness for sin after baptism rather than faith alone. Luther attached the promise of salvation to baptism, and taught that life after baptism should be spent in recollection of it and <b>the</b> <b>dying</b> to sin it signified.|$|E

50|$|Broadstrike {{errors are}} {{produced}} when <b>the</b> collar <b>die</b> (<b>the</b> circular <b>die</b> surrounding <b>the</b> lower <b>die)</b> malfunctions. <b>The</b> collar prevents the metal of the blank from flowing outside {{the confines of}} <b>the</b> <b>die.</b> All denominations of U.S. coins with a broadstrike have plain edges.|$|R
25|$|Another {{less obvious}} error can also occur when heating <b>the</b> <b>dies.</b> After being {{taken out of}} the {{annealing}} furnace, <b>the</b> <b>dies</b> must cool for 24 to 36 hours. They are usually given an oil bath to cool them more quickly, but <b>the</b> <b>dies</b> must still cool for a period of several hours. When <b>the</b> <b>dies</b> are cooling, if they are not stored properly or not allowed to fully cool before being used, the result is a much softer <b>die.</b> When <b>the</b> <b>die</b> is subjected to the hubbing press again and work hardened again, it will be softer and more susceptible to wear. If <b>the</b> <b>die</b> is softer because it was not fully cooled, it will not harden to the same standard as a die which has received proper treatment. However, {{there will not be a}} noticeable difference between a good die and a bad die; the change in the structure of <b>the</b> <b>die</b> does is not apparent until it is used for a period of time.|$|R
