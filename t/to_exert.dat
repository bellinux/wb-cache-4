The export of yerba mate and valuable wood products maintained {{the balance of}} trade between Paraguay and the outside world. The Paraguayan government was extremely protectionist, never accepted loans from abroad, and employed high tariffs against the importation of foreign products. This protectionism made the society self-sufficient. This also avoided the debt suffered by Argentina and Brazil.|$|R

5|$|A {{few weeks}} after the duel, Parlement awarded Carrouges a further six {{thousand}} livres in gold and a position within the Royal Household. Such rewards enabled Carrouge to begin further legal action, attempting <b>to</b> <b>exert</b> his earlier claim to Arnou-le-Faucon. However, this land which Carrouges so coveted remained beyond his reach. Count Pierre, who held the land, never forgave Carrouges the death of his favourite, and held the estates from him in court.|$|E
5|$|As the Norse era {{drew to a}} {{close the}} Norse-speaking princes were {{gradually}} replaced by Gaelic-speaking clan chiefs including the MacLeods of Lewis and Harris, the MacDonalds of the Uists and MacNeil of Barra. This transition did little to relieve the islands of internecine strife although by the early 14th century the MacDonald Lords of the Isles, based on Islay, were in theory these chiefs' feudal superiors and managed <b>to</b> <b>exert</b> some control.|$|E

30|$|Bowles et al. (2001) view an {{internal}} locus of control as a type of incentive-enhancing preference that leads internal workers to work harder, ceteris paribus. More fatalistic workers, i.e., those with an external locus of control, on the other hand, believe that their own work effort has less effect on the probability of losing their jobs. Thus, greater fatalism reduces the subjective marginal benefit <b>to</b> <b>exerting</b> effort, thereby reducing desired effort levels.|$|R

This letter analyses the risk-taking behaviour of professional soccer coaches. It is found that risk-taking concerning the kind of observed substitutions is, indeed, relevant.

Kertész, too, was dispensed with when he sought control of all artistic matters; his contract was not renewed when it expired in 1968. His successor as principal conductor was André Previn, who held the post for 11 years – at 2013 the longest tenure of the post to date.|$|E

However, the failure of the Luftwaffe in the Battle of Britain in 1940 ended hopes for an early victory and forced the continuance of hostilities with the British Empire. Faced with German domination of the continent, the only weapon the British could use <b>to</b> <b>exert</b> immediate military pressure on Germany was the night bombing operations of RAF Bomber Command.|$|E

Dos Pilas was a newly founded city in the Petexbatún region, established by Tikal <b>to</b> <b>exert</b> its control over the Pasión River, a strategy that backfired when Calakmul seized control of the fledgling kingdom.|$|E
5|$|The {{so-called}} 'social revolutions' {{following the}} independence proclamation were {{challenges to the}} Dutch-established Indonesian social order, {{and to some extent}} a result of the resentment against Japanese-imposed policies.

5|$|Alboin's {{problems}} in maintaining {{control over his}} people worsened during the siege of Ticinum. The nature of the Lombard monarchy {{made it difficult for}} a ruler <b>to</b> <b>exert</b> the same degree of authority over his subjects as had been exercised by Theodoric over his Goths, and the structure of the army gave great authority to the military commanders or duces, who led each band (fara) of warriors. Additionally, the difficulties encountered by Alboin in building a solid political entity resulted from a lack of imperial legitimacy, as unlike the Ostrogoths, they had not entered Italy as foederati but as enemies of the Empire.|$|E
5|$|Alexander III's {{unexpected}} {{death in}} a riding accident in 1286 precipitated a major succession crisis. Scottish leaders appealed to King Edward I of England for help in determining who was the rightful heir. Edward chose Alexander's three-year-old Norwegian granddaughter, Margaret. On her way to Scotland in 1290, however, Margaret died at sea, and Edward was again asked to adjudicate between 13 rival claimants to the throne. A court was set up and {{after two years of}} deliberation, it pronounced John Balliol to be king. However, Edward proceeded to treat Balliol as a vassal, and tried <b>to</b> <b>exert</b> influence over Scotland. In 1295, when Balliol renounced his allegiance to England, Edward I invaded. During the first ten years of the ensuing Wars of Scottish Independence, Scotland had no monarch, until Robert the Bruce declared himself king in 1306.|$|E

The historian Amara Thornton has suggested that Murray's Indian childhood continued <b>to</b> <b>exert</b> an influence over her throughout her life, expressing the view that Murray could be seen as having a hybrid transnational identity that was both British and Indian. During her childhood, Murray never received a formal education, and in later life expressed pride in {{the fact that she had}} never had to sit an exam before entering university.|$|E
30|$|As {{conceived}} by Rotter, {{locus of control}} captures individuals’ perceptions of the causal link between their own actions and what happens subsequently. Those who believe that external factors (e.g., luck or powerful others) drive outcomes will also believe that the returns <b>to</b> <b>exerting</b> effort are lower and will, therefore, be harder to motivate. This link between locus of control and individuals’ subjective perceptions of the return to effort has ramifications for nearly every conceivable dimension of labor market policy.

Before reaching Kent, the missionaries had considered turning back, but Gregory urged them on, and in 597, Augustine landed on the Isle of Thanet and proceeded to Æthelberht's main town of Canterbury.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1980s, Barre's regime had become {{increasingly}} unpopular. The authorities became ever more totalitarian, and resistance movements, encouraged by Ethiopia's communist Derg administration, sprang {{up across the}} country. This eventually led in 1991 to {{the outbreak of the}} civil war, the toppling of Barre's government, and the disbandment of the Somali National Army. Many of the opposition groups subsequently began competing for influence in the power vacuum that followed the ouster of Barre's regime.
