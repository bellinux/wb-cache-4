25|$|Fires {{start when}} a {{inflammable}} or a combustible material, {{in combination with}} a sufficient quantity of an oxidizer such as oxygen gas or another oxygen-rich compound (though non-oxygen oxidizers exist), is exposed to a source of heat or ambient temperature above the flash point for the fuel/oxidizer mix, {{and is able to}} sustain a rate of rapid oxidation that produces a chain reaction. This is commonly called the fire tetrahedron. Fire cannot exist without all of these elements in place and in the right proportions. For example, an inflammable liquid will start burning only if the fuel and oxygen are in the right proportions. Some fuel-oxygen mixes may require a catalyst, a substance that is not consumed, when added, in any chemical reaction during combustion, but which enables the reactants <b>to</b> <b>combust</b> more readily.|$|E

A properly fired masonry heater has little or no particulate pollution in the exhaust and does not contribute to the buildup of creosote in the heater flues or the chimney. Some stoves achieve as little as 1 to 4grams per hour. This is roughly 90% less smoke than older stoves, and equates to nearly zero visible smoke from the chimney. This is largely achieved through causing the maximum amount of material <b>to</b> <b>combust,</b> which results in a net efficiency of 60 to 70% as contrasted to less than 30% for an open fireplace.

40|$|International {{audience}} Ammonia tepida is {{a dominant}} benthic foraminifer colonizing intertidal mudflat sediments. Horizontal locomotion speeds were monitored using time-lapse image analysis over 6 and 24  h. Experimental conditions {{were based on}} foraminifera exposed to dry sediment re-suspended in artificial sea water (ASW) without any nutrient addition (condition DS), <b>to</b> <b>combusted</b> sediment re-suspended in in ASW also without any nutrient addition (condition CS), or <b>to</b> <b>combusted</b> sediment re-suspended in ASW enriched with either: nitrate, urea, glucose, soil extract (SE), extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), benthic diatoms (Entomoneis paludosa) or natural microphytobenthic assemblages (MPB). Significant differences were already measured after 6  h between A. tepida mean locomotion speeds at the different experimental conditions. However, differences were clearer after 24  h where the slowest A. tepida mean locomotion speed was measured in specimens placed in CS (1. 00  ±  0. 30  mm h−  1) and the highest mean locomotion speed in DS (2. 99  ±  0. 22  mm h−  1). Three different groups were defined according to their locomotion speed, (1) foraminifera exposed to DS had a locomotion speed significantly higher than all other conditions, (2) foraminifera placed in conditions enriched in SE, Glucose, Urea and EPS had intermediary locomotion speeds (1. 8 – 2. 5  mm h−  1), and (3) conditions with foraminifera showing the lowest locomotion speeds (1 – 1. 6  mm h−  1) were CS, nitrate, MPB and E. paludosa. Thus, foraminifera exposed to organic matter (DS, SE, Glucose and Urea) showed faster locomotion speeds than foraminifera exposed to inorganic matter (CS, nitrate) or live preys (E. paludosa, MPB). Dissolved organic matter enrichment enhanced foraminifera locomotion speed, which might be a behavioural response to satisfy their carbon and/or nitrogen requirements, and the lowest locomotion speed observed when feeding on live preys might be a consequence of longer time required for live prey phagocytosis. </p...|$|R

40|$|Metsä Group’s {{next-generation}} bioproduct mill in Äänekoski will be operational within Q 3 / 2017 and it {{will have}} significant regional economic impact on Central Finland. The mill will operate applying principles of circular economy, and thus utilize all possible side streams from pulp production. Lignin {{is one of the}} side streams that has huge potential to be refined, as sustainable products and by creating new value added. Conventionally, lignin is combusted with black liquor to generate energy in pulp mills. This thesis compares this conventional situation to refining lignin into biocomposite products made from 100 % renewable resources with regard to regional economic and environmental impacts. Production impact, employment impact and income effects are estimated using input-output analysis (IOA) in order to estimate regional economic impact. Global warming potential and acidification potential are assessed applying the environmentally extended input-output methodology to estimate environmental impacts of the two cases. The key data was collected from the latest Finnish national input-output tables (2012) and Finnish national emission tables by industry (2012). Crucial information was also gathered from Metsä Group and the Department of Chemistry at University of Jyväskylä. The results of the study indicate that refining lignin has 9 to 14 times higher production impact, employment impact and income effects compared <b>to</b> <b>combusting</b> the same amount of lignin. The global warming and acidification potentials were also higher with refinement, but only 1. 6 to 3 times. One of the key outcomes of the thesis is that the environmental impact cannot be assessed only by the applied method, but also e. g. carbon sequestration and possible product substitution {{must be taken into account}} in the assessment. For the region of Central Finland, refining lignin is interesting option compared <b>to</b> <b>combusting</b> lignin, for it would create significantly more jobs, value added, municipal taxes and multiplier effects. The refinement is aligned with Central Finland ́s Strategy 2040, and it would increase the innovation capital and export potential of the region.

50|$|Liquid {{gasoline}} {{itself is}} not actually burned, but its fumes ignite, causing the remaining liquid to evaporate and then burn. Gasoline is extremely volatile and easily combusts, making any leakage potentially extremely dangerous. Gasoline sold in most countries carries a published octane rating. The octane number is an empirical measure of the resistance of gasoline <b>to</b> <b>combusting</b> prematurely, known as knocking. The higher the octane rating, the more resistant the fuel is to autoignition under high pressures, which allows for a higher compression ratio. Engines with a higher compression ratio, commonly used in race cars and high-performance regular-production automobiles, can produce more power; however, such engines require a higher octane fuel. Increasing the octane rating has, in the past, been achieved by adding 'anti-knock' additives such as lead-tetra-ethyl. Because of {{the environmental impact of}} lead additives, the octane rating is increased today by refining out the impurities that cause knocking.|$|R
