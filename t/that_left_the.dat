5|$|Alabama {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game. After a scoreless first quarter in which Alabama missed two field goals, both teams scored field goals in the second; Alabama also had another attempt blocked {{early in the second}} quarter, <b>that</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> score tied 3–3 at halftime. Alabama took a 6–3 lead in the third, but LSU tied the game at 6–6 in the fourth quarter to send the game into overtime. In the overtime period, Alabama missed a 52-yard field goal. LSU then connected on a 25-yard field goal to win the game 9–6.|$|E
5|$|At each venue, {{the concert}} {{was treated as}} a major event by the local press and {{attended}} by between ten and twenty thousand fans, whose enthusiastic response to the Beatles produced sound levels <b>that</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> music only semi-audible. The tour earned the Beatles over a million dollars in ticket sales. It also stimulated a further increase in record sales, and resulted in the sale of a considerable quantity of Beatle-related merchandise.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the second}} quarter Alabama {{completed}} a 10-play, 58-yard drive by scoring on a two-yard run by backup tailback Trent Richardson. The key plays were a 15-yard pass from McElroy to Darius Hanks and a 13-yard pass from McElroy to Richardson. After an exchange of punts gave Alabama good starting position at the Auburn 45, the Tide quickly struck again with McElroy hitting tight end Colin Peek on a 33-yard touchdown pass <b>that</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> game tied 14–14 at halftime.|$|E

5|$|Saladin {{launched}} his last offensive against Mosul in late 1185, hoping {{for an easy}} victory over a presumably demoralized Mas'ud, but failed due to the city's unexpectedly stiff resistance and a serious illness which caused Saladin to withdraw to Harran. Upon Abbasid encouragement, Saladin and Mas'ud negotiated a treaty in March 1186 <b>that</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> Zengids in control of Mosul, but under the obligation to supply the Ayyubids with military support when requested.|$|E
5|$|By contrast, the 2013–14 {{season was}} plagued by injuries, {{suspensions}} and a high turnover of players, and the Panthers fell to fourth in the final league table. They once again reached the Challenge Cup final, but were considered outsiders against a Belfast Giants team that comfortably won the league championship and finished 32 points ahead of Nottingham. The Panthers lost the first leg 5–2, a result <b>that</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> Giants as strong favourites to lift the cup. However, the Panthers won the second leg 4–1 to level the tie and force overtime. When that finished goalless, goaltender Craig Kowalski saved all three Belfast penalty shots and Petr Kalus scored to give Panthers a 7–6 aggregate victory and a fifth consecutive Challenge Cup.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Barry {{originated}} from a tropical disturbance <b>that</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> Northwestern African coast on August 13. Most of the season, the northwestern tropical Atlantic Ocean had upper-level wind shear, which had inhibited development of systems. Due to these conditions, the disturbance {{was unable to}} strengthen until August 22 as it was approaching the Bahamas. A weak trough moved the disturbance into an area of low wind shear, and the disturbance intensified into Tropical Depression Four {{on the evening of}} August 23. The depression was just to the northeast of the northern Bahamian Islands where it strengthened into Tropical Storm Barry on the morning of August 24.|$|E

5|$|Hurricanes Arlene and Chloe, as well {{as several}} {{tropical}} depressions, originated from tropical waves <b>that</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> coast of Africa. Chloe lasted for 15days, eventually dissipating over France after wrecking a ship offshore northern Spain, killing 14people. Hurricane Doria co-existed with Beulah and Chloe, taking an unusual trajectory over the eastern United States; it killed three people in a boating accident offshore New Jersey. In late September, Tropical Storm Edith was a minimal storm that moved through the Lesser Antilles without serious impact. Hurricane Fern killed three people when it struck Mexico north of Tampico. Tropical Storm Ginger existed in the far eastern Atlantic in early October, and Hurricane Heidi stalled over the northern Atlantic Ocean {{at the end of the}} month.|$|E
5|$|In the battle, {{which took}} place {{primarily}} on a rise about three-quarters of a mile (onekm) from the fort itself, a French army of about 3,600 men under General Louis-Joseph de Montcalm and the Chevalier de Levis decisively defeated an overwhelmingly numerically superior force of British troops under General James Abercrombie, which frontally assaulted an entrenched French position without using field artillery, a lack <b>that</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> British and their allies vulnerable and allowed the French to win a decisive victory. The battle was the bloodiest of the American theater of the war, with over 3,000 casualties suffered. French losses were about 400, while more than 2,000 were British.|$|E
5|$|Moreno {{promoted}} stronger {{measures against}} the royalists. In July, he gave {{orders to the}} neighboring mayors to prevent the creation of secret groups, or activities that could promote alienation. He promoted a new decree of the Junta that called for trial and confiscation of goods for anyone <b>that</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> city without authorization, kept military weapons in secret, promoted popular alienation or discontent against the government, or wrote letters to people in other cities for such a purpose. Serious cases were usually punished with execution or exile. Some rich people exiled by this decree were Francisco Beláustegui, Olaguer Reynals, Norberto de Quirno y Echeandía, and Pablo Villariño. Manuel Andrés Arroyo y Pinedo, another rich man, blamed Moreno for these actions, accusing him of equaling disagreement with antipatriotism, and felt that the ideas of egalitarianism would only cause great evils. Those measures were also criticized by moderate supporters of the revolution, such as Gregorio Funes from Córdoba, who rejected the lack of proper trials, or Dámaso Uriburu, from Salta, who compared Moreno, Castelli, and Vieytes with the French Jacobins.|$|E

5|$|Olaf {{formed from}} a {{tropical}} wave <b>that</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> coast of Africa on September 17. Over {{the next two}} weeks it moved westbound into the East Pacific Ocean. Initially, the wave was not in an environment conductive for further development. However, on October 2, a low-level circulation was noted on satellite imagery. This circulation quickly became better defined over the next several hours while located 400 miles (645km) south of Acapulco, Mexico. The next day, Dvorak Classifications, a tool that estimates a tropical cyclone intensity, were placed at 1.5. This is equivalent to winds of around 30mph (50km/h). In addition, a ship nearby reported winds of 35mph (45km/h). Microwave imagery also indicated that the center was near the associated convection. Based on this, the system was upgraded into a tropical depression.|$|E
5|$|On 15 January 2013 former fcbusiness {{magazine}} editor Ryan McKnight was named {{as the new}} Chief Executive Officer at the club, becoming the youngest CEO in UK football. Fourteen months into his second spell at Edgeley Park and with County in the relegation zone, Gannon was fired as Stockport County boss following the 3–1 home defeat by Mansfield Town on 16 January 2013. He was replaced by Darije Kalezić, who initially saw an upturn in results, but left the position himself two months later following a poor run <b>that</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> club in serious danger of relegation to the Conference North. Ian Bogie in turn succeeded Kalezić, {{but was unable to}} turn the club's form around, and they were relegated to the Conference North on the final day after a defeat to title challengers Kidderminster Harriers.|$|E
5|$|Pregame {{media and}} fan {{interest}} surrounding the game focused largely on Louisville's top-ranked offense and Virginia Tech's first-ranked scoring defense. Other major points of media coverage included the two teams' quarterbacks: Louisville's Hunter Cantwell, who replaced starter Brian Brohm after Brohm suffered a season-ending knee injury; and Virginia Tech's Marcus Vick, brother of National Football League star Michael Vick. Also {{a concern for}} Louisville was the health of star running back Michael Bush, who missed two games in November due to an injury. On a wider note, there was also interest in the conference-level showdown between a new Big East team (Louisville) and a team <b>that</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> Big East for the ACC after the 2003 season (Virginia Tech). For Virginia Tech, {{there was also the}} hope of overcoming the disappointment of a season that saw the Hokies ranked third in the country and in the hunt for the national championship before failing to even win the Atlantic Coast Conference and missing a bid to a Bowl Championship Series game.|$|E

5|$|Richard {{clashed with}} Roger de Pont L'Evêque, the Archbishop of York, over the {{respective}} {{rights of the}} two sees throughout his time as archbishop. In 1175, at a council held in London, there was a fight between their supporters. King Henry II managed to secure a truce for five years between the two archbishops but Richard was soon embroiled in another dispute. This one was with Roger, abbot of St Augustine's Abbey in Canterbury and revolved around {{whether or not the}} abbey depended directly on the pope or if the archbishop had jurisdictional rights over the abbey. In the end, the papacy arranged a settlement <b>that</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> abbey dependent on the pope direct, but gave the archbishop spiritual authority over the churches of the Isle of Thanet, which had previously been held by the abbey.|$|E
5|$|Tests {{were carried}} out {{starting}} in October 1940, and quickly demonstrated a number of minor problems. One of the minor issues is that the crosshairs on the tube that indicated the center would block the spot. A more serious concern {{was the lack of}} range information, which the FIU pilots considered critical. Hanbury Brown went to work on these issues, and returned an updated version in December. A U-shaped reticle {{in the center of the}} display provided a centre location <b>that</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> spot visible. Additionally, the circuitry included a second timebase that produced a longer signal as the fighter approached its target. The output was timed so the line was centred horizontally on the dot. This presented the range in an easily understandable fashion; the line looked like the wings of an aircraft, which naturally grow larger as the fighter approaches it.|$|E
5|$|The I-6 had an oval-section {{semi-monocoque}} fuselage {{covered with}} 'shpon', molded birch plywood, {{with a small}} headrest faired into the fuselage, although the engine was enclosed in a metal cowling <b>that</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> cylinder heads exposed for better cooling. The two-spar wings were covered in plywood and fabric and had a Clark Y profile. Internal bracing wires were fitted to reinforce the wings. The control surfaces were framed in duralumin, but covered in fabric. The duralumin N-type struts that separated the wings, and attached the upper wing to the fuselage, had a teardrop profile. They were reinforced with steel bracing wires. The conventional undercarriage was fixed with rubber shock absorbers. The wooden propeller was given a spinner. The lighter weight of the air-cooled Jupiter engine, which required neither a heavy radiator nor coolant, meant that the I-6 had an empty weight only 62% of that of the I-3.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} Manuel {{can be traced}} back to a {{tropical}} wave <b>that</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> African continent in late August. The wave entered the Caribbean Sea on September 5, although the northern portion of the wave axis later developed into Hurricane Ingrid. On September10, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) remarked the potential for a low-pressure area to develop off the southwest coast of Mexico during the subsequent few days, provided the system remained offshore. The next day, a low formed while it was nearly stationary, accompanied by scattered convection. Strong wind shear and proximity to land were expected to limit development, although conditions became more favorable on September12. On that day, the convection became better organized. At 1200UTC on September13, the NHC initiated advisories on Tropical Depression Thirteen-E, noting that the system had enough of a well-defined circulation and convection. By that time, wind shear had diminished and warm waters were expected to allow intensification, and the main inhibiting factors for development were proximity to Mexico and association with the intertropical convergence zone.|$|E
5|$|The {{program was}} {{directed}} by Daniel De Felippo and Rodolfo Antúnez, and produced by César Markus González. Most of the filming occurred {{at the headquarters of}} Pol-ka in the Colegiales neighborhood. The telenovela took several risks in the creative and production fields, which were mostly successful. The choice of Martín Quesada's background as a Formula 1 driver required an area with a large infrastructure to represent realistic races. For realism, plot scenes set outside Buenos Aires were actually filmed outside the city. There was significant press coverage during the location shooting in Germany, which took place during the 2006 FIFA World Cup. Facundo Arana and Natalia Oreiro played their characters in the Veltins-Arena stadium during the Argentina-Serbia and Montenegro match. The result of the matcha 6–0 Argentine victorybenefited the filming, and the episode received 31.5 rating points. Location shooting also occurred in the tourist ski resort Las Leñas in the Andes. A simulated aircraft crash <b>that</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> characters in a jungle was filmed at the Pereyra Iraola park and an Argentine Air Force park in Morón.|$|E
5|$|At {{this point}} in the campaign, the Austrian command staff was in full confusion. Ferdinand began to openly oppose Mack's command style and decisions, {{charging}} that the latter spent his days writing contradictory orders <b>that</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> Austrian army marching back and forth. On 13 October Mack sent two columns out of Ulm in preparation for a breakout to the north: one under Johann Sigismund Riesch headed towards Elchingen to secure the bridge there and the other under Franz von Werneck went north with most of the heavy artillery. Ney hurried his corps forward to reestablish contact with Dupont, who was still north of the Danube. Ney led Loison's division to the south of Elchingen on the right bank of the Danube to begin the attack. Malher's division crossed the river farther east and moved west toward Riesch's position. The field was a partially wooded flood plain, rising steeply to the hill town of Elchingen, which had a wide field of view. The French cleared the Austrian pickets from a bridge, then a regiment boldly attacked and captured the abbey {{at the top of the}} hill at bayonet point. During the Battle of Elchingen, the Austrian cavalry was also defeated and Reisch's infantry fled toward Ulm. Ney was given the title Duke of Elchingen for his impressive victory.|$|E
