5|$|Michael Tolkin and David Hayter rewrote {{the script}} afterwards, despite {{positive}} {{response from the}} producers over France's script. Tolkin was brought in January 2000, while Hayter was brought in September of that year. Hayter's draft featured The Leader, Zzzax, and the Absorbing Man as the villains, who are depicted as colleagues of Banner and {{get caught in the}} same accident <b>that</b> <b>creates</b> <b>the</b> Hulk. Director Ang Lee and his producing partner James Schamus became involved with the film in January 20, 2001. Lee was dissatisfied with Hayter's script, and commissioned Schamus for a rewrite, merging Banner's father with the Absorbing Man. Lee cited influences from King Kong, Frankenstein, Jekyll and Hyde, Beauty and the Beast, Faust, and Greek mythology for his interpretation of the story. Schamus said he had found the storyline that introduced Brian Banner, thus allowing Lee to write a drama that again explored father-son themes.|$|E
5|$|As {{a form of}} express trust, {{charitable}} trusts {{are subject}} to certain formalities, {{as well as the}} requirements of the three certainties, when being created. These vary depending on whether the gift <b>that</b> <b>creates</b> <b>the</b> trust is given in life, given after death, or includes land. If the gift is given after death through a will, the will must comply with Section 9 of the Wills Act 1837, which requires that the will be in writing and signed by the testator (or somebody else present, at the testator's instruction), {{it is clear that the}} testator intended to give effect to the will, and the signature is made or noted by two or more witnesses. If these are all carried out, the will is a valid document, and the gift made as part of it can create a charitable trust. If the gift is of land and made during the donor's lifetime, it must comply with Section 53(1)(b) of the Law of Property Act 1925, which requires that the agreement be a written document signed by the person giving it. If the gift is of personal property and made inter vivos, there are no formal requirements; it is enough that an oral declaration is made creating the trust. Once constituted properly, a charitable trust, like all express trusts, cannot be undone unless there is something allowing that within the trust instrument.|$|E

25|$|In high-ester pectins at soluble {{solids content}} above 60% and a pH-value between 2.8 and 3.6, {{hydrogen}} bonds and hydrophobic interactions bind the individual pectin chains together. These bonds form as water is bound by sugar and forces pectin strands to stick together. These form a 3-dimensional molecular net <b>that</b> <b>creates</b> <b>the</b> macromolecular gel. The gelling-mechanism {{is called a}} low-water-activity gel or sugar-acid-pectin gel.|$|E
25|$|Another {{example is}} shown to the right in the brick patterns. The top image shows the effects when the {{sampling}} theorem's condition is not satisfied. When software rescales an image (the same process <b>that</b> <b>creates</b> <b>the</b> thumbnail shown in the lower image) it, in effect, runs the image through a low-pass filter first and then downsamples the image {{to result in a}} smaller image that does not exhibit the moiré pattern. The top image is what happens when the image is downsampled without low-pass filtering: aliasing results.|$|E

25|$|An {{axial fan}} {{is a type}} of a {{compressor}} that increases the pressure of the air flowing through it. The blades of the axial flow fans force air to move parallel to the shaft about which the blades rotate. In other words, the flow is axially in and axially out, linearly, hence their name. The design priorities in an axial fan revolve around the design of the propeller <b>that</b> <b>creates</b> <b>the</b> pressure difference and hence the suction force that retains the flow across the fan. The main components that need to be studied in the designing of the propeller include the number of blades and the design of each blade. Their applications include propellers in aircraft, helicopters, hovercraft, ships and hydrofoils. They are also used in wind tunnels and cooling towers. If the propeller is exercising propulsion, then efficiency is the only parameter of interest and other parameters like power required and flow rate are considered of no interest. In case the propeller is used as a fan, the parameters of interest includes power, flow rate, pressure rise and efficiency.|$|E
25|$|The Full Text Search {{engine is}} divided into two {{processes}}: the Filter Daemon process (msftefd.exe) and the Search process (msftesql.exe). These processes interact with the SQL Server. The Search process includes the indexer (<b>that</b> <b>creates</b> <b>the</b> full text indexes) and the full text query processor. The indexer scans through text columns in the database. It can also index through binary columns, and use iFilters to extract meaningful text from the binary blob (for example, when a Microsoft Word document is stored as an unstructured binary file in a database). The iFilters are hosted by the Filter Daemon process. Once the text is extracted, the Filter Daemon process breaks it up into a sequence of words and hands it over to the indexer. The indexer filters out noise words, i.e., words like A, And etc., which occur frequently and are not useful for search. With the remaining words, an inverted index is created, associating each word with the columns they were found in. SQL Server itself includes a Gatherer component that monitors changes to tables and invokes the indexer in case of updates.|$|E
500|$|The Seventh Circuit also {{rejected}} Hemi's {{argument that}} its sales to Illinois customers {{were due to}} the unilateral actions by customers.

("It is Hemi reaching out to residents of Illinois, and not the residents reaching back, <b>that</b> <b>creates</b> <b>the</b> sufficient minimum contacts with Illinois that justify exercising personal jurisdiction over Hemi in Illinois.") ...|$|E

500|$|Soring is the {{practice}} of applying irritants or blistering agents to the front feet or forelegs of a horse, making it pick its feet up higher in an exaggerated manner <b>that</b> <b>creates</b> <b>the</b> movement or [...] "action" [...] desired in the show ring. Soring {{is an act of}} animal cruelty that gives practitioners an unfair advantage over other competitors. The Horse Protection Act is enforced by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), a branch of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Although violations of the law are seen most often in the Tennessee Walking Horse industry, the Horse Protection Act covers all breeds.|$|E
500|$|The {{best known}} {{landmark}} in Point Loma is the Old Point Loma lighthouse, an icon occasionally {{used to represent}} the entire city of San Diego. (It is sometimes incorrectly {{referred to as the}} [...] "Old Spanish Lighthouse"; in fact it was built after California was admitted to the United States.) Perched atop the southern point <b>that</b> <b>creates</b> <b>the</b> entrance of the bay with Coronado, the small, two story lighthouse was completed in 1854 and first lit on November 15, 1855. At [...] above sea level at the entrance of the bay, the seemingly good location for a lighthouse soon proved to be a poor choice, as fog and cloud within the marine layer often obscured the beam for ocean-going vessels.|$|E
500|$|Typically (see Fig.1, the {{well-known}} Michelson configuration) a single incoming beam of coherent light will be {{split into two}} identical beams by a beam splitter (a partially reflecting mirror). [...] Each of these beams travels a different route, called a path, and they are recombined before arriving at a detector. The path difference, {{the difference in the}} distance traveled by each beam, creates a phase difference between them. It is this introduced phase difference <b>that</b> <b>creates</b> <b>the</b> interference pattern between the initially identical waves. If a single beam has been split along two paths, then the phase difference is diagnostic of anything that changes the phase along the paths. This could be a physical change in the path length itself or a change in the refractive index along the path.|$|E

500|$|The tentacles bear cilia (fine mobile hairs) {{on their}} edges {{and along the}} center. The beating of the outer cilia drives a water current from {{the tips of the}} tentacles to their bases, where it exits. Food {{particles}} that collide with the tentacles are trapped by mucus, and the cillia down the middle drive this mixture {{to the base of the}} tentacles. A brachial groove runs round the bases of the tentacles, and its own cilia pass food along the groove towards the mouth. The method used by brachiopods is known as [...] "upstream collecting", as food particles are captured as they enter the field of cilia <b>that</b> <b>creates</b> <b>the</b> feeding current. This method is used by the related phoronids and bryozoans, and also by pterobranchs. Entoprocts use a similar-looking crown of tentacles, but it is solid and the flow runs from bases to tips, forming a [...] "downstream collecting" [...] system that catches food particles as they are about to exit.|$|E
500|$|The 1601 Act {{stated that}} {{charities}} {{for the benefit}} of the [...] "aged, impotent and poor people" [...] had an appropriate purpose; it is accepted that these may appear individually. A charity does not have to be {{for the benefit of}} people who are both poor, impotent and aged to be valid, only one of them. [...] "Poverty" [...] is a subjective term, and in Re Coulthurst, Sir Raymond Evershed indicated that it should be treated as such; [...] "poverty, of course, does not mean destitution... it [...] persons who have to 'go short'... due regard being had to their status in life and so forth". This appears to indicate that a millionaire who loses half of his income may be considered [...] "poor", in that he is unable to have the lifestyle he is accustomed to. Some limits were set to this provision by Lord Simonds in IRC v Baddeley, where he wrote that: [...] The gift <b>that</b> <b>creates</b> <b>the</b> charitable trust, whatever the definition of poverty accepted by the courts, must be for the poor and nobody else. In Re Gwyon, money was left to provide short trousers to children in Farnham. While this was a necessity under the standard definition of poverty, the gift was not limited to the poor, and instead went to every child in the area. As a result, the trust failed.|$|E
500|$|The {{popularity}} of Dota 2 led Valve to produce apparel, accessories, posters, {{and a number}} of other products featuring the heroes and other elements from the game. In addition, Valve secured licensing contracts with third-party producers; the first of these deals concerned a Dota 2 themed SteelSeries mousepad, which was announced at Gamescom 2011. In September 2012, Weta Workshop, the prop studio <b>that</b> <b>creates</b> <b>the</b> [...] "Aegis of Champions" [...] trophy for winners of The International, announced a product line that would include statues, weapons, and armor based on Dota 2 characters and items. In February 2013, the National Entertainment Collectibles Association announced a new toy line featuring hero-themed action figures at the American International Toy Fair. At Gamescom 2015, an HTC Vive virtual reality (VR) tech demo based around the shopkeeper of the game's item shop was showcased, allowing participants to interact with various items and objects from the game in VR. The demo, known as Secret Shop, was later included on The Lab, Valve's virtual reality compilation game, the following year. After the conclusion of The International 2015, Valve awarded the Collector's Aegis of Champions, which was a 1/5th scale brass replica of the Aegis of Champions trophy, to those with compendiums of 1,000 levels or more. Valve awarded the Collector's Aegis again the following year for The International 2016, as well as selling a limited edition Dota 2 themed HTC Vive virtual reality headset during the event. In July 2017, an 18-track official soundtrack was released by Ipecac Recordings, including a version on vinyl. A collectible card game based on elements from Dota 2, titled Artifact, will be released in 2018.|$|E

2500|$|A similar {{proposal}} by those advocating this diet suggests that cancer grows in an acidic environment, {{and that a}} proper alkaline diet can change {{the environment of the}} body to treat cancer.

2500|$|Dilated {{cardiomyopathy}} [...] {{and many}} congenital heart diseases are also {{commonly found in}} the Great Dane, leading to its nickname: the heartbreak breed, in conjunction with its shorter lifespan. Great Danes also may carry the merle gene, {{which is part of}} the genetic makeup <b>that</b> <b>creates</b> <b>the</b> harlequin coloring. The merle gene is an incomplete dominant, meaning only one copy of the gene is needed to show the merle coloring; two merle genes produce excessive white markings and many health issues such as deafness, blindness, or other debilitating ocular issues. Great Danes can also develop wobbler disease, a condition affecting the vertebral column. Since these dogs do grow at a rapid rate, the bones in their vertebae can push up against the spinal cord and cause weakness in the legs. This can be treated with surgery or may heal itself over time.|$|E
