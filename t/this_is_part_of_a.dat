5|$|Critics {{have complained}} that, by museum {{display of the}} remains, the body of Lindow Man has been {{objectified}} rather than treated with the respect due the dead.

25|$|Devolving {{power to}} consumers.

25|$|Douglas' {{work only}} touches on race {{directly}} {{in a few}} instances, such as the short video I'm Not Gary (1991).

For Coulthard, the lack of mention of race in works that feature only white performers troubles any racial reading of Douglas' work.|$|E

25|$|The Swedish Armed Forces {{recently}} {{underwent a}} transformation from conscription-based recruitment {{to a professional}} defense organisation. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> larger goal to abandon the mass army from the Cold War and develop an army better suited to modern maneuver warfare {{and at the same}} time retain a higher readiness. Since 2014, the Swedish army has had around 50,000 soldiers in either full-time or part-time duty, with eight mechanized infantry battalions instantly available at any time and the full force of 71 battalions ready to be deployed within one week. The regular army consists of 8 mechanized maneuver battalions, 19 support battalions of different kinds including artillery battalions, anti-aircraft battalions, combat engineer battalions, rangers, logistics battalions and 4 reserve heavy armored battalions and 40 territorial defense battalions. The battalion is the core unit but all units are completely modular and can be arranged in combat teams from company to brigade level with different units depending on the task. There are a total of 6 permanent staffs under the central command capable of handling large battlegroups, 4 regional staffs and 2 brigade staffs.|$|E
