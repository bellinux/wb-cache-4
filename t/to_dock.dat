5|$|Although Carnival Cruise Lines did {{not operate}} from Mobile after the Carnival Fantasy left in 2011, the Carnival Triumph was towed into the port {{following}} a crippling engine room fire. It {{was the largest}} cruise ship ever <b>to</b> <b>dock</b> at the cruise terminal in Mobile. Later it was eclipsed by the Carnival Conquest, which docked in Mobile when the Port of New Orleans was temporarily closed. Larger commercial ships routinely arrive at the Port of Mobile.|$|E
5|$|Another such ill-fated {{settlement}} was Canemah, {{located near the}} Willamette Falls. Canemah prospered until 1861, when the same great flood swept most of the town over the falls. Even after reconstruction, much of the town's importance to river commerce ended in 1873 with completion of the Willamette Falls Locks. Ships no longer needed <b>to</b> <b>dock</b> and unload goods and passengers for portage around the falls. The remaining town officially survived until 1929, when it was annexed to Oregon City.|$|E

The municipal flood control headquarters in Shanghai also asked officials {{to prepare for the}} approaching typhoon, which was forecast to begin affecting the city on July 9.|$|E
5|$|As Queen Mary 2 is {{too large}} <b>to</b> <b>dock</b> in many ports, {{passengers}} are ferried {{to and from the}} ship in tenders, which can be used as lifeboats in an emergency. These are stored while at sea in davits alongside the lifeboats. To transport passengers to shore the tenders pull up to one of four loading stations, each of which has a large hull door that hydraulically opens outwards to form a boarding platform, complete with railings and decking.|$|E
5|$|Australia sailed for Devonport, Devon in mid-February 1913 {{to begin}} her {{acceptance}} trials. Testing of the guns, torpedoes, and machinery was successful, {{but it was}} discovered that two hull plates had been damaged during the launch, requiring the battlecruiser <b>to</b> <b>dock</b> for repairs. Australia was commissioned into the RAN at Portsmouth on 21 June 1913. Two days later, Rear Admiral George Patey, the first Rear Admiral Commanding Australian Fleet, raised his flag aboard Australia.|$|E

5|$|Before the Suez Canal {{was opened}} in 1869, the Indonesian {{archipelago}} was reached via the Sunda Strait from Africa. From the Suez Canal, {{the route to}} Indonesia is shorter via the Malacca Strait. Due to its natural harbour with relatively deep and well sheltered water, the Dutch East Indies government decided to open Sabang as a quay. In 1883, Sabang quay was opened for ships <b>to</b> <b>dock</b> by the Atjeh Associate. At first, the harbour {{was intended as a}} coal station for the Dutch navy, but later also served merchant vessels and for the transfer of export goods from northern Sumatra.|$|E
5|$|Lifting off and {{entering}} orbit, Ross attempts <b>to</b> <b>dock</b> with Phoenix. However, Doppelganger experiences a technical malfunction. The shuttle detaches from Phoenix and falls {{through the atmosphere}} towards the Space Centre. EUROSEC is unable to repair the fault from the ground, and Doppelganger crashes into a parked spacecraft. Ross is incinerated in the collision and a chain reaction destroys much of the Space Centre, killing personnel and destroying all records of Ross's presence on the Counter-Earth.|$|E
