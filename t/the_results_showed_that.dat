However, on 23 April 2011 Makemake passed in front of an 18th-magnitude star and abruptly blocked its light. <b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> Makemake presently lacks a substantial atmosphere and placed an upper limit of 4–12 nanobar on the pressure at its surface.|$|E
5|$|A later La Brea pits study {{compared}} tooth breakage of dire {{wolves in}} two time periods. One pit contained fossil dire wolves dated 15,000YBP and another dated 13,000YBP. <b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> the 15,000YBP dire wolves had {{three times more}} tooth breakage than the 13,000YBP dire wolves, whose breakage matched those of nine modern carnivores. The study concluded that between 15,000–14,000YBP prey availability was less or competition was higher for dire wolves, and that by 13,000YBP, as the prey species moved towards extinction, predator competition had declined and therefore the frequency of tooth breakage in dire wolves had also declined.|$|E
5|$|Adults who {{do believe}} that zero is even can {{nevertheless}} be unfamiliar with thinking of it as even, enough so to measurably slow them down in a reaction time experiment. Stanislas Dehaene, {{a pioneer in the}} field of numerical cognition, led a series of such experiments in the early 1990s. A numeral or a number word is flashed to the subject on a monitor, and a computer records the time it takes the subject to push one of two buttons to identify the number as odd or even. <b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> 0 was slower to process than other even numbers. Some variations of the experiment found delays as long as 60 milliseconds or about 10% of the average reaction time—a small difference but a significant one.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, Sandi Willows-Munro (of the University of KwaZulu-Natal) {{and colleagues}} {{carried out a}} {{mitochondrial}} analysis of the nine Tragelaphus species. mtDNA and nDNA data were compared. <b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> the tribe Tragelaphini is monophyletic with the lesser kudu basal in the phylogeny, followed by the nyala (T. angasii). On the basis of mitochondrial data, studies have estimated that the lesser kudu separated from its sister clade around 13.7 million years ago. On the other hand, the nuclear data shows that lesser kudu and nyala form a clade, and collectively separated from the sister clade 13.8 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the areas}} of focus on object {{permanence}} has been how physical disabilities (blindness, cerebral palsy and deafness) and intellectual disabilities (Down syndrome, etc.) affect the development of object permanence. In a study that was performed in 1975-76, <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> the only area where children with intellectual disabilities performed more weakly than children without disabilities was {{along the lines of}} social interaction. Other tasks, such as imitation and causality tasks, were performed more weakly by the children without disabilities. However, object permanence was still acquired similarly because it was not related to social interaction.|$|E
