The front, premolar and molar region of two adult human cadaver skulls jaws were imaged using the X-ray tube at 63 kV and 70 kV, both at 8 mA and decreasing exposure times (160 ms, 120 ms and 80 ms). A standardized exposure protocol containing waxed occlusal keys and an aiming device ensured proper and reproducible beam alignment. Three observers assessed the digital radiographs for 31 selected periodontal bone loss sites. Radiographic measurements were compared to physical measurements (Standard). Subjective ratings of lamina dura, crater defect and furcation involvement visibility, contrast perception and bone quality were also performed.

This study was carried out to analyse the effect of different <b>tube</b> <b>voltages</b> on HU for various tissue substitutes in phantom and their dosimetric impact on dose calculation in TPS due to variation in HU–relative electron density (RED) calibration curves. Materials and Methods: HU for different density materials was obtained from CT images of the phantom acquired at various <b>tube</b> <b>voltages.</b> HU-RED calibration curves were drawn from CT images with various tissue substitutes acquired at different <b>tube</b> <b>voltages</b> used to quantify the error in dose calculation for different algorithms.

Results: No significant variation was observed in HU of different density materials for various kVp values. Doses calculated with applying different HU-RED calibration curves were well within 1 %. Conclusion: Variation in doses calculated by algorithms with various HU-RED calibration curves was found to be well within 1 %.

50|$|Enough {{of the air}} {{has been}} removed from the tube that most of the {{electrons}} can travel the length of the tube without striking a gas molecule.

When they get to the anode end of the tube, they have so much momentum that, although they are attracted to the anode, many fly past it and strike the end wall of the tube. When they strike atoms in the glass, they knock their orbital electrons into a higher energy level. When the electrons fall back to their original energy level, they emit light. This process, called fluorescence, causes the glass to glow, usually yellow-green. The electrons themselves are invisible, but the glow reveals where the beam of electrons strikes the glass. Later on, researchers painted the inside back wall of the tube with a phosphor, a fluorescent chemical such as zinc sulfide, {{in order to make the}} glow more visible. After striking the wall, the electrons eventually make their way to the anode, flow through the anode wire, the power supply, and back to the cathode.|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{assess the}} effect of an {{automatic}} <b>tube</b> <b>voltage</b> selection technique on image quality and radiation dose in abdominal computed tomography (CT) angiography of various body sizes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An abdominal aortic phantom was filled with iodinated contrast medium and placed into three different cylindrical water containers, which simulated a small, intermediate-sized, and large patient. The phantom was scanned with a standard 120  kVp abdominal CT angiography protocol and with an optimized <b>tube</b> <b>voltage</b> protocol that was modulated by an automatic <b>tube</b> <b>voltage</b> technique. The attenuation of the aorta, background, and image noise was measured, and the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) was calculated. Three independent readers assessed the overall image quality. RESULTS: The automatic <b>tube</b> <b>voltage</b> technique selected 70  kVp as the optimal <b>tube</b> <b>voltage</b> for the small phantom, 80  kVp for the intermediate phantom, and 100  kVp for the large phantom. Compared to the standard 120  kVp protocol, the automatic <b>tube</b> <b>voltage</b> selection yielded significantly increased CNR values in the small phantom (15. 8 versus 19. 4, p <  0. 001), intermediate phantom (8. 4 versus 8. 7, p <  0. 05), and large phantom (4. 3 versus 4. 6, p <  0. 01). The automatic <b>tube</b> <b>voltage</b> selection resulted in a 55 %, 49 %, and 39 % reduction in the volume CT dose index (CTDI(vol)) in the small, intermediate, and large phantoms, respectively. The subjective overall image quality of the three phantom sizes at different tube voltages ranged between poor and good.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{techniques that}} can be used to improve the ratio of fluorescence to bremsstrahlung radiation (F/B) in X-ray tube spectra. Firstly, an extension of the EGS 4 code system is used to evaluate the impact of the substrate in thin target applications, in terms of the yield of bremsstrahlung photons produced. The choice of materials to filter X-ray tube spectra, and its effect in the F/B and the tube efficiency is discussed. The characteristics of spectra produced in transmission tubes with different target thicknesses, substrates and <b>tube</b> <b>voltages</b> are also presented. [URL]...|$|R
30|$|Elements in OC and AC whose atomic numbers {{exceeded}} eleven {{were detected}} by X-ray fluorescence measurements using a compact spectrometer (MESA- 500, HORIBA, Ltd.). X-ray irradiation {{was carried out}} at ambient temperature. A sample chamber set in a cylindrical Teflon cell with a diameter of 20  mm containing about 0.5  g of powder OC or AC was evacuated. The measurement time was 2000 s. X-ray <b>tube</b> <b>voltages</b> were 15 and 50  kV. Relative mass percentages of elements to total elements detected by X-ray measurement were calculated by a standardless fundamental parameter method [9, 10] from the characteristic X-ray intensities.|$|R
