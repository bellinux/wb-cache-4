5000|$|In March 2010 the London Assembly {{authorised}} {{a review}} {{into the future}} of London TravelWatch, undertaken by the Business and Management Committee. The Committee was empowered to examine the effectiveness of London TravelWatch as an advocate body for transport users. As part of this process, user groups across London alongside elected representatives made submissions to the Committee. In September 2010 the Committee published its findings, chiefly to recommend London TravelWatch be abolished. This was the only option put forward by the GLA {{for the future of}} <b>transport</b> <b>user</b> representation in London. (Other options that could have been considered, but were not, were to either merge London TravelWatch completely with Transport Passenger Focus (now Transport Focus), or to leave TravelWatch as a stand-alone body, but with reduced functions.) The Committee argued there was too much duplication between London TravelWatch and the national watchdog Passenger Focus that the cost of London TravelWatch was too great, and that transport users interests would be better represented by elected politicians rather than a board composed of residents of the London TravelWatch area appointed after open competition on the basis of merit. It was proposed that rail matters in London, including complaints, be handled by Passenger Focus. For other transport modes the complaints (appeals) function was to be transferred to a complaints unit which would be part of the London Assembly. The remaining functions of the Board (which would cease to exist) would be carried out by the elected members of the Transport Committee.|$|E

An efficient and effective transport system can significantly support the economic growth. Industry expects an effective and efficient transport system to support sustainable economic growth and enable it to compete in state, national and global markets. It expects an interconnected system of roads, rail, pipelines, ports and airports to ensure products reach markets quickly, efficiently and in good condition. Transport users are important economic agents {{from this point of}} view. Because people are creators of markets, are inputs to production and consumers of goods and services. The transport task in relation to people is therefore complex. <b>Transport</b> <b>user</b> is so very important part of the transportation planning process.

40|$|<b>Transport</b> <b>user</b> {{benefits}} are {{of great importance}} in cost benefit analysis when appraising transport projects. Generally they have {{the greatest impact on}} the results of cost-benefit analyses. It is common to adopt the consumer surplus for calculating <b>transport</b> <b>user</b> benefits. The consumer surplus measure is based on the underlying demand model and follows from the integration of the demand curve. If the popular logit model is used for forecasting travel demand, consumer surplus measure takes a closed form (the “logsum”) that is easy to calculate. Furthermore, in cost-benefit analyses the change in consumer surplus between an initial and final state is needed, which can be easily derived by the difference of the logsums of the two states. This logsum approach is proven and correct for travel demand models based on the logit model without multiple constraints. However, for travel demand models dealing with two or more sets of constraints the logsum approach fails. In this paper we describe a mathematical approach for a <b>transport</b> <b>user</b> benefits measure that corresponds to the consumer surplus and is universal for all travel demand models with constraints. We exemplarily derive the measure for a doubly constrained trip distribution. The applicability of the derived approach is shown by a small example...|$|E
