25|$|Acidithiobacillus caldus {{formerly}} {{belonged to}} the genus <b>Thiobacillus</b> prior to 2000, when it was reclassified along {{with a number of}} other bacterial species into one of three new genera that better categorize sulfur-oxidizing acidophiles.|$|E
25|$|Extracellular endosymbionts {{are also}} {{represented}} {{in all four}} extant classes of Echinodermata (Crinoidea, Ophiuroidea, Echinoidea, and Holothuroidea). Little is known {{of the nature of}} the association (mode of infection, transmission, metabolic requirements, etc.) but phylogenetic analysis indicates that these symbionts belong to the alpha group of the class Proteobacteria, relating them to Rhizobium and <b>Thiobacillus.</b> Other studies indicate that these subcuticular bacteria may be both abundant within their hosts and widely distributed among the Echinoderms in general.|$|E
2500|$|Food webs have trophic {{levels and}} positions. Basal species, such as plants, form {{the first level}} and are the {{resource}} limited species that feed on no other living creature in the web. Basal species can be autotrophs or detritivores, including [...] "decomposing organic material and its associated microorganisms which we defined as detritus, micro-inorganic material and associated microorganisms (MIP), and vascular plant material." [...] Most autotrophs capture the sun's energy in chlorophyll, but some autotrophs (the chemolithotrophs) obtain energy by the chemical oxidation of inorganic compounds and can grow in dark environments, such as the sulfur bacterium <b>Thiobacillus,</b> which lives in hot sulfur springs. The top level has top (or apex) predators which no other species kills directly for its food resource needs. The intermediate levels are filled with omnivores that feed {{on more than one}} trophic level and cause energy to flow through a number of food pathways starting from a basal species.|$|E
2500|$|Sulfur {{oxidation}} {{involves the}} oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds (such as sulfide [...] ), inorganic sulfur (S), and thiosulfate (...) to form sulfuric acid (...) [...] [...] A {{classic example of}} a sulfur-oxidizing bacterium is Beggiatoa, a microbe originally described by Sergei Winogradsky, {{one of the founders}} of environmental microbiology. Another example is Paracoccus. Generally, the oxidation of sulfide occurs in stages, with inorganic sulfur being stored either inside or outside of the cell until needed. [...] This two step process occurs because energetically sulfide is a better electron donor than inorganic sulfur or thiosulfate, allowing for a greater number of protons to be translocated across the membrane. [...] Sulfur-oxidizing organisms generate reducing power for carbon dioxide fixation via the Calvin cycle using reverse electron flow, an energy-requiring process that pushes the electrons against their thermodynamic gradient to produce NADH. [...] Biochemically, reduced sulfur compounds are converted to sulfite (...) and subsequently converted to sulfate (...) by the enzyme sulfite oxidase. [...] Some organisms, however, accomplish the same oxidation using a reversal of the APS reductase system used by sulfate-reducing bacteria (see above). [...] In all cases the energy liberated is transferred to the electron transport chain for ATP and NADH production. [...] In addition to aerobic sulfur oxidation, some organisms (e.g. <b>Thiobacillus</b> denitrificans) use nitrate (...) as a terminal electron acceptor and therefore grow anaerobically.|$|E

50|$|<b>Thiobacillus</b> caldus was {{reclassified}} into Acidithiobacillus, one {{of three}} new genera (also including Halothiobacillus and Thermithiobacillus) created to further classify members of the genus which fall into the alpha-, beta-, and gamma-classes of the Proteobacteria. <b>Thiobacillus</b> species exhibit {{a tremendous amount of}} diversity in physiology and DNA composition, which was one reason for reclassification of this species into a new genus containing four species of acidophiles (microorganisms which function best in an acidic environment), some of which are also capable of oxidizing ironII and sulfide minerals.|$|E
50|$|Bio{{machining}} is {{the machining}} process of using lithotropic bacteria to remove material from metal parts, contrasted with chemical machining {{methods such as}} chemical milling and physical machining methods such as milling. Certain bacteria, such as <b>Thiobacillus</b> ferrooxidans and <b>Thiobacillus</b> thiooxidans, which are also used in the mineral refinement process of bioleaching, utilize the chemical energy from oxidation of iron or copper to fix carbon dioxide from the air. A metal object, when placed in a culture fluid containing these metal-metabolizing bacteria, will have material removed from its surface over time.|$|E
50|$|All {{species are}} obligate autotrophs (using the transaldolase {{form of the}} Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle) using {{elementary}} sulfur, thiosulfate or polythionates as energy sources - the former <b>Thiobacillus</b> aquaesulis can grow weakly on complex media as a heterotroph but has been reclassified to Annwoodia aquaesulis. Some strains (E6 and Tk-m) of the type species <b>Thiobacillus</b> thioparus can use the sulfur from dimethylsulfide, dimethyldisulfide or carbon disulfide to support autotrophic growth - they oxidise the carbon from these species into carbon dioxide and assimilate it. Sulfur oxidation is achieved via the Kelly-Trudinger pathway.|$|E
5000|$|Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans (basonym <b>Thiobacillus</b> ferrooxidans) can be {{isolated}} from iron-sulfur minerals such as pyrite deposits, oxidising iron and sulfur as energy sources to support autotrophic growth and producing ferric iron and sulfuric acid.|$|E
5000|$|Acidithiobacillus is a genus of the Acidithiobacillia in the [...] "Proteobacteria". Like all [...] "Proteobacteria", Acidithiobacillus spp. are Gram-negative. Some {{members of}} this genus were {{classified}} as <b>Thiobacillus</b> spp., before they were reclassified in 2000.|$|E
5000|$|Bioleaching {{can involve}} {{numerous}} ferrous iron and sulfur oxidizing bacteria, including Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans (formerly known as <b>Thiobacillus</b> ferrooxidans) and Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans [...] (formerly known as <b>Thiobacillus</b> thiooxidans). As a general principle, Fe3+ ions {{are used to}} oxidize the ore. This step is entirely independent of microbes. The role of the bacteria is the further oxidation of the ore, but also the regeneration of the chemical oxidant Fe3+ from Fe2+. For example, bacteria catalyse {{the breakdown of the}} mineral pyrite (FeS2) by oxidising the sulfur and metal (in this case ferrous iron, (Fe2+)) using oxygen. This yields soluble products that can be further purified and refined to yield the desired metal.|$|E
50|$|The Acidithiobacillales are {{an order}} of {{bacteria}} within the class Acidithiobacillia and comprises the genera Acidithiobacillus and Thermithiobacillus. Originally, both {{were included in the}} genus <b>Thiobacillus,</b> but they are not related to the type species, which belongs to the Betaproteobacteria.|$|E
50|$|Some notable mesophiles include Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. Other {{examples}} of species of mesophiles are Clostridium kluyveri, Pseudomonas maltophilia, <b>Thiobacillus</b> novellus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Different types of diseases and infections typically have pathogens from mesophilic bacteria {{such as the}} ones listed above.|$|E
50|$|Thermithiobacillus is a genus of non-sporeforming, rod-shaped, Gram-negative proteobacteria. The name {{derives from}} the Latin thermae, for warm baths, and the Greek θείος, theios for sulfur.

5000|$|<b>Thiobacillus</b> is a genus of Gram-negative Betaproteobacteria. Thiobacilus thioparus is {{the type}} species of the genus. Whilst over 30 [...] "species" [...] have been named in this genus, most were never validly or {{effectively}} published. The remainder were either reclassified into Annwoodia, Thiomonas, Paracoccus, Starkeya, Sulfuriferula, Halothiobacillus, Thermithiobacillus or Acidithiobacillus, or were lost from culture.|$|E
5000|$|The {{oxidation}} {{of metal}} sulfide (by oxygen) is slow without colonization by acidophiles, particularly Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans (synonym <b>Thiobacillus</b> ferrooxidans).

50|$|The {{process is}} {{performed}} primarily by heterotrophic bacteria (such as Paracoccus denitrificans and various pseudomonads), although autotrophic denitrifiers {{have also been}} identified (e.g., <b>Thiobacillus</b> denitrificans). Denitrifiers are represented in all main phylogenetic groups. Generally several species of bacteria {{are involved in the}} complete reduction of nitrate to N2, and more than one enzymatic pathway has been identified in the reduction process.|$|E
50|$|Rusticyanin is a copper-containing protein {{which is}} {{involved}} in electron-transfer, being a strong oxidant. It is a cupredoxin, or blue-copper protein due to its colour, and can be extracted from the bacteria <b>Thiobacillus</b> ferrooxidans. Similarly to other proteins of the same class, like plastocyanin, it contains a core β-sandwich fold and the binding site is a distorted tetrahedron consisting of four residues, two histidines, one cysteine and one methionine.|$|E
50|$|In {{molecular}} biology the Bacterial Microcompartment (BMC) domain is a protein domain {{found in a}} variety of shell proteins, including CsoS1A, CsoS1B and CsoS1C of <b>Thiobacillus</b> neapolitanus (Halothiobacillus neapolitanus) and their orthologs from other bacteria. These shell proteins form the polyhedral structure of the carboxysome and related structures that plays a metabolic role in bacteria. The BMC domain consists of about 90 amino acid residues, characterized by β-α-β motif connected by a β-hairpin.|$|E

50|$|Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans, {{formerly}} known as <b>Thiobacillus</b> thiooxidans until its reclassification into the newly designated genus Acidithiobacillus of the gamma subclass of Proteobacteria, is a Gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium that uses sulfur as its primary energy source. It is mesophilic, with a temperature optimum of 28 °C. This bacterium is commonly found in soil, sewer pipes, and cave biofilms called snottites. A. thiooxidans {{is used in the}} mining technique known as bioleaching, where metals are extracted from their ores through the action of microbes.|$|E
50|$|Ores most {{amenable}} to leaching include the copper carbonates malachite and azurite, the oxide tenorite, and the silicate chrysocolla. Other copper minerals, {{such as the}} oxide cuprite and the sulfide chalcocite may require addition of oxidizing agents such as ferric sulfate and oxygen to the leachate before the minerals are dissolved. The ores with the highest sulfide contents, such as bornite and chalcopyrite will require more oxidants and will dissolve more slowly. Sometimes oxidation is speeded by the bacteria <b>Thiobacillus</b> ferrooxidans, which feeds on sulfide compounds.|$|E
50|$|Plastocyanin/azurin {{family of}} copper-binding {{proteins}} (or blue (type 1) copper domain) {{is a family}} of small proteins that bind a single copper atom and that are characterised by an intense electronic absorption band near 600 nm (see copper proteins). The most well-known members of this class of proteins are the plant chloroplastic plastocyanins, which exchange electrons with cytochrome c6, and the distantly related bacterial azurins, which exchange electrons with cytochrome c551. This family of proteins also includes amicyanin from bacteria such as Methylobacterium extorquens or Paracoccus versutus (<b>Thiobacillus</b> versutus) that can grow on methylamine; auracyanins A and B from Chloroflexus aurantiacus; blue copper protein from Alcaligenes faecalis; cupredoxin (CPC) from Cucumis sativus (Cucumber) peelings; cusacyanin (basic blue protein; plantacyanin, CBP) from cucumber; halocyanin from Natronomonas pharaonis (Natronobacterium pharaonis), a membrane-associated copper-binding protein; pseudoazurin from Pseudomonas; rusticyanin from <b>Thiobacillus</b> ferrooxidans; stellacyanin from Rhus vernicifera (Japanese lacquer tree); umecyanin from the roots of Armoracia rusticana (Horseradish); and allergen Ra3 from ragweed. This pollen protein has evolutary relation to the above proteins, but seems to have {{lost the ability to}} bind copper. Although there is an appreciable amount of divergence in the sequences of all these proteins, the copper ligand sites are conserved.|$|E
50|$|Polyhedral {{bodies were}} {{discovered}} by {{transmission electron microscopy}} in the cyanobacterium Phormidium uncinatum in 1956. These were later observed in other cyanobacteria and in some chemotrophic bacteria that fixed carbon dioxide—many of them are sulfur reducers or nitrogen fixers (for example, Halothiobacillus, Acidithiobacillus, Nitrobacter and Nitrococcus). The polyhedral bodies were first purified from <b>Thiobacillus</b> neapolitanus (now Halothiobacillus neapolitanus) in 1973 and shown to contain RuBisCO, held within a rigid outer covering. The authors proposed that since these appeared to be organelles involved in carbon fixation, they should be called carboxysomes.|$|E
