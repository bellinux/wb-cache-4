5|$|At <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> life, Beebe was {{forming a}} close {{friendship}} with then-president Theodore Roosevelt, which would last until Roosevelt's death in 1919. Beebe admired Roosevelt's skill {{as a field}} naturalist {{as well as his}} advocacy of conservation, and Roosevelt's fame made his support highly valuable in Beebe's scientific endeavors. Roosevelt in turn admired Beebe's writing and his respect for the natural world. Roosevelt frequently provided praise for Beebe's books, and went on to write introductions to Beebe's books Tropical Wild Life and Jungle Peace.|$|E
5|$|In about 1064, having {{witnessed}} {{much of his}} formerly expansive sea-kingdom {{fall into}} the hands of the Uí Cheinnselaig, Echmarcach accompanied Donnchada man who was himself deposedupon a pilgrimage to Rome. Possibly aged about sixty-five at <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> life, it was here that Echmarcach died, in either 1064 or 1065. In the decades following his demise, the Uí Briain used Echmarcach's descendants as a means to dominate and control Dublin and the Isles. One of his grandsons eventually ruled as king.|$|E
5|$|This {{discretion}} and ambiguity {{is likely}} due to SEGA's desire to maintain Sonic's free and youthful nature, believing that committing to a relationship at <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> life would simply be uncharacteristic of him. In addition, given that chasing Sonic and the ensuing antics are fundamental parts of Amy's character, their relation seems unlikely to change any time soon.|$|E

60|$|We {{will not}} do Reuben Dale the {{injustice}} to lift the curtain at <b>this</b> critical <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> history. Suffice {{it to say that}} he went into that coppice pale and came out red--so red that his handsome sunburned countenance seemed on the point of catching fire. There was a pleased expression on it, however, which was eminently suggestive.|$|R
5|$|After {{retiring}} from football Young had many different jobs, including removals, managing a sports shop, delivering milk, {{working in a}} supermarket, and selling insurance. In his spare time he maintained his fitness by playing badminton, and after winning local tournaments, played the sport for Cheshire. During much of this period he struggled financially, {{to the point where}} he had to sell the family home and move in with his mother. Deeply depressed at <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> life, at one point he attempted suicide. From the mid-1990s Young coached school football teams in the area around his Cheshire home.|$|E
5|$|Hughes {{spent four}} years at West Bromwich Albion as a schoolboy from ages 11 to 15, though was not offered a youth team contract. He instead started his career playing semi-professionally for Football Conference club Kidderminster Harriers, whilst holding down a {{part-time}} job as a roofer. Although Hughes scored 34 goals in the 1996–97 season, Kidderminster failed to gain promotion to the Football League after finishing five points behind champions Macclesfield Town. At <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> career Hughes was {{regarded as one of}} England's finest semi-professionals and was called up to the England national football C team. In total, Hughes scored 70 goals in 139 games for Kidderminster in all competitions.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of Echmarcach's short reign in Dublin other than an attack on Skryne and Duleek, {{recorded}} by the seventeenth-century Annals of the Four Masters in 1037. This strike could have been undertaken {{in the context of}} the Dubliner's gradual loss of power in Brega, and an attempt to regain authority of Skryne. Although there is no direct evidence that Echmarcach controlled Mann at <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> career, Sitriuc does not appear to have taken refuge on the island after his expulsion from Dublin. This seems to suggest that the island was outwith Sitriuc's possession, and may indicate that Mann had fallen into the hands of Echmarcach sometime before. In fact, it is possible that Echmarcach may have used the island to launch his takeover of Dublin.|$|E
50|$|Murchadh {{is one of}} the {{earliest}} attested kings of his region. He is noteworthy as the person who gave his name to the Muintir Murchada, a dynasty whose leading family later took the surname Ó Flaithbertaigh (O'Flaherty). At <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> time, <b>his</b> people lived east of Lough Corrib, their territory centered on Lough Cime (Lough Hackett), Tuam, County Galway. They would be expelled by the O'Connors in the 1050s.|$|R
5000|$|Bill Heidrick {{gives his}} own {{interpretation}} on the adverse tree, {{saying that the}} spellings are “mostly reconstructions with alternatives. Nonetheless, {{it is believed that}} the majority of the above are at least suitable if not perfect”. He also goes on to say that “These names are sometimes called the 'adverse Sephiroth' instead of the Demonic Orders. A. E. Waite makes <b>this</b> later <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> Holy Kabbalah, page 256.” ...|$|R

5|$|Over {{the next}} two seasons Johnson {{featured}} intermittently in the first team. He scored five goals in 12 appearances for the first team in 1920–21, playing more regularly for the reserves, for whom he was the leading goalscorer with 18 goals. He became a regular first team selection in 1922–23, playing 35 matches. In 1923 Manchester City moved from Hyde Road to a new stadium, Maine Road, in the Moss Side area of the city. Johnson scored in the first match at the new stadium, against Sheffield United. While Johnson was a regular goalscorer at <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> career, he did not score as frequently as teammates Frank Roberts and Horace Barnes. Firmly established in the first team, he missed only one match in the 1924–25 season.|$|E
5|$|By <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> life Beebe was {{developing}} a close {{friendship with the}} American romance novelist Elswyth Thane, who had met Beebe in 1925. Very little of their early correspondence survives, but Elswyth had idolized Beebe for years, and her first novel Riders of the Wind was devoted to him. The novel was an account {{of a young woman}} who falls in love with, and eventually marries, a much older adventurer who strongly resembled Beebe. Beebe and Elswyth were married on September 22, 1927, when Beebe was 50. Due to Elswyth's tendency to misrepresent her age, conflicting accounts exist of how old she was when she and Beebe were married, ranging from 23 to 28. Elswyth and Beebe had an open marriage, in which neither expected sexual exclusivity from the other so long as their life together was not damaged.|$|E
5|$|Thome {{grew up in}} Peoria, Illinois, {{as part of a}} large blue-collar {{family of}} athletes, who {{predominantly}} played baseball and basketball. After attending Illinois Central College, he was drafted by the Indians in 1989 and made his major league debut in 1991. Early in his career, he played third base before eventually becoming a first baseman. With the Indians, Thome was part of a core of players that led the franchise to two World Series appearances in three years during the mid-1990s. He spent over a decade with Cleveland before leaving via free agency after the 2002 season to join the Philadelphia Phillies, with whom he spent the following three seasons. Traded to the Chicago White Sox before the 2006 season, Thome won the American League Comeback Player of the Year Award that year and reached the 500 home run club during his three-season tenure with the team. By <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> career, back pain limited Thome to being a designated hitter. After stints with the Los Angeles Dodgers and Minnesota Twins, he made brief returns to Cleveland and Philadelphia before ending his career with the Baltimore Orioles. Upon retiring, Thome accepted an executive position with the White Sox.|$|E
5000|$|Dundes {{is often}} {{credited}} with the promotion of folkloristics as a term denoting a specific field of academic study and applies instead {{what he calls a}} “modern” flexible social definition for folk: two or more persons who have any trait in common and express their shared identity through traditions.

60|$|Fortunately at <b>this</b> <b>point</b> Alric, <b>in</b> <b>his</b> retreat {{among the}} bushes, also blushed scarlet, for it only then flashed upon {{him that he}} had been acting the mean part of an eavesdropper, and had been {{listening}} to converse which he should not have heard. Instead, therefore, of carrying out his original intention, he scrambled into the path with as much noise as possible, and coughed, as he came awkwardly forward.|$|R

5|$|Young {{missed the}} start of the 1965–66 season with an illness that {{resulted}} in a tonsillectomy. He marked his return to the team with two goals against Coventry City. Up until <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> career, Young had usually played on the left wing. However, encouraged by Mercer and Allison to shoot more frequently, his position began to vary. Against Leyton Orient, Young was deployed as an inside forward, and scored a hat-trick. He also played inside-forward in an FA Cup tie against Leicester City, and scored the winning goal against a team from the division above. By January, Manchester City were top of the Second Division. The club only lost one match in the remainder of the season, and won the Second Division Championship by a five-point margin. Young finished as the club's highest goalscorer, with 17 goals.|$|E
25|$|It {{was also}} at <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> career {{that he began to}} attract {{attention}} from senior officers and members of the Intelligence Community, both for his ability to think strategically and conceptually, and for his ideas about force structure, concepts, and doctrine, that normally did not interest fighter pilots.|$|E
25|$|When Edsel Ford, President of Ford Motor Company, died {{of cancer}} in May 1943, the elderly and ailing Henry Ford decided to assume the presidency.

25|$|Dr. Huige Li, a {{spokesperson}} {{with the medical}} advocacy group Doctors Against Forced Organ Harvesting, reiterated <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> 2015 testimony before European Parliament.

25|$|In Turkey, {{he became}} {{interested}} in numerology and Sufism (including secret mystical exercises still practised by Sufis of the Bektashi order). Speculations say he might have converted to Sufi Islam, although the evidence (from his own semi-autobiographical writings) is rather tenuous on <b>this</b> <b>point.</b> <b>In</b> <b>his</b> autobiographical novel Der Talisman des Rosenkreuzers (The Rosicrucian Talisman), Sebottendorff distinguishes between Sufi-influenced Turkish Masonry and conventional Masonry.|$|E
25|$|Allaire had {{up until}} <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> career {{been able to}} borrow to meet cash shortfalls, but with the {{recession}} affecting demand for his products, he was obliged to look elsewhere for working capital. In 1842, he sold shares in the Allaire Iron Works, which was incorporated for the sum of $300,000. Shipping magnate Cornelius Vanderbilt and Allaire's brother-in-law John Haggerty were thus able to eventually gain a controlling interest in the company.|$|E
5000|$|Immediately, {{he started}} meditating on the [...] "Mu" [...] gong-an (Japanese: koan) and started {{ignoring}} all his responsibilities at home. Deciding that his parents' house {{had too many}} distractions, he promptly packed his bags and went to Daewonsa (Daewon temple). After obtaining permission {{to stay in the}} temple, the young Seongcheol started to meditate intensively. Later in life, he would say that he attained the state of Dongjeong Ilyeo (see Teachings below, Hangul: 동정일여, Hanja: 動靜一如) at <b>this</b> early <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> life <b>in</b> only forty-two days.|$|R
