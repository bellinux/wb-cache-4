5|$|Heydrich was {{assigned}} to help organise the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin. The games were used to promote the propaganda aims of the Nazi regime.

For his part in the games' success, Heydrich was awarded the Deutsches Olympiaehrenzeichen or German Olympic Games Decoration (First Class).|$|E
50|$|A Welcome <b>to</b> <b>Country</b> {{is where}} an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander {{custodian}} or elder {{from the local}} region welcomes people to their land. This may be done through speech, song, dance or ceremony. Some report that the Welcome <b>to</b> <b>Country</b> {{has been a part}} of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander protocol for thousands of years. Others, including Ernie Dingo, say the Welcome <b>to</b> <b>Country</b> is a more recent convention. Ernie Dingo claims his Welcome <b>to</b> <b>Country</b> in 1976 was the first modern-day Welcome <b>to</b> <b>Country.</b> Whatever the origin of the tradition, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander protocols or customs in relation <b>to</b> Welcome <b>to</b> <b>Country</b> are diverse and will vary from region to region.|$|R

5|$|The {{tightening}} {{of laws and}} increased enforcement by police {{on behalf of the}} British Phonographic Industry (BPI), Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and other industry groups—often for peripheral issues such as tax evasion—gradually drove the distributors of for-profit vinyl and CD bootlegs further underground.

5|$|Addressing the mercantilist {{belief that}} {{monetary}} intervention {{could cause a}} perpetually favourable balance of trade, Cantillon developed a specie-flow mechanism foreshadowing future international monetary equilibrium theories. He suggested that in countries with a high quantity of money in circulation, prices will increase and therefore become less competitive in relation <b>to</b> <b>countries</b> {{where there is a}} relative scarcity of money. Thus, Cantillon also held that increases in the supply of money, regardless of the source, cause increases in the price level and therefore reduce the competitiveness of a particular nation's industry in relation to a nation with lower prices. However, Cantillon did not believe that international markets tended toward equilibrium, and instead suggested that government hoard specie to avoid rising prices and falling competitiveness. Furthermore, he suggested that a favourable balance of trade can be maintained by offering a better product and retaining qualitative competitiveness. Cantillon's preference towards a favourable balance of trade possibly stemmed from the mercantilist belief in exchange being a zero-sum game, in which one party gains at the expense of another.|$|E

5|$|Betances {{believed}} in the abolition of slavery, inspired not only on written works by Victor Schoelcher, John Brown, Lamartine and Tapia, but also on personal experience, {{based on what he}} saw at his father's farm and in daily Puerto Rican life. Based on his beliefs, he founded a civic organization in 1856, one of many others that were later called the Secret Abolitionist Societies by historians. Little is known about them due to their clandestine nature, but Betances and Salvador Brau (a close friend who later became the official Historian of Puerto Rico) describe them in their writings. Some of these societies sought the freedom and free passage of maroons from Puerto Rico <b>to</b> <b>countries</b> where slavery had been abolished already; other societies sought to liberate as many slaves as possible by buying out their freedom.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reaction}} to the series was mixed. While some reviewers praised the programme for being worthy of its publicity by focusing on history rather than spirituality, others remarked that it was dumbed down and went off on strange tangents. The reliability of the facial reconstruction was also questioned. Son of God first aired in the UK on BBC One during April 2001, where it received a viewership of sixmillion and an audience share of 25%. In the United States, the series was shown on the Discovery Channel under the name Jesus: The Complete Story as a single three-hour programme, two weeks after its UK broadcast. The show was also licensed <b>to</b> <b>countries</b> including France, Denmark and New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|Early World Cups {{were given}} <b>to</b> <b>countries</b> at {{meetings}} of FIFA's congress. The locations were controversial because South America and Europe were {{by far the}} two centres of strength in football and travel between them required three weeks by boat. The decision to hold the first World Cup in Uruguay, for example, led to only four European nations competing. The next two World Cups were both held in Europe. The decision to hold the second of these in France was disputed, as the South American countries understood that the location would alternate between the two continents. Both Argentina and Uruguay thus boycotted the 1938 FIFA World Cup.|$|E

5|$|Following Stalin's {{death in}} March 1953, Kosygin was demoted, {{but as a}} staunch ally of Khrushchev, his career soon turned around. While never one of Khrushchev's protégés, Kosygin quickly moved up the party ladder. Kosygin became an {{official}} of the State Planning Committee in 1957, and was made a candidate member of the Politburo. He was promoted to the State Planning Committee chairmanship, and became Khrushchev's First Deputy Premier in 1960. As First Deputy Premier Kosygin travelled abroad, mostly on trade missions, <b>to</b> <b>countries</b> such as North Korea, India, Argentina and Italy, for instance. Later, {{in the aftermath of the}} Cuban Missile Crisis, Kosygin was the Soviet spokesman for improved relations between the Soviet Union and the United States. Kosygin regained his old seat in the Politburo at the 22nd Party Congress in 1961.|$|E
5|$|Many Western Catholics and non-Catholics have voiced {{disagreement}} on the Church's support for natural family planning, and contend {{it contributes to}} overpopulation and poverty.

In its defense, Catholics cite countries such as Kenya and Uganda, where behavioral changes are encouraged instead of condom use, and where greater progress in controlling the disease has been made than in countries that promote condom use alone.|$|E
5|$|Megadeth is {{considered}} one of the most musically influential groups that originated in the 1980s. As part of the early American thrash metal movement, the band's music was a direct influence on death metal. Sociologist Keith Kahn-Harris wrote that the mainstream success of Megadeth was one of the reasons for the expansion of extreme metal <b>to</b> <b>countries</b> where it had previously been unknown. The band's sound and album artwork influenced a number of thrash metal bands in the 21st century, including Toxic Holocaust and Warbringer. According to Nielsen SoundScan, Megadeth has sold 9.2 million copies of its albums in the United States between 1991 and 2014.|$|E
