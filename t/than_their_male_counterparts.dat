5|$|Robert Frank, a {{professor}} of child development at Oakton Community College in Illinois, conducted a study comparing households with a stay-at-home dad and households with a stay-at-home mom. His study concluded that women were still able to form a strong bond with their children despite working full-time outside the home. Also, women working full-time were often more engaged with their children {{on a day-to-day basis}} <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>male</b> <b>counterparts.</b> His study concluded that in a family with a stay-at-home dad arrangement, the maternal and paternal influences are equally strong. This contrasts with the more traditional family structure where the father works outside the home and the mother stays home with the children. In this type of arrangement, the mother's influence is extremely strong, whereas the father's is relatively small. The study found that both parents play an equal role in a child's development, but the stay-at-home dad arrangement is the most beneficial for the child.|$|E

40|$|A {{research}} {{on the influence of}} justice on work-related outcomes confirms that employees who experience ‘distributive injustice’ are more likely to develop burnout over time, whereas ‘procedural injustice’ leads to lower job satisfaction. The study was carried out over three years comprising more than 1, 500 employees. In addition, the study found that female employees experienced higher levels of distributive justice <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>male</b> <b>counterpart...</b>|$|R
30|$|Also, {{significant}} differences on {{awareness of the}} changes relating to temperature were observed across respondents’ gender (χ 2  =  8.380, df =  2, P =  0.015), with males being more aware of declining temperature than females while the females were more aware of rising temperature <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>males</b> <b>counterparts.</b> In addition, {{significant differences}} on awareness of the changes relating to temperatures were also observed across the households’ main livelihood (χ 2  =  12.631, df =  10, P =  0.002) with crop farmers being more aware of temperature changes compared to the respondents pursuing other livelihood types.|$|R
30|$|The result {{indicates}} that female-headed households {{are less likely}} to adopt inorganic fertilizer <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>male</b> <b>counterpart.</b> This result is in line with the work of Doss and Morris (2000). The result also {{indicates that}} literacy level of the household head is positively and significantly related to the adoption of inorganic fertilizer and crop diversification. Besides, the education level of spouse’s also has a positive contribution to the adoption of crop diversification. Maize farming experience is significant in determining adoption of crop diversification. This is plausible, as farmers with higher experience appear to have a wide knowledge and experiences on the operation and methods of agricultural production; they can easily evaluate the advantage of crop diversification.|$|R
25|$|According to an {{analysis}} of Census Bureau data released by Reach Advisors in 2008, single childless women between ages 22 and 30 were earning more <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>male</b> <b>counterparts</b> in most United States cities, with incomes that were 8% greater than males on average. This shift is driven by the growing ranks of women who attend colleges and move on to high-earning jobs.|$|E
25|$|This data {{somewhat}} {{undermines the}} traditional economic {{explanation of the}} concentration of female labor in agriculture. Regardless of the underlying reason for high female participation in agriculture, these workers earn a lower wage <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>male</b> <b>counterparts</b> both within this sector and relative to workers in other sectors. This {{may be one reason}} for the wide wage gap in some majority Muslim countries.|$|E
25|$|The Kenexa Research Institute {{released}} a global survey of almost 30,000 workers {{which showed that}} females suffered more workplace distress <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>male</b> <b>counterparts.</b> According to the survey, women's stress level were 10% higher for those in supervisory positions, 8% higher stress in service and production jobs than men, and 6% higher in middle and upper management than men in the same position.|$|E

40|$|The {{paper was}} to {{investigate}} gender variation in reading habits in schools in Moland: using Asantekwaa S. D. A. Junior High School in the Kintampo Municipality of Ghana as a case study. Questionnaires were used to collect data from one hundred and forty four (144) students who were randomly selected for the study. The findings of the study disclosed that females have higher positive attitudes towards reading <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>males</b> <b>counterparts.</b> The study recommended that teachers should draw programmes that will attract and encourage students to engage in effective reading habits. The school management and parents association should harness resources {{to set up a}} library in the school since a library is part of a school system which serves as a store house of knowledge...|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. September 2009. Major: Psychology. Advisor: Professor Jo-Ida C. Hansen. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xiv, 206 pages, appendices A-D. This study investigated race/ethnic and sex comparisons among 182 Hmong American and 198 Caucasian American {{college students in}} regards to specific career development variables. Hmong American college students reported more perceived educational and career barriers and fewer resources (e. g., career decision-making self-efficacy, family support) than did Caucasian American college students. Caucasian American female college students reported more perceived educational and career barriers and less career decision-making self-efficacy <b>than</b> did <b>their</b> <b>male</b> <b>counterparts.</b> Contrary to expectations, Hmong American female college students reported more role model support <b>than</b> did <b>their</b> <b>male</b> <b>counterparts.</b> These results suggest that relations among career variables are likely to vary by sex and race/ethnic group membership, which supports the need to investigate these relations among different minority groups...|$|R
25|$|The dual-sphere {{nature of}} women’s work, in {{household}} domestic labor, {{and in the}} marketplace, allowed for both additional opportunities at financial resources {{as well as a}} larger social circle <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>male</b> <b>counterparts.</b> This gave women greater resources both as slaves and as ex-slaves, though their mobility was hindered by gender constraints. However, women often fared better in manumission possibilities. Among Brazilian-born adult ex-slaves in Salvador in the 18th century, 60% were women.|$|E
25|$|Education in Burkina Faso {{is divided}} into primary, {{secondary}} and higher education. High school costs approximately CFA25,000 ($50 USD) per year, which is far above the means of most Burkinabè families. Boys receive preference in schooling; as such, girls' education and literacy rates are far lower <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>male</b> <b>counterparts.</b> An increase in girls' schooling has been observed because of the government's policy of making school cheaper for girls and granting them more scholarships.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the career}} gains women have made, their husbands have not reached parity {{in terms of}} their {{domestic}} work and care work. Women in the developed world, including the U.S., still do hours more of housework <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>male</b> <b>counterparts,</b> despite their success in the workplace. Working mothers on average do more work and sleep less than their husbands. The perception of who does more housework is also skewed by whether or not the husband or the wife is reporting.|$|E
40|$|AbstractEthics in {{engineering}} {{is not a}} new issue; however it has become an increasing concern in Malaysia. Studies investigating the ethical awareness of future engineers in Malaysia are scarce. For this reason, this study attempts to determine the level of ethical awareness of engineering students. A total of 451 final year engineering students from two cohorts in Malaysian public universities have participated in this study. An inventory of multiple context ethical situations is used to assess ethical awareness. Findings show that, in general, students show a good level of ethical awareness. These students appear to have higher level of ethical awareness when compared to accounting students. Between gender, female engineering students seem to have higher ethical awareness <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>male</b> <b>counterpart.</b> Among recommendations is to expose the students to be aware of some workplace and business-related ethical issues...|$|R
40|$|In {{this text}} we analyze the {{situation}} of statisticians vis-à-vis other university degree holders with respect to some characteristics in the labor market, using indicators such as salary, formal labor market links, economic sector of employment, position in the occupation and spatial distribution among the Brazilian states. Female statisticians seem to fare better <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>male</b> <b>counterpart</b> {{when compared to other}} graduates with respect to salaries. The gender gap is smaller for statisticians than for all graduates considered together. But in general when considering the insertion in the labor market, Brazilian statisticians of both sexes fare better than other university graduates: the proportion of Statisticians in informal jobs is proportionally smaller. On the other hand, the proportion of statisticians holding positions that do not require a university degree is slightly higher than that of all graduates...|$|R
25|$|Racial {{endogamy}} {{is significantly}} stronger among recent immigrants. This result holds for all racial groups, with the strongest endogamy found among immigrants of African descent. Interestingly, {{the gender differences}} in interracial marriage change significantly when the non-white partner is an immigrant. For instance, female immigrants of African descent {{are more likely to}} marry U.S.-born Caucasians <b>than</b> are <b>their</b> <b>male</b> <b>counterparts.</b>|$|R
25|$|Infants have fully {{developed}} their locomotive abilities within {{three to four}} months. When an infant is seven months old, its mother discourages suckling; full weaning happens by its 18th month. In some populations, male infants tend to play in larger groups more often than females. However, female infants have more social interaction <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>male</b> <b>counterparts.</b> Males prefer to associate with other males around the same age, when they are two years old. Female infants will associate with individuals {{of all ages and}} sexes.|$|E
25|$|Women {{in lower}} wage jobs {{are more likely}} to be subject to wage discrimination. They {{are more likely to}} bring home far less <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>male</b> <b>counterparts</b> with equal job status, and get far less help with {{housework}} from their husbands than the high-earning women. Women with low educational attainment entering the workforce in mass quantity lowered earnings for some men, as the women brought about a lot more job competition. The lowered relative earnings of the men and increase in birth control made marriage prospects harder for lower income women.|$|E
25|$|According to Andrew Beveridge, a Professor of Sociology at Queens College, between 2000 and 2005, {{young women}} in their twenties earned more <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>male</b> <b>counterparts</b> in some large urban centers, {{including}} Dallas (120%), New York (117%), Chicago, Boston, and Minneapolis. A major {{reason for this is}} that women have been graduating from college in larger numbers than men, and that many of those women seem to be gravitating toward major urban areas. In 2005, 53% of women in their 20s working in New York were college graduates, compared with only 38% of men of that age. Nationwide, the wages of that group of women averaged 89% of the average full-time pay for men between 2000 and 2005.|$|E

40|$|This study investigated: (i) the {{modality}} used {{to assign}} jobs to Work-Study students, (ii) nature of jobs assigned to Work-Study students, (iii) the age difference of Work-Study students, (iv) gender difference of Work-Study students, (v) if a significant relationship exists between the academic level of Work-Study students and job performance. In collecting its data, questionnaire was administered to 91 respondents. Percentage was used to analyse the responses {{obtained in respect of}} the research questions. Moreover, the study employed ANOVA and T-test to test the hypothesis formulated for the study. The result of the investigation revealed that a significant relationship exists between the academic level of Work-Study students and job performance @ 1 percent level of significance. Moreover, the result indicated that each student programme of study was used as a modality for assigning jobs to students. Furthermore, it equally revealed that female students participated more in the programme <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>male</b> <b>counterpart...</b>|$|R
25|$|Women {{artists have}} also been at the {{forefront}} of the hip hop movement since its inception in the Bronx. Nevertheless, as gangsta rap became the dominant force in hip hop music, there were many songs with misogynistic (anti-women) lyrics and many music videos depicted women in a sexualized fashion. The negation of female voice and perspective is an issue that has come to define mainstream hip hop music. The recording industry is less willing to back female artists <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>male</b> <b>counterparts,</b> and when it does back them, often it places emphasis on their sexuality over their musical substance and artistic abilities. Since the turn of the century (the beginning of the 2000s decade), female hip hop artists have struggled to get mainstream attention, with only a few, such as older artists like the female duo Salt N' Pepa to more contemporary ones like Lil' Kim and Nicki Minaj, reaching platinum status.|$|E
25|$|Prices {{reflected}} {{the characteristics of}} the slave—such factors as sex, age, nature, and height were all taken into account to determine the price of a slave. Over the life-cycle, the price of enslaved women was higher <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>male</b> <b>counterparts</b> up to puberty age, as they would likely bear children and produce more slaves, in addition to serving as laborers. Men around the age of 25 were the most valued, as they were at the highest level of productivity and still had a considerable life-span. If slaves had a history of fights or escapes, their price was lowered reflecting what planters believed was risk of repeating such behavior. Slave traders and buyers would examine a slave's back for whipping scars—a large number of injuries would be seen as evidence of laziness or rebelliousness, rather than the previous master's brutality, and would lower the slave's price Taller male slaves were priced at a higher level, as height was viewed as a proxy for fitness and productivity.|$|E
25|$|The Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale, {{sometimes}} shortened to the CMAS, {{was created}} in 1956. This scale was closely modeled after the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale. It was developed so that the TMAS {{could be applied to}} a broader range of people, specifically children. Kitano tested the validity of the CMAS by comparing students who were placed in special education classes versus those placed in regular classrooms. Kitano proposed the idea that children who were in special education classes {{were more likely to have}} higher anxiety than those in regular classrooms. Using the CMAS, Kitano found boys tested in the special education classes had higher anxiety scores than their regular classroom counterparts. Hafner tested the reliability of the CMAS with the knowledge that the TMAS had a feminine bias. Hafner found that the CMAS did not have a female bias. He only found two questions that females always scored higher on <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>male</b> <b>counterparts.</b> As the test stands now, the suggestion is to compare the female and male participants separately. Castaneda found significant differences across different grade levels, indicating that as students develop they are affected differentially by various stressors.|$|E
40|$|The Supreme Court {{recently}} {{ruled that}} no jury could be chosen {{on the basis}} of sex. This study was conducted to determine whether jury biases exist in the sentencing of murder cases. It was therefore hypothesized that women would judge female murderers more severely <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>male</b> <b>counterpart.</b> The severity of sentences were determined by the participants 2 ̆ 7 marks on a severity of sentence scale. These participants evaluated both domestic and mutilation murder cases, each of which varied in the gender of the accused. Using a 2 X 2 ANOVA in the evaluation of the results, {{no significant differences were found}} between the participants 2 ̆ 7 ratings of the two genders, yet, in support of previous results, females were found to rate mutilation murders significantly more severe. These results could be used during jury selection to minimize jury bias by excluding biased individuals from the jury, thus protecting the right to a fair trial...|$|R
50|$|Girls {{are more}} likely to be {{enrolled}} later and removed from primary school earlier <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>male</b> student <b>counterparts.</b> Primary schools have a male graduation rate of about 16%, while girls' graduation rates lag behind at 9%. For the reasons discussed above, girls are at a clear disadvantage in education. Completing secondary school has been found to deter early marriage and provide opportunity for girls by producing skilled workers.|$|R

25|$|The {{red deer}} is the fourth-largest deer species behind moose, elk and sambar deer. It is a ruminant, eating its food in two stages and having an even number of toes on each hoof, like camels, goats and cattle. European red deer have a {{relatively}} long tail compared to their Asian and North American relatives. Subtle differences in appearance are noted between the various subspecies of red deer, primarily in size and antlers, with the smallest being the Corsican red deer found on the islands of Corsica and Sardinia and the largest being the Caspian red deer (or maral) of Asia Minor and the Caucasus Region {{to the west of}} the Caspian Sea. The deer of Central and Western Europe vary greatly in size, with some of the largest deer found in the Carpathian Mountains in Central Europe. Western European red deer, historically, grew to large size given ample food supply (including people's crops), and descendants of introduced populations living in New Zealand and Argentina have grown quite large in both body and antler size. Large red deer stags, like the Caspian red deer or those of the Carpathian Mountains, may rival the wapiti in size. Female red deer are much smaller <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>male</b> <b>counterparts.</b>|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} widely known work {{associated}} with Marie de Romieu, her Brief discourse on the superiority of woman over man, {{was a response to}} an anti-feminist text penned by her brother, Jacques. Some critics attribute Jacques as the actual author of the Discourse, but this theory has been mostly rejected due to stylistic differences. Featured as the first piece in Premières Oeuvres, de Romieu’s discourse on the superiority of women builds itself by praising the courage, wit and virtue of women. It argues that women were visibly more beautiful <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>male</b> <b>counterparts</b> because they were a refined product from man, who had been made with clay. In her discourse, de Romieu asserts that women were superior to men in their sacrifices and charity work. She condemns men who fault women for their failings and for leading them astray, claiming they are responsible for their own actions. She also accuses men of trying to deliberately deceive women with ‘fine words’ and goes into great detail elaborating the different types of deception perpetrated by men: those who cite God's will and authority, those who pose as protectors of female virtue, or those who pretend to 'serve' women. Furthermore, she illustrates women as the source of learning, both in ancient times and her own. In her conclusion, she reasons that life without women would be lacking in social graces and virtues; she also points out that it is not by accident that the classical virtues are depicted as women.|$|E
25|$|As {{decreases}} in job security and wages for males have negatively impacted {{the ability of}} the sole male-breadwinner family model, there is now increasing pressure for women to work outside the home in a dual-earner family model. The percentage of young women who believed that a man should work outside a home and that women should work inside dropped from 41.6% in 1997 to 27.8% in 2008, while for men the rate went from 40.7% to 34.3% respectively. Similarly, the proportion of young women who expected to work until retirement rose from 15.3% in 1987 to 24.7% in 2010, while the proportion of men who expected their wives to do so rose from 10.5% to 32.7% in the same time period. The increasing acceptance of young Japanese adults of the dual-earner model has resulted in an increase of dual-earner young households from 32.4% in 2000 to 42.8% in 2009. Women are also delaying or avoiding marriage altogether. The mean age of first marriage rose from 24.2 in 1970 to 28.8 in 2010, while the proportion of women aged 25–29 who have not married increased from 18.1% in 1970 to 60.3% in 2010. The education levels of young women are also drastically increasing, at a rate higher <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>male</b> <b>counterparts.</b> 45.2% of women in 2010 progressed to university from high school, a dramatic increase from 15.2% in 1990. These changes in Japanese society have narrowed the wage gap between men and women, as wages of female 25–29 years old have reached 88% of their male counterparts in 2007, as opposed to 76% in 1981. However, a large part of this reduction in the wage gap is due to the stagnation of male wages, which was at the same levels in 2007 as in 1991.|$|E
