5|$|A {{temple was}} {{constructed}} in AD60–70, and a bathing complex was built up over the next 300years. Engineers drove oak piles into the mud to provide a stable foundation, and surrounded <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> with an irregular stone chamber lined with lead. In the 2nd century, <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> was enclosed within a wooden barrel-vaulted structure that housed the caldarium (hot bath), tepidarium (warm bath), and frigidarium (cold bath).|$|E

5|$|Before <b>the</b> <b>Spring</b> Offensive on the Western Front began, the War Office {{had decided}} to {{substitute}} British units in the EEF with British Indian Army units.

5|$|By 1782, the Johnsons {{had moved}} to Bryan's Station (future Lexington) in Fayette County. Johnson's mother was {{considered}} among the heroic women of the community because of her actions during Simon Girty's raid on Bryan's Station in August 1782. According to tradition, as Girty's forces surrounded the fort, the occupants discovered that they had almost no water inside to withstand a siege. Several Indians had concealed themselves near <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> outside the fort. The Kentuckians reasoned that the Indians would stay hidden until they attacked. Jemima Johnson approved {{a plan for the}} women to go alone and collect water from <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> as usual. Many men disapproved of the plan, fearing the women would be attacked and killed. However, faced with no other option they finally agreed. Shortly after sunrise, the women went to <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> and returned without incident.|$|E

5000|$|Another reason {{cited for}} {{the decline of the}} Sans Souci was the failing of <b>the</b> mineral <b>springs.</b> <b>The</b> <b>springs</b> were prone to block and stop flowing, and tapping into the waters was an {{expensive}} endeavor. Furthermore, Low sought to create a monopoly on <b>the</b> <b>springs.</b> Consequently, he arranged and subdivided his land so that <b>the</b> <b>springs</b> were only accessed by private homesteads; this is in contrast to <b>the</b> <b>springs</b> in Saratoga Springs which were frequently located in the middle of roadways and in parks, where they were free for the public to use and enjoy. The private nature of <b>the</b> <b>springs</b> in Ballston Spa was a deterrent to vacationers looking for the health benefits of the water.|$|R
50|$|The station {{contains}} <b>the</b> Paralana Hot <b>Springs,</b> which {{issue from}} rich veins of uranium ore. Carbon dioxide, nitrogen, radon and helium bubble forth continuously.

5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> of 1863, Levski {{returned}} to Bulgarian lands {{after a brief}} stay in Romania. His uncle Basil reported him as a rebel to the Ottoman authorities, and Levski was imprisoned in Plovdiv for three months, but released due to {{the help of the}} doctor R. Petrov and the Russian vice-consul Nayden Gerov. On Easter 1864, Levski officially relinquished his religious office. From May 1864 until March 1866, he worked as a teacher in Voynyagovo near Karlovo; while there, he supported and gave shelter to persecuted Bulgarians and organised patriotic groups among the population. His activity caused suspicion among the Ottoman authorities, and he was forced to move.

50|$|About 1875, John Fletcher Crabtree (1824-1915), {{and sons}} found <b>the</b> hot <b>springs</b> by {{following}} a well used Indian trail.

Some people even took sick horses there and swore by the results. No water was commercially bottled here, but <b>the</b> <b>springs</b> was commercialized as a resort.|$|R
5|$|The American {{goldfinch}} {{undergoes a}} molt in <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> and autumn. It {{is the only}} cardueline finch to undergo a molt twice a year. During the winter molt it sheds all its feathers; in <b>the</b> <b>spring,</b> it sheds all but the wing and tail feathers, which are dark brown in the female and black in the male. The markings on these feathers remain through each molt, with bars on the wings and white under and {{at the edges of}} the short, notched tail. The sexual dimorphism displayed in plumage coloration is especially pronounced after <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> molt, when the bright color of the male's summer plumage is needed to attract a mate.|$|E

50|$|After the war, most of {{the resort}} village known as Greenwell Springs, as well as <b>the</b> Greenwell <b>Springs</b> Hotel, was torn down. The lumber from these {{buildings}} was used to help rebuild structures in Baton Rouge that had been damaged or destroyed during the war. In 1910, a new Greenwell Springs Hotel {{was built on the}} site of the old hotel. A new springhouse was built at the same time as the new hotel. A short time after construction was completed, <b>the</b> <b>springs</b> stopped flowing. <b>The</b> loss of <b>the</b> <b>springs</b> was believed to be because the mouths of <b>the</b> <b>springs</b> were opened too wide which resulted in a loss of water pressure. With the absence of <b>the</b> <b>springs,</b> <b>the</b> new hotel soon lost appeal and was closed down. In 1920, <b>the</b> Greenwell <b>Springs</b> Hotel burned down. The State of Louisiana later bought the property to use as a tuberculosis hospital and eventually as a mental hospital known as Greenwell Springs Hospital. It was during this time that <b>the</b> <b>springs</b> began to flow again.|$|R
50|$|Today, Springs is {{well known}} for its architecture: it has the second largest {{collection}} of small scale Art Deco buildings in the world, after Miami in Florida, in the United States. These Art Deco buildings were constructed during the period between the two World Wars. Other landmarks include several monuments to important figures in the city's development, like Paul Kruger, and the war cemetery where many Coloured soldiers are buried who died during the Second World War fighting in the Allied Forces. There is also the War Monument at the northern entrance of <b>the</b> <b>Springs</b> CBD, <b>The</b> Old <b>Springs</b> Fire Station, and the Dutch Windmill in <b>the</b> Pioneer Park, <b>Springs.</b> There is a small scale replica of the Voortrekker Monument in <b>the</b> <b>Springs</b> CBD near <b>the</b> library. <b>Springs</b> has an art gallery next to <b>the</b> <b>Springs</b> Library.
