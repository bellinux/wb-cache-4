This method simplifies the graphs of the <b>thrust</b> <b>horsepower</b> required at altitudes, and is particularly useful in comparing the performance of planes of different sizes, wing loadings, and propelling plant characteristics, which have the same lift and drag coefficients.|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} made of the {{performance}} of a jet-propulsion system composed of an engine-driven blower, a combustion chamber, and a discharge nozzle. A simplified analysis is made of this system for the purpose of showing in concise form the effect of the important design variables and operating conditions on jet thrust, <b>thrust</b> <b>horsepower,</b> and fuel consumption. Curves are presented that permit a rapid evaluation of the performance of this system for a range of operating conditions. The performance for an illustrative case of a power plant of the type under consideration id discussed in detail. It is shown that for a given airplane velocity the jet <b>thrust</b> <b>horsepower</b> depends mainly on the blower power and the amount of fuel burned in the jet; the higher the <b>thrust</b> <b>horsepower</b> is for a given blower power, the higher the fuel consumption per <b>thrust</b> <b>horsepower.</b> Within limits the amount of air pumped has only a secondary effect on the <b>thrust</b> <b>horsepower</b> and efficiency. A lower limit on air flow for a given fuel flow occurs where the combustion-chamber temperature becomes excessive {{on the basis of the}} strength of the structure. As the air-flow rate is increased, an upper limit is reached where, for a given blower power, fuel-flow rate, and combustion-chamber size, further increase in air flow causes a decrease in power and efficiency. This decrease in power is caused by excessive velocity through the combustion chamber, attended by an excessive pressure drop caused by momentum changes occurring during combustion...|$|E
40|$|A {{single-engine}} light airplane {{was modified}} by {{the installation of}} a wing with reduced area, Fowler flaps, Kruger flaps, and spoilers. Flight test results show that zero-lift drag was reduced 13. 8 % and a trimmed maximum lift coefficient of 2. 73 was achieved. Gust response was significantly reduced and excellent roll control was achieved with spoilers. Several design features employed in the new wings have excellent potential for in-corporation in future light airplanes.

50|$|To {{test the}} story - {{the very first}} myth they tackled - Jamie Hyneman and Adam Savage, with help from honorary MythBuster Erik Gates, {{procured}} a 1966 Chevrolet Impala, and after {{they were unable to}} obtain actual JATOs, they substituted three model rockets in succession to produce an equivalent amount of <b>thrust</b> (3000 <b>horsepower</b> for 15 seconds). They also installed a rocket rack and reinforced the car so that the rockets would not tear off the roof, and even made use of a hydraulic system that the previous owner had installed on the car to lower {{the front of the car}} and make it more aerodynamic. However, when tested in the Mojave Desert, the car did not go anywhere near the 300 mi/h km/h reported in the original story, and failed to become airborne.|$|R

40|$|As {{part of an}} {{investigation}} af the application of nuclear energy to various types of power plants for aircraft, calculations {{have been made to}} determine the effect of several operating conditions on the performance of condensers for mercury-turbine power plants. The analysis covered 8 range of turbine-outlet pressures from 1 to 200 pounds per square inch absolute, turbine-inlet pressures from 300 to 700 pounds per square inch absolute,and a range of condenser cooling-air pressure drops, airplane flight speeds, and altitudes. The maximum load-carrying capacity (available for the nuclear reactor, working fluid, and cargo) of a mercury-turbine powered aircraft would be about half the gross weight of the airplane at a flight speed of 509 miles per hour and an altitude of 30, 000 feet. This maximum is obtained with specific condenser frontal areas of 0. 0063 square foot per net <b>thrust</b> <b>horsepower</b> with the condenser in a nacelle and 0. 0060 square foot per net <b>thrust</b> <b>horsepower</b> with the condenser submerged in the wings (no external condenser drag) for a turbine-inlet pressure of 500 pounds per square inch absolute, a turbine-outlet pressure of 10 pounds per square inch absolute, and 8 turbine-inlet temperature of 1600 F...|$|E
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{presents the}} results of tests made on a radial engine to determine the thrust that can be obtained from the exhaust gas when discharged from separate stacks and when discharged from the collector ring with various discharge nozzles. The engine was provided with a propeller to absorb the power and was mounted on a test stand equipped with scales for measuring the thrust and engine torque. The results indicate that at full open throttle at sea level, for the engine tested, a gain in <b>thrust</b> <b>horsepower</b> of 18 percent using separate stacks, and 9. 5 percent using a collector ring and discharge nozzle, can be expected at an air speed of 550 miles per hour...|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} general formulas for {{the determination}} of all major airplane performance characteristics. A rigorous analysis is used, making no assumption regarding {{the attitude of the}} airplane at which maximum rate of climb occurs, but finding the attitude at which the excess <b>thrust</b> <b>horsepower</b> is maximum. Equations and charts are developed which show the variation of performance due to a change in any of the customary design parameters. Performance determination by use of the formulas and charts is rapid and explicit. The results obtained by this performance method have been found to give agreement with flight tests that is, in general, equal or superior to results obtained by present commonly used methods...|$|E
40|$|A wave rotor is {{a device}} that can boost the {{pressure}} and temperature of an airflow. When used {{as part of the}} core of a gas turbine engine, a wave rotor can significantly improve the <b>thrust</b> or shaft <b>horsepower</b> by boosting the flow pressure without raising the turbine inlet temperature. The NASA Lewis Research Center's Aeropropulsion Analysis Office, which is identifying technologies and research opportunities that will enhance the technical and economic competitiveness of the U. S. aeronautics industry, is evaluating the wave rotor to quantify the potential benefits of this device. Preliminary studies such as these are critical to identifying technologies that have high payoffs...|$|R
40|$|LecturePg. 133 - 140 The {{advantage}} of operating a thrust bearing in an evacuated cavity {{has been well}} documented in the literature. By draining the oil {{from the bottom of the}} housing and eliminating standing oil around the <b>thrust</b> collar, <b>horsepower</b> reductions of up to 50 percent can be realized. The decision to operate in an evacuated cavity is the first step in designing a low loss bearing. The recent trend in the industry has been to further reduce thrust losses by lowering the quantity of oil supplied to the bearing. This study investigates the impact of the oil injection method on thrust bearing performance when operating in an evacuated housing under low oil supply conditions. Several bearings were tested with identical geometry under duplicate operating conditions with the method of oil injection varied in each test to isolate its influence on performance. Tests were done to determine the starved film flow at various speeds for each lubrication method. Based on the results of the starved flow test, the bearings were evaluated at full flow, incipient starvation, and fully starved conditions. The performance of the bearings tested was nearly identical around a sliding velocity of 12, 300 ft/min. At sliding velocities above and below this speed, there was a load at which the temperature of the nozzle, pocket, and groove bearing was identical. The coolest configuration to the left of the crossover tended to be the hottest to the right of this point...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of an aircraft in various measured icing conditions was investigated. Icing parameters such as liquid water content, temperature, cloud droplet sizes and distributions were measured continuously while in icing. Flight data {{were reduced to}} provide plots of the aircraft drag polars and lift curves (CL vs. alpha) for the measured ""iced'' condition as referenced to the uniced aircraft. These data were also reduced to provide plots of <b>thrust</b> <b>horsepower</b> required vs. single engine power available to show how icing affects engine out capability. It is found that performance degradation is primarily influenced by the amount {{and shape of the}} accumulated ice. Glaze icing caused the greatest aerodynamic performance penalties in terms of increased drag and reduction in lift while aerodynamic penalties due to rime icing were significantly lower...|$|E
40|$|A {{technique}} was developed which permits simultaneous extraction of complete lift, drag, and thrust power curves from time histories {{of a single}} aircraft maneuver such as a pull up (from V max to V stall) and pushover (to V max for level flight). The technique, which {{is an extension of}} nonlinear equations of motion of the parameter identification methods of Iliff and Taylor and includes provisions for internal data compatibility improvement as well, was shown to be capable of correcting random errors in the most sensitive data channel and yielding highly accurate results. Flow charts, listings, sample inputs and outputs for the relevant routines are provided as appendices. This {{technique was}} applied to flight data taken on the ATLIT aircraft. Lack of adequate knowledge of the correct full throttle <b>thrust</b> <b>horsepower</b> true airspeed variation and considerable internal data inconsistency made it impossible to apply the trajectory matching features of the technique...|$|E
40|$|Computations {{are made}} of the {{performance}} of a propeller designed to develop 56 <b>thrust</b> <b>horsepower</b> at 100 miles per hour. The fuel consumption of the jet-operated propeller would be considerably higher than that of a reciprocating engine and a propeller. The lighter weight of the jet-operated propeller will result in a lighter weight of engine plus fuel for short-range flights. A theoretical analysis is made of a propeller powered by gas jets issuing from the blade tips. In the propeller considered, the air is drawn through the hub and passes through the hollow propeller blades to the tips, where propellers heat the air and expel it through the nozzles in the blade tips. The reaction of the tips rotates the propeller. For long range flights, the weight of the jet-operated propeller with its fuel would be greater than the weight of a reciprocating engine with its propeller and fuel...|$|E
40|$|Equations {{and charts}} are {{presented}} for computing the thrust, the power output, the fuel consumption, and other performance parameters of a turbine-propeller engine {{for any given}} set of. operating conditions and component efficiencies. Included are {{the effects of the}} pressure losses in the inlet duct and the combustion chamber, the variation of the physical properties of the gas as it passes through the system, and the change in mass flov of the gas by the addition of fuel. In order to illustrate some of the turbine-propeller system per-formance characteristics, the total <b>thrust</b> <b>horsepower</b> per unit mass rate of air- flow and the specific fuel consumption are presented for a. wide range of flight and engine-design operating conditions and a given set of design component efficiencies. The performance of a turbine-propeller engine containing a matched set of components is presented for a range of engine operating conditions. The influence of the characteristics of the individual components on off-design-point performance is shown. The flexibility of operation of two turbine-propeller engines is discussed ^ one engine has a divided turbine system in which the first turbine drives only the compressor and the second turbine independently drives the propeller, and the other engine has a connected turbine system which drives both the compressor and the propeller...|$|E
40|$|Engine and {{airplane}} {{performance data}} have been gathered {{from various sources}} and analyzed to determine indications of the most economical methods of flight operation from a consideration of fuel expenditure. The analysis includes the influence of such facts as fuel-air ratio, engine speed, engine knock, altitude, cylinder cooling, spark timing, and limits of cruising brake mean effective pressure. The {{results indicate that the}} cheapest power is obtained with approximately correct mixture at low engine speed and highest permissible manifold pressure. If more power is desired, the methods of obtaining it are, in order of fuel economy: (a) increasing the engine speed and maintaining safe cylinder temperatures by cooling; (b) retarding the spark or cooling further to permit higher manifold pressure; and, (c) riching the mixture. The analysis further shows that the maximum time endurance of flight occurs at the air speed corresponding to minimum <b>thrust</b> <b>horsepower</b> required and with minimum practicable engine speed. Maximum mileage per pound of fuel is obtained at slightly higher air speed. The fuel-air ratio should be approximately the theoretically correct ratio in both cases. For an engine equipped with a geared supercharger, as in the example presented, and with knock as the limiting condition, a comparison of operation at sea level and at 6, 000 feet shoes flight at altitude to be more economical on the basis of both range and endurance...|$|E
