Both {{before and after}} Calment's death, {{there have been several}} claims to have surpassed her age (see Unverified longevity claims), but none of <b>these</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> proven and Calment therefore continues to hold the record for the oldest verified person ever.|$|E
5|$|Although {{meteorological}} surveys alert about hurricanes {{or severe}} storms, {{in the areas}} where the risk of coastal flooding is particularly high, there are specific storm surge warnings. <b>These</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> implemented, for instance, in the Netherlands, Spain, the United States, and the United Kingdom.|$|E

5|$|Although {{reluctant}} {{to comment on}} the issue, Hareide was likely single during his first tenure in national politics. He has been confronted with rumours of homosexuality by segments of the media, but <b>these</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> dismissed. In 2008 he was reported as having a relationship with Solveig Engevik from Kolbotn, which ended in 2010.

5|$|At {{the bottom}} of the hill beside the battery are two {{rectangular}} earthworks, 16 metres by 8 metres (52ft and 26ft), and 26 metres and 12 metres (85ft and 39ft). Traditionally <b>these</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> thought to be Royalist gun batteries pre-dating the construction of Oliver's Battery, but recent scholarship casts doubt on this, suggesting that they are instead the remains of hollow ways and sand pits.|$|E

This made Autolink Ofotbanen's largest customer, and second largest owner. In March, Autolink ordered additional 70new autoracks for NOK175 million.|$|E

5|$|Bolzano and Willi were great-great grandsons of Folie, {{while the}} rest were great-great-great grandsons. Especially {{in the early years}} of the breed's history, some {{inbreeding}} occurred, both by accident and design, which served to reinforce the breed's dominant characteristics. During the 1980s and 1990s, several studies were conducted to examine morphological differences among the breed lines. Significant differences were found in some characteristics, including height and proportions; <b>these</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> used to help achieve breeding objectives, especially in Italy during the 1990s.|$|E

5|$|Much of Shen Kuo's written {{work was}} {{probably}} purged {{under the leadership}} of minister Cai Jing (1046â€“1126), who revived the New Policies of Wang Anshi, although he set out on a campaign of attrition to destroy or radically alter the written work of his predecessors and especially Conservative enemies.
