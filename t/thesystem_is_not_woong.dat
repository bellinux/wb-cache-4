40|$|Model-based {{techniques}} for verification and validation require {{a model of}} the systemunder test (SUT). However, most communication systems lack a complete, correctmodel. One approach for generating a model of a system is to infer the model byobserving its external behavior. This approach is useful when the source code of <b>thesystem</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> available, e. g., third party components. Regular inference techniques areable to infer a finite state machine model of a system by observing its externalbehavior. In this master thesis we consider the models inferred by regular inferencetechniques of a certain kind of systems: communication protocol entities. Suchentities interact by sending and receiving messages consisting of a message type and anumber of parameters, each of which potentially can take on a large number of values. This may cause a model of a communication protocol entity inferred by regularinference, to be very large. Since regular inference creates a model from the observedbehavior of a communication protocol entity, the model may be very different from adesigner's model of the system's source code. This master thesis presents a novel approach to transform the inferred model ofcommunication protocols to a new formalism in a sense that it is more compact andit has a similar partitioning of an entity's behavior into control states as in a designer'smodel of the protocol.

In fact, for awide class of compartmental systems of R 3, it is possible to prove that, when we apply thatcontrol law to the real system, the total mass of the system converges to a positive constantvalue, which depends on the parameter uncertainties and that can be made arbitrarily closeto the desired mass, provided that the uncertainties in the parameter values are sufficientlysmall.

The correctness of <b>thesystem</b> <b>is</b> only guaranteed if at all times the threshold is higher than the actual number of faults, yet a conservativelychosen (high) threshold wastes expensive replication in the common situation where the number of faults averages wellbelow the worst case.

Using such protocols, a system can operate in an efficient low-threshold mode with relatively small quorums in the absence of faults, increasing and decreasing the quorum size(and thus the tolerance) as faults appear and are dealt with, respectively. ...|$|R
