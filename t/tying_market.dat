40|$|Tying {{arrangements}} often increase welfare {{by promoting}} product quality {{and protecting the}} supplier 2 ̆ 7 s goodwill in the tying product. When the tying product works effectively only with ancillary materials or accessories or services of a particular kind or quality, its supplier can assure the requisite quality of the ancillary product only by supplying that product itself. The cost savings defense and the defenses of quality control or good will are the most widely recognized and accepted tying defenses. One characteristic of manufactured products is differentiation among the offerings of various brands. This in turn produces {{a need for more}} specialized provision of such things as supplies, aftermarket parts, and service, thus requiring firms to dedicate their production or distribution to particular product designs. As a consequence firms must also dedicate their production and organization to ongoing relationships with a narrow range of other firms. Franchising is an one example, but there are others. What virtually all of these situations {{have in common is that}} they occur in markets that involve differentiated, typically branded products and fairly specialized aftermarket products or services. Or alternatively, a manufacturer of a complex or delicate machine may require users to have the machine serviced by the manufacturer 2 ̆ 7 s own employees or agents. A tie might be used in such cases by a firm with no power in the <b>tying</b> <b>market</b> and with no purpose or effect of gaining power in the tied market or even of exploiting customers. This paper considers transaction cost rationales for tying in the context of the types of asset specificity that are common in modern relational contracts, looking particularly at protection of goodwill, manufacturer-supplied specifications or standards as an alternative to tying, and the use of tying to protect a supplier’s trade secrets. Problematically, many of the litigated ties have involved foreclosure of only a minuscule portion of the tied market. Requiring a significant foreclosure before finding prima facie illegality would often obviate the many vexing questions concerning either cost savings or quality control. Asset specificity is ubiquitous, and serves to explain ties in many competitive markets, including franchising, office equipment, and medical services to name a few. A non-foreclosing tie ordinarily has no anticompetitive effects. Under a rule of reason treatment no justification would be required for legality, but even under harsher treatment provable quality protection should defend the tie...|$|E

Börzel, Freie Universität Berlin Prof. Jacint Jordana, Universitat Pompeu FabraThis thesis {{seeks to}} explain cross-sectoral {{variation}} in convergence with EU rules in countries outside the EU that lack regulatory capacities and democratic development. In contrast to accounts predominant in the Europeanization literature, this study presents {{evidence to suggest}} that regulatory change in non-accession countries is not doomed to failure despite high initial adaptation costs that cannot be mitigated by EU membership conditionality. Making use of qualitative research methods, I analyze variation in convergence with EU rules in Ukraine across four policy sectors (corporate governance, technical regulation, telecommunications and food safety). I find that cross-sectoral variation is a function of different patterns of transnationalization that can be deep, shallow or mixed, depending on the properties and combined effects of interactions between domestic and external actors. In policy sectors where the combined effects of strong economic conditionality, strong market incentives for European and local firms and multiplex capacity building increase the incentives and capacities of domestic public and private actors for regulatory change, convergence with EU rules is likely to reach high levels thanks to deep patterns of transnationalization. My findings have the following implications. 1) Instead of high-powered political incentives (membership conditionality), the EU has down-to-earth economic incentives at its disposal (economic conditionality) to shape regulatory change in non-accession countries. <b>Tying</b> <b>market</b> access to convergence with EU rules in an unambiguous manner is necessary to achieve high levels of convergence beyond the EU’s borders. 2) Analyzing the combined effects of conditionality, markets and capacity building is more fruitful for explaining cross-sectoral variation in convergence with EU rules than isolated analyses of each mechanism. 3) Convergence with EU rules is not just about creating another level of hierarchy in the markets and political systems of target countries. Rather, it is about creating institutions for governance arrangements in which public and private actors coordinate regulatory tasks. Hence, transnational interactions need to increase the incentives and capacities of public and private domestic actors for high levels of convergence. 4) In countries like Ukraine, Russia is not a countervailing hegemon that unfailingly seeks to obstruct convergence with EU rules. Rather, Russia should be conceived of as an adapative hegemon that promotes or obstructs convergence depending on the interests of Russian business...|$|E

40|$|Tied {{sales have}} a long history of {{scrutiny}} under the antitrust laws of the United States. The primary basis for the condemnation of this practice has been the court's belief in what has come to be known as the "leverage theory" of tying: that is, that tying provides a mechanism whereby a firm with monopoly power in one market can use the leverage provided by this power to foreclose sales in, and thereby monopolize, a second market. In recent years, however, the leverage theory has come under heavy attack. In this paper, I reconsider the leverage hypothesis. I argue that, in an important sense, the models used by the critics of the leverage theory which all assume that the <b>tied</b> good <b>market</b> has a competitive, constant returns-to-scale structure- are incapable of addressing the central concern of the leverage theory, that tying can be profitably used to change the market structure of the <b>tied</b> good <b>market.</b> I then demonstrate that when the <b>tied</b> good <b>market</b> has an oligopolistic structure, tying can indeed serve as a mechanism for leveraging market power through the foreclosure of <b>tied</b> <b>market</b> rivals sales. The mechanism through which this foreclosure occurs, its profitability for the monopolist, and its welfare implications are discussed in detail. ...|$|R

40|$|Many tying {{arrangements}} {{are used by}} firms {{that do not have}} substantial market power in either of the two markets linked together by the tie. Their function must be something other than the enlargement or perpetuation of power. A few ties do involve fairly explicit exercises of market power, but they need not be used for a different purpose than the ties imposed by more competitive firms. This paper considers firms’ use of ties to exploit whatever power they already have over the tying product. The 2 ̆ 2 leverage 2 ̆ 2 theory sees ties as exploiting customers as a group via higher prices, whether or not the tie excludes any rival. By contrast, the foreclosure theory of ties is concerned with exclusion of rivals, mainly in the <b>tied</b> product <b>market,</b> with extension or perpetuation of monopoly as a long term goal. The dominant explanation for variable proportion ties is price discrimination, although it explains some fixed proportion ties as well. Like leveraging, price discrimination results in some customer exploitation. However, while some customers are injured, most price discrimination ties benefit an even larger number of customers and by a greater amount. As a result they are beneficial under both general welfare and consumer welfare antitrust tests. Also like leveraging, a tying firm can profit from price discrimination without foreclosing any rival. Indeed, even firms with small amounts of <b>tying</b> product <b>market</b> power can use price discrimination ties. Although a price-discriminating tie might cover most purchasers of a tied product and thus foreclose a substantial share of the <b>tied</b> <b>market,</b> effective price discrimination neither requires nor typically generates a significant foreclosure or other impairment of the <b>tied</b> <b>market</b> 2 ̆ 7 s structure or performance. Indeed, in many litigated cases the tying product was a common commodity such as dry ice, salt, or ordinary printing ink. The least warrant for antitrust intervention occurs when higher tied product prices fail to result from foreclosure of rivals and are not reflected in customer prices that are not higher overall. For example, most ties of complementary products (1) fail to foreclose any rival from anything because the tied product is a common ingredient or other common expendable input; and also (2) fail to result in higher consumer prices for the tying/tied combination because the firm is in competition with other firms and could not assess a monopoly price increase. The last conclusion is true even though a price discrimination tie typically results in higher prices for the tied product alone. Finally, an even stronger case for lower prices results in situations where the tied product is a manufactured good sold at prices above cost. In those cases tying can eliminate double marginalization, thus benefiting both consumers and the tying seller...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} how political ties maintained by a firm with rival political parties affect the firm’s entry into new industries.

Moreover, the impact of portfolios of political <b>ties</b> on <b>market</b> entry is contingent on the internal resources of politically connected firms.

40|$|The {{competition}} {{policy in the}} EU should guarantee that the competition is not distorted {{in the way that}} would prevent or create difficulties for the free mobility of goods and services between Member states. It is prohibited for companies to abuse their dominant position according to Article 82, if it affects trade. The essence of Article 82 is control of market power. The perfect competition results when supply and demand appoint the price and quantity of a product. Firms are encouraged to compete then it results in efficiency, quality products and lower prices. Dominance can be assessed only in relation to three essential variables: the product market, the geographical market and the temporal factor. The determination of the relevant product market is crucial. The general approach of the Commission and the Court to the definition of the product market has been to focus upon interchangeability, {{the extent to which the}} product is interchangeable with other products. From the demand side interchangeability requires investigation of cross-elasticities of the product. The existence of high cross-elasticities indicates that the products are part of the same market. There are different types of abuse, for example price discrimination, refusal to supply and predatory pricing. In Tetra Pak the ECJ held that the company that was a world leader in the manufacture of aseptic cartons for liquid and semi-liquid food had abused its dominant position on the market for aseptic cartons. Tetra Pak asserted that only their products could be used in production when using their machines. Their behaviour, according to ECJ, was abusive then they tried to tie-in consumers and customers. This way of behaviour could also be seen in the Hilti-case concerning nail guns. Tying occurs when the supplier makes the sale of one product (the tying product) conditional upon the purchase of another distinct product (the tied product) from the supplier or someone designated by the latter. Tying is common practice that often has no anticompetitive consequences. The foreclosure of the <b>tied</b> <b>market</b> may allow the dominant company to achieve larger profits in the <b>tied</b> <b>market.</b> We can see the importance of case-law, when the definition of Article 82 is broad. For example have the United Brands-case and Akzo-case determined the presumption for market share and dominant position.

40|$|The thesis {{analyses}} the EC {{competition and}} US antitrust approaches to tying with special reference to economic thinking and intellectual property rights. It establishes that {{from an economic}} perspective that tying cannot be considered purely anticompetitive. Only when certain conditions are present is this the case: market power, an imperfect <b>tied</b> product <b>market,</b> which includes insufficient competition, high barriers to entry, and competitors' inability {{to compete with the}} dominant company's tied product package. Even in these circumstances, tying may have pro-competitive effects, which can outweigh the anti-competitive effects. While in the EC, competition law has completely overtaken the dealings with tying, in the US the Patent Act has adopted a per se legality approach only condemning tying when the intellectual property owner holds market power and applies the tying alTangement together with the patent to extend his patent monopoly to staple products. In comparison, competition law {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic see tying as (almost) illegal per se - almost because both jurisdictions require establishment of market power. A similar four-step test has. been applied in both the EC and the US: 1) market power in the <b>tying</b> product <b>market</b> 2) two separate products 3) anti-competitive effects on the <b>tied</b> product <b>market</b> 4) no objective justifications By assessing these steps in detail, the thesis identifies that when dealing with more complex products, technologically integrated products and products protected by intellectual property rights, the four-step test is inadequate and will often result in a wrong conclusion. The thesis therefore proposes a new test, which takes into consideration economic thinking, the recent reform debate of Article 82 of the EC Treaty, which has proposed a more economic approach to exclusionary behaviour and the fact that intellectual property rights do not always confer market power and also attempts to create greater legal certainty to ensure that despite having market power a company can tie when the pro-competitive benefits outweigh the anti-competitive effects.
