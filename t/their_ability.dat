5|$|Around 120,000 {{species of}} fungi have been {{described}} by taxonomists, but the global biodiversity of the fungus kingdom is not fully understood. A 2017 estimate suggests there may be between 2.2 and 3.8 million species. In mycology, species have historically been distinguished {{by a variety of}} methods and concepts. Classification based on morphological characteristics, such as {{the size and shape of}} spores or fruiting structures, has traditionally dominated fungal taxonomy. Species may also be distinguished by their biochemical and physiological characteristics, such as <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> to metabolize certain biochemicals, or their reaction to chemical tests. The biological species concept discriminates species based on <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> to mate. The application of molecular tools, such as DNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis, to study diversity has greatly enhanced the resolution and added robustness to estimates of genetic diversity within various taxonomic groups.|$|E
5|$|Atomic line {{filters are}} most often used in LIDAR and other {{exercises}} in laser tracking and detection, for <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> to filter daylight and effectively discern weak, narrowband signals; however, they {{may be used for}} filtering out the earth's thermal background, measuring the efficiencies of antibiotics and general filtering applications.|$|E

However, when these individuals lack confidence in <b>their</b> <b>abilities,</b> they will avoid, procrastinate, or possibly cheat in challenging situations that might make them appear incompetent.

They suggested that tyrannosaurids transmitted the infection by biting each other, and that the infection impaired <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> to eat food.|$|E
5|$|Limousins {{have become}} popular {{because of their}} low birth weights (ease of calving), higher than average {{dressing}} percentage (ratio of carcase to live weight) and yield (ratio of meat to carcase), high feed conversion efficiency, and <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> to produce lean, tender meat. A major multi-breed study reported that Limousins converted feed into saleable meat more efficiently and significantly faster than popular British breeds, and marginally faster than other popular continental European cattle breeds. Conversely, the other cattle breeds produced proportionally more low-cost by-product and waste, which resulted in their live weight growth being faster than Limousins. Limousins are especially favoured for crossbreeding with cattle such as Angus, Hereford and Shorthorn because of <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> to contribute hybrid vigour, and improve the yield and feed conversion efficiency of these British breeds, which produce higher levels of fat and marbled meat.|$|E
5|$|Many {{bees are}} aposematically coloured, {{typically}} orange and black, warning of <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> {{to defend themselves}} with a powerful sting.

5|$|Studies {{related to}} {{vocabulary}} development show that children's language competence depends upon <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> to hear sounds during infancy. Infants' perception of speech is distinct. Between six and ten months of age, infants can discriminate sounds {{used in the}} languages of the world. By 10 to 12 months, infants can no longer discriminate between speech sounds that are not used in the language(s) {{to which they are}} exposed. Among six-month-old infants, seen articulations (i.e. the mouth movements they observe others make while talking) actually enhance <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> to discriminate sounds, and may also contribute to infants' ability to learn phonemic boundaries. Infants' phonological register is completed between the ages of 18 months and 7 years.|$|E
