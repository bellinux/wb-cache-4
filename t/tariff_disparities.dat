5000|$|The Kennedy Round officially {{opened on}} May 4, 1964, at the Palais des Nations. It {{was the last}} GATT round to have tariff {{reduction}} as its primary focus. However, {{it was the first}} GATT round to deal with non-tariff issues, such as dumping, a practice whereby a company exports a product at a price lower than the price it charges in its home market. It notably also pioneered a [...] "linear" [...] style of negotiations. In contrast to the item-by-item negotiations of previous GATT rounds, many countries offered across-the-board cuts of a certain percentage on all tariffs of participating countries. Members of the so-called [...] "Bridge Club"—the United States, European Economic Community, Japan, and the UK—led the negotiations and offered linear cuts. Six other European countries joined them in linear cuts. Another 36 countries were nonlinear participators, a difference which led to tension within the negotiations, as linear countries often felt nonlinear countries had no right to participate in the [...] "confrontation and justice" [...] procedure for dealing with proposed exceptions. Thus, although the Kennedy Administration had originally contemplated finishing the round in six months, the round was plagued with delays and slow progress. In addition to the linear and nonlinear divides, disputes arose over agricultural policy and <b>tariff</b> <b>disparities.</b> The United States wanted Europe to agree to cut farm tariffs before moving on to industrial tariffs, but gridlock forced the United States to relent. Only low expectations stopped the concluding agricultural agreements from being considered a disaster. Further, equivalent percentage cuts to high U.S. tariffs (18% on average) and medium EEC tariffs (12% on average [...] ) were seen to favor the United States. Since President Lyndon Johnson had little chance of success in reauthorizing the Trade Expansion Act, its July 1, 1967 deadline served as the effective deadline for the Kennedy round. After a marathon session, negotiators announced a satisfactory agreement at a midnight meeting with the press on May 15, 1967. The final agreement was signed on June 30, 1967. However, within the United States, Congress repealed several provisions of the round of global tariff cuts, hurting the future credibility of the United States in worldwide trade negotiations.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{develops}} a ldquoDiffusion Model of an Induced Environmental Consumer Marketrdquo {{in an attempt}} to link the willingness to pay literature with the established innovation diffusion literature. This concern arises from an attempt to reconcile the large disparities that have been observed between actual adoption of green energy tariffs and willingness to pay for such <b>tariffs.</b> These <b>disparities</b> have often been attributed to upward response bias and the free rider problem. However, empirical research indicates that other factors have hindered the development of green energy markets, including supply side problems and poor regulation. In sum, by linking willingness to pay to the concept of innovation diffusion and actual observed adoption levels, the model provides a framework with which to conceptualise the various factors (upward response bias, the free rider problem and market imperfections) that can explain differences between actual take-up and willingness to pay. These distinctions should help policymakers make more accurate assessments of the role that green energy markets can play in the funding of new renewable investments over time...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} a formal model that links {{the willingness to}} pay (WTP) literature with the established innovation diffusion literature. This concern arises from an attempt to reconcile the large disparities that have been observed between actual adoption of green energy tariffs and WTP for such <b>tariffs.</b> These <b>disparities</b> have often been attributed to upward response bias and the free rider problem. However, empirical research indicates that other factors have hindered the development of green energy markets, including supply side problems and poor regulation. Using an epidemic diffusion framework our model shows how increasing consumer environmental concern driven {{by word of mouth}} and mass media communication channels results in {{a growing number of people}} who state they are WTP for green energy. The presence of upward response bias and the free rider problem result in ‘feasible adoption’ being below stated WTP. Feasible adoption is, in turn, differentiated from actual adoption by the extent of market imperfections. It is concluded that; (1) the potential of such markets may take time to reap and that the low penetration rates of today may reflect a conventional diffusion trajectory and (2); low and stable energy prices appear to be a precondition if consumers are to contribute substantively to the funding of renewables investments through green tariffs...|$|R
40|$|This paper proposes an {{empirical}} {{investigation of the}} effect of different trade barriers on wages in Egypt. The effect of trade barriers on wage disparity has been widely discussed at both empirical and public policy levels. This debate mainly dealt with traditional tariff barriers. Less attention has been attributed to other barriers such as non-tariff measures and red tape costs. However, these barriers, and in particular red tape costs, are more impeding than tariffs in developing countries. Thus, using a microeconomic dataset, I try to assess to what extent different trade barriers affected wage disparity and employment in Egypt. This disparity is studied in three dimensions: on gender (males vs. females), qualification (blue vs. white collars) and regional (urban vs. rural workers). My main findings show that both non-tariff measures and red tape barriers have a higher impact than traditional <b>tariffs</b> on wage <b>disparity.</b> Females, urban workers and blue collars are more affected by such barriers. Finally, when the effects of observable worker characteristics are filtered out, it turns out that wage premia are negatively affected by all trade barriers...|$|R
