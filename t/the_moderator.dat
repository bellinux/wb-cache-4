5|$|The {{design of}} the {{reactors}} for plutonium production involved several problems, not just in nuclear physics but in engineering and construction. Issues such as the long-term effect of radiation on materials received considerable attention from the Metallurgical Laboratory. Two types of reactors were considered: homogeneous, in which <b>the</b> <b>moderator</b> and fuel were mixed together, and heterogeneous, in which <b>the</b> <b>moderator</b> and fuel were arranged in a lattice configuration. By late 1941, mathematical analysis had shown that the lattice design had advantages over the homogeneous type, {{and so it was}} chosen for CP-1, and for the later production reactors as well. For a neutron moderator, graphite was chosen {{on the basis of its}} availability compared with beryllium or heavy water.|$|E
5|$|In {{these early}} days we {{explored}} {{all sorts of}} power reactors, comparing {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of each type. The number of possibilities was enormous, since there are many possibilities for each component of a reactor—fuel, coolant, moderator. The fissile material may be 233U, 235U, or 239Pu; the coolant may be: water, heavy water, gas, or liquid metal; <b>the</b> <b>moderator</b> may be: water, heavy water, beryllium, graphite—or, in a fast- neutron reactor, no moderator. I have calculated that, if one counted all the combinations of fuel, coolant, and moderator, one could identify about a thousand distinct reactors. Thus, at the very beginning of nuclear power, we had to choose which possibilities to pursue, which to ignore.|$|E
30|$|The {{beneficial}} effect {{of an active}} moderator {{may be explained by}} its potential uncertainty reducing function[43]. That is, the potential of <b>the</b> <b>moderator’s</b> comments to guide the user participants towards providing comments in line with the goal of the design feedback as seen from <b>the</b> <b>moderator’s</b> perspective. As <b>the</b> <b>moderator’s</b> comments contain praise for useful participant comments, enquiry for more detail, and requests for others to offer their viewpoint, these comments may clarify to the participants what is expected from their participation.|$|R
5000|$|The primetime debate {{featured}} numerous {{clashes between}} {{the candidates and}} <b>the</b> <b>moderators,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>moderators</b> were criticized - both by the candidates and by commentators in the aftermath - for perceived rudeness towards the candidates, asking questions that were perceived as biased. Cruz, Rubio, Christie, Huckabee, Trump, and Carson all criticized <b>the</b> <b>moderators</b> at some point or another, and often received the loudest applause as a result. <b>The</b> CNBC <b>moderators</b> were also criticized by some news outlets, such as The Daily Beast, with Bill Maher, Byron York, and Stuart Rothenberg also criticizing <b>the</b> <b>moderators.</b> [...] Other news sources have come out in support of CNBC's vigorous vetting of the candidates, such as The Guardian. At Salon, Huffington Post Senior Media Editor Jack Mirkinson described CNBC's handling of the debate as [...] "catastrophic", while feminist blogger and former John Edwards Campaign Blogmaster Amanda Marcotte described the questions as [...] "substantive".|$|R

5|$|Waller was a {{counsel in}} ecclesiastical trials. He {{went to the}} General Assemblies in 1844, 1853, 1861, 1865 to 1867, 1876, 1886, and 1890. He was {{interested}} in foreign missions and devoted one service per month to news from foreign missions and was elected to a four-year term on the Board of Foreign Missions in 1865. He was elected to be <b>the</b> <b>Moderator</b> of Presbytery in 1842, 1851, and 1881. At that time {{he was the only}} person to be elected to that position more than once.|$|E
5|$|Within Presbyterian Church heraldry, a minister's hat is {{represented}} as black {{with a single}} tassel on each side, sometimes blue, though a doctoral bonnet or Geneva cap may replace the brimmed hat. Clergy of the Chapel Royal display red tassels. The office of moderator does not have corporate arms, but for official occasions, a moderator may add tassels to his personal arms to indicate parity with offices of other churches: three for a moderator of a presbytery, and six for a moderator of a regional synod. <b>The</b> <b>moderator</b> of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland now uses a differenced version of the General Assembly's arms, with a hat having a blue cord and ten tassels on each side, and may also show the moderator's staff, a gold Celtic crosier, behind the shield {{as can be seen}} in vol 41, p 152 of the Scots Public Register.|$|E
25|$|The U-shaped {{pressure}} tubes {{containing the}} fuel were thermally {{isolated from the}} hot fuel assembly by two circular thermal baffle tubes around the fuel assembly. This allowed the pressure tubes to operate at low temperatures, essentially that of <b>the</b> <b>moderator</b> tank which was maintained about 155 degrees F and close to atmospheric pressure. <b>The</b> <b>moderator</b> tank contained heavy water which moderated the fission process during operation of the reactor.|$|E

25|$|In 2003 {{the society}} held a {{constitutional}} convention that updated the original document, adjusting {{the organization to}} suit changes that {{had happened in the}} previous 200 years, such as co-education.

Philolexian has several officers, <b>the</b> <b>Moderator</b> (de facto president), Scriba, and Censor (emeritus president), as well as other enviable positions, including Herald, Keeper of the Halls, Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sergeant-at-Arms, Whip, Minister of Internet Truth, Nomenclaturist-General, Symposiarch, and Literary Czar, editor of the literary journal of the Society. These titles are derived from the roles performed at the meeting, at which <b>the</b> <b>Moderator</b> leads debate, the Scriba records minutes, and the Censor adds his or her views about the debates, censuring or commending members as necessary.|$|E
