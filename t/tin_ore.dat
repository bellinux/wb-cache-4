5|$|While 18thcentury metal mines {{had worked}} on the {{principle}} of adult men digging the ore and women and children picking and cobbing the ore ready for smelting, in the new large-scale mines of the early 19thcentury working practices changed. The strenuous underground work was still carried out by male workers, as was breaking large rocks with heavy hammers ('ragging'). In copper mines, very young girls, and sick and injured older women, carried out the simple work of picking. Girls in their late teens forced the broken ore through a broad mesh to sort the ore ('riddling'), and used hammers to break the large chunks of ore left by the riddling process into smaller chunks. Girls in their mid-teens cobbed the resulting chunks, separating the valuable ore from waste rock. Grown women would carry out the heavy manual labour of breaking rocks with hammers ('spalling'), of crushing sorted ore to small grains ready for smelting ('bucking') and of transporting ore between various pieces of apparatus. An experienced bal maiden working as a spaller would produce approximately one ton (2240lb; 1016kg) of broken ore per day, {{depending on the type of}} stone. In the tin mines, in which ore could be crushed far more finely than copper before smelting, cobbing and bucking did not take place. Instead, the chunks of spalled ore were mechanically stamped to fine grains, and washed into a series of collecting pits to separate the coarse 'rough' from the fine 'slimes'. The resulting rough and slimes were separated out on large wooden frames ('buddling' and 'framing' respectively), to extract the <b>tin</b> <b>ore</b> from the surrounding dust and grit.|$|E
25|$|After {{collection}} the <b>tin</b> <b>ore</b> {{had to be}} crushed, concentrated and then smelted. Over time a series of ever more sophisticated processes were used for these operations.|$|E
25|$|There is mining of copper, iron, manganese, gold, {{cassiterite}} (<b>tin</b> <b>ore),</b> and phosphates. These operations provide {{employment and}} generate international aid. Gold production increased 32% in 2011 at six gold mine sites, making Burkina Faso the fourth-largest gold producer in Africa, after South Africa, Mali and Ghana.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Tin {{resources}} are mainly distributed in Yunnan and Guangxi autonomous regions, China. <b>Tin</b> <b>ores</b> {{in these areas}} are characterized by polymetallic constituents, including copper, zinc, lead and other associated elements that can be recovered. Due to the complex mineral composition and texture of the ores, gravity concentration, flotation {{as well as some}} combined processing techniques used in some major concentrators are reviewed and discussed. Case study shows that the comprehensive utilization of the <b>tin</b> <b>ores</b> can be realized to produce some marketable products for smelters. But much work on recovery of the fine fractions of tin shall still be done to get a good processing performance for the resource sustainable development...|$|R

It was short of money and operated with a single hired locomotive at first, carrying minerals from Caradon to the sea at Looe, as well as coal and machinery, and some agricultural materials up the valley.|$|R
25|$|In South America, arsenical bronze was the {{predominant}} alloy in Ecuador and north and central Peru, {{because of the}} rich arsenic bearing ores present there. By contrast, the south and central Andes, southern Peru, Bolivia and parts of Argentina, were rich in the <b>tin</b> <b>ore</b> Cassiterite and thus did not use arsenical bronze.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of the tin mines on Dartmoor are located in granite country rock {{and most of the}} lodes trend ENE–WSW and are of limited length, though there are exceptions. In the underground workings, the <b>tin</b> <b>ore,</b> cassiterite, was usually found in association with large amounts of tourmaline, and in central Dartmoor with much specular haematite. In {{the southern part of the}} moor, the cassiterite was usually found in relatively large grains, but the lodes were of very variable quality. These factors, combined with the fact that none of the underground workings was found to be profitable at depth, are typical of the deepest zone of tin mineralisation. The once very extensive alluvial deposits of <b>tin</b> <b>ore,</b> that were the first deposits to be mined, also point to the vast quantity of ore that once existed in lodes that have been eroded from above the granite since it was emplaced in the Carboniferous period.|$|E

They were made redundant {{with the introduction of}} explosives, although hydraulic mining is still used on alluvial <b>tin</b> <b>ores.</b> They were also used to produce a controlled supply to wash the crushed ore. It is highly likely that they also developed water-powered stamp mills to crush hard ore, which could be washed to collect the heavy gold dust.|$|R

25|$|The {{earliest}} {{method of}} liberating the metal from the <b>tin</b> <b>ore</b> necessitated two smeltings: {{the first was}} done {{at or near the}} streamworks and involved no more than a fire used to roast the ore; the second smelting was done at one of the Stannary towns. Little is known of the details of these practices, but their existence is confirmed by early documents that mention taxation of first and second smeltings. The introduction of the efficient blowing house process in around 1300 allowed the use of just one smelting. Later still reverberatory furnaces were used. Both types were in use at Eylesbarrow mine {{in the first half of}} the 19th century—the last place on Dartmoor where smelting was done.|$|E
25|$|The {{empire of}} Carthage {{depended}} heavily on its trade with Tartessos {{and with other}} cities of the Iberian peninsula, from which it obtained vast quantities of silver, lead, copper and– even more importantly– <b>tin</b> <b>ore,</b> which was essential for the manufacture of bronze objects by the civilizations of antiquity. Carthaginian trade-relations with the Iberians, and the naval might that enforced Carthage's monopoly on this trade and the Atlantic tin trade, made it the sole significant broker of tin and maker of bronze in its day. Maintaining this monopoly {{was one of the}} major sources of power and prosperity for Carthage; Carthaginian merchants strove to keep the location of the tin mines secret. In addition to its role as the sole significant distributor of tin, Carthage's central location in the Mediterranean and control of the waters between Sicily and Tunisia allowed it to control the eastern peoples' supply of tin. Carthage was also the Mediterranean's largest producer of silver, mined in Iberia and on the North African coast; after the tin monopoly, this was one of its most profitable trades. One mine in Iberia provided Hannibal with 300 Roman pounds (3.75 talents) of silver a day.|$|E
2500|$|Although it {{was once}} a large and {{important}} mine, there are no known plans of its extensive underground workings, and there are few extant records of its output of <b>tin</b> <b>ore.</b> What is known, however, is that {{a total of about}} 276tons of white tin was [...] "coined" [...] (i.e. recorded and taxed) at Tavistock, the nearest stannary town, between the years 1822 and 1831, and this may have been worth almost £30,000. The mine's most productive year was 1825, when 403 blocks of tin weighing over 1,220cwt in total were coined.|$|E
50|$|The {{power of}} a wave of water {{released}} from a tank was used for extraction of metal ores in a method known as hushing. The method was first used at the Dolaucothi Gold Mines in Wales from 75 AD onwards, but had been developed in Spain at such mines as Las Médulas. Hushing was also widely used in Britain in the Medieval and later periods to extract lead and <b>tin</b> <b>ores.</b> It later evolved into hydraulic mining when used during the California Gold Rush.|$|R

50|$|Cassiterite (SnO2), the {{tin oxide}} form of tin, {{was most likely}} the {{original}} source of tin in ancient times. Other forms of <b>tin</b> <b>ores</b> are less abundant sulfides such as stannite that require a more involved smelting process. Cassiterite often accumulates in alluvial channels as placer deposits because it is harder, heavier, and more chemically resistant than the accompanying granite. Cassiterite is usually black, purple or otherwise dark in color, and these deposits can be easily seen in river banks. Alluvial (placer) deposits could be easily collected and separated by methods similar to gold panning.|$|R

[...] Industrial enterprises are concentrated in the capital Yakutsk, as well as in Aldan, Mirny, Neryungri, Pokrovsk, and Udachny. [...] The diamond, gold and <b>tin</b> <b>ore</b> mining industries are the major focus of the economy. Uranium ore is beginning to be mined. Turkic-language Sakha are in politics, government, finance, economy and cattle-breeding (horses and cows for milk and meat).

2500|$|Although {{individual}} grains or pebbles of alluvial tin {{collected by}} streaming were often of high purity {{it was usually}} still necessary to remove the unwanted [...] "gangue" [...] material before the ore could be smelted. The need for this process, which was known as dressing the ore, increased as the poorer sources of lode tin were exploited. The principle of concentration was a refined version of that used by the early tin-streamers: it depended on the large difference in specific gravity between the wanted <b>tin</b> <b>ore</b> and the gangue. Many different mechanical methods were used, including rectangular and circular buddles, Wilfley tables and revolving slime tables, kieves, trommels, and even magnetic separation.|$|E
2500|$|Copper ore, being {{relatively}} abundant, and <b>tin</b> <b>ore</b> {{became the}} next important {{players in the}} story of metalworking. Using heat to smelt copper from ore, a great deal of copper was produced. It was used for both jewelry and simple tools. However, copper by itself was too soft for tools requiring edges and stiffness. At some point tin was added into the molten copper and bronze was born. [...] Bronze is an alloy of copper and tin. [...] Bronze was an important advance because it had the edge-durability and stiffness that pure copper lacked. [...] Until the advent of iron, bronze was the most advanced metal for tools and weapons in common use (see Bronze Age for more detail).|$|E

50|$|From 1836, {{copper and}} <b>tin</b> <b>ores</b> were {{discovered}} in the Caradon area, {{and had to be}} brought to the sea for onward transport to market. Packhorse conveyance to Moorswater meant that the Canal could be used for part of the journey, but the difficulties of horse transport between the mines and Moorswater soon led to plans {{for the construction of a}} railway. The Liskeard and Caradon Railway was built to bring the ores, and also granite, down to Moorswater. At Moorswater the minerals were transferred to barges, which transported them down the canal to Looe, from where coastal shipping took them to market.|$|R
2500|$|The {{purpose of}} a {{stamping}} mill is to crush the mined ore to a fine sand which is then processed at an adjacent [...] "dressing floor" [...] to separate the heavier <b>tin</b> <b>ore</b> from the waste material or [...] "gangue", which is dumped.

The Kafang skarn copper (tin) deposit {{is one of}} important mineral deposits of the Gejiu region. Re-Os dating of five molybdenite separated from the Kafang skarn ore bodies gives an isochron age of 83. 4 ± 2. 1 Ma and model age ranges from 82. 95 ± 1. 16 to 83. 54 ± 1. 31 Ma. This age is in good agreement with Laoka granite zircon LA-ICP-MS U-Pb age(85 ± 0. 85 Ma). These ages suggest that the mineralization in the Kafang skarn deposit was genetically assoicatted to the Laoka granite. The Re contents of molybdenite indicate that ore-forming materials are derived from mantle and crust. Based on the geochronological data of Dulong Sn-Zn deposit, Bainiuchang Ag super-large deposit, Dachang <b>tin</b> polymetallic <b>ore</b> field and Wangshe Cu-W deposit and analysis of tectonic evolution of Southeast of Yunnan Province, we propose that these deposits occurred at the same geodynamic framework {{as a result of}} large scale mineralization in South China...|$|R
6000|$|The {{agent of}} the {{smelting}} company--a stout, intelligent man, who evidently did [...] "knaw tin"--conducted them first to the furnaces, in the neighbourhood of which were ranged a number of large wooden troughs or bins, all more or less filled with <b>tin</b> <b>ore.</b> The ore got from different mines, he said, differed in quality, {{as well as in}} the percentage of tin which it contained. Some had much iron mixed with it, in spite of all the washings it had undergone; some had a little copper and other substances; while some was very pure. By mixing the tin of different mines, better metal could be procured than by simply smelting the produce of each mine separately. Pointing to one of the bins, about three yards square, he told them it contained tin worth 1,000 pounds. There was a large quantity of black sand in one of the bins, which, the agent said, was got by the process of [...] "streaming." [...] It is the richest and best kind of <b>tin</b> <b>ore,</b> and used to be procured in large quantities in Cornwall--especially in ancient times--being found near the surface, but, as a matter of course, not much of that is to be found now, the land having been turned over three times in search of it. This black sand is now imported in large quantities from Singapore.|$|E
60|$|The agent then {{conducted}} his {{visitors to}} the testing-house, where he showed them the process of testing the various qualities of <b>tin</b> <b>ore</b> offered, to the House for sale. First he weighed out twenty parts of the ore, which, as we have said, resembled snuff. This, he remarked, contained about five-sixths of pure tin, the remaining one-sixth being dross. He mixed it with four parts of fine coal dust, or culm, and added a little borax--these last ingredients being intended to expedite the smelting process. This compound was put into a crucible, and subjected to the intense heat of a small furnace for about twenty minutes. At {{the end of that}} time, the agent seized the crucible with a pair of tongs, poured the metal into an iron mould, and threw away the dross. The little mass of tin thus produced was about four inches long, by half an inch broad, and of a dull bluish-grey colour. It was then put into an iron ladle and melted, as one would melt lead when about to cast bullets, but it was particularly noteworthy here, that a very slight heat was required. To extract the metal from the <b>tin</b> <b>ore,</b> a fierce heat, long applied, was necessary, but a slight heat, continued for a few minutes, sufficed to melt the metal. This remelted metal was poured into a stone mould, where it lay like a bright little pool of liquid silver. In a few seconds it solidified, retaining its clear purity in all its parts.|$|E
6000|$|At {{this point}} in the process, our mass of tin leaves the rough hand of the miner. In former days it was divided among the {{shareholders}} in this form--each receiving, instead of cash, so many sacks of <b>tin</b> <b>ore,</b> according to the number of his shares or [...] "doles," [...] and carrying it off on mule or horse back from the mine, to be smelted where or by whom he pleased. But whether treated in this way, or, as in the present day, sold by the manager at the market value, it all comes at last to the tin-smelter, whose further proceedings we shall now follow, in company with Oliver and his friend.|$|E
