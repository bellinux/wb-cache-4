5|$|A {{tropical}} depression formed on February7 south of Diego Garcia. For about a week, the system remained weak and changed directions several times; after an eastward movement, it {{turned to the}} northwest, curved to the southeast, and later began a steady <b>track</b> <b>to</b> the southwest. On February13, it intensified into a moderate tropical storm, and quickly attained peak winds of 95km/h (60mph). Given the name Haja, the storm passed southeast of Rodrigues and Réunion. Haja approached the southeast coast of Madagascar, but turned to the southeast and weakened, dissipating on February19.|$|E
5|$|After {{becoming}} a tropical cyclone, the depression {{turned to a}} northwest motion before resuming a <b>track</b> <b>to</b> the west-northwest. On May7 it intensified into a deep depression, and though its winds had increased, the structure became disorganized as the center became exposed from the thunderstorm activity. The convection waned, due {{to the influence of}} dry air from the Arabian Peninsula, as well as from wind shear. As a result, the IMD downgraded it to depression status early on May8. However, later in the day, convection redeveloped over the western half of the circulation, and it again reached deep depression status, about 830km (515mi) southeast of Oman.|$|E
