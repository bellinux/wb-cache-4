40|$|We {{present an}} {{adaptive}} method for tessellating the trimmed NURBS {{surface in the}} parametric domain. Given a model space tolerance ε, the algorithm first splits the NURBS surface in both the U and V directions to fit within the bounding box of the outer <b>trimming</b> <b>loop.</b> Then we subdivide the surface into Bézier patches recursively until the control net of the Bézier patch is flat enough and within the tolerance ε. By building up the quadtrees of inner <b>trimming</b> <b>loops,</b> we use the scanline algorithm to remove the patches inside the inner <b>trimming</b> <b>loops.</b> Finally, we close the inner <b>trimming</b> <b>loops</b> {{with a set of}} triangles.

Two monomers associate to form an extended beta-sandwich, each with the same jelly roll topology typical of legume lectins but with dramatically <b>trimmed</b> <b>loops</b> and with different dimer association. Each monomer binds one N-acetyllactosamine molecule in a topologically and spatially different site than that of legume lectins. The carbohydrate-binding site provides an unprecedented paradigm for carbohydrate binding, with a unique network of salt bridges. The specificity for beta-galactose arises from intricate interactions that constrain the position of the O 4 atom...|$|R

40|$|Most offset {{approximation}} algorithms for freeform {{curves and}} surfaces may be classified into two main groups. The first approximates the curve using simple primitives such as piecewise arcs and lines and then calculates the (exact) offset operator to this approximation. The second offsets the control polygon/mesh and then attempts {{to estimate the}} error of the approximated offset over a region. Most of the current offset algorithms estimate the error using a finite set of samples taken from the region and therefore can not guarantee the offset approximation is within a given tolerance over the whole curve or surface. This paper presents new methods to globally bound the error of the approximated offset of freeform curves and surfaces and then automatically derive new approximations with improved accuracy. These tools {{can also be used}} to develop a global error bound for a variable distance offset operation and to detect and <b>trim</b> out <b>loops</b> in the offset. 1 Introduction Offset surfaces ar [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) {{are short}} RNA {{sequences}} that guide post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression via complementarity to their target mRNAs. Discovered only recently, miRNAs have drawn {{a lot of}} attention. Multiple protein complexes interact to first cleave a hairpin from nascent RNA, export it into the cytosol, <b>trim</b> its <b>loop,</b> and incorporate it into the RISC complex which is important for binding its target mRNA. This process works within one cell, but circulating miRNAs have been described suggesting a role in cell-cell communication. Motivation: Viruses and intracellular parasites like Toxoplasma gondii use miRNAs to manipulate host gene expression from within the cellular environment. However, recent research has claimed that a rice miRNA may regulate human gene expression. Despite ongoing debates about these findings and general reluctance to accept them, a recent report claimed that foodborne plant miRNAs pass through the digestive tract, travel through blood to be incorporated by alveolar cells excreting milk. The miRNAs are then said to have some immunerelated function in the newborn. Principal Findings: We acquired the data that supports their claim and performed further analyses. In addition to the reported miRNAs, {{we were able to}} detect almost complete mRNAs and found that the foreign RNA expression profiles among samples are exceedingly similar. Inspecting the source of the data helped understand how RNAs could contaminate the samples. Conclusion: Viewing these findings in context with the difficulties foreign RNAs face on their route into breast milk and the fact that many identified foodborne miRNAs are not from actual food sources, we can conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the original claims and evidence presented may be due to artifacts. We report that the study claiming their existence is more likely to have detected RNA contamination than miRNAs. Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (113 E 326...|$|R
