2500|$|Justice Thomas {{identified}} two principal defects in Hope's case {{that led him}} to conclude that the prison guards Hope sued were entitled to qualified immunity. [...] First, the three guards Hope sued were not directly involved in the June incident, the one the Court found to be most disagreeable. [...] Two of them were not even present at the time, and the third's sole contribution to the injury Hope alleged was the act of attaching Hope to the [...] "restraining bar". [...] As against the defendants Hope himself named in this suit, <b>then,</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not allege that they were the cause of his injuries, and thus Hope's complaint was, in Thomas's view, deficient.|$|E

2500|$|As part of {{the third}} stage of his work, Randel {{intended}} to create an extremely large map of the city, at an unprecedented scale. This has been a {{part of the}} agreement between Randel and the Common Council in 1812, but had been forgotten by all except Randel. Somewhat peeved to be reminded of it six years later, the council nonetheless honored the contract, and officially commissioned Randel to make his map. This was done by way of 92 [...] by [...] colored [...] "Farm Maps" [...] made at a scale of [...] that overlaid Manhattan's natural topography with the intended grid. When put together, the Farm Maps made a map of the city about [...] long. It took Randel and his wife Matilda two years, from 1819 to 1820, to finish the maps, working from their new home, having moved to Orange, New Jersey. [...] He needed, asked for, and received an extension from the Common Council to complete the task, and even <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not quite make the deadline, delivering the last maps in September 1820, about four months late.|$|E
2500|$|Munk {{applied for}} American {{citizenship}} in 1939 after the Anschluss and {{enlisted in the}} ski troops of the U.S. Army as a private. This was unusual as all the other young men at Scripps joined the U.S. Naval Reserve. Munk was eventually excused from military service to undertake defense-related research at Scripps. He joined several of his colleagues from Scripps at the U.S. Navy Radio and Sound Laboratory, where they developed methods related to amphibious warfare. Their methods were used successfully to predict surf conditions for Allied landings in North Africa, the Pacific theater of war, and on D-Day during the Normandy invasion. [...] Munk commented in 2009, [...] "The Normandy landing is famous because weather conditions were very poor {{and you may not}} realize it was postponed by General Eisenhower for 24 hours because of the prevailing wave conditions. And <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> decide, {{in spite of the fact}} that conditions were not favorable, it would be better to go in than lose the surprise element, which would have been lost if they waited for the next tidal cycle two weeks." ...|$|E

I had the idea of just this guy, a fat little monster sits there very relaxed and says, [...] "Oh yeah, oh yeah". So I told him, 'Why don't you try just to sing on and on 'oh yeah'?... Dieter was very angry when I told him this and he said, 'are you crazy, all the time [...] "Oh yeah"? Are you crazy?! I can't do this, no no, come on, come on.' And then he said, 'some lyrics, like [...] "the moon... beautiful", is this too much?!' and I said, 'no, it's OK', and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> this 'oh yeah' and at the end he thought, 'yeah it's nice', he loved it himself also.

2500|$|According to {{historian}} Claude Campbell, John Maynard Keynes [...] "set {{the fashion}} for {{critics of the}} economic aspects of the treaty" [...] and [...] "made probably the severest and most sweeping indictment of its economic provisions". Keynes was temporarily attached to the British Treasury {{during the war and}} was their official representative at the peace conference. He later resigned [...] "when it became evident that hope could no longer be entertained of substantial modifications in the draft Terms of Peace" [...] due to the [...] "policy of the Conference towards the economic problems of Europe". In 1919, he wrote The Economic Consequences of the Peace based on his objections. He wrote that he believed [...] "that the campaign for securing out of Germany the general costs of the war {{was one of the most}} serious acts of political unwisdom for which our statesmen have ever been responsible", and called the treaty a [...] "Carthaginian peace" [...] that would economically affect all of Europe. Keynes said that the treaty's reparation figures [...] "generally exceed Germany's capacity" [...] to pay. He said that [...] was the [...] "safe maximum figure", but even <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> [...] "not believe that [...] pay as much". He said the Reparation Commission was a tool that could [...] "be employed to destroy Germany's commercial and economic organization as well as to exact payment".|$|E
