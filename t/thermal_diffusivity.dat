The speed that the heat travels away from the probe as well as the speed that it travels between probes allows scientists to measure thermal conductivity specific heat (the ability of the regolith to conduct heat relative to its ability to store heat) and <b>thermal</b> <b>diffusivity</b> (the speed at which a thermal disturbance is propagated in the soil).|$|E
25|$|The thermal {{properties}} of cryospheric elements also have important climatic consequences. Snow and ice have much lower thermal diffusivities than air. <b>Thermal</b> <b>diffusivity</b> {{is a measure}} of the speed at which temperature waves can penetrate a substance. Snow and ice are many orders of magnitude less efficient at diffusing heat than air. Snow cover insulates the ground surface, and sea ice insulates the underlying ocean, decoupling the surface-atmosphere interface with respect to both heat and moisture fluxes. The flux of moisture from a water surface is eliminated by even a thin skin of ice, whereas the flux of heat through thin ice continues to be substantial until it attains a thickness in excess of 30 to 40cm. However, even a small amount of snow on top of the ice will dramatically reduce the heat flux and slow down the rate of ice growth. The insulating effect of snow also has major implications for the hydrological cycle. In non-permafrost regions, the insulating effect of snow is such that only near-surface ground freezes and deep-water drainage is uninterrupted.|$|E

500|$|The {{heat-affected zone}} (HAZ) is a ring {{surrounding}} the weld {{in which the}} temperature of the welding process, combined with the stresses of uneven heating and cooling, alter the heat-treatment properties of the alloy. The effects of welding on the material surrounding the weld can be detrimental—depending on the materials used and the heat input of the welding process used, the HAZ can be of varying size and strength. The <b>thermal</b> <b>diffusivity</b> of the base material plays a large role—if the diffusivity is high, the material cooling rate is high and the HAZ is relatively small. Conversely, a low diffusivity leads to slower cooling and a larger HAZ. The amount of heat injected by the welding process plays an important role as well, as processes like oxyacetylene welding have an unconcentrated heat input and increase the size of the HAZ. Processes like laser beam welding give a highly concentrated, limited amount of heat, resulting in a small HAZ. Arc welding falls between these two extremes, with the individual processes varying somewhat in heat input.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between the midplane scrape-off-layer electron temperature profile and the parallel heat flux profile at the divertor in tokamaks is investigated. A model is applied which takes into account anisotropic thermal diffusion, in a rectilinear geometry with constant density. Eigenmode analysis {{is applied to the}} simplified problem with constant <b>thermal</b> <b>diffusivities.</b> A self-similar nonlinear solution is found for the more realistic problem with anisotropically temperature-dependent <b>thermal</b> <b>diffusivities.</b> Numerical solutions are developed for both cases, with spatially dependent heat flux emerging from the plasma. For both constant and temperature-dependent <b>thermal</b> <b>diffusivities</b> it is found that, below about one-half of its peak, the heat flux profile shape at the divertor, compared with the midplane temperature profile shape, is robustly described by the simplest two-point model. However the physical processes are not those assumed in the simplest two-point model, nor is the numerical coefficient relating q||div to Tmp χ||mp/L|| as predicted. For realistic parameters the peak in the heat flux, moreover, can be reduced by a factor of two or more from the two-point model scaling which fits the remaining profile. For temperature profiles in the SOL region above the x-point set by marginal stability, the heat flux profile to the divertor can be largely decoupled from the prediction of the two-point model. These results suggest caveats for data interpretation, and possibly favorable outcomes for divertor configurations with extended field lines...|$|R

40|$|A {{new method}} for thermal {{characterization}} of heterogeneous materials has been proposed. As for homogeneous {{materials in the}} first part of the paper, the method is based on the use of Karhunen-Loève decomposition (KLD) techniques in association with infrared thermography experiments or any other experimental device providing dense data in the spatial coordinate. Orthogonal properties of KLD eigenfunctions and states are used for achieving simple estimates of <b>thermal</b> <b>diffusivities.</b> It has been proven that diffusivities can be estimated without explicit knowledge of variables and parameters related to heat exchanges at the interfaces (i. e. thermal conductivities, thermal contact resistances). Indeed, the diffusivities estimates only depend on some few KLD eigenelements. As a result, a significant amplification of the signal/noise ratios is reached. Moreover, it is shown that spatially uncorrelated noise has no effect on KLD eigenfunctions, the noise being entirely reported on states (time-dependent projection coefficients). This is particularly interesting because <b>thermal</b> <b>diffusivities</b> estimates involve spatial derivatives of the eigenfunctions. Consequently, the proposed method results in an attractive combination of parsimony and robustness to noise. The effectiveness of the method is illustrated through some simulated experimental applications. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC...|$|R
