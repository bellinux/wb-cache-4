5|$|In the {{mandible}} (lower jaw), <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>and</b> lower masseteric ridges {{come close}} together below the first molars, {{but do not}} fuse. The {{back end of the}} lower incisor root is in a capsular process, a raising of the mandibular bone behind the molars. The upper incisors have yellowish enamel and are opisthodont, with the cutting edge inclined backwards. The molars are relatively small and are brachydont (low-crowned) and bunodont (with the cusps higher than the connecting crests). They {{are similar to those of}} the marsh rice rat in structural details. <b>The</b> <b>upper</b> <b>and</b> lower first molars have small accessory roots, as in many other oryzomyines, and the second and third lower molar each have two roots only.|$|E

5|$|The Pondicherry shark has {{a robust}} build and a {{moderately}} long, pointed snout. The large and circular eyes {{are equipped with}} nictitating membranes. Each nostril is broad with a small, narrow nipple-shaped lobe on the anterior rim. The arched mouth lacks conspicuous furrows or enlarged pores at the corners. <b>The</b> <b>upper</b> <b>and</b> lower jaws contain 14–15 and 12–14 tooth rows on either side respectively; in addition, there are one or two rows of small teeth at <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>and</b> lower symphyses (jaw midpoints). The upper teeth have a single narrow, smooth-edged central cusp, flanked on both sides by very large serrations. The lower teeth are narrower and more upright than the uppers, and may be smooth to finely serrated. The five pairs of gill slits are fairly long.|$|E
5|$|The {{grey reef shark}} has a streamlined, {{moderately}} stout {{body with}} a long, blunt snout and large, round eyes. <b>The</b> <b>upper</b> <b>and</b> lower jaws each have 13 or 14 teeth (usually 14 in <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>and</b> 13 in the lower). The upper teeth are triangular with slanted cusps, while the bottom teeth have narrower, erect cusps. The tooth serrations are larger in the upper jaw than in the lower. The first dorsal fin is medium-sized, {{and there is no}} ridge running between it and the second dorsal fin. The pectoral fins are narrow and falcate (sickle-shaped).|$|E

5|$|Another key {{aspect of}} SIM Lite's mission was {{determining}} <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>and</b> lower limits of star's masses. Today, scientists {{understand that there}} are limits to the how small or large a star can be. Objects that are too small lack the internal pressure to initiate thermonuclear fusion, which is what causes a star to shine. These objects are known as brown dwarfs and represent {{the lower end of the}} stellar mass scale. Stars that are too large become unstable and explode in a supernova.|$|E
5|$|As {{inert gas}} is {{introduced}} into {{a mixture of}} hydrocarbon vapors and air, it increases the lower flammable limit or lowest concentration at which the vapors can be ignited. At {{the same time it}} decreases the upper flammable limit or highest concentration at which the vapors can be ignited. When the total concentration of oxygen in the tank reaches about 11%, <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>and</b> lower flammable limits converge and the flammable range disappears.|$|E
5|$|At {{some point}} in the 18th century, {{possibly}} in 1753, <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>and</b> lower halves of the tower were divided into two separate areas. The spiral staircase from the ground floor kitchen to the upper floors, holding the records, was removed, and a window on the first floor was turned into a doorway so that the upper floors could be accessed from the neighbouring house. A fire-resistant stone vaulted ceiling was installed in on the first floor, possibly also in 1753 at a cost of £350.|$|E

5|$|Condor bones {{have been}} found in Native American graves, as have condor feather headdresses. Cave {{paintings}} of condors have also been discovered. Some tribes ritually killed condors to make ceremonial clothing out of their feathers. Shamans then danced while wearing these to reach <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>and</b> lower spiritual worlds. Whenever a shaman died, his clothes were said to be cursed, so new clothing had to be made for his successor. Some scientists, such as Noel Snyder, believe that this process of making ceremonial clothing contributed to the condor's decline.|$|E

A feature of the upper park is the Fountain of Trilby, which was placed there in 1829. The lower park is modelled upon a style called the Italian Renaissance garden.
