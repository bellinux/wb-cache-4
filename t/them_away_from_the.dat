5|$|Black women {{played a}} minor role in units {{such as the}} Rhodesia Native Regiment, {{accompanying}} the black soldiers into the operational area and performing domestic tasks like washing and cooking. Many of these were local East African women who had formed attachments with RNR soldiers. Officers tolerated {{the presence of these}} women in the interest of morale, aware that attempting to take <b>them</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> men would probably lead to mutiny.|$|E
5|$|Despite having dark plumage in a {{tropical}} climate, frigatebirds have found ways not to overheat—particularly {{as they are}} exposed to full sunlight when on the nest. They ruffle feathers to lift <b>them</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> skin and improve air circulation, and can extend and upturn their wings to expose the hot undersurface to the air and lose heat by evaporation and convection. Frigatebirds also place their heads in the shade of their wings, and males frequently flutter their gular pouches.|$|E
5|$|In August 2009, after {{dozens of}} people {{reported}} seeing a mermaid leaping out of Haifa Bay waters and doing aerial tricks, the Israeli coastal town of Kiryat Yam offered a $1 million award for proof of its existence. In February 2012, work on two reservoirs near Gokwe and Mutare in Zimbabwe stopped when workers refused to continue, stating that mermaids had hounded <b>them</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> sites. It was reported by Samuel Sipepa Nkomo, the water resources minister.|$|E

5|$|An {{introduction}} to the series is the Pilot Assist feature. Intended for players new to the series, it is a passive auto-piloting feature that assists players by nudging <b>them</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> edges of the track or from walls, though its effects at higher speed settings are less desirable. Wipeout HD allows players to control their craft by using the motion-sensitive features of the PlayStation's Sixaxis controller. Motion control comes in two variants: pitch and steering, or pitch only. The former allows the craft to be totally controlled by moving the controller, while the latter only allows {{the nose of the}} craft to be raised or lowered by motion control, with the steering either controlled by analogue stick or D-pad.|$|E
5|$|By 1606 {{the missionaries}} had {{concentrated}} many Manche Ch'ols in nine new mission towns, and {{had started to}} penetrate {{the territory of the}} neighbouring Mopan Maya, who were on the borders of the fiercely independent Itza of central Petén. By 1628 the Dominicans were tending to 6,000 Maya in the part of Manche Ch'ol territory that they had gained access to. This figure included some apostate refugees from Spanish-controlled Cahabón. Estimates of the total Manche Ch'ol population in the mid-17th century vary from 10,000 to 30,000, with prominent 20th-century Mayanist J. Eric S. Thompson preferring the lower figure as opposed to the high-end estimates by 17th-century chroniclers. The Dominican penetration of Mopan territory alarmed the Itza, who started to harass the Manche Ch'ol, driving <b>them</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> mission towns.|$|E
5|$|Chadwick {{supported}} British {{involvement in}} the Manhattan Project to the fullest extent, abandoning any hopes of a British project during the war. With Churchill's backing, he attempted to ensure that every request from Groves for assistance was honoured. While the pace of research was easing as the war entered its final phase, these scientists were still in great demand, and it fell to Anderson, Cherwell and Sir Edward Appleton, the Permanent Secretary of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, which was responsible for Tube Alloys, to prise <b>them</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> wartime projects {{in which they were}} invariably engaged.|$|E

5|$|Chile, {{facing the}} Pacific Ocean, {{has a large}} British presence. Over 50,000 British {{immigrants}} settled in Chile from 1840 to 1914. A significant number of them settled in Magallanes Province, especially {{in the city of}} Punta Arenas when it flourished as a major global seaport for ships crossing between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans through the Strait of Magellan. Around 32,000 English settled in Valparaíso, influencing the port city to the extent of making it virtually a British colony during the last decades of the 19th century {{and the beginning of the}} 20th century. However, the opening of the Panama Canal in 1914 and the outbreak of the First World War drove many of <b>them</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> city or back to Europe.|$|E
5|$|The next Imperial {{attempt to}} retake the island with the newly arrived troops {{occurred}} from 20–26 October and was defeated with heavy {{losses in the}} Battle for Henderson Field. At the same time, Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto (the commander of the Japanese Combined Fleet) defeated U.S. naval forces in the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands, driving <b>them</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> area. The Japanese carriers, however, were also forced to retreat because of losses to carrier aircraft and aircrews. Thereafter, Yamamoto's ships returned to their main bases at Truk in Micronesia, where he had his headquarters, and Rabaul while three carriers returned to Japan for repairs and refitting.|$|E
5|$|At 08:50, {{the lead}} U.S. attack {{formation}} from Hornet spotted four ships from Abe's Vanguard force. Pressing on, the U.S. aircraft sighted the Japanese carriers {{and prepared to}} attack. Three Zeros from Zuihō attacked the formation's Wildcats, drawing <b>them</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> bombers they were assigned to protect. Thus, the dive bombers in the first group initiated their attacks without fighter escort. Twenty Zeros from the Japanese carrier CAP attacked the SBD formation and shot down four of them. The remaining 11 SBDs commenced their attack dives on Shōkaku at 09:27, hitting her with three to six bombs, wrecking her flight deck and causing serious damage to {{the interior of the}} ship. The final SBD of the 11 lost track of Shōkaku and instead dropped its bomb near the Japanese destroyer , causing minor damage. The six TBFs in the first strike force, having become separated from their strike group, did not find the Japanese carriers and eventually turned back towards Hornet. On the way back, they attacked the Japanese heavy cruiser , missing with all their torpedoes.|$|E

5|$|By the {{following}} day, 29 November, the garrison's water supply had been exhausted. The {{walls of the}} fort had also collapsed and the garrison was exposed, leading to further casualties amongst the Nepali troops. Seeing the disheartened state of men, the Captain and other officers asked them to sign a pledge {{to fight to the}} last. Eighty-four soldiers signed. However, that night the Mleccha Kalanala Company, which had arrived as reinforcements and was stationed at a portico east of Nalapani, secretly abandoned their post, taking with them their arms and colours. Seeing this, some of the men who had signed the pledge followed. The 50 or 60 men that remained, overcome by the hopelessness of the situation, felt that instead of confronting certain death by remaining in the fort, it was better to escape to the hills and hold their position there. Perhaps unable to convince their commanders with words, the escaping men caught hold of their Captain and other officers by their arms, and dragged <b>them</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> fort. Learning of this new movement, the British renewed their fire; but the Nepalese managed to cut through and make a successful escape.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before the}} action began, Persano left his flagship, , and {{transferred}} to the turret ship Affondatore, though none of his subordinates on the other ships {{were aware of the}} change. They there thus left to fight as individuals without direction. More dangerously, by stopping Re d'Italia, he allowed a significant gap to open up between Vacca's three ships {{and the rest of the}} fleet. Tegetthoff took his fleet through the gap between Vacca's and Persano's ships, in an attempt to split the Italian line and initiate a melee. He failed to ram any Italian vessels on the first pass, so he turned back toward Persano's ships, and took Re d'Italia, San Martino, and Palestro under heavy fire. Vacca turned Principe di Carignano and Castelfidardo to port, taking <b>them</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Austrian ships hammering Persano's division. He briefly attempted to engage the Austrian wooden ships in the rear, but was driven off by heavy fire from three steam frigates.|$|E
5|$|Quatermass is {{rescued by}} a group of elderly people living in a scrap yard. At the hospital, the doctors are shocked when Isabel levitates off her bed and explodes in a cloud of dust. Elsewhere, the devastated Kapp is left alone in the ruins of his cottage and observatory. More and more young people are joining the Planet People, {{including}} the gangs that have been terrorising the cities and the soldiers assigned to keep <b>them</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Megalithic sites. Contact is restored with Chuck Marshall and with the Russians in the form of Gurov (Brewster Mason). Quatermass theorises {{that this is not the}} first time this has happened; megalithic sites such as prehistoric stone circles are in fact markers where beacons have been left by the alien force for its next visit. Quatermass believes the force is a sphere of energy surrounding the Earth. The Russians and the Americans send a space shuttle, commanded by Marshall, to make contact with the force. Quatermass is sceptical; he believes they are dealing not with an intelligence but with a machine constructed to harvest human protein. The space shuttle is destroyed but not before Marshall reports a giant beam of light stretching in all directions. Meanwhile, the Planet People are gathering at Wembley Stadium in the tens of thousands. Annie and Quatermass travel to the stadium but are powerless to prevent the Planet People from gathering. When they are attacked, Annie drives their car into the underground car park beneath the stadium where she crashes the vehicle and is killed. The lightning strikes the stadium.|$|E

50|$|Consequently, many of {{the tracks}} Shrag had {{originally}} intended to appear on their forthcoming album were either shelved or re-recorded by the new line-up, while new songs that the band began working on saw <b>them</b> turning <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> lighter, more poppy original template for the album into much darker and more introspective territory.|$|R
