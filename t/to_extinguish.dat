5|$|In January 1979, an {{electrical}} fire occurred {{on a train}} as it was passing through the Transbay Tube. One firefighter (Lt.

50|$|Electrical fire may {{be fought}} {{in the same way}} as an {{ordinary}} combustible fire, but water, foam, and other conductive agents are not to be used. While the fire is or possibly could be electrically energized, it can be fought with any extinguishing agent rated for electrical fire. Carbon dioxide CO2, NOVEC 1230, FM-200 and dry chemical powder extinguishers such as PKP and even baking soda are especially suited <b>to</b> <b>extinguishing</b> this sort of fire. PKP should be a last resort solution <b>to</b> <b>extinguishing</b> the fire due to its corrosive tendencies. Once electricity is shut off to the equipment involved, it will generally become an ordinary combustible fire.|$|R

The building's collapse left a gaping hole; of the hotel, the furniture store and the book store, almost nothing remained.|$|E

5|$|Shortly after 20:00, the {{trailing}} Swiftsure and Alexander, joined by Leander, attacked the French centre, causing severe damage to Franklin and killing Admiral Brueys on his quarterdeck with a cannon shot. At 21:00, a {{fire broke out}} in Orients stern, the blaze spread further by volleys from Swiftsure that also defeated efforts <b>to</b> <b>extinguish</b> it. The flames spread rapidly, racing up the masts and across the decks until the entire flagship was a blazing wreck. At 22:00, the vast magazines detonated, tearing the ship apart and hurling burning wreckage onto the neighbouring vessels. For ten minutes not a shot was fired, as the nearest ships battled <b>to</b> <b>extinguish</b> fires and the further ones paused in shock. The first ship to recommence hostilities was Franklin, but Admiral Blanquet's heavily outnumbered flagship was forced to surrender by 24:00. Tonnant, the only French ship still engaged, fought on against Majestic until 03:00, when the mortally wounded Captain Aristide Aubert Du Petit Thouars succeeded in dragging his ship to the temporary safety of the rear division under Rear-Admiral Pierre-Charles Villeneuve.|$|E

5|$|Before loading, {{the cannon}} would be cleaned {{with a wet}} sponge <b>to</b> <b>extinguish</b> any {{smouldering}} material from the last shot. Fresh powder could be set off prematurely by lingering ignition sources. The powder was added, followed by wadding of paper or hay, and the ball was placed in and rammed down. After ramming, the cannon would be aimed with the elevation set using a quadrant and a plummet. At 45 degrees, the ball had the utmost range: about ten times the gun's level range. Any angle above a horizontal line was called random-shot. Wet sponges were used to cool the pieces every ten or twelve rounds.|$|E
5|$|Historically, two {{breakers}} {{known as}} the Eddy Creek Shaft and the No. 2 Shaft were situated {{on the banks of}} Eddy Creek. In the late 1800s, a mine fire started in the No. 2 Shaft. As a last resort, water from Eddy Creek and the Lackawanna River were used in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>extinguish</b> it. Historically, there was a dam on the creek. The dam was owned by the Delaware and Hudson Company and was used for impounding water to flush ashes from a power plant. The creek also supplied water for a washery at the Underwood Colliery.|$|E

50|$|Golems have, {{apparently}} spontaneously, {{formed the}} Ankh-Morpork volunteer fire brigade: their volunteer operations are a moral contrast with previous human fire brigades who were paid commissions {{to put out}} fires and therefore attempted {{to ensure that there}} were fires for them to be paid for. When a fire is noted, all Golems abandon their current work (or return from wherever they go during their holy day) and converge onto the location. The Golems' approach <b>to</b> <b>extinguishing</b> a fire is to simply remove any burning or flammable materials from the building. Once the fire is isolated they stamp it out.|$|R

It does so, paradoxically, by drawing on the language of left-liberalism, which contrasts with recent ideological interventions aiming to secure the priorities of the neo-liberal state...|$|R

5|$|Seattle {{is one of}} {{the largest}} ports on the United States west coast and {{waterfront}} fires have been a continual concern for the city. Since 1891 the Seattle Fire Department has regularly operated at least two fireboats, which can be augmented by ships and small craft with fire suppression capabilities from the U.S. Coast Guard, Seattle Police, and neighboring municipalities. One of the worst maritime fires in the city's history occurred in 1968 when an electrical malfunction at Todd Shipyards sparked a fire that took 14 engine companies, two fireboats, two U.S. Coast Guard cutters, and several conscripted Foss Maritime tugboats more than half-a-day <b>to</b> <b>extinguish.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Remedy: {{personal}} or proprietary? The laws remedial response to unjust enrichment is particularly controversial. The historical core of unjust enrichment lies in quasi-contract. The quasi-contractual actions were common law claims which awarded a claimant the money {{value of the}} benefit received by the defendant. As the law has extended beyond such claims, unjust enrichment scholars have debated the scope of proprietary relief: that is, whether the court should recognise that (or declare that) the claimant has a beneficial or security interest in property held by the defendant (or a third party, {{as in the case}} of subrogation <b>to</b> <b>extinguished</b> rights).|$|R

50|$|In Philadelphia {{they have}} a custom which it would be {{pleasant}} to see adopted throughout the land.

In Philadelphia, the departure of a child is a circumstance which is not more surely followed by a burial than by the accustomed solacing poesy in the PUBLIC LEDGER.
