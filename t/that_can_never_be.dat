25|$|Although blind {{students}} {{have benefited from}} talking calculators, the abacus is still very often taught to these students in early grades, both in public schools and state schools for the blind. The abacus teaches mathematical skills <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> replaced with talking calculators and is an important learning tool for blind students. Blind students also complete mathematical assignments using a braille-writer and Nemeth code (a type of braille code for mathematics) but large multiplication and long division problems can be long and difficult. The abacus gives {{blind and visually impaired}} students a tool to compute mathematical problems that equals the speed and mathematical knowledge required by their sighted peers using pencil and paper. Many blind people find this number machine a very useful tool throughout life.|$|E
25|$|However, whilst the {{rationale}} behind the equation is sound, {{it is unlikely that}} the equation will be constrained to reasonable limits of error any time soon. The problem with the formula is that it is not usable to generate or support hypotheses because it contains factors <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> verified. The first term, R*, number of stars, is generally constrained within a few orders of magnitude. The second and third terms, fp, stars with planets and fe, planets with habitable conditions, are being evaluated for the star's neighborhood. Drake originally formulated the equation merely as an agenda for discussion at the Green Bank conference, but some applications of the formula had been taken literally and related to simplistic or pseudoscientific arguments. Another associated topic is the Fermi paradox, which suggests that if intelligent life is common in the universe, then there should be obvious signs of it.|$|E

The heroism was also claimed by Ireland: the Dublin Evening Telegraph's headline read [...] "South Pole Almost Reached By An Irishman", while the Dublin Express spoke of the [...] "qualities that were his heritage as an Irishman". Shackleton's fellow-explorers expressed their admiration; Roald Amundsen wrote, in a letter to RGS Secretary John Scott Keltie, that [...] "the English nation has by this deed of Shackleton's won a victory <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> surpassed". Fridtjof Nansen sent an effusive private letter to Emily Shackleton, praising the [...] "unique expedition which has been such a complete success in every respect". The reality was that the expedition had left Shackleton deeply in debt, unable to meet the financial guarantees he had given to backers. Despite his efforts, it required government action, {{in the form of a}} grant of £20,000 (2008: £1.5 million) to clear the most pressing obligations.

Blayney's 1769 version, with its revised spelling and punctuation, helped change the public perception of the Authorized Version to a masterpiece of the English language. By the 19th century, F. W.

Lee M. Hollander thought he was afraid he had committed the Eternal sin, one <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> forgiven. Kierkegaard called his gaining knowledge of his father's sin the [...] "great earthquake". Maybe he heard someone say that cursing God was the unforgivable sin or that fornication was the unforgivable sin. [...] Kierkegaard wrote out of concern for his father's anxiety and others like him who believe that God shuts his door against them. He asks, “How does a person get to know that he is the greatest sinner?” Kierkegaard started in Either/Or with two characters known only as A and B, both were in search of a self, and he worked himself up to The Concept of Anxiety where he remarked; [...] "If a person does not first make clear to himself the meaning of “self,” it is of no use to say of sin that it is selfishness."

2500|$|An {{empirical}} {{concept is}} the abstract {{thought of that}} which is common to several perceptions. [...] When an empirical concept is said to contain an object, whatever is thought in the concept must be intuited in the mental representation of the object. Examples of intuitive perceptions that are the content of empirical concepts are vague images that are imagined in order to connect a concept with the perceptions from which it was derived as their common feature. [...] "Intuitions," [...] Kant wrote, [...] "are always required to verify or demonstrate the reality of our concepts." [...] These examples ensure that [...] "our abstract thinking has not strayed far from the safe ground of perception, and has possibly become somewhat high-flown or even a mere idle display of words." [...] This is because [...] "concepts are quite impossible, and are utterly without meaning or signification, unless an object is given for the concepts themselves, or {{at least for the}} elements of which they consist." [...] For example, [...] "The concept of a dog signifies a rule according to which my imagination can trace, delineate, or draw a general outline, figure, or shape of a four-footed animal without being restricted to any single and particular shape supplied by experience." [...] In order to prevent the emptiness of [...] "thoughts without contents," [...] it is [...] "necessary to make our concepts sensible, i.e., to add an object of intuition to them." [...] In order to [...] test whether a concept is sensible, we sometimes [...] " [...] … go back to perception only tentatively and for the moment, by calling up in imagination a perception corresponding to the concept that occupies us at the moment, a perception <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> quite adequate to the (general) concept, but is a mere representative of it for the time being. … Kant calls a fleeting phantasm of this kind a schema." ...|$|E
