5|$|Throughout the 1890s, Tesla {{would pursue}} his ideas for {{wireless}} lighting and worldwide wireless electric power distribution in his high-voltage, high-frequency power experiments in New York and Colorado Springs. In 1893, he made pronouncements {{on the possibility}} of wireless communication with his devices. Tesla <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> these ideas to practical use in his unfinished Wardenclyffe Tower project, an intercontinental wireless communication and power transmitter, but ran out of funding before he could complete it.|$|E
5|$|When the LM voted {{narrowly}} in May 1976 {{to rejoin}} the Liberals (222 to 211), Millhouse immediately created the New LM, and became its only parliamentary representative. He <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> an optimistic view on the matter, saying that the close-run vote as an endorsement of his position, and the merger {{as an opportunity to}} start with a clean slate with no debt. The merger was finalised on 4 June when the Liberals' State Council voted heavily in favour.|$|E
5|$|Despite Arsenal being {{reduced to}} 10 men, the scores {{remained}} {{level as the}} game went into its final minute, when Diego Forlán went to ground in the penalty area under a challenge from Arsenal defender Martin Keown while trying to reach a Gary Neville cross. The referee deemed this a foul and awarded a penalty. Van Nistelrooy stepped up to take the penalty, despite having missed his previous two penalties for Manchester United. Lehmann <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> him off by moving {{from side to side}} along the goal line, and it appeared to work: the shot hit the bar and rebounded back into play, and the Dutchman was immediately confronted by Keown. Within a minute, the final whistle blew and the match finished as a goalless draw.|$|E

Brigadier General Nguyễn Khánh, {{at the time the}} Chief of Staff of the ARVN, climbed over the palace wall to reach Diệm during the siege. Khanh lived in the city center, close to the palace, and awoken by the gunfire, he drove towards the action. The {{plotters}} had <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> him under house arrest {{at the start of the}} coup, but were unaware that he moved house. Khanh proceeded to coordinate the loyalist defenders, along with Ky Quan Liem, the deputy director of the Civil Guard.|$|E
5|$|Dumouriez <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> the {{frontier}} fortresses {{in the hands}} of his adherents but failed. Miaczinski botched the attempted seizure of Lille and was later executed. Dumouriez believed that he could control the regular infantry and cavalry regiments. On the other hand, the volunteers and the artillery remained devoted to the National Convention. In one incident, Dumouriez was fired on and nearly arrested by Louis-Nicolas Davout's volunteer battalion. He then made the mistake of being seen with an Austrian escort and the gunners took the lead in refusing to obey him. Seeing that his plot had fallen apart, Dumouriez defected to the Austrians on 5 April 1793. He was accompanied by the Duke of Chartres, Valence, several more generals and some cavalry. No longer bound by the previous agreement, Coburg prepared to invade France.|$|E
5|$|During 1992 and 1993, an {{estimated}} 225,000 Croats, {{as well as}} refugees from Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia, settled in Croatia. Croatian volunteers and some conscripted soldiers participated {{in the war in}} Bosnia and Herzegovina. In September 1992, Croatia had accepted 335,985 refugees from Bosnia and Herzegovina, most of whom were Bosniak civilians (excluding men of drafting age). The large number of refugees significantly strained the Croatian economy and infrastructure. The American Ambassador to Croatia, Peter Galbraith, <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> the number of Muslim refugees in Croatia into a proper perspective in an interview on 8 November 1993. He said the situation would be the equivalent of the United States taking in 30,000,000 refugees.|$|E

5|$|Some of the Saka were {{enlisted in}} Phraates' forces against Antiochus. However, they arrived {{too late to}} engage in the conflict. When Phraates refused to pay their wages, the Saka revolted, which he <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> down with the aid of former Seleucid soldiers, yet they too {{abandoned}} Phraates and joined sides with the Saka. Phraates II marched against this combined force, but he was killed in battle. The Roman historian Justin reports that his successor Artabanus I of Parthia (r. c.128–124BC) shared a similar fate fighting nomads in the east. He claims Artabanus was killed by the Tokhari (identified as the Yuezhi), although Bivar believes Justin conflated them with the Saka. Mithridates II of Parthia (r. c.124–90BC) later recovered the lands lost to the Saka in Sistan.|$|E
5|$|This set {{the pattern}} for the six-year {{conflict}} between the Ottomans and Venice over control of Thessalonica. While the Ottomans blockaded and attacked Thessalonica from land, trying to starve it into surrender, the Republic sent repeated embassies to secure recognition of her possession of Thessalonica in exchange for an annual tribute. To back up their diplomatic efforts, the Venetians <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> pressure on the Sultan, by stirring up trouble along the Ottomans' periphery, sponsoring efforts for an anti-Ottoman Crusade, and sending their fleet to attack Gallipoli. The Ottomans likewise tried to distract Venice by launching raids of their own on Venetian possessions in the Aegean.|$|E
5|$|Von Neumann made {{fundamental}} {{contributions in}} exploration {{of problems in}} numerical hydrodynamics. For example, with Robert D. Richtmyer he developed an algorithm defining artificial viscosity that improved the understanding of shock waves. When computers solved hydrodynamic or aerodynamic problems, they <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> too many computational grid points at regions of sharp discontinuity (shock waves). The mathematics of artificial viscosity smoothed the shock transition without sacrificing basic physics. Other contributions to fluid dynamics included the classic flow solution to blast waves, and the co-discovery of the ZND detonation model of explosives. During the 1930s, Von Neumann became an authority on the mathematics of shaped charges.|$|E

5|$|Blythe, who is nearsighted, {{took off}} his glasses before {{entering}} the stage, which together with the smoke and light effects allegedly left him half-blind. Blythe said that people could easily reach the band members or climb up to the stage. One of the fans, who was identified as Milan Pořádek by Czech newspapers, and who was scheduled to testify later during the proceedings, managed to climb the stage twice without being stopped by security. Blythe testified that during the first attempt, Pořádek rushed the stage and started waving his arms before stage diving. The second time, he <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> his arms around Blythe {{in an attempt to}} hug him. Blythe, who according to his own words perceived this as a danger, caught Pořádek's collar, pushed him on the ground, knelt on him and repeatedly told him to stop. He then led the fan by his hair {{to the edge of the}} stage, where the fan jumped off. It was only after watching a video of the incident that Blythe found out that a security officer was actually pushing the fan from back. Blythe further said that he saw Pořádek trying to reach the stage yet again before finally being stopped by security.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} was next, {{featuring}} The Undertaker versus Yokozuna in a casket match with Chuck Norris as the special outside referee. The Undertaker gained the early advantage, but Yokozuna reversed the momentum with a Samoan drop. He <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> The Undertaker in the casket, but The Undertaker fought back. Yokozuna next performed a leg drop and placed The Undertaker in the casket. Before Yokozuna could close the lid, however, The Undertaker attacked {{him and the}} two wrestlers fought while standing in the casket. The Undertaker performed a clothesline from the top rope and placed Yokozuna in the casket. King Kong Bundy and Bam Bam Bigelow came down the aisle toward the ring, but Chuck Norris blocked their path. While Norris was distracted, however, Irwin R. Schyster entered the ring {{from the other side}} and attacked The Undertaker. He placed The Undertaker in the casket, but The Undertaker recovered before Yokozuna could close the lid. Jeff Jarrett tried to interfere on Yokozuna's behalf, but Norris stopped him with a superkick. The Undertaker performed a DDT and a big boot on Yokozuna. He then rolled his opponent in to the casket and closed the lid to gain the victory.|$|E
5|$|Local Czech militants forced about 5,000 local Poles, {{mostly from}} the {{northern}} part of the region, to flee to Poland already before July 1920. 4,000 of these expellees were located in a transitional camps in Oświęcim. About 12,000 Poles in total were forced to leave the region and flee to Poland in the aftermath of the division of Cieszyn Silesia. The local Polish population felt that Warsaw had betrayed them and they were not satisfied with the division. It is not quite clear how many Poles were in Zaolzie in Czechoslovakia. Estimates range from 110,000 to 140,000 people in 1921. The 1921 and 1930 census numbers are not accurate since nationality depended on self-declaration and many Poles declared Czech nationality mainly as a result of fear of the new authorities and as compensation for some benefits. Czechoslovak law guaranteed rights for national minorities, but the reality in Zaolzie was quite different. The local Czech authorities made it more difficult for local Poles to obtain citizenship, while the process was expedited when the applicant pledged to declare Czech nationality and send his children to a Czech school. Newly built Czech schools were often better supported and equipped, thus inducing some Poles to send their children there. This and other factors contributed to the assimilation of Poles and also to significant emigration to Poland. After a few years, the heightened nationalism typical of the period around 1920 receded and local Poles increasingly co-operated with the Czechs. Still, Czechization was supported by Prague, which did not abide by certain laws related to language, legislative, and organizational issues. Polish deputies in Czechoslovak National Assembly frequently <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> that issues on agenda. One way or the other, increasingly local Poles thus assimilated into the Czech population.|$|E
