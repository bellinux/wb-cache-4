500|$|Although {{generally}} {{respected by}} London society, the longer Lambert remained there, the more irritable he became. Shy and self-conscious, he was annoyed at repeatedly being {{asked about the}} size of his clothes. [...] In answer to one request, to a woman who enquired as to the cost of his coat, he replied [...] "I cannot pretend to charge my memory with the price, but I can put you into a method of obtaining <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>you</b> want. If you think proper to make me a present of a new coat, you will then know exactly what it costs". [...] Another interested spectator claimed that since his entrance fee was paying for Lambert's clothing, he had the right to know about it; Lambert replied [...] "Sir, if I knew what part of my next coat your shilling would pay for, I can assure you I would cut out the piece". Lambert calculated in 1806 that a full suit of clothes cost him £20, about £ as of [...]|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with author Cicily Janus, Joseph commented that his perspective has changed {{a great deal from}} when he was younger. [...] He said, [...] "Everything I did was focused on making good music and being a great musician, not running a business. Yet it takes a businessperson to bring music to the masses." [...] But some artists just want to [...] be involved in the music and do not like the added problems or have the personality to work with both. [...] Joseph suggests newer artists read and study both courses and pick one that best suits their needs and wants. [...] He advises, [...] "...to keep your eyes and ears open all the time. [...] All <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>you</b> need is available to you to have a successful career in music, if you're paying attention, and not closed off to anything." [...] He explains, [...] "Time and persistence has shown me that I can succeed at sharing my art with others as a musician while running my own music business. [...] And that kind of success is as good as I could have ever wished for." ...|$|E

2500|$|Some {{people may}} be better [...] "lie detectors" [...] than others, better able to {{distinguish}} a lie by facial expression, cadence of speech, certain movements, consistency, and other methods. According to David J. Lieberman, PhD, in Never Be Lied to Again: How to Get the Truth in Five Minutes or Less in Any Conversation or Situation, these methods can be learned. Some methods of questioning {{may be more likely}} to elicit the truth, for instance: [...] "When was the last time you smoked marijuana?" [...] (a leading question) is more likely to get a truthful answer than [...] "Do you smoke pot?" [...] Asking the question most likely to get <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>you</b> want is a skill and can be learned. Avoiding vague questioning will help avoid lies of omission or vagueness.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the inauguration}} of Benjamin Harrison in 1888, Royal Johnson was reappointed Surveyor General for Arizona Territory in July 1889.

In September 1889, he sent Johnson a letter directing the Surveyor General to [...] "please report to me the exact condition of said grant as shown by papers and records in your office, and all <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>you</b> can obtain in regard to it." [...] Johnson responded to this request on October 12, 1889 with the release of Adverse report of the Surveyor General of Arizona, Royal A.

One unnamed U.S. official present during the early briefings said, [...] "In fairness, the environment was different then because we were closer to September 11 and people were still in a panic.

Clarke accurately predicted many things that became reality, including online banking, online shopping, and other now commonplace things. Responding {{to a question about}} how the interviewer's son's life would be different, Clarke responded: [...] "He will have, in his own house, not a computer as big as this, , but at least, a console through which he can talk, through his local computer and get all the information he needs, for his everyday life, like his bank statements, his theatre reservations, all <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>you</b> need in the course of living in our complex modern society, this will be in a compact form in his own house... and he will take it as much for granted as we take the telephone." ...|$|E
