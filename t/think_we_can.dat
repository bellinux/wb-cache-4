500|$|McCartney and Ono had {{attempted}} to purchase the catalogue in 1981. They were offered the catalogue for £20million ($40million USD) and proposed the pair would each pay £10million. Ono refused as {{she thought it was}} too high a price. McCartney spoke about the offer at a press conference in April 1990, explaining that Ono [...] "actually said 'I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> get it for 5.' So I said, 'Well ok, you know, let's see what we can do.' And we couldn't." ...|$|E

Benitez was {{confident}} that his Liverpool team would be capable of beating São Paulo: [...] "We are playing with confidence and strength. I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> beat anyone." [...] Liverpool Striker Crouch who scored twice in the semi-final was as adamant as his manager about winning the competition.

There are lots of places in Portland that could use some beautification, and a little public art {{can go a long}} way." [...] Spencer and a colleague compiled a gallery of images created using Adobe Photoshop to illustrate the sculpture's potential.|$|E

[...] Mayor Naheed Nenshi subsequently proposed a partnership wherein portions of the cost of [...] "plan B" [...] would be covered by the city, and the rest covered by the team ownership and user surcharges.

500|$|Negative {{societal}} {{attitudes and}} stereotypes about {{people with disabilities}} like SCI affect interpersonal interactions and self-image, with important implications for quality of life. In fact, for women, psychological factors have a more important impact on sexual adjustment and activity than physical ones. Negative attitudes about disability (along with relationships and social support) are more predictive of outcome than even the level or completeness of injury. Stereotypes exist that people with SCI (particularly women) are uninterested in, unsuitable for, or incapable of sexual relationships or encounters. [...] "People <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> only date people in wheelchairs, that we're lucky to get any guy, that we can't be picky", remarked Mia Schaikewitz, who is profiled [...] in Push Girls, a 2012 reality series about four women with SCI.|$|E
500|$|In March 2011, Gorham told Billboard.com that Thin Lizzy may {{record a}} new album in the future, saying, [...] "That's the No.1 {{question}} we're getting from people – are we gonna record some new material? The fans seem to trust this line-up, and I don't blame them. We've kind of jumped this emotional hurdle together. Ricky's writing some fucking killer lyrics, and {{with the kind of}} talent that's in Thin Lizzy now I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> pull off a really cool set of tunes. At least it's something that we can think about now, where before it wasn't on the table." [...] On 25 June 2012, Thin Lizzy were in the studio recording new material, although it was not clear how many songs would be recorded or released.|$|E

500|$|... "Get Sexy" [...] {{features}} an interpolation of Right Said Fred's song [...] "I'm Too Sexy", which was composed by Christopher Fairbrass, Richard Fairbrass, and Robert Manzoli. It samples the trademark lyric, [...] "I'm too sexy for my shirt, too sexy for my shirt, so sexy it hurts", but replaces [...] "for my shirt" [...] with [...] "in this club". According to Digital Spy, {{in an interview}} with Teletext, Buchanan revealed that inspiration for the song came [...] "by accident", saying: [...] "The producers were messing around going, 'I'm too sexy for the studio'. We were like, 'That sounds cool', and [...] said, 'You remember that Right Said Fred song?' We were like, 'Do you <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> do it?' By accident it came together." [...] Balls and Levine compared the song to [...] "Boom Boom Pow" [...] by Black Eyed Peas.|$|E
500|$|Grey's Anatomy used a color-blind casting technique, {{resulting}} in a racially diverse ensemble. Each role was cast without the character's races being pre-determined, keeping Rhimes' vision of diversity. The production staff began casting with the program's title character, Meredith Grey, which Rhimes stated was a difficult role to cast. [...] "I kept saying we need a girl like that girl from Moonlight Mile," [...] said Rhimes, [...] "and after a while, they were like, 'We <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> get that girl from Moonlight Mile." [...] The next to be cast, Sandra Oh (Dr. Cristina Yang), was initially invited to audition for the character of Bailey, but pressed to read {{for the role of}} Cristina instead. Many actors read for the role of Dr. Derek Shepherd, but when Patrick Dempsey read for the part, [...] "he was just perfect", according to Rhimes.|$|E
500|$|A {{hearing was}} held before Ashbrook's {{committee}} on January 13. [...] Originally, the bill called for mintage of 100,000 silver dollars in commemoration of McKinley, {{but at the}} hearing, Butler requested that they be gold instead, stating, [...] "if you will recall the fact, McKinley was elected in 1896 mainly {{on the question of}} the gold standard." [...] The gold dollar had not been struck as a circulating coin since 1889. [...] Asked a question from New York Congressman James W. Husted as to whether a gold dollar would be too small to be a souvenir, Butler responded, [...] "No; I do not think so. I think, on the other hand, a silver dollar might be too large. I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> dispose of gold dollars very much easier. Mr. Husted, and you know gold dollars are rather scarce just now." [...] Ashbrook agreed, and stated: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is no {{immediate}} danger," [...] said he. [...] "We must have struck {{some sort of}} wreckage, or lumber float. There is a small hole in the bow, just above the water line, {{and several of the}} seams have been opened. Captain Barforth is having the hole closed up and has started up the donkey pump to keep the water low in the hold. He says he <b>thinks</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> make one of the nearby ports without great trouble." ...|$|R

500|$|The {{success of}} Just Dance {{led to the}} {{development}} of a sequel, Just Dance 2, which focused on adding new features and refinements to the game—such as improvements to its motion tracking system, new game modes, and support for downloadable content. Sales of Just Dance 2 surpassed that of the original; with over 5 million copies as of January 2011, it was the best-selling third-party title for the Wii. Laurent Detoc, CEO of Ubisoft's North American operations, stated that this achievement [...] " [...] the Just Dance brand as a pop culture phenomenon." [...] Poix felt that [...] "there's a pressure within Ubisoft to keep Just Dance enormous, and we <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> make it enormous. But it wasn't like that initially, because at the end of the first one, people—even us—had our doubts that it would last. After the first one we thought maybe there would be a second one, and then it would be over." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Worlds Apart" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} television critics. Entertainment Weekly writer Jeff Jensen noted {{that with the}} closing of the bridge, [...] "Fringe effectively pulled the plug on the creative idea that defined the best years of the show. [...] I don't <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> understate the passing of the parallel world premise." [...] While he said he would miss the lost characters, especially Fauxlivia, the series [...] "got the emotions [...] just right." [...] He added his hope that the characters would be revisited. In an interview, Pinckner said that they had spoken to Fox executives about closing off the bridge, to which one executive partner reportedly said, [...] "I was so sad. [...] I had tears in my eyes when we closed the door". The executive added that despite having initially thought the idea of doppelganger characters as a poor one, she admitted that she [...] "was so wrong".|$|E
500|$|Pompeo {{discovered}} Grey's Anatomy {{after an}} extended period of doing nothing in the acting profession. [...] Her agent suggested she audition amongst other projects. [...] While casting actresses for the part of Meredith Grey, series' creator Shonda Rhimes said: [...] "I kept saying we need a girl like that girl from Moonlight Mile, and after a while, they were like, 'We <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> get that girl from Moonlight Mile.' I spent time with her and got to know her, and then we started casting for the men." [...] She reported that Grey was not an easy role to cast because of the strong verbal possibilities. [...] Rhimes was informed that the actress in question was Pompeo, who had a deal in place with ABC, having previously tested for a pilot show on the network. It has been speculated that Pompeo was the first character to be cast, but when asked, she said she did not know of this. When asked of how she created Pompeo's character, Rhimes said: ...|$|E

500|$|Brewer told a Channel 5 website writer {{that the}} rain was the biggest {{challenge}} of the night shoot, as it was [...] "beyond freezing". She also revealed that she ran in shoes {{that she had not}} broken in and they made her feet bleed. The actress added [...] "It was incredibly stressful but I guess it was stress in a good way. There were months of preparation involved so that it could run like clockwork. So I guess it was stressful in the sense the emotional stakes were heightened for a two-week period. It was exhausting and I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> all say we were happy once it was over. But the final result was worth it." [...] McGregor filmed his final scene out of sequence at the Melbourne studios. He explained that they had already shot Mark's last scene on location, then went back inside to do the studio shots. He revealed [...] "The final thing I filmed was a conversation between Mark and Kyle, where they're saying goodbye. It was a bit sad, but it was basically just these two guys hugging each other – with the cast and crew watching!" ...|$|E
500|$|Partly in {{reaction}} to such theories, another school of thought emerged which argued that Arthur had no historical existence at all. Morris's Age of Arthur prompted the archaeologist Nowell Myres to observe that [...] "no figure on the borderline of history and mythology has wasted more of the historian's time". Gildas' 6th-century polemic De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae (On the Ruin and Conquest of Britain), written within living memory of Badon, mentions the battle but does not mention Arthur. Arthur is {{not mentioned in the}} Anglo-Saxon Chronicle or named in any surviving manuscript written between 400 and 820. He is absent from Bede's early-8th-century Ecclesiastical History of the English People, another major early source for post-Roman history that mentions Badon. The historian David Dumville has written: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> dispose of him [...] quite briefly. He owes his place in our history books to a 'no smoke without fire' school of thought... The {{fact of the matter is}} that there is no historical evidence about Arthur; we must reject him from our histories and, above all, from the titles of our books." ...|$|E
500|$|Susan and Karl were {{childhood}} sweethearts {{who married}} in 1978, before they both graduated from university. Karl has cheated on Susan twice with Sarah Beaumont (Nicola Charles) and Izzy Hoyland (Natalie Bassingthwaighte) {{and the couple}} have broken up and divorced, but have later reunited and remarried. Woodburne has named the Karl, Susan and Izzy love triangle {{as one of her}} favourite storylines. Woodburne believes that Karl and Susan have a strong connection that is [...] "based upon such a good grounding". Karl and Susan are best friends who enjoy each other's company, share a deep connection and take joy in each other's quirks and ways. Woodburne described them as having a [...] "really solid foundation for a marriage" [...] and she has said that she does not want to see Susan and Karl's relationship break up again. Holy Soap have called Susan and Karl [...] "contenders for the friskiest couple on Ramsay Street". Following their [...] "passionate arguments", the couple enjoy making up together. They have a healthy attraction for each other. Fletcher says he and Woodburne find the scenes [...] "funny". Fletcher said [...] "Karl and Susan every now and again do go through a phase where they become slightly more amorous than in their tougher times and tougher storylines – suffice to say it's not bawdy, but I think the audience will enjoy the fun aspect". Karl and Susan have been caught in the nude together on three occasions; at the beach, in Lou Carpenter's (Tom Oliver) spa and when they went skinny-dipping in the bush. When asked what makes Karl and Susan popular with viewers, Woodburne said [...] "Because I think they're so flawed. There's two things: they make horrendous mistakes, both of them, but they both are coming from a place of well meaning. They're both wanting to try and {{do the right thing and}} be helpful, but so often they get it so terribly wrong, and I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> all relate to that." ...|$|E
