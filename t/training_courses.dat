5|$|Despite the dissatisfaction {{of the men}} in the SWPA, the {{demobilisation}} and repatriation process generally proceeded smoothly. Most men {{had been}} returned to Australia by January 1946 and 80 percent were demobilised by the middle of the year. Before leaving the military service men and women attended either a dispersal centre or naval depot where they were provided with a medical examination, interviewed by a rehabilitation officer and provided with information about the benefits they were eligible for. The Manpower Directorate was then responsible for placing discharged personnel in employment as well as providing them with identity documentation and ration entitlements. <b>Training</b> <b>courses</b> were made available to veterans, and by 1951 94,000 had completed university, technical or rural <b>training</b> <b>courses</b> and 39,000 were still in training.

40|$|The {{production}} {{processes of the}} petrochemical industry expose workers to high potential hazards. Our previous study showed that hazard recognition was closely related to worker safety and health training activities. The {{purpose of this study}} was to establish and validate a safety and health training model. It is expected that the training model will help workers to recognize hazards, thereby lowering their operating risks. The training model, which included a complete <b>training</b> <b>course</b> and follow-up scoring using a questionnaire, was applied to three groups of subjects for comparison. Group A had joined our study previously and took the <b>training</b> <b>course</b> again at this time. Group B had also joined our previous study but did not take this <b>training</b> <b>course.</b> Group C was new to our study and took this <b>training</b> <b>course</b> for the first time.

5|$|In 1944, Johns became commandant of the Engineer School at Fort Belvoir. The wartime Engineer School was {{responsible}} for the training of officers. Some were engineers in civilian life who were trained as officers; other were officers transferred from other arms who were given training in engineering subjects. The Officer Candidate School (OCS) prepared enlisted men for commissioning as officers. There had been strong criticism of the content of <b>training</b> <b>courses</b> from SWPA, where it was the norm for machinery to be operated around the clock and for engineer officers to supervise all manner of construction tasks. The commanders there felt that the <b>training</b> <b>courses</b> taught by the Engineer School were concentrating too much on leadership in combat, and not enough on technical matters, such the operation and maintenance of construction equipment. Johns reformed the curriculum, but by this time {{it was too late for}} the changes to have much effect in the overseas theaters of operations. For his work at Fort Belvoir, Johns was awarded the Legion of Merit.|$|E
