5|$|Glover {{believes}} Martha influenced Lionel {{to start}} believing that sacrifice is necessary <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>a</b> better place. When she leaves {{at the end}} of season six, Lionel no longer has that influence. He is constantly battling the dark and light sides of his personality. According to series writer Caroline Dries, the audience never really know his motivations because of this balancing act. Dries said this is embodied when he threatens Lana into marrying Lex, later revealing it was to protect Clark. Glover describes his off-screen relationship with Annette O'Toole the reason Martha and Lionel have such good chemistry. Glover said that when Martha and Lionel are talking to each other it feels as though he and O'Toole are sharing a conversation, and that trust is visualized on the camera.|$|E
