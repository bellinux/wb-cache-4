5|$|After Al-Rasheed was {{promoted}} to the top division, most of Iraq's national team players signed for them, which {{made it difficult for}} the other teams to compete. Even so, in the 1985–86 Iraqi National League and under the management of Yahya Alwan, Al-Talaba won their third league title against all expectations. They finished the season with 25 points, two points ahead of the favourites Al-Rasheed. On 27 December 1985, {{one of the most important}} matches of the season, which could have decided the championship, was played between Al-Talaba and Al-Rasheed in front of 50,000 spectators at the Al-Shaab Stadium. The match ended in a 1–0 win for Al-Talaba with the goal being from a penalty taken by Hussein Saeed in the 63rd minute. Saeed was the season's joint top goalscorer along with Ahmed Radhi and Rahim Hameed. Al-Talaba participated in the 1986 Asian Club Championship where they reached the final round but finished last in the table with a single point. Al-Talaba also participated in <b>the</b> <b>Saddam</b> International Tournament in 1986, hosted in Baghdad, but finished third in their group and failed to reach the semi-finals. By winning the league, Al-Talaba qualified for the 1986 Al-Muthabara Cup but were defeated 2–1 by Al-Rasheed.|$|E

The information he provided to his interrogators formed a fundamental part of the Bush administration case for attacking Iraq, alleging links between Al Qaeda and Iraq.

In 2008, Radhi requested that the party be allowed to function inside Iraq and join the process of reconciliation. In response, the Iraqi government declared that they viewed Qotr al-Iraq as distinct from Saddam's Ba'ath, as Qotr al-Iraq had participated in the opposition conferences during <b>the</b> <b>Saddam</b> years. , the Iraqi regional organization is still based in Syria.|$|E
25|$|The University of Al-Qadisiyah was {{established}} on the 23rd of December, 1987 through a resolution (no. 159) {{passed by the}} Revolutionary Command Council of <b>the</b> <b>Saddam</b> era. The resolution ordered the establishment of four universities; the University of Al-Qadisiyah, the University of Kufa, the University of Tikrit, and the University of Anbar. Originally, the University of Al-Qadisiyah began with two colleges; the College of Education and the College of Business and Administration.

25|$|There {{was great}} hope that <b>the</b> <b>Saddam's</b> regime {{would not be}} able to quell this {{rebellion}} without air power, which was blocked by the coalition forces as a condition of Gulf War ceasefire. However, U.S. forces did not prevent Saddam from using overwhelming force to suppress the uprising.

After the fall of <b>the</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein government in 2003, the Islamic Party has reemerged {{as one of the}} main advocates of the country's Sunni community. The Islamic Party has been sharply critical of the U.S.-led occupation of Iraq, but still participates in the political process nevertheless. Its leader is Iraqi Vice-President Tariq Al-Hashimi.|$|E
25|$|On 23 March, {{a convoy}} from the 3rd Infantry Division, {{including}} the female American soldiers Jessica Lynch, Shoshana Johnson, and Lori Piestewa, was ambushed {{after taking a}} wrong turn into the city. Eleven U.S. soldiers were killed, and seven, including Lynch and Piestewa, were captured. Piestewa died of wounds shortly after capture, while the remaining five prisoners of war were later rescued. Piestewa, who was from Tuba City, Arizona, and an enrolled member of the Hopi Tribe, was {{believed to have been}} the first Native American woman killed in combat in a foreign war. On the same day, U.S Marines from the Second Marine Division entered Nasiriyah in force, facing heavy resistance as they moved to secure two major bridges in the city. Several Marines were killed during a firefight with Fedayeen in the urban fighting. At <b>the</b> <b>Saddam</b> Canal, another 18 Marines were killed in heavy fighting with Iraqi soldiers. An Air Force A-10 was involved in a case of friendly fire that resulted in the death of six Marines when it accidentally attacked an American amphibious vehicle. Two other vehicles were destroyed when a barrage of RPG and small arms fire killed most of the Marines inside. A Marine from Marine Air Control Group 28 was killed by enemy fire, and two Marine engineers drowned in <b>the</b> <b>Saddam</b> Canal. The bridges were secured and the Second Marine division set up a perimeter around the city.|$|E

25|$|This wave {{began at}} the end of the 1980s after the Revolutions of 1989. Its main theme was the hope that civil society, not {{enlightenment}} or revolution would pave the way for democracy in the Arab world. Civil society was seen as essential for emergence of democracy and that once a strong civil society developed, democracy was sure to follow. It was hoped that democracy would be achieved by the end of 1990s or early twenty-first century at most. <b>The</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein-ordered Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990 and the subsequent Gulf War have formed a strong reaction against tyranny, which was seen as the main cause of the crisis. It also weakened authoritarian regimes and gave civil society more space to maneuver. The number of non-governmental organizations in the Arab world jumped from less than 20,000 in the mid-1960s to over 70,000 in the late 1980s to 300,000 in 2008. Despite all of these developments, there was no significant democratic change in any Arab state throughout this period.|$|E
500|$|After World War II, the French Committee of National Liberation {{was late}} to be {{recognized}} by the US as the government of France, and so the country was initially excluded from the conferences that created the new organization. The future French president Charles de Gaulle criticized the UN, famously calling it a machin ("contraption"), and was not convinced that a global security alliance would help maintain world peace, preferring direct defence treaties between countries. Throughout the Cold War, both the US and USSR repeatedly accused the UN of favouring the other. In 1953, the USSR effectively forced the resignation of Trygve Lie, the Secretary-General, through its refusal to deal with him, while in the 1950s and 1960s, a popular US bumper sticker read, [...] "You can't spell communism without U.N." [...] In a sometimes-misquoted statement, President George W. Bush stated in February 2003 (referring to UN uncertainty towards Iraqi provocations under <b>the</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein regime) that [...] "free nations will not allow the UN to fade into history as an ineffective, irrelevant debating society." [...] In contrast, the French President, François Hollande, stated in 2012 that [...] "France trusts the United Nations. She knows that no state, no matter how powerful, can solve urgent problems, fight for development and {{bring an end to}} all crises... France wants the UN to be the centre of global governance." [...] Critics such as Dore Gold, an Israeli diplomat, Robert S. Wistrich, a British scholar, Alan Dershowitz, an American legal scholar, Mark Dreyfus, an Australian politician, and the Anti-Defamation League consider UN attention to Israel's treatment of Palestinians to be excessive.
