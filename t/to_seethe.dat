His armies also destroyed several important Sunni sites, including the tombs of Abū Ḥanīfa and Abdul-Qadir Gilani. The Safavids even expelled the family of Gilani from Mesopotamia. After declaring Shiism the official form of Islam in Iraq, Ismail forced his new Iraqi subjects to convert to Shiism and outlawed Sunni practices. He then returned to Persia. These draconian actions by the conquering Safavids caused the Mesopotamian Sunnis <b>to</b> <b>seethe</b> with resentment.|$|E
25|$|After {{hearing about}} the incident, the Douglas County sheriff Samuel L. Jones journeyed to Hickory Point to investigate. Jones was a pro-slavery {{advocate}} and so he let Coleman go free while he arrested Dow's affiliate, Jacob Branson, for disturbing the peace. Branson, however, was eventually rescued by Free-Staters, causing the pro-slavery faction <b>to</b> <b>seethe</b> with anger. Within a matter of days, {{the governor of the}} Kansas Territory, Wilson Shannon, called for the Kansas militia to settle the issue, but this resulted in a small army of 1,500 Missourians entering Kansas. The group, led by Jones, made their way to Lawrence, prepared to eradicate the free-staters. Meanwhile, the citizens of Lawrence, bracing for the impending battle, raised up a militia of 800 men. Dr. Charles Robinson was commander-in-chief of the city's troops, and the future state senator James Lane was appointed as his second-in-command. The citizens of Lawrence were also aided by the abolitionist John Brown and his sons. However, the Missourians never attacked, and the Lawrencians and the Missourians were encouraged by the governor to sign a peace treaty. Such an agreement was finally made in December of 1855, and eventually the Missouri army reluctantly left the area.|$|E

500|$|Lord of Scoundrels is {{typically}} {{classified as a}} Regency romance novel, though its story {{is set in the}} post-Regency era of 1828. It features a strong female heroine, a characteristic that Chase has become known for including in her romances. The author explains that [...] "for most of history, and in too many cases today, women are considered (and too often consider themselves) lesser beings who do not matter. In my books, the women are not lesser, and they do matter. In other words, I make the world the way I think it should be". Romantic fiction scholars have identified Jessica Trent as a [...] "feminist heroine" [...] with whom the [...] "alpha male hero" [...] has met his match. Chase inverts many qualities typical of the archetypical romantic hero and heroine. Near the end of the story, Jessica is the one who initiates consummation of their marriage, by seducing Dain. Afterwards, Jessica promptly falls asleep, causing her husband <b>to</b> <b>seethe</b> [...] "that was what he was supposed to do".|$|E

The alliance was defeated, obtaining only 15 seats in Chamber; a full merger {{between the two parties}} was not attempted, with the Conservatives noting that they [...] "needed no such grafting." [...] By January 1880, with most of the Moderate Liberals absorbed into the PNL, Ionescu and some who had debuted with the Faction, including Ștefan Șendrea, joined Vernescu's own Sincere Liberal Party, which sought to reclaim the middle-class vote. Ionescu was for a while a member of the Central Committee of that party, which was sometimes referred to as the [...] "Vernescu-Ionescu liberal faction". According <b>to</b> <b>seething</b> diary entries by Domnitor Carol, in 1881 Catargiu, Vernescu and Ionescu had formed [...] "something like a party", and were filibustering in Chamber against PNL laws.|$|R

It was fortunate for Croghan that he did not meet with the formidable chieftain while in this exasperated mood. He subsequently encountered him when Pontiac's spirits were broken by reverses.

60|$|His success, modest {{though it}} were, {{had been too}} simple.

Yes, Bremerton had been for him (he realized {{now that he had}} left it) as near an approach to Arcadia as this life permits, and the very mountains by which it was encircled had seemed effectively to shut out those monster problems which had set the modern world outside <b>to</b> <b>seething.</b> Gerald Whitely's thousand operatives had never struck; the New York newspapers, the magazines that discussed with vivid animus the corporation-political problems in other states, had found Bremerton interested, but unmoved; and Mrs. Whitely, who was a trustee of the library, wasted her energy in deploring the recent volumes on economics, sociology, philosophy, and religion that were placed on the shelves. If Bremerton read them--and a portion of Bremerton did--no difference was apparent in the attendance at Hodder's church. The Woman's Club discussed them strenuously, but made no attempt to put their doctrines into practice.|$|R
60|$|He {{approached}} the evil-smelling pot, and stirred {{it up with}} a face which indicated so much anxiety that {{it was clear that he}} had pushed his courtesy to us so far as to risk the ruin of some important experiment. Dipping his ladle into the compound, he scooped some up, and then poured it slowly back into the vessel, showing a yellow turbid fluid. The appearance of it evidently reassured him, for the look of anxiety cleared away from his features, and he uttered an exclamation of relief. Taking a handful of a whitish powder from a trencher at his side he threw it into the pipkin, the contents of which began immediately <b>to</b> <b>seethe</b> and froth over into the fire, causing the flames to assume the strange greenish hue which we had observed before entering. This treatment had the effect of clearing the fluid, for the chemist was enabled to pour off into a bottle a quantity of perfectly watery transparent liquid, while a brownish sediment remained in the vessel, and was emptied out upon a sheet of paper. This done, Sir Jacob Clancing pushed aside all his bottles, and turned towards us with a smiling face and a lighter air.|$|E

6000|$|For {{two days}} the young monk held on, {{paddling}} and floating rapidly down the Nile-stream, leaving city after city to {{right and left}} with longing eyes, and looking back to one villa after another, till the reaches of the banks hid them from his sight, with many a yearning to know what sort of places those gay buildings and gardens would look like on a nearer view, {{and what sort of}} life the thousands led who crowded the busy quays, and walked and drove, in an endless stream, along the great highroads which ran along either bank. He carefully avoided every boat that passed him, from the gilded barge of the wealthy landlord or merchant, to the tiny raft buoyed up with empty jars, which was floating down to be sold at some market in the Delta. Here and there he met and hailed a crew of monks, drawing their nets in a quiet bay, or passing along the great watery highway from monastery to monastery: but all the news he received from them was, that the canal of Alexandria was still several days' journey below him. It seemed endless, that monotonous vista of the two high clay banks, with their sluices and water-wheels, their knots of palms and date-trees; endless seemed that wearisome succession of bars of sand and banks of mud, every one like the one before it, every one dotted with the same line of logs and stones strewn along the water's edge, which turned out as he approached them to be basking crocodiles and sleeping pelicans. His eye, wearied with the continual confinement and want of distance, longed for the boundless expanse of the desert, for the jagged outlines of those far-off hills, which he had watched from boyhood rising mysteriously at morn out of the eastern sky, and melting mysteriously into it again at even, beyond which dwelt a whole world of wonders, elephants and dragons, satyrs and anthropophagi,--ay, and the phoenix itself. Tired and melancholy, his mind returned inward to prey on itself, and the last words of Arsenius rose again and again to his thoughts. 'Was his call of the spirit or of the flesh?' How should he test that problem? He wished <b>to</b> <b>seethe</b> world that might be carnal. True; but, he wished to convert the world.... was not that spiritual? Was he not going on a noble errand?.... thirsting for toil, for saintship, for martyrdom itself, if it would but come and cut the Gordian knot of all temptations, and save him-for he dimly felt that it would save him--a whole sea of trouble in getting safe and triumphant out of that world into which he had not yet entered .... and his heart shrank back from the untried homeless wilderness before him. But no! the die was cast, and he must down and onward, whether in obedience to the spirit or the flesh. Oh, for one hour of the quiet of that dear Laura and the old familiar faces! ...|$|E
