The general agreed, and Dealey was posthumously awarded the medal.|$|E
5|$|During the campaign, Kemp's {{endorsement}} {{was highly}} coveted. Forbes {{had tried to}} get Kemp {{to run in the}} 1996 campaign, but Kemp declined and in fact endorsed Forbes just as Dole was closing in on the nomination, and just after Dole gained the endorsements of former contenders Lamar Alexander and Richard Lugar. Some feel the primary reason for <b>the</b> <b>endorsement</b> was to keep the flat tax idea and other supply-side views alive. Many thought Kemp had destroyed his own political future with <b>the</b> <b>endorsement,</b> and Kemp profusely apologized to Dole's campaign offices. After it became clear Dole would be the nominee, Kemp attempted to form a bipartisan seminar with Felix Rohatyn to produce a fiscal plan that could be endorsed by both parties.|$|E

5|$|On June 30, Goldwater {{received}} <b>the</b> <b>endorsement</b> {{of moderate}} Senator Everett Dirksen of Illinois after {{traveling to the}} Midwest to gain delegates. Dirksen's support further deflated the Stop Goldwater movement, as the Senator had criticized Goldwater's earlier vote against the Civil Rights Act, but concluded upon further review {{that he was only}} being consistent with his views. Richard Nixon followed suit and endorsed Goldwater two days later.|$|E
5|$|Reitz's {{policies}} were appreciated by the Volksraad, reflecting {{the change in}} the mood of the Afrikaner electorate towards Afrikaner nationalism. Months before the presidential election of 1893 the Volksraad endorsed Reitz's candidature with a vote of forty-three against eighteen. Reitz accepted <b>the</b> <b>endorsement</b> on the condition that he be allowed three months leave to Europe. On 22 November 1893 he was re-elected, again with a landslide majority.|$|E

5|$|An {{alternative}} {{view is that}} it is not {{the formal}} structure of the Council – which in theory is capable of exercising judicial, legislative and review functions – but the presence of a practically single-party Parliament that drastically undermines the PCMR's powers, restricting it solely to an advisory capacity. This may not be the case if a strong Opposition exists in Parliament to obstruct the mustering of the required two-thirds voting majority required to push through legislation without <b>the</b> <b>endorsement</b> of the Council.|$|E

5|$|Despite <b>the</b> <b>endorsement</b> of Admiral Sims, the Navy Department {{initially}} {{rejected the}} British request. Like other navies of the late-19th and early-20th centuries, the U.S. Navy rigidly {{adhered to the}} doctrine of Alfred Thayer Mahan, whose first tenet was that under no circumstances should a battle fleet be divided. U.S. Chief of Naval Operations Admiral William S. Benson and Admiral Henry T. Mayo—Commander of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet—were particularly worried that if Britain fell, as developments at sea suggested it might, the U.S. Navy would be left to face the German High Seas Fleet completely on its own.|$|E
5|$|Dodd {{spent most}} of December in Iowa engaged in Town Halls. He briefly made a trip to Mountain View, California to make a speech before {{returning}} to the trails in Iowa.

5|$|Douglas called Downey's {{departure}} {{in favor}} of the publisher a cheap gimmick and made no attempt to reach a rapprochement with the senator, who entered Bethesda Naval Hospital for treatment in early April, and was on sick leave from Congress for several months.

The Clements campaign also attacked Waterfield for being deemed physically unfit for military service. Clements received a late boost when he gained <b>the</b> <b>endorsement</b> of John Y. Brown, Sr., garnering added support from organized labor. Ultimately, Clements defeated Waterfield by over 30,000 votes.|$|E
