5|$|A {{parliamentary}} {{inquiry and}} media reports indicated that <b>the</b> <b>Indigenous</b> traditional owners of Muckaty Station were divided over {{whether it should}} host a radioactive waste facility. Some members of the Ngapa clan supported hosting the facility, while other traditional owners of Muckaty opposed it. There were also claims that {{some members of the}} Ngapa clan were among those who had signed a petition opposing the facility. Political scientist Rebecca Stringer criticised the federal government's approach to the siting of the waste facility, arguing that it undermined <b>the</b> <b>Indigenous</b> owners' sovereignty and control of their own lands. Environmental organisations and the Australian Greens are opposed to using the site for a dump.|$|E

5|$|Bartolomé de las Casas spent 50 {{years of}} his life {{actively}} fighting slavery and the violent colonial abuse of indigenous peoples, especially by trying to convince the Spanish court to adopt a more humane policy of colonization.

Las Casas is often seen {{as one of the first}} advocates for universal conception of human dignity (later human rights).|$|E
5|$|Botanists {{study how}} plants produce food {{and how to}} {{increase}} yields, for example through plant breeding, making their work important to mankind's ability to feed the world and provide food security for future generations.

Ethnobotany {{is the study of}} the relationships between plants and people. When applied to the investigation of historical plant–people relationships ethnobotany may be referred to as archaeobotany or palaeoethnobotany.
