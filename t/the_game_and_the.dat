5|$|Netball is a ball sport {{played by}} two teams of seven players. Its development, derived from early {{versions}} of basketball, began in England in the 1890s. By 1960, international playing rules had been standardised for <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> International Federation of Netball and Women's Basketball (later renamed the International Netball Federation (INF)) was formed. As of 2011, the INF comprises more than 60 national teams organized into five global regions.|$|E
5|$|Robinson {{participated in}} the 2013 Senior Bowl at wide receiver. In the game, Robinson caught two passes for 21 yards and rushed the ball once for a three-yard loss. His {{performance}} in <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> preceding week of practice was regarded as unimpressive and his draft stock fell to the late rounds.|$|E
5|$|The Giants won game one, {{while the}} Dodgers {{came back to}} win game two. After {{trailing}} for most of game three, the Giants rallied to win <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> series. Consequently, they advanced to the 1951 World Series, {{in which they were}} defeated by the New York Yankees. In baseball statistics, the tie-breaker series counted as the 155th, 156th, and 157th regular season games by both teams; all events in the games were added to regular season statistics.|$|E

5|$|The Official Baseball Rules {{administered}} by Major League Baseball require the official scorer to categorize each baseball play unambiguously. The rules provide detailed criteria to promote consistency. The score report {{is the official}} basis for both the box score of <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> relevant statistical records. General managers, managers, and baseball scouts use statistics to evaluate players and make strategic decisions.|$|E

It was initially an exclusive to Club Nintendo subscribers in Japan, although the soundtrack became available to European Club Nintendo members in November 2008.

5|$|To {{advertise}} the game, Konami {{released a}} series of screenshots and viral videos prior to release. The screenshots depicted {{different areas of the}} asylum and victims in their traps. The videos demonstrated the first hour or so of the game and included certain gameplay elements. While a few of the videos are inaccurate due to the developer making dramatic changes to the environment and gameplay, they still maintained the general roots of <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> storyline.|$|E
5|$|A change {{occurred}} in <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> {{role of the}} goalkeeper in the 1880s, when the Scottish reduced {{the size of the}} scoring area by placing rugby posts, spaced about 10 feet apart, {{at each end of the}} pool. At the same time, the rules were changed to allow goalkeepers to stand on the pool deck and leap onto the head of an opposing player who approached the goal. This change in the rules was brief. To prevent the serious injuries that resulted from this method of goalkeeping, the rules were revised again to require the goalie to remain in the water.|$|E
5|$|A single by Koda Kumi {{entitled}} real Emotion/1000 no Kotoba, {{based on}} the theme song for <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ending credits song, was published by Rhythm Zone prior to the game's release in 2003. Another single, titled Kuon: Memories of Waves and Light – Music from Final Fantasy X-2, was released by Avex in 2003 along with the original soundtrack. It consisted of live arrangements {{of several of the}} game's songs, composed and arranged by Noriko Matsueda and Takahito Eguchi. A set of three singles entitled Final Fantasy X-2 Vocal Collection- Paine, Rikku, and Yuna was published by Avex in 2003, with each single including vocal arrangements of songs from the game, sung by the respective character's voice actress.|$|E
50|$|A {{total of}} 54 nations were {{represented}} at <b>the</b> 1990 <b>Games</b> {{with a total}} of 2312 athletes attending <b>the</b> <b>games.</b> However, around 3500 athletes had received invitations to <b>the</b> <b>games</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> attendance was a marked decline from the inaugural edition.|$|R

5|$|Although {{the link}} between {{performance}} in chess and general intelligence is often assumed, researchers have largely failed to confirm its existence. For example, a 2006 study found no differences in fluid intelligence, as measured by Raven's Progressive Matrices, between strong adult chess players and regular people. There is some evidence towards a correlation between performance in chess and intelligence among beginning players. However, performance in chess also relies substantially on one's experience playing <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> role of experience may overwhelm the role of intelligence. Chess experts are estimated to have in excess of 10,000 and possibly as many as 300,000 position patterns stored in their memory; long training is necessary to acquire that amount of data.|$|E
5|$|As with Gearbox's {{previous}} expansion pack , Blue Shift {{returns to}} the setting and events of the original game, but portrays the story {{through the eyes of}} another person. The protagonist in Blue Shift is a security guard, Barney Calhoun, employed by the Black Mesa Research Facility. After a scientific mishap causes Black Mesa to be invaded by aliens, Calhoun must fight his way to safety. The game received mostly positive reception. Many reviewers were critical of the short length of <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> lack of new content, although the inclusion of a High Definition pack that upgraded the models and textures in both Blue Shift and the preceding Half-Life games was praised.|$|E
5|$|Because Florida State had {{received}} the game's opening kickoff, Virginia Tech received the ball to begin the second half. As in the first half, however, the Virginia Tech offense failed to advance the ball in any meaningful fashion. Marcus Vick threw two incompletions and running back Cedric Humes managed a short three-yard dash. Forced to punt the ball away yet again, Virginia Tech set up the game's critical play. From his 34-yard line, punter Nic Schmitt kicked the ball 49yards to the Seminoles' Willie Reid, who broke through the Virginia Tech special teams punt coverage for an 89-yard punt-return touchdown. Reid's return was the first touchdown of <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> first touchdown in ACC Championship Game history. With 13:46 remaining in the third quarter, Florida State had taken a 103 lead.|$|E

In addition, a focus group interview was conducted after each trial run to reveal the students’ perceptions in <b>the</b> <b>games</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> reasons behind their game-playing behaviors.|$|R
2500|$|The 2015 Southeast Asian Games ( [...] ; [...] ), officially {{known as}} the 28th Southeast Asian Games (or simply 28th SEA Games), was a Southeast Asian multi-sport event hosted by the {{city-state}} of Singapore. It was the fourth time <b>the</b> country hosted <b>the</b> <b>games</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> first time since 1993. Singapore previously also hosted <b>the</b> <b>games</b> in 1973 <b>and</b> 1983.|$|R
5|$|By the 1970s, {{the idea}} that the game had been created solely by Charles Darrow had become popular folklore; it was printed in the game's {{instructions}} for many years, in a 1974 book devoted to Monopoly, and was cited in a general book about toys even as recently as 2007. Even a guide to family games published for Reader's Digest in 2003 only gave credit to Darrow and Elizabeth Magie, erroneously stating that Magie's original game was created in the 19th century, and not acknowledging any of the game's development between Magie's creation of <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> eventual publication by Parker Brothers.|$|E
5|$|Christian Donlan of Eurogamer was {{surprised}} by the long length of <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> amount of variety it offered given its simple premise. He enjoyed the game's pacing and felt that separating puzzles into short levels kept the game fun. Game Informer reviewer Kyle Hilliard also approved of the game's pacing. He remarked that BoxBoy!s low price and well-designed puzzles made it entirely worth playing. VentureBeat writer Gavin Greene agreed that the game offered a lot of content at an inexpensive price. The game's structure did draw some criticism from Jon Wahlgren, writing for Nintendo Life. He thought the game spent too much time teaching new mechanics and did not give players enough freedom to explore or experiment; as a result he believed the game felt restricted.|$|E
5|$|Defeating monsters earns the {{character}} experience points, and after earning enough points, {{the character}} will gain an experience level, improving their hit points, magic capability, and other attributes. Monsters may drop treasure to be looted. On the other hand, the character dies {{if they lose}} all their hit points. As most roguelikes feature the concept of permadeath, this represents the end of <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> player will need to restart {{the game with a}} newly made character. Roguelikes are nearly always turn-based, with the game only reacting when the player makes an action with the character. This allows players to evaluate a difficult situation, such as being cornered by several monsters, at their own pace and determine the best strategy.|$|E
50|$|The {{official}} {{partners for}} the Australian team were Disabled WinterSport Australia (DWA), who identified <b>and</b> developed <b>the</b> Australian athletes over the Paralympiad {{leading up to}} <b>the</b> <b>games,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Australian Institute of Sport (AIS), who provided the resources, as well as technical and sports advice to enable the team to travel and compete.|$|R
50|$|The opening parade is {{the most}} viewed event of <b>the</b> <b>Games,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> 1992 winter event {{attracted}} over 1.5 billion viewers worldwide.
