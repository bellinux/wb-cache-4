40|$|Aim: To {{assess the}} effect of various socio-demographic in {{addition}} to <b>oral</b> <b>hygiene</b> variables on <b>the</b> <b>oral</b> <b>hygiene</b> and periodontal status. Methods: A combination of multi stage and cluster sampling procedure was followed to collect a representative population of 831, 12 year-old schoolchildren of Udiapur district. <b>Oral</b> <b>Hygiene</b> Index -Simplified (OHI-S) and Community Periodontal Index (CPI) were used to evaluate <b>oral</b> <b>hygiene</b> and periodontal status respectively. Along with the clinical examination, each subject was interviewed to collect the socio-demographic information and <b>oral</b> <b>hygiene</b> practices. Results: <b>The</b> overall mean OHI-S was 1. 42 and debris component of <b>the</b> <b>oral</b> <b>hygiene</b> index was dominant. Unpaired 't' test showed significantly higher DI-S (p = 0. 0001) and OHI-S (p = 0. 007) among boys than girls. The overall prevalence of periodontal disease was 89. 9 % and gingival bleeding was widespread. Chi square test demonstrated significant differences (p = 0. 0001) with 14. 6 % urban children having healthy periodontium in comparison to 5. 6 % rural residents. <b>Oral</b> <b>hygiene</b> scores were dependent on the father's occupation (p = 0. 046), father's (p = 0. 002) and mother's level of education (p = 0. 0001). Conclusions: <b>Oral</b> <b>hygiene</b> status was poor, more among boys with debris contributing a major part for <b>oral</b> <b>hygiene</b> index. Periodontal status was poor with bleeding being most prevalent indicator. The multivariate analysis of <b>oral</b> <b>hygiene</b> status confirmed <b>the</b> existence of socio-behavioural determinants for <b>oral</b> <b>hygiene.</b> No Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|Background: High frenum {{attachment}} is a {{very common}} problem in the population. Various conventional techniques are available which has certain disadvantages; {{in addition to that}} high frenum also hinders <b>oral</b> <b>hygiene</b> maintenance. This study aims to evaluate patient's response to two different frenectomy technique, and <b>oral</b> <b>hygiene</b> maintenance before and after frenectomy. Materials and Methods: Twenty patients with high labial frenum were randomly selected from the outpatient department. Patients were divided into two groups according to the technique used. Each group contained ten patients. One group was treated by “conventional scalpel technique” and other group by “new paralleling technique”. To evaluate patients response, visual analogue scale for pain and speech were taken at first postoperative day, 1 -week and 1 -month. In other part of <b>the</b> study <b>the</b> <b>oral</b> <b>hygiene</b> maintenance was evaluated by using plaque and gingival bleeding index at baseline before frenectomy, 1 -week and 1 -month after frenectomy. Results: Results showed that new paralleling technique for frenectomy causes less postoperative discomfort and also there was significant improvement in <b>the</b> <b>oral</b> <b>hygiene</b> maintenance by <b>the</b> patient after frenectomy. Conclusion: High maxillary frenum causes hindrance in <b>oral</b> <b>hygiene</b> maintenance. Paralleling technique for frenectomy causes less discomfort to the patient during healing phase when compared with the conventional technique...|$|R
