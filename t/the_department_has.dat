5|$|Drama {{is offered}} as an {{academic}} subject from the first form, but as well as this numerous plays are staged throughout the year for all year groups in association with local girls schools. <b>The</b> <b>department</b> <b>has</b> a state-of-the-art auditorium which was converted from the old gymnasium {{as well as a}} studio called the Hansford Room sited in the North Building.|$|E
5|$|The library {{houses the}} village's {{recreation}} department, which has four employees and a six-member advisory committee, and provides recreation programming for the village. This includes regular programs and special {{events at the}} pool, parks, and sports fields and courts. It issues about 1,400 pool permits annually and manages about 400 summer camp registrations each year. <b>The</b> <b>department</b> <b>has</b> operated the recreation center on Macy Road since 1980, and also runs a youth center on Van Lu Van Road. Its 2017–18 operating budget is $1,432,116.|$|E

50|$|John Escalante, {{the interim}} {{superintendent}} of <b>the</b> Chicago Police <b>Department</b> (CPD), said about 300 officers {{were on hand}} for crowd control. A CPD spokesman said <b>the</b> <b>department</b> <b>had</b> never told <b>the</b> Trump campaign {{that there was a}} security threat, and added that <b>the</b> <b>department</b> <b>had</b> sufficient manpower on the scene to handle any situation.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Department</b> of Applied Science {{later became}} more {{centered}} at the UC Davis campus. Many of <b>the</b> <b>department's</b> faculty <b>had</b> joint appointments with LLNL or other national laboratories, {{so that students}} in <b>the</b> <b>department</b> <b>had</b> access to facilities in both locations.|$|R
5|$|Consolidated Edison {{provides}} {{electric power}} {{and natural gas}} to the village, and the Briarcliff Manor Department of Public Works supplies water from the Catskill Aqueduct to the village's water system. The department also maintains the sewer system, village vehicles, roads, and grounds, operates a recycling center, and removes snow. In 2012 the village tied for fourth place (out of 48 Westchester municipalities) {{in the percentage of}} recycled waste (71percent, above the county average of 52percent). The department, primarily rooted in the 1941 sale of Walter Law's Briarcliff Table Water Company, began with a state-mandated street commissioner. The commissioner in 1914 was Arthur Brown; asked by village officials if he needed an automobile, Brown replied that he preferred a horse but would use an automobile if the village purchased it (it did not). <b>The</b> <b>department</b> <b>has</b> about thirty vehicles and employs twenty-nine people.|$|E
5|$|Local {{officials}} in Allegan have proposed {{creation of a}} truck route around the town. Concerned about the traffic and noise, residents have formed the Citizens for a Safer Community. They cite reports that show that the accident rates in town are higher than the statewide average. The group and local officials are proposing using 24th Street, 118th Avenue and Babylon Road for truck traffic. MDOT would require permits to erect the signs needed for the truck route. <b>The</b> <b>department</b> <b>has</b> indicated that the bypass {{would not be a}} state highway. MDOT will not take ownership of the roads needed for the truck route, but overall the department is supportive of the city's efforts to make the downtown area more pedestrian friendly.|$|E
5|$|The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) {{maintains}} M-48 {{like all}} {{other parts of the}} state trunkline highway system under its jurisdiction. As a part of these responsibilities, the department tracks the volume of traffic along its roads using a metric called average annual daily traffic (AADT). This measurement is a calculation of the average traffic levels for a roadway segment on any average day of the year. In 2009, MDOT figured that between 580 and 1,800vehicles a day used sections of M-48. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>department</b> <b>has</b> added the portion of M-48 between the northern M-129 junction and M-134 to the Lake Huron Circle Tour, a scenic drive that loops around the lake. No part of the highway has been added to the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E

50|$|As of 2011, <b>the</b> <b>department</b> <b>had</b> a total {{population}} of 303,469 people.|$|R
50|$|Under Brown <b>the</b> <b>Department</b> <b>had</b> a {{reasonable}} degree of influence. However, Brown {{was moved to}} the Foreign Office in August 1966, and the two succeeding secretaries of state were not of his rank. The Treasury was able to claw back its power and <b>the</b> <b>Department</b> <b>had</b> become moribund long before it was wound up in 1969.|$|R
5|$|The Puerto Rican government's Departments of Family, Education, and Health {{have since}} {{combined}} {{efforts to create}} a 5-year strategic plan to improve the program's long-term performance and financial management. The Family Department has recently implemented a quality control-like program titled Measure of Efforts and Results System, which evaluates the quality and promptitude of services while reviewing various eligibility elements, to improve customer services and program management. <b>The</b> <b>Department</b> <b>has</b> also agreed to switch from a biennial audit to an annual Single Audit, and subject the program to periodic audits by its Administration for Socio-Economic Development, to detect and correct problems more quickly. Furthermore, the USDA's Office of Inspector General (OIG) has performed regular audits to assure compliance and identify areas for improvement.|$|E
5|$|A revised {{environmental}} impact study {{to account for the}} butterfly's habitat in the northern area of the freeway was approved in 2004. The study compared the original routing for this extension that involved connecting directly to I-196 at I-94 with an alternate route that involved an indirection connection via the BL I-94 interchange and an I-94 concurrency near Benton Harbor. The study recommended using a version of the alternate connection to avoid the Blue Creek Fen, both to save money and decrease impact to the Mitchell's satyr. At the time the freeway segment opened in 2003, MDOT expected the remaining segment would not take much longer to complete, but since then, funding has not been available. MDOT did not include construction of the extension for this reason in the department's 2014–18 highway projects plan released in 2013, although most of the design work and land acquisition has been completed. Until the missing freeway segment is built, US31 follows a stretch of Napier Avenue, which was upgraded in conjunction with the St. Joseph Valley Parkway opening to that point, westward to I-94. The US31/I-94/BL I-94 interchange will be converted to a cloverleaf interchange and additional lanes will be added to I-94 as well. The St. Joseph Valley Parkway name has already been applied to this unbuilt section. MDOT's 2017–21 plan draft released in July 2016 split the remaining work into three phases. <b>The</b> <b>department</b> <b>has</b> listed funding for only the first two of these three phases, and construction is anticipated to start in 2021.|$|E
5|$|Currently, the {{conservation}} department serves {{the needs of}} the museum through the expertise of specialists in paintings, textiles, works on paper, frames, and objects conservation. <b>The</b> <b>department</b> <b>has</b> grown in both size and staff throughout the years, with the most recent expansion occurring in 2007. As of 2007, the IMA owned one of the few computer-based X-ray units in the United States, continuing a trend in X-ray technology that the department began in the 1970s. In 1980, the department helped organize and establish the Midwest Regional Conservation Guild, which includes conservators and conservation scientists from Indiana, Ohio, Illinois, and Michigan. In the mid-1980s, the department received attention when head conservator Martin Radecki assisted local authorities in uncovering over two dozen forged T.C. Steele and William Forsythe paintings worth more than $200,000. The high-profile forgery case led Radecki to organize an exhibit in 1989, Is it Genuine? Steele, Forsythe and Forgery in Indiana. The exhibit highlighted conservation techniques and examined how forgeries can be discovered. Another public presentation of conservation took place in 2007 with Sebastiano Mainardi: The Science of Art, a Star Studio exhibit that allowed visitors to watch conservators as they worked on the 16th-century altarpiece. The IMA's Star Studio is an interactive gallery that enables visitors to learn, through the process of art-making and observation, about the museum's collections.|$|E
