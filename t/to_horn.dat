5|$|No. 75 Wing was a Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) wing that {{operated}} during World WarII. It {{was formed}} in October 1943 at Townsville, Queensland, under North-Eastern Area Command. The wing soon deployed <b>to</b> <b>Horn</b> Island {{to take control of}} RAAF units based there and at Thursday Island and Cape York Peninsula. Responsible for air defence and maritime patrol in the Torres Strait, No.75 Wing's flying units operated P-40 Kittyhawk fighters, Bristol Beaufort reconnaissance bombers, and A-31 Vengeance dive bombers. The wing was disbanded in August 1944.|$|E
5|$|Assigned to the 11th Brigade, 3rd Division, in May {{the newly}} formed {{battalion}} undertook amphibious training and intensive physical activities such as route marches around Yorkeys Knob, Queensland, in preparation for deployment overseas. In June–July 1943, {{under the command of}} Lieutenant Colonel Geoffrey Brock, the battalion was deployed to Merauke, in Dutch New Guinea as part of Merauke Force. They departed from Cairns on board the TSS Canberra on 20 June, arriving at Thursday Island on 24 June. From there they were transferred <b>to</b> <b>Horn</b> Island before boarding the MV Van de Ljin and arriving at Merauke on 16 July 1943.|$|E

5|$|In late September the two Australian squadrons at Milne Bay were {{relieved}} by two USAAF squadrons, and No.75 Squadron was redeployed <b>to</b> <b>Horn</b> Island. It subsequently moved again to Cairns {{for a period}} of rest before returning to Milne Bay in February 1943, under the command of Squadron Leader Wilfred Arthur. During this deployment the squadron operated alongside No.77 Squadron. No.75 Squadron flew patrols over Milne Bay and Goodenough Island, and on 14May a mixed force of 17 Kittyhawks from it and No.77 Squadrons inflicted heavy casualties on a force of 65 Japanese aircraft bound for Milne Bay while only a single Australian aircraft was lost. This was No.75 Squadron's last major air battle of the war. From August to December the squadron was issued with two F-4Lightning aircraft for photo reconnaissance tasks. No.75 Squadron moved to Goodenough Island in October 1943 to support the Allied offensive in the Louisiade Archipelago and New Britain.|$|E
5|$|On 11March 1944, No.84 Squadron was hurriedly redeployed to North-Western Area {{to replace}} the Supermarine Spitfires of No.1 Wing, which had been {{despatched}} to Perth {{in response to a}} feared Japanese naval attack. No attack took place, and No.84 Squadron returned <b>to</b> <b>Horn</b> Island less than two weeks later. On 17May, the squadron departed Horn Island for Townsville, and was subsequently reduced to cadre. No.7 Squadron continued operations in the Dutch East Indies from Higgins, generally in conjunction with other forces such as B-25 Mitchells from North-Western Area, before its tasking was reduced in August pending transfer to No.71 Wing in New Guinea. No.23 Squadron was equipped with A-31 Vengeance dive bombers and undertook army-cooperation duties out of Higgins until being declared non-operational in June. That month, a squadron leader from North-Eastern Area Command arrived at No.75 Wing headquarters to investigate Vengeance accidents and unserviceability; on departure his Vengeance crash-landed on the beach at Princess Charlotte Bay and the crew had to be rescued by an aircraft of No.9 Squadron. No.23 Squadron was subsequently re-equipped with B-24 Liberator heavy bombers and transferred to North-Western Area.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to combat with predators using horns, Triceratops are classically shown engaging {{each other in}} combat with horns locked. While studies show that such activity would be feasible, if unlike that of present-day horned animals, there is disagreement about whether they did so. Although pitting, holes, lesions, and other damage on Triceratops skulls (and the skulls of other ceratopsids) are often attributed <b>to</b> <b>horn</b> damage in combat, a 2006 study finds no evidence for horn thrust injuries causing these forms of damage (for example, {{there is no evidence}} of infection or healing). Instead, non-pathological bone resorption, or unknown bone diseases, are suggested as causes. A newer study compared incidence rates of skull lesions and periosteal reaction in Triceratops and Centrosaurus and showed that these were consistent with Triceratops using its horns in combat and the frill being adapted as a protective structure, while lower pathology rates in Centrosaurus may indicate visual rather than physical use of cranial ornamentation, or a form of combat focused on the body rather than the head. The frequency of injury was found to be 14% in Triceratops. The researchers also concluded that the damage found on the specimens in the study was often too localized to be caused by bone disease. Histological examination reveals that the frill of Triceratops is composed of fibrolamellar bone which contains fibroblasts that play a critical role in wound healing, and are capable of rapidly depositing bone during remodeling.|$|E

5|$|In late August 1942, No.6 Squadron moved <b>to</b> <b>Horn</b> Island in the Torres Strait and {{established}} a detachment of four aircraft at Gurney Field, Milne Bay in New Guinea. The Milne Bay detachment had been formed to provide reconnaissance and bomber support of the Australian garrison there, which {{was expected to be}} attacked. Japanese forces landed at Milne Bay on the night of 25/26 August, sparking the Battle of Milne Bay which ended in an Allied victory in early September. No.6 Squadron flew reconnaissance and anti-shipping patrols from the airfields at Milne Bay throughout the battle. The squadron attacked a convoy of three Japanese destroyers and three patrol boats which were carrying reinforcement troops to Milne Bay on 29 August. While the squadron claimed to have damaged a destroyer in this operation, the Japanese force did not actually incur any damage. Following the Allied victory at Milne Bay, No.6 Squadron Hudsons continued to patrol the region near Milne Bay, and sank a Japanese transport ship near Woodlark Island on 26 September. The Horn Island-based elements of the squadron moved to Wards Strip near the town of Port Moresby in New Guinea on 11 October from where it conducted anti-submarine patrols alongside No.100 Squadron. For much of November the squadron also supported the Australian Army force engaged in the Kokoda Track campaign by dropping supplies and evacuating sick soldiers. From 6 December until near the end of that month, No. 6Squadron conducted night bombing raids of the Japanese beachhead at Buna, Sanananda and Gona; these included an attack on a destroyer off Buna. Towards the end of December the squadron was concentrated at Turnbull Field at Milne Bay from where it undertook reconnaissance and anti-submarine patrols.|$|E
25|$|On 9–10 September, in {{preparation}} for starting operations, the 38th BG {{was assigned to the}} Fifth Air Force's Advanced Echelon (ADVON) and a forward echelon moved <b>to</b> <b>Horn</b> Island Aerodrome. 12 Mitchells flew the first combat mission on 15 September 1942, staging through Port Moresby, to bomb and strafe Japanese Army positions and an airfield near Buna, New Guinea. On 28 September the forward echelon displaced to Laloki airfield, New Guinea, where it continued reconnaissance and occasional bombing missions, while the remainder of the group moved up to Townsville. The 38th BG experienced its first combat loss when fighters shot down a B-25 attacking a convoy off Buna on 5 October.|$|E
25|$|No. 84 Squadron {{was formed}} at RAAF Station Richmond, New South Wales, on 5 February 1943. It was {{selected}} as the first operational squadron to be equipped with Australian-designed CAC Boomerang fighters in March, but did not take delivery of any of these aircraft at the time. During late March the squadron moved <b>to</b> <b>Horn</b> Island in the Torres Strait via Cairns; its main party arrived on 1 April and the rear party disembarked on 1 May. No. 84 Squadron's first ten Boomerangs arrived at Horn Island on 4 April, and the squadron was declared operational that day. More Boomerangs arrived on 15 April, and by 1 May the squadron had a strength of 20 Boomerangs, 23 officers and 275 other ranks.|$|E

25|$|Some audiophiles use horn {{loudspeakers}} for audio reproduction, {{while others}} eschew horn systems for their harmonic resonances, finding in them an unpleasant form of distortion. Since {{there are a}} variety of horn designs (of differing length, material, and taper, as well as different drivers) it is, to some extent, impossible to give such blanket characterizations <b>to</b> <b>horn</b> loudspeakers. Audiophiles using low power amplifiers, sometimes in the five to twenty-five watt range, may find the typically high efficiency of horn loudspeakers an especially attractive feature because it makes it possible to reach playable music levels. Conversely, greater care must be taken in selection of ones audio gear, the high sensitivity can also make any background noise present at the amplifier outputs noticeably worse at the distances of a typical living room.|$|E
25|$|No. 32 Squadron's first mission {{took place}} {{the day it}} was formed, when {{aircraft}} were launched to search for a reported enemy submarine. A few days later, the squadron undertook the first of many bombing raids on the Japanese air base at Gasmata. After only a few weeks of operations, due to enemy raids on Port Moresby's Seven Mile airfield, the squadron was withdrawn <b>to</b> <b>Horn</b> Island, Queensland, but continued to stage out of Seven Mile on its missions, its aircraft refuelling there en route to their targets. In March 1942, one of the squadron's Hudsons was the first to spot the Japanese convoy transporting the forces for the invasion of the New Guinea mainland. Later the same month, the squadron engaged Japanese forces landing at Lae and Salamaua. In July 1942, No. 32 Squadron was active in the Gona area and during the lead-up to the Battle of Milne Bay.|$|E
25|$|No. 120 (NEI) Squadron {{began moving}} from Canberra to Merauke in early April 1944. Its main party arrived at Merauke on 7 May and the {{squadron}} was declared operational two days later. After {{a period of}} training, No. 120 (NEI) Squadron began flying combat missions in late June. Due to the limited Japanese presence in the region, the missions were limited to strafing attacks on Japanese positions as well attacks on small craft {{off the coast of}} New Guinea. Several aircraft were lost during these operations. While the other RAAF units at Merauke were redeployed in late 1944, No. 120 (NEI) Squadron remained at the town and proposed moves <b>to</b> <b>Horn</b> Island and Cape York did not eventuate. During October, it was decided to move the squadron, along with the other two units of No. 79 Wing (No. 2 Squadron and No. 18 (NEI) Squadron) to New Britain to support Australian Army operations there. While the wing was issued with orders to move to New Britain on 31 December, this was delayed as the planned airfield at Jacquinot Bay could not be made ready until March. No. 120 (NEI) Squadron became non-operational on 14 February 1945, though some of its pilots were temporarily attached to No. 77 Squadron. The squadron departed Merauke on 14 April 1945 bound for Darwin, Northern Territory where it would join up with the rest of No. 79 Wing before proceeding to Jacquinot Bay.|$|E

500|$|No.75 Squadron was redeployed <b>to</b> <b>Horn</b> Island, Queensland, in September 1942, and Jackson {{handed over}} command to Squadron Leader John Meehan the {{following}} January. In {{recognition of his}} [...] "courage and leadership" [...] in New Guinea, Jackson was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC), which was promulgated in the London Gazette on 26March 1943. Having served in staff positions in Australia during the year, he was appointed wing leader of No.78 (Fighter) Wing, {{a component of the}} newly formed No.10 Operational Group, in December 1943. The wing participated in Operation Reckless, the assault on Hollandia and Aitape that opened the Western New Guinea campaign, in April 1944. This was followed by the attack on Noemfoor, commencing in June. Jackson was promoted to acting wing commander in September 1944. Completing his tour with No.78 Wing in December, he was posted to No.8 Operational Training Unit, New South Wales, as chief flying instructor. In March 1945, Jackson was awarded a bar to his DFC for [...] "determined and successful attacks on enemy installations and shipping". That June, he took command of Air Defence Headquarters in Madang.|$|E
500|$|On 22March, the {{day after}} he arrived in New Guinea, Jackson took No.75 Squadron on a dawn raid against the Japanese {{airfield}} at Lae. [...] Rather than attacking directly from the south, he led the Kittyhawks in from the east, where they would not be expected and where the rising sun would hide their approach. Achieving the surprise he had hoped for, Jackson made two strafing passes over the airfield, ignoring standard practice that called for only one such pass to reduce the risk from anti-aircraft fire. The Australians claimed a dozen Japanese planes destroyed on the ground and five more damaged. They also shot down two Mitsubishi Zero fighters in the air, and lost two Kittyhawks over Lae, along with one that had crash-landed on takeoff from Moresby. The Japanese struck back the next day, destroying two Kittyhawks at Seven Mile Aerodrome. With his losses mounting, Jackson was given permission to withdraw the squadron <b>to</b> <b>Horn</b> Island in Far North Queensland, but refused. On 4April, Jackson made a solo reconnaissance over Lae, after which he led another four Kittyhawks on a raid against the airfield, claiming seven enemy aircraft destroyed on the ground without loss to themselves; Japanese sources credited the Australians with only two machines destroyed, but seventeen others damaged. Two days later, Les Jackson was forced to ditch his aircraft on a coral reef, but made it to shore {{with the aid of a}} life jacket that John dropped to him, not realising at the time that the downed pilot was his younger brother.|$|E
500|$|MacDermot {{followed}} Hair {{with three}} successive rock scores: Two Gentlemen of Verona (1971); Dude (1972), a second collaboration with Ragni; and Via Galactica (1972). [...] While Two Gentlemen of Verona found receptive audiences and a Tony for Best Musical, Dude failed after just sixteenperformances, and Via Galactica flopped after a month. [...] According <b>to</b> <b>Horn,</b> {{these and other}} such [...] "failures {{may have been the}} result of producers simply relying on the label 'rock musical' to attract audiences without regard {{to the quality of the}} material presented." [...] Jesus Christ Superstar (1970) and Godspell (1971) were two religiously themed successes of the genre. [...] Grease (1971) reverted to the rock sounds of the 1950s, and black-themed musicals like The Wiz (1975) were heavily influenced by gospel, R and soul music. [...] By the late 1970s, the genre had played itself out. [...] Except for a few outposts of rock, like Dreamgirls (1981) and Little Shop of Horrors (1982), audience tastes in the 1980s turned to [...] with pop scores, like Les Misérables (1985) and The Phantom of the Opera (1986). [...] Some later rock musicals, such as Rent (1996) and Spring Awakening (2006), as well as jukebox musicals featuring rock music, like We Will Rock You (2002) and Rock of Ages (2009), have found success. [...] But the rock musical did not quickly come to dominate the musical theatre stage after Hair. [...] Critic Clive Barnes commented, [...] "There really weren't any rock musicals. [...] No major rock musician ever did a rock score for Broadway. ... You might think of the musical Tommy, but it was never conceived as a Broadway show. ... And one can see why. [...] There's so much more money in records and rock concerts. [...] I mean, why bother going through the pain of a musical which may close in Philadelphia?" ...|$|E
