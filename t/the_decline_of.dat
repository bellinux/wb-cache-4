40|$|Aging is {{characterized}} by progressive, degenerative changes in many tissues. To elucidate the relationships among degenerative changes in Caenorhabditis elegans, we developed methods to measure age-related changes quantitatively and analyzed correlations among these changes by using a longitudinal study. <b>The</b> age-related <b>declines</b> <b>of</b> pharyngeal pumping and body movement were positively correlated {{with each other and}} lifespan. These findings suggest that <b>the</b> <b>declines</b> <b>of</b> pharyngeal pumping and body movement cause a decline in survival probability or that a shared regulatory system mediates <b>the</b> <b>declines</b> in pharyngeal pumping, body movement, and survival probability. Furthermore, measurements of these processes can be used to predict lifespan and detect premature aging. <b>The</b> <b>declines</b> <b>of</b> physiological processes were measured in daf- 2, age- 1, daf- 16, eat- 2, and clk- 1 mutants that have altered lifespans. Each mutant strain displayed changes in one or more age-related <b>declines,</b> but <b>the</b> correlations among age-related changes were similar to WT. These measurements were used to generate a system of four stages that describes the aging process and is useful for the analysis of genetic and environmental effects on aging...|$|R

5|$|The {{construction}} of the Manchester Ship Canal and the Manchester Docks {{led to the development}} of Trafford Park as the largest industrial estate in Europe, and brought employment to the area for the next eighty years. By the 1960s however, the UK had begun to lose its position as an industrial world power. By the mid-20th century, the UK cotton industry had gone into decline because of low-cost competition from Asian manufacturers. <b>The</b> <b>decline</b> <b>of</b> heavy industry in the area, the increasing size of freight-carrying ships, and competition from road transport, brought about <b>the</b> <b>decline</b> <b>of</b> the terminal docks at Salford, which closed in 1982.|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} known that some solar {{activity}} indicators show a double-peak feature in their evolution through a solar cycle, which is not conspicuous in sunspot number. In this letter, we investigate the high solar dynamic activity in <b>the</b> <b>declining</b> phase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sunspot cycle by examining the evolution of polar and low latitude coronal hole areas and the statistics of splitting and merging events of coronal holes and coronal mass ejections detected by SOHO/LASCO C 3 in solar cycle 23. Although the total coronal hole area is at its maximum near the sunspot minimum, in which polar coronal holes prevail, it shows a comparable second maximum in <b>the</b> <b>declining</b> phase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cycle, in which low latitude coronal holes are dominant. The events of coronal hole splitting or merging, which are attributed to surface motions of magnetic fluxes, are also mostly populated in <b>the</b> <b>declining</b> phase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cycle. The far-reaching C 3 coronal mass ejections are also over-populated in <b>the</b> <b>declining</b> phase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cycle. From these results we suggest that solar dynamic activities due to the horizontal motions of magnetic fluxes extend far in <b>the</b> <b>declining</b> phase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sunspot cycle...|$|R
