5|$|Nedvěd was {{instrumental}} in the Euro 2004 group stage match against the Netherlands. Two goals down after 19 minutes, he gave a man of the match performance as <b>the</b> <b>Czechs</b> rebounded to win 3–2. Nine players (including Nedvěd) were rested for the group match against Germany, with <b>the</b> <b>Czechs</b> already qualified for the knockout stage. He received a yellow card, upheld on appeal, in the quarter-final match against Denmark. This meant Nedvěd would miss the final if he received another yellow card in the semi-final against Greece. However, Greece defeated <b>the</b> <b>Czechs</b> and Nedvěd was substituted after a knee injury. After their exit from the tournament, Nedvěd announced his retirement from the national team; he was named to the Team of the Tournament alongside countrymen Petr Čech and Milan Baroš.|$|E
5|$|The {{reason for}} the Czech {{invasion}} in 1919 was primarily the organisation of elections to the Sejm (parliament) of Poland in the disputed area.

With the approach of <b>the</b> <b>Czechs,</b> Michael and Natalia feared that she would become trapped there, possibly in a dangerous situation and so, on 18 May, she left unhappily. By early June, Michael was again ill with stomach trouble.|$|E

The overall commander of the joint Polish–Lithuanian force was King Władysław II Jagiełło; however, he did not directly participate in the battle. The Lithuanian units were commanded directly by Grand Duke Vytautas, who was second in command, and helped design the grand strategy of the campaign. Vytautas actively participated in the battle, managing both Lithuanian and Polish units. Jan Długosz stated that the low-ranking sword bearer of the Crown, Zyndram of Maszkowice, commanded the Polish army, but that is highly doubtful.

5|$|The LT vz. 34, {{formally}} {{designated as}} Lehký Tank vzor 34 ("Light Tank Model 34") was a Czechoslovak-designed light tank used mainly by Slovakia during World War II.

Dissatisfied with the prototypes of the Tančík vz. 33 tankette, the Czech Army decided {{that it would be}} easier to design a light tank from scratch rather than modify a tankette's chassis to carry a fully rotating armored turret. 50 were built, the last of which was delivered during 1936, of which the Germans captured 22 - including the prototype, when they occupied Bohemia-Moravia in March 1939, but they promptly scrapped them. The Slovaks seized the remaining 27 (18 + 9 nine LT vz. 34 light tanks which <b>the</b> <b>Czechs</b> had evacuated from Carpatho-Ukraine to Humene and Prešov.) when they declared independence from Czechoslovakia at the same time.

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the issue of {{immigrants}} in <b>the</b> <b>Czech</b> Republic. It starts with a brief history of migration in the world, later only focused on <b>the</b> <b>Czech</b> circumstances. Later, it describes the present state of migration in <b>the</b> <b>Czech</b> Republic. <b>The</b> theoretical part includes the development of legal and illegal immigration in <b>the</b> <b>Czech</b> Republic and some of the principles and programs of <b>the</b> <b>Czech</b> government. <b>The</b> first of programs is The selection of qualified foreign workers, in which <b>the</b> <b>Czech</b> government aims to attract skilled foreigners to <b>the</b> <b>Czech</b> Republic. <b>The</b> second project is called Voluntary returns, in which <b>the</b> <b>Czech</b> government assists legal and illegal immigrants with their repatriation. The third project is called Regularization and it copes with the legalization of illegally staying and working immigrants. The practical part consists of a questionnaire survey among the citizens of <b>the</b> <b>Czech</b> Republic and an interview with an alien, who has resided in <b>the</b> <b>Czech</b> Republic for several years. The goal of the questionnaire is to examine <b>the</b> opinion of <b>Czech</b> citizens to immigrants and their views on the approach of <b>the</b> <b>Czech</b> government in this field. The interview presents the issue form the other perspective, the view of immigrants.
