50|$|In {{programming}} language theory, the call-by-push-value (CBPV) paradigm, inspired by monads, allows writing semantics for lambda-calculus without writing two variants {{to deal with}} the difference between call-by-name and call-by-value. To do so, CBPV introduces a term language that distinguishes computations and values, according to the slogan a value is, a computation does; this term language has a single evaluation order. However, <b>to</b> <b>evaluate</b> a lambda-calculus term according to either the call-by-name (CBN) or call-by-value (CBV) reduction strategy, one can translate the term to CBPV using a call-by-name or call-by-value translation strategy, which give rise <b>to</b> different terms. <b>Evaluating</b> <b>the</b> result of the call-by-value translation corresponds <b>to</b> <b>evaluating</b> <b>the</b> original term with <b>the</b> call-by-value strategy; <b>evaluating</b> <b>the</b> result of the call-by-name translation corresponds instead <b>to</b> <b>evaluating</b> <b>the</b> original term with the call-by-name strategy.|$|R
