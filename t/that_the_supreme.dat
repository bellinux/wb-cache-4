5|$|In United States federal courts, {{a circuit}} split occurs when {{two or more}} {{different}} circuit courts of appeals provide conflicting rulings on the same legal issue. The existence of a circuit split {{is one of the}} factors <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court of the United States considers when deciding whether to grant review of a case. Some scholars suggest <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court is more likely to grant review of a case to resolve a circuit split than for any other reason.|$|E
5|$|The goddess-oriented Shakti {{tradition}} of Hinduism {{is based on}} the premise <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> Principle and the Ultimate Reality called Brahman is female (Devi), but it treats the male as her equal and complementary partner. This partner is Shiva.|$|E
5|$|Brennan then {{noted that}} the {{principles}} of statutory construction as regards to Indians were very specific. Any differences in possible interpretation must be resolved {{in favor of the}} tribe or the Indian. Since Minnesota's interpretation did not meet any of these tests regarding either the consent of Congress to tax or of statutory construction, Brennan stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court would not follow the state's reasoning, and reversed the lower court's decision.|$|E

5|$|Juan José Castelli was {{the main}} speaker for the revolutionaries. He based his speech on two key ideas: the government's lapsed legitimacy—he stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> Central Junta was {{dissolved}} and had no rights to designate a Regency—and the principle of retroversion of sovereignty. He spoke after Riega, and replied that the American people should assume control of their government until FerdinandVII could return to the throne.|$|E
5|$|Since {{this case}} {{challenged}} {{the authority of}} the federal courts to try Indian-on-Indian crime, this case was heard as an interlocutory appeal, meaning <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court would have to decide the constitutionality of the claimed jurisdiction before Kagama could be tried for the killing of Iyouse in federal court.|$|E
5|$|Three deputies from Coquimbo, Santiago and Concepción {{organized}} a new government, and proposed San Martín as Supreme Director of Chile. He declined the offer and proposed O'Higgins in his stead: he recommended <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> Director should be someone from Chile. San Martín would instead organize the navy {{to take the}} fight to Peru. He established a {{local chapter of the}} lodge of Rational Knights, named as Logia Lautaro, in reference to mapuche leader Lautaro.|$|E
500|$|Further complicating {{matters is}} <b>the</b> fact <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme's</b> [...] "voice echoes {{back and forth}} in time—recalling his birth and his youth, only to jump ahead to the future, {{speaking}} [...] beyond the grave about <b>the</b> flies <b>that</b> disturb his corpse, the bandits who dare to disturb his sleep." ...|$|R

5|$|The {{court also}} reviews death penalty cases, state tax court appeals, and items {{regarding}} legal discipline on direct review. Direct review means <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court hears cases directly upon appeal without the case first {{going to the}} Court of Appeals. Other direct review items include state agency decisions such as the placement of prisons, placement of energy production facilities, locations of sites for solid waste disposal, and some labor law injunctions. Additionally, the court has original jurisdiction in, writs of mandamus, writs quo warranto, writs of habeas corpus, reapportionment of state legislative districts, and challenges to ballot measures such as their titles, the fiscal impact statement, and the explanatory statement as listed in the Voter’s Pamphlet.|$|E
5|$|Censorship was {{commonplace in}} the early 20th century. State laws and city {{ordinances}} routinely outlawed speech deemed to be obscene or offensive, and prohibited meetings or literature that promoted unions or labor organization. Starting in 1926, the ACLU began to expand its free speech activities to encompass censorship of art and literature. In that year, H. L. Mencken deliberately broke Boston law by distributing copies of his banned American Mercury magazine; the ACLU defended him and won an acquittal. The ACLU {{went on to win}} additional victories, including the landmark case United States v. One Book Called Ulysses in 1933, which reversed a ban by the Customs Department against the book Ulysses by James Joyce. The ACLU only achieved mixed results {{in the early}} years, and it was not until 1966 <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court finally clarified the obscenity laws in the Roth v. United States and Memoirs v. Massachusetts cases.|$|E
5|$|On July 15, 1835, {{tensions}} and emotions finally overflowed and blood was spilled. Monroe County, Michigan, Deputy Sheriff Joseph Wood went into Toledo to arrest Major Benjamin Stickney, but when Stickney {{and his three}} sons resisted, the whole family was subdued and taken into custody. During the scuffle, Two Stickney, son of the major, stabbed Wood with a pen knife and fled south into Ohio. Wood's injuries were not life-threatening. When Lucas refused Mason's demand to extradite Two Stickney back to Michigan for trial, Mason wrote to President Jackson for help, suggesting that the matter be referred to the United States Supreme Court. At {{the time of the}} conflict it was not established <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court could resolve state boundary disputes, and Jackson declined the offer. Looking for peace, Lucas began making his own efforts to end the conflict, again through federal intervention via Ohio's congressional delegation.|$|E

5|$|The Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions had in {{the year}} since {{publication}} received highly critical replies from state legislatures. Seven states formally responded to Virginia and Kentucky by rejecting the Resolutions and three other states passed resolutions expressing disapproval, with the other four states taking no action. No other state endorsed the Resolutions. The reason for the criticism was that the General Assembly, led in the effort by state-sovereignty advocate John Taylor of Caroline, had put a state-sovereignty spin on the Virginia Resolutions of 1798 despite Madison's hopes. These replies contended <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court of the United States had the ultimate responsibility for deciding whether federal laws were constitutional, and that the Alien and Sedition Acts were constitutional and necessary. The Federalists accused the Democratic-Republicans of seeking disunion, even contemplating violence. At the time, some leading Virginia Democratic-Republican figures such as Rep. William Branch Giles (in public) and Taylor (in private) actually were contemplating disunion, and the Virginia General Assembly chose this juncture for finally constructing a new state armory in Richmond, so there was some truth to the charge.|$|E
5|$|At the Casablanca Conference in January 1943, the Combined Chiefs of Staff {{agreed to}} {{establish}} a staff to plan operations in north west Europe in 1944. It was envisaged <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> Allied Commander would be British, and the usual practice was for the commander and {{the chief of staff}} to be of the same nationality, so it was decided to appoint a British officer for the role of chief of staff to the Supreme Allied Commander (Designate) (COSSAC), with an American deputy. In March 1943 Morgan became COSSAC. Brigadier General Ray Barker became his American deputy. Initially, Morgan's staff consisted of an aide, two batmen and a driver with a car purloined from I Corps headquarters. Morgan established his headquarters in Norfolk House at 31 St James's Square. However, by October 1943, it was clearly too small for COSSAC needs, which called for accommodation for a staff of 320 officers and 600 other ranks. In November and December part of the staff moved to the South Rotunda, a bombproof structure that had originally been fitted up as an anti-invasion base, which was connected to the various ministries by the Whitehall Tunnel. Other staff were accommodated at 80 Pall Mall.|$|E
5|$|Bruce was {{followed}} by Lawrence N. Maxwell, counsel for Beckham. Maxwell reiterated that the General Assembly had acted within its enumerated powers under the state constitution in deciding {{the outcome of the}} disputed election. He claimed that the decision of the state court of appeals made it clear that Taylor had not been legally elected governor, and therefore never possessed the property he was now claiming had been taken from him without due process. Maxwell further asserted that this disposed of any federal questions with regard to the case, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court could claim no jurisdiction. The decision of the state court of appeals should be allowed to stand, he concluded. Lewis McQuown further argued on behalf of Beckham that, even if Taylor's claim to the governorship were legitimate, the investigation and decision by the General Assembly's contest committee represented sufficient due process. He acknowledged that the Goebel Election Law's provision that the legislature be the arbiter of any contested gubernatorial election differed little if at all from provisions in as many as twenty other states. If the Goebel Election Law was constitutional, as it had before been declared, then the Supreme Court had no jurisdiction regarding how it had been administered.|$|E

5|$|Lezica {{informed}} Cisneros of {{the request}} for an open cabildo and the Viceroy consulted Leiva, who spoke in favor of it. The Viceroy summoned military commanders {{to come to the}} fort at 7pm, to demand military support. There were rumors that it could be a trap to capture them and take control of the barracks. To prevent this, they took command of the grenadiers that guarded the Fort and seized the keys of all entrances while meeting with the Viceroy. Colonel Cornelio Saavedra, head of the Regiment of Patricios, responded on behalf of all the criollo regiments. He compared the current international situation with that prevailing {{at the time of the}} mutiny of Álzaga over a year earlier, pointed out that Spain was now almost entirely under Napoleonic control and that the undefeated Spanish provinces were very small in comparison with the Americas. He rejected the claim of sovereignty of Cadiz over the Americas, and concluded that the local armies wanted to look after themselves, rather than following the fate of Spain. Finally, he pointed out <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> Central Junta that appointed Cisneros as Viceroy no longer existed, so he rejected Cisneros' legitimacy as Viceroy and denied him the protection of the troops under his command.|$|E
5|$|Milošević's {{trial at}} the ICTY {{revealed}} numerous declassified documents of Belgrade's {{involvement in the}} wars in Croatia and Bosnia. Evidence introduced at trial showed exactly how Serbia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia financed the war, that they provided weapons and material support to Bosnian and Croatian Serbs, and demonstrated the administrative and personnel structures set up to support the Bosnian Serb and Croatian Serb armies. It was established that Belgrade, through the federal government, financed more than 90 percent of the Krajina budget in 1993; <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> Defense Council decided to hide aid to Republika Srpska and Krajina from the public; that the National Bank of Krajina operated as a branch office of the National Bank of Yugoslavia; and that by March 1994 FR Yugoslavia, Krajina, and Republika Srpska used a single currency. Numerous documents demonstrated that branches of the Krajina Public Accountancy Service were incorporated into Serbia's accountancy system in May 1991, and that the financing of Krajina and Republika Srpska caused hyperinflation in FR Yugoslavia. The trial revealed that the JNA, the Serbian Ministry of Interior, and other entities (including Serb civilian groups and police) armed Serb civilians and local territorial defense groups in the RSK before the conflict escalated.|$|E
