5|$|Faced {{with the}} Kutrigur invasion, Justinian {{activated}} his alliance against the invaders, mobilizing the neighbouring Utigurs, {{who in turn}} asked for help from the allied Crimean Tetraxites. The latter invaded the Kutrigur homeland, {{taking advantage of the}} fact that many warriors were employed at that moment in <b>the</b> <b>Balkans.</b> Informed of the attack, the Kutrigurs were forced to leave <b>the</b> <b>Balkans</b> to defend their homeland on the north-western shore of the Black Sea.|$|E

5|$|The Greek {{campaign}} {{ended with}} a complete German and Italian victory.

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the {{development}} of access conditions for EU membership by comparing the eastern enlargement process and the current process for the states of <b>the</b> Western <b>Balkans.</b> <b>The</b> first chapter outlines the conditions, and major milestones of the eastern enlargement, the second chapter follows the strategy and conditions for <b>the</b> Western <b>Balkans.</b> <b>The</b> third part deals exclusively with the accession process of Croatia and its problem areas. The aim is to find out which form the current conditions for EU membership have and check whether it has tightened since the last enlargement...|$|R

5|$|The killings {{exacerbated}} {{tensions between}} the Partisans and Chetniks.

He therefore decided to scale back Chetnik guerrilla attacks and wait for an Allied landing in <b>the</b> <b>Balkans.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although the Palaeologi {{emperors}} recaptured Constantinople {{from the}} Western Europeans in 1261, {{they were never}} able to regain control of much of the former imperial lands. They usually controlled only a small section of the Balkan Peninsula near Constantinople, the city itself, and some coastal lands on the Black Sea and around the Aegean Sea. The former Byzantine lands in <b>the</b> <b>Balkans</b> were divided between the new Kingdom of Serbia, the Second Bulgarian Empire and the city-state of Venice. The power of the Byzantine emperors was threatened by a new Turkish tribe, the Ottomans, who established themselves in Anatolia in the 13th century and steadily expanded throughout the 14th century. The Ottomans expanded into Europe, reducing Bulgaria to a vassal state by 1366 and taking over Serbia after its defeat at the Battle of Kosovo in 1389. Western Europeans rallied to the plight of the Christians in <b>the</b> <b>Balkans</b> and declared a new crusade in 1396; a great army was sent to <b>the</b> <b>Balkans,</b> where it was defeated at the Battle of Nicopolis. Constantinople was finally captured by the Ottomans in 1453.|$|E
5|$|Barrons' {{early career}} {{was spent in}} various staff and field posts in the UK, across Europe, and in the Far East. He also spent time working at the Ministry of Defence and in education.

Returning to the UK, Barrons took up a staff {{position}} and went on to do a tour in Northern Ireland and then to become a Military Assistant, first to the High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina and then to the Chief of the General Staff. Between 2000 and 2003, Barrons served again in <b>the</b> <b>Balkans,</b> in Afghanistan during the early days of International Security Assistance Force, and then in a staff position in Basra, Iraq.|$|E

5|$|Ferdinand was {{a complex}} plan, {{involving}} misinformation and extensive physical deception. The underlying plot was the Allied forces had been {{surprised to find}} the Germans had not moved forces from the Mediterranean to re-inforce Normandy. Therefore, plans to invade southern France and <b>the</b> <b>Balkans</b> were looking less appealing. Instead the Allied commanders had decided to focus all of their resources on the Italian campaign. The real force assigned to Dragoon, the US VI Corps, would land in Genoa. Meanwhile, notional formations, such as the Seventh Army and the British 5th Airborne Division would support pushes along the Italian front and threaten targets in <b>the</b> <b>Balkans.</b> Ferdinand also recycled some of Zeppelin's threats against Turkey with the fictional British Ninth and Twelfth Armies.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, if Diocletian {{ever did}} enter Rome {{shortly after his}} accession, he did not stay long; he is attested back in <b>the</b> <b>Balkans</b> by 2 November 285, on {{campaign}} against the Sarmatians.|$|E
5|$|Operation Dragoon was {{controversial}} {{from the}} time it was first proposed. The American military leadership and its British counterparts disagreed on the operation. Winston Churchill argued against it {{on the grounds that it}} diverted military resources that were better deployed for Allied operations in Italy; instead, he favored an invasion of the oil-producing regions of <b>the</b> <b>Balkans.</b> Churchill reasoned that by attacking <b>the</b> <b>Balkans,</b> the Western Allies could deny Germany petroleum, forestall the advance of the Red Army of the Soviet Union, and achieve a superior negotiating position in post-war Europe, all at a stroke.|$|E
40|$|This Bachelor thesis evaluates {{and compares}} {{the impact of}} EU and CEFTA on the {{refinement}} of business and investment environment of <b>the</b> Western <b>Balkans.</b> <b>The</b> first chapter examines the impact of EU in terms of trade ties, financial help and adoption of EU standards.

40|$|At {{the turn}} of the last century, outward tranquillity was {{bestowed}} upon <b>the</b> Western <b>Balkans,</b> <b>the</b> most volatile and troublesome part of the European continent. The termination of large scale violence, however, did not add up to long-term stability in the region. Its political elites have proven to be incapable and/or unwilling to resolve their differences among themselves and peacefully in order to provide for the region’s security. The management of the most burning problems in <b>the</b> Western <b>Balkans</b> would be best assured within the process of European integration. With active and well-coordinated roles played by key international organizations, <b>the</b> Western <b>Balkans</b> could eventually be transformed into a region of security, democracy, and prosperity...|$|R

5|$|The British seized her in {{an action}} on 25 September 1806, and the Royal Navy took Minerve into service as Alceste in March 1807; Alceste then {{continued}} to serve throughout the Napoleonic Wars. On 29 November 1811, Alceste led a British squadron that captured a French military convoy carrying more than 200 cannon to Trieste in <b>the</b> <b>Balkans.</b> After this loss, Napoleon changed {{the direction of his}} planned eastward expansion in 1812 from <b>the</b> <b>Balkans</b> to Russia. The British historian James Henderson has suggested that the two events were linked, and may have changed the course of the war.|$|E
5|$|The Bulgarians, who by 922 were {{in control}} of most of <b>the</b> <b>Balkans,</b> {{continued}} to ravage the Byzantine countryside virtually unopposed. However, they lacked the maritime power to conduct a successful siege of Constantinople. The subsequent attempts to negotiate a Bulgarian–Arab alliance for a joint assault of Constantinople were discovered by the Byzantines and successfully countered. The strategic situation in <b>the</b> <b>Balkans</b> remained unchanged until both sides signed a peace treaty in 927, which recognized the imperial title of the Bulgarian monarchs and the complete independence of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church as an autocephalous Patriarchate.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> Western <b>Balkans</b> have {{historically}} been a poor area of Europe. The total population of <b>the</b> Western <b>Balkans</b> is 24. 7 million. Ethnic differences of long standing have led to conflicts and to political and economic instability. Poverty and instability have combined to produce a vicious circle of institutional backwardness. Recent conflicts in Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo have aggravated an already adverse economic situation. GDP in 1999 was substantially lower than that in 1989. The EU plans to enter into contractual relationships with all <b>the</b> Western <b>Balkans</b> in <b>the</b> form of Stabilization and Association Agreements (SAAs). The pacts are aimed at helping to establish economic and political stability, to implement institutional reforms, to practice regional free trade and cooperation and to privatize the economies of Western Balkans. These are also the presumed goals of <b>the</b> Western <b>Balkans.</b> This study focuses on {{a review of the}} progress made by <b>the</b> Western <b>Balkans</b> toward meeting <b>the</b> above stated challenges. A main conclusion is that the attainment of these goals has been asymmetrical for economic, political and institutional reasons. ...|$|R
