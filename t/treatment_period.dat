40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{number of}} asthma related <b>treatment</b> <b>periods</b> in {{hospital}} {{has increased in}} many countries, particularly among children. The aim of the present investigation was to describe the use made of hospital services by asthmatic patients {{over a wide range}} in Finland. METHODS: A total of 255, 387 <b>treatment</b> <b>periods</b> for asthma that had occurred between 1972 and 1986 was collected from the discharge register maintained by the National Board of Health (diagnosis 493, International Classification of Diseases). The numbers of admissions, days in hospital, and new occurrences of asthma were calculated by sex and age in relation to the total population {{at the end of each}} year. RESULTS: Asthma induced <b>treatment</b> <b>periods</b> in hospital in Finland were 12, 860 (277 <b>treatment</b> <b>periods</b> per 100, 000 inhabitants) in 1972 and 20, 000 (406 per 100, 000 inhabitants) in 1986. The annual increase in the number of such periods was 4. 7 % for men (95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 3. 5 to 5. 9 %) and 3. 4 % for women (2. 1 to 4. 7 %) in relation to population. The most pronounced change was found in those aged 65 years and over, in which the number of <b>treatment</b> <b>periods</b> was found to increase annually by 7. 5 % (6. 0 to 9. 0 %) for men and 4. 9 % (3. 4 to 6. 5 %) for women, whereas the smallest increase was found among persons under 15 years with an annual change of 1. 3 % (0. 2 to 2. 3 %) for boys and 1. 1 % (- 0. 1 to 2. 4 %) for girls. Although the number of asthma related <b>treatment</b> <b>periods</b> increased, that of new patients with asthma did not. An average of 114 new male asthmatic patients per 100, 000 men were treated in hospitals annually between 1977 and 1986, whereas the figure for women was 115; the annual change during this 10 year period was 0. 2 % (- 0. 8 to 1. 2 %) for men and - 0. 8 % (- 1. 8 to 0. 2 %) for women. CONCLUSIONS: The increase in the number of asthma related hospital <b>treatment</b> <b>periods</b> seemed attributable to the frequent treatment of the same patients. <b>Treatment</b> <b>periods</b> for persons aged 40 years or over were found to increase most, suggesting that the treatment of these asthmatic patients should be optimised and its organisation improved...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This thesis {{discusses}} {{the age and}} sex distribution of previously hospitalised asthmatics {{and the number of}} new asthma-induced <b>treatment</b> <b>periods</b> as a proportion of all asthma-related hospital admissions. Seasonal fluctuations in <b>treatment</b> <b>periods</b> were analysed with respect to age, and seasonal fluctuations in mortality among previously hospitalised asthmatics by combining the hospital discharge register with the mortality statistics {{on the basis of the}} patients social security numbers. A total of 364, 871 asthma-induced <b>treatment</b> <b>periods</b> were reported to the hospital discharge register in 1972 - 1992, of which 192, 195 occurred in 1. 1. 1983 - 31. 12. 1992, and 28. 6 % of these were new cases. <b>Treatment</b> <b>periods</b> relative to population amounted to 2. 76 / 1000 in 1972 and 3. 43 / 1000 in 1992. The number of <b>treatment</b> <b>periods</b> among children was greatest at the age of 1 year, 11. 2 / 1000 for boys and 5. 5 / 1000 for girls, and lowest at 17 years among the boys, and 13 years among the girls. The numbers rose slowly in early adulthood (with the exception of men aged 18 - 22 years), reaching a new peak at 73 years of age for men, 10. 3 / 1000, and 75 years for women, 9. 5 / 1000, and decreasing gradually thereafter. A half of the <b>treatment</b> <b>periods</b> recorded for patients aged under 1 year or for men aged 20 years represented new cases, whereas otherwise the vast majority of the <b>treatment</b> <b>periods</b> were being readmissions. The seasonal peaks among the total of 59, 624 hospital periods involving persons aged under 15 years reported to the discharge register in 1972 - 1992 occurred in May and October, and the lowest figures in January and July. Conscripts aged 18 - 22 years experienced 4894 asthma-induced <b>treatment</b> <b>periods</b> in 1982 - 1992, representing incidence rates of 8. 5 / 1000 in 1982 and 27. 7 / 1000 in 1992. The figure was highest in the month in which the conscripts entered service and the month following that. A total of 81, 243 asthma-induced <b>treatment</b> <b>periods</b> were recorded for persons aged over 24 years in 1987 - 1992, the figures being highest in January-May, 18. 2 % above the monthly trend in January, and lowest in July, 26. 1 % below the monthly trend. 7622 of the asthmatics first admitted in 1977 - 1992 died at an age of over 24 years in 1987 - 1993, mortality being highest in December and January and lowest in August. Obstructive pulmonary diseases were the primary cause of death for 1283 persons, including 489 who died of asthma itself. Apart from children and men aged 18 - 22 years, asthma gives rise to a large number of <b>treatment</b> <b>periods</b> among the middle-aged and the elderly. Measures should be taken to diagnose it at an early stage in these groups and to intensify the treatment provided. In addition, the factors provoking asthma during military service should be minimised and preventive measures enhanced in the case of children in May and September. As far as adults are concerned, asthma-related hospitalisation may involve a greater fatality risk in winter, so that aggravations occurring in winter should be treated with particular care...|$|R
40|$|Abstract A {{study is}} made {{of the volume of}} {{hospital}} treatment provided for cases of pneumonia in Finland from 1972 to 1993, employing as a source the National Hospital Discharge Register. The results are used to predict changes in the utilization of hospital resources in this respect up to the year 2020. A total of 452 474 <b>treatment</b> <b>periods</b> and 5 935 615 hospitalization days attributable to pneumonia were recorded for the total population over the given period, of which just under 20 % applied to children aged under 15 years, over 30 % to persons of working age, 15 - 64 years, and over 50 % to elderly persons aged 65 years and over. The mean duration of hospitalization was reduced from 18. 4 days to 14. 3 days for males and from 19. 6 days to 17. 5 days for females over the period in question. The number of <b>treatment</b> <b>periods</b> for pneumonia in children per year relative to population decreased by 28. 3 %, the greatest reduction being in the group under one year of age, 5. 7 % for boys and 5. 5 % for girls. The mean duration of treatment decreased from 9. 6 days to 4. 1 days for boys and 9. 7 days to 4. 3 days for girls. The numbers of <b>treatment</b> <b>periods</b> and hospitalization days were consistently greater for men than for women in the working-age population, the difference between the sexes being most pronounced in the age group 15 - 24 years, where the number of <b>treatment</b> <b>periods</b> for men was 7. 2 times that for women. Likewise, the number of <b>treatment</b> <b>periods</b> for men began to increase with age from 40 years onwards and that for women from 50 years onwards. The mean treatment time for patients of working-age decreased over the period studied, from 10. 5 days to 8. 2 days for men and from 9. 9 days to 8. 2 days for women. The duration of treatment similarly increased with advancing age. The absolute numbers of <b>treatment</b> <b>periods</b> increased by 139 % among the elderly population, even when standardized for age, whereas the number of hospitalization days diminished. The clearest increase in <b>treatment</b> <b>periods</b> of all was recorded for men aged over 84 years, 3. 16 %. The mean duration of treatment increased with age in both sexes, being significantly longer for women than for men in each age group. The forecast for changes in the utilization of hospital services for the treatment of pneumonia up to the year 2020 was examined by methods based on both an age structure model and a time series model. Both predicted an increase of over 50 % in the total number of <b>treatment</b> <b>periods</b> for the population as a whole, being of the order of 70 % for men and 30 % for women. The predicted increase in the age group over 64 years was in excess of 90 % with both models. The use of hospital services for the treatment of childhood pneumonia decreased significantly over the period examined here, while the majority of the <b>treatment</b> <b>periods</b> recorded for the working-age population concerned young men or persons aged over 40 years. The most significant increase was seen in <b>treatment</b> <b>periods</b> for persons aged over 64 years, and this figure is also predicted to increase in the future, on account of the frequent use made of hospital services by the elderly in general.
