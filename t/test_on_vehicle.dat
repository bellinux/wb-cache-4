40|$|In the Netherlands, {{annually}} 185 cyclists and 70 pedestrians {{are killed}} in traffic accidents, {{half of which}} due to an accident with a passenger car. The project SaveCAP runs a Sensor Field <b>Test</b> <b>on</b> <b>vehicle</b> safety systems designed to protect cyclists and pedestrians, either by avoiding an accident or by actions such as deploying a windshield airbag. This pre-FOT (Field Operational Test) in two major Dutch cities was started, while in sustainable urban mobility, cyclists and pedestrians can play a major role. Improved safety for these vulnerable road users is necessary to persuade {{large numbers of people}} to change their current daily way of commuting. In many European cities, infrastructure is not yet optimized towards traffic flow and safety, for large numbers of cyclists and pedestrians. To improve traffic flow, focus should be on vehicle solutions and infrastructure improvements as well as on V 2 X (vehicle to vehicle or to infrastructure) communication. To improve safety for cyclists and pedestrians, the key is in a well balanced application of the full package of infrastructure design, training, increasing cyclist visibility and enhanced vehicle related solutions. When improving the “vulnerable road user friendliness” of passenger vehicles, intelligent systems can play a major role. SaveCAP aims at optimized triggering of various potential safety systems in the car. The Sensor Field Test is an important instrument in obtaining real life situations and thus in developing and evaluating a sensor system to detect and recognise pedestrians and cyclists, necessary for proper triggering of safety systems...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn a {{previous}} article, a simplified low- and medium-frequency model for uncertain automotive sound-insulation layers {{was developed and}} experimentally identified and validated. This model {{is based on a}} stochastic elastoacoustic element whose mean part comes from an extension of the fuzzy structures theory and depends on three physical parameters: the modal density, the damping rate and the participating mass. A non-parametric probabilistic approach is used to build the uncertainty-accounting stochastic simplified model. This model takes into account the modelling and system-parameters uncertainties and depends on three dispersion parameters. In this paper, the insulation simplified model is implemented in an industrial stochastic vibroacoustic model of a car.

40|$|In this paper, {{we address}} the problem of {{scheduling}} <b>tests</b> <b>on</b> <b>vehicle</b> prototypes using Constraint Programming. The problem originates in the automotive industry where a manufacturer must perform several hundreds of <b>tests</b> <b>on</b> prototypes before starting mass production of a vehicle. Each test must be allocated to an appropriate prototype with respect to hardware requirements. Further, it is necessary to observe various test dependencies. The manufacturer is interested in reducing the number of prototypes to save test costs and in minimizing the makespan in order to start the production as early as possible. We formulate the problem using Constraint Programming with the makespan being the primary objective. The number of prototypes is a parameter which must be specified before starting the optimization procedure. Using exemplary input data given from a car manufacturer, we solve this single objective optimization problem several times for different values of our parameter to determine the relation between the number of prototypes and the corresponding makespan. We are able to either find the optimal solution or at least a good feasible solution within a reasonable computational time even for our largest problem size comprising about five hundreds tests and more than one hundred prototypes...|$|R
