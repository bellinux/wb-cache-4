5|$|The asteroids are not {{samples of}} <b>the</b> <b>primordial</b> Solar System.

5|$|A {{recurring}} theme in these myths is {{the effort of}} the gods to maintain maat {{against the forces of}} disorder. They fight vicious battles with the forces of chaos at the start of creation. Ra and Apep, battling each other each night, continue this struggle into the present. Another prominent theme is the gods' death and revival. The clearest instance where a god dies is the myth of Osiris' murder, in which that god is resurrected as ruler of the Duat. The sun god is also said to grow old during his daily journey across the sky, sink into the Duat at night, and emerge as a young child at dawn. In the process he comes into contact with the rejuvenating water of Nun, <b>the</b> <b>primordial</b> chaos. Funerary texts that depict Ra's journey through the Duat also show the corpses of gods who are enlivened along with him. Instead of being changelessly immortal, the gods periodically died and were reborn by repeating the events of creation, thus renewing the whole world. But it was always possible for this cycle to be disrupted and for chaos to return. Some poorly understood Egyptian texts even suggest that this calamity is destined to happen—that the creator god will one day dissolve the order of the world, leaving only himself and Osiris amid <b>the</b> <b>primordial</b> chaos.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{document}} differential {{distributions of}} phytomolecules by comparing antioxidant capacities, total phenolic contents, flavonoid contents and {{the identities of}} bioactive molecules on four phases of Pleurotus djamor. Methods: Several methods including in vitro quantitative methods such as aluminium chloride spectrophotometric for flavonoids, Folin-Ciocalteu assay for phenolics, spectrometric methods for lycopene, β-carotene and carotenoids, and several antioxidant methods, ferric ion reducing antioxidant power assay (FRAP); 2, 2 ’-azino-bis (3 -ethylbenzothiazoline- 6 -sulfonic acid (ABTS); and 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), were used. Besides, liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry and ChemSpider database for the tentative identification of the compounds was utilized. Results: The total phenol contents in the 1 st and 2 nd primordial phases from ethanol and aqueous extracts were (14. 369 ± 0. 495), (11. 470 ± 0. 532) and (19. 025 ± 0. 847) and (14. 824 ± 0. 890) mg gallic acid equivalent/g dry weight, respectively. The total flavonoid contents ranged from (3. 311 ± 0. 730) to (14. 824 ± 0. 890) mg quercetin equivalent/g dry weight. <b>The</b> second <b>primordials</b> phase recorded <b>the</b> highest total carotenoid content [(3. 926 ± 0. 059) ug/mL dry weight]. The extracts were deprived of lycopene, β-carotene and total carotenoids. However, <b>the</b> <b>primordials</b> reported relatively high contents of all molecules tested. The antioxidant capacity based on FRAP, ABTS and DPPH assays showed that <b>the</b> <b>primordials</b> exhibited more significant capacities in scavenging for these radicals than the mycelia and fruiting phases. The correlation between FRAP, ABTS, DPPH and total phenolic content, total flavonoid content, lycopene, β-carotene were positive and significant (r > 0. 8, P < 0. 05). Liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis identified sixteen compounds using ChemSpide database. Phenolic acids, such as protocatechuic, hydroxycinnamic acid and stilbenes, and the flavonoids belonging to flavones, flavanones, isoflavone and anthocyanins were identified. The peak areas indicated significantly higher contents in <b>the</b> <b>primordials</b> phases for all compounds.

5|$|Based on estimations of <b>the</b> <b>primordial</b> mass {{required}} to form Uranus and Neptune, {{as well as}} bodies as large as Pluto (see below), earlier models of the Kuiper belt had suggested {{that the number of}} large objects would increase by a factor of two beyond 50AU, so this sudden drastic falloff, known as the Kuiper cliff, was unexpected, and to date its cause is unknown. In 2003, Bernstein, Trilling, et al. found evidence that the rapid decline in objects of 100km or more in radius beyond 50AU is real, and not due to observational bias. Possible explanations include that material at that distance was too scarce or too scattered to accrete into large objects, or that subsequent processes removed or destroyed those that did. Patryk Lykawka of Kobe University claimed that the gravitational attraction of an unseen large planetary object, perhaps the size of Earth or Mars, might be responsible.|$|E
