5|$|A {{decorative}} pattern, {{designed in}} 1917 by Matrena Markevich, is {{displayed on the}} hoist of the flag (as it was previously, on the 1951 flag). The pattern, derived from local plants and flowers, is a traditional type commonly used in Belarus. <b>These</b> <b>patterns</b> are sometimes used in woven garments, most importantly in the traditional 'rushnyk', a woven cloth used for ceremonial events like religious services, funerals, and other more mundane social functions, such as a host offering guests bread and salt served on a rushnyk.|$|E
5|$|At first, CBS {{refused to}} pay Larson, {{considering}} him a cheater. However, Brockman and the producers {{could not find a}} clause in the game's rules with which to disqualify him (largely because the board had been constructed with <b>these</b> <b>patterns</b> {{from the beginning of the}} series), and the network complied. Because he had surpassed the CBS winnings cap (at the time) of $25,000, Larson was not allowed to return for the next show.|$|E

5|$|Patterns {{in nature}} are visible regularities of form {{found in the}} natural world. <b>These</b> <b>patterns</b> recur in {{different}} contexts and can sometimes be modelled mathematically. Natural patterns include symmetries, trees, spirals, meanders, waves, foams, tessellations, cracks and stripes. Early Greek philosophers studied pattern, with Plato, Pythagoras and Empedocles attempting to explain order in nature. The modern understanding of visible patterns developed gradually over time.|$|E
5|$|The {{beginning}} of the late stage is marked {{by the use of}} simple 16-point patterns at the Hasan Sadaqah mausoleum in Cairo in 1321, and in the Alhambra in Spain in 1338–1390. <b>These</b> <b>patterns</b> are rarely found outside these two regions. More elaborate combined 16-point geometrical patterns are found in the Sultan Hasan complex in Cairo in 1363, but rarely elsewhere. Finally, 14-point patterns appear in the Jama Masjid at Fatehpur Sikri in India in 1571–1596, but in few other places.|$|E
5|$|<b>These</b> <b>patterns</b> – a few common {{species and}} many rare ones; the {{dominance}} of arthropods and sponges; and the percentage frequencies of different life-styles – seem to apply {{to all of the}} Burgess Shale. However the identity of the dominant species differs between sites. For example, Marrella splendens is often credited as the commonest animal in the Burgess Shale, because of its abundance among the specimens collected by Walcott, but is only the third-most abundant organism in the Greater Phyllopod Bed, and very rare at other localities.|$|E

5|$|As weather {{conditions}} shift due to climate change, bees change their behaviors. When it rains, bees {{do not go}} out and during extremely hot weather they try to gather water to keep the colony cool. Climatologists have predicted that the occurrence of extreme weather events (such as intense rainy seasons and prolonged drought) will increase as the climate continues to change. Additionally, in regions that experience increasingly more rain, pollen will be washed away more easily {{making it more difficult}} for bees to provide for their colonies. Meanwhile, in environments experiencing prolonged drought, flower environments may dwindle with dry weather. <b>These</b> <b>patterns</b> lead to less suitable and viable environments in which bees can thrive. A British journal published projections of plant diversity loss against spatial sensitivity; the researchers found major species loss {{in the southern part of}} the UK forcing bee colonies further north.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1970, {{a series}} of {{expansions}} were added to Ainsworth's original patterns. They include the following: B4 (1970), A/C (1985) D/disorganized (1986), B5 (1988, 1992) A+, C+, & Depressed (1992, 2010). At later ages, additional categories have been described. Each of <b>these</b> <b>patterns</b> reflects {{a different kind of}} attachment relationship of the infant with the mother/caregiver. An infant may have a different pattern of attachment to each parent as well as to alternate caregivers. Pattern of attachment is thus {{not a part of the}} infant, but is characteristic of the protective and comforting quality of a specific relationship. These attachment patterns are associated with behavioral patterns and can help further predict a child's future personality.|$|E
5|$|Carolina wrens sing {{year round}} and {{at any point}} during the daytime, with the {{exception}} of performing during the most harsh weather conditions. The birds are also the only species in the Certhiidae family that neither sings in duet nor has their song control regions affect repertoire size. Males alone sing, and have a repertoire of at least twenty different phrase patterns and on average, thirty two. One of <b>these</b> <b>patterns</b> is repeated for several minutes, and although the male's song can be repeated up to twelve times, the general amount of songs range from three to five times in repetition. While singing, the tail of the birds is pointed downward. Some general vocalizations have been transcribed as teakettle-teakettle-teakettle and cheery-cheery-cheery. Various descriptions of the teakettle song include whee-udel, whee-udel, whee-udel, che-wortel, che-wortel and túrtee-túrtee-túrtee and familiar names and phrases such as sweet heart, sweet heart, come to me, come to me, sweet William, and Richelieu, Richelieu.|$|E
40|$|The {{production}} of Turkey red dyed and printed cottons {{was a major}} industry in the west of Scotland, particularly in the mid- to late nineteenth century. Although the extensive works were pulled down {{in the second half}} of the twentieth century, our knowledge of this industry is significantly aided by the survival of approximately 200 pattern books, now housed in the National Museums Scotland. <b>These</b> <b>pattern</b> books, examined along with business papers, exhibition catalogues and the Board of Trade Design Registers, are the foundation for a new study into the wider Scottish decorative textile industry. The ongoing examination of <b>these</b> <b>pattern</b> books has shown the variety and longevity of Turkey red dyed and printed patterns, as well as providing insights into wider aspects of the textile industry, including issues of design, manufacture and trade...|$|R

In particular the coupling rule for angular momentum takes an elementary form in terms of <b>these</b> modified <b>patterns.</b> <b>These</b> interrelations will be presented, together with an outline of the construction of a class of polynomials that generalizes the skew Schur functions...|$|R
50|$|Dating back to 1683, the New England Primer {{contained}} rhyming couplets {{for each}} {{letter of the}} alphabet. <b>These</b> <b>patterned</b> rhymes were often supported by gloomy woodcut illustrations. The content of these paired lines varied from overwhelmingly religious to somewhat secular depending upon the particular version of the New England Primer.|$|R
5|$|Leopards and ladybirds are spotted; {{angelfish}} and zebras are striped. <b>These</b> <b>patterns</b> have {{an evolutionary}} explanation: they have functions which {{increase the chances}} that the offspring of the patterned animal will survive to reproduce. One function of animal patterns is camouflage; for instance, a leopard that is harder to see catches more prey. Another function is signalling — for instance, a ladybird {{is less likely to}} be attacked by predatory birds that hunt by sight, if it has bold warning colours, and is also distastefully bitter or poisonous, or mimics other distasteful insects. A young bird may see a warning patterned insect like a ladybird and try to eat it, but it will only do this once; very soon it will spit out the bitter insect; the other ladybirds in the area will remain undisturbed. The young leopards and ladybirds, inheriting genes that somehow create spottedness, survive. But while these evolutionary and functional arguments explain why these animals need their patterns, they do not explain how the patterns are formed.|$|E
5|$|Many {{patterns}} in nature are formed by cracks in sheets of materials. <b>These</b> <b>patterns</b> {{can be described}} by Gilbert tessellations, also known as random crack networks. The Gilbert tessellation is a mathematical model {{for the formation of}} mudcracks, needle-like crystals, and similar structures. The model, named after Edgar Gilbert, allows cracks to form starting from randomly scattered over the plane; each crack propagates in two opposite directions along a line through the initiation point, its slope chosen at random, creating a tessellation of irregular convex polygons. Basaltic lava flows often display columnar jointing as a result of contraction forces causing cracks as the lava cools. The extensive crack networks that develop often produce hexagonal columns of lava. One example of such an array of columns is the Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland. Tessellated pavement, a characteristic example of which is found at Eaglehawk Neck on the Tasman Peninsula of Tasmania, is a rare sedimentary rock formation where the rock has fractured into rectangular blocks.|$|E
5|$|Sicilian church exteriors {{had been}} {{decorated}} in elaborate styles {{from the first}} quarter of the 17th century, with profuse use of sculpture, stucco, frescoes, and marble (Illustration 14). As the post-earthquake churches were becoming completed in the late 1720s, interiors also began to reflect this external decoration, becoming lighter and less intense (compare illustration 14 to the later interior of illustration 15), with profuse sculpted ornamentation of pillars, cornices, and pediments, often in the form of putti, flora, and fauna. Inlaid coloured marbles on floors and walls in complex patterns are one of the most defining features of the style. <b>These</b> <b>patterns</b> with their roundels of porphyry are often derived from designs found in the Norman cathedrals of Europe, again demonstrating the Norman origins of Sicilian architecture. The high altar is usually the pièce de resistance: in many instances a single block of coloured marble, decorated with gilt scrolls and swags, and frequently inset with other stones such as lapis lazuli and agate. Steps leading to the altar dais are characteristically curving between concave and convex and in many cases decorated with inlaid coloured marbles. One of the finest examples of this is in the church of St Zita in Palermo.|$|E
