5|$|The women's {{movement}} {{during the}} Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), like other movements in this period, came {{to depend on}} the cult of Mao Zedong. During the Cultural Revolution, the women’s movement was viewed as bourgeois and reactionary since it had originated in the West. The ACWF shutdown in 1968 because it was considered anti-revolutionary. The party argued that the women’s movement needed to be completely immersed in the revolutionary movement instead of harboring its own agenda. The offices of the ACWF were occupied by the army and many of the female cadres who had been involved with the women’s movement were sent to labor camps in the countryside. Women’s work ceased to function until the arrest of <b>the</b> <b>Gang</b> <b>of</b> Four in 1976.|$|E
5|$|David (Nolan North) is {{the leader}} of a group of cannibals that Ellie runs into at the Lakeside Resort where she is {{sheltering}} Joel while he recovers from a grievous wound. Initially, Ellie runs into him and a fellow hunter after killing a deer, and he offers to trade the deer for some penicillin for Joel. After he and Ellie are forced to fend off a swarm of infected, David reveals that he is actually the leader of <b>the</b> <b>gang</b> <b>of</b> hunters that Ellie and Joel had killed previously at the University of Eastern Colorado, when Joel was injured.

5|$|Although the CCC {{became a}} {{powerful}} political {{force in the}} following years, at the 8th National Congress in 1956 its inspectors were warned about abusing their power and becoming independent of their local party committees. Its power waned during the Great Leap Forward, but the CCC, the Secretariat and the Organisation Department became the chief weapons {{in the aftermath of}} the Great Leap to combat corruption and reverse verdicts on rightists. The CCC played its new role until the Cultural Revolution, a socio-political movement which lasted from 1966 until 1976, when it was affected by purges (partly due to its close ties to Peng Zhen, one of the first highly ranked officials purged during the Cultural Revolution). At the 9th National Congress in 1969 the CCC was abolished, removed from the party constitution and replaced by special-case organisations (such as the Central Case Examination Group) formed under Mao and Kang Sheng. Despite its abolition at the congress, little criticism was directed at the CCC during the Cultural Revolution; although CCC Deputy Secretary Min Yifan was criticised by the Red Guards, a revolutionary youth movement independent of the party (but inspired by Mao) during the Cultural Revolution, most of their disapproval focused on his career on local committees rather than the CCC. Talk of an internal party-control system would not resurface until the death of Mao and the arrest of <b>the</b> <b>Gang</b> <b>of</b> Four in 1976.|$|E
5|$|The book {{is divided}} into ten subject-related chapters. The first chapter {{provides}} an introduction to how Stursberg entered the CBC scene, how he viewed his role replacing the retiring Harold Redekopp as the executive {{vice president in charge}} of English services, and previews what challenges he would encounter. The second chapter covers his experience entering CBC senior management amid contract negotiations with its union, the resulting lock out during summer 2005, and the relations between what he labeled <b>the</b> <b>Gang</b> <b>of</b> Four (senior management) and the Central Committee (union representatives). In the third chapter, Entertainment, he explains his plan for re-orienting CBC television towards entertainment which would use audience numbers to gauge success. He cancelled critically acclaimed shows (Da Vinci's City Hall, This Is Wonderland, and Opening Night) which had low ratings and ordered what he expected would be more audience-friendly shows. Beginning in summer 2006, the first new show under Stursberg's strategy, , received very low ratings and was quickly cancelled. That Autumn's schedule, though, was successful, introducing Little Mosque on the Prairie, The Tudors, Heartland. The nest year's schedule introduced the successful The Border and Being Erica but also the unsuccessful MVP and jPod. Strusberg's move of Marketplace to Friday nights resulted in higher ratings but his plan to move The National to 11pm was denied by the CBC board of directors. In the fourth chapter, The French, he details his relationship with his French counterpart, the style differences between English and French television shows, the disproportionate funding given to the French services, and the lack of CBC Board members who can understand French. As a means of trying to bridge the two cultures, he ordered English versions of the popular Quebec shows Rumours and Sophie but both received low ratings in English Canada.|$|E
25|$|As Mao Zedong's health {{began to}} decline in 1971 and 1972, Zhou {{struggled}} against <b>the</b> <b>Gang</b> <b>of</b> Four internally over leadership of China. Zhou's health was also failing, however, and he died eight months before Mao on 8 January 1976. The massive public outpouring of grief in Beijing turned to anger towards <b>the</b> <b>Gang</b> <b>of</b> Four, leading to the Tiananmen Incident. Although succeeded by Hua Guofeng, Deng Xiaoping, Zhou's ally, was able to outmaneuver <b>the</b> <b>Gang</b> <b>of</b> Four politically and eventually take Hua's place as paramount leader by 1978.|$|E
