5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the 1986 U.S. attack, the army was purged of perceived disloyal elements, and in 1988, Gaddafi announced the creation of a popular militia to replace the army and police. In 1987, Libya began production of mustard gas at a facility in Rabta, although publicly denying it was stockpiling chemical weapons, and unsuccessfully attempted <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons.</b> The period also saw a growth in domestic Islamist opposition, formulated into groups like the Muslim Brotherhood and the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group. A number of assassination attempts against Gaddafi were foiled, and in turn, 1989 saw the security forces raid mosques believed to be centres of counter-revolutionary preaching. In October 1993, elements of the increasingly marginalized army initiated a failed coup in Misrata, while in September 1995, Islamists launched an insurgency in Benghazi, and in July 1996 an anti-Gaddafist football riot broke out in Tripoli. The Revolutionary Committees experienced a resurgence to combat these Islamists.|$|E

In addition, new nuclear power stations could be built, the waste management from which would be the private sector's financial responsibility, although all would be stored in a single facility. Most of the UK's higher-activity radioactive waste is currently held in temporary storage at Sellafield.|$|E
25|$|Iran {{consistently}} {{claimed that}} {{its nuclear program}} is purely for civilian purposes, {{and that it has}} no intention of ever utilizing its peaceful nuclear program <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons.</b> During the course of Iran's recent history, specifically during the Iran-Iraq war, Iran has experienced significant outages of its commercial electricity grid. Iran has also continuously claimed that it intends to ultimately export part of the electricity produced by its nuclear reactors to its regional neighbors, as a way of diversifying its mainly oil-based economy to more diversified revenue streams.|$|E

25|$|Iran {{has had a}} {{civilian}} nuclear program since before the 1979 revolution. However, since the revolution, {{there has been some}} worries that Iran could use this program <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons.</b> These worries have been raised by the revelation, on August 2002, by Alireza Jafarzadeh, a prominent associate of MKO, of the existence of two secret nuclear sites: a uranium enrichment facility in Natanz (part of which is underground), and a heavy water facility in Arak. There is however no proof at this stage that this program is not purely civilian.|$|E
25|$|The United States was not {{particularly}} {{in favor of a}} nuclear Sweden. The cooperation agreement between Sweden and the United States, that established bilateral safeguards for Swedish nuclear installations, forbade Sweden from using equipment and materials <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons.</b> In the meantime, the use of U.S. uranium would mean accepting inspection requirements, which would prevent the uranium in question from being used for weapons production. The more Sweden’s research in nuclear weapons was becoming dependent on U.S. military assistance, the more the United States was willing to steer Sweden away from implementing its plans to create a nuclear weapon.|$|E
25|$|Since King Abdullah's {{visit to}} Beijing in January 2006, Saudi-Chinese {{relations}} have focused predominantly {{on energy and}} trade. The king's visit was the first by a Saudi head of state to China since the two countries established diplomatic ties in 1990. Bilateral trade with China has more than tripled, and China would soon be Saudi Arabia's largest importer. Saudi Arabia also committed significant investments in China, including the $8 billion Fujian refinery. Based on a WikiLeaks cable, the King told the Chinese that it was willing to effectively trade a guaranteed oil supply in return for Chinese pressure on Iran not <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons.</b>|$|E
5000|$|According to an August 2009 report {{published}} in the Sydney Morning Herald, Burma is working <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> a <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapon</b> by 2014. The reported effort, purportedly being undertaken with assistance from North Korea, involves {{the construction of a}} nuclear reactor and plutonium extraction facilities in caves tunneled into a mountain at Naung Laing, a village in the Mandalay division [...] The information cited in the newspaper story reportedly originated from two high-ranking defectors who had settled in Australia.|$|R
50|$|Within the United States the {{authority}} <b>to</b> produce and <b>develop</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> {{was removed from}} military control and put instead under the civilian control of the United States Atomic Energy Commission. This decision reflected an understanding that <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> had unique risks and benefits that were separate from other military technology known at the time.|$|R
5000|$|In 1997 Rhodes {{appeared}} in the UK Channel 4 TV series Equinox episode [...] "A Very British Bomb" [...] about the UK's efforts after the war <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> its own <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> after collaboration with the US had been halted by the 1946 MacMahon Act.|$|R
25|$|It {{may seem}} {{paradoxical}} that the Air Force changed opinion {{on nuclear weapons}} given {{the expansion of the}} relative importance of the US Air Force following America's adoption of nuclear weapons. At the time, however, the Air Force was facing an expensive acquisition of the Saab 37 Viggen, and feared that a full-scale nuclear weapons program would compete with it for resources. One of the points that Norén wanted to investigate was what conventional forces Sweden could acquire if it decided not <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons.</b> It should be noted that it was the plan that the United States suggested Sweden to follow in 1960. However, it remains unclear whether or not this suggestion influenced Sweden’s defense officials.|$|E
25|$|China's {{repeated}} {{threats to}} intervene in the conflict in support of Pakistan increased pressure on the government to take an immediate decision <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons.</b> Despite repeated assurances, the United States did little to prevent extensive use of American arms by Pakistani forces during the conflict, thus irking India. At the same time, the United States and United Kingdom refused to supply India with sophisticated weaponry which further strained the relations between the West and India. These developments led to a significant change in India's foreign policy– India, which had previously championed the cause of non-alignment, distanced itself further from Western powers and developed close relations with the Soviet Union. By the end of the 1960s, the Soviet Union emerged as the biggest supplier of military hardware to India. From 1967 to 1977, 81% of India's arms imports were from the Soviet Union. After the 1965 war, the arms race between India and Pakistan became even more asymmetric and India was outdistancing Pakistan by far.|$|E
25|$|In August 1939, Leo Szilard and Albert Einstein {{sent the}} Einstein–Szilárd letter to Roosevelt, {{warning of the}} {{possibility}} of a German project <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons.</b> Szilard realized that the recently discovered process of nuclear fission could be used to create a nuclear chain reaction that {{could be used as a}} weapon of mass destruction. Roosevelt feared the consequences of allowing Germany to have sole possession of the technology, and authorized preliminary research into nuclear weapons. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Roosevelt administration secured the funds needed to continue research and selected General Leslie Groves to oversee the Manhattan Project, which was charged with developing the first nuclear weapons. Roosevelt and Churchill agreed to jointly pursue the project, and Roosevelt helped ensure that American scientists cooperated with their British counterparts. In August 1945, the United States would drop nuclear weapons on two major Japanese cities, and Japan would surrender to the Allies in September 1945.|$|E
50|$|In 1969 {{a policy}} {{planning}} study for Japan's Foreign Ministry concluded that Japan should, {{even if it}} signed the NPT, maintain the economic and technical ability <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> and produce <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> in case it should ever become necessary, for example due to the international situation.|$|R
5000|$|... : In a statement, Foreign Minister Datuk Seri Syed Hamid Albar {{said that}} the test was a serious setback in keeping the world free from <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons.</b> He also said Malaysia calls on the DPRK <b>to</b> cease <b>developing</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> and return <b>to</b> the {{moratorium}} on nuclear testing. Earlier, he had said Malaysia would not support any action by the United Nations as North Korea has suffered enough and that even though Malaysia sympathised with North Korea, the only way ahead was to resume dialogue. He urged Russia and China {{to put pressure on}} North Korea to return to the six party talks.|$|R
25|$|It was Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy's premiership when Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) was {{established}} by a Parliamentary Act of 1956. Suhrawardy renounced <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> the <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons,</b> and disassociated scientific research on the <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons,</b> after signing the Atoms for Peace programme. Suhrawardy approved the appointment of Dr. Nazir Ahmad, an experimental physicist, as the first Chairman. Suhrawardy asked the PAEC to survey the site to establish the commercial nuclear power plants. Suhrawardy upgraded the government rank, and extended the appointment of Salimuzzaman Siddiqui as his government's Science Advisor.|$|R
500|$|The {{possibility}} {{of nuclear weapons}} was acknowledged early in the war. At the University of Birmingham, Rudolf Peierls and Otto Frisch co-wrote a memorandum explaining that a small mass of pure uranium-235 {{could be used to}} produce a chain reaction in a bomb with the power of thousands of tons of TNT. This {{led to the formation of}} the MAUD Committee, which called for an all-out effort <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons.</b> Wallace Akers, who oversaw the project, chose the deliberately misleading name [...] "Tube Alloys". His Tube Alloys Directorate was part of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research.|$|E
500|$|China's {{nuclear test}} of 1964, {{as well as}} its {{repeated}} threats to intervene in support of Pakistan in the 1965 war, convinced India <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons.</b> India conducted its first nuclear weapons test in 1974 and carried out further underground testing in 1998. Despite criticism and military sanctions, India has signed neither the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty nor the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, considering both to be flawed and discriminatory. India maintains a [...] "no first use" [...] nuclear policy and is developing a nuclear triad capability as a part of its [...] "minimum credible deterrence" [...] doctrine. It is developing a ballistic missile defence shield and, in collaboration with Russia, a fifth-generation fighter jet. Other indigenous military projects involve the design and implementation of Vikrant-class aircraft carriers and Arihant-class nuclear submarines.|$|E
500|$|The {{proliferation}} of thermonuclear weapons {{coincided with a}} rise in public concern about nuclear fallout debris contaminating food sources, particularly the threat of high levels of strontium-90 in milk (see the Baby Tooth Survey). This survey was a [...] "campaign [...] effectively employed a variety of media advocacy strategies" [...] to alarm the public and [...] "galvanized" [...] support against atmospheric nuclear testing. Lewis Strauss and Edward Teller, dubbed the [...] "father of the hydrogen bomb," [...] both sought to tamp down on these fears, arguing that fallout [...] were fairly harmless and that a test ban would enable the Soviet Union to surpass the US in nuclear capabilities. Teller also suggested that testing was necessary <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> that produced less fallout. While Teller would largely win the contemporary televised debates of 1958 with Linus Pauling, on technical grounds, The emotive [...] "media advocacy strategies", of which the tooth survey is a prominent example, were to cause support in the US public for a test ban {{to continue to grow}} from 20% in 1954 to 63% by 1957. Moreover, widespread antinuclear protests were organized and led by theologian and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Albert Schweitzer, whose appeals were endorsed by Pope Pius XII, and Linus Pauling, the latter of whom organized an anti-test petition signed by more than 9,000 scientists across 43 countries (including the infirm and elderly Albert Einstein). Although notably, many health scientists that were asked to sign were critical of Pauling's [...] "thoroughly unscientific" [...] fallout assumptions, despite most wishing for a test-ban for other reasons, they could not bring themselves to sign a document that promoted such exaggerations of the dangers, as it would result in eventual public distrust of scientists in the long term.|$|E
40|$|Between 1946 and 1950 the UN {{worked on}} a plan for {{preventing}} the spread of <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons.</b> The plan would put strong limitations to and control over independent states abilities <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>nuclear</b> energy and <b>weapons.</b> This plan gained support from many western states.
