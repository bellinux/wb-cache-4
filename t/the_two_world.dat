During World War I, he was an instructor at the School of Fire at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, and did not serve in France until after the November 11 armistice ended the fighting, when he attended the French artillery school at Treves. Between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>world</b> wars he was a staunch advocate of mechanization {{at a time when}} the idea of phasing out horses met strong resistance from conservative gunners.|$|E
5|$|Following his discharge, Newland {{retained}} {{the rank of}} captain and returned to service with the permanent military forces. Between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>world</b> wars, he held various appointments in the army, including adjutant and quartermaster of the 8th, 49th, 52nd, 38th and 12th Battalions, as well as area officer and recruiting officer.

5|$|In the 20th century Scotland {{made a major}} {{contribution}} to the British participation in <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>world</b> wars and suffered relative economic decline, which only began to be offset with the exploitation of North Sea Oil and Gas from the 1970s {{and the development of}} new technologies and service industries. This was mirrored by a growing sense of cultural and political distinctiveness, which {{towards the end of the}} century, culminated in the establishment of a separate Scottish Parliament within the confines of the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|In the 20th century, Scotland {{played a}} major role in the British and allied effort in <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>world</b> wars and began to suffer a sharp {{industrial}} decline, going through periods of considerable political instability. The decline was particularly acute in the second half of the 20th century, but was compensated for to a degree by the development of an extensive oil industry, technological manufacturing and a growing service sector. This period also increasing debates about the place of Scotland within the United Kingdom, the rise of the Scottish National Party and after a referendum in 1999 the establishment of a devolved Scottish Parliament.|$|E

5|$|Messiaen's {{music was}} {{by this time}} championed by, among others, Pierre Boulez, who {{programmed}} first performances at his Domaine musical concerts and the Donaueschingen festival. Works performed included Réveil des oiseaux, Chronochromie (commissioned for the 1960 festival) and Couleurs de la cité céleste. The latter piece {{was the result of}} a commission for a composition for three trombones and three xylophones; Messiaen added to this more brass, wind, percussion and piano, and specified a xylophone, xylorimba and marimba rather than three xylophones. Another work of this period, Et exspecto resurrectionem mortuorum, was commissioned as a commemoration of the dead of <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>World</b> Wars and was performed first semi-privately in the Sainte-Chapelle, then publicly in Chartres Cathedral with Charles de Gaulle in the audience.|$|E
