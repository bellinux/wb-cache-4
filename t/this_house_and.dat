5|$|According to the Tantara ny Andriana eto Madagasikara {{transcription}} of Merina oral histories, {{the first}} house built by Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana was called Bevato. It was {{located at the}} southern extreme of the compound and housed the king and his wives. Andriambelomasina built and occupied a second house, called Manatsaralehibe ("large and great"). This house was highly venerated by Andrianampoinimerina: escaped convicts who managed to reach the building were pardoned, {{and this was the}} only historic house in the compound that Ranavalona I did not remove. According to a second source, the two oldest houses in the compound were called Mahitsielafanjaka ("one who is upright rules long") and Manatsarakely ("small and great"). These were reportedly built by either Andriamborona or Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana in the early 18th century and were occupied by Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana and his 12 wives. Another account states that Manatsarakely was inhabited by Andrianjafy and later by the wives of Andrianampoinimerina; <b>this</b> <b>house</b> <b>and</b> Mahitsielafanjaka were renovated under Ranavalona I using wood from the region of Sihanaka to repanel the walls.|$|E

25|$|Because of {{intervention}} by Kahlo and Rivera, Russian Leon Trotsky obtained asylum in Mexico. Trotsky and his wife, Natalia Sedova, were first housed in La Casa Azul starting in January 1937. The windows facing the street were closed in with adobe bricks for Trotsky’s safety {{as he was}} under a death sentence from Stalin. A high wall was built between <b>this</b> <b>house</b> <b>and</b> the adjoining one as well. From January 1937 to April 1939, Trotsky lived and worked here, writing treatises such as Su moral y la nuestra and his regular political articles. This would often cause security problems in the area, due to the hostility of Trotsky's political enemies. During all of this time, the house {{continued to be a}} meeting place for intellectuals, especially those associated with Communism. In April 1939, Trotsky and Sedova left the Blue House after Trotsky had a falling out with Rivera over ideology and Rivera’s criticism of Trotsky’s writings, moving to a nearby house on Viena Street.|$|E

500|$|The Reform Act {{strengthened}} the House of Commons {{by reducing the}} number of nomination boroughs controlled by peers. [...] Some aristocrats complained that, in the future, the government could compel them to pass any bill, simply by threatening to swamp the House of Lords with new peerages. The Duke of Wellington lamented: [...] "If such projects can be carried into execution by a minister of the Crown with impunity, {{there is no doubt that}} the constitution of <b>this</b> <b>House,</b> <b>and</b> of this country, is at an end. [...] here is absolutely an end put to the power and objects of deliberation in <b>this</b> <b>House,</b> <b>and</b> an end to all just and proper means of decision." [...] The subsequent history of Parliament, however, shows that the influence of the Lords was largely undiminished. They compelled the Commons to accept significant amendments to the Municipal Reform Bill in 1835, forced compromises on Jewish emancipation, and successfully resisted several other bills supported by the public. It would not be until decades later, culminating in the Parliament Act 1911, that Wellington's fears would come to pass.|$|E
500|$|The Benjamin Church House is {{historically}} significant as a [...] "very pure example" [...] of the Colonial Revival style by noted local architects Clarke, Howe & Homer. The house {{also serves as}} an important asset to the Bristol environment as an elderly home, noted during its vacancy {{at the time of}} its nomination. The nomination states [...] "t is because of the environmental and architectural importance of <b>this</b> <b>house</b> <b>and</b> its significance in the greater context of the Bristol-Warren historic districts that it is thought to be worthy of National Register status and protection." [...] It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on September 22, 1971.|$|E
500|$|In the December 1938 elections, the United Opposition led by Maček had {{attracted}} 44.9 per {{cent of the}} vote, but due to the electoral rules by which the government parties received 40 per cent of {{the seats in the}} National Assembly before votes were counted, the opposition vote only translated into 67 seats {{out of a total of}} 373. On 3 February 1939, the Minister of Education, Bogoljub Kujundžić, made a nationalist speech in the Assembly in which he stated that [...] "Serb policies will always be the policies of <b>this</b> <b>house</b> <b>and</b> this government." [...] Head of the Yugoslav Muslim Organization (JMO) Mehmed Spaho asked Stojadinović to disavow the statement, but he did not. At the behest of the Senate leader, the Slovene Anton Korošec, that evening five ministers resigned from the government, including Korošec. The others were Spaho, another JMO politician Džafer Kulenović, the Slovene Franc Snoj, and the Serb Dragiša Cvetković.|$|E

500|$|Adams {{made his}} first {{official}} visit to the nation's new seat of government in early June 1800. Amid the [...] "raw and unfinished" [...] cityscape, the president found the public buildings [...] "in a much greater forwardness of completion than expected." [...] He moved into the nearly completed President's Mansion (later known as the White House) on November 1. Abigail arrived a few weeks later. Upon arriving, Adams wrote to her, [...] "Before I end my letter, I pray Heaven to bestow the best of Blessings on <b>this</b> <b>House</b> <b>and</b> all that shall hereafter inhabit it. May none but honest and wise Men ever rule under this roof." [...] The Senate of the Sixth Congress {{met for the first}} time in the new Congress House (later known as the Capitol building) on November 17, 1800. Several days later, on November 22, Adams delivered his fourth State of the Union Address to a joint session of Congress in the Senate chamber.

2500|$|After Major {{came back}} from Maastricht with an opt-out from the Social Chapter and the single currency, Tebbit {{was one of the}} few MPs in the debate on 18 December 1991 to criticise the new powers the Community would acquire.

I got into horses since my wife is into them. We're raising Spanish and Portuguese bullfighting horses. The bloodline is 2000 years old. She's into breeding, but I just love riding.

2500|$|The {{history of}} the exilarchate falls {{naturally}} into two periods, separated {{by the beginning of}} the Arabic rule in Babylonia. Nothing is known about the office before the 2nd century, including any details about its founding or beginnings. It can merely be said in general that the golah, the Jews living in compact masses in various parts of Babylon, tended gradually to unite and create an organization, and that this tendency, together with the high regard in which the descendants of the house of David living in Babylon were held, brought it about that a member of this house was recognized as [...] "head of the golah." [...] The dignity became hereditary in <b>this</b> <b>house,</b> <b>and</b> was finally recognized by the state, and hence became an established political institution, first of the Arsacid and then of the Sassanid empire.|$|E
2500|$|In 2002, the Israeli Army used Nidal Abu Muihsein {{as a human}} shield, causing his death; Eitam {{called this}} “very moral”. In October 2005, Eitam opposed a Supreme Court of Israel ruling that banned the IDF from using Palestinians as human shields, stating that, [...] "Supreme court judges {{demonstrated}} today that their pity for the cruel will prove cruel to the merciful and will expose Israeli soldiers to more danger". In November 2006, he called for an expulsion of most Palestinians from the West Bank: [...] "Expel most of the Judea and Samaria Arabs from here. We cannot be with all these Arabs, and we cannot give up the land." [...] In March 2008, he called for the expulsion of Israeli Arab members of the Knesset: [...] "One day, we will expel you to Gaza from <b>this</b> <b>house</b> <b>and</b> from the national home of the Jewish people." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Green Room {{was shot}} in the fall of 1977 in Honfleur, France with a budget of 3 million francs {{provided}} by United Artists. That summer, Truffaut scouted locations and hired his longtime collaborator, Néstor Almendros, as cinematographer. To give the film a Gothic look, Almendros used candle light as both source and practical lighting, with electrical lights used to [...] "exploit the contrast between electric light and a flood of candlelight to give the film a ghostly quality." [...] Truffaut also intended a resulting lack of colour throughout filming, condemning colour as a removal of the final [...] "barrier" [...] between film and reality: [...] "If there is nothing false in a film, then it is not a film." [...] Almendros later said that, despite the film's somber tone, [...] "this film was put together with joy, and the shooting was the most pleasant" [...] of his career. Many of the scenes were shot in the four-story Maison Troublet in Honfleur. <b>This</b> <b>house</b> <b>and</b> its grounds included sets for many of the film's main locations: Davenne's house, his office at The Globe and the auction room.|$|E
2500|$|Hanjour {{first came}} to the United States in 1991 to study English at the University of Arizona's Center for English as a Second Language. Hanjour's eldest brother Abdulrahman helped him apply to the eight-week program, and found a room in Tucson, Arizona for Hanjour near the Islamic Center of Tucson. Hanjour arrived for the English {{language}} program on October 3, 1991, and stayed until early February 1992, when he returned to Saudi Arabia. [...] Hanjour shared a three-bedroom home on the corner of 4th Avenue and 4th Street owned and managed by a father-son team, who made a living renovating and renting rooms to international students and devoting their energies to spreading a born-again Christian influence; Bob, the oldest son, lived in <b>this</b> <b>house</b> <b>and</b> rented the room directly to Hanjour. [...] Hanjour was a model housemate; he was extremely respectful of others, apolitical in his points of view, enjoyed his Turkish coffee, and appeared as a nonchalant happy-go-lucky teenager with very weak English-speaking skills. [...] Hanjour claimed that he was interested in being an airplane mechanic and claimed that such a position was considered highly in Saudi Arabia. [...] Hanjour participated in morning, noon, and evening prayers at the local mosque. [...] As early as Hanjour moved into this house, he was under the constant watch of two [...] "uncles" [...] who would pick him up for the weekends so that he would spend time with them within their circle, thereby minimizing his contact with his American housemates and friends from the university. [...] In December 1991 Hanjour informed Bob that he missed Saudi Arabia and would be leaving the United States due to homesickness. Hanjour was the only hijacker to visit the United States prior to any intentions for a large-scale attack and he {{was not part of the}} Hamburg cell in Germany.|$|E
