40|$|Abstract — In modern {{decision}} science the Multiple attribute {{decision making}} (MADM) is playing {{an important role}} for selection of best from number of alternative. It has been applicable in various areas such as society, economics, military, management, manufacturing, etc., and has been receiving more and more attention over the last decades.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the result of}} an investigation into the cutting characteristics of electrical discharge machined (EDMed) surface-modified carbide cutting <b>tool</b> <b>inserts.</b> The <b>tool</b> <b>inserts</b> were coated with Titanium Nitride (TiN) by physical vapour deposition (PVD) method. In this study, comparative cutting tests using TiN coated control specimens with no EDM surface structures and TiN coated EDMed tools with a crater-like surface topography were carried out on mild steel. Various cutting speeds, up to an increase of 40 % of the tool manufacturer‘s recommended speed were investigated. Thirty cuts (passes) were carried out for each inserts at the speeds investigated. After every five cuts (passes), microscopic pictures of the tool wear profiles were taken in order to monitor the progressive wear on the rake face and, on the flank of the insert. The power load was monitored for each cut using an on board meter on the machine. Results obtained confirmed advantages of cutting at all speeds investigated using EDMed coated inserts in terms of reduced tool wear. Moreover, the surface finish on the work-piece was consistently better for the EDMed inserts. It is therefore concluded, that TiN coated EDMed crater-like surface structure on <b>tool</b> <b>inserts</b> can considerably improve the tool performance...|$|R

In Iteration 2, a slight cyclic pattern is observed. This {{is because of the}} reason that there is a constant progressive wear out of the boring bar insert on continued boring operation. After every ten components being machined, the boring bar insert must be compensated for the wear by elevating the insert by about five micrometers, over the diametric dimension. This exercise is performed {{with the help of a}} test mandrel and a boring bar <b>tool</b> <b>insert</b> setting Vee-block. Because of worn out Vee-surfaces of <b>tool</b> <b>insert</b> setting Vee-block, though the insert setting is done it is not accurate and this is reflected in the cyclic pattern observed in the second optimization step of Iteration 2. As a measure of corrective action, a new insert setting Vee-block is replaced with the old worn-out piece and the Vee surfaces of the Vee-Block are case hardened to achieve hardness up to 55 HRc with a case depth of 0.5 – 0.8  mm. In this iteration we see a marginal increase in CP to 1.32 and CPK to 0.90.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Past {{few decades}} have {{been marked by}} {{significant}} achievements {{in the development of}} cutting tools and machining processes. End-milling operation with Polycrystalline Diamond (PCD) cutting <b>tool</b> <b>insert</b> presents a good technical solution for machining “difficult-to-cut materials”. However, the cost of each technical or technological solution is a major concern in the decision making process. It is quite common for a solution developer to encounter a question like “How much will this new method cost? ” before proceeding for implementation. PCD insert applied as a cutting tool is a recent development and evaluation of economic performance of this cutting <b>tool</b> <b>insert</b> in end-milling of a-difficult-to-cut material such as Ti- 6 Al- 4 V titanium alloy can be of significant importance to the manufacturer. However, cost economy depends significantly on the correct choice of cutting conditions especially in the context of cutting parameters. To determine the economically desired levels of the cutting parameters for PCD insert to end-mill Titanium alloy we have presented a RSM-based mathematical model which would help to estimate the cost of removing unit volume of material and to find out the optimum cutting conditions leading to minimum machining cost...|$|E

40|$|Turning {{is one of}} the {{important}} machining processes in manufacturing industries. Tools wear during turning, {{is one of the}} major problems which may lead to production loss and machine down time. An effective tool wear monitoring method is therefore required to minimise the above. The work done in this thesis is related to the development of a new method for tool wear monitoring using tool-emitted sound signal in conjunction with newly reported Hilbert Huang Transform (HHT). In the proposed method, the condition of the cutting <b>tool</b> <b>insert</b> is monitored to classify its state into three different categories, namely, fresh, slightly worn and severely worn by analysing the tool-emitted audible sound. A trained competitive neural network is employed for this purpose. The network is trained by using the instantaneous amplitudes and instantaneous frequencies extracted from the tool-emitted sound using HHT. The novelty of the present work is the use of HHT to extract the instantaneous amplitudes and the frequencies of the tool-emitted sound to determine the condition of the cutting <b>tool</b> <b>insert</b> based on its flank wear. HHT is a recently developed signal processing technique more suitable for analysing nonstationary and nonlinear signals such as tool-emitted sound...|$|E

Numbers of wear models studies predicting the tool life length have been created throughout the metal-cutting history to better predict and thereby control the tool life span, which is a major portion of the total cost of machining.   A geometrical contact model defining the geometry of the flank wear growth on the cutting <b>tool</b> <b>inserts</b> was proposed and then compared with four suggested models, which estimates flank wear. The focus of this work is on the initial growth of flank wear process and thereby short cutting-time intervals are measured.   Wear tests on cutting <b>tool</b> <b>inserts</b> were performed after orthogonal turning of Ovako 825 B steel and were analysed by optical instrument, 3 D optical imaging in Alicona InfiniteFocus and EDS in SEM. Force measurements for cutting speeds, Vc, 150, 200, and 250 m/min and feed rate, fn, 0. 15 mm/rev were recorded as well.   Results show that initial flank wear land, VB, growth is dominated by sliding distance per cutting length for different cutting speeds. A good correlation between the geometrical contact model and estimation models is indentified. The cutting force measurements compared with the flank wear land show proportionality between two parameters. For the machining data in the present study the flank wear rate per sliding distance, dW/dL, is estimated to 2 x 103 (μ 3 /m) ...|$|R

Such materials have great demand in aerospace industry, marine industry, {{and nuclear power}} plants. It is particularly used in the hot sections like engines, because of their high strength and corrosion resistance at high temperature and pressure but they are the most difficult to machine materials. Their high strength possesses large amount of heat generation while machining, which reduce life of tool.
