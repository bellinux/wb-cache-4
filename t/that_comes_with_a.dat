25|$|A {{characteristic}} of the Merlot grape is the propensity to quickly overripen once it hits its initial ripeness level, sometimes {{in a matter of}} a few days. There are two schools of thought on the right time to harvest Merlot. The wine makers of Château Pétrus favor early picking to best maintain the wine's acidity and finesse as well as its potential for aging. Others, such as Rolland, favor late picking and the added fruit body <b>that</b> <b>comes</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> little bit of over-ripeness.|$|E

2500|$|Gone Girl's themes include dishonesty, the devious media, and the {{unhappiness}} <b>that</b> <b>comes</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> troubled economy. The characters lie to {{each other}} and the reader about affairs and disappearances. Amy fabricates a fake diary to implicate her husband for her disappearance and murder. Flynn says that, in writing the book, she wanted to examine how people within a marriage lie {{to each other}}: [...] "marriage is sort of like a long con, because you put on display your very best self during courtship, {{yet at the same time}} the person you marry is supposed to love you warts and all. But your spouse never sees those warts really until you get deeper into the marriage and let yourself unwind a bit." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a stark {{contrast}} to his previous films, Shyamalan's name was notably absent from trailers, TV commercials, and marketing signage. Instead, Sony Pictures opted to feature Will and Jaden Smith prominently in the marketing campaign. Sony's worldwide marketing and distribution chairman, Jeff Blake, said that [...] "Night is, without a doubt, a world-class filmmaker who we were thrilled to team up with on this project," [...] but [...] "Together, we decided to focus our campaign on both the action and Will and Jaden given that 'After Earth' is an adventure story of a father and son." [...] Alex Suskind of Moviefone pointed out to Shyamalan that After Earth was not being marketed on the strength of his name unlike his previous projects, to which he responded, [...] "There's such a specific expectation <b>that</b> <b>comes</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> name. It's nice to have people watch the movie and then have them talk about the storyteller; it's a healthy balance." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although {{it was not}} planned, Zsa Zsa {{was given}} a {{personality}} {{similar to that of}} her on-screen aunt, Shirley Carter (Linda Henry), an established character in EastEnders. During the development of the character, she changed a lot and was fluid until filming started, when Kenny had a full day on set with Henry. She explained: [...] "The words were there and I knew what she was like but when I saw Linda [...] speak and when I engaged with her, I realised that it was like looking in a mirror." [...] When the character was announced, she was described as beautiful, funky, an outspoken tomboy, very bright, but likes to think she does not need anybody's help. Kenny said of the character in an interview with Soaplife magazine: [...] "Zsa Zsa doesn't like authority or anyone who messes with her. She's a lone wolf and doesn't care about anyone." [...] She told entertainment website Digital Spy that Zsa Zsa is [...] "a real bitch" [...] and [...] "very mean and cold", while a profile for the character on the official EastEnders website says she is sarcastic, a rebel and [...] "desperately wants the security <b>that</b> <b>comes</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> family but is terrified of being dependent on anyone. Her experience has taught her that adults let you down." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{circle of}} ideas in which Marx moved {{was that of}} a student deeply tinged with the idealism of the renascent French Revolution. His life was the life of a recluse from affairs--an invalid's life; a large part of it was spent round and about the British Museum Reading-room, and his conceptions of Socialism and the social process have at once the spacious vistas given by the {{historical}} habit and the abstract quality <b>that</b> <b>comes</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> divorce from practical experience of human government. Only in England and in the eighties did the expanding propositions of Socialism come under the influence of men essentially administrative. As a consequence Marx, and still more the early Marxists, were and are negligent of the necessities of government and crude in their notions of class action. He saw the economic process with a perfect lucidity, practically he foretold the consolidation of the Trusts, and his statement of the necessary development of an entirely propertyless working-class with an intensifying class consciousness is a magnificent generalization. He saw clearly up to that opposition of the many and the few, and then his vision failed because his experience and interests failed. There was to be a class war, and numbers schooled to discipline by industrial organization were to win.|$|E

60|$|There is {{no natural}} life of man. He is, {{and always has}} been, a sheath of varied and even {{incompatible}} possibilities, a palimpsest of inherited dispositions. It was the habit of many writers {{in the early twentieth}} century to speak of competition and the narrow, private life of trade and saving and suspicious isolation as though such things were in some exceptional way proper to the human constitution, and as though openness of mind and a preference for achievement over possession were abnormal and rather unsubstantial qualities. How wrong that was the history of the decades immediately following the establishment of the world republic witnesses. Once the world was released from the hardening insecurities of a needless struggle for life that was collectively planless and individually absorbing, it became apparent that there was in the vast mass of people a long, smothered passion to make things. The world broke out into making, and at first mainly into aesthetic making. This phase of history, which has been not inaptly termed the 'Efflorescence,' is still, to a large extent, with us. The majority of our population consists of artists, and the bulk of activity in the world lies no longer with necessities but with their elaboration, decoration, and refinement. There has been an evident change in the quality of this making during recent years. It becomes more purposeful than it was, losing something of its first elegance and prettiness and gaining in intensity; but that is a change rather of hue than of nature. <b>That</b> <b>comes</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> deepening philosophy and a sounder education. For the first joyous exercises of fancy we perceive now the deliberation of a more constructive imagination. There is a natural order in these things, and art comes before science as the satisfaction of more elemental needs must come before art, and as play and pleasure come in a human life before the development of a settled purpose....|$|E
6000|$|These pieces fairly {{indicate}} {{the range of}} Leopardi, and I confess that they and the rest that I have read leave me somewhat puzzled {{in the presence of}} his reputation. This, to be sure, is largely based upon his prose writings--his dialogues, full of irony and sarcasm--and his unquestionable scholarship. But the poetry is the heart of his fame, and is it enough to justify it? I suppose that such poetry owes very much of its peculiar influence to that awful love we all have of hovering about the idea of death--of playing with the great catastrophe of our several tragedies and farces, and of marveling what it can be. There are moods which the languid despair of Leopardi's poetry can always evoke, and in which it seems that the most life can do is to leave us, and let us lie down and cease. But I fancy we all agree that these are not very wise or healthful moods, and that their indulgence does not fit us particularly well for the duties of life, though I never heard that they interfered with its pleasures; on the contrary, they add a sort of zest to enjoyment. Of course the whole transaction is illogical, but if a poet will end every pensive strain with an appeal or apostrophe to death--not the real death, <b>that</b> <b>comes</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> sharp, quick agony, or [...] "after long lying in bed", after many days or many years of squalid misery and slowly dying hopes and medicines that cease even to relieve at last; not this death, that comes in all the horror of undertaking, but a picturesque and impressive abstraction, whose business it is to relieve us in the most effective way of all our troubles, {{and at the same time}} to avenge us somehow upon the indefinitely ungrateful and unworthy world we abandon--if a poet will do this, we are very apt to like him. There is little doubt that Leopardi was sincere, and there is little reason why he should not have been so, for life could give him nothing but pain.|$|E
