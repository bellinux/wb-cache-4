40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} {{expression}} of transcription factors <b>Twist</b> <b>and</b> Snail in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia tissues and their relationship with epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cell proliferation. Methods: cervical intraepithelial neoplasia tissues (n= 67) and normal cervical tissues (n= 85) were collected, and the contents of <b>Twist</b> <b>and</b> Snail as well as epithelialmesenchymal transition-related molecules and proliferation-related molecules in the tissues were detected. Results: <b>Twist</b> <b>and</b> Snail contents in CIN cervical tissues were lower than those in normal cervical tissues; Twist, Snail, PI 3 K, Akt, STAT 3, Vimentin, N-cadherin, Prdx 4, EZH 2 and STOML- 2 contents in CIN cervical tissues were higher than those in normal cervical tissues, and E-cadherin content was significantly lower than that in normal cervical tissues; E-cadherin content in CIN tissues with high expression of <b>Twist</b> <b>and</b> Snail was significantly lower than that in CIN tissues with low expression of <b>Twist</b> <b>and</b> Snail, and Vimentin, N-cadherin, Prdx 4, EZH 2 and STOML- 2 contents were higher than those in CIN tissues with low expression of <b>Twist</b> <b>and</b> Snail. Conclusions: Transcription factors <b>Twist</b> <b>and</b> Snail expression increase and downstream signaling pathway function is enhanced in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia tissues; <b>Twist</b> <b>and</b> Snail can regulate epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cell proliferation...|$|R

The goals for each level are straightforward: they generally fall {{along the lines of}} eliminating the heroic force or destroying all other Dungeon Keepers. The first few levels are tutorials, teaching the player the basics. Special items are hidden throughout certain levels. Such items perform actions such as increasing the player's creatures' experience level, or revealing the map. They can reveal a hidden level, where the player must perform a specific task, and is rewarded upon completion.|$|E
5|$|Stephen Decatur assumed {{command of}} President in December 1814, {{planning}} a cruise to the West Indies to prey on British shipping. In mid-January 1815, a snowy gale with strong winds forced the British blockading squadron away from New York Harbor, giving Decatur {{the opportunity to}} put to sea. On the evening of 14January, President headed out of the harbor but ran aground, the result of harbor pilots incorrectly marking a safe passage. Stranded on the sand bar, President lifted and dropped with the incoming tide. Within two hours her hull had been damaged, her timbers <b>twisted,</b> <b>and</b> masts sprung. Damage to her keel caused the ship to hog and sag. Decatur {{was finally able to}} float President off the bar and, assessing the damage, he decided to return to New York for repairs; however, the wind direction was not favorable and President was forced to head out to sea.|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} examine HIF- 2 α, <b>TWIST,</b> <b>and</b> CXCR 4 {{expression}} in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and assesses {{the association of}} their expression with clinicopathological indicators. HIF- 2 α, <b>TWIST,</b> <b>and</b> CXCR 4 protein expression in 129 PTCs, 61 nodular hyperplasia, and 118 normal thyroid tissue specimens was analyzed using immunohistochemistry. The protein expression levels of these three molecules were upregulated in PTCs. High protein expression of HIF- 2 α, <b>TWIST,</b> <b>and</b> CXCR 4 was significantly correlated with lymph node metastasis (LNM) (P< 0. 001). Furthermore, HIF- 2 α, <b>TWIST,</b> <b>and</b> CXCR 4 protein expression was correlated with one another. Concomitant high expression of these molecules had stronger correlation with LNM than did each alone (P= 0. 032 for HIF- 2 α/TWIST, P< 0. 001 for HIF- 2 α/CXCR 4, P= 0. 018 for TWIST/CXCR 4, and P< 0. 001 for HIF- 2 α/TWIST/CXCR 4). Additionally, HIF- 2 α, <b>TWIST,</b> <b>and</b> CXCR 4 mRNA expression were assessed in 30 [*]PTCs, 10 nodular hyperplasia, and 10 normal thyroid tissue specimens using real-time RT-PCR. <b>TWIST</b> <b>and</b> CXCR 4 mRNA expression levels were up-regulated in PTCs, and high mRNA expression of <b>TWIST</b> <b>and</b> CXCR 4 was significantly correlated with LNM (P= 0. 005 and P= 0. 010, resp.). These results demonstrated that the evaluation of HIF- 2 α, <b>TWIST,</b> <b>and</b> CXCR 4 expression in PTC {{may be useful in}} predicting the risk of LNM...|$|R

5|$|By February 26 city {{officials}} had determined One Meridian Plaza {{was not in}} danger of collapse. There was structural damage to horizontal steel beams and floor sections {{on most of the}} fire damaged floors. Under extreme fire exposure the beams and girders sagged and <b>twisted</b> <b>and</b> cracks appeared in the concrete floors. However, the overall structure was stable and able to support the weight of the building. Thermal expansion of the steel frame caused some of the granite panels to be dislodged from the building's facade. The streets and buildings around One Meridian Plaza were closed and cordoned off. The 20-story Morris Building and several three-story shops behind One Meridian Plaza on Chestnut Street were damaged by falling debris and sat unused for years until they were demolished in 2000. The neighboring Girard Trust Building, then called Two Mellon Plaza, experienced extensive water damage forcing the closure of the building. A bank in the building reopened a month later {{but the rest of the}} tower remained vacant for years. The roads around the building were closed for months after the fire, including a portion of two of Philadelphia's major streets, Broad and Market.|$|E
5|$|The fruit bodies, or apothecia, of Banksiamyces {{species are}} {{cup-shaped}} receptacles borne on a stipe (stalk), colored dark brown to black {{with a dark}} grey center. When dry, the apothecia are covered with a whitish powder. The edges of the cup may be rolled inwards (especially when dry), or be <b>twisted</b> <b>and</b> somewhat flattened. Both the outermost tissue layer (the ectal excipulum) and the tissue of the stalk are made of fungal cells with brown pigments that can be variously thick- or thin-walled, covered with small particles (granules), and spherical to ellipsoid. The middle tissue layer (the medullary excipulum) of both the cup and the internal tissue layer (the medulla) of the stalk contain a layer of tissue made of hyphae similar to the ectal excipulum. A second layer of tissue is made of hyphae that are translucent and gelatinous; this layer may be present in either the medullary excipulum, the medulla, or both.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the immunoexpression of <b>TWIST</b> <b>and</b> p-Akt proteins in oral leukoplakia (OL) and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), correlating their expressions with the histological features of the lesions. Study design: Immunohistochemical studies were carried out on 10 normal oral epithelium, 30 OL and 20 OSCC formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples. Immunoperoxidase reactions for <b>TWIST</b> <b>and</b> p-Akt proteins were applied on the specimens and the positivity of the reactions was calculated for 1000 epithelial cells. Results: Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn's post tests revealed a significant difference in <b>TWIST</b> <b>and</b> p-Akt immunoexpression among normal oral mucosa, OL and OSCC. In addition, a significant positive correlation was found between <b>TWIST</b> <b>and</b> p-Akt expressions according to the Pearson's correlation test. Conclusions: The results obtained in the current study suggest that <b>TWIST</b> <b>and</b> p-Akt may participate of the multi-step process of oral carcinogenesis since its early stages. © Medicina Oral S.

5|$|The scapula (shoulder blade) {{was longer}} than the humerus (upper arm bone); its blade was slender and narrow, and {{slightly}} twisted, following the contour of the ribs. The scapula did not expand at the upper end but was very expanded at the base. The coracoid was mainly thin and plate-like. The humerus had a slender shaft, was slightly twisted along its length, and was slightly bowed. The deltopectoral crest (where the deltoid and pectoral muscles attach) was weakly developed. The ends of the ulna were expanded, and ridges extended along the shaft. The radius was more robust than the ulna, which is unusual. When seen from above, the pelvic girdle was very broad for a bipedal archosaur, and became wider towards the hind part. The broadness of the pelvic region may have accommodated a rear extension of the gut. The ilium was elongated and the ischium was long and slender. Though the pubis is not known, it was probably reduced in size like that of Homalocephale. The femur (thigh bone) was slender and inwards curved, the tibia was slender and <b>twisted,</b> <b>and</b> the fibula was slender and wide at the upper end. The metatarsus of the foot {{appears to have been}} narrow, and the single known ungual (claw bone) of a toe was slender and slightly curved. Though the limbs of Stegoceras are not completely known, other pachycephalosaurs show that they had five-fingered hands and four toes.|$|E

40|$|We have {{synthesized}} DNA segments {{with different}} handedness, <b>twisting</b> <b>and</b> radii of curvature, and have analyzed {{the effect of}} untwisting on them. The {{results indicate that the}} dynamic behavior of curved DNA upon untwisting is strongly determined by the initial sequence-dependent DNA trajectory. In particular, DNA with the same radii but with opposite handedness of superhelix twisting can show very different conformational responses to ethidium bromide untwisting. Upon treatment with ethidium bromide, right-handed superhelixes decrease their <b>twist</b> <b>and</b> increase the planarity of the superhelix, while left-handed superhelixes increase <b>twisting</b> <b>and</b> decrease their degree of planarity...|$|R
40|$|The {{specific}} aim of {{this study}} was to evaluate the feasibility, reproducibility and maturational changes of LV rotation, <b>twist</b> <b>and</b> torsion variables by real-time 3 D speckle-tracking echocardiography (RT 3 DSTE) in children. A prospective study was conducted in 347 consecutive healthy subjects (181 males/ 156 females, mean age 7. 12 ± 5. 3 years, and range from birth to 18 -years) using RT 3 D echocardiography (3 DE). The LV rotation, <b>twist</b> <b>and</b> torsion measurements were made off-line using TomTec software. Manual landmark selection and endocardial border editing were performed in 3 planes (apical " 2 "-, " 4 "-, and " 3 "- chamber views) and semi-automated tracking yielded LV rotation, <b>twist</b> <b>and</b> torsion measurements. LV rotation, <b>twist</b> <b>and</b> torsion analysis by RT 3 DSTE were feasible in 307 out of 347 subjects (88. 5 %). There was no correlation between rotation or <b>twist</b> <b>and</b> age, height, weight, BSA or heart rate, respectively. However, there was statistically significant, but very modest correlation between LV torsion and age (R 2 = 0. 036, P< 0. 001). The normal ranges were defined for rotation <b>and</b> <b>twist</b> in this cohort, and for torsion for each age group. The intra-observer and inter-observer variabilities for apical <b>and</b> basal rotation, <b>twist</b> <b>and</b> torsion ranged from 7. 3 % ± 3. 8 % to 12. 3 % ± 8. 8 % and from 8. 8 % ± 4. 6 % to 15. 7 % ± 10. 1 %, respectively. We conclude that analysis of LV rotation, <b>twist</b> <b>and</b> torsion by this new RT 3 D STE is feasible and reproducible in pediatric population. There is no maturational change in rotation <b>and</b> <b>twist,</b> but torsion decreases with age in this cohort. Further refinement is warranted to validate the utility of this new methodology in more sensitive and quantitative evaluation of congenital and acquired heart diseases in children...|$|R
