40|$|International audienceThe coastal {{ocean is}} a crucial link between land, the open ocean and the atmosphere. The shallowness of the water column permits close {{interactions}} between the sedimentary, aquatic and atmospheric compartments, which otherwise are decoupled at long time scales (congruent to 1000 yr) in the open oceans. Despite the prominent role of the coastal oceans in absorbing atmospheric CO(2) and transferring it into the deep oceans via the continental shelf pump, the underlying mechanisms remain only partly understood. Evaluating observations from the North Sea, a NW European shelf sea, we provide evidence that anaerobic degradation of organic matter, fuelled from land and ocean, generates total alkalinity (AT) and increases the CO(2) buffer capacity of seawater. At both the basin wide and annual scales anaerobic AT generation in the North Sea's <b>tidal</b> <b>mud</b> <b>flat</b> area irreversibly facilitates 7 - 10 %, or taking into consideration benthic denitrification in the North Sea, 20 - 25 % of the North Sea's overall CO(2) uptake. At the global scale, anaerobic AT generation could be accountable {{for as much as}} 60 % of the uptake of CO(2) in shelf and marginal seas, making this process, the anaerobic pump, a key player in the biological carbon pump. Under future high CO(2) conditions oceanic CO(2) storage via the anaerobic pump may even gain further relevance because of stimulated ocean productivity...|$|E

40|$|Puleo, Jack A. McKenna, Thomas E. Near-bed hydrodynamics, {{sediment}} suspension, erosion, and deposition {{were investigated}} in tidal channels, on a tidal flat, and in man-made ditches within tidal marshes. Highly-resolved velocity profiles were {{measured in the}} lower 0. 03 m of the water column in small tidal channels using acoustic Doppler profiling velocimeters. Shear stresses and turbulent kinetic energy followed a similar trend with the largest peaks during ebb tide. The shear stress during flood tide was on average approximately 30 % of the shear stress during ebb tide. Turbulence production exceeded turbulence dissipation at every phase of the tide, suggesting that advection and vertical diffusion are not negligible. Data collected in small tidal channels intersecting a tidal flat indicated that the channel velocity peaked when the water level was near the tidal flat level. In the channel intersecting the tidal flat, the shear stress, turbulence, and along-channel velocity were ebb dominant. Distinct pulses in velocity occurred when the water level was near the tidal flat level. Water levels were elevated during a storm event, during which velocities, turbulent kinetic energy and shear stress were smaller than during normal conditions. Long-wave infrared imagery of the <b>tidal</b> <b>mud</b> <b>flat</b> was used to estimate flat elevations. Traditional surveying methods are difficult to use on soft mud flats. The approach utilizes identification of the intersection of water with {{the surface of the}} mud flat through a rising tide. Elevation estimates showed excellent agreement (absolute error generally less than 0. 02 m) with ground truth elevations. Near-bed velocity, sediment concentration, and bed level change were measured over a 3 -week period in man-made ditches that are prevalent throughout tidal marshes along the Atlantic US coast. Velocities in the main channel were ebb dominant and peaked at a lower water depth during ebb tide than during flood tide. Velocity and shear stress were maximum during a storm event. The bed accreted at the most landward sites, while it eroded closer to the canal during the experiment. At all sites, erosion occurred during the accelerating phase of the flood tide, and accretion of a similar magnitude occurred during the decelerating phase of the ebb tide.

40|$|Li, B, Mg, Al, Mn, Cu, Zn, As, Sr, Ba and U/Ca ratios were {{measured}} by laser ablation {{inductively coupled plasma}} mass spectrometry for 11 modern Austrovenus stutchburyi clams to assess the potential of this molluscan species {{as a proxy for}} paleo-ocean temperature and environmental change. A. stutchburyi is an intertidal, infaunal, bivalve, widespread in New Zealand coastal regions and throughout the Quaternary-Pliocene sedimentary rock record. Five individuals from Ligar Bay and Estuary (South Island, New Zealand) were analysed to evaluate the variability between individuals calcifying in similar environmental conditions. A further six individuals were sampled from a range of latitudes (38 ˚ to 40 ˚) in the North Island, New Zealand to evaluate variability between individuals from different environments. A strong positive correlation between growth rate and Mg, Al, Mn, Sr, Ba and U/Ca ratios was observed, and a marked negative correlation was found between the same trace element/Ca ratios and ontogenetic age as growth rates slow during the molluscs' life. Thus, biological effects are the primary influence on trace element incorporation in A. stutchburyi. No clear seasonal variations were observed in the Mg and Sr/Ca ratio profiles through A. stutchburyi shells representing time periods of several years. Furthermore, for two shells for which chronologies could be reliably constructed, there were no significant correlations between Mg and Sr/Ca ratios and sea surface temperature. When Mg/Ca ratios were normalised to Sr/Ca ratios in order to eliminate the growth rate effect on trace element incorporation into the mollusc shells, some of the remaining variations appeared to visually correlate positively with sea surface temperature in several sections of a shell. However, a quantitative correlation did not confirm this (r² = 0. 012). It is likely that neither Mg nor Sr incorporation into A. stutchburyi shell are primarily thermodynamically controlled. Several coincident Ba/Ca peaks in two of the Ligar Bay shells are most likely caused by environmental processes such as short periods of phytoplankton blooms or elevated seawater Ba/Ca from river flooding. Mn/Ca and U/Ca variations in A. stutchburyi from different coastal sites with different sediment characteristics appeared to be linked to the redox conditions prevailing at an open ocean sand-dominated environment (Ligar Bay) versus <b>tidal</b> <b>mud</b> <b>flat</b> environments (e. g. Miranda). Thus, while A. stutchburyi is unlikely to be a useful archive for past coastal ocean temperatures, it holds considerable promise for tracking past changes in coastal ocean productivity and river run-off, as well as sediment redox conditions...|$|E
40|$|The dynamics, {{over the}} last 7500 years, of a {{mangrove}} at Marajo Island in northern Brazil were studied by pollen and sedimentary facies analyses using sediment cores. This island, located {{at the mouth of}} the Amazon River. is influenced by riverine inflow combined with tidal fluctuations of the equatorial Atlantic Ocean. Herbaceous vegetation intermingled with rainforest dominates the central area of the island, while varzea is the main vegetation type along the littoral. In particular, the modem northeastern coastal zone is covered by a mosaic of dense rainforest, herbaceous vegetation, mangroves, varzea, and restinga. The integration of pollen data and fades descriptions indicates a <b>tidal</b> <b>mud</b> <b>flat</b> colonized by mangroves in the interior of Marajo Island between similar to 7500 cal yr BP and similar to 3200 cal yr BP. During the late Holocene, mangroves retracted to a small area (100 - 700 m in width) along the northeastern coastal plain. Mangrove expansion during the early and mid Holocene was likely caused by the post-glacial sea-level rise which, combined with tectonic subsidence, led to a rise in tidal water salinity. Salinity must have further increased due to low river discharge resulting from increased aridity during the early and mid Holocene. The shrinking of the area covered by mangrove vegetation during the late Holocene was likely caused by the increase in river discharge during the late Holocene, which has maintained relatively low tidal water salinity in Marajo Island. Tidal water salinity is relatively higher in the northeastern part of the island than in others, due to the southeast-northwest trending current along the littoral. The mixing of marine and riverine freshwater inflows has provided a refuge for mangroves in this area. The increase in flow energy during the last century is related to landward sand migration, which explains the current retraction of mangroves. These changes may indicate an increased exposure to tidal influence driven by the relative sea-level rise, either associated with global fluctuations or tectonic subsidence, and/or by an increase in river water discharge.

40|$|Iron, a {{technological}} material of prime importance, deteriorates by interaction with its abiotic and biotic environment. While the corrosion of iron in oxic environments is, to our present knowledge, a largely chemical (abiotic) process, corrosion in anoxic environments is heavily affected by microbial activity. In technology, this {{is referred to}} as microbially influenced corrosion (MIC). Contrary to the more prominent rusting of iron with oxygen, MIC usually is a hidden process occurring in places such as closed cooling water systems or buried pipelines. The inferred economic costs are tremendous. Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) are the suspected main culprits; MIC usually is most severe in sulfate-containing environments, and iron sulfides (FeS), the characteristic product of SRB-induced corrosion, are ubiquitously found at the affected sites. Metal destruction by SRB is conventionally attributed to three effects, (i) the chemical aggressiveness of their metabolic product sulfide, (ii) a facilitated cathodic reduction of protons to molecular hydrogen at deposited iron sulfides and (iii) the microbial consumption of cathodic hydrogen from the iron or iron sulfides. Recently, another mechanism, i. e. direct electron uptake from metallic iron, has been discovered in specialized lithotrophic SRB that were isolated from enrichment cultures with iron as the only source of electrons (Dinh et al., 2004). In the present study we investigated the suggested mechanisms of SRB-induced corrosion with particular emphasis on the latter, bioelectrical process. This was achieved by a combination of kinetic and electrochemical studies in axenic SRB microcosms, and the physicochemical analysis of the formed corrosion products. Little or no corrosion resulted from galvanically coupled iron sulfides and microbial consumption of hydrogen, respectively. However, the specialized lithotrophic SRB corroded metallic iron severely and formed large amounts of an electroconductive mineral crust. Their corrosiveness results from the formation of a galvanic element between the iron anode and the bacterial cathode. Electrons flow from the iron through the sulfidic crust to the crust-attached bacteria reducing sulfate. The biological cathodic reaction controls the rate and, with appropriately adjusted cultivation conditions, such bioelectrical corrosion progressed at technologically highly relevant rates in long-term incubations. The direct corrosion of iron through electron uptake is here referred to as electrical microbially influenced corrosion (EMIC). This mechanism is fundamentally different from the indirect corrosive effect of SRB owing to the excretion of the chemical hydrogen sulfide (chemical microbially influenced corrosion, CMIC). CMIC is also known to progress at high rates in laboratory cultures. Hence, we intended to unravel the relative contribution of EMIC and CMIC to total microbial corrosion in natural sulfate-rich environments. Careful chemical analysis of corrosion products combined with knowledge of the fundamental differences of the two corrosion mechanisms allowed such quantitative assessment. In a marine <b>tidal</b> <b>mud</b> <b>flat,</b> studied {{as an example of a}} sulfate-rich environment possibly favoring MIC, severe metal corrosion could indeed be observed and exclusively attributed to EMIC, i. e. bioelectrical corrosion by lithotrophic SRB. A better understanding of microbial corrosion mechanisms as well as their quantitative contribution to corrosion damage is expected to aid in the development of more effective MIC prevention and mitigation strategies. The striking physiological ability of the organisms to corrode iron by direct electron uptake apparently has polyphyletic origin; it was found in several phylogenetically unrelated bacterial isolates. However, the ecological role of such microorganisms in their natural (metal-free) habitat is currently unknown. Interestingly, we detected high numbers of directly corrosive SRB in marine anoxic sediment, despite obvious absence of man-made iron constructions. It is hypothesized that anaerobic biocorrosion is due to the promiscuous use of an ecophysiologically relevant catabolic trait for uptake of external electrons from natural abiotic and biotic sources...|$|E
