The expression of CD 45 RA (naive) and CD 45 RO (memory) antigens on CD 4 + lymphocytes was analysed by flow cytometry in a prospectively followed cohort of 15 malnourished infected, 12 well-nourished infected and 10 well-nourished uninfected children. Malnourished infected children showed higher fractions of Ddull cells (11 · 4 ± 0 · 7 %) and lower fractions of memory cells (20 · 3 ± 1 · 7 %) than the well-nourished infected group (8 · 8 ± 0 · 8 and 28 · 1 ± 1 · 8 %, respectively).

40|$|A {{regulatory}} protein from grass pea (Lathyrus sativus), LS- 24, a close homolog of albumin 2 from garden pea (Pisum sativum) that {{is associated with}} polyamine biosynthesis, was characterized and the structure of a hemopexin-type fold among plant proteins illustrated. Crystal structure of LS- 24 determined at 2. 2 Å resolution by multiple isomorphous replacement phasing showed four-bladed β-propeller structure having a pseudo 4 -fold molecular symmetry along a metal ion-binding central channel. The structure represents typical mammalian hemopexin fold with discernible features correlated with the possible functional variations. The protein was found to exist in the dimeric state. While LS- 24 dimer binds to spermine in the crystal structure as well as in solution, binding of heme in solution resulted in the dissociation of the dimer into monomers with concomitant release of bound spermine. Interactions of heme and spermine with LS- 24 bear physiological implications. While binding of spermine to LS- 24 can be linked with polyamine biosynthesis that of heme correlates with oxidative stress. Mutually exclusive binding of heme and spermine in different oligomeric states suggest a role for LS- 24 in sensing oxidative stress through a ligand-regulated monomer-dimer <b>transition</b> <b>switch...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract:Trial {{and error}} {{approach}} which involves service interruption is usually {{carried out to}} resolve unbalance on phases in power distribution system. This approach might improve the phase voltage and current but the resultant effect (change) does not last for too long; thereby reduces the market value in terms of quality and reliability of supply. To enhance {{the performance of the}} secondary distribution system {{there is a need for}} an automating technology. The aim of this paper is to introduce a method and technology developed for resolving imbalances in a secondary distribution system as a result of the uneven distribution of single phase load across a three phase power system. The technology developed is able to monitor, acquire/display collected data and perform self changing switching actions electronically. This action is in form of rearrangement or transfer of consumer loads for optimal performance of the distribution feeder. The proposed switching technology is based on open- <b>transition</b> <b>switch</b> that enables transfer or rearrangement of consumer loads in a three-phase system within milliseconds with supervisory control system.

Mainly, it {{is focused on the}} review of the principles and previous investigations on the thermal integrated switches based on the novel vanadium dioxide material, that presents a semiconductor to metal state phase transition around 68 ºC. In order to prove the viability of the thermal integrated logic circuits, basically consisting on thermal logic gates made of phonsistors, it has been experimentally tested, using a heating plate and a source meter, a single SMT (Semiconductor to Metal <b>Transition)</b> <b>switch</b> and a thermal logic gate structure, based on a platinum contacts geometry deposited on a VO 2 thin film over a silicon substrate. The experiments revealed the correct operation of the VO 2 switch, proving the previous studied theories, as the resistance change and the reason that produce the transition activation. Also, the NOR logic function was proved on the thermal logic structure, using current driven inputs and a pull-up resistor in the output. The results acquired present the possibility of creating thermal logic gates and electronic circuits based on the phonsistor scheme. Further investigations building nanoscale structures, which would improve the performance, could be done to test the minimum switching times and the power consumption that would have the thermal logic technology.
