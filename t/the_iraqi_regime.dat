During a certain period they said we were spies for <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>regime.</b> Now they say that we are Syrian agents.... Many psychologists and sociologists in the Soviet bloc tried to investigate this man Abu Nidal. They wanted to find a weak point in his character. The result was zero.|$|E

The western Hammar Marshes and the Qurnah or Central Marshes became completely desiccated, while the eastern Hawizeh Marshes dramatically shrank. Furthermore, villages in the marshes were attacked and burnt down and there were reports of the water being deliberately poisoned.|$|E

25|$|As an {{international}} coalition under United States command assembled {{in anticipation of}} an invasion of Iraqi-occupied Kuwait, <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>regime</b> decided to destroy as much of Kuwait's oil reserves and infrastructure as possible before withdrawing from that country. As early as December 1990, Iraqi forces placed explosive charges on Kuwaiti oil wells. The wells were systematically sabotaged beginning on January 16, 1991, when the allies commenced air strikes against Iraqi targets. On February 8, satellite images detected the first smoke from burning oil wells. The number of oil fires peaked between February 22 and 24, when the allied ground offensive began.|$|E
25|$|Under Ould Taya, {{discrimination}} against the Afro-Mauritanian population became more pronounced. Thousands {{were forced to}} flee to Senegal and Mali. In {{the armed forces and}} the civil service, human rights abuses were common and many were killed. The last years of Ould Taya's rule were marred by unrest within the military and hostility between the regime and the country's Islamists. Ould Taya's harsh response to the religious opposition triggered criticisms from abroad. Ould Taya also moved away from his support of <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>regime</b> of Saddam Hussein {{at the time of the}} 1991 Gulf War, and moved towards the West. In late 1999, Mauritania established full diplomatic relations with Israel, becoming only the third Arab country to do so. In doing so, he had at some point formally ended a declared war on Israel that dated from the 1967 Six-Day War. Ould Taya's close ties with Israel and the United States served to deepen the opposition to his rule.|$|E
25|$|Kurds make {{up around}} 17% of Iraq's population. They are the {{majority}} {{in at least three}} provinces in Northern Iraq which are known as Iraqi Kurdistan.

There are around 300,000 Kurds living in the Iraqi capital Baghdad, 50,000 in the city of Mosul and around 100,000 Kurds living elsewhere in Southern Iraq. Kurds led by Mustafa Barzani were engaged in heavy fighting against successive Iraqi regimes from 1960 to 1975. In March 1970, Iraq announced a peace plan providing for Kurdish autonomy. The plan was to be implemented in four years. However, at the same time, <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>regime</b> started an Arabization program in the oil rich regions of Kirkuk and Khanaqin. The peace agreement did not last long, and in 1974, the Iraqi government began a new offensive against the Kurds. Moreover, in March 1975, Iraq and Iran signed the Algiers Accord, according to which Iran cut supplies to Iraqi Kurds. Iraq started another wave of Arabization by moving Arabs to the oil fields in Kurdistan, particularly those around Kirkuk. Between 1975 and 1978, two-hundred thousand Kurds were deported to other parts of Iraq.|$|E

2500|$|Baghdad {{interpreted}} this as {{a virtual}} declaration of war, and, in March 1974, unilaterally decreed an autonomy statute.

In tandem with the 1970–1974 autonomy process, <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>regime</b> carried out a comprehensive administrative reform, in which the country's sixteen provinces, or governorates, were renamed and in some cases had their boundaries altered. The old province of Kirkuk was split in half. The area around the city itself was named At-Ta'mim (...) ("nationalization"), and its boundaries were redrawn so as to give an Arab majority.|$|E

2500|$|Since the invasion, the U.S. {{government}} statements concerning Iraqi {{weapons programs}} {{and links to}} al-Qaeda have been discredited.

In Cairo, on 24 February 2001, Colin Powell had predicted as much, saying, [...] " [...] has not developed any significant capability with respect to weapons of mass destruction.

[...] Similarly, assertions of operational links between <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>regime</b> and al-Qaeda have largely been discredited by the intelligence community, and Secretary Powell himself later admitted he had no proof.|$|E
2500|$|Among {{the criticisms}} of the first Conference {{was that it was}} {{building}} solidarity not with ordinary Iraqis, but rather with the Iraqi government of Saddam Hussein. This perception was fuelled by the reported presence of a number of Iraqi officials at the conference. According to Al-Ahram Weekly , German journalist and author Harald Schuman attracted the ire of Nabil Negm, the chief political adviser to the Iraqi president, after comments he made insisting that claims that all the problems of the Arab world could be laid {{at the door of the}} US were only half-true and that the conference was not meant to [...] "defend <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>regime</b> and Saddam Hussein in any shape or form".
