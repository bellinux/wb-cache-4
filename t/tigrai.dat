Stone scrapers are traditionally associated with hideworking activities and are still used by many modern hideworker artisans living in southern Ethiopia. Drawing upon ethnoarchaeological and archaeological studies, this dissertation explores the use of stone scrapers as hideworking tools in order to identify and track the formation of craft specialists at the Pre-Aksumite site of Mezber (> 800 BCE-CE 100) and the Pre-Aksumite/Aksumite site of Ona Adi (ca. 50 BCE-CE 700).

40|$|Three grazing regimes [Cut-and-carry (CC), {{seasonal}} grazing (SG) and continuous grazing (CG) ] currently applied in <b>Tigrai</b> region of northern Ethiopia {{were compared to}} identify the best grazing management in key native vegetation and soil attributes. More than 50 % of the desirable species such as Andropogon, Cynodon and Phalaris spp were located in the CC and SG regimes. During the rainy season, the CC regime produced 1. 7 and 2. 7 more biomass than the SG and CG regimes, respectively. Herbaceous basal cover was 6. 8 times more in the CC than in the CG regime. During the rainy season, herbaceous species diversity and richness were the least in the CG regime but similar in the CC and SG regimes. This similarity, however, changed {{during the dry season}} when the SG regime is grazed by livestock that led to a reduction in diversity. These results suggest that CC is superior to the traditional CG, but not always necessarily superior to the SG.

40|$|This study {{examines}} broadly the Federal land policy framework {{as well as}} legislation pertaining to land issued recently by the four main Killils, namely, <b>Tigrai,</b> Amhara, Oromia and Southern Killil. It also looks into the new initiatives undertaken {{by the government to}} address the problems of tenure insecurity, namely user right documentation, underway in Amhara and <b>Tigrai,</b> and resettlement. Critics of the land system have argued that the policy promotes insecurity of tenure because it allows, among other things, periodic redistribution, is inefficient because it constrains land transactions and has inhibited the emergence of a dynamic land market, promotes fragmentation of land and growing pressure on land resources because it discourages rural people from leaving their farms for other employment opportunities; it also gives the state immense power over the farming population because land is state property. The legislations issued by the different Killils are not in harmony with each other or with Federal legislation, and, all except that issued by Oromia, have not sufficiently addressed the main causes of tenure insecurity. One of the new initiatives being tried out in <b>Tigrai</b> and Amhara is user right documentation. Documentation is being undertaken within existing legal and policy frameworks. While it may be too early to judge, it does appear that documentation has promoted a sense of security among peasants who have received the documents. This is to be welcomed. However, the documents do not entitle holders any more benefits than those contained in existing legislations. Holders cannot use the document as collateral to borrow from financial institutions. Documentation has been undertaken for the most part without the use of modern surveying and mapping techniques. Documentation by itself, however well it is undertaken, will not be sufficient to ensure full tenure security. The resettlement program now under way is a cause for great concern. The program is already facing many difficulties because it was carried out without adequate preparation, and under the erroneous assumption that there is plenty of unused arable land in each Killil to accommodate a large settler population. The study concludes by stressing the need for a fresh public debate on the land question, focusing on tenure security (instead of tenure regimes as has been the case in the past) because, despit...|$|E

The Senafe ignimbrite is composed prevalently of trachyte with differing degrees of alkalinity: trachy-dacite of transitional series, and trachyte s. s. of mildly alkaline series. K/Ar radiometric measurements carried out on three samples give ages ranging between 21 and 23 Ma (Lower Miocene) and show that the Senafe ignimbrite with transitional character is an extension of the Serae rhyolite of the Central Eritrean Plateau, and may also be correlated with the Miocene Alaji rhyolite of the Central Ethiopian Plateau. In contrast, the more alkaline ignimbrite shows good correlations with the trachyte emitted by the Miocene Termaber alkaline central volcanoes of Ethiopia. It is noted that, {{in the course of the}} Miocene volcanism in Eritrea, the volumetric ratio between associated basalt and ignimbrite diminishes from west to east, i. e., approaching the Afar escarpment.

However, there are no adequate studies in <b>Tigrai</b> focusing on the level of market integration of the smallholder farmers and whether the market participants are better-off in welfare outcomes. This study, thus, focused on identifying the micro-level factors determining market participation, the level of commercialization as well as evaluating the welfare outcomes of participant smallholders in Enderta District of <b>Tigrai.</b> Descriptive, statistical and econometric methods were employed to analyze the data collected from a sample of 125 households using structured household questionnaires. The findings from the statistical analysis showed that landholding size and land slope, irrigation use, number of oxen owned, and membership in extension package program have positive and significant association with commercialization while participation in non-farm activities has significant but negative association with commercialization. Nonetheless, descriptive findings showed that the degree of commercialization in the study area is very low (23 %) even in comparison to the national average (33 - 36 %), which is in itself considered to be low. The findings from the probit regression analysis revealed that production level (in value terms), use of improved seeds, use of irrigation and total landholding size are the most important factors affecting the ability of a smallholder to participate in output markets. Moreover, the findings from OLS estimation showed that the level of food and cash crop production (in value terms), gender, technology use (irrigation, improved seeds), use of fertilizer and the number of oxen owned per household are important factors determining the level of commercialization of smallholder farms. Finally, findings from one-way ANOVA analysis indicated that farm households with high degree of commercialization enjoyed better welfare outcomes (represented by consumption of basic non-grain consumables and expenditure on education, shoes and clothes, durables and housing).

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to evaluate the environmental and socio-economic impacts of small-scale water harvesting projects in the highland agro-ecozone of <b>Tigrai,</b> Northern Ethiopia, specifically the CIDA-funded Water Harvesting Institutional Strengthening <b>Tigrai</b> (WHIST) project of the Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Administration's (PFRA). A second objective was to evaluate the farmers' indigenous knowledge (IK) in relation to land management and project development. Farmers' IK of their land includes local descriptive terms for soil, based on colour, topographic occurrence, fertility, tilth and crop suitability. Farmers rely on their IK to make decisions about land use and cropping. Farmers consider that soil quality declines with increasing cultivation and is mainly a consequence of the removal of nearly all crop residues. Government policies related to land ownership are important factors influencing conservation and sustainability, and policies that establish long-term rights to land by farmers are needed. The IK of soil quality and land relates well to scientific knowledge and provides an opportunity for researchers, extension workers and project developers to establish effective communication with farmers, and can supplement the scarce scientific data. Combining the IK and scientific knowledge (SK) may improve the success and productivity water harvesting and other development projects in the region. Qualitative information from household surveys supplements the quantitative information obtained through scientific studies and they should be incorporated in future studies. Smallholder farmers and their households have benefited from the WHIST projects (micro-dams and river diversion systems, on-farm reservoirs and shallow wells) in terms of reducing farming risks, improving yields of marketable crops, and developing improved markets. Successful irrigators became more food-secure and their income increased compared to non- irrigators. Despite their positive contribution, many water projects failed to achieve their objectives because of water loss through seepage and evaporation, inappropriate water application strategies, and lack of knowledge of soils and topography in the catchment areas. Poorly placed on farm reservoirs (OFRs) often occupy the most productive farmlands. Inadequate preliminary studies by project developers and the exclusion of fanners and their IK from decision making during construction and management resulted in the poor designs of many projects. It is critical that farmers be included at all stages of project development in order to improve environmental sustainability, achieve economic growth, and to enhance contributions to food security...|$|E

Finding suggest that changing the current institutional setting could indeed be welfare reducing. Given the finding, it is little wonder the government is reluctant to impose a private property institution on Ethiopia, despite continued land degradation. Key words: institutions; sustainable land use; economic welfare...|$|E
40|$|The 1972 - 1973 rains in {{northern}} Ethiopia were well below average and an ensuing drought caused crop failure and livelihood loss amongst the farming and nomadic populations. Experienced conservationists had already warned, {{even before this}} drought, that lack of a national landuse plan and of indigenous traditions or programmes of {{soil and water conservation}} (SWC), together with uncontrolled and unregulated cultivation on any slope where there was soil, were resulting in unsustainably high soil erosion, and excessive degradation of the land cover. This was thought to be spiralling downwards to a catastrophe, which would have an adverse impact on the rural economies that provided much of the food for the country. The effect of that drought exacerbated a desperate situation. The upland plateau region of Tigray (or Tigre, <b>Tigrai)</b> from 2000 to 4000 m a. s. l. was particularly badly hit as rainfed farming communities had no stored reserves. The UK response to this disaster in 1974 was a long-term technical assistance (TA) package - the <b>Tigrai</b> Rural Development Study (TRDS) that made in-depth baseline studies on soil conditions, geomorphology, landuse planning, livestock, vegetation and range ecology, surface and groundwater resources, demography, the rural economy, and institutions. Demonstrations in SWC and exclosing land were key interventions. Civil war forced cessation of the TA work in 1976 but the Tigray people began to initiate change and since then have made remarkable institutional reforms, applied SWC measures over large parts of upland Tigray and transformed a degraded landscape into a productive one where scars of the past are being healed. The TRDS team had taken many landscape photographs for monitoring purposes in this scenically stunning area. Repeat photography analysis at these sites in connection with advanced geomorphological research all over Tigray was able to provide a semi-quantitative assessment of change in the region. The Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) and particularly changes in C (cover) and P (management) factors was applied to assess change. The study indicates {{that there has been a}} positive change to the landscape due to improved vegetation cover and introduction of physical SWC structures. The USLE application indicates that over a large area the current average soil loss would be around 68 % of its 1975 rate. Whilst central gullying had increased dramatically in several areas, and some remnant forests were being degraded illegally, the repeat photography exercise demonstrated that there is a strong natural resilience in soils and vegetation allowing recovery from what appeared to be a quite hopeless and terminal situation and that SWC interventions are, as long claimed, highly appropriate...|$|E
30|$|The {{case study}} by Belay et al. (2013) {{indicated}} {{that the most important}} problems of livestock production perceived were feed shortage (100 %) and water shortage (27 %) during the dry season in Ethiopia. Feed and water deficits start in December, when the natural pastures are at their lowest quantity and the supply of stored crop residues is starting to diminish (Sileshi et al. 2003). In the study region, Gebremedhin (2009) and Yimer (2005) also revealed that natural grazing is diminishing over time due to the high degree of degradation, resulting in high TLU per km 2 of grazing land. The estimated crop residues are found to be about 1, 229, 651 tons dry matter/year while the region has an estimated 878, 322  ha of arable land available for crop production, contributing about 45 % of the animal feed demand. Felleke and Geda (2001) stated that 73 % of the feed is provided from natural grazing, 14 % from crop residues, and the remaining 13 % from other feed sources. A recent study of Bishu (2014) in <b>Tigrai</b> {{indicated that the}}re is water shortage for livestock drinking (34 %) and feed shortages (7 %). There is also a shortage of labor for livestock management (Tegegne 2012).|$|E
40|$|In Ethiopia {{deforestation}} is a {{major problem}} and many peasants have switched from fuelwood to dung for cooking and heating purposes, thereby damaging the agricultural productivity of cropland. The Ethiopian government has embarked on a two-pronged policy in an effort to stem deforestation and the degradation of agricultural lands: (i) tree planting or afforestation; (ii) dissemination of more efficient stove technologies. The motivation in here is, therefore, to examine the potential of the strategy of disseminating improved stoves in the rehabilitation of agricultural and forests lands. For empirical analysis we used a dataset on cross-section of 200 farm households from the highlands of <b>Tigrai,</b> northern Ethiopia. We used a two-step procedure reminiscent of hedonic pricing. Results in this paper indicate that farm households in Tigrai/ Ethiopia are willing to adopt new/improved stove innovations if these result in economic savings. Moreover, results suggest a significant positive impact in slowing the degradation of agricultural and forested lands. On a per household basis, we found that adopters will collect 68. 3 kg less wood each month, while more dung in the form of manure becomes available as 19. 899 kg less dung is collected each month. In terms of wood alone, assuming an average of 79 t of biomass per ha, we found the potential reduction in deforestation amounts to some 1, 794 ha per year, not an inconsequential savings. land degradation, technology adoption, fuel-savings efficiency, stoves, Ethiopia, Land Economics/Use, Q 12, Q 16, Q 24,...|$|E
