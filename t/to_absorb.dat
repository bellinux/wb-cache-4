5|$|NuScale's design {{does not}} rely on powered water pumps or circulatory equipment. The company claims it can shut down and {{continue}} cooling itself indefinitely {{in the event of}} a catastrophe. The devices are intended to be kept in a below-ground pool, <b>to</b> <b>absorb</b> the shock of earthquakes, with a concrete lid over the pool. In the event that AC power is lost for normal cooling systems, the pool water begins <b>to</b> <b>absorb</b> heat and boil.|$|E

5|$|Boron carbide's ability <b>to</b> <b>absorb</b> {{neutrons}} without forming long-lived radionuclides (especially when doped {{with extra}} boron-10) makes the material attractive as an absorbent for neutron radiation arising in nuclear power plants. Nuclear applications of boron carbide include shielding, control rods and shut-down pellets. Within control rods, boron carbide is often powdered, {{to increase its}} surface area.|$|E
5|$|During the {{following}} two billion years, the accumulated matter settles into a galactic disc. A galaxy will continue <b>to</b> <b>absorb</b> infalling material from high-velocity clouds and dwarf galaxies throughout its life. This matter is mostly hydrogen and helium. The cycle of stellar birth and death slowly increases the abundance of heavy elements, eventually allowing the formation of planets.|$|E

5|$|Generally sharks {{have only}} one layer of tesserae, but the jaws of large specimens, such as the bull shark, tiger shark, and the great white shark, have two to three layers or more, {{depending}} on body size. The jaws of a large great white shark may have up to five layers. In the rostrum (snout), the cartilage can be spongy and flexible <b>to</b> <b>absorb</b> the power of impacts.|$|E

Though he performs the act and they fight, Lightning manages to renew his hope of seeing Serah again, reverse his transformation and lift his burden.|$|E
5|$|Lanthanum has {{no known}} {{biological}} role in humans. The element is very poorly absorbed after oral administration and when injected its elimination is very slow. Lanthanum carbonate (Fosrenol) was approved as a phosphate binder <b>to</b> <b>absorb</b> excess phosphate {{in cases of}} end stage renal disease.|$|E
50|$|Wooden spokes {{are mounted}} radially. They are also dished, usually {{to the outside}} of the vehicle, to prevent wobbling. Also, the dishing allows the wheel to {{compensate}} for expansion of the spokes due <b>to</b> <b>absorbed</b> moisture by dishing more.|$|R
5000|$|... 1 Sv = 1 joule/kilogram - a {{biological}} effect. The sievert represents the equivalent biological {{effect of the}} deposit of a joule of radiation energy in a kilogram of human tissue. The equivalence <b>to</b> <b>absorbed</b> dose is denoted by Q.|$|R
50|$|As roentgens {{describe}} radiation, {{their relation}} <b>to</b> <b>absorbed</b> dose (which is usually important for safety) is not straightforward and depends on different absorption of radiated particles (alpha, beta, gamma or neutron). As {{a rule of}} thumb, 1 roentgen is approximately 10 mSv.|$|R
5|$|Many {{tropical}} butterflies have seasonal {{forms for}} dry and wet seasons. These are switched by the hormone ecdysone. The dry-season forms are usually more cryptic, perhaps offering better camouflage when vegetation is scarce. Dark colours in wet-season forms may help <b>to</b> <b>absorb</b> solar radiation.|$|E
5|$|Medaka and {{zebrafish}} {{are used}} as research models for studies in genetics and developmental biology. The zebrafish is {{the most commonly used}} laboratory vertebrate, offering the advantages of genetic similarity to mammals, small size, simple environmental needs, transparent larvae permitting non-invasive imaging, plentiful offspring, rapid growth, and the ability <b>to</b> <b>absorb</b> mutagens added to their water.|$|E
5|$|Mercury {{does not}} react with most acids, such as dilute sulfuric acid, {{although}} oxidizing acids such as concentrated sulfuric acid and nitric acid or aqua regia dissolve it to give sulfate, nitrate, and chloride. Like silver, mercury reacts with atmospheric hydrogen sulfide. Mercury reacts with solid sulfur flakes, {{which are used}} in mercury spill kits <b>to</b> <b>absorb</b> mercury (spill kits also use activated carbon and powdered zinc).|$|E

5|$|Reactors {{that use}} lithium-7 heat water under high {{pressure}} and transfer heat through heat exchangers that {{are prone to}} corrosion. The reactors use lithium to counteract the corrosive effects of boric acid, which {{is added to the}} water <b>to</b> <b>absorb</b> excess neutrons.|$|E
5|$|Soils {{contaminated}} with zinc from mining, refining, or fertilizing with zinc-bearing sludge can contain several grams of zinc per kilogram of dry soil. Levels of zinc {{in excess of}} 500ppm in soil interfere with the ability of plants <b>to</b> <b>absorb</b> other essential metals, such as iron and manganese. Zinc levels of 2000ppm to 180,000ppm (18%) have been recorded in some soil samples.|$|E
5|$|The 24th Infantry Division was {{the first}} US unit sent into Korea <b>to</b> <b>absorb</b> the initial North Korean advances, and disrupt the more {{numerous}} North Korean units.

50|$|Nearly all bromeliads have {{specialized}} cell groups called trichomes {{which form}} scales on the foliage.

5|$|The Montreal Laboratory in Montreal, Canada, was {{established}} by the National Research Council of Canada during World War II to undertake nuclear research {{in collaboration with the}} United Kingdom, and <b>to</b> <b>absorb</b> some of the scientists and work of the Tube Alloys nuclear project in Britain. It became part of the Manhattan Project, and designed and built some of the world's first nuclear reactors.|$|E
5|$|The {{existing}} underwater protection {{was replaced}} by the Pugliese system that consisted of a large cylinder surrounded by fuel oil or water that was intended <b>to</b> <b>absorb</b> the blast of a torpedo warhead. It lacked enough depth to be fully effective against contemporary torpedoes. A major problem of the reconstruction was that the ships' increased draft meant that their waterline armor belt was almost completely submerged with any significant load.|$|E
5|$|The outer, {{irregular}} moons {{are thought}} to have originated from captured asteroids, whereas the protolunar disk was still massive enough <b>to</b> <b>absorb</b> much of their momentum and thus capture them into orbit. Many are believed to have broken up by mechanical stresses during capture, or afterward by collisions with other small bodies, producing the moons we see today.|$|E

30|$|Bioabsorbable {{interference}} screws {{have been}} reported <b>to</b> be entirely <b>absorbed</b> and replaced by bone after around {{one to two years}} (Weiler et al., 2002 a; Weiler et al., 2002 b). Polylactid screws (Poly-L-Lactid, PLLA), which were used initially and thought <b>to</b> be <b>absorbed</b> over 3 <b>to</b> 5  years, were shown to sometimes not <b>to</b> get <b>absorbed</b> at all (Martinek et al., 2001; Stahelin et al., 1997). The ideal mixture of material is challenging, as absorption of the screw is a time-sensitive process.|$|R
