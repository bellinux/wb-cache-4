He was {{determined}} to become a success, and noticed the importance of news segments for satire. He wished for a news person to riff {{with him in the}} studio. Management paired Stern with Robin Quivers, a news anchor and consumer reporter from WFBR in Baltimore, who agreed to meet Stern after hearing him interview a prostitute on the air. Quivers at first [...] "thought I would come in and do the news...but it wasn't that way...he wanted someone to play off of...he wanted a real live person there with him". The show began to break format, and Stern held a lesbian edition of [...] "Dial-a-Date" [...] in May 1981. He formed the Think Tank, a cohesive trio of male listeners who conversed with Stern and played along with quizzes and routines, which helped the show sound more natural. By January 1982, Stern had the second highest-rated morning program in the city. On January 14, one day after the crash of Air Florida Flight 90, Stern made believe he asked Air Florida the price of a one-way ticket to the 14th Street Bridge, the location of the disaster. [...] "Is <b>that</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a permanent stop?" [...] asked Stern. On June 29, 1982, Stern's contract at WWDC was terminated. He writes that the Air Florida segment was not the reason for his departure, nor did anyone complain about it. He had signed a contract with WNBC in March, and began to berate management and other DJ's on the air. Quivers, who left the show early on June 17, worked at WCBM in Baltimore until rejoining with Stern on October 18, 1982. Stern presented a farewell show two weeks later on competing station WAVA-FM. He had more than tripled the station's ratings during his stay.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the problem most faced {{in the design of}} {{structures}} whether building or bridge which called buckling. Buckling is characterized by a sudden failure of a structural member subjected to high compressive stress, where the actual compressive stress at the point of failure is less than the ultimate compressive stresses that the material is capable of withstanding. For example, during earthquakes, reinforced concrete members may experience lateral deformation of the longitudinal reinforcing bars. This mode of failure is also described as failure due to elastic instability. Mathematical analysis of buckling makes use of an axial load eccentricity that introduces a moment, which does not form part of the primary forces to which the member is subjected. When load is constantly being applied on a member, such as column, it will ultimately become large enough to -cause the member to become unstable. Further load will cause significant and somewhat unpredictable deformations, possibly leading to complete loss of load-carrying capacity. The member is said to have buckled, to have deformed. In this research, the structure <b>that</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> analyzed is simple structure of column. The purpose of this research is to observe the effects of how a simple column reacts under loading with different displacement that will be applied. By varying the end supports of a column. will experience different modes of buckling. For the purposes of this project, a buckled column will be defined as a column that displays physical failure. The column is no longer able to support the loading and is forced to deflect laterally. The thesis describes the finite element analysis techniques to illustrate the column buckling modes. Using the ANSYS + CivilFEM Software will show the buckling mode and the stress of the column. Civi 1 FEM with ANSYS is the most comprehensive and advanced finite element based civil/structural engineering simulation code proven through use. It combines the leading engineering simulation software, ANSYS, and the high-end civil engineering specific structural analysis capabilities of Civi 1 FEM. In this research, there are steps that need to follow one by one in CiviIFEM with ANSYS Software. This step have been describes in the methodology in this thesis. In this research, there are four condition of displacement or support of the column which are pinned-pinned, fixed-fixed, pinned-fixed, and fixed-free. This research is also proven by the simple formula of column buckling which is Euler Formula. In general, columns do not always terminate with simply-supported ends. Therefore, the formula for the critical buckling load must be generalized. The generalized equation takes the form of Euler's formula, where the effective length of the column Leff depends on the boundary conditions...|$|E
