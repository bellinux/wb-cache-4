5|$|Eventually, {{the player}} {{character}} discovers a secret underground laboratory containing Umbrella's experiments. In the lab, the player finds Jill or Chris {{in a cell}} and encounters Wesker programming a Tyrant, a giant humanoid supersoldier. Wesker reveals {{that he is a}} double agent working for Umbrella, and plans to use <b>the</b> <b>Tyrant</b> to kill the remaining STARS members. However, in the ensuing confrontation, Wesker is supposedly killed and the player character defeats <b>the</b> <b>Tyrant.</b> After activating the lab's self-destruct system, the player character reaches the heliport and manages to contact Brad for extraction. The game features multiple endings depending on the player's actions at key points {{over the course of the}} game. In the best ending, the surviving team members escape by helicopter after defeating <b>the</b> <b>Tyrant</b> one last time. In contrast, in the worst possible ending, the mansion remains intact and the player character is the sole survivor.|$|E
5|$|Following their coordinated uprising, Michael the Brave {{attacked}} Ottoman strongholds {{along the}} Danube and recovered Giurgiu and Brăila, while Aaron <b>the</b> <b>Tyrant</b> seized Ismail (now in Ukraine). In response, the sultan ordered the Grand Vizier, Sinan Pasha to invade Wallachia. The two princes needed {{the support of}} Sigismund Báthory who {{took advantage of the}} situation to make himself suzerain of Wallachia and Moldavia. When Aaron <b>the</b> <b>Tyrant</b> refused Sigismund Báthory's conditions, he was replaced by the latter's protégé, Ştefan Răzvan (1595) on the throne.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Tyrants</b> in Therapy’s first {{recording}} experience {{occurred in}} Adelphia Cable’s Van Nuys Public-access television studio, after AbbeAbbe {{had suggested that}} shooting some lip sync footage from <b>the</b> Meet <b>The</b> <b>Tyrants</b> in Therapy studio album might help them secure a new booking agent. The results, although very rough, were encouraging enough to convince <b>the</b> <b>Tyrants</b> in Therapy to book more studio time. This material then {{became the basis for}} <b>the</b> Meet <b>The</b> <b>Tyrants</b> in Therapy television program.|$|R

5|$|Germanicus and Tiberius {{are often}} contrasted by ancient historians, poets who wrote using themes found in drama, with Germanicus playing the tragic hero and Tiberius <b>the</b> <b>tyrant.</b> The {{endurance}} of the Principate is challenged in these narratives, by the emperor's jealous trepidation toward competent commanders such as Germanicus. Attention is paid particularly to their leadership styles, i.e., {{in their relationship}} with the masses. Germanicus is painted as a competent leader able to handle the masses whereas Tiberius is indecisive and envious.|$|E
5|$|He soon {{embarked}} upon {{a program}} to strengthen the central authority by replacing {{the members of the}} sfatul domnesc, an advisory body consisting of boyars, with dregători, that is officials personally loyal to him. Michael the Brave also adopted an anti-Ottoman policy, and upon his initiative Sigismund Báthory of Transylvania and Aaron <b>the</b> <b>Tyrant</b> of Moldavia (15911595) signed a treaty to form an anti-Ottoman alliance. The rebellion started by the massacre of all the Ottomans in Wallachia on November 13, 1594.|$|E

5|$|Pericles {{was born}} c. 495 BC, in Athens, Greece. He {{was the son}} of the {{politician}} Xanthippus, who, though ostracized in 485–484 BC, returned to Athens to command the Athenian contingent in the Greek victory at Mycale just five years later. Pericles' mother, Agariste, a member of the powerful and controversial noble family of the Alcmaeonidae, and her familial connections {{played a crucial role in}} helping start Xanthippus' political career. Agariste was the great-granddaughter of <b>the</b> <b>tyrant</b> of Sicyon, Cleisthenes, and the niece of the Athenian reformer Cleisthenes.|$|E
5|$|The idea of anti-Ottoman {{struggle}} was revived by John III the Terrible (15721574) {{who refused to}} pay the tribute to the sultan. As a result, Ottoman and Wallachian troops invaded Moldavia, but they were defeated by John III in a surprise attack near Jilişte. Now the sultan sent a large army against Moldavia, and the prince was captured and quartered. Next Aaron <b>the</b> <b>Tyrant</b> joined the anti-Ottoman coalition of Transylvania and Wallachia, and started a rebellion on November 13, 1594, simultaneously with Michael the Brave of Wallachia.|$|E

5|$|Andrew {{exchanged}} {{letters with}} Aaron <b>the</b> <b>Tyrant,</b> Voivode of Moldavia, {{who had been}} captured by Sigismund Báthory because of his attempts {{to make peace with}} Poland and the Ottoman Empire. The pope's special envoy, Martio Malacrida, tried to convince Andrew to accept the post of the ambassador of Poland in Rome, but Andrew again refused. He said, his homeland would require his presence, because Sigismund's anti-Ottoman policy could not be continued for long. Letters found on one of Stephen Báthory's retainers suggested that Andrew and his brother sent letters to the leaders of the Székely commoners who had risen up against Sigismund Báthory in February 1596. Sigismund III of Poland summoned Andrew and Stephen before the Senate, but Pope Clement VIII intervened on the brothers' behalf.|$|E
5|$|At {{the demand}} of the sultan, Transylvania troops {{assisted}} Aaron <b>the</b> <b>Tyrant,</b> Voivode of Moldavia.

He also persuaded Sigismund to order the execution of Gálffy on 8March 1593. That summer, Sigismund went to Kraków in disguise to start negotiations regarding his marriage with Anna, the sister of SigismundIII of Poland. The Holy See had proposed the marriage, which could have enabled Sigismund to rule Poland during the absence of the king, who was also King of Sweden, but the plan came to nothing.|$|E

5|$|Indeed, {{this period}} in Greek history is {{remarkable}} {{for the social}} and political upheaval in many Greek cities, particularly the establishment of the first democracy in Athens. The island of Naxos, part of the Cyclades group in the Aegean Sea, was also in this period affected by political turmoil. Naxos had been ruled by <b>the</b> <b>tyrant</b> Lygdamis, a protege of the Athenian tyrant Peisistratos, until around 524 BC, when he was overthrown by the Spartans. After this, a native aristocracy seems to have flourished, and Naxos {{became one of the most}} prosperous and powerful of the Aegean islands. Despite its success, Naxos was not immune to class tensions and internal strife, and shortly before 500 BC, the population seized power, expelling the aristocrats and establishing a democracy.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Claire is {{reunited with}} Sherry and discovers that the mutated Birkin has {{implanted}} his daughter with an embryo to produce offspring. Leon, Ada, Claire and Sherry advance through an abandoned factory connected to Umbrella's secret underground research facility. An attack by Birkin leaves Ada heavily wounded, and Leon explores the laboratory {{to find something}} to treat her wounds. He is interrupted by a psychotic Annette, who explains to him that Ada's relationship with John was only a means of getting information about Umbrella: Ada is a spy sent to steal the G-virus for an unknown organization. Just as Annette is about to shoot Leon, <b>the</b> <b>Tyrant</b> appears, and she is forced to retreat. Ada returns to save Leon and battles <b>the</b> <b>Tyrant</b> – which falls into a pit of molten metal – seemingly at the cost of her own life. She confesses her love to Leon, who leaves behind her motionless body. Meanwhile, Annette tries to escape with another sample of the G-virus but is fatally wounded by her mutated husband. However, before she dies, she tells Claire how to create a vaccine that will stop the mutations caused by the embryo within Sherry. After preparing the cure, Leon and Claire reunite at an emergency escape train and inject Sherry with the vaccine, which saves her life. En route, Leon is assisted in terminating the now-mutated Tyrant by a woman in shadow, implying Ada's survival and escape with the G-virus in the pendant. Birkin– now mutated into a large agglomeration of flesh and teeth– follows the protagonists, but is destroyed when a self-destruct system causes the train to explode. After escaping from the city with Sherry, Leon intends to take down Umbrella, while Claire continues to search for her brother. Hunk, one of the special agents sent by Umbrella, is able to successfully complete his G-virus retrieval mission.|$|E
5|$|Philip II then {{involved}} Macedonia in the Third Sacred War (356–346BC). It {{began when}} Phocis captured and plundered {{the temple of}} Apollo at Delphi instead of submitting unpaid fines, causing the Amphictyonic League to declare war on Phocis and a civil war {{among the members of}} the Thessalian League aligned with either Phocis or Thebes. PhilipII's initial campaign against Pherae in Thessaly in 353BC at the behest of Larissa ended in two disastrous defeats by the Phocian general Onomarchus. PhilipII in turn defeated Onomarchus in 352BC at the Battle of Crocus Field, which led to PhilipII's election as leader (archon) of the Thessalian League, provided him a seat on the Amphictyonic Council, and allowed for a marriage alliance with Pherae by wedding Nicesipolis, niece of <b>the</b> <b>tyrant</b> Jason of Pherae.|$|E
