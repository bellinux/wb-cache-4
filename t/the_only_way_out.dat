5|$|Among the park's most {{distinctive}} and well-known features are the vehicular river crossings. At three places, crossing Pine Creek, fords were constructed instead of bridges. The fords offer visitors {{a chance to}} actually drive through the creek, though high water frequently closes the crossings. Hikers are relegated to pedestrian bridges or stepping stones in the creek to cross the stream. Floods are frequent enough on Pine Creek, a large watershed {{to the north of}} the park, that there is an emergency exit from the campground. When high water closes the fords, the campground is cut off and the emergency exit is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E
5|$|The first {{railway bridge}} to Montreal Island was the Grand Trunk Railway {{bridge across the}} Ottawa River East Channel. Along with another bridge built {{simultaneously}} across the West Channel, this bridge provided the first fixed link from Montreal to the mainland. It was not until 1925, however, that a fixed road link, formed by Galipeault Bridge and Taschereau Bridge, was built across the Ottawa River from Montreal Island. Perrot Island was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> of Montreal to the West before the construction of Île aux Tourtes Bridge, which goes directly to Vaudreuil across the Lake of Two Mountains.|$|E
5|$|The hunt of {{the pilot}} whale is known by the locals as the Grindadráp. There are no fixed hunting seasons. As soon as a pod close enough to land is spotted, the locals set out to begin the hunt, after {{approval}} from the sysselman. The animals are driven into a bay which is approved for whaling by the Faroese government, and then {{they try to make}} the whales to beach themselves. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> is being blocked off by some of the boats, which stay there until men who have been waiting on shore have slaughtered all the whales.|$|E

5|$|Yet while Solidarity {{was ready}} to take up {{negotiations}} with the government, the Polish communists were unsure what to do, as they issued empty declarations and bided their time. Against the background of a deteriorating communist shortage economy and unwillingness to negotiate seriously with Solidarity, it became increasingly clear that the Communist government would eventually have to suppress the Solidarity movement as <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> of the impasse, or face a truly revolutionary situation. The atmosphere was increasingly tense, with various local chapters conducting {{a growing number of}} uncoordinated strikes as well as street protests, such as the Summer 1981 hunger demonstrations in Poland, in response to the worsening economic situation. On December 3, 1981, Solidarity announced that a 24-hour strike would be held if the government were granted additional powers to suppress dissent, and that a general strike would be declared if those powers were used.|$|E

25|$|The Swiss {{capital of}} Bern was also heavily hit after the Aar burst its banks, {{and the town}} of Brienz saw 400 {{residents}} evacuated. The village of Lauterbrunnen in the Bernese Alps was completely cut off. The only exit from the town is by a very narrow gorge just wide enough to take the river, road and railway, and the river expanded to fill the entire gorge. This stranded thousands of tourists in the village, and <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> was by helicopter or by crossing one of the high Alpine passes.|$|E
25|$|However, being a governess {{was one of}} the few {{legitimate}} ways {{by which}} an unmarried middle class woman could support herself in Victorian society. Not surprisingly, her position was often depicted as one to be pitied, and <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> of it was to get married. Unfortunately, it was difficult for a governess to find a suitable husband because most of the eligible men she encountered were her social superiors, who preferred a bride from within their own social class, particularly since such women generally had better financial resources.|$|E
25|$|On 24 April {{a company}} led by von Coler took the Tali railway station 10 {{kilometres}} north of Vyborg, cutting the Vyborg–Joensuu railroad.

In the evening, von Coler defied his orders by attacking the city, but could not break through the Red defense {{on the eastern side}} of the Papula Bay.

25|$|As the Israeli {{advance on}} Beirut pressed {{forward in the}} west, {{reaching}} Khalde on June 11. Six miles south of Beirut, the town was the last PLO position in front of Beirut Airport. The Israelis, who stood {{on the outskirts of}} Beirut, advanced towards the airport, and engaged in frequent combat with PLO and Syrian units as Israeli warplanes continued to bomb PLO positions in Beirut. The PLO's situation gradually grew worse as the Israeli advance gained ground, threatening to trap the PLO and a Syrian brigade deployed with them in the city. With the Israelis advancing on the south and the eastern sector of Beirut held by Lebanese Christian forces, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> was on the Beirut-Damascus highway, and the Israelis were building up forces at Ain Dara in the eastern sector, which were in a position to strike at the highway and block any PLO attempt to escape. On June 12, the Israeli-Syrian cease-fire was extended to the PLO. As the Israeli advance halted, the Israelis turned their attention to the zone they already occupied in southern Lebanon, and began a policy to root out any PLO remnants. Israeli troops began searches for arms caches, and suspected PLO members were systematically rounded up and screened, and taken to a detention camp on the Amoun Heights.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Puente" [...] was {{released}} on 17 August 2010. It was directed by Argentinian director Joaquín Cambre, who also worked with Arjona on the music video for [...] "Sin Ti, Sin Mi". In the video, to brothers live separately, {{one of them in}} La Havana, and the other in Miami, Florida. The video ends with the boys encountering each other in a bridge, along many other people. The video shows the problematic about the migration on Cuba. Arjona shot the video while on his Quinto Piso Tour. It was filmed between Mexico and Argentina, with the collaboration of children from 5 to 13 age old. Coambre commented about the video that [...] ""Puente" [...] for me is an array of images that tell the same story in opposite realities. Two boys exactly alike; one lives in an abandoned hotel on the beach and the other lives in a big city skyscraper, yet both are equally lonely. Miami and Havana are where those two boys are in their own worlds and see that <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> of their realms are when they decide to encounter one another." ...|$|E
500|$|When Mitzeee {{realised}} Mercedes was her stalker, Mercedes knocked Mitzeee {{out after}} Mitzeee tries to stab her. Mercedes realised {{that she will}} be blamed for stalking Mitzeee so she stabbed herself to convince people Mitzeee was mad. Metcalfe said the situation was born through [...] "pure desperation". She said that [...] "the thought of Mitzeee, Riley and Bobby as a family together was too much for her to take, and she just saw red. I don't think it's something that Mercedes thought about or planned - she wouldn't have even dreamed of doing it to herself. But at the time, she saw it as <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> of the situation". Shenton explained that Mitzeee was worried due to the stalker so she decided to take some antidepressants and drink wine, which as she states [...] "isn't a great combination." [...] Shenton revealed that Mercedes arrived to see Mitzee who [...] "still has no idea who the stalker really is, but as they're talking, Mercedes says something that makes Mitzeee discover the truth - and she's totally shocked. Mitzeee is petrified and picks up a knife in the kitchen.

Mitzeee doesn't have a clue whether she could have stabbed Mercedes, or if someone else came into the flat and did it".|$|E
2500|$|When {{it became}} {{apparent}} that the Nazis were about to lose the war, Germany's leaders (including Goebbels and Hitler) spoke publicly in favor of suicide as an option. Hitler declared on 30 August 1944 during a military briefing, [...] "It’s only [...] of a second. Then one is redeemed of everything and finds tranquility and eternal peace." [...] Many supporters of Nazi ideology and party shared the apocalyptic message of National Socialism and looked forward to ending their lives.

2500|$|The {{dilemma of}} omnipotence {{is similar to}} another classic paradox—the irresistible force paradox: What would happen if an irresistible force were to meet an {{immovable}} object? One response to this paradox is to disallow its formulation, by saying that if a force is irresistible, then by definition there is no immovable object; or conversely, if an immovable object exists, then by definition no force can be irresistible. Some claim that <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> of this paradox is if the irresistible force and immovable object never meet. But {{this is not a}} way out, because an object cannot in principle be immovable if a force exists that can in principle move it, regardless of whether the force and the object actually meet.|$|E
2500|$|In 1984, California {{teenager}} John McCollum {{committed suicide}} {{while listening to}} Osbourne's [...] "Suicide Solution". The song deals with the dangers of alcohol abuse.
