50|$|In 2010, Padre Wolfgang S {{admitted}} to several acts {{of sexual abuse}} of minors during {{his years as a}} teacher in Sankt Blasius from 1982 to 1984. Prior to that he had taught in another Jesuit college in Berlin (Canisius-Kolleg) where he had also molested children.

5000|$|For the 1995 {{re-opening}} of {{the judicial}} investigation, the victims' bodies were exhumed, and a forensic report concluded that there had probably not been an explosion on the aircraft, although the possibility was not ruled out. After interviewing José Esteves, who later said he had manufactured a device for the attack, the criminal proceedings were suspended. A private prosecution launched by victims' relatives was declared time-barred in 1996, {{with the exception of}} one alleged conspirator, L.R., who was detained in Brazil on other matters, leading the 15-year time limit to be suspended in his case. In 1998 a district court judge in the L.R. private prosecution reaffirmed that the incident had been an accident, a decision upheld by the Court of Appeal in 2000 with an 800-page judgement. An attempt to re-open the case against L.R. in 2001 on grounds of new evidence was judged time-barred. Legal challenges were dismissed by the Supreme Court in 2006, and an appeal to the European Court of Human Rights was made in 2007 alleging breach of Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights on the grounds that the case had <b>become</b> <b>time-barred</b> due <b>to</b> the negligence of the Portuguese authorities. The Court concluded in 2011 [...] "that the substance of their right of access to a court had not been impaired by any negligence or failure to act on the part of the competent authorities".|$|R
