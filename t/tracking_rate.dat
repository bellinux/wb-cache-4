50|$|The {{effect of}} cooling was {{to expand the}} seeker's lead {{sulphide}} detector element's sensitivity range to longer wavelengths (slightly over 4 µm as opposed to 2.8 µm of uncooled PbS elements). In practice this made possible the tracking of cooler targets over longer ranges, and enabled forward-hemisphere engagement of jets under favourable circumstances.The seeker also had better <b>tracking</b> <b>rate,</b> enabling the missile to track maneuvering of fast and approaching targets.|$|E
5000|$|Besides the {{mechanical}} inability to easily follow celestial motion the altazimuth mount does have other limitations. The telescope's field-of-view rotates at varying speed as the telescope tracks, whilst the telescope body does not, requiring {{a system to}} counter-rotate {{the field of view}} when used for astrophotography or other types of astronomical imaging. The mount also has blind spot or [...] "zenith hole", a spot near the zenith where the <b>tracking</b> <b>rate</b> in the azimuth coordinate becomes too high to accurately follow equatorial motion. [...] These mounts also require a third axis to de-rotate the field as the telescope tracks.|$|E

50|$|The All-up-Round Test Sets include: Extreme {{temperature}} testing; Missile tracker testing (<b>Track</b> <b>rate</b> error, <b>Tracking</b> sensitivity); Seeker/focal plane array testing (Cool-down time, Dead/defective pixels, Seeker identification); Pneumatic leakage; Continuity measurements; Ready time; and Guidance sections (Guidance commands, Fin movement).|$|R
50|$|After {{activating}} {{the power}} {{supply to the}} missile electronics, the gunner waits for electricity supply and gyros to stabilize, puts the sights on target and tracks it smoothly with the launch tube's iron sights, and pulls the trigger on the grip stock. This activates the seeker electronics and the missile attempts to lock onto the target. If the target is producing a strong enough signal and the angular <b>tracking</b> <b>rate</b> is within acceptable launch parameters, the missile alerts the gunner that the target is locked on by illuminating a light in the sight mechanism, and producing a constant buzzing noise. The operator then has 0.8 seconds to provide lead to the target while the missile's on-board power supply is activated and the throw-out motor ignited.|$|E
50|$|Audio {{synchronizers}} {{that use}} variable speed reading are generally preferred in professional applications. The control of audio delay is generally more accurate and more easily accomplished. Pitch errors in lower performance devices are uncompensated and {{kept to a}} level generally not perceived by the average viewer, by limiting the amount of change of reading speed. Typically the change limit is {{in the order of}} 0.2%. Unfortunately, this limits the rate of delay change and when large video delay changes occur the slow <b>tracking</b> <b>rate</b> of these uncompensated synchronizers can cause the audio video sync to be off for several seconds or minutes until the audio delay catches up with the video delay. Additionally, listeners with excellent pitch perception may notice and be annoyed by even these small pitch errors.|$|E
50|$|This is the Chinese {{equivalent}} of French Mistral missile, with fuse developed {{from that of}} QW-2. The missile is unique among Chinese MANPAD in {{that this is the}} only surface-to-air missile that adopts the semi-active laser guidance similar to AGM-114 Hellfire. The gyro stabilized seeker provides very high degree of accuracy and is extremely effective against low altitude cruise missiles. The 15 degrees per second <b>tracking</b> <b>rate</b> of the seeker is relatively low in comparison for other MANPAD for supersonic targets in high g maneuver at very high altitudes, but this is by no means handicapping the performance because such targets are not intended to be for QW-3, which is specifically designed to engage terrain hugging helicopters and UAV’s and other fast flying targets at extremely low altitudes, including supersonic sea skimming cruise missiles.|$|E

50|$|This {{situation}} {{leads to}} the use of a number of designs that use a relatively wide FOV to allow easy tracking, and then process the received signal in some way to gain additional accuracy for guidance. Generally the entire seeker assembly is mounted on a gimbal system that allows it to track the target through wide angles, and the angle between the seeker and the missile aircraft is used to produce guidance corrections. This gives rise the concepts of instantaneous field of view (IFOV) which is the angle the detector sees, and the overall field of view, also known as the tacking angle or off-boresight capability, which includes the movement of the entire seeker assembly. Since the assembly cannot move instantly, a target moving rapidly across the missile's line of flight may be lost from the IFOV, which gives rise to the concept of a <b>tracking</b> <b>rate,</b> normally expressed in degrees per second.|$|E
50|$|The lower <b>tracking</b> <b>rate</b> is {{programmed}} to a value about 10 bpm above the sinus rate to achieve AV sequential pacing. Then the AV delay for atrial pacing remains {{programmed to}} the chosen arbitrary value of 150 ms {{and the rate}} adaptation of the AV delay remains disabled.Now approximation of the optimal AV delay takes place as in DDD pacing:1. With the preset AV delay the interval between the left atrial deflection (LA) in the filtered esophageal left atrial electrogram (LAE), and the ventricular stimulus (Vp) is measured.2. Then the preset AV delay (in this case 150 ms) is corrected by the amount the measured LA-Vp interval is deviating from the target value (70 ms in AV block and 50 ms in congestive heart failure patients, respectively).The resulting AV delay (prolonged if LA-Vp is shorter, shortened if LA-Vp is longer than the target value) is the approximate optimal AV interval for atrial sensing. After programming this optimal AV delay, the best possible approximation of the interval LA-Vp to the target value can be checked in the LAE.|$|E
50|$|The lower <b>tracking</b> <b>rate</b> is {{programmed}} to a value below the sinus rate to achieve atrial controlled ventricular pacing. Then the AV delay is preset to an arbitrary value, but, for practical reasons, {{the use of}} a standard value (e. g. 150 ms) in all cases and in both modes is recommended. The rate adaptation of the AV delay has to be disabled.Now approximation of the optimal AV delay is accomplished in two steps:1. With the preset AV delay, the interval between the left atrial deflection (LA) in the filtered esophageal left atrial electrogram (LAE) and the ventricular stimulus (Vp) is measured.2. Then the preset AV delay (in this case 150 ms) is corrected by the amount the measured LA-Vp interval is deviating from the target value (70 ms in AV block and 50 ms in congestive heart failure patients, respectively).The resulting AV delay (prolonged if LA-Vp is shorter, shortened if LA-Vp is longer than the target value) is the approximately optimal AV interval for atrial sensing.

These three components are determined using a laser rangefinder, crosswind sensor, a pendulum static cant sensor, data concerning performance and flight characteristics of each specific type of round, tank-specific boresight alignment data, ammunition temperature, air temperature, barometric pressure, a muzzle reference system (MRS) that determines and compensates for barrel drop at the muzzle due to gravitational pull and barrel heating due to firing or sunlight, and target speed determined by <b>tracking</b> <b>rate</b> tachometers in the Gunner's or Commander's Controls Handles. All of these factors are computed into a ballistic solution and updated 30 times per second. The updated solution is displayed in the Gunner's or Tank Commander's field of view in the form of a reticle in both day and Thermal modes. The ballistic computer manipulates the turret and a complex arrangement of mirrors so that all one has to do is keep the reticle on the target and fire to achieve a hit. Proper lead and gun tube elevation are applied to the turret by the computer, greatly simplifying the job of the gunner.|$|E

3000|$|The {{projective}} {{particle filter}} performs {{better on the}} three different measures. The projective transform leads {{to a reduction in}} resampling frequency since the distribution of the particles carries accurately the posterior and, consequently, the degeneracy of the particle set is slower. The mean squared error is reduced since the particles focus around the actual position and size of the vehicle. The drift rate benefits from the projective transform since the tracker is less distracted by similar objects or by occlusion. The improvement is beneficial for applications that require vehicle [...] "locking" [...] such as vehicle counts or other applications for which performance is not based on the MSE. It is worthwhile noting here that the MSE and the <b>tracking</b> <b>rate</b> are independent: it can be observed from Figure 9 that the <b>tracking</b> <b>rate</b> is almost the same for Video_ 005, Video_ 006, and Video_ 008, but there is a factor of 2 between the MSE's of Video_ 005 and Video_ 008 (see Table 2).|$|E
40|$|In deep-space optical communications, acquisition, tracking, and {{pointing}} are all challenging {{because of the}} stringent—on the order of submicroradian—pointing requirement. To achieve this level of pointing accuracy, one must maintain high-bandwidth tracking control. Feasible tracking sources (beacons) include uplink laser beams and celestial objects such as the Earth, Moon, and stars. However, these tracking sources do not all provide the kilohertz <b>tracking</b> <b>rate</b> needed for pointing in deep space. One approach to enable a high <b>tracking</b> <b>rate</b> is to augment the tracking loop with inertial sensors to estimate high-frequency beacon movements. In this article, we discuss the use of linear accelerometers, mounted in a configuration to measure angular displacement, to achieve high-bandwidth tracking with dim beacon sources.
