5|$|The Apple River Fort Historic Foundation began {{attempting}} {{to locate the}} original site of the fort {{in the spring of}} 1995. Local tales <b>told</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fort being situated on a hill not far from Main Street in Elizabeth. The group, unable to determine the veracity of the tale, hired an archaeologist to determine the location of the old frontier fortification.|$|E

5|$|Chotiner {{was given}} an office at the RNC, {{nominally}} as the official in charge of tickets for the inauguration. RNC chairman Ray Bliss and his aides were disturbed by his presence, and were told he would be gone after January 20. Meanwhile, Nixon and his aides considered a new RNC chairman finally settling on Maryland Congressman Rogers Morton, who agreed to take the position once Bliss left, though Morton was not <b>told</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> promise to Chotiner. When the President-elect met with Bliss on January 10, 1969, he could {{not bring himself to}} fire the chairman. With the situation unresolved, and Morton's appointment unannounced, Chotiner sat in his RNC office for a month after the inauguration with nothing to do, as the RNC staff wondered at his presence.|$|E
5|$|In his profession, Coward {{was widely}} admired and loved for his {{generosity}} and kindness {{to those who}} fell on hard times. Stories are <b>told</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> unobtrusive {{way in which he}} relieved the needs or paid the debts of old theatrical acquaintances who had no claim on him. From 1934 until 1956, Coward was the president of the Actors Orphanage, which was supported by the theatrical industry. In that capacity, he befriended the young Peter Collinson, who was in the care of the orphanage. He became Collinson's godfather and helped him to get started in show business. When Collinson was a successful director, he invited Coward {{to play a role in}} The Italian Job. Graham Payn also played a small role in the film.|$|E
5|$|Local weavers {{specialised}} in {{the production}} of kersey, a hardwearing and inexpensive woollen fabric that was often used for military uniforms; by the 16thcentury Halifax and the surrounding Calder Valley was the largest producer of the material in England. In the final part of the manufacturing process the cloth was hung outdoors on large structures known as tenterframes and left to dry, after having been conditioned by a fulling mill. Daniel Defoe wrote a detailed account of what he had been <b>told</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gibbet's history during his visit to Halifax in Volume 3 of his A tour thro' the whole island of Great Britain, published in 1727.|$|E

5|$|On 2 August 1944, the SS {{cleared the}} Gypsy camp.

The {{surviving}} population (estimated at 2,897 to 5,600) was then killed en masse in the gas chambers. The murder of the Romani people by the Nazis during World War II is known in the Romani language as the Porajmos (devouring).|$|E
5|$|On 3 December 1846, Brunner began {{what became}} his longest and most arduous expedition. He planned {{to follow the}} Buller River to the sea and then trek down the West Coast {{as far south as}} Milford Sound. During his {{previous}} expedition, he had been <b>told</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> existence of a route through the Southern Alps by the Māori at the Arahura River. He hoped to discover this route and use it to cross the Southern Alps and reach Canterbury. He was accompanied once again by Kehu, who brought along his wife. Another Māori, Pitewate, a friend of Kehu's, also joined the venture, accompanied by his wife. Brunner provided clothing and shoes for his companions. The wives proved problematic during the journey as they quarrelled, sometimes supported by their husbands, and Brunner would have to mediate.|$|E
5|$|Other {{scientists}} {{criticized the}} project as being potentially unsafe for the local wildlife and the Inupiat people living near the designated area, who were not officially <b>told</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plan until March 1960. Additionally, {{it turned out that}} the harbor would be ice-bound for nine months out of the year. In the end, due to the financial infeasibility of the project and the concerns over radiation-related health issues, the project was abandoned in 1962.|$|E

5|$|Pembrokeshire and Cardiganshire are {{adjoining}} historical {{counties in}} SW Wales. Different tales have been <b>told</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> corgi's origin: {{some believe that}} the two modern breeds evolved from a shared ancestry, while others attribute the import of the Pembroke Welsh Corgi to Flemish weavers starting around the 10th century. Further theories {{on the origin of}} the Pembroke variety suggest that they may have originated from central European herding breeds from the area around modern Germany. Depending on the time period when these dogs were imported to Wales, they could have been either the extinct Deutsches Brachen, or the Dachshund breed.|$|E
5|$|Screenwriter Andrew Davies {{said he was}} {{attracted}} to the story because it featured a girl transitioning into womanhood and it included his interests in Victorian erotica; he compared it to Pride and Prejudice—for which he wrote the BBC screenplay—"with dirty bits". Both Waters and Davies {{were concerned about the}} use of dildos in scenes with Diana, but the BBC allowed it. When news releases <b>told</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> BBC featuring swearing and sex toys, the Daily Mail reported that viewers began to protest. BBC representatives downplayed the gratuitousness of the story, comparing it to Moll Flanders.|$|E
5|$|The nine-year-old Edward {{wrote to}} his father and {{stepmother}} on 10 January 1547 from Hertford thanking them for his new year's gift of their portraits from life. By 28 January 1547, Henry VIII was dead. Those close to the throne, led by Edward Seymour and William Paget, agreed to delay {{the announcement of the}} king's death until arrangements had been made for a smooth succession. Seymour and Sir Anthony Browne, the Master of the Horse, rode to collect Edward from Hertford and brought him to Enfield, where Lady Elizabeth was living. He and Elizabeth were then <b>told</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> death of their father and heard a reading of the will.|$|E

5|$|Throughout its range, {{the giant}} otter interacts with {{indigenous}} groups, who often practice traditional hunting and fishing. A study of five indigenous communities in Colombia suggests native {{attitudes toward the}} animal are a threat: the otters are often viewed as a nuisance that interferes with fishing, and are sometimes killed. Even when <b>told</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> importance of the species to ecosystems and the danger of extinction, interviewees showed little interest in continuing to coexist with the species. Schoolchildren, however, had a more positive impression of the animal.|$|E
5|$|When the Scott family awoke {{the next}} morning, Beauchamp {{emerged from his}} quarters. He feigned {{surprise}} when <b>told</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> murder and was apparently believed at the time. After being told there were no suspects yet, he called for his horse and began his return trip of four days to Bowling Green. Arriving, he told his wife Anna that Sharp was dead. The next morning, a posse from Frankfort arrived and told Beauchamp that he was under suspicion for the murder. He agreed to return with the men to Frankfort and face the charge.|$|E
5|$|While waiting, {{he hears}} an {{explosion}} nearby, {{and leaves the}} room to investigate. He finds two men trapped by fallen components in a fire-engulfed room. Wesley helps to release one man wounded under a heavy pipe, and tries to coax the other man to leave the burning room, but the man refuses. Wesley is forced to leave the scared man inside and drags the other man to safety. Outside the room, he soon realizes this was the psychological test. Eventually, the cadets are <b>told</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> results, and Mordock is granted admission into Starfleet Academy, while Wesley is encouraged to try again next year. Mordock thanks Wesley for his help and wishes him future success. After Wesley returns to the Enterprise, Picard confides in him that he also failed the examination the first time.|$|E

5|$|A grandniece of Anne Boleyn {{and close}} to Elizabeth since childhood, Lettice Knollys was {{introduced}} early into court life. At 17 she married Walter Devereux, Viscount Hereford, who in 1572 became Earl of Essex. After her husband went to Ireland in 1573 she possibly became involved with Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester. There was plenty of scandalous talk, not least when Essex died in Ireland of dysentery in 1576. Two years later Lettice Knollys married Robert Dudley in private. When the Queen was <b>told</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> marriage she banished the Countess forever from court, effectively curtailing her social life. The couple's child, Robert, Lord Denbigh, {{died at the age}} of three, to the great grief of his parents and ending all prospects for the continuance of the House of Dudley. Lettice Knollys' union with Leicester was nevertheless a happy one, as was her third marriage to the much younger Sir Christopher Blount, whom she unexpectedly married in 1589 only six months after the Earl's death. She continued to style herself Lady Leicester.|$|E
5|$|On 22 May, the fleet—now {{reduced to}} only two ships—rounded the Cape of Good Hope. They arrived in Beseguiche (now Dakar, located near Cape Verde) on 2 June. There they found not only Nicolau Coelho's caravel {{but also the}} nau captained by Diogo Dias—which had been lost {{for over a year}} {{following}} the disaster in the South Atlantic. The nau had experienced several adventures of its own and was now in poor condition with only seven sick and malnourished men aboard—one of whom was so weak that he died of happiness upon again seeing his comrades. Another Portuguese fleet was also found riding at anchor in Beseguiche. After Manuel I had been <b>told</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> discovery of what is now Brazil, he sent another and smaller fleet to explore it. One of its navigators was Amerigo Vespucci (for whom the Americas would be named), who told Cabral of his exploration, confirming that he had indeed made landfall on an entire continent and not merely an island.|$|E
5|$|Some {{weeks after}} their encounter, word reached Le Gris of accusations being made against him by Carrouges and his wife. It {{will never be}} known what basis these {{allegations}} had in fact but Carrouges claimed that on 18 January 1386, whilst Carrouges was still in Paris, Le Gris had entered the chateau of Carrouges' mother Nicole and there raped Marguerite. According to Marguerite de Carrouges' testimony, a squire in Le Gris' employ named Adam Louvel had {{knocked on the door}} of the chateau and demanded entry. All the servants were attending to Dame Nicole de Carrouges, who was visiting a neighbouring town on legal business, and so Marguerite was alone when Louvel called. Once inside, Louvel gave Marguerite a message that Le Gris was outside and desired to see her because he was passionately in love with her. Although Marguerite protested, Le Gris broke into the house and propositioned her, offering money in exchange. When Marguerite refused, Le Gris attempted to take her by force and raped her on the bed in her chamber with the help of Louvel. As Le Gris departed, he threatened her with violence if she <b>told</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> encounter.|$|E
