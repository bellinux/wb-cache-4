5|$|As British offshoots, the Australian colonies {{participated in}} Britain's small {{wars of the}} 19th century, while later as a federated dominion, and then an {{independent}} nation, Australia fought in the First World War and Second World War, {{as well as in}} the wars in Korea, Malaya, Borneo and Vietnam during the Cold War. In the Post-Vietnam era Australian forces have been involved in numerous international peacekeeping missions, <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>Nations</b> and other agencies, including in the Sinai, Persian Gulf, Rwanda, Somalia, East Timor and the Solomon Islands, as well as many overseas humanitarian relief operations, while more recently they have also fought as part of multi-lateral forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. In total, nearly 103,000 Australians died during the course of these conflicts.|$|E
5|$|The {{capture of}} the Royal Irish patrol and the {{effectiveness}} of the operation to free them prompted the British government to increase its support of UNAMSIL, both politically and through the provision of staff officers to assist UNAMSIL's operational headquarters (though not with a significant contribution of peacekeepers, despite considerable lobbying). The British also applied political pressure <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>Nations</b> Security Council on the Revolutionary United Front (RUF)—the second main party to the civil war after the government—and on Sierra Leone's neighbour Liberia, which had provided support to the RUF. The new approach, combined with a larger and more powerful UNAMSIL, hastened the demobilisation of the RUF and thus the end of the Sierra Leone Civil War.|$|E

After the operation, the British government increased its support of UNAMSIL and its efforts to bring the civil war to an end, both politically, <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>Nations</b> Security Council, and through the provision of staff officers to support UNAMSIL.

5|$|On October26, United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton {{stated that}} the country would provide {{emergency}} assistance and aid to Myanmar.

The governments of Britain and Japan also pledged to donate US$700,000 and US$500,000 respectively to Myanmar. The World Food Programme sent 900tonnes (992tons) of rice with another 300tonnes (330tons) on the way; stocks of rice in Kyaukpyu itself had reportedly been exhausted. By late-November, the World Food Programme had allocated US$2.8million in relief funds.

5|$|Immediately after Eline struck Madagascar, the {{government}} began distributing relief items, such as rice, tents, and sheets. On February 21, survey flights helped indicate the extent of damage across the nation. Supplies were distributed by road from Antananarivo to the worst affected areas, with helicopters dropping off aid to isolated communities. After receiving request from the Malagasy government, UNICEF flew 15 tons of supplies from Copenhagen, such as medicine, 10.5 tons of food, and equipment to help coordinate relief work. The agency also transported thousands of blankets and water purification tablets from Antananarivo. However, UNICEF faced difficulties in distributing the supplies. The government of France sent two helicopters with teams of doctors to Madagascar, and Médecins Sans Frontières sent about 35 tons of supplies, such as medicine, water purifying devices, and food. The World Food Programme flew about 400 tons of food to affected residents across the country, including 25 tons to Mahanoro. Due to the combined impacts of Eline and Gloria, {{the government}} of Madagascar requested for international assistance on March 7, which was coordinated <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>Nations</b> Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. In response, {{the government of the}} United Kingdom donated £1.3 million ($1.9 million USD) to Madagascar. The Organisation of African Unity donated $200,000 to Madagascar on March 10. In addition to Cyclone Gloria striking the country in March, Cyclone Hudah hit eastern Madagascar in early April, causing additional deaths and damage.|$|E

The Canadian government donated $485,000, and {{the government}} of Japan sent $400,000 in aid. The government of France provided blankets, clothing, and tarpaulins, and the United States sent 5,000blankets. In the days after the storm, the Haitian Army and international workers made emergency repairs to the road between Jacmel and Port-au-Prince, which was permanently reopened on November25. The Haitian government provided $3.2million to repair damage and assist those affected by the storm. The government sent about $112,000 to cities to provide for clearing roads, housing repairs, and for the funerals of storm victims. Workers from the United Nations set up relief work in Port-au-Prince. Assistance quickly reached the ravaged town of Jacmel, including 116tons of food, 9tons of medicine, and clothing. Six soldiers from the United States Special Forces rescued 35Haitians using an inflatable boat. About 100soldiers from the 10th Mountain Division assisted in relief operations in Jacmel, rescuing hundreds of people. About 12,000United States troops were already in the country when Gordon struck to restore democracy under ousted president Jean-Bertrand Aristide.|$|E

40|$|Sanitation {{and solid}} waste {{management}} systems have recently received major attention <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>Nation</b> Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Increasingly, the role of civil society organizations – most notably Community Based Organisations (CBOs) and Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) – in providing sanitation and {{solid waste management}} services to underserved, marginalized, poor or hardly accessible areas and communities is widely celebrated, as fully public and private schemes {{are thought to be}} less capable and willing to serve these areas and groups effectively. But {{little is known about the}} actual performance of NGOs and CBOs in urban environmental service provisioning in East African cities. This study explores and compares the extent and success of civil society organizations in providing urban sanitation and solid waste services for the poor in the capitals of Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. Using ideas of modernized mixtures and institutional pluralism we clarify the particular role of civil society institutions among a plurality of urban environmental service arrangements in East African cities. Major differences are found in CBO/NGO involvement in sanitation and solid waste provisioning, in the socio-economic characteristics of NGO/CBO service recipients and non-recipients, and in levels of appreciation of these systems...|$|R

In the profiles Off avoids describing places and events but provides a chapter to [...] "a Grapes of Wrath-style description of her two locales". The biographies compare and contrast the strategy and effect of each person's approach to their mission. One reviewer compared the profiles of Dallaire and MacKenzie to Suetonius's biographies of Athenian generals Nicias and Alcibiades. Suetonius portrayed Nicias as honourable, moderate, and effective but over-shadowed by the more vocal and polarizing Alcibiades. Likewise, Off portrayed Dallaire as the more honourable commander but over-shadowed by the more media savvy and callous MacKenzie. Off's focus on moral choices was called [...] "a feminist approach" [...] by {{several members of the}} Department of National Defence.|$|E
