5|$|In early September, Levene {{was fired}} from <b>the</b> <b>Clash.</b> Strummer would claim that Levene's dwindling {{interest}} in the band owed to his supposedly extravagant use of speed, a charge Levene has denied. Levene and Lydon would form Public Image Ltd. in 1978. On 21 September, <b>the</b> <b>Clash</b> performed publicly {{for the first time}} without Levene at another seminal concert: the 100 Club Punk Special, sharing the bill with the Sex Pistols, Siouxsie and the Banshees and Subway Sect. Chimes left in late November; he was briefly replaced by Rob Harper as <b>the</b> <b>Clash</b> toured in support of the Sex Pistols during December's Anarchy Tour.|$|E
5|$|Jović {{is largely}} viewed in Croatia {{as the first}} {{casualty}} of the Croatian War of Independence. A monument dedicated to him was erected in his birthplace of Aržano in 1994.

5|$|On 26 April 2008, Drogba faced {{controversy}} after a {{clash with}} Manchester United defender Nemanja Vidić. The Serbian centre-back {{had to have}} stitches under his lip after losing a tooth in <b>the</b> <b>clash.</b> There was discussion whether Drogba had the intention or not to injure his rival. The debate also called into question an earlier incident on 26 November 2006 where Drogba elbowed Vidić. Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson expressed concerns over elbowing in the Premier League. Despite media speculation, Drogba's yellow card for <b>the</b> <b>clash</b> was deemed adequate punishment by the Football Association.|$|E
5|$|After rehearsing with Strummer {{for less}} than a month, <b>the</b> <b>Clash</b> made their debut on 4 July 1976, {{supporting}} the Sex Pistols at the Black Swan in Sheffield. The band apparently wanted to make it on-stage before their rivals in the Damned—another London SS spinoff—made their own scheduled debut two days later. <b>The</b> <b>Clash</b> would not play {{in front of an audience}} again for another five weeks. Levene was becoming disaffected with his position in the group. At the Black Swan, he approached the Sex Pistols' lead singer, John Lydon (then going by Johnny Rotten), and suggested they form a band together if the Pistols broke up.|$|E

By 5 May, the situation in Odessa had calmed, though the atmosphere remained extremely tense.|$|R

5|$|In August 1979, {{the band}} entered Wessex Studios to begin {{recording}} London Calling. <b>The</b> <b>Clash</b> asked Guy Stevens {{to produce the}} album, much {{to the dismay of}} CBS Records. Stevens had alcohol and drug problems and his production methods were unconventional. During a recording session he swung a ladder and upturned chairs – apparently to create a rock & roll atmosphere. <b>The</b> <b>Clash,</b> especially bassist Paul Simonon, got along well with Stevens, and found Stevens' work to be very helpful and productive to both Simonon's playing and their recording as a band. The album was recorded during a five- to six-week period involving 18-hour days, with many songs recorded in one or two takes.|$|E

50|$|The city of Odessa {{announced}} that {{three days of}} mourning would be held in honour of those {{who lost their lives}} in <b>the</b> <b>clashes.</b> Ukrainian interim President Oleksandr Turchynov followed suit, declaring two days of national mourning for those who died in <b>the</b> <b>clashes,</b> also those who died during a government counter-offensive in Donetsk Oblast.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>clash</b> at the Plitvice Lakes worsened {{the overall}} {{situation}} in Croatia {{and led to}} an escalation of the conflict. Even though the Croatian and Serb forces were separated by the JNA at the Plitvice Lakes, {{the situation in the}} area continued to deteriorate following <b>the</b> <b>clash.</b> In nearby Plaški, Croatian police personnel left the local police station and were replaced by Serb officers. Both SAO Krajina and Croatian forces set up several roadblocks on the Saborsko–Lička Jasenica–Ogulin road. By summer, the blockades were extended to the north of Plaški and south of Saborsko, where Croatian authorities established another 30-strong police station on 2 April. Only JNA vehicles were permitted to pass the roadblocks, and that brought about a shortage of food, medicine and electricity in the area.|$|E
5|$|Though <b>the</b> <b>Clash</b> {{continued}} to tour, tension {{continued to}} increase. In early 1983, Chimes left the band after the Combat Rock Tour because of in-fighting and turmoil. He {{was replaced by}} Pete Howard for the US Festival in San Bernardino, California, which <b>the</b> <b>Clash</b> co-headlined, along with David Bowie and Van Halen. The band argued with the event's promoters over inflated ticket prices, threatening to pull out unless a large donation was made to a local charity. The group ultimately performed on 28 May, the festival's New Music Day, which drew a crowd of 140,000. After the show, members of the band brawled with security staff. This was Jones' last appearance with the group: in September 1983, he was fired. Shortly thereafter, he became {{a founding member of}} General Public, but left that band as they were recording their first album.|$|E

5|$|After Combat Rock, <b>the</b> <b>Clash</b> {{began to}} disintegrate. Headon {{was asked to}} leave the band just before the album's release because heroin {{addiction}} was damaging his health and drumming. Chimes was brought back to drum {{for the next few}} months. The loss of Headon, well-liked by the others, exposed growing friction within the band. Jones and Strummer began to feud. The band opened for the Who on a leg of their final tour in the US, including a show at New York's Shea Stadium.|$|E

The video was released by al-Qaeda's media wing, as-Sahab and subtitled in English.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} their second album, <b>the</b> <b>Clash</b> {{had started to}} depart from the punk rock sound. While touring in the United States twice in 1979, they chose {{supporting}} acts such as rhythm and blues artists Bo Diddley, Sam & Dave, Lee Dorsey, and Screamin' Jay Hawkins, as well as neotraditional country artist Joe Ely and punk rockabilly band the Cramps. This developed fascination with rock and roll inspired their approach for London Calling.|$|E
50|$|On July 20, 2010, clashes {{broke out}} between Houthis {{and members of}} an army-backed tribe, led by Sheikh Sagheer Aziz, {{in the region of}} Souffian.

Forty-nine people were reported killed in <b>the</b> <b>clashes,</b> including 20 tribal and 10 Houthi fighters. The Houthis also managed to surround the Yemeni military bases in the region. Over the following days the Yemeni army and pro-government Bin Aziz tribes continued to <b>clash</b> with <b>the</b> Houthis. The government claimed that in the following two days, 20 fighters were killed on each side.
