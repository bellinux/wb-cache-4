40|$|Now a dayâ€™s Electricity {{become one}} of the basic needs in our life. In order to {{generate}} the electricity the conventional and non-conventional methods are used, in both the methods the prime mover is needed to rotate the generator at constant speed. In that situation {{there is a need for}} some external devices to measure the speed of the machines. Our research focused meant to design the embedded based self-powered <b>tacho</b> <b>generator.</b> The proposed system has the LED display and analog voice modulation to indicate the relevant speed. In our research idea we implement the result in Keil C software and results were discussed...|$|E
40|$|In this study, a PI {{controlled}} separately excited {{direct current}} (DC) motor speed has been controlled using PIC 16 F 877 controller. In the PIC 16 F 877 programming as a PI controller, {{the speed of}} the motor is expected to follow the reference speed. Speed of the motor is measured by a <b>tacho</b> <b>generator</b> and then, the voltage applied to the motor is adjusted by a semiconductor power switch using pulse width modulation (PWM) technique. Drive circuit was tested with 0. 9 kW DC motor. Experimental results show that the drive circuit developed is very simple, useful, sensible, economical and flexible to apply for different applications...|$|E
