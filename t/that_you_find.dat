500|$|Ford {{continued}} to excel as a pass-rusher in 1951, when the Browns again {{advanced to the}} NFL Championship Game but lost to the Rams. He recovered four fumbles during the season and was named a first-team All-Pro by both the Associated Press (AP) and the United Press International (UPI). He was also named to the Pro Bowl, the NFL's all-star game. Ford's dominating play allowed Brown to assign him to two offensive linemen, giving Cleveland the latitude to put four men {{on the line and}} use three linebackers in what is now known as the 4–3 defense. Cleveland's defensive coach Blanton Collier later recalled the thinking behind moving Ford: [...] "We knew we had to get him in closer where his talents as a pass rusher could best be utilized. [...] So we moved both tackles in and dropped the linebackers off the outside. [...] It may have been the beginning of today's 4–3 defense." [...] Collier also noted that [...] "Len was very aggressive and had that touch of meanness in him <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> in most defensive players." ...|$|E
500|$|Mylod {{additionally}} {{spoke about}} filming the final {{scenes of the}} episode, the foot chase between Arya and the Waif, in the behind the scenes featurette published by HBO after the airing of the episode. Mylod stated that he did extensive research {{in order to create}} the foot chase, saying [...] "I devoured every foot chase in the history of cinema, but trying to take from that something that would fit into the blueprint of the Game of Thrones visual style, which is not necessarily the same kind of kinetic, handheld feel <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> in many contemporary thrillers. It's a much more classic frame." [...] He continued, [...] "Everything hinged from finding this very lovely, steep stairwell and thinking 'Wouldn't it be great if she leapt off that, and then tumbled down the stairs?' I had this image in my head that I wanted lots of oranges rolling down, not quite sure where that comes from, but it looked pretty." [...] Mylod also stated in a separate interview that it was a conscious decision not to show the final fight between Arya and the Waif, given that it took place in the dark, noting [...] "when the character dies in the dark, unless we switch on night-vision goggles, we're {{not going to be able}} to see that, and we're not going to stick around to hear a scream in the dark anyway. It was actually a conscious choice in the writing and I think, for me, a very elegant storytelling beat as to get that reveal a few seconds later." ...|$|E

2500|$|Due to Forester's {{investing}} {{style of}} buying low P/E stocks with good earnings prospects, he {{is compared to}} Warren Buffett. Forester loosely quotes Buffett at times such as in Barron's Magazine when he said: [...] "It's When The Tide Goes out <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> out who's swimming without a bathing suit. I have mine on." [...] Although he is now likened to Buffett, Forester maintains Templeton as his role model. [...] He invests by the philosophy credo that [...] "I buy undervalued stocks, {{and if there are}} none, I go to cash." ...|$|E
2500|$|GameSpot's Brad Shoemaker {{scored the}} game 9 out of 10, calling it [...] "one {{of the finest}} games {{released}} for the PlayStation 2 so far" [...] and [...] "an aesthetic masterpiece." [...] He praised the variety of the gameplay, writing [...] "there's {{so much to do}} that it's almost overwhelming," [...] and concluded that [...] "Dark Cloud 2 is simply a class act all the way. Every element of the game, from the georama system to the weapon upgrading to the interaction with a large cast of characters, displays a polish and attention to quality <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> only in real classics." ...|$|E

2500|$|Rowling {{also told}} the Dutch {{newspaper}} de Volkskrant that Voldemort was modeled on Hitler and Stalin, as a megalomaniac and paranoid figure, {{and that she}} was influenced by the Second World War, which is [...] "anchored in all our minds": discussing Draco Malfoy, she claimed [...] "Draco Malfoy does indeed stand for that type of boy. He wouldn’t have killed Dumbledore, he couldn’t. As long as things are imaginary, okay, but once it becomes reality, the thing becomes more difficult.", on the other hand, [...] "No, that I gave him that light blonde hair is not because I wanted to make him into a scary Nazi.

2500|$|After The Fifth of July, Reeve {{stretched}} his acting range further {{and played a}} homicidal novice playwright trying to kill his lover and mentor Michael Caine in Sidney Lumet's dark comedy film Deathtrap based on the play by Ira Levin. The film was well received. After Superman II, Reeve portrayed partially corrupt Catholic priest John Flaherty in Monsignor. Reeve felt this gave {{him the opportunity to}} play [...] "a morally ambiguous character who was neither clearly good nor clearly bad, someone to whom life is much more complex than the characters I've played previously". Reeve blamed the failure of the film on poor editing. He said [...] "the movie is sort of a series of outrageous incidents <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> hard to believe. Since they don't have a focus, and since they aren't justified and explained, they become laughable" ...|$|E
2500|$|The Dove Foundation {{praised the}} film, {{saying it is}} [...] "one of those movies <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> {{to be better than}} anticipated" [...] and also said the film draws on realism in family dynamics. Lara Martin of Digital Spy {{described}} the film as a [...] "kid-friendly mix of Men in Black crossed with Gremlins with a healthy dose of Home Alone-style violence" [...] and also mentioned that one of the biggest disappointments in the movie is the lack of screen time given to Tisdale, billed as one of the leading actors, who gets a promising start as she rebels against her parents and struts around in her bikini, but she's quickly relegated to background fodder purely there to provide excess opportunities for the alien-controlled Ricky to shine and concluded saying it seems [...] "a bizarre and sad waste of her obvious comedic talent". However, The Miami Herald gave a mixed to negative review, saying the film is a [...] "children's movie mix of live-action and animation, it has a few positive messages, a few laughs and a few comic throwdowns".|$|E

Lead single from the album, [...] "Keep It Natural", released on 2 June, showed a rockier edge to her previous works and was written by De Vito and Trevor Steel (singer-songwriter for The Escape Club); it became popular at gay nightclubs across Australia. On 22 February, she debuted [...] "Keep It Natural" [...] at the half time entertainment for the NBL's Sydney Kings v Brisbane Bullets game at the Sydney Entertainment Centre. The album did not chart on the Australian ARIA charts. In October the second single, [...] "Movin' On", also failed to chart despite positive reviews.

It peaked at No. 4 on the Australian Independent Charts also for 8 weeks. In May, De Vito performed the role of Mother Nature in the Perth production of the rock musical, Hair, to critical acclaim with Rob Mills, Cle Wotton and Nikki Webster. This production was directed by Chris Kabay with musically director, Simon Holt, of Yellow Glass Theatre. Jessica Clayden of the 3rd Degree website approved of the former Australian Idol contestants, [...] "De Vito and Wooten shine during their musical numbers and leave the audience wanting to hear more, so much so <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> yourself looking to the on stage balcony to wait for Cosima to appear and belt out another tune.
