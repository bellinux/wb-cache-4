25|$|Commercial {{versions}} {{were called}} Pro in Japan, and were available with either two or five seats (Pro T/F). The Pro {{had to make}} do without brake boost (until the 1985 facelift) and <b>transistorized</b> <b>ignition</b> (lowering power by two horsepower), and were also not available with the five speed manual transmission. The bare-bones Pro also had a manual choke.|$|E
25|$|Harley-Davidson {{has used}} various {{ignition}} systems throughout its history – {{be it the}} early points and condenser system, (Big Twin up to 1978 and Sportsters up to 1978), magneto ignition system used on some 1958 to 1969 Sportsters, early electronic with centrifugal mechanical advance weights, (all models 1978 {{and a half to}} 1979), or the late electronic with <b>transistorized</b> <b>ignition</b> control module, more familiarly known as the black box or the brain, (all models 1980 to present).|$|E
25|$|The first {{electronic}} ignition (a cold cathode type) was tested in 1948 by Delco-Remy, while Lucas introduced a <b>transistorized</b> <b>ignition</b> in 1955, {{which was used}} on BRM and Coventry Climax Formula One engines in 1962. The aftermarket began offering EI that year, with both the AutoLite Electric Transistor 201 and Tung-Sol EI-4 (thyratron capacitive discharge) being available. Pontiac became the first automaker to offer an optional EI, the breakerless magnetic pulse-triggered Delcotronic, on some 1963 models; it was also available on some Corvettes. The first commercially available all solid-state (SCR) capacitive discharge ignition was manufactured by Hyland Electronics in Canada also in 1963. Ford fitted a Lucas system on the Lotus 25s entered at Indianapolis the next year, ran a fleet test in 1964, and began offering optional EI on some models in 1965. Beginning in 1958, Earl W. Meyer at Chrysler worked on EI, continuing until 1961 and resulting in use of EI on the company's NASCAR hemis in 1963 and 1964.|$|E
5000|$|Originally the Babetta was {{conceived}} as lightweight moped {{to compete with}} the Solex moped which was popular during the 1960s. The first Babetta mopeds to {{see the light of day}} in 1970 featured very large 23-inch wheels, but these were soon swapped out in favour of smaller 16-inch wheels. The Babetta was notable for its electronic ignition [...] - [...] the first time a <b>transistorized</b> contactless <b>ignition</b> had been used in a moped.|$|R
2500|$|However, {{independent}} AMC dealerships began sponsoring cars in drag racing events. Preston Honea achieved fame {{with the}} 1964 [...] "Bill Kraft Rambler" [...] American from Norwalk, California. The car had a transplanted AMC V8 engine that was bored out to [...] with four carburetors on special intake manifold and featured a <b>transistorized</b> <b>ignition</b> {{system as well}} as an Isky 505-A camshaft. The big engine from an Ambassador added only [...] more than the venerable [...] straight-6 normally found in the small two-door American. However, with its 8200 rpm redline, the Rambler ran [...] at the Fontana dragstrip.|$|E
2500|$|The 427 was {{available}} with a 1282ft³/min (605 L/s) Holley triple two-barrel carburetor arrangement, which the factory called Tri-Power. The ultimate Corvette engine for 1967 was coded L88, even wilder than the L89, and {{was as close}} to a pure racing engine as Chevy had ever offered in regular production. Besides the lightweight heads and bigger ports, it came with an even hotter camshaft, stratospheric 12.5:1 compression, an aluminum radiator, small-diameter flywheel, and a single huge Holley four-barrel carburetor. Although the factory advertised L88 rating was 430bhp at 4600 rpm, the true rating was said to be about 560bhp at 6400 rpm. The very high compression ratio required 103-octane racing fuel, which {{was available}} only at select service stations. Clearly this was not an engine for the casual motorist. When the L88 was ordered, Chevy made several individual options mandatory, including Positraction, the <b>transistorized</b> <b>ignition,</b> heavy-duty suspension, and power brakes, as well as RPO C48, which deleted the normal radio and heater to cut down on weight and discourage the car's use on the street. As costly as it was powerful – at an additional $1,500 over the base $4,240.75 price – the L88 engine and required options were sold to a mere 20 buyers that year. [...] With potential buyers anticipating the car's overdue redesign, sales for the Sting Ray's final year totaled 22,940, down over 5,000 units from 1966 results. Meanwhile, Chevrolet readied its third-generation Corvette for the 1968 model year.|$|E
5000|$|... 07/1969: US {{models with}} {{headlight}} assembly with full amber lower section, illuminated side markers, <b>transistorized</b> <b>ignition,</b> and improved emission control.|$|E
50|$|The engine {{also had}} a dual-point {{distributor}} with a <b>transistorized</b> <b>ignition</b> amplifier system, running 12 amps of current through a high-output ignition coil.|$|E
50|$|The {{water-cooled}} 250cc {{engine features}} an aluminum cylinder {{head with a}} compression ratio of 10.5:1; fan-cooled radiator; 30mm carburetor; auto enriching system (i.e., no choke); electric start; fully <b>transistorized</b> <b>ignition</b> and air injection emissions system.|$|E
50|$|For 1974, 5-mph bumpers {{were added}} to the rear, a <b>transistorized</b> <b>ignition</b> system was introduced, as well as a new hood ornament. In addition, the 429 was dropped, largely {{replaced}} by the essentially identical 460 V8.|$|E
5000|$|The {{earliest}} electronics systems {{available as}} factory installations were vacuum tube car radios, {{starting in the}} early 1930's. The development of semiconductors after WWII greatly expanded the use of electronics in automobiles, with solid-state diodes making the automotive alternator the standard after about 1960, and the first <b>transistorized</b> <b>ignition</b> systems appearing about 1955.|$|E

5000|$|With minor {{modifications}} in 2004, the design remained largely unchanged until its relaunch as the NT700V in 2006. The third generation Deauville featured programmed fuel-injection system, digital <b>transistorized</b> <b>ignition</b> with electronic advance, power delivery via shaft drive, five-speed gearbox, cable-actuated clutch, center and side stands, standard riding posture, 58.1" [...] wheelbase, 31.7" [...] seat height, 5.2-gallon fuel tank, three-spoke 17" [...] alloy wheels, 562-lb curb weight, linked braking system with optional ABS, manually adjustable five-position integral windscreen and integral fairing, twin trip odometers, instant and average MPG readouts and twin dash-mounted storage compartments (one lockable).|$|E

The car had a transplanted AMC V8 engine that was bored out to 418 CID L with four carburetors on special intake manifold and featured a <b>transistorized</b> <b>ignition</b> {{system as well}} as an Isky 505-A camshaft. The big engine from an Ambassador added only 80 lb more than the venerable 195.6 CID L straight-6 normally found in the small two-door American. However, with its 8200 rpm redline, the Rambler ran 112 mph at the Fontana dragstrip.|$|E
50|$|In 1981 Honda {{released}} the GL500 Silver Wing, {{which was a}} mid-sized touring bike based on the CX500 engine. The GL500 engine {{was similar to the}} CX500 engine, but used the more reliable <b>transistorized</b> <b>ignition</b> system, which meant the stator would contain only charging windings and thus would put out more power for operating the lights and other devices commonly added to touring motorcycles. The GL500 also used Honda's Pro-Link monoshock rear suspension and was available as either a naked bike or as an Interstate model with fairing. The Interstate included a large factory fairing, hard saddlebags, and a trunk. This made the Silver Wing look like a miniature Gold Wing GL1100 Interstate. The 1981 model had a small tail trunk, which was replaced by a larger trunk in 1982. The trunk was interchangeable with the back seat—the bike is rider-only with the trunk installed, although there was an aftermarket extender available to allow the trunk to be mounted behind the passenger seat.|$|E
50|$|In mid-1963, Ford offered <b>transistorized</b> <b>{{ignition}}</b> {{on their}} new 427 FE V8. This system only passed a very low current through the ignition points, using a PNP transistor to perform high-voltage switching of the ignition current, allowing for a higher voltage ignition spark, as well as reducing variations in ignition timing due to arc-wear of the breaker points. Engines so equipped carried special stickers on their valve covers reading “427-T.” AC Delco’s Delcotron Transistor Control Magnetic Pulse Ignition System became optional {{on a number of}} General Motors vehicles beginning in 1964. The Delco system eliminated the mechanical points completely, using magnetic flux variation for current switching, virtually eliminating point wear concerns. In 1967, Ferrari and Fiat Dinos came equipped with Magneti Marelli Dinoplex electronic ignition, and all Porsche 911s had electronic ignition beginning with the B-Series 1969 models. In 1972, Chrysler introduced a magnetically-triggered pointless electronic ignition system as standard equipment on some production cars, and included it as standard across the board by 1973.|$|E

50|$|Changes {{were again}} modest: Five smaller front fender vents {{replaced}} the three larger ones, and flat-finish rockers sans ribbing conferred a lower, less chunky appearance. New {{was a single}} backup light, mounted above the license plate. The previous models' wheel covers gave way to slotted six-inch Rally wheels with chrome beauty rings and lug nuts concealed behind chrome caps. Interior alterations were modest and included revised upholstery, and the handbrake moved from beneath the dash to between the seats. The convertible's optional hardtop was offered with a black vinyl cover, which was a fad among all cars at the time.The 427 was available with a 1282 ft³/min (605 L/s) Holley triple two-barrel carburetor arrangement, which the factory called Tri-Power.
