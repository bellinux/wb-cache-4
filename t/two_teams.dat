5|$|The {{rivalry between}} the Avalanche and the Red Wings was most intense from 1996 to 2002. During those seven seasons the <b>two</b> <b>teams</b> played five postseason series {{against each other}} in the Stanley Cup playoffs, with the Avalanche winning three of the series (1995–96, 4–2; 1998–99, 4–2; 1999–2000, 4–1) and the Red Wings winning two of them (1996–97, 4–2; 2001–02, 4–3).

After 2002, the rivalry between the <b>two</b> <b>teams</b> began to cool down, and the <b>two</b> <b>teams</b> would not meet again in the playoffs until 2008, when the Red Wings swept the Avalanche in the Western Conference Semi-finals and {{went on to win the}} Stanley Cup. The Red Wings moved to the Eastern Conference in 2013–14 season as part of the realignment which makes the two rivals only see each other twice a year.|$|E

5|$|After Duquesne lost to Saint Bonaventure, the Bonnies {{also lost}} their final regular season game to Xavier, which left the <b>two</b> <b>teams</b> {{in a tie}} for the eighth seed and the home tournament game that went with it. The <b>two</b> <b>teams</b> had played each other twice during the season, with each team taking one victory, so the second tiebreaker came down to who had scored the best victory. Duquesne's best win came against Charlotte, while Saint Bonaventure's was against Rhode Island. Unfortunately, those <b>two</b> <b>teams</b> were also in a tie. So for Duquesne to get their home game, Charlotte had to win their final home game, and Rhode Island had to lose. Both teams lost, so the tie {{remained}} and Rhode Island won out due to their head-to-head records. Thus Duquesne would head {{back out on the}} road against the Bonnies.|$|E
