5|$|As for the BIA's assurance, <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> {{that only}} {{meant that the}} {{termination}} act did not terminate the claim, not that {{the statute of limitations}} would not begin to run. Because <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> of Appeals had only held that the statute of limitation did not apply, not that it would not bar the claim if it applied, and the District Court had held the claim barred, <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> remanded to <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> of Appeals to pass on that conclusion of the District Court.|$|E
5|$|As was {{standard}} practice, Colvill {{was subsequently}} tried by court martial aboard Africaine on 31 December {{for the loss}} of his ship. <b>The</b> <b>court</b> acquitted him, his officers and his men of all blame. <b>The</b> <b>court</b> found the cause of the accident to be the thick fog and the ignorance of the pilots. <b>The</b> <b>court</b> required the pilots to forfeit their pay, barred them from piloting any of His Majesty's ships, and imprisoned them for a time in the Marshalsea.|$|E

5|$|Central to the {{reversal}} of the Ninth Circuit {{was the fact that}} the state court did not take into account Alvarado's age and experience with law enforcement in the custody analysis. <b>The</b> <b>Court</b> made several findings on this issue. <b>The</b> <b>Court</b> held that the use of age in custody analysis had not been explicitly required by previous rulings. Inexperience with law enforcement was rejected as well; <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> noted that previous opinions had rejected reliance on such factors.|$|E
5|$|Debs appealed his {{conviction}} to the Supreme Court. In its ruling on Debs v.

While Debs had carefully worded his speeches {{in an attempt}} to comply with the Espionage Act, <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> found he had the intention and effect of obstructing the draft and military recruitment. Among other things, <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> cited Debs' praise for those imprisoned for obstructing the draft.

5|$|Finally, Burton {{argued that}} the Eastern District of Missouri was an unconstitutional venue and vicinage (an {{argument}} that <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> had accepted in Burton I). This time, <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> rejected the argument. <b>The</b> <b>Court</b> held that the agreement had occurred in St. Louis (as the jury had been instructed that it was required to find) based on Rialto's acceptance in St. Louis, the telegram, and the letter. <b>The</b> <b>Court</b> bolstered this view by citation to its own and other precedents concerning offer and acceptance in contract law. <b>The</b> <b>Court</b> further cited its earlier precedents holding that the venue provision of Article III {{does not require the}} physical presence of the defendant in the forum state.|$|E
5|$|From {{an early}} period, <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> was also {{assisted}} by two Registrars, who enrolled decrees of <b>the</b> <b>court</b> and orders; their books documented the legal precedent set by <b>the</b> <b>court.</b> At the same time, two Examiners were appointed {{to assist the}} Master of the Rolls in examining witnesses. The positions were regularly and openly sold by the Master of the Rolls and Lord Chancellor– Masters in Chancery went for £6,000 in 1625. To avoid the sale of offices, and due to the corruption of many court officials, an Act was passed that year requiring that fees be paid directly into the Bank of England, and creating an Accountant-General to oversee the financial aspects of <b>the</b> <b>court.</b> In 1813 the first Vice-Chancellor was appointed {{to deal with the}} increasing number of cases submitted to <b>the</b> <b>Court.</b> With the backlog growing larger, two more were appointed in 1841 under a second Act of Parliament, although this provided for two life appointments, not two new positions; when the new Vice-Chancellors died, there could be no replacements. With the dissolution of <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> in 1873, the position of Vice-Chancellor ceased to exist.|$|E
5|$|In 1936, the United States Supreme Court {{ruled the}} Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933 unconstitutional. For the first time, Minton gave speeches criticizing <b>the</b> <b>court</b> for {{overriding}} {{the will of}} Congress.

In response to <b>the</b> <b>court</b> ruling, Minton began drafting a bill which would allow the Supreme Court to declare a law unconstitutional only if seven out the nine justices supported the decision. In February 1937, before Minton introduced his bill, President Roosevelt introduced a plan of his own to deal with the Supreme Court. Roosevelt proposed adding more justices to <b>the</b> <b>court</b> and creating a mandatory retirement age; the changes would allow him to appoint an overwhelming majority to <b>the</b> <b>court,</b> more sympathetic to his agenda, ensuring the safety of legislation passed by his party.|$|E

Third, <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> held thatsince slave trading was a misdemeanorthere was no distinction between principal and accessory. Fourth, <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> held that, for the statute to be violated, the fitting out must have occurred within the United States.
