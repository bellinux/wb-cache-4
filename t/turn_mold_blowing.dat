5000|$|<b>Blow</b> <b>molding</b> ( [...] BrE {{moulding}} [...] ) is {{a manufacturing}} {{process by which}} hollow plastic parts are formed: It is also used for forming glass bottles. In general, there are three main types of blow molding: extrusion <b>blow</b> <b>molding,</b> injection <b>blow</b> <b>molding,</b> and injection stretch <b>blow</b> <b>molding.</b> The <b>blow</b> <b>molding</b> process begins with melting down the plastic and forming it into a [...] {{or in the case}} of injection and injection stretch blow moulding (ISB) a preform. The parison is a tube-like piece of plastic with a hole in one end through which compressed air can pass.|$|R

50|$|The {{economics}} of plastics processing {{is determined by}} the type of process. Plastics can be processed with the following methods: machining, compression molding, transfer molding, injection molding, extrusion, rotational <b>molding,</b> <b>blow</b> <b>molding,</b> thermoforming, casting, forging, and foam molding. Processing methods are selected based on equipment cost, production rate, tooling cost, and build volume. High equipment and tooling cost methods are typically used for large production volumes whereas low - medium equipment cost and tooling cost methods are used for low production volumes. Compression molding, transfer molding, injection molding, forging, and foam molding has high equipment and tooling cost. Lower cost processes are machining, extruding, rotational <b>molding,</b> <b>blow</b> <b>molding,</b> thermoforming, and casting. A summary of each process and its cost is displayed figure 1.|$|R

Thin-gauge thermoforming is primarily the manufacture of disposable cups, containers, lids, trays, blisters, clamshells, and other products for the food, medical, and general retail industries. Thick-gauge thermoforming includes parts as diverse as vehicle door and dash panels, refrigerator liners, utility vehicle beds, and plastic pallets.|$|R

The glass transition temperature of these polymers can exceed 200Â°C. COC resins are commonly supplied in pellet form and are suited to standard polymer processing techniques such as single and twin screw extrusion, injection <b>molding,</b> injection <b>blow</b> <b>molding</b> and stretch <b>blow</b> <b>molding</b> (ISBM), compression molding, extrusion coating, biaxial orientation, thermoforming and many others.

40|$|International audienceThanks to {{the single}} stage {{injection}} <b>blow</b> <b>molding</b> process, specific hollow parts can be produced with standard injection molding machine. A specific mold is designed, enabling the preform injection molding, {{as well as its}} <b>blow</b> <b>molding</b> on the same machine. The preform is <b>blow</b> <b>molded</b> right after its injection molding. This particular process does not involve preform storage and reheating before the <b>blow</b> <b>molding</b> stage. This implies that the preform has to remain sufficiently malleable to be blown while being viscous enough to avoid being pierced during the <b>blow</b> <b>molding</b> stage. The polymer used is a polypropylene random copolymer. Therefore the process takes place between the melting temperature and the crystallization one. As the preform is <b>blow</b> <b>molded</b> right after being injected, this single stage process involves high temperature before the blowing. The polymer rheological behavior is investigated through dynamic rheometry in its molten state at various temperatures. A viscous Cross model is used with the thermal dependence assumed by an Arrhenius law. The process is simulated through a finite element code (Polyflow) in the ANSYS Workbench framework. The geometry allows an axisymmetric approach. The transient simulation is run under anisothermal conditions and viscous heating is taken into account. Two geometries are simulated. First, the flask geometry has been used to show the process efficiency. The yoghurt pot geometry has been designed later for industrial application in a more sophisticated mold than the flask <b>mold.</b> <b>Blow</b> <b>molded</b> parts are analyzed by tomography and the thickness has been measured by the tomography data image analysis. The simulation results are compared to the experimental ones. The simulation fits well with the experimental results concerning both geometries. The simple numerical model proposed proves to be robust enough to predict well the <b>blow</b> <b>molded</b> parts final thickness repartitions provided that the relevant temperature and pressure conditions are well defined...|$|R

50|$|POM is {{supplied}} in a granulated form {{and can be}} formed into the desired shape by applying heat and pressure. The two most common forming methods employed are injection molding and extrusion. Rotational <b>molding</b> and <b>blow</b> <b>molding</b> are also possible.|$|R
50|$|After {{a cooling}} period the <b>blow</b> <b>mold</b> opens and the core rod is rotated to the {{ejection}} position. The finished article is stripped off the core rod {{and as an}} option can be leak-tested prior to packing. The preform and <b>blow</b> <b>mold</b> can have many cavities, typically three to sixteen depending on the article size and the required output. There are three sets of core rods, which allow concurrent preform injection, <b>blow</b> <b>molding</b> and ejection.|$|R
50|$|In {{some cases}} {{rotational}} molding {{can be used}} as a feasible alternative to <b>blow</b> <b>molding,</b> this is due to the similarity in product outputs, with products such as plastic bottles and cylindrical containers, this is only effective on a smaller scale as it much more costly to <b>blow</b> <b>mold</b> regarding a small output, and with fewer resulting products rotational molding is much cheaper, due to <b>blow</b> <b>molding</b> relying on economies of scale regarding efficiency.|$|R
