40|$|Abstract. <b>The</b> <b>camera</b> {{calibration}} is {{an essential}} part in <b>the</b> machine vision,the <b>camera</b> calibration is to establish the relationship between <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> image pixellocation and scene position,the approach is based on <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> model,solving <b>the</b> model parameters of <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> image coordinates and world coordinates from the known feature points. Using <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> calibration method based on quadratic curve,this article selects a template consists of two concentric circles and two concentric ovals. We shot 4 images in different directions,and use different combinations of three of the four images to calibrate camera. Thus we can calculatethe various parameters of <b>the</b> <b>camera.</b> Istruction In three-dimensional vision system, three-dimensional object’s location,shape and other geometric information is obtained from the image information obtained by <b>the</b> <b>camera.</b> In order to obtain the space point to the corresponding relations of <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> image pixel. <b>The</b> <b>camera</b> calibration is essential. <b>The</b> <b>camera</b> calibration is to establish the relationship between thecamera image pixellocation and scene position. The approach is based on <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> model, solving <b>the</b> model parameters of <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> image coordinates and world coordinates from the known feature points. Using <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> calibration method based on quadratic curve, use of the corresponding of image and the target plane quadratic curve to calibrate <b>the</b> <b>camera.</b> For <b>the</b> quadratic curve is a more concise, more global, and thus it can further improve the stability of <b>the</b> method. <b>Camera</b> Mode...|$|R
25|$|Handheld 3-axis gimbals {{are used}} in {{stabilization}} systems designed to give <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> operator <b>the</b> independence of handheld shooting without camera vibration or shake. Powered by three brushless motors, the gimbals {{have the ability to}} keep <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> level on all axes as <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> operator moves <b>the</b> <b>camera.</b> An inertial measurement unit (IMU) responds to movement and utilizes its three separate motors to stabilize <b>the</b> <b>camera.</b>|$|R
30|$|After {{determining}} world coordinates, <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> is {{registered to}} obtain <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> matrix, namely focal length of camera, optical center, and radial distortion parameters of image.

5|$|In March 2011, hidden-camera {{video was}} {{published}} showing adults and juveniles, indicating recent matings and breeding. During {{the period from}} January to October 2011, <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> had captured images of 35 rhinos.

5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s Elsie and Frances {{admitted}} that the photographs were faked, using cardboard cutouts of fairies copied from a popular children's book of the time, but Frances maintained that the fifth and final photograph was genuine. The photographs and two of <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> used are {{on display in the}} National Science and Media Museum in Bradford, England.|$|E
5|$|Nick Hardwick, {{chair of}} the IPCC, said on 9 April {{that there were no}} CCTV cameras in the area. On 14 April the Evening Standard wrote that it had found at least six CCTV cameras in the area around the assault. After {{photographs}} of <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> were published, the IPCC reversed its position and said its investigators were looking at footage from cameras in Threadneedle Street near the corner of Royal Exchange Passage.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>camera</b> weighs 5.5 oz {{and has a}} {{rechargeable}} battery life of 220 shots. When projecting continuously, <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> has a battery life of approximately one hour. A projector stand and remote are included with the purchase of <b>the</b> <b>camera,</b> which allow <b>the</b> use of <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> wirelessly.|$|R
50|$|When the {{armature}} is correctly adjusted, operators can remove their hands from the Steadicam entirely and <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> stays in place. During operation, the operator usually rests {{a hand on}} <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> gimbal and applies force at that point to move <b>the</b> <b>camera.</b> To avoid shaking <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> when lens adjustments are made, a wireless remote operated by <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> assistant is used to control focus and iris.|$|R
50|$|Some shots require <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> to move. This {{can be done}} several ways, one {{of which}} is to use a camera crane. There are many types of camera cranes, most being a counterbalanced arm on a pivot, whilst others are hydraulic. Cranes can be used to lift <b>the</b> <b>camera,</b> and often <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> {{operator}} and assistant also, quickly into the air. The crane operator sets up and operates <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> crane so that <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> arrives at <b>the</b> right spot. This can be difficult since <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> may be a long distance from the operator.|$|R
5|$|The Beatles {{made their}} last {{official}} live appearance in Britain on 1 May 1966, at the NME Annual Poll-Winners' All-Star Concert at the Empire Pool, Wembley Park. Although the concert was televised, <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> were switched off while the Beatles played, because Brian Epstein and ABC TV {{had failed to}} agree over terms. They were filmed receiving their awards, however.|$|E
5|$|The P variant {{had similar}} {{features}} to the Do 17M-1, with added blind flying and camera equipment for reconnaissance work. The Do 17P-1 was powered by two BMW 132N radial engines {{with a maximum}} performance of 865PS (853hp, 636kW) each. The machine was fitted with several radio variations. The FuG IIIaU radio (Funkgerät), the PeilG V direction finder (PeilG - Peilgerät) and the FuBI 1 radio blind-landing device (FuBI - Funkblindlandegerät). The crew of three communicated with each other via the EiV intercom (EiV -Eigenverständigungsanlage). The P-1 was equipped with either Rb 20/30 and Rb 50/30 or Rb 20/18 and Rb 50/18 cameras. The P-1/trop was fitted with filters and protection for <b>the</b> <b>cameras.</b> <b>The</b> <b>cameras</b> were controlled remotely by the crew from the cockpit.|$|E
5|$|The {{challenge}} for NASA's imaging team was that, as the mission progressed, the objects being photographed were getting {{farther away from}} the spacecraft, therefore appearing fainter and requiring longer exposures and even slewing (panning) of <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> to achieve good quality. The telecommunication capability also decreased with distance, limiting the number of data modes that could be used by the imaging system.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Orbiter <b>camera</b> seat is a {{seat for}} a {{cameraman}} that swivels {{at a low}} working height. The orbiter {{is characterized by a}} partial separation of <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> and <b>the</b> movable/swivelling seat. This ensures that the natural vibrations of <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> operator are absorbed in the seat and are, therefore, transferred to <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> to a very small extent. This is especially important with telephoto lens with up to x101 zoom, where vibration resistance is vital for stable pictures. The swiveling seat is not mounted on <b>the</b> centre <b>camera</b> column (which would increase vibration), but it rotates with <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> as <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> pans. <b>The</b> name ‘Orbiter’ was chosen because the cameraman is in orbit around <b>the</b> <b>camera,</b> and because orbital means ‘concerning an eyeball’, and <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> is an electronic eye.|$|R

5|$|The {{episode was}} filmed over three {{days at the}} end of October and {{beginning}} of November 2002. It was supposed to take only two days, but the filming of the wedding scenes was postponed after Messing got sick on the first day. On November 3, 2002, the rooftop terrace scene was filmed at the New York Palace Hotel. In November 2002, the scene in Central Park was shot in New York. The wedding ceremony was filmed, in part, at Temple Israel of Hollywood. As the actors performed their lines in front of a studio audience, the writing staff stood behind <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> taking notes in the script and watching the audience's reaction to jokes. The writers often stopped <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> and added new inflections to the dialog. According to the Knoxville News Sentinels Terry Morrow, the cast handled the changes quickly, and scenes were routinely redone up to three times even if the actors executed their lines properly.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{the other}} onboard instruments, the {{operation}} of <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> for visible light is not autonomous, but rather it is controlled by an imaging parameter table contained {{in one of the}} on-board digital computers, the Flight Data Subsystem (FDS). Since the 1990s, space probes usually have completely autonomous cameras.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in fall 2007 {{there will}} be more than 30 traffic cameras {{operating}} on Omaha area freeways, including one at I-80 near Gretna and another on West Dodge near 120th Street. Operated by the Nebraska Department of Roads, the sensors and cameras are not used to catch speeders or for other traffic enforcement. The state also operates an extensive traffic operations center that utilizes <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> to monitor Omaha traffic patterns. Similar to traffic monitoring centers in Lincoln and North Platte, the one in Omaha is the biggest and has the greatest capability to provide traffic information.|$|E
30|$|In the {{discussion}} so far, the light source is {{placed at the}} opposite of <b>the</b> <b>camera.</b> However, {{a number of the}} unobserved paths changes corresponding to the angle between the light source and <b>the</b> <b>camera.</b> Assume <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> is fixed; now, we derive an optimal placement of the light source relative to <b>the</b> <b>camera.</b>|$|R
30|$|Motion of <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> towards or {{away from}} the {{refractive}} interfaces results in a movement of the focal plane of <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> that is magnified by {{the ratio of the}} refractive indices of the media surrounding the object and <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> regardless of <b>the</b> number or type of media between the object and <b>the</b> <b>camera.</b>|$|R
50|$|For small {{hand-held}} cameras, {{a harness}} or contoured frame steadies <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> against <b>the</b> photographer's body. In some models, <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> mount {{is on an}} arm that protrudes {{in front of the}} photographer; beneath <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> is a handle grip. Another variation positions <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> atop a fulcrum braced against the photographer's chest or abdomen.|$|R
5|$|Curtis {{admitted}} in a 2004 documentary that just before recording began, producer John Lloyd {{came up to}} him with Atkinson and asked what Edmund's character was. Curtis then realised that, despite writing some funny lines, {{he had no idea how}} Rowan Atkinson was supposed to play his part. On the 25th anniversary documentary Blackadder Rides Again, Atkinson added that as <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> were about to roll for the first time, he suddenly realised he wasn't even sure what voice to use for the character.|$|E
5|$|For visual localization, {{the robot}} {{estimates}} its position {{relative to the}} aircraft using visual elements (doors, windows, tires, static ports etc.) of the aircraft. During {{the evolution of the}} robot, these visual elements are extracted from a three-dimensional virtual model of the aircraft and projected in the image plane of <b>the</b> <b>cameras.</b> The projected shapes are used for pattern recognition to detect those visual elements. The other detection method used is based on the extraction of features with a Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF) approach. A pairing is performed between images of each element to be detected and the actual scene experienced.|$|E
5|$|Frances died in 1986, and Elsie in 1988. Prints {{of their}} {{photographs}} of the fairies, {{along with a few}} other items including a first edition of Doyle's book The Coming of the Fairies, were sold at auction in London for £21,620 in 1998. That same year, Geoffrey Crawley sold his Cottingley Fairy material to the National Museum of Film, Photography and Television in Bradford (now the National Science and Media Museum), where it is on display. The collection included prints of the photographs, two of <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> used by the girls, watercolours of fairies painted by Elsie, and a nine-page letter from Elsie admitting to the hoax.|$|E

5|$|In February–March 2007 New Horizons {{spacecraft}} {{conducted a}} deep {{search for new}} small moons inside the main ring. While no satellites larger than 0.5km were found, <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> of the spacecraft detected seven small clumps of ring particles. They orbit just inside the orbit of Adrastea inside a dense ringlet. The conclusion, that they are clumps and not small moons, is based on their azimuthally extended appearance. They subtend 0.1–0.3° along the ring, which correspond to 1000–3000km. The clumps are {{divided into two groups}} of five and two members, respectively. The nature of the clumps is not clear, but their orbits are close to 115:116 and 114:115 resonances with Metis. They may be wavelike structures excited by this interaction.|$|E
5|$|In both {{navigation}} modes, Air-Cobot is {{also able}} to detect, track, identify and avoid obstacles that are in its way. The laser data from laser range sensors and visual data from <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> {{can be used for}} detection, monitoring and identification of the obstacles. The detection and monitoring are better in the two-dimensional laser data, while identification is easier in the images from the cameras; the two methods are complementary. Information from laser data can be used to delimit work areas in the image.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1960s, Gottschalk altered Panavision's {{business}} model. The {{company now}} maintained its full inventory, making its lenses and <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> it had acquired from MGM available only by rental. This meant that equipment could be maintained, modified, and regularly updated by the company. When Panavision eventually brought its own camera designs to market, it was relatively unconstrained by retrofitting and manufacturing costs, {{as it was}} not directly competing on sales price. This allowed Panavision to build cameras to new standards of durability.|$|E

5000|$|Karl Freund is the {{inventor}} of <b>the</b> unchained <b>camera.</b> With its first appearance in Der letzte Mann, <b>the</b> unchained <b>camera</b> was a revolution in early film. For the first time, <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> was free of the tripod and could move around the set. Because {{it was no longer}} confined to one position, thousands of new shots were possible. Freund was known to wear <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> on his stomach and walk around while it was filming. He would also put <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> on a cart that moves along a track. Several other innovative ways of moving <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> were introduced by Freund, including putting <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> on a crane.|$|R
50|$|Kinetic {{photography}} (kinetic meaning “caused by motion”) is {{an experimental}} photographic technique {{in which the}} photographer uses movement resulting from physics to create an image. This typically involves the artist not directly holding <b>the</b> <b>camera,</b> but allowing <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> to react to forces applied to {{it in order to}} make a photograph. This can include, but is not limited to; holding and shaking the wrist strap of <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> while taking a picture, dropping <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> off of objects while taking a picture, throwing or spinning <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> up in <b>the</b> air while taking a picture (called a camera toss), or rigorously moving <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> while taking a picture, etc. As the photographer has surrendered control over <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> to physical forces, this technique tends to produce abstract, random or blurred-motion photographs.|$|R
