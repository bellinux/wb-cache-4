It took some convincing... He thought the whole thing was a hoax". He was awarded the prize on December 10. In his Nobel Lecture the following day, he speculated on his award: [...] "When the Nobel Peace Prize Committee designated me the recipient of the 1970 award for my contribution to the 'green revolution', they were in effect, I believe, selecting an individual to symbolize the vital role of agriculture and food production {{in a world that is}} hungry, both for bread and for peace". His speech repeatedly presented improvements in food production within a sober understanding of the context of population. [...] "The green revolution has won a temporary success in man's war against hunger and deprivation; it has given man a breathing space. If fully implemented, the revolution can provide sufficient food for sustenance during the next three decades. But the frightening power of human reproduction must also be curbed; otherwise the success of the green revolution will be ephemeral only.|$|E

40|$|Airborne {{photogrammetry}} is {{a fundamental}} technique for producing reliable, geometrically accurate, high-resolution geospatial information. Passive and active digital imaging is rapidly replacing film imaging in photogrammetric data capture. Optimal use of this new technology enables fast data capture, high accuracy, {{a high level of}} automation, and a huge increase in applications. The reliability, accuracy, and efficiency of airborne photogrammetry are based on calibrated, high-quality sensors and rigorous processing. The calibration processes of the digital photogrammetric airborne imaging systems are under development. Central challenges {{in the development of the}} calibration are the extensive variation in digital systems, the need for radiometric calibration, and the necessity for accurate system calibration. Test field calibration is a potential approach for determining the system calibration. The hypothesis of this study was that system calibration in a <b>test</b> <b>field</b> is necessary for digital photogrammetric airborne imaging systems and that the calibration should involve geometry, spatial resolution, and radiometry. The hypothesis was proven by developing a methodology for the system calibration in a <b>test</b> <b>field</b> and by empirically investigating the need for and feasibility of the system calibration. In the empirical study, data sets from three first-generation commercial digital photogrammetric large-format sensors, Leica Geosystems ADS 40, Intergraph DMC, and Microsoft UltraCamD, were used. Theoretical evaluations were performed together with the empirical evaluations. The Finnish Geodetic Institute's permanent <b>test</b> <b>field</b> in Sjökulla, augmented with some portable targets, is a prototype photogrammetric <b>test</b> <b>field.</b> The results proved that the construction of a <b>test</b> <b>field</b> for geometric, spatial resolution, and radiometric calibration was feasible. A permanent <b>test</b> <b>field</b> can be an efficient, highly automated, and reliable tool for system calibration. The empirical evaluation showed the great geometric and radiometric potential of the systems, but it also revealed problems. The laboratory calibration of the evaluated systems was either insufficient or invalid in airborne conditions. The <b>test</b> <b>field</b> calibration was necessary to provide the missing or invalid parameters and to assess the measurement capability of the systems. The results also showed that calibration of the systems in a <b>test</b> <b>field</b> was feasible. It appeared that in order to obtain the utmost accuracy, the calibration process of the evaluated systems should include the laboratory, <b>test</b> <b>field,</b> and self-calibration. A product level validation of geometric accuracy also appeared to be necessary to ensure the highest reliability. This was the first study to model and demonstrate the simultaneous geometric, spatial resolution, and radiometric <b>test</b> <b>field</b> calibration for digital photogrammetric airborne imaging systems. The study had several results: it proved the need for and feasibility of <b>test</b> <b>field</b> calibration and presented new empirical results concerning system performance and <b>test</b> <b>field</b> calibration; it provided recommendations for the calibration process of the systems and for the construction of photogrammetric test fields; and it identified many additional research topics...|$|R
