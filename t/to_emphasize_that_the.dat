Makedonsko Devojče 2 is a successor to the album released in 2008 and it contains songs composed in the vein of Macedonian folklore. The plans to record the album were revealed by Gočeva during an interview in May 2012 with the magazine Naš Svet, confirming that she had already begun with the song selection process for the track listing of the second edition of the project Makedonsko Devojče.

25|$|In 1581, Guru Arjan {{initiated}} {{the construction of}} the Gurdwara. During the construction the pool was kept empty and dry. It took 8 years to complete the first version of the Harmandir Sahib. Guru Arjan planned a temple at a level lower than the city to emphasize humility and the need to efface one's ego before entering the premises to meet the Guru. He also demanded that the temple compound be open on all sides to emphasize that it was open to all. The sanctum inside the pool where his Guru seat was had only one bridge <b>to</b> <b>emphasize</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> end goal was one, states Arvind-Pal Singh Mandair. In 1589, the temple made with bricks was complete. Guru Arjan invited Sufi saint Mian Mir of Lahore to lay its foundation stone, signaling pluralism and that the Sikh tradition welcomed all. After the inauguration, the pool was filled with water. On August 16, 1604, Guru Arjan completed expanding and compiling the first version of the Sikh scripture and placed a copy of the Adi Granth in the temple. He appointed Baba Buddha as the first Granthi.|$|E

Stroustrup observed that the reference-dropping semantics offered by the typeof operator provided by the GCC and EDG compilers could be problematic. Conversely, an operator returning a reference type based on the lvalue-ness of the expression was deemed too confusing. The initial proposal to the C++ standards committee outlined {{a combination of the}} two variants; the operator would return a reference type only if the declared type of the expression included a reference. <b>To</b> <b>emphasize</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> deduced type would reflect the [...] "declared type" [...] of the expression, the operator was proposed to be named decltype.|$|E

500|$|Piller {{originally}} envisioned only casting actors {{between the}} ages of eighteen and twenty-five to simulate the connection between the Kazon and contemporary street gangs. He said that he wanted the casting choices to convey the alien species as [...] "young, angry people who never lived old enough {{to have the kind of}} experience and perspective on the world that, say, the Klingons and Romulans might have". He wanted <b>to</b> <b>emphasize</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Kazon were [...] "much more emotional, short fused, and therefore had fewer expectations" [...] through the actors' performances. The roles, however, were filled by actors outside this age range, with Piller explaining that the decision was reached on the grounds that the [...] "older actors gave more polished performances". He later regretted the choice of more mature actors, as he felt this conflicted with the writers' concept of the species, making them appear too much like Klingons. The Kazon also received comparisons to the Cardassians and Wood Elves by Uproxx's Donna Dickens.|$|E
500|$|Justice Samuel Alito wrote a {{separate}} concurring opinion, {{in which he}} was joined by Justice Anthony Kennedy and Justice Sonia Sotomayor. He agreed that content-based regulations present the same dangers as viewpoint-based regulations because content-based regulations [...] "may interfere with democratic self-government and the search for truth". He also agreed that the town's ordinance was [...] "replete with content-based distinctions" [...] that were subject to strict scrutiny. However, Justice Alito wrote separately <b>to</b> <b>emphasize</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Court's opinion would not [...] "prevent cities from regulating signs in a way that fully protects public safety and serves legitimate esthetic objectives". To support his argument, Justice Alito provided a list of examples of content-neutral sign regulations, including: regulations that target the size of signs, regulations that target the locations at which signs may be placed, regulations distinguishing between lighted and unlighted signs, regulations that distinguish between the placement of signs on public and private property, rules that restrict the total number of signs [...] "per mile of roadway", and rules that distinguish between freestanding signs and signs that are attached to buildings.|$|E
500|$|Peyton {{explained}} the writing by saying [...] "it always {{comes out of}} an emotional place." [...] One of the writers was Karen Walton, who had previously written the Canadian werewolf film Ginger Snaps. [...] The producers chose the type of animation due to Peyton's personal interest in it, although he later claimed that a day's work could lead to seconds' worth of material. [...] A factory was needed with 8 to 10 teams, {{with some of the}} animators having previously worked on the Tim Burton film Corpse Bride. [...] The characters were made out of plastic and foam. [...] Additionally, some animation was done through computers. [...] Each character's figure had a number of add-on lips to express various sounds, and their eyes and eyebrows were also adjusted frequently during production. [...] The figures could also be fastened into a surface, moved and fastened in again to portray movement. [...] Peyton remarked that [...] "The hardest thing is timing and pacing." [...] Still, he also liked <b>to</b> <b>emphasize</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> series did not cost too much money to produce.|$|E

500|$|The show's sound {{production}} team had two major special effects to create for the episode: the mole creature, and Olivia's superhearing. They decided to voice the creature using Automated Dialogue Replacement (ADR) [...] "because his range of actions and emotions {{was simply too}} broad for a library monster vocal set to cover". Sound editor Bruce Tanis cut [...] "creepy moans and breaths" [...] when the creature was heard but not seen, and added [...] "a layer of vicious attack growls and wounded screams" [...] for when it died. Tanis commented that the actor voicing the creature placed pieces of orange in his mouth {{in order to have}} [...] "a slobbery, sputtering voice". For Olivia's scenes with superhearing, Tanis made ordinary, far off items like phones, typewriters, and cars [...] "sound a little beefier than normal and kept them a bit more up in the mix than they usually would be," [...] as these things were not in the same room as her. The sound editors wanted <b>to</b> <b>emphasize</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> various sounds she hears could be coming from anywhere, such as next door, or a block away, or could perhaps be all inside her head. Torv later noted in a BuddyTV interview that while shooting, she was unsure whether her newfound abilities were permanent or temporary, to which the writers replied that [...] "apparently it's just something that comes and goes". After expressing her confusion, they responded [...] "Oh that's good, Olivia's confused too".|$|E
