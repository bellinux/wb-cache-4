25|$|A {{nuclear reactor}} coolant — usually water but {{sometimes}} a gas or a liquid metal (like liquid sodium) or molten salt — is circulated past the reactor core {{to absorb the}} heat that it generates. The heat is carried away from the reactor and is then used to generate steam. Most reactor systems employ a cooling system that is physically separated from the water that will be boiled to produce pressurized steam for the turbines, like the pressurized water reactor. However, in some reactors the water for the steam turbines is boiled directly by the reactor core; for example <b>the</b> <b>boiling</b> <b>water</b> reactor.|$|E
25|$|Whole Peking Ducks can {{be ordered}} as takeaways. The ducks can be reheated at home with an oven, grill or boiling oil. When an oven is used, the duck is heated at a {{temperature}} of 150°C (300°F) for 20 minutes, and then at 160°C (325°F) for another 10 minutes. The grilling method involves filling the duck with boiling water before placing it on a griddle, 70cm (28in) above the cooking fire. <b>The</b> <b>boiling</b> <b>water</b> is replaced every 3–4 minutes until the duck's skin is piping hot. To reheat the Peking Duck with oil, the duck is sliced into thin pieces {{and placed in a}} strainer held over a wok of boiling oil. The duck is then rinsed several times with the oil.|$|E
500|$|A late Commentary on the Shulchan Arukh {{known as}} the Taz (Turei Zahav), on Yoreh De'ah 69:5:16, writes that the pieces of meat can be [...] "very thick" [...] when salting. The Yemenite Jewish practice, however, follows Rabbi Saadiah Gaon who {{required}} that the meat not be larger than half a [...] "rotal" [...] (i.e. ca. 216 grams) when salting. This allows {{the effects of the}} salt to penetrate. Some Orthodox Jewish communities require the additional stricture of submersing raw meat in boiling water prior to cooking it, a practice known as ḥaliṭah (...) , “blanching.” This was believed to constrict the blood lodged within the meat, to prevent its oozing out when it is eaten. The raw meat is left in the pot of boiling water {{for as long as it}} takes for the meat to whiten on its outer layer. If someone wanted to use the water for soup after making ḥaliṭah in the same pot, he simply scoops out the film, froth and scum that surface in <b>the</b> <b>boiling</b> <b>water.</b> Ḥaliṭah is not required when roasting meat over a fire, as the fire constricts the blood.|$|E

40|$|Background: Uric acid is a {{final product}} or a waste that is {{resulted}} from the metabolism of purines. A high level of uric acid (hyperuricemia) will cause several health problems, such as vascular inflammation, smooth muscle proliferation, and vascular lesion in kidneys. The syzygium polyanthum leaves contain bioactive substances that may affect the level of uric acid in blood. Objective: This study aimed to determine <b>the</b> influence of <b>boiled</b> <b>water</b> of syzygium polyanthum leaves to the changes of uric acid levels in the target area of Puskesmas Pandak 1 Bantul. Methods: This study employed pre- and post-test without control group design. The population consisted of all patients with hyperuricemia in the target area of Puskesmas Pandak 1 Bantul. Sample was selected with a concecutive sampling, gaining a total number of 24 respondents. Data were analyzed with the Wilcoxon test. <b>The</b> dose of <b>boiled</b> <b>water</b> of syzygium polyanthum leaves intake was 0. 36 g/ KgBW, once a day for 14 days. Result: This research showed that <b>the</b> <b>boiled</b> <b>water</b> of syzygium polyanthum leaves decreased hyperuricemia (uric acid levels), along with the significancy value of 0. 009 (p < 0. 05).
