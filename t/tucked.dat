5|$|Animals such as frogs are {{patterned}} so {{that when}} they are at rest with legs <b>tucked</b> in, their outline is powerfully disrupted with markings that seem to flow across body and leg boundaries. Eyes too are often hidden in stripes.|$|E
5|$|The Garter is worn on {{ceremonial}} occasions {{around the}} left calf by knights {{and around the}} left arm by ladies, and is depicted on several insignia. The Garter is a buckled dark-blue (originally light-blue) velvet strap, and bears the motto in gold letters. The garters of Stranger Knights and Ladies were once set with several jewels. Two styles have been used: one is a working garter where the end slips through the buckle and then is <b>tucked</b> in a specific way and the other style is a 'pre-made' one that has the buckled and <b>tucked</b> end pre-fashioned and is fastened with a clip attachment.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Tuck</b> {{was first}} and {{foremost}} a campaign operative, and claimed he was never malicious in his political pranks. Richard Nixon was obsessive towards <b>Tuck,</b> however, as recorded in his presidential tapes. But Nixon also admired <b>Tuck,</b> comparing the dirty tricks committed by his staffer Donald Segretti unfavorably to the intelligence and wit behind some of <b>Tuck's</b> political pranks. After the Watergate scandal became public, H.R. Haldeman, White House Chief of Staff under Nixon, saw <b>Tuck</b> in the Capitol. Haldeman reportedly turned to <b>Tuck</b> and said, [...] "You started all of this." [...] <b>Tuck</b> replied, [...] "Yeah, Bob but you guys ran it into the ground." ...|$|R
5|$|About {{seven minutes}} after {{stepping}} onto the Moon's surface, Armstrong collected a contingency soil sample using a sample bag on a stick. He then folded {{the bag and}} <b>tucked</b> it into a pocket on his right thigh. This was to guarantee {{there would be some}} lunar soil brought back in case an emergency required the astronauts to abandon the EVA and return to the LM.|$|E
5|$|Crewkerne also {{contains}} one of very few Unitarian chapels {{left in the}} West Country, Crewkerne Unitarian Church, a tiny chapel <b>tucked</b> away on Hermitage Street. The Methodist church on South Street is shared by Roman Catholic and Methodist congregations, following the closure and proposed redevelopment of St Peter's Catholic Church.|$|E
5|$|House sparrows {{sleep with}} the bill <b>tucked</b> {{underneath}} the scapular feathers. Outside of the reproductive season, they often roost communally in trees or shrubs. Much communal chirping occurs {{before and after the}} birds settle in the roost in the evening, as well as before the birds leave the roost in the morning. Some congregating sites separate from the roost may be visited by the birds prior to settling in for the night.|$|E

5|$|Outside the {{breeding}} season, mourning doves roost communally in dense deciduous trees or in conifers. During sleep, the head rests between the shoulders, {{close to the}} body; it is not <b>tucked</b> under the shoulder feathers {{as in many other}} species. During the winter in Canada, roosting flights to the roosts in the evening, and out of the roosts in the morning, are delayed on colder days.|$|E
5|$|The Air Force {{sustained}} limited damage as {{only three}} transport planes and four helicopters were confirmed lost. The Georgian air force ceased all sorties after 8 August. Instead all fighter and training aircraft, including the Su-25s, were <b>tucked</b> away. Russian bombers impaired the airstrips in Georgia. A Russian air attack on Marneuli Air Force Base destroyed three AN-2 aircraft. Russian airborne forces {{set fire to}} two Mi-24 helicopters and one Mi-14 on 11 August.|$|E
5|$|The croupade and {{ballotade}} are predecessors to the capriole. In the croupade, {{the horse}} jumps with both fore and hind legs remaining <b>tucked</b> under {{the body and}} he does not kick out. In the ballotade, the horse jumps and untucks his hind legs slightly, he does not kick out, but the soles of the hind feet are visible if viewed from the rear.|$|E

5|$|Conall Cernach {{had sworn}} that if Cú Chulainn died before {{him he would}} avenge him before sunset, and when he hears Cú Chulainn is dead he pursues Lugaid. As Lugaid has lost a hand, Conall fights him with one hand <b>tucked</b> into his belt, but he only beats him after his horse takes {{a bite out of}} Lugaid's side. He also kills Erc, and takes his head back to Tara, where Erc's sister Achall dies of grief for her brother.|$|E
5|$|Following such performances, the Jackson {{brothers}} {{would be}} <b>tucked</b> in bed by their oblivious mother and {{reminded of the}} virtues of being a good Jehovah's Witness. Katherine remained unaware of her sons' strip club activities for many years. Journalist J. Randy Taraborrelli reflected on Jackson's early life and noted that {{at such a young}} age, the singer may not have been psychologically equipped to fully understand any sexual stimulation he may have received from such voyeuristic events. The writer further commented that Jackson's views on sex must have been conflicted between those of his religiously strict mother and his more libertine and promiscuous father.|$|E
5|$|Fossils of the troodonts Mei and Sinornithoides {{demonstrate}} that some dinosaurs slept {{with their heads}} <b>tucked</b> under their arms. This behavior, which may have helped to keep the head warm, is also characteristic of modern birds. Several deinonychosaur and oviraptorosaur specimens have also been found preserved {{on top of their}} nests, likely brooding in a bird-like manner. The ratio between egg volume and body mass of adults among these dinosaurs suggest that the eggs were primarily brooded by the male, and that the young were highly precocial, similar to many modern ground-dwelling birds.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Tuck</b> Baronetcy, of Park Crescent in St Marylebone, is a {{title in}} the Baronetage of the United Kingdom. It was created on 19 July 1910 for Adolph <b>Tuck.</b> He was Chairman and Managing Director of Raphael <b>Tuck</b> & Sons Ltd., makers of Christmas cards, picture postcards, et cetera. The <b>Tuck</b> family is of German-Jewish origin. The first Baronet's father Raphael <b>Tuck</b> was born in Prussia and emigrated to the United Kingdom in 1865.|$|R

5|$|Freedom from Fear is {{the last}} of the {{well-known}} Four Freedoms oil paintings produced by the American artist Norman Rockwell. The series was based on the four goals known as the Four Freedoms, which were enunciated by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in his State of the Union Address on January 6, 1941. This work was published in the March 13, 1943, issue of The Saturday Evening Post alongside an essay by a prominent thinker of the day, Stephen Vincent Benét. The painting is generally described as depicting American children being <b>tucked</b> into bed by their parents while the Blitz rages across the Atlantic in Great Britain.|$|E
5|$|The Rokeby Venus {{depicts the}} Roman goddess of love, beauty and {{fertility}} reclining languidly on her bed, {{her back to}} the viewer—in Antiquity, portrayal of Venus from a back view was a common visual and literary erotic motif—and her knees <b>tucked.</b> She is shown without the mythological paraphernalia normally included in depictions of the scene; jewellery, roses, and myrtle are all absent. Unlike most earlier portrayals of the goddess, which show her with blond hair, Velázquez's Venus is a brunette. The female figure can be identified as Venus {{because of the presence of}} her son, Cupid.|$|E
5|$|The {{other three}} songs on Desolate North one was {{recorded}} {{at the same}} place in early 2005, and the other two, the harp pieces, were recorded at Anderson's home. He has said how this was {{the most difficult part of}} the recording. As it happened, Anderson misplaced his microphone stand and so recorded those two songs with the microphone <b>tucked</b> under his chin. Despite the hindrance, Anderson claimed that the microphone picked up everything, and he was happy with the result.|$|E
50|$|A classic <b>Tuck</b> is {{one that}} was {{primarily}} used in the 1980s and 90s. However some modern events, such as the MT Tabor Challenge in Portland Oregon, require this <b>tuck</b> to increase the difficulty on mellow hills. The <b>tuck</b> involves placing both feet {{at the front of}} the board, touching with one foot slightly behind the other. The rider then crouches down somewhat similar to a modern <b>tuck.</b> This <b>tuck</b> provides a severely reduced amount of control due to the rider having minimal control over the rear trucks. Further the stance has higher aerodynamic drag than other <b>tucks.</b>|$|R

5|$|While no {{official}} service uniform {{was developed for}} the tropics, during the Mutiny in India in 1857, many of the regiments fought in their undress uniform (white drill), rather than the standard uniform. The 52nd were the first regiment to dye their white uniforms khaki {{for use in the}} field. This early khaki was a grey colour. For most purposes, they discarded their coats and, adopting the Indian traditions, wore their shirts out, rather than <b>tucked</b> in; shirts were also dyed. The 52nd also developed turbans to wear over their standard-issue forage caps. Following the mutiny, regiments returned to the standard red clothing.|$|E
5|$|Anatomically, {{the human}} {{cerebellum}} has {{the appearance of}} a separate structure attached {{to the bottom of the}} brain, <b>tucked</b> underneath the cerebral hemispheres. Its cortical surface is covered with finely spaced parallel grooves, in striking contrast to the broad irregular convolutions of the cerebral cortex. These parallel grooves conceal the fact that the cerebellar cortex is actually a continuous thin layer of tissue tightly folded in the style of an accordion. Within this thin layer are several types of neurons with a highly regular arrangement, the most important being Purkinje cells and granule cells. This complex neural organization gives rise to a massive signal-processing capability, but almost all of the output from the cerebellar cortex passes through a set of small deep nuclei lying in the white matter interior of the cerebellum.|$|E
5|$|Bats are {{adapted to}} roosting, hanging upside {{down from their}} feet. The femurs are {{attached}} at the hips {{in a way that}} allows them to bend outward and upward in flight. The ankle joint can flex so as to allow the trailing edge of the wings to bend downwards. However, this design does not permit many movements other than hanging or clambering up trees. Most megabats roost with the head <b>tucked</b> towards the belly, whereas most microbats roost with the neck curled towards the back. This difference is reflected {{in the structure of the}} cervical vertebrae in the two groups, which are clearly distinct. Tendons allow bats to lock their feet closed when hanging from a roost. Muscular power is needed to let go, but not to grasp a perch or when holding on.|$|E
50|$|Shortly thereafter, FDR and <b>Tuck</b> go on a mission. They {{are about}} to {{parachute}} out of a Chinook helicopter when FDR reveals that he will marry Lauren, and asks <b>Tuck</b> to be his best man. He reveals that {{he had sex with}} Katie before she met <b>Tuck,</b> but no longer feels guilty about it because <b>Tuck</b> had sex with Lauren. <b>Tuck,</b> however, reveals that they did not go all the way and angrily tackles FDR out of the helicopter.|$|R
5000|$|However, <b>Tuck</b> is {{mentioned}} in an October 1972 Oval Office tape when Nixon, speaking to H.R.

[...] Nixon goes on to describe egged limousines and staged violence in San José, Costa Rica. According to a 1997 The Washington Post article by reporter Karl Vick, Nixon {{was not the first}} to confuse <b>Tuck's</b> record with <b>Tuck's</b> legend.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tuck</b> {{was born}} in Prussia in 1854 the second son of Raphael <b>Tuck</b> and he was educated at Elizabeth's Gymnasium in Breslau. The family immigrated to London, England in the 1860s. <b>Tuck</b> was Jewish.|$|R
