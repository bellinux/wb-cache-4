Emma Eisenberg, of Salon, criticized the scenes depicting Doggett growing up in Waynesboro as being [...] "riddled with excessive Appalachian clichés". She went further by calling Doggett's mother unrealistic in her attitude towards sex: [...] "the mothers I met [...] wanted their daughters to understand sex and to make informed choices". Eisenberg claimed that, therefore, Doggett's mother's speech about sex − [...] "it’s like a bee sting, in and out, over before you knew it was happening" [...] − was not representative of people in Waynesboro at that time. Chloe Stillwell completely disagreed with Eisenberg and insisted that the character of Doggett was realistic: [...] "Eisenberg's argument completely misses the point that perhaps the show is trying to be as real as possible, and acknowledging that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>real</b> life Pennsatuckies in this world isn't to disenfranchise Appalachia." ...|$|E

However, TorrentFreak published a [...] "Top 10 pirated games of 2008" [...] list which shows that intrusive DRM is not the main reason why some games are copied more heavily than others. Popular games such as BioShock, Crysis Warhead, and Mass Effect which use intrusive DRM are strangely absent from the list.|$|E

2500|$|Using the Banach–Tarski paradox, it is {{possible}} to obtain k copies of a ball in the Euclidean n-space from one, for any integers n ≥ 3 and k ≥ 1, i.e. a ball can be cut into k pieces so that each of them is equidecomposable to a ball of {{the same size as the}} original. Using the fact that the free group F2 of rank 2 admits a free subgroup of countably infinite rank, a similar proof yields that the unit sphere S'n−1 can be partitioned into countably infinitely many pieces, each of which is equidecomposable (with two pieces) to the S'n−1 using rotations. By using analytic properties of the rotation group SO(n), which is a connected analytic Lie group, one can further prove that the sphere S'n−1 can be partitioned into as many pieces as <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>real</b> numbers (that is, [...] pieces), so that each piece is equidecomposable with two pieces to S'n−1 using rotations. These results then extend to the unit ball deprived of the origin. A 2010 article by Valeriy Churkin gives a new proof of the continuous version of the Banach–Tarski paradox.|$|E

Fact is, I did feel something. That's why I was so angry. I was angry that five soldiers—the real heroes in my mind—were killed the same day and got far lower billing in the newscasts.
