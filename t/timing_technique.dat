5000|$|Port-tack approach: This {{starting}} {{technique was}} created to allow skippers take advantage of 'holes' in the start line. Every short course race starts with a windward leg. Each vessel is wind-powered and vessels to the windward of each other will block the 'clean air.' As a result, many of the racers will group {{on one end of}} the start line trying to outmaneuver each other for clean air. By taking a port-tack approach, the rogue skipper breaks away from the pack and sails down the start line on a port tack. Using a similar <b>timing</b> <b>technique</b> to reaching out and reaching in, the port-tack approach will require your crew to sail back up the start line and cross at the midline as the horn sounds. This will allow you to sail with clean air at a quicker speed to start the race.|$|E

40|$|Data {{prefetching}} {{technique is}} widely used to bridge the grow-ing performance gap between processor and memory. Nu-merous prefetching techniques have been proposed to exploit data patterns and correlations in the miss address stream. In general, the miss addresses are grouped by some common characteristics, such as program counter or memory region they belong to, into localized streams to improve prefetch accuracy and coverage. However, the existing stream lo-calization technique lacks the timing information of misses. This drawback {{can lead to a}} large fraction of untimely pre-fetches, which in turn limits the effectiveness of prefetching, wastes precious bandwidth and leads to high cache pollu-tion potentially. This paper proposes a novel mechanism named stream <b>timing</b> <b>technique</b> that can largely reduce un-timely prefetches and in turn increase the overall perfor-mance.

We have carried out extensive simulation experiments to verify the design of the stream <b>timing</b> <b>technique</b> and the TAS prefetcher.

Auger neutron spectroscopy of heavy hypernuclei (Pb, U) {{is the most}} direct way to study the shell structure of strongly bound Λ particles in the 1 s, 1 d, 1 f, 2 p, 1 g, 2 d, and 1 h orbits.

30|$|Furthermore, a {{much more}} {{preferable}} way is to combine the above two transmission strategies together. For such a reconfigurable USCS transceiver, when the local clock deviation has exceeded the tolerable error threshold according to the synchronization drifting property, we may use the continuous transmission (i.e., the carrier-synchronized modulation) to correct timing deviations, and simultaneously, conduct energy reservation from received signals {{for the purpose of}} prolonging lifetime of low-cost battery-powered sensor nodes. Once the timing calibration has been completed, or sufficient energy has been accumulated, we may immediately switch to an intermittent mode. In such a hybrid case, the operational power of USCS receiver can be minimized, while ensuring a substantial transmission performance with the assistance of simple and accurate <b>timing</b> <b>technique</b> accompanying low-complexity noncoherent detection.|$|E

To determine the eﬀect of using more realistic lightcurves, transit timing uncertainties are calculated for the case of white noise, measured solar photometric noise and measured solar photometric noise that has been ﬁltered. It is found that for light curves contaminated with realistic photometric noise, the transit timing uncertainties are dramatically increased (and thus moon detection reduced).

Realistic thresholds are derived and analysed {{in the in the}} context of the types of moons that are likely to form and be orbitally stable for the lifetime of the system. For the case of the time-of-arrival perturbation technique, the analysis is conducted in two stages. First, a preliminary investigation is conducted assuming that planet and moon's orbit are circular and coplanar. This analysis is then applied to the case of the pulsar planet PSR B 1620 - 26 b, and used to conclude that a stable moon orbiting this pulsar planet could be detected, if its mass was > 5 % of its planet's mass (2. 5 Jupiter masses), and if the planet-moon distance was ~ 2 % of the planet-pulsar separation (23 AU). Time-of-arrival expressions are then derived for mutually inclined as well as non-circular orbits. For the case of the photometric transit <b>timing</b> <b>technique,</b> a different approach is adopted. First, analytic expressions for the timing perturbation due to the moon are derived for the case where the orbit of the moon is circular and coplanar with that of the planet and where the planet's orbit is circular and aligned to the line-of-sight, circular and inclined with respect to the line-of-sight or eccentric and aligned to the line-of-sight. Second, the timing noise is investigated analytically, for the case of white photometric noise, and numerically, using SOHO lightcurves, for the case of realistic and filtered realistic photometric noise.
