The physical map composed of ESTs and genetic markers provides the positional information of these markers {{as well as the}} starting point of gene identification in the form of genomic clones containing exons. To facilitate the effort of identification of genes in the region spanning D 12 S 1629 and D 12 S 312, we constructed a high-resolution <b>transcript</b> <b>map</b> with PAC/BAC/cosmid clones. The strategy for the construction of such a map involved utilization of STSs for the screening of the large insert bacterial chromosome libraries and a chromosome 12 -specific cosmid library by hybridization. The contig was constructed based on the STS contents of the clones. The resulting high-resolution <b>transcript</b> <b>map</b> of the region between P 273 P 14 /SP 6 and D 12 S 312 spans 4. 4 cM from 66. 8 to 71. 2 cM of the Généthon genetic map and represents ∼ 2. 4 Mb. It was composed of 81 BAC, 45 PAC, and 91 cosmid clones with a minimal tiling path consisting of 16 BAC and 4 PAC clones. These clones are being used to sequence this part of chromosome 12.

Here, we describe {{the establishment of a}} comprehensive YAC-based rice <b>transcript</b> <b>map</b> that contains 6591 EST sites and covers 80. 8 % of the rice genome. Chromosomes 1, 2, and 3 have relatively high EST densities, approximately twice those of chromosomes 11 and 12, and contain 41 % of the total EST sites on the map. Most of the EST-dense regions are distributed on the distal regions of each chromosome arm. Genomic regions flanking the centromeres for most of the chromosomes have lower EST density.

The DNA contains an open reading frame of 1, 725 base pairs encoding a protein of 575 amino acids. <b>Transcript</b> <b>mapping</b> with both S 1 nuclease and primer extension methods revealed numerous initiation sites of RNA synthesis 50 to 80 base pairs downstream from several TATA boxes. The deduced amino acid sequence of delta 1 -pyrroline- 5 -carboxylate dehydrogenase contains a highly basic amino terminus that may serve as the signal sequence that targets this protein to the mitochondrion...|$|R
40|$|The precise map {{positions}} were determined for the 3 '-termini of five transcripts of the Sulfolobus virus-like particle SSV 1. In all cases analyzed, these 3 '-termini mapped immediately downstream of a sequence TTTTTYT which {{was part of}} a pyrimidine-rich region of 16 - 19 nucleotides length. No correlation was evident between the position of the 3 '-termini and possible secondary structures within the RNA. In two cases, the 3 '-termini of SSV 1 <b>transcripts</b> <b>mapped</b> in the immediate vicinity of transcriptional initiation sites suggesting that transcription termination can be linked to the re-initiation of RNA synthesis...|$|R
40|$|Deletion, rearrangement, or {{amplification}} of sequences mapping to chromosome 8 {{are frequently}} observed in human prostate and other tumors. However, {{it is not}} clear whether these events alter the transcriptional activity of the affected genes. To examine this question, we have utilized oligonucleotide microarray technology and compared the transcriptional patterns of normal human prostate tissues and five immortalized cell lines carrying either two normal chromosomes 8 or one normal and one derivative chromosome 8. Comparison of the transcriptional profiles of the tissues and cell lines identified 125 differentially expressed transcripts specific to chromosome 8, with 46 <b>transcripts</b> <b>mapping</b> to 8 p and 79 <b>transcripts</b> <b>mapping</b> to 8 q. The majority of genes mapping to 8 p (44 / 46, 96 %) were transcriptionally down-regulated in cells hemizygous for 8 p, whereas the majority of genes mapping to 8 q (58 / 79, 73 %) were up-regulated in cells carrying three copies of 8 q. Moreover, hemizygous alleles on 8 p exhibited sub-haploinsufficient transcript levels for several genes that could be induced to haploinsufficient levels under hypomethylating conditions, suggesting that epigenetic regulation is a common mechanism for gene silencing in cells deleted for one copy of 8 p. The results of these studies clearly demonstrate that alterations of gene copy number and transcriptional activity are directly correlated in cell lines harboring derivative chromosomes 8, and that these events are commonly observed during cellular immortalization in vitro. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|R
