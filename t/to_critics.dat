5|$|Jane Austen's use of biting irony, {{along with}} her realism and social commentary, have earned her great and {{historical}} importance <b>to</b> <b>critics</b> and scholars.|$|E
5|$|According <b>to</b> <b>critics,</b> the {{inherent}} {{problem with this}} approach is that it relied heavily upon an assumption that Michelangelo only painted buon fresco, that he was always satisfied with the result {{at the end of the}} day, and that in four and a half years spent on the ceiling, he stuck exclusively to one approach, and never made small alterations or added details. Arguimbau, on his website, quotes Colalucci, the head of the team, as contradicting himself on this matter.|$|E
5|$|Carson and {{the others}} {{involved}} with publication of Silent Spring expected fierce criticism. They were particularly concerned {{about the possibility of}} being sued for libel. Carson was also undergoing radiation therapy to combat her spreading cancer, and expected to have little energy to devote to defending her work and responding <b>to</b> <b>critics.</b> In preparation for the anticipated attacks, Carson and her agent attempted to amass as many prominent supporters as possible before the book's release.|$|E

5|$|That {{part of the}} {{restoration}} in the Sistine Chapel which has caused the most concern is the ceiling, painted by Michelangelo. The emergence of the brightly coloured Ancestors of Christ from the gloom sparked a reaction of fear that the processes being employed in the cleaning were too severe. Despite warnings, {{the work on the}} ceiling proceeded and, according <b>to</b> <b>critics</b> such as James Beck, their worst fears were confirmed once the ceiling was completed.|$|E
5|$|The Mexican {{interior}} ministry banned the film {{because of a}} series of burglaries mimicking its heist scene. Rififi was banned in Finland in the late 1950s. In answer <b>to</b> <b>critics</b> who saw the film as an educational process that taught people how to commit burglary, Dassin claimed the film showed how difficult it was to actually carry out a crime.|$|E
5|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for the official remix, directed by Dave Meyers, {{was intended to}} rely solely on choreography, and integrate different styles of dance. It features appearances from several dance crews, such as Beat Freaks and Poreotics. According <b>to</b> <b>critics,</b> the video makes allusions to previous dance-heavy clips by Usher and Chris Brown. Bieber performed the song {{at a number of}} venues, including the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards and on the seventh series of The X Factor in the United Kingdom.|$|E

5|$|The {{book was}} first {{published}} on September 1, 2009, by Scholastic, in hardcover, and was later released in ebook and audiobook format. Catching Fire received mostly positive reviews, with reviewers praising Collins' prose, the book's ending, {{and the development of}} Katniss's character. According <b>to</b> <b>critics,</b> major themes of the novel include survival, authoritarianism, rebellion and interdependence versus independence. The book has sold more than 19 million copies in the U.S. alone.|$|E
5|$|The song {{received}} positive reviews, peaking {{at eighteen}} in the United States, and charting on other U.S. charts, including {{the top ten}} of the Pop Songs. It also charted abroad in Canada and New Zealand. The song's accompanying music video, which {{takes place in a}} desert and features a countdown clock in conjunction with the song's meaning, was received warmly, and according <b>to</b> <b>critics,</b> was an end to the low-budget, storyline-centered, debut music videos from previous American Idol alumni.|$|E
5|$|Carpentier {{was a great}} {{admirer of}} Spanish author Miguel de Cervantes, having cited him {{in a number of}} {{different}} texts throughout his career. The Prologue begins with a quote from Cervantes' Los trabajos de Persiles y Sigismunda (Persiles and Sigismunda), which is subsequently mentioned, with a focus on the character of Rutilio. The mention of Rutilio is noteworthy, as the episode has been of interest <b>to</b> <b>critics</b> due to its magical subject matter, concerning lycanthropy. Both works feature a distant and exotic land where the marvellous is present by means of metamorphoses, and viewed from the characters' perspective.|$|E
500|$|With the Rollins Band, his lyrics focused [...] "almost {{exclusively}} on {{issues relating to}} personal integrity," [...] according <b>to</b> <b>critic</b> Geoffrey Welchman.|$|R

5|$|The {{judicial}} establishment, in {{the broadest}} sense, is composed of qadis, who give binding judgements in specific court cases, and muftis {{and other members of}} the ulema, who issue generalized but highly influential legal opinions (fatwas). The Grand Mufti is the most senior member of the judicial establishment as well as being the highest religious authority in the country; his opinions are highly influential among the Saudi judiciary. The judiciary proper (that is, the body of qadis) is composed of about 700 judges, a relatively small number (according <b>to</b> <b>critics)</b> for a country of over 23 million.|$|E
5|$|When a {{new type}} of film {{allowing}} the photographing of faster moving action was introduced in 1931, Cronjager was one of the cinematographers who participated in the ASC's field testing of the product. In 1932 Cronjager worked with two other well-known cinematographers, Lucien Andriot and Clyde De Vinna, on King Vidor's film, Bird of Paradise. The individual results of the three photographers was very high quality, but the integration of their work, all with very different styles, proved less than desirable <b>to</b> <b>critics.</b> Cronjager worked with Dix again in 1933, on the film The Lost Squadron, which also starred Mary Astor, and was directed by George Archainbaud.|$|E
5|$|In {{the latter}} half of the 20th century, the {{influence}} of the romance tradition of Arthur continued, through novels such as T. H. White's The Once and Future King (1958) and Marion Zimmer Bradley's The Mists of Avalon (1982) in addition to comic strips such as Prince Valiant (from 1937 onward). Tennyson had reworked the romance tales of Arthur to suit and comment upon the issues of his day, and the same is often the case with modern treatments too. Bradley's tale, for example, takes a feminist approach to Arthur and his legend, in contrast to the narratives of Arthur found in medieval materials, and American authors often rework the story of Arthur to be more consistent with values such as equality and democracy. The romance Arthur has become popular in film and theatre as well. T. H. White's novel was adapted into the Lerner and Loewe stage musical Camelot (1960) and the Disney animated film The Sword in the Stone (1963); Camelot, with its focus on the love of Lancelot and Guinevere and the cuckolding of Arthur, was itself made into a film of the same name in 1967. The romance tradition of Arthur is particularly evident and, according <b>to</b> <b>critics,</b> successfully handled in Robert Bresson's Lancelot du Lac (1974), Eric Rohmer's Perceval le Gallois (1978) and perhaps John Boorman's fantasy film Excalibur (1981); it is also the main source of the material used in the Arthurian spoof Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975).|$|E
