5|$|The clade Oviraptorosauria is {{generally}} regarded {{as a group of}} non-avian (or non-bird) theropod dinosaurs, and their similarity to birds (Aves) has often been noted. Fossils of oviraptorosaurs in the family Caenagnathidae have historically been confused with those of birds, and some researchers have {{gone so far as to}} consider oviraptorosaurs as a whole more closely related to birds than to other non-avian dinosaurs. In 2002 Lü and colleagues used the then unnamed Nemegtomaia to show similarities between birds and oviraptorosaurs, and found the latter group to be closer to birds than to bird-like dinosaurs such as dromaeosaurs. They therefore concluded that oviraptorosaurs were flightless birds rather than non-avian dinosaurs, and noted that the boundary between birds and dinosaurs was becoming more and more difficult <b>to</b> <b>delineate.</b> Other researchers have instead found dromaeosaurs and troodontids to be most closely related to birds, together forming the group Paraves; oviraptorosaurs, therizinosaurs, and alvarezsaurs are just outside this group. The wider group that includes oviraptorosaurs and Paraves is called Pennaraptora, and this group is defined by the presence of pennaceous feathers (feathers with a stalk).|$|E
5|$|The chroniclers {{report that}} after sacking Tyana, Abbas and Maslama divided their forces and campaigned in Byzantine territory. Again the chronology, {{as well as}} the {{identity}} of the targets, is uncertain. The primary sources give 709 or 710 as the dates, which could mean that these raids happened {{in the immediate aftermath of}} Tyana or in the year after. Abbas raided Cilicia and from there turned west as far as Dorylaion, while Maslama seized the fortresses of Kamouliana and Heraclea Cybistra near Tyana, or, according to another interpretation of the Arabic sources, marched also west and took Heraclea Pontica and Nicomedia, while some of his troops raided Chrysopolis across from Constantinople itself. Arab raids continued for the next years, and were carried out even while a huge army under Maslama was besieging Constantinople in 717–718. After the failure of this undertaking, Arab attacks continued, but they were now concerned with plunder and prestige, rather than outright conquest. Although the Umayyad attacks of the early 8th century were successful in gaining control of the border districts of Cilicia and the region around Melitene, and despite their destruction of Byzantine strongholds like Tyana in the following decades, the Arabs were never able to permanently establish a presence west of the Taurus Mountains, which thus came <b>to</b> <b>delineate</b> the Arab-Byzantine frontier for the next two centuries.|$|E

40|$|A {{method was}} {{developed}} <b>to</b> quantitatively <b>delineate</b> waste concentrations throughout waste effluent mixing zones {{on the basis}} of densitometric measurements extracted from aerial photography. A mixing zone is the extent of a receiving water body ultilized to dilute a waste discharge to a concentration characteristic of a totally mixed condition. Simultaneously-acquired color infrared photography and suspended solids water samples were used <b>to</b> quantitatively <b>delineate</b> the mixing zone resulting from the discharge of a paper mill effluent. Digital scanning microdensitometer data was used <b>to</b> estimate and <b>delineate</b> suspended solids concentrations {{on the basis of}} a semi-empirical model. Photographic photometry, when predicated on a limited amount of ground sampling, can measure and delineate mixing zone waste distributions in more detail then conventional surface measuring techniques. The method has direct application to: (1) the establishment of definite and rational water quality guidelines; (2) the development of sampling and surveillance programs for use by governmental and private agencies; and (3) the development of design and location criteria for industrial and municipal waste effluent outfalls...|$|R

25|$|The current {{pattern for}} {{distribution}} {{of seats in}} the House of Delegates began with the legislative apportionment plan of 1972 and has been revised every ten years thereafter. The plan created 47 legislative districts, many of which cross county boundaries <b>to</b> <b>delineate</b> districts relatively equal in population. Each legislative district sends three delegates {{for a total of}} 141 members of the House. Some of the larger districts are divided into delegate sub-districts to provide local representation to areas not large enough to constitute an entire legislative district.|$|E
25|$|Generally, a state's {{exclusive}} {{economic zone}} is an area beyond and adjacent to the territorial sea, extending seaward to a distance {{of no more than}} 200 nautical miles (370km) out from its coastal baseline. The exception to this rule occurs when {{exclusive economic zone}}s would overlap; that is, state coastal baselines are less than 400 nautical miles (740km) apart. When an overlap occurs, {{it is up to the}} states <b>to</b> <b>delineate</b> the actual maritime boundary. Generally, any point within an overlapping area defaults to the nearest state.|$|E
25|$|Of perhaps {{greatest}} {{significance was}} the work accomplished during Manuel Bonillo's administration <b>to</b> <b>delineate</b> the long-disputed border with Nicaragua. The area, called the Mosquitia region, was located {{in the eastern part}} of the country in the department of Gracias a Dios. The area was large but virtually unpopulated except for small groups of Miskito who owed little allegiance to either nation. In 1894 a treaty provided for the establishment of a boundary commission, composed of representatives of Honduras and Nicaragua, to resolve the dispute.|$|E
