On this stage, the race's overall {{favorites}} began to creep back {{into the top of}} the overall classification, as previous race leaders Nibali, Vinokourov, and Evans assumed 8th through 10th in the standings. There were again great changes to the overall classification in stage 15, by way of the climb up Monte Zoncolan. Ivan Basso won the stage and greatly reduced his deficit to Arroyo, though the Spaniard still held the pink jersey after this stage. Evans, Scarponi, Vinokourov, and Nibali also finished well-placed and moved up. Wiggins again fell out of contention, this time conclusively so, by losing 25 minutes on the climb. Evans turned in the best ride of the pre-race favorites in the Plan de Corones time <b>trial,</b> <b>closing</b> his deficit to Basso and moving past Sastre in the overall. After this stage, the only riders left in the top ten from the L'Aquila breakaway were Arroyo, Porte, Sastre, and Robert Kišerlovski, who all finished the Giro in the top ten.|$|E

More than 35 witnesses testified at the <b>trial.</b> <b>Closing</b> arguments finished on March 4, 2014. The jury deliberations resulted in a hung jury on the four counts for both Rosemond and co-defendant Johnson.

5000|$|Sales representatives {{also learn}} to {{recognise}} specific verbal and non-verbal cues that potentially signal the prospect's readiness to buy. For instance, if a prospect begins {{to handle the}} merchandise, this may indicate a state of buyer interest. Clients also tend to employ different types of questions throughout the sales process. General questions such as, [...] "Does it come in any other colours (or styles)? indicate only a moderate level of interest. However, when clients begin to ask specific questions, such as [...] "Do you have this model in black?" [...] then this indicates that the prospect is approaching readiness to buy. When the sales person believes that the prospective buyer is ready to make the purchase, a <b>trial</b> <b>close</b> {{might be used to}} test the waters. A <b>trial</b> <b>close</b> is simply any attempt to confirm the buyer's interest in finalising the sale.

40|$|Background: High {{levels of}} {{distress}} {{and need for}} self-care information by patients commencing chemotherapy suggest that current prechemotherapy education is suboptimal. We conducted a randomised, controlled trial of a prechemotherapy education intervention (ChemoEd) to assess impact on patient distress, treatment-related concerns, and the prevalence and severity of and bother caused by six chemotherapy side-effects. Patients and methods: One hundred and ninety-two breast, gastrointestinal, and haematologic cancer patients were recruited before the <b>trial</b> <b>closing</b> prematurely (original target 352). ChemoEd patients received a DVD, question-prompt list, self-care information, an education consultation &# 8805; 24 h before first treatment (intervention 1), telephone follow-up 48 h after first treatment (intervention 2), and a face-to-face review immediately before second treatment (intervention 3). Patient outcomes were measured at baseline (T 1 : pre-education) and immediately preceding treatment cycles 1 (T 2) and 3 (T 3). Results: ChemoEd did not significantly reduce patient distress. However, {{a significant decrease in}} sensory/psychological (P = 0. 027) and procedural (P = 0. 03) concerns, as well as prevalence and severity of and bother due to vomiting (all P = 0. 001), were observed at T 3. In addition, subgroup analysis of patients with elevated distress at T 1 indicated a significant decrease (P = 0. 035) at T 2 but not at T 3 (P = 0. 055) in ChemoEd patients. Conclusions: ChemoEd holds promise to improve patient treatment-related concerns and some physical/psychological outcomes; however, further research is required on more diverse patient populations to ensure generalisability...|$|E

If the sales person feels that the customer is ready, then they may seek to gain commitment and close the sale.
