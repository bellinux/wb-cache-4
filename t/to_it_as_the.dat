5|$|A single {{prototype}} of the two-seat trainer was the first aircraft of the first production batch built by Factory No. 31 {{in the fall of}} 1946. The prototype did not begin manufacturer's flight testing until 5 April 1947, even though the primary differences from the single-seat version were limited to a redesigned forward fuselage that accommodated an additional cockpit for the trainee where the armament used to be and a sideways-opening, canopy. The trainer was initially designated as the Yak-Jumo vyvoznoy, but it was eventually designated as the Yak-21 although some documents refer <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Yak-15V, Yak-15UT or Yak-21V. Further work on the trainer was cancelled with the success of the trainer version of the Yak-17 with its tricycle undercarriage.|$|E
5|$|As no {{description}} of the frieze survives from antiquity and many religious rituals involved secret symbolism and traditions left unspoken, so {{the question of the}} meaning of the sculpture has been a persistent and unresolved one. The first published attempt at interpretation belongs to Cyriac of Ancona in the fifteenth century AD who referred <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> “victories of Athens in the time of Pericles”. What is now the more accepted view of the piece, however, namely that it depicts the Greater Panathenaic procession from the Leokoreion by the Dipylon gate, to the Acropolis, was mooted by Stuart and Revett in the second volume of their Antiquities of Athens, 1787. Subsequent interpretations have built largely on this theory, even if they disallow that a temple sculpture could represent a contemporary event rather than a mythological or historical one. It has only been in recent years that an alternative thesis in which the frieze depicts the founding myth of the city of Athens instead of the festival pompe has emerged.|$|E
5|$|As one of {{the largest}} open spaces close to Manchester, the moor has a history of use for army {{manoeuvres}} and large public gatherings. In his book The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844, Friedrich Engels referred <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Mons Sacer of Manchester. This was a reference to the hill to which the plebs (common citizens) of Rome withdrew en masse in 494 BC as an act of civil protest.|$|E

5|$|As {{the years}} pass, the rural area {{gives way to}} a more {{urbanized}} setting. New buildings and highways spring up, more housing developments are built, and the farmers are pushed out. Though much of the wildlife has left and hunting grows increasingly difficult, Tod stays because it is his home range. The other foxes that remain become unhealthy scavengers, and their natures changelife-bonds with their mates are replaced by promiscuity, couples going their separate ways once the mating act is over. The Master has lost most of his own land, and the only dog he owns now is Copper. Each winter they still hunt Tod, and {{in an odd way}} he looks forward <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> only aspect of his old life that remains.|$|E
5|$|Broken Sword II: The Smoking Mirror is a 2D {{adventure}} {{game played}} from a third-person perspective. Via a point-and-click interface, the player guides protagonist George Stobbart through the game's world and {{interacts with the}} environment by selecting from multiple commands, while Nicole Collard is also a playable character in selected portions of the game. The player controls George's movements and actions with a mouse (PC and PlayStation), or a gamepad (PlayStation). Player can collect objects {{that can be used}} with either other collectible objects, parts of the scenery, or with other people in order to solve puzzles and progress in the game. George can engage in dialogue with other characters through conversation trees to gain hints of {{what needs to be done}} to solve the puzzles or to progress the plot. The player uses a map to travel, and new locations are added <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> story unfolds. By right clicking on an object, the player gets a description and clues. The player character's death is possible if the player makes a wrong decision.|$|E
5|$|By 12 August, the {{outskirts}} of Kharkov had been reached. The Soviet advance was finally halted by a counter-attack by the 2nd and 3rd SS Panzer Divisions. In the ensuing tank battles, the Soviet armies suffered heavy losses in armour. After this setback, the Soviets focused on Kharkov. After heavy fighting the city was liberated on 23 August. This battle is referred to by the Germans as the Fourth Battle of Kharkov, while the Soviets refer <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Belgorod–Kharkov offensive operation.|$|E

5|$|Cleveland has a bus {{and rail}} mass transit system {{operated}} by the Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority (RTA). The rail portion is officially called the RTA Rapid Transit, but local residents refer <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>The</b> Rapid. It consists of two light rail lines, known as the Green and Blue Lines, and a heavy rail line, the Red Line. In 2008, RTA completed the HealthLine, a bus rapid transit line, for which naming rights were purchased by the Cleveland Clinic and University Hospitals. It runs along Euclid Avenue from downtown through University Circle, ending at the Louis Stokes Station at Windermere in East Cleveland. In 2007, the American Public Transportation Association named Cleveland's mass transit system the best in North America.|$|E
5|$|Egan's {{elevation}} to the episcopate worsened {{an existing}} {{conflict in the}} American church: the dispute over trusteeism. In Europe, the Church owned property and directly controlled its parishes through the clergy. In the United States, however, early Catholic churches were typically founded by laymen who purchased the property and erected the church buildings. The laypeople accordingly demanded some control over {{the administration of the}} parish, even after the arrival of clergy from Europe who, like Egan, held the traditional view of parish organization. The dispute also had nationalist elements <b>to</b> <b>it,</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> heavily German parish of Holy Trinity resented the imposition of an Irish bishop instead of one of their own. When Holy Trinity's pastor left for a new assignment in Maryland in 1811, the trustees there were perturbed at Egan's temporary appointment of an Irish priest, Patrick Kenny, to lead the parish, until a German priest could be found (a German priest, Francis Roloff, was assigned the following year).|$|E
5|$|Enterprise NX-01 was {{designed}} by Doug Drexler, {{and based on the}} features of the Akira-class. The new class itself was designated as NX by the producers, but Drexler referred <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Enterprise-class due to the naval tradition of naming the class after the first vessel. Drexler had intended for the ship to be similar in design to the Daedalus-class starship with a sphere-shaped primary hull, but the producers wanted a flat saucer-shaped hull as it was more immediately recognizable as a Star Trek vessel. Drexler deliberately attempted to insert references to The Original Series into the ship. One of these was narrow struts leading from the body of the ship to the warp nacelles – however Dan Curry wanted them made bulkier as seen in ships of later series. Drexler included a leading edge {{at the front of the}} nacelles, and later described that the original struts would have been around a third more than those.|$|E

At Survivor Series in November 2001, the WCW United States and WWF Intercontinental Championships were unified, resulting in the United States Championship being deactivated. In July 2003, the title was reactivated as the WWE United States Championship. Since the 2017 WWE Superstar Shake-up, it is exclusively contested on the SmackDown brand.|$|E
5|$|In {{a feature}} {{on the five}} best Fire Emblem titles up until 2013, Chris Carter of Destructoid {{included}} Genealogy of the Holy War among them due to the many lasting features it introduced to the series. In a retrospective feature about games not released in the United Kingdom, Digital Spy's Damian McFerren referred <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> best game in the series, decrying its exclusivity to Japan. In a different feature for RPGamer, writer Cassandra Ramos called the game the entry she most wished to see released overseas due to its scale and quality {{when compared to other}} entries from the period. Both noted that Genealogy of the Holy War was a suitable subject for a remake {{in the wake of the}} international success of more recent titles in the series.|$|E

5|$|Sedna has an {{exceptionally}} long and elongated orbit, taking approximately 11,400 {{years to complete}} and a distant point of closest approach to the Sun at 76AU. These facts have led to much speculation about its origin. The Minor Planet Center currently places Sedna in the scattered disc, a group of objects sent into highly elongated orbits by the gravitational influence of Neptune. However, this classification has been contested, because Sedna never comes close enough to Neptune to have been scattered by it, leading some astronomers to informally refer <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> first known member of the inner Oort cloud. Others speculate {{that it might have}} been tugged into its current orbit by a passing star, perhaps one within the Sun's birth cluster (an open cluster), or even that it was captured from another star system. Another hypothesis suggests that its orbit may be evidence for a large planet beyond the orbit of Neptune.|$|E

It topped Billboards Hard Rock Albums chart, as well as the national albums chart in Switzerland, and peaked within the top ten in fifteen other countries.|$|E
5|$|The name can be spelled either Ramblin Reck or Ramblin Wreck. In all spellings, {{there is}} no g in Ramblin.

Ramblin' Reck Club has spelled the word Reck since their 1945 club charter. The Institute has adopted the spelling Ramblin' Wreck and holds a trademark on the phrase. Reck Club still refers to the Ramblin' Wreck as the Ramblin' Reck while most other agencies refer <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Ramblin' Wreck.|$|E

References to the practice as mutilation increased throughout the 1970s. In 1975 Rose Oldfield Hayes, an American anthropologist, used the term female genital mutilation in the title of a paper in American Ethnologist, and four years later Fran Hosken, an Austrian-American feminist writer, called it mutilation in her influential The Hosken Report: Genital and Sexual Mutilation of Females.|$|E
