5|$|After {{the end of}} the war many of {{the ships}} were placed in reserve or sent to foreign stations, often as the flagship. During the Third Carlist War of 1872–76 Thétis, Reine Blanche and Jeanne d'Arc spent time in Spanish waters where they could protect French {{citizens}} and interests. In 1875, the latter ship rammed and sank the dispatch vessel Forfait. On 3 July 1877 Thétis rammed Reine Blanche who had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>run</b> ashore to prevent her from sinking.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the Army had to handle huge {{stockpiles}} of equipment, stores and supplies. Some were far {{in excess of}} the Army's needs and had to be disposed of. Hospitals still had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>run,</b> although some were transferred to the Department of Repatriation. The Army had to maintain its schools and training establishments. Moreover, the Army had to field and maintain part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in Japan. Over next fifty years, operations would be conducted by the new Australian Regular Army that Sturdee created, rather than the Militia or specially enlisted expeditionary forces.|$|E
5|$|During the war Zinn {{allowed it}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>run</b> around the clock, and its design {{made it easy}} to conduct experiments. This {{included}} tests to investigate the properties of isotopes such as tritium and determine the neutron capture cross section of elements and compounds that might be used to construct future reactors, or occur in impurities. They were also used for trials of instrumentation, and in experiments to determine thermal stability of materials, and to train operators.|$|E

5|$|Gundamma Katha was a {{profitable}} venture for Vijaya Vauhini Studios; it completed a 100-day run in 17 theatres across Andhra Pradesh, and completed a silver-jubilee {{run at the}} Durga Kalamandir, Vijayawada. It became the first Telugu film <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>run</b> for 100 days with three screenings per day in Hyderabad. The silver-jubilee celebrations were not held, and the planned budget for the event was donated to a fundraiser who was active during the Sino-Indian War.|$|E

5|$|Rescued by Rover {{contains}} more than twenty shots; this is a considerable advance when compared with Hepworth's own How it Feels <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>Run</b> Over (1900), which contains a single shot. This not only made the film longer, but demonstrated that advances in film language could be made in editing as well as shooting. Additionally, the editing of Rescued by Rover is notable in its use of time contractions, which made Rover's journeys take considerably less time by portrayal {{than they would have}} in reality.|$|E
5|$|The Simpsons' {{family members}} that showed up {{took some time}} to be made, but the staff enjoyed the results. All of the male Simpson family members that showed up were voiced by Dan Castellaneta, the voice of Homer. He had asked for the {{recording}} tape <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>run</b> for about 20 minutes, so he could do many different voice variations that would fit the different men, but still be close to Homer's voice.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} intention {{had been}} for the new railway, once completed, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>run</b> by Union Railways as a separate line {{from the rest of}} the British railway network. As part of the 1998 rescue it was agreed that, following completion, section 1 would be purchased by Railtrack with an option to purchase section2. In return, Railtrack was committed to operate the whole route as well as St Pancras railway station, which, unlike all other former British Rail stations, had been transferred to LCR/Union Railways in 1996.|$|E

5|$|With the {{destruction}} of Elisa, the British squadrons returned to their blockade duties off Cherbourg and Le Havre. The blockade remained in place throughout {{the remainder of the}} Napoleonic Wars; Rosseau in Amazone made another attempt to join the squadron in Cherbourg in March 1811, only <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>run</b> down and destroyed by a squadron led by the ship of the line HMS Berwick. The new Iphigénie survived a little longer, being intercepted and captured in the Atlantic during a raiding mission in January 1814.|$|E
5|$|After the United States Army Corps of Engineers {{took over}} the Manhattan Project, it gave {{responsibility}} for the detailed design and construction of the reactors to DuPont. There was friction between the company and Wigner and his team. Major differences between Wigner's reactor design and DuPont's included {{increasing the number of}} process tubes from 1,500 in a circular array to 2,004 in a square array, and cutting the power from 500 MW to 250 MW. As it turned out, the design decision by DuPont to give the reactor additional tubes came in handy when neutron poisoning became a problem for the B Reactor at the Hanford Site. The extra tubes allowed a greater fuel load to overcome the poisoning. Without them the reactor would have had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>run</b> at low power until enough of the boron impurities in the graphite had been burned up to allow it to reach full power, which would have delayed full operation by up to a year.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the first subway opened in 1904, the lines had been {{consolidated}} into two privately owned systems, the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT, later Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation, BMT) and the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT). The city built most of the lines and leased them to the companies. The first line of the city-owned and operated Independent Subway System (IND) opened in 1932; this system was intended {{to compete with the}} private systems and allow some of the elevated railways to be torn down, but stayed within the core of the City due to its small startup capital. This required it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>run</b> 'at cost', necessitating fares up to double the five-cent fare popular at the time.|$|E

5|$|Da Matta, Andretti, and Franchitti contended {{for third}} {{position}} until the field closed {{up because of}} the presence of slower cars. The third caution was shown fourteen laps later when Adrián Fernández lost engine power driving into the second turn, and he went to the bottom of the track on the backstretch to retire. Oil was laid on the track heading into turn two, and marshals were required to clean it. It was announced on lap 90 that Kniefel had reduced the number of laps <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>run</b> from 168 to 140 because of the danger from fading sunlight. All of the leaders (including Bräck) chose to make pit stops for fuel and tyres under caution on lap 100. Castroneves passed da Matta and Andretti around the inside in the pit lane and Newman/Haas Racing believed he had committed an infraction. The team informed CART of Castroneves' passing, which was observed by their co-owner Paul Newman.|$|E
5|$|During {{the years}} of the interregnum, Ludlow Castle {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>run</b> by Parliamentarian governors, the first being the military commander Samuel More. There was a Royalist plot to retake the castle in 1648, but no other military activity took place. The most valuable items in the castle were removed shortly after the siege, and the remainder of the luxurious furnishings were sold off in the town in 1650. The castle was initially kept garrisoned, but in 1653, most of the weapons in the castle were removed on the grounds of security and sent to Hereford, then in 1655 the garrison was disbanded altogether. In 1659, the political instability in the Commonwealth government led to the castle being regarrisoned by 100 men under the command of William Botterell.|$|E
5|$|Georgia Tech {{football}} was Atlanta's one major sports franchise {{during this time}} frame. To hold a ticket to watch the Yellow Jackets play was highly valued and was difficult to obtain. During the games, Bobby Dodd sat in a folding chair at a card table on the side line, rarely standing or showing interest in the game. Dodd took his seat and left the pacing to his assistants. When a crisis arose, Dodd would decide which plays <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>run</b> and the designated players to run them. Dodd sometimes made unusual substitutions, as on a Saturday in Athens when Georgia Tech {{was about to be}} upset. Dodd sent in a small halfback who had been frequently injured during his career, who then broke to the right faking a run, stopped, threw a pass for a touchdown and returned to the bench. What Dodd brought to Grant Field was a kind of unbruising football other coaches couldn't understand: runty halfbacks; lightweight linemen; rarely a classic quarterback. Once free substitution became possible, no one made more use of it than Dodd.|$|E
