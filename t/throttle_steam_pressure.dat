40|$|AbstractWhen {{moisture}} saturated composites {{are rapidly}} heated, the <b>steam</b> <b>pressure</b> inside cavities {{can cause the}} composite to delaminate. We study the effect of heating rate on the <b>steam</b> <b>pressure</b> inside an isolated long thin “crack-like” cavity of thickness h assuming that the chemical potential of water is continuous across the cavity/polymer interface. For such a cavity in an infinite plate, we show there is sufficient moisture for the <b>steam</b> <b>pressure</b> to reach the saturated <b>steam</b> <b>pressure,</b> irrespective of the heating rate. However, for a plate of thickness L exposed to dry air, the cavity pressure reaches a maximum value, which depends only on the normalized plate thickness, α=L/h and normalized heating rate, β=T˙h 2 /T 0 D(T 0) where T˙ is the heating rate, D(T 0) is the moisture diffusivity at the initial temperature T 0, before it decays to zero because of the dry air outside. For this case, the maximum <b>steam</b> <b>pressure</b> can be significantly less than the saturation pressure. The results in this work {{can also be used}} to study ‘popcorning’ observed in electronic packages...|$|R

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this research}} were to {{study the effects of}} <b>steam</b> <b>pressure</b> treatments on the physicochemical properties of corn flour and to apply the corn flour for cookies production. The research was conducted in three stages. The first stage was the production of corn flour through wet milling process. The second stage was the analysis of physicochemical properties of corn flours receiving <b>steam</b> <b>pressure</b> treatment for 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 minutes. The third stage was the production of cookies using the pre-treated corn flour. Thermal properties evaluation of the corn flour showed that gelatinization temperatures (To, Tp, Tc) and gelatinization degrees (DG) increased but gelatinization enthalpy (ΔH) and temperature range (R) decreased as the time for <b>steam</b> <b>pressure</b> treatment increased. The rheological properties showed that maximum viscosity (PV), hot paste viscosity (HPV), breakdown viscosity (BV), cold paste viscosity (CPV) and setback viscosity (SV) of pre-treated corn flour decreased as the <b>steam</b> <b>pressure</b> treatment time increased. The <b>steam</b> <b>pressure</b> treatment changed the gelatinization profile from B to C type. Correlation analyses showed that the PV had positive correlation with swelling volume. The PV, HPV, BV, CPV and SV had negative correlation with the DG. The swelling volume and water solubility of the pre-treated corn flour were significantly affected by the <b>steam</b> <b>pressure</b> time. The swelling volume decreased but the water solubility increased. The <b>steam</b> <b>pressure</b> treatment did not give significant effects to water absorption capacity (WAC), amylose, amylopectin and moisture content of corn flour. The DG had positive correlation with the water solubility and the WAC but it had negative correlation with the swelling volume. The water solubility had negative correlation with the ΔH.

The effects of board density, <b>steam</b> <b>pressure,</b> and treatment {{time on the}} properties of the board were evaluated. The target board densities were relatively low, ranging from 0.40 to 0.70 [*]g/cm 3. The properties [i.e., moduli of rupture (MOR) and elasticity (MOE) in both dry and wet conditions, internal bonding strength (IB), and water absorption (WA)] of the boards increased linearly with increasing board density. <b>Steam</b> <b>pressure</b> and treatment time also affected the board properties. The bending strength and IB were improved with increased <b>steam</b> <b>pressure.</b> A long <b>steam</b> treatment time contributed to low thickness swelling (TS) values and thus better dimensional stability. The appropriate <b>steam</b> <b>pressure</b> was 1.0 [*]MPa, and the treatment time was 10 – 15 [*]min. The properties for 0.55 [*]g/cm 3 density boards under optimum conditions were MOR 12.6 [*]MPa, MOE 2.5 [*]GPa, IB 0.49 [*]MPa, TS 7.5 %, and wet MOR 2.4 [*]MPa.

40|$|AbstractFoam {{properties}} {{depend on}} the physico-chemical characteristics of the continuous phase, the method of production and process conditions employed; however the preparation of barista-style milk foams in coffee shops by injection of steam uses milk as its main ingredient which limits the control of foam properties by changing the biochemical characteristics of the continuous phase. Therefore, the control of process conditions and nozzle design are the only ways available to produce foams with diverse properties. Milk foams were produced employing different <b>steam</b> <b>pressures</b> (100 – 280 kPa gauge) and nozzle designs (ejector, plunging-jet and confined-jet nozzles). The foamability of milk, and the stability, bubble size and texture of the foams were investigated. Variations in <b>steam</b> <b>pressure</b> and nozzle design changed the hydrodynamic conditions during foam production, resulting in foams having a range of properties. <b>Steam</b> <b>pressure</b> influenced foam characteristics, although the net effect depended on the nozzle design used. These results suggest that, {{in addition to the}} physicochemical determinants of milk, the foam properties can also be controlled by changing the <b>steam</b> <b>pressure</b> and nozzle design...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{proportion}} of the intermittent and non "dispatchable" renewable resources such as solar or wind power will increase in the future. A higher flexibility will be required for the "controllable" generation facilities to guarantee the power production and consumption balance and particularly the combined cycle. Numerous {{studies have been done}} to reduce the start-up time for combined cycle, but some grid variations necessiate faster power response known as primary and secondary frequency control which consist of power variations added to the power reference. To deliver a faster and bigger powier response it is worthwhile to consider the use of the <b>steam</b> turbine.
