5|$|M-33 was {{designated}} by 1919 along {{a section of}} the current highway between Mio and Atlanta. The highway also included roadway segments south of Mio that are now parts of other trunklines. The portion south of Mio was rerouted in the mid-1920s, transferring sections to M-72 in the process. The state started extending M-33 in both directions in 1930s. The current highway segment between Onaway and Cheboygan was the former route of US Highway 23 (US23) until 1940 when the latter highway was realigned onto an alignment that runs along Lake Huron. Several minor changes have been made to M-33's routing since the 1950s <b>to</b> <b>straighten</b> <b>out</b> curves or finish paving the highway.|$|E
5|$|Task Force Katrina Commander Army Lt. Gen. Russel Honore {{also charged}} the paratroopers <b>to</b> <b>straighten</b> <b>out</b> the {{evacuation}} situations at Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport, the New Orleans Convention Center and the Superdome. In all, 3,600 of the division's paratroopers were deployed to New Orleans {{to participate in}} Task Force All-American. The unit worked in tandem with state, local and other federal authorities to feed, process and transport evacuees to other accommodations; the division's soldiers helped evacuate 6,000 New Orleans residents. By September 18, the 82nd Division medical personnel had treated 1,352people and given 2,047 immunizations, according to unit documents. By September 19, 82nd Division military engineers had cleared 185 city blocks of debris, cleared 113 streets, and removed 218 trees, according to unit documents.|$|E

25|$|After {{returning}} to the United States, he undertook several exhausting tours. His agent Johnny Collins's erratic behavior and his own spending ways left Armstrong short of cash. Breach of contract violations plagued him. Finally, he hired Joe Glaser as his new manager, a tough mob-connected wheeler-dealer, who began <b>to</b> <b>straighten</b> <b>out</b> his legal mess, his mob troubles, and his debts. Armstrong also began to experience problems with his fingers and lips, which were aggravated by his unorthodox playing style. As a result, he branched out, developing his vocal style and making his first theatrical appearances. He appeared in movies again, including Crosby's 1936 hit Pennies from Heaven. In 1937, Armstrong substituted for Rudy Vallee on the CBS radio network {{and became the first}} African American to host a sponsored, national broadcast.|$|E
25|$|After the crash, many American {{retailers}} considered {{video games}} a passing fad, and greatly reduced sales of such products, or stopped them entirely. To avoid {{the stigma of}} video game consoles, Nintendo marketed the AVS as a full home computer, with an included keyboard, cassette data recorder, and a BASIC interpreter software cartridge. The BASIC interpreter would later be sold together with a keyboard as the Family BASIC package, and the cassette deck for data storage would later be released as the Famicom Data Recorder. The AVS also included a variety of computer-style input devices: gamepads, a handheld joystick, a musical keyboard, and the Zapper light gun. The AVS Zapper is hinged, allowing it <b>to</b> <b>straighten</b> <b>out</b> into a wand form, or bend into a gun form. The AVS uses a wireless infrared interface for all its components, including keyboard, cassette deck, and controllers. Most of the peripherals for the Advanced Video System are {{on display at the}} Nintendo World Store. The toy-like white-and-red color scheme of the Famicom was replaced with a clean and futuristic grey monochrome design, with the top and bottom portions in different shades, a stripe with black and ribbing along the top, and minor red accents. The AVS also features a boxier design than the Famicom: flat on top, and a bottom half that tapered down to a smaller footprint. The front of the main unit features a compartment for storing the wireless controllers out of sight. Its software carries the Nintendo Seal of Quality to communicate the company's approval.|$|E

500|$|Congress in August 1964 {{passed an}} {{appropriation}} {{intended to be}} used for striking 45 million silver dollars. [...] The Senate Majority Leader, Mike Mansfield, was from hard-money Montana and insisted on the Mint proceeding. [...] The Mint struck over 300,000 of them, bearing the Peace dollar design and the date 1964, in May 1965 but due to a public outcry that the coins would only be hoarded, they were melted. [...] The minting had been at the direction of President Lyndon Johnson; the subsequent flip-flop on the question left Nevada Senator Alan Bible, a prominent supporter of the mining industry, unimpressed with the administration's leadership on coin matters, feeling officials were leaving the mess for Congress <b>to</b> <b>straighten</b> <b>out.</b> He introduced legislation to outlaw hoarding, export, and melting of U.S. coins, but the bill went nowhere.|$|E
500|$|From {{the nineteenth}} century, Ampezzo became a notable {{regional}} centre for crafts. The growing {{importance of this}} sector led the Austrian Ministry of Commerce to authorize {{the opening of a}} State Industrial School in 1874, which later became the Art Institute. It became a reputable institution in teaching wood and metal work, admitted boys from the age of 13 and up to four years of study. The local handmade products were appreciated by early British and German holidaymakers as tourism emerged late nineteenth century. Some of the local items were said to have mythical qualities; the Austrian journalist and anthropologist Karl Felix Wolff, for example, stated in 1935 that according to legend a local man [...] "once made a sword that was so flexible that you could bend it over, tie it up, and then allow it <b>to</b> <b>straighten</b> <b>out</b> again". Among the specializations of the town were crafting wood for furniture, the production of tiled stoves and iron, copper and glass items.|$|E
500|$|In 1947, Grant {{played an}} artist who becomes {{involved}} in a court case when charged with assault in The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer, opposite Myrna Loy and Shirley Temple. The film was praised by the critics, who admired the picture's slapstick qualities and chemistry between Grant and Loy; it {{became one of the}} biggest-selling films at the box office that year. Later that year he starred opposite David Niven and Loretta Young in the comedy The Bishop's Wife, playing an angel who is sent down from heaven <b>to</b> <b>straighten</b> <b>out</b> the relationship between the bishop (Niven) and his wife (Loretta Young). The film was a major commercial and critical success, and was nominated for five Academy Awards. Life magazine called it [...] "intelligently written and competently acted". The following year, Grant played neurotic Jim Blandings, the title-sake in the comedy Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House, again with Loy. Though the film picture lost {{a lot of money for}} RKO, Philip T. Hartung of Commonweal thought that Grant's role as the [...] "frustrated advertising man" [...] was one of his best screen portrayals. In Every Girl Should Be Married, an [...] "airy comedy", he appeared with Betsy Drake and Franchot Tone, playing a bachelor who is trapped into marriage by Drake's conniving character. He finished the year as the fourth most popular film star at the box office.|$|E

500|$|Corporal Burdett later stated, [...] "When McCudden {{took off}} {{he put the}} machine into a nearly {{vertical}} climb, seemed to do a half-roll and then nosed dived into a wood.....it was usual for scout pilots to perform some little stunt.....I {{think that is what}} he was doing." [...] Witness Lieutenant L.M Fenton had a different view, [...] "the aircraft took off into wind and at about 100 feet did a vertical turn and flew back across the aerodrome {{by the side of the}} wood. The engine appeared to be running badly. The pilot rolled the machine, which failed <b>to</b> <b>straighten</b> <b>out,</b> at approximately 200 feet. It crashed nose down into the wood." [...] Lieutenant E.M Greenwood stated he thought the crash was the result of a failed aerobatic manoeuvre: [...] "I was watching an S.E.5 flying over the aerodrome at about 200 feet, when it did one complete roll to the right, then dived steeply to the ground behind the trees." [...] Lieutenant K.V King believed a similar thing: [...] "......very low over the aerodrome, going east towards the wood on the south-east side of the aerodrome. He had apparently been rolling. I saw him nose down and engine off entering the trees and immediately afterwards heard a crash." [...] Lieutenant [...] T.H Barry, though supports the notion that something was amiss with the engine:"I saw an S.E.5 flying from west to east across the aerodrome at 200–300 feet. The engine was firing irregularly. Just after crossing the end of the aerodrome the pilot did a sharp stalling turn. The nose dropped and it dived behind the trees. During this dive the noise of the engine ceased." ...|$|E
