5|$|Boise State {{came into}} the game {{averaging}} 42.75points and 475.67yards per game, the fourth and twelfth highest totals in college football. Senior quarterback Taylor Tharp led the offense by more than 3,000yards and 28 touchdowns, headed into the 2007 Hawaii Bowl. On the ground, the Broncos were led by junior running back Ian Johnson, who had 17touchdowns and 1,030yards in the regular season. Wide receiver Jeremy Childs also was a potent threat on offense, averaging 87.08receiving yards per game, and backup running back D.J. Harper rushed for 41.44yards per game on average. Johnson and Childs both earned First Team All-WAC honors, and Tharp was named to Second Team All-WAC. Offensive tackle Ryan Clady was the team's only All-American, and promised <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> protecting Taylor Tharp on the offensive line.|$|E

I {{understand that there}} is speculation, but some day justice will be done there, too.” Victoria also gave her opinion that happiness is important, and that these days {{it is not so much}} about background and pedigree but about two people who have to live with each other. She said that if they are not happy and comfortable with each other, it is impossible <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>job.</b>|$|E

Christopher Hitchens of Vanity Fair called her nomination a ludicrous embarrassment on the edition of November 18, 2008 of Hardball due to the Clintons' overseas connections, her actions during the 2008 Democratic Presidential Primary. Senator John Cornyn (R-Texas) voted against a unanimous voice approval, citing ethical concerns. He sought not to block the nomination through a filibuster, but to voice his opposition to her policies. Senator David Vitter (R-Louisiana) also voted against Clinton in Committee citing her husband's foreign donations for his non-profit entities.|$|E

500|$|Based on the {{positive}} response he had received in San Francisco, MGM again cast Tracy as a priest in Boys Town (1938). Portraying Edward J. Flanagan, a Catholic priest and founder of Boys Town, was a role Tracy took seriously: [...] "I'm so anxious <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> as Father Flanagan that it worries me, keeps me awake at night." [...] Tracy received strong reviews for his performance, and the movie grossed $4 million worldwide. For the second year running, Tracy received an Academy Award for Best Actor. He was humble about the recognition, saying in his acceptance speech: [...] "I honestly {{do not feel that}} I can accept this award... I can accept it only as {{it was meant to be}} for a great man—Father Flanagan". He immediately sent the Academy Award statuette to Flanagan. Tracy was listed as the fifth biggest money-making star of 1938.|$|E
500|$|The Blackstone was {{managed by}} Harry J. Powers, a Chicago {{businessman}} with {{extensive experience in}} the theatre: [...] he had {{worked his way up}} from his early days as an usher to ultimately become one of Mr. Erlanger's most trusted associated; Powers remained as the Blackstone's manager throughout its first two decades. [...] The Blackstone's first productions featured some of that era's best known performers and playwrights—for example, after [...] "U.S. Minister Bedloe" [...] came a David Belasco production, [...] "The Return of Peter Grimm", starring David Warfield. [...] Many of the productions had already been well received in New York before coming to the Blackstone, such as another play that featured comic actor William H. Crane, [...] "The Senator Keeps House." [...] But while some of these productions were the equal of the version that played in New York, Tribune theatre critic Hammond observed on several occasions that the Chicago companies lacked the biggest stars. Despite this, the touring companies that performed at the Blackstone tended <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> and Hammond praised them for their [...] "effective" [...] productions. This trend of presenting touring company versions would continue in later years, when most of the performances at the Blackstone were plays which had already won the Pulitzer Prize or the Tony Award, and were presented by touring companies from New York.|$|E
500|$|Boyd is {{generally}} deployed as a winger, {{and has been}} used on the left-wing throughout {{the majority of his}} career. He has described himself as a winger, but has stated that he prefers to play [...] "in the hole" [...] because the position allows him to get more time on the ball. He has expressed his willingness to [...] "play anywhere" [...] to help the team, believing his versatility across the midfield and attacking areas to be one of his main strong-points. He said [...] "I have played {{on both sides of the}} park and will always try my best <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> regardless of where the manager plays me". Under former Peterborough United manager, Jim Gannon, Boyd was given a [...] "free-role", essentially playing across the midfield and behind the strikers. Gannon said [...] "if we can get him free in attacking areas he can be a great creative force". Gannon believes that Boyd is at his best when he [...] "is saved from doing defensive work that wingers may have to do", and as a result, during Gannon's short spell at Peterborough, was deployed just behind the strikers as part of a 3–4–1–2 formation. Boyd has also been used as a striker by manager Mark Stimson during the first half of Stevenage's 2006–07 campaign. He is predominantly left-footed, and scores the majority of his goals with his left-foot, but is also comfortable using his right. Kieran Trippier, Boyd's teammate at Burnley, said of Boyd: [...] "He's great to play with, with a good left foot and a great engine".|$|E

2500|$|The {{decision}} was also criticized {{because of the}} popular stereotype that female opera singers have to be heavy anyway, in order <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>job.</b> There is the old expression that [...] "in opera, great voices often come in large packages". and the well-worn saying about opera that [...] "It ain't over till the fat lady sings". She was headlined in the British tabloid press as [...] "The show ain't over till the fat lady slims." [...] There was also an outcry because, it seemed at the time, that high culture performing arts, such as opera, should not emulate low culture Hollywood images of thin female stars.|$|E

2500|$|While Public Law 689 {{authorized}} {{the creation of}} the WR, it also prohibited its members from serving outside the continental United States. This impediment changed on 27September 1944, when Public Law 441 amended 689 to allow WR members to serve in the Territory of Hawaii. Some thought the enactment of Public Law 441 was anticlimactic. Director Streeter believed that sending WR members to Hawaii [...] "was not worth all the trouble and cost". Nevertheless, the Marine Corps did deploy women to Hawaii. Hawaiian duty was on a volunteer basis. Many members applied, but only the very best of them were accepted. The requirements were stringent, inasmuch as the members had to have been on active duty for at least six months; commit to an 18-month tour; have a clean record; be in excellent mental and physical health; agree not to request leave to visit the mainland, and verify they had no dependents whose care might necessitate a trip back to the states. In addition, members were expected to have a stable personality, sufficient skill to fill one of the billets for which women had been requested, and motivation <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>job.</b> San Diego, California, became the staging area, where a short yet intense physical conditioning course was given. The first contingent of women arrived in Hawaii on 28January 1945. At mid-year, there were about 1,000 women serving in Hawaii. By January 1946, they were all back in the states.|$|E
