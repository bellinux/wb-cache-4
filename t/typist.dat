5|$|At {{the age of}} 14, O'Hara {{joined the}} Abbey Theatre. Though she was mentored by playwright Lennox Robinson, she found her time at the theatre disappointing. In 1934, {{at the age of}} 15, she won the first Dramatic Prize of the {{national}} competition of the performing arts, the Dublin Feis Award, for her performance as Portia in The Merchant of Venice. She trained as a shorthand <b>typist,</b> working for Crumlin Laundry before joining Eveready Battery Company, where she worked as a <b>typist</b> and bookkeeper. She later put her skills to use when she typed the script of The Quiet Man for John Ford.|$|E
5|$|In 1943, at 83 {{years of}} age, Burnham married his much younger <b>typist,</b> Ilo K. Willits Burnham (June 20, 1894 â€“ August 28, 1982). The couple sold their mansion {{and moved to}} Santa Barbara in 1946.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} Excelsior High School in 1929, she {{attended}} Fullerton Junior College. She {{paid for her}} education by working odd jobs, including as a driver, a pharmacy manager, a telephone operator, and a <b>typist.</b> She also earned money sweeping the floors of a local bank, and from 1930 until 1932, she lived in New York City, working as a secretary and Radiographer.|$|E
50|$|During 1933, Dvorak started {{entering}} <b>typists</b> {{trained on}} his keyboard into the International Commercial Schools Contest, which were typing contests sponsored by typewriter manufacturers consisting of professional and amateur contests. The professional contests had <b>typists</b> sponsored by typewriter companies to advertise their machines. Additionally, QWERTY <b>typists</b> {{did not want}} to be placed near Dvorak <b>typists</b> because QWERTY <b>typists</b> were disconcerted by the noise produced from the fast typing speeds made by Dvorak <b>typists.</b>|$|R
50|$|With {{the advent}} of the {{typewriter}} in the late nineteenth century, <b>typists</b> adopted approximations of standard spacing practices to fit the limitations of the typewriter itself. French <b>typists</b> used a single space between sentences, consistent with the typeset French spacing technique, whereas English <b>typists</b> used a double space.|$|R

5|$|After {{graduating from}} high school, Kavner {{attended}} San Diego State University and majored in drama, being cast in several productions including a role as Charlotte Corday in Marat/Sade, becoming known for her improvisation and ability to do both comedy and drama. After graduating in 1971, she got a day job as a <b>typist</b> at the UCLA School of the Arts and Architecture.|$|E
5|$|Rand began The Fountainhead (originally titled Second-Hand Lives) {{following}} {{the completion of}} her first novel, We the Living, in 1934. That earlier novel was {{based in part on}} people and events familiar to Rand; the new novel, on the other hand, focused on the less-familiar world of architecture. She therefore conducted extensive research that included reading many biographies and other books about architecture. She also worked as an unpaid <b>typist</b> in the office of architect Ely Jacques Kahn. Rand began her notes for the new novel in December 1935.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Edison's British headquarters, Edison House, was {{situated}} on the road. Several prominent personalities of the late 19th century had their voices recorded there by phonograph, including Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone and poet Robert Browning. Mary Helen Ferguson, the first English female audio <b>typist,</b> worked at Edison House and supervised all musical recordings. In 1890, retired military trumpeter Martin Lanfried recorded at Edison House using a bugle he {{believed to have been}} sounded at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 and the Charge of the Light Brigade in 1854.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} to {{what extent}} different sources of information are used in typing on a computer keyboard. Using self-reports 10 finger <b>typists</b> and idiosyncratic <b>typists</b> estimated how much attention they pay to different sources of information during copy typing and free typing {{and how much they}} use them for error detection. 10 finger <b>typists</b> reported less attention to the keyboard and the fingers and more attention to the template and the screen than idiosyncratic <b>typists.</b> The groups did not differ in attention to touch/kinaesthesis in copy typing and free typing, but 10 finger <b>typists</b> reported more use of touch/kinaesthesis in error detection. This indicates that processing of tactile/kinaesthetic information may occur largely outside conscious control, as long as no errors occur. 10 finger <b>typists</b> reported more use of internal prediction of movement consequences for error detection than idiosyncratic <b>typists,</b> reflecting more precise internal models. Further in copy typing compared to free typing attention to the template is required, thus leaving less attentional capacity for other sources of information. Correlations showed that higher skilled <b>typists,</b> regardless of typing style, rely more on sources of information which are usually associated with 10 finger typing. One limitation of the study is that only self-reports were used. We conclude that typing task, typing proficiency, and typing style influence how attention is distributed during typing...|$|R
40|$|The {{influences}} of typing style and action familiarity on executed and imagined typing were investigated. A group of touch <b>typists</b> {{and a group}} of hunt-and-peck <b>typists</b> were asked to imagine and execute typing texts of different lengths in two different styles: with ten fingers (familiar for touch <b>typists,</b> unfamiliar for hunt-and-peck <b>typists)</b> and with two fingers (unfamiliar for touch <b>typists,</b> familiar for hunt-and-peck <b>typists).</b> The imagination (but not the execution) of familiar and unfamiliar typing was correlated in both groups, indicating that participants used skill knowledge from the familiar action to imagine the unfamiliar action. Only when touch <b>typists</b> imagined familiar typing accurate motor imagery was observed (similar durations of and positive correlations between imagination and execution). When touch <b>typists</b> imagined unfamiliar typing, the average imagination durations resembled the execution durations, but correlations indicated individual differences in the processes of imagination and execution. Hunt-and-peck <b>typists</b> showed shorter imagination than execution durations with both familiar and unfamiliar typing, indicating that in both styles they did not imagine all details of typing. Also, they did not imagine some details specifically related to unfamiliar typing (reflected in particularly high percentages of absolute error). However, correlations indicated that individual difficulties in executing the unfamiliar action were reflected in the imagination durations. In conclusion, skill knowledge from familiar actions is used to imagine unfamiliar actions. Familiarity with actions promotes accurate motor imagery, but only if stable internal action representations have been acquired, and not if action control relies on online, step-by-step control. However, stable internal action representations of familiar actions may be detrimental for imagery of unfamiliar actions...|$|R
5|$|Born in Ely, Nevada, {{she grew}} up with her two {{brothers}} {{in what is now}} Cerritos, California, graduating from high school in 1929. She attended Fullerton Junior College and later the University of Southern California. She paid for her schooling by working multiple jobs, including pharmacy manager, <b>typist,</b> radiographer, and retail clerk. In 1940, she married lawyer Richard Nixon and they had two daughters. Nixon campaigned for her husband in his successful congressional campaigns of 1946 and 1948. Richard Nixon was elected Vice President in the Eisenhower administration, whereupon Pat undertook many missions of goodwill with her husband and gained favorable media coverage. She assisted her husband in both his unsuccessful 1960 presidential campaign and later in his successful 1968 presidential campaign.|$|E
5|$|Ernest {{believed}} he could communicate with both extraterrestrials and historical figures, channeling messages from them. In 1954, seeking to popularize his channeling, Ernest and Ruth formed an organization known as Unarius, operating {{from their home in}} California. After their marriage, Ruth served as Ernest's <b>typist,</b> later claiming to have learned the skill while sleeping. She recorded the information he channeled, writing books about psychic healing and trips into the solar system. In the 1950s and 1960s, they attracted several followers, including two students whom they later taught to channel. One early trainee was Charles Spiegel, who later led the group. Many converts had previous involvement with New Age or mystic groups, making it easy for the Normans to convert them.|$|E
5|$|Indeed, when {{financial}} circumstances forced Manning {{to leave}} school at sixteen, {{she worked as}} a <b>typist,</b> and spent some time as a junior in a beauty salon. A talented artist, she took evening classes at the Portsmouth Municipal School of Art, where a fellow student described her as intellectual and aloof. In May 1928, she had a painting selected for an exhibition at Southsea, and was subsequently offered a one-woman show of her works. Manning seemed to be poised for a career as an artist, but she had meanwhile continued her interest in literature, and at the age of twenty determined instead to be a writer. Her artist's eye is apparent in her later intense descriptions of landscapes.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are many}} {{idiosyncratic}} typing styles in between novice-style [...] "hunt and peck" [...] and touch typing. For example, many [...] "hunt and peck" [...] <b>typists</b> have the keyboard layout memorized {{and are able}} to type while focusing their gaze on the screen. One study examining 30 subjects, of varying different styles and expertise, has found minimal difference in typing speed between touch <b>typists</b> and self-taught hybrid <b>typists.</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{the current}} experiment, we {{compared}} sequence learning after either motor imagery or physical practice {{to determine how}} learning differs {{as a function of}} expertise. During familiarization, both novices and experts typed a series of 4 -digit numbers and were given an immediate typing test, which included both old and new numbers. Next, all subjects practiced typing either physically or mentally with either the same hand or the opposite hand. Finally, all subjects were given a delayed typing test, again, which included both old and new numbers. In terms of retention, unskilled <b>typists</b> benefited more from motor imagery than did skilled <b>typists,</b> and no retroactive interference was found after physical practice for either skilled or unskilled <b>typists.</b> In terms of transfer, all subjects benefited from motor imagery and unskilled <b>typists</b> showed as much transfer as skilled <b>typists.</b> These results suggest that mental practice and physical practice both predict learning...|$|R

5|$|From January 1918 to January 1921 Poulenc was a conscript in the French Army in {{the last}} months of the First World War and the {{immediate}} post-war period. Between July and October 1918 he served at the Franco-German front, after which he was given a series of auxiliary posts, ending as a <b>typist</b> at the Ministry of Aviation. His duties allowed him time for composition; the Trois mouvements perpÃ©tuels for piano and the Sonata for Piano Duet were written at the piano of the local elementary school at Saint-Martin-sur-le-PrÃ©, and he completed his first song cycle, Le bestiaire, setting poems by Apollinaire. The sonata did not create a deep public impression, but the song cycle made the composer's name known in France, and the Trois mouvements perpÃ©tuels rapidly became an international success. The exigencies of music-making in wartime taught Poulenc much about writing for whatever instruments were available; then, and later, some of his works were for unusual combinations of players.|$|E
5|$|In 1938, GÃ¶ring was {{involved}} in the Blombergâ€“Fritsch Affair, which led to the resignations of the War Minister, Field Marshal Werner von Blomberg, and the army commander, General Werner von Fritsch. GÃ¶ring had acted as witness at Blomberg's wedding to Margarethe Gruhn, a 26-year-old <b>typist,</b> on 12 January 1938. Information received from the police showed that the young bride was a prostitute. GÃ¶ring felt obligated to tell Hitler, but also saw this event as an opportunity to dispose of the field marshal. Blomberg was forced to resign. GÃ¶ring did not want Fritsch to be appointed to that position and thus be his superior. Several days later, Heydrich revealed a file on Fritsch that contained allegations of homosexual activity and blackmail. The charges were later proven to be false, but Fritsch had lost Hitler's trust and was forced to resign. Hitler used the dismissals as an opportunity to reshuffle the leadership of the military. GÃ¶ring asked for the post of War Minister, but was turned down; he was appointed to the rank of field marshal. Hitler took over as supreme commander of the armed forces and created subordinate posts to head the three main branches of service.|$|E
5|$|Ranked {{lieutenant}} in the Permanent Military Force (PMF), Pollard was appointed adjutant/quartermaster of the 17th Battalion (Citizens Military Forces), headquartered at North Sydney, in July 1925. He married Daisy Ethel Potter, a <b>typist,</b> at St Andrew's Anglican Church, Strathfield, on 31 October; The Bathurst Times reported that Daisy cut the cake with her husband's Sword of Honour. Pollard departed for India on attachment to the British Army in September 1927, serving with the Royal Fusiliers and the York and Lancaster Regiment. He returned to Sydney in November the following year and was posted as adjutant/quartermaster to, successively, the 18th Battalion (CMF) and, in September 1932, the 44th Battalion (CMF). In December 1932, while serving with the 44th in Western Australia, {{he was promoted to}} captain. Pollard was camp commandant of the National Rifle Association of Western Australia from 1934 to 1936. He was transferred to Army Headquarters, Melbourne, in October 1936. His next posting, in July 1938, was as General Staff Officer Grade3, Training and General Duties, at the 2nd District Base, Sydney. In November 1938, Pollard travelled to England to attend Staff College, Camberley; he graduated in September 1939, the planned two-year course having been curtailed owing to the outbreak of the Second World War.|$|E
