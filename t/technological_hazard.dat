40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} spatial {{distributions}} of four types of <b>technological</b> <b>hazards</b> in the Phoenix, Arizona, metropolitan area. The {{focus is on the}} locations of hazardous industrial and toxic waste sites in relation to the demographic composition of adjacent neighborhoods. Our interest is to determine whether hazardous sites, including industrial facilities in the EPA's Toxic Release Inventory, Large Quantity Generators of hazardous wastes, Treatment, Storage, and Disposal Facilities, and federally identified contamination sites, are disproportionately located in areas with lower income and minority residents. We examine patterns of environmental inequity in Phoenix, a sprawling Sunbelt city with a growing post-Fordist industrial sector. First, using 1996 EPA data for four types of <b>technological</b> <b>hazards,</b> and 1995 Special Census data for Maricopa County, we employ a GIS to map the spatial distributions of hazardous sites and to analyze the demographic characteristics of census tracts with and without point-source hazards. A second methodology is used to produce a cumulative hazard density index for census tracts, {{based on the number of}} hazard zones [...] one-mile-radius circles around each facility [...] that overlay each tract. Both methodologies disclose clear patterns of social inequities in the distribution of <b>technological</b> <b>hazards.</b> The cumulative hazard density index provides a spatially sensitive methodology that reveals the disproportionate distribution of risk burdens in urban census tracts.

The work builds on facility siting and risk perception literatures. The paper describes the findings from a telephone survey conducted in Swan Hills Alberta (n= 173). The survey itself was designed from the analysis of almost 38 in-depth interviews in the same community. Swan Hills shows a relatively high percentage of residents who are relatively unconcerned about the facility (69 %). Four potential explanations of low concern are tested: sound management, economic and other benefits, sound facility siting, and insider reactions to outsiders. The insider/outsider dichotomy and benefits to community well-being {{prove to be the}} only statistically significant predictors of general facility concern.

40|$|Recently, {{there is}} an {{increasing}} rate of environmental pollution cases reported, and that {{is closely related to}} <b>technological</b> <b>hazard.</b> Environmental monitoring (EM) is an approach to detect environmental risk before it develops into a disaster. Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) is an important concept in reducing the impacts of hazards and disasters to social, economy and environment, especially at a regional level. Biosensors have been developed to detect pollutants and hazardous chemicals that are frequently and potentially found in the environment as a result of anthropogenic activity and as part of the natural phenomena. Efforts are focus in developing biosensors that are applicable in EM, some suggested biosensors could replace the conventional chemical analytical methods, but not all of them are practical. To evaluate the feasibility of biosensors in assisting EM in DRR, an analysis of articles published on biosensors in related field was carried out. Based on the evaluation, we concluded five major aspects to be considered when biosensors are to be applied as an early warning system tool in DRR at regional level, namely complexity of real sample, need of continuous environmental monitoring data, reproducibility of data, on-site testing and roles in risk characterization. This paper will help in the assessment of the applicability of biosensor in EM and as part in the DRR, and also as a guide to designing biosensor for EM purposes...|$|E

40|$|The role {{of culture}} in the {{geography}} of health and <b>technological</b> <b>hazard</b> perception research is an important and relatively recent avenue of research. This dissertation contributes to this research by exploring cross-cultural differences in health and risk perceptions and by examining the relationship between health and place. It involves an in-depth examination of perceptions and meaning of health, as they exist in the local context. It is the first geographical research conducted with individual members of the Old Order Mennonite community considering perceptions of health, <b>technological</b> <b>hazard</b> and understandings of environmental risk. The studied communities are situated at an agricultural/industrial interface near Kitchener-Waterloo, Ontario. For {{the last twenty years}} the town of Elmira and its surrounding agricultural lands {{have been the subject of}} environmental concerns due to the area’s extended exposure to toxic wastes, produced during the manufacture of rubber, highly toxic herbicides and pesticides. These pose significant health risks to the local populations especially to members of the Old Order Mennonite community whose farms are located along the most contaminated tributary of the Grand River in close proximity to Elmira. In the research, perception of health, risk and environment are examined in 48 in-depth interviews involving the Old Order Mennonites, women frmo the mainstream society living in Elmira, and professional and key health informants. The thesis provides contributions to the research of health geography. Health conceptualizations and health understandings are compared among the groups to reveal culturally-constructed experiences in the local landscapes. Various perceptions of people’s well-being in place are explored by incorporating the religious beliefs and associated cultural practices of Old Order Mennonites. Cultural, ethnic and religious isolation of the Old Order Mennonites and their concerns about maintaining strict traditions have contributed to their unique understandings of health in place. Contrasting understandings of local landscapes are presented, the landscape of mainstream society and the therapeutic landscape of the Old Order Mennonites. In this study, the Old Order Mennonites women are found to be empowered by the religious and cultural differences that sustain their different holistic understandings of their health landscape. The thesis provides contributions to geography of environmental risk research. Drawing on the social amplification of risk framework (SARF) developed by Kasperson, Renn, Slovic, and their colleagues (1992), a study framework is proposed to reveal how cultural beliefs and practices and religious values contextualize responses to technological hazards. Incorporated in the framework are four categories of cultural processes (threats to lives, core values, worldviews and community context) through which the meanings of risk are either amplified or attenuated among the groups. The study proposes a way of unpacking the black box of culture by using a qualitative based explanation of the dimension of culture that influence risk perceptions. In summary, the thesis highlights different perspectives on children’s and women’s health and risk associated with participant ethnicity. From a practical perspective, it informs public health and environmental risk management decision makers of the importance of cultural differences which need to be addressed to reduce inequalities existing in the Elmira area...|$|E
40|$|U članku se iznose rezultati sociologijskog istraživanja reakcija na hazardne situacije i stanja prikupljeni u sklopu projekta »Socijalnoekološki aspekti razvoja« u lipnju 1992. godine na uzorku od 547 studenata Zagrebačkog i Riječkog sveučilišta. Emocionalne reakcije ispitivane su samoprocjenom stupnja strahovanja ispitanika u odnosu na niz ponuđenih stanja i situacija, a dobiveni rezultati upozoravaju na relativno veću učestalost strahovanja prema socijalnim i tehnološkim u usporedbi s prirodnim hazardima. Latentna struktura dobivenih samoprocjena sastoji se od triju dimenzija: strah od prirodnih katastrofa, strah od bolesti, strah od budućnosti. Kognitivne reakcije, odnosno percepciju opasnih stanja pokušali smo ustanoviti na temelju prosudbi stupnja opasnosti pojedinih hazardnih situacija i stanja. Rezultati upućuju na relativnu postojanost prosudbi ponuđenih sadržaja u odnosu na neka ranije provedena istraživanja. Pokušaj rekonstrukcije latentnih dimenzija percepcije opasnih stanja rezultirao je ekstrakcijom četiriju dimenzija: opasnosti od tehnoloških postrojenja, opasnosti od nuklearnih postrojenja, opasnosti od konvencionalnih zagađivača, prometne opasnosti. The article {{discloses}} {{the results}} of sociological research on the reactions to the hazard incident situations and states gathered for the project „Social and Environmental Aspects of Development“ for which the investigation was made on the sample of 547 students of Zagreb and Rijeka Universities. Emotional reactions have been studied through self-evaluation {{of the degree of}} the examined people 2 ̆ 7 s fear in a number of offered situations and states; the obtained results point to the relatively greater frequency of fears of social and <b>technological</b> <b>hazard</b> incidents than of the natural disasters. The latent structure of the obtained evaluations can be said to be three dimensional: fear of natural disasters, fear of diseases and fear of the future. There is an attempt to establish the cognitive reactions, i. e. the perception of dangerous states, {{on the basis of the}} estimation of the degree of danger particular hazard situations and states invoke. The results are pointing to the relative permanence of the evaluation of the offered situations with regards to some earlier research results. Trying to reconstruct the latent dimensions of the perception of dangerous situations resulted in the extraction of four dimensions: danger from technology applied in construction of plants, danger of nuclear plants, danger of conventional pollution sources, danger in traffic.

40|$|The {{population}} density in the EU is rather high, and buildings, industrial and agricultural activities practically spread over {{almost all the}} accessible areas. However, rather large portions of the land where people live, work or travel are submitted to not negligible risks, from natural and/or technological origin; moreover, in most areas different natural and/or technological risk sources are simultaneously present. Different land use planning criteria may be adopted depending on the specific risk source under exam: in most cases, {{for each type of}} development (industrial area, residential area, etc.) and/or activity (parking lot, school, etc.) proper safety distances from the risk source(s) are established, according to experience, or deriving from a “consequence based” or a “risk based” approach. When the area is also subject to some natural hazards (for example, earthquakes, or floods), more restrictive construction standards, or additional safety distances, may be required. In practice, any development in the “vicinity” of one or more Seveso establishments (i. e. those where a major accident may occur) should separately respect all the provisions enforced for any natural and/or <b>technological</b> <b>hazard</b> in the area. However, a land use planning policy based on risk maps relevant to single risk sources may result in an insufficient protection when both natural and technological risk sources are simultaneously present. In fact, the different risk sources may interact causing an increase in the overall risk level, due to various types of domino effects: for example, {{it is well known that}} natural disasters may trigger industrial accidents, originating na-tech (natural-technological) events. It is obvious that, in order to establish sound criteria for land use planning, all the risks in a given area should be accurately assessed: the arrangement of a comprehensive risk map would be extremely useful, but maps of this type cannot be easily obtained. In fact, generally, risk maps use specific risk measures depending on the involved phenomenon, making it very difficult to sum risks deriving from different sources and to get an effective picture of the overall risk in the area. As a matter of fact, for most natural hazards (earthquakes, floods, etc.), risk maps show some specific risk index, or indicate the expected intensity of the phenomenon, or locate the area interested by the phenomenon; in some cases, maps are referred to given time intervals between two subsequent occurrence of the same phenomenon (the so-called return time). Therefore, directly obtaining risk maps accounting for a number of different natural phenomena is practically impossible. As far as technological hazards are concerned, individual risk maps are often used, where the risk at any location is estimated based on the expected frequency of occurrence of some “top events” associated to the industrial activity under exam (process plant, transport of hazardous materials, etc.) and on the extension of the impact areas where the consequence of such top events may cause fatalities. In this case, due to the uniformity of the used risk measure, it is rather simple to obtain overall risk maps taking into account technological risks of different origin. Despite of the problems described above, a “risk based” approach appears largely preferable than a “consequence based” one in order to properly address land use planning in the presence of different types of hazards. In fact, the former takes into due account also the expected frequency of such catastrophes, which, in most case, assumes very low values. Nevertheless, the adoption of a “risk based” approach would require some homogeneous “risk measure”, which should be conveniently applied to assess the risk associated to any type of risk sources, to be defined. This paper discusses the possibility of defining a risk index, i. e. a quantitative measure of the risk, based on the information usually available for different natural and technological risk sources, and shows an application where this risk index is used to obtain individual and global risk maps of an area including both technological and natural risk source...|$|E
