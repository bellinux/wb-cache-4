5|$|While {{the global}} {{financial}} system is edging <b>toward</b> <b>greater</b> stability, governments must deal with differing regional or national needs. Some nations are trying to orderly discontinue unconventional monetary policies installed to cultivate recovery, while others are expanding their scope and scale. Emerging market policymakers face a challenge of precision as they must carefully institute sustainable macroeconomic policies during extraordinary market sensitivity without provoking investors to retreat their capital to stronger markets. Nations' inability to align interests and achieve international consensus on matters such as banking regulation has perpetuated the risk of future global financial catastrophes.|$|E

25|$|China, due {{in large}} part to {{environmental}} concerns, has wanted to shift China's current energy mix from a heavy reliance on coal, which accounts for 70–75% of China's energy, <b>toward</b> <b>greater</b> reliance on oil, natural gas, renewable energy, and nuclear power. China has closed thousands of coal mines over the past five to ten years to cut overproduction. According to Chinese statistics, this has reduced coal production by over 25%.|$|E

25|$|Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and {{transgender}} (LGBT) {{characters have}} been depicted in some video games since the 1980s. LGBT content has {{been subject to}} changing rules and regulations by game companies. These rules are generally examples of heterosexism in that heterosexuality is normalized while homosexuality is subject to additional censorship or ridicule. Sexual orientation and gender identity were significant in some console and PC games, with the trend being <b>toward</b> <b>greater</b> visibility of LGBT identities, particularly in Japanese popular culture and games marketed to LGBT consumers.|$|E
25|$|With the spectre {{of foreign}} {{influence}} over the strike thus removed, negotiations began, and the strike ended in early July. Labor leaders who {{had been accused of}} having ties with Guatemala were jailed, and the final settlement, which met few of the original demands, was signed with elements more acceptable to the government and the fruit companies than to the workers. Despite the limited gains, however, the strike did mark a major step <b>toward</b> <b>greater</b> influence for organized labor in Honduras and a decline {{in the power of the}} fruit companies.|$|E
25|$|This new idiom, {{combined}} with a study of 19th-century French poetry, {{formed the basis of}} American input into 20th-century English-language poetic modernism. Ezra Pound (1885–1972) and T. S. Eliot (1888–1965) were the leading figures at the time, with their rejection of traditional poetic form and meter and of Victorian diction. Both steered American poetry <b>toward</b> <b>greater</b> density, difficulty, and opacity, with an emphasis on techniques such as fragmentation, ellipsis, allusion, juxtaposition, ironic and shifting personae, and mythic parallelism. Pound, in particular, opened up American poetry to diverse influences, including the traditional poetries of China and Japan.|$|E

25|$|Rastafari espouses patriarchal principles, and {{promotes}} the idea that women should submit to male leadership. External observers—including scholars like Edmonds—have claimed that Rastafari accords women an inferior position to men. Rasta discourse often presents women as morally weak and susceptible to deception by evil, and claims that they are impure during their period of menstruation. Rastafari mirrored the views on gender which were common in Jamaican society more broadly; however, it has retained its commitment to patriarchy while Jamaican society has moved <b>toward</b> <b>greater</b> gender equity. Rastas legitimise these gender roles by citing Biblical passages, particularly those in the Book of Leviticus, and {{in the writings of}} Paul the Apostle.|$|E
25|$|Although several Eastern bloc {{countries}} had attempted some abortive, limited {{economic and political}} reform since the 1950s (e.g. the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 and Prague Spring of 1968), the ascension of reform-minded Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in 1985 signaled the trend <b>toward</b> <b>greater</b> liberalization. During the mid-1980s, a younger generation of Soviet apparatchiks, led by Gorbachev, began advocating fundamental reform in order to reverse years of Brezhnev stagnation. After decades of growth, the Soviet Union was now facing a period of severe economic decline and needed Western technology and credits {{to make up for}} its increasing backwardness. The costs of maintaining its military, the KGB, subsidies to foreign client states etc., further strained the moribund Soviet economy.|$|E
25|$|While {{the methods}} behind {{collecting}} bite mark {{evidence at the}} scene are leading <b>toward</b> <b>greater</b> standardization, the methodology behind analyzing bite marks is extremely variable because it depends upon the preference of the specific odontologist. As discussed earlier, there are several methods used to compare bite marks ranging from life sized photographs to computer enhanced 3-dimensional imaging. These methods vary in precision and accuracy, {{and there is no}} set standard by which to compare or analyze them. The lack of analytical standards leads to a wide array of interpretation with any bite mark evidence. Some odontologists even disagree on whether or not a mark on the body {{is the result of a}} bite. Therefore, the interpretation of evidence lies largely on the expertise of the forensic odontologist handling the case.|$|E

25|$|In the 1960s, {{the farm}} equipment, {{construction}} equipment, and heavy electrical industries {{were not as}} profitable for Allis-Chalmers {{as they had been}} in the 1930s through 1950s. Reasonable prosperity continued in the farm equipment line, but the economics of all the industries shifted <b>toward</b> <b>greater</b> uncertainty and brittler success for firms that didn't become number one or two in a field. Allis-Chalmers was often number three or four, as Deere and International Harvester led in farm machinery, Caterpillar and Case led in construction, and Westinghouse and General Electric led in heavy electric markets. In the late 1960s, a trend of conglomeration flared, as mega-conglomerates like Ling-Temco-Vought, Gulf+Western, and White Consolidated Industries went on buying sprees. Several takeover attempts by those firms were made on Allis-Chalmers. It was during the same era and business climate that Tenneco acquired Case.|$|E
25|$|The second painting, Red Houses, bears general {{similarity}} to landscapes by Cézanne and Braque. Both paintings are Cubist in style. However, with them Weinrich did not announce an abrupt conversion to Cubism, but rather marked a turning <b>toward</b> <b>greater</b> experimentation. In her later work {{she would not}} adopt a single style or stylistic tendency, but would produce both representative pictures and ones that were entirely abstract, always showing {{a strong sense of}} the two-dimensional plane of the picture's surface. After she made these two paintings neither her subject matter nor the media she used would dramatically change. She continued to employ subjects available to her in her Provincetown studio and the surrounding area to produce still lifes, village and pastoral scenes, portraits, and abstractions in oil on canvas and board; watercolor, pastel, crayon and graphite on paper; and woodblock prints.|$|E
25|$|Jean-Baptiste Lamarck had {{originally}} proposed a theory on the transmutation {{of species that}} was largely based on a progressive drive <b>toward</b> <b>greater</b> complexity. Lamarck also believed, as did many others at the time, that characteristics acquired {{during the course of}} an organism's life could be inherited by the next generation, and he saw this as a secondary evolutionary mechanism that produced adaptation to the environment. Typically, such characteristics included changes caused by the use or disuse of a particular organ. It was this mechanism of evolutionary adaptation through the inheritance of acquired characteristics that much later {{came to be known as}} Lamarckism. Although Alfred Russel Wallace completely rejected the concept in favor of natural selection, Charles Darwin always included what he called Effects of the increased Use and Disuse of Parts, as controlled by Natural Selection in On the Origin of Species, giving examples such as large ground feeding birds getting stronger legs through exercise, and weaker wings from not flying until, like the ostrich, they could not fly at all.|$|E

[...] According to Mohiuddin, [...] "Jinnah's death deprived Pakistan of a leader who could have enhanced stability and democratic governance... The rocky road to democracy in Pakistan and the relatively smooth one in India can in some measure be ascribed to Pakistan's tragedy of losing an incorruptible and highly revered leader so soon after independence." ...|$|E
500|$|People make {{a variety}} of sexual adaptations to help adjust to SCI. They often change their sexual practices, moving away from genital {{stimulation}} and intercourse and <b>toward</b> <b>greater</b> emphasis on touching above the level of injury {{and other aspects of}} intimacy such as kissing and caressing. It is necessary to discover new sexual positions if ones used previously have become too difficult. Other factors that enhance sexual pleasure are positive memories, fantasies, relaxation, meditation, breathing techniques, and most importantly, trust with a partner. People with SCI can make use of visual, auditory, olfactory, and tactile stimuli. It is possible to train oneself to be more mindful of the cerebral aspects of sex and of feeling in areas of the body that have sensation; this increases chances of orgasm. The importance of desire and comfort is the reasoning behind the quip [...] "the most important sexual organ is the brain." ...|$|E
