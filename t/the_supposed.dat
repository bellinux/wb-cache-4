5|$|Holliday had broad {{interests}} {{in developing the}} natural resources of Kansas. In the 1890s he became mistakenly convinced that Ellis and Trego counties in central Kansas contained mineral deposits of tin, zinc, and gold. In 1899 his son Charles K. Holliday founded Smoky Hill City, Kansas near <b>the</b> <b>supposed</b> mineral deposits.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the leper colony on Brei Holm {{there may have been}} another at Hilla Fielle overlooking Hamna Voe. A recent archaeological survey was inconclusive but suggests the site may be much older than <b>the</b> <b>supposed</b> 18th century colony.|$|E
5|$|National Masters R.O. Mitchell and Lionel Davis both {{claimed to}} have played Fischer on ICC, with Mitchell {{providing}} his alleged conversation with <b>the</b> <b>supposed</b> Fischer.

5|$|The {{hooded pitohui}} is monotypic, lacking any subspecies. Birds {{in the south}} east of New Guinea are {{sometimes}} separated into a proposed subspecies, P. d. monticola, but the differences are very slight and <b>the</b> <b>supposed</b> subspecies are generally regarded as inseparable.|$|E
5|$|There {{were reports}} of snipers taking potshots at rescue helicopters; these were false. Reports of gangs roving the city {{shooting}} {{police officers and}} survivors were also false, as only one policeman {{was shot in the}} aftermath of Katrina and no indictments were brought forward against <b>the</b> <b>supposed</b> gang members.|$|E
5|$|Youthfulness : Horace emphasises Troilus' youth {{by calling}} him inpubes ("unhairy", i.e. pre-pubescent or, figuratively, {{not old enough}} to bear arms).

5|$|A {{common theme}} in the fantasy genre is the battle between good and evil, which Martin rejects for not {{mirroring}} the real world. Attracted to gray characters, Martin instead endorses William Faulkner's view that only the human heart in conflict with itself was worth writing about. Martin explores the questions of redemption and character change in the Ice and Fire series. The multiple viewpoint structure allows characters to be explored from many sides, such that <b>the</b> <b>supposed</b> villains can provide their viewpoint.|$|E
5|$|According to the storyline for Ironside, {{ten days}} {{following}} D-Day, Allied forces would {{land in the}} Bordeaux region. This force would spend around twelve days establishing a bridgehead before advancing to meet formations supposedly part of an invasion of the Mediterranean coast of France (in reality these were fictional landings as well, part of another Bodyguard deception called Operation Vendetta). <b>The</b> <b>supposed</b> target of Ironside was {{the mouth of the}} Gironde estuary, with a landing site at Royan.|$|E
5|$|By {{the thirteenth}} and fourteenth centuries AD, Virgil had gained a {{reputation}} as a virtuous pagan, a term referring to pagans who were never evangelized and consequently during their lifetime had no opportunity to recognize Christ, but nevertheless led virtuous lives, so that it seemed objectionable to consider them damned. Eventually, some Christians sought to reconcile Virgil's works with <b>the</b> <b>supposed</b> Christianity present in them. Consequently, during the Late Antiquity and beyond, many assumed that the puer referenced in the Fourth Eclogue was actually Jesus Christ.|$|E

5|$|Camus was <b>the</b> <b>supposed</b> {{leader of}} a Norse expeditionary force {{defeated}} by the armies of King Malcolm II at the Battle of Barry. Tradition, popularised {{in the sixteenth century}} by historian Hector Boece, states that Camus fled the battle scene when defeat was imminent, and was caught and slain {{at the point where the}} cross now stands. The battle, and its main protagonists, including Camus, are now known to be historically inauthentic.|$|E
5|$|FBI Agent Jerry Lamana, Fox Mulder's former partner, {{approaches}} him and Dana Scully {{for help}} in investigating Drake's murder. On their way up to Drake's office, the agents' elevator stalls, causing Scully to call the front desk for help; as she identifies herself, the COS records her contact information. While examining the crime scene, the agents meet Claude Peterson, Eurisko's building systems engineer. Later, Lamana steals Mulder's profile of <b>the</b> <b>supposed</b> killer and presents it under his name; an outraged Mulder confronts him afterwards.|$|E
5|$|Following <b>the</b> <b>supposed</b> {{deciphering}} of the Egyptian alphabet in July and October 1835, Smith ostensibly {{translated the}} majority of the Book of Abraham in November 1835 and did some minor revisions in March 1842. In translating the book, Smith dictated and Phelps, Warren Parrish, and Frederick G. Williams acted as scribes. The complete work was first published serially in Times and Seasons in 1842, and was later canonized in 1880 by the LDS Church as part of its Pearl of Great Price.|$|E

5|$|For Sir Peter Hall's 1982 {{production}} at the National Theatre the cast included Judi Dench as Lady Bracknell, Martin Jarvis as Jack, Nigel Havers as Algy, Zoë Wanamaker as Gwendolen and Anna Massey as Miss Prism.

5|$|For Vendetta, {{stores were}} stockpiled in Algerian ports and Allied troops were given maps for <b>the</b> <b>supposed</b> landing zones. A naval exercise, {{involving}} sixty ships, was run between 9 and 11 June which included embarking {{thousands of men}} and vehicles from the US 91st Infantry Division. On 11 June, the Algerian borders were closed, a natural precursor to invasion.|$|E

After 2012, she claimed that several world leaders had intended to announce the presence of Nibiru near the sun on October 20, 2014. Two weeks after <b>the</b> <b>supposed</b> date of announcement, she claimed {{that it did not}} occur because of consternation amongst the establishment.|$|E
