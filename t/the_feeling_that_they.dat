5|$|In November 2014, Adam is {{revealed}} to be recovering from multiple facial reconstruction surgeries, {{and is in the}} care of Sage Warner (Kelly Sullivan). When Adam is told of Chelsea and Billy's new relationship, he attempts to leave his current dwelling, with Sage assuring him that he is not ready and that any attempt to leave would only compromise the progress of the surgeries he'd recently had. Adam eventually recovers enough to have the bandages removed from his face; after the bandages are removed it {{is revealed}} that his face had been replaced by Gabriel Bingham; the man who died saving Adam's life, he returns to Genoa City with Sage, he comes across the people he knows, but none of them recognize Adam or get <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> know him somehow. Adam, under the alias of Gabriel, would pose as being married to Sage, in a ruse to claim Gabe's inheritance from Constance, however, they would later divorce in April 2015. He would reconnect with Chelsea, whom he confessed his true identity, and would slowly begin to piece their life back together, with plans to relocate to Paris, until Victor stepped in to sue for custody of Connor, keeping them in Genoa City. In October 2015, Adam's true identity was revealed and would help Sage deliver his nephew in Chancellor Park, following a heated confrontation between the two. Adam would stand trial for his role in Delia's death. He was sentenced for ten years, and upon leaving the courthouse, was run over by an unknown assailant. Christine found out that the car is found at the south lake motel. The car was found out to be a rental and Kevin found a surveillance picture that showed that Chloe was behind the pedal to the metal. Adam regains consciousness after the surgery, and expresses no ill will towards Chloe.|$|E
25|$|Initial {{treatment}} {{is similar to}} atrophic rhinitis, namely keeping the nasal mucosa moist with saline or oil-based lubricants and treating pain and infection as they arise; adding menthol to lubricants may be helpful in ENS, as may be use of a cool mist humidifer at home. For people with anxiety, depression, or who are obsessed with <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> can't breathe, psychiatric or psychological care may be helpful.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the next}} three years, Core Design was {{committed}} to delivering a Tomb Raider game annually, putting considerable strain on staff. For this reason, and <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had exhausted the series' potential, the developers tried to kill the character off. This did not work, and while a fifth game was created, the team stated {{that they were not}} fully invested in its development. During development on the fifth game, the team split into two divisions, with one division working on the next-generation sequel The Angel of Darkness. During this period, multiple handheld titles were also developed by both Core Design and third-party developers. The production of The Angel of Darkness was beset by problems from an early stage, with the team wanting to create a grander game to compete with contemporary action-adventure games. Under pressure from Eidos, key sections of the game needed to be cut, and it was released before the team felt it was ready. The game received negative reactions from both fans and critics, and was cited by Paramount as the reason for the second Tomb Raider film underperforming.|$|E
5000|$|Series co-creators Scott Wilson (Host) and Andre Dupuis (Director and Videographer) {{have said}} that he and Wilson worked on another show, but that it seemed [...] "kind of dry", and that it was not {{carrying}} across <b>the</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had, thinking he and Wilson [...] "could probably do a better job".|$|R

2500|$|The lyrics were {{described}} by Yamaguchi {{as being the}} first love song that he had written. The lyrics are a person believing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are experiencing are being created by listening to a Bach melody at night time. The melody reminds him of {{the face of a}} woman and her [...] "whimsical color", while he wonders why he is fascinated by the moon. He believes that he will soon forget these feelings.|$|R
500|$|Madonna has {{performed}} [...] "Cherish" [...] live only during one tour, on her 1990 Blond Ambition World Tour. Onstage, the performance mirrored the sequence {{from the music}} video, {{with the appearance of}} three of Madonna's dancers, dressed as mermen. Author Carol Clerk noted in her book Madonnastyle that the outfit worn by the singer during this sequence was the simplest and the softest costume of the show. It consisted of a black mini-dress trimmed and stitched with a stuffed West African stork, called the marabou. Madonna gyrated around her dancers, while playing with a harp. During the chorus, the dancers lifted their prosthetic fish-tails and joined them with each other. Guilbert felt that the performance de-sexualizes men, since they are relegated to objects of adoration, like the three mermen dancers. This view was shared by Mark Bego, author of Madonna: Blonde Ambition, who said that [...] "Madonna and her girls go into a very girlish mode, but they give <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are in charge, be it playing with the mermen, or teasing them." [...] Two different performances were taped and released on video, the Blond Ambition Japan Tour 90, taped in Yokohama, Japan, on April 27, 1990, and the Blond Ambition World Tour Live, taped in Nice, France, on August 5, 1990.|$|E
500|$|Sex Trade 101 {{calls itself}} [...] "Toronto's only sex trade {{survivors}} and abolitionist organization" [...] and {{is composed of}} 12 women who had escaped forced prostitution and who offer training for police in order to change perceptions about {{people involved in the}} sex trade. The organization is also involved in prevention work in high schools. The organization offers mentorship and peer support groups for women who are currently or were formerly in prostitution. It also partners with other organizations including the Servants Anonymous Society of Calgary and Sheatre, an Owen Sound-based interactive theatre company. In 2012, Falle and Bridget Perrier represented Sex Trade 101 in Owen Sound where they launched ReStart, a mentorship program to aid women and youth who are at risk of sexual victimization, to help people exit the sex trade, and to provide support once they have exited. At the workshop that launched this program, Falle said that some people in the sex industry engage in survival sextrading sex for food, a place to sleep, alcohol, drugs, or <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are loved. She said that rural communities are common places for women and children to be groomed into prostitution. She identified Bruce—Grey—Owen Sound as particularly vulnerable because of the substance abuse in the area. By 2013, Sex Trade 101 had served more than 1,000 women. In May 2012, Falle spoke about human trafficking at high schools in Vancouver primarily because of the influence of a parent concerned about human trafficking in the area and its dangers to children.|$|E
2500|$|The {{book was}} {{described}} by its author as [...] "a fruit of many years of research" [...] and [...] "the most comprehensive and extensive review of some 3,000 years of Palestinian history, with emphasis on the Palestinian people's unique contribution {{to the world and}} to humanity". Interviewed on the Kol Chai radio station, Voll stated that [...] "The Palestinian people believe they are a people, and someone needs to tell them the truth even if it hurts. Look what happens when they were given <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are a real people." ...|$|E

2500|$|Other {{military}} representatives {{have said}} that religious accommodation requests to waive the prohibition for beards could be considered on a case-by-case basis, but only from those already in the military. However, critics have noted that such a policy would require an applicant to be a hypocrite: requesting a shaving waiver {{based on the fact}} that he cannot shave, but first shaving in order to enlist and qualify to submit a request. According to some commentators, the real reason beards have been prohibited is <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> [...] "are unseemly and make service members appear sloppy." [...] Army Regulation 670-1 states that [...] "personal appearance"—including [...] "strict grooming standards"—is an [...] "essential part of discipline" [...] and [...] "a neat and well-groomed appearance by all soldiers is fundamental to the Army and contributes to building the pride and esprit essential to an effective military force." ...|$|E
2500|$|Joey Ramone stated [...] "I {{spent most}} of the early 70s {{listening}} to Slade Alive! thinking to myself, [...] "Wow – this is what I want to do. I want to make that kind of intensity for myself. A couple of years later I was at CBGB's doing my best Noddy Holder." [...] Steve Jones of Sex Pistols stated [...] "Slade never compromised. We always had <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were on our side. I don't know but I think we were right." [...] NME commented on Slade's legacy in a review of a greatest hits album, [...] "They embodied the glorious absurdity of the greatest pop, in the sideburns, the mirrored top hat and Dave Hill's pudding bowl haircut. As such they were the simplest, most effective possible, riposte to prog rock's bloated pretensions and pseudo-intellect." [...] In 1981, Adam and the Ants' lead guitarist and co-songwriter Marco Pirroni stated that he was greatly influenced by the first gig he ever attended which was Slade at Wembley Pool in 1973.|$|E
2500|$|A website {{created by}} ISO Interactive, called the Chamber of Chat {{is a free}} online {{interactive}} virtual world under a MMO format. Although not a full MMORPG format, Chamber of Chat is set up with 3D virtual chatrooms and avatars where fans can socially {{interact with each other}} in Pictionary and Harry Potter Trivial games or participate in discussion groups about Harry Potter or Film media or perform plays as a theater group to other fans as audience. They hold special community event such as Harry Potters Birthday or Halloween and have seasonal house competitions.

[...] On 19 April 2007, Chamber of Chat was awarded Adobe Site of the day. Chamber of chat has also been awarded a place among the SmartFoxServer Showcase. [...] "Chamber of Chat is an MMO community inspired to the magic worlds of the Harry Potter saga.

50|$|Replicas {{work well}} in museum {{settings}} {{because they have the}} ability to look so real and accurate that people can feel <b>the</b> authentic <b>feelings</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are supposed to get from the originals.

50|$|At first, Alfred’s {{interpretation}} in {{the museum}} was very minimal, detailing only a few key pieces {{of information about the}} gorilla. Despite this, his position near the cafe, combined with the fame he had been accorded during his life, {{made him one of the}} most visited and celebrated exhibits. Many of those who saw Alfred in the zoo as children continued to visit him once he became an exhibit in <b>the</b> museum. <b>The</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had for him when he was alive often carried over into his second ‘life’ as an exhibit, maintaining and sustaining his fame. Later encounters with his taxidermic form were particularly memorable for those who could remember Alfred from his time at the zoo. One visitor, for example, encountered the gorilla unexpectedly when visiting her granddaughter at Bristol University more than forty years after Alfred’s demise.|$|R
5000|$|Patients {{correspondingly}} are not {{subjected to}} <b>the</b> uncomfortable <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{may or may}} not be receiving the experimental treatment.

5000|$|After the Green Goblin murders Gwen in The Amazing Spider-Man #121, Mary Jane {{attempts}} to comfort Peter. Peter, who is distraught {{over the loss}} of Gwen Stacy, angrily confronts MJ about her seemingly flighty and carefree attitude. He questions her ability to ever care about people like him and Gwen, and states [...] "You wouldn't be sorry if your own mother died," [...] unaware that her mother had actually died. Mary Jane is hurt by Peter's comments. She {{attempts to}} leave, but hesitates as she approaches the door, and ultimately chooses to stay with him. This served as a turning point in their relationship, and {{over the next couple of}} years, she and Peter become very close friends. Eventually, upon realizing <b>the</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> share for one another, they decide to take their relationship to the next level. Their relationship has a few initial hurdles, such as MJ's hot temper and Peter's always dashing off to be Spider-Man.|$|R

He and other two colleagues began producing films for <b>the</b> channel <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could do better than the films they bought from independent producers.|$|R
500|$|Flower was {{primarily}} intended to arouse positive emotions in the player, {{rather than to}} be a challenging and [...] "fun" [...] game. This focus was sparked by Chen, who felt that {{the primary purpose of}} entertainment products like video games was <b>the</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> evoked in <b>the</b> audience, and that the emotional range of most games was very limited. The team viewed their efforts as creating a work of art, removing gameplay elements and mechanics that were not provoking the desired response in the players. The music, composed by Vincent Diamante, dynamically responds to the player's actions and corresponds with the emotional cues in the game. Flower was a critical success, to the surprise of the developers. Reviewers praised the game's music, visuals, and gameplay, calling it a unique and compelling emotional experience. It was named the [...] "best independent game of 2009" [...] at the Spike Video Game Awards, and won the [...] "Casual Game of the Year" [...] award by the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences.|$|R
