His staff and police {{protection}} officers were granted visas within three days, but Wilders was not. On 2 October 2012 Immigration Minister Chris Bowen, while stating that Wilders' views were offensive, stated {{that he would not}} block the visa application. Bowen stated: [...] "I have decided not to intervene to deny him a visa because I believe that our democracy is strong enough, our multiculturalism robust enough and our commitment to freedom of speech entrenched enough <b>that</b> <b>our</b> <b>society</b> can withstand the visit of a fringe commentator {{from the other side of}} the world".|$|E
500|$|Ricardo López Murphy, {{minister}} of economy of president Fernando de la Rúa, said that Alfonsín was [...] "the man {{who fought for}} our democracy and the strengthening of institutions, {{during a time of}} conflicts and polarizations <b>that</b> <b>our</b> <b>society</b> was merged into". Cristian Ritondo, legislator of the Republican Proposal, said that [...] "Alfonsín was the main actor of the return of democracy to Argentina. He was a sinonym of work, responsibility and patriotism". Gerardo Morales said that [...] "when we were young in 1983 and sang 'we are life, we are peace', {{it was more than a}} slogan, it was a synthesis of our hopes: do not suffer more persecutions, live in democracy, in freedom and peace. We were part of the collective project led by Alfonsín". Elisa Carrió pointed that she had political disputes with him, but respected him nonetheless. Julio César Strassera, judge of the trial of the juntas, hoped that Alfonsín would be remembered as a great democrat. Daniel Scioli, governor of the Buenos Aires province, praised that he died with a complete peace of mind. Mauricio Macri, mayor of Buenos Aires, considered that he must have died in peace, after fulfilling his goals.|$|E

He also presents his thesis that {{there is a difference between}} masculinity and patriarchy. The author also argues that there is a deep need within men to participate in a fraternity with men and to have their maleness recognized by other men, but <b>that</b> <b>our</b> <b>society</b> often does not take this into account. The author claims that what usually results is that these needs become frustrated and manifest themselves in often anti-social behavior and activities, such as hazing rituals.|$|E

2500|$|Shortly after Shields {{graduated}} from college, her four-year transcript {{was published in}} the July 1987 edition of Life Magazine. Based on that transcript, The New York Times published a light-hearted op-ed piece intended to tweak the claim that Princeton produced superior, well-rounded graduates. Noting that Shields [...] "got all As and Bs, and obviously paid attention to her school work," [...] it claimed [...] "she got cheated" [...] because Princeton did not require her to take any classical studies, medieval, modern or American history, nor any course in mathematics, philosophy, economics, political science, world literature or science with laboratory experience. [...] "f that adds up to a liberal arts education from a place like Princeton, {{there is no longer any}} danger <b>that</b> <b>our</b> <b>society</b> will ever suffer from elitism in any form," [...] concluded the piece.|$|E
2500|$|Rogers {{identified}} the [...] "real self" [...] as {{the aspect of}} one's being that is founded in the actualizing tendency, follows organismic valuing, needs and receives positive regard and self-regard. It is the [...] "you" [...] that, if all goes well, you will become. On the other hand, to the extent <b>that</b> <b>our</b> <b>society</b> is {{out of sync with}} the actualizing tendency, and we are forced to live with conditions of worth that are out of step with organismic valuing, and receive only conditional positive regard and self-regard, we develop instead an [...] "ideal self". [...] By ideal, Rogers is suggesting something not real, something that is always out of our reach, the standard we cannot meet. This gap between the real self and the ideal self, the [...] "I am" [...] and the [...] "I should" [...] is called incongruity.|$|E
2500|$|Yet, because {{technology}} is everywhere and has dramatically changed landscapes and societies, Hughes argues that engineers, scientists, and managers have often {{believed that they}} can use technology to shape the world as they want. They have often supposed that {{technology is}} easily controllable and this assumption has to be thoroughly questioned. For instance, Evgeny Morozov particularly challenges two concepts: “Internet-centrism” and “solutionism." [...] Internet-centrism refers to the idea <b>that</b> <b>our</b> <b>society</b> is convinced that the Internet {{is one of the most}} stable and coherent forces. Solutionism is the ideology that every social issue can be solved thanks to technology and especially thanks to the internet. In fact, technology intrinsically contains uncertainties and limitations. According to Alexis Madrigal's review of Morozov's theory, to ignore it will lead to “unexpected consequences that could eventually cause more damage than the problems they seek to address." [...] Benjamin R. Cohen and Gwen Ottinger also discussed the multivalent effects of technology.|$|E

25|$|This {{thesis of}} {{negative}} capability {{is a key}} component in Unger's theory of false necessity and formative context. The theory of false necessity claims <b>that</b> <b>our</b> social worlds are the artifact of our own human endeavors. There is no pre-set institutional arrangement <b>that</b> <b>our</b> <b>societies</b> adhere to, {{and there is no}} necessary historical mold of development that they will follow. Rather we are free to choose and develop the forms and the paths <b>that</b> <b>our</b> <b>societies</b> will take through a process of conflicts and resolutions. However, there are groups of institutional arrangements that work together to bring out certain institutional forms, liberal democracy, for example. These forms are the basis of a social structure, and which Unger calls formative contexts. In order to explain how we move from one formative context to another without the conventional social theory constraints of historical necessity (e.g. feudalism to capitalism), and to do so while remaining true to the key insight of individual human empowerment and anti-necessitarian social thought, Unger recognized that there are an infinite number of ways of resisting social and institutional constraints, which can lead to an infinite number of outcomes. This variety of forms of resistance and empowerment (i.e. negative capability) make change possible.|$|R
2500|$|In a post-modern {{thesis on}} the superhero genre Michael Lecker wrote, [...] "In the superhero genre, clothes {{do the talking}} through semiotics, which [...] Barthes {{discusses}} in depth in his work: The 'first, literal message serves as a support for a second meaning, of a generally affective or ideological order' (Roland Barthes). The cat suits that adorn the feline hybrid characters in this genre are firstly illustrating their connection to felines. On the ideological level, the costumes signify the attributes <b>that</b> <b>our</b> <b>society</b> has projected onto cats and that the characters embody." [...] In another post-modern thesis on sadomasochism in cinema Andrea Beckmann wrote, [...] "Cinematic SM is twisted into the non-consenting, violent realm of the unhinged that {{we know it is}} not. Fetishism is used as an excuse for a bit of titillatory semi-nudity, or to identify the villain – the man in black leather. Horror films, in particular, will happily throw in a leather catsuit or a gratuitous bondage scene to spice up a mediocre script (M Olley, Pam Hogg: Warrior queen of the catwalk)." ...|$|E

60|$|The Serampore brethren are too notable to {{be passed}} over, if only for the memorable fact that Carey the cobbler lighted the missionary fire {{throughout}} England and America {{at a time when}} the embers had become so extinct <b>that</b> <b>our</b> <b>Society</b> for the Propagation of the Gospel had to borrow workers from Denmark and Germany. Indeed, Martyn's zeal was partly lighted by Carey, though the early termination of his labours has forced me to place his biography before that of the longer-lived Baptist friends--both men of curious and wonderful powers, but whose history shows the disadvantages of the Society government, and whose achievements were the less permanent in consequence. The Burmese branch of their work is chiefly noticeable for the characters and adventures of Dr. Judson and his three wives, and for the interesting display of Buddhism in contact with Christianity. According to the statistics in an American Missionary Dictionary, the work they founded has not fallen to the ground either at Moulmein or Rangoon; while there has also sprung up a hopeful English Church Mission in the same quarter. The last thing I saw about it was a mention of the neatness and dexterity of Burmese girls as needlewomen.|$|E
60|$|Well, {{it seemed}} to me <b>that</b> <b>our</b> <b>society</b> was no longer {{desirable}} in Nevada; so we stayed in our quarters and observed proper caution all day--except that once Steve went over to the hotel to attend to another customer of mine. That was a Mr. Cutler. You see Laird was not the only person whom I had tried to reform during my occupancy of the editorial chair. I had looked around and selected several other people, and delivered a new zest of life into them through warm criticism and disapproval--so that when I laid down my editorial pen I had four horse-whippings and two duels owing to me. We didn't care for the horse-whippings; there was no glory in them; they were not worth the trouble of collecting. But honor required that some notice should be taken of that other duel. Mr. Cutler had come up from Carson City, and had sent a man over with a challenge from the hotel. Steve went over to pacify him. Steve weighed only ninety-five pounds, but it was well known throughout the territory that with his fists he could whip anybody that walked on two legs, let his weight and science be what they might. Steve was a Gillis, and when a Gillis confronted a man and had a proposition to make, the proposition always contained business. When Cutler found that Steve was my second he cooled down; he became calm and rational, and was ready to listen. Steve gave him fifteen minutes {{to get out of the}} hotel, and half an hour to get out of town or there would be results. So that duel went off successfully, because Mr. Cutler immediately left for Carson a convinced and reformed man.|$|E

In response, Dunne and Raby, and the designers of which they approve, insist on the importance of speculations being physicalized beyond prototype but no longer (compared to their earlier "critical design" work) deployed for people to use.
