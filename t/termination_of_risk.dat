The assoctatton between {{exposure}} ami {{disease in}} a case-control study between cumulative incidence odds when cases are ascertained {{after the end}} of the entire period <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> (in the epidemiological study of acute illnesses). The odds ratio estimates the ratio between the pre-valence odds when cases are selected among the population of individuals with the disease under study. If incident cases from the group of candi-dates for a disease are chosen, the odds ratio esti-mates the ratio between incidence densities among the exposed and the non-exposed. A case-control study's cross-product can be a non-biased estimate of the true relative risk, defined as the ratio between two cumulative incidences. Table I shows an example of this situation where the control group is chosen with an illness other than that examined under the study's hypothesis and where both cases and controls are ascertained after the <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> the <b>risk</b> period for disease. The cumulative incidence is designated as CIA for exposed cases and Cl, for non-exposed cases. The corresponding terminology for the cumulative inci-dence in exposed and non-exposed controls with a reference illness, b, is Cl o and Cit " respectively. The exposed portion of the population is designated Ex. The odds ratio is (Ex CIA/(!- Ex) CIa) /(Ex CIn/ (I-Ex) CI b), which can be simplified to (CIA CIb) / (CIa Clo). This expression is equivalent to the rela-tive risk CIA/Cia when CIJClb is equal to I.

The two best allelic association markers have now retrospectively been used in five prenatal analyses originally studied with sialic acid assays in chorionic villus specimens. In four cases an unaffected fetus was predicted with a probability level of more than 94 %, which was in concordance with the biochemical data.

40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{approach}} to assessing the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> company activities <b>termination</b> by building a cost model. This model gives auditors information on managers’ understanding of factors influencing change {{in the value of}} assets and liabilities, and the methods to identify it in more effective and reliable ways. Based on this information, the auditor can assess the adequacy of use of the assumption on continuity of company operation by management personnel when preparing financial statements. Financial uncertainty entails real manifestations <b>of</b> factors creating <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> the occurrence of costs, revenue losses due their manifestations, which in the long run can be a reason for <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> company operation, and, therefore, need to be foreseen in the auditor’s assessment of the adequacy of use of the continuity assumption when preparing financial statements by company management. The purpose of the study is to explore and develop a methodology for use of cost models to assess the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> company operation in audit. The issue of methodology for assessing the audit risk through analyzing methods for company valuation has not been dealt with. The review of methodologies for assessing the <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> company operation in course of audit gives grounds for the conclusion that use of cost models can be an effective methodology for identification and assessment <b>of</b> such <b>risks.</b> The analysis <b>of</b> the above methods gives understanding of the existing system for company valuation, integrated into the management system, and the consequences of its use, i. e. comparison of the asset price data with the accounting data and the market value of the asset data. Overvalued or undervalued company assets may be a sign of future sale or liquidation of a company, which may signal on high probability <b>of</b> <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> company operation. A wrong choice or application of valuation methods can be indicative <b>of</b> the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> non-reliable and non-relevant information received by users of financial statements. The study of methods for assessing the company value lays the basis for developing a methodological guideline of the procedural support for audit of administrative decision making on valuation and revaluation of assets. ...|$|R
