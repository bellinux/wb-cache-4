The dynamic {{characteristics}} of a thin wall rectangular paraIIelepiped steel tank containing sand was studied by experimentaI modal analysis for varying amount <b>of</b> <b>sand.</b> It was found that below a certain amount <b>of</b> <b>sand</b> the natural frequency corresponding to a particular mode shape increases as the mass <b>of</b> <b>sand</b> is increased but as the mass <b>of</b> <b>sand</b> is increased further from that amount the natural frequency would increase.

40|$|The authors {{consider}} {{several aspects}} of applicability of the new approach to formation of effective stresses in soils in relation to sands, as it was {{set out in the}} theory developed by academician V. I. Osipov. The analysis of several genetic types <b>of</b> quaternary <b>sands,</b> performed by the authors, makes it possible to use the number of contacts to identify the morphology <b>of</b> <b>sand</b> grains {{within the framework of the}} analysis of soils. The authors demonstrate that the employment of the formulas developed by academician V. I. Osipov in the calculation of the number of contacts between particles in natural sandy soils is virtually impossible due to the fact that no natural sand particles can boast an ideal spherical shape. The number of contacts between the sand particles may increase due to the defects of their shape and the nature of the particle surface. In this study, the shape and nature of the surface <b>of</b> <b>sand</b> grains represent those <b>of</b> the <b>sands</b> <b>of</b> various origins. The authors have employed a composite index of morphology that takes account of the shape and nature of the surface throughout the amount <b>of</b> <b>sand</b> under research. Similar calculations that take account of the morphology of grains were performed for selected fractions <b>of</b> <b>sands</b> to eliminate the influence of grain size on the packing <b>of</b> <b>sands.</b> The analysis <b>of</b> provisions of the physical and chemical theory of effective stresses of soils and the study of multiple types <b>of</b> natural <b>sands</b> demonstrate that further research of formation and phases of coagulation contacts between particles of soil requires a detailed study of structural features <b>of</b> <b>sands.</b> These structural features include the grain size, homogeneity, the shape and nature of the surface <b>of</b> <b>sand</b> grains. Both individual particles <b>of</b> <b>sand</b> and sandy soil are to be subjected to morphological assessments. The parameters to be assessed will include density and composition of sandy soils, as the soil porosity affects the formation of true contacts between particles <b>of</b> <b>sand</b> and determines their number.

The research performed by the authors contemplates the study of the morphology of monogene, polymineral, oligomictic and polymictic sands.

30|$|According to the {{constitutive}} equation <b>of</b> <b>sand</b> mould shear zone (Eq. (23)), for the sand mould with uniform grain size, {{there are two}} aspects {{of the influence of}} particle size on cutting force. One is the static strength <b>of</b> <b>sand</b> mould, the other are the linear and quadric terms of shear rate which are the momentum and kinetic energy <b>of</b> the moving <b>sand</b> respectively. In general, the static strength <b>of</b> <b>sand</b> mould increases with the increase of the diameter <b>of</b> <b>sand,</b> and the momentum and kinetic energy <b>of</b> the single <b>sand</b> also increase with the diameter <b>of</b> <b>sand</b> particles. So the cutting force <b>of</b> the <b>sand</b> mould increases with the diameter increasing. However, the sand granularity in the <b>sand</b> mould is <b>of</b> 70 / 140, which means that the size <b>of</b> <b>sand</b> distributes randomly within a certain range. Therefore, the distributions <b>of</b> the <b>sand</b> particles and strength are non-uniform. In the sand mould cutting process, when cutting the large sand particle or the region with higher strength, the cutting forces will increase. Otherwise, cutting forces will decrease. In the {{constitutive equation}}s of prediction model (Eq. (23)), the compression strength σs is calculated as the macroscopical experimental results <b>of</b> the <b>sand</b> mould, and the sand particle diameter is calculated as an average diameter. That means the predictive model does not consider the effect of non-homogeneity, so the fluctuation of predicted cutting force is lower than the measured results.|$|R
