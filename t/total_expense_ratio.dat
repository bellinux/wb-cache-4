40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesThe core {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to compile an African Mutual Fund database with a focus on fees charged, expenses borne and fund sizes. Until now, no consolidated database of African Mutual Fund expenses exists. The ancillary goal of the paper is to arrange the dataset in order to perform basic statistical analysis; and to test for the existence or non-existence of a number of internationally established relationships between fund fees, expenses and other variables in an African context. The paper aims to establish both similarities and abnormalities relating to the efficiency of African Mutual Funds in comparison with their international counterparts. No prior work has been produced in the context of African Mutual Funds as the industry has been overlooked, until recently, due to the growing perception of Africa representing the final frontier for investors seeking abnormal returns. The fundamental data utilized in this research paper includes African Mutual Fund <b>Total</b> <b>Expense</b> <b>Ratios,</b> Net Asset Values (NAVs), and mean <b>Total</b> <b>Expense</b> <b>Ratios</b> (TERs) for international mutual funds with no particular geographical limitations. This paper achieves its {{objective of}} collating a comprehensive database of African Mutual Fund fees, expenses, size and other variables.

50|$|For {{the reasons}} cited above, it is {{important}} for a prospective investor to compare the fees of the various funds under consideration.

40|$|Mutual funds {{attracted}} great {{attention of}} both shareholders and academics in last few decades. Mutual funds provide benefits like diversification, professional managements and reduced costs for individual shareholders. Shareholders invest their assets into mutual funds managed by professionals. Managers {{may have an}} incentive to use those assets to satisfy their own interests. They can achieve this by charging excessive fees or spending more on the perquisites. These unmatched interests of shareholders and managers create so called principal-agent conflicts. Some researchers argue that market competition in mutual funds industry is strong enough to align interests of both shareholders and managers, thus mitigating principal-agent conflicts. Others believe there is need for internal governance to monitor managers‟ behaviors. Board of directors as an internal governance mechanism is responsible for aligning shareholders and managers interests. We collected data on board characteristics to find if they are related to funds attributes. Our sample of funds consists of 68 fund management companies with total of 603 mutual funds managed by those companies. Board characteristics include board size, age and gender of board members, and presence of CEO on the board. Fund attributes are <b>total</b> <b>expense</b> <b>ratio,</b> rate of return and management fees used as a measure of board effectiveness.

Nine Hundred sixty-four sole proprietors, who were members of the Kansas Farm Management Association (KFMA) with continuous data from 2002 - 2006, were split up into four groups based on age. Comparing the fourth age group (over 65 years of age) to the first age group (under or equal to 45 years of age) was of primary importance in this study. Comparisons were made utilizing variables pertaining to farm size and tenure, specialization, efficiency, liquidity, and solvency.

Six key variables were analyzed; value of farm production, total acres, economic <b>total</b> <b>expense</b> <b>ratio,</b> operating profit margin ratio, asset turnover ratio, and percent of livestock income. Data from the Kansas Farm Management Association were used in this study. To {{be included in the}} study, a farm had to have five years of continuous, usable data for a five-year period between 1973 and 2007. Moving five-year averages were calculated for the farms that met this qualification. Data were sorted by value of farm production and broken down by quartiles and deciles. Trend regressions were used to calculate growth rates of the key variables and the difference between the top and bottom quartiles of the variables. Results suggested that acreage per farm is increasing, farms are doing better at covering their total economic costs, profit margin per farm has decreased, farms are utilizing their assets better, and the percent of livestock income per farm has decreased. When regressing the difference between the top and bottom quartiles to determine growth rates, it was evident that the gaps between the top and bottom quartiles of five of the six variables have widened. The differences in the percent of livestock income between farm quartiles and deciles were not significant. Convergence analysis confirmed the results of the trend regressions and suggested that divergence is evident in the Kansas farming sector.

40|$|THE ACTIVITY AND PERFORMANCE OF FINNISH EQUITY FUNDS Applying the Active Share method Purpose of {{the study}} This thesis {{concentrates}} on Finnish equity funds investing in Finland, Nordic Countries and Europe. The objective {{is to determine the}} level of active management in the Finnish equity market and the performance and expenses related to different activity levels. The objective is also to examine closet indexing in the Finnish equity market. Data and methodology The data in this thesis is from the first quarter of 2008 to the third quarter of 2010. Mutual fund holdings are from Investment Research Finland Ltd. and funds’ annual and quarterly reports. Benchmark index holdings are from MSCI Barra and NASDAQ OMX. All the net asset values for the funds and benchmark indices are from Investment Research Finland Ltd. Total Expense Ratios are from the Finnish Mutual Fund Reports. The level of active management is determined by using Active Share and tracking error. Active Share measures the amount of fund holdings that differ from the benchmark index holdings and tracking error calculates how much the fund’s daily returns deviate from the benchmark index returns. Results The Finnish equity funds are quite active since less than 40 % of the fund assets are on average invested according to benchmark indices. The equity funds investing in Finland are clearly the most passive compared to the funds investing in Nordic Countries and Europe. The average performance of the Finnish equity funds increases as the level of activity increases. In addition, the most active funds performed the best within every fund group with different investment scopes. There exist several closet indexing funds in the Finnish equity fund market. These funds also charge substantial fees compared to their activity levels.

Factors influencing the <b>expense</b> <b>ratio</b> include {{the size of the}} fund (small funds often have higher ratios as they spread expenses among a smaller number of investors), sales charges, and the management style of the fund. A typical annual <b>expense</b> <b>ratio</b> for a U.S. domestic stock fund is about 1%, although some passively managed funds (such as index funds) have significantly lower ratios.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{characteristics}} of 189 retail index mutual funds that track eight primary benchmarks across diverse <b>expense</b> <b>ratio</b> classes. These performance measures and attributes are the Sharpe ratio, Jensen’s alpha, annualized total return, Morningstar rating, portfolio turnover, load and 12 b- 1 fees, fund size, age, and manager tenure. In general, our results {{support the notion that}} retail index funds with low <b>expense</b> <b>ratios</b> outperform those with excessive <b>expense</b> <b>ratios.</b> In addition, <b>expense</b> <b>ratios</b> tend to decrease as turnover, loads, and 12 b- 1 fees decline and as fund size and age increase. Experienced managers do not necessarily run these low-cost funds. Instead, higher-cost funds have managers with a longer tenure at the fund...|$|R
