5|$|Family members {{contribute}} to pragmatic development in different ways. Fathers often act as secondary caregivers, and may know the child less intimately. Older siblings may lack {{the capacity to}} acknowledge the child's needs. As a result, both fathers and siblings may pressure children to communicate more clearly. They often challenge children to improve their communication skills, therefore preparing them to communicate with strangers about unfamiliar topics. Fathers have more breakdowns when communicating with infants, and spend less time focused on the same objects or actions as infants. Siblings are more directive and less responsive to infants, which motivates infants to participate in conversations with their older siblings. There are limitations to studies <b>that</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> influences of fathers and siblings, as most research is descriptive and correlational. In reality, there are many variations of family configurations, and context influences parent behaviour more than parent gender does. The majority of {{research in this field}} is conducted with mother/child pairs.|$|E

25|$|The {{two main}} {{philosophical}} approaches to animal rights are utilitarian and rights-based. The former is exemplified by Peter Singer, {{and the latter}} by Tom Regan and Gary Francione. Their differences reflect a distinction philosophers draw between ethical theories that judge the rightness of an act by its consequences (consequentialism/teleological ethics, or utilitarianism), and those <b>that</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> principle behind the act, almost regardless of consequences (deontological ethics). Deontologists argue that there are acts we should never perform, even if failing to do so entails a worse outcome.|$|E

25|$|The National Women's Service is the {{political}} institution created in 1991 that crafts executive bills concerning women's rights.

Its presence in Chile {{is important because it}} was established by law and is a permanent part of Chile's state structure. As an institution it tends to focus much of its attention on certain segments of women: low-income women heads of households, women seasonal workers, domestic violence prevention, and teen pregnancy prevention.|$|E
25|$|Focus on the Family {{supports}} {{private school}} vouchers and {{tax credits for}} religious schools. According to Focus on the Family website, Dobson believes that parents are ultimately responsible for their children's education, and encourages parents to visit their children's schools {{to ask questions and}} to join the PTA so that they may voice their opinions. Dobson opposes sex education curricula that are not abstinence-only. According to People for the American Way, Focus on the Family material has been used to challenge a book or curriculum taught in public schools. Critics, such as People for the American Way, allege <b>that</b> <b>Focus</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Family encourages Christian teachers to establish prayer groups in public schools. Dobson supports student-led prayer in public schools, and believes that allowing student-led Christian prayer in schools does not violate the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.|$|E

25|$|In the U.S. and Canada the UPCI has {{traditionally}} reflected the majority culture {{with the majority}} of its constituency being Caucasian and Anglo-American. In {{the last quarter of the}} twentieth century, however, the UPCI became more intentional about the inclusion of every race and culture in North America. Consequently, over the years the UPCI of the U.S. and Canada has established several important ministries <b>that</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> evangelism of minority groups. As of 2013 these ministries have made significant progress and are led by representatives of the various ethnicities. Spanish Evangelism Ministry reported over 700 Spanish-speaking ministers and about 350 Spanish-language congregations. Building the Bridge Ministry develops strategies for cross-cultural ministry, urban ministry, and particularly evangelism into the African-American community. Its leaders estimated that the UPCI had about 500 Black ministers and 250 Black pastors. Multicultural Ministries coordinates outreach to eighteen language and ethnic groups, encompassing 186 ministers and 195 works. Based on these statistics in 2013 about 1,400 ministers were from minority groups, or fifteen percent of the total, and about 800 churches were ministering primarily to ethnic minorities, or eighteen percent of the total. In addition, most UPCI churches have significant involvement by ethnic minorities, especially larger churches, growing churches, and churches in urban areas. This involvement was an estimated ten to fifteen percent of constituency. In sum, as of 2013 an estimated twenty-five to thirty percent of UPCI constituency in the U.S. and Canada was nonwhite.|$|E

500|$|Travel is {{a common}} theme in American {{autobiography}} as a whole; as McPherson states, it {{is something of a}} national myth to Americans as a people. This is also the case for African American autobiography, which {{has its roots in the}} slave narrative. Like those narratives <b>that</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> writers' search for freedom from bondage, modern African American autobiographers like Angelou seek to develop [...] "an authentic self" [...] and the freedom to find it in their community. As McPherson states, [...] "The journey to a distant goal, the return home, and the quest which involves the voyage out, achievement, and return are typical patterns in Black autobiography".|$|E
500|$|Katharine Mieszkowski of Salon.com {{recommends}} that childless people adopt VHEMT's arguments when facing [...] "probing questions" [...] about their childlessness. Writing in the Journal for Critical Animal Studies, Carmen Dell'Aversano notes that VHEMT seeks to renounce {{children as a}} symbol of perpetual human progress. She casts the movement as a form of [...] "queer oppositional politics" [...] because it rejects perpetual reproduction as a form of motivation. She argues that the movement seeks to come to a new definition of [...] "civil order", as Lee Edelman suggested that queer theory should. Dell'Aversano believes that VHEMT fulfills Edelman's mandate because they embody the death drive rather than ideas <b>that</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> reproduction of the past.|$|E
