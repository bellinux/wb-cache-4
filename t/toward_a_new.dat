5|$|In 2011, MFP Baseball and the Mayor's Office {{began working}} <b>toward</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> stadium, {{with the city}} {{identifying}} three potential sites for construction, and recruiting stadium-builder Populous to study each. The three sites were an area on {{the north end of}} The Gulch, the site of Nashville's first ballpark (Sulphur Dell), and various areas directly adjacent to Nissan Stadium and the eastern terminus of the John Seigenthaler Pedestrian Bridge. The Sounds still preferred the Thermal site due to its proximity to the city's entertainment and central business districts, but the city was not willing to make a second attempt at a stadium in that location (Ascend Amphitheater was eventually built there). Mayor Karl Dean preferred the Sulphur Dell site, in an attempt to bolster economic growth on downtown's sluggish North side, while incorporating the ballpark into the surrounding neighborhoods. In late summer 2013, the Sounds and the Nashville Metropolitan Government reached an agreement to build a new $37million downtown ballpark at Sulphur Dell. Construction on First Tennessee Park began after necessary land-swaps with the State of Tennessee, and the new ballpark opened in time {{for the start of the}} 2015 season.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{rising to}} power, Rajoelina {{dissolved}} the Senate and National Assembly and transferred their powers {{to a variety}} of new governance structures he made responsible for overseeing the transition <b>toward</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> constitutional authority. These administrative structures repeatedly conflicted with the internationally mediated process to establish a transitional government of consensus. Voters approved a new constitution in a national referendum unilaterally organized by the Rajoelina administration in November 2010, ushering in the Fourth Republic and putting in place the conditions enabling Rajoelina to stand in the next general election. In January 2013 he announced his decision to abstain from running in the 2013 general election, but in May 2013 he reversed this decision and submitted his candidature. A special electoral court ruled in August 2013 that his candidature was invalid and that Rajoelina would not be permitted to run in the 2013 election. He has declared an interest in presenting himself as a presidential candidate in a future election.|$|E

25|$|Climate change {{causes a}} shift in the {{equilibrium}} line altitude (ELA) of a glacier. This is the imaginary line on a glacier, above which snow accumulates faster than it ablates, and below which, the reverse is the case. This altitude shift, in turn, prompts a retreat or advance of the terminus <b>toward</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> steady-state position. However, this change in terminus behavior for calving glaciers is also a function of resulting changes in fjord geometry, and calving rate at the glacier terminus as it changes position.|$|E

25|$|Although Color Field is {{associated}} with Clement Greenberg, Greenberg actually preferred {{to use the term}} Post-Painterly Abstraction. In 1964, Clement Greenberg curated an influential exhibition that traveled the country called Post-painterly abstraction. The exhibition expanded the definition of color field painting. Color Field painting clearly pointed <b>toward</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> direction in American painting, away from abstract expressionism. In 2007 curator Karen Wilkin curated an exhibition called Color As Field:American Painting 1950-1975 that traveled to several museums throughout the United States. The exhibition showcased several artists representing two generations of Color Field painters.|$|E
25|$|In 1980 Ted Turner founded CNN, {{which he}} said was {{inspired}} by Toffler's forecasting {{the end of the}} dominance of the three main television networks. Turner's company, Turner Broadcasting, published Toffler's Creating a New Civilization in 1995. Shortly after the book was released, Russian president Mikhail Gorbachev hosted the Global Governance Conference in San Francisco with the theme, <b>Toward</b> <b>a</b> <b>New</b> Civilization, which was attended by dozens of world figures, including the Tofflers, George H. W. Bush, Margaret Thatcher, Carl Sagan, Abba Eban and Turner with his wife, actress Jane Fonda.|$|E
25|$|Kelly's {{discovery}} in 1952 of Monet's late work infused {{him with a}} new freedom of painterly expression: he began working in extremely large formats and explored the concepts of seriality and monochrome paintings. As a painter he worked from then on in an exclusively abstract mode. By the late 1950s, his painting stressed shape and planar masses (often assuming non-rectilinear formats). His work of this period also provided a useful bridge from the vanguard American geometric abstraction of the 1930s and early 1940s to the minimalism and reductive art of the mid-1960s and 1970s. Kelly's relief painting Blue Tablet (1962), for example, {{was included in the}} seminal 1963 exhibition, <b>Toward</b> <b>a</b> <b>New</b> Abstraction, at the Jewish Museum.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} known {{civilization is}} the Olmec. This civilization established the cultural blueprint by which all succeeding indigenous civilizations would follow in Mexico. Pre-Olmec civilization {{began with the}} production of pottery in abundance, around 2300 BCE in the Grijalva River delta. Between 1600 and 1500 BCE, the Olmec civilization had begun, with the consolidation of power at their capital, a site today known as San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán near the coast in southeast Veracruz. The Olmec influence extended across Mexico, into Central America, and along the Gulf of Mexico. They transformed many peoples' thinking <b>toward</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> way of government, pyramid-temples, writing, astronomy, art, mathematics, economics, and religion. Their achievements {{paved the way for}} the Maya civilization and the civilizations in central Mexico.|$|E
25|$|The {{continuous}} interplay (exchange or trade) done {{by economic}} actors in all markets sets the prices for all {{goods and services}} which, in turn, make the rational managing of scarce resources possible. At the same time, the decisions (choices) made by the same actors, while they are pursuing their own interest, determine the level of output (production), consumption, savings, and investment, in an economy, {{as well as the}} remuneration (distribution) paid to the owners of labour (in the form of wages), capital (in the form of profits) and land (in the form of rent). Each period, as if they were in a giant feedback system, economic players influence the pricing processes and the economy, and are in turn influenced by them until a steady state (equilibrium) of all variables involved is reached or until an external shock throws the system <b>toward</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> equilibrium point. Because of the autonomous actions of rational interacting agents, the economy is a complex adaptive system.|$|E

500|$|Mark Ivor Satin (born November 16, 1946) is an American {{political}} theorist, author, and newsletter publisher. [...] He is {{best known}} for contributing to the development and dissemination of three political perspectives– neopacifism in the 1960s, New Age politics in the 1970s and 1980s, and radical centrism in the 1990s and 2000s. [...] Satin's work is sometimes seen as building <b>toward</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> political ideology, and then it is often labeled [...] "transformational", [...] "post-liberal", or [...] "post-Marxist". [...] One historian calls Satin's writing [...] "post-hip".|$|E
500|$|Mikael Wood of Spin {{gave the}} album six stars out of ten, saying it [...] "contains plenty of aggressively arty material" [...] and calling [...] "The Messenger" [...] the [...] "most {{unexpected}} track on the boldly conceived A Thousand Suns".

Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone gave it three stars out of five; he said Linkin Park were [...] "feeling their way <b>toward</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> identity"; he called their skill for melody [...] "obvious" [...] {{and said they}} sounded like [...] "a killer Linkin Park tribute band". Australia's Music Network magazine gave the album a mixed review, calling it [...] "a radical shift for the band, but it’s also a very uneven one...while there's some commanding moments ('The Catalyst,' 'Wretches and Kings'), many of the tracks feel like experiments rather than formed songs".|$|E

25|$|During {{the band}}'s early years, the band had a varying group of musicians {{recording}} with the band, including many session musicians.

This decision was criticized by fans of the group's heavier metal sound; however, it increased the band's mainstream audience and bolstered their album sales.
