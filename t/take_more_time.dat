5|$|Development of MediEvil: Resurrection {{began in}} 2003 at SCE Cambridge Studio. The senior {{management}} team of Sony Computer Entertainment Europe wanted a launch game for the PlayStation Portable console and ordered the studio to develop the game {{in time for the}} console's release. Due to the short notice, the studio was given only a year to develop a game, thus it was decided that a remake of the original MediEvil would be suitable as developing an original title would <b>take</b> <b>more</b> <b>time</b> to develop.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} reasons for the {{reluctance}} of some dealers to sell plug-in electric vehicles. PEVs do not offer car dealers the same profits as gasoline-powered car. Plug-in electric vehicles <b>take</b> <b>more</b> <b>time</b> to sell because of the explaining required, which hurts overall sales and sales people commissions. Electric vehicles also may require less maintenance, resulting in loss of service revenue, and thus undermining the biggest source of dealer profits, their service departments. According to the National Automobile Dealers Association (NADS), dealers on average make {{three times as much}} profit from service as they do from new car sales. However, a NADS spokesman said there was not sufficient data to prove that electric cars would require less maintenance. According to the New York Times, BMW and Nissan are among the companies whose dealers tend to be more enthusiastic and informed, but only about 10% of dealers are knowledgeable on the new technology.|$|E

The teachers anticipated it would be challenging to apply the designed curriculum to primary science education in Vietnam if the time amount for one lesson exceeded 35  min (see Hằng et al., 2015).|$|R

If they do not succeed in seizing the computer in that condition, there are some methods available to bypass password protection, but these may <b>take</b> <b>more</b> <b>time</b> than police have available. Nor may it be legally possible to compel the suspect to relinquish his or her password—in the United States, where many computer-crime investigations take place, courts have distinguished between forcing a suspect to use material means of protecting data such as a thumbprint, retinal scan or key {{as opposed to a}} password or passcode, which is purely the product of the suspect's mental processes and is thus protected from compelled disclosure by the Fifth Amendment.|$|E
25|$|Aguilera {{initially}} {{planned to}} further promote the album by embarking on The Bionic Tour. It {{was announced in}} early May 2010 that twenty shows had been scheduled in North America, which was anticipated to run from July 15, 2010 to August 19, 2010. British singer Leona Lewis {{was said to be}} a supporting act and the tour would be in conjunction with North American leg of Lewis's The Labyrinth tour. Later that month, Aguilera announced that she would postpone the tour until 2011. In a message from tour promoter Live Nation, Aguilera stated that due to the excessive promotion of the album and her then upcoming film debut in Burlesque, she felt it was necessary to <b>take</b> <b>more</b> <b>time</b> to rehearse the show and with less than a month between the album release and the tour, it was impossible to create a show as her fans' expectation.|$|E

25|$|With 11:08 {{remaining}} in the fourth quarter, Philadelphia scored on a 24-yard field goal from David Akers, cutting their deficit to three points. After an exchange of punts, the Saints drove from their 29 to the Eagles 35-yard line with 3:24 left in the game. New Orleans was in great position to <b>take</b> <b>more</b> <b>time</b> off the clock and increase their lead, but Bush fumbled a high pitch from Brees and Philadelphia's Darren Howard recovered the ball, giving his team a chance to drive for a tying field goal. However, the Eagles were unable to get a first down. They appeared to convert a fourth and 10 to Hank Baskett, but the loud crowd noise had muted the whistles of a false start by guard Scott Young, originally a backup to injured starter Shawn Andrews. After that, they chose to punt the ball back with 1:57 left. The Saints then clinched the victory by keeping possession of the ball {{for the rest of}} the game.|$|E
500|$|According to {{a survey}} {{conducted}} by TV Asahi, most Japanese people perceived [...] "Kimigayo" [...] as an important song even before {{the passage of the}} Act on National Flag and Anthem in 1999. However, a poll in the same year conducted by the Mainichi Shimbun found that most respondents opposed legislation making it the national anthem or felt the Diet should <b>take</b> <b>more</b> <b>time</b> in passing such a law. Many Japanese students, who must sing the song at entrance and graduation ceremonies, say they cannot understand the old language of the lyrics and are not educated on its historical uses. Controversies surrounding the use of the anthem in school events still remain.|$|E

The England selectors confirmed that they remained in favour of including Trescothick at some point, looking [...] "forward to his making himself available again for England when the time is right". Trescothick, however, said that he knows England cannot wait for him forever, and on 10 September 2007 he went into his second year without an England contract.|$|E

The whole idea about the dude with Slayer in his arms was brought about because reality is scarier than anything you can make up." [...] The production of the album posed as a challenge to the record company, [...] "how to market a group whose gore-soaked, extreme music is anathema to radio programmers." [...] It is the company's first attempt to [...] "hit the thrash band's core-audience of rabid enthusiasts with a fan-orientated marketing assault." [...] Araya related: [...] "We decided to <b>take</b> <b>more</b> <b>time</b> to bring this one together. We actually went into the studio with more written material than the past. We completed three out of seven songs outside the studio. We all sort of felt it was important to do it slowly. After the last tour, we had the intention to take the break." ...|$|E
500|$|Unlike {{kangaroos}} and eucalyptus-eating possums, koalas are hindgut fermenters, {{and their}} digestive retention {{can last for}} up to 100 hours in the wild, or up to 200 hours in captivity. This is {{made possible by the}} extraordinary length of their caecum— long and [...] in diameter—the largest proportionally of any animal. [...] Koalas can select which food particles to retain for longer fermentation and which to pass through. Large particles typically pass through more quickly, as they would <b>take</b> <b>more</b> <b>time</b> to digest. While the hindgut is proportionally larger in the koala than in other herbivores, only 10% of the animal's energy is obtained from fermentation. Since the koala gains a low amount of energy from its diet, its metabolic rate is half that of a typical mammal, although this can vary between seasons and sexes. The koala conserves water by passing relatively dry faecal pellets high in undigested fibre, and by storing water in the caecum.|$|E
