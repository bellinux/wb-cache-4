Accounting or related principles are not taken into account when the tax liability is determined except in instances where the ITA specifically provides for it. The aim of this dissertation is to answer the question of whether there is a disconnect between the timing of the transfer <b>of</b> <b>immovable</b> <b>property</b> and the timing of the attendant taxation for the seller through analysing specifically the various Acts and laws which impact the transfer <b>of</b> <b>immovable</b> <b>property...</b>|$|R

40|$|It is an {{accepted}} principle in South African law that movable property acquired in an original way (by operation of law) is not burdened by any limited real rights, as previous limited real rights are extinguished on the vesting of ownership (mobilia non habent sequelam). It is assumed by some South African writers {{that the same}} principles are applicable to the original acquisition <b>of</b> <b>immovable</b> <b>property</b> and that all existing limited real rights fall away on original acquisition of ownership. In this article the nature of limited real rights to <b>immovable</b> <b>property</b> is examined, {{and the notion that}} ownership is the "mother" right on which all limited real rights are based is scrutinised critically. The nature and establishment of limited real rights are used to distinguish between the essence and effect of limited real rights in the case <b>of</b> <b>immovable</b> <b>property.</b> The recognition <b>of</b> limited real rights as constitutional property is used as a further argument that limited real rights cannot be extinguished automatically by the original acquisition <b>of</b> <b>immovable</b> <b>property,</b> as such common law or statutory measures will constitute an arbitrary deprivation of property in terms of section 25 of the Constitution. The statutory provisions regarding limited real rights in the case of prescription and expropriation are then analysed as an indication {{that it is not a}} general principle that limited real rights are extinguished automatically on the original acquisition <b>of</b> ownership <b>of</b> <b>immovable</b> <b>property...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{issue of}} land {{taxation}} is currently often neglected in scientific articles despite {{the existence of}} the land taxation and property taxes in most countries of the European Union. This paper deals with a specific property tax in the Czech Republic – the tax on the acquisition <b>of</b> <b>immovable</b> <b>property.</b> The aim <b>of</b> the paper is, on the one hand, to characterise the tax on the acquisition <b>of</b> <b>immovable</b> <b>property,</b> its general principles and the classification in land taxation, and on the other hand, to analyse the possibilities of a tax entity for the tax base determination and the tax liability calculation. For this purpose, a model example of taxation of the transfer <b>of</b> <b>immovable</b> <b>property</b> for consideration is used, to which the method of the multi-criteria decision-making is applied as an opportunity to use the mathematical methods for the transactional property tax. Based on the method of the multi-criteria analysis of alternatives, it was found that in the model example, it was more advantageous for the tax entity to use the indicative value.
