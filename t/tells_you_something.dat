He said it was crucial to go out to where the story was and to speak directly to those involved. He is remembered by journalists for many stories and sayings, but the one that is still quoted today is: [...] "When a politician <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> <b>something</b> in confidence, always ask yourself Why is this lying bastard lying to me?" [...] Although, as the man from The Times, he was able to relay the ideas and actions of the powerful to the world, his heart was really in reporting how the news affected ordinary people. He gave himself one last assignment in 1981 when Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was threatening the British coal industry with closure. He travelled to Yorkshire and went underground with a shift of pit miners.|$|E

The quality was always high and the disagreements were spirited but respectful, with none of the partisan or ideological rancor that now characterizes so much of economic conversation. But last week's meeting of the panel was special. Nearly 100 alumni, including a certain former Federal Reserve chairman and three Nobel prize winners, gathered to pay tribute to George Perry, a Brookings fixture, and Yale professor Bill Brainard, who have been the guiding hands and spirit of the panel for the past 27 years.

The song was attempted during sessions for Common Courtesy, but the group weren't happy with it. With help from Stevenson, the group resolved the problems they had with the track. [...] "Same About You", written by McKinnon, Westfall, Skaff and drummer Alex Shelnutt, talks about a person who <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> <b>something,</b> which causes you to look at them differently. [...] "Turn Off the Radio", written by McKinnon, Westfall, Wade and Skaff, was another song that was intended for Common Courtesy.

5000|$|Determination. A sign {{depends on}} its object {{in such a way}} as to {{represent}} its object — the object enables and, in a sense, determines the sign. A physically causal sense of this stands out especially when a sign consists in an indicative reaction. The interpretant depends likewise on both the sign and the object — the object determines the sign to determine the interpretant. But this determination is not a succession of dyadic events, like a row of toppling dominoes; sign determination is triadic. For example, an interpretant does not merely represent something which represented an object; instead an interpretant represents something as a sign representing an object. It is an informational kind of determination, a rendering of something more determinately representative. Peirce used the word [...] "determine" [...] not in strictly deterministic sense, but in a sense of [...] "specializes", bestimmt, involving variation in measure, like an influence. Peirce came to define sign, object, and interpretant by their (triadic) mode of determination, not by the idea of representation, since that is part of what is being defined. The object determines the sign to determine another sign — the interpretant — to be related to the object as the sign is related to the object, hence the interpretant, fulfilling its function as sign of the object, determines a further interpretant sign. The process is logically structured to perpetuate itself, and is definitive of sign, object, and interpretant in general. In semiosis, every sign is an interpretant in a chain stretching both fore and aft. The relation of informational or logical determination which constrains object, sign, and interpretant is more general than the special cases of causal or physical determination. In general terms, any information about one of the items in the sign relation <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> <b>something</b> about the others, although the actual amount of this information may be nil in some species of sign relations.|$|E
40|$|For {{more than}} four decades, I have been {{studying}} human memory. My research concerns the malleable nature of memory. Information suggested to an individual about an event can be integrated with {{the memory of the}} event itself, so that what actually occurred, and what was discussed later about what may have occurred, become inextricably interwoven, allowing distortion, elaboration, and even total fabrication. In my writings, classes, and public speeches, I've tried to convey one important take-home message: Just because someone <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> <b>something</b> in great detail, with much confidence, and with emotion, it doesn't mean that it is true. Here I describe my professional life as an experimental psychologist, in which I've eavesdropped on this process, as well as many personal experiences that may have influenced my thinking and choices...|$|E
40|$|It {{should come}} as no revelation that {{statistics}} is one subject that raises anxiety goosebumps on psychology students ' bodies. In many cases, the mere thought of taking a statistics course is sufficient to make one feel ill. It is easy to blame students for these problems, citing such reasons as inadequate math preparation and poor study habits as the major culprits. Certainly, there is substantial informal evidence to back up such claims. However, students are not the only culprits in this common scenario. The quality of statistical instruction, and the quality of statistical books, also share some blame in this regard. Recently, Roberts and Kunst (1990) attempted to make a case for the discontinuance of the use of the Spearman rank-order correlation formula and, other than historical mentions, references to the Spearman rank-order correlation. It was argued that continued use of the Spearman correlation not only encourages claiming that a Spearman correlation is being calculated when in fact it actually is a Pearson coefficient, but also fosters the belief that the Spearman correlation <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> <b>something</b> that the Pearson correlation does not.

40|$|Emergency Medicine welcomes an {{ever-increasing}} number of submissions while maintaining an acceptance level well below {{half of all}} submitted manuscripts, [1] meaning that the number and quality of submitted papers are increasing. As has been stated in the past, [2] the editors endorse a number of guidelines {{in order to improve}} presentation and style as well as adherence to current standards in publishing. Notably, all papers submitted to the SJTREM and potentially deemed suitable for publication will undergo peer-review from at least 2 (and often more) referees before making a final decision to accept or reject. Due to an increasing number of case reports, the decision to immediately reject those deemed unsuitable for the SJTREM has become more rigorous. The SJTREM wishes to maintain a main focus on original articles, review articles and solicited commentaries to selected studies. While peer-review is currently the best, yet however an imperfect, controversial and, sometimes a misused tool for vesting the scholarly work performed by others [3 - 5], the editors maintain their right to finally decide whether or not a paper should be published in the SJTREM. Indeed, to paraphrase the recent Lancet editorial by Richard Horton [6] “ [...] . peer review is indispensable [...] . but we also know that it is widely misunderstood. Peer review is not the absolute or final arbiter of scientific quality [...] . it does not test the validity of a piece of research. It does not guarantee truth.

40|$|Imagine {{you leave}} this lecture hall, some mean looking guys dressed entirely in black follow, kidnap {{and take you}} to the medieval castle of Nideggen in the close-by Eifel mountains. There you are being thrown into a pitch dark dungeon. You cannot see anything, but you hear some noises. Are there rats? Are there other prisoners? Are there dragons? Luckily you {{remember}} that you have some matches in your pocket. You light a match, you can see everything around you and everything becomes clear to you… What I have just described is essentially like a scattering experiment: figuratively it sheds light into darkness and helps us understand the world around us. Let’s analyse what you did in the dungeon: first when you light the match, you start a source of radiation. Here the radiation is light. This light then gets scattered (reflected, transmitted) from the surrounding objects. In a scientific scattering experiment, we will call this object a “sample”. Back to the dungeon: some of this radiation gets scattered into your eye. Your eye serves as very special radiation detector: with its lens, it is able to even make an image of the objects on the retina, which in the language of a physicist would be called an “area position sensitive pixel detector”. This image contains lots of information: the colour of the backscattered light <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> <b>something</b> about the absorption of certain components of the light and therefore gives information about the material the light is scattered from. The position of the signal on the retina gives you information about the spatial arrangement of the objects around you. And finally the time dependence of the signal tells you that the monster is actually crawling towards you, ready to attack. All this information has to be treated and interpreted. This is done by our brain, an extremely powerful computer to analyse this wealth of data [...] . ...|$|E
