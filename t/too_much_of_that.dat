25|$|The {{existence}} of a tax can increase economic efficiency in some cases. If there is a negative externality associated with a good, meaning that it has negative effects not felt by the consumer, then a free market will trade <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> good. By taxing the good, the government can increase overall welfare as well as raising revenue. This type of tax is called a Pigovian tax, after economist Arthur Pigou.|$|E
500|$|The final lines {{spoken by}} Chang {{before he is}} obliterated by torpedo fire are lifted from Hamlet's famous soliloquy: [...] "to be, or not to be..." [...] Flinn was {{initially}} unsure about the numerous classical quotations, but when Plummer was cast, Meyer enthusiastically added more. He said, [...] "Whether it's pretentious or not, I {{think it depends on}} how it's used. [...] I don't quite agree with using <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> sort of thing, but once you get Plummer, suddenly it's working." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to series {{producer}} Janet Carr, {{making the}} show was [...] "an immense challenge, but... great fun". In response to receiving a Lizzie Award, she said, [...] "Being acknowledged like {{this is just the}} icing on the cake. We have a very small, hardworking team, and this award is dedicated to everyone who has helped make Good Game the show that it is." [...] Bajo has said, [...] "There's lots of late nights for all of us, so the show receiving these awards has been really uplifting." [...] In fact, the show has explained via their Facebook page that the cast and crew have sometimes had all-nighters in order to wrap up episodes in time for their broadcast dates. Bajo explained, [...] "It's such a team effort [...] it would be unprofessional and incorrect to take <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> kudos... I think we're our own worst and best critics... we know if something worked or if it didn't so we're always trying new things." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Don't think <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> first impressions. <b>That</b> was {{my mistake}} when I arrived here. Good-by. I'll go now. Better rest awhile. You look tired." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{smiled a}} little doubtfully. [...] "You won't expect <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> me in <b>that</b> way, will you?" [...] he asked. [...] "My afternoons, for instance, are nearly always occupied." ...|$|R
60|$|Bib. I had <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> last night; I was {{a little}} disguised, as they say.|$|E
60|$|LORD CAVERSHAM. Oh, damn sympathy. There is a {{great deal}} <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> sort of thing going on nowadays.|$|E
60|$|Rod. I have <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>Of</b> <b>that</b> I would not, love; And what I would have, that I want, revenge. I must be set ashore.|$|E
50|$|I was {{a basket}} case when I left! I'd already had <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> it. <b>That</b> kind <b>of</b> work suits some people, but it didn't suit me. It was my {{decision}} to leave and I was desperate, really desperate, to go. Because I knew I was good at comedy {{and there was no}} way that Valerie Barlow was ever going to be funny.|$|R
6000|$|... "There was <b>too</b> <b>much</b> truth back <b>of</b> <b>that</b> arrow not to wound," [...] said Theophilus Thoro, who was ensconced, as usual, in {{his dark}} corner, whence he supervises our discussions.|$|R
60|$|Stated very simply, it was this: Mr. Rasselyer-Brown drank. It was {{not meant}} {{that he was a}} {{drunkard}} or that he drank <b>too</b> <b>much,</b> or anything <b>of</b> <b>that</b> sort. He drank. That was all.|$|R
6000|$|... "Guess we don't {{think much}} {{of that kind of}} thing here," [...] says the Yankee. [...] "There's a deal <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> coin in circulation." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well--I {{could hardly}} say inventorially like that. <b>Too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> {{sort of thing}} {{certainly}} would make me dislike a woman. But let us confine our attention to ourselves, not go thinking of might have beens.' ...|$|E
6000|$|INSPECTOR. In my experience, you {{can never}} have <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>that.</b> [To WINSOR] I {{understand}} there's a lady in the room on this side [pointing Left] and a gentleman on this [pointing Right] Were they in their rooms? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I shall; {{that is to}} say, I mean it. I {{was advised}} {{not to be in}} <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> a hurry; <b>that</b> is to say, I thought it best to let her settle down a little after her first seeing me." ...|$|R
5000|$|There are {{conflicting}} {{requirements for}} scavenging: On one side, enough fresh charge {{needs to be}} introduced in each cycle to displace almost all the combustion gases but introducing <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> it means <b>that</b> a part <b>of</b> it gets in the exhaust.|$|R
6000|$|... "Right; you're right, {{or nearly}} so," [...] replied Harold; [...] "but don't {{you think the}} word savours <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> perfection, seeing <b>that</b> breakfast would add to the {{pleasure}} of the present delightful state of things, and make them even more sailumterracious than they are?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{daughter}} is dear to me, madam," [...] said Foster gruffly; [...] "and I desire {{not that she}} should get the court-tricks of lying and 'scaping--somewhat <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> has she learned already, an it please your ladyship." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, not yet," [...] {{answered}} his wife. [...] "I {{have had the}} dressmaker here with my new dress for the duchess's ball to-morrow; it's lovely, but I {{think that there is}} a little <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> creamy lace about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you take}} his part? I {{can tell you}} this. If I drank <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> {{poisonous}} French stuff, Mountjoy set me the example. He was tipsy--as you call it--shamefully tipsy, I give you my word of honour. What's the matter now?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is well," [...] {{said the}} Countess; [...] "and, to do you justice, Julian, you are seldom a truant neglecter of {{appointed}} hours, though, {{like the rest}} of the youth of this age, you sometimes suffer your sports to consume <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> time <b>that</b> should be spent otherwise. But for your friend Philip, he is an avowed contemner of good order, and seems to find pleasure in wasting time, even when he does not enjoy it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! I don't know," [...] I {{answered}} calmly. [...] "We are all {{the slaves}} of opportunity. Lord Polloch very courteously, but with little apparent effort, has {{made me feel like}} a fool. Perhaps I am one! Perhaps Lord Polloch is <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> an Englishman. <b>That</b> remains to be discovered." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I am not afraid,” {{the sailor}} retorted, a slight angry flush rising through his sunburn. “If I speak not fast, {{it is because}} I have not been from the old country as long as you. You do not like me because I am <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> a man; <b>that</b> is why, sir.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'That was she,' {{repeated}} the young man. 'After what I {{have heard from}} Pecksniff, I {{have no doubt that}} she came and went with my grandfather.--Don't you drink <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> sour wine, or you'll have a fit of some sort, Pinch, I see.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{understand}} precisely," [...] said Raybold, nodding {{his head}} sagaciously; [...] "of her own sex. Yes, I see your drift, and I agree with you absolutely. There is a little <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> thing over there, and I don't wonder you are annoyed." ...|$|E
60|$|TWISDEN. Yes! Mrs. Dedmond! There's {{the bedrock}} difficulty. As you haven't money, {{you should never}} have been pretty. You're up against the world, and you'll get no mercy from it.

5000|$|IGN said [...] "This {{is a great}} {{little space}} shooter for $2. I like the weapon {{upgrades}} and different formations.

Still, it's a worthy addition to your shooter library." ...|$|R
60|$|But {{now they}} were in a new danger, for they were afraid <b>of</b> eating <b>too</b> <b>much,</b> even <b>of</b> <b>that</b> little we gave them. The mate or {{commander}} brought six men with him in his boat, but these poor wretches looked like skeletons, and were so weak they could hardly sit to their oars; the mate himself was very ill, and half-starved, for he declared he had reserved nothing from the men, and went share and share alike with them in every bit they ate.|$|R
50|$|He {{survived the}} war {{after a year}} of {{dysentery}} and malaria, curing himself chewing leaves of cocaine introduced by the Bolivian prisoners. But his survival was not just to his courage, fortitude or luck, but to his writing skills.

6000|$|... "He wasn't in {{the right}} one to-day," [...] said the Squire. This was still a little loud. There was <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> {{buoyancy}} which might have come from drink; but which, with the Squire, was the effect of that success {{for which he had}} been longing rather than hoping all his life.|$|E
6000|$|He didn't laugh; I hadn't {{seen him}} laugh, at Newmarch, once; he was continuously, portentously grave, and I at present remembered how {{the effect of}} this had told for me at luncheon, contrasted as it was with that of Mrs. Server's desperate, {{exquisite}} levity. [...] "You know I decidedly have <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> dreadful old woman?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come on deck!" [...] growled his comrade; [...] "you have drunk <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> confounded brandy-and-water. It has {{loosened}} your tongue. Come away!"

5000|$|... "Cameron {{confesses to}} a weariness with poetry’s old forms and old concerns, {{particularly}} the perennial Romantic subjects {{of love and}} {{the exploration of the}} self. … One admires his determination to reject the pretension and obscurantism that winds its way around <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the poetry <b>that</b> crosses one’s desk these days."

50|$|Stephenson's {{voice was}} {{frequently}} used and often most remembered {{for his work}} on Jonny Quest.
