Enderlin argued that the cameraman had not said the boy was dead, but that he was dying. A report prepared for the court by Jean-Claude Schlinger, a ballistics expert commissioned by Karsenty, said that had the shots come from the Israeli position, Muhammad would have been hit in the lower limbs only.|$|E
5|$|Lowell did {{not know}} what {{vocation}} to choose after graduating, and he vacillated among business, the ministry, medicine, and law.

During this time, he was admittedly depressed and often had suicidal thoughts. He once confided to a friend that he held a cocked pistol <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>forehead</b> and considered killing himself at the age of 20.|$|E

Ritchie had not initially been recommended for this award; the recommendation being submitted at a later date by an unidentified figure in the Admiralty. Snelling speculates that the Admiralty's change of heart was possibly a morale boosting measure, although Ritchie's courage during the action was never called into question. The shrapnel and bullet wounds he sustained in the raid were extensive, including injuries <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>forehead,</b> left thumb, left arm (twice), right arm, right hip and a badly broken right leg after being hit by two large calibre machine gun bullets.|$|E

2500|$|Nyren {{described}} Harris' {{style and}} technique in some detail. Harris began from an erect stance [...] "like a soldier at drill" [...] {{and raised the}} ball <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>forehead</b> before stepping forward.

2500|$|This is {{generally}} done {{by using a}} physical representation of a trader's intentions with his hands. [...] If a trader wants to buy ten contracts at a price of eight, for example, in the pit he would yell [...] "8 for 10", stating price before quantity, and turn his palm inward toward his face, putting his index finger <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>forehead</b> denoting ten; {{if he were to}} be buying one, he would place his index finger on his chin. [...] If the trader wants to sell five contracts at a price of eight, they would yell [...] "5 at 8", stating quantity before price, and show one hand with palm facing outward, showing 5 fingers. [...] The combination of hand-signals and vocal representation between the way a trader expresses bids and offers is a protection against misinterpretation by other market participants. For historical purposes, an illustrated project to record the hand signal language used in CBOT's trading pits has been compiled and published.|$|E

2500|$|Two days later, on 27 July, Latham made {{a second}} attempt {{to cross the}} Channel. He was within minutes of {{arriving}} {{in the vicinity of}} Dover when engine failure again forced him into the sea. [...] This time he could not control the angle of descent as well as he had in his first attempt and when he hit the water he seriously damaged the aircraft and suffered severe lacerations <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>forehead.</b> Although no definitive cause of engine failure for this second attempt was found, two possibilities were put forward. [...] One is that the innovative fuel-injection system became clogged due to unfiltered fuel. Aviation pioneer Gabriel Voisin, who used Antoinette engines in his own planes, posited another possibility which he argued was also the cause of Latham's first failure: [...] "The Antoinette V-8 [...] furnished a significant fraction less of its power after running more than 15 minutes. It was this problem that provoked Latham's fall into the sea." ...|$|E
2500|$|We do {{not know}} {{anything}} about them, except some work in the LEP.

Also, as Root was in the terminal {{on his way to}} Fowl Manor, the attendant is being mobbed by a large amount of gremlins. [...] It's also possible that in the graphic novel a gremlin is seen attaching an arm patch to Root as they prepare to head to Fowl Manor. They have also been mentioned when Commander Root slapped at a paramedic gremlin who was applying burn salve <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>forehead</b> after being burnt on a whaling ship in book one page 123. Gremlin could also be another name for goblin as gremlins only appear in the first book. It Is also likely that they are related to goblins, but more intelligent.|$|E

Hortense asks Cole to sit so she can complete a portrait of him she has started and he visits her studio once. He learns that Carolyn has published two sonnets in tribute to him and is at a loss how to respond: [...] "Cope put his hand wearily <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>forehead.</b> The arts were a curse.

They make up with Cope's arm around Arthur's shoulder, Arthur pressing Cope's hand with his own.|$|E
