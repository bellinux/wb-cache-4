5|$|Incumbent Prime Minister Kiviniemi {{said that}} she was ready to work with any party in Finland.

5|$|A {{limitation}} of the radial velocity method used to detect 47 Ursae Majoris b is that only a lower limit on the planet's mass can be obtained. Preliminary astrometric measurements made by the Hipparcos satellite suggest the planet's orbit is inclined at an angle of 63.1° to {{the plane of the}} sky, which would imply a true mass 12% greater than the lower limit determined by radial velocity measurements. However, subsequent investigation of the data reduction techniques used suggests that the Hipparcos measurements are not precise enough to adequately characterise the orbits of substellar companions, and <b>the</b> <b>true</b> inclination of the orbit (and hence <b>the</b> <b>true</b> mass) are regarded as unknown.|$|E
