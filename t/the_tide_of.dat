5|$|Ghosts of Onyx {{takes place}} in the 26th century, where humanity, {{under the auspices of the}} United Nations Space Command, has {{developed}} faster-than-light travel and colonized hundreds of worlds. Without warning, an alien collective known as the Covenant attacks the outer human colony of Harvest. The Covenant begin to hunt down human colonies, vitrifying the surface of each world. Humanity's best weapon against the technologically superior Covenant are the SPARTAN-IIs, supersoldiers equipped with powerful armor; unfortunately, there are too few of the SPARTANs to turn <b>the</b> <b>tide</b> <b>of</b> the war.|$|E
5|$|In February 1217, Louis {{set sail}} for France to gather reinforcements. In his absence, {{arguments}} broke out between Louis' French and English followers, and Cardinal Guala declared that Henry's {{war against the}} rebels {{was the equivalent of}} a religious crusade. This declaration resulted in a series of defections from the rebel movement, and <b>the</b> <b>tide</b> <b>of</b> the conflict swung in Henry's favour. Louis returned at the end of April, but his northern forces were defeated by William Marshal at the Battle of Lincoln in May.|$|E

5|$|The decisive {{victory of}} Lieutenant-General Bernard Montgomery's Eighth Army over the Germans and Italians at the Second Battle of El Alamein in October–November 1942 turned <b>the</b> <b>tide</b> <b>of</b> the North African war {{strongly}} {{in favour of}} the Allies, and did much to revive Allied morale.

5|$|The {{fight at}} P'ohang-dong {{was the final}} {{breaking}} point for North Korean units already {{on the verge of}} exhaustion from continuous combat. North Korean supply lines were overextended to the point of breaking down, causing a collapse in resupply that is seen as a primary factor in turning <b>the</b> <b>tide</b> <b>of</b> the battle. Moreover, U.S. air superiority was also crucial to the engagement, since repeated bombing runs by U.S. aircraft prevented North Korean ground forces from reaching and holding their objectives.|$|E
5|$|The first combat {{involving}} battlecruisers during World War I was the Battle of Heligoland Bight in August 1914. A {{force of}} British light cruisers and destroyers entered the Heligoland Bight (the {{part of the}} North Sea closest to Hamburg) to attack German destroyer patrols. When they met opposition from light cruisers, Vice Admiral David Beatty took his squadron of five battlecruisers into the Bight and turned <b>the</b> <b>tide</b> <b>of</b> the battle, ultimately sinking three German light cruisers and killing their commander, Rear Admiral Leberecht Maass.|$|E

5|$|Having decisively won {{the battle}} and once again turned <b>the</b> <b>tide</b> <b>of</b> the war {{in favor of the}} Communists, the Battle of the Ch'ongch'on River {{represented}} the peak of the Chinese military's performance in Korea. However, Mao interpreted the UN ceasefire as a weakness that China should further exploit. Against advice from Peng and other senior military leaders, Mao ordered the PVA to invade South Korea—a mission that was beyond the Chinese military's abilities while breaking the fragile Chinese supply lines. Recognizing the Chinese difficulties, Ridgway then led the Eighth Army to inflict severe losses on the PVA during the Chinese offensives of 1951.|$|E
5|$|In 1576, Stefan Batory became King of Poland {{as well as}} Grand Duke of Lithuania {{and turned}} <b>the</b> <b>tide</b> <b>of</b> the war with his successes between 1578 and 1581, {{including}} the joint Swedish–Polish–Lithuanian offensive at the Battle of Wenden. This was followed by an extended campaign through Russia culminating in the long and difficult siege of Pskov. Under the 1582 Truce of Jam Zapolski, which ended the war between Russia and Poland–Lithuania, Russia lost all its former holdings in Livonia and Polotsk to Poland–Lithuania. The following year, Sweden and Russia signed the Truce of Plussa with Sweden gaining most of Ingria and northern Livonia while retaining the Duchy of Estonia.|$|E
5|$|In August 1814, British forces {{attacked}} Washington, D.C. {{and burned}} the White House. Congress formed {{a committee to}} investigate the circumstances that allowed Washington to be captured. Johnson chaired this committee, and delivered its final report. After the sacking of Washington, <b>the</b> <b>tide</b> <b>of</b> battle turned against the British, and the Treaty of Ghent ended the war even as Johnson prepared to return to Kentucky to raise another military unit. With {{the end of the}} war, he turned his legislative attention to issues such as securing pensions for widows and orphans and funding internal improvements in the West.|$|E

5|$|In January 2012 Cricket Ireland chief {{executive}} Warren Deutrom publicly declared Ireland's ambition to play Test cricket by 2020. Their desire to achieve Test status {{was in part}} to stem <b>the</b> <b>tide</b> <b>of</b> Irish players using residency rules to switch to England {{for the opportunity to}} play Test cricket. Deutrom outlined the ambition as he unveiled the new strategic plan for Irish cricket to 2015. The plan set out a series of stretching goals including increasing the number of participants in the game to 50,000, setting a target of reaching 8th in the World rankings, establishing a domestic first-class cricket structure, and reinforcing cricket as the fifth most popular team sport in Ireland.|$|E
5|$|In the oil platform, Chris and Piers head underground, {{managing}} to free Jake and Sherry from captivity before preventing a large-scale attack by a gigantic bioweapon called Haos from the location. Heavily wounded, {{and in a}} desperate attempt to save Chris, Piers injects himself with a sample of the C-virus to help turn <b>the</b> <b>tide</b> <b>of</b> the battle, temporarily defeating Haos before evacuating. Aware that the mutation would worsen, Piers sacrifices himself by pushing Chris to an escape pod. After Chris' pod is launched, Haos makes one last attempt to kill Chris but is killed himself by a powerful lightning charge from Piers, which ensures Chris' escape and the destruction of the Neo-Umbrella base. At the same time, Jake and Sherry escape the facility pursued relentlessly by Ustanak, eventually {{managing to}} kill him as they ride a rocket-powered lift back to the surface.|$|E
5|$|In {{the visual}} arts, the Hudson River School was a mid-19th-century {{movement}} {{in the tradition of}} European naturalism. The realist paintings of Thomas Eakins are now widely celebrated. The 1913 Armory Show in New York City, an exhibition of European modernist art, shocked the public and transformed the U.S. art scene. Georgia O'Keeffe, Marsden Hartley, and others experimented with new, individualistic styles. Major artistic movements such as the abstract expressionism of Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning and the pop art of Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein developed largely in the United States. <b>The</b> <b>tide</b> <b>of</b> modernism and then postmodernism has brought fame to American architects such as Frank Lloyd Wright, Philip Johnson, and Frank Gehry. Americans have long been important in the modern artistic medium of photography, with major photographers including Alfred Stieglitz, Edward Steichen, and Ansel Adams.|$|E

5|$|Reviewers {{noted the}} quality and craft {{that went into the}} compilation's design. Jaz Rignall (USgamer) was {{impressed}} by the compilation's presentation and balance between frills and efficiency, and Dan Whitehead (Eurogamer) felt that the theatrical theme fit Rare's character. Reviewers considered Rare Replay a high-water mark for video game compilations—Kotaku called it the best since Valve's The Orange Box. On the other hand, Jeremy Parish (USgamer) found the contemporaneous Mega Man Legacy Collection Criterion Collection-style presentation to be a more authentic appreciation of its original material. Chris Plante (The Verge) saw Rare Replay slight hardware improvements and added touches as a viable model for putting retrogames back on the market and slowing <b>the</b> <b>tide</b> <b>of</b> unlicensed downloads.|$|E
5|$|Slessor held several {{operational}} commands in the Second World War. As Air Officer Commanding Coastal Command in 1943 and 1944, he {{was credited}} with doing much to turn <b>the</b> <b>tide</b> <b>of</b> the Battle of the Atlantic through his use of long-range bombers against German U-boats. He was knighted in June 1943. In the closing stages of the war he became Commander-in-Chief RAF Mediterranean and Middle East and deputy to Lieutenant General Ira Eaker as Commander-in-Chief Mediterranean Allied Air Forces, conducting operations in the Italian Campaign and Yugoslavia. Slessor went on {{to serve in the}} RAF's most senior post, Chief of the Air Staff, in the early 1950s, and was considered a strong proponent of strategic bombing and the nuclear deterrent. In retirement he published two more books, including an autobiography, and held ceremonial appointments in Somerset.|$|E
5|$|The ACLU {{offices on}} the West Coast {{had been more}} {{directly}} involved in addressing <b>the</b> <b>tide</b> <b>of</b> anti-Japanese prejudice from the start, as they were geographically closer to the issue, and were already working on cases challenging the exclusion by this time. The Seattle office, assisting in Gordon Hirabayashi's lawsuit, created an unaffiliated committee to continue the work the ACLU had started, while in Los Angeles, attorney A.L. Wirin continued to represent Ernest Kinzo Wakayama but without addressing the case's constitutional questions. (Wirin would lose private clients because of his defense of Wakayama and other Japanese Americans.) However, the San Francisco branch, led by Ernest Besig, refused to discontinue its support for Fred Korematsu, whose case had been taken on prior to the June 22 directive, and attorney Wayne Collins, with Besig's full support, centered his defense on the illegality of Korematsu's exclusion.|$|E

5|$|The Great Depression {{provided}} a political opportunity for Hitler. Germans were ambivalent about the parliamentary republic, which faced challenges from right- and left-wing extremists. The moderate political parties were increasingly unable to stem <b>the</b> <b>tide</b> <b>of</b> extremism, and the German referendum of 1929 helped to elevate Nazi ideology. The elections of September 1930 {{resulted in the}} break-up of a grand coalition and its replacement with a minority cabinet. Its leader, chancellor Heinrich Brüning of the Centre Party, governed through emergency decrees from President Paul von Hindenburg. Governance by decree became the new norm and {{paved the way for}} authoritarian forms of government. The NSDAP rose from obscurity to win 18.3 percent of the vote and 107 parliamentary seats in the 1930 election, becoming the second-largest party in parliament.|$|E

5|$|The {{rebellion}} {{was initially}} successful: the rebels defeated the royal army at Gegodog (1676), captured {{most of the}} Javanese north coast, and took the Mataram capital Plered (1677). King Amangkurat I died during the retreat of the royal court. His son and successor, Amangkurat II, requested help from the VOC in exchange for financial remuneration and geopolitical concessions. The VOC's subsequent involvement turned <b>the</b> <b>tide</b> <b>of</b> the war. VOC and Mataram forces recovered lost territories and overran Trunajaya's new capital at Kediri (1678). However, the rebellion continued until the capture of Trunajaya {{at the end of}} 1679, and the defeat, death, or surrender of the other rebel leaders (1679–1680). Trunajaya was killed by AmangkuratII personally in 1680 while a prisoner of the VOC.|$|E
