5|$|The Łódź insurrection, {{also known}} as the June Days, was an {{uprising}} by Polish workers in Łódź against the Russian Empire between 21–25 June 1905. This event was one of the largest disturbances in the Russian-controlled Congress Poland during the Russian Revolution of 1905. Poland was a major center of revolutionary fighting in the Russian Empire in 1905–1907, and the Łódź insurrection was a key incident in <b>those</b> <b>events.</b>|$|E

He {{is the youngest}} player to achieve the career Grand Slam, and the youngest and fastest to win 50 tournaments on tour. Additionally, Woods {{is only the second}} golfer (after Nicklaus) to have achieved a career Grand Slam three times. Woods has won 18 World Golf Championships, and won at least one of <b>those</b> <b>events</b> in each of the first 11 years after they began in 1999.

5|$|In February 1965 Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin {{travelled}} to Hanoi {{to rebuild}} Soviet ties with North Vietnam, {{and the formation}} of a military alliance was on the agenda. Coincidentally, senior security adviser to the U.S. President McGeorge Bundy was also in Saigon to report on the political chaos in South Vietnam. In the shadow of <b>those</b> <b>events,</b> the Viet Cong 409th Battalion staged an attack on Camp Holloway on 7 February 1965. This time, with his victory in the 1964 presidential election secured, Johnson decided to launch Operation Flaming Dart which entailed strikes on North Vietnamese military targets. However, with Kosygin still in Hanoi during the U.S bombing, the Soviet government decided to step up their military aid to North Vietnam, thereby signalling a major reversal of Khrushchev's policy in Vietnam.|$|E

5|$|In boxing, judo, taekwondo and wrestling, two bronze medals {{are awarded}} in each weight class. Therefore, {{the total number}} of bronze medals is greater than {{the total number of}} gold or silver medals. An {{exception}} was the men's 84kg Greco-Roman wrestling, where Ara Abrahamian was stripped of his medal due to his conduct during the medal ceremony. Additionally there was a tie for the silver medal in the women's 100 metres in athletics and no bronze was awarded. Ties for third in swimming's men's 100 metre backstroke and men's 100 metre freestyle meant that two bronze medals were awarded for <b>those</b> <b>events.</b>|$|E
5|$|Russia invaded Poland {{to ensure}} {{the defeat of the}} Polish reforms, with no overt goal of another {{partition}} (it viewed Poland as its protectorate, and saw little need to give up chunks of Poland to other countries). Frederick William II of Prussia, however, saw <b>those</b> <b>events</b> as an opportunity to strengthen his country. Frederick demanded from Catherine that for his country's abandoning Poland as a close ally, and for Prussian participation in the War of the First Coalition against revolutionary France. Because Russia had encouraged Prussian participation, and Prussia had recently suffered a major defeat at the Battle of Valmy), Prussia should be compensated – preferably with parts of the Polish territory. Russia soon decided to accept the Prussian offer.|$|E

5|$|The Hawaii {{football}} team normally receives an automatic bid {{to the game}} unless the team is selected {{to participate in a}} BCS game or is not bowl eligible.

In 2007, Hawaii was selected to play on January 1, 2008 in the Sugar Bowl against Georgia, marking just the second time since the creation of the Hawaii Bowl that Hawaii would not participate. The only previous time that Hawaii failed to make an appearance was in 2005, when the Warriors finished their season with a 5–7 record and were not eligible for a bowl game.|$|E
5|$|The royalist armies {{that stayed}} in the Peruvian {{countryside}} headed to Lima, led by Canterac. In a confusing episode, there was no battle, as neither one attacked. Canterac changed his path to El Callao, took resources from it, {{and returned to his}} base. There was no battle during their return either. Without resources, El Callao surrendered in a few days. Both armies took inadvisable actions: San Martín allowed Canterac to receive reinforcements, and Canterac left a key military objective incapable to resist. There is no known documentation that provides a reasonable explanation of <b>those</b> <b>events.</b>|$|E

However, while the novel does reflect true events, it is not a completely authentic re-telling of <b>those</b> <b>event.</b> Bugul uses her own experiences to shape the narrative, but the story is not a chronological re-telling of the events. The book is crafted in a way that the reader can understand a clear narrative and understand the effects of post-colonialism on a young Senegalese woman living in diaspora.|$|R

5|$|There {{has been}} limited debate on {{the place of the}} Holocaust in Lithuanian {{national}} memory; historically Lithuanians have denied national participation in the Holocaust or labeled the Lithuanian participants in genocide as fringe extreme elements. The memories of that time and the discussion of <b>those</b> <b>events</b> in Jewish and Lithuanian historiographies are quite different, although Lithuanian historiography {{in the past two decades}} has improved, compared to the Soviet historiography, with the works of scholars such as Alfonsas Eidintas, Valentinas Brandišauskas and Arūnas Bubnys, among others, being positively reviewed by the Western and Jewish historians. The issue remains controversial to this day. According to Lithuanian historians, the contentious issues involve the role of the Lithuanian Activist Front, the Lithuanian Provisional Government and participation of Lithuanian civilians and volunteers in the Holocaust.|$|E
5|$|This {{discrepancy}} is {{also caused}} by ties. In men's artistic gymnastics, a three-way tie {{for the gold}} medal in the horizontal bar meant that no silver and bronze medals were awarded; in the pommel horse, rings and parallel bars ties for first positions resulted in two golds per event, and thus no silvers were awarded; and a tie for silver in the individual all-around resulted in no bronze being awarded. In women's artistic gymnastics, ties for {{the gold medal in}} the uneven bars and floor meant that no silvers were awarded for <b>those</b> <b>events.</b> In athletics, a three-way tie in the men's high jump, and ties in the men's 3,000m steeplechase and the women's high jump for second place meant that no bronzes were awarded for <b>those</b> <b>events.</b> In men's bowling, a tie for second place in the singles and trios resulted in two silver medals per event, and thus no bronzes were awarded; a tie for the bronze-medal position in the doubles and the team of five meant that two bronzes were awarded for each event. In softball, due to rainy weather at the final competition the ranking was decided by the results of the preliminary round and semifinals. Japan was awarded the gold medal based on its unbeaten record in the preliminary games; China and Chinese Taipei shared the silver. Those two were to have played to decide who would meet Japan in the gold-medal game. In swimming, a tie for first position in the men's 50m freestyle resulted in two gold medals and no silver was awarded; a tie for second position in the women's 100m freestyle meant that no bronze medal was awarded.|$|E

Over time, <b>those</b> <b>events</b> evolved into: economics, essay, fine arts, interview, language and literature, math, science, social sciences, speech and Super Quiz. It was not until 1998 that fine arts was split into its two constituent tests: art and music. Due to this division, the Super Quiz took the place {{of one of the}} other subjects each year. In 1998, Super Quiz replaced economics; from 1999 until 2012, it replaced either science or social science and alternated replacing the two from 2003 to 2012. Beginning with the 2013 season, the Super Quiz consisted of a relay portion only, encompassing questions from the respective year's Science, Language and Literature, Music, Social Science, Art, and Economics curriculum.|$|E

In response, the 5th Special Forces Headquarters ordered Captain Eugene Makowski to fly to Khâm Đức, where he would assume command of the 12th Mobile Strike Force Company, to reinforce White's beleaguered soldiers at Ngok Tavak. Then, just before sunrise, Colonel Trí ordered the 40th Battalion to pull out of Ngok Tavak in order to deal with an enemy relief force, and leave behind only a blocking force to hold the captured positions inside the garrison. Following <b>those</b> <b>events,</b> Australian Warrant Officers Cameron and Lucas mounted a counter-attack using a handful of Nung soldiers in an attempt to retake captured positions. At that point, those Marines who had survived the main battle decided to join the fight, and as the Australian-led formation moved through the Ngok Tavak garrison, they gradually pushed the last remaining enemy soldiers beyond the defensive perimeter.|$|E
