25|$|The fan and {{fly-whisk}} are items used {{to comfort}} and cool, an important accessory for a divine king {{especially in a}} tropical country. The Royal Fan (พัดวาลวิชนี) was created by order of King Rama I. The fan is gilded with gold, the handle enamelled in green and red. Traditionally a fan was made by bending a <b>talipot</b> palm's frond at a right angle; the royal fan mimics this traditional form. The Royal Fly-whisk of the yak's tail (พระแส้หางจามรี) {{was made in the}} reign of King Rama IV to augment the five items of the regalia. Evidently associated with the same idea of divine comfort as the fan, it is actually derived from the ancient chāmara of India. According to tradition, the fly-whisk was used by the king to repel any maleficent forces that might bring discomfort to his subjects. The hair on the royal fly-whisk has since been replaced by those of a white elephant.|$|E
60|$|We {{embarked}} {{again at}} Chittagong on the 16th of January, at 10 p.m., for Calcutta, {{in a very}} large vessel, rowed by twelve men: we made wretchedly slow progress, for the reasons mentioned earlier, being for four days within sight of Chittagong! On the 20th we only reached Sidhee, and thence made a stretch to Hattiah, an island which {{may be said to}} be moving bodily to the westward, the Megna annually cutting many acres from the east side; and the tide-wave depositing mud on the west. The surface is flat, and raised four feet above mean high-water level; the tide rises about 14 feet up the bank, and then retires for miles; the total rise and fall is, however, much less here than in the Fenny, higher up the gulf. The turf is composed of Cynodon and a Fimbristylis; and the earth being impregnated with salt, supports different kinds of Chenopodium. Two kinds of tamarisk, and a thorny Cassia and Exoecaria, are the only shrubs on the eastern islands; on the central ones a few dwarf mangroves appear, with the holly-leaved Dilivaria, dwarf screw-pine (Pandanus), a shrub of Compositae, and a curious fern, a variety of Aristichum aureum. Towards the northern end of Hattiah, <b>Talipot,</b> cocoa-nut and date-palms appear.|$|E
50|$|Amorphophallus titanum, {{also known}} as the titan arum, is a {{flowering}} plant with the largest unbranched inflorescence in the world. The titan arum's inflorescence is not as large as that of the <b>talipot</b> palm, Corypha umbraculifera, but the inflorescence of the <b>talipot</b> palm is branched rather than unbranched.|$|E
5000|$|Corypha umbraculifera L. - <b>Talipot</b> Palm - Sri Lanka, {{southern}} India; naturalized in Thailand, Cambodia, Myanmar, Andaman Islands ...|$|E
50|$|The <b>talipot</b> palm is {{cultivated}} in South India and Sri Lanka. It is also {{cultivated in}} Southeast Asian countries of Cambodia, Myanmar, Thailand and the Andaman Islands. It is also grown sparsely in China.|$|E
50|$|The <b>talipot</b> palm {{bears the}} largest {{inflorescence}} of any plant, 6 - 8 m long, consisting {{of one to}} several million small flowers borne on a branched stalk that forms {{at the top of}} the trunk (the titan arum, Amorphophallus titanum, from the family Araceae, has the largest unbranched inflorescence, and the species Rafflesia arnoldii has the world's largest single flower). The <b>talipot</b> palm is monocarpic, flowering only once, when it is 30 to 80 years old. It takes about a year for the fruit to mature, producing thousands of round, yellow-green fruit 3 - 4 cm in diameter, each containing a single seed. The plant dies after fruiting.|$|E
5000|$|The name [...] "corpse flower" [...] {{applied to}} Rafflesia can be {{confusing}} because this common name also {{refers to the}} titan arum (Amorphophallus titanum) of the family Araceae. Moreover, because Amorphophallus has the world's largest unbranched inflorescence, it is sometimes mistakenly credited as having the world's largest flower. Both Rafflesia and Amorphophallus are flowering plants, but they are only distantly related. Rafflesia arnoldii has the largest single flower of any flowering plant, {{at least in terms}} of weight. Amorphophallus titanum has the largest unbranched inflorescence, while the <b>talipot</b> palm (Corypha umbraculifera) forms the largest branched inflorescence, containing thousands of flowers; the <b>talipot</b> is monocarpic, meaning the individual plants die after flowering.|$|E
50|$|On the 3rd story, the monk-learning {{hall with}} its beautifully carved door and windows, {{featuring}} Nang Phom Hom, the lasting Isaan tales. This story includes <b>talipot</b> fans, fan of ranks, and eight necessities of famous Khon Kaen monks.|$|E
50|$|Pechas {{trace their}} history and unique shape {{back to the}} palm leaf manuscripts of India where palmyra and <b>talipot</b> palm leaves {{were used in the}} {{creation}} of texts as early as the 500 BCE. The earliest existing palm leaf manuscripts date from 200 C.E. and were in continuous use until the 19th century.|$|E
5000|$|Corypha (Gebang Palm, Buri Palm and <b>Talipot</b> Palm) is a genus of palms (family Arecaceae), {{native to}} India, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, New Guinea, northeastern Australia (Cape York Peninsula, Queensland). They are fan palms (Arecaceae tribe Corypheae), with the leaves {{with a long}} petiole {{terminating}} in a rounded fan of numerous leaflets.|$|E
50|$|Corypha umbraculifera, the <b>talipot</b> palm, is {{a species}} of palm native to eastern and {{southern}} India and Sri Lanka. It is also grown in Cambodia, Myanmar, China, Thailand and the Andaman Islands. It is a flowering plant with the largest inflorescence in the world. It lives up to 60 years before bearing fruits and flowers. It dies shortly after.|$|E
50|$|Palm-leaf manuscripts are manuscripts {{made out}} of dried palm leaves. Palm leaves were used as writing {{materials}} in South Asia and in Southeast Asia {{dating back to the}} 5th century BCE, and possibly much earlier. Their use began in South Asia, and spread elsewhere, as texts on dried and smoke treated palm leaves of Borassus species (Palmyra palm) or the Ola leaf (leaf of Corypha umbraculifera or the <b>talipot</b> palm).|$|E
50|$|Ola leaf is a {{palm leaf}} used for writing in {{traditional}} palm leaf manuscripts and in fortunetelling (horoscopes) in Southern India and Sri Lanka. The leaves {{are from the}} <b>talipot</b> tree, a type of palm, and fortunes are written on them and read by fortune tellers. It is believed that three thousand years ago the seven rishis, sages, wrote everyone's fortunes on the leaves. The National Library of Sri Lanka holds an ola-leaf manuscript collection.|$|E
50|$|Phra Pathommachedi Museum or Phra Pathomchedi Museum {{building}} (พระปฐมเจดีย์พิพิธภัณฑ์สถาน) is {{originally a}} mediation hall and is located opposite the ordination hall {{and from the}} entrance, {{is located on the}} right in front of Northern Vihara on lower terrace. Later the building has been renovated and used as temple museum. The ordination hall is a single storey reinforced concrete building with traditional Thai temple glazed tiles roof. The collection includes many old Buddha images and <b>talipot</b> fans.|$|E
5000|$|Rafflesia arnoldii is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the parasitic genus Rafflesia. It is noted for producing the largest individual flower on earth. It {{has a very strong}} and horrible odour of decaying flesh, earning it the nickname [...] "corpse flower". It is endemic to the rainforests of Sumatra and possibly Borneo. Although there are some plants with larger flowering organs like the titan arum (Amorphophallus titanum) and <b>talipot</b> palm (Corypha umbraculifera), those are technically clusters of many flowers.|$|E
50|$|Several other {{incidents}} {{connected with}} the Buddha, besides the preaching of the first sermon, are mentioned as having taken place in Isipatana. Here it was that one day at dawn Yasa came to the Buddha and became an Arahant. It was at Isipatana, too, that the rule was passed prohibiting the use of sandals made of <b>talipot</b> leaves. On another occasion when the Buddha was staying at Isipatana, having gone there from Rājagaha, he instituted rules forbidding the use of certain kinds of flesh, including human flesh. Twice, while the Buddha was at Isipatana, Māra visited him but had to go away discomfited.|$|E
50|$|Near Ban Thap Lan, Ban Khun Sri Bupram, and Ban Wang Mued, {{are rare}} fan palm or <b>Talipot</b> palm forests. These forests covered {{much of the}} {{northeast}} region of Thailand in the past, though the spread of agriculture saw {{the destruction of a}} large number of palm forests. Today, Thap Lan is home to one of the few such forests remaining in Thailand. The fan palm is important in Thai culture as its leaves were used as the parchment on which Buddhist texts were inscribed. Fan palms are an ancient plant that produce a single massive inflorescence, the largest in the plant kingdom, containing up to 60 million flowers. After this huge exertion of energy, the tree dies.|$|E
5000|$|The nine-storied Lovamahapaya (3rd century BCE) {{would have}} been an elegant building. It had an exposed wooden frame {{supported}} on stone pillars. It was plastered in white, with shining copper roof tiles and a pinnacle at its apex. It had lightning conductors or chumbakam made of amber and tourmaline. Its rafters were made of <b>talipot</b> palm. It rose to a height of 162 ft and had approximately 179316 sq ft of floor space. It could seat 9000 monks. Roland Silva remarked in 1984 that such an extensive floor space would stagger the designers in Sri Lanka [...] "even today". The dominant element in these buildings, was the tiled roof supported by timber beams and rafters. The roofs were tiled, from as early as the 3rd century BCE, with red, white, yellow, turquoise and brown tiles. There were also tiles made of bronze.|$|E
50|$|The monks {{who left}} to India {{and to the}} hilly areas of Sri Lanka, during the {{difficult}} period, returned to Anuradhapura, and decided to transcribe the Tripiṭaka (philosophical doctrines of Buddhism) for the preservation and {{for the use of}} future generations. The monks selected Aluvihare Rock temple in Matale as the most suitable and secured place to carry out this important event. This transcription was carried out due to the fear that the doctrine would be lost during the upheaval caused by repeated South Indian invasions. It is said that 500 scholarly monks congregated at Aluvihare Rock temple to perform the difficult task of first reciting the doctrines and agreeing on an acceptable version before transcription. The entire transcription was done in books made of ola leaves, locally known as puskola poth.These books were made up from thick strips created from the leaves of either the palmyra or <b>talipot</b> palm and the doctrines were written down in Pali language. A metal stylus was used to inscribe the characters on the ola leaves.|$|E
