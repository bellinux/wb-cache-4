5|$|The hubs of orb webs, where <b>the</b> <b>spiders</b> lurk, {{are usually}} above the center, as <b>the</b> <b>spiders</b> can move {{downwards}} faster than upwards. If {{there is an}} obvious direction in which the spider can retreat to avoid its own predators, the hub is usually offset towards that direction.|$|E
5|$|In a {{study of}} spider populations in western Tennessee, Zygoballus sexpunctatus spiderlings were {{reported}} to hatch from egg sacs in mid summer. <b>The</b> <b>spiders</b> hibernated through the winter in an immature form and reached sexual maturity around late April.|$|E
5|$|Like most spiders, Trogloraptor possess venom glands. However, {{the venom}} {{is not known}} to be harmful to humans. <b>The</b> <b>spiders</b> {{themselves}} are very shy and unaggressive. They immediately flee illumination.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>spider</b> was {{described}} {{along with a}} previously undescribed species of fly, which appeared to have a kleptoparasitic relationship with it. The flies often feed on <b>the</b> <b>spider's</b> catches before <b>the</b> <b>spider</b> wraps them. Occasionally, spiders have been observed to chase away the flies when they land on something that <b>the</b> <b>spider</b> is eating.|$|R
5|$|In {{his last}} season in the major leagues, he played for <b>the</b> <b>Spiders,</b> widely {{considered}} {{to be one of}} the worst teams in MLB history. After his baseball career, he returned to his hometown of Ashland. He worked for the area coal mines as a brewery wagon driver and carpenter, and died there at 62 years of age.|$|E
5|$|Many horror {{films have}} {{featured}} the spider, including 1955's Tarantula, exploiting America's fear of atomic radiation during the nuclear arms race, the 1975 low-budget cult film The Giant Spider Invasion, and Kingdom of <b>the</b> <b>Spiders,</b> a 1977 film starring William Shatner, depicting {{the consequence of}} hungry spiders deprived of their natural food supply due to pesticides.|$|E
5|$|On August 6, 1890, Young's {{major league}} debut, he pitched a three-hit 8 - 1 {{victory over the}} Chicago Colts. While Young was on <b>the</b> <b>Spiders,</b> Chief Zimmer was his catcher more often than any other player. Bill James, a {{baseball}} statistician, estimated that Zimmer caught Young in more games than any other battery in baseball history.|$|E
50|$|Once {{a spider}} has been {{detected}} the wasp uses its mandibles and carefully enters <b>the</b> <b>spider's</b> burrow. This seems to cause <b>the</b> <b>spider</b> to leave <b>the</b> burrow where {{it and the}} wasp can fight, the wasp has to evict <b>the</b> <b>spider</b> to ensure it has space to manoeuvre. Once <b>the</b> <b>spider</b> has been evicted the wasp steps away from it and grooms itself before using its antennae to cause <b>the</b> <b>spider</b> to raise itself into a threat posture by raising its front legs and baring its fangs. The wasp then grabs the second legs and injects <b>the</b> <b>spider</b> with its sting between {{the base of the}} leg and the sternum, striking a nerve centre and causing paralysis in <b>the</b> <b>spider.</b> She may then feed on fluid exuding from the wound she has caused or she may groom herself again. The wasp may then drag <b>the</b> <b>spider</b> back into its burrow, or she may dig a new burrow, before laying a single egg on <b>the</b> <b>spider</b> and sealing <b>the</b> burrow.|$|R
50|$|New Zealand {{entomologist}} Anthony Harris {{has observed}} interactions between Priocnemis monachus and Cantuaria. He recorded that a wasp {{will find a}} trapdoor spider outside their burrow and stalk it. <b>The</b> <b>spider</b> will flee but as it turns to face the wasp (rearing up as it does so) a struggle ensues. The wasp will sting <b>the</b> <b>spider</b> several times until <b>the</b> <b>spider</b> collapses, although still alive. The wasp will then drag the body of <b>the</b> <b>spider</b> back to its already prepared nest. <b>The</b> <b>spider</b> is placed in a cell of the nest in which a wasp will lay an egg. The larva that develops will start feeding on the inert but still living body of <b>the</b> <b>spider.</b> Only at <b>the</b> end will the wasp larva eat the vital organs of <b>the</b> <b>spider,</b> which finally dies.|$|R
50|$|The vast {{majority}} of extant spider species are included in this group. The exceptions belong to the infraorder Mygalomorphae, which includes tarantulas, trapdoor spiders and several families of funnel-web <b>spiders,</b> and <b>the</b> suborder Mesothelae, which includes about 100 species living in Asia. The Araneomorphae include <b>the</b> orb-weaver <b>spiders,</b> <b>the</b> cobweb <b>spiders,</b> <b>the</b> crab <b>spiders,</b> <b>the</b> jumping <b>spiders,</b> <b>the</b> wolf <b>spiders,</b> and <b>the</b> large huntsman <b>spiders.</b>|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>spiders</b> {{are unique}} in the {{flexible}} and teethed hook-like claws on the last segments (tarsus) of their legs. These elongated claws resemble those of spiders in the family Gradungulidae of Australia and New Zealand, but the two families are only distantly related. Hooked tarsal claws are also present {{to a lesser extent}} in the unrelated genera Doryonychus of Tetragnathidae, Hetrogriffus of Thomisidae and Celaenia of Araneidae.|$|E
5|$|Written by Gary Russell. A story idea {{considered}} for the eleventh and twelfth episodes of the fourth series.

5|$|Adult mecopterans {{are mostly}} scavengers, feeding on {{decaying}} vegetation {{and the soft}} bodies of dead invertebrates. Panorpa raid spider webs to feed on trapped insects and even <b>the</b> <b>spiders</b> themselves, and hangingflies capture flies and moths with their specially modified legs. Some groups consume pollen, nectar, midge larvae, carrion and moss fragments. Most mecopterans live in moist environments; in hotter climates, the adults may therefore be active and visible only for short periods of the year.|$|E
50|$|Paracyphononyx is a genus of spider wasps {{distributed}} in the tropics and warmer temperate regions, they differ from other pompilids in that the do not permanently disable <b>the</b> host <b>spider</b> but allow <b>the</b> <b>spider</b> to resume activity after the wasp has laid its egg on <b>the</b> <b>spider</b> while <b>the</b> wasp larve exists as koinobiont ectoparasitoid of <b>the</b> <b>spider.</b>|$|R
50|$|The adult female wasp {{temporarily}} paralyzes <b>the</b> <b>spider</b> {{and lays}} an egg on its abdomen. The egg hatches into a larva which sucks <b>the</b> <b>spider's</b> blood through small holes, while <b>the</b> <b>spider</b> goes on about its normal web building and insect catching behavior {{for the next}} one to two weeks. When the larva is ready to pupate, it injects a chemical into <b>the</b> <b>spider,</b> causing it to build a web, the design of which is completely different from any it has ever made, and then to sit motionless {{in the middle of this}} web. Even if the larva is removed prior to the web-building process, <b>the</b> <b>spider</b> still engages in aberrant web-spinning. The wasp larva then molts, kills <b>the</b> <b>spider</b> with a poison and sucks its body dry before discarding it and building a cocoon that hangs from the middle of <b>the</b> web <b>the</b> <b>spider</b> has just built. The larva pupates inside the cocoon, then emerges to mate and begin the cycle over again.|$|R
25|$|T. domestica {{is not a}} {{particularly}} aggressive species and will often retreat when confronted. As long as its web is undisturbed, <b>the</b> <b>spider</b> will usually retreat to the funnel tip and stop responding to any movement whatsoever. If the web is attacked and partially destroyed, <b>the</b> <b>spider</b> will attempt to flee the area or may huddle its body into a ball against the wall or some other nearby object. To usher <b>the</b> <b>spider</b> into a container for removal, place open end in front of <b>the</b> <b>spider</b> and use <b>the</b> container lid if so equipped or similar object to push or corral <b>the</b> <b>spider</b> from behind. Since a spider's first reflex after being disturbed from the rear is to move forward, usually <b>the</b> <b>spider</b> will advance into the container {{placed in front of}} it.|$|R
5|$|Chamberlain {{had agreed}} {{to play for the}} Cleveland Spiders in 1895, but instead he joined a Class D {{baseball}} team out of Warren, Ohio in the Iron and Oil League. Future Baseball Hall of Fame member Honus Wagner played on the team. Years later, Wagner recalled Chamberlain as an experienced pitcher who shared his baseball knowledge with his young teammates. He reported to <b>the</b> <b>Spiders</b> in 1896. The team featured Cy Young and young pitchers such as Cy Swaim and Zeke Wilson. Chamberlain was released after appearing in two games.|$|E
5|$|In 1896, Young lost {{a no-hitter}} {{with two outs}} {{in the ninth inning}} when Ed Delahanty of the Philadelphia Phillies hit a single. On September 18, 1897, Young pitched the first no-hitter of his career in a game against the Cincinnati Reds. Although Young did not walk a batter, <b>the</b> <b>Spiders</b> {{committed}} four errors while on defense. One of the errors had originally been ruled a hit, but the Cleveland third baseman sent a note to the press box after the eighth inning, saying he had made an error, and the ruling was changed. Young later said, that, despite his teammate's gesture, he considered the game to be a one-hitter.|$|E
5|$|In the manga The Saga of Darren Shan, the titular {{character}} is fascinated by spiders. He kept them as pets until he killed {{one that he}} got when he was nine years old. He used {{to let them go}} into his mouth and he'd imagine them eating him from the inside out. Normally, <b>the</b> <b>spiders</b> would stay with him for about a day or two, but some lasted longer. Later on, we find out that he can communicate with spiders.|$|E
50|$|Palystes spiders {{are also}} {{commonly}} seen paralysed, being dragged {{by a large}} wasp called a Pompilid wasp. Sometimes the wasp will not be present. Pompilid wasps only hunt spiders, which they paralyse by stinging them. They then drag <b>the</b> <b>spider</b> back to their nest where they lay an egg on <b>the</b> <b>spider,</b> then seal <b>the</b> <b>spider</b> and <b>the</b> egg in. When the egg hatches, the larva eats <b>the</b> paralysed <b>spider,</b> keeping <b>the</b> <b>spider</b> alive {{as long as possible}} by eating peripheral flesh first, and saving the vital organs till last. By doing this, <b>the</b> <b>spider</b> stays fresh long enough for the wasp larva to mature and pupate. The Pompilid wasp species Tachypompilus ignitus is at least largely a specialist hunter of mature Palystes females.|$|R

5|$|The 1892 {{regular season}} {{was a success}} for Young, who led the National League in wins (36), ERA (1.93), and shutouts (9). Just as many {{contemporary}} Minor League Baseball leagues operate today, the National League was using a split season format during the 1892 season. The Boston Beaneaters won the first-half title, and <b>the</b> <b>Spiders</b> won the second-half title, with a best-of-nine series determining the league champion. Despite the Spiders' second half run, the Beaneaters swept the series, five games to none. Young pitched three complete games in the series, but lost two decisions. He also threw a complete game shutout, but the game ended in a 00 tie.|$|E
5|$|The Third Doctor {{was portrayed}} by Jon Pertwee. Sentenced to exile on Earth and {{forcibly}} regenerated {{at the end}} of The War Games, the Doctor spent his time working for UNIT. After The Three Doctors, the Time Lords repealed his exile; however, the Doctor still worked closely with UNIT from time to time. The Third Doctor regenerated into his fourth incarnation as a result of radiation poisoning in the last moments of Planet of <b>the</b> <b>Spiders.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Third Doctor's final {{story was}} to be The Final Game by Robert Sloman and Barry Letts as an uncredited co-writer which was {{commissioned}} on 15 February 1973. The story was to end with the reveal that the Master and the Doctor were brothers or two different, opposing aspects of the same being (the Ego and the Id), and the Master dying in a manner which suggested that he sacrificed himself to save the Doctor's life. The actor who played the Master, Roger Delgado, {{was killed in a}} car accident in Turkey on 18 June 1973, forcing the scrapping of the story. The story was replaced by Planet of <b>the</b> <b>Spiders.</b>|$|E

50|$|The duo tracks <b>the</b> still-growing <b>spider</b> at {{a public}} park, where it kills dozens of people. Alex and José get <b>the</b> <b>spider</b> to chase their truck and lure it to the military. A huge firefight ensues, but <b>the</b> <b>spider</b> escapes into <b>the</b> nearby woods.

After Alex and José demand answers, Braxton reveals that they discovered alien DNA and hoped {{to use it as a}} growth hormone. However, a spider's nest was hidden in some test fruit, thus exposing <b>the</b> <b>spider</b> to <b>the</b> alien DNA and triggering its rapid growth. It is also revealed that <b>the</b> <b>spider</b> will soon start reproducing based on its size and their studies of the alien DNA.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>spiders</b> {{were first}} {{collected}} in 2010 by Geo Graening, Neil Marchington, Ron Davis and Daniel Snyder, cave conservationists from the Western Cave Conservancy.

5|$|With the {{previous}} season's inconsistencies behind him, Stivetts was re-signed {{and was the}} team's starting pitcher for Boston's season-opening game on April19; a 13–2victory versus the Bridegrooms of Brooklyn. He then lost his next eight starts, however, before beginning a ten-game winning streak that lasted into mid-July. On August21, he started and gained complete game victories in both ends of a doubleheader versus the Cincinnati Reds. Two days later, on August23, he pitched Boston to a 12–10victory against <b>the</b> <b>Spiders.</b> That same day in Ashland, his father {{was killed in a}} coal mining accident when a load of coal fell on top on him.|$|E
5|$|Young's career {{started in}} 1890 with the Cleveland Spiders. After eight years with <b>the</b> <b>Spiders,</b> Young {{was moved to}} St. Louis in 1899. After two years there, Young jumped to the newly created American League, joining the Boston franchise. He was traded back to Cleveland in 1909, before {{spending}} the final two months of {{his career with the}} Boston Rustlers. After his retirement, Young went back to his farm in Ohio, where he stayed until his death at age 88 in 1955.|$|E
50|$|H. sanguinolentus preys on {{one species}} of spider, Cheiracanthium erraticum, which {{lives on the}} damper patches of heathlands. From late June until August <b>the</b> female <b>spider</b> spins a purse-like web using {{vegetation}} such as heather infloresences and grass flowering stems. She remains this web until her eggs are laid and the young hatched. A hunting female H. sanguinolentus will force entry into <b>the</b> <b>spider's</b> purse-web and if it discovers a gravid female <b>spider,</b> <b>the</b> wasp quickly paralyses <b>the</b> <b>spider</b> by stinging it. H. sanguinolentus lays its own egg {{on the front of}} <b>the</b> <b>spider’s</b> abdomen and <b>the</b> <b>spider</b> recovers from <b>the</b> paralysis but it never leaves the web again, nor does she lay eggs. After three days the egg of H. sanguinolentus hatches and the larva feeds on <b>the</b> <b>spider,</b> finally killing it after about ten days. The H. sanguinolentus larva then spins its cocoon within <b>the</b> <b>spider’s</b> purse-web. <b>The</b> purse-web has to remain intact and above the ground until the following July when the new adult H. sanguinolentus emerge.|$|R
30|$|After {{releasing}} the prey into the Petri dish, I observed the predatory behavior of <b>the</b> <b>spider,</b> particularly <b>the</b> following points: the body part(s) of the ant that <b>the</b> <b>spider</b> bit during capturing, and whether <b>the</b> <b>spider</b> released <b>the</b> captured ant or not.
