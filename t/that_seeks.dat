50|$|Transduction {{algorithms}} can be broadly {{divided into}} two categories: those <b>that</b> <b>seek</b> to assign discrete labels to unlabeled points, and those <b>that</b> <b>seek</b> to regress continuous labels for unlabeled points.

These can be further sub{{divided into two}} categories: those that cluster by partitioning, and those that cluster by agglomerating. Algorithms <b>that</b> <b>seek</b> to predict continuous labels tend to be derived by adding partial supervision to a manifold learning algorithm.|$|R

Currently, the most popular approach to quantum gravity is string theory, which models elementary particles not as zero-dimensional points but as one-dimensional objects called strings. In the AdS/CFT correspondence, one typically considers theories of quantum gravity derived from string theory or its modern extension, M-theory.|$|E

He enrolled as a student at the Central School, where his older brother John taught. In Nekede, Achebe gained an appreciation for Mbari, a traditional art form <b>that</b> <b>seeks</b> to invoke the gods' protection through symbolic sacrifices in the form of sculpture and collage. (He would later suggest the name for the Mbari Writers and Artists Club that was founded in Ibadan by Ulli Beier and others in 1961.) When the time came to change to secondary school, in 1944, Achebe sat entrance examinations for and was accepted at both the prestigious Dennis Memorial Grammar School in Onitsha and the even more prestigious Government College in Umuahia.|$|E

Many Jewish women have become leaders of feminist movements throughout their history.|$|E

The star's planet, Kepler-5b, was the second of the first five planets to be discovered by the Kepler spacecraft; the first three planets found by Kepler were used as tests, and had already been discovered. Kepler-5b was presented to the public on January 4, 2010 at the 215th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Washington, D.C., along with planets around Kepler-4, Kepler-6, Kepler-7, and Kepler-8.|$|E

A woman who identifies herself as Celia Fortner, appears and summons several monsters. Arikado arrives to help Soma defeat the monsters, after which Soma absorbs their souls. Celia retreats, proclaiming that she will destroy Soma. Soma expresses disbelief at the return of his powers, but Arikado reveals that his powers were never lost, only dormant. He informs Soma that Celia {{is the head of}} a cult <b>that</b> <b>seeks</b> the resurrection of the dark lord. He leaves, instructing Soma not to pursue Celia.|$|E
5|$|The will, Balzac cautions, is a {{destructive}} force <b>that</b> <b>seeks</b> only to acquire power unless tempered by knowledge. The shopkeeper presents a foil for Valentin's future self, offering study and mental development {{as an alternative}} to consuming desire. Foedora also serves as a model for resistance to the corruption of will, insofar as she seeks at all times to excite desire in others while never giving in to her own. That Valentin is happiest living in the material squalor of his tiny garret– lost in study and writing, with the good-hearted Pauline giving herself to him– underscores the irony of his misery {{at the end of the}} book, when he is surrounded with the fruits of his material desire.|$|E
