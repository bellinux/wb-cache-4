40|$|A new Diesel {{combustion}} {{concept has}} been developed, which allows reducing both soot and NOx emissions, even at high load and engine speed, with benefits for thermal efficiency as well. The concept consists in forming a pre-compressed homogeneous charge outside the cylinder and in gradually admitting {{it into the}} cylinder during the combustion process. In this way, combustion can be controlled by the transfer flow rate and high pressure rise rates, typical of standard HCCI combustion, can be avoided. This new combustion concept has been called Homogenous Charge Progressive Combustion (HCPC). HCPC is based on split-cycle principle. The intake and compression phases are performed in a reciprocating external compressor, which drives the air into the combustor cylinder during the combustion process, through a transfer duct. A <b>transfer</b> <b>valve</b> is positioned between the compressor cylinder and the transfer duct. The compressor piston has a fixed delay, in terms of crank-angle degrees, {{with respect to the}} combustor piston. The combustion takes place after combustor TDC, thus, during the combustion process, the combustor piston moves downwards whereas the compressor piston moves upwards. As a consequence, the air moves from the compressor cylinder to the combustor cylinder.

40|$|Due to {{concerns}} regarding pollutant and CO 2 emissions, advanced combustion modes that can simultaneously reduce exhaust emissions and improve thermal efficiency {{have been widely}} investigated. The main characteristic of the new combustion strategies, such as HCCI and LTC, is that {{the formation of a}} homogenous mixture or a controllable stratified mixture is required prior to ignition. The major issue with these approaches is the lack of a direct method for the control of ignition timing and combustion rate, which can be only indirectly controlled using high EGR rates and/or lean mixtures. Homogeneous Charge Progressive Combustion (HCPC) is based on the split-cycle principle. Intake and compression phases are performed in a reciprocating external compressor, which drives the air into the combustor cylinder during the combustion process, through a transfer duct.

30|$|Valve V 2 was {{switched}} to position 2 before the CO trap was heated to ambient temperature. This {{was followed by}} the transfer of [11 C]CO to the micro-autoclave in a stream of helium (3 bar) by switching valve V 2 to position 1. After this <b>transfer,</b> <b>valve</b> V 2 was switched back to position 2. The freshly prepared precursor solution was loaded on the reagent loop and transferred to the micro-autoclave using THF pumped at a pressure of up to 300 bar. This high pressure forced both [11 C]CO and the helium transfer gas to dissolve in the reagent solution in the micro-autoclave, which then was heated for 5 min at 120 °C to facilitate the carbonylation reaction. Next, the reaction mixture was transferred to a vacuumized vial by switching valve V 2 to position 3. The product solution was degassed with helium (10 mL) to remove residual [11 C]CO and other gaseous compounds. Next, the reaction mixture was diluted with H 2 O (1 mL), injected on the preparative HPLC system and purified using HPLC method A. [11 C]phenytoin, with a retention time in the range of 7 to 9 min, was collected directly into a vortex evaporator (PET Evap, Scansys Laboratortechnik, Copenhagen, Denmark). During fraction collection, the HPLC eluent was evaporated continuously at 60 °C under N 2 gas at high flow. After the HPLC eluent was removed, buffered 0.9 % NaCl aqueous solution (12 mL, pH 7, 4; 8.4 -mM Na 2 HPO 4 / 1.8 -mM NaH 2 PO 4) was added, and the reformulated [11 C]phenytoin was passed over a Millex GV filter (0.22 μM, Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) and dispensed into a sterile product vial. The chemical and radiochemical purity was assessed using analytical HPLC method B.

40|$|Due to {{concerns}} regarding {{the greenhouse effect}} and limitations on carbon dioxide emissions, {{the possibility of a}} next-generation combustion mode for internal combustion engines that can simultaneously reduce exhaust emissions and substantially improve thermal efficiency has drawn increasing attention. The presented research activity was focused on the design and development of an innovative combustion system for Diesel engines. A new approach for a low emission – high efficiency Diesel combustion was conceived: the basic idea is to control the heat release rate by a gradual supply of an almost homogeneous charge in the combustion chamber, without relying on exhaust gas recirculation or extremely diluted mixtures to moderate the combustion reactions. This new approach was defined Homogenous Charge Progressive Combustion (HCPC). HCPC is based on the split-cycle principle. The intake and compression phases are performed in a reciprocating external compressor, which drives the air into the combustor cylinder during the combustion process, through a transfer duct. A <b>transfer</b> <b>valve</b> is placed between the compressor cylinder and the transfer duct. The compressor piston has a fixed delay, in terms of crank-angle degrees, with respect to the combustor piston. The combustion takes place after combustor TDC, thus, during the combustion process, the combustor piston moves downwards whereas the compressor piston moves upwards. As a consequence, the air moves from the compressor cylinder to the combustor cylinder. Contemporary with the air transfer, fuel is injected into the transfer duct, evaporates and mixes with the air, bringing about the conditions needed for a nearly homogeneous combustion. The research activity carried out during the PhD course was focused on the CFD study of the HCPC engine, both for Light-Duty and Heavy-Duty applications. Preliminary results were the concept validity was tested are presented, followed by further studies and development of the engine geometry. A light duty version of the engine is firstly presented, which can run at the even better ISFC of Diesel engines at speeds that are typical of SI engines for passenger cars, maintaining a low soot emission combustion. Next a validation activity on Heavy-Duty engines is presented, where the CFD model was tested, both for performance and emission behavior. Finally two versions of an Heavy-Duty HCPC engine are presented, the latter delivering a Diesel-like indicated thermal efficiency, with ultra-clean combustion.
