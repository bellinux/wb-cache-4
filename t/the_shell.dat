5|$|Both sides cite strong evidence, and the {{conflict}} {{has yet to}} be resolved. <b>The</b> <b>shell</b> of testudines distinguishes them from other vertebrates. <b>The</b> <b>shell</b> is not an exoskeleton, but a modified ribcage and part of the vertebral column. Because of <b>the</b> <b>shell,</b> the pectoral and pelvic girdles are located within the ribcage. The limb bones are also modified to accommodate to <b>the</b> <b>shell.</b>|$|E
5|$|Near {{the hinge}} of <b>the</b> <b>shell</b> is the umbo, often a rounded, knob-like {{protuberance}} usually surrounding the beak. The umbo generally and the beak specifically represent the oldest portion of <b>the</b> <b>shell,</b> with extra material gradually being laid {{down along the}} margins on the opposite sides. The hinge point or line is the dorsal region of <b>the</b> <b>shell,</b> and the lower, curved margin is the ventral region. The anterior or front of <b>the</b> <b>shell</b> is where the byssus (when present) and foot are located, and the posterior of <b>the</b> <b>shell</b> is where the siphons are located. With the umbones/ hinge uppermost and with the anterior edge of the animal towards the viewer's left, the valve facing the viewer is the left valve and the opposing valve the right.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>shell</b> of Novisuccinea chittenangoensis is ovate, slender, acute, and of {{moderate}} thickness. <b>The</b> <b>shell</b> suture is deep. The spire is gently convex, laterally compressed, with 3¼ whorls. The spire is long, {{slightly less than}} half <b>the</b> <b>shell</b> length, and the aperture is very oblique. <b>The</b> <b>shell</b> color is subtranslucent, calcareous pale yellow to white. The surface is somewhat glossy and marked with growth wrinkles and lines. The size varies somewhat, but adult specimens of the type lot averaged 20.9millimeters (mm) in shell length. Various adult specimens measured {{during the summer of}} 1981 and 1982 ranged from 19 to 24mm.|$|E
50|$|In 2014 {{researchers}} encapsulated silicon nanoparticles inside carbon shells, {{and then}} encapsulated clusters of <b>the</b> <b>shells</b> with more carbon. <b>The</b> <b>shells</b> provide enough room inside {{to allow the}} nanoparticles to swell and shrink without damaging <b>the</b> <b>shells,</b> improving durability.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>shells</b> {{are formed}} into a {{clockwise}} spiral shape around the dice pad. The spaces between <b>the</b> <b>shells</b> are <b>the</b> playing positions {{which can be}} occupied by the coins. As the coin stacks move around this dynamic playing board, <b>the</b> <b>shells</b> are rearranged to expand or contract the spiral and the spaces between <b>the</b> <b>shells,</b> which means <b>the</b> game has a very tactile feel to it.|$|R

5|$|After death, {{the empty}} shell of this sea snail {{is often used}} by hermit crabs. On {{the coast of the}} Caraguatatuba, Brazil, a study of shell use in the diogenid hermit crab species Isocheles sawayai was carried out. This study {{revealed}} that 11.5% of the population of these hermit crabs were using shells of Semicassis granulata. The occupation of shell type was reported as not being random, but was instead described as being influenced by the weight, size, shape and internal volume of <b>the</b> <b>shell,</b> the occurrence of epibionts such as bryozoans on <b>the</b> <b>shell,</b> and the degree of resistance <b>the</b> <b>shell</b> offered to predation and desiccation.|$|E
5|$|Brachiopods, as with molluscs, have an {{epithelial}} mantle that secretes {{and lines}} <b>the</b> <b>shell,</b> and encloses the internal organs. The brachiopod body occupies only {{about one-third of}} the internal space inside <b>the</b> <b>shell,</b> nearest the hinge. The rest of the space is lined with the mantle lobes, extensions that enclose a water-filled space in which sits the lophophore. The coelom extends into each lobe as a network of canals, which carry nutrients to the edges of the mantle.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>shells</b> {{have a large}} aperture, {{which is}} rounded at the outer lip. <b>The</b> <b>shells</b> usually have {{striking}} markings.|$|R
5000|$|Juvenile cowry shells {{are not at}} all {{similar to}} adult cowry <b>shells.</b> <b>The</b> {{juvenile}} <b>shells</b> of cowries perhaps more closely resemble <b>the</b> <b>shells</b> of some [...] "bubble snails" [...] in the order Cephalaspidea. Also <b>the</b> <b>shells</b> of juvenile cowries seldom exhibit the same color patterns as <b>the</b> adult <b>shells</b> do, and thus can be hard to identify to species.|$|R
50|$|The {{width of}} <b>the</b> recent <b>shells</b> is 1.6-1.8 mm. The height of <b>the</b> <b>shells</b> of <b>the</b> recent <b>shell</b> is 2.5-3.3 mm.|$|R
5|$|In most brachiopods, diverticula (hollow extensions) of {{the mantle}} {{penetrate}} through the mineralized {{layers of the}} valves into the periostraca. The function of these diverticula is uncertain and {{it is suggested that}} they may be storage chambers for chemicals such as glycogen, may secrete repellents to deter organisms that stick to <b>the</b> <b>shell</b> or may help in respiration. Experiments show that a brachiopod's oxygen consumption drops if petroleum jelly is smeared on <b>the</b> <b>shell,</b> clogging the diverticula.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 1900, the {{similarity}} in shape of <b>the</b> <b>shell</b> of Amphidromus {{to that of}} South American tree snails in the family Bulimulidae had misled taxonomists. However, the dissections made by Wiegmann and Jacobi clearly showed that the inner anatomical features of Amphidromus {{were the same as}} those of the Asian-Indonesian Camaenidae, and that the resemblance of <b>the</b> <b>shell</b> of Amphidromus to that of bulimulids was merely an example of parallelism.|$|E
5|$|Shell colour is variable, from golden {{yellow to}} light yellowish-brown to grey. The {{underside}} of <b>the</b> <b>shell</b> is rarely dark; more frequently it is paler than the top, or totally white. In all cases, <b>the</b> <b>shell</b> aperture is white. Mature specimens sometimes have a metallic-grey or golden-brown gloss {{on the margin}} of the outer lip and the callus. A zigzag network of darker lines is sometimes present on the outside of <b>the</b> <b>shell.</b> The periostracum, a layer of protein (conchiolin) that is the outermost part of <b>the</b> <b>shell</b> surface, is yellowish-brown. It is usually thick, reticulated (net-like) and fimbriated (fringed) over the suture. The corneous operculum is dark brown, and its shape is fairly typical of the family Strombidae: a slightly bent sickle, with seven to eight weak lateral serrations.|$|E
50|$|Sexual {{dimorphism}} can {{be observed}} in <b>the</b> <b>shells</b> of this species: <b>the</b> <b>shells</b> of <b>the</b> males tend to be more elongate with a smoother outer surface, whereas <b>the</b> <b>shells</b> of <b>the</b> females are generally wider and more nodulose. The angle of the spire also differs between males and females.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>shells</b> {{of large}} {{saltwater}} bittersweet clams in the genus Glycymeris {{have a special}} archaeological significance in the southwestern USA, because <b>the</b> <b>shells</b> were used in trade item production by the Hohokam tribe of Amerindians.

In 2013, Game Informer listed Ghost in <b>the</b> <b>Shell</b> {{as one of the}} best anime and manga-based games released in English, and the best of the franchise's titles; the other seven games in the list were released more than six years after Ghost in <b>the</b> <b>Shell.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>shell</b> of Theodoxus fluviatilis is {{somewhat}} depressed (with an usually low spire), strongly calcified, and has 3–3.5 whorls (including the protoconch). Larger specimens are usually eroded. The width {{of an adult}} shell is usually 5–9mm, but can reach up to 11–13mm. The height of <b>the</b> <b>shell</b> is 4–6.5mm, or up to 7mm. These mean values vary among populations depending on the environment: the maximum width of <b>the</b> <b>shell</b> of brackish water populations is 9.3mm. Brackish water shells are somewhat shorter, reaching up to 5.8mm, and the maximum weight of <b>the</b> <b>shell</b> is 124mg. In freshwater populations, the maximum recorded shell width is 13.1mm, and maximum height is 9.3mm. The maximum weight of freshwater shells is 343mg.|$|E

50|$|To prevent <b>the</b> <b>shells</b> from {{collapsing}} at {{the long}} light slots at their apexes, concrete struts were inserted at 10-foot (3 m) intervals. A relatively thick concrete arch was added to each end of <b>the</b> <b>shells</b> to stiffen them further. To {{make it clear that}} <b>the</b> curved <b>shells</b> are supported only at their four corners and not by the walls at the ends of the vaults, thin arcs of transparent material were inserted between the curve of <b>the</b> <b>shells</b> and <b>the</b> end walls. Because the stiffening arches of <b>the</b> <b>shells</b> are thicker at the top, the transparent strips are tapered, thinner at the top than at the bottom. In addition, a linear transparent strip was placed between the straight bottoms of <b>the</b> <b>shells</b> and <b>the</b> long exterior walls to show that <b>the</b> <b>shells</b> aren't supported by those walls either.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>shelled</b> slug, {{scientific}} name Testacella haliotidea, is a rarely seen, air-breathing, carnivorous land slug, a terrestrial gastropod mollusk {{in the family}} Testacellidae, <b>the</b> <b>shelled</b> slugs.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>shells</b> of Physa {{species have}} a long and large aperture, a pointed spire, and no operculum. <b>The</b> <b>shells</b> are thin and corneous, and rather transparent.|$|R
5|$|Adult {{specimens}} have {{a moderately}} flared, posteriorly protruding outer lip, which is considerably thickened and completely devoid of marginal spikes or plicae. The body whorl is roundly swollen at the shoulder, {{with a few}} anterior spiral grooves. <b>The</b> <b>shell</b> has a medium-to-high cone-shaped spire, with at least five delicately furrowed whorls.|$|E
5|$|Generally the whorls of <b>the</b> <b>shell</b> {{increase}} rather {{regularly in}} size, however, species which are probably closely related, such as A. sinistralis (Reeve) and A. heccarii Tapparone-Canefri, can have quite {{different degrees of}} whorl increment. No attempt {{has been made to}} express these differences meristically, since most of the available material was inadequate for statistical treatment. Actual dimensions of <b>the</b> <b>shell</b> vary greatly both within and between species. The minimum adult size is about 21mm high, the observed maximum about 75mm. There is not much variation in adult size within species: only a few species, notably A. maculiferus, A. sinensis and A. entobaptus, have a variation in adult size that is greater than seven or eight millimeters in total.|$|E
5|$|It is {{also worth}} {{mentioning}} that sea shells, after collecting, {{need to be}} washed thoroughly in freshwater to remove the salt that is on and in <b>the</b> <b>shell,</b> and then dried thoroughly before they are stored. Salt attracts moisture and makes shells more vulnerable to Bynesian decay.|$|E
50|$|Lirae (singular lira) {{are fine}} lines or ridges (much finer than ribs) {{that are a}} sculptural feature of the outside of <b>the</b> <b>shells</b> of various animals.

5|$|The {{failure of}} the {{majority}} of <b>the</b> <b>shells</b> to detonate may have had various causes. As the submarines fired armour piercing shells, intended for use against steel ship hulls, the relatively softer brick walls may have failed to trigger the impact fuses. Sea water may have degraded <b>the</b> <b>shells,</b> which <b>the</b> Japanese had stored in deck lockers for several weeks. The age of <b>the</b> <b>shells</b> may also have been a factor; some of <b>the</b> <b>shells</b> recovered from <b>the</b> Newcastle bombardment were found to be of English manufacture; surplus munitions from World War I.|$|R

5|$|Juveniles with a shell {{length of}} 0.5–1mm hatch after 30 days (in 25°C), or after 65 days (in 20°C). The ash-free dry weight of newly hatched snails is 0.012mg. The protoconch has one whorl. Capsules laid in spring hatch after 2–3 months, in August–September. Capsules from late summer overwinter because {{embryonic}} development ceases in temperatures below 10°C, thus these capsules hatch in spring after 7–8 months. <b>The</b> <b>shell</b> grows mainly from May to August; {{there is no}} shell growth in winter. The snails reach sexual maturity in less than 1 year, when <b>the</b> <b>shell</b> length is 5.5–5.7mm.|$|E
5|$|Laevistrombus {{canarium}} (commonly {{known as}} the dog conch or by its better-known synonym, Strombus canarium) is a species of edible sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusc in the family Strombidae (true conches). Known from illustrations in books dating from the late 17th century, L.canarium is an Indo-Pacific species occurring from India and Sri Lanka to Melanesia, Australia and southern Japan. <b>The</b> <b>shell</b> of adult individuals is coloured from light yellowish-brown to golden to grey. It has a characteristic inflated body whorl, a flared, thick outer lip and a shallow stromboid notch. <b>The</b> <b>shell</b> is valued as an ornament, {{and because it is}} heavy and compact it is also often used as a sinker for fishing nets.|$|E
5|$|Many {{associations}} between adult oviraptorosaur skeletons or embryos with elongatoolithid eggs (including Macroolithus) demonstrate that Macroolithus and other elongatoolithids were laid by oviraptorosaurs. One oviraptorosaur skeleton from the Upper Cretaceous of China {{was described in}} 2005; two shelled elongatoolithid eggs were preserved inside of its pelvis. This suggests that oviraptorosaurs had two functional oviducts where both would produce eggs simultaneously. While Sato et al. did not refer the eggs specifically to Macroolithus, they noted that the eggs closely resemble M. yaotunensis, though with a thinner eggshell. The thin eggshell, however, could simply be because <b>the</b> <b>shell</b> had not finished forming when the mother died, or because of biochemical dissolution of <b>the</b> <b>shell</b> before fossilization.|$|E
