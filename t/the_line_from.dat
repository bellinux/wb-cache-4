5|$|To fulfil their obligations, London Transport {{formally}} {{inspected the}} line on 23 July 1935. The inspection was carried out with great speed, the special train taking just 15minutes to travel the length of <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>from</b> Brill to Quainton Road. The inspection confirmed that the closure process was to proceed.|$|E
5|$|After the war, {{construction}} of the Bristol Portway along the Avon Gorge necessitated the closure of <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>from</b> Sneyd Park Junction to Hotwells, with trains along it ceasing on 3 July 1922. By this point there were nine trains per day from Hotwells, and eight return. To compensate {{for the loss of}} service, the Great Western provided an additional four trains daily from Avonmouth Dock to Bristol and six return. In 1923, grouping resulted in the Midland Railway being absorbed into the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS), and the line continued in a joint arrangement between the Great Western and the LMS. The engine shed was closed in 1924.|$|E
5|$|Following a lost {{vote in the}} Scottish Parliament, the SNP-led {{minority}} Scottish Government {{agreed to}} continue <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>from</b> the airport to Leith on condition that no more public money would be supplied. A report by Audit Scotland, commissioned by the Scottish Government, confirmed that the cost projections were sound. The cost of the scheme in 2003 was estimated at £498 million, £375 million in funding from the Scottish Government and £45 million from Edinburgh Council.|$|E
50|$|NSW Trains {{also took}} {{responsibility}} from RailCorp for granting {{access to and}} maintaining <b>the</b> Main Northern <b>line</b> <b>from</b> Berowra to Newcastle, <b>the</b> Main Western <b>line</b> <b>from</b> Emu Plains to Bowenfels and <b>the</b> Illawarra <b>line</b> <b>from</b> Waterfall to Bomaderry.|$|R

50|$|The {{station is}} a {{terminal}} station serving {{domestic and international}} traffic on several rail <b>lines.</b> <b>The</b> <b>lines</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> east (Zürich-Lucerne and <b>the</b> Gotthard <b>lines)</b> pass to <b>the</b> north of Lucerne and then join <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> north (Olten-Lucerne <b>line)</b> and <b>the</b> west (Bern-Wolhusen-Lucerne <b>line)</b> and pass {{to the west of}} Lucerne before turning to approach the station from the south. The metre-gauge Brünig railway from the south and Interlaken also terminates at the station.|$|R
5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War in September 1939, works to complete the electrification of the LNER lines were slowed or halted. <b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>from</b> Finchley Central to Edgware closed for reconstruction on 11 September 1939. Northern line services were extended from East Finchley to High Barnet on 14 April 1940, and started serving the deep level platforms at Highgate on 19 January 1941, though not all of the new station buildings had been completed. The surface platforms at Highgate continued to be served by LNER steam trains.|$|E
5|$|Freight {{trains to}} the various {{industrial}} companies along the line remained until the 1980s, when traffic sank drastically. From 1988, the line was closed from Foss-Eigeland, although <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>from</b> there to Ganddal was kept for use for a cement factory. Until 2001 only the three first kilometers (two first miles) of the line were used, for transport of concrete structures, but then the Norwegian National Rail Administration stopped all traffic on the line.|$|E
5|$|Hays' plan {{involved}} {{the creation of}} a subsidiary line from Winnipeg to Prince Rupert, with the government building <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>from</b> New Brunswick to Winnipeg. The cabinet became weary of Hays' demands for subsidies, but after negotiations between the government and Hays, aided by the railroad's president Rivers Wilson, the National Transcontinental Railway Act was passed in 1903. It enabled the incorporation of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway (GTP). The government's portion of the line would be called the National Transcontinental Railway (NTR).|$|E

5|$|In 1865, {{powers were}} granted to extend <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>from</b> Newport Pagnell to Olney {{and then on}} to meet the Northampton and Peterborough Railway at Wellingborough. Construction was underway, and a bridge had been {{completed}} when the extension was abandoned in 1871. Olney was later served by a station on the Midland Railway's Bedford–Northampton line from 1872, that line closing in 1962.|$|E
5|$|In 1889 the Duke of Buckingham died, and in 1894 the {{trustees}} of his estate {{set up the}} Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad Company (O) {{with the intention of}} extending <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>from</b> Brill to Oxford, but the extension beyond Brill was never built. Rail services from London to Oxford were very poor at this time; despite being an extremely roundabout route, had the connection from Quainton Road to Oxford been built {{it would have been the}} shortest route between Oxford and the City of London.|$|E
5|$|In 1909, limited through {{services}} to the City restarted. Baker Street station was rebuilt with four tracks and two island platforms in 1912. To cope with the rise in traffic the line south of Harrow was quadrupled, in 1913 from Finchley Road to Kilburn, in 1915 to Wembley Park; <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>from</b> Finchley Road to Baker Street remained double track, causing a bottleneck.|$|E
