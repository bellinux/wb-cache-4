5|$|After {{completing}} {{the list of}} 21 tropical cyclone names {{for the first time}} ever, the NHC began naming storms with the Greek alphabet. Epsilon was the fifth name of <b>the</b> <b>list,</b> <b>and</b> ultimately there was one additional storm, making the 2005 season the most active on record with 27named storms. Since Epsilon stayed well out to sea and never approached land, no warnings or watches were issued. No ships reported tropical storm force winds from Epsilon and there were no damages or fatalities.|$|E
5|$|During the 30th {{session of}} the ESCAP/WMO Typhoon Committee in November 1997, a {{proposal}} was put forward by Hong Kong to give Asian typhoons local names and to stop using the European and American names {{that had been used}} since 1945. The committee's Training and Research Coordination Group was subsequently tasked to consult with members and work out the details of the scheme in order to present a list of names for approval at the 31st session. During August 1998, the group met and decided that each member of the committee would be invited to contribute ten names to <b>the</b> <b>list</b> <b>and</b> that five principles would be followed for the selection of names. It was also agreed that each name would have to be approved by each member and that a single objection would be enough to veto a name. A list of 140 names was subsequently drawn up and submitted to the Typhoon Committee's 32nd session, who after a lengthy discussion approved <b>the</b> <b>list</b> <b>and</b> decided to implement it on January 1, 2000. It was also decided that the Japan Meteorological Agency would name the systems rather than the Joint Typhoon Warning Center.|$|E

The Japanese had shot down three of Lexingtons Wildcats and five Dauntlesses, plus another Dauntless crashed on landing. At 12:43, the ship launched five Wildcats to replace the CAP and prepared to launch another nine Dauntlesses. A massive explosion at 12:47 was triggered by sparks that ignited gasoline vapors from the cracked port avgas tanks. The explosion killed 25 crewmen and knocked out the main damage control station. The damage did not interfere with flight deck operations, although the refueling system was shut down. The fueled Dauntlesses were launched and six Wildcats that were low on fuel landed aboard. Aircraft from the morning's air strike began landing at 13:22 and all surviving aircraft had landed by 14:14. The final tally was three Wildcats shot down, plus one Wildcat, three Dauntlesses and one Devastator that were forced to ditch.|$|E

The Circus Starring Britney Spears also made Spears rank at number twenty one on the Top Touring Artists of the Decade, becoming the youngest artist in <b>the</b> <b>list</b> <b>and</b> also the fourth female artist, behind Madonna, Celine Dion and Cher.

5|$|It {{finished}} 1994 as {{the fourth}} best-selling US Latin album and the best-selling regional Mexican album. In 1995, it ranked second to Dreaming of You for the best-selling Latin album, but was the best-selling regional Mexican recording. Amor Prohibido remained the best-selling regional Mexican album in 1996, while the record became the ninth best-selling Latin album of that year. It also ranked {{as the second}} best-selling catalog Latin album of 1997, while in 1998 it placed third. Billboards revised catalog criteria made it ineligible for the Top Latin Albums chart on January 18, 1997. It was removed from <b>the</b> <b>list</b> <b>and</b> began charting on the newly formed Latin Catalog Albums chart positioned at number two. Since 1997, the album has spent 13 nonconsecutive weeks at {{number one on the}} Top Latin Catalog Albums chart including three weeks in 2010. Following another revision to its Top Latin Albums chart, Billboard removed its two decade-long ban of catalog albums in its chart beginning with the February 11, 2017 list; Amor Prohibido re-entered the Top Latin Albums and Regional Mexican Albums chart after 20 years. Before its revision, Nielsen SoundScan reported that Amor Prohibido was the ninth best-selling Latin record of 2016. After its revision, Amor Prohibido reclaimed the number one position on the Regional Mexican Albums chart in May 2017. In November 1994, the album had sold 200,000 units in the US. A report showed the singer was one of the top-selling acts in Mexico. It became the second Tejano album to reach year-end sales of 500,000 copies. This had only been accomplished by La Mafia previously. Despite this, Nielsen Soundscan reported that the recording actually sold 184,000 units by April 1995. According to Behar, the sales figures Nielsen SoundScan provided did not include sales in small shops specializing in Latin music. That May, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified the album gold, for shipments of 500,000 units. Within three weeks, it was certified platinum for increments of one million units. Amor Prohibido became the first Tejano record to receive a platinum certification. By June 1995, it had sold 1.5 million units in the US, of which 100,000 were sold in Puerto Rico alone. As of February 2010, the album has been certified double diamond (Latin), denoting shipments of two million units. It is tied at second, behind her album Dreaming of You, for the best-selling Latin album of all-time in the US with 2.5 million copies sold worldwide. The recording has been ranked as the best-selling Tejano album of the 1990s, and the best-selling Tejano album of all-time.|$|E

5|$|The Tribal Hidage {{has been}} of great {{importance}} to historians {{since the middle of}} the 19th century, partly because it mentions territories unrecorded in other documents. Attempts to link all the names in the list with modern places are highly speculative and all resulting maps are treated with caution. Three different versions (or recensions) of the Tribal Hidage have survived, two of which resemble each other: one dates from the 11th century and is part of a miscellany of works; another is contained in a 17th-century Latin treatise; the third version, which has survived in six mediaeval manuscripts, has many omissions and spelling variations. All three versions appear {{to be based on the}} same lost manuscript: historians have been unable to establish a date for the original compilation. The Tribal Hidage has been used to construct theories about the political organisation of the Anglo-Saxons, and to give an insight into the Mercian state and its neighbours at a time when Mercia held hegemony over a number of other peoples. It has been used to support theories regarding the origin and location of the tribes in <b>the</b> <b>list</b> <b>and</b> the way in which the tribes were systematically assessed and ruled by others. Some historians have proposed that the Tribal Hidage is not a list of peoples but of administrative areas.|$|E
5|$|Tolliver was {{selected}} by the San Diego Chargers {{in the second round}} of the 1989 NFL Draft. The Chargers traded third, fourth, and seventh-round picks in exchange for the New York Giants' second-round pick in order to draft him. Tolliver was signed on July 31, 1989, after a short holdout. He was to compete for the starting job alongside Mark Malone and David Archer, a spot which eventually went to Jim McMahon after the Chargers traded for him. As the 1989 season began with McMahon as the helm, Tolliver was slated to play the second half of the final preseason game against the Phoenix Cardinals. After 13 completions in 23 attempts, Tolliver ran the ball late in the game and broke his collarbone, sidelining him for at least six weeks. After spending the first seven games on the injured reserve list, Tolliver was taken off <b>the</b> <b>list</b> <b>and</b> named the starter for the game against the Seattle Seahawks on October 29, replacing McMahon who had disappointed at quarterback. In Tolliver's first start, he played three quarters, throwing six completed passes in 17 attempts for 41 yards and throwing an interception in a 10–7 loss. Tolliver subsequently lost the starting job back to McMahon. However, in late November, Tolliver was given the starting job back, remaining the starting quarterback the rest of the season. Tolliver finished the season having played five games with 89 completions in 185 attempts, 1097 yards, five touchdowns, eight interceptions, and a 57.9 quarterback rating.|$|E
