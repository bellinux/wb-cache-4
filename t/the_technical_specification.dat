2500|$|Further {{specifications}} of {{the national}} flag were detailed in the Presidential Decree [...] "On the National Flag of the Republic of Azerbaijan" [...] issued on February 5, 1991. The ratio was kept at 1:2, which {{was used in the}} Soviet era. Each stripe is one-third of the total height of the flag and extends the full length. The star and crescent were placed in a box that has a ratio of 3:4; the crescent is shifted one-sixtieth from the center. The outside diameter of both the crescent and the red inside circle intersects with the diameter of the star. The diameter of the star is one-sixth the height of the flag; the inscribed circle in this star is one-twelfth the height of the flag. The flag is also described in <b>the</b> <b>technical</b> <b>specification</b> [...] "AZS 001-2006. Azərbaycan Respublikasının Dövlət Bayrağı. Texniki şərtlər."

2500|$|An updated {{variant of}} the {{broadcast}} flag has been developed in the Content Protection and Copy Management group under DVB (DVB-CPCM). Upon publication by DVB, <b>the</b> <b>technical</b> <b>specification</b> was submitted to European governments in March 2007. As with much DRM, the CPCM system is intended to control use of copyrighted material by the end-user, {{at the direction of}} the copyright holder. According to Ren Bucholz of the EFF, which paid {{to be a member of}} the consortium, [...] "You won't even know ahead of time whether and how you will be able to record and make use of particular programs or devices". The DVB claims that the system will harmonize copyright holders' control across different technologies, thereby making things easier for end users. The normative sections have now all been approved for publication by the DVB Steering Board, and will be published by ETSI as a formal European Standard as ETSI TS 102 825-X where X refers to the Part number of specification. Nobody has yet stepped forward to provide a Compliance and Robustness regime for the standard (though several are rumoured to be in development), so it is not presently possible to fully implement a system, as there is nowhere to obtain the necessary device certificates.|$|E
