This {{research}} {{analyzed the}} results of flexural strength of dense and porous mullite ceramic prepared from kaolin clay by using two-parameter Weibull probability distribution with different estimates. Chemical and physical characterizations of the clay were conducted using XRF, XRD and FESEM. The samples were tested using three point bending tests. The different estimates used in analyzing the results include mean rank, median rank, modified Kaplan Meier and Kaplan Meier. Among the estimates, Kaplan Meier was found to give the best fit with the highest correlation coefficient (R 2) value. <b>The</b> porous <b>ceramic</b> had <b>the</b> higher value of Weibull modulus in comparison to <b>the</b> dense <b>ceramic,</b> while <b>the</b> characteristic strength (scale parameter) of <b>the</b> dense <b>ceramic</b> was {{higher than that of}} <b>the</b> porous <b>ceramic.</b> <b>The</b> micrograph of <b>the</b> porous <b>ceramic</b> showed a relatively balanced distribution of rounded pores, which is associated with the higher Weibull modulus in <b>the</b> porous <b>ceramic...</b>|$|R
5|$|Calakmul {{is one of}} {{the most}} structure-rich sites within the Maya region. The site {{contains}} 117 stelae, the largest total in the region. Most are in paired sets representing rulers and their wives. However, because these carved stelae were produced in soft limestone, most of these stelae have been eroded beyond interpretation. Also many elaborate murals were discovered at Calakmul. These murals do not represent activities of the elite class. Rather, they depict elaborate market scenes of people preparing or consuming products such as atole, tamales, or tobacco as an ointment. Also items being sold were textiles and needles. These murals also have glyphs within them describing the actions occurring. The most prominent figure in these murals is identified as Lady Nine Stone; she appears in many scenes. This brings a world of the Maya marketplace to vibrant life for archaeologists. Another highly beneficial resource to Maya archaeological understanding at Calakmul is <b>the</b> <b>ceramic</b> remains. The composition of <b>the</b> <b>ceramic</b> materials identifies the region or more specifically the polity that produced them.

40|$|The {{interfacial}} {{interaction of}} veneering ceramic with zirconia {{is still not}} fully understood. This study aimed to characterize morphologically and chemically <b>the</b> zirconia-veneering <b>ceramic</b> interface. Three zirconia-veneering conditions were investigated: 1) zirconia–veneering ceramic fired on sandblasted zirconia, 2) zirconia–veneering ceramic on as-sintered zirconia, and 3) alumina–veneering ceramic (lower {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} [CTE]) on as-sintered zirconia. Polished cross-sectioned ceramic–veneered zirconia specimens were examined using field emission gun scanning electron microscopy (Feg-SEM). In addition, argon-ion thinned zirconia–veneering ceramic interface cross sections were examined using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) –energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) at high resolution. Finally, <b>the</b> zirconia–veneering <b>ceramic</b> interface was quantitatively analyzed for tetragonal-tomonoclinic phase transformation and residual stress using micro-Raman spectroscopy (μRaman). Feg-SEM revealed tight interfaces for all 3 veneering conditions. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) disclosed an approximately 1. 0 -μm transformed zone at sandblasted zirconia, in which distinct zirconia grains were no longer observable. Straight grain boundaries and angular grain corners were detected up to the interface of zirconia– and alumina–veneering ceramic with as-sintered zirconia. EDS mapping disclosed within <b>the</b> zirconia–veneering <b>ceramic</b> a few nanometers thick calcium/aluminum-rich layer, touching the as-sintered zirconia base, with an equally thick silicon-rich/aluminum-poor layer on top. μRaman revealed t-ZrO 2 -to-m-ZrO 2 phase transformation and residual compressive stress at the sandblasted zirconia surface. The difference in CTE between zirconia– and <b>the</b> alumina–veneering <b>ceramic</b> resulted in residual tensile stress within the zirconia immediately adjacent to its interface with <b>the</b> veneering <b>ceramic.</b> <b>The</b> rather minor chemical elemental shifts recorded in <b>the</b> veneering <b>ceramic</b> did not suffice to draw definitive conclusions regarding potential chemical interaction of <b>the</b> veneering <b>ceramic</b> with zirconia.

Iron was obtained in greater quantities from locally available turf ores; its metallurgy and processing were improved, resulting in the manufacturing of stronger and more resistant tools and weapons. <b>The</b> <b>ceramic</b> shops used the potter's wheel and produced with great precision (especially the Tyniec group) baked, thin walled, painted vessels, {{one of the best}} in Europe.

This is thought to depict a preliminary marriage ceremony. As with the Museum bowl's Sydney Cove image, no directly related, surviving, version is known that would have been used by <b>the</b> <b>ceramic</b> artists to paint the Aboriginal group. The closest match is a drawing after an apparently now-lost original sketch by Nicolas-Martin Petit, artist on the 1800–1803 French expedition to Australia led by Nicolas Baudin. Research made around 2009–2012, indicated that during Baudin's expedition, a report was prepared for Emperor Napoleon on the feasibility of capturing the British colony at Sydney Cove. As this expedition progressed around coastal Australia, Petit began to specialise in the drawing of portraits of indigenous peoples. The French expedition arrived at Port Jackson on 25April 1802. Petit's drawing was copied for publication as plate 114 in the Voyage autour du monde : entrepris par ordre du roi (Paris, 1825) , regarding a voyage around the world (1817–1820) led by Louis-Claude de Saulces de Freycinet.
