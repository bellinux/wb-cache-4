5|$|Found on or {{near the}} bottom, the blackmouth {{catshark}} favors a muddy habitat. There is little evidence for segregation by sex. A number of studies in the northern and western Mediterranean have reported <b>that</b> <b>adults</b> occur deeper than juveniles. Other studies though have found no such pattern. It is possible that areas such as the waters off southern France offer a habitat suitable for sharks of all ages. Another explanation with some scientific support is <b>that</b> <b>adults</b> are most common at intermediate depths, while young sharks are restricted to shallower water and both adults and juveniles are found in deeper water. If true, the age-depth inconsistencies observed from previous research could have resulted from incomplete depth sampling.|$|E

It jumps well, and can be used for dressage. Originally, breed club shows did not allow people over the age of 16 to show POAs under saddle; adults could, however, show them in halter or driving classes. In 1973, the age limit for riders was raised to 18, and in 1987 it was decided <b>that</b> <b>adults</b> 19 and over could show horses two to four years old under saddle.|$|E

5|$|Hunting {{areas are}} often located 100km (60mi) or more, {{offshore}} from the nest sites, although when feeding their young, the birds venture out only half that distance. It {{has been found}} <b>that</b> <b>adults</b> bringing fish to their chicks tend to arrive in groups. This is thought to benefit the bird by reducing kleptoparasitism by the Arctic skua which harasses puffins until they drop their fish loads. Predation by the great skua (Catharacta skua) is also reduced by several birds arriving simultaneously.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Whitlock et al. {{described}} a juvenile skull {{at the time}} referred to Diplodocus (CM11255) that differed greatly from adult skulls of the same genus: its snout was not blunt, and the teeth were {{not confined to the}} front of the snout.

5|$|To {{support the}} lambeosaurine affinities of Eolambia, Kirkland {{conducted}} a phylogenetic analysis; the tree recovered by his analysis, which accordingly places Eolambia {{as the most}} basal lambeosaurine, is reproduced below. Despite the evidence he cited {{in support of this}} position, Kirkland also noted a seemingly inconsistent trait. As observed in the juvenile ilium he initially described, the antitrochanter – a projection on the ilium that limits the greater trochanter of the femur – is more poorly developed than would be expected for a basal hadrosaurid. Michael Brett-Surman noted <b>that</b> <b>adults</b> may have had a better-developed antitrochanter. On the other hand, the derived lambeosaurine Hypacrosaurus has a well-developed antitrochanter even at the hatchling stage. Kirkland noted the possibility that basal hadrosaurids developed their antitrochanter later in life than derived hadrosaurids such as Hypacrosaurus. He thus remarked that adult Eolambia specimens would resolve this issue.|$|E
5|$|Two main {{aspects of}} adult {{attachment}} have been studied. The organization {{and stability of}} the mental working models that underlie the attachment styles is explored by social psychologists interested in romantic attachment. Developmental psychologists interested in the individual's state of mind with respect to attachment generally explore how attachment functions in relationship dynamics and impacts relationship outcomes. The organization of mental working models is more stable while the individual's state of mind with respect to attachment fluctuates more. Some authors have suggested <b>that</b> <b>adults</b> do not hold a single set of working models. Instead, on one level they {{have a set of}} rules and assumptions about attachment relationships in general. On another level they hold information about specific relationships or relationship events. Information at different levels need not be consistent. Individuals can therefore hold different internal working models for different relationships.|$|E
5|$|Adult {{specimens}} of Limusaurus show morphological traits associated with herbivory that are shared {{with other groups}} of herbivorous theropods, including the Ornithomimosauria, Therizinosauria, Oviraptorosauria, and Alvarezsauroidea, along with the troodontid Jinfengopteryx. In particular, adult specimens are characterized {{by the presence of}} stomach stones (gastroliths), with older adults having gastroliths that are larger and more numerous than those of younger adults; the size and quantity of these gastroliths are comparable to those of birds in young adults, and those of ornithomimosaurs and oviraptorosaurs in old adults. These groups of theropods all used gastroliths in processing plant matter, suggesting that Limusaurus did the same; the increased amount of gastroliths in older adults may be indicative of the gut's ability to finely process plant matter increasing with age. An isotope analysis of the available {{specimens of}} Limusaurus specimens likewise showed <b>that</b> <b>adults</b> consistently match the isotope signatures of other herbivorous dinosaurs; however, in the same analysis, juveniles and subadults were found to vary greatly in their isotopic signatures. This indicates that juveniles were likely omnivorous, but switched to strict herbivory as they aged. This is comparable to the diet shift experienced by the aforementioned mullets and armored catfish.|$|E

5|$|Wilder's colleague, {{paediatrician}} Mynie Peterman, later formulated {{the classic}} diet, with {{a ratio of}} one gram of protein per kilogram of body weight in children, 10–15g of carbohydrate per day, and the remainder of calories from fat. Peterman's work in the 1920s established the techniques for induction and maintenance of the diet. Peterman documented positive effects (improved alertness, behaviour and sleep) and adverse effects (nausea and vomiting due to excess ketosis). The diet proved to be very successful in children: Peterman reported in 1925 that 95% of 37 young patients had improved seizure control on the diet and 60% became seizure-free. By 1930, the diet had also been studied in 100 teenagers and adults. Clifford Barborka, also from the Mayo Clinic, reported that 56% of those older patients improved on the diet and 12% became seizure-free. Although the adult results are similar to modern studies of children, they did not compare as well to contemporary studies. Barborka concluded <b>that</b> <b>adults</b> were least likely {{to benefit from the}} diet, {{and the use of the}} ketogenic diet in adults was not studied again until 1999.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{hippocampus}} {{is involved}} in declarative memory and produces new neurons throughout adulthood. Numerous experiments have been aimed at testing the possibility <b>that</b> <b>adult</b> neurogenesis is required for learning and memory. However, progress has been encum-bered by the fact <b>that</b> abating <b>adult</b> neurogenesis usually affects other biological processes, confounding the interpretation of such experi-ments. In an effort to circumvent this problem, we used a reverse approach to test the role of neurogenesis in hippocampus-dependent learning, exploiting the low levels of adult neurogenesis in the MRL/MpJ strain of mice compared with other mouse strains. We observed <b>that</b> <b>adult</b> MRL/MpJ mice produce 75 % fewer new neurons in the dentate gyrus than age-matched C 57 BL/ 6 mice. Learning-induced synaptic remodeling, spatial learning, and visual recognition learning were reduced in MRL/MpJ mice compared with C 57 BL/ 6 mice. When MRL/ MpJ mice were allowed unlimited access to running wheels, neurogene-sis along with spatial learning and visual recognition learning were increased to levels comparable to those in running C 57 BL/ 6 mice. To-gether, these results suggest <b>that</b> <b>adult</b> neurogenesis is correlated with spatial learning and visual recognition learning, possibly by modulating morphological plasticity in the dentate gyrus.

40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that education is associated with later retirement from the labour market. In this paper, we examine whether adult education, involving enrolees aged 42 or above, delays retirement to potentially increase labour force participation among the elderly. With Swedish register data of transcripts from adult education and annual earnings, which encompasses 1979 - 2004 and 1982 - 2004 respectively, we exploit the fact <b>that</b> <b>adult</b> education is a large-scale phenomenon in Sweden and construct a measure of the timing of the transition from being self-supported by productive work to being supported by pension transfers. We match samples of treated and controls on the propensity score and use non-parametric estimation of survival rates.
