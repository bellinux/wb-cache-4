40|$|We {{developed}} an assay in which single-strand breakage (ssb) and double-strand breakage (dsb) of intracellular DNA by chemical agents can be accurately quantitated and differentiated. Escherichia coli cells containing plasmid pBR 322 DNA were incubated with the antitumor antibiotics bleomycin A 2 (BLM A 2) or <b>talisomycin</b> A (TLM A). The plasmid DNA was isolated and then analyzed by electrophoresis on 1 % agarose gels {{to separate the}} following conformational forms of plasmid DNA: (i) native, covalently closed, super helical, form I; (ii) nicked, relaxed circular, form II; and (iii) double-strand broken, linear, form III. Quantitation by densitometric analysis of the gels showed that BLM A 2 and TLM A were equally active {{in terms of the}} concentrations of drug necessary to reduce equivalent amounts of form I DNA in the cells, whereas in vitro (using isolated pBR 322 DNA as a drug substrate) twofold more TLM A than BLM A 2 was required to produce an equivalent amount of reduction in form I DNA. TLM A produced more intracellular dsb than did BLM A 2. The intracellular dsb activities (dsb/ssb ratio) measured from BLM A 2 and TLM A were equivalent to those measured for the respective agents when isolated pBR 322 DNA was used as the substrate. In E. coli both ssb and dsb were repaired, but TLM A damage was repaired more slowly and to a lesser extent, which may reflect the relative frequency of dsb...|$|E
