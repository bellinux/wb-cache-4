25|$|A {{consequence}} of a tailless delta design, {{such as in the}} Viggen, is that the elevons, which replace more conventional control surfaces, operate with a small effective moment arm; their use adds substantial weight to the aircraft at takeoff and landing. Hinged leading edge surfaces can help counteract this, but an even more effective tool is the canard. The canard surfaces were positioned behind the inlets and placed slightly higher than the main wing, with a higher stall angle than the wing, and were equipped with flaps. The lifting canard surfaces act as a vortex generator for the main wing and therefore provide more lift. An added benefit was that they also improved roll stability in the <b>transonic</b> <b>region.</b> The canard flaps were deployed in conjunction with the landing gear to provide even more lift for takeoff and landing.|$|E

5000|$|When the {{velocity}} of a projectile fired at supersonic muzzle velocity approaches {{the speed of sound}} it enters the <b>transonic</b> <b>region</b> (about Mach 1.2-0.8). In the <b>transonic</b> <b>region,</b> the centre of pressure (CP) of most non spherical projectiles shifts forward as the projectile decelerates. That CP shift affects the (dynamic) stability of the projectile. If the projectile is not well stabilized, it can not remain pointing forward through the <b>transonic</b> <b>region</b> (the projectile starts to exhibit an unwanted precession or coning motion called limit cycle yaw that, if not damped out, can eventually end in uncontrollable tumbling along the length axis). However, even if the projectile has sufficient stability (static and dynamic) to be able to fly through the <b>transonic</b> <b>region</b> and stays pointing forward, it is still affected. The erratic and sudden CP shift and (temporary) decrease of dynamic stability can cause significant dispersion (and hence significant accuracy decay), even if the projectile's flight becomes well behaved again when it enters the subsonic region. This makes accurately predicting the ballistic behavior of projectiles in the <b>transonic</b> <b>region</b> very difficult. Because of this, marksmen normally restrict themselves to engaging targets within the supersonic range of the projectile used.In 2015 the American ballistician Bryan Litz introduced the [...] "Extended Long Range" [...] concept to define rifle shooting at ranges where supersonic fired (rifle) bullets enter the <b>transonic</b> <b>region.</b> According to Litz, [...] "Extended Long Range starts whenever the bullet slows to its transonic range.

50|$|As an {{aircraft}} enters the <b>transonic</b> <b>region</b> {{close to the}} speed of sound, airflow over specific parts can exceed the local critical Mach number and create supersonic shock waves, greatly increasing drag.

For unsteady problems, the preconditioning is introduced within a dual-time framework wherein the physical time-derivatives are used to march the unsteady equations and the preconditioned time-derivatives are used for purposes of numerical discretization and iterative solution. In this paper, we describe the implementation of the preconditioned dual-time methodology in the OVERFLOW code. To demonstrate the performance of the method, we employ both simple and practical unsteady flowfields, including vortex propagation in a low Mach number flow, flowfield of an impulsively started plate (Stokes' first problem) arid a cylindrical jet in a low Mach number crossflow with ground effect. All the results demonstrate that the preconditioning algorithm is responsible for improvements to both numerical accuracy and convergence efficiency and, thereby, enables low Mach number unsteady computations to be performed {{at a fraction of the}} cost of traditional time-marching methods...|$|R

5000|$|For {{aircraft}} and rockets, below Mach [...]8, the nose pressure drag is essentially zero for all shapes.

For example, in strictly subsonic rockets a short, blunt, smooth elliptical shape is usually best. In the <b>transonic</b> <b>region</b> and beyond, where the pressure drag increases dramatically, the effect of nose shape on drag becomes highly significant. The factors influencing the pressure drag are the general shape of the nose cone, its fineness ratio, and its bluffness ratio.|$|E

(Plume effects were a new experience for aircraft.) The number three aircraft also gathered information about the effects of external stores (bomb shapes, drop tanks) upon the aircraft's behavior in the <b>transonic</b> <b>region</b> (roughly 0.7 to 1.3 times the speed of sound).

50|$|Supersonic {{aerodynamics}} is {{simpler than}} subsonic aerodynamics because the airsheets {{at different points}} along the plane often can't affect each other. Supersonic jets and rocket vehicles require several times greater thrust to push through the extra aerodynamic drag experienced within the <b>transonic</b> <b>region</b> (around Mach 0.85-1.2). At these speeds aerospace engineers can gently guide air around the fuselage of the aircraft without producing new shock waves but any change in cross area farther down the vehicle leads to shock waves along the body. Designers use the Supersonic area rule and the Whitcomb area rule to minimize sudden changes in size.However, in practical applications, a supersonic aircraft will have to operate stably in both subsonic and supersonic profiles, hence aerodynamic design is more complex.|$|E

40|$|The Doublet Lattice Method, a panel method, is a {{standard}} tool for calculating aerodynamic forces in flutter analysis. However, this method is only correct for subsonic flow conditions. The intention of this report is to investigate the successive kernel expansion method (SKEM), a method from literature, which promise a successful extension of the DLM into <b>transonic</b> <b>regions.</b> The kernel function is expanded as a Taylor series {{with respect to the}} reduced frequency about w*= 0. The first element is representing the quasi steady part of the solution and is corrected by the difference of two steady CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) calculations with different angles of attack. The main advantage over other so called reduced order methods is that no numerical simulations in the flow field are required. Pressure differences are directly calculated at the surface of the wing or aircraft. In contrast to the Transonic Doublet-Lattice Method (TDLM), in which terms are added obtained from one steady CFD simulation, SKEM extrapolates from a quasi steadysolution at w*= 0 to the unsteady pressure differences. In the method is only validated for very low frequencies and only two Taylor coefficients are taken into consideration. This restriction could be successfully disbanded by higher Taylor expansion. The Taylor series is computed using automatic differentiation techniques. Furthermore convergence properties are analyzed and an improved SKEM (iSKEM) is developed. Moreover the method is compared to nonlinear unsteady simulations in the time domain using the DLR TAU-Code and to measurement data of the AGARD LANN wing.

Minimal projectile-shape variations can change the air-resistance and hence the effective range of high powered gun projectiles considerably, especially when they change velocity from the supersonic to the transonic and eventually to subsonic air flow regimes or vice versa during flight. For this kind of applications the Haack shape offers significantly improved characteristics compared to the tangent ogive or even the secant ogive often used for very-low-drag bullets and artillery shells. Only after the end of World War II have Haack shaped projectiles for artillery guns and sniper rifles been produced. Besides that Haack shapes are also applied in modern fast flying aircraft.
