5|$|Dependent stage – At this stage, {{symptoms}} {{build up}} gradually. Hangover symptoms from excessive drinking may {{be confused with}} withdrawal symptoms. Many addicts will maintain their drinking to avoid withdrawal sickness, drinking small amounts frequently. They will <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>hide</b> their drinking problem from others and will avoid gross intoxication.|$|E
5|$|Caroline {{arrives at}} East Hampton {{for her first}} day of work, where she begins work with Guy and Mac. She soon {{develops}} feelings for both of them, first believing that she loves Guy, but then – after a day out with him – realising that it is Mac she truly loves. At the same time, Martin begins {{to fall in love}} with her, and Angela becomes Caroline's lodger. Elsewhere in the hospital, Alan and Joanna <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>hide</b> their relationship from the rest of the staff, unsuccessfully. Then Joanna becomes attracted to Lyndon Jones (Paterson Joseph), the hospital's head of I.T., with Alan becoming jealous of Lyndon.|$|E

25|$|Another female {{tactic to}} counter {{coercion}} {{is to try}} to avoid males that may cause them harm. To do this, females often change their habitats to get away from aggressive males, as is seen in wild Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata). Female bottlenose dolphins behave in similar ways by moving into shallow waters where there are not too many males. Other species that practice mate avoidance are Calopteryx haemorrhoidalis, a species of damselfly, who often <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>hide</b> from large groups of males to avoid harassment.|$|E
25|$|Al and Moo Sleech (Eddie Korbich): Nerdy twin {{brothers}} {{and two of}} Doug's best friends. Doug looks to them for technical help whenever he needs it. In the Disney series, they skip all of the middle school grades and end up going to a high school, but their relationship with Doug and others are still intact. They are each shown to have a crush on Judy. The two <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>hide</b> {{the fact that their}} father is not as intelligent as they are and is a hardworking doughnut baker.|$|E
25|$|The Consolatio {{is a long}} elegiac poem of {{consolation}} to Augustus' wife Livia on {{the death}} of her son Nero Claudius Drusus. The poem opens by advising Livia not to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>hide</b> her sad emotions and contrasts Drusus' military virtue with his death. Drusus' funeral and the tributes of the imperial family are described as are his final moments and Livia's lament over the body, which is compared to birds. The laments of the city of Rome as it greets his funeral procession and the gods are mentioned, and Mars from his temple dissuades the Tiber river from quenching the pyre out of grief.|$|E

25|$|People with aphasia may {{experience}} {{any of the}} following behaviors due to an acquired brain injury, although some of these symptoms may be due to related or concomitant problems such as dysarthria or apraxia and not primarily due to aphasia. Aphasia symptoms can vary based on the location of damage in the brain. Signs and symptoms {{may or may not be}} present in individuals with aphasia and may vary in severity and level of disruption to communication. Often those with aphasia will <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>hide</b> their inability to name objects by using words like thing. So when asked to name a pencil they may say it is a thing used to write.|$|E
25|$|Each team {{consisted}} of 40 to 50 men. The best players were highly prized, and villages gave them houses, planted their fields for them, and overlooked their misdeeds {{in an effort}} to keep such players on their teams. Players scored one point if they hit the goalpost with the ball, and two points if the ball landed in the nest. Eleven points won the game. Play was rough: players would pile on fallen players, walk on them, kick them, including in the face, pull on arms and legs and stuff dirt in each other's mouths. Players were told to die before letting go of the ball. They would <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>hide</b> the ball in their mouths; other players would choke them or kick them in the stomach to force the ball out. Arms and legs were broken. Players laid out on the ground would be revived by a bucket of cold water. There were occasional deaths. According to Father Paiva, five games in a row had ended in riots.|$|E
25|$|After {{recording}} an 8–8 {{record in}} 1988, Elway once again led {{his team to}} the Super Bowl after the 1989 season, with yet another win over the Browns in the AFC championship game, going on to face the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl XXIV. However this game ended even worse for the Broncos than their previous Super Bowl losses. San Francisco blew out Denver 55–10, the most lopsided score in Super Bowl history. Although Elway scored the only touchdown for his team on a three-yard run, his performance was abysmal: 10 out of 26 completions for 108 yards with no touchdown passes and two interceptions. But he didn't <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>hide</b> from the media after the game or downplay his dismal performance. And {{when he was asked}} if he {{wanted to go back to}} the Super Bowl after three losses, he responded that he wanted to go back every year, even if his team kept losing. Still by this point, many doubted that he would ever win a Super Bowl in his career.|$|E

25|$|Women Against Pornography's best-known tactic was {{a guided}} tour of the {{pornography}} and prostitution outlets in Times Square, which they led twice a week for a suggested contribution of $5.00. (In San Francisco, WAVPM had conducted similar tours in the red-light districts of that city.) Lynn Campbell suggested that people who did not consume pornography knew very little about the content of the pornography or the atmosphere in sex shops and live sex shows, and that actual guided tours of the sex industry in Times Square would provide an excellent educational tool. Susan Brownmiller planned an itinerary for the tour and wrote a script for the guides (with the help of information supplied by Carl Weisbrod, a police officer tasked with finding and closing down underground brothels in Midtown, and Maggie Smith, the owner of a neighborhood bar). The tours often involved unplanned encounters—being physically thrown out by enraged store managers, watching businessmen <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>hide</b> from the tourists, or talking briefly with nude performers while they took their breaks. After a reporter for The New York Times took one of the first tours and wrote a feature article for the Style section, WAP received coverage in People, Time, The Philadelphia Inquirer, European newspapers, local TV news programs and talk shows in New York City, and The Phil Donahue Show in Chicago.|$|E
500|$|The film {{relied on}} subtext, {{requiring}} the actors to [...] "read between the lines" [...] {{for a number}} of their scenes. Most of the sentiments are understated, and Burshtein avoided having any of the characters break down or openly become angry when pressured. Yaron described a scene between Yochay and Rivka as her favorite, saying, [...] "I think it's {{because there is so much}} pain there; it touches you the most when people feel something and <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>hide</b> it and you see it." ...|$|E
500|$|... "One Minute" [...] is an {{alternative}} rock song with electropop influences, and begins with Clarkson singing, [...] "You're going crazy, running on empty / You can't {{make up your mind}} / You <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>hide</b> it, but you had to say it / Restless all this time." [...] It is composed in the key of A major and is set in time signature of common time, with a tempo of 124 beats per minute. Clarkson's vocal range spans over an octave, from A3 to D5. Critics have observed the influence of 1980s music on the song, while Talia Kraines of BBC Music compared it to pop rock songs released by singers Ashlee Simpson and Lindsay Lohan. A reviewer for Billboard commented on the song's structure, writing that [...] "One Minute" [...] consists of [...] "rapid-fire give-and-take verses".|$|E

500|$|Having {{fulfilled}} his First National contract, Chaplin {{was free}} to make his first picture as an independent producer. In November 1922, he began filming A Woman of Paris, a romantic drama about ill-fated lovers. Chaplin intended {{it to be a}} star-making vehicle for Edna Purviance, and did not appear in the picture himself other than in a brief, uncredited cameo. He wished for the film to have a realistic feel and directed his cast to give restrained performances. In real life, he explained, [...] "men and women <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>hide</b> their emotions rather than seek to express them". A Woman of Paris premiered in September 1923 and was acclaimed for its subtle approach, then an innovation. The public, however, seemed to have little interest in a Chaplin film without his presence, and it was a box office disappointment. The filmmaker was hurt by this failure – he had long wanted to produce a dramatic film and was proud of the result – and withdrew A Woman of Paris from circulation as soon as he could.|$|E
500|$|Marge and Homer {{now need}} a {{babysitter}} and hire Ms. Botz through the local [...] "Rubber Baby Buggy Bumper babysitting service" [...] (however, {{they have to}} call themselves the [...] "Samsons", since their kids have a rather bad reputation with the babysitting service, and are effectively blacklisted). On Marge's advice, Ms. Botz puts Maggie to bed and has Bart and Lisa watch The Happy Little Elves. When Bart tries to suggest alternate viewing, Ms. Botz quickly puts him in his place because she has dealt with troublesome children like him before. After Ms. Botz leaves the room Bart tunes into a station airing America's Most Armed and Dangerous (a parody of America's Most Wanted), which profiles a wanted burglar nicknamed [...] "The Babysitter Bandit." [...] A mug shot of the suspect shows Bart and Lisa that Ms. Botz is [...] "The Babysitter Bandit." [...] Ms. Botz enters {{the living room and}} realizes that her cover has been blown. Bart and Lisa <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>hide,</b> but she easily finds them, ties them up and forces them to watch The Happy Little Elves as she continues packing the family's possessions into her suitcases. Maggie eventually wakes up and goes downstairs to discover that her siblings are tied up and watching TV. Maggie frees Bart and Lisa, and Bart is able to knock out Ms. Botz with a baseball bat.|$|E

2500|$|Almost all {{recorded}} bear {{attacks in}} the wild have resulted from the human surprising the bear. Hunters are the people most at risk of bear attacks because, as Tom Smith, a U.S. Geographical Survey research biologist, describes, [...] "Hunters typically aren't making any noise, and they sleuth around while wearing camo." [...] Hunters try to be silent and, though many hunters wear reflective clothing {{so as not to}} become targets for other hunters, they <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>hide</b> their movements so as not to startle game. Most bear attacks result from hunters suddenly appearing in front of them, startling a bear into an instinctive act of aggression.|$|E

He also stated the sampling they do is legitimately done, not something they <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>hide.</b> Bangalter elaborated that the newly recorded elements were implemented {{in a way that was}} equivalent to [...] "creating fake samples [...] where people think there are samples from disco records or funk records." [...] Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo estimated that half of the sampled material on Discovery was played live and re-recorded by the duo, and emphasized that the resulting quality of the music was more important than the ego of who played which instruments.|$|E
