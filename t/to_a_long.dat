5|$|During the 1920s and 1930s, {{the city}} re-emerged {{as a major}} tourist {{destination}} centered on casinos and other vice businesses. Featuring venues, such as the famed Balinese Room, the city became nationally known as the sin city of the Gulf. The illegal businesses were finally closed in the 1950s, leading <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>long,</b> stagnant economic period. Many businesses relocated off of the island, though some, such as the insurance businesses and the medical school, remained.|$|E

5|$|However, Sigurd's line barely survived {{him and it}} was Torf-Einarr, Rognvald's son by a slave, {{who founded}} a dynasty that {{controlled}} the islands for centuries after his death. He was succeeded by his son Thorfinn Skull-splitter and during this time the deposed Norwegian King Eric Bloodaxe often used Orkney as a raiding base before being killed in 954.

5|$|Burchard du Puiset (died 1196) was {{a medieval}} Anglo-Norman clergyman and {{treasurer}} of the diocese of York. Either the nephew or son of Hugh du Puiset, the Bishop of Durham, Burchard held a number of offices in the dioceses of York and Durham before being appointed treasurer by King Richard I of England in 1189. His appointment was opposed by the newly appointed Archbishop Geoffrey, which led <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> dispute between Geoffrey and Burchard that was not resolved until the mid 1190s. After the death of Hugh du Puiset, Burchard was {{a candidate for the}} Hugh's old bishopric, but lost out in the end to another candidate. Burchard died in 1196.|$|E
5|$|Hugh Nonant (sometimes Hugh de Nonant; died 27 March 1198) was {{a medieval}} Bishop of Coventry in England. A great-nephew and nephew of two Bishops of Lisieux, {{he held the}} office of archdeacon in that diocese before serving {{successively}} Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury and King Henry II of England. Diplomatic successes earned him the nomination to Coventry, but diplomatic missions after his elevation led <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> delay before he was consecrated. After King Henry's death, Nonant served Henry's son, King Richard I, who rewarded him {{with the office of}} sheriff in three counties. Nonant replaced his monastic cathedral chapter with secular clergy, and attempted to persuade his fellow bishops to do the same, but was unsuccessful. When King Richard was captured and held for ransom, Nonant supported Prince John's efforts to seize power in England, but had to purchase Richard's favour when the king returned.|$|E
5|$|Hull Castle was an {{artillery}} fort in Kingston upon Hull in England. Together with two supporting blockhouses, it defended {{the eastern side}} of the River Hull, and was constructed by King Henry VIII to protect against attack from France as part of his Device programme in 1542. The castle had two large, curved bastions and a rectangular keep at its centre; the blockhouses to the north and south had three curved bastions supporting guns, and a curtain wall and moat linked the blockhouses and castle. The construction project used material from recently dissolved monasteries, and cost £21,056. The town took over responsibility for these defences in 1553, leading <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> running dispute with the Crown as to whether the civic authorities were fulfilling their responsibilities to maintain them.|$|E

5|$|It's {{strange to}} hear Uncle Tupelo {{mentioned}} {{because what we}} were doing was in such a long line of musical history. People are wrong in starting with us and saying we started anything because we were just picking up the ball, starting with Woody Guthrie and on to the early '60s and the Flying Burrito Brothers that we were influenced by. We didn't start a genre. We contributed <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> line of fairly good music. That's the way we looked at it at the time—doing what was right for the song.|$|E
5|$|Nonetheless, the Norse {{tradition}} {{states that}} Rognvald Eysteinsson received Orkney and Shetland from Harald as an earldom as reparation {{for the death}} of his son in battle in Scotland, and then passed the earldom on to his brother Sigurd the Mighty. Sigurd's line barely survived him and it was Torf-Einarr, Rognvald's son by a slave, who founded a dynasty that controlled the Northern Isles for centuries after his death. He was succeeded by his son Thorfinn Turf-Einarsson and during this time the deposed Norwegian King Eric Bloodaxe often used Orkney as a raiding base before being killed in 954. Thorfinn's death and presumed burial at the broch of Hoxa, on South Ronaldsay, then led <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> period of dynastic strife. Whatever the historical details, it seems likely that Orkney and Shetland were being rapidly absorbed into Norse culture by this time.|$|E
5|$|Only a few shark {{attacks of}} {{uncertain}} provenance {{have been attributed}} to the porbeagle. It is well regarded as a game fish by recreational anglers. The meat and fins of the porbeagle are highly valued, which has led <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> history of intense human exploitation. However, this species cannot sustain heavy fishing pressure due to its low reproductive capacity. Direct commercial fishing for the porbeagle, principally by Norwegian longliners, led to stock collapses in the eastern North Atlantic in the 1950s, and the western North Atlantic in the 1960s. The porbeagle continues to be caught throughout its range, both intentionally and as bycatch, with varying degrees of monitoring and management. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the porbeagle as Vulnerable worldwide, and as either Endangered or Critically Endangered in different parts of its northern range.|$|E

The game's TED engine can render 3D outdoor environments and simulate physics; the latter enables such effects as procedural animation.|$|E
5|$|The {{first known}} fossils of the closely related Mapusaurus {{were found in}} a bonebed {{consisting}} of several individuals at different growth stages. In their 2006 description of the genus, Coria and Currie suggested that though this could be due <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> term or coincidental accumulation of carcasses, the presence of different growth stages of the same taxon indicated the aggregation was not coincidental. In a 2006 National Geographic article, Coria stated that the bonebed was probably {{the result of a}} catastrophic event, and that the presence of mainly medium-sized individuals, with very few young or old, is normal for animals that form packs. Therefore, Coria said, large theropods may have hunted in groups, which would be advantageous when hunting gigantic sauropods.|$|E
5|$|The {{lands and}} offices of Urse's brother Robert were divided between Beauchamp and Robert Marmion. Marmion and Beauchamp {{disagreed}} about {{the division of}} the lands, leading <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> dispute between the two families that was only settled in the late 12th century. Some sources state that another daughter of Urse d'Abetot married Robert Marmion, which was the reason for {{the division of the}} lands and offices between the two men. Other sources are less sure, accepting this as one possibility among several for the divided inheritance between the Marmion and Beauchamp families. Because there are no contemporary sources showing that Urse had any children besides his son and the daughter who married Beauchamp, another possibility is that Urse's brother Robert had a daughter who married Marmion, and that Urse managed to acquire part of her inheritance on the strength of his friendship with King William II of England.|$|E

5|$|The long tail of Kentrosaurus {{results in}} a {{position}} of the center of mass that is unusually far back for a quadrupedal animal. It rests {{just in front of the}} hip, a position usually seen in bipedal dinosaurs. However, the femora are straight in Kentrosaurus, as opposed to typical bipeds, indicating a straight and vertical limb position. Thus, the hindlimbs, though powered by massive thigh muscles attached <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> ilium, did not support the animal alone, and the very robust forelimbs took up 10 to 15% of the bodyweight.|$|E
5|$|The {{velvet belly}} is a robustly built shark with a {{moderately}} long, broad, flattened snout. The mouth has thin, smooth lips. The upper teeth are small, {{with a narrow}} central cusp and usually fewer than three pairs of lateral cusplets. The lower teeth are much larger, with a strongly slanted, blade-like cusp {{at the top and}} interlocking bases. The five pairs of gill slits are tiny, comparable in size to the spiracles. Both dorsal fins bear stout, grooved spines at the front, with the second much longer than the first and curved. The first dorsal fin originates behind the short and rounded pectoral fins; the second dorsal fin is twice the size of the first and originates behind the pelvic fins. The anal fin is absent. The tail is slender, leading <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> caudal fin with a small lower lobe and a low upper lobe with a prominent ventral notch near the tip.|$|E
5|$|Waller mustered his men in Farnham Park near 10:30p.m., on 12 December. At around midnight, 5,000 of Waller's men marched {{west from}} Farnham toward Basing House. The Parliamentarians marched {{about two miles}} in this {{direction}} (in order to confuse Royalist scouts), until around 1:00a.m., before abruptly turning south toward Alton. The march was quick and quiet, owing <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> frost which had hardened the roads and Waller's judicious use of wooded areas. Also helpful in Waller's advance was his use of leather guns, here employed {{for the first time}} in the English Civil War. Unlike heavier artillery, a leather gun could be led by a single horse, transported efficiently over difficult terrain, and still be an effective tool for bombardment.|$|E
