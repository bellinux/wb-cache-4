50|$|Perhaps {{the most}} famous boat-shaped burial found in the Philippines is the Manunggul Jar. The jars were {{excavated}} from a Neolithic burial site in Manunggul cave of Tabon Caves at Lipuun Point at Palawan. The jars {{were found to be}} from 890-710 B.C. The main feature of the Manunggul jar is the two human figures seated on a boat at the <b>top</b> <b>handle</b> of its cover. The figures represent the journey of the soul to the afterlife, with another figure serving as his oarsman.|$|E
50|$|Early {{models of}} the {{ejection}} seat were equipped with only an overhead ejection handle which doubled in function by forcing the pilot to assume the right posture and by having him pull a screen down to protect both his face and oxygen mask from the subsequent air blast. Martin Baker added a secondary handle {{in the front of}} the seat to allow ejection even when pilots weren't able to reach upwards because of high g-force. Later (e.g. in Martin Baker's MK9) the <b>top</b> <b>handle</b> was discarded because the lower handle had proven easier to operate and the technology of helmets had advanced to also protect from the air blast.|$|E
50|$|The {{use of a}} scythe is {{traditionally}} called mowing, now often scything to distinguish it from machine mowing. The mower holds the <b>top</b> <b>handle</b> in the left hand and the central one in the right, with the arms straight, the blade parallel and {{very close to the}} ground and the uncut grass to the right. The body is then twisted to the right, the blade hooks the grass and is swung steadily to the left in a long arc ending in front of the mower and depositing the cut grass neatly to the left. The mower takes a small step forward and repeats the motion, proceeding with a steady rhythm, stopping at frequent intervals to hone the blade. The correct technique has a slicing action on the grass, cutting a narrow strip with each stroke, leaving a uniform stubble on the ground and forming a regular windrow on the left.|$|E

25|$|In 1996 Clarke created Artifacts, a {{collection}} of four shovels with the blades down, meant to be leaned against a wall. The <b>top</b> <b>handles</b> are wrapped in colored ribbons: black, green, red and yellow, colors indicative of the American Indian community. Writing, in black marker, travels around the <b>handle,</b> until the <b>top</b> of the blade. The four shovels represent his father and one for his three aunts, who are represented on their own shovel by a photograph affixed before the blade. A cattle brand is welded into each shovel blade, like those found on Clarke's family ranch. His goal with Artifacts is to show how one can dig up the past to reveal American Indians in the world today.|$|R
5000|$|The {{chain brake}} may be {{activated}} deliberately by the operator, or automatically {{by the force}} of a kickback event. In the former, the operator usually rotates his left wrist and knocks the top hand guard forward {{with the back of his}} hand, re-setting it by reaching forward with his fingers to pull the top hand guard backwards. In the case of a kickback event the operator's left hand may be violently dislodged from the handle and the top hand guard will be thrown onto his hand, forcing activation of the chainbrake. Husqvarna models also incorporate a link between the <b>top</b> <b>handle</b> and the chain brake trigger, applying the brake if the saw's bar is forced suddenly upwards. This is known as an [...] "inertia" [...] chainbrake and will allow activation of the chainbrake even if the operator's left hand is not removed from the handle.|$|E
