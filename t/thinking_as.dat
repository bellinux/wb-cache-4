Typical symptoms are tiredness, intolerance to cold, constipation, weight gain, hair loss and slowed <b>thinking,</b> <b>as</b> {{well as a}} slowed heart rate and low blood pressure. In children, hypothyroidism leads to delayed growth and in extreme inborn forms to a syndrome called cretinism.|$|E
5|$|Skilling {{believed}} that if employees were constantly worried about cost, it would hinder original <b>thinking.</b> <b>As</b> a result, extravagant spending was rampant throughout the company, especially among the executives. Employees had large expense accounts and many executives were paid sometimes {{twice as much as}} competitors. In 1998, the top 200 highest-paid employees received $193 million from salaries, bonuses, and stock. Two years later, the figure jumped to $1.4 billion.|$|E
5|$|The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a coming-of-age epistolary {{novel by}} American writer Stephen Chbosky which was first {{published}} on February 1, 1999, by Pocket Books. Set in the early 1990s, the novel follows Charlie, an introverted teenager, through his freshman {{year of high school}} in a Pittsburgh suburb. The novel details Charlie’s unconventional style of <b>thinking</b> <b>as</b> he navigates between the worlds of adolescence and adulthood, and attempts to deal with poignant questions spurred by his interactions with both his friends and family.|$|E

Joker in the film remains a model of humane <b>thinking,</b> <b>as</b> {{evidenced}} by his moral struggle in the sniper episode and elsewhere. He works to overcome his own meekness, rather than to compete with other Marines. The film omits the book's showing his eventual domination over Animal Mother.|$|E
25|$|The freedom {{given to}} Corbusier by the Savoyes {{resulted}} {{in a house that}} was governed more by his five principles than any requirements of the occupants.

25|$|In {{his book}} Psychology of Invention in the Mathematical Field, Hadamard uses introspection to {{describe}} mathematical thought processes. In {{sharp contrast to}} authors who identify language and cognition, he describes his own mathematical <b>thinking</b> <b>as</b> largely wordless, often accompanied by mental images that represent the entire solution to a problem. He surveyed 100 of the leading physicists of the day (approximately 1900), asking them how they did their work.|$|E

Rabinow deals directly with the problem of venues in the work Synthetic Anthropos (with Gaymon Bennett) (2009). In that work Rabinow and Bennett argue that the question of where and how the composition of equipment takes place is itself a primary problem site.|$|E

25|$|Much {{paper has}} been {{consumed}} by historians of science ruminating on this strange and somewhat unclear idea. Huxley {{was wrong to}} pitch the loss of orders in the Phanerozoic as low as 7%, {{and he did not}} estimate the number of new orders which evolved. Persistent types sat rather uncomfortably next to Darwin's more fluid ideas; despite his intelligence, it took Huxley a surprisingly long time to appreciate some of the implications of evolution. However, gradually Huxley moved away from this conservative style of <b>thinking</b> <b>as</b> his understanding of palaeontology, and the discipline itself, developed.|$|E

25|$|An {{important}} psychological {{affect on}} Hilde was the coercion {{to embody the}} patriarchal fascist belief system {{of the time and}} to inculcate it into her own personal identity. She was made to feel inferior and submissive, but also encouraged to never exclude herself from a group. This personal type of fascism aided in the rally of Austrian youth to support the Nazi cause during the Mühlviertler Hasenjagd. Many years after the period of National Socialism, it was still difficult for Hilde to extricate herself from this pattern of <b>thinking.</b> <b>As</b> an adult, she still felt extreme anxiety about being excluded from groups and events.|$|E
25|$|For Hegel, {{the inner}} {{movement}} of reality {{is the process}} of God <b>thinking,</b> <b>as</b> manifested {{in the evolution of the}} universe of nature and thought; that is, Hegel argued that, when fully and properly understood, reality is being thought by God as manifested in a person's comprehension of this process in and through philosophy. Since human thought is the image and fulfillment of God's thought, God is not ineffable (so incomprehensible as to be unutterable) but can be understood by an analysis of thought and reality. Just as humans continually correct their concepts of reality through a dialectical process, so God himself becomes more fully manifested through the dialectical process of becoming.|$|E

There was no general global return to Keynesian economics in the first 8 years of the 2000s. European policy became slightly more interventionist {{after the start of}} the 21st century, but the shift in a Keynesian direction was smaller than was the case for the US and the UK. However, continental Europeans had not generally embraced free market <b>thinking</b> <b>as</b> wholeheartedly as had the English-speaking world in the 1980s and 1990s. Japan had been using moderate Keynesian policies in the nineties, and switched to neoliberalism with the government of Junichirō Koizumi in 2001–06.|$|E

In one example explained by Hwang, although Kim Il-sung required his ministers to be loyal to him, he nonetheless and frequently sought their advice during decision-making. In contrast, Kim Jong-il demanded absolute obedience and agreement from his ministers and party officials with no advice or compromise, and he viewed any slight deviation from his <b>thinking</b> <b>as</b> a sign of disloyalty. According to Hwang, Kim Jong-il personally directed even minor details of state affairs, such as the size of houses for party secretaries and the delivery of gifts to his subordinates.|$|E
25|$|Thus Galen {{summarised}} and synthesised {{the work}} of his predecessors, and it is in Galen's words (Galenism) that Greek medicine was handed down to subsequent generations, such that Galenism became the means by which Greek medicine was known to the world. Often, this was in the form of restating and reinterpreting, such as in Magnus of Nisibis' 4th-century work on urine, which was in turn translated into Arabic. Yet the full importance of his contributions was not appreciated till long after his death. Galen's rhetoric and prolificity were so powerful as to convey the impression that there was little left to learn. The term Galenism has subsequently taken on both a positive and pejorative meaning as one that transformed medicine in late antiquity yet so dominated subsequent <b>thinking</b> <b>as</b> to stifle further progress.|$|E
25|$|Psychology {{has much}} to discuss about pseudoscience <b>thinking,</b> <b>as</b> it is the illusory {{perceptions}} of causality and effectiveness of numerous individuals {{that needs to be}} illuminated. Research suggests that illusionary thinking happens in most people when exposed to certain circumstances such as reading a book, an advertisement or the testimony of others are the basis of pseudoscience beliefs. It is assumed that illusions are not unusual, and given the right conditions, illusions are able to occur systematically even in normal emotional situations. One of the things pseudoscience believers quibble most about is that academic science usually treats them as fools. Minimizing these illusions in the real world is not simple. To this aim, designing evidence-based educational programs can be effective to help people identify and reduce their own illusions.|$|E
