25|$|La Naus√©e allows Sartre {{to explain}} his {{philosophy}} in simplified terms. Roquentin is the classic existentialist hero whose attempts to pierce the veil of perception lead him to a strange combination of disgust and wonder. For {{the first part of}} the novel, Roquentin has flashes of nausea that emanate from mundane objects. These flashes appear seemingly randomly, from staring at a crumpled piece of paper in the gutter to picking up a rock on the beach. The feeling he perceives is pure disgust: a contempt so refined that it almost shatters his mind each time it occurs. As the novel progresses, <b>the</b> <b>nausea</b> appears more and more frequently, though he is still unsure of what it actually signifies. However, at the base of a chestnut tree in a park, he receives a piercingly clear vision of what <b>the</b> <b>nausea</b> actually is. Existence itself, the property of existence to be something rather than nothing was what was slowly driving him mad. He no longer sees objects as having qualities such as color or shape. Instead, all words are separated from the thing itself, and he is confronted with pure being.|$|E
25|$|There is no cure. Attacks {{are often}} treated with {{medications}} {{to help with}} <b>the</b> <b>nausea</b> and anxiety. Measures to prevent attacks are overall poorly supported by the evidence. A low salt diet, diuretics, and corticosteroids may be tried. Physical therapy may help with balance and counselling may help with anxiety. Injections into the ear or surgery may also be tried if other measures are not effective but are associated with risks. The use of tympanostomy tubes, while popular, is not supported.|$|E

25|$|If {{irritants}} {{are present}} in the food, the enterochromaffin cells release more serotonin to make the gut move faster, i.e., to cause diarrhea, so the gut is emptied of the noxious substance. If serotonin is released in the blood faster than the platelets can absorb it, the level of free serotonin in the blood is increased. This activates 5-HT3 receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone that stimulate vomiting. The enterochromaffin cells not only react to bad food but are also very sensitive to irradiation and cancer chemotherapy. Drugs that block 5HT3 are very effective in controlling <b>the</b> <b>nausea</b> and vomiting produced by cancer treatment, and are considered the gold standard for this purpose.|$|E
25|$|At about 10 pm on December 22, 1933, Mrs. Huffman {{reported}} smelling {{an unusual}} odor, and {{was overcome by}} a feeling of nausea. The odor and <b>the</b> <b>nausea</b> returned again at {{about a half hour}} later, at which time Huffman contacted the police. A third attack occurred around 1 am, this time affecting the entire house. In total, eight members of the Huffman family were affected by the gas, along with Ashby Henderson, a guest staying at the house. Their symptoms included headaches, nausea, facial swelling, and constriction of the mouth and throat. Alice Huffman, the daughter of Cal Huffman, suffered a more severe reaction to the gas than the other residents. Her throat became so constricted that she stopped breathing and had to be resuscitated. She also suffered convulsive fits for several weeks after the attack, though local physician S.F. Driver recorded {{at the time that he}} believed this was most likely due to anxiety brought on by the attack, rather than the effects of the gas itself.|$|E
2500|$|Dizziness, {{fatigue and}} nausea {{are the most}} common {{symptoms}} of motion sickness. Sopite syndrome, in which a person feels fatigue or tiredness, is also associated with motion sickness. [...] "Nausea" [...] in Greek means seasickness (naus means ship). If the motion causing nausea is not resolved, the sufferer will usually vomit. Vomiting often will not relieve the feeling of weakness and nausea, which means the person might continue to vomit until the cause of <b>the</b> <b>nausea</b> is treated.|$|E

2500|$|From the {{psychological}} {{point of view}} Antoine Roquentin {{could be seen as}} an individual suffering from depression, and <b>the</b> <b>nausea</b> itself as one of the symptoms of his condition. Unemployed, living in deprived conditions, lacking human contact, being trapped in fantasies about the 18th century secret agent he is writing the [...] book about, shows [...] Sartre's oeuvre as a follow-up of Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment and Rilke's The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge in search of the precise description of schizophrenia. Rilke's character anticipates Sartre's.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most common}} adverse {{reaction}} is nausea, {{due to a}} difference in the pH from the body and the pH of the sodium fluorescein dye; [...] a number of other factors, however, are considered contributors as well. [...] <b>The</b> <b>nausea</b> usually is transient and subsides quickly. Hives can range from a minor annoyance to severe, and a single dose of antihistamine may give complete relief. [...] Anaphylactic shock and subsequent cardiac arrest and sudden death are very rare, but because they occur within minutes, a health care provider who uses fluorescein should be prepared to perform emergency resuscitation.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, author Meyer Levin, a University of Chicago classmate, {{requested}} Leopold's cooperation in {{writing a novel}} based on the Franks murder. Leopold responded {{that he did not}} wish his story told in fictionalized form, but offered Levin a chance to contribute to his own memoir, which was in progress. [...] Levin, unhappy with that suggestion, went ahead with his book alone, despite Leopold's express objections. [...] The novel, entitled Compulsion, was published in 1956. [...] Levin portrayed Leopold (under the pseudonym Judd Steiner) as a brilliant but deeply disturbed teenager, psychologically driven to kill because of his troubled childhood and an obsession with Loeb. Leopold later wrote that reading Levin's book made him [...] "... physically sick ... More than once I had to lay the book down and wait for <b>the</b> <b>nausea</b> to subside. I felt as I suppose a man would feel if he were exposed stark-naked under a strong spotlight before a large audience." ...|$|E

2500|$|The other {{complaint}} {{is that the}} medicines must be taken {{on an empty stomach}} to facilitate absorption. [...] This can be difficult for patients to follow (for example, shift workers who take their meals at irregular times) and may mean the patient waking up an hour earlier than usual everyday just to take medication. [...] The rules are actually less stringent than many physicians and pharmacists realise: the issue is that the absorption of RMP is reduced if taken with fat, but is unaffected by carbohydrate, protein, or antacids. [...] So the patient can in fact have his or her medication with food as long as the meal does not contain fat or oils (e.g., a cup of black coffee or toast with jam and no butter). Taking the medicines with food also helps ease <b>the</b> <b>nausea</b> that many patients feel when taking the medicines on an empty stomach. [...] The effect of food on the absorption of INH is not clear: two studies have shown reduced absorption with food but one study showed no difference. There is a small effect of food on the absorption of PZA and of EMB that is probably not clinically important.|$|E
2500|$|Antoine Roquentin ‚Äì The {{protagonist of}} the novel, Antoine {{is a former}} adventurer who {{has been living in}} Bouville for three years. Antoine does not keep in touch with family, and has no friends. He is a loner at heart and often likes to listen to other people's conversations and examine their actions. He settles in the fictional French seaport town of Bouville to finish his {{research}} on the life of an 18th-century political figure. But during the winter of 1932 a [...] "sweetish sickness," [...] as he calls nausea, increasingly impinges on almost everything he does or enjoys: his research project, the company of an autodidact who is reading all the books in the local library alphabetically, a physical relationship with a caf√© owner named Fran√ßoise, his memories of Anny, an English girl he once loved, even his own hands and the beauty of nature. Even though he at times admits to trying to find some sort of solace in the presence of others, he also exhibits signs of boredom and lack of interest when interacting with people. His relationship with Fran√ßoise is mostly hygienic in nature, for the two hardly exchange words and, when invited by the Self-Taught Man to accompany him for lunch, he agrees only to write in his diary later that: [...] "I had as much desire to eat with him as I had to hang myself." [...] He can afford not to work, but spends a lot of his time writing a book about a French politician of the eighteenth century. Antoine does not think highly of himself: [...] "The faces of others have some sense, some direction. Not mine. I cannot even decide whether it is handsome or ugly. I think it is ugly because I have been told so." [...] When he starts suffering from <b>the</b> <b>Nausea</b> he feels the need to talk to Anny, but when he finally does, it makes no difference to his condition. He eventually starts to think he does not even exist: [...] "My existence was beginning to cause me some concern. Was I a mere figment of the imagination?" ...|$|E

40|$|Morphine has {{among its}} {{disturbing}} side effects <b>the</b> production of <b>nausea</b> and emesis.
