Any modification of existing techniques that will lessen these demands will be of benefit at surgery in forward areas in war. A previous paper (1) compared a method of small bowel anastomosis using disposable skin staplers with a two-layer handsewn anastomosis using fresh pig ileum. <b>The</b> <b>stapled</b> method was both significantly faster to perform and mechanically superior. In two further studies on a total of 12 pigs <b>the</b> <b>stapled</b> method has been compared with a single-layer and a double-layer handsewn small bowel anastomosis. All 12 pigs recovered from laparotomy without complication. Construction times were recorded. The quality of healing of the anastomoses was assessed by clinical observation, post-mortem and histological examination, and tensiometry. The skill required to perform <b>the</b> <b>stapled</b> anastomoses was estimated subjectively. <b>The</b> <b>stapled</b> technique was consistently faster than the handsewn methods. A Kolmogorov two-sample test showed an improvement in times when comparing <b>the</b> <b>stapled</b> method with <b>the</b> single layer, with a significance of P = 0. 05. An improvement was also seen when <b>the</b> <b>stapled</b> method was compared with the double layer, with a significance of P = 0. 01.
