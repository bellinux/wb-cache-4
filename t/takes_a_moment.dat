5|$|After {{spending}} the night together, Tosh and Tommy return to the hospital as the disruptions intensify, accompanied by Jack. During one disruption, the three witness the 1918 Torchwood team; Jack relays instructions through Tommy {{for them to take}} the 1918 version of Tommy into their custody before the older Tommy arrives. Tommy and Tosh share a goodbye, and Jack briefs Tommy on using the Rift Key before he steps back to 1918 during the next disruption. However, when back in the past, Tommy becomes shell-shocked, and is led back to his bed by nurses; he is unable to operate the Rift Key in his state. At Torchwood's headquarters, Jack and Tosh use the Cardiff Rift to project an image of Tosh into Tommy's mind. Tommy senses some familiarity with Tosh but otherwise does not recognise her. Despite this, Tosh is able to instruct Tommy to activate the Rift Key, and the distortions at the hospital soon dissipate. Recovering from events, Tosh brushes off Owen's sympathy and <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> to consider her short time with Tommy.|$|E

The baby is delivered safely, but Lori dies; Carl <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> to mourn before shooting her in the head to prevent reanimation.|$|E

25|$|When Walter {{arrives in}} Albuquerque – on his 52nd {{birthday}} – he intimidates Gretchen and Elliott into putting his remaining {{money into a}} trust fund for Walter Jr. He then visits Skyler and gives her the location of Hank's body so she can clear herself as a suspect in his death, and finally admits {{to her that he}} entered the meth business for himself, not his family. As a token of appreciation, Skyler lets him see his children one last time. He then arranges to see Lydia, secretly poisoning her with ricin after learning where Jack has taken Jesse. Walt drives to Jack's compound and demands to see Jesse. When they bring Jesse, who has been chained up in a lab and forced to cook meth since his abduction, Walt dives atop him while simultaneously starting a remote machine gun mounted in his car that kills most of Jack's men. Walt and Jesse kill Jack and Todd. Walt urges Jesse to kill him, but Jesse notices Walt had been shot by his own trap and tells him to do it himself. Walt then finds that he has been fatally wounded. He answers a call from Lydia on Todd's phone and coldly informs her that she is going to die. He exchanges a knowing nod with Jesse, who escapes the compound. Walt <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> to admire the lab equipment that Jesse had been using, and finally succumbs to his wounds and collapses dead on the floor as the police arrive and sweep the lab.|$|E
500|$|Tolkien <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> {{to dismiss}} another criticism, that monsters {{should not have}} been made to appear in both halves. He replies he can see the point of no monsters, but not in {{complaining}} about their mere numbers; the poet could not, he argues, have balanced Beowulf's rise to fame through a war in Frisia, against death by dragon. Similarly, he dismisses notions that the poem is primitive: it is instead a late poem, using materials left over from a vanished age: ...|$|E
500|$|Moffat's script {{started by}} repeating Martha's departure. The script {{indicated}} that [...] "this time, we {{stay with the}} Doctor. As before ... the Doctor <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> then slam the controls," [...] and described the Fifth Doctor as having a [...] "frock coat, cricket jersey, and a stick of celery on his lapel". Moffat included several references to Fifth Doctor stories in his script: the Tenth Doctor commented about the Fifth Doctor's attire and his disuse of the sonic screwdriver, saying: [...] "Ooh, I'm the Doctor, I can save the universe with a kettle {{and a piece of}} string and ooh, look at me, I'm wearing a vegetable." [...] A line about the effects of the paradox the TARDIS collision had caused gave an explanation of why the Fifth Doctor looked far older than normal, thus getting around the fact that Peter Davison had left the role over twenty years before. [...] And {{near the end of the}} episode, he refers to Tegan Jovanka, Nyssa, the Cybermen stories Earthshock and The Five Doctors, the Mara serials Kinda and Snakedance, the Time Lords' [...] "funny hats" [...] from Arc of Infinity, and the various Ainley Master stories during Davison's tenure.|$|E

500|$|Olivia and Weiss {{bring the}} {{parchment}} to Walter, who recognizes that Olivia's telekinetic powers {{must be used}} {{to turn off the}} machine in the parallel universe. To prepare Olivia, they use the quantum entangled Selectric typewriter that the shapeshifters had used to contact the parallel universe. Olivia struggles unsuccessfully with trying to activate the typewriter, even with Walter's support. Peter is soon discovered in New York, about {{the same time that the}} machine has been moved into position. Walter and Olivia rejoin him, finding him confused and believing himself to be in the parallel universe. Peter eventually comes to his senses, with Walter believing his confusion to be a temporary result of the head trauma. Astrid calls the trio from the lab, revealing that the typewriter is typing out [...] "Be a better man than your father", a phrase that Olivia and Peter have talked about before, thus giving them hope that Olivia will be able to disengage the parallel universe's device. After she does so, Peter <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> to recall the events of his life, including his experiences with Walter and Olivia, and then steps into the machine.|$|E
500|$|The book {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. New York magazine's James Lim wrote that while Gaga's magazine covers were showing the singer in more modest poses, the book showed the [...] "wild, funky, creative Gaga {{that we all}} know and love". Liesl Bradner of the Los Angeles Times expressed surprise at seeing Gaga without her makeup and stage costumes. [...] "It's when the singer <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> from the madness, pulls back her hair and ditches the costumes, that we see the real girl who is the mastermind behind the monster," [...] Bradner wrote, adding that the release would be special for the fans. Eden Carter Wood of Diva magazine shared the same thought with Bradner and added that the book contained nice portraits of the artist. Arthur House from The Daily Telegraph was positive in his review, while finding the pictures to be glossy and enjoyable. Toronto Stars David Graham compared the book to Madonna's similar styled book called Sex (released in 1992). However, he found a [...] "distinct lack of fanfare surrounding the book". Lady Gaga x Terry Richardson, according to Graham could not generate the same amount of [...] "shock and awe that erupted when Madonna came out with Sex". However he still believed that there were [...] "outrageous — even disturbing — photographs" [...] of Gaga.|$|E
