40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to better {{understand}} the protective effect that social support has on the development of reading in children from a range of SES backgrounds. Because other studies have suggested the importance of teacher quality on children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>reading</b> ability, this was also tested. This study utilized a sample taken from the public-use version of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Cohort (ECLS-K), a large-scale, nationally representative sample of children attending kindergarten in the United States in the fall of the 1998 - 1999 academic year and their families, teachers, and schools. As expected, family SES and the availability of parental social support were important factors in determining children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>reading</b> ability. More specifically, when measured at concurrent time points, social support was found to have a unique buffering effect on the relationship between SES and children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>reading</b> ability such that higher amounts of parental social support served as a protective factor for the development of children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>reading</b> ability who were in lower SES family environments. Teacher quality as operationalized in the present study did not have a significant impact on the relationship between SES and children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>reading</b> ability. Latent growth mixture modeling was used to predict probable class membership in typologies of reading trajectories from the beginning of kindergarten through the end of eighth grade. Contrary to expectations, children 2 ̆ 7 s class membership in typology of reading trajectory over the school years was not found to vary by a combined measure of family SES and parental social support. The utility of conceptualizing parental social support as an integral contextual variable in the development of children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>reading</b> ability, especially those at-risk for reading delays, is discussed...|$|R

40|$|Instead {{of relying}} on machine-scored tests, many {{teachers}} wisely assess children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>reading</b> themselves, in an individualized session with each child.

40|$|Reading {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the learning process. It involves both decoding and comprehension skills. Reading plays a vital role in the acquisition of knowledge, which leads to independent learning. But if the child faces problems in learning to read, then these reading difficulties do compound the other language learning problems, like writing, spelling, pronunciation, comprehension, etc. which affects the child 2 ̆ 7 s progress in school. These reading difficulties block access to a wide range of information acquisition. Therefore the teachers need to be aware of children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>reading</b> difficulties and be able to implement remedial strategies to address these problems. This research study was conducted to identify reading difficulties in English of children at the primary level in the multi-lingual context of Pakistan, where English is a second, third or a foreign language for most of the children. The purpose of the study was to identify children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>reading</b> difficulties and to explore the facilities available for dealing with the same. The study was divided into two phases. Phase I was basically a needs analysis done in a private primary school to identify the children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>reading</b> difficulties by using standardized assessment tools. The language teachers were also interviewed and their reading lessons observed to find out their awareness level for catering to children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>reading</b> difficulties. Phase II was an exploration of the facilities available for dealing with children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>reading</b> difficulties in remedial centers and selected schools. Trained reading teachers were interviewed and their remedial sessions were observed in the remedial centers and the schools working in association with these centers, to recommend possible ways of helping teachers in dealing with reading difficulties of children in a multi-lingual school context. The study revealed that children do have reading difficulties. The test analysis revealed errors of omissions, substitutions, reversals, deletions, repetitions, etc. It was found that these problems are mostly related to children 2 ̆ 7 s lack of language exposure, inappropriate teaching of reading, lack of reading culture, multi-lingual context, etc. The teachers in the sample school were found to be unaware of children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> specific <b>reading</b> difficulties and therefore were not able to remediate the same. In contrast, trained reading teachers in a few remedial centers and schools are providing remedial training to children by using phonic and multi-sensory approaches to remediate the children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>reading</b> difficulties. However, these facilities are very expensive. Therefore only the elite class can afford to access their services Thus this research study highlights the issues related to children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>reading</b> difficulties at the primary level and recommends possible ways of addressing them in the context of the multilingual setting in the majority of schools in Pakistan...|$|R

It is administered and proactively promoted by Lismore and Goonellabah librarians and the Rotary Club of Lismore. The Lismore Let’s Read program received total funding of 30, 000 (August 2005 – June 2008) and aims to encourage families to read to their very young children. Key elements of the strategy include: • giving one of four age-tailored Let 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Read</b> bags to all children aged up to 5 years – containing a free colourful book, a DVD and summary tipsheet demonstrating age-appropriate reading techniques, a list of age-appropriate book suggestions and information about the local library; • enrolling each child receiving a bag with their local library (Lismore or Goonellabah); and • engaging the business sector and service clubs in the project to provide commercial sponsorship to achieve long-term sustainability. Lismore Let’s Read was launched, in August 2005, by the Honourable Kaye Patterson, then the Minister for Family 2 ̆ 6 Community Services.

40|$|Two {{different}} approaches {{are considered to}} the problem of determining seismic velocity ratios from P and S arrival data from a group of earthquakes. Each method arises naturally from a different assumption about the sources of error. If the <b>S</b> <b>reading</b> error is the predominant source of error, S versus P regression, an extension of the Wadati Plot method to pooled data, should be used. If, however, <b>S</b> <b>reading</b> errors do not dominate, a symmetric regression should be used. A natural extension of the latter method allows the determination of station-by-station variation of a/ft. The methods are illustrated with data from an aftershock sequence which occurred off the coast of northern California. The average velocity ratio is not as well determined as the station-by-station variation about the average. However, the results show that the method has some utility in the study of regional variation of seismic velocities...|$|R

40|$|Despite many {{researches}} {{on development}} {{in education and}} psychology, not often is the methodology tested with real data.

40|$|This is a {{study of}} the {{relationship}} between popular women 2 ̆ 7 s culture and academic feminist criticism and thus between two very different and yet mutually dependent constructions of “women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>reading.</b> ” In looking at a variety of indicators of contemporary women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>reading</b> practice {{in and out of the}} academy—from examples of successful women 2 ̆ 7 s fiction in a range of categories, to the reading groups and reading guides that are geared primarily toward women, to the vogue for autobiographical criticism among female and feminist academics—I explore the tension between academic or critical reading and “reading for pleasure” and demonstrate that while efforts on both sides to distinguish the scholarly from the popular have made for some interesting and high-profile debates, they have also woven themselves more subtly into the very fabric of contemporary reading culture. My dissertation treats contemporary women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>reading</b> as a collection of practices that variously support and cut across one another, and defines “women 2 ̆ 7 s culture” itself as something that is produced, marketed, consumed and re-circulated on the literary field through a host of different mechanisms, not least of which is the contemporary novel, boosted by a “pro-novel” discourse that casts novel-reading as itself a form of consciousness-raising. Ultimately, I suggest that reading serves as one of the primary vehicles of “women 2 ̆ 7 s culture” today, helping to sustain a fantasy of collectivity even while strict notions of individual identification and personal growth govern popular reading itself. ...|$|R
