40|$|Objectives. - To {{document}} the childhood <b>teratomas</b> at Tygerberg Hospital {{and compare the}} profile with other African series. Design. - Retrospective review of the clinicopathologic features of 43 cases of childhood <b>teratomas.</b> Tumors were classified according to the World Health Organization criteria for germ cell tumors. Setting. - Tygerberg Hospital, University of Stellenbosch, Cape Town, South Africa. Results. - There were 26 mature, 15 immature, and 2 malignant <b>teratomas.</b> The most common sites were the ovaries and the sacrococcygeal region. Testicular <b>teratomas</b> were absent. The female- to-male ratio for black patients was 5. 5 : 1. There was a peak age incidence in the first 4 years of life, with sacrococcygeal <b>teratomas</b> predominating. A second, smaller peak between 12 and 15 years was seen owing to ovarian <b>teratomas.</b> Immature <b>teratomas</b> presented {{at an earlier age}} than mature <b>teratomas.</b> The majority of ovarian <b>teratomas</b> occurred in patients of mixed race, whereas the extragonadal <b>teratomas</b> were distributed more evenly among the race groups. In black patients and patients of mixed race mature <b>teratomas</b> predominated, whereas in white patients immature <b>teratomas</b> were most common. Conclusions. - The increased occurrence of <b>teratomas</b> among female patients, the large number of ovarian <b>teratomas,</b> the absence of testicular <b>teratomas,</b> and the low incidence of malignant <b>teratomas</b> correspond to the observations of other African series. Certain differences are apparent among the three race groups, namely, a high ratio of female-to-male patients in the black group, a predominance of ovarian <b>teratomas</b> in the mixed-race and black groups, and a predominance of extragonadal and immature <b>teratomas</b> in the white group.

25|$|Polyembryomas, {{the most}} {{immature}} form of <b>teratoma</b> and very rare ovarian tumors, are histologically characterized by having several embryo-like bodies with structures resembling a germ disk, yolk sac, and amniotic sac.

25|$|Immature, or solid, teratomas are {{the most}} common type of ovarian germ cell tumor, making up 40–50% of cases. Teratomas are {{characterized}} by the presence of disorganized tissues arising from all three embryonic germ layers: ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm; immature teratomas also have undifferentiated stem cells that make them more malignant than mature teratomas (dermoid cysts). The different tissues are visible on gross pathology and often include bone, cartilage, hair, mucus, or sebum, but these tissues are not visible from the outside, which appears to be a solid mass with lobes and cysts. Histologically, they have large amounts of neuroectoderm organized into sheets and tubules along with glia; the amount of neural tissue determines the histologic grade. Immature teratomas usually only affect one ovary (10% co-occur with dermoid cysts) and usually metastasize throughout the peritoneum. They can also cause mature <b>teratoma</b> implants to grow throughout the abdomen in a disease called growing <b>teratoma</b> syndrome; these are usually benign but will continue to grow during chemotherapy, and often necessitate further surgery. Unlike mature teratomas, immature teratomas form many adhesions, making them less likely to cause ovarian torsion. There is no specific marker for immature teratomas, but carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), CA-125, CA19-9, or AFP can sometimes indicate an immature <b>teratoma.</b>|$|E

25|$|An {{important}} area for future {{studies in the}} iPSC field is directly testing iPSC tumorigenicity using methods that mimic the approaches {{that would be used}} for regenerative medicine therapies.
