5|$|Calcium is an {{essential}} element needed in large quantities. The Ca2+ ion acts as an electrolyte and is vital <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> muscular, circulatory, and digestive systems; is indispensable to the building of bone; and supports synthesis and function of blood cells. For example, it regulates the contraction of muscles, nerve conduction, and the clotting of blood. As a result, intra- and extracellular calcium levels are tightly regulated by the body. Calcium can play this role because the Ca2+ ion forms stable coordination complexes with many organic compounds, especially proteins; it also forms compounds {{with a wide range}} of solubilities, enabling the formation of skeletons.|$|E
5|$|Gary Lockwood, as Lt. Commander Gary Mitchell, had {{starred in}} the title role of Roddenberry's earlier series on NBC, The Lieutenant; Sally Kellerman was cast as Dr. Elizabeth Dehner. Both actors needed silver eyes, which were {{produced}} by an expert contact lens fabricator who sandwiched wrinkled tinfoil between two sclera contact lenses which covered the entire eye. These were outdated even in the 1960s and dangerous <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> actors' eyes. Although Kellerman could insert and remove the prosthetics easily with no discomfort, Lockwood found them almost impossible to use. He needed to raise his face and sight along his nose in order to see through tiny holes in the foil. He was able to use this to enhance his performance as the mutating Mitchell, the unusual gaze giving him an arrogant and haughty demeanor.|$|E

During his adventure, Moebius, a manipulative sorcerer, tricks Kain into orchestrating {{the destruction of the}} vampire race: Kain is left the last surviving vampire in Nosgoth. After restoring eight of the Pillars, Kain discovers that he would need to sacrifice his own life to restore the final corrupt one. Realizing that his death would ensure the annihilation of his species, he refuses to kill himself. This triggers the Pillars' collapse, and dooms the world to eternal decay, but enables Kain to live on and revive the vampire race.|$|E

In this research, financial position measured with debt to asset ratio (DAR), dan debt to equity ratio (DER).

Corporate governance measured with size of directors, size of commisioners, proportion of independent commisioners, size of independent audit committee, managerial ownership, and institusional ownership. <b>The</b> <b>health</b> <b>of</b> companies’ finance measured by current ratio (CR) value in companies.

25|$|In 2003, Congress {{passed the}} Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, {{which led to}} a lawsuit in the case of Gonzales v. Carhart. The Court had {{previously}} ruled in Stenberg v.

The membership of the Court changed after Stenberg, with John Roberts and Samuel Alito replacing William Rehnquist (a dissenter in Roe) and Sandra Day O'Connor (a supporter of Roe) respectively. Further, the ban at issue in Gonzales v. Carhart was a federal statute, rather than a state statute as in the Stenberg case.|$|E
25|$|Although no {{invertebrates}} {{have been}} identified as endangered or vulnerable, it is important to acknowledge that there are a plethora of invertebrates within the Cape Byron Marine Park which are critical <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> local ecosystems. These include a variety of molluscs such as the gold ring cowries (Cypraea annulus), Crustaceans such as the Zebra Shrimp (Ganthophylum americanum) and a specimen of the seven armed sea star (Luidia australiae). These Invertebrates have been noted as they are not usually found in areas and climates such as the Cape Byron Marine Park. The Zebra Shrimp and the seven armed sea star are rarely found in intertidal habitats and the gold ring cowries share a tropical affinity and demonstrate a rare occurrence in which the Cape Byron Marine Park is a habitat for both temperate and tropical species.|$|E

25|$|The rapid {{industrialization}} of Russia also {{resulted in}} urban overcrowding and poor conditions for urban industrial workers (as mentioned above). Between 1890 and 1910, {{the population of the}} capital, Saint Petersburg, swelled from 1,033,600 to 1,905,600, with Moscow experiencing similar growth. This created a new 'proletariat' which, due to being crowded together in the cities, was much more likely to protest and go on strike than the peasantry had been in previous times. In one 1904 survey, it was found that an average of sixteen people shared each apartment in Saint Petersburg, with six people per room. There was also no running water, and piles of human waste were a threat <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> workers. The poor conditions only aggravated the situation, with the number of strikes and incidents of public disorder rapidly increasing in the years shortly before World War I. Because of late industrialization, Russia's workers were highly concentrated. By 1914, 40% of Russian workers were employed in factories of 1,000+ workers (32% in 1901). 42% worked in 100–1,000 worker enterprises, 18% in 1–100 worker businesses (in the USA, 1914, the figures were 18, 47 and 35 respectively).|$|E
