5|$|Kate Farrar {{was interviewed}} by {{investigators}} on October 26. She stated that on the night she had woken up to find the fire already burning. Seeing smoke seeping into her room, she opened <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> <b>door</b> and called to her brother, then {{closed the door and}} placed the hang-up 9-1-1 call that alerted police. She then crawled out of her bedroom window to escape the fire.|$|E
5|$|Arson {{investigators}} testified as to {{how they}} had located the origin and cause of the house fire, stressing that the multiple unconnected, small fires they had found in the home's basement were evidence of the fire having been set purposely and that char patterns on the house's floors were evidence of a liquid accelerant having been used to start the fire. The living room floor had contained the most significant amount of accelerant, and the trail of accelerant had ended {{at the door of the}} master bedroom, which had been open while the fire burned. The state of <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> <b>door</b> contradicted Green's prior testimony to investigators that her bedroom door had been closed and she had only opened it briefly to look into the hallway.|$|E
5|$|The McCanns' {{children}} {{slept in}} a bedroom next to the front door, which the McCanns kept locked. The bedroom had one waist-high window with curtains and a metal exterior shutter, the latter controlled by a cord inside the window; the McCanns kept the curtains and shutter closed throughout the holiday. The window overlooked a narrow walkway and residents' car park, which was separated by a low wall from the street. Madeleine {{slept in a}} single bed next to <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> <b>door,</b> {{on the opposite side}} of the room from the window, while the twins were in travel cots in the middle of the room. There was another, empty, single bed underneath the window.|$|E
60|$|Dazed, I {{watched her}} open <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> <b>doors,</b> motion to Lindy to pass through, {{and then she}} had closed them again and I was alone in the darkened parlor.|$|R
60|$|The {{boys were}} still minus their collars and ties when they {{suddenly}} realized that something unusual was taking place downstairs. They had closed <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> <b>doors,</b> but now all of them rushed out into the hallway.|$|R
60|$|Bearing in {{mind this}} succinct {{description}} of the candidate, Stephen climbed the rickety stairs to the low second story. All <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> <b>doors</b> were flung open except one, on which the number 7 was inscribed. From within came bursts of uproarious laughter, and a summons to enter.|$|R
5|$|Two SEALs {{broke through}} <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> <b>door.</b> Bin Laden's wife Amal {{was on the}} edge of the bed {{shouting}} in Arabic at the SEALs, and Osama bin Laden dived across the bed, shoving Amal at the same time, for an AKS-74U kept by the headboard. The SEALs fired four shots at bin Laden; the first missed, the second grazed Amal in the calf also missing bin Laden, and the final two hit bin Laden in the chest and head, killing him instantly. In Pfarrer's account, the total time elapsed from jumping on the roof to Osama bin Laden's death was between 30 and 90 seconds.|$|E
5|$|While {{her mother}} attends the reunion, Emma visits Jordan at his hotel where she meets his teacher, Mr. Nystrom (Jeff Gruich). He takes {{her up to}} Jordan's hotel room but as they enter, Emma sees that it is {{completely}} empty except for a video camera which has been set up. She immediately becomes suspicious and tries to escape but Nystrom blocks her access to <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> <b>door.</b> She locks herself in the bathroom, and comes to the startling realization that Nystrom is Jordan. Nystrom apologizes and tells Emma he will let her go, but when she {{comes out of the}} bathroom he grabs and restrains her.|$|E
25|$|In this ending, {{available}} as alternate ending {{on the home}} releases of the film, Katie returns to the bedroom after the screaming and noise of her and Micah struggling downstairs. She is holding a knife and covered in blood. She closes and locks <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> <b>door.</b> Katie walks over and smiles at the camera, then slits her own throat. The screen then fades to black.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, sir, there's been a {{delivery}} of clean {{clothes from the}} wash to-night, and they're put outside <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> <b>doors</b> here. If you take notice as we go up, what a very few shirts there are, and what a many fronts, you'll penetrate the mystery of his packing.' ...|$|R
6000|$|It {{shall be}} Mr. George's duty to knock at all <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> <b>doors</b> [...] every morning, three {{quarters}} of {{an hour before the}} time fixed for [...] breakfast; and if he fails to do so, then he shall pay all the [...] fines for tardiness that may be incurred that morning by any of the [...] party.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear cousin, I hope I {{have not}} done wrong. Helena left me all by myself. When I had {{finished}} darning the curtain, I really didn't know what to do. So I opened all <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> <b>doors</b> upstairs {{and looked into the}} rooms. In the big room with two beds--oh, I am so ashamed--I found this book. Please look at the first page." ...|$|R
25|$|Since Marriott {{was found}} {{lying on the}} floor between the bed and wall, {{investigators}} concluded that he tried unsuccessfully to escape after being awakened by the blaze. Disoriented and confused after inhaling large amounts of thick smoke, Marriott had turned left instead of right towards <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> <b>door</b> and safety. He had been unable to rectify his mistake before being overcome with smoke. At the inquest, a verdict of accidental death by smoke inhalation was recorded. Marriott's blood was found to contain quantities of Valium (taken earlier for flight nerves), alcohol and cocaine.|$|E
25|$|Georges {{returns home}} with bundles of flowers in his hands, which he {{proceeds}} to wash and cut. He picks out a dress from Anne's wardrobe and writes a long letter. He tapes <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> <b>door</b> shut and catches a pigeon which has {{flown in from}} the window. In the letter, Georges explains that he has released the pigeon. Georges imagines that Anne is washing dishes in the kitchen and, speechless, he gazes {{at her as she}} cleans up and prepares to leave the house. Anne calls for Georges to bring a coat, and he complies, following her out the door.|$|E
25|$|As Romans was evacuated, one of {{the other}} SWAT {{officers}} then spotted Mixon beside <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> <b>door,</b> equipped with the SKS rifle, and fired at him. Mixon was forced to retreat inside the room and close the door. The team moved towards the bedroom and partially forced the door open. As he managed to get inside, Sakai was shot and mortally wounded by Mixon. Gonzales rushed into the room next and tripped on the floor, falling in front of Mixon. Mixon shot at Gonzales while he was falling and may have struck Gonzales in the head, although the bullet was deflected by Gonzales' tactical helmet, which protected him from injury. Spotting Mixon, Gonzales opened fire and was joined by Alameda County Sheriff's Deputy Derrick Pope; Mixon was felled by the barrage of gunfire and died from his wounds at 3:20p.m.|$|E

60|$|The {{front door}} was open, so we rushed in and hurried {{from room to room}} to the amazement of a doddering old manservant, who met us in the passage. There was no light save in the dining-room, but Holmes caught up the lamp and left no corner of the house unexplored. No sign could we see of the man whom we were chasing. On the upper floor, however, one of <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> <b>doors</b> was locked.|$|R
60|$|He peeped {{through the}} hinges of <b>the</b> half-open <b>bedroom</b> <b>door.</b> Then {{he turned and}} {{came out of the}} house in a hurry. His {{whiskers}} bristled and his coat-collar stood on end with rage.|$|R
25|$|After {{his arrival}} at Cheb, however, certain senior Scottish and Irish {{officers}} in his force assassinated {{him on the}} night of February 25. To carry out the assassination, a regiment of dragoons under the command of an Irish colonel, Walter Butler and the Scots colonels Walter Leslie and John Gordon first fell upon Wallenstein's trusted officers Adam Trczka, Vilém Kinsky, Christian Illov and Henry Neumann while the latter attended a feast at Cheb Castle (which had come under the command of Gordon himself), and massacred them. Trczka alone managed to fight his way out into the courtyard, only to be shot down by a group of musketeers. A few hours later, an Irish captain, Walter Devereux, together with a few companions, broke into the burgomaster's house at the main square where Wallenstein had his lodgings (again courtesy of Gordon), and kicked open <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> <b>door.</b> Devereux then ran his halberd through the unarmed Wallenstein, who, roused from sleep, is said to have asked in vain for quarter.|$|E
25|$|On November 5, 1995, Chrétien and {{his wife}} escaped injury when André Dallaire, armed with a knife, broke in the Prime Minister's {{official}} residence at 24 Sussex Drive. Aline Chrétien shut and locked <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> <b>door</b> until security came, while Chrétien held a stone Inuit carving in readiness. In November 1995, the long-running Airbus affair hit the headlines. On November 18, 1995, a leaked letter appeared in the Financial Post where the Justice Ministry headed by Allan Rock asked Swiss authorities to investigate certain bank accounts alleged to be held by the former Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and former Newfoundland Premier Frank Moores where the proceeds of an alleged kickback scheme relating to the purchase of Airbus jets by the Mulroney government in 1988 had been stored. Mulroney sued for libel on November 23, 1995, claiming that the PMO had the letter leaked in order to distract attention from the near-defeat in the Quebec referendum, and asked for $50 million in damages.|$|E
25|$|As {{the narrator}} reads of the knight's forcible {{entry into the}} dwelling, {{cracking}} and ripping sounds are heard somewhere in the house. When the dragon is described as shrieking as it dies, a shriek is heard, again within the house. As he relates the shield falling from off the wall, a reverberation, metallic and hollow, can be heard. Roderick becomes increasingly hysterical, and eventually exclaims that these sounds are being made by his sister, who was in fact alive when she was entombed. Additionally, Roderick somehow {{knew that she was}} alive. <b>The</b> <b>bedroom</b> <b>door</b> is then blown open to reveal Madeline standing there. She falls on her brother, and both land on the floor as corpses. The narrator then flees the house, and, as he does so, notices a flash of moonlight behind him which causes him to turn back, {{in time to see the}} moon shining through the suddenly widened crack. As he watches, the House of Usher splits in two and the fragments sink into the tarn.|$|E
50|$|Later, Pike, still {{unable to}} sleep, is woken up {{by the sound of}} heavy boots coming up the stairs. He warns the others, and they turn out the candles. The boots come towards <b>the</b> <b>bedroom.</b> <b>The</b> <b>door</b> opens slowly to reveal Captain Cadbury, who is {{surprised}} to find them in his bedroom.|$|R
60|$|He peeped {{through the}} hinges of <b>the</b> half-open <b>bedroom</b> <b>door.</b> Then {{he turned and}} {{came out of the}} house in a hurry. His {{whiskers}} bristled and his coat collar stood on end with rage.|$|R
50|$|An {{original}} wooden stair {{along the}} east leads to the upstairs. It has a similar plan, with a large master bedroom complemented by two smaller chambers. As with the first floor, much of the trim is original, with pine flooring and plaster walls throughout and chair rail in <b>the</b> master <b>bedroom.</b> <b>The</b> <b>bedroom</b> <b>doors</b> have original hardware; antique locks {{were added to the}} bathroom and closet doors. The original chimney, cut off at the roof line, is also visible on this floor. A small wood hatch leads to the attic, where the sawn rafters of the roof have skip sheathing and no ridge pole.|$|R
25|$|Two months later, it is {{revealed}} that Dennis and Gavin {{are still in}} contact. After another six weeks, Margaret visits Sharon, saying that Gavin is acting strangely, but Sharon dismisses this and sends Margaret away. Later, Gavin tells Kathy he has Dennis so she reluctantly gets {{in his car and}} is seen leaving by Buster Briggs (Karl Howman). Sharon sees that Dennis has been in contact with Gavin and Buster tells Sharon what he saw so, fearing for Kathy's safety, they get Gavin's address from Dennis. Kathy and Gavin arrive at a large country house that he bought with Sharon's money, and he locks them in, saying they can live there together. Kathy realises that Dennis is not there, and then Margaret arrives. Gavin locks Kathy in a room as Margaret and Gavin argue, and Margaret knocks Gavin unconscious and lets Kathy out of the room. Gavin regains consciousness and the women try to escape. As Sharon and Buster arrive, a woman falls onto the windscreen of the car and lies dead on the floor. Sharon realises it is Margaret, and she and Buster break into the house where Buster finds Kathy while Sharon confronts Gavin, who is packing a bag with cash. Sharon locks the door and Gavin insists that Margaret's death was an accident. Sharon asks him why he stayed in contact with Dennis when she paid him to stay away, so he says he would never harm his grandson. She tells him to give himself up to the police and if he does so, she will visit him in prison with Dennis and they can be a family when he gets released. Police and paramedics then arrive, as Sharon called them and Gavin accuses her of stalling until they arrived, but she insists she called them for Margaret's sake. Gavin says he will give himself up to the police so Sharon unlocks <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> <b>door,</b> but he then tries to escape. He sees his only way out is via the balcony but he is too scared of harming himself to jump. Sharon joins him on the balcony and he asks Sharon to tell the police that Margaret fell. A police officer then arrives on the balcony and Gavin grabs Sharon, threatening to jump, killing them both. Sharon says he could never kill himself so he lets her go and she tells him it is over between them. Gavin is then arrested.|$|E
500|$|Five {{days after}} the referendum, André Dallaire, a {{schizophrenic}} [...] "Yes" [...] supporter upset at the result, broke into Chrétien's Ottawa residence armed with a knife. [...] Dallaire attempted to find Chrétien and kill the prime minister in his bed before being discovered by Aline Chrétien, who barricaded <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> <b>door.</b> Chrétien was unharmed, and Dallaire would eventually be found not criminally responsible by reason of mental defect.|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} the day, Clair and Cliff {{settle into}} bed. As he becomes amorous, she reminds him that was how they got all those {{troublesome}} kids. This puts him off for a few seconds. Then Vanessa and Rudy knock on <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> <b>door</b> because Rudy was scared of [...] "the Wolf Man" [...] in their closet. Clair invites the kids to sleep with her and Cliff.|$|E
60|$|Just outside <b>the</b> back <b>bedroom</b> <b>door</b> was a damp place, as if {{that part}} of the floor had been newly washed; and when, goaded by curiosity, I peeped through the keyhole of the haunted chamber, my eye {{distinctly}} saw an open razor lying on a dusty table.|$|R
60|$|DANCY. [Under his breath] No! No! By God! No! He {{goes out}} into <b>the</b> <b>bedroom,</b> closing <b>the</b> <b>door</b> behind him.|$|R
60|$|The lads {{prepared}} a generous breakfast of pancakes and some sausage meat {{that had been}} brought along from Timminsport, washed down with a copious supply of hot coffee. As they ate they cast sundry glances at <b>the</b> closed <b>bedroom</b> <b>door,</b> but saw no sign of Glutts or Werner.|$|R
2500|$|Kirsten {{told police}} he went to Cornell’s room at 12:15a.m., but couldn't access the locked room. He then had a {{telephone}} conversation with Vicky Cornell. [...] "I told Vicky that they wouldn’t come {{open the door and}} she told me to kick it open. I did. Upon entry, I found <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> <b>door</b> locked. I called the hotel operator and told her that I needed security to open <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> <b>door.</b> They refused again, and I told them that I’m going to damage the hotel room and (they) need to send security, call 911 and call an ambulance. I kicked <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> <b>door</b> 6-7 times before it somehow popped open. I went inside and the bathroom door was partially opened and I could see his feet." [...] Kirsten told police in a signed statement. Kirsten said that Vicky {{was on the phone with}} him the whole time asking for updates, [...] "She told me that she called the front desk and they hung up on her. It was a female. She called back a couple minutes later and a male answered, saying that it was (the first) that he was hearing about the incident." [...] Kirsten said in his statement that he loosened the band around Cornell's neck then tried to resuscitate him by compressing his chest. Medical personnel arrived at 12:56 a.m and tried to resuscitate the singer with no success. Cornell was pronounced dead at 1:30a.m., an hour and 15 minutes after his bodyguard was first contacted by Cornell's wife. It's unknown how long it took the bodyguard to gain entry to the hotel room and find Cornell.|$|E
2500|$|Fangio {{was taken}} to three {{separate}} houses. His captors allowed him {{to listen to the}} race via radio, bringing a television for him to witness reports of a disastrous crash after the race concluded. In the third house, Fangio was allowed his own bedroom but became convinced that a guard was standing outside of <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> <b>door</b> at all hours. The captors talked about their revolutionary programme which Fangio had not wished to speak about as he did not have an interest in politics. Convinced that he was not in danger he went on to develop a case of Stockholm Syndrome, admitting afterwards that he sympathised with his captors' actions: [...] "Well, this is one more adventure. If what the rebels did was in a good cause, then I, as an Argentine, accept it." [...] Fangio was released after 29 hours and he remained a good friend of his captors afterwards.|$|E
2500|$|In retrospect, {{aside from}} being a {{collection}} of songs, there is a perception among some that the album tells a story; that its structure consists of a beginning, middle and end. One critic opined: [...] "There is a proper introduction, a rousing orchestral finale, and arguably a coherent narrative of love, sex, drugs and loss." [...] Anderson was highly influenced by the silver screen and admitted that during the recording of Suede's debut album, he watched Performance every night. Critics have noted the album's cinematic influence, with Simon Price writing that Anderson used {{the city as a}} [...] "cinematic backdrop to the tragic heroism of his own life." [...] Likewise, on the subject of Suede's familiar lyrical themes, the Radio Times wrote that [...] "He [...] would replace it with something deeper and timeless, drawing on old Hollywood and tragic, quotidian love stories." [...] Critics have likened the album to having an aura of claustrophobia. While SPIN, summarised the album as [...] "the work of a man cautiously opening <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> <b>door</b> and reeling from the discovery that other people have lives." [...] Other themes the album explores are solitude, paranoia and self-loathing. On the darker side the album depicts tragedy, failed relationships and doomed romances; however, within this dark setting, Anderson allowed positive statements of ambition and social mobility, reflected in [...] "The Power".|$|E
60|$|Antoinette kissed her, {{and began}} to adjust her veil mechanically. I looked on, bewildered by the {{workings}} of the feminine mind. Why was she going? The Vicomtesse gave me no hint. But suddenly the girl's arms fell to her sides, and she stood staring, {{not so much as a}} cry escaping her. <b>The</b> <b>bedroom</b> <b>doors</b> had been opened, and between them was the tall figure of Nicholas Temple. So they met again after many years, and she who had parted them had brought them together once more. He came a step into the room, as though her eyes had drawn him so far. Even then he did not speak her name.|$|R
6000|$|Adam for {{a moment}} thought uncomfortably about his father; but of late years he had never come home at dark hours from Treddleston, and there was every reason for believing that he was then {{sleeping}} off his drunkenness at the [...] "Waggon Overthrown." [...] Besides, to Adam, the conception of the future was so inseparable from the painful image of his father that the fear of any fatal accident to him was excluded by the deeply infixed fear of his continual degradation. The next thought that occurred to him was one that made him slip off his shoes and tread lightly upstairs, to listen at <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> <b>doors.</b> But both Seth and his mother were breathing regularly.|$|R
50|$|The {{upper level}} {{consists}} of two small bedrooms, a bathroom and a large roof terrace which overlooks the densely planted rear garden. The roof terrace is accessed from the landing {{at the top of}} the stairs through double timber doors. Built-in cupboards in <b>the</b> principal <b>bedroom</b> have been painted. A wardrobe designed by Karl Langer remains in <b>the</b> smaller <b>bedroom.</b> <b>Doors</b> which opened from <b>the</b> principal <b>bedroom</b> directly onto <b>the</b> terrace have been replaced with windows.|$|R
