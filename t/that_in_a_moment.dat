40|$|ABSTRACT: In true social hymenopterans, such as {{many species}} of bees, wasps and all species of ants, the main {{characteristics}} are the overlapping of generations, the care with the offspring and {{the division of labor}} among the members of the colony. The first biological feature means <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> same <b>moment</b> there are groups of individuals, with variable ages, that execute different activities in the colony. In order to study the division of labor among the members of the colony, or to estimate the life span of these insects, or even to analyze any kind of behavior in non-social insects, it is necessary to know the exact age of each individual. For this reason, the insects must be identified soon after emergence. The identification of insects with numbers is an important technological improvement in behavioral studies, mainly in honeybee colonies. The aim of this scientific note is to describe an easy and cheaper technique for marking hymenopterans...|$|R

50|$|From {{along the}} edge of the {{extensive}} wood which adjoined Compiègne, French skirmishers started to fire at the Prussian pickets.

40|$|Introduction: Narrative fiction, such as Suzanne Collins' "Hunger Games", can {{be about}} {{concepts}} and topics {{that could be}} useful in the academic study of surveillance, punishment, discipline, and power. Objective: We aim to draw a parallel between Jeremy Bentham's concept of Panopticon (developed by Foucault in "Discipline and Punish") and the book "Hunger Games. " We work with the hypothesis that Panem, the country described {{in the book is}} inspired by Panoptism, or the Panopticon device. Methodology: This is <b>a</b> review article <b>that,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> first <b>moment,</b> provides <b>a</b> description of how Foucault used the concept of Panopticon in "Discipline and Punish", and <b>in</b> <b>a</b> second <b>moment</b> explores the concept of Panopticon in relation to the book "Hunger Games" to corroborate our hypothesis. Results: We perceive that the forces of surveillance, power and discipline that govern the Panopticon are present in both Foucault's work and Suzanne Collins's work, showing that this fictional discourse presents common elements with Michel Foucault's work. Conclusion: As the works of fiction can present elements that are common to non-fiction works. The representation of narrative works of fiction is something that has potential importance for the study of certain concepts in the academia. This aspect needs to be considered and explored in relation to the description of fiction...|$|R

40|$|John McClure {{points to}} a strain of {{literature}} in which the religious and the secular mutually engage each other—the postsecular. His work suggests that the religious and the secular {{do not need to}} be <b>in</b> <b>a</b> hostile relationship to one another. This idea is available in Don DeLillo’s Underworld, E. L. Doctorow’s City of God, and Toni Morrison’s Paradise. Don DeLillo’s novel suggests that the secular can include the religious. E. L. Doctorow’s novel suggests that reading the religious involves failure. Toni Morrison’s novel suggests that we are at a place of taking stock about these issues. Reading these books through Buber’s notion of the prophetic, and also Girard’s understanding of the sacred, we understand that the postsecular <b>moment</b> involves <b>a</b> choice between the prophetic and the sacrificial.

40|$|Abstract In {{comparison}} to 3 d or 4 f metals, magnetism in actinides remains poorly understood due to experimental complications and the exotic {{behavior of the}} 5 f states. In particular, plutonium metal is most especially vexing. Over the last five decades theories proposed the presence of either ordered or disordered local moments at low temperatures. However, experiments such as magnetic susceptibility, electrical resistivity, nuclear magnetic resonance, specific heat, and elastic and inelastic neutron scattering show no evidence for ordered or disordered magnetic moments {{in any of the}} six phases of plutonium. Beyond plutonium, the magnetic structure of other actinides is an active area of research given that temperature, pressure, and chemistry can quickly alter the magnetic structure of the 5 f states. For instance, curium metal has an exceedingly large spin polarization <b>that</b> results <b>in</b> <b>a</b> total <b>moment</b> of ∼ 8 µB/atom, which influences the phase stability of the metal. Insight in the actinide ground state can be obtained from core-level x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS). A sum rule relates the branching ratio of the core-level spectra measured by XAS or EELS to the expectation value of the angular part of the spin-orbit interaction. ...|$|R
