40|$|It {{has long}} been {{recognised}} that the mechanism for funding irrigation infrastructure in Australia may be incompatible with efficient trade in the rural water market. If <b>the</b> <b>revenue</b> received by an irrigation operator {{is dependent on the}} volume of water entitlements held in the operator's region, out-of-region permanent water sales threaten <b>the</b> operator's <b>revenue</b> <b>stream,</b> potentially leading to higher charges on remaining irrigators, encouraging an inefficient 'rush for the exit'. In response, irrigation operators have imposed restrictions on permanent water trade, such as exit fees and termination fees, to protect their <b>revenue</b> <b>stream.</b> Previous economic analysis has suggested that exit fees, in particular, are a barrier to efficient trade in the water market and should be abolished. In contrast, this paper argues that allowing irrigators to cancel their water delivery rights without fees or charges leads to inefficient trade in the water market, hinders efficient on-farm investment in sunk complementary assets and leads to inefficient network rationalisation decisions. Instead, <b>the</b> <b>revenue</b> <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> irrigation operators should be insulated from water trade decisions, through high termination fees, tying irrigation charges to the land, or tagging the obligation to pay delivery charges to the new owner of the traded water.

30|$|Recently, some {{scholars}} have devoted a growing amount of attention to business model innovation (Teece, 2010; Najmaei, 2013). A business model articulates the logic and provides data and other evidence that demonstrates how a business creates and delivers value to customers (Teece, 2010). In short, a business model could {{be defined as the}} manner in which an enterprise creates and delivers value to customers, and then converts the payments that are received into profit (Björkdahl, 2009; Chesbrough, 2007; Zott and Amit 2010; Zott et al., 2011). No consensus exists yet regarding the definition, structure, and evolution of a business model. The manner in which firms create and capture value is a popular research topic. Each firm has its own business model, but no generally-accepted definition of the term ‘business model’ has yet emerged. Prior studies regarding business models fail to reach a consensus to define their components. The interest in business models is relatively recent, and Boudreau (2010) noted that early work to identify business models focused on capturing <b>the</b> <b>revenue</b> <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> web-based firms. No matter the sector, there are criteria that enable one {{to determine whether or not}} one has designed a good business model.

Whereas <b>the</b> <b>revenue</b> <b>streams</b> <b>of</b> cyber attackers have been studied multiple times in the literature, no quantitative account currently exists on the economics of attack acquisition and deployment. Yet, this understanding is critical to characterize the production of (traded) exploits, the economy that drives it, {{and its effects on}} the overall attack scenario. In this paper we provide an empirical investigation of the economics of vulnerability exploitation, and the effects of market factors on likelihood of exploit. Our data is collected first-handedly from a prominent Russian cybercrime market where the trading of the most active attack tools reported by the security industry happens. Our findings reveal that exploits in the underground are priced similarly or above vulnerabilities in legitimate bug-hunting programs, and that the refresh cycle of exploits is slower than currently often assumed. On the other hand, cybercriminals are becoming faster at introducing selected vulnerabilities, and the market is in clear expansion both in terms of players, traded exploits, and exploit pricing. We then evaluate the effects of these market variables on likelihood of attack realization, and find strong evidence of the correlation between market activity and exploit deployment. We discuss implications on vulnerability metrics, economics, and exploit measurement. Comment: 17 pages, 11 figures, 14 table...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{management}} project is to analyse the current and future scenario of <b>the</b> <b>revenue</b> <b>streams</b> <b>of</b> the Four Points hotel Mumbai in India. Revenue Management (RM) is an important tool for matching supply and demand by segmenting customers into different segments based on their willingness-to-pay and allocating scarce capacity to the different segments {{in a way that}} maximizes firm revenues. The benefits of RM are well accepted in the hospitality industry, and the technical aspects of RM form a rich analytical research stream. Forecasting for a hotel revenue management system is intrinsically difficult. Competitive actions, seasonal factors, the economic environment and regular fare changes are {{but a few of the}} challenges that must be overcome. This report examines the challenge of forecasting for Four Points hotel’s revenue management system being a fairly new hotel in Mumbai. With the Indian economy booming, India is increasingly becoming a centre for tourists and business destination. This report aims to study the trends in the hospitality industry and analyse the current situation of Four Points hotel Mumbai’s various revenue management models to enable the hotel to increase sales to enhance its business performance and create its own identity in the world of Hospitality. Mice tourism, pricing, and various concepts of revenue management are few others covered in this report. The literature shows that market segmentation, pricing, forecasting, capacity allocation, contribute to effective RM. In this report these elements have been grouped into two concepts: RM technical capability and RM social support capability and propose that these four elements positively impact RM performance. The number of rooms a hotel can sell and at what price is all determined by the booking limits set by the revenue management system. Standard rooms are the lowest category of rooms available which are always overbooked. The hotels continue to sell these rooms until the booking limit is reached after which the hotel does not show vacancy on those categories. Demand in that class of rooms may exceed the booking limit, but the data does not reflect and this is censored or “constrained” at the booking limit...|$|E

The predictive quality of such models is important, since it directly affects <b>the</b> <b>revenue</b> <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> local authorities. In this paper, we assess the relative predictive performance of different model specifications used in automated valuation. Specifically, we focus on the issue of spatial heterogeneity by comparing models that utilize different definitions of housing submarkets. In addition, we consider the inclusion of “spatial ” explanatory variables in the form of distance to various amenities as computed from a GIS. We apply this to data from the city of Bogotá, Colombia, a pioneer in the application of mass appraisal techniques in a developing country context. We find that specifications that include the submarkets improve predictive performance and that the inclusion of the spatial variables is superior to the traditional models of homogenous zones. However, even the best models are still characterized by relatively poor performance {{in the form of a}} high degree of overprediction of the house value. In addition, the predictive performance of the models varied by socio-economic stratum in the city, which suggests that the dynamics of the housing markets in these strata would require closer and separate attention. These results may provide further guidance to enhance mass appraisal practice in the city of Bogota ́ as well as potentially other Latin American cities...|$|R
40|$|Banking {{has always}} been an {{extremely}} competitive industry and competition has become tougher over the last years. Every bank has two sides to consider, customers and investors. Customers, however, are clearly {{the most important part of}} a bank as they provide the basic raw materials of deposits and the demand for loans, which are <b>the</b> <b>revenue</b> <b>streams</b> <b>of</b> net interest income but also provide the fee income. The bank offers an intermediation service between customers with excess funds and those with a funds deficit. It borrows and lends wholesale funds to keep the two piles in some kind of balance. The drivers of customer behaviour are complex. Understanding the needs of their customers and reacting to the changes of their behaviour, aid banks and financial institutions to face the hard competition. Clearly then, the success of a bank is subject to its ability to attract and retain its customers, and a large part of their business. This ability depends on what is called the image of a bank. In highly competitive sectors, like the banking sector, the image represents an asset which allows firms to differentiate and increase their success chances. However, although its impact on consumer behavior is of primary importance, a bank's image is a difficult asset to value and quantify. The concept of image has been given considerable attention in the literature over the past years. Image has been defined as the total impression that an entity makes on the minds of people and as the net result of the interaction of beliefs, ideas, feelings and previous experiences with an institution, which are stored in memory and transformed in concepts. Especially a bank's image can be seen as the perception that customers or potential customers have for a specific bank, based on the messages they received by the examined financial institution. Image is a strategic tool since it helps banks to achieve long-term objectives and it can be shown as a source of competitive advantage. The present paper builds on the previous work on the subject and focuses on the definition and measurement of a bank's image. It introduces image as a variable which expresses a bank's current state of development and future prospects. It identifies the factors affecting this variable, suggests ways of measuring them and uses image as the basis for the building of a non-linear model expressing a bank's development. The image of a bank, as defined in this paper, may prove a very useful tool for planning purposes, since it doesn’t only give an early diagnosis of possible changes, sometimes discontinuous, in the bank's pattern of progress, but also indicates the reasons for them. Hence, it may be used as the basis for designing appropriate measures to assist a bank's evolution. The theoretical findings are applied to a group of banks operating in Greece and the results are presented and discussed...|$|E
40|$|One {{area which}} has much {{potential}} for wider {{impact in the}} digital economy is the as-yet underresearched field of collaborative revenue capture in journalism. This term is proposed to describe methods to capture revenues on behalf of multiple stakeholders (potentially in competition with one another), and divide profits between them. There is evidence of this as an emerging revenue platform in media: Piano Media, a cross-publication model,where pooled premium content from different media outlets is set behind a paywall, initially launched in Slovenia and Slovakia. Or Blendle offering newspapers and magazines in the Netherlands on one website, reconfiguring a revenue model for journalism by making it incredibly easy to pay for separate articles. Another is Diversity, an online advertising network that pools many media sites together into one global advertising network of standard advertising formats andsizes, thus creating a potential global audience reach for advertisers. See for example Contributoria, a member-supported, crowdfunding, collaborative writing platform or the Banyan Project, a news cooperative owned by the community it covers for emerging examples of collaboration around revenues. By way of a test case study, this workshop explored {{the extent to which}} collaborative revenue capture can help to achieve a meaningful level of financial independence for media under threat. The long-term success of independent media in exile or restrictive environments, where the free flow of information is restricted and information producers are at risk, depends on financial sustainability, yet there is little scholarly research around revenue model development. These media function, for the most part, by grants from donor organisations which now run into millions of pounds justified by the fact that access to the diverse and credible journalism in countries such as Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Syria and Sri Lanka offers the opportunity to deliver much greater social and economic cohesion and political transparency. For media seeking to support the free flow of information in fragile environments, the issue of financial sustainability is complex. Both media in exile (out-of-country news outlets feeding independent information back in) and news outlets in restrictive news environments (in country providing counter information) exist in flawed market situations and often rely on grant funding. Researchers have stopped short of exploring <b>the</b> <b>revenue</b> <b>streams</b> <b>of</b> these media. Empirical data is scarce and a corresponding understanding of the funding structure of these media is lacking. One study of relevance - and from which this workshop draws its roots - fills that gap by mapping three main revenue categories of media in exile or in restrictive news environments: grant funding, earned income and donations. The major factors influencing revenue streams compared to online media startups in open markets are discussed. The author finds there is no one-size-fits-all solution and identifies the need for collaborative approaches to promote economic resilience for media under threat (Cook 2015). As such, exiled media as a vehicle for studying the potential for collaborative revenue capture could be an important indicator to the broader digital industries, which are also grappling with the possibilities for collaborative approaches. This represents an entirely new academic field approach. While the set of circumstances exiled media present are relatively unique, the approach to circumvent them - afforded by digital technologies - is highly transferable. The potential to place a stake in the greater understanding of such collaborative revenue methods showcases the UK as a leader in revenue model experimentation, an area watched with much interest globally...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{showed that}} the {{business}} model of an ESCO &# 150; under certain conditions &# 150; can operate profitable. This is especially because of {{the assumption that the}} local DSO is willing to pay for provided flexibility. Using this flexibility, grid reinforcements can be postponed. The business model of the ESCO can easily be applied on other regions with bottlenecks, shortages or similar problems. Operating in more than one region will generate economies of scale. In the following a short overview about the thesis will be given. Every chapter will be revised and discussed how it contributed to the results as well as possible obstacles and results will be worked out. Chapter 2 gave an overview about the electricity supply chain and what is important when implementing a new player on the market. Chapter 3 dealt with smart grids including DSM potential, smart homes and already existing new players on the energy market. Chapter 4, e-mobility, considered positive and negative aspects of EV and their integration into the grid; a special focus was on the battery. Chapter 5, micro-CHP, gave an overview about the wide and complicating flied of CHP technologies and their possibilities for DSM. A short calculation revealed that CO 2 reductions of micro-CHP systems are at least questionable. From an environmental point of few, CHP plants should generally run on biofuels. Subsequently, after the information about the supply chain and smart grids as well as the new technologies EV and CHP also an introduction into business models has been given in chapter 6. A wide range of definitions, models and frameworks is known from the literature. Especially the business model canvas was introduced {{due to the fact that}} it is the most widely used model and especially in entrepreneur circles very common. Therefore it was used to generate the business model of the ESCO and helped especially during the creativity process. Chapter 7 described the results of the modulation in the casestudy region Flor&# 248;. The influences of micro-CHP, energy savings, DSM and EV on the energy demand were presented and discussed. Challenges accrued from collecting data, building up the model and to replace missing data by smart and reasonable assumptions. Most assumptions refer to similar projects and models and were chosen conservatively. Increasing demand and fluctuating energy demand stress the grid. A need for DSM or a grid reinforcement was identified. A business model of an ESCO that fits the requirements of the test region was developed in chapter 8. The market situation, competitors, the unique selling proposition, the customer benefits and the finance plan were worked out. Chapter 9, the ESCO in practice, used the simulation results of chapter 7 and compard <b>the</b> <b>revenue</b> <b>streams</b> <b>of</b> EV, mico-CHP and DSM with the corresponding costs of ICT, charging station, smart meter, DSM and micro-CHP. The cost side was represented very detailed to identify synergies. The ESCO generated synergies when its customers installed more than one technology. This influenced the selling offer. Offers that just contained DSM were basically unprofitable. The more technology a customer installed the higher the savings for him or her and the higher the profits for the ESCO. The practicability of an ESCO in the German context was identified as critical due to missing DSO payments. More elaborate optimization models might use the variations of the German spot price in order to generate enough profit. </p...|$|E

Due to the debt incurred in building it, the BBC commented that maximising the number of other events staged at Wembley is vital to the FA's financial health, believing the benefit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> consistent <b>revenue</b> <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> 8 NFL games a year would not escape their attention.
