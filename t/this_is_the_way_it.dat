500|$|The {{measuring}} system for gauging a film's success {{is based on}} unadjusted grosses, mainly because historically <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> has always been done because of the practices of the film industry: the box office receipts are compiled by theaters and relayed to the distributor, which in turn releases them to the media. Converting to a more representative system that counts ticket sales rather than gross is also fraught with problems because the only data available for older films are the sale totals. As the motion picture industry is highly oriented towards marketing currently released films, unadjusted figures are always used in marketing campaigns so that new blockbuster films can much more easily achieve a high sales ranking, and thus be promoted as a [...] "top film of all time", so there is little incentive {{to switch to a}} more robust analysis from a marketing or even newsworthy point of view.|$|E
500|$|The Book of Lucifer {{contains}} a long chapter titled [...] "Satanic Sex", discussing Satanism's view on sexual activity {{as well as}} misconceptions surrounding these views. He denies the belief that sex {{is the most important}} element in LaVeyan Satanism, and that participation in orgies or other promiscuous behavior is forced. He explains that sexual freedom is encouraged, but only in the sense that believers should be free to explore their own sexualities as they please, without harming others. Along with the rumors regarding Satanic views on sex, LaVey also addresses those about animal and human sacrifice. He explains that the only time a LaVeyan Satanist would perform a human sacrifice would be to accomplish two goals: to [...] "release the magician's wrath" [...] as he or she performed a curse, and to kill someone who deserved to die. He considers the action of hurting another person a request to be destroyed, and explains that the Satanist is morally required to grant this request {{in the form of a}} curse. LaVey also says that a Satanist would never sacrifice a baby or an animal, as they are pure carnal beings and considered to be sacred. In The Book of Lucifer, LaVey outlines LaVeyan Satanism's views on death. He explains that one who has lived a full life will dread death, and that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> should be. He also does not agree with the idea of reincarnation. He encourages a strong will to live, comparing it to animals' instincts to fight viciously for their lives. Suicide is discouraged except in cases of euthanasia, where it would end extreme suffering. Because the Satanist is considered his or her own god, birthdays are celebrated as the most important holidays. Following one's birthday in importance are Walpurgisnacht and Halloween. Solstices and equinoxes are also celebrated.|$|E

An appeal heard in Germany on 13 December 2010 would, if Brähmer had been unsuccessful and sent to prison, have resulted in the belt being vacated and Cleverly being upgraded to the full champion status. Proceedings however didn't result in the champion being sent to prison and a fight with Brähmer was scheduled for 21 May 2011 Speaking of the match up Cleverly said that he was glad that it was going to happen saying [...] "He's the champion and the only way I would consider myself a true champion is if I took the belt from him, rather than picking up the vacant title." ...|$|E
2500|$|Further {{criticism}} has been aimed at Carmel's portrayal {{as a health}} visitor. In the late 1980s, a specialist nursing magazine called Nursing Times [...] had a feature on the character, remarking that she [...] "has come in for {{quite a bit of}} stick from HVA [...] members who haven't felt that the character gives a good impression of their role". HVA members expressed disappointment that the character [...] "has not developed in a way which promotes the role of health visitors more positively." [...] Roma Iskander, who had discussed the role with EastEnders scriptwriters on behalf of the HVA, said that [...] "Carmel isn't a positive image of a black woman or a health visitor." [...] The magazine article suggested that Carmel's personal problems with family and clients served her right [...] "for moving to Albert Square in the first place. Health visitors be warned — don't live on your work patch". However, in Dominic Strinati's book, Come on Down?: Popular Media Culture in Post-War Britain, Christine Geraghty has argued that [...] "the credibility of Carmel's character in the soap depended on her being part {{of the life of the}} Square, regularly and unproblematically available as a source of advice and support in her professional capacity as well as the focus of interest in terms of her personal life." [...] Geraghty has said that tension arose from conflict in the 1980s soaps [...] "between a desire to be positive about a particular issue and a commitment to credibility in terms of character and setting. The HVA, it would appear, want Carmel to be a model health visitor, demonstrating a wide range of skills in a professional manner. But the credibility of Carmel's character in the soap depends on her being a character who is part of the life of the Square, a professional who makes mistakes and whose personal life is almost a source of interest. Quite clearly, the demands for a positive image for health visitors as a profession are less pressing than the necessity to be able to deploy Carmel as a soap opera character. Those making the programme are quite certain that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> must be." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to his inaugural lecture, Lake published two important books on historical and exegetical matters concerning the New Testament during his time in Leiden: The Historical Evidence for the Resurrection of Jesus Christ (1907) and The Earlier Epistles of St. Paul: Their Motive and Origin (1911). [...] As Metzger explains: [...] "These studies, particularly the latter, revealed Lake's ability to analyze and evaluate complex historical and literary data and to set forth scholarly reconstructions with clarity and a certain persuasiveness." [...] In Historical Evidence Lake sets forth his approach: [...] "The first task of the historical inquirer is to collect the pieces of evidence; the second is to discuss the trustworthiness and meaning of each separate piece; {{and the third is}} to reconstruct the events to which the evidence relates" [...] (p.6). [...] As for the reconstruction, he explains: [...] "In any such attempt it is desirable to remember that the reconstruction of an original tradition from forms of later dates and of divergent contents must be guided by exactly the same principle as is the reconstruction of an original text from a number of extant MSS. [...] In each case the fundamental problem is the retracing of the line of development followed by the various authorities, and the solution depends chiefly on the ability to detect errors of transmission and to explain their existence" [...] (p.167). [...] As for The Earlier Epistles, Neill writes: [...] "I think {{that those of us who}} read Lake when we were young will be inclined to think that this is one of the best books on the New Testament that has ever been written in the English language. [...] <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> ought to be done. [...] Under Lake's skillful guidance, we feel ourselves one with those new and struggling groups of Christians, in all the perplexities of trying to discover what it means to be a Christian in a non-Christian world. [...] And there is the Apostle, so very much in working clothes and without a halo; we feel in our bones the passionate eagerness of Paul for better news from Corinth, the passionate relief when the good news arrives." [...] The book brought the conclusions of the German history of religions school to the attention of English-speaking world for the first time, and all later New Testament study has been influenced by this book.|$|E
