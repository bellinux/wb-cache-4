40|$|BACKGROUND: Recent {{studies found}} that <b>the</b> <b>athlete's</b> age of <b>the</b> best ultra-marathon {{performance}} was higher than <b>the</b> <b>athlete's</b> age of <b>the</b> best marathon performance {{and it seemed that}} <b>the</b> <b>athlete's</b> age of peak ultra-marathon performance increased in distance-limited races with rising distance. METHODS: We investigated <b>the</b> <b>athlete's</b> age of peak ultra-marathon performance in the fastest finishers in time-limited ultra-marathons from 6 hrs to 10 d. Running performance and <b>athlete's</b> age of <b>the</b> fastest women and men competing in 6 hrs, 12 hrs, 24 hrs, 48 hrs, 72 hrs, 144 hrs (6 d) and 240 hrs (10 d) were analysed for races held between 1975 and 2012 using analysis of variance and multi-level regression analysis. RESULTS: <b>The</b> <b>athlete's</b> ages of <b>the</b> ten fastest women ever in 6 hrs, 12 hrs, 24 hrs, 48 hrs, 72 hrs, 6 d and 10 d were 41 [*]±[*] 9, 41 [*]±[*] 6, 42 [*]±[*] 5, 46 [*]±[*] 5, 44 [*]±[*] 6, 42 [*]±[*] 4, and 37 [*]±[*] 4 yrs, respectively. <b>The</b> <b>athlete's</b> age of <b>the</b> ten fastest women was different between 48 hrs and 10 d. For men, <b>the</b> <b>athlete's</b> ages were 35 [*]±[*] 6, 37 [*]±[*] 9, 39 [*]±[*] 8, 44 [*]±[*] 7, 48 [*]±[*] 3, 48 [*]±[*] 8 and 48 [*]±[*] 6 yrs, respectively. <b>The</b> <b>athlete's</b> age of <b>the</b> ten fastest men in 6 hrs and 12 hrs was lower than <b>the</b> <b>athlete's</b> age of <b>the</b> ten fastest men in 72 hrs, 6 d and 10 d, respectively. CONCLUSION: <b>The</b> <b>athlete's</b> age of peak ultra-marathon performance did not increase with rising race duration in the best ultra-marathoners. For the fastest women ever in time-limited races, <b>the</b> <b>athlete's</b> age was lowest in 10 d (~ 37 yrs) and highest in 48 hrs (~ 46 yrs). For men, <b>the</b> <b>athlete's</b> age of <b>the</b> fastest ever in 6 hrs (~ 35 yrs) and 12 hrs (~ 37 yrs) was lower than <b>the</b> <b>athlete's</b> age of <b>the</b> ten fastest in 72 hrs (~ 48 yrs), 6 d (~ 48 yrs) and 10 d (~ 48 yrs). The differences in <b>the</b> <b>athlete's</b> age of peak performance between female and male ultra-marathoners for the different race durations need further investigations...|$|R

5|$|Once <b>the</b> <b>athlete</b> {{has taken}} flight, {{characteristics}} {{similar to that}} of a glider come into force. Ski flyers are able to cover such tremendous distances and land safely primarily due to the skis they use, which are substantially wider and longer than their cross-country or Alpine skiing counterparts. Each ski is first attached securely {{at the front of the}} boot, which has an exaggerated forward slant; the heel is then attached to a wedge on the ski using a hinged binding peg or strap with a maximum length of , allowing <b>the</b> <b>athlete</b> to lean forward into their preferred aerodynamic position and spread the skis wide apart. Much like aircraft wings, the skis are flexible to an extent, resulting in them bending and vibrating significantly upon takeoff. Maintaining stability in the air is paramount: a loss of balance, or a differential pressure under the skis, can lead to disaster (see list of ski flying accidents). A few athletes have a natural tendency to drift over to one side of the hill, invariably shortening their jump distance.|$|E

5|$|Skilful use of {{headwind}} {{and thermal}} updrafts along various {{sections of the}} hill is used to generate additional lift, creating pressure under the oversized skis and enabling athletes to effectively ride on a 'cushion of air'. A reasonable amount of headwind is favourable to a long jump as it {{has the effect of}} keeping <b>the</b> <b>athlete</b> aloft and delaying their descent back onto the hill, whereas a tailwind or no wind at all is highly unfavourable and tends to shorten a jump by pushing <b>the</b> <b>athlete</b> downwards towards the hill too early. In particular, the presence of a tailwind forms one of the most challenging aspects of clearing the knoll and achieving a competitive distance. A crosswind is just as challenging, as it can create dangerous instability in the air. Conversely, in ideal headwind conditions, an athlete can 'catch' an updraft along various points of the hill – which always involves some degree of luck – and use it to glide even further, making for an impressive visual effect for audiences.|$|E
