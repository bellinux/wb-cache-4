5|$|Dickinson remembers {{relationships}} with fellow celebrities including Sylvester Stallone, Liam Neeson, Warren Beatty, Mick Jagger, and Jack Nicholson. She enjoys her celebrity status and her time with friends John Belushi, Truman Capote, and Andy Warhol. Belushi and Dickinson enable each other's predilections for abusing drugs. She regularly spends time at Studio 54 during this period. Dickinson recounts a {{darker side of}} celebrity, and writes that she trusted in Bill Cosby when he informed her he could help her career in show business, only to experience verbal anger from him when {{she said she was}} <b>too</b> <b>tired</b> <b>to</b> engage in sexual activity with him.|$|E
5|$|On August 30, 1987, Parsons was hitchhiking along Interstate 15 near Barstow, California. He {{was picked}} up by 30-year-old Richard Lynn Ernest, a {{concrete}} laborer from Loma Linda, California {{on his way to a}} construction job in Denver, Colorado. Ernest did not know that Parsons was a fugitive. At about 3 a.m. on August 31, Ernest was <b>too</b> <b>tired</b> <b>to</b> drive and stopped at the Lunt Park rest area near Cedar City, Utah to get some sleep. Parsons stabbed Ernest to death and drove off in his blue Dodge Omni.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the march, Julian gave {{a speech}} to the {{assembled}} army. Its wording could be read as implying that Julian had already had a fortified marching-camp built (in accordance with standard Roman military practice), or that he was simply proposing to do so. In any case, it appears that Julian, concerned that his men might be <b>too</b> <b>tired</b> <b>to</b> fight after a 6-hour march in the hot sun, urged that the clash be postponed until the following day. But his officers and men {{would have none of it}} and clamoured to be led against the enemy immediately. Julian, who prided himself on acting by consensus, gave way. However, since Ammianus states that the battle and subsequent pursuit ended after sunset, it seems unlikely that the army would have actually engaged at midday straight after the march without a few hours rest and refreshment (and, if a camp was built, a couple of hours spent on that task). It thus seems more likely that battle commenced in the late afternoon.|$|E

60|$|At length when it {{was past}} the hour of noon, Martin sat down under a small bush that gave just shade enough to cover him and none to spare. It was only a little spot of shade like an island {{in a sea of}} heat and brightness. He was <b>too</b> hot and <b>tired</b> <b>to</b> run more, <b>too</b> <b>tired</b> even <b>to</b> keep his eyes open, and so, {{propping}} his back against the stem of the small bush, he closed his tired hot eyes.|$|R
5|$|Battle {{losses of}} horses were {{approximately}} 25percent of all war-related equine deaths between 1914 and 1916. Disease and exhaustion {{accounted for the}} remainder and the Germans specifically targeted horses with gunfire. The highest death rates were in East Africa, where in 1916 alone deaths of the original mounts and remounts accounted for 290% of the initial stock numbers, mainly due to infection from the tsetse fly. On average, Britain lost about 15 percent (of the initial military stock) of its animals each year of the war (killed, missing, died or abandoned), with losses at 17 percent in the French theatre. This compared to 80 percent in the Crimean War, 120 percent in the Boer War and 10 percent in peacetime. During some periods of the war, 1,000horses per day were arriving in Europe as remounts for British troops, to replace horses lost. Some horses, having collapsed from exhaustion, drowned in ankle-deep mud, <b>too</b> <b>tired</b> <b>to</b> lift their heads high enough to breathe. Equine casualties were especially high during battles of attrition, such as the 1916 Battle of Verdun between French and German forces. In one day in March, 7,000 horses were killed by long-range shelling on both sides, including 97 killed by a single shot from a French naval gun. By 1917, Britain had over a million horses and mules in service, but harsh conditions, especially during winter, resulted in heavy losses, particularly amongst the Clydesdale horses, the main breed used to haul the guns. Over {{the course of the}} war, Britain lost over 484,000horses, one horse for every two men. A small number of these, 210, were killed by poison gas.|$|E
25|$|A Factories Inquiry Commission of 1833 {{found that}} {{children}} working in the mills were often <b>too</b> <b>tired</b> <b>to</b> eat and, when woken in the morning, unable to dress themselves. Scotland was considered the worst area for child cruelty and their tiredness often caused serious accidents with the machinery.|$|E
25|$|During the Yugoslav socialist period, Jews {{were allowed}} to leave to Israel. However, if they decided to go, all their {{properties}} and any kind of their possession was automatically owned by the Communist party with no possibility of return. After the dissolution of Yugoslavia, some properties were returned to Jews. Many Jews who had immigrated from Slovenia to Israel said they are now too old and <b>too</b> <b>tired</b> <b>to</b> start the all process of return.|$|E

The Protestant cavalry fled without putting up much of a fight, leaving the {{infantry}} to its fate. In march column, unable to deploy in a defensive formation, the infantry was cut to pieces. Gauchier also captured the artillery and the army baggage. The Protestant army had been all but destroyed.|$|E
25|$|The European Union {{promotes}} various initiatives regarding {{work-life balance}} and encourages its {{member states to}} implement family-friendly policies. In Europe, the Working Time Directive has implemented a maximum 48-hour working week. Many countries have opted for fewer hours. France introduced a 35-hour workweek. Contradictory to the Scandinavian countries, {{there is no evidence}} of state policies that absolutely encourage men to take on a larger share of domestic work in France, Portugal, or Britain. In a 2007, the European Quality of Life Survey found that countries in south-eastern Europe had the most common problems with work–life balance. In Croatia and Greece, a little over 70% of working citizens say that they are <b>too</b> <b>tired</b> <b>to</b> do household jobs at least several times a month because of work.|$|E
25|$|The crew {{launched}} straight away. After their 11-hour journey across Exmoor, {{they now}} had to row for an hour into the storm to reach the Forrest Hall which was anchored close to Hurlstone Point. The lifeboat stood by – the crew rowing continuously to hold a safe position – until daylight when two tugs arrived and {{managed to get a}} new rope across. Some of the lifeboatmen went on board to help raise the anchors as the crew were <b>too</b> <b>tired</b> <b>to</b> do it themselves. The tugs took it across the channel to Barry, accompanied by the Louisa and the Lynmouth lifeboat volunteers in case there were further problems. They finally arrived in port at about 05:00 on 14 January. The lifeboat crew were towed back to Lynmouth by a steam ship.|$|E

25|$|At the Rethel {{meeting on}} 17 August Lanrezac also thought that Sir John French, whose BEF only {{consisted}} of four infantry divisions {{rather than the}} planned six, intended to use the British cavalry on foot (it is thought likely that he had misunderstood Sir John’s intention to keep his cavalry in reserve). Whereas Sir John wanted Sordet's French cavalry to cover the assembly of the BEF, Lanrezac wanted them to gather tactical intelligence and was told by Joffre’s {{deputy chief of staff}} Berthelot on 17 August that this took priority. Nonetheless Joffre ordered Sordet to move up to Namur and Louvain to try to prevent the Belgians falling back on Antwerp. GQG were unfairly angered at Sordet’s “dilatoriness”, even though his horses were <b>too</b> <b>tired</b> <b>to</b> do more than walk. Lanrezac demanded to Joffre on morning of 18th that he have use of Sordet’s corps.|$|E
500|$|By 5:00 pm, {{neither side}} could make any gains; the Prussians held tenaciously to the {{captured}} artillery works, <b>too</b> <b>tired</b> <b>to</b> even retreat: they had pushed the Russians from the Mühlberge, the village, and the Kuhgrund, but no further. The Allies {{were in a}} similar state, except they had more cavalry in reserve and some fresh Austrian infantry. This part of Laudon's forces, late arrivals to the scene and largely unused, came into action at about 7:00 pm. [...] To the exhausted Prussians holding the Kuhgrund, the swarm of fresh Austrian reserves was the final stroke. [...] Although such isolated groups as Hans Sigismund von Lestwitz's regiment put up a bold front, these groups lost heavily and their stubborn defense could not stop {{the chaos of the}} Prussian retreat. [...] Soldiers threw their weapons and gear aside and ran for their lives.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Spice Up Your Life" [...] was {{directed}} on 6 September 1997, by Marcus Nispel in a two-day shoot located in New York City. The video features {{the group in}} a futuristic setting, inspired by the 1982 film Blade Runner, and the music video for Janet Jackson's 1989 single Rhythm Nation controlling every aspect of society in a dark futuristic post apocalyptic cityscape. Nispel {{came up with the}} concept based on a sketch that was faxed to him signed [...] "Ginger Spice". He recalls: [...] "I looked at what Disney did to Times Square in NYC and tried to imagine how the Spice Girls would transform it, as their career seemed to have no limits—at the time." [...] The group was not consulted about the concept. According to Brown's autobiography, they wanted a carnival party theme, but were <b>too</b> <b>tired</b> <b>to</b> fight about it with the label, and ended up with a concept linked to the theme of world domination. Brown commented: [...] "It wasn't right. I don't think any of us liked it much, even though we enjoyed making it. I still can't understand what's going on in it half the time." [...] The video exclusively premiered on MTV in September 1997.|$|E

500|$|A {{few years}} later, when World War I broke out, Tatiana became a Red Cross nurse {{with her mother}} and Olga. They cared for wounded {{soldiers}} in a private hospital on the grounds of Tsarskoye Selo. According to Vyrubova, [...] "Tatiana was almost as skillful and devoted as her mother, and complained only that on account of her youth she was spared some of the more trying cases." [...] Valentina Ivanovna Chebotareva, who worked with her at the hospital, described in her journal how she planned to boil silk while Tatiana was otherwise occupied, fearing that Tatiana would be <b>too</b> <b>tired</b> <b>to</b> help her. But Tatiana guessed what Chebotareva was doing. [...] "Why can you breathe carbolic acid and I can't?" [...] she asked Chebotareva and insisted on helping her with the work. In September 1914, she was named patron of a war aid committee known simply as the Tatiana Committee. Tatiana was strongly patriotic and apologized in a 29 October 1914 letter for saying something negative about the Germans in her mother's presence. She explained that she forgot her mother had been born in Germany because she thought of Alexandra as only Russian. The Tsarina responded that she did feel completely Russian and Tatiana had not hurt her feelings with her sharp words, but Alexandra was hurt by the actions of her former countrymen and by the gossip she heard about her own German connections.|$|E

60|$|Yet she {{was beyond}} the reach of even the conjectures of passion. She had come to a certain {{exterior}} resignation to her fate.

2500|$|Also of note is {{the violin}} heard on [...] "Creep in the Cellar."

2500|$|Sperm whaling {{involved}} the above-named ships searching for sperm whales on certain [...] "grounds," [...] or areas where sperm whales {{were likely to}} be found, such as the [...] "Western" [...] Ground in the mid-North Atlantic or the [...] "Offshore" [...] Ground in the latitudes of 5–10 degrees south and 105–125 degrees west longitude. The whales were spotted from one of the several look-outs stationed at the mast-heads. When a whale was found, whaleboats would be lowered and a harpoon attached to a long line would be thrown into it. [...] The whale would then drag the boats until it was <b>too</b> <b>tired</b> <b>to</b> resist, at which point the crew would lance it to death.|$|E

Macleod was often <b>too</b> <b>tired</b> <b>to</b> work in the mornings after gambling {{for much of the}} night, although he tended to perk up as the day went on; he was popular with colleagues and on at least one occasion mucked in to work overtime for a last-minute order for Chinese banknotes.
