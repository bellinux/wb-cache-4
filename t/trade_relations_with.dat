5|$|A {{commercial}} document from 30 January 1359, which testifies to John's continuing <b>trade</b> <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> Venice, is chronologically the last {{reference to his}} activity in contemporary sources.

5|$|Beginning in {{the early}} 16th century, trade {{networks}} connecting Nablus to Damascus and Cairo were supplemented by the establishment of trading posts in the Hejaz and Gulf regions {{to the south and}} east, {{as well as in the}} Anatolian Peninsula and the Mediterranean islands of Crete and Cyprus. Nablus also developed <b>trade</b> <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> Aleppo, Mosul, and Baghdad.|$|E

In addition, a relief from the causeway of Unas leading to his pyramid shows a giraffe, suggesting <b>trade</b> <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> Nubia.|$|E
5|$|After the War of the Oranges, Portugal {{adopted a}} double policy. On {{the one hand}} John, Prince of Brazil, as regent of Portugal, signed the Treaty of Badajoz with France and Spain by which he assumed the duty to close the ports to British trade. On the other hand, not wanting to breach the Treaty of Windsor (1386) with Portugal's oldest ally, Britain, he allowed for such trade to {{continue}} and maintained secret diplomatic relations with them. However, after the Franco-Spanish defeat in the Battle of Trafalgar, John grew bold and officially resumed diplomatic and <b>trade</b> <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> Britain.|$|E
5|$|Amenemhat IV {{may have}} been the son, {{grandson}} or step-son of his predecessor, the powerful Amenemhat III. His reign started with a two-year coregency with Amenemhat III and was seemingly peaceful. He undertook expeditions in the Sinai for turquoise, in Upper Egypt for amethyst and to the Land of Punt. He also maintained <b>trade</b> <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> Byblos as well as the Egyptian presence in Nubia. Amenemhat IV built some parts of the temple of Hathor at Serabit el-Khadim in the Sinai and constructed the well-preserved temple of Renenutet in Medinet Madi.|$|E

A gold cylinder seal bearing the serekh of Djedkare Isesi together with the cartouche of Menkauhor Kaiu is now on display at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. The seal, whose gold may originate from the Pactolus river valley in western Anatolia, could attest to wide-ranging trade-contacts during the later Fifth Dynasty, but its provenance remains unverifiable.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{formulated}} the Jay Treaty {{to normalize}} <b>trade</b> <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> Great Britain, remove them from western forts, and resolve financial debts remaining from the Revolution; John Jay negotiated and signed the treaty on November 19, 1794. Jeffersonians supported France and strongly attacked the treaty. Washington listened to both sides, then announced his strong support, which mobilized {{public opinion and}} was pivotal in securing ratification in the Senate on June 24, 1795 by the requisite two-thirds majority.|$|E
5|$|In 1853 Commodore Matthew Perry led the Perry Expedition, a {{squadron}} of four ships which sailed to Japan to establish normal relations with Japan. Perry's two technologically advanced steam-powered ships and calm, firm diplomacy convinced Japan to end three centuries of isolation and sign Treaty of Kanagawa with the U.S. in 1854. Nominally a treaty of friendship, the agreement soon {{paved the way for}} the opening of Japan and normal <b>trade</b> <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> the United States and Europe.|$|E

5|$|Spain {{was by far}} {{the most}} {{threatening}} power for Japan at that time (with a colony and an army in the nearby Philippines). Hasekura's eyewitness accounts of Spanish power and colonial methods in Nueva España (Mexico) may have precipitated the Shogun Tokugawa Hidetada's decision to sever <b>trade</b> <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> Spain in 1623, and diplomatic relations in 1624, although other events such as the smuggling of Spanish priests into Japan and a failed Spanish embassy also contributed to the decision.|$|E
5|$|The polity of Tondo flourished {{during the}} latter half of the Ming dynasty as a result of direct <b>trade</b> <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> China. The Tondo {{district}} was the traditional capital of the empire, and its rulers were sovereign kings, not mere chieftains. They were addressed variously as panginuan in Maranao or panginoón in Tagalog ("lords"); anák banwa ("son of heaven"); or lakandula ("lord of the palace"). The Emperor of China considered the Lakans—the rulers of ancient Manila—"王", or kings.|$|E
5|$|The {{settlements}} at Tilsit gave Napoleon time {{to organize}} his empire. One {{of his major}} objectives became enforcing the Continental System against the British. He decided to focus his attention on the Kingdom of Portugal, which consistently violated his trade prohibitions. After defeat in the War of the Oranges in 1801, Portugal adopted a double-sided policy. At first, John VI agreed to close his ports to British trade. The situation changed dramatically after the Franco-Spanish defeat at Trafalgar; John grew bolder and officially resumed diplomatic and <b>trade</b> <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> Britain.|$|E

5|$|There {{is little}} {{evidence}} for military action during Nyuserre's reign; the Egyptian state continued to maintain <b>trade</b> <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> Byblos on the Levantine coast and to send mining and quarrying expeditions to Sinai and Lower Nubia.

5|$|As of 2010, Chewa was {{the largest}} {{community}} in the region with 39.7 per cent population and Chewa was the widely spoken language in Eastern province with 34.6 per cent speaking it. The province was claimed {{as a part of}} Malawi in 1968 by the then Malawian President Dr. Hastings Kamazu Banda who was a supporter of the apartheid in South Africa against the wishes of Organization of African Unity (OAU). The then Zambian president Kenneth Kaunda openly asked Malawi to go on war with Zambia to claim the province and also affirmed that Zambia would not have <b>trade</b> <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> Malawi until the claim on territory was withdrawn. The expansionist ambition of Malawi was discontinued and the Eastern Province remained with Zambia.|$|E
5|$|In the east, Selvo {{not only}} {{maintained}} good <b>trade</b> <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> the Byzantine Empire, but also married into their royal family {{to consolidate the}} alliance that had existed for many years between the two nations. In 1075, Selvo married Teodora Ducas, daughter of Constantine X and sister of the reigning emperor, Michael VII. Though Venetians, especially the nobles, were wary of the pageantry that accompanied the marriage and the royal bride, the strengthened alliance meant even greater mobility for Venetian merchants in the east. Though {{the popularity of the}} new dogaressa was not great, Selvo was the hero of the merchant class that had had even greater political sway since the depositions of the Orseoli.|$|E
50|$|The Greeks had {{to fight}} off Scythian and Sarmatian (Alan) raiders who {{prevented}} them from progressing inland but retained the shores which became the wheat basket of the ancient Greek world.

5|$|The Keppel {{passageway}} {{was used}} by Asian and early European sailors and traders {{for hundreds of years}} to sail past Singapore. Between 1405 and 1433, Zheng He made seven voyages to more than 30 countries, travelling in fleets of up to 300 ships to the South Pacific, Indian Ocean, Persian Gulf and Africa. The admiral travelled on the order of the Chinese Emperor to establish <b>trade</b> <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> countries west of China. He is believed to have sailed through the waters off Labrador Park, though whether he landed in Singapore is uncertain. In the 17th century, the passageway was abandoned in favour of the wider and more open Main Straits, that lies south of Pulau Satamu, where Raffles Lighthouse stands today.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{diplomatic}} venture of Zhang Qian into Central Asia {{during the reign}} of Emperor Wu of Han (r.141–87BC), the Han Empire of China sent a delegation to Mithridates II's court in 121BC. The Han embassy opened official <b>trade</b> <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> Parthia via the Silk Road yet did not achieve a desired military alliance against the confederation of the Xiongnu. The Parthian Empire was enriched by taxing the Eurasian caravan trade in silk, the most highly priced luxury good imported by the Romans. Pearls were also a highly valued import from China, while the Chinese purchased Parthian spices, perfumes, and fruits. Exotic animals were also given as gifts from the Arsacid to Han courts; in 87 AD Pacorus II of Parthia sent lions and Persian gazelles to Emperor Zhang of Han (r.75–88AD). Besides silk, Parthian goods purchased by Roman merchants included iron from India, spices, and fine leather. Caravans traveling through the Parthian Empire brought West Asian and sometimes Roman luxury glasswares to China. The merchants of Sogdia, speaking an Eastern Iranian language, served as the primary middlemen of this vital silk trade between Parthia and Han China.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{became the}} leading cabinet {{member in the}} new {{government}} under President Washington. He was a nationalist who emphasized strong central government and successfully argued that the implied powers of the Constitution provided the legal authority to fund the national debt, assume states' debts, and create the government-backed Bank of the United States. These programs were funded primarily by a tariff on imports, and later also by a highly controversial tax on whiskey. To overcome localism, Hamilton mobilized a nationwide network of friends of the government, especially bankers and businessmen, which became the Federalist Party. A major issue {{in the emergence of}} the American two-party system was the Jay Treaty, largely designed by Hamilton in 1794. It established friendly <b>trade</b> <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> Britain, to the chagrin of France and the supporters of the French Revolution. Hamilton {{played a central role in}} the Federalist party, which dominated national and state politics until it lost the election of 1800 to Jefferson's Democratic-Republican Party.|$|E
