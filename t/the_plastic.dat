5|$|Welding {{thermoplastic}} is {{very similar}} to welding glass. <b>The</b> <b>plastic</b> first must be cleaned and then heated through the glass transition, turning the weld-interface into a thick, viscous liquid. Two heated interfaces can then be pressed together, allowing the molecules to mix through intermolecular diffusion, joining them as one. Then <b>the</b> <b>plastic</b> is cooled through the glass transition, allowing the weld to solidify. A filler rod may often be used for certain types of joints. The main differences between welding glass and plastic are the types of heating methods, the much lower melting temperatures, and the fact that plastics will burn if overheated. Many different methods have been devised for heating plastic to a weldable temperature without burning it. Ovens or electric heating tools can be used to melt <b>the</b> <b>plastic.</b> Ultrasonic, laser, or friction heating are other methods. Resistive metals may be implanted in <b>the</b> <b>plastic,</b> which respond to induction heating. Some plastics will begin to burn at temperatures lower than their glass transition, so welding can be performed by blowing a heated, inert gas onto <b>the</b> <b>plastic,</b> melting it while, at the same time, shielding it from oxygen.|$|E
5|$|Haylage, {{also known}} as Round bale silage is a term for grass sealed in {{airtight}} plastic bags, a form of forage that is frequently fed in the United Kingdom and continental Europe, but is not often seen in the United States. Because haylage {{is a type of}} silage, hay stored in this fashion must remain completely sealed in plastic, as any holes or tears can stop the preservation properties of fermentation and lead to mold or spoilage. Rodents chewing through <b>the</b> <b>plastic</b> can also spoil the hay introducing contamination to the bale. If a rodent dies inside <b>the</b> <b>plastic,</b> the subsequent botulism toxins released can contaminate the entire bale.|$|E

5|$|Many {{thermoplastics}} {{can also}} be welded using chemical solvents. When placed in contact with <b>the</b> <b>plastic,</b> the solvent will begin to soften it, bringing the surface into a thick, liquid solution. When two melted surfaces are pressed together, the molecules in the solution mix, joining them as one. Because the solvent can permeate <b>the</b> <b>plastic,</b> the solvent evaporates out through the surface of <b>the</b> <b>plastic,</b> causing the weld {{to drop out of}} solution and solidify. A common use for solvent welding is for joining PVC or ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) pipes during plumbing, or for welding styrene and polystyrene plastics in the construction of models. Solvent welding is especially effective on plastics like PVC which burn at or below their glass transition, but may be ineffective on plastics like Teflon or polyethylene that are resistant to chemical decomposition.|$|E

5|$|As {{with many}} other {{composite}} materials (such as reinforced concrete), the two materials act together, each overcoming the deficits of the other. Whereas <b>the</b> <b>plastic</b> resins are strong in compressive loading and relatively weak in tensile strength, the glass fibers are very strong in tension but tend not to resist compression. By combining the two materials, GRP becomes a material that resists both compressive and tensile forces well. The two materials may be used uniformly or the glass may be specifically placed in those portions of the structure that will experience tensile loads.|$|E
