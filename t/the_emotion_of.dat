The participants were 469 university students. The results of factor analysis reveal six factors. Cognitive empathy consists of two factors: "sensitivity to <b>the</b> <b>emotions</b> <b>of</b> others (sens) " and "perspective-taking (pt) ". Emotional empathy consists of four factors: "sharing <b>the</b> positive <b>emotions</b> <b>of</b> others (sp) ", "sharing <b>the</b> negative <b>emotions</b> <b>of</b> others (sn) ", "good feelings toward <b>the</b> positive <b>emotions</b> <b>of</b> others (gf) " and "sympathy for <b>the</b> negative <b>emotions</b> <b>of</b> others (sym) ". The results of path analysis indicate that sens, sp, and sn have positive relationships with prosocial behaviors. Moreover, sp has a negative relationship with aggressive behaviors. Finally, we discuss the prospects for future research on empathy...|$|R

25|$|Western composers {{have noticed}} that the rhythm {{in a piece of}} qin music can change; once they seem to have got a beat, the beats change. This {{is due to the fact}} that qin players may use some free rhythm in their playing. Whatever beat they use will depend on the emotion or the feeling of the player, and how he interprets the piece. However, some melodies have {{sections}} of fixed rhythm which is played the same way generally. The main theme of Meihua Sannong, for example, uses this. Some sections of certain melodies require the player to play faster with force to express <b>the</b> <b>emotion</b> <b>of</b> the piece. Examples include the middle sections of Guangling San and Xiaoxiang Shuiyun. Other pieces, such as Jiu Kuang has a fixed rhythm throughout the entire piece.|$|E
25|$|The results {{reported}} in Contributions from Research on Anger and Cognitive Dissonance to Understanding the Motivational Functions of Asymmetrical Frontal Brain Activity (2004) {{indicate that the}} occurrence of cognitive dissonance is associated with neural activity in the left frontal cortex, a brain structure also associated with <b>the</b> <b>emotion</b> <b>of</b> anger; moreover, functionally, anger motivates neural activity in the left frontal cortex. Applying a directional model of Approach motivation, the study Anger and the Behavioural Approach System (2003) indicated that the relation between cognitive dissonance and anger is supported by neural activity in the left frontal cortex that occurs when a person takes control of the social situation causing the cognitive dissonance. Conversely, if the person cannot control or cannot change the psychologically stressful situation, {{he or she is}} without a motivation to change the circumstance, then there arise other, negative emotions to manage the cognitive dissonance, such as socially inappropriate behavior.|$|E
25|$|Educational {{psychology}} {{research on}} motivation {{is concerned with}} the volition or will that students bring to a task, their level of interest and intrinsic motivation, the personally held goals that guide their behavior, and their belief about the causes of their success or failure. As intrinsic motivation deals with activities that act as their own rewards, extrinsic motivation deals with motivations that are brought on by consequences or punishments. A form of attribution theory developed by Bernard Weiner describes how students' beliefs about the causes of academic success or failure affect their emotions and motivations. For example, when students attribute failure to lack of ability, and ability is perceived as uncontrollable, they experience the emotions of shame and embarrassment and consequently decrease effort and show poorer performance. In contrast, when students attribute failure to lack of effort, and effort is perceived as controllable, they experience <b>the</b> <b>emotion</b> <b>of</b> guilt and consequently increase effort and show improved performance.|$|E

The principle Rasas in the Ashtavakra (epic) are the Vīra and the Karuṇa. Like the 10th canto of Śrīmad Bhāgavatam and Bālakāṇḍa of the Rāmacaritamānasa, twelve verses in the seventeenth canto (17.42–17.53) of Śrībhārgavarāghavīyam have all the twelve Rasas {{used in the same}} context. While the pure Śṛngāra Rasa is the dominant Rasa in Bhṛṅgadūtam, Śrīsītārāmakelikaumudī is a work primarily of Vātsalya Rasa mixed with Śṛngāra Rasa. Rāghavagītaguñjana and Bhaktigītasudhā are works full of the Bhakti Rasa.|$|E
25|$|The study Cognitive Neuroscience of Social Emotions and Implications for Psychopathology: Examining Embarrassment, Guilt, Envy, and Schadenfreude (2014) {{identified}} neural correlations {{to specific}} social emotions (e.g. envy and embarrassment) {{as a measure}} of cognitive dissonance. The neural activity for <b>the</b> <b>emotion</b> <b>of</b> Envy (the feeling of displeasure at the good fortune of another person) was found to draw neural activity from the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. That such increased activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex occurred either when a person’s self-concept was threatened or when the person suffered embarrassment (social pain) caused by salient, upward social-comparison, by social-class snobbery. That social emotions, such as embarrassment, guilt, envy, and Schadenfreude (joy at the misfortune of another person) are correlated to reduced activity in the insular lobe, and with increased activity in the striate nucleus; those neural activities are associated with a reduced sense of empathy (social responsibility) and an increased propensity towards antisocial behavior (delinquency).|$|E

Defoe scored his first Sunderland goal on his home debut in a 2–0 victory over Burnley on 31 January 2015. His second goal came the following week on 7 February 2015, where he scored the opening goal in a 1–1 draw away to Swansea City.

This investigation, however, was designed to test whether people are also motivated to regulate <b>the</b> <b>emotions</b> <b>of</b> others to promote personal instrumental benefits. We tested whether participants would be motivated to increase unpleasant (Studies 1 – 3) or pleasant (Study 3) emotions in others, when they expected to benefit from doing so. We found that participants tried to increase an emotion in others when it was expected to lead to desirable outcomes, but decrease an emotion in others when it was expected to lead to undesirable outcomes. These instrumental motives were found even when they led participants to make their partners feel worse and their rivals feel better. Furthermore, the more participants expected others' emotions to result in behaviors that would personally benefit (or harm) participants themselves, the more they were motivated to increase (or decrease) <b>the</b> corresponding <b>emotion</b> in others.
