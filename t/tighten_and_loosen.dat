40|$|Practically every {{engineering}} {{product with}} {{any degree of}} complexity uses threaded fasteners. Although threaded fasteners are generally considered a mature technology, significant problems exist with their use. This study has investigated a number of issues with the tightening and self-loosening of threaded fasteners. - It was found that upon repeated tightening of electro-zinc plated fastners significant wear of the contact surfaces of the bolt/nut thread and nut face occured. This wear was accompanied by an increase in the friction coefficient causing a reduction in the clamp force provided for an assembly when tightened to a specific torque value. - The self-loosening characteristics of prevailing torque nuts were also investigated. It was found that there was a significant loss of prevailing torque when a fastner self-loosened when compared to the prevailing torque when being deliberately disassembled. The current standard test for prevailing torque nuts on re-use does not reflect this surprising result and leads to a significant over-estimate of the capability of this class of nut to resist self-loosening. This is a contribution to knowledge on this topic. - A further major original finding of this study has been that if an axial load is also acting on a joint which is experiencing transverse slip, prevailing torque nuts can continue to self-loosen leading to their possible detachment from bolts. A number of accidents have been caused by such detachments, but the cause was not understood partly because this detachment could not be reproduced on the standard loosening test. Work reported in this thesis has been found that if an external axial load is acting whilst the joint is experiencing transverse slip, under the approprioate conditions, the loosening process will continue until nut detachment occurs. - A series of tests has been completed in which the forces needed to <b>tighten</b> <b>and</b> <b>loosen</b> threaded fastners were measured whilst the joint was being subjected to transverse slip/vibration. Measurements were made of the frictional resistance forces in the circumfrential direction and the loosening torque acting on a fastner under transverse slip conditions. It was found that the loosening torque range varied between two positive limits rather than between zero and an upper limit as anticipated by the theory. It was also found that the friction coefficient in the circumfrential direction in the threads is greated than that on the nut face bearing surface during conditions of transverse slip...|$|E

40|$|Research on biologically {{inspired}} robots is advancing nowadays. Researhers observe {{mechanical properties}} and dynamic motions of many biological objects and such observations {{are used in}} order to implement on some robotic systems which can have similar characteristics. Many industrial robots and humanoid robots such as ASIMO, AIBO, QRIO are conventional type robots. Conventional humanoid robots and biological subjects differ in their mechanisms and control strategy. Biological subjects have musculoskeletal systems that can drive two joints {{at the same time}} while conventional robots use one joint drive mechanisms. Biological objects use their monoarticular and biarticular muscles in order to move their limbs and they have nearly perfect coordination of those muscles while jumping, landing, biped walking, running, etc. Muscle mechanism makes it easier to exert more force at the tip and the distribution of forces can be varied based on each activation of muscles. In this research, a biped robotic leg which is inspired by human leg muscle model is taken into account and walking behaviour of the leg in the existance of an external force is analised. Details of the mathematical modeling for such biologically inspired robotic leg is explained and simulation results for joint torque generation for different situations, especially in case of an vertical external force are presented. It has been shown that human has rational mechanism for output force control at the tip by taking the advantage of cooperative actuation of monoarticular and biarticular muscles. Especially, the magnitude of force is bigger in the direction from the fixed joint to the end effector. Human use this advantage for carrying a heavy body and also for jumping, walking and rejection of external forces. Additionally, using biarticular muscle improves the self-stability of the robotic leg by transfering energy between two adjacent joints. Dynamic motion is theorotically derived by taking mass, inertia, link lengths and gravity into account. Walking for robotic leg is formulated for both legs, one is when leg is carrying the body and react to external force, other is when leg is not in contact with the ground and taking one step forward. Joint torques are distributed to individual muscles by using a method called 2 -norm which is used to calculate the efficient way of distribution of 2 values into 3. As for muscle model, a spring-damper system is considered so that flexibility can be achieved and, DC motor is used as actuator to <b>tighten</b> <b>and</b> <b>loosen</b> the muscle. Wires are used in order to transfer rotational motion into translational motion. Each muscle is controlled by a DC motor after calculating the necessary displacements of each muscles. 報告番号:; 学位授与年月日: 2012 - 03 - 22; 学位の種別: 修士; 学位の種類: 修士(工学); 学位記番号:; 研究科・専攻: 工学系研究科電気系工学専...|$|E

40|$|Recent hydrogen–deuterium {{exchange}} {{experiments have}} highlighted <b>tightening</b> <b>and</b> <b>loosening</b> of protein structures upon ligand binding, {{with changes in}} bonding (DH) and order (DS) which contribute to the overall thermodynamics of ligand binding. <b>Tightening</b> <b>and</b> <b>loosening</b> show that ligand binding respectively stabilises or destabilises the internal structure of the protein, i. e. it shows positive or negative cooperativity between ligand binding and the receptor structure. In the case of membrane-bound receptors, such as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ligand gated ion channel receptors (LGICRs), most binding studies have focussed on association/dissociation constants. Where these have been broken down into enthalpic and entropic contributions, the phenomenon of “thermodynamic discrimination ” between antagonists and agonists has often been noted; e. g. for a receptor where agonist binding is predomi-nantly enthalpy driven, antagonist binding is predominantly entropy driven and vice versa. These data have not previously been considered {{in terms of the}} tightening, or loosening, of receptor structures that respectively occurs upon positively, or negatively, cooperative binding of ligand. Nor have they been considered in light of the homo- and hetero-oligomerisation of GPCRs and the possibility of ligand-induced changes in oligomerisation.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a series of tests in which high strength fasteners, socket head set screws (SHCS), were tightened to yield as a means of generating maximum clamping force.

Measurements were made during tightening to yield, under static load condition after yield <b>tightening,</b> <b>and</b> during <b>loosening.</b> The results obtained established that the lubrication conditions dramatically affect the magnitude of the maximum clamp load achieved on the joint and the torque distribution on the fastener.

For the period 1965 - 94, the six countries experienced 26 trade policy episodes: 11 <b>tightening,</b> <b>and</b> 15 <b>loosening</b> of trade policies. For the analysis, the author worked with four periods that coincided with diffreent prevailing exchange rate regimes: 1965 - 73, 1974 - 79, 1980 - 83 and 1984 - 04. Using a probit model, he {{examined the relationship between}} <b>tightening</b> <b>and</b> <b>loosening</b> trade policies <b>and</b> the current account balance, the exchange rate, and the growth in manufactured exports. His main conclusions: 1) experience in these six countries for 1965 - 94 confirmed the hypothesis that trade restrictions cannot solve current account problems; 2) for trade liberalization to work, there must be real devaluation either before or during liberalization. Reluctance to devalue, for one reason or another, may lead to trade restrictions. There is evidence that trade restrictions were used in lieu of devaluations during 1965 - 83. In 1984 - 94, however, the reluctance to devalue was overcome; 3) growth in manufactured exports helps maintain trade reform and release the economy from foreign exchange constraints. As expected, trade liberalization improved exports (liberalization reduces the bias against exports) while trade <b>tightening</b> hurt them; <b>and</b> 4) The impact of trade reform on the fiscal system cannot be predicted because tax revenues can go in either direction depending on initial conditions, the elasticity of supply in importable and exportable sectors, and the economy's growth rate.
