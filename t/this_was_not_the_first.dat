5|$|As with Hergé's two {{previous}} stories, The Secret of the Unicorn and Red Rackham's Treasure, The Seven Crystal Balls {{was designed as}} part of a twofold story arc, to be concluded with the then yet unnamed Prisoners of the Sun. Hergé planned for the former story to outline a mystery, while the latter would see his characters undertake an expedition to solve it. His use of an ancient mummy's curse around which the narrative revolved was inspired by tales of a curse of the pharaohs which had been unearthed during the archaeologist Howard Carter's 1922 discovery of Pharaoh Tutankhamun's tomb. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time that Hergé had been inspired by this tabloid story, having previously done so when authoring Cigars of the Pharaoh.|$|E
5|$|By 287 BC, the {{economic}} {{condition of the}} average plebeian had become poor. The problem appears to have centered around widespread indebtedness. The plebeians demanded relief, but the senators refused to address their situation. The result was the final plebeian secession. The plebeians seceded to the Janiculum hill. To end the secession, a dictator was appointed. The dictator passed a law (the Lex Hortensia), which ended the requirement that the patrician senators must agree before any bill could be considered by the Plebeian Council. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> law to require that an act of the Plebeian Council have {{the full force of}} law. The Plebeian Council acquired this power during a modification to the original Valerian law in 449 BC. The significance of this law was in the fact that it robbed the patricians of their final weapon over the plebeians. The result was that control over the state fell, not onto the shoulders of voters, but to the new plebeian nobility.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} a number of {{incidents}} in recent years where the river has been polluted and fish have been killed. In 2004 a pipe was broken by builders while they were working on the upgrade of the Fofanny water treatment works, near the source of the river. This resulted in sediment running into the river and the flooding of the plant. Fish were not directly harmed by this incident, and the Water Service carried out an investigation to assure drinking water had not been affected. However, concerns were raised by the Shimna Anglers Club that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time building work had affected the river, and that there was the possibility of long term harm to the salmon and sea trout.|$|E

On 12 October 1978, 55-year-old Letitia McCrory was killed by an IRA bomb explosion on the Belfast-Dublin line near Belfast Central station. The CAIN database indicates that in the 1978 explosion, an inadequate warning was given thus not allowing authorities time to evacuate the train completely before the device detonated.|$|E

However, this was the first time that an IRA had voluntarily decided to dispose of its arms. Some authors, like Patrick McCarthy, Peter Taylor and Brendan O'Brien concluded that, unlike previous IRA campaigns, the provisionals were not defeated.|$|E
