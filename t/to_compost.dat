500|$|Composting, the {{purposeful}} biodegradation {{of organic}} matter by microorganisms, [...] {{is among the most}} simple ways of treating food waste and thereby preventing it being sent to landfill. Since all biodegradable materials will eventually oxidise to become compost, the process can be undertaken at home with no running costs, although equipment can accelerate the process. Most components of food waste are putrescibles and will be broken down in a compost, however some exceptions will not (e.g. cooked foods and feces) and can attract vermin. The effectiveness of composting food waste depends on the available space (or storage capacity {{in the case of a}} compost bin) and the method of composting. Unlike in landfill, where it is mixed with other (non-biodegradable) materials, food waste decomposing in a compost does not release harmful gases. Similarly <b>to</b> <b>compost</b> created from other waste sources, composted food waste can be used to return nutrients to the soil if spread on the garden (see uses of compost).|$|E

Commenting on the directing, he thought [...] "If you had to guess, you might say that Proyas came out of the world of comic art himself, rather than music videos and advertising.

[...] He went on to say, Proyas was [...] "trying simultaneously to create a pure thriller and sci-fi nightmare along with his tongue-in-cheek critique of artifice. And this doesn't work out quite so well." [...] Author TCh of Time Out, felt the development of the Murdoch character was [...] "surprisingly engrossing" [...] and thought production wise, the [...] "art direction is always striking, and unlike most contemporary sci-fi, the movie does risk a cerebral approach, tapping a vein of postmodern paranoia." ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractGreen waste, {{consisting}} of leaves, wood cuttings from pruning, and grass collected from parks and gardens, {{is a source}} of biomass {{that can be used for}} material and energy valorization. Until recently, the EU-Waste Directive 2009 / 28 /EC allowed green waste to be used as feedstock only for compost. This paper presents a framework for examining the most sustainable processing options for green waste valorization in terms of the triple bottom line, People–Planet–Profit. A mathematical model is presented that optimizes profit, as well as environmental and social impact. Four processing options are compared and analyzed: composting, partial separation of wood cuttings prior <b>to</b> <b>composting,</b> partial separation of chopped wood cuttings in the sieve overflow after composting, and a combination of the last two options. Computational results for a Belgian case demonstrate that the optimal sustainable recovery solution is to separate a fraction of the wood cuttings in the sieve overflow for use as green energy feedstock. Additionally, if sufficiently large subsidies are available to separate wood cuttings prior <b>to</b> <b>composting,</b> the optimal solution shifts to one of partially separating the cuttings both prior <b>to</b> <b>composting</b> and in the sieve overflow, and then using the combined cuttings for energy valorization. Whenever cuttings are partially separated the remainder of the green waste is composted...|$|R
