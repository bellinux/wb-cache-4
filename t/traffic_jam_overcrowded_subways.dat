Behind the apparent chaos appear some logics of a transport system aiming at transporting {{millions of people}} every day. EDSA exemplifies the problems of congestion across the Metro Manila area, from <b>traffic</b> <b>jams</b> to <b>overcrowded</b> urban rail transport and inadequate pedestrian facilities. The situation seems to get worse over time; however there are some possibilities to improve it. I will comment {{on some of the}} recent policies concerning buses around Metro Manila and examine some "success stories" of transport policies and planning in other Asian megacities (Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Singapore, Osaka, Seoul [...] .) that may be relevant to the Philippine case...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This {{research}} {{is concerned with}} the properties of incident-induced <b>traffic</b> <b>jams</b> on rectangular grid networks and possible measures for preventing and controlling them. However, while most conventional traffic management measures aim to increase capacity and hence postpone the onset of gridlock, this research develops several alternative strategies for protecting networks from gridlock and dissipating <b>traffic</b> <b>jams</b> once they have formed. The treatment focuses on the installation of bans at specific network locations. Turn bans are imposed on selected links to break gridlock cycles at the centre of the <b>traffic</b> <b>jam.</b> By contrast, ahead bans are implemented around the <b>traffic</b> <b>jam</b> envelope to reduce input into critical sections of the road. The control strategies have been tested using a simulation model and some general control principles have emerged. While not immediately applicable to real networks, since they incorporate simplifying assumptions, they point to certain general characteristics of <b>traffic</b> <b>jam</b> growth and dispersal which would not be accessible in any other way.
