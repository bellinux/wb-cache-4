5|$|<b>The</b> <b>codex</b> is an Alexandrian text-type {{manuscript}} {{written in}} the 4th century in uncial letters on parchment. Scholarship considers <b>the</b> <b>Codex</b> Sinaiticus {{to be one of}} the best Greek texts of the New Testament, along with <b>the</b> <b>Codex</b> Vaticanus. Until the discovery by Constantin von Tischendorf of the Sinaiticus text, <b>the</b> <b>Codex</b> Vaticanus was unrivaled.|$|E
5|$|Five single {{sheets of}} bark paper were found {{associated}} with <b>the</b> <b>codex,</b> {{they had no}} stucco coating and were brown and water stained. Two of these had adhered to <b>the</b> <b>codex</b> {{and the other three}} may have once been with <b>the</b> <b>codex</b> but had separated. One of these sheets had a painted line in the same red hematite pigment used in <b>the</b> <b>codex</b> itself. A smaller sheet of bark paper was attached to the lined sheet and this smaller piece was submitted for radiocarbon dating. This testing produced a date for the sheet of AD 1230 ± 130; this would date the document {{to the end of the}} Early Postclassic period (c. 950–1200) and would make <b>the</b> <b>codex</b> the oldest known surviving Mesoamerican codex. The lack of incrustations or insect damage to <b>the</b> <b>codex</b> suggests that, if genuine, it was stored inside a container for hundreds of years. The overall damaged state of <b>the</b> <b>codex</b> conflicts with the good preservation of surviving parts; it may be that the damaged codex was deliberately decommissioned as a ritual object, rather than being simply discarded.|$|E

50|$|However, <b>the</b> Aleppo <b>Codex</b> {{has many}} virtues. In its {{text of the}} Prophets (where it is nearly complete) it has fewer {{spelling}} errors than either <b>the</b> Leningrad <b>Codex</b> or <b>the</b> Cairo <b>Codex.</b> It {{has long been known}} that there are nine spelling differences (insignificant to meaning) between manuscripts of either Ashkenaz or Sefardic origin and manuscripts of Yemenite origin—and <b>the</b> Aleppo <b>Codex</b> sides with <b>the</b> Yemenite manuscripts on those differences. <b>The</b> Aleppo <b>Codex</b> conforms consistently to Maimonides's quotations of Scripture, which <b>the</b> Leningrad <b>Codex</b> does not.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> Leningrad <b>Codex</b> (or <b>Codex</b> Leningradensis) is <b>the</b> oldest {{complete}} {{manuscript of}} the Hebrew Bible in Hebrew, using the masoretic text and Tiberian vocalization. [...] It is dated 1008 CE (or possibly 1009) {{according to its}} colophon. <b>The</b> Aleppo <b>Codex,</b> against which <b>the</b> Leningrad <b>Codex</b> was corrected, is several decades older, but parts of it have been missing since 1947, making <b>the</b> Leningrad <b>Codex</b> <b>the</b> oldest complete <b>codex</b> of <b>the</b> Tiberian mesorah that has survived intact to this day.|$|R

5|$|Most current {{scholars}} consider <b>the</b> <b>Codex</b> Vaticanus {{to be one}} of {{the best}} Greek texts of the New Testament, with <b>the</b> <b>Codex</b> Sinaiticus as its only competitor. Until the discovery by Tischendorf of the Sinaiticus text, <b>the</b> <b>Codex</b> was unrivaled. It was extensively used by Westcott and Hort in their edition of The New Testament in the Original Greek in 1881. The most widely sold editions of the Greek New Testament are largely based on the text of <b>the</b> <b>Codex</b> Vaticanus.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Codex</b> Sinaiticus {{came to the}} {{attention}} of scholars in the 19th century at Saint Catherine's Monastery in the Sinai Peninsula, with further material discovered in the 20th and 21st centuries. Although parts of <b>the</b> <b>codex</b> are scattered across four libraries around the world, most of the manuscript is today vested in the British Library in London, where it is on public display. Since its discovery, study of <b>the</b> <b>Codex</b> Sinaiticus has proven to be useful to scholars for critical studies of biblical text.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>codex</b> {{was tested}} in the Instituto de Física of the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México in Mexico City using a 3 megaelectronvolt pelletron {{particle}} accelerator. Testing methods applied to <b>the</b> <b>codex</b> included ultraviolet imaging, infrared reflectography, optical microscopy, particle-induced X-ray emission and Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS). The specific aim of this non-destructive testing was to compare the materials used in <b>the</b> <b>codex</b> with those used in other pre-Columbian codices.|$|E

5|$|The {{third and}} last {{corrector}} (C3) {{wrote in the}} 800's, possibly in Constantinople. He conformed readings of <b>the</b> <b>codex</b> to ecclesiastical use, inserting many accents, breathings, and vocal notes.

5|$|According to Skeat {{the note}} in <b>the</b> <b>codex</b> {{indicated}} that the manuscript had not previously been in the Patriarchal Library in Alexandria. The manuscript was carried from Constantinople to Alexandria between 1308 and 1316, together with two mentioned above manuscripts of Chrysostom. It remained in Alexandria until 1621, when Cyril removed it once to Constantinople. Whether was originally written, in Constantinople or in Alexandria, is another question. Skeat {{did not try to}} give the answer on this question ("if any future scholar wisches to claim a Constantinopolitan origin for <b>the</b> <b>Codex</b> Alexandrinus, it is at least open to him to do so"). This view was supported by McKendrick, who proposes Ephesian provenance of <b>the</b> <b>codex.</b>|$|E

5|$|Following Thompson's attack {{upon the}} {{veracity}} of <b>the</b> <b>codex,</b> a number of scholars published their opinions that the document is genuine {{over the course of}} the 1980s and early 1990s, including John B. Carlson, Yuri Knorozov, Thomas A. Lee, Jr., Jesús Ignacio Mora Echeverría, George E. Stuart, and Karl Taube. In 2000, German epigrapher Nikolai Grube expressed his belief that the document is genuine, based upon the precision of the Venus almanac. However, in a later publication from 2012, he clearly calls <b>the</b> <b>codex</b> a forgery. In 2002, French archaeologist Claude-François Baudez commented – like Thompson before – that <b>the</b> <b>codex</b> serves no divinatory purpose and was useless as an aid to a Maya priest; he believes that the document is the product of a forger using pre-Columbian materials but relatively ignorant of his subject. <b>The</b> <b>codex</b> is notable in its use of prominent illustrations of uniform size and the almost complete absence of hieroglyphic text; the deities lack names and the cardinal directions are unmarked. In a paper published in 2003, the authors (including Mayanist Stephen D. Houston) argue that the iconography and lack of hieroglyphic text are the result of a strong central Mexican stylistic influence.|$|E
5|$|In 1845, Archimandrite Porphyrius Uspensky (1804–1885), at {{that time}} head of the Russian Ecclesiastical Mission in Jerusalem and {{subsequently}} Bishop of Chigirin, visited the monastery and <b>the</b> <b>codex</b> was shown to him, together with leaves which Tischendorf had not seen. In 1846, Captain C. K. MacDonald visited Mount Sinai, saw <b>the</b> <b>codex,</b> and bought two codices (495 and 496) from the monastery.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> Madrid <b>Codex</b> (also {{known as}} <b>the</b> Tro-Cortesianus <b>Codex</b> or <b>the</b> Troano <b>Codex)</b> {{is one of}} three {{surviving}} pre-Columbian Maya books dating to the Postclassic period of Mesoamerican chronology (circa 900-1521 AD). <b>The</b> Madrid <b>Codex</b> is held by the Museo de América in Madrid and is considered {{to be the most important}} piece in its collection.

5|$|In 1985 it {{was moved}} to the Cambridge University Library (BFBS Ms 213).

The University was given right of first refusal and has until February 2014 to raise the money to acquire <b>the</b> <b>codex.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the 16th century Western {{scholars}} {{became aware}} of the manuscript {{as a consequence of the}} correspondence between Erasmus and the prefects of the Vatican Library, successively Paulus Bombasius, and Juan Ginés de Sepúlveda. In 1521, Bombasius was consulted by Erasmus as to whether <b>the</b> <b>Codex</b> Vaticanus contained the Comma Johanneum, and Bombasius supplied a transcript of 1 John 4:1–3 and 1 John 5:7–11 to show that it did not. Sepúlveda in 1533 cross-checked all places where Erasmus's New Testament (the Textus Receptus) differed from the Vulgate, and supplied Erasmus with 365 readings where <b>the</b> <b>Codex</b> Vaticanus supported the latter, although the list of these 365 readings has been lost. Consequently, <b>the</b> <b>Codex</b> Vaticanus acquired the reputation of being an old Greek manuscript that agreed with the Vulgate rather than with the Textus Receptus. Not until much later would scholars realise it conformed to a text that differed from both the Vulgate and the Textus Receptus – a text that could also be found in other known early Greek manuscripts, such as <b>the</b> <b>Codex</b> Regius (L), housed in the French Royal Library (now Bibliothèque nationale de France).|$|E
5|$|Johann Christian Götze (1692–1749), German theologian and {{director}} of the Royal Library at Dresden, purchased <b>the</b> <b>codex</b> from a private owner in Vienna in 1739 while traveling to Italy. Thompson speculates that <b>the</b> <b>codex</b> was sent as a tribute to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor by Hernán Cortés, governor of Mexico, since examples of local writings and other Maya items were sent to the king in 1519 when he was living in Vienna.|$|E
