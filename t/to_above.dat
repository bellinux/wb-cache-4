5|$|A key {{distinction}} between the bills of rights of the Commonwealth jurisdictions referred <b>to</b> <b>above</b> and the Singapore Constitution {{is that in the}} latter document, the grounds set out in Article 15(4) for restricting freedom of religion are not expressly subject to any requirement of reasonableness or necessity in a democratic society. One may query whether this is sufficient justification for a Singapore court to decline to apply a proportionality analysis to Article 15(4).|$|E

5|$|Cylinders {{may also}} be filled without water-bath cooling, and may be charged <b>to</b> <b>above</b> the nominal working {{pressure}} to the developed pressure appropriate to the temperature when filled.

5|$|Europium {{becomes a}} {{superconductor}} {{when it is}} cooled below 1.8 K and compressed <b>to</b> <b>above</b> 80 GPa. This is because europium is divalent in the metallic state, and is converted into the trivalent state by the applied pressure. In the divalent state, the strong local magnetic moment (J = 7/2) suppresses the superconductivity, which is induced by eliminating this local moment (J = 0 in Eu3+).|$|E

5|$|In regular service, the Pioneer Zephyr had {{its share}} of accidents. In 1939 it was {{involved}} in a head-on collision with a freight train that completely destroyed the cab.

5|$|Observations {{have failed}} to note signs of {{accretion}} leading up to Type Ia supernovae, and this is now thought to be because the star is first loaded up <b>to</b> <b>above</b> the Chandrasekhar limit while also being spun up to a very high rate by the same process. Once the accretion stops the star gradually slows until the spin is no longer enough to prevent the explosion.|$|E
5|$|Carlton {{delivered}} the series to ITV in August 2003 for broadcast {{in the autumn}} schedules, but it was then rescheduled four times {{over the next several}} months, before ITV eventually set a premiere date of 11 July 2004. It was then rescheduled to the preceding Wednesday, in the 9 pm slot. The series lost two million viewers over two weeks and ITV pulled episode four from the schedules on the morning before it was due for broadcast, replacing it with It Shouldn't Happen on a TV Soap, a bloopers programme, which returned ITV's ratings <b>to</b> <b>above</b> the five million mark.|$|E

5|$|Charging {{an empty}} dive {{cylinder}} also causes a temperature rise as the gas inside the cylinder is compressed by the inflow of higher pressure gas, though this temperature rise may initially be tempered because compressed gas from a storage bank {{at room temperature}} decreases in temperature when it decreases in pressure, so at first the empty cylinder is charged with cold gas, but {{the temperature of the}} gas in the cylinder then increases <b>to</b> <b>above</b> ambient as the cylinder fills to the working pressure.|$|E
5|$|Density {{criteria}} {{range from}} above 3.5g/cm3 <b>to</b> <b>above</b> 7g/cm3. Atomic weight definitions {{can range from}} greater than sodium (atomic weight 22.98); greater than 40 (excluding s- and f-block metals, hence starting with scandium); or more than 200, i.e. from mercury onwards. Atomic numbers of heavy metals are generally given as greater than 20 (calcium); sometimes this is capped at 92 (uranium). Definitions based on atomic number have been criticised for including metals with low densities. For example, rubidium in group (column) 1 of the periodic table has an atomic number of 37 but a density of only 1.532g/cm3, which is below the threshold figure used by other authors. The same problem may occur with atomic weight based definitions.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{entering}} the crisis {{with a low}} level of public debtroughly 40% of GDPand a moderate deficit compared to many European nations, the UK's ability to take discretionary fiscal action was limited by the burden of bank bail-outs on public finances. The tax revenue from financial services, which was conservatively estimated at 13.9% of UK tax income in 2007, fell alarmingly as the crisis affected bank profits. This contributed to a significant rise in the deficit to an estimated £175billion (12.4% of GDP) in 2009–10 and a rise in the national debt <b>to</b> <b>above</b> 80% of GDP at its peak. The UK had significant automatic stabilisers which contributed far more than discretionary action and more than most other countries.|$|E

5|$|In the 1995 {{study by}} Chase et al. {{referred}} <b>to</b> <b>above,</b> {{which was the}} largest yet to use purely molecular data, the results demonstrated paraphyly of the lilioids. However, because their data contradicted purely morphological phylogenies they were reluctant to draw definite conclusions as to the monophyly of this group. They identified four major clades of monocots. They named these alismatids, aroids, stemonoids and dioscoreoids, in addition to Acorus, and {{a core group of}} Asparagales, Liliales and commelinoids. They based the names of these groups on the closest corresponding superorders and orders of Dahlgren, with the exception of stemonoids (based on Stemonaceae for which there was no obvious equivalent).|$|E

5|$|Papa Stour is {{the subject}} of a 1299 {{manuscript}} written in Old Norse, which is the oldest surviving document from Shetland. It deals with a dramatic incident in the house of Duke Hakon Magnusson, who was later to become King Hakon V of Norway. There is a circle of stones near the beach at Housa Voe, which are the remains of a 'ting', or local assembly. This was the scene of a duel, fought and won by Lord Thorvald Thoresson, who was accused of corruption in the 1299 document and was later called ‘dominus de Papay’. (The story of his unfortunate daughter is referred <b>to</b> <b>above.)</b> The remains of Duke Hakon's thirteenth-century house are still visible near Housa Voe.|$|E

5|$|The outer rainbands of {{the storm}} first began {{affecting}} Guatemala and southeastern Mexico late on June 1. In Mexico, the peak 24-hour rainfall total was 4.96inches (126mm) in Huixtla, and across southeastern Mexico, the rainfall led <b>to</b> <b>above</b> normal levels in many rivers. An automatic surface station in Puerto Madero, Mexico recorded sustained winds of 36mph (58km/h) with gusts of 53mph (85km/h) shortly after landfall. In most locations, damage from the storm was minor, limited to downed light posts, some damaged roofs, and a brief power outage. However, winds and rains from the storm caused moderate to severe crop damage in the mountain range of southern Chiapas. About 35sq.miles (90km²) of banana crops were destroyed, with about 4sq.miles (10km²) of coffee damaged. The passage {{of the storm}} also resulted in damage to cocoa beans, mango, coconut, and other vegetables, with crop damage totaling about 200million pesos (2007MXN, $55million 2007USD). As {{a result of the}} crop damage, the government of Mexico provided 108million pesos (2007MXN, $10million 2007USD) in financial aid to the affected farmers.|$|E
5|$|Treating. Treating is {{the act of}} corruptly giving or providing, or paying {{in whole}} or part for, any food, drink, refreshment, cigarette, {{entertainment}} or other thing, or any money or ticket or other means to enable such things to be obtained, in order to corruptly influence a person to vote or refrain from voting, or to induce the person to attend an election meeting, or to reward him for having done so.
