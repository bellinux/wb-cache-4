40|$|Electrostatic {{actuators}} {{are common}} in many MicroElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS) devices. These actuators tend to be fabricated as two parallel planar structures, which works well for applications where the motion and electrode spacing are small. To achieve larger displacements, very large voltages are needed. Curved electrodes provide a way to create actuators that achieve large displacements and large forces at much lower voltages than comparable parallel plate designs. This thesis describes two methods for creating curved silicon membranes {{that can be easily}} integrated into practical devices. The first method uses air pressure to plastically deform a silicon membrane at high temperature. During wafer bonding, gas is trapped behind a thin silicon membrane. High temperature annealing causes the gas to pressurize, plastically deforming the silicon membrane. A model predicting the extent of plastic deformation was matched with actual deformation measurements. The second method utilizes the strain resulting from curing epoxy. A diaphragm is formed by etching through the handle of an SOI wafer, leaving a circular silicon membrane. After filling the etched hole with epoxy and covering it, the epoxy shrinks and pulls the membrane into a curved shape. These curved membranes have been integrated into electrostatic actuators. Pull-in was demonstrated on devices with a wide range circular membranes. The actuation is reliable and requires relatively low voltages. A first order model based on the principle of virtual work was developed that accurately predicts the onset of pull-in. Predictions are compared for several electrode profiles and in every case the critical voltages were lower than for parallel plates. Finally, the design of a MEMS vacuum pump that incorporates curved electrostatic actuators is analyzed. Factors that affect the base pressure, such as dead volume and pumping volume, are discussed in detail. With low leak rates, base pressures as low as 0. 24 Torr could be achieved in these devices in a <b>two</b> <b>stage</b> <b>pump.</b> Guidelines for the design and operation of future MEMS diaphragm pumps are proposed. by Eric B.

40|$|The devlopment of {{domestic}} heat pump systems is mainly {{based on the}} use of volumetric oil lubricated compressors. Following the implementation of economizer based rotary compressors, which represented a major improvement step, one major opportunity to improve both efficiency and heat rate, in particular for high temperature lift heat pumps, is to use <b>two</b> <b>stage</b> cycles. However the reliability of those can be strongly impaired by oil migration, resulting in oil level unbalance when using oil lubricated compressors, unless more sophisticated auxiliaries including an oil pump are added. The need for this additional equipment, the requirement of higher vapour velocity for oil return and impediments to the efficiency of enhanced surfaces for heat exchangers are some of the incentives for the development of oil free compressor systems. As high speed bearings and electrical motors are gradually becoming available this open the way to consider the use of low power, compact, oil-free and high speed radial compressors. This paper describes the basic design of a high speed single stage radial compressor for high pressure ratios and a wide flow range aimed for the first <b>stage</b> of a <b>two</b> <b>stage</b> heat <b>pump.</b> A commercially available 3 D viscous code has been applied to calculate the flow field through the impeller and the diffuser.

40|$|The direct {{simulation}} Monte Carlo (DSMC) {{method was}} used to investigate the efficiency of differential pumping in linear plasma generators operating at high gas flows. Skimmers are used to separate the neutrals from the plasma beam, which is guided from the source to the target by a strong axial magnetic field. In this way, the neutrals are prevented to reach the target region. The neutral flux to the target must be lower than the plasma flux to enable ITER relevant plasma-surface interaction (PSI) studies. It is therefore essential to control the neutral gas dynamics. The DSMC method {{was used to}} model the expansion of a hot gas in a low pressure vessel where a small discrepancy in shock position {{was found between the}} simulations and a well-established empirical formula. <b>Two</b> <b>stage</b> differential <b>pumping</b> was modeled and applied in the linear plasma devices Pilot-PSI and PLEXIS. In Pilot-PSI a factor of 4. 5 pressure reduction for H 2 has been demonstrated. Both simulations and experiments showed that the optimum skimmer position depends on the position of the shock and therefore shifts for different gas parameters. The shape of the skimmer has to be designed such that it has a minimum impact on the shock structure. A too large angle between the skimmer and the forward direction of the gas flow leads to an influence on the expansion structure. A pressure increase in front of the skimmer is formed and the flow of the plasma beam becomes obstructed. It has been shown that a skimmer with an angle around 53 ° gives the best performance. The use of skimmers is implemented {{in the design of the}} large linear plasma generator Magnum-PSI.

40|$|The {{subject of}} this project {{is to develop a}} high {{performance}} air water heat pump which is able to be introducted in the retrofit market. The system requirements of this market are heating temperatures of 65 °C, at ambient temperatures descending until - 12 °C. To provide higher base performance ratings, the choice of the thermodynamic system is a <b>two</b> <b>stage</b> heat <b>pump</b> with economizer exchanger. This type of heat pump has improved performances over a large range of application. For heat output adjustment it can be switched to different heating modes (single <b>stage</b> and <b>two</b> <b>stage).</b> For the <b>two</b> <b>stage</b> cycle, the lubrification of the compressors is a major aspect to be studied. A new online measurement method is applied to evaluate the oil quantity which migrates through the cycle. The absorption spectre of the refrigerant - oil mixture is analysed with a Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometer and oil quantity can be extracted with high precision. (The analysis method has still to be refined). The infrared spectometers also allow to control the composition of the refrigerant mixture. A single capture of the spectre needs about 30 seconds. The measurements have to be referred to a regularly updated background spectre, which requests to vacuumize and clean the measurement cell. The oil migration is simultaneously measured with a high precision densitymeter. The output signal allows a real time follow of the oil quantity and the transmitter will give reliable results after calibration over the application range. Any change of the refrigerant composition cannot be captured by the densitymeter. The resulting density shift would therefore not be attributed correctly to the amount of oil. For the analysis of oil distribution in the whole heat pump, the measurement method to determine the oil level in the compressor crankcase, and the observation of the oil retention in the evaporator are also discussed in this project. The heat pump design has been made, based on simulations of the thermodynamic cycle and using existing parts in the laboratory, such as the evaporator and the condenser. The design aim is to avoid oil trapping and to ensure oil transport in the vapour lines of the heat pump. free download : www. waermepumpe. ch/fe/berichte. htm...|$|R

The NET is a linear electrostatic trap configured as an image charge mass spectrometer, as first described by Zajfman and co-workers on ion ensembles [31, 32] and in a single-particle application by Benner [1]. Briefly, the NET is gated to trap one particle at a time, before measuring the mass-to-charge ratio and the absolute charge of the particle. These particles can be trapped in the NET with an efficiency ~ 70 % for periods in excess of 5  seconds with a distribution of oscillation frequencies in the several hundred Hertz range. A Labview-based data acquisition code uses the m/z data to calculate the required switching times for the LINAC to accelerate the particle up to the required velocity. The particle is then released from the trap into the LINAC for acceleration to the desired velocity.|$|R

The large amount of ionisation arising from x-ray absorption can be explained using a model based upon multiple scattering of the ejected Auger electron that produces secondary electron emission, particle charging and tertiary electron emission due to the high electric fields thus generated in the agregated nanostructure of the soot particle [4]. Such models have been developed by astrophysicists to model the influence of cosmic x-rays on interstellar dust grains [5, 6].
