5|$|If any motion exists {{without a}} cause, <b>then</b> <b>not</b> every {{proposition}} will be either true or false. For {{that which has}} not efficient causes is neither true nor false. But every proposition is either true or false. Therefore, there is no motion without a cause. And if this is so, then all effects owe their existence to prior causes. And if this is so, all things happen by fate. It follows therefore that whatever happens, happens by fate.|$|E

5|$|After much persuasion, he overcame {{his fear}} and {{eventually}} made three trips to Singapore to restore his murals in December 1963, July 1982 and May 1988. The 1982 restoration was more intensive and the invaluable assistance given to Warren by {{the officers and}} boys of the SAF Boys' School enabled {{the bulk of the}} work to be completed. Of the original five murals, only one was not fully restored; the mural of St Luke in Prison. Stanley's original tracing of the drawing was missing, and he could not remember the details of the missing portion. In 1985, Stanley's original drawing was discovered in the memorabilia of Wally Hammond who had been a fellow prisoner with Stanley. These original sketches were subsequently donated to the National Archives of Singapore. From the original, Stanley painted a small picture, which was placed below the remaining piece of the mural in 1988. He was, by <b>then,</b> <b>not</b> fit enough to restore the actual mural.|$|E
5|$|Current {{commonly}} accepted physical theories imply or {{assume the}} photon to be strictly massless. If the photon {{is not a}} strictly massless particle, it would not move at the exact speed of light, c in vacuum. Its speed would be lower and depend on its frequency. Relativity would be unaffected by this; the so-called speed of light, c, would <b>then</b> <b>not</b> be the actual speed at which light moves, but a constant of nature which is the upper bound on speed that any object could theoretically attain in space-time. Thus, {{it would still be}} the speed of space-time ripples (gravitational waves and gravitons), but it would not be the speed of photons.|$|E

After taking over Parlophone, as head of artists and repertoire, when Preuss retired in 1955, Martin recorded classical and Baroque music, original cast recordings, and regional music from around Britain and Ireland.|$|E

5|$|The novelist Matteo Bandello {{observed}} Leonardo at {{work and}} wrote that some days he would paint from dawn till dusk without stopping to eat and <b>then</b> <b>not</b> paint {{for three or four}} days at a time. This was beyond the comprehension of the prior of the convent, who hounded him until Leonardo asked Ludovico to intervene. Vasari describes how Leonardo, troubled over his ability to adequately depict the faces of Christ and the traitor Judas, told the Duke that he might be obliged to use the prior as his model.|$|E
5|$|Chapter X {{examines}} whether {{patterns in}} the fossil record are better explained by common descent and branching evolution through natural selection, than by the individual creation of fixed species. Darwin expected species to change slowly, {{but not at the}} same rate – some organisms such as Lingula were unchanged since the earliest fossils. The pace of natural selection would depend on variability and change in the environment. This distanced his theory from Lamarckian laws of inevitable progress. It has been argued that this anticipated the punctuated equilibrium hypothesis, but other scholars have preferred to emphasise Darwin's commitment to gradualism. He cited Richard Owen's findings that the earliest members of a class were a few simple and generalised species with characteristics intermediate between modern forms, and were followed by increasingly diverse and specialised forms, matching the branching of common descent from an ancestor. Patterns of extinction matched his theory, with related groups of species having a continued existence until extinction, <b>then</b> <b>not</b> reappearing. Recently extinct species were more similar to living species than those from earlier eras, and as he had seen in South America, and William Clift had shown in Australia, fossils from recent geological periods resembled species still living in the same area.|$|E

5|$|In 1965 Britain {{commenced}} {{an official}} programme of metrication that, , {{had not been}} completed. The British metrication programme signalled the start of metrication programmes elsewhere in the Commonwealth, though India had started its programme in 1959, six years before the United Kingdom. South Africa (<b>then</b> <b>not</b> {{a member of the}} Commonwealth) set up a Metrication Advisory Board in 1967, New Zealand set up its Metric Advisory Board in 1969, Australia passed the Metric Conversion Act in 1970 and Canada appointed a Metrication Commission in 1971. Metrication in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa was essentially complete within a decade, while metrication in India and Canada is not complete. In addition the lakh and crore are still in widespread use in India, while in Canada the square foot is still widespread for commercial and residential advertisements and partially in construction because of the close trade relations with the United States, and the railways of Canada continue to measure their trackage in miles and speed limits in miles per hour because they also operate in the United States. Most other Commonwealth countries adopted the metric system during the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|In the March 2005 {{issue of}} Science, Mary Higby Schweitzer of North Carolina State University and colleagues {{announced}} {{the recovery of}} soft tissue from the marrow cavity of a fossilized leg bone from a Tyrannosaurus rex. The bone had been intentionally, though reluctantly, broken for shipping and <b>then</b> <b>not</b> preserved in the normal manner, specifically because Schweitzer was hoping to test it for soft tissue. Designated as the Museum of the Rockies specimen 1125, or MOR 1125, the dinosaur was previously excavated from the Hell Creek Formation. Flexible, bifurcating blood vessels and fibrous but elastic bone matrix tissue were recognized. In addition, microstructures resembling blood cells were found inside the matrix and vessels. The structures bear resemblance to ostrich blood cells and vessels. Whether an unknown process, distinct from normal fossilization, preserved the material, or the material is original, the researchers do not know, and they are careful not to make any claims about preservation. If it {{is found to be}} original material, any surviving proteins may be used as a means of indirectly guessing some of the DNA content of the dinosaurs involved, because each protein is typically created by a specific gene. The absence of previous finds {{may be the result of}} people assuming preserved tissue was impossible, therefore not looking. Since the first, two more tyrannosaurs and a hadrosaur have also been found to have such tissue-like structures. Research on some of the tissues involved has suggested that birds are closer relatives to tyrannosaurs than other modern animals.|$|E
