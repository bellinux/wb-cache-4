5|$|The Anatomy Act 1832 {{ended the}} {{dissection}} of murderers, {{and most of}} the animal tortures depicted were outlawed by <b>the</b> <b>Cruelty</b> to Animals Act 1835, so by the 1850s The Four Stages of Cruelty had come to be viewed as a somewhat historical series, though still one with the power to shock, a power it retains for a modern audience.|$|E
5|$|The {{practice}} of hare coursing has only recently, in historical terms, been debated in Parliament, although Parliament created an exemption in 1921 from <b>the</b> <b>cruelty</b> legislation, the Protection of Animals Act 1911, for animals released for coursing. Eric Heffer, MP for Liverpool Walton, {{was a major}} opponent of coursing in the late 1960s, and Prime Minister Harold Wilson joined in the criticism.|$|E
5|$|After much delay (two of its ten members {{died and}} several fell ill), the {{commission}} reported its findings in March 1912. Its 139-page report recommended {{an increase in}} the number of full-time inspectors from two to four; restrictions on the use of curare, a poison used to immobilize animals during experiments; the euthanasia of animals in severe pain, even if it meant frustrating the experiment; and the tightening of the definition and practice of pithing. It also recommended the maintenance of more detailed records and the establishment of a committee to advise the Secretary of State on matters related to <b>the</b> <b>Cruelty</b> to Animals Act. The latter became the Animal Procedures Committee under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986.|$|E

5|$|Despite the uncertainly {{surrounding}} {{the inception of}} his reign, the chronicle reveals that Lǫgmaðr faced continued opposition from within his own family {{in the form of}} an ongoing rebellion by his brother, Haraldr. Lǫgmaðr eventually overcame Haraldr, however, and is stated to have had the latter blinded and emasculated. Afterwards, if the chronicle is to be believed, Lǫgmaðr repented <b>the</b> <b>cruelty</b> that he had inflicted upon Haraldr, and remorsefully resigned his kingdom, before setting off to Jerusalem, where he died.|$|E
5|$|The current {{president}} is Venkatraman Ramakrishnan, {{who took over}} from Paul Nurse on 30 November 2015. Historically, {{the duties of the}} president have been both formal and social. <b>The</b> <b>Cruelty</b> to Animals Act 1876 left the president {{as one of the few}} individuals capable of certifying that a particular experiment on an animal was justified. In addition, the president is to act as the government's chief (albeit informal) advisor on scientific matters. Yet another task is that of entertaining distinguished foreign guests and scientists.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to {{evidence of the}} wealth brought by the slave trade there are several significant links to the abolitionists. Bristol's Hannah More was an influential member of the Society for Effecting the Abolition of the African Slave Trade. In the Seven Stars Public House Thomas Clarkson collected evidence for William Wilberforce on <b>the</b> <b>cruelty</b> of the trade in humans. Bristol Cathedral contains several memorials to people active in the abolition cause, including a bust of Robert Southey. John Wesley opposed the trade in humans and in 1774 his sermon at the New Room against slavery was disturbed by explosion. Several plays adopted by the abolitionists were performed at the Bristol Old Vic, including Oroonoko, {{the story of an}} enslaved African and The Padlock, which was praised by Clarkson for its importance to the abolition cause.|$|E

5|$|The {{chronology}} {{and circumstances}} surrounding the conclusion of Lǫgmaðr's reign are uncertain. According to one source, he voluntarily resigned the kingship and journeyed to Jerusalem where he died. This account could be evidence that he died on crusade: one possibility is the First Crusade, perhaps in the entourage of Robert II, Duke of Normandy; another possibility is the so-called Norwegian Crusade, in the entourage of Sigurðr Magnússon, King of Norway. Although one source claims that Lǫgmaðr's trek to the Holy Land was undertaken in remorse for <b>the</b> <b>cruelty</b> he had inflicted upon Haraldr, {{another possibility is that}} he was forced into exile instead. Whatever the case, it is apparent that about a decade after Magnús' death, the Crovan dynasty was restored to the kingship in the person of Lǫgmaðr's youngest brother.|$|E

25|$|Animal cruelty can {{be broken}} down into two main categories: active and passive. Passive cruelty is typified by cases of neglect, in which <b>the</b> <b>cruelty</b> is a lack of action rather than the action itself. Examples of neglect are starvation, dehydration, {{parasite}} infestations, allowing a collar to grow into an animal’s skin, inadequate shelter in extreme weather conditions, and failure to seek veterinary care when necessary. In many cases of neglect in which an investigator believes that <b>the</b> <b>cruelty</b> occurred out of ignorance, the investigator may attempt to educate the pet owner, then revisit the situation. In more severe cases, exigent circumstances may require that the animal be removed for veterinary care.|$|E
