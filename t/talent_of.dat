5|$|Keegan took Newcastle to two {{consecutive}} runners-up finishes {{in the league}} in 1995–96 and 1996–97, coming very close to winning the title in the former season. This success was in part due to the <b>talent</b> <b>of</b> players like David Ginola, Les Ferdinand and Alan Shearer, who was signed on 30 July 1996 for a then world record fee of £15million.|$|E

5|$|In the playoffs, Ottawa's fourth placing in the Conference {{meant that}} the first-round playoff series was against the fifth-seeded Pittsburgh Penguins. Some media were expecting the Penguins to win the series for three reasons—the Penguins had won the season series, the Senators' past playoff {{troubles}} and the strong young <b>talent</b> <b>of</b> the Penguins, particularly young star Sidney Crosby. The Senators, however, won easily by a score of four games to one, including a 3–0 shutout win in Game 5. This was the only series where the Senators were the higher-seeded team.|$|E
5|$|Johnson was {{exceptional}} {{because he}} played point guard despite being 6ft 9in (2.06m), a size reserved normally for frontcourt players. He combined {{the size of}} a power forward, the one-on-one skills of a swingman, and the ball handling <b>talent</b> <b>of</b> a guard, making him {{one of the most dangerous}} triple-double threats of all time; his 138triple-double games are second only to Oscar Robertson's 181. Johnson is the only player in NBA Finals history to have triple-doubles in multiple series-clinching games.|$|E

[...] Antiochus was diverted from his goal of capturing the city, however, when the [...] "Gerrhaeans bought off his attack with 500 <b>talents</b> <b>of</b> silver, 1000 <b>talents</b> <b>of</b> frankincense, and 200 <b>talents</b> <b>of</b> 'stacte' myrrh."

5|$|The 1950s decade {{ended with}} Murphy doing three westerns. He co-starred with 14-year-old Sandra Dee in the 1959 film The Wild and the Innocent. The film's cast was rounded out with {{respected}} <b>talent</b> <b>of</b> the era in Gilbert Roland, Joanne Dru and Jim Backus. His collaboration with Walter Mirisch {{on the black}} and white Cast a Long Shadow included an uncredited stint as co-producer. The film co-starred Terry Moore. His performance in No Name on the Bullet was well received. The storyline follows the cool, jaded hired gun as the townspeople are gripped with fear by his presence.|$|E
5|$|The sculptors {{very likely}} also {{operated}} in Brescia because Bartolomeo {{was known to}} have resided there at least between 1501 and 1503, and such a long presence can be justified only by admitting the existence of significant local commissions. There {{is reason to believe}} that the Sanmicheli organisation should have deeper roots in Brescia during the two years mentioned, ranging from the construction of dei Miracoli to that of the Loggia. With the Loggia, however, the mature <b>talent</b> <b>of</b> Cairano broke into the Brescian art scene, and his powerful sculptural sequence of the Caesars testifies to the decline of the Sanmicheli, whose ornate style was no longer of interest to the municipality and nobility.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, lack of {{popularity}} with {{the fans and}} a fall out with Lorenzo Sanz resulted in Capello being sacked, and Vicente del Bosque eventually taking over in November of that year. The squad was also largely different from the previous squad: the budding young <b>talent</b> <b>of</b> Raúl, Iker Casillas, Fernando Morientes and Guti being supported {{with the arrival of}} Steve McManaman and Nicolas Anelka from the English Premier League, alongside local talents Míchel Salgado, and Iván Helguera and the older veterans such as Fernando Hierro and Roberto Carlos. In Del Bosque's first season in charge, Real won the European Cup/Champions League for the eight time, following a 3–0 victory over Valencia in the final with goals from Morientes, McManaman and Raúl. This victory marked the beginning of a successful period in Real Madrid's history.|$|E

5|$|Heading into Bound for Glory IV, TNA {{created a}} {{company-wide}} narrative {{that led to}} an on-screen rivalry between professional wrestling veterans, who played the villains, and the younger <b>talent</b> <b>of</b> the company, who played the heroic characters. Several matches and storylines {{that led to the}} event were connected to this narrative, such as the storyline surrounding the TNA World Heavyweight Championship and the bout pitting Kurt Angle against Jeff Jarrett. This narrative started at TNA's Victory Road PPV event on July13, where Samoa Joe defended the TNA World Heavyweight Championship against Booker T. During the match, Joe relentlessly assaulted Booker T to the point that referees nor security could stop him. This led to Sting interfering in the contest trying to calm Joe down. Joe refused to listen and continued his assault, causing Sting to hit Joe in the stomach with a baseball in order for Joe to stop, resulting in a no contest. Sting did not state a reason as to why he hit Joe in the weeks after the event. At TNA's Hard Justice PPV event on August10, A.J. Styles fought Angle in a Last Man Standing match, which he won after injuring Angle's neck in the contest. After the bout, Styles attacked Angle's injured neck, making the injury more severe in the storyline until Sting attacked Styles to prevent the assault from continuing. On the August14 episode of TNA's television program TNA Impact!, Sting explained that both Joe and Styles had been disrespectful and violent in their current rivalries and matches. He stated that his actions were to end that type of behavior between the younger wrestlers and the veteran wrestlers.|$|E
5|$|Other, {{more recent}} {{studies suggest that}} the idea of object {{permanence}} may not be an innate function of young children. While, in reference to Piaget's theory, it has been established that young children develop object permanence as they age, the question arises: does this occur because of a particular perception that already existed within the minds of these young children? Is object permanence really an inbred response to the neural pathways developing in young minds? Studies suggest that a multitude of variables may be responsible for the development of object permanence rather than a natural <b>talent</b> <b>of</b> infants. Evidence suggests that infants use a variety of cues while studying an object and their perception of the object's permanence can be tested without physically hiding the object. Rather, the object is occluded, slightly obstructed, from the infants view and they are left only other visual cues, such as examining the object from different trajectories. It was also found that the longer an infant focuses on an object may be due to detected discontinuities in their visual field, or the flow of events, with which the infant has become familiar.|$|E
5|$|With Hagrid's help, Harry {{prepares for}} and {{undertakes}} {{his first year}} of study at Hogwarts. As Harry begins to explore the magical world, the reader is introduced {{to many of the}} primary locations used throughout the series. Harry meets most of the main characters and gains his two closest friends: Ron Weasley, a fun-loving member of an ancient, large, happy, but poor wizarding family, and Hermione Granger, a gifted, bright, and hardworking witch of non-magical parentage. Harry also encounters the school's potions master, Severus Snape, who displays a conspicuously deep and abiding dislike for him, the rich brat Draco Malfoy whom he quickly makes enemies with, and the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, Quirinus Quirrell, who later turns out to be allied with Lord Voldemort. He also discovers a <b>talent</b> <b>of</b> flying on broomsticks and is recruited for his house's Quidditch team, a sport in the wizarding world where players fly on broomsticks. The first book concludes with Harry's second confrontation with Lord Voldemort, who, in his quest to regain a body, yearns to gain the power of the Philosopher's Stone, a substance that bestows everlasting life and turns any metal into pure gold.|$|E
