5|$|Cover art was {{initially}} mostly by Alex Schomburg. Other artists, including Ed Emshwiller, Kelly Freas, and Mel Hunter, contributed covers; and {{towards the end}} <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> sequence of covers by Virgil Finlay. Finlay also contributed much of the interior art {{in the last six}} issues; generally Great American did not credit the artists, but along with Finlay, Emshwiller and John Giunta were featured.|$|E
5|$|The {{territorial}} era of Minnesota {{lasted from}} the Louisiana Purchase in 1803 to Minnesota's achieving statehood in 1858. The Minnesota Territory itself was formed only in 1849 but {{the area had}} a rich history well before this. Though <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> history of European presence in the area before 19th century, {{it was during the}} 19th century that the United States began to establish a firm presence in what would become Minnesota.|$|E
5|$|The Tennant Canal was a {{development}} of the Glan-y-wern Canal, which was built across Crymlyn Bog to transport coal from a colliery on its northern edge to a creek on the River Neath called Red Jacket Pill. It closed after 20 years, but was enlarged and extended by George Tennant in 1818, to provide a navigable link from the River Neath to the River Tawe at Swansea docks. In order to increase trade, he built an extension to Aberdulais basin, where it linked to the Neath Canal. The extension was built without an act of Parliament and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> delay while Tennant attempted to resolve a dispute with a landowner over the routing of the canal. Once opened, much of the Neath traffic used the Tennant Canal, as Swansea provided better facilities for transferring cargo to ships.|$|E

5|$|<b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> {{history of}} {{painting}} candlelit scenes in Western art, although as Wright had {{not at this}} date travelled abroad, there remains uncertainty as to what paintings he might {{have seen in the}} original, as opposed to prints. Nicolson, who made studies of both Wright and other candlelight painters such as the 17th-century Utrecht Caravaggisti, thought their paintings, among the largest in the style, those most likely to have influenced Wright. However Judy Egerton wonders if he could have seen any, preferring as influences the far smaller works of the Leiden fijnschilder Godfried Schalcken (1643–1706), whose reputation was much greater in the early 18th century than subsequently. He had worked in England from 1692 to 1697, and several of his paintings can be placed in English collections in Wright's day.|$|E
5|$|<b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> {{string of}} {{conflicts}} with Tibet over territories in the Tarim Basin between 670–692, and in 763 the Tibetans even captured {{the capital of}} China, Chang'an, for fifteen days during the An Shi Rebellion. In fact, {{it was during this}} rebellion that the Tang withdrew its western garrisons stationed in what is now Gansu and Qinghai, which the Tibetans then occupied along with the territory of what is now Xinjiang. Hostilities between the Tang and Tibet continued until they signed a formal peace treaty in 821. The terms of this treaty, including the fixed borders between the two countries, are recorded in a bilingual inscription on a stone pillar outside the Jokhang temple in Lhasa.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{emergence}} of the ice trade of the 19th century, snow and ice had been collected and stored to use in the summer months {{in various parts of the}} world, but never on a large scale. In the Mediterranean and in South America, for example, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> history of collecting ice from the upper slopes of the Alps and the Andes during the summer months and traders transporting this down into the cities. Similar trading practices had grown up in Mexico during the colonial period. The Russians collected ice along the Neva River during the winter months for consumption in Saint Petersburg for many years. Wealthy Europeans began to build ice houses to store ice gathered on their local estates during the winter from the 16th century onwards; the ice was used to cool drinks or food for the wealthiest elites.|$|E

25|$|The {{military}} forces in the Dutch East Indies were controlled by the governor and {{were not part of}} the regular Dutch army.

25|$|The {{mobilization}} of multiple sectors within China occurred over a 15-year period when <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> series of educational workshops, conferences, collaborative projects, and networking between members {{at a number}} of levels of the government and administrative structural hierarchies. At local, national, and international forums, officials from many sectors were able to meet one another, share a common knowledge base, and debate the appropriateness of different interventions. Personal relationships were formed that facilitated the consideration and examination of previously unrecognised policy options for detection, prevention, and care. In a non-linear process, a consensus slowly evolved, identifying policy options.|$|E
25|$|After Attlee and Greenwood left, Chamberlain asked whom {{he should}} {{recommend}} to the King as his successor. The {{version of events}} given by Churchill is that Chamberlain's preference for Halifax was obvious (Churchill implies that the spat between Churchill and the Labour benches the previous night {{had something to do}} with that); <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> silence which Halifax eventually broke by saying he did not believe he could lead the government effectively as a member of the House of Lords instead of the House of Commons. Churchill's version gets the date wrong, and he fails to mention the presence of David Margesson, the government Chief Whip.|$|E
25|$|In 1894 {{while he}} was living in Glendalough, he bought a Dublin Bay Water Wag, a 13-foot type of sailing boat usually sailed in Dun Laoghaire, pear-shaped with a single gaff-rigged sail. He sailed this boat on Lough Dan, close to Glendalough, and he and his brother Henry used to take friends for a sail in the Water Wag. Bigger and better boats followed: by 1895 he was taking the half-deck Marguerite across the Channel and in 1897 <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> cruise to the Frisian Islands, Norderney and the Baltic with Henry in the thirty-foot cutter Vixen: a voyage he {{repeated}} in the following spring.|$|E

25|$|That {{evening he}} played {{what he had}} written so far to {{a small group of}} Leningrad musicians. After Shostakovich {{finished}} the first movement, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> silence. An air-raid warning sounded. No one moved. Everyone wanted to hear the piece again. The composer excused himself to take his family to the nearest air-raid shelter. When he returned, he repeated the first movement, which then was followed by the next movement for his guests. Their reaction encouraged him to start that night on the Adagio. He completed this movement on 29 September in the city. Shostakovich and his family were then evacuated to Moscow on 1 October 1941. They moved to Kuybyshev (now Samara) on 22 October, where the symphony was finally completed.|$|E
25|$|Further {{confusion}} {{arose in}} 1980–1981, when <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> {{debate in the}} pages of Nature about the scientific status of the theory of evolution. Specifically, the argument was on the factors influencing and nature of the unit of selection in the genome, with one side positing natural selection, and the other, neutral mutation. Neither of the parties seriously doubted that the theory was both scientific and, according to current scientific knowledge, true. Some participants objected to statements that appeared to present the theory of evolution as an absolute dogma, however, rather than as a hypothesis that so far has performed very well, and both sides quoted Popper in support of their positions. Evolution critics such as Phillip E. Johnson took {{this as an opportunity to}} declare that the theory of evolution was unscientific.|$|E
