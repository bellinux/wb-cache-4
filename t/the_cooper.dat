5|$|The first {{newspaper}} {{published in}} Cooper was the Delta Courier in 1873. The newspaper, published by Bob Michiel, ran weekly until the mid-1890s. Around {{the time the}} publishing of the Delta Courier ended, the People's Cause newspaper began running weekly. This eventually stopped running; however, <b>The</b> <b>Cooper</b> Review began running weekly in 1982. <b>The</b> <b>Cooper</b> Review, run by Jim and Sally Butler, is still published.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, a Minnesota {{resident}} named Lyle Christiansen {{watched a}} television documentary about <b>the</b> <b>Cooper</b> hijacking and {{became convinced that}} his late brother Kenneth was D. B. Cooper. After repeated futile attempts to convince first the FBI, and then the author and film director Nora Ephron (who he hoped would make a movie about the case), he contacted a private investigator in New York City. In 2010 the detective, Skipp Porteous, published a book postulating that Christiansen was the hijacker. In early 2011 an episode of the History series Brad Meltzer's Decoded also summarized the circumstantial evidence linking Christiansen to <b>the</b> <b>Cooper</b> case.|$|E

5|$|While the British 29th Infantry Brigade and the PVA 149th Division fought at {{the east}} of Koyang, the US 25th Infantry Division of the US I Corps started to {{withdraw}} on the left flank of 29th Infantry Brigade. The evacuation plan called for a coordinated withdrawal between the US 25th Infantry Division and the British 29th Infantry Brigade {{in order to prevent}} the Chinese from infiltrating the UN rear areas, but the heavy fighting soon made the coordination between American and British units impossible. After the US 27th Infantry Regiment of the 25th Infantry Division formed the rear guard of the US I Corps, the 25th Infantry Division and the 29th Infantry Brigade were ordered to evacuate at 15:00 on January 3. The 25th Infantry Division retreated with little difficulties, but the withdrawal of the 29th Infantry Brigade did not start until after dark at 21:30. With the road completely open between the American rear guards and the British units, the 446th Regiment of the PVA 149th Division infiltrated UN rear areas and set up an ambush against 1RUR and <b>the</b> <b>Cooper</b> Force of the 8th King's Royal Irish Hussars. 1RUR and <b>the</b> <b>Cooper</b> Force were then quickly overran by Chinese soldiers, most of whom were completely unarmed. The Chinese had also attacked the Cromwell tanks of <b>the</b> <b>Cooper</b> Force with bundle grenades and Bangalore torpedoes, setting several on fire. In the desperate hand on hand fighting that followed, although 100 soldiers from 1RUR managed to escape the trap under the command of Major J.K.H. Shaw, Major Blake of 1RUR and Captain D. Astley-Cooper of <b>the</b> <b>Cooper</b> Force were killed in action, while another 208 British soldiers were missing in action, most of whom were captured by the Chinese. The US 27th Infantry Regiment tried to rescue the trapped British troops, but Brodie stopped the rescue in order to prevent more unnecessary losses.|$|E

5|$|While {{there is}} no {{reasonable}} doubt that McCoy committed the Denver hijacking, the FBI does not consider him a suspect in <b>the</b> <b>Cooper</b> case because of significant mismatches in age and description; a level of skydiving skill well above that thought to be possessed by the hijacker; and credible evidence that McCoy was in Las Vegas {{on the day of}} the Portland hijacking, and at home in Utah the day after, having Thanksgiving dinner with his family.|$|E
5|$|At 5:32 pm CST (2332 UTC), a {{supercell}} thunderstorm {{produced a}} multiple-vortex tornado in Southaven, Mississippi.

In the nearby Carriage Hill subdivision, several homes sustained minor damage as well. The tornado rapidly intensified to EF2 strength as it crossed {{the intersection of}} Stateline Road and Airways Boulevard, destroying three warehouse buildings. One of the buildings destroyed was <b>the</b> <b>Cooper</b> Lighting Plant, and a gas station in this area was damaged as well. Numerous trees and power poles were also downed in Southaven.|$|E
5|$|In {{its first}} season of rugby, Stanford {{retained}} {{head football coach}} James F. Lanagan as its first rugby coach. Lanagan had coached the football team for three years, including an undefeated 1905 season. With no experience playing or coaching rugby, Lanagan initially offered his resignation, but Stanford insisted he stay on, so he traveled to Vancouver, British Columbia to study the sport. Stanford won its first five games, including two wins over a visiting club team from Vancouver. As winners of the first Big Game against California played as rugby, Stanford competed against Vancouver-area club teams for <b>the</b> <b>Cooper</b> Keith Trophy, losing two games and tying one.|$|E
50|$|A man appears by {{the edge}} of the forest {{surrounding}} the village and advises <b>the</b> <b>Coopers</b> to leave <b>the</b> island as soon as possible, and to take him with them. Identifying himself as Amos Dulaney, a professor of geology, he explains that the island is not safe. Before <b>the</b> <b>Coopers</b> can respond, however, MacKenzie and the village's armed guards confront Dulaney, and MacKenzie has Dulaney taken away, stating that he has been hit by Moro-Kunda. That night, <b>the</b> <b>Coopers</b> decide to discreetly explore the forest, and find Dulaney's body, displaying the same symptoms that were found on Tommy.|$|R

5|$|In late April 2013 Earl Cossey, {{the owner}} of the skydiving school that {{furnished}} the four parachutes given to Cooper, was found dead in his home in Woodinville, a suburb of Seattle.

5|$|Since its founding, Cooper {{has served}} as the center of attractions for Delta County. The city became host to several small schools and churches. In 1955, the {{construction}} of Cooper Lake was authorized. In 1986, major work on the lake began, and the lake was finished in 1991. The lake is now the most popular tourist attraction in the area. Boating, swimming, and fishing are available at Cooper Lake. The main fish stocked in the lake are catfish, largemouth bass, and crappie. Along the north shore of the lake is the Doctor's Creek Unit of Cooper Lake State Park. The park contains several picnic areas, campgrounds and a large swimming area on Cooper Lake. The park also contains several hiking and equestrian trails. On {{the eastern edge of the}} lake near <b>the</b> <b>Cooper</b> Lake Dam is the Wildlife Observation Deck, a large birdwatching platform. Along the west and northwest shores of the lake is <b>the</b> <b>Cooper</b> Wildlife Management Area. The park was constructed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and protects four unique habitat types. These are wetland, Blackland Prairie, Upland Post Oak, and Bottomland Hardwood. The park contains several hiking trails, as well as birdwatching stations and wildlife viewing areas. The park allows fishing and hunting to visitors if they have a proper license.|$|E

5|$|Bruce McLaren Motor Racing {{was founded}} in 1963; Bruce McLaren was a factory driver for <b>the</b> <b>Cooper</b> motor racing team which competed in Formula One, {{the highest level of}} {{international}} single-seater competition. For two years the McLaren team had raced in the Tasman Series, a competition for single-seaters that ran during the Formula One world championship off-season, and in various sports car races. Bruce McLaren continued to race in Grands Prix (i.e. Formula One championship races) for Cooper, but by 1965 the team's performances were worsening and so he decided to build his own Formula One car to race the following year. Despite being a skilled engineer himself, McLaren enlisted Robin Herd to design the car. Herd was an aerospace engineer who had previously worked at the National Gas Turbine Establishment (NGTE) where he had been involved with the Concorde project. In September 1965 the M2A development car was completed. Powered by a 4.5 litre Oldsmobile V8 engine, it was used to test Herd's design ideas and Firestone's tyres. With McLaren still employed by Cooper, the McLaren team initially denied that they were building a Formula One competitor, claiming that the M2A was purely a tyre test bed.|$|E
