5|$|In January 2012, Denise Fox (Diane Parish) gives Marsden {{a letter}} incriminating Phil {{in the death}} of a {{homeless}} man, who died when he torched the car lot in an insurance scam in 1994; she adds that Phil also murdered Stella Crawford (Sophie Thompson), and Marsden thanks Denise for the information. Marsden arrives in Walford and begins trailing Phil. She asks Denise not to tell Phil that she is in town, wanting to ensure Phil's imprisonment. Marsden then targets Phil's son Ben (Joshua Pascoe), interviewing him about Stella's death. Ben was abused by Stella and finds Marsden's questions distressing; however, she continues to press him. After a falling-out with Phil Ben changes his statement, telling Marsden that Phil told Stella <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> <b>off</b> a building or he would push her. Marsden then arrests Phil for murder, and Ben reveals he was stalking him. She informs Phil's partner, Shirley, that he has been charged with Stella's murder. Ben pleads with Marsden to keep his statement a secret from the Mitchells, but she tells him he must accept that his father will learn about Ben's involvement in his arrest eventually. After discovering Ben's lies about Phil, Ian then passes this information on to Marsden and Ben is arrested. On the day of Phil's release he helps Ben hide his involvement in Heather's murder; Marsden tells Phil at the police station she will contact him about Ben's accusations. The charges against Ben are dropped; Marsden visits Phil, taunting him that he will eventually slip up, and suggests that Ben may ultimately bring Phil down.|$|E

25|$|Vaginismus {{has been}} {{classified}} by Lamont {{according to the}} severity of the condition. Lamont describes four degrees of vaginismus: In first degree vaginismus, the patient has spasm of the pelvic floor that can be relieved with reassurance. In second degree, the spasm is present but maintained throughout the pelvis even with reassurance. In third degree, the patient elevates the buttocks to avoid being examined. In fourth degree vaginismus (also known as grade 4 vaginismus), the most severe form of vaginismus, the patient elevates the buttocks, retreats and tightly closes the thighs to avoid examination. Pacik expanded the Lamont classification to include a fifth degree in which the patient experiences a visceral reaction such as sweating, hyperventilation, palpitations, trembling, shaking, nausea, vomiting, losing consciousness, wanting <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> <b>off</b> the table, or attacking the doctor. The Lamont classification continues to be used to the present and allows for a common language among researchers and therapists.|$|E
25|$|The {{helicopter}} {{attack and}} the roadblocks were a response by the CJNG for the attempted capture of El Mencho. The government also {{claimed that the}} violence in Jalisco was a reaction to Operation Jalisco. According to sources from the PF, prior to the helicopter attack, El Mencho was spotted in Tonaya, Jalisco, which prompted a law enforcement offensive to apprehend him. His gunmen defended him from the PF {{and he was able}} to escape. The helicopter that was shot down was equipped with parachutes that were intended to be used by the officers on board. They were planning <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> <b>off</b> and continue their operation on foot with the goal of capturing El Mencho. Unconfirmed federal and state sources said that someone within law enforcement notified the CJNG of the surprise operation against him. They said the government confirmed this through wiretapping. The sources stated that the CJNG had detected unusual law enforcement activity in the area where El Mencho was hiding, but they did not have clear information on the operative against him until it was leaked by an insider. When the roadblocks occurred, rumors circulated that El Mencho was arrested by security forces. Law enforcement confirmed that they were close to capturing El Mencho, but did not confirm him among the detainees arrested that day. The government considers El Mencho the main suspect and mastermind of the May 1 attacks.|$|E
