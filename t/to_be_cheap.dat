25|$|During the 1980s {{private housing}} was {{developed}} in Docklands which with some minor exceptions {{were the first to}} be built in the area. Soon many people from outside the area saw the opportunity of buying a house close to the city at what appeared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>cheap</b> prices. On many of the developments, local council tenants were given first opportunities to buy at discounted prices, but this led to a number of abuses. Then again in the late 1990s, London had a huge house-price boom. By encouraging the development of attractive waterside apartments along the River Thames and the old docks, the LDDC brought new, middle-class residents into the area, closely followed by shops, restaurants and bars.|$|E
25|$|Canadian refineries, {{outside of}} the major oil {{producing}} provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan, were originally built {{on the assumption that}} light and medium crude oil would continue <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>cheap</b> in the long term, and that imported oil would be cheaper than oil sands production. With new oil sands production coming on production at lower prices than international oil, market price imbalances have ruined the economics of refineries which could not process it. Most of the Canadian oil refineries which closed were in the oil deficient regions of Quebec, the Atlantic Provinces, and British Columbia where they had no access to cheaper domestic Canadian production. They also were not designed to refine the heavier grades which comprised most new Canadian production. These refinery closures were part of an international trend, since about a dozen refineries in Europe, the Caribbean and along the US east coast have shut down recent years due to sharp increases in the cost of imported oil and declining domestic demand for fuel.|$|E
500|$|As {{with the}} other two primary races, the Zerg are the subject of a full {{campaign}} in each of the series' real-time strategy video games. Zerg units are designed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>cheap</b> and fast to produce, encouraging players to overwhelm their opponents with sheer numerical advantage. Since the release of StarCraft the Zerg have become a video gaming icon, described by PC Gamer UK as [...] "the best race in strategy history". The term [...] "Zerg Rush" [...] or [...] "zerging" [...] has entered video gaming lexicon to describe sacrificing economic development in favour of using many low-cost fast/weak units to rush and overwhelm an enemy by attrition or sheer numbers. The tactic is infamous, with most experienced real-time strategy players being familiar with the tactic in one form or another.|$|E

2500|$|After all-jet {{training}} program trials during the 1950s, {{a variety of}} propeller-driven aircraft was used for pilot training during the 1960s and 1970s. In the 1970s, oil prices rapidly increased {{with the price of}} a crude oil barrel having risen from $3 in 1973 to $36 by 1980, deflating the Brazilian economy. At that time, the Brazilian Air Force operated the J69-powerered Cessna T-37C, which was a 1950s design and following the 1970s energy crisis, became expensive to operate. [...] In 1977, the Brazilian Air Force expressed a desire to replace the T-37, specifying that the replacement would need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>cheap</b> to operate, designed to closely imitate the characteristics of jet aircraft and should have ejection seats.|$|E
2500|$|The Chilton D.W.1 was {{designed}} and built on the Chilton Lodge estate at Leverton near Hungerford in Berkshire in early 1937 by two ex de Havilland Technical School students who formed Chilton Aircraft Limited for the purpose. The aircraft was intended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>cheap</b> to build and operate, yet have an exceptional performance on low power. This was derived from its aerodynamically clean design with an all-wood airframe with plywood skin. Only the control surfaces and {{the trailing edge of}} the wing behind the rear spar were fabric covered. [...] The wing also carried trailing edge split flaps. [...] The undercarriage was enclosed in trouser fairings and a cabin top could be fitted.|$|E

2500|$|Rover's U.S. Willys Jeep-inspired Land Rover 4x4 {{launched}} in 1948 {{proved to be}} a worldwide success. Although only intended to be a post-war stopgap, within two years it was vastly outselling the company's principal line of semi-luxury cars. The Land Rover had been designed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>cheap,</b> simple to manufacture, and suitable for hard work in rural terrain, with minimal concessions toward comfort. [...] On early vehicles, the canvas hood, passenger seats and even doors were optional extras. Rover shortly realized that a market existed for an off-road capable vehicle with more amenities. In 1949 the Land Rover station wagon was released, with a coach-built wood-framed body by Tickford. However, the high price of adding such car-like features as seven seats, floor carpets, a heater, a one-piece windscreen sresulted in fewer than 700 being sold before being dropped in 1951.|$|E
2500|$|Secondary gliders {{were meant}} to be used by student pilots after an {{introduction}} to flight on very simple primary gliders. [...] Both types needed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>cheap</b> to build, given the difficult financial position of many Germans after World War I and also simple enough that skilled amateur builders, both within and without gliding clubs, could successfully construct them from plans. [...] The primary/secondary glider concept took shape shortly after the absorption of the Martens gliding school on the Wasserkuppe into Rhön-Rossitten Gesellschaft (RRG) at the end of 1925. Martens chief instructor Fritz Stamer and Alexander Lippisch were brought together to produce two such gliders and within a few days the Zögling (...) and the Prufling designs were complete. Some parts, for example the wings {{and to a lesser extent}} the horizontal tails, of the two aircraft were similar.|$|E

It appeared that if you wanted <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>cheap</b> you could travel with those coupons, and Lottie did not wish <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>cheap,</b> or {{have anything to do with}} those who were. The Kentons had always held up their heads, and if Ellen had chosen to disgrace them with Bittridge, Dick had made it all right, and she at least was not going to do anything that she would be ashamed of.

We were but eleven to-day. We are now in all nine lords and ten commoners. The Duke of Beaufort had the confidence to propose his brother-in-law, the Earl of Danby,(23) to be a member; but I opposed it so warmly that it was waived. Danby is not above twenty, and we will have no more boys, and we want but two to make up our number. I stayed till eight, and then we all went away soberly.
