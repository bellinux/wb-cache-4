40|$|Subsonic and {{supersonic}} aircraft concepts proposed through NASA s Fundamental Aeronautics Program have multiple engines mounted near one another. Engine configurations with multiple jets introduce an asymmetry to the azimuthal directivity {{of the jet}} noise. Current system noise predictions add the jet noise from each <b>jet</b> incoherently, therefore, <b>twin</b> <b>jets</b> are estimated by adding 3 EPNdB to the far-field noise radiated from a single <b>jet.</b> <b>Twin</b> <b>jet</b> effects {{have the ability to}} increase or decrease the radiated noise to different azimuthal observation locations. Experiments have shown that <b>twin</b> <b>jet</b> effects are reduced with forward flight and increasing spacings. The current experiment investigates the impact of spacing, and flight effects on airport noise for <b>twin</b> <b>jets.</b> Estimating the jet noise radiated from <b>twin</b> <b>jets</b> as that of a single jet plus 3 EPNdB may be sufficient for horizontal <b>twin</b> <b>jets</b> with an s/d of 4. 4 and 5. 5, where s is the center-to-center spacing and d is the jet diameter. However, up to a 3 EPNdB error could be present for jet spacings with an s/d of 2. 6 and 3. 2...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} first observation, {{analysis}} and modeling of solar coronal <b>twin</b> <b>jets,</b> which occurred after a preceding jet. Detailed {{analysis on the}} kinetics of the preceding jet reveals its blowout-jet nature, which resembles the one studied in Liu et al. 2014. However the erupting process and kinetics of the <b>twin</b> <b>jets</b> appear {{to be different from}} the preceding one. In lack of the detailed information on the magnetic fields in the <b>twin</b> <b>jet</b> region, we instead use a numerical simulation using a three-dimensional (3 D) MHD model as described in Fang et al. 2014, and find that in the simulation a pair of <b>twin</b> <b>jets</b> form due to reconnection between the ambient open fields and a highly twisted sigmoidal magnetic flux which is the outcome of the further evolution of the magnetic fields following the preceding blowout jet. Based on the similarity between the synthesized and observed emission we propose this mechanism as a possible explanation for the observed <b>twin</b> <b>jets.</b> Combining our observation and simulation, we suggest that with continuous energy transport from the subsurface convection zone into the corona, solar coronal <b>twin</b> <b>jets</b> could be generated in the same fashion addressed above.

40|$|Subsonic and {{supersonic}} aircraft concepts proposed by NASAs Fundamental Aeronautics Program have integrated propulsion systems with asymmetric nozzles. The asymmetry in the exhaust of these propulsion systems creates asymmetric flow and acoustic fields. The flow asymmetries investigated {{in the current}} study are from two parallel round, 2 : 1, and 8 : 1 aspect ratio rectangular jets at the same nozzle conditions. The flow field was measured with streamwise and cross-stream particle image velocimetry (PIV). A large dataset of single and <b>twin</b> <b>jet</b> flow field measurements was acquired at subsonic jet conditions. The effects of <b>twin</b> <b>jet</b> spacing and forward flight were investigated. For round, 2 : 1, and 8 : 1 rectangular <b>twin</b> <b>jets</b> at their closest spacings, turbulence levels between the two jets decreased due to enhanced jet mixing at near static conditions. When the flight Mach number was increased to 0. 25, the flow around the <b>twin</b> <b>jet</b> model created a velocity deficit between the two nozzles. This velocity deficit diminished the effect of forward flight causing an increase in turbulent kinetic energy relative to a single jet. Both of these <b>twin</b> <b>jet</b> flow field effects decreased with increasing <b>twin</b> <b>jet</b> spacing relative to a single jet. These variations in turbulent kinetic energy correlate with changes in far-field sound pressure level...|$|R

40|$|The {{flow and}} heat {{transfer}} characteristics of <b>twin</b> turbulent slot <b>jets</b> impinging on planar smooth and rough surfaces are examined using a {{computational fluid dynamics}} model. The interaction between jets lowers the heat transfer performance of each jet in the zone where the wall jets collide. A single jet performs better than the equivalent <b>twin</b> <b>jet.</b> The average heat transfer under <b>twin</b> <b>jets</b> which are injected alternately so that {{each one of the}} pair of jets behaves like a single jet, is found to be better than <b>twin</b> <b>jets</b> issuing simultaneously. It is proposed that alternating jet flows in the <b>twin</b> <b>jet</b> arrangement is a simple novel way to enhance thermal performance of jet pairs. Along with parametric studies of the key flow and geometric parameters, effects of large temperature differences between the jet air and the target surface being heated, and model roughness of the target surface are also evaluated. Interestingly, roughness can lower the heat transfer performance in the impingement zone as the fluid can get trapped in the valleys in the rough surface...|$|R

40|$|Pulsating <b>twin</b> <b>jets</b> {{mechanism}} (PTJM) {{was developed}} in the present work to study the effect of pulsating <b>twin</b> <b>jets</b> mixing region on the enhancement of heat transfer.

40|$|Many subsonic and {{supersonic}} aircraft concepts proposed by NASA's Fundamental Aeronautics Program have asymmetric, integrated propulsion systems. The asymmetries in the exhaust of these propulsion systems create an asymmetric acoustic field. The asymmetries investigated {{in the current}} study are from <b>twin</b> <b>jets</b> and rectangular nozzles. Each effect produces its own variation of the acoustic field. An empirical model was developed to predict the acoustic field variation from round <b>twin</b> <b>jets</b> with <b>twin</b> <b>jet</b> spacing from 2. 6 to 5. 6, where s is the center-to-center spacing over the jet diameter. The model includes parameters to account for the effects of <b>twin</b> <b>jet</b> spacing, jet static temperature ratio, flight Mach number, frequency, and observer angle (both polar and azimuthal angles). The model was then applied to twin 2 : 1 and 8 : 1 aspect ratio nozzles to determine the impact of jet aspect ratio. For the round and rectangular jets, the use of the model reduces the average magnitude of the error over all frequencies, observation angles, and jet spacings by approximately 0. 5 dB when compared against the assumption of adding two jets incoherently...|$|R

Further downstream in the far-field, results from the SBS <b>twin</b> <b>jets</b> show a most dominating larger CRVP accompanied with a smaller inner vortex pair.
