The large increase in ion thermal energy (from 10 eV up to 200 eV) is attributed to the direct conversion of the magnetic energy into the unmagnetized ion population.

40|$|Extragalactic jets are visualized as dynamic erruptive events {{modelled}} by timedependent magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations. The jet structure {{comes through}} the temporally self-similar solutions in two-dimensional axisymmetric spherical geometry. The two-dimensional magnetic field is solved in the finite plasma pressure regime, or finite β regime, and it is described by an equation where plasma pressure {{plays the role of}} an eigenvalue. This allows a structure of magnetic lobes in space, among which the polar axis lobe is strongly peaked in intensity and collimated in angular spread comparing to the others. For this reason, the polar lobe overwhelmes the other lobes, and a jet structure arises in the polar direction naturally. Furthermore, within each magnetic lobe in space, there are small secondary regions with closed two-dimensional field lines embedded along this primary lobe. In these embedded magnetic <b>toroids,</b> <b>plasma</b> pressure and mass density are much higher accordingly. These are termed as secondary plasmoids. The magnetic field lines in these secondary plasmoids circle in alternating sequence such that adjacent plasmoids have opposite field lines. In particular, along the polar primary lobe, such periodic plasmoid structure happens to be compatible with radio observations where islands of high radio intensities are mapped.

50|$|When {{discussing}} {{weapons in}} science fiction, a plasma weapon {{is a type}} of raygun that fires a stream, bolt(s), pulse or <b>toroid</b> of <b>plasma</b> (i.e. very hot, very energetic excited matter). The primary damage mechanism of these fictional weapons is usually thermal transfer; it typically causes serious burns, and often immediate death of living creatures, and melts or evaporates other materials. In certain fiction, plasma weapons may also have a significant kinetic energy component, that is to say the ionized material is projected with sufficient momentum to cause some secondary impact damage in addition to causing high thermal damage. In some fictions, like Star Wars, plasma is highly effective against mechanical targets such as droids. The ionized gas disrupts their systems.|$|R

2500|$|As the {{secondary}} coil's energy (and output voltage) continue to increase, larger pulses of displacement current further ionize and heat {{the air at}} the point of initial breakdown. This forms a very electrically conductive [...] "root" [...] of hotter plasma, called a leader, that projects outward from the <b>toroid.</b> The <b>plasma</b> within the leader is considerably hotter than a corona discharge, and is considerably more conductive. In fact, its properties are similar to an electric arc. The leader tapers and branches into thousands of thinner, cooler, hair-like discharges (called streamers). The streamers look like a bluish 'haze' at the ends of the more luminous leaders. The streamers transfer charge between the leaders and toroid to nearby space charge regions. The displacement currents from countless streamers all feed into the leader, helping to keep it hot and electrically conductive.|$|R

The presence of the liquid metal layer or first wall serves to prevent neutron damage to {{the walls of the}} toroid. A poloidal current in the liquid metal layer is oriented so that it flows {{in the same direction as}} the current in a series of external magnets used to confine the plasma. This current alignment results in the liquid metal being forced against the wall of the toroid.

50|$|Shiva Star {{was also}} used to develop an {{experimental}} weapon known as MARAUDER for the SDI effort between 1989 and 1995. The idea {{appears to have been}} to create compact <b>toroids</b> of high-density <b>plasma</b> that would be ejected from the device using a massive magnetic pulse. The plasma projectiles would be shot at a speed expected to be 3000 km/s in 1995 and 10,000 km/s (3% of the speed of light) by 2000. A shot has the energy of 5 pounds of TNT exploding. Doughnut-shaped rings of plasma and balls of lightning exploded with devastating thermal and mechanical effects when hitting their target and produced pulse of electromagnetic radiation that could scramble electronics, the energy would shower the interior of the target with high-energy x-rays that would potentially destroy the electronics inside. The tests cost a few million dollars a year. The project become classified and {{may or may not have}} been scrapped at some time after 1995 because of problems keeping the plasma projectiles stable for the distances required by orbital weaponry.|$|R
40|$|Annular field {{reversed}} configurations (AFRC) plasma devices produce <b>plasma</b> <b>toroids,</b> {{which can}} be ejected (translated) at high velocity. This research proposes to investigate AFRC devices for space propulsion by measuring the translation properties of its plasmoid, including velocity, momentum, and efficiency. These measurements demonstrate how well AFRCs can operate as high power electric propulsion technology. The AFRC translation experiment will be constructed in MTU’s Ion Space Propulsion Lab, with the design aid of an annular electromagnetic launcher model and magnetic field modeling. The annular electromagnetic launcher model simplifies {{the motion of the}} plasmoid using circuit analysis to provide scaling laws for experimental design. These scaling laws, paired with magnetic field modeling, will identify a set of operating conditions and geometry for which translation of the plasmoid is possible. Experimental studies using these operating conditions and a variety of plasma probes will be used to collect data from a translating plasmoid. A time-of-flight array using triple probes and magnetic field probes will capture the average velocity, while a ballistic pendulum will measure its momentum. Efficiency of the process can then be estimated by comparing the final kinetic energy of the plasmoid to the energy initially stored in the capacitor. Finally, scaling laws adapted from the launcher model will be used a means for comparing AFRC devices to similar pulsed inductive plasma accelerators...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Annular field {{reversed}} configuration (AFRC) devices form annular <b>plasma</b> <b>toroids</b> {{between a}} pair of concentric cylindrical coils. This plasmoid remains detached from the external magnetic field {{so that it can}} be ejected from the coils, making AFRCs vi-able pulsed inductive plasma accelerators. Though numerous formation studies on AFRCs are available, no successful translation studies have been published. Michigan Technolog-ical University, in conjunction with the Air Force Research Laboratory, is investigating the translation of AFRCs as pulsed inductive plasma accelerators. The first step in this investigation is to develop an annular electromagnetic launcher model to study the basic translation characteristics of the device. The launcher model treats the plasmoid as a rigid conducting slug, accelerated out of the coils by a Lorentz force. It predicts coil and plasmoid currents, plasmoid trajectories, and acceleration efficiencies for various input con-ditions. The model has been optimized for peak acceleration efficiency using a combination of non-dimensional analysis, genetic algorithms, and gradient-based numerical optimization routines. A description of the model, explanation of the numerical optimization techniques, and preliminary results from the model are presented in this paper.
