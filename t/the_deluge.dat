5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>Deluge,</b> {{also known}} as The Forty-First Day, is a Symbolist oil {{painting}} by English artist George Frederic Watts, first exhibited as The Sun in an incomplete form in 1886 and completed in 1891. It shows {{a scene from the}} story of Noah's Flood, in which after 40 days of rain Noah opens the window of his Ark to see that the rain has stopped. Watts felt that modern society was in decline owing to a lack of moral values, and he often painted works on the topic of the Flood and its cleansing of the unworthy from the world. The painting {{takes the form of a}} stylised seascape, dominated by a bright sunburst breaking through clouds. Although this was a theme Watts had depicted previously in The Genius of Greek Poetry in 1878, After <b>the</b> <b>Deluge</b> took a radically different approach. With this painting he intended to evoke a monotheistic God in the act of creation, but avoid depicting the Creator directly.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>deluge</b> flooded 95,000automobiles and 73,000houses {{throughout}} Harris County. Tropical Storm Allison destroyed 2,744homes, leaving 30,000homeless with residential damages totaling to $1.76billion (2001USD, $2.05billion 2007USD). Residential neighborhoods {{inside and}} {{to the north of}} Interstate 610 were hardest hit. Additionally, five of the six bayou systems in downtown Houston were severely flooded. Four of them broke 100-year high-water records, causing excessive surface run-off.|$|E

5|$|Władysław IV's father, Sigismund III Vasa, {{grandson}} of Sweden's King Gustav I, had succeeded {{his father to}} the Swedish throne in 1592, only to be deposed in 1599 by his uncle, subsequently King Charles IX. This resulted in a long-standing feud, with the Polish kings of the House of Vasa claiming the Swedish throne. This led to the Polish–Swedish War of 1600–29 and later to <b>the</b> <b>Deluge</b> of 1655.|$|E
5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>Deluge</b> was {{exhibited}} in unfinished form in 1886 as The Sun at St Jude's Church, Whitechapel; Samuel Barnett, vicar of St Jude's, organised annual art exhibitions in east London {{in an effort}} to bring beauty into the lives of the poor; he had a close relationship with Watts, and regularly borrowed his works to display them to local residents. Following this exhibition Watts continued to work on the painting for a further five years.|$|E
5|$|Constitutional {{objections}} {{were raised}} in House debates as to whether both houses of Congress could constitutionally authorize admission of territories, rather than states. Moreover, if the Republic of Texas, a nation in its own right, were admitted as a state, its territorial boundaries, property relations (including slave property), debts and public lands would require a Senate-ratified treaty. Democrats were particularly uneasy about burdening the United States with $10 million in Texas debt, resenting <b>the</b> <b>deluge</b> of speculators, who had bought Texas bonds cheap and now lobbied Congress for the Texas House bill. House Democrats, at an impasse, relinquished the legislative initiative to the southern Whigs.|$|E

By midnight on June 9 nearly every freeway and major road in the city was under several feet of water, forcing hundreds of motorists to abandon their vehicles for higher ground. Eighteen-wheeled trucks were filmed floating down major freeways and highways, swept along by floodwaters.|$|E
5|$|Moisture {{from the}} {{remnants}} of Grace dropped heavy rainfall across central Indiana, including a record one-day total of 7inches (178mm) in Indianapolis, while other locations received over 9inches (228mm).

5|$|Sienkiewicz {{soon began}} writing the second volume of his Trilogy, Potop (<b>The</b> <b>Deluge).</b> It ran in The Word from December 1884 to September 1886.

After her death, {{he kept on}} traveling Europe, leaving his children with his late wife's parents, though he often returned to Poland, particularly staying for long periods in Warsaw and Kraków beginning in the 1890s. After his return to Warsaw in 1887, the third volume of his Trilogy appeared – Pan Wołodyjowski (Sir Michael) – running in The Word from May 1887 to May 1888. The Trilogy established Sienkiewicz as the most popular contemporary Polish writer.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>The</b> great <b>deluge</b> {{algorithm}} explores neighbouring solutions {{which are}} accepted {{if they are}} better than the best solution so far or if the detriment in quality is no larger than the current water level. In <b>the</b> original great <b>deluge</b> method, <b>the</b> water level decreases steadily in a linear fashion. In this paper, we conduct a computational study of {{a modified version of}} <b>the</b> great <b>deluge</b> algorithm in which the decay rate of the water level is non-linear. For this study, we apply <b>the</b> non-linear great <b>deluge</b> algorithm to difficult instances of the university course timetabling problem. The results presented here show that this algorithm performs very well compared to other methods proposed in the literature for this problem. More importantly, this paper aims to better understant the role of the non-linear decay rate on the behaviour of <b>the</b> non-linear great <b>deluge</b> approach. ...|$|R

5|$|His legend {{had begun}} growing even during his lifetime, as {{he became a}} hero of poems and songs. Few {{negative}} rumors about him, popular {{in the last few}} years of his life, survived after his death. During the period of Enlightenment in Poland he was written about by poets and writers such as Stanisław Potocki, Franciszek Karpiński, Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz and Franciszek Ksawery Dmowski. A biography by Michał Krajewski cemented his legend of a hero rescuing Poland from anarchy and invasion. That legend that became even stronger during the times of the partitions of Poland in the 19th century, where the artists of the Polish romanticism period used him as a symbol of patriotism, and a reminder of military successes. He appears in the poem Przedświt of Zygmunt Krasiński, but much more significant was his portrayal in The Trilogy of Henryk Sienkiewicz, particularly the second book, <b>The</b> <b>Deluge.</b>|$|E
5|$|However {{the series}} of power struggles between the lesser nobility (szlachta), the higher nobility (magnates), and elected kings, {{undermined}} citizenship values and gradually eroded the government's authority, ability to function and provide for national defense. The infamous liberum veto procedure was used to paralyze parliamentary proceedings beginning {{in the second half}} of the 17th century. After {{the series of}} devastating wars in the middle of the 17th century (most notably the Chmielnicki Uprising and <b>the</b> <b>Deluge),</b> Poland-Lithuania stopped being an influential player in the politics of Europe. During the wars the Commonwealth lost an estimated 1/3 of its population (higher losses than during World War II). Its economy and growth were further damaged by the nobility's reliance on agriculture and serfdom, which, combined with the weakness of the urban burgher class, delayed the industrialization of the country.|$|E

In 1692, Stefan Mikołaj Branicki, the son of Jan Klemens Branicki (Marshal of the Crown Court), obtained city rights for Białystok from King John III Sobieski. He constructed the Branicki Palace on the foundations of the castle of the Wiesiołowski family. In the second half of the eighteenth century the ownership of the city was inherited by Field Crown Hetman Jan Klemens Branicki. It was he who transformed the palace built by his father into a magnificent residence of a great noble.|$|E

5|$|Jamaica's {{infrastructure}} {{was devastated}} in <b>the</b> <b>deluge,</b> accounting {{for most of}} Nicole's damage to the island. More than 288,000residences were without power {{at the height of}} the storm due to downed electricity lines and poles. About 40 percent of the island's water supply had been disrupted at some point. Dozens of bridges experienced total collapse under the force of swollen rivers and creeks. In Kingston, many underpasses became totally inundated as the prolonged rain overwhelmed storm drains; the flooding that followed left many of the city's roads impassable. Destruction to the infrastructure was especially extensive in Westmoreland, Saint Elizabeth, and Hanover parishes, though overall, 543of the island's principle roads sustained at least some degree of damage. The total costs linked to the infrastructure neared J$20 billion (US$235.4million).|$|E
5|$|Matsya Purana tells a {{different}} story of Chamunda's origins. She with other matrikas was created by Shiva to help him kill the demon Andhakasura, who has an ability - like Raktabija - to generate from his dripping blood. Chamunda with the other matrikas drinks {{the blood of the}} demon ultimately helping Shiva kill him. Ratnakara, in his text Haravijaya, also describes this feat of Chamunda, but solely credits Chamunda, not the other matrikas of sipping the blood of Andhaka. Having drunk the blood, Chamunda's complexion changed to blood-red. The text further says that Chamunda does a dance of destruction, playing a musical instrument whose shaft is Mount Meru, the spring is the cosmic snake Shesha and gourd is the crescent moon. She plays the instrument during <b>the</b> <b>deluge</b> that drowns the world.|$|E
5|$|Over Georgia, {{the storm}} dropped heavy {{rainfall}} of 10inches (255mm) in 24hours in various locations. <b>The</b> <b>deluge</b> caused rivers to crest past their banks, including the Oconee River at Milledgeville which peaked at 33.7feet (10.3m). The rainfall, which was heaviest across the southwestern {{portion of the}} state, washed out several bridges and roads, and flooded many other roads. Georgia governor Roy Barnes {{declared a state of}} emergency for seven counties in the state. The storm also spawned two tornadoes. In South Carolina, Allison's outer bands produced 10tornadoes and several funnel clouds, though most only caused minor damage limited to a damaged courthouse, snapped trees and downed power lines. Allison produced from 12 to 16inches (305 to 406mm) of rainfall in North Carolina, closing nearly all roads in Martin County and damaging 25homes. The severe flooding washed out a bridge in eastern Halifax County and flooded numerous cars. Wet roads caused nine traffic accidents throughout the state.|$|E
