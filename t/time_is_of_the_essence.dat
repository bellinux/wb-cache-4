[...] Randolph hoped such a display would induce New England to submit to revisions of their charter from the Crown, rather than having it fully revoked. On August 3, 1683, Randolph wrote to Sir Leonine Jenkins, [...] "I am now informed that the H.M.S. Rose is already fitted out for the Bahamas with orders to call at Boston for 2 or 3 weeks on the way." [...] Randolph indicates that <b>time</b> <b>is</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>essence</b> and he is willing to travel with Phips or forego the frigate idea and embark on a merchantman. Randolph, along with his brother Bernard, were given passage and cabins on HMS Rose.|$|E
500|$|The Enterprise {{arrives at}} the planet Angel One, where its native {{population}} is run as an oligarchy, with women in the dominant position of power. The ship is looking for survivors from the shipwrecked freighter Odin, 7+ years after having been evacuated. The freighter was missing 3 escape pods and the only planet in range was Angel One. An away team consisting of Commander William Riker (Jonathan Frakes), Lt. Commander Data (Brent Spiner), Lt. Tasha Yar (Denise Crosby), and Counselor Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis) beam down to the surface. They attempt to negotiate with Beata (Karen Montgomery), the [...] "Elected One" [...] of the native inhabitants, to let them search for the survivors. <b>Time</b> <b>is</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>essence</b> however, as the Enterprise must travel to a Federation outpost near the Romulan Neutral Zone (where a group of Romulan Battlecruisers has been detected) {{as soon as they}} resolve their investigation into the Odin survivors.|$|E

2500|$|Torture is {{normally}} illegal, but in extreme circumstances and with {{orders from the}} Chief Judge they employ it (both physical and psychological), for example when <b>time</b> <b>is</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>essence,</b> due to the city being in severe danger (or the Justice Departments authority is).

The Judges covered this up, [...] "arresting" [...] them by faking heart attacks, strokes or whatever was realistic or convenient at that time and then told their next of kin they had died, with this they could do whatever they wanted to them. They also used torture on the leading democrats before the democratic march, such as keeping an elderly democrat awake all night and then releasing him without charge, knowing he would have to march all day the following day and making severe threats to another involving his young children.|$|E
