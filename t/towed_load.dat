5|$|M34 Prime Mover – M34 Prime Movers {{were simply}} M32B1 Recovery Vehicles without the towing cable and were just used for pulling towed {{artillery}} into place. It was typically reserved for pulling heavy artillery, {{such as the}} 240mm howitzer. It lacked any armament and had four seats for crew. The vehicle also had tail lights, electric outlets for stopping of <b>towed</b> <b>loads,</b> and multiple stowage ports. Production started in 1944 and ended in 1945.|$|R
50|$|The load was {{stored in}} two {{containers}} {{on either side}} of the vehicles, to keep the centre of gravity as low as possible, similar to loading the saddle bags of a mule. The locomotives had a similar design as the carriages. The first locomotive was battery operated, but it was not powerful enough to <b>tow</b> <b>loaded</b> trains. Therefore, seven conventional Fordson tractors and one Buda tractor were modified to build articulated monorail locomotives.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{introduced}} a testbed developed from a perspective of soil mechanics {{which not only}} focused on wheel design and optimization but also considered {{the elimination of the}} boundary effect caused by soil bin. Using this testbed, a series of experimental investigations were performed by changing the wheel rotational velocity, vertical load and <b>towed</b> <b>load.</b> Tracks were generated at a regular spacing as the wheel lugs enter and exit the soil periodically. It has been found that there is a relationship between the track length and wheel slip ratio regardless of different mechanical properties of soil. The wheel rotational velocity has little effect on the driving torque and sinkage. The <b>towed</b> <b>load</b> affects more on the driving torque than on the sinkage. However, the vertical load effects on the driving torque and sinkage are similar. The current models used for parameter estimations may not be appropriate for TJ- 1 lunar soil simulant which has a relatively high internal friction angle according to the experimental results. But the internal friction angle and cohesion can still be estimated with proper selection of shear deformation modulus using the model proposed by Li et al(2011) ...|$|E
40|$|Purpose of {{the paper}} – {{is to create a}} {{measuring}} complex, develop a methodology and carry out experimental investigations of curvilinear movement of the Belarus 1802 crawler tractor. The measuring complex and methodology for determination of kinematics and forced parameters of crawler tractor turning ability have been developed. Experimental investigations of curvilinear tractor movement have been carried out and they have shown that an increase in its movement speed leads to a decrease in its actual angular speed. It is explained by an increase in a radius of tractor’s turning. While increasing a speed difference of crawler a torque of a running track is increasing and a torque of a lagging track is decreasing and it even takes a negative value. Having a <b>towed</b> <b>load</b> of 20 kH a lagging track thrust force is also decreasing but it does not pass in the are of negative values, in other words, both tracks move in a traction mode. A minimal radius of tractor turning is 1. 42 m. Relative minimal kinematics radius of turning is 0. 89 m. The created measuring complex and developed methodology for investigations are transferred to Separate Design Bureau of the Republic Unitary Enterprise «Minsk Tractor Plant» and they are used for experimental investigations of crawler tractors.  </p...|$|E

50|$|In 1967 Tatra began {{production}} {{of one of}} its famous off-road trucks the T813 using its modular construction technology; the model incorporated the latest trends in commercial vehicle design such as cab-over-engine (COE) and wide profile tyres. It featured a new V12 engine and all military versions had a central tyre inflation/deflation system as standard equipment. The T813 was designed to <b>tow</b> <b>loads</b> up to 100 ton GCM and it was a familiar sight on the roads in Czechoslovakia hauling large often over-sized loads.|$|R
5000|$|Towing may be {{as simple}} as a tractor pulling a tree stump. The most {{familiar}} form is the transport of disabled or otherwise indisposed vehicles by a tow truck or [...] "wrecker." [...] Other familiar forms are the tractor-trailer combination, and cargo or leisure vehicles coupled via ball or pintle and gudgeon trailer-hitches to smaller trucks and cars. In the opposite extreme are extremely heavy duty tank recovery vehicles, and enormous ballast tractors involved in heavy hauling <b>towing</b> <b>loads</b> stretching into the millions of pounds.|$|R
60|$|It had {{now become}} {{evident that the}} army could not be rationed by a wagon train over the single narrow and almost impassable road between Milliken's Bend and Perkins' plantation. Accordingly six more steamers were {{protected}} as before, to run the batteries, and were loaded with supplies. They took twelve barges in <b>tow,</b> <b>loaded</b> also with rations. On {{the night of the}} 22d of April they ran the batteries, five getting through more or less disabled while one was sunk. About half the barges got through with their needed freight.|$|R

50|$|The Pinzgauer has {{a chassis}} design which {{contributes}} to its high mobility. It has a central tube chassis with a transaxle which distributes the weight more evenly, {{and keeps the}} centre of gravity as low as possible. The differentials are all sealed units and require minimal additional lubrication. The Pinzgauer also has portal axles like the Unimog to provide extra clearance over obstacles. The 710 4×4 was the more popular variant, but the Pinzgauer was designed {{to have a very}} capable 6×6 configuration from the start. The rear suspension {{on the back of the}} 6×6 712 is designed to provide maximum traction in the most demanding circumstances along with increasing its <b>towing,</b> <b>load</b> carrying, and off-road abilities.|$|R

40|$|The {{equations}} {{of motion}} for the coupled dynamics of a long flexible liferaft and fast rescue cracr in an irregular ocean wave are formulated in two dimensions using the methos of Kane and Levinson (1985). The flexible raft is modeled as spring-connected lumped masses and {{it is assumed that}} the motion normal to the wave surface is small and can be neglected, i. e. the bodies move along the propagating wave profile. The wave forces are applied using Morison's equation for bodies in accelerated flow. Wind and loads are similarly modeled using drag coefficients. The equations are solved numerically using the Runge-Kutta routine "ode 45 " of MATLAB.

50|$|In 1916 the Holyoke {{was sold}} to the Port Blakely Mill Company {{to be used for}} ship {{construction}} then being engaged in at Port Blakely by the Skinner and Eddy Corporation. In 1923 Skinner and Eddy sold Holyoke to the Bellingham Tug and Barge Company to be used to <b>tow</b> <b>loads</b> from Puget Sound to Alaska. In 1924 the vessel was equipped with wireless. In 1930 or 1931, the vessel was taken out of service. In 1940 Bellingham Tug and Barge Company sold the vessel to the Metal Conservation Corporation, a Seattle firm. The plan was to install a diesel engine in the hull and relocate the upper works to make room for materials to be salvaged from wrecks in Alaska waters. This never came through, and the hull was abandoned in Lake Union.|$|R
40|$|The {{torque and}} shaft speed (rpm) of an engine {{will be the}} same as the torque and rpm of the {{propeller}} it drives. The marine designer attempts to place this torque_rpm coincidence at a point that will be best by some criterion for the total propulsion plant, and that will be satisfactory for the individual components under all operating conditions. This is the "matching" problem. Basic principles of driver-load relationships, the fundamental problem of choosing the matching point, and allowances for deteriorations in service, are developed here. Effects of <b>towing</b> <b>loads</b> and of auxiliary loads are also discussed. The use of a controllable_pitch propeller complicates the matching, since propeller pitch variations constitute a degree of freedom in addition to that provided by engine fuel control. The marine designer's task with propulsion engines driving this type of propeller is outlined...|$|R
40|$|A {{numerical}} {{model for the}} coupled dynamics of a small liferaft and fast rescue craft in a surface wave is presented. The equations are formulated in 2 D using the methods of Kane and Levinson (1985) and solved numerically using a MATLAB Runge-Kutta routine. It is assumed that the motion normal to the wave surface is small and can be neglected, i. e. the bodies move along the propagating wave profile. The bodies are small so that wave diffraction and reflection are negligible. A Stokes? second order wave is used and the wave forces are applied using Morison?s equation for a body in accelerated flow. Wind loads are similarly modeled using drag coefficients. Comparison with model tests performed at the Institute for Ocean Technology shows good agreement.

50|$|A {{prototype}} model {{built on}} a modified Chevrolet 1/2 ton pick-up truck frame was built and designated the KWT. This unit still exists and is in storage. The KWT, according to the prototype's announcement pre-sales brochure, was built for ranchers and farmers as a heavy duty all terrain vehicle capable of hauling and <b>towing</b> <b>loads</b> into remote snowbound locations. It also {{was designed to be}} capable to be driven on the road with the tracks removed. The KWT never reached the production. The engine specified was to be a 250-cubic-inch, or optionally a 292-cubic-inch, 6-cylinder gasoline powered, Chevrolet engine. A brochure announces it would use conventional steering when driven as a wheeled vehicle but does not indicate how it would steer as a tracked vehicle. This prototype vehicle still exists and is currently unused and in storage and owned by a private antique vehicle collector.|$|R
50|$|The vehicle {{could carry}} gun crews {{of up to}} 12 men in theatre-type seats. Under the seats was storage room for various tools, and the whole vehicle was spacious enough to carry their kit. The rear of the vehicle housed an {{enclosed}} compartment for storage of ammunition, though a second ammunition carrier was desirable. The tractor could <b>tow</b> <b>loads</b> up to 8,000 kg (17,600 lb) in weight. Most were fitted with a winch that could pull up to 3450 kg. It had a payload of 1800 kg. The windscreen was able to fold down and a canvas roof could be erected. A number were also constructed with a hard top, but this was less common in service. A later simplified type appeared with a timber frame truck-type layout, the ammunition being stored behind the driver's station and the gun crew having space on wooden benches behind.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Transmissions play a {{vital role}} in {{machines}} by transforming the torque and speed of a motor into a desired output. They are often necessary for operating a motor at peak efficiency or power. The majority of variable transmissions are mechanically complex, large, and expensive, which limits scalability and is often cost prohibitive. As an alternative, we propose an origami-wheel design that is capable of varying its own transmission ratio between motor torque and ground reac-tion force, effectively creating a passive, continuously variable transmission. The wheel responds to an increase in torque by reducing its radius through the spring-like properties of the origami structure, increasing the force applied by the wheel to the ground. We demonstrate that the wheel is able to match the speed of a 55 mm fixed-radius wheel when unloaded, and can also <b>tow</b> <b>loads</b> as high as a 25 mm wheel without stalling. This design could be used to provide smaller, cheaper robots with an effective means to vary their output while maintaining motor efficiency. I...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{ice tank}} tests on two new circular and rigid sidewall Air Cushion Iceabreaker Bows (ACIBs), {{conducted in the}} ice tank at the Institute for Marine Dynamics (Canada). Each model used a kneeless segment skirt, which is basically the skirt system proposed for the prototypes. The objective {{was to examine the}} ice breaking capability of the two designs to better understand the ice breaking mechanism and to develop scaling laws for the presnetation of air cushion icebreaking data. Data available from field and other model tests were also compated with the IMD data. In the tests, each ACIB was attached to a towing carriage. Air flow into the cushion was suppplied by a Vortex Blower. EG/AD/S ice sheets, with thicknesses in the range 30 mm to 50 mm, were used to model the ice covers. For some tests, the ice sheet was presawn to investigate the significance of the breaking component of resistance. <b>Tow</b> <b>load,</b> cushion pressure, cushion flow and carriage speed were recorded.

5000|$|The Commander {{is powered}} by the 26.7L Rolls-Royce/Perkins CV12 TCE twin {{turbocharged}} diesel engine that produces approximately [...] and is coupled to an Allison automatic transmission. The Scammell Commander CV12 engine {{is very similar to}} the ones used in the Challenger 1 and 2 main battle tanks but with an increased power output of around 1,200 bhp 895 kW. Designed to <b>tow</b> <b>loads</b> up to 65 tonnes, the Commander tows a special semi-trailer onto which tanks can be tail-loaded using a hydraulic 20-tonne capacity winch. A prominent bonnet houses the vehicle's Perkins (Rolls-Royce) CV 12 TCE V12 and although the Commander {{is powered by}} the Perkins/Rolls-Royce engine, other types were also proposed - one of the prototypes used a Cummins KTA 600 diesel. The cab has provision for up to three or four passengers and there is space for two bunks behind the front seats. Due to the front axle lock angle, the Commander is highly maneuverable and can negotiate a 'T' intersection with only 9.15 meters between the walls.|$|R
