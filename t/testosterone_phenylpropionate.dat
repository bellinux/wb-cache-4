50|$|<b>Testosterone</b> <b>phenylpropionate</b> (BAN) (brand name Testolent), or {{testosterone}} phenpropionate, {{also known}} as testosterone hydrocinnamate, is a synthetic anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) and an androgen ester - specifically, the C17β phenylpropionate ester of testosterone - which was formerly marketed in Romania. It was first reported in the scientific literature in 1955 and was an ingredient of several isolated AAS commercial products, but was never widely used. <b>Testosterone</b> <b>phenylpropionate</b> was also notably a component of Sustanon and Omnadren.|$|E
50|$|Testosterone {{decanoate}} (BAN) is an androgen and {{anabolic steroid}} and a testosterone ester. It is or {{has been a}} component of Sustanon, along with testosterone propionate, <b>testosterone</b> <b>phenylpropionate,</b> and testosterone isocaproate. Testosterone decanoate has been investigated as a potential long-acting injectable male contraceptive.|$|E
50|$|Testosterone caproate, or {{testosterone}} hexanoate, is an androgen and {{anabolic steroid}} and a testosterone ester {{that is no}} longer marketed. It was formerly available as a component of Omnadren 250, along with testosterone isocaproate, <b>testosterone</b> <b>phenylpropionate,</b> and testosterone propionate, but this formulation has since been discontinued.|$|E
40|$|Biological {{tests can}} be used to screen samples for large groups of {{compounds}} having a particular effect, but {{it is often difficult to}} identify a specific compound when a positive effect is observed. The identification of an unknown compound is a challenge for analytical chemistry in environmental analysis, food analysis, as well as in clinical and forensic toxicology. In this study bioassay-guided fractionation, ultra high performance liquid chromatography combined with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC/TOFMS) and accurate mass database searching was tested to detect and identify unknown androgens. Herbal mixtures and sport supplements were tested using an androgen bioassay and modifications in sample preparations were carried out in order to activate inactive pro-androgens, androgen esters and conjugated androgens to enable their detection in the bioassay. Two of the four herbal mixtures tested positive and bioassay-guided fractionation followed by UHPLC/TOFMS of positive fractions resulted in the identification of nortestosterone <b>phenylpropionate,</b> <b>testosterone</b> cyclohexanecarboxylate and methyltestosterone. Three of the four sport supplements reacted toxic in the bioassay or gave inconclusive results and were further investigated using UHPLC/TOFMS in combination with data processing software and an accurate mass database having approximately 40, 000 entries. This accurate mass database was derived from the PubChem database on the internet and coupled to the TOFMS software. This resulted in the tentative identification of several androgens, including methylboldenone, testosterone and the androgen esters methyltestosterone propionate or testosterone isobutyrate, testosterone buciclate and methylenetestosterone acetate. The study showed that bioassay-guided fractionation in combination with UHPLC/TOFMS analysis is a useful procedure to detect, isolate and identify unknown androgens in suspected samples. As an alternative, the use of data processing software in combination with an accurate mass database and coupled on-line with the TOFMS instrument software enabled the identification of androgens and androgen esters in the chromatogram even without bioassay-guided fractionation...|$|R
5000|$|Estradiol {{phenylpropionate}} (EPP), {{also known}} as estradiol 17β-phenylpropionate, is a semisynthetic, steroidal estrogen. It is the phenylpropionate ester of estradiol. EPP is marketed in combination with estradiol benzoate under the brand name Dimenformon Prolongatum in the Netherlands and in combination with estradiol benzoate, testosterone propionate, <b>testosterone</b> <b>phenylpropionate,</b> and testosterone isocaproate under the brand name Mixogen (a balanced mixture of estradiol and testosterone esters).http://home.intekom.com/pharm/donmed/mixogen.html Both of these drug combinations are long-acting injectables indicated in hormone replacement therapy for women in menopause. Dimenformon Prolongatum has also been investigated as a single injection, [...] "morning after" [...] post-coital contraceptive, and is additionally used {{as a component of}} hormone replacement therapy for transgender women.|$|E
40|$|Anabolic steroids are {{currently}} very controversial issue {{not only for}} its therapeutic use but especially because of the illegal abuse in the sport branch. The aim of this thesis was to develop a rapid, selective, effective and simple method of high performance liquid chromatography suitable for the determination of anabolic steroids in injectable dosage form. The analyzed sample of pharmaceutical product Sustamed contained four testosterone esters: testosterone propionate, <b>testosterone</b> <b>phenylpropionate,</b> testosterone isocaproate and testosterone decanoate. Optimized HPLC-DAD conditions suitable for determination of the selected testosterone esters were as follows: core-shell column Poroshell HPH-C 18 (3. 0 x 100 mm, 2. 7 mm), mobile phase consisted of 10 mmol/l ammonium acetate, pH 4. 5 and acetonitrile, gradient elution was used. The column was thermostated at 50 řC, injection volume was 1 µl, flow rate was set at 1 ml/min and UV detection at 240 nm. Total analysis time was 6 minutes. Key words anabolic steroids, testosterone esters, HPLC-DA...|$|E
40|$|Sustanon {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} used anabolic androgenic drugs to increase skeletal muscle mass and strength. This drug is a blend of four esterized testosterone derivatives: Testosterone propionate, <b>testosterone</b> <b>phenylpropionate,</b> testosterone isocaproate and testosterone decanoate. Little is known about the effects of this drug on skeletal muscle at the cellular level. This study aimed to investigate the influence of Sustanon on the morphology of skeletal muscle fibers and the distribution of myogenic stem cells known as Satellite Cells (SCs) during postnatal growth. We hypothesized that Sustanon-induced skeletal muscle hypertrophy is associated with an increase in the number of SCs. Robust immunocytochemical techniques and morphometric analyses were used to calculate the numbers of SCs and myonuclei within the pectoralis muscle of chickens. Also, DNA concentration and Pax 7 protein levels were measured to confirm immunocytochemical findings. Sustanon significantly increased pectoralis mass and fiber size. All SC indices and the number of myonuclei increased significantly by Sustanon administration. In addition, greater DNA concentration and Pax 7 protein expression were found in Sustanon-treated birds. This study indicates that Sustanon can induce avian skeletal muscle hypertrophy and that this is correlated with increased numbers of SCs and myonuclei...|$|E
