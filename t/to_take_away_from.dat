5|$|To {{the east}} von Falkenhayn, held his reserve force of 3rd Cavalry Division (Seventh Army's III Corps) and 19th Division (Eighth Army reserve) {{in front of}} Beit Jibrin. They waited {{throughout}} the day for the main attack to make progress before beginning their own advance, but the opportunity never eventuated. This powerful Ottoman counterattack had been contained and had not forced any rearrangement of the invading forces, whose preparations and concentration on the plain were now complete. But von Falkenhayn was forced to halt his Seventh Army's attack and then <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> it the 16th Division plus one regiment.|$|E
5|$|Levels in {{the console}} {{versions}} of Underground were significantly {{larger than those}} of earlier Tony Hawk's games. Neversoft expanded each level until it ceased to run correctly, then shrunk it slightly. Most of the levels were modelled closely after real-world locations; the designers traveled to locales representative of each city {{in the game and}} took photographs and videos as reference. The New Jersey level was a replication of a neighborhood where team artist Henry Ji had grown up as a young skater. Neversoft wanted the player to become familiar with the basic game mechanics quickly and to notice Undergrounds differences from previous Tony Hawk's titles immediately. To accomplish this, they introduced the ability to travel on foot, and the ability to climb along ledges in the first few missions of the game. While Neversoft wanted to keep Underground realistic and relatable for the most part, they added driving side-missions as an enjoyable diversion and to push the boundaries of freedom in skateboarding games. However, these missions were intended not <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the main experience of skateboarding.|$|E

Cho was happy to win the Honinbo once more, but Kobayashi still held to Kisei and Meijin titles, which Cho desired <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> his rival.

25|$|Oldcastle's {{religious}} beliefs were considerably influenced by Lollard cleric William Swynderby, who preached in Almeley during his youth. Lollardy was a politico-religious movement initiated by prominent theologian John Wycliffe in the 1370s during his {{service in the}} University of Oxford. Lollard beliefs were outlined in the 1395 The Twelve Conclusions of the Lollards, which dealt with their opposition to capital punishment, rejection of religious celibacy, and belief {{that members of the}} Clergy should be held accountable to civil laws. The Conclusions also rejected pilgrimages, ornamentation of churches, and religious images because these were said <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the true nature of worship, focus on God. Also denounced in the Conclusions were war, violence, and abortion.|$|E
500|$|Parker's {{experience}} {{playing in}} Israel left a positive impression upon him. He {{went on to}} wear jersey number 18 for both Toronto and Cleveland, explaining that: [...] "I played in Israel before I {{came back to the}} NBA, and I had such a great time... two of my sons were born while I was playing overseas and one was actually born in Israel. And I just had such a great experience that I wanted to take something from that experience. The number 18, in Judaism, it means 'chai'... and it's the symbol for life and good fortune in Judaism. And I thought that was something <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Israel and let them know I'm still representing them." ...|$|E

She acted in her first English film, Rituparno Ghosh's The Last Lear, as a struggling film actress opposite Amitabh Bachchan. The film premiered at the 2007 Toronto International Film Festival, and was received well. Later reviews in India were approving, with Rajeev Masand writing, [...] "Preity Zinta gets through her scenes competently, never allowing her cute-as-a-button image <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the impact she makes here as a conflicted, mature woman." [...] Initially dismissive of art films, Zinta eventually spoke of her first venture into the genre, confessing, [...] "I did think with art films that they don't pay you, they don't feed you, but I was wrong, and I'm {{so happy to be}} here." ...|$|E

500|$|On the {{direction}} of the film, Selick reflected, [...] "It's as though he [...] laid the egg, and I sat on it and hatched it. He wasn't involved in a hands-on way, but his hand is in it. It was my job {{to make it look like}} 'a Tim Burton film', which is not so different from my own films." [...] When asked on Burton's involvement, Selick claimed, [...] "I don't want <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Tim, but he was not in San Francisco when we made it. He came up five times over two years, and spent no more than eight or ten days in total." [...] Walt Disney Feature Animation contributed with some use of second-layering traditional animation. Burton found production somewhat difficult because he was directing Batman Returns and in pre-production of Ed Wood.|$|E
500|$|At Paris–Nice in March, Contador {{appeared}} well in line {{to repeat}} his victory there from two years prior, winning the opening individual time trial [...] and the mountainous sixth stage. He dramatically faltered in Stage 7, however, losing the yellow jersey and three minutes to Luis León Sánchez, and ultimately finishing fourth. He was unable to chase down Sánchez because of what was later blamed on dietary problems. The team experienced both success and hardship in the Vuelta a Castilla y León later in the month. Leipheimer won the event overall, with Contador having ridden the event in support for him. The first day, however, Armstrong {{was involved in a}} crash and taken to the hospital with was later revealed as a fractured clavicle.

500|$|A {{reviewer}} from Plugged In criticized Perry's {{decision to}} create an uplifting song about such a serious subject matter as divorce: [...] "Framing the song {{in terms of her}} divorce from Brand, though 'Part of Me', puts a much more somber and serious spin on things. This is no mere breakup. It's the demolition of a marital covenant. So no matter how bad things were in her relationship, no matter how much better she feels now, no matter how cathartic the pulsing beats (courtesy of hitmeisters Max Martin and Dr. Luke) might feel, the ultimate end here is a very sad one indeed." [...] Priya Elan of NME panned the song: 'This is the part of me, that you're never going <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> me,' [...] "she sings in that strange angry robot voice of hers. The sentiment, as ever, is punch you in face crystal clear and probably meant something to one of the (probably) 17 writers who wrote the song. As it stands, it's another de-humanised slab of radio pop from Perry INC." ...|$|E

500|$|The Commander-in-Chief of the Brazilian forces, Admiral Joaquim Marques Lisboa (then Baron {{and later}} Marquis of Tamandaré), himself a Progressive, {{complained to the}} Brazilian Cabinet of the outcome {{engineered}} by Paranhos. By the time the peace treaty was concluded, the Uruguayan capital was under siege by Brazilian troops and under blockade by the Brazilian fleet. The admiral and the Cabinet were eager {{for an end to}} the conflict which would have resulted in a conquest of the enemy capital and a consequent boost in the popularity of the Brazilian government. Paranhos, however, had preempted such an outcome. As retaliation for the bloodless conclusion, he was fired from his post. Returning to Brazil, he defended himself in the Senate: [...] "Say [...] whatever you want about the diplomatic act of 20 February; you will not be able <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> me this grateful conviction: that through that solution I saved the life of 2,000 fellow compatriots, [...] avoided the destruction of an important capital". Nonetheless, he received accolades in Uruguay, Brazil and even Argentina for his accomplishment in engineering both an end to the war and the formation of the alliance.|$|E
500|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the meeting Heydrich gave Eichmann firm instructions about what was to appear in the minutes. They were not to be verbatim: Eichmann ensured that nothing too explicit appeared in them. He said at his trial: [...] "How shall I put it — certain over-plain talk and jargon expressions had to be rendered into office language by me". Eichmann condensed his records into a document outlining the purpose of the meeting and the intentions of the regime moving forward. He stated at his trial that it was personally edited by Heydrich, and thus reflected the message he intended the participants <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the meeting. Copies of the minutes (known from the German word for [...] "minutes" [...] as the [...] "Wannsee Protocol") were sent by Eichmann to all the participants after the meeting. Most of these copies were destroyed {{at the end of the}} war as participants and other officials sought to cover their tracks. It was not until 1947 that Luther's copy (number 16 out of 30 copies prepared) was found by Robert Kempner, a U.S. prosecutor in the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg, in files that had been seized from the German Foreign Office.|$|E
500|$|Will Salmon at SFX {{scored the}} episode 3.5 stars out of 5, feeling that [...] "The 'agent gone bad' is a {{hackneyed}} trope, but this works, {{largely because of}} Pascale Armand’s strong, understated performance" [...] and praising the opening sequence as being [...] "wonderfully eerie", comparing it positively to Doctor Who and The Avengers. Graeme Virtue at The Guardian praised the more focused, personal stakes of the episode, noting that [...] "it's easier to cheer for scrappy underdogs than a huge, militarised Big Brother organisation like SHIELD", as well as Grant Ward's storyline, but criticized the episode's use of Bear McCreary's score, calling it [...] "backgrounded". Marc Bernardin of The Hollywood Reporter praised the episode for its much more realistic (compared to previous episodes) familial environment, complete with tension, {{as well as the}} character of Akela Amador and the fact that [...] "Agent Coulson {{was at the center of}} the action, where he belongs". Den of Geeks James Hunt surmised that [...] "Agents of SHIELD is definitely getting better and that's the main thing <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> this episode.

500|$|The Way I See It was an {{exemplary}} {{release of the}} classic soul revival during its peak in 2008. The music scene was marked by similarly retro-minded work from mainstream artists such as Amy Winehouse and Adele, independent acts such as Sharon Jones & The Dap-Kings and Mayer Hawthorne, and older artists attempting comebacks such as Al Green and Bettye LaVette. Oliver Wang cited Saadiq's album, along with Solange Knowles' 2008 record Sol-Angel and the Hadley St. Dreams, {{as one of the}} [...] "retro-soul" [...] efforts that were released by contemporary R artists as the music scene peaked in popularity. Wang wrote that The Way I See It [...] "showcased a mastery of any number of past R styles, including those out of Memphis, Muscle Shoals, Philadelphia, New Orleans, and of course, Detroit." [...] Estelle said in 2008, [...] "Every song is like a different era of Motown ... Everything sounds exactly like it did back in the day. Not <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Amy, but this is the real shit." [...] It was described by David Nathan as the [...] "contemporary album that was the closest to authentically recreating the great soul music sound of the late '60s and early '70s." [...] Ken Tucker found it distinct from other soul revival music: [...] "You can reproduce variations on melodies and rhythm, but without an emotional commitment, it's all tedious pandering to baby boomers. For Raphael Saadiq, there's a glowing vibrancy in soul music that allows him to work out themes and ideas." ...|$|E
500|$|When the {{character}} was announced, he {{was described as}} a hustler who sees everything as an opportunity, and has created several personas since the age of seven to hide his real self. Norwood expanded on this, saying [...] "when he was in school and the register was being read out and it got to his name it would be 'Chubb!' and all the kids in school would start taking the mickey out of it. What he did was create something even more ridiculous <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> that. He [...] out of himself and took the power away from those that were taking the mickey out of him. [...] For the same reason most kids put on a front, it's to protect himself from the world. He doesn't like his real name so he tried to create something that would get away from that and Fatboy was that creation. The street and the slang stuff is not something that is far away from him, it is still from the area that he lives in. Fatboy was someone he adopted to put a brave face on, to put a mask on himself, to protect Arthur from the world." [...] Before adopting the [...] "Fatboy" [...] persona, he would adopt personas of men he saw on television, and Norwood said Fatboy was [...] "an awkward kind of child". Fatboy comes from a wealthy background, and gets what he wants from his parents, with whom he has a good relationship, but hustles to hide the fact. He often wears clothing brand Ed Hardy, and his speech has, according to Norwood, a [...] "unique rhythm". Norwood is able to make viable changes to the script to make it sound more authentic.|$|E

The findings of fact and expert witness testimony in District Court {{played an important role}} in this appellate decision, emphasizing that it is unreasonable to believe Proposition 8 was enacted to: promote childrearing by biological parents, encourage procreation, be cautious in social change, protect religious liberty, or control children's education.

2500|$|The end of {{transportation}} and {{the rapid growth of}} population following the gold rush led to a demand for [...] "British institutions" [...] in New South Wales, which meant an elected parliament and responsible self-government. In 1851 the franchise for the Legislative Council was expanded, but this did not satisfy the settlers, many of whom (such as the young Henry Parkes) had been Chartists in Britain in the 1840s. Successive Governors warned the Colonial Office of the dangers of republicanism if the demands for self-government were not met. There was, however, a prolonged battle between the conservatives, now led by Wentworth, and the democrats as to what kind of constitution New South Wales would have. The key issue was control of the pastoral lands, which the democrats wanted <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the squatters and break up into farms for settlers. Wentworth wanted a hereditary upper house controlled by the squatters to prevent any such possibility.
