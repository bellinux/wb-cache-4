The spectrum of symptoms it may induce includes attacks of headache, flushing, laryngitis, dizziness, nausea, extreme weakness, arthralgia, unwarranted depression, dysphonia, exhaustion, inability to think clearly, arrhythmia or muscle spasms. The nonspecificity of such symptoms can baffle physicians from many specialties. Presented herein is a simple office method for demonstrating that formaldehyde is among the etiologic agents triggering these symptoms. The very symptoms that patients complain of can be provoked within minutes, and subsequently abolished, with an intradermal injection of the appropriate strength of formaldehyde. This injection aids in convincing the patient of the cause of the symptoms so he can initiate measures to bring his disease under control...|$|E

40|$|Sick <b>building</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{describes}} {{a number of}} mostly unspesific complaints of some occupants of the building. The exact pathophysiological mechanism remains elusive. It is a multi factorial event which may include physical, chemical, biological as well as psycological factors. In many cases it is due to insufficient maintenance of the HVAC (heating, ventilation, air conditioning) system in the building. Sign and symptoms can be uncomfortable and even disabling, which may include mucus membrane irritation, neurotoxic symptoms, asthma like symptoms, skin complaints, gastrointestinal symptoms and other related symptoms. There are various investigation methods to diagnose sick <b>building</b> <b>syndrome,</b> and on site assessment of the building is extremely useful. Prevention through a proactive air quality monitoring program is far more desirable than dealing with an actual sick building.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} {{the occurrence of}} sick <b>building</b> <b>syndrome</b> in a tropical city, {{and its relation to}} indoor air quality and other factors. METHODS: 2856 office workers in 56 randomly selected public and private sector buildings were surveyed. The study consisted of a self administered questionnaire assessing symptoms and perception of the physical and psychosocial environment, inspection of the building plans and premises, and measurement of temperature, relative humidity, respirable particles, chemicals, bioaerosols, and other variables. RESULTS: Symptoms typical of the sick <b>building</b> <b>syndrome</b> were reported in 19. 6 % of the respondents. Multivariate modelling substantiated contributions associated with low thermal comfort, high work related stress, too much noise, a history of allergy or other medical conditions, poor lighting, young employees, and female sex. Measurements of indoor air quality or ventilation were not found to be reliable predictors of the symptoms. CONCLUSION: The survey confirmed the presence of sick <b>building</b> <b>syndrome</b> and its risk factors in the tropics.

40|$|This thesis studied empirically the air-handling {{etiology}} of the nonspecific {{symptoms of the}} eyes, respiratory tract, skin, and central nervous system in office workers, often termed the sick <b>building</b> <b>syndrome.</b> The results of a four-period crossover trial in 75 office workers suggest that 70 % air recirculation when accompanied by an adequate intake of outdoor air can be used without causing adverse effects. A cross-sectional study of 2678 workers in 41 randomly selected office buildings from Helsinki metropolitan area provides evidence that mechanical ventilation, air conditioning, steam and evaporative humidification and air recirculation are risk indicators of studied symptoms in the existing Finnish office building stock.

40|$|Sick <b>building</b> <b>syndrome</b> (SBS) {{is usually}} {{defined as an}} {{increased}} occurrence of non-specific symptoms among populations in determined buildings. This definition differs from those of other medical syndromes in that it {{refers to a system}} (a building inclusive of its population) rather than to a clinical state in a single individual. Such a definition should make the term SBS impossible to use as a diagnosis applied to individual persons. In spite of this, it is often used in this way, and the aim of the article is to discuss problems with this practice. It is a case study based on an office building with long-standing building-related health problems. Information concerning the building and its inhabitants comes from a large number of separate documentary sources. The study demonstrates that the diagnostic use of SBS suffers from serious weaknesses. It is proposed that such diagnostics could even have a normative force serving to maintain and reinforce building-related, non-specific health problems. It is therefore suggested that the term sick <b>building</b> <b>syndrome</b> should be abandoned. sick <b>building</b> <b>syndrome</b> building-related health problems indoor air quality...|$|R

In this work, the relationship between sick building symptoms and indoor environmental factors of two office buildings were studied. Methods: In this cross- sectional study, the sick building symptoms among two office building workers of Petroleum Industry Health Organization were examined. For this purpose, a validated questionnaire was used to determine the prevalence of the sick <b>building</b> <b>syndromes</b> and the relationship between personal and environmental factors. Meantime, indoor environmental factors including noise, light, humidity, air velocity, temperature and CO 2 concentration were measured with appropriate calibrated instrumentations. Results: The results revealed that there is a significant relationship between CO 2 concentration as an air quality factor and some sick building symptoms including nausea, headache, nasal irritation, shortness of breath and dry throat. A significant relationship (P-Value < 0. 05) was determined between the noise exposure and headache as well as dizziness. The light intensity had a significant impact (P-Value < 0. 05) on dry skin, eye pain and malaise. Conclusion: Sick building symptoms among the women were higher than men.

50|$|Some {{other human}} {{diseases}} and symptoms {{have been proposed}} {{to be associated with}} indoor bioaerosol, but no deterministic conclusions could be drawn due to the insufficiency of evidence. One example is the well-known sick <b>building</b> <b>syndrome</b> (SBS). SBS refers to non-specific complaints, such as upper-respiratory irritative symptoms, headaches, fatigue, and rash, which cannot be related to an identifiable cause but are building related. Over the last two decades, there have been many studies indicating association of indoor bioaerosol with sick <b>building</b> <b>syndrome.</b> However, most of the related studies based their conclusions on statistical correlation between concentrations of certain types of bioaerosols and incidence of complaints, which has various drawbacks methodologically. For example, some studies have a small sample size, which critically undermines the validity of speculations based on the statistical results. Also, many studies were not able to exclude the influences of other factors beside bioaerosol in their analysis, which makes the statistical correlation theoretically inappropriate to support association of SBS with bioaerosols. Additional studies revealed that bioaerosol is unlikely to be the cause of SBS. Recent epidemiological and toxicological studies continued to suggest a possible link between bioaerosol exposure and sick <b>building</b> <b>syndrome,</b> but methodological limitations remained in these studies.|$|R
