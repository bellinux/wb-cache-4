25|$|Richard Wiseman, of The Committee for Skeptical Inquiry, draws {{attention}} to possible alternative explanations for perceived paranormal activity in his article, The Haunted Brain. While he recognizes that approximately 15% of people believe they have experienced an encounter with a ghost, he reports that only 1% report seeing a full-fledged ghost while the rest report strange sensory stimuli, such as seeing fleeting shadows or wisps of smoke, or the sensation of hearing footsteps or feeling a presence. Wiseman makes the claim that, rather than experiencing paranormal activity, it is activity within our own brains that creates <b>these</b> <b>strange</b> sensations.|$|E

500|$|Actor Jim Beaver {{described}} Bobby as a [...] "rough but warmhearted" [...] working-class {{man with}} the outlook that [...] "sometimes {{there are things that}} need to be done and they're not fun to do, but they gotta be done anyway". When the [...] "usually level-headed" [...] hunter must use a wheelchair in the fifth season, he becomes [...] "frustrated and angry"; instead of being able to join the battles, he is [...] "stuck at home manning the telephones". This feeling of uselessness eventually leads to thoughts of suicide, though he deems himself too much of a coward to go through with it. On the situation, Beaver commented, [...] "Bobby lives in a world where all kinds of strange things are possible. Somewhere along the line, he has a hope that one of <b>these</b> <b>strange,</b> miraculous things might happen to him. I think he is also a realist. He understands that even when you have friends that come back from the dead, not everything that you want to happen is going to happen." ...|$|E
500|$|The plot of {{the game}} was {{generally}} well received by reviewers, who praised it as horrifying, compelling, and [...] "dark". 1UP.com praised the titular room as constantly maintaining a sense of unease for the player. Game Revolution enjoyed the relatively normal appearance of the environment outside Henry's room at the game's beginning, writing: [...] "Are <b>these</b> <b>strange</b> otherworlds real, or are they just the nightmares of some lunatic shut-in who chained up his own door? It effectively blurs the line between reality and delusion, leading to a singularly creepy game." [...] In contrast, IGN's Douglass C. Perry felt that the familiarity of the story {{as compared with the}} other Silent Hill storylines detracted from its horror appeal, although he cared about its characters more than in previous games. Critics were, for the most part, pleased with the voice acting in the game, although it did receive criticism for the characters' calmness. Nevertheless, producer and composer Akira Yamaoka said that the characters were, to him, [...] "a little weak." ...|$|E

500|$|Unlike {{some other}} {{returning}} monsters, the Ice Warriors were not heavily redesigned. Gatiss insisted upon keeping {{the fundamentals of}} the original and Moffat explained that the original design was not well-known enough to put a new spin on it, and so Skaldak's shell is just a [...] "super-version of the original". Of the original design, Millennium FX's Neill Gorton said, [...] "My problem with the old ones is they had Lego hands and weird, spindly arms but a bulky body and <b>these</b> <b>strange</b> saddlebag hips, almost feminine. They had fur sticking out everywhere. So all of that together didn't suggest [...] "ice warriors." [...] They should be much beefier and stronger. We gave it more of a bodybuilder physique, changed the hands and styled the body {{to make it look}} more like armour-plating, even though it's reptilian." [...] The costume was made of flexible urethane rubber instead of the fibreglass like the original, as it would damage less easily and be more comfortable to wear. The costume was made to specially fit Spencer Wilding. Though only some of the Skaldak's real appearance was shown on-screen, Gorton stated that they created a full animatronic body.|$|E
500|$|... "For June Bolan, {{the alarm}} bells began to sound only when Syd kept his girlfriend under {{lock and key}} for three days, {{occasionally}} shoving a ration of biscuits under the door." [...] A claim of cruelty against Barrett committed by the groupies and hangers-on who frequented his apartment during this period was described by writer and critic Jonathan Meades. [...] "I went [...] to see Harry and there was this terrible noise. It sounded like heating pipes shaking. I said, 'What's up?' and he sort of giggled and said, 'That's Syd having a bad trip. We put him in the linen cupboard'". Storm Thorgerson responded to this claim by stating [...] "I do not remember locking Syd up in a cupboard. It sounds to me like pure fantasy, like Jonathan Meades was on dope himself." [...] Other friends assert that Barrett's infamous flatmates, [...] "Mad Jock" [...] and [...] "Mad Sue," [...] believed that acid held all the answers and thought of Barrett as a genius or [...] "god," [...] and were spiking his morning coffee with LSD every day without his knowledge, leaving him in a never-ending trip. He was later rescued from that flat by friends and moved elsewhere, but his erratic behavior continued. Watkinson and Anderson included quotes from a story told to them by Thorgerson that underscored how volatile Barrett could be. [...] "On one occasion, I had to pull him off Lindsay (Barrett's girlfriend at the time) because he was beating her over the head with a mandolin". On one occasion, Barrett threw a woman called Gilly across the room, because she refused to go to Gilmour's house. <b>These</b> <b>strange</b> behaviors contradicted Barrett's usually gentle nature. According to Gilmour in an interview with Nick Kent, the other members of Pink Floyd approached psychiatrist R. D. Laing with the 'Barrett problem'. After hearing a tape of a Barrett conversation, Laing declared him [...] "incurable".|$|E
