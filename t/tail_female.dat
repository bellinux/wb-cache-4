40|$|Morpho-biometrical {{studies were}} {{conducted}} on 12 Bursaphelenchus xylophilus isolates collected from maritime pine, Pinus pinaster, in Portugal. The {{studies were carried out}} on 20 females and 20 males from each isolate. A wide variation in the <b>female</b> <b>tails,</b> from round, digitate to mucronate was detected in all isolates, confirming the occurrence of mucronate <b>tails</b> in some <b>females</b> of B. xylophilus. The presence of mucronate <b>tailed</b> <b>females</b> in the Portuguese isolates of B. xylophilus clearly makes the identification of B. xylophilus by this morphological character difficult since other non-pathogenic Bursaphelenchus species also have mucronate <b>tailed</b> <b>females.</b> Amplification of satellite DNA of single specimens using species-specific primers confirmed the identity of the mucronate <b>tailed</b> <b>females</b> in the Portuguese isolates as B. xylophilus.

EA stimulation was performed daily for two weeks, and total IgE, DNP-KLH specific IgE, IL- 4 and IFN-γ levels were measured {{at the end of the}} experiment. The results of this study showed that the IgE and IL- 4 levels were significantly suppressed in the ST 36 -LEA and ST 36 -HEA groups, but not in the NA-LEA and NA-HEA groups. However, there was little difference in the immunomodulatory effects observed in the ST 36 -LEA and ST 36 -HEA groups. Taken together, these results suggest that EA stimulation-induced immunomodulation is not frequency dependent, but that it is acupoint specific...|$|E
40|$|Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) {{regulation}} of aromatase gene expression in vitro requires the transcriptional coactivator beta-catenin. To ascertain the physiological significance of beta-catenin in granulosa cells during folliculogenesis, mice homozygous for floxed alleles of beta-catenin were intercrossed with Amhr 2 cre mice. Conditional deletion of beta-catenin in 8 -wk-old females occurred in derivatives of the Müllerian duct, granulosa cells and, surprisingly, in brain, pituitary, heart, liver, and <b>tail.</b> <b>Female</b> mice deficient for beta-catenin were infertile, despite reaching puberty and ovulating at the expected age, indications of apparently normal ovarian function. In contrast, their oviducts were grossly distended, with fewer but healthy oocytes. In addition, their uteri lacked implantation sites. Together, these two phenotypes {{could explain the}} complete loss of fertility. Nevertheless, although the ovary appeared normal, with serum estradiol concentrations in the normal range, there was marked animal-to-animal variation of mRNAs encoding beta-catenin and aromatase. Similarly, inhibin-alpha and luteinizing hormone receptor mRNAs varied considerably in whole ovaries, whereas pituitary Fshb mRNA was significantly reduced. Collectively, these features suggested cyclization recombination (CRE) -mediated recombination of beta-catenin may be unstable in proliferating granulosa cells, and therefore may mask the suspected steroidogenic requirement for beta-catenin. We tested this possibility by transducing primary cultures of granulosa cells from mice homozygous for floxed alleles of beta-catenin with a CRE-expressing adenovirus. Reduction of beta-catenin significantly compromised FSH stimulation of aromatase mRNA and subsequent production of estradiol. Collectively, these data suggest that FSH {{regulation of}} steroidogenesis requires beta-catenin, a role that remains hidden when tested through Amhr 2 cre-mediated recombination in vivo...|$|E

40|$|The role {{of dietary}} fat, {{as opposed to}} total energy intake, in the {{etiology}} of obesity is controversial. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the effect of macronutrient content, specifically changes in dietary fat on body weight, fat stores, and food intake in S. crassicaudata, a marsupial that stores about 25 % of total body fat in its <b>tail.</b> <b>Female</b> animals were divided into three groups (n = 7 - 9) matched for food intake per gram of body weight. Each group of animals was fed, ad lib an isocaloric diet (1. 01 kcal/g), which contained either 10, 20, or 40 % of calories from fat. Body weight, food intake, and tail width (an index of body fat stores) were measured daily. Over 21 days, cumulative energy intake was less (p = 0. 026) in the 40 % fat group compared to the 10 % fat group. Despite the differences in food intake, body weight in each group remained stable throughout the study, so that at day 21 there were no differences in the body weights between the three groups. In contrast, tail width increased in the animals who received the 40 % fat diet compared to either the 10 % (p = 0. 016) or 20 % (p = 0. 001) fat intake groups, whereas there was no significant change in tail width in either of these two groups. These observations indicate that macronutrient composition has a role, independent of total calories in the regulation of food intake and body fat stores, specifically that dietary fat promotes adiposity, independent of total caloric intake...|$|E
