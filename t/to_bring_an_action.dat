25|$|The {{liquidator}} will {{normally have}} a duty to ascertain whether any misconduct has been conducted by those in control of the company which has caused prejudice to the general body of creditors.

25|$|The LOE prescribes {{that the}} Director of a LLC may be sued by {{shareholders}} should he fail to perform his obligations and duties. In contrast, in a SC, {{there are no}} such provisions to grant the shareholders power <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>an</b> <b>action</b> against Directors who do not perform their duties. While the law lays out the fiduciary duties of the Directors, it does not provide a way to enforce these duties. This has led to the criticism that the interests of shareholders of SCs are not adequately protected.|$|E

40|$|Courts have {{traditionally}} been wary of plaintiffs who bring actions for negligent infliction of emotional distress.

25|$|The Act {{seeks to}} give direct effect to the European Convention on Human Rights in {{domestic}} law by enabling claimants <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>an</b> <b>action</b> in national courts {{instead of having}} to take their case before the European Court of Human Rights, as had previously been the case. The Act makes it unlawful for a public authority to act in a manner contrary to certain rights prescribed by the Convention and allows a UK court to award a remedy {{in the event of a}} breach. In principle, the Act has vertical effect in that it operates only vis-Ã -vis public bodies and not private parties. There are however certain situations in which the Act can be indirectly invoked against a private person.|$|E

As to ecclesiastical affairs, they are to remember that judgment pertains only to the church authorities. (ix) Of regulars.

500|$|Before the New York Court of Appeals, Fellows was {{represented}} by J. C. Spencer, who made three arguments. First, {{he argued that the}} right <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>an</b> <b>action</b> for trespass based on aboriginal title accrued only to an Indian nation, not an individual Indian. As Spencer noted, the Seneca Nation itself was prohibited by law from bringing an action [...] "by a private attorney." [...] Second, he argued that Fellows' title was valid. Third, he argued that the Seneca's rights under the treaty were only enforceable against the federal government, and did not affect the defendant's title as a condition precedent. The court reporter did not publish Martindale's responses.|$|E

500|$|The {{general rule}} was that anyone with an {{interest}} in the safety of the thing stolen may sue. It could be that the owner did not have a sufficient interest <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>an</b> <b>action.</b> If one person had a positive right in a thing, such as a pledgee, usufructory, or good faith possessor, both he and the owner could sue. The unsecured creditor could not. Those obliged by contract to return the thing, and other forms of [...] "negative interest", had an action available at the expense of owner. This was only true so long as the person obliged was solvent [...] that is, under a real risk of losing out by a theft. If the person obliged was insolvent, the owner would have an action instead. The plaintiff with a negative interest was precluded from an action if it was by his own fault (dolus), or other dishonest. The lower standard of care required of a depositee meant he could not be sued by a depositor, and so had no action available for furtum. A vendor, who had agreed a price but not delivered his thing, retained legal ownership of the thing. Thus if the thing was stolen, the vendor had the action on the theft because he was liable to the purchaser.|$|E
2500|$|The fourth {{potential}} bar to rescission is {{that the}} right will be lost if a claimant takes too long <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>an</b> <b>action</b> in court. The old term for lapse of time is [...] "laches" [...] (pronounced lay-cheese). The {{amount of time that}} needs to pass is not specified, and a judge will decide that on a case by case basis according to what he thinks is fair. The leading example is Leaf v International Galleries where Mr Leaf was told he had bought the painting 'Salisbury Cathedral' by John Constable. It was in fact a photocopy. Mr Leaf was told this five years later at an auction. However, Denning LJ held that by this time it was far too late to rescind, even though the painter's identity was clearly a condition that went to the root of the contract.|$|E
2500|$|In 1933 Random House, {{which had}} the rights to publish the entire book in the United States, decided to bring a test case to {{challenge}} the de facto ban, so as to publish the work without fear of prosecution. It therefore made an arrangement to import the edition published in France, {{and to have a}} copy seized by the U.S. Customs Service when the ship carrying the work arrived. Although Customs had been told in advance of the anticipated arrival of the book, the local official declined to confiscate it, stating [...] "everybody brings that in." [...] He and his superior were finally convinced to seize the work. [...] The United States Attorney then took seven months before deciding whether to proceed further. While the Assistant U.S. Attorney assigned to assess the work's obscenity felt that it was a [...] "literary masterpiece," [...] he also believed it to be obscene within the meaning of the law. The office therefore decided to take action against the work under the provisions of the Tariff Act of 1930, which allowed a district attorney <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>an</b> <b>action</b> for forfeiture and destruction of imported works which were obscene. [...] This set up the test case.|$|E

2500|$|Molloy {{never again}} held another command. He had married Juliana Laforey, {{one of the}} daughters of Admiral Sir John Laforey, and the couple had at least three children, Charles, John and Mary. Mary married Sir John Beresford, another naval officer. In time a story began to {{circulate}} that before his marriage to Juliana, he had been engaged to marry another woman, but had behaved dishonourably. Her friends had pressed her <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>an</b> <b>action</b> for breach of promise, but she refused, saying that God would judge him. The two happened to meet accidentally at Bath, whereupon {{she said to him}} [...] "Captain Molloy, you are a bad man. I wish you the greatest curse that can befall a British officer. When the day of battle comes, may your false heart fail you!" [...] Molloy's actions at the Glorious First of June, and his subsequent disgrace at the court martial were then presumed {{to be the result of}} her curse. Molloy's problems with women were not over, with the suggestion that he was dominated by his wife. A short refrain appeared in print, running: I, Anthony James Pye MolloyCan burn, take, sink and destroy;There's only one thing I can't do, upon my life!And that is, to stop the d-d tongue of my wife.|$|E
