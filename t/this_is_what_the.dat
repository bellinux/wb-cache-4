5|$|MasterCard Priceless Surprises Presents Gwen Stefani is {{a promotional}} concert tour by American singer and {{songwriter}} Gwen Stefani. This became Stefani's first tour since 2007's The Sweet Escape Tour; however, tickets {{available for the}} tour were only accessible by MasterCard holders. Stefani's recent partnership with MasterCard allowed her to create a concert experience for her fans in a more intimate setting, as she did not perform in large concert venues. The shows contained material from Stefani's first two studio albums, as well as songs that would later appear on her third release, <b>This</b> <b>Is</b> <b>What</b> <b>the</b> Truth Feels Like (2016).|$|E

5|$|On the Canadian Albums Chart {{compiled}} by Billboard, the record debuted and peaked at number 3, becoming her third consecutive album to do so. The album sold 4,400 copies {{in its first}} week, and was held back from the top spot by compilation album La Voix IV, and Justin Bieber's Purpose. In the week ending April 16, 2016, the album dropped to number 18, before dropping off the charts altogether seven weeks later. In the United Kingdom, the album debuted at number 14, becoming the week's fifth highest debut. The debut, and Stefani's two earlier albums coincidentally made their first appearance on the UK chart at number 14. It was the week's fifth highest debut, and second highest debut outside the top 10. The following week, <b>This</b> <b>Is</b> <b>What</b> <b>the</b> Truth Feels Like dipped 54 positions, the week's largest drop. In Australia, the album debuted at number 6, becoming her third consecutive top-ten solo album. <b>This</b> <b>Is</b> <b>What</b> <b>the</b> Truth Feels Like was the week's second highest debut, and was present for two weeks before departing the chart. On France's SNEP album chart, it premiered at number 44, becoming her lowest debut behind The Sweet Escapes peak at number 33.|$|E
5|$|<b>This</b> <b>Is</b> <b>What</b> <b>the</b> Truth Feels Like is {{the third}} studio album {{recorded}} by American singer and songwriter Gwen Stefani. It was released on March 18, 2016 by Interscope Records. Initially, the album {{was scheduled to be}} released in December 2014 with Stefani working with a handful of high-profile producers, and Benny Blanco serving as executive producer. However, after the underperformance of her 2014 singles and the writer's block Stefani suffered, she did not feel comfortable curating an album and scrapped the whole record in favor of starting again. The album's release was scheduled after Stefani hinted at it on her Twitter account.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, {{the album}} debuted at number 1 on the Billboard 200 chart, selling 84,000 album-equivalent {{units in the}} week ending March 24, {{according}} to Nielsen Music. In addition, <b>This</b> <b>Is</b> <b>What</b> <b>the</b> Truth Feels Like was also the best-selling album of the week, ranking number 1 on Billboards Top Album Sales chart, with pure album sales of 76,000 copies (90% of overall units). It became Stefani's first number 1 and third top five album as a solo artist. The only time she previously reached the top was with her band No Doubt with their third record Tragic Kingdom (1995). With this feat, she became the fifth woman to first reach number 1 {{as part of a}} band or group, and then later earn their own solo leader. However, it also marked the lowest first week sales for one of her albums, with Love. Angel. Music. Baby. and The Sweet Escape selling 309,000 copies and 243,000 copies in their first weeks, respectively. With the release Stefani peaked at number 4 on the Billboard Artist 100 chart, up approximately 557% from her previous peak of 53, the chart's fourth-highest jump ever. The following week, Billboard reported that the album dropped 16 places on the Billboard 200, with sales decreasing 78% to 17,700 copies. For the next five weeks, the album continued to drop down the charts. In its seventh week, it jumped from number 82 to number 59, the same week she appeared on The Late Late Show with James Corden. The record was on the chart for 13 weeks; its final position for the week ending August 6, 2016, was number 114. On May 27, 2016, <b>This</b> <b>Is</b> <b>What</b> <b>the</b> Truth Feels Like was made available on vinyl exclusively at Barnes & Noble in the United States; after its release, it debuted and peaked at number 23 on the Vinyl Albums component chart.|$|E

5|$|The album fared {{moderately}} well on Switzerland's Hitparade, {{where it}} became her second highest performing album, peaking at number 10. Similarly in Spain, the album peaked at No. 42, lasting {{a total of}} two weeks on the chart. Stefani's 2006 release, The Sweet Escape, did not chart. On Belgium's Ultratop Wallonia chart, it became her highest peaking album, where it debuted at number 21 and charted for four consecutive weeks. On Belgium's Flanders chart, it peaked at number 32 and lasted six consecutive weeks. In Scotland and Ireland, the album debuted at numbers 13 and 17 respectively. Elsewhere, <b>This</b> <b>Is</b> <b>What</b> <b>the</b> Truth Feels Like peaked in the lower regions of the charts. In Italy, the album peaked at number 56 before dropping off the chart the next week. In Japan and South Korea, it peaked at numbers 74 and 75, respectively, despite Stefani's promotional efforts in the former country.|$|E

25|$|In Eastern Orthodox Christianity {{theology}} {{starts with}} the Father hypostasis, not the essence of God, since the Father is the God of the Old Testament.

In Eastern Orthodox theology, God's uncreatedness or being or essence in Greek is called ousia. Jesus Christ is the Son (God Man) of the uncreated Father (God).

In practice, tornadoes are only assigned categories F0 through F5.|$|E
25|$|The {{index of}} a {{differential}} operator {{is closely related}} to the number of independent solutions (more precisely, it is the differences of the numbers of independent solutions of the differential operator and its adjoint). There are many hard and fundamental problems in mathematics that can easily be reduced to the problem of finding the number of independent solutions of some differential operator, so if one has some means of finding the index of a differential operator these problems can often be solved. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Atiyah–Singer index theorem does: it gives a formula for the index of certain differential operators, in terms of topological invariants that look quite complicated but are in practice usually straightforward to calculate.|$|E
25|$|An {{illustration}} {{of the burden of}} proof is given in Howard Marine and Dredging Co Ltd v A Ogden & Sons (Excavations) Ltd, where a shipping company told a client that its barge for hire would hold 1600 tonnes. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Lloyd's Register of ships said. But the ships own documents, accessible to the shipping company, said the barge could only take 1055. The Court of Appeal (Lord Denning MR dissenting) held that in preferring a more convenient source (the Lloyd's Register) over another (the shipping documents), the shipping company had not been reasonable. It was up to the shipping company to positively prove this, and in the circumstances looking to the register was not reasonable. It is likely that a company's own standards and practices will be relevant to what constitutes reasonable grounds for a belief.|$|E

25|$|The Charismatic {{element of}} the Church is seen as being evident {{today as it was}} in the early days of Christianity.

The mission of the Catholic Charismatic Renewal is to educate believers into the totality of the declaration of the gospels. This is done by a personal relationship with Jesus Christ; a one-to-one relationship with Jesus is seen as a possibility by the Charismatic. He is encouraged to talk to Jesus directly and search for what The Lord is saying so that his life will be one with Him; to walk in the Fruit of the Spirit in , <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Charismatic understands by giving their life to Jesus.

25|$|Mandy, Whitworth's step-mother, {{reported}} the Police knocking {{on her door}} to inform her they had found Daniel's body. She says she was led to believe Daniel had overdosed on drugs, despite no investigation having taken place. Police didn't treat the death as suspicious, despite bruising found under Daniel's arms, {{which led to a}} coroner reporting that third-party involvement could not be ruled out. The Police took the fake suicide note left by Port with Daniel's body at face-value. They sent a small fragment of the letter to Mandy and Daniel's father, Adam, asking them to verify if it was Daniel's penmanship. They looked at the writing on the note and compared it with Daniel's writing from Birthday cards and other mementos. They reported back to the Police saying they were unsure if it was Daniel's writing, as they didn't often see his handwriting and they couldn't say for certain. Mandy reported that Dagenham Police had told her they had experts who can analyse the writing and determine whether it is Daniel's or not, and Mandy assumed <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Police would do. It is later shown at trial that Dagenham Police documented that Mandy and Adam had confirmed the handwriting was Daniel's, despite them telling the Police they were unsure. It came to light that handwriting professionals had not investigated the note, but that untrained Police Officers had 'taken a look' at the note themselves. Mandy maintains that if specialists had looked further into this note, they could have found Port earlier.|$|E
