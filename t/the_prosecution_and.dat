5|$|On March 26, 2012 the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania {{rejected}} {{his appeal}} for retrial that asserted, {{based on a}} 2009 report by the National Academy of Science, that forensic evidence presented by <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> <b>and</b> accepted into evidence in the original trial was unreliable. It {{was reported to be}} the former death row inmate's last legal appeal.|$|E
5|$|At {{the appeal}} hearing at the {{regional}} court in Dresden, in the morning 1 July 2009, nine people {{were present in the}} courtroom: three judges, the prosecutor, Wiens as the defendant, his court-appointed defence counsel, El-Sherbini as witness for <b>the</b> <b>prosecution,</b> <b>and</b> her husband and son as observers. No security personnel were present and no security searches of individuals and their possessions were carried out; this was a common procedure for cases without anticipated security concerns or detained persons present.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{information}} available on the allegations was released (officially or unofficially) by <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> <b>and</b> unchallenged by Jackson. Jackson was largely portrayed as guilty by the media. The media bias {{was evident in the}} use of sensational headlines to draw in readers and viewers when the content itself did not support the headline, the purchasing of stories of his alleged criminal activity, the purchasing of confidential leaked material from the police investigation, deliberately using pictures of his appearance at its worst, using headlines that strongly implied his guilt, and a general lack of objectivity.|$|E

5|$|To {{satisfy the}} {{prejudice}} prong of Strickland, a defendant who rejects the prosecution's plea offer must {{show that there}} is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's deficient performance, the offer would have been accepted by the defendant, not withdrawn by <b>the</b> <b>prosecution,</b> <b>and</b> accepted by the court, and that the sentence actually received exceeded that which would have been received under the plea.|$|E
5|$|On Monday, April 4, U.S. Attorney Garret S. Cannon {{took over}} <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> <b>and</b> moved that Jackalow be {{transferred}} to the U.S. Marshall in the Essex County Jail. Voorhies again objected to jurisdiction, arguing that if the alleged murder was committed in the Long Island Sound it could only be tried in New York. Vroom on the other hand held that a showing of probable cause had been made. Further, he argued that he had jurisdiction {{on the grounds that the}} murder was committed between the state of New York and the Norwalk Islands, and Jackalow's robbery had in any case continued until his arrival in Barnegat. Jackalow was remanded to Newark to await the decision of the grand jury.|$|E
5|$|Taylor was {{the first}} Compulsory Process Clause case since Washington v. Texas to provide a {{specific}} limitation {{on the right of}} defendants to force their witnesses to testify. In that case, the Court construed a defendant's right very broadly in his ability to present a defense. Here, however, the Court restricted that ability to comply with court rules, especially if those rules were of equal consequence upon both <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> <b>and</b> the defense. This decision was reached over the dissent of three Justices, all of whom felt a defendant's case should not be limited based on an error solely by the defendant's attorney to list appropriate witnesses.|$|E

5|$|The {{family members}} are afraid to testify at the mock trial and at the real deposition; Buster fakes a coma, Lindsay and Lucille fake {{entering}} rehab, and Gob flees the country to perform in a USO Tour in Iraq. The deceptions are all uncovered by <b>the</b> <b>prosecution,</b> <b>and</b> in Iraq Gob is arrested for inadvertently inciting an anti-US riot. Buster and Michael travel to Iraq to rescue Gob, and while there, uncover evidence that the mini-palaces George Sr. built in Iraq were actually ordered and {{paid for by the}} CIA for wiretapping purposes. After this discovery, the US government drops all of the charges against George Sr. In the general confusion, everyone except George Michael forgets Maeby's sixteenth birthday.|$|E
5|$|The {{witnesses}} took {{ten hours}} to testify, {{during which time}} the court sat continuously. After a short break, the judge began his summing up, taking two hours to charge the jury. The judge urged the jury to put their prejudice at hearing that Thornton had sex with Ashford out of their heads; they were here to determine if Thornton was guilty of the offence charged. He pointed out to the jury the lack of concealment exhibited by Thornton, his admission of the sexual act and of being with Ashford until 4a.m. The judge told them {{it was not possible}} for Thornton to have committed the acts alleged by <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> <b>and</b> still have made it to the Holden farm {{by the time he was}} seen by Heydon, and stressed that Thornton did not act like a man who ran. The judge concluded by reminding the jury that it was better a murderer go free than an innocent man be convicted.|$|E
5|$|However, Nosanchuk {{was still}} not certain that he would attempt to defend Lamb on mental grounds. In Ontario at that time, a {{defendant}} found not guilty under these terms remained imprisoned indefinitely unless an order for his release came from the province's Executive Council, acting {{on the advice of}} a Review Board including a Supreme Court Judge. Yaworsky warned Nosanchuk that even if he used an insanity defence and won, Lamb would probably be committed to an institution for the criminally insane for life. It was still possible for the lawyer to approach <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> <b>and</b> propose a plea bargain, offering to plead guilty to non-capital murder, which would result in life imprisonment for Lamb but allow a parole hearing after 10 years. In any case, Nosanchuk could not use the case he had prepared unless he first received unequivocal written instruction from his client to plead insanity. Having been given a week by his counsel to consider the matter, Lamb wrote to Nosanchuk that he wished to attempt a mental disorder defence. The boy made clear his understanding that if he were found not guilty under these terms, the state still had the right to detain him {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E

5|$|The trial, Illinois vs. August Spies et al., {{began on}} June 21, 1886, {{and went on}} until August 11. The trial was {{conducted}} {{in an atmosphere of}} extreme prejudice by both public and media toward the defendants. It was presided over by Judge Joseph Gary. Judge Gary displayed open hostility to the defendants, consistently ruled for <b>the</b> <b>prosecution,</b> <b>and</b> failed to maintain decorum. A motion to try the defendants separately was denied. The defense counsel included Sigmund Zeisler, William Perkins Black, William Foster, and Moses Salomon. Selection of the jury was extraordinarily difficult, lasting three weeks, and nearly one thousand people called. All union members and anyone who expressed sympathy toward socialism were dismissed. In the end a jury of 12 was seated, most of whom confessed prejudice towards the defendants. Despite their professions of prejudice Judge Gary seated those who declared that despite their prejudices they would acquit if the evidence supported it, refusing to dismiss for prejudice. Eventually the peremptory challenges of the defense were exhausted. Frustrated by the hundreds of jurors who were being dismissed, a bailiff was appointed who selected jurors rather than calling them at random. The bailiff proved prejudiced himself and selected jurors who seemed likely to convict based on their social position and attitudes toward the defendants. The prosecution, led by Julius Grinnell, argued that since the defendants had not actively discouraged the person who had thrown the bomb, they were therefore equally responsible as conspirators. The jury heard the testimony of 118 people, including 54 members of the Chicago Police Department and the defendants Fielden, Schwab, Spies and Parsons. Albert Parsons' brother claimed there was evidence linking the Pinkertons to the bomb. This reflected a widespread belief among the strikers.|$|E
25|$|A {{standard}} {{trial began}} with the charges being read, the defendant giving his plea, and opening statements by <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> <b>and</b> defense attorneys. Witness testimony then began, followed by closing statements given by <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> <b>and</b> defense attorneys, and the jury's decision. If the defendant was found guilty, then the sentencing ensued. Trials were held from 08:00 to 15:00 daily or during daylight hours, whichever was later. The twenty cases were divided into three parts by the war department for administrative convenience.|$|E

25|$|Five {{months after}} Nodder had been {{formally}} {{charged with the}} murder of Mona Tinsley, he appeared at Nottingham Assizes to be tried for her murder. His second trial began on 22 November 1937, and again saw Norman Birkett appear on behalf of <b>the</b> <b>prosecution,</b> <b>and</b> Maurice Healy on behalf of the defence. Healy again argued his client had no motive to commit the murder. Nodder himself testified at this second trial, claiming that he had not seen Mona after he had placed her on a bus at Worksop, with view to her visiting her aunt in Sheffield. In response to questioning from both <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> <b>and</b> defence, Nodder denied killing the child, and alleged she had been murdered by an unknown individual after he had last seen her.|$|E
