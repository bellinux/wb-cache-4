In order to obtain a high quality product, {{it is very important}} to control the heat transferred to each piece of dough during baking. This paper proposes an innovative, non-distorting, low cost wireless temperature measurement system, called “eBiscuit”, which, due to its size, format and location in the metal rack conveyor belt in the oven, is able to measure the temperature a real biscuit experience while baking. The temperature conditions inside the oven are over 200 °C for several minutes, which could damage the “eBiscuit” electronics. This paper compares several thermal insulating materials that can be used in order to avoid exceeding the maximum operational conditions (80 °C) in the interior of the “eBiscuit.

40|$|This work {{presents}} {{the design of}} a computer controlled pilot production plant capable of manufacturing hybrid braided/pultruded rod on a continuous basis. The current product design utilizes a high modulus carbon fiber core with a braided over-wrap composed of various materials. Production is accomplished in three phases: core fiber sorting and impregnation, 2 D braiding, and resin curing. On-line impregnation of the core strands is accomplished using a pressure-fed impregnation ring. Deposition of the 2 D braid is performed by a Maypole braider. Curing of the resin is accomplished using a novel two phase method. An induction heater first increases the temperature of steel wires embedded in the rod core. Next three <b>tunnel</b> <b>ovens</b> provide heat flux to the exterior of the rod. A caterpillar-type puller is used to advance the rod through the process. Prior to this work production was accomplished by manually adjusting machinery operating parameters through controls distributed throughout the production facility. This led to inconsistent quality product. The modifications to production equipment and the development of an automation system which allow one to improve. The modifications to production equipment and the development of an automation system which allow to improve product quality are the main topics of this work. The automation system is based on a PC equipped with several data acquisition cards. A global controller calculates machine set points based on product specifications and measured production rate. Cascade controllers are tasked to regulate machine operations about these set points. The rotational speed of the braider head and puller are monitored using incremental encoders and are under set point element and integral control. The resin flow rate is estimated from weight measurement of the resin reservoir. To regulate the resin dispensing process a calibration curve is used as a set point elements while disturbances are rejected using integral control. The curing oven temperatures are monitored using thermocouples. The oven temperatures are regulated using gain scheduled PI controllers. The modification to the production equipment and the development of the automation system allowed for significant improvements in the product quality...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{analysis}} and design of microwave ovens used in the food industry. Such analysis is desirable in order to optimize {{the performance of the}} ovens and to reduce the time and expenses of developing new or improved ovens. The initial electromagnetic analysis is performed using the Finite Difference Time Domain method (FDTD) and it is shown that even relatively large installations, such as multi-applicator <b>tunnel</b> <b>ovens,</b> can be readily analyzed on inexpensive PCs. To enable thermal simulations, used to find the temperature distribution within the food products, a simple but efficient magnetron model is presented. Using this model the magnetron output power can be modelled as a function of e. g. the position of the food load within the oven or of permittivity changes in the food. The problem of process optimization is addressed and it is shown that due to the long computation times when using FDTD, more efficient analysis tool are required. For this purpose a moment method (MM) code, based on an integral equation formulation for multilayer structures, is presented for a specific type of oven. This code is able to calculate the field distribution in a multilayer food load in less than a minute, which makes it possible to run hundreds of simulations in a reasonable time in search for the optimal oven design. To be able to classify the quality, or performance, of a specific oven the concept of cost functions is introduced. The cost functions assign a figure of merit to the field distribution within the oven, and serve as a measure of how close the field generated by the oven comes to the desired field distribution. We use two different cost functions, one that will produce a maximally uniform field, by minimizing the difference between the hottest and coldest part of the food, and one that will suppress the horizontal component of the electric field in order to minimize overheating of the edges of the food. Throughout this thesis, a reoccurring topic is that of edge overheating, i. e. the fact that sharp edges of high-permittivity food products often tend to be excessively heated when using microwaves. The edge overheating effect is analyzed in detail using the Multiple Multipole Program (MMP). We show that the main factors governing edge overheating are the polarization of the incident field, the curvature and angle of the edges, and the presence of other scatterers {{in the vicinity of the}} edge...|$|E
40|$|Within this thesis, an {{experimental}} and numerical study {{was performed on}} cooling of a 5 x 5 in-line tube bank placed within a duct using impinging jets. The Reynolds numbers investigated using the main inlet as reference were Re~ 2300 and Re~ 4500. The Reynolds number corresponding to the impinging jets was Re~ 147000. The aim {{of the study was}} to replicate the thermal conditions in an industrial tunnel kiln used for production of cylindrical objects. As the current cooling was fairly unknown due to difficulties in conducting proper measurements a miniature <b>tunnel</b> <b>oven</b> model had been built. The experimental part of the thesis was done on said miniature <b>tunnel</b> <b>oven</b> model which was at the time located at Gävle University (HiG). Prior to collecting the cooling data, an extensive groundwork was performed e. g. leakage test, jet and inlet velocity studies. The velocity measurements were conducted using a hot-wire anemometer. The simulation part was conducted using computational fluid dynamics simulations (CFD). A pre-study was performed in order to study the effect of using different settings in the CFD-setup. The study resulted in the use of steady RANS together with k – ω SST as turbulence model. First order schemes were used except for the energy equation which used second order. A mesh independence study was performed and showed a better agreement to experiments with the increase in mesh density. The experimental and numerical results showed good resemblance to each other for both the temperature and the heat transfer coefficient of the cylinders. The average deviation of the simulations to the experiments were 8. 3 % and 11. 0 % for the cylinder temperature and heat transfer coefficient respectively. By studying the obtained temperature and heat transfer coefficient contours obtained through ANSYS a more evenly distributed cooling was obtained by placing the impinging jets between cylinders compared to directly facing cylinders in a cylinder package. This was also apparent by observing the obtained results from the experimental study...|$|R
40|$|Wood {{packaging}} materials (WPM) {{are known to}} be important potential vectors of exotic organisms, some of which turn into major ecological or socio-economic problems in regions where they are introduced. At present, the heating and methyl bromide fumigation of WPM are the only sanitary treatments approved under ISPM 15 (FAO 2002). Since both methods present noticeable disadvantages, the use of microwaves for the disinfestation of WPM is a very attractive alternative. Therefore, pallet components (22 mm-thick pine planks) artificially infested with larvae of Hylotrupes bajulus (Col., Cerambycidae) were treated in a continuous conveying tunnel design of 4 kW microwave oven. Posttreatment surface and inside emperatures of the planks were strongly correlated. As expected from the literature, all larvae exposed to inside plank temperatures exceeding 55 °C died. Surface temperatures higher than 60 °C guaranteed these lethal conditions inside the wood, whatever its moisture content. Those observations thus suggest that treatment effectiveness could be controlled through the measurement of the planks’ surfacetemperatures. Although further experiments are needed, irradiation of 22 mm-thick pine planks in a continuously supplied 28. 8 kW microwave oven confirmed the appeal of this monitoring strategy. If successful treatment control is demonstrated whatever the characteristics of the planks (thickness, basic density, species, MC,...), the proposed monitoring strategy, which can be integrated in an assembly line provided with a <b>tunnel</b> <b>oven,</b> can be a significant step towards the recognition of microwave irradiation as an acceptable treatment for eradication of pests and pathogens in WPM.

40|$|State-of-the-art {{friction}} {{materials for}} applications in disc brake systems are constituted by composite materials, specifically formulated to ensure proper friction and wear performances, under the sliding contact conditions of braking events. The bases of typical friction compound formulations usually include 10 to 30 different components bonded with a polymeric binder cross-linked in situ. Main requests {{to be fulfilled}} during braking are an adequate friction efficiency and enough mechanical resistance to withstand the torque generated by forces acting on the disc brake. Generally, each component confers distinctive properties to the mixture and their primary function can be classified in the following categories: binders confer mechanical strength to friction material guaranteeing pad compactness during use, abrasives increase friction efficiency and improve compound wear resistance, solid lubricants are responsible for stabilizing friction coefficient and contrasting the build-up effect, reinforcements increase mechanical strength improving wear minimization and stabilization. Furthermore, other modifying components such as fillers and functionalizers are involved which are {{not directly related to}} friction efficiency, e. g. cheap materials, pigments, etc. Organic brake pads for disc-brake applications are based on phenolic resin binders, generally it requires three main manufacturing steps: raw material blending, where friction compound components are mixed by blenders. Hot-molding, where blended friction mix is pressed against a metallic support at controlled high pressure (> 2 kN/cm 2), temperature (150 - 200 °C) and pressing time (3 - 10 minutes). Brake pads post-curing, to complete the hardening of polymeric binder. This last step for phenolic resin is usually performed in a batch convective oven at temperature above 150 °C for 4 - 12 h, or alternatively using a continuous process, such as IR in-line <b>tunnel</b> <b>ovens</b> where the process time is 10 - 15 min, the oven heater temperature is between 500 and 700 °C and brake pad superficial temperature is easily above 300 °C. Such kind of formulations and manufacturing process reflects the generally acknowledged state of the art as regards organic friction materials for passenger cars and light trucks. In this panorama the idea of introducing a completely inorganic binder matrix would represent nowadays an extremely appealing topic in the field considering potential improvements of this alternative approach. The complete elimination of the organic binder would reduce emission of phenol-formaldehyde hazardous derivatives generated at high-temperature e. g. volatile organic compounds, highly toxic polyaromatic hydrocarbons etc… Nature and toxicity of the organic compounds released at high temperature was investigated on brake pads manufacturing and compared with preliminary studies recently published. Introducing an inorganic hydraulically bonded matrix in place of the traditional organic-based binders would lead to a substantial reduction of the total embodied energy and water of brake pads considering low-temperature manufacturing process and inorganic binders properties. Primary production embodied energy for phenolic resin is estimated in the range of 75 - 83 MJ/kg (cradle to gate), while primary production water usage (embodied water) is in the range of 94 - 282 l/kg. As a matter of comparison, examples of the embodied energy for inorganic binders typically used for concrete construction are: Portland cements 4. 9 MJ/kg, fly ash 9. 3 MJ/kg, metakaolin 1. 4 MJ/kg, silica fume 0. 036 1. 4 MJ/kg. The embodied water for these raw materials usually is less than 0. 048 l/kg. Well-known properties of such peculiar inorganic materials exploiting the hydraulic activity of binders when exposed to water or alkaline environment. The only energy demanding compound was the alkaline solution (e. g. for sodium hydroxide and sodium silicate the embodied energy is respectively of 22 MJ/kg and 16 MJ/kg). New brake pad manufacturing process allowed the substitution of commonly implied highly energy-consuming procedures with low-temperatures steps. Friction material components except binders were blended together with conventional plow-blade blender forming a dry friction-mix, then this dry friction-mix is blended with the inorganic binder and water or alkaline activators in a planetary mixer forming a wet friction-mix. Eventually wet friction mix is cold-pressed onto a metal back-plate without the need for further treatments at high temperature. It immediately emerges the energetic benefit connected to the manufacturing process of this inorganic binder-based brake pads. After brake pad production, the behavior of these inorganic materials was compared to traditional phenolic-based friction materials. Brake pads were tested on a full scale automotive brake dynamometer and on a real vehicle (in terms of performance and particle emission) following custom and international standard procedures. The aim of this work was to produce brake pad prototypes with friction material based on an inorganic hydraulic binder at performance comparable to commercial brake pads with organic-matrix based friction materials. The results obtained so far resulted particularly promising and paved the way to further developments of these novel class of friction materials. ...|$|E

40|$|Microwave heating was {{recently}} {{approved by the}} FAO as a significantly effective phytosanitary treatment for wood packaging material. According to ISPM 15 (FAO 2009), the target organisms are eradicated if a temperature higher than 60 °C is maintained for 60 s across the entire profile of the board (i. e. 60 °C/ 60 s). A study using pallet boards {{was carried out in}} order to set up a treatment program that would meet ISPM 15 requirements in terms of wood temperature and insect mortality. A 4 m-long industrial <b>tunnel</b> <b>oven</b> (maximum power of 28. 8 kW) was used to carry out the experiments. Temperature was measured by means of a VarioCAM® infrared camera. The most relevant results we found were: (i) achieving a temperature of 63. 2 °C (Populus sp.) or 64. 8 °C (Pinus sylvestris L.) on the upper surface of 22 mm-thick boards enabled compliance with FAO requirements (i. e. 60 °C/ 60 s), whatever the moisture content, basic density and initial temperature of the wood (provided the latter exceeded 0 °C); (ii) larvae > 150 mg represented the most microwave-resistant life stage of Hylotrupes bajulus L.; (iii) the mortality rate of the larvae was influenced by the moisture content of the boards. Using the Gompertz model, we estimated the upper surface temperature that would be needed to achieve a 99. 99683 % mortality rate (the Probit 9 mortality level of efficacy) for the most microwave-resistant life stage of H. bajulus.

50|$|The use {{of glass}} as a {{building}} material was heralded by The Crystal Palace of 1851, built by Joseph Paxton {{to house the}} Great Exhibition. Paxton's revolutionary new building inspired the public use of glass as a material for domestic and horticultural architecture. In 1832, the British Crown Glass Company (later Chance Brothers) became the first company to adopt the cylinder method to produce sheet glass with the expertise of Georges Bontemps, a famous French glassmaker. This glass was produced by blowing long cylinders of glass, which were then cut along the length and then flattened onto a cast-iron table, before being annealed. Plate glass involves the glass being ladled onto a cast-iron bed, where it is rolled into a sheet with an iron roller. The sheet, still soft, is pushed into the open mouth of an annealing <b>tunnel</b> or temperature-controlled <b>oven</b> called a lehr, down which it was carried by a system of rollers. James Hartley introduced the Rolled Plate method in 1847. This allowed a ribbed finish and was often used for extensive glass roofs such as within railway stations.|$|R
