40|$|Accurate {{temperature}} measurement remains {{a challenge for}} microwave heating of powder materials. We propose a temperature calibration method based on exothermic reactions and the resultant thermal runaway that occurs during microwave heating. The approach was demonstrated on microwave heating of four titanium alloys. Differential scanning calorimetry {{was used to determine}} the <b>threshold</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>temperature</b> for each selected titanium alloy. This served as a standard for the microwave heating of these titanium alloys. Infrared pyrometric {{temperature measurement}}s were then calibrated by comparing the starting temperature of each thermal runaway event with the <b>threshold</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>temperature...</b>|$|E
40|$|The strong {{promotion}} by NO of acetylene cyclotrimerisation to benzene on Pd{ 1   1   1 } {{has been}} investigated by fast XPS, supported by LEED and Δφ data. Islands of NO act to compress co-existing islands of acetylene. The resulting increase in acetylene density dramatically lowers the nominal threshold acetylene coverage required for reaction. In addition, the <b>threshold</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>temperature</b> is reduced from 150 to < 100 K, and increased lateral interactions within the organic domains promote formation of tilted benzene. Co-adsorption of NO with benzene itself accelerates the desorption of both tilted and flat-lying benzene at low temperatures. These factors act to increase the yield of reactively formed benzene to 100 %, completely suppressing carbon deposition that would otherwise result from decomposition of reactant and product...|$|E

40|$|The {{formation}} of hydrocarbon species during the methanol to olefins (MTO) reaction over zeolite H-SSZ- 13 has been systematically studied at <b>reaction</b> <b>temperatures</b> between 573 and 723 K {{with a combination}} of operando UV-vis spectroscopy and online gas chromatography. It was found that the applied <b>reaction</b> <b>temperature</b> influences the rate and nature of coke formation as well as the catalyst stability. Correlation between all hydrocarbon species formed inside the catalyst pores with the activity and deactivation of H-SSZ- 13 zeolite material was established. By using a multivariate analysis, we found that the nature of the active and deactivating species varies with the <b>reaction</b> <b>temperature.</b> The majority of active hydrocarbon pool species at low <b>reaction</b> <b>temperatures</b> (i. e., 573 - 598 K) are methylated benzene carbocations, while at high <b>reaction</b> <b>temperatures</b> (i. e., 623 - 723 K) methylated naphthalene carbocations become dominant. At low <b>reaction</b> <b>temperatures</b> the deactivation occurs because of the pore filling with methylated naphthalene carbocations. In contrast, at higher <b>reaction</b> <b>temperatures</b> the {{formation of}} phenanthrene, pyrene carbocations, and highly conjugated polyaromatics during the deactivation increases.

30|$|The {{change in}} the <b>reaction</b> <b>temperature</b> plays a {{pronounced}} {{change in the}} glycerol conversion and the selectivity of the desired product glycerol carbonate. The effect of <b>reaction</b> <b>temperature</b> on the product distribution during carbonolysis reaction is shown in Table  3. The increase in <b>reaction</b> <b>temperature</b> from 140 to 160  °C yields increases in the selectivity of glycerol carbonate from 64 to 83  % with substantial increase in glycerol conversion from 56 to 91  %, respectively. The raise of <b>reaction</b> <b>temperature</b> further by 20  °C led {{to a decline in}} the selectivity of the glycerol carbonate to 46  % at glycerol conversion of 67  %. Furthermore, the selectivity to glycidol is also increased to 41  % at the expenses of glycerol carbonate. This may be due to decarboxylation of glycerol carbonate at higher temperature (160  °C). The above results clearly suggest that moderate <b>reaction</b> <b>temperatures</b> are suitable to achieve best catalytic properties during carbonolysis of glycerol.|$|R
30|$|<b>Reaction</b> <b>temperature</b> {{would also}} have obvious effects on activity, selectivity, and {{stability}} of biocatalysts including whole cells and enzymes, and even reaction rate and equilibrium as well. As shown in Fig.  4 b, within the tested temperature range from 20 to 45  °C, (S)-DHTP was prepared with high optical purity over 99.9 % e.e. However, the yield of the product was improved {{with the increase of}} <b>reaction</b> <b>temperature</b> from 20 to 40  °C, and higher temperature above 40  °C led to a sharp drop in the yield, which would be attributed to partial inactivation of the enzyme at a relatively higher <b>reaction</b> <b>temperature.</b> Therefore, the <b>reaction</b> <b>temperature</b> at 40  °C was considered as the favorable factor for CR 2 -L-GDH catalyzing DKTP reduction.|$|R
