The way I worked it out, {{it was to be}} me or Ken MacLeay and I knew I had a few years {{experience}} on him, having played Tests and more Sheffield Shield. This is the biggest thrill apart from my 1981 Test selection in England and helping bring back the Sheffield Shield to NSW last year.|$|E
25|$|If I had {{not heard}} long ago from other people {{that you were a}} fool, I might now have known it of myself, since you <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> sitting in an empty jug, and went to cover it up with your hand, as if you had me caught. I don't think you worth the trouble, or I would have given you, long since, such a lesson, that you should {{remember}} me long enough. But before long you will get a slight ducking.|$|E
25|$|In a 2005 {{interview}} with Pearce, he recalls the event:This {{has to do}} with politics, not to do with me because they had a local election and they <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to bring an army of skinheads to Lausanne and destroy the city. Because they've heard from someone in Germany who contacted a policeman in Bern. And the policeman in Bern contacted the authorities in Lausanne. This is like gossip. This is like fishwives. This is like old women. I don't care about old women gossiping. If {{at the end of the}} day, it means I don't play, good, I don't want to play in the city of old women talking about people behind their backs. And they are so stupid they believe in all the rumours.|$|E

25|$|E: As I lay in {{bed that}} night, I overheard the three doctors tell my parents {{in the other room}} that their boy would be dead in the morning. I felt intense anger that anyone should tell a mother her boy would be dead by morning. My mother then came in with as serene a face as can be. I asked her to arrange the dresser, push it up {{against the side of the}} bed at an angle. She did not {{understand}} why, she <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> delirious. My speech was difficult. But at that angle by virtue of the mirror on the dresser I could see through the doorway, through the west window of the other room. I was damned if I would die without seeing one more sunset. If I had any skill in drawing, I could still sketch that sunset.|$|E
25|$|As {{time went}} by, Bradbury tended to dismiss {{censorship}} as a chief motivating factor for writing the story. Instead he usually {{claimed that the}} real messages of Fahrenheit 451 were {{about the dangers of}} an illiterate society infatuated with mass media and the threat of minority and special interest groups to books. In the late 1950s, Bradbury recounted:In writing the short novel Fahrenheit 451, I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> describing a world that might evolve in four or five decades. But only a few weeks ago, in Beverly Hills one night, a husband and wife passed me, walking their dog. I stood staring after them, absolutely stunned. The woman held in one hand a small cigarette-package-sized radio, its antenna quivering. From this sprang tiny copper wires which ended in a dainty cone plugged into her right ear. There she was, oblivious to man and dog, listening to far winds and whispers and soap-opera cries, sleep-walking, helped up and down curbs by a husband who might just as well not have been there. This was not fiction.|$|E

500|$|Critics have {{commented on}} the character's {{depiction}} as an anarchist since his first appearance. According to Alan Grant, anarchists with whom he associated were angered by his creation of the character, seeing it {{as an act of}} recuperation for commercial gain. Neither Grant nor Breyfogle could fully agree with this criticism. As Grant put it, [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> doing them a favour you know?" ...|$|E
500|$|Finn was {{promoted}} to chief petty officer (E-7, the highest enlisted rank in the Navy at that time) in 1935 after only nine years of active duty. He later commented on his promotions, [...] "Everybody <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a boy wonder. I {{was just in the}} right place at the right time." [...] As a chief, Finn served with patrol squadrons in San Diego, Washington, and Panama.|$|E

500|$|Witherspoon's {{performance}} as Tracy Flick received widespread critical acclaim, {{as well as}} her first Golden Globe Award nomination and several other accolades. However, she later said that her career struggles continued after Election due to public confusion between the character and the actress. [...] "I'm not Tracy Flick. I couldn't get jobs for a year after that because people <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> that crazy and angry and controlling and strange. But yeah, um, I'm not." ...|$|E
500|$|Albini met {{the band}} that evening, and they {{discussed}} how the next record should sound and be recorded. According to Albini, [...] " [...] {{were in the}} studio the next day." [...] Paul Kolderie, who had worked at Fort Apache Studios with Smith, recommended the Boston recording studio Q Division to Albini. This created tension between Smith and Kolderie, and Kolderie later remarked that [...] "Gary almost killed me for the suggestion, he <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> scheming to get the project." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2014, PBS Frontline interviewed Risen and Lichtblau, {{who said}} that the newspaper's plan was to not publish the story at all. [...] "The editors were furious at me", Risen said to the program. [...] "They <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> being insubordinate." [...] Risen wrote a book about the mass {{surveillance}} revelations after The New York Times declined the piece's publication, and only released it after Risen told them that he would publish the book. Another reporter told NPR that the newspaper [...] "avoided disaster" [...] by ultimately publishing the story.|$|E

500|$|Originally, {{the episode}} was not {{planned to be}} {{produced}} during the seventh season. However, just before the writing crew prepared to take their Christmas break, one of the scheduled scripts {{was removed from the}} line-up. In order to meet the deadline, Frank Spotnitz, John Shiban, and Vince Gilligan decided to write a script about [...] "modern medicine versus backyards supernatural arts". Gilligan later joked that [...] "I think I was enlisted for the fact that I'm Southern, and they <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> the closest thing they had to a hillbilly on the staff".|$|E
500|$|In {{the weeks}} that {{followed}} the premiere Renoir reduced the film's running time from its original 113 minutes to 100 minutes, then to 90 minutes and finally to 85 minutes. He told Margurite Renoir and Zwobada to cut the scenes that the audience had found the most upsetting. Renoir said he mostly cut his own scenes or dialogue [...] "as though I were ashamed, after this rebuff, of showing myself on the screen." [...] He later defended his own performance as being awkwardthe way Octave should have been. The reduction in length removed Octave's complexity and completely changed the character's motives {{at the end of the}} film. In the 85 minute version Octave does not intend to run away with Christine and merely lends AndrÃ© his coat for warmth before sending him out to the greenhouse. The omission of this plot point resulted in the misconception that the film has an alternative ending; this was first reported by Roger Manvell after he watched it at its London premiere in 1946. At one point Jean Jay told Renoir to restore the film to the 100-minute version [...] "to avoid commercial disaster", but none of the shorter versions improved its reception or attendance figures. When asked about the film's poor reception with audience members, Renoir said [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> gentle with them, and they <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> laughing at them." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1995, Pei {{was hired}} to design an {{extension}} to the Deutsches Historisches Museum, or German Historical Museum in Berlin. Returning {{to the challenge of}} the East Building of the US National Gallery, Pei worked to combine a modernist approach with a classical main structure. He described the glass cylinder addition as a [...] "beacon", and topped it with a glass roof to allow plentiful sunlight inside. Pei had difficulty working with German government officials on the project; their utilitarian approach clashed with his passion for aesthetics. [...] "They <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> nothing but trouble", he said.|$|E

500|$|Following an eleven-year hiatus {{producers}} asked Dennis {{to return}} to Neighbours for the 20th anniversary episodes. But their talks resulted in Dennis agreeing to return full-time. Alan Dale who played his on-screen father, Jim Robinson helped Dennis {{to make the decision}} to return. Dennis has since admitted that he made a mistake quitting Neighbours in 1992. He explained [...] "I was stupid. I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to go to Hollywood and conquer the world, and I didn't." [...] Dennis' return made Paul the only original character still appearing on Neighbours. The actor continued to publicise his commitment to staying on the show long-term.|$|E

I want to continue to help women." [...] She published three more articles in the Guardian and began work on a new book, Writing America: How Novelists Invented and Gendered a Nation, on the role of novelists such as Ernest Hemingway and William Faulkner in the development of American political and cultural identity, which was left unfinished when she died.|$|E

Largely because of Louis' early interpretation of the standards and ethics of the newspaper business, I came to look with interest and confidence on the writing fraternity ... I did receive an intensive education on this trip, and Louis Howe played a great part in this education from that time on.|$|E
