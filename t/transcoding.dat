25|$|Content may be transcoded by {{the server}} {{before it is}} streamed, {{in order to reduce}} {{bandwidth}} requirements or for compatibility with the device being streamed to. This way, <b>transcoding</b> allows media to be available on the widest range of clients possible over any connection, while without <b>transcoding</b> clients {{would not be able to}} read the format because lacking the proper codec or because of performances restrictions.|$|E
25|$|The <b>transcoding</b> {{feature is}} {{reported}} to not have a good downmixing of 5.1 sources to 2.1.|$|E
25|$|Encoding and <b>transcoding</b> {{video and}} audio from one format to another. Command-line {{utilities}} afconvert (to convert audio formats), avconvert (to convert video formats) and qtmodernizer (to automatically convert older formats to H.264/AAC) are provided with macOS for power users.|$|E
50|$|Style Jukebox {{cloud-based}} services automatically <b>transcodes</b> formats {{to match the}} device's supported formats. For example, a 320kbit/s WMA is <b>transcoded</b> to 320kbit/s MP3 on iOS devices and FLAC lossless is <b>transcoded</b> to WMA lossless on Windows Phone devices.|$|R
5000|$|WMV, ASF, MPEG 1 & 2, and AVI can be <b>transcoded</b> {{into the}} {{supported}} MPX format. The [...]mpx format {{is based on}} the mp4 format. It is unclear what codec it uses for both video and audio. The <b>transcoded</b> files are <b>transcoded</b> to the exact size of the screen to ensure minimum file size.|$|R

For example, an image processing engine {{might be a}} small ARM7TDMI core combined with a coprocessor that has specialised operations to support {{a specific set of}} HDTV <b>transcoding</b> primitives.|$|E
25|$|The {{synchronization}} does support filters. The {{user can}} sync everything, limit based on duration on movies already watched or media {{that has just}} been added. The synchronization is quite smart with the server already <b>transcoding</b> files when similar content has been watched or already synced.|$|E
25|$|On August 3, 2012, Plex {{announced}} {{support for}} Samsung TV and Blu-ray players. The app includes native support for external SRT subtitles without <b>transcoding,</b> and 3D support. Samsung Smart TV / and Blu-ray players (C-Series / D-Series / E(S)-Series / F-Series / H-Series) are supported.|$|E
50|$|<b>Transcode,</b> or Transmission Code, is a {{no longer}} used 6-bit plus parity BCD {{character}} set {{which was used}} by IBM {{for a short time}} for Binary Synchronous communications. The IBM 2780 data transmission terminal was announced with <b>Transcode</b> support in 1967. The IBM 3780 data communication terminal, the 2780 successor announced in 1972, dropped <b>Transcode</b> support.|$|R
50|$|For users {{wanting to}} be able to re-encode audio into any format, and for digital audio editing, it is best to retain a master copy in a {{lossless}} format (such as FLAC, ALAC, TTA, WavPack, and others) that take around half the storage space needed when compared to original uncompressed PCM formats (such as WAV, and AIFF), as lossless formats usually have the added benefit of having meta data options, which are either completely missing or very limited in PCM formats. These lossless formats can be <b>transcoded</b> to PCM formats or <b>transcoded</b> directly from one lossless format to another lossless format, without any loss in quality. They can be <b>transcoded</b> into a lossy format, but these copies will then not be able to be <b>transcoded</b> into another format of any kind (PCM, lossless, or lossy) without a subsequent loss of quality.|$|R
50|$|The PAL TV signals may be <b>transcoded</b> {{to or from}} SECAM.|$|R
25|$|The {{feature is}} {{especially}} useful when travelling offline {{or without a}} broadband connection. The user can sync partially its movies, music or photos collection to their device, in a format readable by the latter (see <b>Transcoding).</b> View progression of episodes are synced back to the Plex Media Server when a connection is available again.|$|E
25|$|The {{term was}} popularized by {{its use in}} the first Soviet commercially {{available}} UUCP and TCP/IP network, RELCOM (a typical networking software package included Cyrillic KOI-8 to Volapuk <b>transcoding</b> utilities called tovol and fromvol, originally implemented by Vadim Antonov), making it the likely origin of the usage of Volapuk as applied to Cyrillic encoding.|$|E
25|$|On May 14, 2011, Plex {{announced}} {{support for}} Linux. Three Linux flavors were initially supported: Ubuntu 10.01, Slackware 13.1 used in unRAID NAS devices, and ReadyNAS (NAS from Netgear using Intel CPUs). It should also work for other GNU Linux distribution or versions, as the C++ code is highly portable {{and the only}} hard dependency is Avahi for Bonjour-based network discovery. The Linux version of Plex Media Server is reported to work on CPUs of any speed (except if the user wants <b>transcoding)</b> and the resident daemon only eats 16MB of RAM.|$|E
25|$|The Windows {{version of}} iTunes can {{automatically}} <b>transcode</b> DRM-free WMA (including version 9) files to other audio formats, {{but does not}} support playback of WMA files and will not <b>transcode</b> DRM protected WMA files. Telestream, Inc. provides free codecs for Mac users of QuickTime to enable playback of unprotected Windows Media files. These codecs are recommended by Microsoft.|$|R

25|$|During the {{rendering}} process, {{the filter}} graph searches the Windows Registry for registered filters and builds its graph of filters {{based on the}} locations provided. After this, it connects the filters together, and, at the developer's request, executes (i.e., plays, pauses, etc.) the created graph. DirectShow filter graphs are widely used in video playback (in which the filters implement functions such as file parsing, video and audio demultiplexing, decompressing and rendering) {{as well as for}} video and audio recording, editing, encoding, <b>transcoding</b> or network transmission of media. Interactive tasks such as DVD navigation may also be controlled by DirectShow.|$|E
25|$|Even if Plex {{came from}} Kodi, these Plex plugins now use a {{proprietary}} plugin architecture. They {{are written in}} Python and XML. Many plug-ins for Plex Media Server leverage WebKit to display videos from online sources using the same Adobe Flash and Silverlight players that the sources provide for web browsers. This basically means that the server needs to render the streaming video on an offscreen WebKit canvas before capturing it, <b>transcoding</b> it and streaming it to the server. This software chain sometimes causes issues depending on the server configuration, and on the version of the app in the software chain.|$|E
25|$|The Zen Portable Media Center, {{announced}} on January 8, 2004 and released eight months later, {{is based on}} Microsoft's Portable Media Center interface, runs Windows Mobile and supports WMV, WMA, and MP3, and can display JPEG images; other video formats are supported through <b>transcoding.</b> This device {{was the first to}} exclusively support Microsoft's Media Transfer Protocol, and was presented at the Consumer Electronics Show in 2004, winning the TechTV Best of CES Award in the Portable Audio and Video category. The player uses a 1.8-inch 20 or 40GB hard drive from Hitachi. The Zen Portable Media Center has been replaced by the ZEN Vision and the ZEN Vision W.|$|E
40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{expanding}} of {{the integration of}} telecommunications networks, cable TV networks and the internet, the efficient and energy-saving video <b>transcode</b> service platform is in great demand. Such a platform together with workload prediction is proposed in this paper.
