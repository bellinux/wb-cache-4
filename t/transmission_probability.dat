50|$|Assuming no {{scattering}} {{and ideal}} (transparent) contacts, the conductance of the one-dimensional system {{is given by}} G = G0NT, where T is the probability that an electron will be transmitted along the channel, N {{is the number of}} the channels available for transport, and G0 is the conductance quantum 2e2/h = (12.9kΩ)−1. Perfect contacts, with reflection R = 0, and no back scattering along the channel result in <b>transmission</b> <b>probability</b> T = 1 and the conductance of the system becomes G = (2e2/h) N. Thus each channel contributes 2G0 to the total conductance.For metallic armchair nanotubes, there are two subbands, which cross the Fermi level, and for semiconducting nanotubes - bands which don’t cross the Fermi level. Thus there are two conducting channels and each band accommodates two electrons of opposite spin. Thus the value of the conductance is G = 2G0 = (6.45 kΩ)−1.|$|E

This happens when the scattering length in the nanotube is much greater than the distance between the contacts.If a carbon nanotube is a ballistic conductor, but the contacts are nontransparent, the <b>transmission</b> <b>probability,</b> T, is reduced by back-scattering in the contacts. If the contacts are perfect, the reduced T is due to back-scattering along the nanotube only.When the resistance measured at the contacts is high, one can infer the presence of Coulomb blockade and Luttinger liquid behavior for different temperatures.

50|$|One {{issue with}} {{utilizing}} SWCNTs for the photoactive layer of PV devices is the mixed purity when synthesized (about 1/3 metallic and 2/3 semiconducting). Metallic SWCNTs (m-SWCNTs) can cause exciton recombination between the electron and hole pairs, and the junction between metallic and semiconducting SWCNTs (s-SWCNTs) form Schottky barriers that reduce the hole <b>transmission</b> <b>probability.</b> The discrepancy in electronic structure of synthesized CNTs requires electronic sorting to separate {{and remove the}} m-SWCNTs to optimize the semiconducting performance. This may be accomplished through diameter and electronic sorting of CNTs through a density gradient ultracentrifugation (DGU) process, involving a gradient of surfactants that can separate the CNTs by diameter, chirality, and electronic type. This sorting method enables the separation of m-SWCNTs and the precise collection of multiple chiralities of s-SWCNTs, each chirality able to absorb a unique wavelength of light. The multiple chiralities of s-SWCNTs are used as the hole transport material along with the fullerene component PC71BM to fabricate heterojunctions for the PV active layer. The polychiral s-SWCNTs enable a wide range optical absorption from visible to near-infrared (NIR) light, increasing the photo current relative to using single chirality nanotubes. To maximize light absorption, the inverted device structure was used with a zinc oxide nanowire layer penetrating the active layer to minimize collection length. Molybdenum oxide (MoOx) was utilized as a high work function hole transport layer to maximize voltage.|$|E

Methods: Adhesion forces of bacterial strains to Ag-impregnated and polypropylene lens cases and a rigid CL were measured using atomic force microscopy. Adhesion forces were used to calculate Weibull distributions, from which <b>transmission</b> <b>probabilities</b> from lens case to CL were derived. <b>Transmission</b> <b>probabilities</b> were compared with actual transmission of viable bacteria from a lens case to the CL in 0. 9 % NaCl and in an antimicrobial lens care solution. Results: Bacterial <b>transmission</b> <b>probabilities</b> from polypropylene lens cases based on force analysis coincided well for all strains with actual transmission in 0. 9 % NaCl. Bacterial adhesion forces on Ag-impregnated lens cases were much smaller than that on polypropylene and CLs, yielding a high <b>probability</b> of <b>transmission.</b> Comparison with actual bacterial transmission indicated bacterial killing due to Ag ions during colony-forming unit transmission from an Ag-impregnated lens case, especially for P. aeruginosa. Transmission of viable bacteria from Ag-impregnated lens cases could be further decreased by use of an antimicrobial lens care solution instead of 0. 9 % NaCl. Conclusions: Bacterial <b>transmission</b> <b>probabilities</b> are higher from Ag-impregnated lens cases than from polypropylene lens cases because of small adhesion forces, but this is compensated for by enhanced bacterial killing due to Ag impregnation, especially when in combination with an antimicrobial lens care solution. This calls for a balanced combination of antimicrobial lens care solutions and surface properties of a lens case and CL. ...|$|R
