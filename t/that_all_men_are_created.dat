25|$|Tensions {{erupted into}} battle between Patriot militia and British regulars when the British {{attempted}} {{to capture and}} destroy Colonial military supplies at Lexington and Concord in April 1775. The conflict then developed into a global war, during which the Patriots (and later their French, Spanish, and Dutch allies) fought the British and Loyalists in {{what became known as}} the American Revolutionary War (1775–83). Each of the thirteen colonies formed a Provincial Congress that assumed power from the old colonial governments and suppressed Loyalism, and from there they built a Continental Army under the leadership of General George Washington. The Continental Congress determined King George's rule to be tyrannical and infringing the colonists' rights as Englishmen, and they declared the colonies free and independent states on July 2, 1776. The Patriot leadership professed the political philosophies of liberalism and republicanism to reject monarchy and aristocracy, and they proclaimed <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>created</b> equal.|$|E
500|$|Like Daniel Webster, James Wilson, and Joseph Story before him, Lincoln {{argued that}} the Declaration of Independence was a {{founding}} document of the United States, and that this had important implications for interpreting the Constitution, which had been ratified {{more than a decade}} after the Declaration. The Constitution did not use the word [...] "equality", yet Lincoln believed that the concept that [...] "all men are created equal" [...] remained a part of the nation's founding principles. He famously expressed this belief in the opening sentence of his 1863 Gettysburg Address: [...] "Four score and seven years ago [...] our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>created</b> equal." ...|$|E

He defined the war as an effort dedicated to these principles of liberty and equality for all. The emancipation of slaves was {{now part of the}} national war effort. He declared that the deaths of so many brave soldiers would not be in vain, that slavery would end {{as a result of the}} losses, and the future of democracy in the world would be assured, that [...] "government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth". Lincoln concluded that the Civil War had a profound objective: a new birth of freedom in the nation.|$|E
500|$|The Senate {{campaign}} {{featured the}} seven Lincoln–Douglas debates of 1858, {{the most famous}} political debates in American history. The principals stood in stark contrast both physically and politically. Lincoln warned that [...] "The Slave Power" [...] was threatening the values of republicanism, and accused Douglas of distorting {{the values of the}} Founding Fathers <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>created</b> equal, while Douglas emphasized his Freeport Doctrine, that local settlers were free to choose whether to allow slavery or not, and accused Lincoln of having joined the abolitionists. The debates had an atmosphere of a prize fight and drew crowds in the thousands. Lincoln stated Douglas' popular sovereignty theory was a threat to the nation's morality and that Douglas represented a conspiracy to extend slavery to free states. Douglas said that Lincoln was defying the authority of the U.S. Supreme Court and the Dred Scott decision.|$|E

In 1860, Congressman Laurence M. Keitt of South Carolina said, [...] "The anti-slavery party contend that slavery is wrong in itself, and the Government is a consolidated national democracy.

[...] Stephen Douglas said that [...] "the negro" [...] Frederick Douglass told [...] "all the friends of negro equality and negro citizenship to rally as one man around Abraham Lincoln."

2500|$|Democracy, social-contract theory, {{separation}} of powers, religious freedom, {{separation of}} church and state – these achievements of the Reformation and early Protestantism were elaborated on and popularized by Enlightenment thinkers. Some of the philosophers of the English, Scottish, German, and Swiss Enlightenment – Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, John Toland, David Hume, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Christian Wolff, Immanuel Kant, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau – had Protestant backgrounds. For example, John Locke, whose political thought was based on [...] "a set of Protestant Christian assumptions", derived the equality of all humans, including the equality of the genders ("Adam and Eve"), from Genesis 1, 26–28. As all persons were created equally free, all governments needed [...] "the consent of the governed." [...] These Lockean ideas were fundamental to the United States Declaration of Independence, which also deduced human rights from the biblical belief in creation: [...] "We hold these truths to be self-evident, <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>created</b> equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness." ...|$|E

2500|$|While Locke {{spoke in}} the {{language}} of natural law, the content of this law was by and large protective of natural rights, and it was this language that later liberal thinkers preferred. Political philosopher Jeremy Waldron has pointed out that Locke's political thought was based on [...] "a particular set of Protestant Christian assumptions." [...] To Locke, the content of natural law was identical with biblical ethics as laid down especially in the Decalogue, Christ's teaching and exemplary life, and St. Paul's admonitions. Locke derived the concept of basic human equality, including the equality of the sexes ("Adam and Eve"), from , the starting-point of the theological doctrine of Imago Dei. One of the consequences is that as all humans are created equally free, governments need the consent of the governed. Thomas Jefferson, arguably echoing Locke, appealed to unalienable rights in the Declaration of Independence, [...] "We hold these truths to be self-evident, <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>created</b> equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness." [...] The Lockean idea that governments need the consent of the governed was also fundamental to the Declaration of Independence, as the American Revolutionaries used it as justification for their separation from the British crown.|$|E
