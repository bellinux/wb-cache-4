These four patients with radiographically progressive metastatic RCC received single-agent oral talactoferrin in daily doses of 9 grams, given in cycles of 2 weeks on/ 2 weeks off, until evidence of toxicity or disease progression. Given the small sample size and the heterogenous tumor biology of RCC, tumor growth rate was used as a primary endpoint so that each patient could serve as their own control. The agent's effectiveness was then determined through radiographic tracking of the tumors before, during, and after treatment, with use of the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) protocol to follow target lesions. The results showed that the drug was well tolerated, with no occurrence of talactoferrin-related grade 3 or 4 adverse events or laboratory anomalies by NCI-CTEP criteria. The four patients described in the case series demonstrated very encouraging progression-free survivals, all exceeding 30 months. We conclude that decreased tumor growth rate may correlate with increased progression-free survival. Talactoferrin is a promising, well-tolerated agent whose clinical benefits should be evaluated in a randomized phase III study with a placebo control arm...|$|E

This phase II/III clinical trial compared talactoferrin with placebo, in addition to standard of care, in patients with severe sepsis. DESIGN: Multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase II/III clinical study. SETTING: Seventy-seven centers in 10 countries. PATIENTS: Adult (> 18 yr) patients admitted to one of the participating centers with severe sepsis who were receiving antimicrobial therapy and able to take liquid medication by mouth or feeding tube. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to receive either talactoferrin (1. 5 g, 15 mL) or placebo three times a day orally or by another enteral route for 28 days or until ICU discharge. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The study was terminated after 305 patients had been enrolled (153 talactoferrin and 152 placebo) because of futility and safety concerns identified by the Data Safety Monitoring Board. There {{were no significant differences between}} groups in baseline characteristics including age, sex, site of infection, and severity scores. Twenty-eight-day mortality was higher in talactoferrin-treated patients although this difference was not statistically significant (24. 8 % vs 17. 8 % placebo; p = 0. 117). The difference was largely the result of differences in patients with shock (talactoferrin, 33 / 105 [31. 4 %] vs placebo, 21 / 104 [20. 2 %]; p = 0. 064); no mortality difference was seen in patients without shock (talactoferrin, 5 / 48 [10. 4 %] vs placebo, 6 / 48 [12. 5 %]; p = 0. 806). In-hospital (43 / 153 [28. 1 %] vs 27 / 152 [17. 8 %]; p = 0. 037) and 3 -month (46 / 153 [30. 1 %] vs 31 / 152 [20. 4 %]; p = 0. 036) mortality rates were significantly higher in talactoferrin-treated patients than in patients in the placebo group. The occurrence of treatment-related adverse or serious adverse events was similar between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of oral talactoferrin was not associated with reduced 28 -day mortality in patients with severe sepsis and may even be harmful...|$|E
