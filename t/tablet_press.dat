5000|$|Capping, {{lamination}} or chipping. This {{is caused}} by air being compressed with the tablet formulation and then expanding when the punch is released: if this breaks the tablet apart, it can be due to incorrect machine settings, or due to incorrect formulation: either because the tablet formulation is too brittle or not adhesive enough, or because the powder being fed to the <b>tablet</b> <b>press</b> contains too much air (has too low bulk density).|$|E
50|$|A <b>tablet</b> <b>press</b> is a {{mechanical}} device that compresses powder into tablets of uniform size and weight. A press {{can be used}} to manufacture tablets {{of a wide variety of}} materials, including pharmaceuticals, illicit drugs such as MDMA, cleaning products, and cosmetics. To form a tablet, the granulated material must be metered into a cavity formed by two punches and a die, and then the punches must be pressed together with great force to fuse the material together.|$|E
50|$|There are 2 {{types of}} tablet presses: single-punch and rotary <b>tablet</b> <b>presses.</b> Most high speed <b>tablet</b> <b>presses</b> {{take the form}} of a {{rotating}} turret that holds any number of punches. As they rotate around the turret, the punches come into contact with cams which control the punch's vertical position. Punches and dies are usually custom made for each application, and can be made in a wide variety of sizes, shapes, and can be customized with manufacturer codes and scoring lines to make tablets easier to break. Depending on tablet size, shape, material, and press configuration, a typical modern press can produce from 250,000 to over 1,000,000 tablets an hour.|$|R
50|$|Dry {{granulation}} can {{be conducted}} under two processes; either a large tablet (slug) {{is produced in}} a heavy duty <b>tabletting</b> <b>press</b> or the powder is squeezed between two counter-rotating rollers to produce a continuous sheet or ribbon of materials (roller compactor, {{commonly referred to as}} a chilsonator which received its name from its inventor, Francis Xavier Chilson).|$|R
50|$|The Kraemer Elektronik tablet testing {{system was}} the first {{automatic}} tablet hardness testing system for auto-regulation at <b>tablet</b> <b>presses.</b> Invented by the german mechanical engineer Mr. Norbert Kraemer in Darmstadt/Germany. The tablets are separated by a feeder chute and moved on a horizontal starwheel through different testing stations. The Kraemer Elektronik automatic tablet testing systems measure weight, thickness, diameter/length, width and hardness of tablets and capsules.|$|R
50|$|When a <b>tablet</b> <b>press</b> is {{used for}} dry granulation, the powders may not possess enough natural flow to feed the product uniformly into the die cavity, {{resulting}} in varying degrees of densification. The roller compactor (granulator-compactor) uses an auger-feed system that will consistently deliver powder uniformly between two pressure rollers. The powders are compacted into a ribbon or small pellets between these rollers and milled through a low-shear mill. When the product is compacted properly, then it can be passed through a mill and final blend before tablet compression.|$|E
50|$|After the {{preparation}} of granules (in case of wet granulation) or sized slugs (in case of dry granulation) or mixing of ingredients (in case of direct compression), they are compressed to get final product. The compression is done either by single punch machine (stamping press) or by multi station machine (rotary press). The <b>tablet</b> <b>press</b> is a high-speed mechanical device. It 'squeezes' the ingredients into the required tablet shape with extreme precision. It can make the tablet in many shapes, although they are usually round or oval. Also, it can press {{the name of the}} manufacturer or the product into the top of the tablet.|$|E
50|$|Tablet {{formulations}} {{are designed}} and tested using a laboratory machine called a Tablet Compaction Simulator or Powder Compaction Simulator. This {{is a computer}} controlled device that can measure the punch positions, punch pressures, friction forces, die wall pressures, and sometimes the tablet internal temperature during the compaction event. Numerous experiments with small quantities of different mixtures can be performed to optimise a formulation.Mathematically corrected punch motions can be programmed to simulate any type and model of production <b>tablet</b> <b>press.</b> Initial quantities of active pharmaceutical ingredients are very expensive to produce, and using a Compaction Simulator reduces the amount of powder required for product development.|$|E

50|$|Dry {{granulation}} processes create granules {{by light}} compaction of the powder blend under low pressures. The compacts so-formed are broken up gently to produce granules (agglomerates). This process {{is often used}} when the product to be granulated is sensitive to moisture and heat. Dry granulation can be conducted on a <b>tablet</b> <b>press</b> using slugging tooling or on a roll press called a roller compactor. Dry granulation equipment offers {{a wide range of}} pressures to attain proper densification and granule formation. Dry granulation is simpler than wet granulation, therefore the cost is reduced. However, dry granulation often produces a higher percentage of fine granules, which can compromise the quality or create yield problems for the tablet. Dry granulation requires drugs or excipients with cohesive properties, and a 'dry binder' may need {{to be added to the}} formulation to facilitate the formation of granules.|$|E
50|$|Tablet presses, {{also called}} {{tableting}} machines, range from small, inexpensive bench-top models that make one tablet {{at a time}} (single-station presses), with only around a half-ton pressure, to large, computerized, industrial models (multi-station rotary presses) that can make hundreds of thousands to millions of tablets an hour with much greater pressure. The <b>tablet</b> <b>press</b> is an essential piece of machinery for any pharmaceutical and nutraceutical manufacturer. Common manufacturers of tablet presses include Natoli, Stokes, Fette Compacting, Korsch, Kikusui, Manesty, B&D, PTK, IMA and Courtoy. Tablet presses must allow the operator to adjust {{the position of the}} lower and upper punches accurately, so that the tablet weight, thickness and density can each be controlled. This is achieved using a series of cams, rollers, and/or tracks that act on the tablet tooling (punches). Mechanical systems are also incorporated for die filling, and for ejecting and removing the tablets from the press after compression. Pharmaceutical tablet presses are required to be easy to clean and quick to reconfigure with different tooling, because they are usually used to manufacture many different products.There are 2 main standards of tablet tooling used in pharmaceutical industry: American standard ‘TSM’ and European standard ‘EU’. TSM and EU configurations are similar to each other but cannot be interchanged.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper was to {{evaluate}} the compressional behavior of granules containing high load of a Phyllanthus niruri spray-dried extract in eccentric (ETM) and rotary (RTM) <b>tablet</b> <b>presses.</b> <b>Tablets</b> were constituted by spray-dried extract granules (SDEG, 92 %), excipient granules (EXCG, 7. 92 %), and magnesium stearate (0. 08 %). SDEG was obtained by dry granulation and EXCG, composed of microcrystalline cellulose (62. 9 %) and sodium starch glycolate (37. 1 %), by wet granulation. Particle size distribution was fixed between 0. 250 and 0. 850  mm. Tablets did not evidence any mechanical failures, such as lamination or capping, or anomalous weight variation in either tablet machine types. Upper and lower tablet surface photomicrographs from ETM and RTM tablets showed differences in porosity and texture. Different RTM speeds suggested the visco-plastic behavior of the formulation, since, by slowing down rotation speeds, the tensile strength of the tablets increased significantly, but the porosity and disintegration time were not affected. Tablets produced in RTM showed lower friability and porosity than ETM tablets, which did not reflect on higher tensile strength. The EXCG distribution at upper and lower surfaces from ETM and RTM tablets was quantified by image analysis and evaluated through statistical methods.

This is an important problem because the recent guidelines of EU require verification of the equal masses of tablet halves. The models of Walker, Heckel, and Kawakita were used to describe the powder densification on the two machines. The calculated parameters revealed that the shorter compression cycle of rotary machines results in poorer densification and lower tablet hardness at a given compression force. This is manifested in poorer halving properties, which are influenced mainly by the hardness. Better densification improves the halving even at lower tablet hardness. This demonstrates that these parameters can be good predictors of tablet halving properties...|$|R
