5|$|Contrary to expectations, the American bombing effort had not {{pulverized}} the Base Areas and {{had only}} tended to drive PAVN and the NLF deeper into the Cambodian countryside. This series of events began to pose questions for Hanoi. The North Vietnamese {{had been willing to}} maintain the status quo in Cambodia as long as their supply lines and sanctuaries were secure. But with the expansion of the war across the border <b>they</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> take further steps to maintain their position.|$|E
5|$|In {{the weeks}} leading up to the Independence Bowl, the game {{received}} as much or more coverage than the incipient national championship game due to the controversial status of Tech star Bruce Smith, who was embroiled in a legal battle with the NCAA about his participation in the game. Spread bettors favored Air Force to win the game by four points. Ticket sales were slow in the {{weeks leading up}} to the bowl, and Virginia Tech was faulted for failing to sell its entire allotment of 12,000 tickets. Tech representatives said <b>they</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> return as many as 8,000 tickets due to the difficulty of selling tickets for a game more than 20 hours away by car.|$|E
5|$|On 4 November 2010, Stabæk Holding {{stated that}} they were near a bankruptcy, and that they {{intended}} to throw out Stabæk as a tenant, remove the turf and instead use the venue exclusively for events. Chair Diderik Schnitler in Stabæk Holding stated that the business model was not sustainable. The football schedule was not made until early in the year, while in the event business, bookings were common {{one to two years}} in advance. It was therefore difficult to secure lucrative events, as large parts of the year had to be held in reserve in case the venue was needed for yet-to-be scheduled matches. The holding company stated that <b>they</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> file for bankruptcy. Stabæk Fotball {{stated that they}} had a 40-year contract to use the venue.|$|E

5|$|Based {{around the}} {{overflow}} of volunteers for the 1st Rhodesia Regiment, {{a core of}} personnel for a second Southern Rhodesian expeditionary unit was in place by November 1914. This was made into the 2nd Rhodesia Regiment (2RR) during December 1914 and January 1915. The 1st Rhodesia Regiment's lack of combat experience thus far influenced those men in Southern Rhodesia who were yet to enlist; many Rhodesian colonials were keen to fight on the front lines, and some resolved that <b>they</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> travel to Europe {{to be sure of}} doing so. Aware of this competition with the Western Front for the colony's manpower, recruiters for the 2nd Rhodesia Regiment took great care to assure potential inductees that they would definitely see combat, in Africa, if they signed up for the new unit. The 2nd Rhodesia Regiment ultimately had a paper strength of 500 men, the same as the 1st. Thirty black scouts, recruited in Southern Rhodesia, were also attached to the regiment.|$|E
5|$|On 9 September, Suwito {{informed}} a British diplomat {{that the}} Strait would be closed for naval exercises {{and that it}} would be appreciated if British warships steered clear of the area in the interim. To Britain, this seemed an escalation of the Crisis, as if the task force sailed through <b>they</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> fight the Indonesian Navy directly, though in fact Indonesia was lessening its resolve to refuse the task force passage through the Strait, and hoped to keep the British from attempting to force their way through via more indirect means. This was not the way the British interpreted it, however, and the announcement triggered a new round of debates over the forced passage. Thorneycroft reviewed the plan with the Foreign Office, Ministry of Defence, and the Commonwealth Relations Office, most of whom told him to consider the opinions of the commanders on site. After remembering the influential Lord Head's endorsement of Begg's views, Thorneycroft was swayed, and decided that the two destroyers should proceed through the Strait without the Victorious, using the aircraft of that vessel and the Centaur for cover. Though worried about the psychological effect of the non-passage of the carrier, he was reminded that Britain had not informed Jakarta that the ship would return that way in the first place.|$|E

25|$|Elizabeth's {{mother died}} in 1828, and is buried at St Michael's Church, Ledbury, next to her {{daughter}} Mary. Sarah Graham-Clarke, Elizabeth's aunt, helped {{to care for the}} children, and she had clashes with Elizabeth's strong will. In 1831 Elizabeth's grandmother, Elizabeth Moulton, died. Following lawsuits and the abolition of slavery Mr Barrett incurred great financial and investment losses that forced him to sell Hope End. Although the family was never poor, the place was seized and put up for sale to satisfy creditors. Always secret in his financial dealings, he would not discuss his situation and the family was haunted by the idea that <b>they</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> move to Jamaica.|$|E
25|$|Treaties {{obtained}} from local chiefs in Africa were not aimed at having them accept their subjugation − superior force did that (just {{as it had}} for the chiefs themselves, earlier) − but were solely to impress on rival colonial powers {{that they had the}} means to convince their own populations of the justice of any military action <b>they</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> take to defend their claim to civilize the area, and that was all that mattered. The idea of democracy was spreading in Europe all throughout the nineteenth century, and, increasingly, governments were required to take account of public opinion. Public opinion in Europe could be a powerful motivator of colonial actions, as the Fashoda Incident a few years later demonstrated.|$|E

25|$|In the past, kinship {{principles}} were {{extended beyond}} the domestic group and {{were used to}} form large-scale groups, such as lineages. Lineages were quite distinct from families; they were essentially corporate economic-political groups. They controlled land and, {{in some areas of}} China, dominated whole villages and sets of villages and held title to most of the farmland. Like most other late traditional associations, lineages were dominated by wealthy and educated elites. Ordinary peasants paid as much of their crop to their lineage group as <b>they</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> a landlord. The Communists denounced these organizations as feudal systems by means of which landlords exploited others. The lineages were suppressed in the early 1950s and their land confiscated and redistributed in the land reform. Communal worship of distant lineage ancestors lost much of its justification with the dissolution of the lineage estate and was easily suppressed over the next several years. Domestic ancestor worship, in which members of a single family worshiped and memorialized their immediate ancestors, continued at least until 1966 and 1967, {{in the early stages of}} the Cultural Revolution, when Red Guards destroyed altars and ancestral tablets. In 1987 the party was still condemning ancestor worship as superstitious but had made little effort to end it.|$|E
500|$|The Trøndelag Council, an {{unofficial}} coordination council consisting {{of representatives from}} Nord-Trøndelag County Municipality, Sør-Trøndelag County Municipality and Trondheim Municipality, originally stated that they wanted a double-track tunnel. In 2006, the Norwegian National Rail Administration stated {{that it was not}} certain that a double-track in a single tunnel would meet European Union regulations, and that <b>they</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> delay construction while looking into the matter. Costs for a double track would be about 50% higher than for a single track. Constructing a second barrel later for the a new track would cost as much as the first barrel. Trøndelag Council member Alf Daniel Moen (Labour) stated that the council abandoned the demand for a double-track tunnel so the airport expansion and tunnel construction could be coordinated and because there was not sufficient funding at the time to build both tracks.|$|E
500|$|After a while, {{an order}} was {{received}} to launch all available fighters. Pilots were {{briefed on the}} national emergency and the potential that <b>they</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> take out an aircraft. At this point, someone then ran {{into the room and}} said that there had been an order that was received from the Northeast Air Defense Sector that all available jets must launch. The pilots then ran out to their aircraft with speaker Treacy saying [...] "Go, go, go!" [...] In the haste that the morning had become, not all the jets had been refueled and a majority of the jets were still unarmed. The handful of jets that were armed were sent up with one or two missiles. The standard missile load involves at least two missiles at launch. This is after the handlers had worked at a [...] "furious pace" [...] and [...] "hurried to fix all available jets with live weapons." [...] Arming of the jets even began fifteen minutes after the South Tower had been hit. this fact would later lend credence to the theory that there was an idea floating around to ram the hijacked planes with a jet. Starting around 10:30 and ending at six that night, all twenty one planes were put into the air.|$|E

500|$|After the war {{he wrote}} that the attack by the 7th Armoured Division should have succeeded and that his doubts about Bucknall and Erskine {{increased}} and that <b>they</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> go. Dempsey called {{the handling of the}} battle a disgrace and said that the decision to withdraw [...] was made by the corps commander and Erskine. Carlo D'Este called Dempsey's comments [...] "excessively harsh" [...] but historians generally support them, suggesting that a great opportunity to swiftly capture Caen had been squandered by Bucknall.John Buckley wrote that Bucknall was not ready to support the attack once problems developed and that Erskine was not capable of mastering the situation. Lionel Ellis wrote that the result was [...] "disappointing" [...] but that the fighting power of the Panzer-Lehr Division and with the unexpected arrival of the 2nd Panzer Division, the 7th Armoured Division [...] "could hardly have achieved full success". Michael Reynolds wrote that the 2nd Panzer Division tanks were nowhere near Villers-Bocage. Hubert Meyer wrote that Operation Perch failed because the 50th Northumbrian Division and its armoured brigade could not overcome the Panzer-Lehr-Division, the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division attack in the east of the bridgehead failed and because of the rapid counter-attack by advanced elements of the 2nd Panzer Division.|$|E
2500|$|Further {{purchases}} {{followed in}} Taranaki (60,000 acres in February 1840) and Wanganui (May 1840, {{the conclusion of}} negotiations begun the previous November); the company explained to the 1842 Land Claims Commission that while the earlier deeds covering the same land {{had been with the}} [...] "overlords", these new contracts were with residents of the lands, to overcome any resistance <b>they</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> yielding physical possession of the land.|$|E
2500|$|The {{prognosis}} for German land forces {{taking part in}} Green was therefore not good. [...] They had no experience of large-scale amphibious warfare; <b>they</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> fight and survive, without resupply, artillery support or screening aerial support, amongst a hostile citizenry. [...] They would have to fight against expected British troop movements from {{the north of the}} island, and from Great Britain invading Ireland to protect its flank. [...] These drawbacks, whilst probably acceptable to Hitler, were not acceptable to Raeder in his considered estimation four months after the plan was first floated. [...] He did not agree that Ireland could become the [...] "backdoor" [...] into Britain with the present strength of German forces.|$|E

2500|$|The {{minority}} {{found that}} even if [...] "living together" [...] {{should be considered a}} legitimate aim within the meaning of paragraph 2 of Articles 8 and 9, the ban was still disproportionate.

For those few who uses the veil, the consequences of a ban {{was on the other side}} large, as <b>they</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> choose between being confined to their home or violating their own religious convictions or cultural practice. The minority said that even if the fine was small, women who used veils would risk multiple fines, and the cumulative effect for the woman had to be considered.|$|E

It soon became physically exhausting and draining [...] I don't think the producers were very happy when I said I wanted to leave. I was still very new and they had just set up the new Watts dynasty but no-one could have made me change my mind. When I said to the producers I wanted to go they told me <b>they</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> recast Vicki. I don't mind. Life goes on and EastEnders goes on.

2500|$|Displaying Aderca's flirtations {{with the}} avant-garde, Aventurile D-lui Ionel Lăcustă-Termidor is a fantasy work, at once {{parabolic}} and sarcastic, {{read as a}} poetic expression of its author's own nonconformity. It evades stylistic conventions, rejects linear time, and, as Cubleșan notes, reacts against modern-day depersonalization; in Crohmălniceanu's words, its [...] "extreme" [...] subjectivity and Expressionist techniques create [...] "an entirely autonomous world". The eponymous hero works as a writer in modern Romania, but has an identity is both ancient and plural: [...] "He is from unmeasured spaces and times, ones about which the human mind {{was not able to}} state anything other than that <b>they</b> <b>might</b> <b>have,</b> <b>to</b> a human eye, the shape inscribed by the chalk of the falling star over the blackboard that is the sky."
