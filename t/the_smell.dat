5|$|Mephedrone {{is a white}} substance. It is sold most {{commonly}} as crystals or a powder, {{but also in the}} form of capsules or pills.

5|$|The crop can be {{attacked}} by larvae of the carrot fly (Chamaepsila rosae). This pest feeds {{on the outer}} layers of the root, burrowing its way inside later in the season. Seedlings may be killed while larger roots are spoiled. The damage done provides a point of entry for fungal rots and canker. The fly is attracted by <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> of bruised tissue.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>smells</b> of Paris {{were also}} varied and unavoidable. In winter, <b>the</b> {{overwhelming}} <b>smell</b> was burning wood and charcoal used for heating and cooking. Year round, <b>the</b> streets <b>smelled</b> strongly of unwashed persons, animals, and {{human and animal}} waste products. Chamber pots of urine were routinely emptied out of windows onto the street. Along with fears of an uprising of the turbulent Parisians, <b>the</b> <b>smells</b> and bad air of central Paris were a major reason why Charles V moved the royal residence permanently from the Île de la Cité outside the old city walls to a new residence, the Hotel Saint-Pol, near the new Bastille fortress.|$|R

5|$|The kakapo has a {{well-developed}} {{sense of}} smell, which complements its nocturnal lifestyle. It can distinguish between odours while foraging, a behaviour reported {{in only one}} other parrot species. One {{of the most striking}} characteristics of the kakapo is its distinct musty-sweet odour. Given their well-developed sense of smell, this odour may be a pheromone. <b>The</b> <b>smell</b> often alerts predators to the presence of kakapos.|$|E
5|$|The next {{vignette}} {{focuses on}} Princess Bubblegum (voiced by Hynden Walch) {{as she tries}} to create the perfect sandwich using bizarre science. After exhausting herself going to extreme and ridiculous lengths to produce and combine all the ingredients perfectly, she offers the sandwich to Cinnamon Bun (voiced by Dee Bradley Baker), who merely shoves it into his pastry body and belches foodstuff onto the princess. The action then shifts to the Ice King (voiced by Tom Kenny), who smells a stench in his ice castle. After mistakenly assuming that <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> was being caused by Gunter the penguin's flatulence, the Ice King realizes that his armpits are actually the source of <b>the</b> <b>smell.</b> After taking a shower, he ponders aloud as to how he got so smelly. Gunter then proceeds to flatulate underneath his arms.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This paper explores <b>the</b> various code <b>smells</b> or <b>the</b> {{so called}} bad code {{symptoms}} present in procedural C software. <b>The</b> code <b>smells</b> are analyzed {{in the light}} of aspect oriented programming. The intention is to handle <b>the</b> code <b>smells</b> with aspect oriented constructs as it offers more versatile decomposition techniques than the traditional modularization techniques, for software evolution and understandability. <b>The</b> code <b>smells</b> are described at the function and program level. <b>The</b> code <b>smells</b> are followed by the aspect oriented transformations that may be required in order to improve the code quality...|$|R

She is the adopted {{daughter}} of a fisherman chieftain, Dusharaj (also a ferryman) {{on the banks of}} the river Yamuna. Due to <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> emanating from her body, she was known as Matsyagandha ("She who smells like fish"), and helped her father in his job as a ferryman.|$|E
5|$|Huge urban roosts {{in cities}} can create {{problems}} {{due to the}} noise and mess made and <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> of the droppings. In 1949, so many birds landed on the clock hands of London's Big Ben that it stopped, leading to unsuccessful attempts to disrupt the roosts with netting, repellent chemical on the ledges and broadcasts of common starling alarm calls. An entire episode of The Goon Show in 1954 was a parody of the futile efforts to disrupt the large common starling roosts in central London.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, nearly 20,000 people {{attended}} the third annual Hempstalk Festival at Sellwood Riverfront Park in Portland, Oregon. While organizers insisted smoking {{would not be}} tolerated, <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> of marijuana lingered {{in the air and}} some festival goers chose to consume various forms of cannabis foods. No festival attendees were arrested. Seattle Hempfest is an annual event in Seattle, Washington also attended by Oregonians, known as the world's largest annual gathering advocating decriminalization of marijuana for uses including but not limited to medicinal, industrial, and recreational. The 2008 Seattle Hempfest, which took place August 1617, set a new record with around 150,000 people in attendance.|$|E

5|$|The Great Stink was {{an event}} in central London in July and August 1858 during which the hot weather {{exacerbated}} <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> of untreated human waste and industrial effluent that was present {{on the banks of}} the River Thames. The problem had been mounting for some years, with an ageing and inadequate sewer system that emptied directly into the Thames. The miasma from the effluent was thought to transmit contagious diseases, and three outbreaks of cholera prior to the Great Stink were blamed on the ongoing problems with the river.|$|E
5|$|The next day, 20 May, <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> {{of rotting}} corpses in no man's {{land and the}} {{numerous}} wounded still located between the lines convinced the New Zealand and Australian Division staff to suggest an armistice. Soon an informal truce began under the flags of the Red Cross and Red Crescent. Turkish stretcher-bearers headed into no man's land to collect the dead and wounded. Just after 19:00 {{it appeared that the}} Turks were massing troops for an attack while gathering their wounded, so the 9th Battalion opened fire on them. The Turks responded with their artillery bombarding the Australian trenches.|$|E
5|$|The {{onion fly}} (Delia antiqua) lays eggs on {{the leaves and}} stems {{and on the ground}} close to onion, shallot, leek, and garlic plants. The fly is {{attracted}} to the crop by <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> of damaged tissue and is liable to occur after thinning. Plants grown from sets are less prone to attack. The larvae tunnel into the bulbs and the foliage wilts and turns yellow. The bulbs are disfigured and rot, especially in wet weather. Control measures may include crop rotation, the use of seed dressings, early sowing or planting, and the removal of infested plants.|$|E
30|$|Vidal et. al. [39] {{presented}} {{a tool for}} detecting code smells and agglomerations of a (Java-based) system and ranking them according to different criteria [39]. The main benefit of using their tool is that developers can configure and extend it by providing different strategies to identify and rank <b>the</b> <b>smells</b> and groups of smells (i.e., agglomerations). However, this tool cannot present all the characteristics of agglomerations. For instance, it cannot represents the relations that exist between <b>the</b> code <b>smells</b> within an agglomeration. Therefore, the developer has to reason about the agglomeration to first understand the relation among <b>the</b> <b>smells,</b> to then identify a design problem.|$|R

5|$|The {{skin of a}} giraffe {{is mostly}} gray. Its {{thickness}} allows the animal to run through thorn bush without being punctured. The fur {{may serve as a}} chemical defence, as its parasite repellents give the animal a characteristic scent. At least 11 main aromatic chemicals are in the fur, although indole and 3-methylindole are responsible for most of <b>the</b> <b>smell.</b> Because the males have a stronger odour than the females, the odour may also have sexual function. Along the animal's neck is a mane made of short, erect hairs. The one-metre (3.3-ft) tail ends in a long, dark tuft of hair and is used as a defense against insects.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>smell</b> {{has been}} {{described}} as initially faint and honey-sweet, but strengthening over time to become overpowering, sickly-sweet and objectionable. Young specimens first emerge from the ground resembling a white egg covered by a universal veil, which then breaks, leaving the volva as a remnant. The spore print is white, a common feature of Amanita. The transparent spores are globular to egg-shaped, measure 8–10μm (0.30.4mil) long, and stain blue with iodine. The gills, in contrast, stain pallid lilac or pink with concentrated sulfuric acid.|$|E

Ben tells her he is leaving town, but Clara makes it clear she has fallen in love with him. An elated Will confides to Minnie that life is so good, he may have to live forever.|$|E
