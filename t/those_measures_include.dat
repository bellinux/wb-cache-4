Those efforts are applied into several directions like standard aircraft flight control, routine conversations, aircrafts passing between responsibility areas, etc. One of main direction for air traffic controller efforts appliance is decision taking in case of flight norms violation by aircraft. In case of lateral and longitudinal standard distances between aircrafts on different flight stages any mistake made by air traffic controller might lead to air accident with unpredictable results. Off course in most common case those violations doesn’t lead {{to any kind of}} injuries or aircraft damage, but nevertheless all possibly harmful events are considered as threat to flight safety and thus must be prevented at all costs.

40|$|Overall, {{the federal}} tax system is progressive. On average, {{households}} with higher incomes pay taxes that are {{a larger share of}} their income. But barring legislative action, the numerous sunsets and phase-ins that Congress has written into the tax code will result in a tax system that {{is in a state of}} flux over the next few years.

Almost all of the provisions included in the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts passed during the Bush administration are set to expire at the end of 2010, resulting in large scheduled increases in effective tax rates across the income spectrum. Because the Bush tax cuts were regressive, the largest increases will occur at the top of the income distribution and so the tax system will become more progressive in 2011 unless Congress acts.

Snow storms degenerate safety and traffic mobility by creating adverse driving conditions including visibility impairments, reducing pavement friction, obstructed road facilities. Improving {{the effectiveness of}} the snow management requires an efficient assessment of the operational strategies with the data that can be directly measureable from the field. While there have been various types of operational measures used in the state DOTs in the US, the traffic data-based operational measures that can quantify the effects of snow plowing activities are still lacking. To be sure, the existing approaches developed to date employed the variations of traffic speed or travel time during the snow events and those measures cannot fully reflect the road weather conditions when traffic is congested. Developing the operational measures that can objectively and accurately reflect the time-variant road weather conditions is essential in improving {{the effectiveness of the}} snow management strategies. In this research, an automatic process is developed for estimating the traffic data-based operational measures for winter snow management. <b>Those</b> <b>measures</b> <b>include</b> the Road Condition Recovery Time (RCR), the estimate of the `bare-lane regain time', which is the major performance measure of the winter snow maintenance operations at the Minnesota Department of Transportation.

40|$|The {{emerging}} {{economies of}} Singapore and Malaysia have labor markets with large foreign components because excess labor demand {{was for a}} long time met by foreign workers. Immigration policy to manage the inflow of expatriate labor in the two countries consists of highly regulated work permit systems that differentiate workers by nationality, skill level, and sector of activity. The associated permit fees vary across these parameters. Has immigration policy effectively managed foreign labor flows? These two countries'containment of the foreign labor force at a time of rapid, sustained growth suggest that it has. It is not enough to establish a stable macroeconomic climate with favorable investment incentives (as Kuwait has learned). In Singapore and Malaysia, complementary measures help make their immigration policies effective. <b>Those</b> <b>measures</b> <b>include</b> nationalization policies that limit opportunities for expatriates, institutional capacity to implement and enforce policy, a macroeconomic environment conductive to growth and job creation, and wage and employment policies that are mutually reinforcing. Trends in employment composition in both Singapore and Malaysia support the assertion that foreign labor policy effectively targets workers with skills at both extremes of the scale to fill gaps in labor demand unmet by nationals. But the news is not all good. A huge informal sector of illegal foreign workers in both countries suggests a degree of policy failure. Household survey data for Malaysia show that foreign workers earn less than their citizen counterparts. Foreign labor shares in labor markets in the Golf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries range from 50 to 90 percent of the total labor force in the context of persistent excess demand for labor concurrent with emerging unemployment among nationals. Policymakers could look to Singapore and Malaysia for lessons in managing foreign labor. But replicating Singapore's or Malaysia's immigration policies alone, without addressing existing employment and pay distortions, may have limited success, given the very different economies and institutional environments in the GCC.

40|$|China's {{anthropogenic}} emissions of atmospheric mercury (Hg) are effectively constrained by national {{air pollution control}} and energy efficiency policies. In this study, improved methods, based on available data from domestic field measurements, are developed to quantify the benefits of Hg abatement by various emission control measures. <b>Those</b> <b>measures</b> <b>include</b> increased use of (1) flue gas desulfurization (FGD) and selective catalyst reduction (SCR) systems in power generation; (2) precalciner kilns with fabric filters (FF) in cement production; (3) mechanized coking ovens with electrostatic precipitators (ESP) in iron and steel production; and (4) advanced production technologies in nonferrous metal smelting. Investigation reveals declining trends in emission factors {{for each of these}} sources, which together drive a much slower growth of total Hg emissions than the growth of China's energy consumption and economy, from 679 metric tons (t) in 2005 to 750 t in 2012. In particular, estimated emissions from the above-mentioned four source types declined 3 % from 2005 to 2012, which can be attributed to expanded deployment of technologies with higher energy efficiencies and air pollutant removal rates. Emissions from other anthropogenic sources are estimated to increase by 22 % during the period. The species shares of total Hg emissions have been stable in recent years, with mass fractions of around 55, 39, and 6 % for gaseous elemental Hg (Hg 0), reactive gaseous mercury (Hg 2 +), and particle-bound mercury (Hg p), respectively. The higher estimate of total Hg emissions than previous inventories is supported by limited simulation of atmospheric chemistry and transport. With improved implementation of emission controls and energy saving, a 23 % reduction in annual Hg emissions from 2012 to 2030, to below 600 t, is expected at the most. While growth in Hg emissions has been gradually constrained, uncertainties quantified by Monte Carlo simulation for recent years have increased, particularly for the power sector and particular industrial sources. The uncertainty (expressed as 95 % confidence intervals) of Hg emissions from coal-fired power plants, for example, increased from − 48 –+ 73 % in 2005 to − 50 –+ 89 % in 2012. This is attributed mainly to increased penetration of advanced manufacturing and pollutant control technologies; the unclear operational status and relatively small sample sizes of field measurements of those processes have resulted in lower but highly varied emission factors. To reduce uncertainty and further confirm the benefits of pollution control and energy polices, therefore, systematic investigation of specific Hg pollution sources is recommended. The variability of temporal trends and spatial distributions of Hg emissions needs to be better tracked during the ongoing dramatic changes in China's economy, energy use, and air pollution status...|$|E

Since run-off-road accidents comprise almost one third of all motor vehicle accidents, the physical characteristics of the roadside can either reduce, or increase the seriousness of the consequences of vehicles leaving the roadway. While safety of vehicle occupants is a major consideration in roadside design, the safety of personnel working along the roadside is also a critical consideration. Some of the same mitigation measures that protect vehicle occupants can allow personnel working in roadside areas escape routes, or shields. <b>Those</b> mitigation <b>measures</b> <b>include</b> making the slope traversable, or installing traffic barriers or earth berms. WSDOT personnel are trained, and are familiar with the dangers inherent in working in roadside areas.

40|$|The {{terrorist}} attacks of September 11 th 2001 {{had a significant impact}} upon how governments counter terrorism. The UK introduced and implemented an array of measures, each taking a pre-emptive and preventative approach, to tackle terrorism. The change in counter-terrorism law and policy post- 9 / 11 has, as this thesis will show, increasingly become reliant upon fear-based risk and uncertainty rather than evidence-based guilt. This thesis will examine some of <b>those</b> UK <b>measures</b> used post- 9 / 11, which were seen as some of the more controversial measures. When analysing each measure there will be an assessment of the human rights issues associated with <b>those</b> <b>measures,</b> specifically under Article’s 5 and 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The assessment of these rights with each measure will provide a legal understanding of the wider academic and legal implication of <b>those</b> <b>measures,</b> these <b>include</b> the right to a fair trial. Having assessed the human rights implications of each measure, a risk assessment is undertaken. This enables further analysis of each measure and holistically identifies the wider risk implications of such counter terrorism measures. Such risks may include negative perceptions of the police, the UK or provide indirect support for the radicalisation of new terrorists. This process is developed within the thesis and becomes known as the ‘tri-relationship'. Throughout, the measures examined will be seen to erode those human rights principles ordinarily guaranteed by the criminal justice system, for example liberty. Instead, the measures give way to a new counter-terrorism justice system which has become increasingly normalised by the measures introduced and accepted by the courts. This is despite the implications on human rights and risks involved.

On November 12, 1991, the Northwest Power Planning Council (NPPC) approved the mitigation plan with minor modifications, called for a detailed implementation plan, and amended measures 903 (h) (1) through (7). A long-term mitigation plan was submitted in August 1992, {{was approved by the}} Council in 1993, and the first contract for this project was signed on November 11, 1993. The problem this project addresses is the loss of habitat, both in quality and quantity, in the Flathead Lake and River basin resulting from the construction and operation of Hungry Horse Dam. The purpose of the project is to both implement mitigation measures and monitor the biological responses to <b>those</b> <b>measures</b> <b>including</b> <b>those</b> implemented by Project Numbers 9101903 and 9101904. Goals and objectives of the 1994 Fish and Wildlife Program (Section 10. 1) addressed by this project are the rebuilding to sustainable levels weak, but recoverable, native populations injured by the hydropower system. The project mitigates the blockage of spawning runs by Hungry Horse Dam by restoring and even creating spawning habitats within direct drainages to Flathead Lake. The project also addresses the altered habitat within Flathead Lake resulting from species shifts and consequent dominance of new species that restricts the potential success of mitigation measures. Specific goals of this project are to create and restore habitat and quantitatively monitor changes in fish populations to verify the efficacy of our mitigation measures. The project consists of three components: monitoring, restoration and research. Monitoring, for example, includes a spring gillnetting series conducted annually in Flathead Lake and builds on an existing data set initiated in 1981. Monitoring of the experimental kokanee reintroduction was a primary activity of this project between 1992 and 1997. Lake trout, whose high densities have precluded successful mitigation of losses of other species in Flathead Lake, have been monitored since 1996 to measure several biological parameters. Results of this work have utility in determining the population status of this key predator in Flathead Lake. The project has also defined the baseline condition of the Flathead Lake fishery in 1992 - 1993 and has conducted annual lakewide surveys since 1998. The restoration component of the project has addressed several stream channel, riparian, and fish passage problems, and suppression of non-native fish. The research component of the project began in FY 2000 and measured trophic linkages between M. relicta and other species to assist in predicting the results of our efforts to suppress lake trout.
