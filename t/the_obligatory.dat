5|$|However, {{in order}} to {{accomplish}} its aims, morality must be legitimate in the eyes of those to whom it speaks. As Durkheim argues, this moral authority is primarily to be located in religion, which is why in any religion one finds a code of morality. For Durkheim, it is only society that has the resources, the respect, and the power to cultivate within an individual both <b>the</b> <b>obligatory</b> and the desirous aspects of morality.|$|E

5|$|Opened {{as part of}} {{an attempt}} to {{encourage}} holiday traffic on the line, the halt primarily served golfers at the nearby Royal Cromer Golf Club. The station facilities were very basic, consisting of no more than a single wooden platform, which cost £170 to build, two wooden benches and running in board together with <b>the</b> <b>obligatory</b> oil lamps.

5|$|In 1907, Georges Passerieu {{broke away}} from a small leading group just before Douai because he knew he couldn't outsprint them if they all {{finished}} together. He was chased {{all the way to}} Roubaix by a Belgian, Cyrille van Hauwaert, and tension in the velodrome was high. The crowd heard that Passerieu had reached the stadium but nobody rode on to the track. The leader was just about to ride in when a gendarme stepped into his path to check if his bicycle had <b>the</b> <b>obligatory</b> tax plate attached to it. Passerieu had already had a hard day and a shouting match broke out before he was allowed to continue.|$|E
5|$|The {{area was}} {{populated}} in the Stone Age by Inari Sami people {{shortly after the}} last glacial period ended about 8000BC. The first documents from the area are tax records from the 16th century. The Inari Sami originally subsisted on hunting, gathering and especially fishing; later they began to complement this by reindeer husbandry, and later still by farming and herding cattle and sheep. The area belonged to the Inari Siida beginning in the Middle Ages. Until the border was closed in 1852, the Sami from Norway came during winter to herd their reindeer. The closing of the border caused some Norwegian Sami to settle {{in the area and}} continue with reindeer husbandry. This caught on among the Inari Sami, and the amount of husbandry increased during the 20th century. People in the area traveled up Lake Inari and onwards to the coast of Finnmark, Norway, to fish during summer. Records of markets in Finnmark date back to the 16th century, and in the 1880s about 150 people traveled to the coast each year. Logging in the southern part boomed during the 1920s, when logs were driven down the Pasvik River to Elvenes and Jakobsnes in Norway. Previously there were birch forests in the fells, but in the 1960s their leaves were eaten by the caterpillar of the autumnal moth, leaving the fells barren. The construction of the Paatsjoki River Hydroelectric Plants starting in the 1940s had a strong negative effect on the fish population; in 1976 the authorities therefore enforced <b>the</b> <b>obligatory</b> introduction of fish in Lake Inari.|$|E

2500|$|In the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, Bahá'u'lláh {{prescribed}} the Bahá'í law of a daily obligatory prayer {{which is}} to be said individually (though not necessarily in private); he wrote that <b>the</b> specific <b>obligatory</b> prayer was recorded in a separate tablet or writing. Bahá'u'lláh wrote the text mentioned, but never released it in order to avoid provoking conflict with the surrounding Muslims. [...] Instead, sometime before the writing of the supplement to the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, the Questions and Answers, Bahá'u'lláh wrote a set of three obligatory prayers which are the ones used by Bahá'ís today. [...] <b>The</b> original <b>obligatory</b> prayer involved nine cycles of movement (rak'ah) and was to be said in the morning, noon and in the afternoon, probably three cycles at a time.
