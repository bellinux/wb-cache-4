5|$|A large {{tropical}} wave, {{which eventually}} became Erika, moved {{off the coast}} of Africa on August 31. Shortly after leaving the coast, it displayed a large low-level circulation, though as it tracked westward, the circulation failed to contract significantly. It slowly organized, and by September 3 the convection within the circulation had sufficiently organized for the system <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>classified</b> as Tropical Depression Six, while located about 1150miles (1850km) east of the southernmost Lesser Antilles. The depression moved west-northwestward at approximately 20mph (32km/h) under the influence of a well-established subtropical ridge, and late on September 3 the system intensified into a tropical storm. At that time, the National Hurricane Center in Miami gave the storm the name of Erika.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on August 29. It tracked slowly westward, and first showed signs of development two days later. On August 31, a second tropical wave exited the coast of Africa at a faster speed than its predecessor. The two waves interacted, and by September 2 combined to form a large area of disturbed weather across the eastern Atlantic Ocean. Convection increased within the system, and it developed a concentrated area of convection in conjunction with a well-defined low pressure area. By late on September 3, the system maintained a broad closed circulation and enough convective organization <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>classified</b> Tropical Depression Six while located about midway between the Lesser Antilles and Africa.|$|E

5|$|A trough {{extended}} from the northern Gulf of Mexico to the western Atlantic Ocean in early August. The trough remained nearly stationary, spawning Tropical Storm Bertha in the Gulf of Mexico and a tropical disturbance {{off the coast of}} South Carolina. The weak low pressure area off South Carolina drifted southward, with its associated deep convection increasing in organization on August 4. By 1800UTC on August 5, the system had acquired sufficient organization <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>classified</b> as Tropical Depression Three, while located about 175miles (280km/h) east-southeast of Charleston, South Carolina.|$|E
5|$|As a halogen, {{astatine}} tends <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>classified</b> as a nonmetal. It {{has some}} marked metallic properties and is sometimes instead classified {{as either a}} metalloid or (less often) as a metal. Immediately following its production in 1940, early investigators considered it a metal. In 1949 {{it was called the}} most noble (difficult to reduce) nonmetal as well as being a relatively noble (difficult to oxidize) metal. In 1950 astatine was described as a halogen and (therefore) a reactive nonmetal. In 2013, on the basis of relativistic modelling, astatine was predicted to be a monatomic metal, with a face-centred cubic crystalline structure.|$|E
5|$|Both Smith and {{his wife}} were of mixed-race African and European ancestry. As he became {{economically}} successful, he built a house in a good neighborhood; in the 1860 census he and his family were classified in that neighborhood as white, whereas in 1850 they were classified as mulatto. He served for nearly 20 years as the doctor at the Colored Orphan Asylum in New York but, after it was burned down in July 1863 by a mob in the New York Draft Riots, in which nearly 100 blacks were killed, Smith moved his family and practice out to Brooklyn for safety. The parents stressed education for their children. In the 1870 census, his widow and children continued <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>classified</b> as white.|$|E

5|$|Cyclonic Storm Keila (IMD designation: ARB 02, JTWC designation: 03A) was {{the first}} named storm of the 2011 North Indian Ocean cyclone season. A weak system for much of its duration, Keila {{developed}} in the western Arabian Sea in late October 2011, amid an area of marginally favorable conditions. On November2, it briefly organized enough <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>classified</b> as a cyclonic storm, which has maximum sustained winds of at least 65km/h (40mph). Given the name Keila by the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the storm quickly moved ashore southern Oman near Salalah, and weakened while meandering over the country. The remnants soon after moved offshore, dissipating on November4.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Emilia was, at the time, {{the strongest}} {{tropical}} cyclone on {{record in the}} Central Pacific Ocean, and the first of such <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>classified</b> as a Category5 hurricane– the highest rating on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. However, hurricanes Gilma later that year and Ioke in 2006 later reached lower barometric pressures in the Central Pacific. The fifth named storm and {{the first of three}} Category 5hurricanes of the 1994 hurricane season, Emilia developed from an area of low pressure southeast of Hawaii on July16. Tracking westward, the initial tropical depression intensified into a tropical storm several hours after tropical cyclogenesis. Subsequently, Emilia entered the Central Pacific Ocean and moved into the area of responsibility of the Central Pacific Hurricane Center(CPHC).|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Igor {{was first}} {{identified}} as a broad {{area of low pressure}} accompanying a tropical wave over western Africa in early September2010. Tracking nearly due west, the system emerged into the eastern Atlantic Ocean on September6. Gradual development took place as convection– thunderstorm activity– consolidated around its center. At 0600UTC on September8, the low was deemed sufficiently organized <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>classified</b> as a tropical depression while situated roughly 90mi (140km) southeast of the Cape Verde Islands. Attaining gale-force winds six hours later, the depression intensified into a tropical storm and was subsequently named Igor by the National Hurricane Center (NHC).|$|E

5|$|On August14, 2015, a {{well-defined}} tropical wave, accompanied by significant surface pressure falls, traversed Western Africa and emerged over the Atlantic Ocean that evening. A broad surface low developed along the wave on August15. Embedded within monsoon flow, various environmental factors enabled gradual {{development of the}} disturbance, including low wind shear, above-average sea surface temperatures, moderate moisture content, and favorable diffluence. A subtropical ridge to the north steered the system generally west-northwest throughout its entire existence. On August17, the surface low became increasingly defined and convection more persistent. It subsequently acquired enough organization <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>classified</b> a tropical depression—the fourth of the 2015season—at 06:00UTC on August18. At this time, it was situated about 825mi (1,325km) west-southwest of Praia, Cape Verde.|$|E
5|$|On September 21, a {{tropical}} wave – a trough of relatively low atmospheric pressure – began moving slowly westward {{from the west}} coast of Africa, passing near the Cape Verde islands on September 23. Though the wave was disorganized, a low-level circulation developed on September 24 a few hundred miles to the southwest of Cape Verde. Steady organization ensued, including the development of convection into curved bands around the system. Though it lacked a well-defined center, the system organized enough <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>classified</b> Tropical Depression Sixteen on September 25 while located about 920mi (1,480km) west-southwest of the Cape Verde Islands.|$|E

5|$|Some {{physiological}} carnivores consume plant {{matter and}} some physiological herbivores consuming meat. From a behavioral aspect, {{this would make}} them omnivores, but from the physiological standpoint, {{this may be due}} to zoopharmacognosy. Physiologically, animals must be able to obtain both energy and nutrients from plant and animal materials to be considered omnivorous. Thus, such animals are still able <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>classified</b> as carnivores and herbivores when they are just obtaining nutrients from materials originating from sources that do not seemingly complement their classification. For example, it is well documented that some ungulates. such as giraffes, camels, and cattle, will gnaw on bones to consume particular minerals and nutrients. Also, cats, which are generally regarded as obligate carnivores, occasionally eat grass to regurgitate indigestible material (such as hairballs), aid with hemoglobin production, and as a laxative.|$|E
5|$|Subtropical Storm One was a {{short-lived}} subtropical cyclone that brought copious amounts of rainfall to central Florida in late June 1974. The storm originated {{in an area}} of convection that detached from a tropical depression over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico on June24. A new area of low pressure developed underneath the convection and the system began to intensify. Later that day, the storm had become sufficiently organized <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>classified</b> as a subtropical depression. Early on June25, it made landfall near Clearwater, Florida with winds of 50mph (85km/h) and later attained its peak intensity over eastern Florida with winds of 65mph (100km/h). After reemerging into the Atlantic Ocean, the system began to weaken as it underwent an extratropical transition. The storm ultimately dissipated off the coast of North Carolina early on June26.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{widely accepted}} animal fossils are rather modern-looking cnidarians, possibly from around , although fossils from the Doushantuo Formation {{can only be}} dated approximately. The identification {{of some of these}} as embryos of animals has been contested, but other fossils from these rocks strongly resemble tubes and other mineralized structures made by corals. Their presence implies that the cnidarian and bilaterian lineages had already diverged. Although the Ediacaran fossil Charnia used <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>classified</b> as a jellyfish or sea pen, more recent study of growth patterns in Charnia and modern cnidarians has cast doubt on this hypothesis, leaving only the Canadian polyp, Haootia, as the only bona-fide cnidarian body fossil from the Ediacaran. Few fossils of cnidarians without mineralized skeletons are known from more recent rocks, except in lagerstätten that preserved soft-bodied animals.|$|E

5|$|The {{meteorological}} {{history of}} Hurricane Luis spanned sixteen days between August27 to September11, 1995. The storm originated {{from an area}} of low pressure associated with a tropical wave on August26. The following day, the low became sufficiently organized <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>classified</b> as a tropical depression, while tracking general westward. By August29, the depression intensified into a tropical storm and was given the name Luis by the National Hurricane Center. Luis attained hurricane status the following day as an eye began to develop. On September1 the cyclone intensified into a major hurricane—a storm with winds of 111mph (178km/h) or higher—and further strengthened to a Category4 hurricane later that day.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} Typhoon Krovanh {{can be traced}} back to an area of {{persistent}} convection well east of Chuuk State on August13. Over the course of the day the disturbance gradually consolidated within favorable atmospheric conditions, and at 1800UTC that day the Japan Meteorological Agency(JMA) assessed the system to have organized sufficiently <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>classified</b> as a tropical depression. Shower activity was suppressed by a nearby upper-level low for much of the storm's early existence; however, at 0600UTC on August15, the system was classified by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center(JTWC) as a tropical depression. The depression tracked northwestward under the influence of a nearby ridge. Strengthening and development of the tropical cyclone was very minimal over the next few days, and on August18, both tracking agencies discontinued monitoring the system due to the lack of an identifiable low-level circulation center.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Nora {{were from a}} {{tropical}} wave that exited {{the west coast of}} Africa on September13. It moved westward across the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea without developing. The wave axis crossed Central America on September25, with its convection tracking westward along the southern Mexican coastline. On September29, the system became better organized when it reached a position about 100mi (160km) south of Acapulco. Although upper-level wind shear was only marginally favorable, the National Hurricane Center first noted the potential for tropical cyclogenesis on September30 over the subsequent few days. This verified on October1 after the thunderstorms organized enough for the system <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>classified</b> as Tropical Depression Fourteen-E. At the time, it was located about 600mi (975km) south of the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula.|$|E
