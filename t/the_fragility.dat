His morality is nuanced, weighing both sides of an issue. When leaving the confrontation with Baxter, he questions his use of his medical knowledge, {{even though it was}} in self-defense, and with genuine Hippocratic feeling. While shopping for his fish supper, he cites scientific research that shows greater consciousness in fish, and wonders whether he should stop eating them. As a sign of his rationalism, he appreciates the brutality of Saddam Hussein's rule as described by the Iraqi professor whom Perowne treated, at the same time taking seriously his children's concerns about the war.|$|E

Despite also losing these new founds friends, these actions will help Syaoran grow into a young man.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Peloponnesian War, the militaristic city-state of Sparta had been able to impose a hegemony over the heartland of Classical Greece (the Peloponessus and mainland Greece south of Thessaly), the states of this area having been severely weakened by the war. This state of affairs was resented by many of the Greek city-states, which had traditionally been ferociously independent, and led directly to the Corinthian War of 395–387 BC. Sparta emerged from this conflict with its hegemony intact, though only as a result of Persian intervention, which led to the so-called King's Peace. <b>The</b> <b>fragility</b> of Spartan dominance had been demonstrated however, and in the next decade, the Thebans would revolt against Sparta. The Spartans were unable to successfully quell the revolt, leading to de facto Theban independence. Then, after several years of desultory conflict, the Thebans finally met the Spartans in open battle at Leuctra (371 BC), and under the leadership of Epaminondas inflicted an unprecedented defeat on the Spartan army, killing the Spartan king Cleombrotus I in the process.|$|E
40|$|The {{addition}} of lead to normal human blood was previously found {{to cause a}} decrease in erythrocyte osmotic <b>fragility</b> in vitro. <b>The</b> mechanism of <b>the</b> decreased osmotic <b>fragility</b> caused by lead has not been completely clarified, but the following hypothesis has been proposed. Lead causes a leakage of water from erythrocytes, thus more water can enter the cell before haemolysis occurs. There has been no report, however, of the direct measurement of the intracellular water content of erythrocytes treated with lead. This study has tried to clarify the relation between intracellular water and <b>the</b> osmotic <b>fragility</b> of lead-treated erythrocytes in vitro. The results showed that 0. 05 microM/ml of lead decreased <b>the</b> osmotic <b>fragility,</b> <b>the</b> intracellular water content, and intracellular potassium and mean corpuscular volume, increased the plasma water content and trapped water content, and contracted the erythrocyte shape.

5|$|The year of 1964 {{marked a}} decisive {{turning point in}} the Vietnam War. Following the ousting of President Ngô Đình Diệm in 1963, South Vietnam's top army generals {{continued}} to vie with each other for control of the country’s military-dominated government instead of combating the emerging forces of the National Liberation Front, also known as the Viet Cong. <b>The</b> <b>fragility</b> of the South Vietnamese government was reflected on the battlefield, where its military experienced great setbacks against the Viet Cong. Taking advantage of Saigon's political instability, Communist leaders in Hanoi began preparing for war. Even though key members of North Vietnam's Politburo disagreed on the best strategy to reunite their country, they ultimately went ahead to prepare for armed struggle against South Vietnam and their American supporters.|$|E
5|$|Despite the Congress of London's {{verdict in}} 1830, the Dutch {{continued}} to resist Belgian independence {{for much of}} Leopold I's early reign. On 2 August 1831, days after Leopold's coronation, the Dutch launched an invasion known as the Ten Days' Campaign. The 50,000-strong Dutch force crossed the border and rapidly pushed the small Belgian army {{back as far as}} Leuven. Faced with a military disaster, the Belgian government appealed to the French for support. Without international support of their own and faced with an entire French army under General Étienne Gérard, the Dutch withdrew on 12 August. In 1832 the French pushed the Dutch out of Antwerp, their final garrison in Belgium. Much of the city was destroyed in the fighting. Sporadic skirmishes along the border continued until 1839, when the Dutch signed the Treaty of London. The Ten Days' Campaign revealed <b>the</b> <b>fragility</b> of the Belgian position, and although the Dutch finally recognized the independence of Belgium, the Belgians were forced to give up some disputed territories, including Zeelandic Flanders and the Duchy of Limburg. Part of Luxembourg, equivalent to the modern state, remained as a semi-independent protectorate of the Dutch until 1890.|$|E
5|$|Toshack's {{performance}} in the First Test at Trent Bridge was a quiet one, taking a wicket in each innings. He was involved in an aggressive final wicket partnership of 32 with Johnston, scoring 19runs, his best at Test level to date in just 18minutes. Toshack's best Test performance was his 5/40 in the second innings of the Second Test at Lord's when Miller was unable to bowl after being injured, including the wickets of Cyril Washbrook, Bill Edrich, captain Yardley and Alec Coxon. During this performance, he employed two short legs and a silly mid-off. He had a moderately successful Third Test, taking figures of 3/101 in the only Test that Australia did not win. His knee injury flared again in the Fourth Test after taking an ineffective 1/112 in the first innings, {{he was unable to}} bowl in the second innings of an Australian win. He made a recovery and it was hoped that {{he would be able to}} play in the Fifth Test, but he injured again himself in the lead-up match against Lancashire. He was taken to London for cartilage surgery, ending his tour and his Test career. An inept batsman with an average of 5.78 in first-class fixtures, Toshack managed a Test average of 51 on the 1948 tour after being out only once, behind only Arthur Morris, Sid Barnes, Bradman and Neil Harvey. The unbeaten 20 he managed in the Lord's Test was his best first-class score, made in an uninhibited tenth-wicket stand with Johnston. Due to <b>the</b> <b>fragility</b> of his knee, Toshack was used sparingly in the tour games, playing in only 11 of the 29 non-Test matches on the tour. Toshack totalled 50 wickets at the average of 21.12 for the tour.|$|E
40|$|Seismic fragilities of {{buildings}} are often developed without consideration of soil-structure interaction (SSI), where {{base of the}} building {{is assumed to be}} fixed. This study highlights effect of SSI and uncertainty in soil properties such as friction angle, cohesion, density, shear modulus and Poisson's ratio and foundation parameters on seismic fragilities of non-ductile reinforced concrete frames resting in dense silty sand. Three-, five-, and nine-storey three-bay moment resisting reinforced concrete frames resting on isolated shallow foundation are studied and the numerical models for SSI are developed in OpenSees. Three sets of 10 ground motions, with mean spectrum of 100, 500, and 1000 yr return period hazard level (matching EC- 8 design spectrum), are used for the nonlinear time history analyses. An optimized Latin Hyper Cube sampling technique is used to draw the sample of soil properties and foundation parameters. <b>The</b> <b>fragilities</b> are developed for the fixed base model and SSI models. However, <b>the</b> <b>fragilities</b> that incorporate <b>the</b> soil parameter and foundation uncertainties are only slightly different from those based solely on the uncertainty in seismic demand from earthquake ground motion, suggesting that fragilities that are developed under the assumption that all soil and foundation parameters at their median (or mean) values are sufficient for the purpose of earthquake damage or loose estimation of structures resting on dense silty sand. But the consideration of the SSI effect has the significant influence on <b>the</b> <b>fragilities</b> compare to <b>the</b> fixed base model.

40|$|Cloud Analysis {{is based}} on simple {{regression}} in the logarithmic space of structural response versus seismic intensity {{for a set of}} registered records. A Bayesian take on the Cloud Analysis, presented herein, manages to take into account both record-to-record variability and other sources of uncertainty related to structural modelling. First, the structural response to a suite of ground motions, applied to different realizations of the structural model generated through a standard Monte Carlo, is obtained. The resulting suite of structural response is going to be used as “data” in order to update the joint probability distribution function for the two regression parameters and the conditional logarithmic standard deviation. In the next stage, large-sample MC simulation based on the updated joint probability distribution is used to generate a set of plausible <b>fragility</b> curves. <b>The</b> robust <b>fragility</b> is estimated as the average of <b>the</b> generated <b>fragility</b> curves. <b>The</b> dispersion in <b>the</b> robust <b>fragility</b> is estimated as the variance of <b>the</b> plausible <b>fragility</b> curves generated. <b>The</b> plus/minus one standard deviation confidence interval for <b>the</b> robust <b>fragility</b> depends on <b>the</b> size of the sample of “data” employed. Application of the Bayesian Cloud procedure for an existing RC frame designed only for gravity-loading demonstrates the effect of structural modelling uncertainties, such as the uncertainties in component capacities and those related to construction details. Moreover, a comparison of <b>the</b> resulting robust <b>fragility</b> curves with fragility curves obtained based on the Incremental Dynamic Analysis shows a significant dependence on both the structural performance measure adopted and the selection of the records...|$|R

40|$|A liquid {{storage tank}} {{is one of}} the most {{important}} structures in industrial complexes dealing with chemicals, and its structural damage due to an earthquake may cause a disastrous event such as the leakage of hazardous materials, fire, and explosion. It is thus essential to assess <b>the</b> seismic <b>fragility</b> of liquid storage tanks and prepare for seismic events in advance. When a liquid storage tank is oscillated by a seismic load, the hydrodynamic pressure caused by the liquid-structure interaction increases the stress and causes structural damage to the tank. Meanwhile, <b>the</b> seismic <b>fragility</b> of <b>the</b> structure can be estimated by considering the various sources of uncertainty and calculating the failure probabilities in a given limiting state. To accurately evaluate <b>the</b> seismic <b>fragility</b> of liquid storage tanks, a sophisticated finite element analysis is required during their reliability analysis.
