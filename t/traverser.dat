40|$|<b>Traversing</b> is a {{fundamental}} operation in surveying and {{the assessment of the}} quality of a <b>traverse</b> is a skill that every surveyor develops. Acceptable <b>traverses</b> have angular and linear misclosures that fall within acceptable bounds; which would permit the adjustment of the <b>traverse</b> measurements to remove mathematical inconsistencies. Unfortunately these misclosures tell very little about the precision of the location of the <b>traverse</b> stations - although large misclosures are good indicators of gross errors - and more sophisticated mathematical techniques are required for proper <b>traverse</b> analysis.

60|$|Sheil's {{speech was}} one of those {{numerous}} anomalies with which this singular trial was crowded; and which, together, showed the great difficulty of coming to a legal decision on a political question, in a criminal court. Of this, the present day gave two specimens, which will not be forgotten; when a Privy Councillor, a member of a former government, whilst defending his client as a barrister, proposed in Court a new form of legislation for Ireland, equally distant from that adopted by Government, and that sought to be established by him whom he was defending; and when the <b>traverser</b> on his trial rejected the defence of his counsel, and declared aloud in Court, that he would not, by his silence, appear to agree in the suggestions then made.|$|E

Imputations were made, such as I presume were never before uttered by one lawyer against another in a court of law. An Attorney-General sent a challenge from his very seat of office; and though that challenge was read in Court, it was passed over by four judges with hardly a reprimand. If any seditious speech was ever made by O'Connell, that which he made in his defence was especially so, and he was, without check, allowed to use his position as a <b>traverser</b> at the bar, as a rostrum from which to fulminate more thoroughly and publicly than ever, those doctrines for uttering which he was then being tried; and, to crown it all, even the silent dignity of the bench was forgotten, and the lawyers pleading against the Crown were unhappily alluded to by the Chief Justice as the [...] "gentlemen on the other side." ...|$|E
