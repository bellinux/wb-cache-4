5|$|The {{most common}} {{approach}} of GWA studies is the case-control setup, which compares two {{large groups of}} individuals, one healthy control group and one case group affected by a disease. All individuals in each group are genotyped {{for the majority of}} common known SNPs. The exact number of SNPs depends on the genotyping technology, but are typically one million or more. For each of these SNPs it is then investigated if the allele frequency is significantly altered between the case and the control group. In such setups, the fundamental unit for reporting effect sizes is <b>the</b> <b>odds</b> ratio. <b>The</b> <b>odds</b> ratio is the ratio of two odds, which in the context of GWA studies are <b>the</b> <b>odds</b> of disease for individuals having a specific allele and <b>the</b> <b>odds</b> of disease for individuals who do not have that same allele. When the allele frequency in the case group is much higher than in the control group, <b>the</b> <b>odds</b> ratio is higher than 1, and vice versa for lower allele frequency. Additionally, a P-value for the significance of <b>the</b> <b>odds</b> ratio is typically calculated using a simple chi-squared test. Finding odds ratios that are significantly different from 1 is the objective of the GWA study because this shows that a SNP is associated with disease.|$|E

5|$|A {{population}} bottleneck is when {{a population}} contracts to a significantly smaller size over {{a short period of}} time due to some random environmental event.

40|$|Background The {{reversibility}} of new/novel oral anticoagulants (NOAC) is {{not well}} understood, whereas the reversal strategies for bleeding associated with vitamin k antagonists (VKA), such as warfarin, is well established. It is unknown whether outcomes are different between bleeds occurring with NOAC compared to VKA use. Objectives This systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials determines <b>the</b> relative <b>odds</b> of fatal bleeding given that a patient suffered a major bleed while on NOAC versus VKA therapy. Search Methods Data on major and fatal bleeding events was sought from randomized controlled trials of NOAC agents compared to VKAs. Main Results 20 trials {{were included in the}} meta-analysis. From which, 4056 first-time, major bleeding events were reported and included in the primary analysis. <b>The</b> summary <b>odds</b> ratio for <b>the</b> conditional <b>odds</b> of fatal bleeding given that a major bleeding event occurred was 0. 65 [0. 52, 0. 81] favoring the NOAC agents (p = 0. 0001). <b>The</b> reduced <b>odds</b> of fatal bleeding with NOACs was not demonstrated after controlling for bleeding location. Given that an intracra-nial bleeding event occurred, <b>the</b> summary <b>odds</b> ratio for <b>the</b> conditional <b>odds</b> of fatal bleed-ing was 0. 96 [0. 70, 1. 32]. For extracranial bleeding events, <b>the</b> summary <b>odds</b> ratio was also statistically insignificant at 0. 945 [0. 66, 1. 35]...|$|R

Brown, though conceding the skeptics' point, still thinks that there is enough data to mount a search for a new planet.|$|E
