40|$|I n September 1997, Computer {{published}} {{a special issue}} on billion-transistor microprocessor architectures. 1 Our goal for that issue wasto frame {{the debate about the}} direction computer architectures wouldtake as Moore’s law continues its relentless drive down to atomiclimits. That issue, widely cited, contained a range of visionary pro-jections from many top researchers, covering the space of architectural pos-sibilities at the time across a range of candidate markets and domains. We solicited and selected two sets of papers. The first set enumerated important emerging trends that were potential drivers of architectural change in technology, applications, and interfaces. The second set described a num-ber of visions for designs that could and would scale up to billion-transis-tor architectures (BTAs). What emerged from the accepted set of papers was that there was no consensus about which direction microprocessor archi-tectures are likely to take as chip integration reaches unprecedented levels. Seven years later, it is both interesting and instructive to look back on that debate and the projections made. What did the community get right? What did we miss? What new ideas have since emerged? It turned out that many of the authors—a surprising number given the disparity in opinions—were exactly right about the directions <b>that</b> <b>industr...</b>|$|E
40|$|Supply chains (SC) {{globalization}} significantly grew in {{the last}} years and this pushed companies to find ways to manage international supply networks effectively. However, in the literature, very few contributions addressed the problem considering the whole SC. The aim of this paper is therefore to study global SC configurations and management through a set of case studies in the electric motors industry. Moreover, we interpreted the results under the light of a set of contextual variables ranging from competitive priorities to the value chain <b>that</b> characterizes the <b>industr...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{wants to}} explore {{more about the}} {{prospects}} and challenges {{of the development of}} Islamic insurance in Indonesia. Islamic insurance industry in Indonesia has very good prospects for growth, the demand for insurance products based on shariah will continue to increase. This is supported by a large population of Indonesia and also as the largest Muslim country in the world. However, this industry will also experience a very strong obstacle because of the global economic downturn, as it also conditions the people are not educated about insurance, the free market has begun to be applied, resources are less about Islamic insurance, lack of capital and other on. Therefore it needs the government's role to help to continue to grow, with regulations <b>that</b> support this <b>industr...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background: The tobacco {{industry}} uses various strategies to promote {{itself as a}} socially responsible, ethical industry, including establishing links with health institutions and medical research. The {{purpose of this study}} was to identify the relationships between the {{tobacco industry}} and Canadian faculties of medicine, specifically research funding and donations from tobacco industry sources, and faculty-specific policies regarding the acceptance of tobacco industry funds. Methods: Information about policies and practices regarding research funding and donations from 1996 - 1999 was requested from the 16 Canadian faculties of medicine and their parent universities, as part of a larger cross-sectional survey-centred study that examined links between the tobacco industry and Canadian universities. Results: All 16 faculties of medicine (100 %) reported on research funding and 11 / 16 (70 %) reported on donations from the tobacco industry. Twenty-five percent (4 / 16) of the faculties received research funding from the tobacco industry and 27 % (3 / 11) received donations. No Canadian medical school had a policy <b>that</b> banned tobacco <b>industr...</b>|$|R
40|$|With Animal Welfare {{issues are}} {{becoming}} more prominent in the animal agriculture community, especially {{with the passing of}} California’s Proposition 2 during the November 2008 elections. This proposition, known as the Prevention of Farm Animal Cruelty Act, mandates that laying hens, pigs and veal calves have the ability to stand up, turn around and lay down without any hindrance. In response, egg producers throughout the country are questioning what impacts regulations similar to Proposition 2 will have on their industry. This concern extends even to smaller egg producing states, including Oregon. To assess the possible impacts of these regulations, should they be applied to the Oregon egg industry, it was important to first analyze the current state of Oregon’s egg industry including cage, cage free and free range production, followed by estimating the change in the cost of producing eggs if the California regulations were applied to the Oregon egg industry. Once these analyses were performed the economic importance of the existing industry before and after these new regulations, was assessed through the use of the IMPLAN Pro impact analysis software. The results of the research showed <b>that</b> Oregon’s egg <b>industr...</b>|$|R
40|$|The chemica ls and meta ls inc luded in {{this report}} are those <b>that</b> are {{produced}} <b>industr</b> ia l ly by e lectrochemica l methods, those that are of s ignif icant interest o the mem-bers of the IEEE Divis ion of the Society, or those that are consumed or used by the electrolyt ic industr ies. Table I is a l ist ing of the chemica ls and metals inc luded in this re-port, a long wi th the price per metr ic ton (metric ton = 1000 kg), the product ion in the U. S. for 1990, {{and the value of}} that product ion. To put the total value of about $ 21 bil-l ion for these 16 chemica ls and metals in perspect ive, steel p roduct ion in the U. S. for 1990 was est imated at 89 mi l l ion metr ic tons and was va lued at $ 51 bi l l ion (1). The est imated gross nat ional p roduct for the U. S. economy for 1990 was est imated at $ 5, 480 bi l l ion (1). The product ion costs of chemica ls and metals p roduced by electrolyt ic methods are l inked closely to electrical energy costs. Many of the larger chlor-alkal i p roducers have cogenerat ion facil it ies and produce their own elec-tr ic ity (3). E lectr ic i ty costs vary widely from country to country and are also dependent on locat ion wi th in a coun-try. A l though industr ia l electrical rates are pub l i shed in the U. S., average electr ic ity costs to large industr ia l users are not d isc losed (3). In Table II are the est imated indus-trial rates that might be incurred by large chlor-alkal i pro-ducers located in d i f ferent countr ies around the world. In general if the electr ic ity is purchased f rom a util ity, alumi-num smelters can get a somewhat cheaper ate than chlor-alkal i p roducers (3). The rates l isted in Table II range from a low of $ 0. 009 /kWh for hydroelectr ic generated power in the U. S., to a h igh of $ 0. 072 /kWh for electr ic ity p roduced in Ind ia (3). As a compar ison, the average U. S. industr ia l user paid about $ 0. 047 /kWh in 1989 and the average U. S. resi-dent ia l rate was $ 0. 076 /kWh (4) ...|$|R
