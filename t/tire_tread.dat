2500|$|Mining, construction, and {{industry}} employ about twenty {{three percent of}} the population. Industry is mostly limited {{to the production of}} clothes in small workshops in Camargo, Los Encinos, San Lorenzo, Las Enramadas, La Vega, Peñamiller and La Misión de Palmas, employing just over two hundred people. There is also a workshop in La Misión de Palmas that makes sandals with <b>tire</b> <b>tread</b> soles that employs twenty five people. Soccer balls stitched by hand are made by about 350 people working at home in about twenty communities, mostly by women and school-aged children to allow them to earn money without leaving home to supplement family income. [...] Local handcrafts include belts decorated with a type of embroidery. Various articles are made with willow branches such as baskets and hats, mostly made in San Lorenzo and Villa Emiliano Zapata and sold in Tequisquiapan. [...] Rope is made in Las Mesas, El Cobre, Agua de Pedro, Puerto de Ojo de Agua and Aposentos, with items such as baskets and brooms made from reeds in the municipal seat. There are various mineral deposits in the municipality with mercury having been the most extracted. There were 128 mines during the 1960s and early 1970s, but the demand for mercury steeply declined after the Vietnam War. There are still small deposits of gold, silver, copper, zinc antimony and bauxite. There are stone quarries which produce marble, onyx, and sandstone in various colors.|$|E

One week after her disappearance, the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) conducted an extensive canvassing of all motorists using the highway near her home from 7 pm on February 4, 2010, to 6 am on the following day, looking for the unusual <b>tire</b> <b>treads.</b> Williams was driving his Nissan Pathfinder that day—rather than the BMW he usually drove—and an officer noticed the resemblance of his <b>tire</b> <b>treads.</b> These were subsequently matched to the treads near Lloyd's home.|$|R

50|$|Studdable {{tires are}} {{manufactured}} with molded holes on the rubber <b>tire</b> <b>tread.</b> Typically, there are 80 to 100 molded holes per tire for stud insertion. The insertion {{is done by}} using a special tool that spreads the rubber hole so that a stud jacket can be inserted and the flange {{at the bottom of}} the jacket can be fitted nicely to the bottom of the hole. The metal studs come in specific heights to match the depths of the holes molded into the <b>tire</b> <b>tread</b> based on the tread depths. For this reason, stud metals can only be inserted when the tires have not been driven on. A proper stud insertion results in the metal jacket that is flush with the surface of the <b>tire</b> <b>tread</b> having only the pin part that protrudes.|$|E

50|$|Interestingly, tires {{actually}} have more traction {{when they are}} bald, because there is more surface area making contact with the road.

50|$|Grousers are devices {{intended}} {{to increase the}} traction of continuous tracks, especially in loose material such as soil or snow. This is done by increasing contact with the ground with protrusions, similar to conventional <b>tire</b> <b>treads,</b> and analogous to athletes' cleated shoes. On tanks and armoured vehicles, grousers are usually pads attached to the tracks; but on construction vehicles they may {{take the form of}} flat plates or bars.|$|R
