I'd like to let you all know, despite the situation – I know {{all of you are}} still convinced that I'm the person that killed your father, your son and your brother, but I am innocent. The incident that happened that night was not my fault. I did not have a gun that night. I did not shoot your family member. But I am so sorry for your loss. I really am – sincerely. All I can ask is that each of you look deeper into this case, so that you really will finally see the truth. I ask my family and friends <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>all</b> continue to pray, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>all</b> continue to forgive. Continue to fight this fight. For those about to take my life, may God have mercy on all of your souls. God bless you all. He was declared dead at 11:08pm EDT.|$|E

6000|$|... "Ah, don't tell me {{you have}} had any sorrows," [...] Felix rejoined. [...] "I did n't suppose it, and I {{did n't mean to}} allude to them. I simply meant <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>all</b> don't amuse yourselves." ...|$|E
