5|$|The tale's disappointing qualities {{have been}} {{ascribed}} to Potter's growing {{lack of interest}} in writing for children, to pressure from her publisher for yet another book, and to Potter's desire to exploit the lucrative American market. Potter's artistically successful books were written for specific children; Timmy Tiptoes however was composed for Potter's amorphous, ill-defined American fanbase. By 1911, the demands of her aging parents and the business operations at her working farm, Hill Top, occupied much of Potter's <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>attention</b> to the exclusion of nearly everything else, and are accounted as some {{of the reasons for the}} author's declining artistry and her {{lack of interest in}} producing children's books.|$|E
5000|$|What can be {{observed}} in the test are the actual reaction times. A reaction time is the sum of a series of alternating distraction <b>times</b> <b>and</b> <b>attention</b> <b>times,</b> which cannot {{be observed}}. It is, nevertheless, possible to estimate from the observable reaction times some properties of the latent process of distraction <b>times</b> <b>and</b> <b>attention</b> <b>times,</b> i.e., the average distraction time, the average <b>attention</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> the ratio a1/a0.

50|$|The T.O.V.A. {{measures}} a set {{of different}} variables {{to determine whether or}} not response <b>times</b> <b>and</b> <b>attention</b> is at the normal range for the sex and age of the test taker.

50|$|It {{is further}} assumed, {{that when the}} {{inhibition}} increases during a state of attention, depending {{on the amount of}} increase, the inclination to switch to a distraction state also increases. When inhibition decreases during a state of distraction, depending on the amount of decrease, the inclination to switch to an attention state increases. The inclination to switch from one state to the other is mathematically described as a transition rate or hazard rate, making the whole process of alternating distraction <b>times</b> <b>and</b> <b>attention</b> <b>times</b> a stochastic process.|$|R
5|$|The {{war effort}} {{was the source}} of {{continued}} disparagement of Lincoln, and dominated his <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>attention.</b> From the start, it was clear that bipartisan support would be essential to success in the war effort, and any manner of compromise alienated factions {{on both sides of the}} aisle, such as the appointment of Republicans and Democrats to command positions in the Union Army. Copperheads criticized Lincoln for refusing to compromise on the slavery issue. Conversely, the Radical Republicans criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery. On August 6, 1861, Lincoln signed the Confiscation Act that authorized judiciary proceedings to confiscate and free slaves who were used to support the Confederate war effort. In practice, the law had little effect, but it did signal political support for abolishing slavery in the Confederacy.|$|E

25|$|The {{majority}} of the information available {{on the subject of}} SGCs comes from research which was focused on the sensory neurons that the SGCs surround rather than the SGCs themselves. In the future, researchers plan to give more <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>attention</b> to the SGCs, which have many supportive and protective functions essential for life. Neurotransmitter and hormone receptors on SGCs in situ rather than in culture will likely be explored and definitively characterized. Changes in the receptors caused by various mutations and diseases will also be explored {{in order to determine the}} effect of these conditions. Additionally, the mechanisms behind neuronal-SGC communication is essentially unidentified, though it is likely that the various receptors both the neurons and SGCs have are used for chemical signaling, perhaps with P2Y. Ca2+ and NO and their effects must also be observed to gain further understanding of interactions between the two types of cells. Finally, the possibility of an influence of SGCs on synaptic transmission within autonomic ganglia provides another direction for future research.|$|E

The Watson case was based on the real-life 1988 Baltimore slaying of Latonya Kim Wallace, which is chronicled in , the 1991 David Simon non-fiction book about a Baltimore Police Department, which was adapted into the Homicide series. [...] "Ghost of a Chance" [...] introduced the concept of a [...] "red ball", which is a police jargon phrase used in the episode to describe the Adena Watson murder. A red ball is a high-profile case that draws such close media and political attention, that it diverts <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>attention</b> away from other cases in the homicide department.

500|$|Following her {{acquisition}} of Hill Top Farm in 1905 in Lancashire (now Cumbria), Potter began her most creative and productive {{years as a}} children's author and illustrator. By {{the end of the}} decade, however, she had grown weary of writing for children. Her eyesight was failing, and the demands of operating her farm and caring for her aging parents limited the amount of <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>attention</b> she could allocate to the production of books. In 1912 however, she brought Peter Rabbit and his kin together for one last time in The Tale of Mr. Tod. She thought her editors too cautious and too concerned about offending the public, and knew she was capable of creating more complex characters and plots. In Mr. Tod she offered her fans two villainous characters [...] Mr. Tod and Tommy Brock, a fox and a badger. The Tale of Mr. Tod and the book to follow in 1913, The Tale of Pigling Bland, were her last completely original works. Her marriage to William Heelis in October 1913 effectively put an end to her career as a children's author and illustrator, but she continued to produce sporadically over the following years at the demand of fans and publisher, though relying upon decades-old ideas and sketches rather than new concepts and illustrations.|$|E
500|$|Although Wipeout 2048 and Wipeout HD have {{a shared}} shader program {{and did not}} require {{retooling}} for the Vita's architecture, Roberts said that a [...] "great deal" [...] of <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>attention</b> was spent fine-tuning the game's shader effects for the Vita's GPU. Lovegrove thought that the method of working on a PlayStation 3 and its handheld counterpart was identical (a sentiment generally shared by the team), and Roberts said that the systems' similarities helped the team [...] "get moving quickly". Roberts added that the game's lighting system was identical to that of Wipeout HD; both games' ships shared image-based lighting, with blended diffuse and specular highlights effects and the vertex-based lighting system used for weaponry. According to Roberts, {{the main difference between}} the games was PlayStation Vita's utilisation of the effects via the GPU; PlayStation 3 relied on SPUs. The team decided to use anti-aliased colour buffers for real-time shadow rendering, instead of depth buffers. This gave the game greater transparency effects, since the memory cost of anti-aliasing was 8 bits per pixel; therefore, 4x MSAA (multisample anti-aliasing) buffers contained the same amount of memory as a 32-bit depth buffer. Another feature which Roberts considered an improvement was tone mapping (partly due to Vita's superior support of buffer formats), which gave Wipeout 2048 better exposure control and bloom effects.|$|E

40|$|We use {{computational}} modelling {{to examine}} the ability of evidence accumulation models to produce the reaction <b>time</b> distributions <b>and</b> attentional biases found in behavioural and eye-tracking research. We focus upon simulating reaction <b>times</b> <b>and</b> <b>attention</b> in binary choice with particular emphasis upon whether different models can predict the late onset bias (LOB), commonly found in eye movements during choice (sometimes called the gaze cascade). The first finding is that this bias is predicted by models even when attention is entirely random and independent of the choice process. This shows that the LOB is not evidence of a feedback loop between evidence accumulation <b>and</b> <b>attention.</b> Second, we examine models with a relative evidence decision rule and an absolute evidence rule. In the relative models a decision is made once the difference in evidence accumulated for two items reaches a threshold. In the absolute models, a decision is made once one item accumulates {{a certain amount of}} evidence, independently of how much is accumulated for a competitor. Our core result is simple – the existence of the late onset gaze bias to the option ultimately chosen, together with a positively skewed reaction time distribution means that the stopping rule must be relative not absolute. A large scale grid search of parameter space shows that absolute threshold models struggle to predict these phenomena even when incorporating evidence decay and assumptions of either mutual inhibition or feed forward inhibition.
