Yet his masterpiece, I the Supreme, which {{first came out}} in Spanish in 1974 and finally reaches the English-reading public now, in a masterly translation by Helen Lane, {{is the kind of}} summa that absorbs everything that the writer has done before. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>Mr.</b> Roa Bastos' dialogue with himself through history and through a monstrous historical figure whom he has to imagine and understand if he is ever to imagine and understand himself and his people." ...|$|E

[...] While he did work in a steel mill, Schulz insisted that he did not [...] "come out" [...] of the steel mill to play {{football}}. [...] Instead, Schulz said he [...] "went into" [...] the mill to harden himself up for the football season. [...] When asked years later how he got to Michigan, Schulz recalled that, in the summer of 1904, he was working in the mill and had received several offers to play football. [...] One day, his father called to say that Fielding Yost of Michigan was in his office. [...] Schulz ran down the street and rushed into his father's office, where he was introduced to Yost. [...] His father promptly told him, [...] "Adolph, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>Mr.</b> Yost. [...] You are to play football for him at Michigan. [...] We have made all the arrangements".|$|E
