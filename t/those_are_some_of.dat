500|$|Danny Elfman {{was worried}} the {{characterization}} of Oogie Boogie would be considered racist by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). Elfman's predictions came true; however, director Henry Selick stated the character {{was inspired by the}} Betty Boop cartoon The Old Man of the Mountain. [...] "Cab Calloway would dance his inimitable jazz dance and sing 'Minnie the Moocher' or 'Old Man of the Mountain', and they would rotoscope him, trace him, turn him into a cartoon character, often transforming him into an animal, like a walrus," [...] Selick continued. [...] "I think <b>those</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the most inventive moments in cartoon history, in no way racist, even though he was sometimes a villain. We went with Ken Page, who is a black singer, and he had no problem with it".|$|E

[...] Ken Denmead of Wired said the first module is a [...] "pretty easy crash-and-grab," [...] the second contains [...] "some really excellent treasure," [...] but the third is [...] "the end-all, be-all of hack-fests". According to Denmead, the hill giant adventure does not prepare players for the later adventures. Describing the difficulty of battling the fire giants he said, [...] "remember Bambi Versus Godzilla? You're Bambi".|$|E
500|$|During {{press for}} the popular 2015 film Straight Outta Compton, {{questions}} about the portrayal and behavior of Dr. Dre and other prominent figures in the rap community about violence against women – and the question about its absence in the film – were raised. The discussion about the film led to Dr. Dre addressing his past behavior in the press. In August 2015, {{in an interview with}} Rolling Stone, Dre lamented his abusive past, saying, [...] "I made some fucking horrible mistakes in my life. I was young, fucking stupid. I would say all the allegations aren't true—some of them are. <b>Those</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the things that I would like to take back. It was really fucked up.

50|$|According {{to her own}} later account, she had {{recognized}} the Báb's religious station before the Báb had declared his mission to Mulla Husayn. She later recognized Bahá'u'lláh's claim, and became a Bahá'í. She kept in correspondence with Bahá'u'lláh while she had returned to Shiraz and lived in her previous home. She was greatly revered by the Bahá’ís; many visited her whilst journeying to see Bahá’u’lláh. One occasion the very young Fátimih Nahrí of Isfahán, accompanied by her brother, visited. “They stayed for fifteen days, and <b>those</b> <b>were</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the happiest days of my life” she later reflected.|$|R

40|$|Currently {{distributed}} {{business process}} (re) design (resulting in components of business networks) basically relies on technical criteria. And {{that are the}} main purposes of most research projects supported by EC. Through {{the process of building}} a European Research Area, this means a strong influence in the national research programmes. However it is generally accepted that it should also take into account social criteria and aspects such as the quality of working life, or participation in decision processes. <b>Those</b> <b>were</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the objectives of projects in de 80 s decade, and framed <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the main concepts and scientific approaches to work organisation. The democratic participation of network and organisations members in the design process is a critical success factor. This is not accepted by everyone, but is based in sufficient case studies. Nevertheless, in order to achieve an optimization that can satisfying the requirements of agility of a network of enterprises, more complex design methods must be developed. Thus, the support to the collaborative design of distributed work in a network of enterprises, through a concurrent approaching business processes, work organisation and task content is a key factor to achieve such purposes. Increasing needs in terms of amounts of information, agility, and support for collaboration without time and space constrains, imposes the use of a computer-based model. ...|$|R

50|$|On April 1920, Sadiq was {{permitted}} {{entry into the}} United States. Possibly attracted to New York's reputed culture, he journeyed {{to the city and}} assembled the first national headquarters of the Ahmadiyya movement on Manhattan's Madison Avenue. As a philologist, with proficiency in Arabic and Hebrew linguistics, Sadiq successfully published articles on Islam in multiple American periodicals within a period of a few months, including in the New York Times. Moreover, as a lecturer and a charismatic public speaker, Sadiq secured approximately fifty lectures across several cities in the Northeast, including Chicago, Detroit, Grand Havens in Michigan and his locale, New York City. As such, within a period of a few weeks, a dozen people of Christian and Muslim backgrounds converted to the Ahmadiyya interpretation <b>of</b> Islam. Among <b>those</b> <b>were</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the earliest converts to Islam in the United States, who converted to Islam in the early 1900s, such as Ahmad Anderson and George Baker. Whilst a missionary in England, before his arrival into the United States, Sadiq had a dream concerning a female American convert to the faith. The moment S.W.Sobolewski walked into the Community’s headquarters on Madison Avenue, Sadiq interpreted her to be the fulfilment of his dream. Sobolewski would later join the movement, and be given the name Fatimah Mustafa. She became renowned as the first white American female to convert to Islam. Nonetheless, the most active female preacher of the movement during the 1920s was an African American, Madame Rahatullah.|$|R

50|$|Objections to the Constitution in France can be broadly {{divided into}} two camps. On the left, many {{expressed}} {{the view that the}} Constitution would enforce a neoliberal economic model.

The Radical Party of the Left, another ally of the Socialist Party, was divided on the question: its main representatives were for the Constitution, while Christiane Taubira, who was candidate for the PRG in 2002, was against it.|$|R

Evans wore a prosthetic jaw while filming the scene to cover the beard he had grown. Shawarma sales in Los Angeles, St. Louis, and Boston reportedly skyrocketed in the days following the film's release. Whedon stated the inspiration for the shawarma scene came from the events surrounding the filming of the scene where Fred dies in Wesley's arms in the Angel episode, [...] "A Hole in the World".
