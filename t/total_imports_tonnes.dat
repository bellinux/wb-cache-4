In August 2011, the food minister of Ukraine Mykola Prysyazhnyuk paid an official visited Bangladesh to explore potential ways for cooperation in the agricultural field.

5000|$|As of 2005, {{in terms}} of U.S. dollars, Morocco was ranked 89th among U.S. trading {{importers}} and 79th among U.S. exporters.

As of 2003, Morocco exported approximately 2.9% of its total exports to the U.S., while it imported approximately 4.1% of its <b>total</b> <b>imports</b> from the U.S.. These numbers show that U.S. trade with Morocco is almost nil when compared with Moroccan trade with the U.S. Therefore, the USMFTA will potentially have a much larger effect on the Moroccan government.|$|R

The study estimates the comparison for shares of the trading partners between 2011 and 2030. Canada is becoming a more and more important trade partner with China. Australia and New Zealand account for only 1.09 % of China’s <b>total</b> <b>imports</b> in 2030, although they still have a great potential for growth. Russia {{is expected to}} account for 3.31 % of China’s <b>total</b> <b>imports.</b> The USA is likely to replace Japan to become the largest international supplier for China along with rest of Asia. Shares of Korea and Japan are estimated to decline significantly from 2011 to 2030. The BAU results indicate that China’s import partners are expected to be more diverse in 2030 than in 2011 which are assumed to be good for China. This is because trade partner diversification might provide cheaper goods and thus favor trade policies for China.|$|R
