5|$|Opponents of the FairTax {{argue that}} {{imposing}} a national retail sales tax would drive transactions underground {{and create a}} vast underground economy. Under a retail sales tax system, the purchase of intermediate goods and services that are factors of production are not taxed, since those goods would produce a final retail good that would be taxed. Individuals and businesses {{may be able to}} manipulate the tax system by claiming that purchases are for intermediate goods, when in fact they are final purchases that should be taxed. Proponents point out that a business is required to have a registered seller's certificate on file, and must keep complete records of all transactions for six years. Businesses must also record all taxable goods bought for seven years. They are required to report these sales every month (see Personal vs. business purchases). The government could also stipulate that all retail sellers provide buyers with a written receipt, regardless of <b>transaction</b> <b>type</b> (cash, credit, etc.), which would create a paper trail for evasion with risk of having the buyer turn them in (the FairTax authorizes a reward for reporting tax cheats).|$|E

The proposed solution is novel in that it entails the use of a description logic (DL) reasoner to find cases in which extended indices can be combined or simplified...|$|R

40|$|This study tested whether {{contract}} farming or farmers professional cooperatives (FPCs) improved the social benefit of pork production and income of breeding farmers in China. The main concern {{of this study}} is whether institutional arrangement like {{contract farming}} or FPCs actually improved the welfare of farmers as expected. To answer this question accurately, we estimated the differentiated market demand of pork products in order to quantify the benefit by <b>transaction</b> <b>types.</b> Our study finds that contract farming or FPCs improved the benefits of pork products, but farmer's income remained lower than that of traditional <b>transaction</b> <b>types.</b> This finding is new in terms of quantifying distribution of the economic values among sales outlets, agro-firms and farmers. It is more reliable because it explicitly captures impacts from both demand side and supply side by structural estimation. In practice, we need to keep it mind the bargaining power of small farmers will not improve instantly even when the contract farming or FPCs are introduced...|$|R

50|$|A {{summary of}} a Burstcoin {{transaction}} {{is as follows}} : The sender details the parameters for the required <b>transaction</b> <b>type</b> (sending money, creating an alias, transmitting a message, issuing an asset or an order for an asset). All values for the transaction inputs are bounds checked for validity. If the transaction {{is found to be}} valid then the public key for the generating account is computed using the supplied secret passphrase. A new transaction is created, with a type and sub-type value set to match the type of transaction being created. All specified parameters are included in the Transaction object. A unique transaction ID is generated with the creation of the object. The transaction is digitally signed using the sending account's private key. The encrypted transaction data is placed within a message instructing network peers to process the transaction. The transaction is then broadcast to all peers on the network. Burstcoin transactions are based on the Nxt code base. A detailed explanation of the transaction process can be found on its wiki page.|$|E
