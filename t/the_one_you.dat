500|$|In 2005, British indie band Half Man Half Biscuitperhaps {{best known}} for [...] "The Trumpton Riots" [...] and [...] "Dickie Davies Eyes"included a song {{entitled}} [...] "For What Is Chatteris..." [...] on their award-winning Achtung Bono album. The song extolled {{the virtues of the}} town, offset against how unsatisfying the best place in the world can suddenly become when <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>you</b> love is no longer there: [...] "a market town that lacks quintessence / that's Chatteris without your presence". News of the song made the headlines of the Cambridgeshire Times and the Peterborough Evening Telegraph during September 2005, a month before the album's official release.|$|E
500|$|Authors Tracey West and Katherine Noll called Charizard the [...] "best Fire type Pokémon" [...] and the [...] "third best Pokémon overall". They {{wrote that}} [...] "there {{was nothing else}} that could better fit that spot" [...] and that [...] "it has won [...] hearts and had [...] cheering for more." [...] 1UP editor Kat Bailey {{expressed}} concern about which Pokémon could follow the player in Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver, stating [...] "allowing popular favorites like Charizard would go over quite well". The Daily Cardinal editor Kyle Sparks called Charizard [...] "the most dominant Pokémon in the whole universe, a force of sheer strength". In a poll conducted by IGN, it was voted as the [...] "best Pokémon", where the staff commented about remembering being torn between choosing Blastoise and Charizard {{at the start of}} the game. In a poll by Official Nintendo Magazine, Charizard was voted as the [...] "best Fire-type Pokémon". They stated, [...] "not only is Charizard your favourite fire Pokémon, but it is probably one of the most popular 'mon of all time". Kotaku editor Patricia Hernandez criticized Charizard's Y Mega Evolution for not differing enough from Charizard's original design, while praising Mega Charizard X for changing color, and turning Charizard into a dragon-type. Game Informer ranked Charizard as the [...] "coolest Pokémon out of the original 151", describing it as [...] "Powerful, gigantic, and imposing". They further commented that [...] "Pikachu may be <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>you</b> recognize, but Charizard is <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>you</b> want." ...|$|E

James Ward argues that Icke's underlying message is hopeful, and that therein lies his appeal: as Icke said at Wembley in 2012, [...] "If we want a world of love and peace, {{we have to be}} loving and peaceful with everyone, even people we don't like." ...|$|E

500|$|The first {{event to}} take place was the downhill, on 9 February. This {{consisted}} of a single run each; Guèye finished in last position {{with a time of}} 2:12.84, over 22 seconds behind Patrick Ortlieb of Austria who took the gold medal. Gomis was one of nine skiers who failed to complete their run, the first of several incomplete runs by the ski instructor {{during the course of the}} Games. This would later be referred to by The Washington Post as a [...] "world-class agony-of-defeat spill". His performances were referenced by The Record as [...] "Gomis was <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>you</b> may have seen on the highlights, doing unplanned cartwheels, nosedives, and slides down the hill".|$|E
500|$|The lyrics for [...] "My Happiness" [...] {{were written}} by Bernard Fanning, Powderfinger's lead singer and songwriter. The rest of the band are co-credited with Fanning for {{composing}} the track. The song describes feelings of love and separation; Sains Pennie Dennison said it described [...] "the pining feeling you experience when you spend time away from <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>you</b> love". Fanning called it [...] "a sad story of touring and the absence loneliness that comes with it". The extensive time spent touring took its toll on the band, {{and it was on}} the back of this that Fanning wrote [...] "My Happiness". Thus, he expressed confusion at its being considered a romantic song.|$|E
500|$|Albert Bouchard {{began writing}} music for Imaginos {{following}} {{the release of}} the band's first album in 1972. There were plans as early as 1975 to release a concept album dedicated to Pearlman's scripts, but the material was not ready. All of the songs had been written by 1977, with the participation of various band members, and at least four of them ("Astronomy", [...] "In the Presence of Another World", [...] "I Am <b>the</b> <b>One</b> <b>You</b> Warned Me Of", [...] "Imaginos") were completed and demoed during the recording sessions for the album Spectres. Demos of the other tracks were recorded by A. Bouchard and remained in various stages of development during the following years, with the band uninterested in pursuing the Imaginos project that Albert Bouchard and Sandy Pearlman had been insistently proposing.|$|E

500|$|The first segment, [...] "The Devil and Homer Simpson", {{was written}} by Daniels and McGrath. The first time Devil Flanders appears, he looks {{the same as the}} devil Chernabog from the 1940 Walt Disney {{produced}} film Fantasia; Silverman particularly admired the animation in that sequence. Oakley loved the idea of Flanders being the Devil because he is <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>you</b> would least expect. He also thought Harry Shearer {{did a good job of}} playing Flanders in a much darker way, while remaining very true to the character. Many scenes had to be cut to shorten the segment, including one that showed Homer's severed head being used as a bowling ball by a demon in hell. This scene later appeared in the clip show episode [...] "The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular", which aired in the show's seventh season.|$|E
500|$|Blue Öyster Cult {{interrupted}} their {{schedule of}} US shows only {{just before the}} album release in June 1988, to familiarize the band members with the new material. The 1987 formation with Bloom, Roeser, Lanier, Rogers and Riddle remained the closest available to a full reunion, given J. Bouchard's unwillingness to participate and the opposition to A. Bouchard. The Imaginos Tour began in the East Coast of the US in July, and continued on {{to most of the}} States. The set lists were based mainly on old material and included only two or three songs from Imaginos, usually [...] "I Am <b>the</b> <b>One</b> <b>You</b> Warned Me Of", [...] "In the Presence of Another World" [...] and the new version of [...] "Astronomy". Blue Öyster Cult visited Canada in January 1989, France in February, the United Kingdom in March, and concluded their European tour in Germany in April.|$|E
500|$|Already a star at {{the time}} of release, Knightley's {{appearance}} in the film was emphasised by featuring her in all promotional materials (similar to Colin Firth's prominent appearance in the 1995 adaptation). Several commentators likened the main poster of Pride & Prejudice to that of 1995's Sense and Sensibility, which was seen as an attempt to attract the same demographic. Advertising noted that the film came [...] "from the producers of Bridget Jones's Diary", a 2001 romantic comedy film, before mentioning Austen. Leading up to the release, fans were allowed to download pictures and screensavers online, which emphasised the differences between Pride & Prejudice and previous adaptations. Lydia Martin wrote that in contrast to past Pride and Prejudice productions, marketing materials downplayed the [...] "suggested antagonism between the heroes" [...] in favour of highlighting a [...] "romantic relationship", as can be seen with the positioning of the characters {{as well as with the}} tagline, [...] "Sometimes the last person on earth you want to be with is <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>you</b> can't be without." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{songs on}} Marquee Moon {{inspired}} interpretations {{from a variety}} of sources, but Verlaine conceded he did not understand the meaning behind much of his lyrics. He drew on influences from French poetry and wanted to narrate the consciousness or confusion of an experience rather than its specific details. He compared the songs to [...] "a little moment of discovery or releasing something or being in a certain time or place and having a certain understanding of something". Verlaine also used puns and double-entendres in his lyrics, which he said were atmospheric and conveyed the meaning of a song implicitly. [...] "See No Evil" [...] opens with the narrator's [...] and closes with an imperative about limitless possibilities: [...] "Runnin' wild with the one I love / Pull down the future with <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>you</b> love". In the refrain to [...] "Venus", the narrator falls into [...] "the arms of Venus de Milo". Verlaine explained his reference to the armless statue as [...] "a term for a state of feeling. They're loving [...] arms".|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics of}} [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] {{are about a}} gender-swapping thought experiment, through which Beyoncé {{analyses}} the ideologies of a tense relationship. As she sings about things she would do {{if she were a}} boy, Beyoncé highlights the vulnerability of a woman and ponders how things would be different if men had women's sense of empathy. During {{the first part of the}} ballad, Beyoncé alternates between the role of her flawed partner and that of the better man she would be. In the first verse, she envisions herself impersonating her unfeeling love interest as she sings about consuming beer with other men, chasing after girls, and treating her lover cruelly, before adding that she would never be confronted for it. Beyoncé then sings the chorus, in which she gives her vision of life as a better man, [...] "I think I could understand / How it feels to love a girl / I swear I'd be a better man", because she knows [...] "how it hurts when you lose <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>you</b> wanted / 'cause he's taken you for granted and everything you had got destroyed".|$|E
500|$|Walker {{released}} his twenty-third single, [...] "Say No More", for Giant in early 2001. It {{was the first}} single release from his sixth studio album of the same name, peaking at number 33 on the country chart; the only other single, the Jerry Kilgore co-write [...] "If You Ever Feel Like Lovin' Me Again", reached number 27. The latter song was promoted by Giant's parent company, Warner Bros. Records Nashville, as Giant had closed in late 2001. Walker co-produced the album with veteran producers Byron Gallimore and Blake Mevis, and session guitarist Brent Mason. The album also included a song that Walker wrote in high school, and a cover of Ritchie Valens's [...] "La Bamba." [...] Maria Konicki Dinoia of Allmusic rated it three stars, with her review saying that [...] "the sensitivity on this album is so expressive that it {{makes you want to}} run right out and hug <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>you</b> love." [...] Country Standard Time critic Mike Clark considered it a transition to a more country pop-oriented sound, describing the album as being [...] "full of bad lyrics and overwrought production clichés." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{aesthetic}} is the personal, subjective {{realm of}} existence, where an individual lives and extracts pleasure from life only {{for his or}} her own sake. In this realm, one has the possibility of the highest as well as the lowest. The ethical, on the other hand, is the civic realm of existence, where one's value and identity are judged and at times superseded by the objective world. In simple terms, one can choose either to remain oblivious to all that goes on in the world, or to become involved. More specifically, the ethic realm starts with a conscious effort to choose one's life, with a choice to choose. Either way, however, an individual can go too far in these realms and lose sight of his or her true self. Only faith can rescue the individual from these two opposing realms. Either/Or concludes with a brief sermon hinting at the nature of the religious sphere of existence, which Kierkegaard spent most of his publishing career expounding upon. Ultimately, Kierkegaard's challenge is for the reader to [...] "discover a second face hidden behind <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>you</b> see" [...] in him/herself first, and then in others.|$|E
500|$|The {{authors of}} the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, called it [...] "an {{unsurpassed}} episode. It's hard {{to know where to}} start dishing out the praise— Leonard Nimoy's guest appearance, the Monorail song, Marge's narration, the truck full of popcorn..." [...] Robert Canning of IGN strongly praised the episode, stating [...] "It is by far one of the most loved episodes of The Simpsons and can safely be called a classic by any fan. From beginning to end, there's joke after joke after hilarious joke. There's nothing in this half-hour that doesn't work, and {{no matter how many times}} I watch this episode, it never, ever gets old." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of Slant Magazine named it the show's best episode, stating [...] "It's <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>you</b> think of when you think of a Simpsons episode", and is [...] "maybe the show's funniest, and it most perfectly encapsulates what may be the show's overriding theme: People are really stupid and self-serving, but if you give them long enough, they'll eventually bumble toward the right answer." ...|$|E
500|$|Computer and Video Games {{predicted}} that the game [...] "will be <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>you</b> come back to when you've got a full house", and appreciated its [...] "crazy genius" [...] gameplay.

Although video game review website IGN noted that the game was not the best in the Wario series of video games, they still considered it an [...] "essential piece of the Wii collection". The website was also entertained by the single-player mode as well as the multiplayer, especially when [...] "shov the controller off on unsuspecting houseguests or non-gamers months and years down the road". They considered the game's use of the Wii Remote to be [...] "slick and intuitive", the graphics to be [...] "nearly inexplicable", and the sound to be [...] "totally off the wall". GameZone called the game [...] "original and addictive", but noted that it would not appeal to everyone. The Courier-Mail praised the game's use of the Wii's motion-sensitive controllers as one of its best features, which helps push it [...] "over-the-top" [...] as [...] "one of the most inventive games designed for the Wii's interactive controls". Canada's Toronto Sun also appreciated its [...] "novel use" [...] of the Wiimote.|$|E
