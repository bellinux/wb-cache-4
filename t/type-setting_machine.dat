Demokraten acquired its own <b>type-setting</b> <b>machine</b> in October 1918 and a printing press in 1917, which it used from 1 January 1918.

6000|$|In {{the next}} letter {{we get a}} {{sidelight}} on the <b>type-setting</b> <b>machine,</b> [...] the Frankenstein monster that was draining their substance and [...] holding out false hopes of relief and golden return. The program [...] here outlined was one that would continue for several years yet, [...] with the end always in sight, but never quite attained.|$|E
6000|$|He never {{finished}} the Sandwich Islands story {{which he and}} Howells [...] were to dramatize later. His head filled up with other projects, [...] such as publishing plans, reading-tours, and the like. The [...] <b>type-setting</b> <b>machine</b> {{does not appear in}} the letters of this period, [...] but it was an important factor, nevertheless. It was costing [...] several thousand dollars a month for construction and becoming [...] a heavy drain on Mark Twain's finances. It was necessary to [...] recuperate, and the anxiety for a profitable play, or some other [...] adventure that would bring a quick and generous return, grew out [...] of this need.|$|E
60|$|The {{ease with}} which a cub can learn is surprising. Day before {{yesterday}} I saw our newest cub set, perfectly space and perfectly justify 2,150 ems of solid nonpareil {{in an hour and}} distribute the like amount in the same hour--and six hours previously he had never seen the machine or its keyboard. It was a good hour's work for 3-year veterans on the other <b>type-setting</b> <b>machines</b> to do. We have 3 cubs. The dean of the trio is a school youth of 18. Yesterday morning he had been an apprentice on the machine 16 working days (8-hour days); and we speeded him to see what he could do in an hour. In the hour he set 5,900 ems solid nonpareil, and the machine perfectly spaced and justified it, and of course distributed the like amount in the same hour. Considering that a good fair compositor sets 700 and distributes 700 in the one hour, this boy did the work of about 8 x a compositors in that hour. This fact sends all other <b>type-setting</b> <b>machines</b> a thousand miles to the rear, and the best of them will never be heard of again after we publicly exhibit in New York.|$|R
6000|$|We {{have not}} heard of Joe Goodman since the trying days of '90 and [...] '91, when he was seeking to promote the {{fortunes}} of the <b>type-setting</b> [...] <b>machine.</b> Goodman, meantime, who had in turn been miner, printer, [...] publisher, and farmer; had been devoting his energies and genius to [...] something entirely new: he had been translating the prehistoric [...] Mayan inscriptions of Yucatan, and with such success that his work [...] was elaborately published by an association of British scientists. [...] In due time a copy of this publication came to Clemens, who was full [...] of admiration of the great achievement.|$|R
6000|$|Figure first, then, {{a hastily}} erected {{and still more}} hastily {{designed}} building in a dirty, paper-littered back street of old London, {{and a number of}} shabbily dressed men coming and going in this with projectile swiftness, and within this factory companies of printers, tensely active with nimble fingers--they were always speeding up the printers--ply their <b>type-setting</b> <b>machines,</b> and cast and arrange masses of metal in a sort of kitchen inferno, above which, in a beehive of little brightly lit rooms, disheveled men sit and scribble. There is a throbbing of telephones and a clicking of telegraph needles, a rushing of messengers, a running to and fro of heated men, clutching proofs and copy. Then begins a clatter roar of machinery catching the infection, going faster and faster, and whizzing and banging,--engineers, who have never had time to wash since their birth, flying about with oil-cans, while paper runs off its rolls with a shudder of haste. The proprietor you must suppose arriving explosively on a swift motor-car, leaping out before the thing is at a standstill, with letters and documents clutched in his hand, rushing in, resolute to [...] "hustle," [...] getting wonderfully in everybody's way. At the sight of him even the messenger boys who are waiting, get up and scamper to and fro. Sprinkle your vision with collisions, curses, incoherencies. You imagine all the parts of this complex lunatic machine working hysterically toward a crescendo of haste and excitement as the night wears on. At last the only things that seem to travel slowly in all those tearing vibrating premises are the hands of the clock.|$|R
6000|$|If Mark Twain {{had been}} less {{interested}} in the <b>type-setting</b> <b>machine</b> [...] he might possibly have found a profit that winter in the old Sellers [...] play, which he had written with Howells seven years before. The [...] play had eventually been produced at the Lyceum Theatre in New York, [...] with A. P. Burbank in the leading role, and Clemens and Howells as [...] financial backers. But it was a losing investment, nor did it pay [...] any better when Clemens finally sent Burbank with it on the road. [...] Now, however, James A. Herne, a well-known actor and playwright, [...] {{became interested in the}} idea, after a discussion of the matter with [...] Howells, and there seemed a probability that with changes made under [...] Herne's advisement the play might be made sensible and successful.|$|E
6000|$|In {{a letter}} which Mark Twain {{wrote to his}} brother Orion at this [...] period we get {{the first hint of}} a venture which was to play an [...] {{increasingly}} important part in the Hartford home and fortunes during [...] the next ten or a dozen years. This was the <b>type-setting</b> <b>machine</b> [...] investment, which, in the end, all but wrecked Mark Twain's [...] finances. There is but a brief mention of it in the letter to [...] Orion, and the letter itself is not worth preserving, but as [...] references to the [...] "machine" [...] appear with increasing frequency, it [...] seems proper to record here its first mention. In the same letter [...] he suggests to his brother that he undertake an absolutely truthful [...] autobiography, a confession in which nothing is to be withheld. He [...] cites the value of Casanova's memories, and the confessions of [...] Rousseau. Of course, any literary suggestion from [...] "Brother Sam" [...] was [...] gospel to Orion, who began at once piling up manuscript at a great [...] rate.|$|E
6000|$|The <b>type-setting</b> <b>machine</b> {{began to}} loom {{large in the}} background. [...] Clemens {{believed}} it perfected by this time. Paige had got it [...] together again and it was running steadily--or approximately so [...] --setting type at a marvelous speed and with perfect accuracy. In [...] time an expert operator {{would be able to}} set as high as eight [...] thousand ems per hour, or about ten times as much as a good [...] compositor could set and distribute by hand. Those who saw it were [...] convinced--most of them--that the type-setting problem was solved by [...] this great mechanical miracle. If there were any who doubted, it [...] was because of its marvelously minute accuracy which the others only [...] admired. Such accuracy, it was sometimes whispered, required [...] absolutely perfect adjustment, and what would happen when the great [...] inventor--"the poet in steel," [...] as Clemens once called him--was no [...] longer at hand to supervise and to correct the slightest variation. [...] But no such breath of doubt came to Mark Twain; he believed the [...] machine as reliable as a constellation.|$|E
5000|$|For {{some reason}} the women liberation {{movement}} activists in Russia preferred to involve their protégés in printing business which naturally made authorities, who were hunting the proclamations distributors, suspicious. [...] "There were few honest men in the capital who sincerely wanted to provide women with jobs at the time, and Benni was one of them," [...] Leskov wrote. What the latter did first was to bring {{a group of women}} translators to the Severnaya ptchela editorial office, then took them to the Grech house in Saint Petersburgh, where they became known as The Grech commune. This enterprise proved inefficient: Bennihad to do all the work himself and paid his employees from his own pocket. As the commune disintegrated, Benni brought the four <b>type-setting</b> <b>machines</b> into the house and invited four more female communards in. [...] "This enterprise was doomed, like all of the others he's been involved in, for Benni, whom simple men thought to be 'a scheming type', was, in fact, naïve as a child. This tragicomic 'naturalized English subject' who came to Russia with the view of making social-democratic revolution… has demonstrated such inability to organize other people as to quickly turn this new business of his into a joke," [...] Leskov commented. The commune proved a disaster. What was worse, by this time a bunch of male 'communards' have made his flat their home, spending the host's money, stealing his clothes and even driving him off, from time to time. Benni became seriously ill as a result of spending two sleepless nights in the open air on the banks of Neva embankment after a woman, thrown out of her home by husband, came to his flat and settled in his bedroom.|$|R
60|$|I {{have come}} near writing {{you about this}} matter several times, but it wasn't ripe, and I waited. It is ripe, now. It is a <b>type-setting</b> <b>machine</b> which I {{undertook}} to build for the inventor (for a consideration). I have been at it three years and seven months without losing a day, {{at a cost of}} $3,000 a month, and in so private a way that Hartford has known nothing about it. Indeed only a dozen men have known of the matter. I have reported progress {{from time to time to}} the proprietors of the N. Y. Sun, Herald, Times, World, Harper Brothers and John F. Trow; also to the proprietors of the Boston Herald and the Boston Globe. Three years ago I asked all these people to squelch their frantic desire to load up their offices with the Mergenthaler (N. Y. Tribune) machine, and wait for mine and then choose between the two. They have waited--with no very gaudy patience--but still they have waited; and I could prove to them to-day that they have not lost anything by it. But I reserve the proof for the present--except in the case of the N. Y. Herald; I sent an invitation there the other day--a courtesy due a paper which ordered $240,000 worth of our machines long ago when it was still in a crude condition. The Herald has ordered its foreman to come up here next Thursday; but that is the only invitation which will go out for some time yet.|$|E
6000|$|He {{satisfied}} the impassioned demand of his nature for incessant activities {{of every kind}} by taking a personal {{as well as a}} pecuniary interest in the inventions of others. At one moment [...] "the damned human race" [...] was almost to be redeemed by a process of founding brass without air bubbles in it; if this could once be accomplished, as I understood, or misunderstood, brass could be used in art-printing to a degree hitherto impossible. I dare say I have got it wrong, but I am not mistaken as to Clemens's enthusiasm for the process, and his heavy losses in paying its way to ultimate failure. He was simultaneously absorbed in the perfection of a <b>type-setting</b> <b>machine,</b> which he was paying the inventor a salary to bring to a perfection so expensive that it was practically impracticable. We were both printers by trade, and I could take the same interest in this wonderful piece of mechanism that he could; and it was so truly wonderful that it did everything but walk and talk. Its ingenious creator was so bent upon realizing the highest ideal in it that he produced a machine of quite unimpeachable efficiency. But it was so costly, when finished, that it could not be made for less than twenty thousand dollars, if the parts were made by hand. This sum was prohibitive of its introduction, unless the requisite capital could be found for making the parts by machinery, and Clemens spent many months in vainly trying to get this money together. In the mean time simpler machines had been invented and the market filled, and his investment of three hundred thousand dollars in the beautiful miracle remained permanent but not profitable. I once went with him to witness its performance, and it did seem to me the last word in its way, but it had been spoken too exquisitely, too fastidiously. I never heard him devote the inventor to the infernal gods, as he was apt to do with the geniuses he lost money by, and so I think he did not regard him as a traitor.|$|E

50|$|As the {{war years}} went, the newspaper's {{finances}} gradually improved. The Norwegian state became more active in production and trade and contributed many advertisements.
