40|$|Analytic {{measurement}} of serum <b>tumour</b> <b>markers</b> {{is one of}} commonly used methods for cancer risk management in {{certain areas of the}} world (e. g. Taiwan). Recently, cancer screening based on multiple serum <b>tumour</b> <b>markers</b> has been frequently discussed. However, the risk-benefit outcomes appear to be unfavourable for patients because of the low sensitivity and specificity. In this study, cancer screening models based on multiple serum <b>tumour</b> <b>markers</b> were designed using machine learning methods, namely support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbour (KNN), and logistic regression, to improve the screening performance for multiple cancers in a large asymptomatic population. AFP, CEA, CA 19 - 9, CYFRA 21 - 1, and SCC were determined for 20 696 eligible individuals. PSA was measured in men and CA 15 - 3 and CA 125 in women. A variable selection process was applied to select robust variables from these serum <b>tumour</b> <b>markers</b> to design cancer detection models. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value, area under the curve, and Youden index of the models based on single <b>tumour</b> <b>markers,</b> combined test, and machine learning methods were compared. Moreover, relative risk reduction, absolute risk reduction (ARR), and absolute risk increase (ARI) were evaluated. To design cancer detection models using machine learning methods, CYFRA 21 - 1 and SCC were selected for women, and all <b>tumour</b> <b>markers</b> were selected for men. SVM and KNN models significantly outperformed the single <b>tumour</b> <b>markers</b> and the combined test for men. All 3 studied machine learning methods outperformed single <b>tumour</b> <b>markers</b> and the combined test for women. For either men or women, the ARRs were between 0. 003 - 0. 008; the ARIs were between 0. 119 - 0. 306. Machine learning methods outperformed the combined test in analysing multiple <b>tumour</b> <b>markers</b> for cancer detection. However, cancer screening based solely on the application of multiple <b>tumour</b> <b>markers</b> remains unfavourable because of the inadequate PPV, ARR, and ARI, even when machine learning methods were incorporated into the analysis...|$|R

The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the value of a serum <b>tumour</b> <b>marker</b> panel in selecting among the patients with equivocal BS those with bone metastases. Between January 1986 and December 1995, 297 breast cancer patients were followed-up after mastectomy with serial determinations of a CEA-TPA-CA 15. 3 <b>tumour</b> <b>marker</b> panel, BS and liver echography. The <b>tumour</b> <b>marker</b> panel was used to select patients with equivocal BS for examination of suspicious bone areas by further imaging techniques. Up to December 1995, 158 (53 %) patients showed an equivocal BS and 47 patients developed bone metastases. In the 158 patients with equivocal BS, prolonged clinical and imaging follow-up over 45 months (mean; range 12 – 120) was used to ascertain the presence or absence of bone metastases. In these 158 patients the negative predictive value and positive predictive value of the <b>tumour</b> <b>marker</b> panel to predict bone metastases was 97 % and 75 % respectively. This study shows that in breast cancer patients the CEA-TPA-CA 15. 3 <b>tumour</b> <b>marker</b> panel has a high value in selecting those patients with bone metastases, or at high risk of developing clinically-evident bone metastases, among the large number of subjects with equivocal BS. © 1999 Cancer Research Campaig...|$|E

40|$|To {{assess the}} ability of [18 F]fluorodeoxyglucose {{positron}} emission tomography for the early prediction of response in patients with relapsed metastatic germ cell tumours undergoing salvage high-dose chemotherapy. The role of positron emission tomography was compared with established means of tumour response assessment such as CT scans/MRI and serum <b>tumour</b> <b>marker</b> changes. In addition, positron emission tomography was compared with a current prognostic score which differentiates three prognostic groups with failure-free survival rates ranging from 5 – 50 %. [18 F]fluorodeoxyglucose uptake of metastases from germ cell tumours as well as CT scans and serum <b>tumour</b> <b>marker</b> were acquired after 2 – 3 cycles of induction chemotherapy but {{before the start of}} high-dose chemotherapy and CT scans/serum <b>tumour</b> <b>marker</b> were compared with the baseline examinations in 23 patients with relapsed germ cell tumours. To evaluate the validity of early response prediction by positron emission tomography, radiological monitoring and serum <b>tumour</b> <b>marker</b> decline, histopathologic response after resection of residual masses and/or the clinical course over 6 months after the end of treatment (relapse vs freedom of progression) were used. Overall, 10 patients (43 %) achieved a marker-negative partial remission, three (13 %) a marker-positive partial remission, five (22 %) a disease stabilization and five (22 %) progressed during treatment. Nine patients (39 %) remained progression-free over 6 months following treatment, whereas 14 (61 %) progressed. The outcome of high-dose chemotherapy was correctly predicted by positron emission tomography/CT scan/serum <b>tumour</b> <b>marker</b> in 91 / 59 / 48 %. Eight patients with a favourably predicted outcome by CT scans plus serum <b>tumour</b> <b>marker</b> but a positive positron emission tomography prior to high-dose chemotherapy, failed treatment. This results in the following sensitivities/specificities for the prediction of failure of high-dose chemotherapy: positron emission tomography 100 / 78 %; radiological monitoring 43 / 78 %; serum <b>tumour</b> <b>marker</b> 15 / 100 %. The positive and negative predictive values of positron emission tomography were 88 and 100 %, respectively. As compared with the prognostic score, positron emission tomography was correctly positive in all patients of the three risk groups who failed treatment. In addition, a negative positron emission tomography correctly predicted a favourable outcome in the good and intermediate group. [18 F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography imaging can be used to assess response to chemotherapy in patients with relapsed germ cell tumours early in the course of treatment and may help to identify patients most likely to achieve a favourable response to subsequent high-dose chemotherapy. In patients with response to induction chemotherapy according to CT scans or serum <b>tumour</b> <b>marker</b> evaluation, positron emission tomography seems to add information to detect patients with an overall unfavourable outcome. It may also be a valuable addition to the prognostic model particularly in the good and intermediate group for further selection of patients who will profit from high-dose chemotherapy...|$|E
40|$|Summary The {{clinical}} significance of neuron-specific enolase (NSE) as a <b>tumour</b> <b>marker</b> was evaluated in 54 patients with seminoma. Before orchiectomy NSE was elevated in {{six out of}} 21 patients with stage I seminoma and 11 out of 16 patients with metastases. After orchiectomy NSE normalised in all evaluated stage I cases, but was still elevated in six out of 12 patients with metastatic disease. NSE monitored the effect of cisplatin-based chemotherapy in patients with metastases. In some patients, increased serum NSE was found together with raised levels of human choriogonadotropin (HCG) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), while in others only NSE was elevated.

40|$|Abstract. Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a {{relatively}} rare type of primary liver cancer that originates in the bile duct epithelium. It is an aggressive malignancy typified by unresponsiveness to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Despite advances in radiologic techniques and laboratory diagnostic test, the diagnosis of CCA remains highly challenging. Development in molecular tech-niques has led {{to go into the}} possible use of serum markers in diagnosing of cholangiocarcinoma. This review summarizes the principal characteristics of serum markers of cholangiocarcinoma. The <b>tumour</b> <b>markers</b> used frequently such as Carbohydrate antigen 19 - 9 (CA 19 - 9), Carcinogenic Embryonic antigen (CEA), and Cancer Antigen 125 have shown sufficient sensitivity and specificity to detect and monitor CCA. In particular, the combination of these <b>tumour</b> <b>markers</b> seems to increase their efficiency in diagnosing of cholangiocarcinoma. New markers such as Soluble fragment of cytokeratin 19 (CYFRA 21 - 1) Mucins, <b>Tumour</b> <b>Markers</b> 2 pyruvate-Kinase (TuM 2 − PK) and metalloproteinase- 7 (MMP- 7) have been recently shown to help in the diagnosis of CCA, with in some cases a prognostic value...|$|R
