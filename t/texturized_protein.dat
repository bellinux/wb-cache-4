The moisture, protein and ash content of the stuffing increased {{with an increase in}} the amount of <b>texturized</b> soy <b>protein</b> while the fat content decreased significantly (p 0. 05) difference in appearance, taste and overall acceptability with inclusion of <b>texturized</b> soy <b>protein.</b> However there were significant (p< 0. 05) differences in flavour, texture and willingness to purchase between 100 % beef and 100 % TSP samosas. There was a reduction in the moisture content while the protein, fat, ash and carbohydrate content increased in baked as compared to raw samples, both in the control and TSP 50 samosas. The caloric value of the baked samosas was 24. 07 % lower in TSP added samples compared to 100 % beef samples (control). Lipid oxidation increased with storage time from 0. 25 to 0. 68 mg malonaldehyde/kg in the control and from 0. 21 to 0. 39 mg malonaldehyde/kg in TSP 50 samosas. The oxidation in the control was significantly (p< 0. 05) higher than in TSP 50. The results suggest that TSP granules can be use with up to 50 % addition in samosa products without significant differences in sensory attributes. </p...|$|R

40|$|A {{rapid and}} {{convenient}} method for the precise quantification of epsilon-(gamma-glutamyl) lysine isopeptide in lyophilized proteolytic digests of cross-linked plant protein samples was developed. The isopeptide was baseline-separated from three other isomers containing lysyl and glutamyl residues by reverse-phase {{high-performance liquid chromatography}} after exhaustive proteolytic digestion of the samples cross-linked by a microbial transglutaminase (MTG). Highly selective detection was performed by electrospray mass spectrometry in MS/MS mode. Demonstrating {{the applicability of the}} suggested analytical procedure, enzymatic cross-linking of protein isolates from soy [Glycine max (L.) Mort. ], pea [Pisum sativum L], and the sweet lupin species Lupinus albus L. and Lupinus angustifolius L. was investigated after incubation with 0. 01 g of MTG/ 100 g of protein for 0 - 240 min at 40 degrees C. The liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) method was successfully applied to monitor the kinetics of epsilon-(gamma-glutamyl) lysine isopeptide formation. Since the calculated initial levels of c-(gamma-glutamyl) lysine in the genuine leguminous protein isolates were between 40 and 77 mu mol/ 100 g, an isopeptide detection limit of 0. 5 mu g/mL, corresponding to approximately 50 mu mol/ 100 g of protein, was shown to suffice for quantifying the cross-linking rate enzymatically induced by MTG. Concentrations of epsilon-(gamma-glutamyl) lysine in the <b>texturized</b> <b>proteins</b> ranged from 100 to 500 mu mol/ 100 g of protein...|$|R

Sources of plant protein include legumes such as soy beans (consumed as tofu, tempeh, <b>texturized</b> vegetable <b>protein,</b> soy milk and edamame), peas, peanuts, black beans and chickpeas (the latter often eaten as hummus); grains such as quinoa (pronounced keenwa), brown rice, corn, barley, bulgur and wheat (the latter eaten as bread and seitan); and nuts and seeds. Combinations that contain high amounts of all the essential amino acids include rice and beans, corn and beans, and hummus and whole-wheat pita.|$|R

25|$|Dishes {{based on}} {{soybeans}} are {{a staple of}} vegan diets because soybeans are a complete protein; this means they contain all the essential amino acids for humans and can be relied upon entirely for protein intake. They are consumed most often {{in the form of}} soy milk and tofu (bean curd), which is soy milk mixed with a coagulant. Tofu comes in a variety of textures, depending on water content, from firm, medium firm, and extra firm for stews and stir-fries; to soft or silken for salad dressings, desserts, and shakes. Soy is also eaten in the form of tempeh and <b>texturized</b> vegetable <b>protein</b> (TVP); also known as textured soy protein (TSP), the latter is often used in pasta sauces.|$|R

In this study, the CTAB and DNeasy methods provided good {{quality and quantity of}} DNA from the <b>texturized</b> soy <b>protein,</b> infant formula, and soy milk samples. Concerning the Certified Reference Material consisting of 5 % Roundup Ready® soybean, neither method yielded DNA of good quality. However, the dilution test applied in the CTAB extracts showed no interference of inhibitory substances. The PCR efficiencies of lectin target amplification were not statistically different, and the coefficients of correlation (R²) demonstrated high degree of correlation between the copy numbers and the threshold cycle (Ct) values. ANOVA showed suitable adjustment of the regression and absence of significant linear deviations. The efficiencies of the p 35 S amplification were not statistically different, and all R² values using DNeasy extracts were above 0. 98 with no significant linear deviations. Two out of three R² values using CTAB extracts were lower than 0. 98, corresponding to lower degree of correlation, and the lack-of-fit test showed significant linear deviation in one run. The comparative analysis of the Ct values for the p 35 S and lectin targets demonstrated no statistical significant differences between the analytical curves of each target...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 76 - 80) This study investigates whether {{changes in}} the diet have occurred among graduate students due to the recent increase in food prices. A questionnaire was administered to ten graduate classes at California State University, Northridge. One hundred usable questionnaires were obtained. Responses given by the subjects were analyzed for the following: changes in consumption of certain food items; meatless meals and vegetable protein consumption; convenience food and eating out habits; satisfaction about present diet; food expenditure; and possible relationship between diet and disease. The {{study found that the}} students were eating less beef, pork, sugar, snacks, soft drinks, convenience foods, and that they were eating out less often. The respondents were, however, eating more poultry and vegetables. The students agreed that adults can obtain adequate amounts of protein from a meatless meal, and most were eating such meals; however, the majority did not consume products made from <b>texturized</b> vegetable <b>protein.</b> Only one-third of the students reported that they are eating everything they wanted. Many would like to eat more beef, fish and seafood. The majority of the students agreed that they are spending more money for food now than before, and the average family (2. 7 persons) spent approximately 30 to 39 dollars a week at the supermarket, and five to eight dollars eating out. Most of the dietary changes observed could contribute to a reduction in serum cholesterol levels, and therefore may reduce the incidence of cardiovascular disease...|$|R
40|$|Resumo: A conservação da polpa de corvina (Micropogon furníeri) e castanha (Umbrina canosai), em temperatura de - 30 °C, por 150 dias, e os efeitos da adição de trípolifosfato de sódio, cloreto de sódio e acido ascórbico foram estudados através da determinação de quatro testes: bases voláteis totais, valor "TBA", capacidade de retenção de água e "drip". As amostras tratadas com 0, 1 % de acido ascórbico apresentaram menor oxidação, enquanto que as adicionadas de cloreto de sódio a 1 % mostraram maior capacidade de retenção de água e menor perda de água na descongelação. O teor de bases voláteis totais aumentou de forma idêntica para todas as amostras. Foram preparados hambúrgueres da mesma polpa, misturadas com proteína de soja texturizada a 3 / 3 e 4, 2 % em base seca, e com carne bovina moída na relação 1 : 1. Os hambúrgueres preparados com proteína de soja texturizada e polpa de pescado sem carne bovina apresentaram melhores resultados na avaliação sensorial feita por sete degustadores. Concluímos que a polpa de pescado pode ser utilizada tanto como um substituto de parte da carne bovina em produtos como hambúrgueres tradicionais, como na elaboração de um produto só de pescado. A soja texturizada substitui os outros ingredientes normalmente usados para ligar as partículas de carne e manter o produto coeso, quando cozido, bem como apresenta a vantagem de aportar razoável enriquecimento protéico ao produto finalAbstract: The under {{utilization}} of fish catches {{and the increased}} demand for fish as food has lead us to the scarcity of the oceans. The machine separation of flesh from the bones and skin offers {{a new source of}} a good r aw material for new products, that have a good potential for the introduction of fish of species of low or medium commercial value, in institutional food markets. Two species of fish of this type, Corvina (Micropogon furníeri) and castanha(Umbrina canosai) represent about 30 % of the total catch landed in Rio Grande, RS. The flesh of these non very fatty fish is white with red spots. These are processed as frozen fillets, frozen steaks, and as eviscerated and salted fish. The conservation of a fish paste of corvina and castanha, with and without additives, such as 1 % sodium chloride, 0, 1 % sodium tripolyphosphate, and 0, 1 % ascorbic acid were studied during 150 days of storage at - 30 °C. The samples were analyzed by four tests: total volatile basis, TBA test, water holding capacity, and drip. The first show a uniform deterioration of samples. The TBA test indicates that the 0, 1 % ascorbic acid retard the oxidation of the meat. The samples treated with 1 % sodium chloride denoted the best water holding capacity and less drip, than the samples treated with sodium tripolyphosphatet. The fish paste with <b>texturized</b> soy <b>protein</b> added and with and without beef in teh relation fish-beef (1 : 1) was used to prepare a hamburger. The composition of the hamburgers was as follows; fish and beef - 66 and 60 %; <b>texturized</b> soy <b>protein</b> - 3, 3 and 4, 2 %(dry basis); pork fat - 22, 5 %; salt - 1, 5 %. The hamburger was tested by a 7 member panel trained to prove a tradicional beef hamburbuer. The fish made hamburger rated better that those prepared with fish and beef, it seems that fish paste {{can be used as a}} substitute of part of beef in tradicional hamburger or as the unique animal protein source in a new product, apparently with the same acceptability by the consumer...|$|R
40|$|<b>Texturizing</b> {{products}} by <b>protein</b> setting {{reinforced by}} Microbial Transglutaminase (MTGase), which forms covalent bonds between proteins, {{makes it possible}} to obtain minimally processed products in a raw state that can be commercialized in fresh or cooked products. In the present paper, microbiological analysis determined that restructured products would have a shelf life of up to 14 days (at 2 C) if the pH of the samples were 6. 0. The physicochemical properties of restructured fish muscle with added MTGase (0. 5 - 1. 0 %) set at 5 C for 48 h at different pH (6 and 6. 8) and sodium chloride concentrations (0. 5, 1. 5 and 4. 0 %) were studied. pH had the greatest effect on the raw product's mechanical properties at low or medium NaCl concentrations, while at high NaCl concentrations, no differences between either pH were found. More than 0. 5 % MTGase had very little effect on the mechanical properties of restructured muscle. Journal compilation. © 2010, Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

40|$|Extruded-expelled (EE) soy flours with a {{wide range}} of protein {{dispersibility}} indexes (PDI), and residual oil (RO) levels as well as EE soy flours originating from various value-enhanced soybean varieties were investigated for their functional properties and utilization potential in food systems. Functional properties investigated included protein solubility, emulsification capacity, activity and stability, foaming capacity and stability and water-holding and fat-binding capacities. Food systems investigated included a batter system and meat system. Results from the investigation focused on functional properties of low-fat soy flour (LFSF) {{with a wide}} range of PDI and RO levels showed, in general, LFSF with PDI/RO levels between 42 / 8 and 67 / 11 were more functional proteins when compared with LFSF with lower PDI/RO levels. Additionally, LFSF with this range of PDI/RO levels shared similar functional properties when compared with a 73 PDI, 0. 6 RO defatted soy flour (DFSF). The second investigation involved the production of a standard cake doughnut formulation with one of three LFSF of different PDI/RO levels or a DFSF. These soy flour treatments were added at levels of 3, 5 or 8 % (flour weight basis). The main reason soy flour is added to doughnuts is to decrease the fat absorption of the doughnut during frying. This investigation showed that doughnuts made with LFSF generally did not follow the same trend as DFSF for decreasing fat absorption. Other chemical, quality and sensory attributes showed unpredictable results for doughnuts produced with LFSF. The third study involved characterizing the functional properties of LFSF produced using EE technology, however the starting material was six different value-enhanced soybean varieties and two commodity (non-value-enhanced) soybean varieties. The alteration of certain soybean traits (i. e. fatty acid profile, elimination of lipoxygenase enzymes) did not deleteriously affect functional properties of the LFSF products. Finally, LFSF from the third study was texturized to produce <b>texturized</b> soy <b>protein</b> (TSP). This TSP was then introduced into ground beef patties at a rehydrated level of 30 %. The results from this work indicated that the addition of TSP from value-enhanced LFSF, at a 30 % level, did not have a negative impact on certain chemical, quality and sensory attributes...|$|R
40|$|Reactive {{supercritical}} fluid extrusion (RSCFX) {{is a novel}} integrated process for controlled chemical reactions and continuous generation of expanded extrudates of modified functionalities. Twin screw extruders are ideally suited for highly viscous materials due to their excellent mixing abilities which help maximize reaction rates. Beyond their superior nutritional qualities, whey proteins are also utilized for thickening, stabilization and emulsification of food formulations following pH adjustment and heat treatment to induce protein denaturation and aggregation. Creating cold-gelling and thickening functionalities in whey protein for use in food system where heating is undesirable remains a challenge. Also, replacing starch-based thickeners with a whey protein ingredient may be attractive to diet -conscious consumers. The aim of this work was to alter and quantify the functional properties of whey proteins by RSCFX proc essing to create novel dairy ingredients for food applications. <b>Texturized</b> whey <b>protein</b> concentrate (TWPC) at acidic condition (pH 3. 0) were made by RSCFX and the effect s of addition of starch, calcium (0. 3 and 0. 6 %, w/w), and extrusion temperature (50, 70 and 90 °C) on selected physicochemical properties of the modified protein were evaluated. TWPC exhibited 200 - to 300 -fold higher viscosities than non-texturized WPC at various concentrations (6 - 26 %, w/w TWPC) and formed cold-set gels at 20 % (w/w) upon reconstitution in water. Starch-containing samples (TWPC-S) were less soluble, consisted of larger protein aggregates (1. 527 [mu]m), but had 1. 2 - 1. 4 -fold higher apparent viscosity than TWPC alone because of synergistic interactions between the two biopolymers. TWPC without the starch and at lower calcium level (0. 3 %) ha d smaller protein aggregates (0. 996 [mu]m) with higher solubility. TWPC alone extruded at 50 °C (TWPC- 50) and 70 °C (TWPC- 70) formed soft-textured aggregates with high solubility in water (77 - 79 %) than that extruded at 90 °C (TWPC - 90) with a solubility of 24 %. Total free sulfhydryl contents and solubility studies in selected buffers indicated that non-covalent interactions were prevalent in stabilizing the TWPC aggregates. TWPC extruded at 90 °C showed an increase in aromatic hydrophobicity {{and a decrease in}} aliphatic hydrophobicity indicating changes in protein structures. Secondary gelation occurred in TWPC - 50 and TWPC- 70 when the cold-set gels were heated to 95 °C, while TWPC- 90 showed excellent thermal stability. Factors such as the degree of protein denaturation, exposure of hydrophobic groups, and cross -linking influenced the intermolecular associations and improved the cold-set and second-stage heat-induced gelation of TWPCs. Compared to non-texturized WPC, TWPC formed stable oil-in-water emulsions at lower protein concentrations. However, the presence of starch in TWPC impeded emulsifying properties. TWPCs were able to form cold-set emulsion gels containing 40 to 80 % (w/w) that were stabilized by 4 to 12 % (w/w) protein and had smaller mean droplet sizes as opposed to the non-texturized WPC. TWPC- 90 emulsions showed excellent stability during storage (30 days at 4 and 25 °C) and heating (70 - 90 °C for 20 min) due to the extensively denatured proteins. Heat treatment [GREATER-THAN OR EQUAL TO] 80 °C of non-texturized WPC and TWPC- 70 emulsions increased the droplet sizes and loss moduli (G'), indicating emulsion destabilization due to aggregation of native proteins. TWPC emulsions had higher adsorbed proteins (6. 0 - 23. 3 mg/mL) in contrast to the nontexturized WPC emulsions (2. 17 - 6. 33 mg/mL). SDS-PAGE of the adsorbed TWPC showed greater intensity of [alpha]-la ([alpha]-lactalbumin) and the presence of high molecular -weight protein aggregates. The adsorbed proteins of TWPC - 70 emulsions underwent time-dependent polymerization, but they remained stable in TWPC- 90 -based emulsions. The superiority of TWPC stabilized emulsions may be due to combinations of a stable protein gel matrix that formed the continuous phase of emulsion, greater surface hydrophobicity, and intra-film protein polymerization that conf erred strength to the protein interfacial layer. TWPC- 90 that contains a higher degree of denatured protein offers the best potential to serve as a novel, whey protein-based food emulsifier and stabilizer. The RSCFX process provides a new approach by which functional characteristics of TWPC ingredient may be advantageously designed by altering the formulation composition and extrusion operating parameters. These new ingredients may be utilized in different products requiring targeted physicochemical functionalities and a cleaner, all-dairy label. 2018 - 08 - 2...|$|R
