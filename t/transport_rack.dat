5000|$|The {{design of}} the Argus 400 started {{at the same time}} as the Argus 300. In logical terms the 400 was similar to the earlier 100, using serial ALUs. However, it {{featured}} an entirely new electrical system. Previous machines used germanium transistors to form the logic gates. The Argus 400 used silicon transistors in a NOR-logic designed by Ferranti Wythenshawe called MicroNOR II, with more [...] "conventional" [...] logic where 0 and +4.5 represented binary 1 and 0, respectively. The rest of the world however used 0 volts to represent 0 and + 2.4 (to 5) volts to represent 1. This was called NAND logic. They are in fact both the same circuitry. When Texas Instruments brought out their “74” series of integrated circuits the specification of MicroNOR II was changed from 4.5 volts to 5 volts so the two families could work together. The machine was packaged to fit into a standard Air <b>Transport</b> <b>Rack.</b> Multilayer PCBs were not routine in 1963 and Ferranti developed processes for bonding the boards and plating through the circuit boards. The drawing office had to learn how to design multilayer boards. which was first laid out on tape then transferred to film. It took around two years for the Argus 400 to go into production.|$|E
40|$|Over {{the years}} the global {{competition}} has increased among companies. Companies need to know their competitive priorities to survive. Decisions about facility layout will transform a company`s competitive priorities, processes, and capacity into an actual physical arrangements of people, equipment and space. Volvo trucks in Umeå deliver today the truck cab without the front lid but when the front lid and the truck cab are painted in two different places {{there may be a}} different tint. This tint difference is eliminated when the truck cab and the front lid are painted together. When Volvo trucks in Umeå started to paint those parts together they will assembly the front lid on the cab before deliver. When they start assembly the front lid in Umeå they need to create a new factory layout to have the same efficiency as before. Two different solutions have been evaluated and compared were the front lid can be placed into a <b>transport</b> <b>rack.</b> One of those places is the workstation called the Pi-station, which is the first workstation on assembly department, and the other is on the first workstation on the ninth segment. Those two alternatives have been compared with respect to how large area that is needed for the inventory of the front lid and how much resources that are required to transport the front lid racks. The lead time for transportation of the front lid has been calculated for two cycle times and two different cases. These cases are based on where the truck driver is in the facility when he/she gets the signal to deliver a front lid rack. One of the alternatives were the front lid can be placed into a transport racks are segment nine. To transport the front lid with the cab to segment nine they need to move the assembly of the back window from segment three to Pi-station. To know if there is a chance to transport the front lid on the back of cab two simulations was made. One simulation was made in Visual Basic and the other in Matlab. The result of those simulations was mean time, shortage from buffer, total time of shortage and time of shortage. Information has been gathered through visual studies on the assembly department and historic data has been gathered from Volvo trucks databases. The information that had to be collected through visual studies could not be found in the databases. This information was used in the Matlab simulation. The result of transporting the front lid {{on the back of the}} truck cab instead of using trucks are that the inventory area of front lids can be decreased by 20 square meters and the time for transporting the front lid form the Pi-station to the subassembly station can be decreased by 10 %. The risk will also decrease that the front lid will be assembled on the wrong track cab. Validerat; 20110824 (anonymous...|$|E
40|$|In {{the past}} six months, this project was focused on more {{fundamental}} studies of the coating properties. The properties of each individual coating TiB{sub 2 }, TiBC {{as well as the}} alternating TiB{sub 2 }/TiBC laminates were studied. These properties include residual stress, surface morphology and topography, adhesion and wear rate. The coatings were deposited using dc magnetron reactive sputtering process. Deposition of the films was carried out in a production-scale, three-chamber-in-line coating system, consisting of a load-lock chamber, and two deposition chambers. The substrates were cleaned and mounted on a rack before going into the chamber. A computerized conveyor system <b>transported</b> the <b>rack</b> into the load-lock chamber, where the pressure was pumped down to around 2 E- 5 torr. The substrates were then preheated by an infrared heater to about 100 C. After preheating, the substrates were transported into the first deposition chamber through a gate valve. The base pressure of the deposition chambers is 2 E- 6 torr. A layer of Ti was deposited on the substrates using two 5 inch x 20 inch Ti targets in the first deposition chamber as the adhesion layer. The substrates were then transported to the second deposition chamber for the TiB{sub 2 } and Ti-B-C-N depositions. In the second deposition chamber, two 5 inch x 20 inch TiB{sub 2 } targets were mounted on both sides. For the TiB{sub 2 } deposition, argon was introduced into the chamber. For the Ti-B-C-N deposition, acetylene and nitrogen were introduced into the chamber through four gas distribution manifolds to insure the uniformity. The partial pressure of the reactive gases were controlled by a PID control loop. Substrate bias {{is one of the key}} deposition parameters. Bias voltages ranged from 40 to 300 V. Current density is around 2 mA/cm{sup 2 }. The deposition rate is about 1. 5 {micro}m/hr. All the test coatings, used for thickness and hardness measurement, as well as, microstructural studies, were deposited on polished 001 silicon wafers. All the coatings used for wear tests, were deposited on polished 1 inch stainless steel 316 disks...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} aimed at finding the most cost {{effective}} way of executing Modular Execution Strategy (MES) for building pipe racks of a project that an engineering company Fluor B. V. is currently executing in Kuwait. A pipe rack is a steel structure which is constructed to efficiently place and support multiple levels of pipelines for industrial plants such as refinery plants, chemical plants or power plants. The Modular Execution Strategy aims at relocating parts of fabrication and assembly activities of a pipe rack construction to potentially low cost locations at which the conditions for fabrication and assembly activities are more favorable. The pre-assembled pipe <b>racks</b> will be <b>transported</b> to the onshore installation site by a vessel, which results in sea-transport design requirements (due to vessel motions) {{in addition to the}} in-place design. Three options of different configuration for MES were considered. The first option is to transport only upper parts of the pipe racks without their bottom columns and assemble the bottom columns at the installation site. The second option is to transport the complete pipe racks including bottom columns which are stiffened by temporary bracings. The last option is to <b>transport</b> complete pipe <b>racks</b> with strengthened columns having a larger profile dimensions. In order to consider various sizes of pipe racks, 27 -representative configurations of pipe racks of the project were selected. These pipe racks were designed to withstand in-place loadings and sea-transport loadings with a quasi-static analysis method. The in-place loadings are weight of pipe lines and wind force. The sea-transport loadings are forces due to motions of a vessel and critical sea-transport loadings come from roll + heave and pitch + heave. Quantities of steel for each option were found after completion of the design. Subsequently, the quantities were translated into steel work cost which includes procurement, fabrication, assembly and installation costs of steel work. As a conclusion, it was found that considering the quantities and costs of steel work for the project, option 1 (<b>transport</b> the pipe <b>racks</b> without columns) is the most cost effective solution. If pinned supports are used at the vessel deck, which are more favorable for the company, it was calculated that option 1 requires, on average, 15 % and 30 % less cost than option 2 and option 3 respectively. For clamped supported conditions, option 1 still requires 15 % less cost than both option 2 and option 3. Furthermore, it was demonstrated by performing a resonance check and a dynamic analysis for a tall two-dimensional frame, that a quasi-static analysis method could be used to assess the sea-transport loadings. It was found that there is very low possibility of resonance and only low dynamic amplification. In this thesis, the focus has been on differences in the structural configurations. Other aspects, some of which may be difficult to express in cost terms such as logistical difficulty, safety/risk, and project schedule, were not taken into account. Therefore, in order to verify the attractiveness of each option in more detail, it is suggested to also make a complete assessment of those mentioned aspects. <br/...|$|R
