5|$|Founded in 1796, the Rumford Prize, {{awarded by}} the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, {{is one of}} the oldest {{scientific}} prizes in the United States. The prize recognizes contributions by scientists <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fields</b> of heat and light. These terms are widely interpreted; awards range from discoveries in thermodynamics to improvements in the construction of steam boilers.|$|E
5|$|Although Shankar {{initially}} {{claimed that}} Enthiran {{would be made}} for all audiences, including those lacking computer literacy, the film is influenced by and makes references to many scientific principles relating <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fields</b> of engineering, computer science and robotics, including terabytes and Asimov's laws of robotics. Visual references are made to the science books A Briefer History of Time (2005) and Freakonomics (2005). In his book Visual Perception and Cultural Memory: Typecast and Typecast(e)ing in Malayalam Cinema, Sujith Kumar Parayil notes the similarities between Kalabhavan Mani's role in the film to the one Mani played in the Malayalam film Sallapam (1996).|$|E
5|$|As {{the city}} of Toronto {{expanded}} eastward and encroached on the estate, Elizabeth and Wellington Ashbridge subdivided and sold off much of the family's land for residential subdivisions. The Duke of Connaught Public School (1912) and S.H. Armstrong Community Recreation Centre were built on land {{that had been the}} Ashbridges' orchard. Woodfield Road, {{on the east side of}} the current property, was originally the farm lane going <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fields</b> farther north.|$|E
50|$|In an unmagnetized plasma, an {{electromagnetic}} {{electron wave}} {{is simply a}} light wave modified by the plasma. In a magnetized plasma, there are two modes perpendicular <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>field,</b> <b>the</b> O and X modes, and two modes parallel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>field,</b> <b>the</b> R and L waves.|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} of phase space density observations of 30 - 130 keV ring current protons made during a magnetopause crossing of ISEE 1 {{indicates that the}} phase space densities of 30 - 65 keV protons within the magnetosphere are higher for particles streaming parallel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> than antiparallel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>field.</b> In <b>the</b> magnetosheath, phase space densities parallel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> are higher than the densities of both outward- and inward-flowing particles parallel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> within <b>the</b> magnetosphere.

5|$|Khubeza, a {{local variety}} of the mallow plant, became an {{important}} food source during the War of Independence. During the siege of Jerusalem, when convoys of food could not reach the city, Jerusalemites went out <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fields</b> to pick khubeza leaves, which are high in iron and vitamins. The Jerusalem radio station, Kol Hamagen, broadcast instructions for cooking it that were picked up in Jordan convinced the Arabs that the Jews were dying of starvation and victory was at hand. In the past decade, food writers in Israel have encouraged the population to prepare khubeza on Israel Independence Day. Local chefs have begun to serve khubeza and other wild plants gathered from the fields in upscale restaurants.|$|E
5|$|Pliny the Elder and {{his party}} saw flames coming from several parts of the crater. After staying overnight, the party was driven from the {{building}} by an accumulation of material, presumably tephra, which threatened to block all egress. They woke Pliny, who had been napping and emitting loud snoring. They elected to take <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fields</b> with pillows tied to their heads {{to protect them from}} the raining debris. They approached the beach again but the wind prevented the ships from leaving. Pliny sat down on a sail that had been spread for him and could not rise even with assistance when his friends departed. Though Pliny the Elder died, his friends ultimately escaped by land.|$|E
5000|$|The Fellows Program [...] "recognizes {{individuals}} who have attained eminence in oceanography through their outstanding contributions <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> of oceanography or its applications during a substantial period of years". Individuals in the Society can be elected as a TOS Fellow with outstanding contributions <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> of oceanography as well as devotion <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>field.</b> An individual is usually considered for nomination after {{he or she has}} been a member of the society for at least three years.|$|R

5|$|To thank Caymmi for {{bringing}} international attention to Brazilian music and culture, in 1968, {{the governor of}} Bahia presented Caymmi with a house in Salvador, and so he returned to live in his hometown {{for a short period}} of time. In 1972, Caymmi was awarded the Order of Merit of the State of Bahia, an order given to Bahian residents for excellent service to the state. In Caymmi's case, the service was bringing pride and honor to Bahian people through the widespread dissemination of his music about life there. On Caymmi's 70th birthday, in 1984, French Minister of Culture Jack Lang presented him with the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, a French order that recognizes significant contributors <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fields</b> of art and literature, in Paris. The following year, a new street named Avenida Dorival Caymmi (Dorival Caymmi Avenue) opened in Salvador. In 1986, Rio de Janeiro's famed Mangueira samba school based its Carnaval performance on Caymmi's life and work, and the school won the annual parade-style samba competition. In 2015, his tribute album Centenário Caymmi was nominated for the 16th Latin Grammy Awards in the Best MPB Album category.|$|E
5|$|Villages {{were usually}} {{concentrated}} around irrigation reservoirs to enable {{easy access to}} water for agriculture. Houses stood immediately below the reservoir embankment, between {{the water and the}} paddy fields below. This facilitated easy control of the water supply <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fields</b> and also supported maintenance of domestic gardens for fruit and vegetable production. A village typically consisted of a cluster of dwellings, paddy fields, a reservoir, a grazing ground, shift crop reserves and a village forest. In areas of high rainfall, a perennial watercourse often took the place of the reservoir. Inland fishing was widespread during the Anuradhapura Kingdom period because of the numerous reservoirs. Although not entirely absent, sea fishing was not common during this period mainly because of the rudimentary nature of transporting sea fish to cities which were located far inland.|$|E

Thus, this chapter is also linked <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> of organizational economics. Chapters 3 and 4 analyze the effects of consumer biases on market outcomes and assess the effectiveness of specific consumer protection policies.

5|$|En {{route to}} the Sea of Monsters (Bermuda triangle), the Birmingham is {{destroyed}} by Charybdis and Scylla. Thinking Tyson and Clarisse dead, Percy and Annabeth sail in a lifeboat to a nearby island, where they narrowly escape the sorceress Circe, who turns men into guinea pigs. They steal the Queen Anne's Revenge from Circe's harbor and sail towards the island of Polyphemus. Along the way, they pass the island of the Sirens and Annabeth confesses her fatal flaw, hubris, to Percy. When they reach the island, they find Grover, Clarisse, Tyson, and the fleece. Tyson and Percy work together to defeat Polyphemus and return the group to the mainland. Once there, Clarisse takes a plane to Camp Half-Blood with the Fleece. The remaining questers are captured by Luke and taken to the Princess Andromeda. Percy manages to contact Camp Half-Blood through an Iris Message and tricks Luke into admitting that he poisoned Thalia's tree, proving Chiron's innocence {{in front of the}} entire camp. Mr. D then sends Tantalus back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fields</b> of Punishment. Luke duels Percy, beats him, and is about to kill the group, but before he does, Chiron and the his centaur relatives appear and rescue them. Returning to the camp, Chiron is given his job back and the Golden Fleece heals Thalia's tree. However, in the final pages, the Golden Fleece also revives Thalia Grace, putting another half-blood back into play for the Great Prophecy the gods fear so much.|$|E
