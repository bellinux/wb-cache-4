50|$|N-Terminal domain AR {{antagonist}}s {{are a new}} <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>AR</b> antagonist which, unlike all currently marketed AR antagonists, bind to the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the AR {{rather than}} the ligand-binding domain (LBD). Whereas conventional AR antagonists bind to the LBD of the AR and competitively displace androgens, thereby preventing them from activating the receptor, AR NTD antagonists bind covalently to the NTD of the AR and prevent protein-protein interactions subsequent to activation that are required for transcriptional activity. As such, they are non-competitive and irreversible antagonists of the AR. Examples of AR NTD antagonists include bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (BADGE) and its derivatives EPI-001 and EPI-506. These drugs are currently under development {{for the treatment of}} prostate cancer, and it is thought that they may have greater efficacy as antiandrogens relative to conventional AR antagonists. In accordance with this notion, AR NTD antagonists are active against splice variants of the AR, which conventional AR antagonists are not, and AR NTD antagonists are immune to gain-of-function mutations in the AR LBD that convert AR antagonists into AR agonists and which commonly occur in prostate cancer.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Augmented Reality (AR) {{was first}} {{demonstrated}} in the 1960 ’s, yet is it still not widely used. However a number of technologies have recently emerged {{that can be used}} to easily deploy large numbers of Augmented Reality applications to many users. Camera equipped cell phones with significant processing power and graphics abilities provide an inexpensive, versatile platform for AR applications, while the social networking technology of Web 2. 0 provides a large-scale infrastructure for collaboratively producing and distributing geo-referenced content. This combination of widely used mobile hardware and Web 2. 0 software allows the development of a new <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>AR</b> platform that can be used on a global scale. In this paper we describe the Augmented Reality 2. 0 concept and present existing work on mobile AR and web technology that could be used to create AR 2. 0 applications. 1...|$|E
40|$|Most {{existing}} Augmented Reality (AR) applications {{use either}} template (picture) markers or bar-code markers to overlay computergenerated graphics {{on the real}} world surfaces. e use of template markers is computationally expensive and unreliable. On the other hand, bar-code markers display only black and white blocks; thus, they look uninteresting and uninformative. In this short paper, we describe {{a new way to}} optically hide a QR code inside a tile based colour picture. Each AR marker is built from hundreds of small tiles (just like tiling a bathroom), and the unique gaps between the tiles are used to determine the elements of the hidden QR Code. is novel <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>AR</b> marker presents not only a realistic-looking colour picture but also contains self-Correcting information (stored in QR code). In this article, we demonstrate that this tile based colour picture with hidden QR code is relatively robust under various conditions and scaling. We believe many nowadays’ AR challenges could be solved with this type of marker. AR-enabled medias could then be easily generated. For instance, it would be capable of storing and displaying virtual gures of an entire book or magazine. us, it provides a promising AR approach to be used in many di erent AR applications; and beyond, it may even replace the barcodes and QR Codes in some cases...|$|E

30|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown {{inconsistent}} effects on LV performance. In one study, long–term treatment with metoprolol did not change pressure development or LVEF after 6 and 12  months (Plante et al. 2008), while another study showed dp/dtmin to be significantly increased by disease and dp/dtmax to be unaffected, while high–dose carvedilol did not change this. In the same study LVEF measured by echocardiography decreased marginally in rats with AR (LVEF 77 [*]±[*] 0.8 % in sham vs. 66 [*]±[*] 0.5 % in AR) and carvedilol slightly reversed this mild decrease (71 [*]±[*] 1.4 % in treated vs. 66 [*]±[*] 0.5 % in untreated rats). In another study invasive hemodynamic measurements were not performed but echocardiography showed improved systolic and diastolic function in rats treated early with metoprolol for twenty–four weeks. However, in this study LV systolic function was also only marginally affected by treatment. We did not find carvedilol to improve LV systolic function. In the studies showing positive effects systolic function, LVEF was {{within the limits of}} reference and did not decrease significantly during the course of disease. This may reflect a more benign <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>AR</b> where six months of severe volume overload does not impair systolic function. Our model somehow resulted in a reduction in LV function measured by FS and speckle tracking echocardiography and may represent a more progressive type of disease less susceptible to the positive effects of beta–blockade.|$|E
40|$|Vertebrates show diverse sexual {{characters}} in sexually attractive and reproductive organs, which are regulated by steroid hormones, particularly androgens. However, the evolutionary history of androgen receptor (AR) gene remains largely unknown {{on the basis}} of phylogenic and functional analyses. To elucidate the evolutionary history and functional diversification of AR genes in vertebrates, we cloned the AR cDNAs from a shark, basal ray-finned fishes (Actinopterygii), namely bichir and sturgeon (Acipenseriformes), and teleosts including a basal teleost, arowana (Osteoglossiformes). Molecular phylogenetic analysis revealed that the gene duplication event that gave rise to two different teleost ARs (α and β) likely occurred in the actinopterygian lineage leading to teleosts after the divergence of Acipenseriformes but before the split of Osteoglossiformes, which is compatible with the phylogenetic timing of teleost-specific genome duplication. Searching for AR genes in the medaka genome indicated that the teleost AR gene duplication has been associated with the duplication between chromosomes 10 and 14. Our functional analysis revealed that the shark AR activates the target gene via androgen response element by classical androgens. The teleost ARα showed the unique intracellular localization with a significantly higher transactivating capacity than that by teleost ARβ. These findings indicate that the most ancient <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>AR,</b> as activated by the classical androgens as ligands, emerged before the Chondrichthyes-Osteichthyes split, and the AR gene was duplicated during the teleost-specific genome duplication event.

Quantitative measurements of this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>AR</b> reservoir in microbial communities are required to understand AR ecology (e. g., emergence, persistence, and dissemination). We report here the development, validation, and use of six real-time PCR assays for quantifying six classes of erm genes (classes A through C, F, T, and X) that encode the major mechanism of resistance to macrolides-lincosamides-streptogramin B (MLSB). These real-time PCR assays were validated and used in quantifying the six erm classes in five types of samples, including those from bovine manure, swine manure, compost of swine manure, swine waste lagoons, and an Ekokan upflow biofilter system treating hog house effluents. The bovine manure samples were found to contain much smaller reservoirs of each of the six erm classes than the swine manure samples. Compared to the swine manure samples, the composted swine manure samples had substantially reduced erm gene abundances (by up to 7. 3 logs), whereas the lagoon or the biofilter samples had similar erm gene abundances. These preliminary results suggest that the methods of manure storage and treatment probably have a substantial impact on the persistence and decline of MLSB resistance originating from food animals, thus likely affecting the dissemination of such resistance genes into the environment. The abundances of these erm genes appeared to be positively correlated with those of the tet genes determined previously among these samples. These real-time PCR assays provide a rapid, quantitative, and cultivation-independent measurement of six major classes of erm genes, which should be useful for ecological studies of AR...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: C 4 d {{deposition}} in peritubular capillaries (PTCs) {{is a sign}} of humoral renal allograft rejection and an independent predictor of graft survival. Few investigators have focused on the meaning of capillary C 3 {{deposition in}} rejecting grafts. Because C 3 production can result from both classic and alternative pathway activation of the complement cascade, {{it is not clear whether}} C 3 deposition indicates a distinct entity of acute rejection (AR) or merely represents a separate form of C 4 d-positive AR. METHODS: We examined the deposition of C 3 d in the PTCs of recipients with AR in the first year posttransplantation (n= 30). Clinical outcome variables and histology were compared with C 3 d-negative control patients (n= 82). RESULTS: C 3 d-positive patients demonstrated more frequent preexisting T-cell antibodies (57 %) and more re-transplants (37 %), and they received more blood transfusions (mean 10. 3 units). C 3 d-positive patients experienced more frequent multiple AR episodes (57 %) and delayed graft function (36. 7 %). All nine C 3 d-positive recipients screened for posttransplantation donor-specific human leukocyte antigen antibodies demonstrated positive results. Graft failure occurred in 23 % of C 3 d-positive recipients (7. 3 % in the control group) (P= 0. 03). C 3 d-positive biopsies showed significantly less tubulitis (P= 0. 03), whereas congestive PTCs with intraluminal accumulation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes were conspicuous. Thrombi, fibrinoid necrosis, and acute tubular necrosis were not more pronounced. In 19 % of rejection biopsies, C 3 d deposition in PTCs was present without C 4 d deposition. In the remaining biopsies, C 3 d and C 4 d deposition was found simultaneously.

40|$|Artificial reefs {{have become}} {{increasingly}} popular as a method to help prevent degradation of coral reef systems. Artificial reef design and technology has evolved greatly {{since the beginning of}} artificial reef use as a simple fishery tool. Modern artificial reefs employ various techniques and models in order to accomplish a variety of tasks including: protecting, rehabilitating, or preventing further damage to reef systems. However, in order to assess the success of these different techniques, artificial reef applications need to be examined from both a historical and modern perspective. In order to examine how artificial reef systems as a whole have been used in the past and how to improve techniques in use today, a thorough investigation into the history of artificial reef use as well as current applications and methods was conducted. Additionally, a survey of practices in artificial reef use in theCaribbean Seawas designed and implemented. The survey incorporated a broad range of agencies (i. e. governmental, educational, volunteer, etc.) and consisted of four main parts: <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>AR</b> deployed, site selection criteria, original objective or purpose, and availability of funding. The questionnaire was sent to 250 academic researchers, government coordinators, non-government organizations, and volunteer organizations. Of the surveys sent, 18 responses were received from project organizers and 21 responses were gathered from databases received from the Florida Artificial Reef Program. Results indicate most ARs are made of concrete (including Reef Balls™ and construction debris), are deployed in 3 ̆c 10 m of water or at depths of 20 - 30 m and are either of moderate size (1 - 2 m in width and length) or of large sizes (3 ̆c 3 m).

40|$|Adenosine receptors (AR) are {{a family}} of G-protein coupled receptors, {{comprised}} of four members, named A 1, A 2 A, A 2 B, and A 3 receptors, found widely distributed in almost all human body tissues and organs. To date, they are known {{to participate in a}} large variety of physiopathological responses, which include vasodilation, pain, and inflammation. In particular, in the central nervous system (CNS), adenosine acts as a neuromodulator, exerting different functions depending on the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>AR</b> and consequent cellular signaling involved. In terms of molecular pathways and second messengers involved, A 1 and A 3 receptors inhibit adenylyl cyclase (AC), through Gi/o proteins, while A 2 A and A 2 B receptors stimulate it through Gs proteins. In the CNS, A 1 receptors are widely distributed in the cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum, A 2 A receptors are localized mainly in the striatum and olfactory bulb, while A 2 B and A 3 receptors are found at low levels of expression. In addition, AR are able to form heteromers, both among themselves (e. g., A 1 /A 2 A), as well as with other subtypes (e. g., A 2 A/D 2), opening a whole range of possibilities in the field of the pharmacology of AR. Nowadays, we know that adenosine, by acting on adenosine A 1 and A 2 A receptors, is known to antagonistically modulate dopaminergic neurotransmission and therefore reward systems, being A 1 receptors colocalized in heteromeric complexes with D 1 receptors, and A 2 A receptors with D 2 receptors. This review documents the present state of knowledge of the contribution of AR, particularly A 1 and A 2 A, to psychostimulants-mediated effects, including locomotor activity, discrimination, seeking and reward, and discuss their therapeutic relevance to psychostimulant addiction. Studies presented in this review reinforce the potential of A 1 agonists as an effective strategy to counteract psychostimulant-induced effects. Furthermore, different experimental data support the hypothesis that A 2 A/D 2 heterodimers are partly responsible for the psychomotor and reinforcing effects of psychostimulant drugs, such as cocaine and amphetamine, and the stimulation of A 2 A receptor is proposed as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of drug addiction. The overall analysis of presented data provide evidence that excitatory modulation of A 1 and A 2 A receptors constitute promising tools to counteract psychostimulants addiction...|$|E

30|$|Miniaturization {{and power}} {{consumption}} {{are the first}} constraints for the design self-content mobile AR systems. Object positioning and drawing require computation resources, but control capacities are also necessary to handle data acquisition from sensors and communication protocols. The implementation of the first prototypes for such applications was based on backpacked laptops with 3 D graphics cards [9, 10]. Advanced mobile multiprocessor architectures are now available (e.g. OMAP 5, Snapdragon, Atom N 2800, ST-Ericsson Nova, Apple A 5,...), and they are typically based on cortex ARM cores or Intel Atoms with specialized graphics and video coprocessors. The main advantage of such architectures is the availability of software development frameworks. This kind of platforms is typically embedded in recent AR systems that also integrate IMU sensors: OMAP 3530 for Optinvent and OMAP 4430 for Vuzix and Google. However, they are mainly used to handle the video stream and the wired or wireless communication with a smartphone that remotely runs the AR application. As a matter of fact, high-resolution video games and video and image processing for object identification and complex online 3 D graphics computations would justify such processing resources. However, the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>AR</b> applications we are targeting requires simple objects instead. Secondly, {{they do not need}} cameras and complex pose computation that requires image processing. So we believe and we demonstrate that such general-purpose processor (GPP)+GPU solutions are actually oversized regarding power autonomy constraints. We present in Section 2 an implementation of such a solution based on the Nova system-on-chip (SoC). Another possible solution is provided by reconfigurable architectures that enable specifically optimized and low-frequency designs. These rely on hardware/software design methodologies and recent high-performance FPGAs. These FPGAs are often power-hungry; however, the roadmap of FPGAs is clearly focused on this power issue with the aim to address the embedded system market. Recent hybrid ARM/FPGA architectures such a Xilinx/Zynq open new perspectives. On-chip memory capacity is also a key issue where significant progress has been made. For example, the Artix Xilinx low-power, low-cost family embeds up to 12 Mbits of block RAM. Regarding GPUs on FPGAs, Xylon has added a 3 D graphics module to the Logibrick library available under license in an early access version for evaluation. The architecture relies on a three-stage pipeline. This solution is a simplified version of the usual graphics pipeline and is designed for general purpose OpenGL embedded system (ES) applications. It shows that low-frequency dedicated architectures can be designed for this purpose. In [11], the authors present a GPU-inspired and multi-threaded softcore architecture, which is programmable with the NVIDIA Cg language. The aim is to simplify the use of FPGA-based acceleration boards for high-performance computing. Our approach is different, it is dedicated and designed for embedded systems and AR applications with a high focus on data locality optimization for minimizing data transfers.|$|E
40|$|Attention-awareness {{is a key}} {{topic for}} the {{upcoming}} generation of computer-human interaction. A human moves his or her eyes to visually attends to a particular region in a scene. Consequently, {{he or she can}} process visual information rapidly and efficiently without being overwhelmed by vast amount of information from the environment. Such a physiological function called visual attention provides a computer system with valuable information of the user to infer his or her activity and the surrounding environment. For example, a computer can infer whether the user is reading text or not by analyzing his or her eye movements. Furthermore, it can infer with which object he or she is interacting by recognizing the object the user is looking at. Recent developments of mobile eye tracking technologies enable us to capture human visual attention in ubiquitous everyday environments. There are various types of applications where attention-aware systems may be effectively incorporated. Typical examples are augmented reality (AR) applications such as Wikitude which overlay virtual information onto physical objects. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>AR</b> application presents augmentative information of recognized objects to the user. However, if it presents information of all recognized objects at once, the over ow of information could be obtrusive to the user. As a solution for such a problem, attention-awareness can be integrated into a system. If a system knows to which object the user is attending, it can present only the information of relevant objects to the user. Towards attention-aware systems in everyday environments, this thesis presents approaches for analysis of user attention to visual content. Using a state-of-the-art wearable eye tracking device, one can measure the user's eye movements in a mobile scenario. By capturing the user's eye gaze position in a scene and analyzing the image where the eyes focus, a computer can recognize the visual content the user is currently attending to. I propose several image analysis methods to recognize the user-attended visual content in a scene image. For example, I present an application called Museum Guide 2. 0. In Museum Guide 2. 0, image-based object recognition and eye gaze analysis are combined together to recognize user-attended objects in a museum scenario. Similarly, optical character recognition (OCR), face recognition, and document image retrieval are also combined with eye gaze analysis to identify the user-attended visual content in respective scenarios. In addition to Museum Guide 2. 0, I present other applications in which these combined frameworks are effectively used. The proposed applications show that the user can benefit from active information presentation which augments the attended content in a virtual environment with a see-through head-mounted display (HMD). In addition to the individual attention-aware applications mentioned above, this thesis presents a comprehensive framework that combines all recognition modules to recognize the user-attended visual content when various types of visual information resources such as text, objects, and human faces are present in one scene. In particular, two processing strategies are proposed. The first one selects an appropriate image analysis module according to the user's current cognitive state. The second one runs all image analysis modules simultaneously and merges the analytic results later. I compare these two processing strategies in terms of user-attended visual content recognition when multiple visual information resources are present in the same scene. Furthermore, I present novel interaction methodologies for a see-through HMD using eye gaze input. A see-through HMD is a suitable device for a wearable attention-aware system for everyday environments because the user can also view his or her physical environment through the display. I propose methods for the user's attention engagement estimation with the display, eye gaze-driven proactive user assistance functions, and a method for interacting with a multi-focal see-through display. Contributions of this thesis include: • An overview of the state-of-the-art in attention-aware computer-human interaction and attention-integrated image analysis. • Methods for the analysis of user-attended visual content in various scenarios. • Demonstration of the feasibilities and the benefits of the proposed user-attended visual content analysis methods with practical user-supportive applications. • Methods for interaction with a see-through HMD using eye gaze. • A comprehensive framework for recognition of user-attended visual content in a complex scene where multiple visual information resources are present. This thesis opens a novel field of wearable computer systems where computers can understand the user attention in everyday environments and provide with what the user wants. I will show the potential of such wearable attention-aware systems for everyday environments {{for the next generation of}} pervasive computer-human interaction...|$|E

Loading <b>of</b> the agonist-occupied <b>AR</b> onto chromatin regulatory sites and expression <b>of</b> several <b>AR</b> target genes, including their basal expression, were stronger in VCaP cells than LNCaP cells. Bicalutamide displayed a trend towards agonism in VCaP cells. Bicalutamide also evoked AR-chromatin interaction, whereas diarylthiohydantoin antiandrogen RD 162 was inert with this respect both in VCaP and LNCaP cells. These results support the notion that the AR protein level translates into augmented occupancy of AR-regulated enhancers and target gene activity in prostate cancer cells...|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{research}} was to examine how effectively augmented reality (AR) displays, generated with a wearable computer, could be used for aiding an operator performing a manufacturing assembly task. The research concentrated on comparing two technologies for generating augmented reality displays (opaque vs. see-through), with two current <b>types</b> <b>of</b> assembly instructions (a traditional assembly instruction manual vs. computer aided instruction). The study was used {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the wearable based augmented reality compared to traditional instruction methods, and was also used to compare two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>AR</b> displays in the context of an assembly task. For the experiment, 15 subjects were asked to assemble a computer motherboard using the four <b>types</b> <b>of</b> instruction: paper manual, computer aided, an opaque AR display, and a see-through AR display. The study was run as a within subjects design, where subjects were randomly assigned the order of instruction media. For the AR conditions, the augmented environments were generated with a wearable computer, and viewed through two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> monocular, head-mounted displays (HMD). The first <b>type</b> <b>of</b> HMD was a monocular opaqu...|$|R

40|$|Action {{research}} (AR) {{has gained}} more acceptance as {{an approach to}} qualitative research in information systems (IS). The complexities of organisational and technical change makes this approach a suitable one in IS research. There are, however, still some controversies and confusions about the relation between “action” and “research”. The many <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>AR</b> and similar approaches (not labelled as AR) that have emerged demands further conceptual clarification <b>of</b> <b>AR.</b> A conceptual inquiry <b>of</b> <b>AR,</b> presented in the paper, {{has led to the}} identification of several unresolved issues concerning intervention research like AR. An alternative research approach is presented: practice research. This research approach is well founded in pragmatism and it builds on the two premises: 1) to contribute to general practice through abstract and useful knowledge and 2) to study the empirical field as interconnected practices. Several important concepts of practice research are described as: local practice contribution vs. general practice contribution; theorizing vs. situational inquiry. Practice research is seen as a broader notion encompassing AR and other research approaches as e. g. design research and evaluation research. Two case examples of practice research are briefly presented and compared: one AR-based study in the social welfare sector and one evaluation study of a taxation e-service...|$|R
50|$|In February 2016, Meron Gribetz {{introduced}} the Meta 2 at TED (conference). The Meta 2 consisted of an augmented reality headset {{that makes it}} possible for users to see, grab and interact with move holograms in a natural fashion. The headset has an onboard color camera (720p) and four speakers for near-ear audio. It supports Windows-based applications (Mac applications expected later in 2016). Meta 2 is fully hand-controlled, with <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>AR</b> applications that include 3D modeling, web browsing, and remote collaboration (e.g., colleagues in different locations can view and manipulate holograms with their hands). At TED, Gribetz suggested this new technology was designed to allow users to interact with virtual objects yet maintain their sense of presence and interaction with their natural surroundings rather than being focused or distracted by traditional 2D computer screens. Meta currently produces augmented reality technology that enables users to interact with virtual objects rendered by a head-mounted display.|$|R
