5|$|Wilfrid {{was born}} in Northumbria in about 633. James Fraser argues that Wilfrid's family were aristocrats from Deira, {{pointing}} out that most of Wilfrid's early contacts were from that area. A conflict with his stepmother {{when he was about}} 14 years old drove Wilfrid <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>home,</b> probably without his father's consent. Wilfrid's background is never explicitly described as noble, but the king's retainers were frequent guests at his father's house, and on leaving home Wilfrid equipped his party with horses and clothes fit for a royal court.|$|E
5|$|As a child, Tarrare {{had a huge}} {{appetite}} and by his teens could eat {{a quarter of a}} bullock, weighing as much as Tarrare himself, in a single day. By this time, his parents could not provide for him and had forced him <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>home.</b> For some years after this, he toured the country with a roaming band of thieves and prostitutes, begging and stealing for food, before gaining employment as a warm-up act to a travelling charlatan. Tarrare would draw a crowd by eating corks, stones and live animals, and by swallowing an entire basketful of apples one after the other. He would eat ravenously and was particularly fond of snake meat.|$|E

5|$|His {{basketball}} {{performance in}} high school was unimpressive. He came off the bench to average four points per game (ppg). His stepmother informed him that when he graduated high school he would be {{thrown out of the}} house. Chris had been able <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>home</b> on a football scholarship and would later play in the National Football League, but Washington himself had nowhere to go. He trained for three hours a day {{toward the end of his}} senior season, and showed up uninvited at a playground game featuring top high school players from Washington and Pennsylvania, where he talked his way into the game. Tom Young, who had recently left his job as an assistant coach at Maryland University to become head coach at American University, saw him play there, and although Washington did not perform particularly well, Young was impressed by his hustle and how he ignored the poor treatment he received from the people who organized the game.|$|E
5|$|When {{eight years}} old, Modi {{discovered}} the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), and began attending its local shakhas (training sessions). There, Modi met Lakshmanrao Inamdar, {{popularly known as}} Vakil Saheb, who inducted him as a balswayamsevak (junior cadet) for RSS and became his political mentor. While Modi was training with the RSS, he also met Vasant Gajendragadkar and Nathalal Jaghda, Bharatiya Jana Sangh leaders who were founding members of the BJP's Gujarat unit in 1980. Engaged while still a child to Jashodaben, a girl from a family who lived close by, Modi rejected the arranged marriage {{at the same time}} he graduated from high school. The resulting familial tensions contributed to his decision <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>home</b> in 1967.|$|E

25|$|Fraternal {{polyandry}} {{achieves a}} similar goal {{to that of}} primogeniture in 19th-century England. Primogeniture dictated that the eldest son inherited the family estate, while younger sons had <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>home</b> and seek their own employment. Primogeniture maintained family estates intact over generations by permitting only one heir per generation. Fraternal polyandry also accomplishes this, but does so by keeping all the brothers together with just one wife {{so that there is}} only one set of heirs per generation. This strategy appears less successful the larger the fraternal sibling group.|$|E

25|$|Loose {{medicines}} {{may not be}} carried; most {{authorities have}} agreed that it is preferable that one who constantly needs medication remain at home rather than transgressing Shabbat by carrying medication.

25|$|The war was {{frustrating}} for both sides. Both sides tried {{to invade the}} other and were repulsed. The American high command remained incompetent until the last year. The American militia proved ineffective because the soldiers were reluctant <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>home</b> and efforts to invade Canada repeatedly failed. The British blockade ruined American commerce, bankrupted the Treasury, and further angered New Englanders, who smuggled supplies to Britain. The Americans under General William Henry Harrison finally gained naval control of Lake Erie and defeated the Indians under Tecumseh in Canada, while Andrew Jackson ended the Indian threat in the Southeast. The Indian threat to expansion into the Midwest was permanently ended. The British invaded and occupied much of Maine.|$|E
