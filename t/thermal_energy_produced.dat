50|$|Fires occur naturally, ignited by {{lightning}} strikes or by volcanic products. Combustion (fire) {{was the first}} controlled chemical reaction discovered by humans, {{in the form of}} campfires and bonfires, and continues to be the main method to produce energy for humanity. Usually, the fuel is carbon, hydrocarbons or more complicated mixtures such as wood that contains partially oxidized hydrocarbons. The <b>thermal</b> <b>energy</b> <b>produced</b> from combustion of either fossil fuels such as coal or oil, or from renewable fuels such as firewood, is harvested for diverse uses such as cooking, production of electricity or industrial or domestic heating. Combustion is also currently the only reaction used to power rockets. Combustion is also used to destroy (incinerate) waste, both nonhazardous and hazardous.|$|E

50|$|As {{with the}} primary school, the big {{overhanging}} tin roof protects the clay walls from sun and rain. The air between ceiling and roof becomes very hot, causing it to rise, and draw cooler air from beneath. In this way, the combination of solar and <b>thermal</b> <b>energy</b> <b>produce</b> air circulation and a cooling effect for the classrooms. The first primary school used a flat roof which was effective, but required {{a large amount of}} steel cladding, making it expensive. Therefore, the primary school extension uses a rounded vault roof, which needs fewer steel supports.|$|R
50|$|A new hi-tech {{environmentally}} friendly mountain hut {{was designed by}} architect Andrea Deplazes of ETH Zurich and inaugurated in September 2009. The project of the Swiss Alpine Club, to mark the 150th anniversary of ETH Zurich, was launched in 2003. The construction materials prefabricated elements were transported by train to Zermatt and 3,000 helicopter trips were needed to take 35 workers and materials up to the glacier. The five-story polygonal building was built on stainless steel foundations with a spiral interior made out of wood, the exterior being covered with an aluminum shell. The building is designed to obtain 90 percent of its power needs from the sun. Excess energy is stored in valve-regulated lead-acid accumulators (English: batteries), which supply power when it is overcast. Water is collected from melting glaciers and stored in a large reservoir 40 meters above the hut. Bands of windows allow the sun to heat air inside the spiral building with the redistribution of <b>thermal</b> <b>energy</b> <b>produced</b> by visitors.|$|E

The proposed system is composed of a buck converter with embedded microcontroller, which is used both to compute the MPPT algorithm and to control the charging of a lead-acid battery.

40|$|Quantum nonclassicality is {{the basic}} {{building}} stone {{for the vast majority}} of quantum information applications and methods of its generation are at the forefront of research. One of the obstacles any method needs to clear is the looming presence of decohorence and noise which act against the nonclassicality and often erase it completely. In this paper we show that nonclassical states of a quantum harmonic oscillators initially in thermal equilibrium states can be deterministically created by coupling it to a single two level system. This can be achieved even in the absorption regime in which the two level system is initially in the ground state. The method is resilient to noise and it may actually benefit from it, as witnessed by the systems with higher <b>thermal</b> <b>energy</b> <b>producing</b> more nonclassical states.

40|$|Friction Stir Welding (FSW) {{is a new}} {{solid state}} process for joining metals by {{plasticizing}} and consolidating materials around the bond line using <b>thermal</b> <b>energy</b> <b>producing</b> from frictional forces. A feasibility study for FSW of Metal Matrix Composites (MMC) was investigated using aluminum 6092 alloy reinforced with 17 % SiC particulates. FSW process consists of a special rotating pin tool that is positioned to plunge into the MMC surface at the bond line. As the tool rotates and move forward along the bond line, the material at the bond line is heated up and forced to flow around the rotating tip to consolidate on the tip's backside to form a solid state joint. FSW {{has the potential for}} producing sound welds with MMC because the processing temperature occurs well below the melting point of the metal matrix; thereby eliminating the reinforcement-to-matrix solidification defects, reducing the undesirable chemical reactions and porosity problems...|$|R

The influence of policy instruments is studied by devising different incentive scenarios for the United Kingdom. Substantial and predictable rewards for renewable electricity and heat are essential to harness the full potential of AD in addition to the current emphasis on landfill tax.

40|$|A new metric {{has been}} {{developed}} to evaluate and compare selective absorber coatings for concentrating solar power applications. Previous metrics have typically considered {{the performance of the}} selective coating (i. e., solar absorptance and thermal emittance), but cost and durability were not considered. This report describes the development of the levelized cost of coating (LCOC), which is similar to the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) commonly used to evaluate alternative energy technologies. The LCOC is defined as the ratio of the annualized cost of the coating (and associated costs such as labor and number of heliostats required) to the average annual <b>thermal</b> <b>energy</b> <b>produced</b> by the receiver. The baseline LCOC using Pyromark 2500 paint was found to be % 240. 055 /MWht, and the distribution of LCOC values relative to this baseline were determined in a probabilistic analysis to range from -% 241. 6 /MWht to % 247. 3 /MWht, accounting for the cost of additional (or fewer) heliostats required to yield the same baseline average annual <b>thermal</b> <b>energy</b> <b>produced</b> by the receiver. A stepwise multiple rank regression analysis showed that the initial solar absorptance was the most significant parameter impacting the LCOC, followed by thermal emittance, degradation rate, reapplication interval, and downtime during reapplication...|$|E
5000|$|Electromigration, {{which means}} to {{physically}} move the atom to new locations (to physically alter the device itself) is {{another type of}} attack. It involves the relocation of metal atoms due to high current densities, a phenomenon in which atoms are carried along by an [...] "electron wind" [...] {{in the opposite direction}} to the conventional current, producing voids at the negative electrode and hillocks and whiskers at the positive electrode. Void formation leads to a local increase in current density and Joule heating (the interaction of electrons and metal ions to <b>produce</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>energy),</b> <b>producing</b> further electromigration effects. When the external stress is removed, the disturbed system tends to relax back to its original equilibrium state, resulting in a backflow which heals some of the electromigration damage. In the long term though, this can cause device failure, but in less extreme cases it simply serves to alter a device’s operating characteristics in noticeable ways.|$|R
