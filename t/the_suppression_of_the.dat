Only Christian men owning landed property for at least ten years were enfranchised to vote. Until 1869 Jews generally remained excluded, unlike in Prussia proper.|$|E
5|$|Historian Steven Boyd {{argued that}} <b>the</b> <b>suppression</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Whiskey Rebellion {{prompted}} anti-Federalist westerners to finally accept the Constitution {{and to seek}} change by voting for Republicans rather than resisting the government. Federalists, for their part, came to accept the public's role in governance and no longer challenged the freedom of assembly {{and the right to}} petition.|$|E
5|$|On 1 January 1960 French Cameroun gained {{independence}} from France under President Ahmadou Ahidjo. On 1 October 1961, the formerly British Southern Cameroons united with French Cameroun {{to form the}} Federal Republic of Cameroon. Ahidjo used the ongoing war with the UPC to concentrate power in the presidency, continuing with this even after <b>the</b> <b>suppression</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> UPC in 1971.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> {{sequential}} <b>suppression</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> individual Υ {{states in}} PbPb collisions {{with respect to}} their yields in pp data has been measured. The PbPb and pp datasets used in these proceedings correspond to integrated luminosities of 150 /μb and 230 /nb, respectively, collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC at 2. 76 TeV in 2011. <b>The</b> relative <b>suppression</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> excited Υ states has been measured with respect to the Υ(1 S) ground state, expressed as a double ratio [Υ(nS) /Υ(1 S) ]_PbPb /[Υ(nS) /Υ(1 S) ]_pp. <b>The</b> absolute <b>suppression</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Υ(nS) yields in PbPb relative to the yields in pp scaled by <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> nucleon-nucleon collisions, R_AA, is measured as a function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> collision centrality. Integrated over centrality, the R_AA values for Υ(1 S), Υ(2 S), and <b>the</b> upper limit <b>of</b> Υ(3 S) R_AA are reported in these proceedings, which demonstrate <b>the</b> sequential <b>suppression</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Υ(nS) states in PbPb collisions at LHC energies...|$|R

5|$|About {{two hours}} later, it became {{apparent}} that the badly coordinated uprising had failed, as the remaining 550 native soldiers refused to participate in the mutiny, instead helping to quell the rebellion. Some went into the town to protect French civilians and office buildings from attack. Three Vietnamese sergeants were subsequently awarded the Médaille militaire for their role in <b>the</b> <b>suppression</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mutiny, while six other tirailleurs received the Croix de Guerre. The attack initially generated confusion among the French administration. It was widely reported by the French media in Vietnam and Europe that the Indochinese Communist Party had organised the uprising.|$|E
5|$|Around 1920, Petrov was {{transferred}} to Central Asia and fought in <b>the</b> <b>suppression</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Basmachi movement, a Muslim uprising against Russian and Soviet rule. He later fought against insurgents in the Caucasus before {{being sent to the}} Tambov Infantry School, from which he graduated in 1923. While at the school, he participated in <b>the</b> <b>suppression</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tambov Rebellion. He graduated from the Transcaucasian Political School in 1925. In 1932, he graduated from the armored commanders refresher courses. Petrov served as the commander of a training battalion in the 1st Mechanized Brigade, before fighting in the Spanish Civil War, serving as a battalion commander in Dmitry Pavlov's tank brigade from October 1936 to June 1937. He was awarded the Order of the Red Star on 2 January 1937. On 21 June he was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union and the Order of Lenin for his leadership. Returning to the Soviet Union, he held appointments as a battalion commander and then as a tank brigade commander. In 1937, he became commander of a tank division. In June of that year, he became commander of the 5th Mechanized Corps.|$|E

50|$|In 2008, Cullen, under <b>the</b> {{direction}} <b>of</b> {{his superior}} and head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Archdiocese <b>of</b> Philadelphia - Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua, {{carried out a}} program which would restructure many parishes in the Diocese. As part of this program, 47 parishes were closed, this reduced the number parishes from 151 to 104. Closed churches were then sold. In seven cases, the Congregation for the Clergy overturned the church closing while affirming <b>the</b> <b>suppressions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parishes in each case.|$|R
5|$|At this time, and {{following}} the disastrous Battle of Acheloos in 917, the Byzantines were mostly occupied in the Balkans in a protracted conflict against Bulgaria. Hence, Kourkouas's first task as Domestic of the East was <b>the</b> <b>suppression</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> revolt of Bardas Boilas, the governor (strategos) of Chaldia, a strategically important area on the Empire's northeastern Anatolian frontier. This was quickly achieved and his brother, Theophilos Kourkouas, replaced Boilas as governor of Chaldia. As commander of this northernmost sector of the eastern frontier, Theophilos proved a competent soldier and gave valuable assistance to his brother's campaigns.|$|E
5|$|Briton was {{the first}} of the trio to be {{commissioned}} and was assigned to the East Indies Station in 1871. She remained there for four and a half years, mostly engaged on <b>the</b> <b>suppression</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> slave trade. The ship was refitted and rearmed upon her return home and Briton remained in reserve until recommissioned in 1881 for service on the Cape Station. She was transferred back to the East Indies after two years on the Cape. Her crew was relieved in 1884 by another sent out from Britain and the ship remained on station until she was sold, less her armament, in Bombay in 1887.|$|E
5|$|Chiprovtsi {{is thought}} to have been founded in the Late Middle Ages as a mining and metalsmithing centre. Attracting German ore miners who {{introduced}} Roman Catholicism to the area, the town grew in importance as a cultural, economic and religious centre of the Bulgarian Catholics and the entire Bulgarian northwest during the first few centuries of Ottoman rule. The apogee of this upsurge was the anti-Ottoman Chiprovtsi Uprising of 1688. After <b>the</b> <b>suppression</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> uprising, some of the town's population fled to Habsburg-ruled lands; those unable to flee were killed or enslaved by the Ottomans.|$|E

5|$|In 1892, Du Bois {{received}} a fellowship from the John F. Slater Fund for the Education of Freedmen {{to attend the}} University of Berlin for graduate work. While a student in Berlin, he traveled extensively throughout Europe. He came of age intellectually in the German capital, while studying with some of that nation's most prominent social scientists, including Gustav von Schmoller, Adolph Wagner, and Heinrich von Treitschke. After returning from Europe, Du Bois completed his graduate studies; in 1895 {{he was the first}} African American to earn a Ph.D. from Harvard University. His dissertation was <b>The</b> <b>Suppression</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> African Slave Trade to the United States of America, 1638–1871.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, a {{memorial}} stone was erected at Black River, Jamaica, near where Zong would have landed. A sailing ship representing Zong was sailed to Tower Bridge in London in March 2007 {{to commemorate the}} 200th anniversary of the Act for the Abolition of the Slave Trade, {{at a cost of}} £300,000. The vessel housed depictions of the Zong massacre and the slave trade. It was accompanied by HMS Northumberland, with an exhibition on board commemorating the role of the Royal Navy after 1807 in <b>the</b> <b>suppression</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> slave trade.|$|E
5|$|James II took {{advantage}} of <b>the</b> <b>suppression</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rebellion to consolidate his power. He asked Parliament to repeal the Test Act and the Habeas Corpus Act, used his dispensing power to appoint Roman Catholics to senior posts, and raised {{the strength of the}} standing army. Parliament opposed many of these moves, and on 20 November 1685 James dismissed it. In 1688, when the birth of James Francis Edward Stuart heralded a Catholic succession, James II was overthrown in a coup d'état by William of Orange in the Glorious Revolution at the invitation of the disaffected Protestant Establishment.|$|E

5|$|Justinian {{selected}} one of {{his most}} trusted and talented generals, Belisarius, who had recently distinguished himself against the Persians and in <b>the</b> <b>suppression</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nika riots, to lead the expedition. As Ian Hughes points out, Belisarius was also eminently suited for this appointment for two other reasons: he was a native Latin-speaker, and was solicitous of the welfare of the local population, keeping a tight leash on his troops. Both these qualities would be crucial in winning support from the Latin-speaking African population. Belisarius was accompanied by his wife, Antonina, and by Procopius, his secretary, who wrote the history of the war.|$|E
5|$|Kaiserin Augusta served abroad between 1897 and 1902, {{primarily}} in the East Asia Squadron {{under the command of}} Admiral Otto von Diederichs. During this time, the ship's crew assisted in <b>the</b> <b>suppression</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Boxer Rebellion in 1900. In 1902, she returned to Germany for an extensive overhaul that lasted until 1907, after which she went into reserve. Following the outbreak of World War I in 1914, Kaiserin Augusta was mobilized to serve as a gunnery training ship. She served in this role throughout the war; the ship was ultimately sold for scrapping in October 1919 and broken up the following year.|$|E
5|$|Qutayba {{was born}} in 669 CE in Basra, where his family was influential. His father, Muslim ibn ʿAmr, had enjoyed the favour of the Umayyads, and fell at the Battle of Maskin {{at the close of}} the Second Islamic Civil War. Qutayba rose at first as the protege of Anbasa ibn Sa'id, but was noticed by the {{powerful}} governor of Iraq and the East, al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf, during <b>the</b> <b>suppression</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> revolt of Abd al-Rahman ibn Muhammad ibn al-Ash'ath in 700/701.

5|$|State {{repression}} (including {{the infamous}} 1894 French lois scélérates) of the anarchist and labour movements following the few successful bombings and assassinations {{may have contributed}} to the abandonment of these kinds of tactics, although reciprocally state repression, in the first place, may have played a role in these isolated acts. The dismemberment of the French socialist movement, into many groups and, following <b>the</b> <b>suppression</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1871 Paris Commune, the execution and exile of many communards to penal colonies, favoured individualist political expression and acts.|$|E
5|$|The Austrian army, under Field Marshal Blasius Columban, Freiherr von Bender, invaded in the United Belgian States and {{encountered}} little {{resistance from}} the population which was already discontented with the governance and infighting of the rebels. The Austrians defeated the Statist army at the Battle of Falmagne on 28 September. Hainaut {{was the first to}} recognise Leopold's sovereignty and other cities soon followed. Namur was captured on 24 November. The Sovereign Congress met for the final time on 27 November before disbanding itself. On 3 December, the Austrians accepted the surrender of Brussels and reoccupied the city, effectively marking <b>the</b> <b>suppression</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> revolution.|$|E
5|$|The Democrats renominated former President Cleveland, {{making the}} 1892 {{election}} a rematch {{of the one}} four years earlier.
