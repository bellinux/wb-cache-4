40|$|Traditional African {{foods are}} often rich in {{nutrients}} and {{play an important}} role in increasing variety in diets of people in rural areas. Tshidzimba is popular amongst the Vhavenda of South Africa. It is made from maize samp, milled peanuts and salt. However, it has a very short shelf life when stored at ambient temperature. Canning, drying and fermentation of Tshidzimba were investigated to increase shelf-life. Factors investigated were microbiological quality, nutrient content (in terms of fat and protein content), levels of essential amino acids, water activity and sensory acceptability. Unpreserved Tshidzimba had very high <b>total</b> <b>plate</b> <b>counts,</b> yeasts and moulds after 3 days of storage at 25 °C. Fermentation reduced the yeasts and moulds by 102 and <b>total</b> <b>plate</b> <b>counts</b> by 103 after 21 days of storage at 25 °C from those of unpreserved Tshidzimba. Drying reduced the yeasts and moulds by 104 and <b>total</b> <b>plate</b> <b>counts</b> by 105 after 21 days of storage at 25 °C. Anaerobic spore formers were not detected in canned Tshidzimba after 21 days of storage at 25 °C. Drying reduced the fat content probably due to fat oxidation at the elevated drying temperature (50 °C). However, in general the preservation methods had little effect on the general nutrient content of Tshidzimba. Tshidzimba protein showed low lysine value compared to the estimates of amino acid requirements for infants. For Tshidzimba to be a good source of nutrients for infants, fortification with a higher proportion of legume grains is recommended. Drying seemed to increase lysine (2. 61 g/ 100 g protein) compared to that of unpreserved Tshidzimba (2. 28 g/ 100 g protein), while canning reduced lysine (1. 97 g/l 00 g protein), probably due to its participation in Maillard reaction at the high canning temperature (116 °C/ 70 min). Fermentation increased methionine content probably due to fermentative microorganisms, which are known to produce some amino acids while fermenting food products. Canning seemed to have reduced the methionine content possibly due to Maillard reaction. Consumer panellists indicated that of the preserved Tshidzimba, dried Tshidzimba had high acceptance compared to canned and fermented Tshidzimba. Some panellists disliked the sour taste of fermented Tshidzimba. Dried Tshidzimba was perceived to have a firmer texture compared to unpreserved Tshidzimba. Further research could help to determine the appropriate temperature/time combination that can least affect the texture of dried Tshidzimba.

Enterobacteriaceae <b>count</b> and <b>Total</b> Aerobic <b>Plate</b> <b>Counts</b> were assayed along the processing line and facilities used in goat processing. Enterobacteriaceae count on goat carcasses increased from 12. 70 logcfu/cm 2 before evisceration to 13. 72 logcfu/cm 2 after singeing, while the <b>Total</b> Aerobic <b>Plate</b> <b>Counts</b> increased from 13. 45 logcfu/cm 2 for tables after wash to 14. 01 logcfu/cm 2 for tables or knives before wash and carcass after wash. These counts exceeded international limits (WHO/European Commission). The microbial assay showed a significant difference in Enterobacteriaceae count (p 0. 05). A positive correlation (r 2 = 0. 0528) ensued between the Enterobacteriaceae <b>count</b> and <b>Total</b> Aerobic <b>Plate</b> <b>Counts.</b> Important Critical Control Points (CCPs) include: goat’s skin after singeing, evisceration, cutting (knife before use), display table before use and waste water generated during the processing. The findings in this study suggest that processed goat carcasses from the abattoir under study will pose serious health hazard to consumers. The public health implications and need to implement Hazard Analysis Critical Control system in goat carcass processing to ensure provision of wholesome meat for the human populace is therefore emphasized...|$|R

40|$|A {{thorough}} {{validation of}} the bacterial adherence to hydrocarbons (BATH) test was performed {{by means of a}} bioluminescence assay. Ten different gram-negative strains were subjected to the BATH test. For the calculation of the adhesion index, several factors had to be taken into account: ATP leakage, the action of ATP-hydrolyzing enzymes, the change in the extraction efficiency of Nucleotide-Releasing Reagent for Microbial Cells (NRB; Lumac bv) after vortexing and the difference in light production after the addition of NRB. When the adhesion index values obtained by bioluminescence measurement were used as reference, the <b>total</b> <b>plate</b> <b>count</b> technique appeared to be unreliable in estimating the number of bacteria adhering to the hydrocarbon phase. A highly significant correlation was established, however, between those reference values and the adhesion index values obtained by the optical density reading for octane and especially for hexadecane. With xylene, no correlation was found between the optical density reading values and the <b>total</b> <b>plate</b> <b>count</b> or bioluminescence values...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} was conducted in March until April 2015 to determine the correlation of weight reduction by smoking {{to the quality of}} smoked mackerel (Euthynnus affinis) fillet that stored at chilling temperature (7 ± 2 °C). The {{research was}} using correlational-experimental method. The first step is filleting the fish at the size of 1. 5 cm in thickness and 70 g in weight, then soaked it in 30 % salt brine for 5 minutes. Then the fillet was soaked in the liquid smoke at the consentration of 8 % for an hour and then dried until the weight was reducing until several percentages, namely: 0 %, 20 %, 40 % and 60 % from the initial weight. Parameters used were hedonic values (appearance, odor, taste and texture), moisture content, pH, free fatty acid, total phenol, and bacterial <b>total</b> <b>plate</b> <b>counts.</b> The data obtained were tabulated and analyzed using simple linear regression. The result shows that the increase of weight reduction on smoked fillet mackerel stored in chilling temperature (7 ± 2 °C) was significantly correlated to the increase of hedonic values (appearance (R 2 = 0. 665), odor (R 2 = 0. 629), taste (R 2 = 0. 559), and texture (R 2 = 0. 763)), total phenol (the first total phenol (R 2 = 0. 868), the end total phenol (R 2 = 0. 940) and free fatty acid (R 2 = 0. 493) (p< 0. 05). Otherwise, it was significantly correlated to the decrease of moisture content (R 2 = 0. 902), pH (R 2 = 0. 339) and bacterial <b>total</b> <b>plate</b> <b>counts</b> (R 2 = 0. 260) (p< 0. 05) ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the quality properties of beef jerky replaced salt with soy sauce, red pepper paste, and soybean paste. The quality properties of beef jerky including final water activity (a w), moisture content, pH, color, shear force, <b>total</b> <b>plate</b> <b>counts,</b> thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) values, and sensory evaluations were investigated. The sliced beef samples were marinated in salt (control), soy sauce (T 1), red pepper paste (T 2), and soybean paste (T 3) for 24 h and then dried at 70 oC for 6 - 8 h. The water activity of finished beef jerky varied from 0. 72 to 0. 70. The water activity for control and T 1 samples decreased more rapidly as drying proceeded up to 6 h. The samples with salt replacement showed a lower pH and lightness than the control (p< 0. 05). The T 1 sample showed a significant decrease in <b>total</b> <b>plate</b> <b>counts</b> after 21 d of storage (p< 0. 05). The TBARS for all treatments increased with storage days (p< 0. 05). The TBARS were significantly lower in T 2 and T 3 samples compared to control and T 1 until 21 d of storage (p< 0. 05). The samples with salt replacement showed a lower intensity of saltiness than the control. Sensory evaluations found that the replaced soy sauce of beef jerky samples had better overall acceptability scores than the other treatment samples. It was concluded that replacing salt with soy sauce can delay lipid oxidation and enhance the sensory acceptance of beef jerkies.
