Six of the zones, A–F, are in the Lower Peninsula while the Upper Peninsula is divided into the remaining <b>two,</b> <b>G</b> and H. There have been a total of 66different highways designated in seven of the zones; as of 2015 no E highways have been named. Participation by the county road commissions is optional, and not all counties use the system.

2500|$|The minor {{products}} of ALOX15, 12-(S)-HpETE and 12(S)-HETE, possess {{a broad range}} of activities. One or both of these compounds stimulates cells by binding with and activating <b>two</b> <b>G</b> protein-coupled receptors, GPR31 and the Leukotriene B4 receptor 2; 12S-HETE also acts as a receptor antagonist by binding to but not stimulating the Thromboxane receptor thereby inhibiting the actions of Thromboxane A2 and Prostaglandin H2 (see 12-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid#Receptor targets and mechanisms of action). As at least a partial consequence of these receptor-directed actions, one or both the two ALOX15 products exhibit pro-inflammation, diabetes-inducing, and vasodilation activities in animal models; cancer-promoting activity on cultured human cancer cells; and other actions (see 12-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid#Activities and possible clinical significance).

It was the first company in the world to attempt this schedule (the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company played all 13 operas consecutively in its 1975 centenary season, but their performance of The Grand Duke was only a concert staging). In the last two of these weeks, Utopia Limited and The Grand Duke, Gilbert and Sullivan's last <b>two</b> <b>G</b> operas, were given rare New York professional revivals, although the American Savoyards had performed them two decades earlier, and LOOM had premiered them earlier.
