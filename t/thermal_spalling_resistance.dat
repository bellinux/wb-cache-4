Different compositions are formulated taking single or combination of metals which are mixed with phenol formaldehyde resin and pressed with a specific pressure of 2000 kg/cm 2. The bricks are cured at 240 °C for 12 hours. Physical, thermal and thermo mechanical properties are evaluated. Also the bricks are fired at 1100 °C in reducing atmosphere. Physical, thermal and thermo mechanical properties are evaluated and correlated with the mineralogical and microstructural analysis. Based on these findings carbon bearing plates are made {{with the addition of}} carbon black or carbon black and graphite. The addition is restricted up to 5 %. Properties are evaluated and correlated with mineralogical and microstructural analysis. Plates containing aluminium metal shows superior thermal and thermo-mechanical properties than silicon metal containing Al 2 O 3 slide plates. However plate containing metal in combination has the best thermal and thermo-mechanical properties. Fused alumina based plates has comparatively superior properties for all grade of metal addition. Plate containing both carbon black and graphite flake was having comparatively efficient properties in carbon bonded slide plates. To improve the thermal shock resistance, corrosion resistance and oxidation resistance, along with mechanical properties, in situ synthesised plasma fused ZrO 2 -SiC was incorporated in the Al 2 O 3 –C slide gate plates.

For some applications, aluminum requires protective coatings due to its limited wear and lower temperature resistance compared to steel.

Since this effect is the same in geopolymer and Portland cement concretes, it is independent of binders' chemical compositions.

40|$|Titanium alloys {{have long}} been {{considered}} candidate materials for use in monolithic armor systems due to their excellent specific mechanical properties and relative ease of manufacture. However, high production costs combined with a propensity to fail due to adiabatic shear band formation and spallation have limited the adoption of titanium alloys in armor systems. In this paper, the spall behavior of the workhorse titanium alloy, Ti– 6 Al– 4 V, is investigated via a series of plate impact experiments. Back-scatter electron (BSE) microscopy and electron back-scatter diffraction (EBSD) are carried out on recovered specimens to investigate the nature of spall initiation and propagation. It is found that spall initiation occurs by the nucleation of voids at the grain boundaries between plastically hard/soft grains of the dominant hcp α phase. Further, it is shown that spall then propagates via the growth/coalescence of the nucleated voids into facets, followed by the coalescence of the facets through highly localized ductile bridging.

40|$|Geopolymer is an {{amorphous}} aluminosilicate binder {{which is}} produced by hydrothermal synthesis of aluminosilicates {{in the presence of}} concentrated alkaline or alkaline silicate solutions. It is an emerging construction material purported to provide an environmentally-friendly alternative to ordinary Portland cement (OPC) based concrete. Owing to its ceramic-like properties, geopolymer has been touted to be a highly fire resistant material. This claim is further supported by results from investigations of residual strength after thermal exposure. Some studies have found that geopolymers increase in strength after exposure to temperatures of 800 °C. In contrast, several recent studies have shown a decrease in residual strength of geopolymers after a similar exposure. These contradictory observations are explored here. The study shows that two opposing processes are occurring simultaneously in geopolymers at elevated temperatures. Process (1) is further geopolymerization, and has the effect of increasing the strength. Process (2) is the damage due to thermal incompatibility which arises because of (i) the temperature gradient and (ii) different movements between matrix and inclusions. Process (2) is also a function of the brittleness level of the material. Whether the strength increases or decreases is dependent on which of the two processes is dominant in the specimen and the test conditions. The detailed examination of process (2) reveals a strong correlation between the degree of strength loss and the brittleness of geopolymers. This correlation suggests that geopolymers are quite brittle. For the first time, the brittleness of geopolymer concrete has been quantitatively determined and compared with OPC concrete. The comparatively high brittleness of geopolymer concrete is important for its fire resistance properties. The high brittleness will also require special structural design measures, similar to the design requirements for high strength concrete. With regard to the fire resistance of geopolymers, most research to date has investigated only residual strength, but the properties of geopolymer while hot have received less attention. Therefore, a number of tests to determine stress-strain curve, ultimate strength, elastic modulus and creep were undertaken in steady and transient heating conditions. In these tests, several critical features of the material’s performance were observed: (1) geopolymers exhibit glass transition behaviour at elevated temperatures; (2) glass transition temperature is improved by the substitution of a sodium-based activator for the potassium-based activator; (3) below glass transition temperature there is a significant increase in hot strength and hot elastic modulus; (4) in the range of 250 - 550 °C thermal transitional creep is absent as compared to OPC concrete. Data obtained from these measurements can serve as input for the development of constitutive models which are essential to predict the response of geopolymer concrete elements in fire. In addition to its deteriorating properties at high temperatures, concrete can also be damaged in fire by a phenomenon called spalling, which is particularly severe in high strength concrete. Since geopolymer is comparatively more brittle than high strength concrete, the issue of spalling in fire is further explored in the last part of this study. It was found that the <b>spalling</b> <b>resistance</b> of geopolymer concrete increases as maximum aggregate size increases. The increasing aggregate size results in an increase in fracture zone length (lp); this in turn reduces the flux of kinetic energy (due to pore pressure) that is released into the fracture front and thereby improves <b>spalling</b> <b>resistance.</b> This theory is further validated by the observation of a good correlation between lp and <b>spalling</b> <b>resistance</b> in this thesis. This study is the first to propose such a hypothesis on the effect of aggregate size on the spalling of concrete, both OPC and geopolymer, and contributes {{to a better understanding of}} spalling of concrete in fire...|$|R
40|$|High-strength Portland cement {{concrete}} {{has a high}} risk of spalling in fire. Geopolymer, an environmentally friendly alternative to Portland cement, is purported to possess superior fire-resistant properties. However, the spalling behaviour of geopolymer concrete in fire is unreported. In this paper, geopolymer and Portland {{cement concrete}}s of strengths from 40 to 100 MPa were exposed to rapid temperature rises, simulating fire exposures. Two simulated fire tests, namely rapid surface temperature rise exposure test and standard curve fire test, were conducted. In both types of test, no spalling was found in geopolymer concretes, whereas the companion Portland cement concrete exhibited spalling. This can be attributed to different pore structures of the two concretes. The sorptivity test found that geopolymer concrete had a significantly higher sorption, therefore more connected pores, than Portland cement concrete when compared at the same strength level. Hence, it is suggested that the water vapour can escape from the geopolymer matrix quicker than in Portland cement concrete, resulting in lower internal pore pressure. The paper concludes that, when compared at the same strength level, the geopolymer concrete possesses higher <b>spalling</b> <b>resistance</b> in a fire than Portland cement concrete due to its increased porosity...|$|R
40|$|We present {{systematic}} investigations on {{the shock}} responses of nanoporous aluminum (np-Al) by nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. The dislocation nucleation sites {{are found to}} concentrate in low latitude region near the equator of the spherical void surfaces. We propose a continuum wave reflection theory and a resolved shear stress model to explain the distribution of dislocation nucleation sites. The simulations reveals two mechanisms of void collapse: the plasticity mechanism and the internal jetting mechanism. The plasticity mechanism, which leads to transverse collapse of voids, prevails under relatively weaker shocks; while the internal jetting mechanism, which leads to longitudinal filling of the void vacuum, plays more significant role as the shock intensity increases. In addition, an abnormal thermodynamic phenomenon (i. e., arising of temperature with pressure dropping) in shocked np-Al is discovered. This phenomenon is incompatible with the conventional Rankine-Hugoniot theory, and is explained by the nonequilibrium processes involved in void collapse. The influences of void collapse on spall fracture of np-Al is studied. Under the same loading velocity, the spall strength of np-Al {{is found to be}} lower than that of single-crystal Al; but the <b>spall</b> <b>resistance</b> is higher in np-Al than in single-crystal Al. This is explained by the combined influences of thermal dissipation and stress attenuation during shock wave propagation in np-Al...|$|R
40|$|High alumina {{refractories}} {{are manufactured}} with high quality {{raw materials and}} normally possess good hot properties and can be lined in operation zones with critical conditions. However, certain application areas require very high specifications. An example is the carbon black reactor which operates beyond 2000 °C. Here, conventional high alumina refractories do not give good performance and life. In the present study, an attempt {{has been made to}} study the development of refractories suitable for use in carbon black reactor. Zirconia is added to high alumina refractories to improve its thermo mechanical properties and <b>spalling</b> <b>resistance.</b> Transformation toughening due to tetragonal to monoclinic phase change in zirconia is utilized for the improvement of properties. Zirconia can be obtained from many sources. The raw materials selected have an important bearing on the properties of the final product. Three different sources of zirconia were used to optimize zirconia. This was followed by optimization of reactive alumina. Reactive alumina has very fine particle size which helps to achieve better sintering and reduces porosity. Hot properties were further improved by the addition of chrome oxide. Physical, thermal and thermo – mechanical properties, critical to operating conditions in the carbon black reactor, were studied and reported in this thesis...|$|R
