5|$|I {{feel that}} {{talking about it}} trivializes it. I've been {{studying}} the Cabala , which is the mystical interpretation of the Torah. I've studied Buddhism and Hinduism and I've been practising yoga and obviously I {{know a lot about}} Catholicism. There are indisputable truths that connect all of them, and I find that very comforting and kind. My spiritual journey is <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>open</b> to everything. Pay attention to what makes sense, be absorbed. For me, yoga is the closest thing to our real nature.|$|E
5|$|In March 2015, the Federal Highway Administration {{issued a}} Record of Decision {{selecting}} a build alternative. Freeway construction began in early 2016, with the Chandler Boulevard extension project to facilitate local access beginning in summer 2015. The freeway is planned <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>open</b> to traffic in late 2019 or early 2020.|$|E

5|$|The {{standardized}} {{procedures for}} testimony by forensic chemists {{are provided by}} the various agencies that employ the scientists as well as SWGDRUG. Forensic chemists are ethically bound to present testimony in a neutral manner and <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>open</b> to reconsidering their statements if new information is found. Chemists should also limit their testimony to areas they have been qualified in regardless of questions during direct or cross-examination.|$|E
5|$|Federal law prohibits {{alcoholic}} beverages from being shipped through the mail. New Jersey effectively prohibits the shipment {{of beer and}} spirits to customers by requiring a liquor license to transport alcohol, but not having any class of liquor license that grants permission to ship beer or spirits. United Parcel Service (UPS) and Federal Express will ship wine to a person's home, but will only deliver beer or hard liquor to a licensed business. Although uncommon, it is legal for a liquor store to deliver {{alcoholic beverages}} by car or van to a person's home. ABC regulations mandate that the alcoholic beverages being delivered are paid for in advance, that they are received by someone 21 or older, and that they take place when the licensed establishment is permitted <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>open.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Raptor {{has three}} {{internal}} weapons bays: a large bay {{on the bottom}} of the fuselage, and two smaller bays on the sides of the fuselage, aft of the engine intakes. The main bay can accommodate six LAU-142/A launchers for beyond-visual-range missiles and each side bay has an LAU-141/A launcher for short-range missiles. Four of the launchers in the main bay can be replaced with two bomb racks that can each carry one 1,000lb (450kg) or four 250lb (110kg) bombs. Carrying armaments internally maintains the aircraft's stealth and minimizes additional drag. Missile launches require the bay doors <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>open</b> for less than a second, during which hydraulic arms push missiles clear of the aircraft; this is to reduce vulnerability to detection and to deploy missiles during high speed flight.|$|E

5|$|The complex {{was partly}} {{demolished}} {{just after the}} war on Churchill's direct orders (and to the great annoyance of the French, who were not consulted), as it was still seen {{as a threat to}} the United Kingdom. It was later reopened by private owners, first in 1969 to serve as a mushroom farm and subsequently as a museum in 1984. A nature conservation organisation acquired the Fortress of Mimoyecques in 2010 and La Coupole, a former V-2 rocket base turned museum near Saint-Omer, took over its management. It continues <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>open</b> to the public as a vast underground museum complex.|$|E
5|$|The {{first section}} of I-380 opened to traffic on September 19, 1973. That section {{connected}} The Eastern Iowa Airport to I-80 at Coralville. Within three years, the interstate had been extended into Cedar Rapids at the Cedar River. The bridge which crossed the river would not open until June 1979. By the end of 1981, I-380 was a continuous road to the Coldstream Avenue/Glass Road interchange. The interstate was originally scheduled <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>open</b> by Christmas 1984, but weather delays pushed back the construction timetable. The last section of I-380 to be completed opened on September 12, 1985.|$|E
5|$|Bright arcs and spots {{sporadically}} appear {{within the}} main ovals. These transient phenomena {{are thought to}} be related to interaction with the solar wind. The magnetic field lines in this region are believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>open</b> or to map onto the magnetotail. The secondary ovals observed inside the main oval {{may be related to the}} boundary between open and closed magnetic field lines or to the polar cusps. The polar auroral emissions are similar to those observed around Earth's poles: both appear when electrons are accelerated towards the planet by potential drops, during reconnection of solar magnetic field with that of the planet. The regions within both main ovals emit most of auroral X-rays. The spectrum of the auroral X-ray radiation consists of spectral lines of highly ionized oxygen and sulfur, which probably appear when energetic (hundreds of kiloelectronvolts) S and O ions precipitate into the polar atmosphere of Jupiter. The source of this precipitation remains unknown.|$|E

5|$|In {{the wake}} of the tornado, the mayor of Sleepy Hollow {{declared}} a village-wide state of emergency. Two hundred emergency personnel responded to the storm. Consolidated Edison (conEdison) crews were sent out to repair downed power lines and clear roads. By the next night, power was restored to all but 600 of the previous 10,000 residences without power in Westchester. Westchester County opened its Emergency Operations Center after the storm to respond to the event. Two days after the storm, many of the roads had been cleared and power was fully restored. A recreational path in Tarrytown, New York, was not expected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>open</b> for another two weeks due to numerous fallen trees. Metro-North Railroad suspended trains on the Upper Harlem line until 5:00p.m. EDT (21:00 UTC) for the removal of debris on the tracks. During the time the rails were shut down, southbound passengers were transported by bus. All trains were back on schedule by 7:00p.m. EDT (23:00 UTC).|$|E
5|$|Like {{with many}} large {{cities in the}} United States, Denver’s CBD and the {{adjacent}} neighborhoods were blighted {{with the presence of}} many open parking lots in the 1970s and 80’s. Recent focus to redevelop these open lots and increase density/activity in the city’s core have been hugely successful as many of these lots are today being turned into large residential, retail and commercial developments. This is especially true around the newly redeveloped and highly popular Union Station area in Denver’s LoDo (Lower Downtown) neighborhood. What used <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>open</b> land, parking lots, warehouses and rail yards as recently as {{the turn of the century}} is now several city blocks of new residential and commercial buildings as well as a new RTD underground bus terminal, rail platforms/pavilions and a park. There are also improved pedestrian friendly connections to the RiNo (River North), Five Points, Auraria and Highland neighborhoods from the new development. Historic Union Station itself has been fully renovated and turned back into a travel and activity hub. It now includes the Denver Amtrak station, a new boutique hotel and several restaurants, bars & shops all centered on the large Great Hall inside and a public plaza outside along Wynkoop Street. Starting in April 2016 the University of Colorado A-Line commuter train began service directly connecting Union Station and downtown Denver to Denver International Airport and the airport's new 500+ room Westin Hotel & conference center.|$|E
5|$|Pottery {{produced}} locally in East Africa {{was shaped}} by hand, unglazed, and assumed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>open</b> fired, {{but it has been}} proposed that the absence of evidence for kilns {{may be the result of}} mistaking their remnants for metal furnaces. However, the absence of glazed and wheeled pottery illustrates that the inhabitants of the Swahili Coast did not adapt these technologies as a result of Indian Ocean trade, but were primarily the recipients of finished products in exchange for other local produce. Conversely, fifteen different potters' marks have been found at Gedi on pottery found on or near the surface of the site dating to the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, which has been used to suggest the site may have had a communal kiln at that time. The pots inscribed with the potters marks show the variation of different types and styles of ceramics over time, which were influenced by local production, as well as, the adaption of foreign design elements. Prior to the diversification of local styles and types, early ceramics at Gedi were more uniform and contained similarities with ceramics found at other coastal sites. Despite the increase of imported ceramics in the fifteenth century, local varieties continued to be present in later levels of the sites occupation.|$|E

5|$|Weaver {{also took}} {{up the issue of}} white {{settlement}} in Indian Territory. For several years, white settlers had been claiming homesteads in the Unassigned Lands in what is now Oklahoma. After the Civil War, the Five Civilized Tribes had been forced to cede their unused western lands to the federal government. The settlers, known as Boomers, believed that federal ownership made the lands open to settlement under the Homestead Acts. The federal government disagreed, as did the Cherokee Nation, which leased its neighboring Cherokee Outlet to Kansas cattle ranchers, and many Easterners, who believed the Boomers to be the tools of railroad interests. Weaver saw the issue as one between the landless poor homesteaders and wealthy cattlemen, and took the side of the former. He introduced a bill in December 1885 to organize Indian Territory and the neighboring Neutral Strip into a new Oklahoma Territory. The bill died in committee, but Weaver reintroduced it in February 1886 and gave a speech calling for the Indian reservations to be broken up into homesteads for individual Natives and the remaining land <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>open</b> to white settlement.|$|E
5|$|Within a fortnight, {{the navy}} had its first victory when the Asiatic Squadron, led by Commodore George Dewey, {{destroyed}} the Spanish navy at the Battle of Manila Bay in the Philippines. Dewey's overwhelming victory expanded {{the scope of}} the war from one centered in the Caribbean to one that would determine the fate of all of Spain's Pacific colonies. The next month, he increased the number of troops sent to the Philippines and granted the force's commander, Major General Wesley Merritt, the power to set up legal systems and raise taxes—necessities for a long occupation. By the time the troops arrived in the Philippines at the end of June 1898, McKinley had decided that Spain would be required to surrender the archipelago to the United States. He professed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>open</b> to all views on the subject; however, he believed that as the war progressed, the public would come to demand retention of the islands as a prize of war.|$|E
