40|$|This is {{a thesis}} report done {{as part of}} the Master of Science in Electronics Design Engineering given at Linköping University, Campus Norrköping. The thesis work is done at Ericsson AB in the spring of 2005. The thesis {{describes}} a method of removing variations in the <b>tuning</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of voltage-controlled crystal oscillators due to different manufacturing processes. These variations results in unwanted variations in the modulation bandwidth of the phase-locked loop the oscillator is used in. Through examination of the theory of phase-locked loops it is found that the bandwidth of the loop is dependent on the <b>tuning</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of the oscillator. A method of correcting the oscillator-sensitivity by amplifying or attenuating the control-voltage of the oscillator is developed. The size of the correction depends on the difference in oscillator-sensitivity compared to that of an ideal oscillator. This error is measured and the correct correction constant calculated. To facilitate the measurements and correction extra circuits are developed and inserted in the loop. The circuits are both analog and digital. The analog circuits are mounted on an extra circuit board and the digital circuits are implemented in VHDL in an external FPGA. Tests and theoretical calculations show that the method is valid and able to correct both positive and negative variations in oscillator-sensitivity of up to a factor ± 2. 5 times. The bandwidth of the loop can be adjusted between 2 to 15 Hz (up to ± 8 dB, relative an unmodified loop) ...|$|E

Male song {{production}} and female behavioural sensitivity form {{a pair of}} matched frequency filters, which in Gryllus bimaculatus are tuned to a frequency of about 4. 7 kHz. Directional sensitivity is supported by an elaborate system of acoustic tracheae, which make the ears function as pressure difference receivers.

30|$|We {{employ a}} Hodgkin-Huxley-type model of basolateral ionic {{currents}} in bullfrog saccular hair cells {{for studying the}} genesis of spontaneous voltage oscillations and their {{role in shaping the}} response of the hair cell to external mechanical stimuli. Consistent with recent experimental reports, we find that the spontaneous dynamics of the model can be categorized using conductance parameters of calcium-activated potassium, inward rectifier potassium, and mechano-electrical transduction (MET) ionic currents. The model is demonstrated for exhibiting a broad spectrum of autonomous rhythmic activity, including periodic and quasi-periodic oscillations with two independent frequencies as well as various regular and chaotic bursting patterns. Complex patterns of spontaneous oscillations in the model emerge at small values of the conductance of Ca 2 +-activated potassium currents. These patterns are significantly affected by thermal fluctuations of the MET current. We show that self-sustained regular voltage oscillations lead to enhanced and sharply <b>tuned</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of the hair cell to weak mechanical periodic stimuli. While regimes of chaotic oscillations are argued to result in poor tuning to sinusoidal driving, chaotically oscillating cells do provide a high sensitivity to low-frequency variations of external stimuli.|$|R
