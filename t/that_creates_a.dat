5|$|As a Predator ship reaches Earth's orbit, it fires a beam <b>that</b> <b>creates</b> <b>a</b> {{passage through}} the ice towards {{the source of the}} heat bloom. When the team arrives at the {{abandoned}} whaling station above the heat source, they find the passage and descend beneath the ice. They locate the mysterious pyramid and begin to explore it, finding evidence of a prehistoric civilization and {{what appears to be a}} sacrificial chamber filled with human skeletons with ruptured rib cages.|$|E
5|$|If two {{disjoint}} smooth simple closed curves {{undergo the}} curve-shortening flow simultaneously, they remain disjoint as the flow progresses. The reason is that, if two smooth curves {{move in a}} way <b>that</b> <b>creates</b> <b>a</b> crossing, then {{at the time of}} first crossing the curves would necessarily be tangent to each other, without crossing. But, in such a situation, the two curves' curvatures at the point of tangency would necessarily pull them apart rather than pushing them together into a crossing. For the same reason, a single simple closed curve can never evolve to cross itself. This phenomenon is known as the avoidance principle.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} viral capsid enters the cell, an enzyme called reverse {{transcriptase}} liberates the single-stranded (+)RNA genome from the attached viral proteins and copies {{it into a}} complementary DNA (cDNA) molecule. The process of reverse transcription is extremely error-prone, and the resulting mutations may cause drug resistance or allow the virus to evade the body's immune system. The reverse transcriptase also has ribonuclease activity that degrades the viral RNA during the synthesis of cDNA, as well as DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity <b>that</b> <b>creates</b> <b>a</b> sense DNA from the antisense cDNA. Together, the cDNA and its complement form a double-stranded viral DNA that is then transported into the cell nucleus. The integration of the viral DNA into the host cell's genome is carried out by another viral enzyme called integrase.|$|E

5|$|There are {{two basic}} {{aerodynamic}} models of insect flight. Most insects use a method <b>that</b> <b>creates</b> <b>a</b> spiralling leading edge vortex. Some very small insects use the fling and clap or Weis-Fogh mechanism in which the wings clap together above the insect's body and then fling apart. As they fling open, the air gets sucked in and creates a vortex over each wing. This bound vortex then moves across the wing and, in the clap, acts as the starting vortex for the other wing. Circulation and lift are increased, {{at the price of}} wear and tear on the wings.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the various}} {{patterns}} and motifs found in Delian mosaics is the triple-colored lozenge <b>that</b> <b>creates</b> <b>a</b> three-dimensional illusion of cubes in perspective for the viewer. This pattern appears in fifteen different locations, {{making it one}} of the most common. Other motifs include waves and stepped triangles, while major themes include maritime, theatrical, natural, or mythological objects and figures. The single wave pattern, a common motif in Hellenistic art, is the most predominant type of border design for mosaics at Delos and appear in mosaics of Arsameia (albeit arranged in the opposite direction). The rosette motif, which is found in the mosaics of various Hellenistic sites across the Mediterranean, is often coupled with single-wave borders in Delian mosaics. The typical Hellenistic palmette motif is used in a mosaic of Delos to fill the four corners around a central rosette motif. The illusion of three-dimensional relief in the figured scenes of Delian mosaics was usually achieved by the use of polychrome, with white, black, yellow, red, blue and green hues.|$|E

25|$|Anza v. Ideal Steel Supply Corporation, , was a United States Supreme Court case {{in which}} the Court, relying on Holmes v.

The Court explained that this construction will save district courts from the difficulty of determining an indirect victim's damages caused by attenuated conduct.|$|E
