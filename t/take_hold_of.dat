5|$|During {{the rule}} of Grand Master Perellos, the Order was {{amassing}} great wealth. The Inquisitor Delci desired to garner greater power in Malta and attempted to <b>take</b> <b>hold</b> <b>of</b> the Order's hospital. This hospital was a privileged place and nobody could be admitted prior to presenting their honorary crests, however the inquisition's officers infiltrated the hospital and commenced a formal inspection. These were soon ordered to leave the premises by the commanding knight of Avernes de Bocage, who was the hospital's supervisor. This news reached Grand Master Perellos, who sent his emissary, the Great Prior Marc'Antonio Zondadari, to the Court of Rome to forward complaints about the incident.|$|E
5|$|I have labored {{to make a}} {{covenant}} with myself, that affection may not press upon judgment; for I suppose there is no man that hath any apprehension of gentry or nobleness, but his affection stands to the continuance of a house so illustrious, and would <b>take</b> <b>hold</b> <b>of</b> a twig or twine-thread to support it. And yet time hath his revolutions; {{there must be a}} period and an end to all temporal things—finis rerum—an end of names and dignities, and whatsoever is terrene; and why not of de Vere? For where is Bohun? Where is Mowbray? Where is Mortimer? Nay, which is more, and most of all, where is Plantagenet? They are entombed in the urns and sepulchres of mortality! yet let the name of de Vere stand so long as it pleaseth God.|$|E
5|$|More acute {{threat to}} the Polish–Lithuanian state came from Sweden. The {{balance of power in}} the north had shifted in Sweden's favor, as the Baltic {{neighbor}} was led by King Gustavus Adolphus, a highly able and aggressive military leader, who greatly improved the effectiveness of the Swedish armed forces, while also taking advantage of Protestant zealotry. The Commonwealth, exhausted by the wars with Russia and the Ottoman Empire and lacking allies, was poorly prepared to face this new challenge. Continuous diplomatic maneuvering by Sigismund III made the whole situation look to szlachta like another stage in the King's Swedish dynastic affairs; in reality the Swedish power resolved to <b>take</b> <b>hold</b> <b>of</b> the entire Polish-controlled Baltic coast, and thereby profit from the Commonwealth's maritime trade intermediary control, endangering its basis for independent existence.|$|E

5|$|The classic {{types are}} the deathmatch (and its team-based variant) in which players score points by killing other players' characters; and capture the flag, in which teams attempt to {{penetrate}} the opposing base, capture a flag {{and return it to}} their own base whilst preventing the other team from doing the same. Other game modes may involve attempting to capture enemy bases or areas of the map, attempting to <b>take</b> <b>hold</b> <b>of</b> an object {{for as long as possible}} while evading other players, or deathmatch variations involving limited lives or in which players fight over a particularly potent power-up. These match types may also be customizable, allowing the players to vary weapons, health and power-ups found on the map, as well as victory criteria. Games may allow players to choose between various classes, each with its own strengths, weaknesses, equipment and roles within a team.|$|E
5|$|The loss of Plovdiv did {{not seem}} to have had a {{profound}} effect on Ivan's career, and he remained a royal favourite. In 1328, Ivan was tasked by Tsar Michael Shishman with the defence of the Great Palace of Constantinople, the residence of emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos. Andronikos II, facing imminent defeat at the hands of his grandson and co-emperor Andronikos III in a protracted civil war, was distrustful of his own guard, and had requested the assistance of Michael Shishman. The Bulgarian emperor sent Ivan the Russian along with 3,000 horsemen to Constantinople in aid. In the words of Byzantine historian Nikephoros Gregoras, the actual intentions of Michael Shishman were to use Ivan and his men as a Trojan Horse. In a suitable moment, the Bulgarian guard would arrest the emperor and <b>take</b> <b>hold</b> <b>of</b> the palace before allowing Michael Shishman with a large army and Tatar mercenaries into Constantinople.|$|E
25|$|In August 2008, Heim's son Rüdiger {{asked that}} his father be {{declared}} legally dead, in order to <b>take</b> <b>hold</b> <b>of</b> his assets. He claimed he intended to make a donation to humanitarian projects working to document the atrocities committed in the camps.|$|E

25|$|The Army {{moved in}} to <b>take</b> <b>hold</b> <b>of</b> the castle and in 1873 a system of {{recruiting}} areas based on counties was instituted under the Cardwell Reforms and the castle became the depot for the two battalions of the 22nd (Cheshire) Regiment of Foot. Under the Childers Reforms, the 22nd regiment evolved to become the Cheshire Regiment with its depot in the castle in 1881.|$|E
25|$|That was {{the last}} unit to join the rebels, which {{included}} by then part of the 1st and 16th Artillery Regiment, the naval corps and the three warships. Navy members had joined in large numbers as expected, but many military sections considered sympathisers with the cause hadn't joined. Even so, the republican forces included about 400 men in Rotunda, but 1000 to 1500 in Alcântara counting the naval crews, as well as having managed to <b>take</b> <b>hold</b> <b>of</b> the city's artillery, {{with most of the}} ammunition, to which was added the naval artillery. Rotunda and Alcântara were occupied, but concrete plans for the revolution had not yet been decided and the main leaders hadn't yet appeared.|$|E
25|$|In {{the days}} {{immediately}} prior to the incident, chief Mona Rudao held a traditional wedding banquet for his son Daho Mona, during which animals were slaughtered and wine was prepared and drunk. A Japanese police officer named Katsuhiko Yoshimura was on patrol in the area, and was offered a cup of wine by Daho Mona as a symbolic gesture. The officer refused, saying that Daho Mona's hands were soiled with blood from the slaughtered animals. Daho Mona attempted to <b>take</b> <b>hold</b> <b>of</b> the officer, insisting he participate, and the officer struck him with his stick. Fighting ensued, and the officer was injured. Chief Mona Rudao attempted to apologize by presenting a flagon of wine at the officer's house, but was rejected. The simmering resentment among the Seediq in Musha was finally pushed to the limit.|$|E

25|$|To prevent {{more people}} from dying, Tris offers herself over to Erudite and {{is placed in}} a cell by Peter and, to her shock, Caleb, {{both of whom are}} now working with Jeanine. However, Tobias follows her and ends up {{becoming}} captured, although he states that he has managed to convince Dauntless to ally themselves with the factionless, with the upcoming insurgency scheduled several days afterward. After unsuccessful simulation tests, Jeanine orders for Tris' execution, but Peter, in return for Tris' rescue of him at the Amity sector, has swapped the serum for a paralytic serum beforehand and also frees Tobias, allowing the trio a chance to escape back to the Abnegation sector. There, Tris meets with Marcus, who tells her that Jeanine is withholding the information that Abnegation protected; should the factionless <b>take</b> <b>hold</b> <b>of</b> it, it would certainly be destroyed.|$|E
25|$|Later, some Carpists joined Marghiloman's {{administration}} as it attempted {{to restore order}} in the land, but most continued to campaign for their own leader to <b>take</b> <b>hold</b> <b>of</b> government. On Carp's namesday (June 29, 1918), he received an open letter, signed by 40 of his supporters, describing him as a providential figure, and calling on him to fulfill his political mission of governing Romania. In addition to senior Carpists, the signers included poet Alexandru Macedonski and Caragiale's two sons, Mateiu and Luca. On Marghiloman's list, Carp was elected deputy in the legislative election of 1918. However, {{he chose not to}} take part in proceedings, and his seat was left vacant. His political line was expressed by means of a new gazette, Renașterea ("The Renaissance"), published by Nenițescu with assistance from Kostaki, Radu Rosetti, Alexandru Al. Beldiman and Ion Gorun. Renașterea went down in late November 1918, shortly after the unexpected Armistice with Germany sealed the fate of Germanophiles and brought the Ententists back into focus.|$|E
25|$|Fortunately for Pompey, Hyrcanus II {{still had}} {{supporters}} in the city. They opened a gate, probably situated in the northwestern {{part of the city}} wall, and let the Romans in. This allowed Pompey to <b>take</b> <b>hold</b> <b>of</b> Jerusalem's upper city, including the Royal Palace, while Aristobulus' party held the eastern portions of the city—the Temple Mount and the City of David. The Jews consolidated their hold by breaking down the bridge over the Tyropoeon Valley connecting the upper city with the Temple Mount. Pompey offered them the chance to surrender, but when they refused, he began prosecuting the siege with vigour. Pompey had his forces construct a wall of circumvallation around the areas held by the Jews and then pitched his camp within the wall, {{to the north of the}} Temple. Here stood a saddle allowing access to Temple, and it was therefore guarded by the citadel known as the Baris, augmented by a ditch. A second camp was erected south-east of the Temple.|$|E

25|$|In Soulcalibur, Taki {{tried to}} merge the Soul Edge {{fragment}} with her Rekkimaru without success, {{but when she}} fuses it with her other weapon, the kodachi short sword named , she creates a new evil weapon that she seeks to pit against Soul Edge, hoping both blades would then destroy each other. Taki is then contacted by her old master and adoptive father Toki (トキ, also written as 斗鬼) who tells her that Fu-Ma's former leader, Hachibei (八兵衛), has stolen Mekkimaru and fled, becoming a fugitive nukenin (runaway ninja); Toki orders Taki to hunt down and kill Hachibei and his daughter Chie (千恵), a childhood friend, and bring back the blade. Taki locates Hachibei quickly, but learns about Toki's obsession with {{the powers of the}} blade. Hachibei urges her to not let Toki <b>take</b> <b>hold</b> <b>of</b> Mekkimaru and gives it to her. She later gives a false report to Toki, leading his forces to pursue Chie's lover Li Long but Geki, Toki's right-hand man, discovers her deception and she becomes a nukenin outcast herself as she tries to destroy Mekkimaru.|$|E
25|$|On the 'ava cup being {{presented}} to a chief {{he takes it}} {{in his right hand}} and after a moment's pause, he spills a few drops onto {{the floor of the house}} on his right side at the same time speaking a few words in a low tone. Today these words have some Christian significance but in olden times were no doubt a form of prayer to one of the numerous gods. He then raises the cup and says Ia manuia which means be happy or prosperous. He then drinks a varying quantity of the 'ava and throws any remainder over his shoulder. He then hands the cup back to the tautu'ava who steps forward and returns to the refill the cup. Should the person served not desire to drink the 'ava he may take a mouthful and then spew it out, or he may merely touch the cup held in the hand of the bearer or he may <b>take</b> <b>hold</b> <b>of</b> the cup and holding it out in front of him address a few remarks to the assembly, finally exclaiming Ia manuia.|$|E
500|$|Stories were {{circulated}} that Hamilton {{had made}} two quips about God {{at the time}} of the Constitutional Convention in 1787. During the French Revolution, he displayed a utilitarian approach to using religion for political ends, such as by maligning Jefferson as [...] "the atheist," [...] and insisting that Christianity and Jeffersonian democracy were incompatible. After 1801, Hamilton further asserted the truth of Christianity; he proposed a Christian Constitutional Society in 1802, to <b>take</b> <b>hold</b> <b>of</b> [...] "some strong feeling of the mind" [...] to elect [...] "fit men" [...] to office, and he wrote of [...] "Christian welfare societies" [...] for the poor. After being shot, Hamilton spoke of his belief in God's mercy.|$|E

500|$|Michael {{returned}} to Gatchina {{and was not}} permitted {{to return to his}} unit or to travel beyond the Petrograd area. On 5 April 1917, he was discharged from military service. By July, Prince Lvov had resigned as Prime Minister to be replaced by Alexander Kerensky, who ordered ex-Emperor Nicholas removed from Petrograd to Tobolsk in the Urals because it was [...] "some remote place, some quiet corner, where they would attract less attention". On the eve of Nicholas's departure, Kerensky gave permission for Michael to visit him. Kerensky remained present during the meeting and the brothers exchanged awkward pleasantries [...] "fidgeting all the while, and sometimes one would <b>take</b> <b>hold</b> <b>of</b> the other's hand or the buttons of his uniform". It was the last time they saw each other.|$|E
500|$|When the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools {{sought to}} usurp rule-making powers {{with regard to}} athletics, Aigler defended the {{authority}} and jurisdiction of the Big Ten. He said: [...] "By agreement of the universities constituting the Big Ten for many years the making of rules and administration of athletic affairs, except that of purely local concern, have been delegated to the conference. This conference was a pioneer in athletic reform movements. Its organization has been the model for many years {{all over the country}} and its legislation generally has been widely copied. The aim of the conference not only has been to provide uniform eligibility rules, but also to *** and keep athletic activities in a proper relationship to the main business of the universities. Recently there has been developed in the North Central association a movement to <b>take</b> <b>hold</b> <b>of</b> matters heretofore handled by the conference." ...|$|E
500|$|Although he {{occasionally}} downplayed his own contribution to literature, Creangă himself {{was aware that}} his texts went beyond records of popular tradition, and made significant efforts {{to be recognized as}} an original author (by corresponding with fellow writers and willingly submitting his books to critical scrutiny). Vianu commented at length on the exact relationship between the narrative borrowed from oral tradition and Creangă's [...] "somewhat surreptitious" [...] method of blending his own style into the folkloric standard, likening it to the historical process whereby local painters improvised over the strict canons of Byzantine art. Creangă's complex take on individuality and the art of writing was attested by the his own foreword to an edition of his collected stories, in which he addressed the reader directly: [...] "You may have read many stupid things since you were put on this Earth. Please read these as well, and where it should be that they don't agree with you, <b>take</b> <b>hold</b> <b>of</b> a pen and come up with something better, for this is all I could see myself doing and did." ...|$|E
