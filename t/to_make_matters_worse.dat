5|$|<b>To</b> <b>make</b> <b>matters</b> <b>worse</b> for the government, {{industrial}} unrest was a persisting problem, {{particularly in}} the economically key states of New South Wales and Victoria. The opposition had become more potent as well: Scullin was widely recognised {{as one of the}} parliament's most gifted and articulate members; even his opponents respected his personal probity. Scullin forecast that the Australian economy was highly vulnerable given its indebtedness, and was on a course for severe depression if government finances were not turned around dramatically.|$|E

5|$|As the club's {{fortunes}} declined, {{they found}} themselves unable to attract many stars (Welsh international goalkeeper Jack Kelsey being a notable exception), while up and coming players such as David Herd left for more successful clubs. Jack Crayston and George Swindin, both former players, followed Whittaker but could not replicate his success. Apart from finishing third in 1958–59 and fifth in both 1955–56 and 1956–57, Arsenal usually finished in mid-table. Nor did the club have much luck in the FA Cup — after reaching the final in 1951–52, Arsenal would not get beyond the quarter-finals again until 1970–71. <b>To</b> <b>make</b> <b>matters</b> <b>worse</b> for the club, Tottenham Hotspur won the Double in 1960–61.|$|E

Repulsed by Roy's obnoxious, boorish personality and insults toward people, including Lisa, Coach finds Roy not good enough for her. However, Coach is too reluctant to tell her about Roy because she appears to like him and wants her father's blessings. <b>To</b> <b>make</b> <b>matters</b> <b>worse,</b> at Melville's restaurant, Roy forces her to pay for dinner herself, which makes Coach angrier. Therefore, witnessing Roy's treatment on her, Coach's friends convince him to tell Lisa about Roy before it is too late.|$|E
5|$|However Butlin did {{not remain}} celebrating for long; he {{required}} a further $2.25 million (2011:£) {{to complete the}} camp, and <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>matters</b> <b>worse</b> American tourists {{were not used to}} the holiday camp mentality so the venture held little interest. In an attempt to save the camp, Butlin sold the hotel leases to an American firm. By November 1950, the subsidiary company handling the Caribbean resort was ordered to be wound up by a court. Butlin admitted defeat and focused his efforts back in Europe. In the late 1940s Butlin had successfully opened hotels outside the Skegness and Ayr camps, so he now saw his opportunity to expand into this market. Butlin began acquiring hotels in Saltdean, Blackpool and Cliftonville.|$|E
5|$|The 1997–98 {{season was}} Manchester United's sixth {{season in the}} Premier League, and their 23rd {{consecutive}} season in the top division of English football. The campaign ended in disastrous fashion, having been pipped to the Premier League title by Arsenal, who managed a ten-match winning streak {{in the last two}} months of the season as well as being eliminated by league strugglers Barnsley and French outfit AS Monaco in the FA Cup and UEFA Champions League, respectively. <b>To</b> <b>make</b> <b>matters</b> <b>worse,</b> United entered March still in contention for a League and European double after opening up a 12-point gap, regardless of the fact that nearest challengers Arsenal had three games in hand. Thus, the season ended with only the Charity Shield in the cabinet.|$|E

5|$|The {{relatively}} successful {{resolution of}} the crisis in the northwest did nothing to help recover the losses in the southeast. <b>To</b> <b>make</b> <b>matters</b> <b>worse,</b> in 1369 (the date is disputed), the Ottoman Turks under Murad I conquered Adrianople (in 1363) and made it the effective capital of their expanding state. At the same time, they also captured the Bulgarian cities of Philippopolis and Boruj (Stara Zagora). As Bulgaria and the Serbian princes in Macedonia prepared for united action against the Turks, Ivan Alexander died on February 17, 1371. He was succeeded by his sons Ivan Sracimir in Vidin and Ivan Šišman in Tǎrnovo, while the rulers of Dobruja and Wallachia achieved further independence.|$|E
5|$|Andronikos {{began his}} reign well; in particular, the {{measures}} {{he took to}} reform {{the government of the}} Empire have been praised by historians. According to George Ostrogorsky, Andronikos was determined to root out corruption: Under his rule, the sale of offices ceased; selection was based on merit, rather than favouritism; officials were paid an adequate salary so as to reduce the temptation of bribery. In the provinces, Andronikos's reforms produced a speedy and marked improvement. The aristocrats were infuriated against him, and <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>matters</b> <b>worse,</b> Andronikos seems to have become increasingly unbalanced; executions and violence became increasingly common, and his reign turned into a reign of terror. Andronikos seemed almost to seek the extermination of the aristocracy as a whole. The struggle against the aristocracy turned into wholesale slaughter, while the Emperor resorted to ever more ruthless measures to shore up his regime.|$|E
5|$|Homer, having {{forgotten}} Marge's birthday, rushes {{out to buy}} her {{a present}} at the Springfield Mall. He finds a bowling ball and decides to buy it for her. During the night of her birthday dinner at the Singing Sirloin, Marge is happy with the kids' presents of French perfume from Bart and a macaroni and glue card of her as the Mona Lisa from Lisa. However, she is offended by Homer's gift as it is another demonstration of his thoughtless gift giving history, which her sisters Patty and Selma Bouvier had reminded her of earlier. <b>To</b> <b>make</b> <b>matters</b> <b>worse,</b> as he presents his 'gift', it bursts through its box and squashes Marge's birthday cake. Deeply resentful, Marge reminds him that not only has she never gone bowling in her life, but the ball is also inscribed with his name.|$|E

5|$|Las Casas {{worked there}} in adverse {{conditions}} for the following months, being constantly harassed by the Spanish pearl fishers of Cubagua island who traded slaves for alcohol with the natives. Early in 1522 Las Casas left the settlement to complain to the authorities. While he was gone the native Caribs attacked the settlement of Cumaná, burned {{it to the ground}} and killed four of Las Casas's men. He returned to Hispaniola in January 1522, and heard the news of the massacre. The rumours even included him among the dead. <b>To</b> <b>make</b> <b>matters</b> <b>worse,</b> his detractors used the event as evidence of the need to pacify the Indians using military means. The tragic outcome of Las Casas's great mainland adventure made him turn his life in a new direction.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{scientists}} at Los Alamos were eager {{to return to their}} laboratories and universities, and by February 1946 all of the wartime division heads had left, but a talented core remained. Darol Froman became head of Robert Bacher's G division, now renamed M Division. Eric Jette became responsible for Chemistry and Metallurgy, John H. Manley for Physics, George Placzek for Theory, Max Roy for Explosives, and Roger Wagner for Ordnance. The number of personnel at Los Alamos plummeted from its wartime peak of over 3,000 to around 1,000, but many were still living in temporary wartime accommodation. <b>To</b> <b>make</b> <b>matters</b> <b>worse,</b> the water pipe to Los Alamos froze and the water had to be supplied by tanker trucks. Despite the reduced staff, Bradbury still had to provide support for Operation Crossroads, the nuclear tests in the Pacific.|$|E
5|$|Tennessee {{was ranked}} No. 13 in the Associated Press preseason poll {{at the start}} of the season, but won just one game in its first four of the season, causing the Volunteers to drop out of the top 25 for the first time since 1989, {{breaking}} a streak of 84 consecutive weeks in the poll. <b>To</b> <b>make</b> <b>matters</b> <b>worse,</b> Tennessee's two starting quarterbacks suffered season-ending injuries during that four-game span. In the Volunteers' season-opener against UCLA, Jerry Colquitt suffered a knee injury. Backup quarterback Todd Helton was hurt in the fourth game of the season, a loss to Mississippi State. In response to the poor start, Fulmer overhauled his defense and coped with the loss of his first- and second-string quarterbacks by bringing in acclaimed freshman Peyton Manning, son of National Football League star Archie Manning.|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- As legacy {{software}} {{systems have}} been developed and maintained by {{a considerable amount of}} investment over the past decade, the systems became potential assets in an organization. However, the structure and documentation are incomplete and have been deteriorated gradually. <b>To</b> <b>make</b> <b>matter</b> <b>worse,</b> the pressure of adjusting the legacy systems to new technology such as web services and telematics in heterogeneous and distributed environment is on the increase. In this paper, we introduce a component extraction technique that identifies candidate functionality for reuse in the source codes with the help of candidature criterion for legacy systems written in IBM CICS/COBOL language. The criteria are composed of various metrics with respect to patterns of business logic. And then we design and implement a re-engineering prototype toolset that assists in understanding and reusing legacy systems...|$|R

5|$|The people, {{who felt}} the {{severity}} of his laws, {{at the same time}} acknowledged their justice, and found themselves protected from the rapacity of their superiors. Andronikos's energetic efforts to rein in the oppressive tax collectors and officials of the empire did much to alleviate the lot of the peasantry. However, his efforts to check the power of the nobility were considerably more problematic. The aristocrats were infuriated with him, and <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>matters</b> <b>worse,</b> Andronikos seems to have become increasingly deranged; executions and violence became increasingly common, and his reign turned into a reign of terror.

5|$|U-43 was due {{to depart}} Lorient on a war patrol to an area off Freetown, west Africa, but early on 4 February 1941, she sank while tied to Ysere, an old sailing ship which {{was used as a}} {{floating}} pier. Valves and vents had been tampered-with the previous day, but no one had noticed the slow, but steady ingress of water into the bilges. <b>To</b> <b>make</b> <b>matters</b> <b>worse</b> and contrary to a Befehlshaber der U-Boote (BdU—U-boat command headquarters) directive, a hatch had been left open, allowing water to pour into the after torpedo room. Two petty officers were found to be most at fault; but Lüth, as captain, was ultimately responsible. However, according to author Jordan Vause, no record of punishment seems to have survived and Lüth's career {{does not appear to have}} been affected. U-43 was refloated and Lüth took it back out into the North Atlantic in May 1941.|$|E
5|$|After his {{quarrel with}} the Royalist court in exile, Rupert {{travelled}} to Heidelberg {{to visit his}} brother Charles Louis, now partially restored as Elector Palatine, where the two had an ambivalent reunion. Charles Louis and Rupert had not been friendly as children and had almost ended up on opposite sides during the Civil War. <b>To</b> <b>make</b> <b>matters</b> <b>worse,</b> Charles Louis had been deprived of half the old Palatinate under the Peace of Westphalia, leaving him badly short of money, although he still remained responsible under the Imperial laws of apanage for providing for his younger brother and had offered the sum of £375 per annum, which Rupert had accepted. Rupert travelled on to Vienna, where he attempted to claim the £15,000 compensation allocated to him under the Peace of Westphalia from the Emperor. Emperor Ferdinand III warmly welcomed him, {{but was unable to}} pay such a sum immediately—instead, he would have to pay in installments, to the disadvantage of Rupert.|$|E
50|$|The play {{opens with}} the two thieves, Honziguera and Panarizo reuniting. Honziguera is upset that Panarizo did not stay behind at the tavern to steal the money of the drunken patrons. Panarizo is upset that Honziguera left him at the tavern by himself with a large debt. <b>To</b> <b>make</b> <b>matter</b> <b>worse,</b> Panarizo left their weapon, a sword, behind. While Honziguera is scolding Panarizo about leaving the sword, Panarizo states that he is hungry, and tells Honziguera to give him {{something}} to eat. Honziguera responds that he is also hungry {{and that he is}} waiting around for a simpleton who passes by every day carrying food for his wife who is in jail. He {{has come up with a}} plan to trick this simpleton out of the food he is carrying, filling his own belly and his partner's in the process.|$|R

Her brother is now in charge of the estate, the servants and maids whom she knew for years and were almost part of the family have died and been replaced by new members of staff who are cold and unfamiliar. Her father, Count Blancheville, has been horribly disfigured and lives secluded in one of the castle's isolated towers. Count Blancheville believes that the family curse will be lifted if Emily dies before her 21st birthday (thanks to some kind of ancient prophecy). Emily is 20 years old and her birthday is only 5 days away. <b>To</b> <b>make</b> <b>matter</b> <b>worse,</b> her father escapes from the tower and disappears, only to show up trying to convince Emily to embrace 'sweet death'.|$|R
40|$|Mining {{association}} rules {{from large}} databases is very costly. We propose to develop parallel algorithms for this task on shared-memory multiprocessor (SMP). All proposed parallel algorithms for other paradigms follow the conventional level-wise approach : they need as many iterations as {{the length of}} the maximum large itemset. <b>To</b> <b>make</b> <b>matter</b> <b>worse,</b> they impose a synchronization in every iteration which would cause serious I/O contention on shared-memory parallel system. An adaptive asynchronous parallel mining algorithm APM has been proposed for SMP. All processors generate candidates dynamically and count itemset supports independently without synchronization. Two optimization techniques have been proposed for the reduction of database scanning and the number of candidates. The algorithm APM has been implemented on a Sun Enterprise 4000 shared-memory multiprocessor with 12 nodes.

5|$|As {{the vice}} {{industries}} crashed, so did tourism, {{and the rest}} of the Galveston economy declined with it. The economy stagnated during the 1950s, and after 1957 the Free State was effectively gone. Fort Crockett, which had been used as an Army recreation center following the war, was shut down in 1955. Many of the island's most important entertainment business leaders left the city and set up shop in Las Vegas. Neither the economy nor the culture of the city were the same afterward. Civic leaders made several failed attempts at new ventures, including the Oleander Bowl football tournament (1948) and the Pelican Island bridge (1956) for access to a new industrial park, which never materialized. The city's television station, KGUL, moved to Houston in 1959; the telephone company headquarters and many other businesses relocated off the island as well. <b>To</b> <b>make</b> <b>matters</b> <b>worse,</b> some of the island's attractions were destroyed by Hurricane Carla in 1961 and never rebuilt.|$|E
5|$|At de Launay's request, an {{additional}} force of 32 {{soldiers from the}} Swiss Salis-Samade regiment {{had been assigned to}} the Bastille on 7 July, adding to the existing 82 invalides pensioners who formed the regular garrison. De Launay had taken various precautions, raising the drawbridge in the Comté tower and destroying the stone abutment that linked the Bastille to its bastion to prevent anyone from gaining access from that side of the fortress. The shops in the entranceway to the Bastille had been closed and the gates locked. The Bastille was defended by 30 small artillery pieces, but nonetheless, by 14 July de Launay was very concerned about the Bastille's situation. The Bastille, already hugely unpopular with the revolutionary crowds, was now the only remaining royalist stronghold in central Paris, in addition to which he was protecting a recently arrived stock of 250 barrels of valuable gunpowder. <b>To</b> <b>make</b> <b>matters</b> <b>worse,</b> the Bastille had only two days' supply of food and no source of water, making it impossible to withstand a long siege.|$|E
5|$|By 1838 it {{had become}} clear that {{construction}} costs for the town were spiralling out of control. <b>To</b> <b>make</b> <b>matters</b> <b>worse,</b> the railway's engineer informed Hesketh-Fleetwood {{that the cost of}} the railway was expected to exceed £300,000. The company had also sold far fewer shares than had been hoped. Frederick Kemp was collecting rents and rates from tenants, and Hesketh-Fleetwood repeatedly asked him for money to pay some of the mounting bills. Kemp, a more forceful character than his employer, kept claiming that there was no money. Hesketh-Fleetwood turned to his brother Charles and asked him to get £4,000 out of Kemp. Charles was more assertive, but Kemp said that the money had been spent on workers' wages and produced yet more invoices that needed to be paid. During Hesketh-Fleetwood's many absences from the Fylde, Kemp managed to involve himself in a number of enterprises in the town, to his own financial advantage. The railway was taking longer than expected and, with mounting debts, Hesketh-Fleetwood grew increasingly depressed and began to withdraw from society.|$|E
