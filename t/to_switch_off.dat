3000|$|In this section, {{we provide}} both {{heuristic}} and progressive solutions <b>to</b> dynamically <b>switch</b> <b>off</b> the redundant PBSs for energy saving, which uses the utility function provided in Section 3.2. The {{effect of the}} energy-saving algorithms is represented {{in terms of the}} number of active PBSs, yet the quantity of the energy saved considering practical power consumption model is an interesting topic for future study. Similar <b>to</b> the <b>switching</b> <b>off</b> algorithm proposed in [16], we first propose the HDSO algorithm, which tests all PBSs in the network one by one to see whether they can be <b>switched</b> <b>off.</b> Unlike the algorithm in [16] which just stops when one BS fails to transfer its UEs due to the unavailable resource the nearby BSs can provide, we consider that there still exists the potential of <b>switching</b> <b>off</b> other active PBSs when just one PBS fails <b>to</b> be <b>switched</b> <b>off.</b> The detailed description of the HDSO algorithm is summarized in Algorithm 1. When the algorithm terminates, the PBSs of set [...] B_off are <b>switched</b> <b>off,</b> and the remaining PBSs remain active until the next time spot of reconfiguration.|$|R

The square is a popular tourist site near the regime's nerve centre and the scene of 1989 democracy protests that were crushed by the Chinese authorities. A police officer was filmed asking the Sky team <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> <b>off</b> their camera, saying they were now inside the Forbidden City and did not have permission to film there. While they had permission to film in the square, Stone said police told him the team were not displaying their passes correctly, and noted he was not carrying his passport as required.

25|$|The {{second major}} {{incident}} of the boat's career happened on 1 March 1981, when Onslow was participating in wargames with a Royal New Zealand Navy frigate {{off the coast}} of Sydney. While operating at periscope depth, the submarine spotted an 'enemy' P-3C Orion aircraft and stopped snorting (the process of taking in air to operate the boat's two diesel generators and expelling the produced exhaust through a snorkel) in preparation to go deep. Both generators were turned off, but upon diving, it was quickly discovered that the starboard diesel had failed <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> <b>off</b> or had restarted and as the exhaust snorkel was sealed, the carbon monoxide exhaust filled the submarine. Onslow rapidly resurfaced, and the exhaust was pumped from the submarine. Able Seaman Christopher Passlow, who had been on the lower deck of the submarine at the time, died of asphyxiation and carbon monoxide poisoning, while another eighteen were rendered unconscious or were convulsing because of blood poisoning. Upon returning to base, doctors found that one-third of the 66 survivors had absorbed twice the lethal limit of carbon monoxide into their blood. The company was given a week's leave, with no further assistance from the RAN; psychological or otherwise. Two submariners were later awarded decorations for bravery.|$|E

We tested whether an acting habit (<b>switching</b> <b>off</b> the light upon leaving a room) supports execution of the intention <b>to</b> act (<b>switching</b> it <b>off),</b> but hinders the intention to abstain from acting (not <b>switching</b> it <b>off).</b> Conversely, a habit of not <b>switching</b> <b>off</b> the light (a non-acting habit) is expected to obstruct execution of the intention <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> the light <b>off,</b> but facilitates the intention <b>to</b> not <b>switch</b> it <b>off.</b> Results support these ideas, and underscore the importance of differentiating between habits resulting from frequently acting and frequently not acting...|$|R

Nicole came to visit the baby and Marilyn caught her breastfeeding George, while she was alone with him. Symons called the scenes [...] "volatile." [...] Nicole was unaware that Marilyn has reservations about her spending time with the baby. Of the breastfeeding scene, Symons stated: [...] "Marilyn is shocked and offended, and this cuts to the very core of her worries - that she doesn't have the same natural mothering instincts as George's birth mother.

500|$|Commentators {{noted that}} the ending was {{genuinely}} unsettling and dark. Rachel Aroesti, writing for theguardian.com, described the episode as moving [...] "from a twee period piece to {{what has to be}} the most depraved half-hour of television ever to grace the festive schedules". For many critics, the final twist was praiseworthy; it was characterised variously as the episode's [...] "secret weapon", [...] "very fitting", [...] "suitably macabre", and [...] "fantastically nasty". For Hughes, it [...] "was a lovely sting in the tale, and one of which Dahl would almost certainly have approved". Two reviews in The Times, however—one unsigned, and one by Matt Rudd—were more critical. The unsigned review advised viewers <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> <b>off</b> before the end, as [...] "the fabulous styling gives way to a gratuitously nasty conclusion, a bad misjudgment from such a talented writing team". For Rudd, the shocking ending served no purpose; critical of [...] "shocking for the sake of shocking", he argued that the episode's [...] "half-hour of self-satisfied 1970s pastiche followed by a frenzied knife attack is very unpleasant indeed".
