30|$|Camels (Camelus dromedarius) as drought-resistant {{livestock}} {{species have}} become an important facet in the economy, ecology and culture of pastoralists, particularly under current climate variability and environmental change (Hesse and Cotula 2006; Krätli et al. 2013; Megersa et al. 2014 b). Prolonged drought spells in many arid and semi-arid areas have heightened the importance of camel rearing among several pastoral groupings in these regions (Evans et al. 1995). Camels, unlike other livestock species, are uniquely adapted to hot and arid environments that are unsuitable for crop production, thus contributing significantly to the food security of pastoral households (Ahmad et al. 2010). This {{is because they are}} reliable milk producers during dry seasons when other livestock species such as cattle, sheep and goats have lower milk production levels (Farah 2004). Camels have thus shown enormous potential to enhance the livelihoods and build the resilience of pastoral communities to impacts of climate variability and change. For example, among both the transhumant and semi-transhumant communities such as the Samburu, Rendille, Borana and Somali of eastern Africa, camels have played a pivotal buffering role in safeguarding livelihoods against intermittent drought periods (Belay et al. 2005; Elhadi et al. 2015; Flintan et al. 2011; <b>Tangus</b> et al. 2004). This explains the observed recent transitions to camel rearing in the east African region (Schwartz et al. 2012) as communities such as the Karrayyuus in Ethiopia and Borana, Samburu and Masaai that were traditionally cattle rearing have adopted camel production (Amante 2014; Kagunyu and Wanjohi 2014; Schwartz et al. 2012).|$|R

25|$|In the 1970s, a more {{conventional}} armoured Land Rover was built for the Royal Ulster Constabulary in Wales called the Hotspur. The Land Rover <b>Tangi</b> was built by the Royal Ulster Constabulary's own vehicle engineering team during the 1990s. The British Army has used various armoured Land Rovers, first in Northern Ireland but also in more recent campaigns. They first added protective panels to Series General Service vehicles (the Vehicle Protection Kit (VPK)). Later they procured the Glover Webb APV and finally the Courtaulds (later NP Aerospace) Composite Armoured Vehicle, commonly known as Snatch. These were originally based on heavy-duty V8 110 chassis but some have recently been re-mounted on new chassis from Otokar of Turkey and fitted with diesel engines and air-conditioning for Iraq. Although these now {{have more in common}} with the 'Wolf' (Defender XD) Land Rovers that many mistakenly confuse them with, the Snatch and the Wolf are different vehicles.|$|E
40|$|In a {{few years}} it will be already a cêntenary since Russian {{traveler}} and Central Asian explorer colonel P. K. Kozlov discovered in 1909 the Tangut treasurc hidden in a suburgan (Mongolian for stúpa) in Khara Khoto. From this time on, the Tangut material from Khara Khoto (both written and artistic) is being systematically studied by scholars in different countries. But nevertheless, today, as many years ago, the <b>Tangus</b> and the civilization they created in some aspects remain a mystery. Such situation fi¡st of all {{is due to the}} fact that Tangut indigenous texts are still beyond scholarly comprehension. In order to reveal the Tangut mystery and reconstruct Tangut world-view, it is necessary to decode the information given in indigenous writings, particularly, in poetry (ceremonial odes and ritual songs), and to find its reflection in art objectsl, since both written and artistic parts from Khara Khoto suburgan represent a single source of information on the Tanguts (for details see Kepping 1999 a). Especially significant in this aspect are Tangut ceremonial odes, which, in my opinion, belong to the most ancient layer in Tangut poetry. They contain Tangut mythological ideas about the provenance of Tangut people, the place the people originated from, their wanderings, their pre-Buddhist beliefs, etc. The content of the odes today is actually impenefable, since, on the one hand, the odes are partly written in a special language (Tangut ritual language, for details see below), which demands special study; on the other hand, hints and symbols peculiar to the parts of odes written in common language are still not known to the scholars. It is clear that a laborious preparatory work is to be done, which includes establishing the meaning of some crucial terms constantly used in Tangut poetical Due to the exhibitions of Tangut art objects from Khara Kholo suburgon throughout the world in the 1990 s, not only scholars, but general public as well, had an opportunity to ap preciate the fascinating pieccs ofTangut art (Piotrovsky 1993). In this essay I have made an attempt to find in Tangul la¡lr ¿ corroboration of my ideas deduced from examining Tangut written sources (see notes 24 and 26) ...|$|R
