This study described the state of <b>the</b> <b>informal</b> business <b>sector,</b> <b>the</b> contributions thereof in local economic development, and the level of responsiveness from local authorities in Buffalo City Metropolitan Municipality. A survey questionnaire was administered to informal business actors in BCMM and semi-structured interviews were conducted with BCMM managers in the Business Development and Local Economic Development Directorates who were purposively selected because of the positions that they hold in the municipality. This study found that <b>the</b> <b>informal</b> business <b>sector</b> is underdeveloped in BCMM, and is imbued with development challenges, namely; support services such as infrastructure (designated municipal trading stalls) and access to financial support and the lack of strategy/policy dedicated to the prioritisation of the needs of <b>the</b> <b>informal</b> business <b>sector.</b> <b>The</b> <b>informal</b> business <b>sector</b> in BCMM is dominated by small and micro businesses.

40|$|Master of ArtsDepartment of Sociology, Anthropology, and Social WorkTheresa L. SelfaThe <b>informal</b> <b>sector</b> in India, as {{in other}} {{developing}} countries, {{is a source of}} employment and livelihoods to an overwhelmingly large proportion of workers, both in rural and urban areas. The sector is very heterogeneous and consists of both traditional and modern activities which vary widely across regions and occupations. Although <b>the</b> urban <b>informal</b> <b>sector</b> has been widely studied, not much work has been done on <b>the</b> non-agricultural rural <b>informal</b> <b>sector,</b> which has witnessed significant growth over the last several decades. The present study explores the functioning of <b>the</b> rural <b>informal</b> <b>sector</b> in Bihar, one of the most populous and backward states of India with a high incidence of poverty and low human development indicators. Based on case studies of two sectors – textiles and food processing – and using both quantitative and qualitative data, this study profiles the nature and characteristics of the sectors, and examines the roles of social networks and institutions in its functioning. Drawing from the economic sociology literature, it tries to understand how social networking in the rural labor market can affect economic outcomes.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to extend the Fields’ (1989) multi sector job-search model in a three sector general {{equilibrium}} framework by introducing international trade and an input, capital. The three sectors are the rural <b>sector,</b> <b>the</b> urban <b>informal</b> <b>sector</b> and <b>the</b> urban formal sector. The rural <b>sector</b> and <b>the</b> urban <b>informal</b> <b>sector</b> use one type of mobile capital while the urban formal sector uses sector-specific another type of capital. We find that the effects of the inflow of foreign capital in the urban formal sector on unemployment and social welfare crucially hinge on the relative factor intensities of the rural and <b>the</b> urban <b>informal</b> <b>sectors.</b> We show that there is a possibility of a trade-off between the government’s twin objectives of improvement in social welfare and mitigation of the urban unemployment problem.

40|$|MBA thesisContext The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to assess the potential impact of MTN MobileMoney and Vodacom M-Pesa services on <b>the</b> <b>informal</b> taxi <b>sector</b> in Cape Town, South Africa. The research intended to assess whether there was any impact of MTN MobileMoney and Vodacom M-Pesa mobile money systems on <b>the</b> <b>informal</b> taxi <b>sector,</b> as well as to determine the effect on business in relation to the role of banking in business. The method of data collection A questionnaire administered to respondents in <b>the</b> <b>informal</b> taxi <b>sector</b> in Cape Town, was used as a basis for the study. The sample comprised of twenty-five respondents and each respondent was requested to answer questions based on their current business operation, the banking practice used and opinions related to the use of MTN MobileMoney and Vodacom M-Pesa mobile money systems within their business. Key Findings MTN MobileMoney as well as Vodacom M-Pesa mobile money systems have had a small conceivably insignificant impact on <b>the</b> <b>informal</b> taxi <b>sector.</b> There is limited transfer of money between users in exchange for goods or services, as identified through the research conducted within <b>the</b> <b>informal</b> taxi industry. From evidence gathered and observations noted it can be concluded that MTN MobileMoney and Vodacom M-Pesa mobile money systems are too costly for the consumer to transact on a frequent basis and on small payment values. However mobile money is willingly accepted as forms of payment for a taxi fare, by the taxi owner, although once received the taxi owner in receipt of the funds predominantly transfers money between users who have relations with each other as well as purchasing airtime. vi Key Message There is willingness to accept MTN MobileMoney and Vodacom M-Pesa as forms of payment and thus mobile telephony companies should continue to find new and innovative ways to turn the mobile phone into a tool for accessing basic banking services. The banking industry will certainly need an improved understanding of people’s needs, current adoption and usage patterns of <b>the</b> <b>informal</b> taxi <b>sector</b> and develop products or mobile payment systems that engage with and meets <b>the</b> <b>informal</b> taxi <b>sector’s</b> needs. Mobile money systems could provide a platform that could potentially be leveraged to service the financial needs of <b>the</b> <b>informal</b> taxi <b>sector.</b> In addition considering that two million passengers in within Cape Town and sixteen million passengers within South Africa use the taxi industry daily, if successful it has the ability to enable and catalyse the development of mobile commerce across multiple sectors for both the high income earners as well as the bottom of the pyrami...|$|R
