Amir and Baba escape to Peshawar, Pakistan, {{and then to}} Fremont, California, where <b>they</b> <b>settle</b> in a run-down apartment. Baba begins work at a gas station. After graduating from high school, Amir takes classes at San Jose State University to develop his writing skills. Every Sunday, Baba and Amir make extra money selling used goods {{at a flea market}} in San Jose. There, Amir meets fellow refugee Soraya Taheri and her family. Baba is diagnosed with terminal cancer but is still capable of granting Amir one last favor: he asks Soraya's father's permission for Amir to marry her. He agrees and the two marry. Shortly thereafter Baba dies. Amir and Soraya settle down in a happy marriage, but to their sorrow they learn that they cannot have children.|$|E

5|$|On Christmas Eve, with Homer's help, the two steal all the Funzo toys from {{underneath}} every Christmas tree in Springfield {{with the intention}} of burning them in the town's long-running tire fire. However, Gary Coleman, who is a security guard at Kid First Industries, comes to stop them. The two parties argue all night until the next morning when <b>they</b> <b>settle</b> down into civilized discussion about the commercialization of Christmas. Coleman changes his opinion about the toy company and helps the Simpsons destroy the remaining functioning Funzo toys that were not destroyed in the tire fire. Afterwards, Homer invites Coleman to Christmas dinner at the Simpson family's house, where Mr. Burns shows up after deciding to donate money to Springfield Elementary following an epiphany he had that night.|$|E
5|$|At Hinata House, Keitarō meets Naru Narusegawa, {{who is also}} {{studying}} to enter Tokyo University. Naru ranks first {{in the whole of}} Japan on the practice exams, and Keitarō convinces her to help him study. As the two of them grow closer through their studies, and after Keitarō accidentally reads a small section of Naru's diary, he becomes increasingly convinced that Naru may be the girl with whom he made the promise. On {{the second day of the}} Tokyo University exam, Keitarō asks Naru about the promise and is stunned when she tells him he is mistaken. Despite their studying, and Naru's mock exam results, they both fail the exams. The pair then have an argument and independently run off to Kyoto to clear their heads. While on their trip <b>they</b> <b>settle</b> their differences and meet Mutsumi Otohime, who lives in Okinawa and is also studying for the Tokyo University exams.|$|E
5|$|Many {{of these}} are mirror-image duplicates of others, and others die before having {{to make all the}} choices in their ruleset, leaving 411 {{distinct}} species (412 if the infinite straight-line worm is included). 336 of these species eventually die. 73 patterns exhibit infinite behaviour, that is, <b>they</b> <b>settle</b> into a repeating pattern that does not return to the origin. A further two are strongly believed to be infinite and one remains unsolved. Eleven of the rules exhibit complicated behaviour. They do not die even after many billions of iterations, nor do they adopt an obviously infinite pattern. Their ultimate fate was unknown until 2003 when Benjamin Chaffin developed new methods of solving them. After many hours of computer time, nine of the eleven rules were solved, leaving the worms with rules {1,0,4,2,0,2,0} and {1,0,4,2,0,1,5}. The first of these was solved by Tomas Rokicki, who determined that it halts after 57 trillion timesteps, leaving only {1,0,4,2,0,1,5} unsolved. According to Rokicki, the worm is still active after 5.21019 timesteps. He used an algorithm based on Bill Gosper's Hashlife to simulate the worms at extraordinary speeds. This behaviour is considerably more complex than the related rectangular grid worm, which has a longest path of only 16 segments.|$|E

In the morning, Buffy and Willow discover {{they are unable to}} speak and become visibly distressed; they soon discover that everybody is unable to speak. The group gathers at Giles' where they see that the news is reporting that Sunnydale is suffering from an epidemic of laryngitis. Buffy and Riley, each concerned that chaos will ensue, find each other attempting to keep order on the streets. For the first time, Buffy sees Riley in his paramilitary role as an agent of The Initiative; he in turn is unaware that she is the Slayer. They exchange a look and then their first kiss, before parting to continue their efforts.|$|E
5|$|The larvae {{float in}} the pelagic zone of the ocean with other {{plankton}} {{for three to four}} weeks, during which a large number of them are eaten by predators. The larvae pass through three to five zoea stages before moulting into the post-larval glaucothoe stage; this process takes from 25 to 33 days. Upon reaching the glaucothoe stage of development, <b>they</b> <b>settle</b> to the bottom, find and wear a suitably sized gastropod shell, and migrate to the shoreline with other terrestrial hermit crabs. At that time, they sometimes visit dry land. Afterwards, they leave the ocean permanently and lose the ability to breathe in water. As with all hermit crabs, they change their shells as they grow. Young coconut crabs that cannot find a seashell of the right size often use broken coconut pieces. When they outgrow their shells, they develop a hardened abdomen. The coconut crab reaches sexual maturity around five years after hatching. They reach their maximum size only after 40 to 60 years.|$|E
5|$|The rate {{of growth}} of the Antarctic scallop is very slow {{compared}} to that of scallops living in warmer seas. It matures at 5 to 7 years old and spawning takes place in late summer. Little is known about the development of the veliger larvae but they may be planktonic for 4 or 5 months. Besides feeding on phytoplankton and small zooplankton, they may absorb dissolved organic matter and consume bacterioplankton. When <b>they</b> <b>settle,</b> metamorphosis takes place and the juveniles attach themselves with byssus threads, often attaching these to the upper valves of scallops, and remain attached for 3 to 5 years. While attached to the adult shell, the juveniles benefit from food particles in the fine detritus thrown up into the water column by movements of the adult. While studying the sizes and growth rates of adults, researchers came to realize that there were gaps in their records which were due to the fact that, in some years, no juveniles had survived.|$|E

5|$|Valene Ewing first {{appears in}} Dallas in 1978, {{as the mother}} of Lucy Ewing (Charlene Tilton) and the ex-wife of Gary Ewing (David Ackroyd, later played by Ted Shackelford), the middle son and the black sheep of the Ewing family. Valene and Gary Ewing were first married in their {{adolescence}} in 1961, when Gary was 17 years old and Valene was 15. When a pregnant Valene persuades Gary {{to take her to the}} Southfork Ranch in order to introduce her to his family, <b>they</b> <b>settle</b> down at Southfork, and Miss Ellie gave Gary a job as ranch foreman. However, Gary and Valene were soon pressured and manipulated by Gary's older brother, J.R. Ewing (Larry Hagman), who constantly tried to undermine and destroy their marriage. Meanwhile, Gary's father, Jock Ewing, put pressure on Gary to stand up and face his responsibilities for becoming a teenage husband and father-to-be. When Valene gives birth to their daughter Lucy, J.R. makes it clear that the child is an Ewing and will be raised by the Ewings themselves. J.R.'s constant interference causes Gary and Val's marriage to collapse. Under the pressure, Gary fell victim to alcoholism, became violent in the process and walked out on Val and Lucy. With Gary gone, Valene is then driven off Southfork by J.R., but she soon returns to get baby Lucy and flees to Virginia, and later to Tennessee, where she tries to get help from her mother, Lilimae Clements (Julie Harris), to take them in, but they are turned away. At this point, Valene and Lucy had already been tracked down by heavies that were hired by J.R. and the heavies rip Lucy right out of Valene's arms, and take Lucy back to Southfork to be raised by her paternal grandparents. When Valene later tried to take legal action to get Lucy back, J.R. warned Valene that he'd kill her if she came back to the state of Texas. Valene is prevented from seeing her daughter again for many years as a result of this.|$|E

25|$|Varve (or varved clay) is clay with visible annual layers, {{which are}} formed by {{seasonal}} deposition of those layers and {{are marked by}} differences in erosion and organic content.
